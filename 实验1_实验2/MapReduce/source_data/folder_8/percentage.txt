 For example, we have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange. The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4, or 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%.   
 
 A percentage is only one way of writing a [[ratio]]; one can also write it as a fraction or decimal. There are ways to convert fractions to percentages or decimals to percentages. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Percentages are useful in practice, because it allows one to [[wikt:compare|compare]] things that are not out of the same number.  For example, [[exam]] marks are often percentages, which can compare them even if there are more [[question]]s on one [[exam paper]] than the other.
