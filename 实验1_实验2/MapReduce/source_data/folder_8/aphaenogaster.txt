 '''''Aphaenogaster''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Myrmicinae|myrmicine]] [[ant]]s. Almost 200 [[species]] have been described. Also, 11 [[fossil]] species are known. They live worldwide except from [[South America]] and [[Southern Africa]].  
 
 They are often confused with ''[[Pheidole]]'' or ''[[Pheidologeton]]''. These two have major and minor workers, while ''Aphaenogaster'' has only a single worker caste. ''Pheidole'' has a 3-[[segmented]] club on its [[antenna]]. But ''Aphaenogaster'' has four segments and a larger body size. ''Pheidologeton'' has a 11-segmented antenna, while the antenna in ''Aphaenogaster'' is 12-segmented. < ref name=adu > Ants Down Under < /ref > 
 
 They make very thick, easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place. These entrances can have [[diameter]]s of up to 4 & nbsp;cm and are up to 30 & nbsp;cm deep. This resulted in their common name '''funnel ants'''. These nests can be a bad problem for [[golf]]ers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips, because the [[wikt:fragile|fragile]] ground easily breaks under [[pressure]]. < ref name=adu/ > 
 
 ''Aphaenogaster'' gets most of its food from tended [[aphid]]s on the [[root]]s of [[plant]]s. This explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels. The funnel-shaped openings could play a role in trapping [[arthropod]]s, which are also eaten. < ref name=adu/ > 
 
 Although these ants are not [[wikt:aggressive|aggressive]], they will bite when their nest is disturbed.
