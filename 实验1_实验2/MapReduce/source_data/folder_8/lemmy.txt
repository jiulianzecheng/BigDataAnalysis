After that, Lemmy met Simon King in a shopping center in Chelsea and then joined the band Opal Butterfly for a short period.

This new formation would begin Motörhead's success in live performances. In 1977, the band recorded their first album, ''Motörhead'', released 24 September 1977. The second album, titled ''Overkill'', contained two songs that would become Motörhead classics:  " Louie Louie "  and  " Overkill " . The peak of the band was 1980 and 1981 with a series of chart hits in the [[UK]], including the classic single  " Ace of Spades " , one of the biggest hits of the band.  
 
 Motörhead's members changed throughout the band's career, but Lemmy remained on bass and vocals from their start 1975 until his death in December 2015.
