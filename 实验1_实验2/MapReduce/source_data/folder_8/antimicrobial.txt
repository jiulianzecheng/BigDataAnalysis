 An '''antimicrobial''' is an agent that kills [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] or stops their growth. < ref name= " urlAntimicrobial â€“ Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary " > {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Antimicrobial|title=Antimicrobial|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424210931/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antimicrobial|archive-date=24 April 2009|access-date=2009-05-02|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, [[antibiotics]] are used against [[bacteria]], and [[antifungals]] are used against [[fungi]]. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are [[Microbicide|microbicidal]], while those that merely stop their growth are called [[biostatic]]. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as [[antimicrobial chemotherapy]], while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is called [[Antibiotic prophylaxis|antimicrobial prophylaxis]]. 
 
 The main types of antimicrobial agents are [[Disinfectant|disinfectants]] (such as [[bleach]]), which kill a wide range of microbes on non-living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, [[Antiseptic|antiseptics]] (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]] (which kill microorganisms within the body). The term  " antibiotic "  originally described only those creations that came from living microorganisms but is now also applied to [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] agents, such as [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] or [[Fluoroquinolone|fluoroquinolones]]. The term also used to be only applied to antibacterials, but its meaning has widened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further grouped into [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] agents, which kill bacteria, and [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic agents]], which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go past simply stopping germ growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been made to kill microbes on contact. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.porex.com/technologies/applications/antimicrobial/|title=Antimicrobial Porous Media {{!}} Microbicidal Technology {{!}} Porex Barrier Technology|website=www.porex.com|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-date=2017-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303065501/http://www.porex.com/technologies/applications/antimicrobial/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
