A '''picosecond''' is a [[SI unit|standard unit]] of measuring time. It is equal to 10 < sup > âˆ’12 < /sup >  of a [[second]]. It is one trillionth, or one millionth of one millionth of a second, or 0.000000000001 seconds. 
 
 One picosecond contains 1000 [[femtosecond]]s. There are 1000 picoseconds in one [[nanosecond]]. 
 
 ;Notation 
 * 10 < sup > -10 < /sup >  seconds is 100 picoseconds. 
 * 10 < sup > -9 < /sup >  seconds is 1 [[nanosecond]]. 
 
 ;Examples 
 * One picosecond is the [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of a bottom [[quark]]. 
 * Ten picoseconds after the [[Big Bang]], [[electromagnetism]] became its own [[force]]. 
 * It takes [[Speed of light|light]] about 3.3 picoseconds to travel one [[millimeter]]. 
 * It takes a common 3.0-[[Hertz|gigahertz]] computer 3.3  & times; 100 picoseconds to add two [[integer]]s together.
