 '''Exodus''' is the second book in the [[Torah]]. Exodus in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is called ''Shemot'', which means 'names.' 
 
 Exodus means 'going out' in [[Latin]]. It is about how the [[Hebrew people]] were led out of [[Egypt]] by [[God]]. [[Moses]], their leader, hears God's words and then tells the Israelites. Exodus ends with God's laws and his instructions on how to build a holy container called the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. 
 
 == Summary == 
 After the Hebrews went to Egypt to get food, the old Pharaoh died, and a new [[Pharaoh]] came to power and made each Hebrew a [[Slavery|slave]]. The Pharaoh made the Hebrews work very hard and told his soldiers to throw their babies into the [[Nile River]]. One baby,, was put in a reed basket and floated  on the Nile. He was later rescued by an Egyptian [[princess]] who named him [[Moses]]. Moses grew up in Pharaoh's palace, and later killed an Egyptian slavedriver. Moses escaped from Egypt and lived away from his people in Midian. He lived with Jethro, his father-in-law.

 One day, while Moses was tending his flocks, God appeared in a [[Burning Bush (Christian symbol)|burning bush]] to Moses and told him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. As Moses had no confidence in doing this, God gives him his brother [[Aaron]] to help him. Aaron was good at speaking and helped Moses speak to the Pharaoh. 
 
 When he returned to Egypt, Moses asked the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, but the Pharaoh refused. Through God's power, Moses causes ten [[plague]]s to come on Egypt. 
 
 The last plague was the death of all the firstborns in Egypt. Only the Israelites' firstborns were spared, as they had the blood of a young [[lamb]] on their door, so God did not let the [[Angel of Death]] enter their houses (12:23). The Pharaoh finally decided to let the Israelites go. 
 
 While the Israelites were crossing the [[Sea|Sea of Reeds]], the Pharaoh changed his mind and decided to follow them with his [[Soldier|troops]]. The Israelites passed safely as Moses split the Sea with his staff by God's power. Once the Hebrews all passed the sea closed, leaving all the Pharaoh's troops to drown. 
 
 Later, at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], Moses received the law and the [[Ten Commandments]] from God. But the Israelites [[sin]]ned against God by worshiping an idol (a golden calf). Moses broke the first two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments in anger. God later gave him another two. He also told Moses how to build the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. " Ten Times the Israelites rebelled and tested the L-D during Exodus despite his revealation to them; according to rabbinic literature it was because  " ..They were still laboring under the slave mentality of the Egyptian bondage.
