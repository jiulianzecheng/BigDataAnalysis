'''BeatrIX''' is a [[GNU]]/[[Linux]],[[live CD]]-based [[Linux distribution]] started by Steven Watsky, it was designed to look very simple, in order to be as easy to use as possible to new users. A new BeatrIX desktop has just four icons (e-mail, instant messaging, word processing and web browser). Hence, anyone who has some computer experience will be able to use BeatrIX. 
 
 BeatrIX is a small operating system, taking up only 200MB. The liveCD fits into 80 mm discs that can store up to 184 MB of data. 
 
 BeatrIX uses Linux 2.6.7 and [[GNOME]] 2.8 as its [[GUI]] desktop. It has productivity tools such as [[OpenOffice.org]] 1.1.2, Mozilla [[Firefox]] (version 1.0) web browser, [[Gaim]] (version 1.0), etc. 
 
 BeatrIX has been discontinued since 2005 due to Steven Watsky's lapse in health. Another distro called BeaFanatIX is using the code of BeatrIX and continuing development.
