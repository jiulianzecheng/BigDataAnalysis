In [[music]], an '''arpeggio''' is a group of notes in a [[chord]] which are played one after the other, instead of all at the same time. The arpeggio may either go up or go down, but it is more common going up.  
 
 The word ''arpeggio'' comes from the Italian word ''arpeggiare'', which means  " to play on a harp " . This is because [[harp]]s are very good at playing arpeggiated chords.  < ref name= " AB " > {{cite book |last = Taylor|first = Eric|author-link = Eric Taylor|title = The AB Guide to Music Theory, Part I|publisher = [[The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]]|series = The AB Guide to Music Theory|year = 1991|pages= 66|chapter= 8|isbn = 1-85472-447-9 }} < /ref > 
 
 An arpeggio is a type of [[broken chord]], but there are many different kinds. 
 
 Learning many [[musical instrument]]s include playing [[scale (music)|scales]] and arpeggios. They are often played as part of music examinations, especially for [[piano]] and the [[string instrument]]s. This is because these skills are useful for playing a lot of music. For example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude in C ({{audio|Bach C Major Prelude Werckmeister.ogg}}) is made of many different arpeggios. [[Guitar]]ists sometimes play arpeggios instead of [[strumming]], and [[banjo]] players do it a lot.

 An  " arpeggiated chord "  means a chord which is  " spread " . This means the notes do not start exactly at the same time. This is sometimes called ''arpeggiato'', and in modern music is called a ''rolled chord''. An arpeggiated chord is written with a wiggly line going from top to bottom in front of the chord. An arpeggiated chord is spread from the lowest to the highest note. Occasionally composers such as [[Béla Bartók]] ask for them to be played from top to bottom. This is shown by adding an arrow pointing down.
