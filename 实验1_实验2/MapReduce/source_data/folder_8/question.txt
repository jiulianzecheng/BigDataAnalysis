A '''question''' is what someone asks, usually when there is something that he or she does not know.  In writing, a [[question mark]] ( " ? " ) comes at the end of a question. However, just because a question is asked does not mean there is an answer.

 ==Types of question== 
 Sometimes a question has a simple answer like  " Yes "  or  " No " . 
 Sometimes a question has a more complicated answer like  " Maybe " , or  " I don't know " . There are so many types of questions and so many ways of answering questions. 
 
 ==Examples of these questions== 
 People may give a short answer. People may give a long answer. It depends on the question. 
 * " Guess what? " 
 *Who 
 * " Can I help you? " 
 * " Do you speak English? " 
 * " Is this your bag? " 
 * " What [[time]] is it? " 
 * " Where are you from? " 
 * " Why are you doing that? " 
 * " Who do you want to see? " 
 * " When will [[tea]] be ready? " 
 * " What did you say? " 
 * " How old are you? " 
 * " What time is the football game? " 
 * " Why do you look so funny? "

 * " Why do you allow people to change an [[online encyclopedia]]? " 
 
 ==Types== 
 Different kinds of why questions need different kinds of answers. A question like  " Why did you do that? "  clearly asks for an explanation. What that explanation might be depends on [[Context (language)|context]]. This kind of explanation is not right or wrong: it all depends on [[wikt:Circumstance|circumstance]]. The question and answer may also have to do with  " who " ,  " what " ,  " when "  and  " where " . 
 
 There are types or forms of explanations, < ref name=Keil > Keil, Frank C. and  Wilson, Robert Andrew. 2000. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k703lFAZby8C & pg=PA6 & dq=  ''Explanation and cognition.'' p6] < /ref >  including: 
 * explanations which are based on a principle or theory. < ref name= " Elman71 " > Elman, Colin. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1q8Frx25Y4wC & pg=PA71 & dq= ''Bridges and boundaries: historians, political scientists, and the study of international relations,'' p. 71]  " It is often said that a key difference between historians and political scientists is that historians tend to construct narrative-based explanations while political scientists ... tend to construct theory-based explanations " . < /ref > 
 ::''Who should I listen to?'' Answer: ''Mother knows best.'' 
 * explanations which rely on a model or [[pattern]]. 
 ::''Where does this part go?'' Answer: ''The pocket is on the left side of the shirt''. 
 * explanations which tell a story or [[wikt:narrative|narrative]]. < ref name= " Elman71 " / > 
 ::''When did you do that?'' Answer: ''I ran away after the dog barked.'' 
 * explanations which relate to [[goal]]s or [[wikt:purpose|purposes]].  
 ::''Why are you doing that?'' Answer: ''Because I'm going to build a boat.'' 
 Many kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type. 
 
 An explanation can be [[wikt:valid|valid]] or [[wikt:invalid|invalid]] or a [[wikt:combination|combination]] of both. Some explanations may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong. < ref > Blakesley, David and Hoogeveen, Jeffrey L. 2007.
