 A '''robbery''' is the act of [[theft|stealing]] from a person using [[violence]] or by causing [[fear]] of violence. A person who commits robbery is known as a robber. 
 
 A person who steals without using violence or fear (such as [[shoplifting|stealing items from a store]], or [[pickpocketing]], or [[car theft]]), commits [[theft]], not robbery. 
 
 In some US states, however, Simple Robbery refers to the knowing procurement of an item or items belonging to another by force but without “aggravating factors” such as violence or weapons.
