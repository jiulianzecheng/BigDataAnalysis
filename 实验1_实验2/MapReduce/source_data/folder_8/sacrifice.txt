 A '''sacrifice''' is giving something up. In many [[religion]]s, it usually is about giving something to [[God]] or [[gods]]. Many [[Pagan]] peoples made [[human sacrifice]]s and [[animal]] sacrifices. < ref > Arieh Kofsky, ''Eusebius of Caesarea Against Paganism'' (Boston: Brill Academic Publishers, 2002), p. 119 < /ref >  The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] play ''[[Iphigenia]]'' by [[Euripides]] contains an example of this. In the [[Old Testament]], [[Jewish]] people followed the laws about [[animal]] sacrifices in the book of [[Leviticus]]. [[Cow]]s and [[pigeon]]s were killed to make [[atonement]] with God. In the [[New Testament]], [[Christ]]'s death on the [[cross]] is seen as [[substitutionary atonement]] for [[sin]].
