'''Postgenderism''' means 'beyond gender'. 
 
 The word is used to describe the idea, the social current or the evolution that fades or gets rid of [[gender]] and/or [[sex]] in humans and [[society]]. 
 
 It is also used to describe a set of social norms or a persons identity that goes beyond classical gender and sex-determinations and places them in the past, let them fade or dissapear. 
 
 Postgenderism argues that marking people into different sex of gender groups and [[gender role]]s is not needed and results in a limitation on the possibilities of people and what they can achieve in life. 
 
 It foresees that gender will disappear with humans that don't want this, as a result of always changing ways the human species organises their lives and as a result of new technology advances. < ref name= " Dvorsky 2008 " > {{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}} < /ref >
