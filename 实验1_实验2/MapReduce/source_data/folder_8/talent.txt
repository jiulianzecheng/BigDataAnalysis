 A '''talent''' (or '''aptitude''') is the natural ability to do something better than most people. Talent is often confused with skill. We can develop and improve skill but not talent. Talent is the information written in [[gene]]s when we are born. That information never changes in our lifetime. It can only be inherited by our children. Talent means only a greater potential for doing something. < ref > https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/are-talents-genetic-or-learnt/ < /ref >  But talent is not enough. To get good results we need also practice. Even the greatest talent without practice will not give good skill. But on the other hand, even years of practice without talent will not give good results either. If somebody has no talent for music but learns to play piano several hours a day for two years, they will achieve some skill but never become a great musician.
