 The disease is caused by contact with [[fresh water]] containing the parasites. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  These parasites are from infected [[freshwater snail]]s. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The disease is very common among children in developing countries, as they are more likely to play in water. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Other high-risk groups include farmers, fishermen, and people using unclean water. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  It is a [[helminthiasis|helminth infections]]. < ref > {{cite web | title=Chapter 3 Infectious Diseases Related To Travel | url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/schistosomiasis | publisher=cdc.gov | access-date=30 November 2014 | date=1 August 2013 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402165447/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/schistosomiasis | archive-date=2 April 2015}} < /ref >  Eggs of the parasite may be found in urine or stool. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  [[Antibodies]] may also be found in the blood. < ref name=WHO2014/ > 
 
 < !-- Prevention and Treatment -- > 
 To prevent the disease use clean water and reduce snails. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The medicine [[praziquantel]] may be given once a year to everybody. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  This will decrease the number of people infected. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] for those who are known to be infected. < ref name=WHO2014/ >
