'''Methanogens''' are [[microorganisms]] that make [[methane]] as a [[metabolism|metabolic]] byproduct in [[anoxic]] conditions. The organisms are [[archaea]],  a different [[Domain (biology)|domain]] from [[bacteria]].  They are common in [[wetlands]], where they make [[marsh gas]].  
 
 Methanogens are also common in the [[digestive tract]]s of animals such as [[ruminant]]s and [[humans]]. Methane is often [[burping|belched]] out. < ref > {{cite book

 In [[Marine biology|marine]] [[sediment]]s methane is produced when [[sulfate]]s are low. This happens below the top layers. < ref > {{cite journal|author=J.K.

''Process Biochemistry'' '''45'''(8), 1214-1225] < /ref >  Some methanogens are [[extremophile]]s, found in environments such as [[hot spring]]s and submarine [[hydrothermal vents]] as well as in the  " solid "  rock of the Earth's crust, kilometers below the surface.  
 
 Methanogens convert [[acetic acid]] to methane in a [[fermentation]] process. Do not confuse them with [[methanotroph]]s, which use up methane for their carbon and energy requirements. Methanogens were discovered in 1776 and were formed 3.6 billion years ago.
