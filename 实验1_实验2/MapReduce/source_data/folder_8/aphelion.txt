 The ''' aphelion''' is the point in the [[orbit]] of an object where it is farthest from the [[Sun]]. The point in the orbit where an object is nearest to the sun is called the [[perihelion]]. The word ''aphelion'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words, ''apo'' meaning ''away, off, apart'' and ''[[Helios]]''. It's an apoapsis of an body in the [[Solar System]]. 
 
 The [[Earth's orbit]] has its aphelion around July the third, at which it is approximately 152.1 million kilometers or 94.5 million miles from the Sun. Due to the workings of the [[Gregorian calendar]], it may be a day or two earlier or later.
