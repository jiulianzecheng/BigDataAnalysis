 '''Istanbul''', formerly known as '''[[Constantinople]]''', is a mega city that sits in both Europe and Asia, divided by the [[Bosporus]]. Although it is the largest city of [[Turkey]], it is not the capital. It is the largest [[city]] in [[Europe]] by population. It is also the 3rd largest European city in size. It was the [[capital city]] of the old [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1923. The city has been known since ancient times by the older names '''[[Byzantium]]''' and '''[[Constantinople]]''' ({{lang-la|Constantinopolis}}; {{lang-el|Κωνσταντινούπολις}}, ''Konstantinoúpolis''). Being a [[seaport]], Istanbul is the main trade center of Turkey. 
 
 Part of Istanbul is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|title=Historic Areas of Istanbul|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/356/|access-date=2023-12-04|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Istanbul faces the [[Golden Horn]] and the [[Bosporus]] strait. The Bosphorus connects the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]], and separates [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. It's the only city around the world that is on two different continents. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Singh|first=Rahul|date=6 February 2022|title=Straddling Two Continents|work=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook India]]|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/straddling-two-continents/201608/amp}} < /ref >  The city is actually in both [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. < ref > {{Cite web

 Its original name was ''Byzantion'' in the [[Greek language]], known as ''Byzantium'' in the [[Latin language]]. Byzantium was originally settled as a colony by Greeks from Megara in 667 BC and named after their king, Byzas. In 196 AD, Byzantium was damaged by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], then rebuilt by the Roman Emperor [[Septimius Severus]]. [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] thought this city was in a nice location, and in 330, moved the capital of the Empire from [[Rome]] to there, as ''New Rome'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Nova Roma''; ''{{lang-el|Νέα Ρώμη}}'', ''Nea Rómi''), renaming the city ''Constantinople'', after his name. 
 
 When the Roman Empire was later divided into two, the East Roman Empire was known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], and its capital was in Constantinople, where [[Hagia Sophia]] had been built. Although it was captured by [[Crusade]]rs for a time, it continued as one of the political, cultural, religious, and economic centers of Europe until it finally fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Ottoman Turks Capture Constantinople|url=https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=26|access-date=2023-12-04|website=historyofinformation.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Istanbul became the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. After the Ottoman Empire ended, the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] was started with its capital at [[Ankara]]. Later in 1930, Constantinople was renamed Istanbul. 
 
 The [[Romanlar]] (Turkish Gypsys) have lived in Istanbul since 1054 at Sulukule, well known for their Music and Dance style. After 1453, by order of Mehmed II, Roma was settled in Istanbul from other parts of the Ottoman Empire. In some cases, they live in several Mahallas (quarters) together with Turks in Istanbul in the European and Asian parts of this city. < ref name= " gypsies "  / > < ref name= " gypsies " > https://www.istanbullife.org/gypsies-istanbul-turkey.htm < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://istanbultarihi.ist/472-the-gypsies-of-istanbul | title=THE GYPSIES OF ISTANBUL  & #124; History of Istanbul }} < /ref >
