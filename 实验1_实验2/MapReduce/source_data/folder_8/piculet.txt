 The '''piculets''' are a [[subfamily]] of small [[woodpecker]]s which are mostly in tropical [[South America]], with just three [[Asia]]n and one [[Africa]]n  [[species]]. 
 
 Like true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues to get their [[insect]] prey and [[zygodactyl]] feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that woodpeckers use when climbing trees. They are more likely to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk. 
 
 They eat insects and grubs mainly from decaying wood. They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters. 
 
 There are 30 species in all. < ref > del Hoyo J.; Elliott A.  &  Sargatal J. (editors) 2002. ''Handbook of birds of the world'', Volume 7: Jacamars to Woodpeckers.

 Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.
