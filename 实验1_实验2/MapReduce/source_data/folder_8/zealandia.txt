 '''Zealandia''', also known as the '''New Zealand continent''' or '''Tasmantis''', is an almost entirely underwater [[continent]], which sank after separating from [[Australia]] 60–85 million years ago and from [[Antarctica]] 130–85 million years ago. It was underwater about 23 million years ago, and most of it is sunken (over 93%) under the [[Pacific Ocean]]. 
 
 The continent of Zealandia has an area of ​​3.5 million km < sup > 2 < /sup > , is larger than [[Greenland]] or [[India]], and almost half the size of Australia. It is very long and narrow, from [[New Caledonia]] in the north and south beyond the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands|sub-Antarctic Islands of New Zealand]] in the south. [[New Zealand]] is the largest part of Zealandia that is above [[sea ​​level]], followed by New Caledonia.
