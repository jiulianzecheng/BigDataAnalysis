 '''Erosion''' is a process where natural forces like [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], and [[gravity]] transport [[rocks]] and [[soil]]. It is a [[geological]] process, and part of the [[rock cycle]]. Erosion occurs at the Earth's surface, and has no effect on the [[Earth's mantle]] and [[Earth's core|core]]. 
 
 Most of the [[energy]] that makes erosion happen is provided by the [[Sun]]. The Sun's energy causes the movement of water and ice in the [[water cycle]] and the movement of air to create wind.  
 
 Erosion can cause problems that affect humans. [[Soil erosion]], for example, can create problems for farmers. Soil erosion can remove soil, leaving a thin layer or rocky soil behind. Erosion can also cause problems for humans by removing rocks or soil that support buildings.  
 
 Erosion can be caused by natural elements such as wind and ice. 
 
 == Erosion by water == 
 [[File:Regenerosion offenerBoden Tagebau.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Water moving downhill can carry away pieces of rock and soil]]  
 
 Temperature changes cause pieces of rock to flake away from the surface. Also, the [[acid]] in rainwater dissolves rocks containing [[calcium carbonate]]. These processes are called [[weathering]].  
 
 Water erosion happens when water moves the pieces of rock or soil downhill. [[Waves]] also carry away small pieces of material. A wave can wash up onto the surface of rock or soil and then carry away pieces of material as it flows back into the [[ocean]] or [[lake]]. 
 
 The size of earth materials that can be moved by water depends on how fast the water is moving. A fast-flowing stream can carry large rocks while a slow-moving stream might only be able to carry very small things like [[clay]]. [[Canyon]]s are among the most obvious features made by erosion. Where a river meets the sea, it drops the solids, sometimes making a [[river delta]]. 
 
 === Tropical rivers ===

 Large tropical rivers like the [[Paraná River|Paraná]], [[Indus]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], [[Ganges]], [[Zambezi]], [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] carry huge amounts of [[sediment]] down to the sea. The [[Nile]], perhaps the world's longest river, carries much less sediment than the others because, part of the way, it runs through less fertile regions than the other great rivers. 
 
 The Amazon has by far the largest waterflow, with an average [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] greater than the next seven largest rivers combined. It has the largest [[drainage basin]] in the world, about {{convert|7050000|km2|sqmi}}. The Amazon accounts for about one-fifth of the world's total river flow. < ref name= " sterling " > Sterling, Tom 1979. ''Der Amazonas''.

 The sediment discharged by the gigantic mouth of the Amazon stains the sea brown for hundreds of miles out to sea. 
 
 When a glacier moves downhill,it pushes  &  pulls rocks with it. There is also another way. Cold weather causes water inside tiny cracks in rocks to freeze. When it freezes, the ice gets larger, &  pushes hard against the rock to break it. 
 
 == Erosion by wind == 
 Wind erosion occurs when wind moves pieces of earth materials. Wind erosion is one of the weakest kinds of erosion. Small pieces of earth material can be rolled along the ground surface by wind. Very small pieces can be picked up and carried by the wind. Sometimes, wind can carry small pieces of earth materials over large distances. Some [[sediment]] from the [[Sahara Desert]] is carried across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by wind. 
 
 One of the most famous examples of wind erosion occurred in the [[Dust Bowl]], when wind erosion severely damaged [[farming]] communities.

 == Erosion by gravity == 
 Gravity erosion is the simplest kind of erosion. Gravity simply pulls loose earth materials downhill. [[Landslide]]s are dramatic examples of gravity erosion. 
 
 == Erosion and tectonics ==

 [[Tectonics|Tectonic effects]] on erosion has long been recognized. For example, [[rivers]] form as a result of tectonic uplift (as [[Himalayas]] and [[Tibetan Plateau]]). < ref name=TCLE > {{cite journal|editor-last1=Willett|editor-first1=Sean D. |editor-first2=Niels |editor-last2=Hovius|editor-first3=Mark T. |editor-last3=Brandon |editor-first4=Donald M. |editor-last4=Fisher |title=Tectonics, climate and landscape evolution|journal=Geological Society of America|year=2006|volume=398|url=http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/398}} < /ref >  All of the Earth's mountain ranges were created by the upward movement of the land by changes beneath the Earth's surface. When the ground rises the whole weather system can also be changed including local sea levels, wind strength and direction, rainfall and more.  
 
 The Earth's landscape is a product of two factors. [[Tectonics]] builds up height by surface and rock uplift, and [[climate]] controls the erosion. Erosion wears away upland areas over time. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Alexander C.|title=How do landscapes record tectonics and climate?|journal=Lithosphere|year=2012 |volume=4|issue=2|pages=160–164 |doi=10.1130/RF.L003.1}} < /ref >  The interaction of these processes can form, modify, or destroy features of the Earth’s surface.
