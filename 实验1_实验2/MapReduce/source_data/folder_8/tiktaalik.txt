 '''''Tiktaalik''''' is a [[genus]] of [[extinction|extinct]] fish. This [[Sarcopterygii|sarcopterygian]] (lobe-finned) [[fish]] from the later [[Devonian]] has many features similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s (four-legged animals). < ref name=Nature > {{cite journal | quote=no | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | pages = 757–763 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.1038/nature04639 | title = A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/abs/nature04639.html | author = Edward B.

 ''Tiktaalik'' lived about 375 million years ago. It is part of the [[transitional fossil|transition]] between fish such as ''[[Panderichthys]]'', known from fossils 380 million years old, and early tetrapods such as ''[[Acanthostega]]'' and ''[[Ichthyostega]]'', known from fossils about 365 million years old. Its mixture of [[basal]] fish and [[derived]] tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers, [[Neil Shubin]], to call ''Tiktaalik'' a '[[Tetrapodomorpha|fishapod]]'. < ref > John Noble Wilford, ''The New York Times'', [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/science/05cnd-fossil.html?hp & ex=1144296000 & en=fe3427d67e965e46 & ei=5094 & partner=homepage ''Scientists call fish fossil the missing mink''], April 5, 2006. < /ref > < ref name=Innerfish > {{cite book|last=Shubin|first=Neil|title=Your inner fish|url=https://archive.org/details/yourinnerfishjou00shub_0|publisher=Pantheon|year=2008|isbn=9780375424472}} < /ref > 
 
 This, and other species like it, prove that legs started to develop before these animals were land-based. They were shallow-water [[carnivorous]] fish, or [[fishapod]]s. < ref name=Innerfish/ > < ref > Clack, Jenny 2012. ''Gaining ground: the origin and early evolution of tetrapods''. 2nd ed, Bloominton, Indiana: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35675-8}}, ({{Google books|6Ztrhm8uLQ0C }}) < /ref >  ''Tiktaalik'' was therefore a [[transitional fossil]], and an example of [[mosaic evolution]].

 [[Image:Fishapods.svg|thumb|center|350px|In the late [[Devonian]], descendants of [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] – like ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'' – showed a sequence of [[adaptation]]s: < ul >

 Descendants also included [[pelagic]] lobe-finned [[coelacanth]] species.]]
