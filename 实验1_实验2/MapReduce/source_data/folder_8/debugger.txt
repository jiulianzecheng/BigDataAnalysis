A '''debugger''' is a [[computer program]] that is used to test and  " debug "  other programs, mainly to solve [[software bug|programming bugs]].  
 
 Debuggers offer advanced functions such as: 
 #Running a program step by step ('''single-stepping'''), 
 #Stopping ('''breaking''') (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some kind of event by means of breakpoint (a place for stopping or pausing in a [[computer program|program]]), 
 #Tracking; which means following the values of some [[variable]]s,  
 #Some debuggers can change a program while it is running; some only watch it. 
 
 The same things that make a debugger useful for solving [[software bug]]s allow it to be used as a [[software cracking]] tool to defeat [[copy protection]] and other software protection features.
