 The term is sometimes confused with [[Mesolithic]], and the two are sometimes used as synonyms. Yet, when a distinction is made, Epipaleolithic is used for those cultures that were not much affected by the ending of the Ice Age < ref > like the [[Natufian]] culture of Western Asia (see article [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-10760 agriculture, origins of]. (2008). In [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved April 10, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online). < /ref >  and the term Mesolithic is reserved for Western Europe where the [[extinction]] of the [[Megafauna]] had a great influence on the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age.
