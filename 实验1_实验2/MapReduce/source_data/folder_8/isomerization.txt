 '''Isomerization''' is a thing that happens to [[molecules]] and parts of molecules. 
 
 Isomerization is when a molecule or part of a molecule changes shape but still has the same number of each kind of [[atom]].  The atoms change places, but they do not go away.  No new atoms come. 
 
 For example, when a [[ketose]] group changes to an [[aldose]] group, that is isomerization because both groups are -C < sub > 2 < /sub > H < sub > 3 < /sub > O < sub > 2 < /sub > .  They have two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms.  In the ketose group, the first carbon has a double bond to an oxygen and a single bond to the other carbon.  In the aldose group, the second carbon has the double bond to the oxygen, and the hydrogen atoms are in different places.  But they both have the same number of each kind of atom. < ref name=Lib > {{cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Organic_Chemistry_with_a_Biological_Emphasis_v2.0_(Soderberg)/12%3A_Reactions_at_the_-Carbon_Part_I/12.03%3A_Isomerization_at_the_-Carbon|access-date=May 21, 2021|editor=Tim Soderberg|title=12.3: Isomerization at the Î±-Carbon |date=10 August 2018 }} < /ref >
