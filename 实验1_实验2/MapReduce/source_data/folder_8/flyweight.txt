 The flyweight division was the last of boxing's eight traditional weight classes. Before 1909, anyone below [[featherweight]] was considered a [[bantamweight]]. In 1911, the organization that eventually became the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] held a match that crowned Sid Smith as the first flyweight champion of the world. [[Jimmy Wilde]], who reigned from 1914 to 1923, was the first boxer recognized both in Britain and the United States as a flyweight champion. < ref > {{cite book
