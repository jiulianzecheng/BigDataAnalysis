Fragment of a miniature from  " The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis "  (1272-1352), abbot of the [[monastery]] of St. Martin of the Righteous. Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]] 
 A '''pandemic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] παν ''pan'' all + δήμος ''demos'' people) is an [[epidemic]] (an outbreak of an [[infectious disease]]) that spreads across a large region (like a [[continent]]), or even worldwide. 
 
 == Common killers and pandemics == 
 According to the [[World Health Organization]], a pandemic exists when three conditions have been met: 
 
 * A disease emerges that is new to a [[population]]. 
 * The agent that causes the disease infects humans, causing serious illness. 
 * The agent spreads easily and sustainably among humans. 
 
 A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people. It must also be infectious. For example, [[cancer]] causes many deaths, but it is not a pandemic because it is usually not infectious. 
 
 == World Health Organization pandemic phases == 
 The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has developed a plan to prepare the global fight against [[influenza]]. It defines the stages of a pandemic and makes recommendations about what countries should do before and during a pandemic. The phases are: 
 
 Interpandemic period: 
 * Phase 1: No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans.  
 * Phase 2: No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a [[Variant (biology)|variant]] of the virus causes disease in animals. This means there is a threat of human disease. 
 Pandemic alert period: 
 * Phase 3: Humans get infected with a new subtype of the flu virus. However, the virus is not spreading from person to person. 
 * Phase 4: There are small cluster(s) of flu infection. Person-to-person spread is limited and localized. 
 * Phase 5: There are larger cluster(s) of flu infection. Person-to-person spread is still localized. 
 Pandemic period: 
 * Phase 6: Pandemic: The flu has spread throughout the general population. Person-to-person spread is increased and [[wikt:sustained|sustained]]..
