 The town started around [[Anno Domini|AD]] 600. The town was important in the middle ages. The first reason is that [[:en:Alnwick_Castle|Alnwick Castle]] was the home of the Percy Family, who were the [[:en:Earl_of_Northumberland|Earls of Northumberland]]. The Percys were the most powerful family in Northern England during the middle ages. The second reason was that the town was on [[A1 road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] that went between between [[Edinburgh]] and [[London]].
