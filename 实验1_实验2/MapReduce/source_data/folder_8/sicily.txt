 '''Sicily'''[[#Notes| < sup > [p] < /sup > ]] is the largest island in the [[Mediterranean]]. Along with some smaller islands it is an autonomous [[region]] of [[Italy]]. The [[capital city]] of Sicily is [[Palermo]]. The [[population]] was about 5,087,000 (over 5 million) in 2004. Sicily is the biggest region in the nation of Italy. 
 
 [[Phoenicia|Phoenician]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] people colonized the island in the 8th Century BC and sometimes fought wars there. [[Carthage]] controlled most of the island until [[Ancient Rome]] conquered it. In later centuries, [[Saracen|Saracens]] (who significantly impacted the Island genetically and culturally) fought against the [[Byzantine Greeks]], and [[Normans]] ruled it for a few centuries. After the revolts of Sicilian Vespers, the crown of Aragon and Spain took over the Island. Later, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] in the [[Risorgimento]] conquered it and brought it into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â€“1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].
