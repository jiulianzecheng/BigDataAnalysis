 '''Simony''' means that one pays for an office or a position in the [[hierarchy]] of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church|church]]. It is an offense against [[canon law]]. Simony became widespread in the [[Catholic Church]] in the 9th and 10th centuries. < ref > Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger, 1999 < /ref >  The name comes from Simon Magus, who appears in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:18-24. Simon Magus offers the disciples of [[Jesus]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], payment so that anyone he would place his hands on would receive the power of the [[Holy Spirit]]. This is the origin of the term ''simony''. < ref > ''The Reader's Encyclopedia'' (1965), New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, vol.2, ''p.''932,  " Simon. " < /ref >  but it also extends to other forms of trafficking for money in  " spiritual things " . < ref > Smith, W. (1880).
