 }} < /ref >  Poltergeists will bother only their focus. They are said to only last a few weeks, then will move on to another target. Often poltergeists are reported around children and adolescents. Some scientists think that poltergeists only exist in a person's head as a result of [[psychokinesis]]. They think that the  " poltergeist effect "  is a result of mental [[trauma]].
