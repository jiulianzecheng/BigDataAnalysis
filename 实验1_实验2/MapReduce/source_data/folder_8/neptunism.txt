'''Neptunism''' is a scientific theory of [[geology]] proposed by Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749â€“1817) in the late 18th century.  
 
 It proposed that [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] formed from the crystallisation of minerals in the early Earth's oceans. That is why it is called neptunism, because Neptune was the old Roman God of the sea. 
 
 There are many many different types of rock formation. [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed by processes very similar to neptunism. Basically, it makes rock out of bits of earlier rock and organisms.
