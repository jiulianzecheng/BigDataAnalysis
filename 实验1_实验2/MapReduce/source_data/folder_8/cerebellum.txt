 In all [[vertebrate]]s, including [[human beings]], the '''cerebellum''' is one of the main divisions of the [[brain]].  
 
 The cerebellum works mainly to control balance and coordinate movement. It combines signals from eyes, [[muscle spindles]], and ears with motor commands from the [[forebrain]] and helps to coordinate control of the body. More advanced regions of the human cerebellum may be crucial to language and mental dexterity. Bands of [[axon]]s extend from the cerebellum into the [[pons]].
