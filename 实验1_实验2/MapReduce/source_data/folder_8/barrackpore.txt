 == Etymology == 
 The name Barrackpore may have originated from the English word [[barracks]], because it was the site of the first cantonment of the British East India Company. The Ain-i-Akbari suggests that the name comes from  " Barbakpur " . Manasa Vijay, written by Bipradas Pipilai, refers to Barrackpore as  " Chanak " .
