The '''Cycliophora''' are a [[platyzoa]]n [[phylum]], based on a single [[genus]] '''''Symbion'''''. They are so different from other animals that they were put in their own [[phylum]]. They were discovered in 1995, and are the most recent new phylum. < ref name= " KF " > {{cite journal |author=P. Funch  &  R.M. Kristensen |year=1995 |title=Cycliophora is a new phylum with affinities to Entoprocta and Ectoprocta |journal=Nature |volume=378 |pages=711–714 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6558/abs/378711a0.html |doi=10.1038/378711a0 |issue=6558|s2cid=4265849 }} < /ref >  So far, three [[species]] have been found. 
 
 They live on the bodies of cold-water [[lobster]]s. They are [[microscopic]]: the feeding stage is about 0.3 & nbsp;mm long, and 0.1 & nbsp;mm wide. < ref > [http://www.answers.com/topic/cycliophora-wheel-wearers-biological-family Cycliophora. ''Answers.com''] < /ref > 
 
 Their life style is [[commensalism|commensal]], (a form of [[symbiosis]])  & ndash; they feed on the leftovers from the lobster's own meals. < ref > {{cite journal |author=P. Funch, P. Thor  &  M. Obst |year=2008 |title=Symbiotic relations and feeding biology of ''Symbion pandora'' (Cycliophora) and ''Triticella flava'' (Bryozoa) |journal=Vie et Milieu |volume=58 |pages=185–188 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Life stages == 
 They have three different body forms, and a two-stage [[life-cycle]]. < ref name= " pmid18937332 " > {{cite journal |author=Neves RC, Kristensen RM, Wanninger A |title=Three-dimensional reconstruction of the musculature of various life cycle stages of the cycliophoran ''Symbion americanus'' |journal=J.

 * '''Asexual Feeding Stage'''  & ndash; at this stage, the tiny animal is neither male or female. On the posterior end of the sac-like body is a stalk with an adhesive disc, which attaches itself to the host. On the anterior end is a ciliated funnel (mouth) and an [[anus]]. 
 * '''Sexual Stage'''  & ndash; these are even smaller than the feeding stage. 
 ** '''Male'''  & ndash; Has no mouth or anus, which shows the absence of a [[digestive system]]. It also has two reproductive organs. 
 ** '''Female'''  & ndash; Has a digestive system which collapses and reconstitutes itself as a [[larva]]. < ref name= " KF " / > 
 
 ==Reproduction== 
 ''Symbion'' can reproduce both [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by [[budding]] and sexually. In [[sexual reproduction]] the male attaches to a feeding stage and impregnates a budding female. The female then separates from the feeding stage and attaches herself to another host, where the larva in her develops. The female dies, and the larva escapes. 
 
 The sexual reproductive cycle is triggered when the host [[crustacea]]n moults its 'shell' ([[exoskeleton]]) in order to grow. < ref > Piper, Ross 2007. ''Extraordinary animals: an encyclopedia of curious and unusual animals''. Greenwood Press. < /ref >
