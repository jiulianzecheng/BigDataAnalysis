 The '''oxpeckers''' are the two species of [[bird]] which make up the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Buphagidae'''. < ref name= " Zuccon " > {{cite journal|last=Zuccon|first=Dario|author2=Cibois, Anne|author3=Pasquet, Eric|author4=Ericson, Per G.P.|year=2006|title=Nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data reveal the major lineages of starlings, mynas and related taxa|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=41|issue=2|pages=333–344| doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.007|pmid=16806992}} < /ref > 
 
 Oxpeckers are endemic to the [[savanna]] of Sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]]. Their names come from their habit of perching on large [[mammal]]s (both wild and domesticated) such as [[cattle]] or [[rhinoceros]]es, and eating [[tick]]s, [[botfly]] [[larva]]e, and other [[parasite]]s. 
 
 According to the more recent studies of [[phylogeny]], < ref name= " Zuccon " / > < ref name= " Cibois " > {{cite journal|last=Cibois|first=A|author2=Cracraft, J.|year=2004|title= Assessing the passerine 'tapestry': phylogenetic relationships of the Muscicapoidea inferred from nuclear DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=31|issue=1|pages=264–273| doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.12.002|pmid=15186812}} < /ref >  the oxpeckers are an ancient line related to  the [[Mimidae]] ([[mockingbird]]s, [[thrasher]]s  & c.) and [[starling]]s, but not particularly close to either. 
 
 Considering the known [[biogeography]] (distribution) of these groups, the most plausible explanation seems that the oxpecker lineage originated in Eastern or Southeastern Asia like the other two. < ref name= " Zuccon " / >  This would make the two species of ''Buphagus'' something like [[living fossil]]s. 
 
 ==Diet and feeding== 
 Oxpeckers feed exclusively on the backs of large mammals. Certain species seem preferred, whereas others, like the [[Lichtenstein's hartebeest]] or [[topi]] are generally avoided. The smallest regularly used species is the [[impala]], probably because of the heavy tick load and social nature of that species. In many parts of their range they now feed on [[cattle]], but avoid [[camel]]s. They feed on [[ectoparasite]]s, particularly [[tick]]s, as well as insects infecting wounds and the flesh and blood of some wounds as well. < ref name =  " HBW " / > 
 
 Oxpecker/mammal interactions are the subject of some debate and ongoing research. They were originally thought to be an example of [[mutualism]], but recent evidence suggests that oxpeckers may be parasites instead. < ref name= " parasite " > {{Cite journal|last=Weeks|first=P.|date=2000-03-01|title=Red-billed oxpeckers: vampires or tickbirds?|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/beheco/11.2.154|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=11|issue=2|pages=154–160|doi=10.1093/beheco/11.2.154}} < /ref >  Oxpeckers do eat ticks, but often the ticks that have already fed on the [[ungulate]] host and there has been no proven statistically significant link between oxpecker presence and reduced ectoparasite load . < ref name= " parasite " / >  However one study of impalas found that impalas which were used by oxpeckers spent less time [[grooming]] themselves suggesting they had fewer parasites. Oxpeckers have been seen opening new wounds and worsening existing ones in order to drink the blood of their perches . < ref name= " zoo " / >  Oxpeckers also feed on the earwax  and dandruffs of mammals, although less is known about the benefits of this to the mammal, it is suspected that this is also a parasitic behaviour. < ref name= " parasite " / >  Some oxpecker hosts are intolerant of their presence. < ref name= " zoo " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1002/zoo.20013|last=McElligott|first=A.G.|author2=Maggini, I.|author3=Hunziker, L.|author4=Konig, B.|year=2004|title=Interactions Between Red-Billed Oxpeckers and Black Rhinos in Captivity|journal=Zoo Biology|volume=23|issue=4|pages=347–354}} < /ref >  Elephants and some antelope will actively dislodge the oxpeckers when they land.

 ==Oxpeckers as guards== 
 
 The [[Swahili]] language word for oxpecker is  " Askari wa kifaru, "  which means  " the rhino's guard "  in English.  A team of scientists from [[California State University]] and [[Victoria University]] in Australia wondered if oxpeckers really did help guard the rhinos.  They found that the [[black rhinoceros]] listens for the noises the oxpecker makes.  Rhinoceros cannot see well but oxpeckers can.  When an oxpeckers sees a human, it makes a noise.  It does not make this noise at any other time.  The rhinos hear this noise and then either look for the human or run away.  The scientists performed an experiment: A human would slowly walk toward a rhino.  Rhinos without oxpeckers on their backs only noticed the human one out of five times, but rhinos with oxpeckers noticed the human every time and from much further away.  The scientists wondered if bringing flocks of oxpeckers to groups of rhinoceros without them would help the rhinos avoid [[poaching|human hunters]]. < ref name= " Oxpecker " > {{cite news|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/cp-bre040220.php|publisher=Eurekalert|title=Black rhinos eavesdrop on the alarm calls of hitchhiking oxpeckers to avoid humans |date=April 9, 2020|access-date=April 10, 2020|author=Cell Press}} < /ref > < ref name= " OxStudy " > {{cite journal|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982220303535|title=Oxpeckers Help Rhinos Evade Humans|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.015|date=May 18, 2020|journal=Current Biology|access-date=April 10, 2020|author1=Roan D.
