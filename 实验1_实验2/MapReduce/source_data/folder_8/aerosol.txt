 An '''aerosol''' is a [[suspension]] of fine [[solid]] particles or [[liquid]] droplets in a [[gas]]. Examples are [[smoke]], oceanic haze, [[air pollution]], [[smog]] and CS gas. When they say ''aerosol'' most people mean an [[aerosol spray]] can or the spray it makes.  
 
 To differentiate suspensions from true [[solution]]s, the term sol evolvedâ€”originally meant to cover dispersions of tiny (sub-microscopic) particles in a liquid. With studies of dispersions in [[air]], the term aerosol evolved and now embraces both liquid [[drop]]lets, solid particles, and combinations of these.
