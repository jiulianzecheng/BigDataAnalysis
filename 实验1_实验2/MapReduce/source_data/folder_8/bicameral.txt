 A '''bicameral''' system of [[government]] is one where there are two [[legislative]] or [[parliament]]ary chambers. < ref name=Farlex > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bicameral |title=bicameral |publisher=The Free Dictionary/Farlex |access-date=6 March 2016}} < /ref >  The word comes from the [[Latin]]  " bi "  (meaning two) and  " camera "  (meaning chamber). < ref name=Farlex/ >  In most cases they have different numbers of members. The smaller legislature is often called the  " upper house "  or  " [[senate]] "  and the larger is called the  " lower house " , and sometimes also called by another name such as  " assembly "  or  " commons " . For legislation to be passed, bicameral legislatures normally need a [[majority]] of members of both chambers to vote for the legislation. 
 
 Experts sometimes point out that often [[deadlock]]s occur in this kind of system. < ref name=Law > {{cite web |url=http://constitution.laws.com/bicameral-legislature |title=Your Guide to The Bicameral Legislature |publisher=Law.com |access-date=6 March 2016}} < /ref >  This can make it harder to pass [[law]]s. < ref name=Law/ >  But others point out the [[checks and balances]] this system maintains. < ref name=Law/ >  This prevents laws from being passed that favor a certain [[political faction]], the [[government]] or group of people. < ref name=Law/ >
