 '''Goombas''' are an enemy in the [[Mario (series)|Mario series]]. They are short brown [[mushroom]] shaped enemies that are easily killed by jumping on their head. They appear in almost every Mario game. 
 
 ==Concept and creation== 
 Goombas first appeared in the video game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', and was the last enemy put into the game. People stated that the Koopa Troopa was too hard an enemy, so the designers decided to introduce the Goomba as a basic enemy. When they decided to do this, however, they had very little space left in the game. They used a single picture twice to make people think the Goombas are walking, rotating it back and forth, causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the motion the appearance of a trot. The Goomba's resemblance to the Super Mushroom forced designers to change what the Super Mushroom does and what it looks like. They used the Goomba's ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the Super Mushroom. The Goombas are designed after a kind of mushroom called [[Shiitake mushroom|shiitake]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

 The ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' film version of the Goomba has received negative reception. IGN editor Jesse Schedeen called Bowser and his Goombas the most screwed up part of the film, commenting that it would be difficult to create a live action version of the Goomba that deviates from the original version more than this. < ref > {{cite web |title=Videogame Heroes Report Card |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/922/922223p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2008-10-22 |archive-date=2009-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113140740/http://stars.ign.com/articles/922/922223p1.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  An [[Entertainment Weekly]] article called the design creepy, stating that its  " foam-latex skin had to be baked for five hours at 200 degrees to achieve that lovely reptilian effect.

The Mario [[toy]] set featured Mario in his Raccoon form, [[Luigi]], a Koopa Paratroopa, and a Goomba.{{fact|date=December 2009}} A plush Goomba that plays the Goomba  " defeat "  noise as well as the Game Over tune at certain points was released. < ref > {{cite web |title=Plush Mario Sound Bops get updated |url=http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080319/plush-mario-sound-bops-get-updated |publisher=Coolest Gadgets |accessdate=2009-12-24 |archive-date=2009-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630191712/http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080319/plush-mario-sound-bops-get-updated/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
