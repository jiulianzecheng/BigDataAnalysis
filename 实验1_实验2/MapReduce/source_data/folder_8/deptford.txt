'''Deptford''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|t|f|ər|d}} {{Respell|DET|fərd}}) is a district of south-east [[London]], England, within the [[London Borough of Lewisham]]. From the middle of the 16th century to the late [[19th century]], Deptford was home to [[Deptford Dockyard]] which was the first [[Royal Navy]] dockyard. The area declined as the Royal Navy moved out and commercial docks closed. The last dock, [[Convoys Wharf]], closed in the year [[2000]].
