 '''''Frankenchrist''''' is the third [[studio album]] by [[Americans|American]] [[hardcore punk]] band, [[Dead Kennedys]]. ''Frankenchrist'' was released in October 1985. 
 
 The album caused controversy because of a poster that was inserted in the original record sleeve. The poster called ''Landscape #XX'', or Penis Landscape [[H. R. Giger]], was a painting that showed rows of [[penis]]es and [[vulva]]e. Lead singer Jello Biafra's record label Alternative Tentacles was almost driven to bankruptcy and Biafra was brought to trial for distributing harmful matter to minors but was not convicted. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Wishnia |first1=Steven |title=Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment |year= |publisher=The Nation |isbn= |pages=}} < /ref >  [[Allmusic]] rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/frankenchrist-mw0000650058|accessdate=2014-03-12|title=Dead Kennedys - Frankenchrist|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}} < /ref >
