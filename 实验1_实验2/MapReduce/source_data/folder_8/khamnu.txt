 Khamnu worked very hard to raise her younger brother. So she is often compared to [[:en:Kunti|Kunti]] of the [[Mahabharata]]. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 == Early life == 
 Khamnu's parents died.  After this, life became very difficult for her and her brother Khuman Khamba.  Khuman Khamba was still a baby.  Khamnu went from place to place to get help to work in [[Ancient Moirang|Moirang]]. She husked paddy for some people. The women who owned the paddy paid her by breastfeeding the infant Khamba. Like this, she worked and got help until she and her brother were both adults. To earn a living, Khamnu sold wood in a market of [[Ancient Moirang|Moirang]]. One day, Princess [[Moirang Thoibi|Thoibi]] visited the marketplace. She noticed Khamnu, a strange new face. She asked Khamnu many things. She even gave Khamnu food and jewelry. Khamnu and Thoibi met once more. Thoibi asked Khamnu to come with her when she went fishing in [[Loktak lake]]. So Khamnu accompanied the princess in sporting on the lake. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/n181/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 Once Princess Thoibi visited Khamnu's house. Meanwhile, Khamnu went out to the market to bring some fruits. At Khamnu's absence, Thoibi presented Khamba gifts. The two bound themselves by an oath before the God [[Khuman Pokpa]]. They drank the water in which the golden bracelet was dipped. They vowed to be lovers forever. After this oath, Thoibi addressed Khamnu as  " sister " . < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/137/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T. C.

 At this, Minister Nongthonba remembered the marriage engagement between Feiroijamba, his firstborn son, and Khamnu. They went to Khamnu. Khamnu hid herself in the women's chamber. They cried tears and were very sad. At this, Khamnu came out. She received the gifts from them. From this time onwards, Khamnu and her brother Khamba were always supported by Minister Nongthonba, Minister Thonglen and Feiroijamba in every way of life. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/meitheis01hods/page/138/mode/2up|title=The Meitheis|last=Hodson|first=T.
