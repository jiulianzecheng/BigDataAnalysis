 == History == 
 
 === Norman conquest of England === 
 
 Ponthieu played a small role in the events that led up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066. [[Harold Godwinson]] of England was blown ashore at Ponthieu in 1064. < ref name= " David Crouch 2007 p. 82 " > David Crouch, ''The Normans: The History of a Dynasty'' (London: Hambledon Continuum Press, 2007), p. 82 < /ref >  He was taken [[:wikt:captive|captive]] by the men of [[Guy I of Ponthieu|Guy I]] and held for [[ransom]] at the castle of Beaurain. Thinking Harold might be useful to him [[William I of England|William II, Duke of Normandy]], secured his [[:wikt:release|release]]. < ref name= " David Crouch 2007 p. 82 " / >  William escorted him to [[Rouen]] and gave him many gifts.  
 william then had Harold take 'many [[:wikt:oaths|oaths]]' to support his claim to the English [[:wikt:throne|throne]] and to become William's [[vassal]]. < ref name=Neveux131 > François Neveux, ''A Brief History of the Normans'', trans. Howard Curtis (London: Constable  &  Robbinson, Ltd, 2008), p.131 < /ref >  But a year after Harold's return to England when king [[Edward the Confessor]] died, Harold quickly forgot his oaths and took the [[:wikt:crown|crown]] for himself. < ref name=Neveux131/ >  That same year Harold was killed at [[Battle of Hastings]] and William became [[King of England]]. < ref > François Neveux, ''A Brief History of the Normans'', trans.

 In 1067 the chaplain of [[Matilda of Flanders]], [[Guy, Bishop of Amiens]], composed [[Carmen de Hastingae Proelio]], a [[Latin]] poem on the [[battle of Hastings]]. 
 
 In 1150 the Count of Ponthieu built a fortress for himself at Crotoy, a strategic point on the mouth of the river Somme. 
 
 === The Hundred Years' War === 
 
 During the [[Hundred Years' War]], Ponthieu [[:en:wikt:changed hands|changed hands]] a number of times.  The [[England|English]] claimed [[:wikt:control|control]] of it from 1279–1369 and again until 1435. During English control of Ponthieu, Abbeville was used as the [[:wikt:capital|capital]]. 
 
 In late August 1346 [[Edward III of England]] reached the region of Ponthieu.  While he was there rebuilt the fortress at Crotoy. < ref > Andrew Ayton; Philip Preston, ''The Battle of Crécy, 1346'' (Woodbridge, Suffolk: The Boydell Press, 2005), p. 104 < /ref >   He forced a passage of the Somme at the ford of [[Battle of Blanchetaque|Blanchetaque]].  The army led by [[Philip VI of France]] caught up with him at nearby [[Crécy-en-Ponthieu]], leading to the famous [[Battle of Crécy]]. < ref > C. T. Allmand, ''The Hundred Years War: England and France at War C.1300-c.1450'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988). p. 15 < /ref > 
 
 In 1360, the [[Treaty of Bretigny]] between King [[John II of France]] and [[Edward III of England]] gave control of Ponthieu (along with [[Gascony]] and [[Calais]]) over to the English, in exchange for Edward relinquishing his claim to the French throne.  Edward took the land but still refused to surrender his claim. 
 
 In April, 1369 [[Charles V of France]] conquered Ponthieu. A month later he declared war on England.  As a result, Edward publicly reassumed the title 'King of France' in June. 
 
 In 1372 an English army under the leadership of [[Robert Knolles]] invaded Ponthieu. They burned the city of [[Le Crotoy]] before crossing the [[Somme]] at the ford of Blanchetaque. 
 
 In the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)]], [[Charles VII of France]] convinced [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], to break his [[:wikt:alliance|alliance]] with the English. In [[:wikt:exchange|exchange]] he gave him Ponthieu. This marked a turning point that led to the end of England's part in the conflict 40 years later. 
 
 In 1477 Ponthieu was reconquered by King [[Louis XI of France]]. 
 
 In [[World War I]] between 1 July and 18 November 1916 the [[Battle of the Somme]] was fought in Ponthieu. It was one of the most costly [[:wikt:battles|battles]] ever fought with over 1,000,000 men killed or wounded.
