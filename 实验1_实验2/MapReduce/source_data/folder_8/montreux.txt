 == History == 
 [[File:Montreux, Switzerland.JPG|thumb|left|Lake Geneva from Montreux]] 
 The earliest settlement was a Late [[Bronze Age]] village at Baugy. Montreux lies on the northeast shore of Lake Geneva at the fork in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] road from [[Italy]] over the [[Simplon Pass]], where the roads to the Roman capital of [[Aventicum]] and the road into [[Gaul]] through [[Besançon]] separated. This made it an important settlement already in Roman times. 
 
 In the 12th century, [[viticulture]] was introduced to the region, and the sunny slopes of the lake from [[Lavaux]] to Montreux became an important wine-growing region. 
 
 The region was subject to various princes, most notably the princes of [[Savoy]] from the south side of the lake. They unified the territory which comprises the present canton of Vaud and were generally popular sovereigns. 
 
 After the [[Burgundian Wars]] in the 15th century, the Swiss in [[Berne]] occupied the region without resistance, an indication of the weakness of the princes of Savoy. The Reformation made the region around Montreux and [[Vevey]] an attractive haven for [[Huguenots]] from Italy, who brought their artisanal skills and set up workshops and businesses. 
 
 In 1798, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] liberated the region from the Bernese. In the 19th century, the tourist industry became a major commercial outlet, with the grand hotels of Montreux attracting the rich and cultured from Europe and America. 
 
 Starting in the 19th century there were three independent municipalities that shared a central authority. This county council was made up of four deputies from Le Châtelard, two from Les Planches and one from Veytaux. The church, the market hall of La Rouvenaz, the secondary school (the building was from 1872 and 1897) and the slaughter-house (1912) were all owned by the county council. Each municipality had its own taxes and a mayor. In 1962, the municipalities of Le Châtelard and Les Planches merged, while Veytaux remained independent.
