 '''Volterra''' is a [[town]] in the [[Tuscany]] [[regions of Italy|region]] of [[Italy]]. It is in the [[Provinces of Tuscany|province]] of [[Pisa (province)|Pisa]]. Volterra was once one of the 12 cities in [[Etruria]]. In the [[middle ages]] it was an independent city until it was conquered by the [[Florence|Florentines]] and then the [[Medici]]s. It has its own [[cathedral]], and is built on top of an ancient volcanic hill. 
 
 == History == 
 The city was a [[Neolithic]] [[Human settlement|settlement]] and an important [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] center. It became a  " [[municipium]] "  (a type of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city) in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman Age]]. Volterra was attacked and controlled by [[Florence]] many times. When the [[Florentian Republic]] fell in [[1530]], Volterra came under the control of the [[Medici]] family. It later became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. 
 
 The original Etruscan city walls remain in parts, and the remains of the Roman baths, [[aqueduct]] and [[amphitheatre]] (arena). Visitors to Volterra have to leave their cars outside the town walls, in car parks.
