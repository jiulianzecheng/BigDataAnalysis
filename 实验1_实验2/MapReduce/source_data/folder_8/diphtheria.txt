 '''Diphtheria''' ([[Pronunciation|pronounced]]  " diff-THEER-ee-uh " ) is an [[infectious disease]] caused by a [[bacteria|bacterium]] called ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae''. It can be treated by special [[Medication|drugs]], or by [[antibiotics]]. There is a [[vaccine]] which can prevent diphtheria.   In 1942, there were 50,804 diphtheria cases in England and Wales; now there is about one case a year. < ref > {{Cite web|title=A Fresh Shot|url=https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/a-fresh-shot/|access-date=2023-10-20|website=Policy Exchange|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Diphtheria can cause serious problems, like: 
 * [[Inflammation]] of the [[heart]], which can lead to [[death]] 
 * Different forms of [[paralysis]], by poisoning of [[Neuron|nerve cells]] 
 * [[Pneumonia]] 
 * [[Encephalitis]] 
 * Problems with the [[kidney]]s 
 
 == Signs and symptoms == 
 [[Signs and symptoms]] of diphtheria usually begin two to five days after a person gets [[Infection|infected]].  They may include: 
 * A thick, gray [[membrane]] covering the [[throat]] and [[Tonsil|tonsils]] 
 * A [[sore throat]] and a hoarse voice 
 * Swollen [[Gland|glands]] (enlarged [[lymph nodes]]) in the [[Neck (body part)|neck]] 
 * [[Dyspnea|Trouble breathing]], or fast breathing 
 * Nasal discharge 
 * [[Fever]] and chills 
 * Malaise (feeling very tired and not having any energy) 
 In some people, infection with diphtheria-causing bacteria causes only a mild illness.  These people may have no obvious signs or symptoms. Infected people who do not know they have diphtheria are called ''carriers'' of diphtheria, because they can spread the infection without being sick themselves. 
 
 == Cutaneous diphtheria == 
 A second type of diphtheria can affect the skin.  This type of diphtheria is called ''cutaneous diphtheria''.  It causes [[pain]], redness, and swelling on the skin, like other bacterial skin infections. People with cutaneous diphtheria may get [[Ulcer|ulcers]], covered by a gray membrane, on their skin. 
 
 Cutaneous diphtheria is more common in [[Tropical climate|tropical climates]].  However, cutaneous diphtheria also happens in the [[United States]], especially among people with poor [[hygiene]] who live in crowded conditions. 
 
 == Mechanism == 
 Diphtheria [[toxin]] is produced by ''C. diphtheriae''  < u > only < /u >  when infected with a [[bacteriophage]] which integrates the toxin-encoding genetic elements into the bacteria. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Freeman, Victor J | title = Studies on the virulence of bacteriophage-infected strains of ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'' | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-bacteriology_1951-06_61_6/page/675 | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1951 | pages = 675–688 | pmid = 14850426 | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pmc=386063| doi = 10.1128/JB.61.6.675-688.1951 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | author = Freeman VJ, Morse IU | title = Further observations on the change to virulence of bacteriophage-infected avirulent strains of ''Corynebacterium Diphtheriae'' | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1953 | pages = 407–414 | pmid = 14927573 | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pmc=169283| last2 = Morse | doi = 10.1128/JB.63.3.407-414.1952 }} < /ref >
