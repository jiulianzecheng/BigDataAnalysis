 [[Image:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|180px|right|thumb|The world’s first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in1782-83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to measure the [[heat]] generated by [[chemical change]]s.  The calculations were based on [[Joseph Black]]’s discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments started [[thermochemistry]].]]  
 A '''calorimeter''' is a [[tool]] that measures the amount of [[thermal energy]] contained in a substance, or released in a reaction. A commonplace use is to measure [[heat of combustion]].
