 In [[computing]], a '''trackball''' is a [[pointing device|pointing]] [[input device]]. It consists of a [[Sphere|ball]] held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes.  It is like an upside-down [[computer mouse|mouse]] with a ball that sticks out.  The user rolls the ball with the [[thumb]], [[finger]]s or the palm of the [[hand]] to move a [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] and can click one of two buttons (identical to mouse buttons) near the trackball to select desktop objects or position the cursor for text entry.  Currently only three major companies: [[Logitech]], A4Tech and Kensington make many of them.  [[Microsoft]] was once a major producer.  
 
 Large trackballs are sometimes seen on computerized special-purpose workstations, such as the radar consoles in an  [[air traffic control]] room, or sonar equipment on a ship or submarine, or [[computer-aided design]]. [[Potentiometer]] < nowiki/ > s capture the trackball orientation. 
 
 Many notebook and laptop computers in the late 20th century used a small trackball.  It was usually located in front of the keyboard toward the user.  IBM's ThinkPad series of notebook computers use a  " pointing stick " , called a TrackPoint, that is integrated into the middle of the keyboard keys.
