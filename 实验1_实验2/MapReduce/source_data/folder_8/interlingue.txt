 '''Interlingue''' is a [[constructed language]]. It was called ''Occidental'' between 1922 and 1947. [[Edgar de Wahl]], one of the first [[Esperanto|Esperantists]], created it. De Wahl was from the city of [[Tallinn]] in [[Estonia]], which was in the [[Russian Empire]] but later became its own country. He spoke [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[French language|French]] since he was a child < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta, Nr. 41 (4), Juli-August 1927|url=http://dicta.bplaced.net/bibliotheca_occidental/cmg/cmg041.html|access-date=2020-10-06|website=dicta.bplaced.net}} < /ref >  and had natural ability in languages. He is often called ''de Wahl''. 
 
 Interlingue looks a lot like languages in the [[Romance languages|Romance language family]]: French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and so on. < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=90 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 90]: Translation:  " Occidental being a neo-Latin language, the influence of the languages French, Italian and Spanish will probably still be greater than that of the Anglo-Saxons. " < /ref > < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1944 & page=104 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 104]: Translation:  " and what else is Occidental than a simplified Italian, or, to state it more generally, the simplified commonality of all Romance languages? " < /ref > < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1944 & page=116 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 116:] Translation:  " Latin is dead, even though it is still used for a few limited purposes. But the mother language Latin still lives in her daughters, the Romance languages - and Occidental is one of them. " < /ref >  De Wahl made a rule called De Wahl's rule that made changing [[Verb|verbs]] to [[Noun|nouns]] easier and more regular. For example, the change of '''d''' in the word exploder (to explode) to '''s''' (making explo'''s'''ion and explo'''s'''iv) is a regular change when following this rule. 
 
 De Wahl was not happy with Esperanto. He decided to create a language called  " Occidental " . He published it in [[1922]]. In [[1949]] the users of Occidental voted to change the name to ''Interlingue''. 
 
 There were already many types of constructed languages during de Wahl's time. Some of them, like Esperanto and [[Ido]], are called ''schematic'' because they follow their own design even if the words look more artificial. Others, like Latino sine flexione and Idiom Neutral, are called ''naturalistic'' because they try to look like natural languages. The difficulty was that creators had to choose between being regular or looking natural. Louis Couturat, the creator of Ido, wrote the same thing in 1903, < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/histoiredelalang00coutuoft|title=Histoire de la langue universelle|last1=Couturat|first1=Louis|last2=Leau|first2=Léopold|date=1903|publisher=Paris Hachette|others=Robarts - University of Toronto}} < /ref >  and called it a [[paradox]]:  " The international words are not regular, and the regular words are not international. "  The language that de Wahl made had a goal to be a language that was both regular and natural at the same time. 
 
 == History == 
 === How Occidental (Interlingue) started === 
 De Wahl announced his language in the magazine Kosmoglott in 1922, and this is where the Occidental activities can be seen. However, de Wahl started making the language long before this. Between 1906 and 1921 he started experimenting with his own language, and it changed a lot. At the time he called it Auli, or  " auxiliary language "  (auxiliary means helpful). The other nickname for Auli is proto-Occidental (which means  " old Occidental " ). < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & size=45 & page=8|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 8|website=anno.onb.ac.at|access-date=2018-12-18}} < /ref >  When de Wahl announced his language in 1922, it was almost but not quite done. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1925 & page=40 & size=45|title=Kosmoglott, 1925, p.40|quote=Translation:  " I found the most precise sense of  " -atu "  for example no earlier than 1924...maybe with time I will also find the precise sense of  " -il, -esc, -itudo " , etc. " }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1947 & page=15 & size=45|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1947, p. 15|website=anno.onb.ac.at|access-date=2018-12-28}} < /ref >  He actually wanted to wait a bit longer, but there was big news in 1921: the [[League of Nations]] was looking at the idea of an international language. De Wahl had also sent a letter and got a positive reply from the League of Nations in September 1921. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1922 & page=4 & size=45|title=Kosmoglott 001, 1922, p. 4}} < /ref > 
 
 People began using Occidental because it was easy to read and understand, even without grammars and dictionaries. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1927 & size=45 & page=7|title=Kosmoglott, 1925, p.7|website=anno.onb.ac.at|access-date=2018-12-28}} < /ref >   
 
 ''Kosmoglott'' changed its name to ''Cosmoglotta'' in 1927 and began promoting Occidental over other languages. In January of the same year, they moved ''Cosmoglotta's'' office to Vienna in the region of Mauer (now part of Liesing). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta, 1927, p. 1|url=https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1927 & page=7 & size=45}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta A, 1947, p. 17|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1947 & size=45 & page=17}} < /ref >  This helped Occidental have success during this period because the office was now in a central location. Engelbert Pigal from Austria also helped with his article ''Li Ovre de Edgar de Wahl'' (The Work of Edgar de Wahl), which convinced some users of the [[Ido language]] to try Occidental. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  By early 1930, people were using Occidental in [[Germany]], Austria, [[Sweden]], Czechoslovakia, [[Switzerland]], and most recently in [[France]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Helvetia, January 1930|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e1e & datum=1930 & page=9 & size=45|quote= " ...Occ. esset unesimli propagat per Germanes, Austrianes, Svedes, Tchecoslovacos e solmen ante du annus ha penetrat in Francia. " }} < /ref > 
 
 === Vienna period and World War II === 
 When the magazine Cosmoglotta was based in Vienna, the users of the language had enough money for the first time. This was thanks to two people: [[Hanns Hörbiger|Hans Hörbiger]], also from Vienna, and G.A. Moore, from London. The world economy was in a bad state, but with the help of people like Hörbiger and Moore, ''Cosmoglotta'' was able to do well and gained readers. But Hörbiger and Moore both died in 1931, so this period did not last long. After this ''Cosmoglotta'' had to find money from other places: subscriptions, books, magazines, and so on. 
 
 The growing movement began a stronger campaign for the language in the early 1930s in which it promoted Occidental's easy understanding at first sight. They contacted organizations with letters completely in Occidental, and these organizations often understood the letters and sent responses. The Occidentalists also introduced the idea of Occidental being the answer to Europe's  " tower of Babel " . 
 
 The years 1935 to 1939 were even more active. This is when ''Cosmoglotta'' started publishing a second edition. The second edition first had the name ''Cosmoglotta-Informationes'', but was soon called ''Cosmoglotta B.'' Cosmoglotta A was more focused on literature, while Cosmoglotta B had more discussions relating to the movement. Cosmoglotta B had information for example on the language's development, Occidental in the news, and how much money they had.  
 
 Meanwhile, the years before the [[World War II]] led to problems for Occidental and other planned languages. Occidental, Esperanto and others were made illegal in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Their groups were forced to break up, the [[Gestapo]] spied on them, and their educational materials were destroyed. Being illegal in Germany was especially damaging, because Germany had the largest number of Occidentalists.  
 
 World War Two began in 1939, and this stopped the publications of both Cosmoglottas until 1940. This was when Cosmoglotta was most active. One Cosmoglotta A or B was published every month between January 1937 and September 1939 when the war started. Then one edition was published every month from September 1941 to June 1951. During the Second World War, only Switzerland and Sweden were neutral countries. Because of this, only the Occidentalists in these countries could carry on their activities. 
 
 During the war, telegrams were checked by censors before approving them to send. The Occidentalists noticed that their telegrams were being sent, especially between Switzerland and Sweden. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1946, p.8.|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1946 & page=8 & size=45|access-date=2018-12-22|website=anno.onb.ac.at|quote=English translation:  " At the assembly of the Swiss Association for Occidental in Bienne it was noted with satisfaction that despite the war the cooperation at least with the Swedish worldlanguage friends was always able to be maintained, in that the letters and telegrams written in Occidental passed by the censors without problem. " }} < /ref >  This meant that the censors could probably understand it and maybe thought the language was Spanish or Romansch. < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1943 & page=6 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1943, p. 6] < /ref > < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=15 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 15] < /ref >  With this, the Occidentalists in Switzerland and Sweden could communicate with each other sometimes. 
 
 The other centres of Occidental activity in Europe did not continue. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1946 & page=9 & size=45|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1946, p.9|website=anno.onb.ac.at|access-date=2018-12-22}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 119.|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=119 & size=45|access-date=2018-12-22|website=anno.onb.ac.at|quote=English translation:  " When I arrived in Prague after my escape from the concentration of Leitmeritz, I had literally nothing except a ragged prison uniform, the so-called  " pyjama "  of the prison camps...Soon after I arrived in Prague I published an ad to search friends of the international language...

Especially appreciated are those from Mr. Lerond, a teacher in Bréville tra Donville (Manche) and from Mr. René Chabaud, who happily returned safe and sound from a prison camp in Germany. " }} < /ref >  But after the war, those who survived began to get in contact with each other again. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1946, p. 108|url=https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=108 & size=45}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1946. p. 119-120|url=https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=119 & size=45}} < /ref >  Cosmoglotta had subscribers in 58 cities in Switzerland < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1945 & page=24 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1945, p. 24] < /ref >  a few months before the end of World War II in Europe, and Cosmoglotta A started again in 1946. 
 
 === Setting up the language standard === 
 One of these activities was language standardization. De Wahl had created Occidental with some unchangeable features, but believed that it could follow a  " natural evolution " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Kosmoglott, 1922, p. 65|url=https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1922 & page=65 & size=45}} < /ref > 
 
 Orthography was another area in which several possibilities existed: etymologic orthography (adtractiv, obpression), historic orthography (attractiv, oppression), or simplified orthography (atractiv, opression). < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1944 & page=66 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1944, p. 66] < /ref >  Simplified orthography became the standard by 1939. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Dr. Thomas|title=GROSSES MODERNES WÖRTERBUCH INTERLINGUE (OCCIDENTAL) - DEUTSCH|year=2020|location=Berlin|pages=2|quote=Von seiner Entstehung bis zum Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkrieges 1939 wurde die Rechtschreibung der Sprache deutlich vereinfacht. Diese sogenannte „simplificat ortografie“ löste die alte „historic ortografie“ ab.}} < /ref >  Much of the standardization of the language took place in this way through community preference (e.g. both ac < ref > {{Cite web|title=Kosmoglott, 1926, p. 52|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1926 & page=52 & size=45}} < /ref >  and anc were proposed for the word  " also "  but the community quickly settled on anc), but not all. 
 
 As there was a lack of general material destined for the general public, < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta B, 1938, p. 82|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1938 & size=45 & page=71}} < /ref >  much time during World War II was spend creating courses and standardizing the language. In August 1943, as the war was still going on, it was decided to create an academy to officialize the process. < ref name= " :15 " > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0m & datum=1943 & page=85 & size=45 Cosmoglotta B, 1943, p. 85:] English translation:  " Because the president and secretary of the Academy are located in countries in a state of war, the leading Occidentalists of the neutral countries, Switzerland and Sweden, believe it necessary to set up an INTERIM ACADEMY which will function until the other will be able to resume its work. The decisions of this interim academy will be '''conditional''', i.e.: must be validated by the regular Academy after the war, and due to that it will deliver to it all documents justifying its decisions, with detailed reasons. " < /ref >  The Swiss Occidentalist, isolated from the rest of the continent, concentrated on developing educational materials. The standardization efforts were based on actual usage. 
 
 === IALA, Interlingua, and name change to Interlingue === 
 The International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), founded in 1924 < ref > {{Cite book|last=Esterhill|first=Frank J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-pUYFcH2PwC|title=Interlingua Institute: A History|publisher=Interlingua Institute|year=2000|isbn=9780917848025|pages=ix}} < /ref >  to study and decide the best planned language for international communication, was at first viewed with disbelief by the Occidental community. Many of its members, including its co-founder Alice Vanderbilt Morris, were Esperantists. < ref name= " :7 " > {{Cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1948 & page=84 & size=45|title=Cosmoglotta A, 1948, p. 84}} < /ref >  This made many Occidentalists including de Wahl himself < ref name= " :7 "  / >  believed that it had been set up as a pretext to give the impressoin of a  " neutral and professional "  committee that would finally choose Esperanto. Relations soon improved, however, as it became clear that the IALA intended to be as impartial as possible by familiarizing itself with all existing planned languages.  
 
 In 1945, the IALA announced that it planned to create its own language. It showed four possible versions under consideration. They were naturalistic < ref name= " :8 " > {{Cite web|title=Cosmoglotta A, 1948, p. 84|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1948 & page=85 & size=45}} < /ref >  as opposed to schematic. Some Occidentalists were happy that the IALA had decided to create a language almost the same as Occidental. They believed that it supported their argument for a naturalistic auxiliary language.  
 
 The two languages had somewhat different spellings (e.g. ''filosofie'' in Occidental and ''philosophia'' in Interlingua for 'philosophy'), but besides this both languages had 90% the same vocabulary. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://interl.home.amu.edu.pl/interlingvistiko/Barandovska_Latinidaj_planlingvoj.pdf|title=Latinidaj planlingvoj (AIS-kurso, 1 studunuo)|last=Barandovská-Frank|first=Vĕra|quote=Alphonse Matejka konstatis, ke la publikigita vortprovizo de Interlingua en 90% kongruas kun tiu de Interlingue, se oni ne rigardas ortografion (historian kaj simpligitan) kaj uzon de finaj vokaloj.}} < /ref >  However, their structure and word creation systems were very different:  
 * De Wahl's Rule in Occidental had eliminated Latin double stem verbs (verbs such as act: ager, act- or send: mitter, miss-), while Interlingua simply accepted them as an important part of a naturalistic system. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Gode|first=Alexander|title=A grammar of Interlingua: Appendix 1 (Double-Stem Verbs)|url=https://adoneilson.com/int/gi/append/double.html}} < /ref > 
 * Occidental was more influenced by [[Germanic languages]]. 
 * Interlingua also allowed optional irregular verbal conjugations (such as ''so'', ''son'' and ''sia'' < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED_s.html|title=Interlingua-English Dictionary S|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213083124/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED_s.html|archive-date=2007-12-13}} < /ref >  as the first-person singular, third-person plural and subjunctive form of esser, the verb 'to be') that Occidental had never even considered and viewed as incompatible with an easy international auxiliary language. 
 
 All of this happened in a time when Occidental, based in [[Europe]], was still recovering from the war. Besides the economic difficulties that the movement was suffering (not like the well-funded < ref name= " harlow2000 " > Harlow, Don.

 Interlingue-Occidental suffered when [[Interlingua]] was announced in 1951. This was because now it had a competitor in the field of naturalistic planned auxiliary languages. In fact, Ric Berger, one of the most important Occidentalists, stopped supporting Interlingue to support IALA's project. He also tried to convince other Occidentalists to do the same. < ref name= " :4 " > {{Cite web|last=Barandovská-Frank|first=Vĕra|title=Latinidaj planlingvoj (AIS-kurso, 1 studunuo)|url=http://interl.home.amu.edu.pl/interlingvistiko/Barandovska_Latinidaj_planlingvoj.pdf|page=18}} < /ref > 
 
 === Pause and revival ===

 == Grammar == 
 {{Main|Grammar of Interlingue}} 
 
 === Alphabet and pronunciation === 
 Interlingue is written with 26 Latin letters: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[q]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[v]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[z]]. The letters of the alphabet are pronounced as ''a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon'', and ''zet''. < ref name=pbgrammar > [http://interlingue.pbworks.com/w/page/4887780/Grammatica%20de%20Interlingue%20%28English%29#alfabet Grammatica de Interlingue in English], F. Haas 1956. Read 31 October 2013. < /ref >  Accents are written on the five [[Vowel|vowels]] to indicate irregular stress, with the acute accent (á é í ó ú) preferred, but others (è, ê, etc.) permitted. < ref name= " pbgrammar "  / > 
 
 The vowels are usually pronounced as follows: < ref name= " pbgrammar "  / > 
 * '''a''' as English f'''a'''ther. 
 * '''e''' open or closed, as  English b'''e'''d and y'''e'''s. 
 * '''i''' as English mach'''i'''ne. 
 * '''o''' open or closed as in English d'''oo'''r, h'''o'''t. 
 * '''u''' as English r'''u'''le, p'''u'''ll. 
 * '''y''' is a consonant after a vowel or beginning a word before a vowel, otherwise is pronounced as '''i'''. 
 
 The [[Consonant|consonants]] are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions: 
 *'''c''' when before e and i = [ts]: ''cive'', ''helice'' 
 *'''g''' when before e and i = English s in pleasure: ''plage, giraffe''; but elsewhere c and g are as in can, go 
 *'''ss''' = [s] as in ''pass'' 
 *'''s''' between vowels = [z]: ''rose, positiv'' 
 *'''z''' = [dz] 
 *'''zz''' = [ts] 
 *'''ch''' = [ʃ], English sh: ''chambre'' 
 *'''j''' = [ʒ], English s in pleasure 
 *'''t''' as [t], except when followed by ia, io, iu, or ie and not preceded by an s. Thus the t in ''nation'' is pronounced [ts] but in ''bastion'' as [t]. 
 
 === Article === 
 Like English, Interlingue has a [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] and an [[Article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]]. The definite article (the) is ''li'', and the indefinite (a, an) is ''un''. Plural of a [[noun]] is made by adding ''-s'' after a vowel, or ''-es'' after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libre'''s''', un angul, tri angul'''es''', li tric, li tric'''s''', li plug, li plug'''s''', li album, pluri album'''s''', li tram, du tram'''s'''. 
 
 ===Personal pronouns=== 
 Interlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form ([[Nominative case|nominative]]), and the other for the object form ([[Accusative case|accusative]] or [[Dative case|dative]]).

 Grammatical endings are used, but less than in [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido language|Ido]]. Esperanto and Ido mark [[parts of speech]] with obligatory endings. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Sixteen Rules of Esperanto Grammar|url=http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/rules.html#nouns|quote=NOUNS have the ending -o. To form the plural, add the ending -j...ADJECTIVES end in -a.}} < /ref >  Only a few parts of speech (such as verb infinitives) in Interlingue have entirely obligatory endings, while many others either have endings the usage of which is optional and sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are: 
 
 *'''ar, er, ir''': verb infinitive. f'''ar''' (to do), poss'''er''' (be able), scr'''ir''' (to write) 
 *'''e''': the general noun ending used obligatorily to differentiate nouns from other parts or speech or for reasons of pronunciation. Examples of obligatory -e endings: capital'''e''' (capital, noun) vs. capital (capital, adjective), contenet'''e''' (content) vs, contenet (contained), sud (south, adjective) vs. sud'''e''' (south as an independent noun, as in the north and the south). Optional -e endings: can or can'''e''' (dog), Pentecost or Pentecost'''e''' (Pentecost). 
 *'''i''': the general adjectival ending, similar to -e in usage. Examples of obligatory -i endings: pigr'''i''' (lazy) and acr'''i''' (sharp) to enable pronunciation, verd'''i''' (green, adjective) to distinguish from verd'''e''' (green, noun). Examples of optional -i endings: etern vs. etern'''i''' (eternal), imens vs. imens'''i''' (immense). 
 *'''a''': nouns that end in '''e''' formed from an '''-ar''' verb are often written with the '''-a''' ending if one wishes to emphasize the verbal (active) aspect. A me veni un pens'''a''' (a thought occurs to me) vs. Pens'''e'''s e paroles (thoughts and words). The '''a''' ending also makes nouns feminine: angles'''e''' (English person), angles'''o''' (Englishman), angles'''a''' (English woman). This does not apply to nouns that on their own indicate the gender (patre, matre). 
 *'''o''': indicates the masculine gender in the same way '''a''' indicates the feminine. 
 
 === Verbs === 
 Verbs in Interlingue have three endings: -'''ar''', -'''er''', and -'''ir'''. Conjugation is performed with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb '''esser''' (to be) is exceptional in being written '''es''' in the present  tense, though the '''esse''' form is seen in the imperative.

 === Adverbs === 
 Interlingue has '''primary adverbs''' and '''derived adverbs'''. Primary adverbs are adverbs without special endings: ''tre'' (very), ''sempre'' (always), etc. < ref name= " pbgrammar "  / > 
 
 Derived adverbs are adverbs made by putting -'''men''' at the end of an adjective ('''rapid''' = quick, '''rapidmen''' = quickly). The ending may be omitted when the meaning is clear: < ref name= " pbgrammar "  / > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?aid=e0g & datum=1927 & page=56 & size=45|title=Cosmoglotta A, 1927, p. 50}} < /ref >  '''tu deve far it rapid(men)''' = you must do it quick(ly). 
 
 == Literature == 
 The main literary texts in Occidental appeared in ''Cosmoglotta''. There were also some works, both original and translated, published in Interlingue. Other texts appeared in the magazine Helvetia but these were less common. ''Micri chrestomathie'' < ref > {{Cite book|title=Micri Chrestomathie|oclc=997463987}} < /ref >  is an example of a translated work, featuring a compilation of texts by Jaroslav Podobský, H. Pášma and Jan Kajš published in 1933.
