 == Origin == 
 When [[George Lucas]] was developing [[fictional character]]s for ''Star Wars'', he named Chewbacca after his [[dog]], Chewbacca. < ref name=NashNYT > {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/26/movies/the-names-came-from-earth.html |title=The Names Came From Earth |author=Eric P. Nash |date=26 January 1997 |website= |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=20 November 2015}} < /ref >  The name  " Wookiee "  came from an [[Wikt:ad libitum|ad lib]] in Lucas's first [[feature movie]], ''[[THX 1138]]''. The line was  " I think I ran over a Wookiee back there. " < ref name=NashNYT/ > 
 
 ==Features== 
 On Kashyyyk wookiees build their [[house]]s in [[mile]]-high [[tree]]s. < ref name=Cavelos52 > Jeanne Cavelos, ''The Science of Star Wars: An Astrophysicist's Independent Examination of...'' (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999), p. 52 < /ref >  They have long [[arm]]s and [[leg]]s so they can climb the trees. Chewbacca is over seven feet tall and over 200 years old. < ref name=Cavelos52/ >  By nature they are [[wikt:gentle|gentle]] and [[intelligent]] [[creature]]s. < ref name=LFL > {{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/wookiee |title=Wookiee |author= |website= |publisher=Lucasfilm Ltd |accessdate=20 November 2015}} < /ref >  When [[anger]]ed they can pull a man's [[arm]]s out of their [[Wikt:socket|socket]]s. Wookiees have a great sense of [[Olfaction|smell]]. They are fully covered with a thick coat of [[hair]]. Wookiees prize [[loyalty]] and [[Wikt:bravery|bravery]] above all else. < ref name=LFL/ >   
 
 == Language == 
 The Wookiee [[language]] is [[Shyriiwook]]. Wookiees are capable of understanding [[English language|English]] but cannot speak it. < ref name=Cavelos52/ >  In the original Star Wars [[trilogy]] Chewbacca showed he could understand humans. His human partner, [[Han Solo]], also shows knowledge of Shyriiwook. In the [[Star Wars expanded universe]] [[book]]s, Chewbacca builds a [[wikt:miniature|miniature]] [[translator]] [[Android (robot)|droid]] ( " Em Teedee " ) for his [[nephew]] [[Young Jedi Knights|Lowbacca]]. When Lowbacca begins training as a [[Jedi]] the droid helped him [[communicate]] with his fellow [[student]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=817 |title=Lowbacca |author= |website= |publisher=The Comic Book Database |accessdate=20 November 2015 |archive-date=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702212735/http://www.comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=817 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
