 '''''Eudimorphodon''''' is a recently discovered [[pterosaur]], and comes from [[shale]] laid down [[Upper Triassic]] [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] in [[Italy]]. 
 
 A nearly complete skeleton was found in 1973. This showed it was a member of the long-tailed sub-order of pterosaurs, the [[Rhamphorhynchoidea]]. ''Eudimorphodon'' was small in size, with 110 teeth packed into a jaw only 6 cms long. Teeth at the front are fangs, further back the teeth are small and multipointed, many with five cusps. This is [[wikt:unique|unique]] among pterosaurs, whose teeth are usually of a simple [[cone|conical]] form. < ref > Wellnhofer P. 1991. ''The illustrated encyclopedia of pterosaurs''.

 [[Stomach]] contents showed it had eaten a small fish, ''Parapholidophorus''. The top and bottom teeth of ''Eudimorphodon'' came into direct contact with each other when the jaws were closed, especially at the back of the jaw. The teeth were multi-cusped, and tooth wear shows that ''Eudimorphodon'' was able to crush or chew its food to some degree. Wear along the sides of these teeth suggests that ''Eudimorphodon'' also fed on hard-shelled [[invertebrate]]s. 
 
 Juvenile ''Eudimorphodon'' had somewhat different and fewer teeth, and may have eaten [[insect]]s. 
 
 An unsolved puzzle is the flexibility of the tail, which lacks the very long stiffening [[vertebra]]l extensions other long-tailed pterosaurs have. This flexibility is a [[basal]] [[Trait (biology)|trait]]; its functional significance in this [[genus]] is unknown. However, it is known that the stiffened tail of ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]''-like pterosaurs is a device which adds [[wikt:stability|stability]] to their [[flight]]. Without this stability, the animal would be more [[wikt:manoeuvre|manoeuvrable]], but their flight would need more control by the [[brain]].
