 }} 
 '''Aspirin''' (acetylsalicylic acid) is a drug. It is most commonly used as a pain killer, or to reduce [[fever]] or [[inflammation]].  It also has an [[Antiplatelet drug|anti-platelet]] effect - it reduces the number of [[platelet]]s in the [[blood]] which reduces blood clotting- in that function it is used to prevent [[heart attack]]s.  Aspirin is one of the most-used medical drugs in the world. 
 
 There are some possible side-effects to this drug. For example, large amounts can damage the [[kidney]]s. Children taking aspirin can develop [[Reye's syndrome]] which causes the liver to become fatty and not work properly and also the brain to become enlarged. Reyes syndrome can be fatal, but most children survive it with treatment. 
 
 People with lung, kidney disease, [[gout]], [[hyperuricemia]] (high amounts of [[uric acid]] in the blood), [[hemophilia]] (a blood clotting disorder), [[diabetes]] or high blood pressure should not take aspirin except on the advice of a qualified medical professional. Nor should people who are allergic to it, to [[ibuprofen]] or to [[Naproxen Sodium|naproxen]]. People with [[asthma]] where attacks are brought about by aspirin should avoid using any [[NSAID|anti-inflammatory]] drugs based on it. 
 
 Aspirin was invented in [[Germany]] in 1897. [[Bayer]] has a [[trademark]] on the brand name  " aspirin "  in 80 countries. But in other countries,  " aspirin "  is the common name for the drug.
