 A '''decomposer''' is an [[organism]] that breaks down long chain [[polymer]]s from dead organisms into smaller [[molecules]]. < ref > They may do the same job on living organisms, in which case other terms are used to describe them. < /ref >  Decomposers are [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. What they do is use the parts and energy to build up their own materials, which are also [[organic]].  
 
 Decomposers are [[heterotroph]]s. This means they use [[organic|organic substrates]] to get their [[energy]], [[carbon]] and [[nutrients]] for [[growth]] and [[development]].    
 
 Decomposers break down [[cells]] of other organisms using [[biochemical]] reactions without need for internal [[digestion]]. < ref > C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Trophic_level?topic=58074 ''Trophic level''. Eds. M.McGinley  &  C.J.cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC] < /ref >  This is different from [[detritivore]]s, which actually digest dead organic matter. 
 
 [[Decomposition]] also involves [[abiotic]] decomposition. This is breakdown by [[chemical]] processes, such as [[hydrolysis]], or physical processes, such as heat. This turns organic material into [[inorganic]] material, and so returns [[nutrients]] to the [[environment]].
