The term '''Chandravanshi''' refers to a person belonging to Lunar dynasty of ancient India. The Chandravanshi clan is also an ancient [[Kshatriya]] clan of India. They are said to be descendants from the Moon (Chandra). The Hindu God Krishna is believed to be born in the [[Yadav|Yaduvansha]] branch of the Lunar dynasty. 
 
 According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururava was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururava's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas. 
 
 According to the [[Mahabharata]], the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururava who became the first Chandravanshi ruler of the world. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas. 
 
 In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of [[Arjuna]] away from war and the reprimand of his mentor [[Krishna]]. Krishna reminds Arjuna that [[Dharma]] stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for both the Kshatriya houses. 
 
 By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadu's lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwaraka sees the destruction of the entire Yadu's lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna  &  later on becomes the King of [[Mathura]]. 
 
 As the only surviving grandson of Krishna, all branches claiming descent from Krishna (Yaduvanshi Ahirs, Nandvanshi Ahirs  &  Gwalvanshi Ahirs) descended from him.
