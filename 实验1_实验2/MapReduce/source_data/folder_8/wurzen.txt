 '''Wurzen''' is a town on the banks of the river [[Mulde]] in north-western [[Saxony]], [[Germany]], about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} east of the city of [[Leipzig]]. 
 
 One of its claims to fame is the fact that in 1768, the famous German author Goethe traveled through Wurzen and had to wait a long time for the ferry over the Mulde River. While waiting for the boat, he was doing some thinking and later wrote a part of Faust. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Wurzen - Colorful Town With Culture, Architecture, History, Etc.|url=https://www.mygermancity.com/wurzen|access-date=2022-08-05|language=en-US}} < /ref >
