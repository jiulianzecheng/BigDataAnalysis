 '''''Thespesius''''', or '''''Thespecius''''', is an extinct [[hadrosaur]] described by Joseph Leidy in 1876. 
 
 ==History of ''Thespesius''== 
 ''Thespecius'' was discovered in [[Montana]] in 1855. Known fossils include [[vertebra]]e and [[toe]] bones ([[phalanx]]).  
 
 The name ''Thespesius'' means wondrous one. Leidy avoided using the suffix  " saurus "  in the genus name because Vandiveer Hayden had claimed the bones came from a layer from the [[Miocene]] so there was a chance that the animal would turn out to be a [[mammal]], though Leidy himself was convinced it was a dinosaurian. ''Thespesius'' turned out to be a dinosaur. The specific name ''occidentalis'' means  " western "  in Latin.
