 == Format == 
 Each series is broadcast on five nights a week for eight weeks. During the first six weeks, the first four episodes of each week are heats and the fifth episode is a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat and the winner becomes a quarter-finalist. At the end of each week, the four quarter-finalists compete and a semi-finalist is chosen. After six weeks, the six semi-finalists compete in the final two weeks.  
 
 The judges decide who leaves and who stays in the show. The current UK judges are [[Gregg Wallace]] and [[John Torode]]. They are sometimes joined by a guest judge.
