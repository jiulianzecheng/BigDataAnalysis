'''Yatton''' is a large [[village]] with 9,000 people in the [[county]] of [[Somerset]] in [[England]]. [[Archaeology]] in the area has found a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[villa]] (country-house) belonging to some rich person who lived here in the late [[3rd century]], judging from the coins. Records show the land was part of the [[manor]] of John the Dane before the [[Norman Conquest]], and Giso, [[bishop]] of Wells afterward.
