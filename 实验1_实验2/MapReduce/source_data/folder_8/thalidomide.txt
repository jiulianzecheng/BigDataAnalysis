 '''Thalidomide''' is a [[drug]]. It was used as a [[sedative]]. It also had uses for other illnesses.  
 
 It was mainly prescribed to [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women in the 1950s and 1960s, to help with sleep, until it was found to be a [[teratogen]] (that is: birth deformity causing substance). The drug can cause [[birth defect]]s in [[rat]]s, [[primate]]s and [[human]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://drugsafetysite.com/thalidomide|title=Thalidomide: Drug safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding|access-date=2007-10-01|archive-date=2013-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205055957/http://drugsafetysite.com/thalidomide/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Before the drug was released, not enough tests were done. < ref > A review of ''The Thalidomide Catastrophe'' finds  " The manufacturer's claim that they had no warning that its wonder drug produced irreversible nerve damage in those who took it... let alone birth defects, is laid to rest " .

 About 10,000 children were born with deformities, between 1956, and 1962. These could be directly linked to the fact that their mothers had taken the drug during their pregnancy. < ref name =Bren >  {{cite news | first =Linda | last =Bren | author = | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer | publisher =US [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =2001 | accessdate =2006-09-21 }} < /ref >  After this discovery, more rigorous tests were required in the United States, before a drug can be said to be safe to take during pregnancy. < ref name =Burkholz > {{cite news | first =Herbert | last =Burkholz | title =Giving Thalidomide a Second Chance | url =http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1997/697_thal.html | format = | work =FDA Consumer | publisher =US [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =1997 | accessdate =2006-09-21 | archive-date =2009-05-13 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090513023028/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1997/697_thal.html | url-status =dead }} < /ref >  Other countries made similar laws. Thalidomide was not used as a drug for decades.  
 
 Researchers continued to look for ways to use the drug. They discovered that it had good effects on certain types of skin diseases, associated with [[leprosy]]. Currently, studies are being done to see how this drug could help with [[cancer]] treatment, as well as some other, less-known diseases. It has been used in [[Multiple myeloma]] treatment with success. < ref name=' " everyday health " ' > {{cite web|title=Understanding Thalidomide in Multiple Myeloma Treatment|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/multiple-myeloma/thalidomide-therapy.aspx|publisher=Everyday Health website|accessdate=2 June 2013|author=Chris Iliades, MD and Niya Jones, MD, MPH|date= 2009}} < /ref >
