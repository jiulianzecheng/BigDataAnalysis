 '''Nefertem''' was a [[deity]] honored by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians. According to a [[creation myth]], he was originally a [[lotus]] flower at the time of creation. He was worshipped as a god of [[healing]] and [[beauty]]. Since the blue lotus is a flower and a symbol of rebirth, Nefertem is often compared to it. 
 
 His father is [[Ptah]] and his mother is [[Sekhmet]]. They are all worshiped evenly.
