'''Biphobia''' is the fear of or bad treatment of [[bisexual]] people. Biphobia is different from [[homophobia]]. Members of the LGBTQIA+ community can be biphobic as well as cisgender heterosexual people can be biphobic. Bisexual people may feel like their [[sexual orientation]] is less real than that of a monosexual (person who is attracted to one gender). This is internalized biphobia. 
 
 ==Stereotypes== 
 A biphobic [[stereotype]] is that bisexual people have more sex than monosexual people. Some people associate bisexuality with [[polyamory]]. Bisexual women may be called [[Nymphomania|nymphomaniacs]]. Another belief is that bisexuality does not exist. Some people think that bisexual people are heterosexual or homosexual people who are confused. 
 
 ==Discrimination== 
 In May 2013 the results of the European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey were released. They found that bisexual people are discriminated against at work more than [[gay men]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/09/16/unison-set-to-challenge-workplace-biphobia-by-launching-new-fact-sheet-for-bi-visibility-day/|title=UNISON set to challenge workplace biphobia by launching new fact sheet for Bi Visibility Day - PinkNews Â· PinkNews|website=www.pinknews.co.uk}} < /ref >
