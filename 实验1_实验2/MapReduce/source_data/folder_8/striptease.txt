 '''Striptease''' is an [[entertainment]], by females usually, before an [[audience]]. It is often included in the theatre form called [[burlesque]]. With music and dance, the stripper gradually removes her clothing. It is a very ancient dance form, and occurs in many societies. 
 
 Stripping is done in a teasing manner, but without being obscene (for example, by delaying to take an item off). While hiding certain parts of the body with hands or pieces of clothing, stripper dances around. Sometimes, plays are arranged, the strippers are disguised as Arabic dancers, [[Salome]], [[Lolita]] or other well-known people. The spectator sometimes identifies with the stripper. Erotic [[dream]]s and [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] [[fantasy|fantasies]] may be projected into the striptease.

 === Salome === 
 The [[Sumer]]ians had a [[myth]] of the goddess Inanna descending into the Underworld. At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. When she returned, [[fecundity]] abounded.  
 
 [[Salome]]'s dance for [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]] is referred to in the [[New Testament]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|14:6|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse||Mark|6:21-22|NIV}}). However, the first mention of her removing seven veils is in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play of ''Salome'' in 1893. Some have claimed as the origin of modern striptease. < ref > Toni Bentley 2002. ''Sisters of Salome'': 31 < /ref >  After Wilde's play and [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[opera]] ''Salome'', first performed in 1905  the [[erotic]] 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. A famous early practitioner was [[Maud Allan]] who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].

 In ancient Greece, the lawgiver [[Solon]] established several classes of [[prostitute]]s in the late 6th century BC. Among these were the ''[[auletrides]]'': female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. < ref name= " Zaplin 1998 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNM_xibHGIsC & dq=Solon+greece+auletrides & pg=PA351|title=Female offenders: critical perspectives and effective interventions  |year=1998 |publisher=Jones  &  Bartlett |isbn= 978-0-8342-0895-7 |last1=Zaplin |first1=Ruth |page=351 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Jeffreys 2009 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9U7Eqp8NigC & dq=uk+strip+club+revenues & pg=PA90|title=The industrial vagina: the political economy of the global sex trade  |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor  &  Francis |isbn= 978-0-415-41233-9 |last1=Jeffreys |first1=Sheila |pages=86–106 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Bassermann 1968 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQiLAAAAIAAJ & q=auletrides|title=The oldest profession: a history of prostitution  |year=1968 |publisher=Stein and Day |isbn= 0-450-00234-9 |last1=Baasermann |first1=Lugo |pages=7–9 }} < /ref >  In [[ancient Rome]], dance featuring stripping was part of the Floralia, an April festival. < ref > As described by [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 4.133ff.; Juvenal, ''Satire'' 6.250–251; Lactantius, ''Divine Institutes'' 20.6; Phyllis Culham 2004.

 Empress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor [[Justinian]] is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a [[courtesan]] and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed  " as far as the laws of the day allowed " . She was famous for her striptease performance of  " [[Leda]] and the Swan " . < ref name= " Evans 2003 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8T9TJwcs_20C & q=striptease & pg=PA15|title=The Empress Theodora: Partner of Justinian |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn= 978-0-292-70270-7 |last1=Evans |first1=James Allan|page=15 }} < /ref >  From these accounts, it appears that the practice was not exceptional or new. It was, however, actively opposed by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Church]], which got statutes banning it in the following century. The degree to which these statutes were enforced is open to question. No practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European [[Middle Ages]].

 [[File:Mata Hari 15.jpg|thumb|267px|Mata Hari. The most celebrated segment of her stage act was the progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jewelled [[Brassiere|bra]] and some ornaments over her arms and head]] 
 
 In the 1880s and 1890s, [[Paris, France|Parisian]] shows such as the [[Moulin Rouge]] and [[Folies Bergère]] had attractive scantily-clad women dancing and ''[[tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' (static poses). Acts in the 1890s had a woman slowly removed clothes in a vain search for a [[flea]] crawling on her body. The ''People's Almanac'' credits this as the origin of modern striptease. 
 
 Starting in 1905, [[Mata Hari]] entered the scene. On the invitation of Emile Guimet she danced before a carefully chosen audience. The scene at the end of the show, where she was [[nakedness|naked]] was a sensation. Similar performances, at the requests of Baron von Rothschild, Cécile Sorel, Gaston Menier and Natalie Clifford Barney followed. Mata Hari had never learned how to dance, and had never studied Indian and oriental dancing. Her dances were a product of her imagination. In 1917, Mata Hari was charged with [[espionage]] and sentenced to death. She was shot, on 15 October 1917, in [[Vincennes]], near Paris.  
 
 Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called [[Germaine Aymos]] who entered dressed only in three very small shells. In the 1930s the famous [[Josephine Baker]] danced semi-nude in the ''danse sauvage'' at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the [[Tabarin]]. These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. By the 1960s  " fully nude "  shows were provided at such places as [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Le Crazy Horse Saloon]]. < ref > Richard Wortley 1976.

 === Post WWII === 
 After the war, in the 1950s striptease became the motor of an emerging sex industry (mainly focused on publications, like [[Playboy]]). Paris saw the opening of the high-society [[strip clubs]], like the [[Alcazar]] or the Crazy Horse. 
 
 In modern times, the art of striptease gets lost more and more. In the 1990s, a German private TV channel (called [[RTL]]) made a strip show called [[Tutti Frutti]]. Since then, during the night, many TV stations have women, who try to get rid of their clothes (without even dancing), while they advertise some [[phone sex]] numbers (or other prime-rate numbers).  
 
 There is also a film called ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]''. It plays in [[United States|US]] strip clubs,  without giving much background information. 
 
 Originally, striptease was only done by women. Today, a very small number of male strippers are there. Among the most notable of them are the [[Chippendales]].
