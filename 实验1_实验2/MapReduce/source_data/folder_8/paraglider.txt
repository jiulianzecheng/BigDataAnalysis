 A '''paraglider''' is a free-flying, foot-launched [[aircraft]].  
 In mountain areas, pilots usually take off from great height to fly down to the valley. In flat areas, a winch is used to tow the paraglider to a height of up to 400 meters before it is released. It is also possible to soar on the coast in laminar sea breeze. Some more advanced pilots also launch from hot air balloons or helicopters. {{Commons|Paragliding}}
