'''Sergeant''' is a [[Military rank|rank]] used in  most [[military|militaries]], [[police ]]forces, and other uniformed [[organization]]s around the world. The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''serviens'',  " one who serves " , through the [[French language|French]] term ''Sergent''. 
 
 A sergeant ('''Sgt''') in the [[British Army]] wears three point-down [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, or  " checks "  on their sleeve. They usually serves as a [[platoon]], [[troop]], or group sergeant, or in a specialist position. 
 
 A '''[[Lance-Sergeant]]''' ('''LSgt''') was originally a Corporal doing the work of a Sergeant. The job is now used mostly in the [[Guards Division|Guards]], where it is given to all Corporals. A Lance-Sergeant in the Guards and [[Honourable Artillery Company]] wears three chevrons, and is considered senior or higher up to  " normal "  Corporals. For most purposes, he still remains a Corporal rather than an acting Sergeant (e.g., he will typically command a [[section (military unit)|section]]). In the [[Household Cavalry]], the same rank is [[Lance-Corporal of Horse]]. 
 
 The official spelling was '''Serjeant''' ('''Sjt''') (still used by [[The Rifles]]) until after [[World War II]], although the modern spelling had already been in common use for many years.
