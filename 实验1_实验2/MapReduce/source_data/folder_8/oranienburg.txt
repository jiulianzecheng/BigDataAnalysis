It was originally settled by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic people]], and was probably called Bochzowe. Germanic settlers arrived in the 12th century, and kept the original name. Because of the strategic location, a castle was built in the 13th century. The first known reference occurred in 1216, as  " Bothzowe " . City rights were awarded in 1232.  The name Bothzowe, lives on in Bötzow. In 1483, the castle lost its importance, and [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg]] built a new residence there, he used for hunting.
