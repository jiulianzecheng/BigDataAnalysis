The Bāburnāma (Chagatai/Persian: بابر نامہ‎;´, literally:  " History of Babur "  or  " Letters of Babur " ; alternatively known as ''Tuzk-e Babri'') is the [[memoir]]s of Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad Bābur ([[1483]]–[[1530]]), founder of the [[Mughal Empire]] and a great-great-great-grandson of Timur. It is written in the [[Chagatai language]], known to Babur as  " ''Turki'' "  (meaning Turkic), the spoken language of the Andijan-Timurids. During Emperor Akbar's reign, the work was completely translated to [[Persian]], the usual literary language of the Mughal court, by a Mughal courtier, Abdul Rahīm, in AH 998 (1589–90).[1] Translations into many other languages followed, mostly from the [[19th century]] onwards.
