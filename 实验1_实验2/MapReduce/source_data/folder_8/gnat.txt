 A '''gnat'''  < ref > The '''G''' is not pronounced < /ref >  is any  tiny [[fly]] in the suborder [[Nematocera]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef632|title=Midges and Gnats {{!}} Entomology|website=entomology.ca.uky.edu|access-date=2016-09-22}} < /ref >   
 
 " Gnat "  is a loose descriptive category rather than a technical term.  They can be both biting and non-biting. The biting ones are often called [[midges]]. Often they fly in large numbers, called clouds, in damp places like the [[Scottish Highlands]].  
 
 One interesting group are the eye-gnats. the [[Smithsonian Institution]] describes them as “non-biting flies, no bigger than a few grains of salt, ... attracted to fluids secreted by your eyes”. < ref > {{cite web
