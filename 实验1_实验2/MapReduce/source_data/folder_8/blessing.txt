A '''blessing''' is way to wish good luck for a person. Sometimes, in religious [[ritual]]s, it is said the [[God]] blesses those who are good, or people can bless God with [[anointing]]. In [[Judaism]], they bless God over wine. The [[priest]]s can also bless religious objects in order to make them become [[holy]]. 
 
 The saying  " bless you "  is commonly used when someone [[sneeze]]s. This is done because there is a [[tradition]] carried by the [[superstition]] that a person's [[soul]] will come out of their mouth and nose if they sneeze. People believed that saying  " God bless you, "  or  " bless you "  for short, would make the soul go back inside. They are wishing the person good luck so that their soul is able to come back.  < ref name= " LoC " > {{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress: Every Mysteries|url=https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/does-your-heart-stop-when-you-sneeze/|accessdate=August 12, 2020|title=Does your heart stop when you sneeze?}} < /ref > 
 
 People also think that if unusual good luck or a [[miracle]] comes to them, it is a blessing. For example, if some people wanted a child badly but are having difficulty [[fertilization|conceiving]], it could be considered a blessing from God if they end up having a child. 
 
 To ''give your blessing'' to someone is to give permission to them. For example, a man can ask his girlfriend's parents' for their blessing before he asks her to marry him. 
 
 Blessings are often thought of as the opposite of a [[curse]].
