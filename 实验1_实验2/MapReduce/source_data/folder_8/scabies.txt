'''Scabies''' is caused by [[infection]] with the female [[mite]] ''Sarcoptes scabiei''. The mite is an [[ectoparasite]]. The mite burrows into the skin to live and deposit eggs.  
 
 The [[symptoms]] of scabies are due to an [[allergic reaction]] to the mites. Scabies is usally spread by direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes). < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Dressler|first1=C|last2=Rosumeck|first2=S|last3=Sunderkötter|first3=C|last4=Werner|first4=RN|last5=Nast|first5=A|title=The Treatment of Scabies.|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|date=14 November 2016|volume=113|issue=45|pages=757–62|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2016.0757|pmid=27974144|pmc=5165060}} < /ref >  Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not yet developed symptoms. Crowded living conditions, such as those found in child-care facilities, group homes, and prisons, increase the risk of spread. Areas with a lack of access to water also have higher rates of disease. 
 
 The mite is very small and usually not directly visible.
