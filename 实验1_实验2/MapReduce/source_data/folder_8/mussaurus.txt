 '''''Mussaurus''''' (meaning  " mouse lizard " ) was an early, plant-eating [[prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Triassic]], about 215 million years ago.  It was found in southern [[Argentina]]. It gets its name from the small size of the skeletons first discovered. 
 They were large-eyed hatchlings (babies), only 9-16 inches long (18-37 cm); these are the smallest dinosaur skeletons yet found. 
 
 However, ''Mussaurus'' is now known from adult specimens. < ref > Otero A.  &  Pol D. 2013. Postcranial anatomy and phylogenetic relationships of Mussaurus patagonicus (Dinosauria, Sauropodomorpha).

''Florida Scientist'', '''69'''(4): 243-257. < /ref >  ''Mussaurus'' possesses anatomical features suggesting a close, possibly [[transitional fossil|transitional]] evolutionary relationship with true sauropods.
