 '''''Sarcosuchus''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of giant  [[crocodile]]. It lived in the [[Lower Cretaceous]] of what is now [[Africa]] 135 to 112 million years ago.   
 
 ''Sarcosuchus'' was one of the largest giant crocodiks that ever lived. It was almost twice as long as the modern [[saltwater crocodile]] and weighed about 8 [[tonnes]].  
 
 Until recently, all that was known of it was a few [[fossil]]ised [[teeth]] and [[armour]] scutes, which were discovered in the [[Sahara Desert]] in the 1940s or 1950s.  
 
 In 1997 and 2000, [[Paul Sereno]] discovered half a dozen new specimens, including one with about half the skeleton intact and most of the [[vertebral column|spine]]. All of the other giant crocodiles are known only from a few partial skulls, so which is actually the biggest is an open question. 
 
 == Palaeobiology == 
 Unlike other giant crocodiles, ''Sarcosuchus'' was a river [[predator]]. < ref > Sereno P; Larsson H.C; Sidor C.A; Gado B. 2001.  " [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5546/1516 The Giant Crocodyliform Sarcosuchus from the Cretaceous of Africa] " . ''Science'' '''294''', pp1516â€“1519. (published online October 25, 2001). < /ref >  As the overhanging jaw and stout teeth are designed for grabbing and crushing, its primary [[prey]] may have been large animals and smaller dinosaurs, which it [[ambush]]ed, dragged into the water, crushed, drowned and then tore apart. 
 
 However, the long, thin snout of ''Sarcosuchus'' was very similar to the thin snouts of the modern [[gharial]], the false gharial and the slender-snouted crocodile, all of which are nearly exclusive fish-eaters and incapable of tackling large prey. This can be contrasted to both the modern [[Nile crocodile]] and the extinct ''[[Deinosuchus]]'', both of which have very broad, heavy skulls, suitable for dealing with large prey. This, coupled with the abundance of large, [[lobe-finned fish]] in its [[environment]], leads many to suggest that, far from being a dinosaur killer, Sarcosuchus was simply a large [[piscivore]], a scaled-up version of the modern gharial. 
 
 == Environment == 
 110 million years ago, in the early Cretaceous, the Sahara was still a great [[tropics|tropical]] [[plain]], dotted with [[lake]]s and crossed by [[river]]s and [[stream]]s that were lined with vegetation. Based on the number of fossils discovered, the [[aquatic]] ''Sarcosuchus'' was probably plentiful in these warm, shallow, [[freshwater]] habitats. 
 
 Unlike modern true crocodiles, which are very similar in size and shape to one another and tend to live in different areas; ''Sarcosuchus'' was just one of many Crocodyliformes, of different sizes and shapes, all living in the same area. < ref name= " NATGEODEC " / >  Four other species of extinct Crocodyliformes were also discovered in the same rock formation along with the ''Sarcosuchus'', including a [[dwarf crocodile]] with a tiny, 8 & nbsp;cm (3 & nbsp;in) long skull. < ref name= " NATGEODEC " > National Geographic Special on SuperCroc. National Geographic Channel, December, 2001. < /ref >  They filled a diverse variety of [[ecology|ecological]] niches, instead of competing with each other for resources.
