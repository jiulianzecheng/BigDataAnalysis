 {{wiktionary|kick}} 
 In hand-to-hand combat, in [[martial art]]s and [[sport]]s, a '''kick''' is a blow with the [[foot]], the [[knee]] or the [[leg]]. It is used in combat as an attack. Generally, the kicks are slower than the punches although stronger than the blows with [[hand]]s. 
 
 The kicks are a fundamental part in many martial arts. The examples are: wushu, [[karate]], [[kickboxing]], [[tangsudo]] or [[taekwondo]]; whereas other arts do not use any kick, as it is in the case of judo or of boxing. Other martial arts can use kicks, although they limit them to attacks to the legs and to the lower parts of the body of the opponent. 
 
 There exists a great number of kicks, and a lot of them have typical names for each one. Frequently the same movement has different names in different martial arts. This is obvious especially when comparisons are done between western arts and oriental arts.
