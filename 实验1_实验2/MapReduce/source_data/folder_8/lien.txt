 In the [[United States]], the term lien generally refers to a wide range of legal interests. It includes other forms of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or charge.  In the USA, a lien is a ''non-possessory'' security interests meaning the lien holder does not usually possess the property. 
 
 In other [[common law countries]], the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest. The holder of a lien right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged.  In contrast to the usage of the term in the USA, in other countries it refers to a purely ''possessory'' form of security interest. When possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. < ref > ''Hatton v Car Maintenance' [1915] 1 Ch 621 < /ref >
