 Several [[plant]] [[species]] that grow in [[arid]], [[steppe]]-like environments use the [[wind]] to propagate. The structure that is pushed by the wind is usually called '''tumbleweed'''. This structure will detatch from its root or stem and will roll on the ground. In most such species, the tumbleweed consists of the whole plant apart from the [[root]] system. Sometimes,  only  a hollow [[fruit]] or [[inflorescence]] detaches. < ref name= " Ganong1921p359 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkgaAAAAYAAJ|title=A Textbook of Botany for Colleges|last=William Francis Ganong|publisher=MacMillan Co.|year=1921|page=359}} < /ref >  Tumbleweed species occur most commonly in [[steppe]] and [[arid]] [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]], where  frequent wind and the open environment permit rolling easly. < ref name= " Baker2007 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzKOSux-3UoC & pg=PA90|title=Dispersal of an Invasive Tumbleweed|last=Dirk V.

 Most  tissues of the tumbleweed structure are dead.  This needs to be the case,  because the structure needs to degrade and fall apart so that its [[Seed|seeds]] or [[Spore|spores]] can escape during the tumbling. Sometimes they  [[Germination|germinate]] after the tumbleweed has come to rest in a wet location. In this case, many species of tumbleweed open mechanically, releasing their seeds as they swell when they absorb water. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=[[William Francis Ganong|W. F.

 The tumbleweed diaspore [[Seed dispersal|disperses]] seeds. This stategy is not limited to the [[seed plants]]; some species of spore-bearing cryptogams—such as ''Selaginella''—form tumbleweeds, and some fungi that resemble [[Puffball|puffballs]] dry out, break free of their attachments and are similarly tumbled by the wind, dispersing spores as they go. < ref name= " Jr.Miller1988 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwFFAAAAYAAJ|title=Gasteromycetes: Morphological and Developmental Features with Keys to the Orders, Families, and Genera|last1=Orson K.
