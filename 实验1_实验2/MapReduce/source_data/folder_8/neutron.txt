 '''Neutrons''', with [[protons]] and [[electrons]], make up an [[atom]]. Neutrons and protons are found in the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] of an atom. < ref name=igcse > {{cite book|author=Woolley, Steve|title=Edexcel IGCSE Physics Revision Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsephys0000wool|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education|page=[https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsephys0000wool/page/20 20]-21|isbn=9780435046736}} < /ref > < ref name=cox / > < ref name=nave / >  Unlike protons, which have a positive charge, or electrons, which have a negative charge, neutrons have [[zero]] charge < ref name=igcse / > < ref > {{cite book|author=Ryan, Lawrie|title=Chemistry for you: revised National Curriculum edition for GCSE|url=https://archive.org/details/chemistryforyou0000ryan|date=2001|edition=Second|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780748762347|page=[https://archive.org/details/chemistryforyou0000ryan/page/29 29]}} < /ref >  which means they are  [[neutral particle]]s.

Particles emerged which had no charge, and he called these 'neutrons'. They were later added to the modern image of the atom.

 Like all [[hadron]]s, neutrons are made of [[quark]]s. A neutron is made of two [[down quark]]s and one [[up quark]]. < ref name=cox > {{cite book|author1=Cox, Brian|author2=Cohen, Andrew|title=Wonders of the Universe|url=https://archive.org/details/wondersuniverse00coxb_864|date=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780007395828|page=[https://archive.org/details/wondersuniverse00coxb_864/page/n193 79], 108}} < /ref > < ref name=nave > {{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/proton.html|last=Nave|first=R.|title=Protons and neutrons|publisher=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|date=2007-01-15|accessdate=2011-07-15}} < /ref >  One up quark has a [[electromagnetism|charge]] of +2/3, and the two down quarks each have a charge of -1/3. The fact that these charges cancel out is why neutrons have a neutral (0) charge. Quarks are held together by [[gluon]]s. 
 
 == Isotopes == 
 Neutrons can be found in almost all atoms together with protons and electrons. [[Hydrogen]]-1 is the only exception. Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called [[isotope]]s of the same [[chemical element|element]].  
 
 The number of neutrons in an atom does not affect its chemical properties. However it affects its [[half-life (element)|half-life]], a measure of its [[stability]]. An unstable isotope has a short half-life, in which half of it decays to lighter elements. By contrast, a stable isotope has a long half-life, much longer than that of an unstable isotope. The stability of an isotope is related to [[radioactivity]]: an unstable isotope can be highly radioactive. 
 
 == Atomic reactions ==  
 Neutrons are the key to [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s.
