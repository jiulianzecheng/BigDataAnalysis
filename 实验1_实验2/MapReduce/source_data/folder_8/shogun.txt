 {{Nihongo|'''Shogun'''|将軍}} is a military title in pre-[[Meiji period]] [[Japan]]. < ref > Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA878 & dq=  " Shogun " ] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 878-879. < /ref >  Shogun means ''general'' in the [[Japanese language]]. The full name was ''Seii Taishogun'' (Great General who fights against the Eastern savages and will win). 
 
 In the earlier times, Shogun were simply generals for emperors. The [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] had power over the shogun, choosing each shogun. Later however, the Shogun held much of the actual power. In [[1192]] a [[samurai]], military leader [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] got the title of Shogun from the last Emperor [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa of Japan|Go-Shirakawa]]. Excluding the later middle of the 16th century, Shogun was the real ruler of Japan. 
 
 The office of the Shogun is called the [[shogunate]] (''bakufu'', meaning ''office in a tent'').-  This is because Shogun had originally been military leaders and he had his office in a tent on a battle field. 
 
 There were three shogunates in Japan. 
 * [[Kamakura shogunate]], < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA459 & dq=  " ''Kamakura-jidai'' " ] at pp. 459. < /ref >  1192 & ndash;1333, founded by Minamoto no Yoritomo 
 * [[Muromachi shogunate]] < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA669 & dq=  " ''Muromachi-jidai'' " ] at pp. 669. < /ref >  (also known as the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA53 & dq=  " Ashikaga " ] at  pp. 53-54. < /ref > ), 1338 & ndash;1573, founded by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] 
 * [[Edo shogunate]] < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA167 & dq=  " Edo-jidai " ] at pp. 167. < /ref >  (also known as the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA978 & dq=  " ''Tokugawa-jidai'' " ] at p. 978; [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA978 & dq=  " Tokugawa " ] at p. 976; < /ref > ), 1602 & ndash;1868, founded by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] 
 
 In 1868 the 15th Shogun of Tokugawa Shogunate, [[Tokugawa Yosinobu]] gave up his office. Then the time of Shogun rule ended. It was the end of the feudal time of Japan.
