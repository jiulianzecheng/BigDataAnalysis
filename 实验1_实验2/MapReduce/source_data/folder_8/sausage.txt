 '''Sausage''' is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up [[meat]]. It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Traditionally, a sausage casing is made of animal [[intestine]], but can sometimes be made of [[plastic]]. There are many forms of sausages, including [[hot dog]], [[pepperoni]], [[bologna]], and [[salami]]. 
 
 Sausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, ears and other parts. Some have blood in them. [[Germany|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] sausages normally have a lot of  " rusk, "  or [[bread]] crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries. Vegetarian or vegan sausages are often made of products other than animal products, such as [[tofu]]. < ref > {{cite news|last=Lapidos|first=Juliet|title=Vegetarian Sausage: Which imitation pig-scrap-product is best?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/06/vegetarian_sausage.single.html|newspaper=Slate|date=8 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527214046/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2011/06/vegetarian_sausage.single.html|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=dmy-all}} < /ref >
