 A '''''baray''''' ({{lang-km|បារាយណ៍}}) is a man-made body of water. They are a common part of the [[architecture|architectural style]] of the [[Khmer Empire]] of [[Southeast Asia]]. The largest are the [[East Baray]] and [[West Baray]]. They are in the [[Angkor]] area. Each is [[rectangular]] in shape, oriented east-west and measuring about {{convert|5|by|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Historians are not certain about the meaning and functions of barays. Some think that they were [[spiritual]]. They think they represent the Sea of Creation around [[Mount Meru]]. Others sau that they held water for [[irrigation]] of fields. Others believe that it was used to store water. This is the current most popular theory. It is possible that the function was a combination of these reasons, or others.
