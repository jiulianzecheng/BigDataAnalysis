'''Enterobacter''' is a group ([[genus]]) of bacteria that are part of the [[ESKAPE pathogens]]. There have been 22 species that’ve been discovered so far. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Makar|first1=A. B.|last2=McMartin|first2=K. E.|last3=Palese|first3=M.|last4=Tephly|first4=T.

In addition, they can survive in oxygen containing ([[Aerobic organism|aerobic]]) as well as oxygen-free ([[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]) environments. 
 
 This genus is part of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] which is a group that contains many harmful bacteria like [[Salmonella]] and [[Shigella]].

 These species are known for causing many infections with most of the species being nosocomial (acquired in hospitals). Some example infections include urinary tract infection (UTI), intra-abdominal infections, respiratory tract infection and soft tissue infection. There are antibiotics that treat Enterobacter infections; however, resistance to the currently employed antibiotics is rising, and there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics to fight this bacterium. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Two species that are especially resistant to antibiotic treatment are [[Enterobacter huaxiensis]] and [[Enterobacter chuandaensis]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Bose|first1=K.
