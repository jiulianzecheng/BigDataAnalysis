'''Athanasius '''was a [[Christian]] [[bishop]] and [[Patriarch]] of Alexandria in [[Egypt]]. Athanasius and another [[Church]] [[leader]] named [[Arius]] disagreed about the [[theology]] of [[Jesus]]. Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] had the leading [[priest]]s of [[Christianity]] go to the [[First Council of Nicea]] to [[debate]] which of the two was right. They said that it was Arius, so Arius’s [[theology]] became the [[Nicene Creed]] which Athanasius opposed. Athanasius’s religious belief is called the [[Athanasian Creed]].
