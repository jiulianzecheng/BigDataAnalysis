 '''Lenno''' is a small village on the shores of [[Lake Como]] in northern Italy. It is located about {{convert|60|km|mi|0}} north of [[Milan]] and about {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Como]]. Lenno is on a small bay of Lake Como called the ''Golfo di Venere'' (Bay of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]). < ref name =  " Macri " > {{cite book| last = Macri| first = Rosmarie| title = Fascinating Lake Como: travel guide for discoverers| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AFu3BwAAQBAJ & pg=PA59| year = 2015| publisher = Troubador Publishing Ltd| isbn = 978-1-78462-962-5| page = 59 }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] started the village. [[Julius Ceasar]] invited 500 [[Greeks]] to come live in the village. The Greeks planted [[olive tree]]s all around Lenno. The historian Paolo Giovio (1483-1552) and the geographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1527â€“1598) wrote that [[Pliny the Younger]] had a [[Roman villa|villa]] in Lenno.

 Today, the village is popular with tourists. It has [[mansion]]s, hotels, restaurants, and a small [[harbor]]. In 2014, Lenno was joined with three other nearby villages ([[Mezzegra]], [[Ossuccio]] and [[Tremezzo]]) to make a single [[municipality]] called Comune di [[Tremezzina]]. < ref name =  " Macri "  / > < ref > ''Il Giorno'' (8 January 2014).
