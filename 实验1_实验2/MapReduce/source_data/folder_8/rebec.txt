 The '''rebec''' is a bowed [[string instrument|string]] [[musical instrument]] that was played many hundreds of years ago. It was either held under the chin, like a [[violin]], or held against the arm. The name “rebec” was spelt in a variety of ways. 
 
 == Origins == 
 The rebec dates back to the [[Middle Ages]] and was particularly popular in the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th centuries]]. The instrument is [[Europe]]an, but probably developed from the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] instrument called the “rebab”. Instruments like the rebec were being played in the [[10th century]]. 
 
 == Tuning == 
 The rebec can have any number of strings from one to five, although three is the most common number. The strings are often tuned in [[interval (music)|fifths]]. The instrument played high notes like the violin, but in later years bigger rebecs were made that played lower notes. 
 
 == Use of the rebec == 
 The rebec was mostly used for [[dance]] music. Dancing masters often used a kind of pocket-sized rebec called a “kit”. 
 
 The rebec was also used in [[folk music]], especially in [[eastern Europe]], [[Spain]] and [[North Africa]]. 
 
 In medieval and [[Renaissance]] times the rebec in Europe was played by [[minstrel]]s. They dressed in special [[uniform|livery]] and played at important [[Festival|feasts]] and in processions. They were also played by [[shepherd|cowherds]]. [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] has several rebec players at his court. 
 
 Today many Middle Ages re-enactors like to play rebec since it is an authentic Medieval instrument.
