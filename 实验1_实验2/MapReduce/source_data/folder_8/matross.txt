A '''matross''' was a soldier of [[artillery]]. He was a member of an [[artillery]] (gun) crew. A matross [[rank]]ed next below a [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]. The duty of a matross was to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns. They were armed with [[musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. They marched with the store-wagons, acting as guards. In the [[United States|American]] army a matross ranked as a private of [[artillery]].  
 
 == History == 
 Matrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. < ref name=ARO > {{cite web |url=http://www.americanrevolution.org/artillery.php |title=Artillery |author= |date= |website= |publisher=AmericanRevolution.ORG |accessdate=9 June 2015}} < /ref >  Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the [[German language]] a matrose means a [[sailor]]. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. < ref name=ARO/ >  It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable [[wikt:title|title]]. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. < ref name=ARO/ >  The rank of matross was no longer used. 
 
 A soldier's manual for artillery used by Americans in the Revolutionary war gave a detailed instruction for a matross. In part it said: 
 {{cquote|The first matross (1) stands on the right side of the chace of the piece, between the piece and the right wheel, and with his back touching the axletree. His left foot is advanced a pace in front and both legs are straight. His head is turned so much tothe left as to have a glimpse of the flash of the vent with the left eye when the piece if fired. His duty is to sponge and ram the piece. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.brigade.org/barmem/SoldiersManual/Artillery.pdf |title=Soldier's Manual, Section X, Artillery |author=Mathias L.

 By the [[War of 1812]] an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men. < ref name=Tucker29 > Spencer Tucker; James R. Arnold; Roberta Wiener; et al., ''The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'', Volume 1 (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 29 < /ref >  Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a [[non-commissioned officer]] would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties. < ref name=Tucker29/ >
