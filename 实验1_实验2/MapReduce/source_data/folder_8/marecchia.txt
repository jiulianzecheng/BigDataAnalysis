 The '''Marecchia''' ({{lang-la|Ariminus}}) is a [[river]] of the [[Emilia-Romagna]] [[Regions of Italy|region]]. The city of [[Rimini]] gets its name from the Latin name of the river. 
 
 Its low course marks the end of the Padan Plain ({{Lang-it|Pianura Padana}}). 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The Marecchia river has a length of {{Convert|70|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and a [[drainage basin]] with an area of approximately {{Convert|500|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on }}. < ref name= " trecani " > {{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/marecchia/ |title=Marecchia |publisher=Treccani.it - Enciclopedie on line |language=it |access-date=29 October 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 Its [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] ([[volume]] of [[water]] which passes through a section of the river per [[Unit of measurement|unit]] of [[time]]) depends of the [[season]]: in the [[autumn]] could be as high as {{Convert|1200|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on }} but is very low during summer. Most of the time, the discharge is about {{Convert|11|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on }}. 
 
 ===Course=== 
 The Marecchia river flows through a valley named after it, ''Valmarecchia''. The river starts at about {{Convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on }} west of ''Viamaggio'' ([[Municipality|''comune'']] of [[Pieve Santo Stefano]]) and about {{Convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on }} southwest of the ''comune'' of [[Badia Tedalda]], in the [[province of Arezzo]] ([[Tuscany]]), in the ''Alpe della Luna'' at an [[elevation]] of {{Convert|1454|m|ft|1|abbr=on }} [[above sea level]]. 
 
 At about {{Convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on }} to the northeast of Badia Tedalda, the river flows into the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region, in the [[Casteldelci]] ''comune'', [[province of Rimini]]. Then it flows through Ca 'Raffaello, an [[exclave]] of Badia Tedalda; to the north of here, the Senatello river flows into the Marecchia as a left [[tributary]]. Later, in ''Ponte Masa'', the Masa river flows from the right into the Marecchia. 
 
 Shortly after ''Torello'', the San Marino river flows as a right tributary and, after the [[Verucchio]] ''comune'', the Ausa flows also from the right. 
 
 Between the ''frazioni'' (Italian subdivisions of a [[municipality]]) of ''Rivabella'' and ''San Giuliano'', in Rimini, the Marecchia river ends in the Adriatic Sea. 
 
 The '''Bridge of Tiberius''' ({{lang-it|Ponte di Tiberio}}) or '''Bridge of Augustus''' ({{lang-la|Pons Augustus}}) is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[bridge]] in Rimini. Its [[construction]] began in the times of [[Augustus]] but was finished in 20 [[AD]] in the times of [[Tiberius]].
