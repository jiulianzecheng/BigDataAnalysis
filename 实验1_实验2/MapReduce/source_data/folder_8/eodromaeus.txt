 ==Description== 
 ''Eodromaeus'' was a relatively small dinosaur, with a total length of about {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} from nose to tail, and a weight of about {{convert|5|kg|lb}}. The trunk was long and slender. It is unknown how fast ''Eodromaeus'' could run: about {{convert|30|km/h|mph}} has been suggested. < ref name= " usatoday_Eodromaeus " > Weise E, [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2011-01-13-dinosaur-discovery_N.htm  " New dog-sized dinosaur discovered " ], ''www.usatoday.com'', 23-01-2011. < /ref >  The animal was, like all early dinosaurs, [[bipedal]]. The forelimbs were much shorter than the hindlimbs, ending in hands with five digits. Digits IV and V were very reduced in size. < ref name=Eodromaeus/ >
