'''KNIL''' is the [[abbreviation]] for a [[the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[army]]. This army was in what is now called [[Indonesia]]. The official name is '''''K'''oninklijk '''N'''ederlandsch-'''I'''ndisch '''L'''eger'' (''Royal [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch-East Indies]] Army'') 
 
 Indonesia was a Dutch [[colony]] from [[1800]] to [[1949]]. It was then called ''Nederlandsch IndiÃ«'' (Dutch East Indies). The KNIL taskforce was sent there to maintain order. 
 
 When Indonesia declared itself independent in [[1945]] the Dutch fought a war to keep the colony. This war was won by the Indonesians. The Dutch government accepted Indonesia's independence in [[1949]], and the KNIL ceased to exist.
