An '''obelus''' (plural, '''obeli''') is a symbol of a line with dots above and below,  < math > \div < /math > , and is used to represent the [[Division (mathematics)|division]] operation in [[mathematics]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Division|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Division.html|access-date=2020-08-26|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Division|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/division.html|access-date=2020-08-26|website=www.mathsisfun.com}} < /ref >  Because of that, this symbol is also known as a '''division sign'''.  
 
 The word  " obelus "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for a sharpened stick, spit, or pointed pillar. This is the same root as that of the word  " [[obelisk]] " . The obelus was first used as a symbol for division in [[1659]], in the [[algebra]] book ''Teutsche Algebra'' by [[Johann Rahn]]. Today, the obelus is used occasionally, mostly as a standalone symbol for the division operation itself (as on a [[calculator]]), or as an operator in elementary [[arithmetic]]. In most cases, division is now represented using other ways, often by a forward slash ( < tt > / < /tt > ), also known as  " solidus " . < ref name= " :0 "  / >
