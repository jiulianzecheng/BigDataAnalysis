In [[music]], an '''ostinato''' is a short pattern of notes which is repeated several times throughout a song or piece of music.  The word  " ostinato "  is related to the word ''obstinate''.  It is like a musical idea which is being obstinate and will not go away.  The plural can be either  " ostinati "  or  " ostinatos " . 
 
 An ostinato can last for a section of a piece or it might last for the whole piece of music. 
 
 An ostinato can be a repeated group of [[note (music)|notes]] or just a [[rhythm]].  It is similar to a [[riff]] in [[jazz]].  Many kinds of music use ostinati, e.g. [[classical music]], jazz, [[boogie-woogie]] and [[Africa]]n music. 
 
 A ground bass, or ''basso ostinato'', is an ostinato pattern in the lowest notes, which keeps playing while the melodies in the higher notes change.  This was often used in [[baroque]] musical works. An example is the famous ''[[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D]]'' by [[Pachelbel]]. 
 
 An example of a rhythmic ostinato is the first movement from the ''Planets Suite'' by [[Gustav Holst]].  This is the movement in 5/4 time which describes [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].  ''Bol√©ro'' by [[Maurice Ravel]] also uses a repeated rhythm all the way through the piece. 
 
 An example from [[popular music]] is [[Pink Floyd]]'s  ''Money''.
