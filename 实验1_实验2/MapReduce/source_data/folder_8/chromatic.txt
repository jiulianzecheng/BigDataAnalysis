A '''chromatic scale''', also known as a '''dodecatonic scale''', is a musical [[scale (music)|scale]] which uses every [[note (music)|note]] as it goes up or down i.e. it goes up and down in [[semitone]]s (half tones). To play a chromatic scale on the [[piano]] every note is played: both white and black notes (e.g. C, C sharp, D, D sharp, E, F etc.). A chromatic scale can start on any note. 
   
 ==Meaning of the word “chromatic”== 
 
 The word “chromatic” comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word “chromos” meaning “[[color]]”. [[Pipe organ|Organists]] in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th centuries]] such as [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck|Sweelinck]] liked to write “Chromatic Fantasias”. These were pieces based on tunes which were chromatic. In those days, because of the [[musical tuning|tuning systems]] used, not all the semitones were exactly the same size. Going up a chromatic scale would have been like walking up a staircase with steps which were slightly larger or smaller in depth. This made chromatic scales very interesting and “colourful” which is why they were called “chromatic”. 
 
 ==Chromatic harmony== 
 
 '''Chromatic harmony''' means harmony ([[chord]]s) that use notes which do not belong to the [[tonality|key]] the music is in (they are not in the [[key signature]]). Although [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] in the [[18th century]] used chromatic harmony, it was 19th century composers who used it more and more. [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] wrote music which was very chromatic: there were lots of [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] and [[Flat (music)|flats]] and it kept modulating to different key areas. The chord at the beginning of his [[opera]] ''[[Tristan und Isolde|Tristan and Isolde]]'' is so famous that it is known as the ''Tristan chord''. It is very chromatic. The music is full of [[tension]] because it leaves us wondering which key the music is in.
