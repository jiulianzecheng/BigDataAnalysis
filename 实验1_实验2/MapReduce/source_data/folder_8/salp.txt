 A '''salp'''  is a barrel-shaped, [[plankton|planktic]] [[tunicate]].  
 
 Salps moves by contracting. This pumps water through their gelatinous bodies. It is one of the most efficient examples of [[jet propulsion]] in the animal kingdom. < ref > {{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb05071.x | volume=201 | issue=4 | title=Jet propulsion in salps (Tunicata: Thaliacea) |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-zoology_1983-12_201_4/page/481 | year=1983 | journal=Journal of Zoology | pages=481â€“506 | last1 = Bone | first1 = Q.}} < /ref >   
 
 The salp pumps water through its internal feeding filters and feeds on [[phytoplankton]]. 
 
 Salps are common in all seas. The most salps are in the [[Southern Ocean]] (near [[Antarctica]]), < ref > {{cite news|title=Now that's a jelly fish!|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2543194/Fisherman-plucks-bizarre-shrimp-like-creature-water-New-Zealand-thats-completely-through.html|access-date=22 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=22 January 2014}} < /ref >  where they may form enormous swarms, often in deep water. They are sometimes even more abundant than [[krill]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.divediscover.whoi.edu/expedition10/index.html|title=Dive and Discover: Scientific Expedition 10: Antarctica|access-date=2008-09-03}} < /ref > 
 
 Although salps look similar to [[jellyfish]] with their simple body form and behaviour, in fact they are [[chordate]]s. This means they are animals with a [[dorsal]] [[nerve cord]]. They are related to [[vertebrate]]s, animals with [[vertebral column|backbone]]s.
