'''Secobarbital sodium''' (sold as '''Seconal''') is a drug which is used to treat [[epilepsy]] and [[insomnia]].  Trade names include Seconal and reds. It was first synthesised in 1928. Like other [[barbiturate]]s, it is fairly [[addiction|addictive]]. In many countries, using this drug is illegal, outside the medical context. Today, this drug is only used rarely; Barbiturates have been replaced by [[Benzodiazepine]] for many applications.
