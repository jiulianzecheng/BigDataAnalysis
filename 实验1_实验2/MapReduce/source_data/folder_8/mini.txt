 The '''Mini''' is a small [[car]] made by the [[British Motor Corporation]] (BMC), [[British Leyland]] and [[Rover]] from 1959 to 2000. It used a [[transverse engine]] and [[front-wheel drive]], where the turning [[power]] was put on the front wheels of the car rather than the back wheels. Its design saved a large amount of space. It allowed most of the car's size to be used for [[passenger]]s and [[luggage]]. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers. 
 
 The design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. < ref > {{cite book|first1=Martin |last1=Buckley |first2=Chris |last2=Rees |title=Cars: An encyclopedia of the world's most fabulous automobiles |year=2006 |publisher=Hermes House |isbn=1-84309-266-2 |quote=The BMC Mini, launched in 1959, is Britain's most influential car ever.

 Alec Issigonis was searching for the ideal C V joint for a front wheel drive car, when William Cull the Chief Engineer of Scott Motors realised he knew of the ideal joint, Mr Cull bought the rights for the CV joint from the American holder and sold them to Hardy Spicer of Birmingham, after making samples in his workshop in Shipley, Yorkshire. Hardy Spicer bought Mr Culls Business and he became the MD of a division of the Company making the joints.

 It was first released in August 1959. Rover ceased production in October 2000. It was marketed under the names [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]], [[Morris Motors|Morris]], [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], Wolseley, Riley, British Leyland and Rover. 
 
 In 2001, the Mini was relaunched by BMW as a premium small hatchback which quickly became popular thanks to its retro styling, fun driving experience, many customisation options and strong resale values. It received redesigns in late 2006 and late 2013.
