 '''Slackware''' is a [[GNU/Linux]] distribution which is famous for being stable, fast and suitable for older computers. Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that is still supported.  
 
 It does not offer any graphical tools for configuration; rather, the person must change it on their own using the [[command line interface]] and by editing [[text file]]s. 
 
 The newest version is Slackware 15.0.
