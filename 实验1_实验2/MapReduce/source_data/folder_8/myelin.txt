'''Myelin''' is a substance that forms the coating of [[axons]] in the [[brain]] and the rest of the [[central nervous system]]. This coating is also known as the '''myelin sheath'''. It is a substance made of about 80% [[lipid]] and 20% [[protein]]. Its main function is to speed the relay of [[electrical|electricity]] messages in the nervous system. It is milky white and slippery in [[appearance]] and [[texture]], giving rise to the term ''white matter'' in the brain. 
 
 Myelin is an important part of proper [[Neuron|neural]] function. In later life, a process called '''demyelination''' can occur, causing poor neural function. Demyelination may be a cause of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[Multiple sclerosis]] happens when myelin is damaged.
