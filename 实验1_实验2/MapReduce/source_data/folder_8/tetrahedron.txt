 A '''tetrahedron''' or '''triangular pyramid''' is a [[polyhedron]] (a [[three-dimensional]] [[shape]]). It has four [[Vertex|corners]] and six edges. All four of its faces are [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral triangles]]. Every two edges meet on one of those corners forming a sixty-degree [[angle]].

 A '''regular tetrahedron''' is a tetrahedron whose edges are the same length. If the length of an edge is ''a'':

 == Other properties == 
 A regular tetrahedron's faces are all the same, and so are all its edges, as well as its corners. This makes it a [[regular polyhedron]]. It is also convex (its faces do not go through one another), which makes it a [[Platonic solid]]. 
 
 The dual of regular tetrahedron is another regular tetrahedron. This is called being self-dual.
