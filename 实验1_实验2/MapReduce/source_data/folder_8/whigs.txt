 The '''Whigs''' were a [[political party]] in the [[parliaments]] of [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The Whigs' start was in [[constitutional monarchism]] and disagreement with [[absolute monarchy]]. Between the 1680s and 1850s, they tried to win power over their rivals, the [[Tories]]. The British [[prime minister]] was usually from one of the two parties. 
 
 The Whigs played a central role in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and were the enemies of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings and pretenders]], who were [[Roman Catholic]]. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715. They held it until [[King George III]], coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in. < ref > Brewer, John 1981. ''Party ideology and popular politics at the accession of George III''. < /ref >   
 
 When they held power, the Whigs got rid of the Tories from all major jobs in [[government]], the army, the [[Church of England]], the legal jobs and local officials. < ref > Jones J.R. 1961. ''The first Whigs: the politics of the exclusion crisis, 1678â€“1683''. Oxford University Press, 4. < /ref >   
 
 Their most famous leader was [[Robert Walpole]], who kept control of the government from 1721 to 1742. 
 
 Later on, many of their ideas were adopted by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the later 19th century.
