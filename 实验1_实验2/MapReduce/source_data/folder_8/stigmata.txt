 '''Stigmata''' are marks on a person's [[body]], that are like the [[wound]]s [[Jesus]] got from being [[crucified]]. 
 
 They supposedly happen to other [[religion|religious]] people like [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], as well as Jesus. The marks include [[nail]] holes in the hands and feet, as if the person had been [[crucified]], but without that having happened.  
 
 == Contradictions == 
 Those who believe in stigmata say that actual nails were not used, but the holes just appear as a [[miracle]]. Those who do not believe say it is not a miracle. They have other ways to explain those stories.
