 '''Jugiong''' is a small [[village]] on the bank of the [[Murrumbidgee River]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is 344 & nbsp;km south west of [[Sydney]] on the [[Hume Highway]]. The first people to live in the area were [[indigenous Australians]], the Wiradjuri people. The first [[Europe]]ans were the [[explorer]]s [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] on their trip in 1824. < ref name=history > {{citation |author=Unknown |title=A Brief History of Jugiong |publisher=Jugiong Village and Development Committee|date=1996 }} < /ref >

 In 1845 another Irishman named John Philip Sheahan (1816–December 9, 1877) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~sgrieves/jugiong_cemetery.htm|title=Jugiong Cemetery|website=members.iinet.net.au}} < /ref >  built the Sir George Tavern (an [[hotel]]) which made Jugiong an important resting place on the new road, the ''Great Southern Road'', to [[Melbourne]]. The building was destroyed in a [[flood]] in 1852. The flood also destroyed the buildings at the town of [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]]. Sheahan rebuilt the hotel with walls up to 500 & nbsp;mm thick and it is still in use; remaining in the family throughout the preceding years. It is the oldest family owned hotel in Australia. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/jugiong-20040208-gdkq3g.html|title=Jugiong|date=8 February 2004|website=The Age}} < /ref >
