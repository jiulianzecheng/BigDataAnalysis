 '''Ballarat''' is a [[city]] in central [[Victoria, Australia]]. Nearly 90,200 people live there, which makes it the third biggest city in Victoria, after [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]]. It is also the biggest city that is not on the [[coast]] in Victoria. It is about {{convert|105|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Melbourne]]. The city area covers about {{convert|7500|ha|acre|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}.

 The first people from [[Europe]] came to Ballarat in 1837 to be [[sheep]] [[farmer]]s. They took over large areas of land, with some [[farm]]s more than {{convert|40000|ha|acre|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. By 1840 there were more than 20 [[farm]]s with thousands of [[sheep]] in the Ballarat area. The city area was a farm owned by William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson who arrived in 1838. 
 === Gold rush === 
 [[Gold]] was found at Ballarat in late August [[1851]], by James Regan and John Dunlop < ref name= " Bate " > {{cite book| author=Weston Bate|title=Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat, 1851 - 1901| date= 1978|page = 7}} < /ref >  and within three weeks there were nearly 1000 people digging in the area looking for gold. In two days the Cavanagh brothers dug up {{convert|27.2|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of gold from a hole less than two [[metre]]s deep. < ref name=Bate/ >  This area is now called  " Golden Point " . Within a year there were 20,000 people living in Ballarat. With so many people coming to look for gold, the town soon became bigger. The Post Office opened on [[November 1]], [[1851]]. < ref name =  " a " > {{Citation | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC & country= | access-date = 2008-04-11 }} < /ref > 
 
 Ballarat is famous as the site for an uprising, or [[rebellion]]. This is known as the [[Eureka Stockade]] or the Eureka Rebellion, which took place on [[3 December]] [[1854]]. About 30 miners were killed. This is an important moment in Australian history. The site now has a [[museum]], called the [[Eureka Centre]], with displays about the rebellion. The rebel miners flag, the [[Eureka Flag]] can be seen at the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]]. 
 
 === Big city === 
 Gold mining made Ballarat a rich town, and it was made a city in 1871. The railway came to the town with the opening of the [[Geelong-Ballarat railway line, Victoria|Geelong-Ballarat line]] in 1862, < ref name= " rg " > {{cite web

 The money made from gold mining can still be seen in size of many public buildings, the large parks, wide streets, the grand style of shops and hotels, and large houses built for the wealthy residents. From the 1880s to the start of the 20th century the city changed from a gold rush town to a large industrial city. Factories that made equipment for mining slowly changed into engineering and manufacturing businesses. The [[Victorian Railways]] built the [[Ballarat North Workshops]] in April 1917. < ref name= " lee144 " > {{cite book |author=Lee, Robert |title=The Railways of Victoria 1854-2004 |publisher=Melbourne University Publishing Ltd |year=2007 |isbn= 978-0-522-85134-2 |page=144}} < /ref > 
 
 During 1901, the Duke of Cornwall and York, later [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], opened the first [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. While in Victoria, the Duke and Duchess made several journeys by train, on 13 May they went from Melbourne to Ballarat via [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], returning to Melbourne via [[Bacchus Marsh, Victoria|Bacchus Marsh]]. < ref > ''Royal Visit to Ballarat 1901'' McLean, Jack [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], August, 1994 pp211-233 < /ref >  Ballarat's [[Ballarat Airport|airport]] was opened in 1930. 
 
 === World War II === 
 In 1940 the Federal Government took over the airport as an [[air base]] for the [[Empire Air Training Scheme]]. During [[WWII]] the base was a [[RAAF]] Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for [[USAAF]] Liberator bomber squadrons. During the war the airport was made much bigger, with three sealed runways. Two of these were over 2,000 & nbsp;metres (6,550 & nbsp;ft) long and 45 & nbsp;metres (150 & nbsp;ft) wide. The aerodrome remained the RAAF School of Radio until 1961 when it was returned to normal use. The City of Ballarat now runs the airport which is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]] for its social and historic importance. 
 
 === After the war === 
 After World War II, Ballarat grew to the northwest. To ease the housing shortage a large estate was built by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] on the old Ballarat Common This area is now called [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|title=Wendouree West|access-date=2009-08-26|archive-date=2010-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  From 1951 to 1962, 750 houses were built, with another 300 added in the 1970s. This was matched by private housing built in [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]]. 
 
 In the 1980s the areas of growth have been in the south and west of the city, as well as new building in the inner areas of the city. Through the 20th century Ballarat continued to grow at a steady rate. New public buildings have been built including the hospital, the library, the law courts and the police station complex. Ballarat is home to many schools, including [[Damascus College]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.damascus.vic.edu.au/life-damascus-learning-teaching-curriculum-overview|title=Life @ Damascus - Curriculum Overview|access-date=2016-05-28|archive-date=2016-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610205815/http://www.damascus.vic.edu.au/life-damascus-learning-teaching-curriculum-overview|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
