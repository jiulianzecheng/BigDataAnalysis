 A '''moped''' is a [[vehicle]] with two wheels and a motor, like a [[motorcycle]] but smaller. It usually has pedals, like a [[bicycle]]. 
 
 The size of the motor is usually 49cc, much smaller than most motorcycle motors. Because of the small motor, mopeds usually can not go faster than 50 [[kph]] (30 [[mph]]). Mopeds use less [[fuel]] than motorcycles, but some people complain that mopeds create more air [[pollution]] than motorcycles. Most of the time, you need a special license to ride a motorcycle but you only need an ordinary driver's license to ride a moped. It is usually [[illegal]] to ride a moped without a [[helmet]].
