 '''Alacant''' or '''Alicante''' ({{lang-es|Alicante}}, [[Valencian language|Valencian]]: {{lang|ca|Alacant}}) is a city in [[Spain]]. It is the capital of the province of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]]. It is in the southern part of the [[Valencian Community]]. It is also a historic [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port. The population of the city of Alicante proper is about 332,067, as of 2014, ranking as the second-largest [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] city. < ref name=INE > [http://www.ine.es/en/inebmenu/mnu_cifraspob_en.htm Instituto Nacional de Estadística] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113073354/http://www.ine.es/en/inebmenu/mnu_cifraspob_en.htm |date=2011-11-13 }} Official population figures: Municipal Register. < /ref >   Including nearby municipalities, Alicante was populated by 458,843 residents. Population of the [[metropolitan area]] (including [[Elche]] and satellite towns) was 795,034 as of 2009. Based on population it is the eighth-largest [[List of metropolitan areas in Spain by population|metropolitan area of Spain]]. 
 
 The city is a sea [[Harbour|port]] and a [[tourism|tourist centre]]. It has a hot [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSh'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). 
 
 The avenue Maisonnave is the principal commercial street in the city of Alicante. In fact, Maisonnave is the sixth most expensive avenue in the whole of [[Spain]], which gives an idea of the importance that this  street has. The [[Corte inglés]] has in this central street both branches that it possesses in Alicant, one at each end of the avenue. 
 
 Santa Barbara's Castle is 166 metres up the Benacantil mountain. It's very strong with great strategic value. It's called Santa Barbara's Castle because the 4th of December is Santa Barbara's day and the 4th of December in 1248 is when it was taken from the Arabs by Alfonso of Castilla.
