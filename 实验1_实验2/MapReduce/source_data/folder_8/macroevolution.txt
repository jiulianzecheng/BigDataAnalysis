'''Macroevolution''' refers to large-scale [[evolution]]. For some, this means the origin of [[species]]. For others, it means the large-scale changes seen in the [[fossil]] record.

 It is a term of convenience: for most biologists it does ''not'' suggest any change in the [[process]] of evolution. < ref name=Fut/ > < ref > Rensch B. 1959. ''Evolution above the species level''. Columbia University Press. < /ref >  For a few palaeontologists, some things they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis. < ref > Stanley S.M. 1979.

There are some interesting discussions by other palaeontologists. < ref > Smith A.B. 1994. ''Systematics and the fossil record: documenting evolutionary patterns''. Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref > 
 
 Some biologists use the term for [[evolution]] in already separated [[gene pool]]s. < ref name = Matzke > Matzke, Nicholas J. and Paul R. Gross 2006. Analyzing critical analysis: the fallback antievolutionist strategy. ''In'' Eugenie Scott and Glenn Branch, ''Not in our classrooms: why intelligent design is wrong for our schools'', Beacon Press, Boston {{ISBN|0807032786}} < /ref >  For them, macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of [[species]]. Again, this is a minority position. Most biologist would not call evolution at the species level  " macroevolution " . 
 
 '''Microevolution''', < ref > {{cite book|author=Dobzhansky, Theodosius|title=Genetics and the origin of species|publisher=New York, Columbia Univ. Press, 3rd ed|year= 1951|id=LC QH366 .D6}} p12 < /ref >  on the other hand, refers to smaller evolutionary changes ''within'' species or populations. During microevolution changes in [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] definitely do occur. Some biologists, [[Richard Dawkins]] in particular, have suggested that the gene is the object of selection. < ref > Williams G.C. 1966. ''Adaptation and natural selection''.

 == Relation of macroevolution to microevolution == 
 [[Paleontology]], evolutionary [[developmental biology]], and [[sequence analysis]] contribute much evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of [[feather]]s during the evolution of [[bird]]s from one group of [[dinosaur]]s. 
 
 Within the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] school of thought, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one – the only difference between them is of time and scale. < ref > Simpson G.G. 1944. ''Tempo and mode in evolution''. Columbia, N.Y. < /ref > < ref > Simpson G.G. 1953. ''The major features of evolution''. Columbia, N.Y. < /ref > 
 
 Some [[Creationism|creationists]] have also adopted the term 'macroevolution' to describe the form of evolution they reject. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within species (microevolution), but deny that one species can evolve into another (macroevolution). < ref name = Matzke/ >  These arguments are rejected by biologists, who hold that there is ample evidence that macroevolution has occurred in the past. < ref name= " talkorigins " / > 
 
 ==Research topics== 
 Some examples of subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution: 
 
 * The debate between [[punctuated equilibrium]] and [[gradualism]] 
 * [[Speciation]] and [[extinction]] rates 
 * [[List of extinction events|Mass extinction]]s 
 * [[Adaptive radiation]]s such as the [[Cambrian|Cambrian Explosion]] 
 * Changes in [[Biodiversity#Biodiversity and evolution|biodiversity]] through time 
 * The role of development in shaping evolution, particularly such topics as [[heterochrony]] and [[developmental plasticity]] 
 * [[Genome|Genomic evolution]], like [[horizontal gene transfer]], genome fusions in [[Symbiosis|endosymbioses]], and adaptive changes in genome size 
 
 ==Origin of the term== 
 Russian entomologist [[Yuri Filipchenko]] (or Philipchenko, depending on the transliteration) first coined the terms 'macroevolution' and 'microevolution' in 1927 in his German language work, ''Variabilität und Variatio''. < ref name= " talkorigins " / > 
 
 Since then, their meanings have been revised several times and fallen into disfavour with many, who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process. < ref name= " talkorigins " > [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/macroevolution.html Macroevolution: its definition, philosophy and history < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > 
 
 ==Criticisms of macroevolution== 
 Evolution as a whole is strongly supported by many kinds of evidence. < ref name= " talkorigins " / > 
 
 The issue for biologists is whether there is any sense in having the special term ''macroevolution''. < ref > Bowler P.J. 2003. ''Evolution: the history of an idea'', 3rd ed, revised and expanded. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0520236936}}. < /ref >  The answer is yes for a few biologists who proposed one or more evolutionary mechanisms which worked above the species level. The ideas of [[punctuated equilibrium]] and [[species selection]] were suggested, but in each case most biologists felt they could be explained by the usual small-scale changes. This explains why 'macroevolution' is perhaps a term biologists do not need to use. 
 
 When discussing the topic, [[creationism|creationists]] use  " strategically [[wikt:elastic|elastic]] "  definitions of micro- and macroevolution. < ref name = Matzke/ >   Macroevolution, by their definition, cannot be attained. Any observed evolutionary change is described by them as being  " just microevolution " . < ref name = Matzke/ > 
 
 The debate between biologists continues, with some biologists stating that there is significant evidence that other factors have acted during macroevolution, < ref > {{cite journal|author=Erwin, Douglas H. |title=Macroevolution is more than repeated rounds of microevolution |journal=Evolution  &  Development |volume=2|pages=78–84|year=2000 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00045.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00045.x/full|issue=2|pmid=11258393 |s2cid=20487059 }} < /ref >  and others maintaining that macroevolution can still be fully explained by the mechanisms of microevolution. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Carroll, Sean B.|title=The big picture|journal=Nature|volume=409|year=2001|issue=6821|page=669|doi=10.1038/35055637|pmid=11217840|s2cid=4342508|url=http://cursos.ciencias.uchile.cl/ecologia/ecologiamolecular/modulo1/macroevolution.pdf|access-date=2011-03-26|archive-date=2011-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814042643/http://cursos.ciencias.uchile.cl/ecologia/ecologiamolecular/modulo1/macroevolution.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
