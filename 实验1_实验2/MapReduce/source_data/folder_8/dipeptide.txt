A '''dipeptide''' is a kind of [[organic compound]] (and therefore a kind of [[molecule]]). < ref > https://www.bionity.com/en/encyclopedia/Dipeptide.html#:~:text=A%20dipeptide%20is%20a%20molecule,by%20a%20single%20peptide%20bond. Bionity.com. Retrieved 2023-02-25 < /ref >  A dipeptide is made up of only two [[amino acid]]s: one amino acid on each side of a [[peptide bond]]. A dipeptide can be made from two different amino acids or by two amino acids of the same kind. A peptide bond will be in between the two amino acids. < !--When different, two isomers of the dipeptide are possible, depending on the sequence.  Several dipeptides are physiologically important, and some are both physiologically and commercially significant. -- >
