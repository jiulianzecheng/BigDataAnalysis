 '''Nutrition''' provides the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of an [[organism]] with [[food]], in a form they can use. Organisms need food to be able to keep their bodies working properly. They also need food to be able to do certain things. [[Malnutrition]] can happen when a person does not eat the right amount of nutrients. They can get better by changing their [[diet]] to have the right amount of the various nutrients. 
 
 Different organisms have different food requirements, and they eat different things in order to meet those requirements. [[Animal]]s that [[herbivore|do not eat meat]], for example, will have to get certain nutrients like [[protein]] from other foods. 
 
 A nutrition expert is called a [[dietician]]. [[Nutritionist]]s are different because they do not need the government to recognize them as experts. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. 
 
 The six main types of nutrient are [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, [[mineral]]s, protein, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. A [[macronutrient]] is a nutrient that needs to be eaten a lot. A [[micronutrient]], such as a vitamin, is needed in smaller amounts, but it is still important. Carbohydrates are not needed by the body but most people eat a lot of them. Complex carbohydrates are more nutritious than simple carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are found in vegetables while simple carbohydrates are found in processed foods. They take longer to digest because they have more [[Fibre|fiber]]. Because they stay in the stomach for longer they leave the person who has eaten them feeling fuller for longer. Protein is needed for building cells. It is found in [[milk]], [[meat]], [[fish]], [[bean]]s, [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and other foods like [[quinoa]]. Protein is made of [[amino acid]]s. 
 
 Fat is found naturally in some foods. People often eat it in [[Food processing|processed foods]] such as [[cake]]s and [[chocolate]]. It is  high in energy. Omega 3 and omega 6 fats are needed by the body. There are [[saturated fat]]s and [[unsaturated fat]]s. It is recommended that people avoid the saturated type. It has been linked with [[heart disease]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12170-013-0295-z|title=Saturated Fat and Cardiovascular Disease: A Review of Current Evidence|first1=Majella|last1=O’Keeffe|first2=Marie-Pierre|last2=St-Onge|date=1 April 2013|journal=Current Cardiovascular Risk Reports|volume=7|issue=2|pages=154–162|via=Springer Link|doi=10.1007/s12170-013-0295-z|s2cid=57261418}} < /ref >  [[Trans fat|Trans fats]] is also a fat people should avoid. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Trans fat: Double trouble for your heart|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114|access-date=2021-05-04|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en}} < /ref >  A lot of people think that fat is bad in general, but it is still controversial. People are also advised not to eat too much [[sugar]] or [[salt]]. 
 
 Most people eat three meals a day. Eating every few hours keeps [[blood sugar]] stable. Some foods are good for us and some foods are bad.
