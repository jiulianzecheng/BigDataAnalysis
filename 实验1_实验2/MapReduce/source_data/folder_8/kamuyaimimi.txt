 Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto, also known as 神八井耳命 in Japanese, is a character in Japanese mythology. He was one of the three brothers born to [[Emperor Jimmu]] and his wife [[Himetataraisuzu-hime]]. < ref name= " Motoori2007 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk4EucRlvSwC & pg=PA191|title=The Poetics of Motoori Norinaga: A Hermeneutical Journey|last=Norinaga Motoori|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8248-3078-6|page=191}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > {{Citation|title=Book III|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nihongi:_Chronicles_of_Japan_from_the_Earliest_Times_to_A.D._697/Book_III|work=Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697, Volume 1|access-date=2023-03-09}} (called Kami-ya-wi-mimi in this source) < /ref > 
 
 
 Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto became famous for his involvement in the killing of [[Tagishimimi]]. He and his brother Suizei killed Tagishimimi to save Suizei from being assassinated.. < ref name= " :1 " / > 
 
 In the Kojiki Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto was the older brother of Suizei and was next in line to become the emperor. However, he chose to pass the throne to his younger brother Suizei. This is similar to the story of Yamayukihiko and Umiyukihiko, who also made an  " oath of subordination "  to each other.. < ref name= " :1 " / > 
 
 Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto has a connection with [[Aso Shrine]], where a deity named Takeban Ryujin (Taikei Watatsu) is enshrined. According to the shrine's mythology, Takeban Ryujin is considered a  " child "  of Kamuyaiminomikoto, and this is also supported by the Kojiki, which mentions that  " Aso-kun is a descendant of Kamuyaiminomikoto. " " . < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=神八井耳命（カムヤイミミノミコト）|url=https://nihonsinwa.com/page/2609.html|access-date=2023-01-17|website=nihonsinwa.com|language=ja}} < /ref > 
 
 Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto was not only involved in the Assassination of Tagishimimi, but was also known for his bravery and leadership. When the princes found out about Tagishimimi's plot to assassinate Suizei, Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto attempted to kill Tagishimimi himself, but his limbs shook and he could not do it. His younger brother, Kamununakahamiminomikoto, took Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto's weapon and went in to kill Tagishimimi instead.. < ref name= " :1 " / > 
 
 == Historical records == 
 Historical records indicate that the Yamato Imperial Court sent members of the imperial family to [[Shinano Province]] to control {{Ill|Takeminakata|lt=Suwa no Kami|en}}, a powerful deity with ancestral ties to the Izumo and Koshi gods. This area was strategically important as it connected the Sea of Japan and the East. Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto, son of Emperor Jimmu and an influential member of the imperial family, was among those dispatched to Shinano. The Kojiki, an ancient record of Japanese history, also credits him with establishing the Emperor System.. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=archive.ph|url=https://kodaishi.net/person/royalty/kamuyaimimi|access-date=2023-01-17|website=archive.ph|archive-date=2023-01-17|archive-url=https://archive.today/20230117162104/https://kodaishi.net/person/royalty/kamuyaimimi|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 According to the Kojiki, Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto not only established the Emperor System but also appointed Takeiotatsu no Mikoto, his grandson, as the national governor. This appointment is considered to be the first time that the king of Japan was appointed to the position of Kunizukuri. Additionally, the palace of Shikinomizugaki, which is located in Nara Prefecture, was built during the reign of the 10th [[Emperor Sujin]]. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 It is believed that Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto's family followed the four provincial generals, Ohiko-no-mikoto. The Shinano-no-kuninomiyatsukos were likely buried in the Mori Shogunzuka burial mound, located on the opposite side of the Kawayanagi Shogunzuka burial mound.. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 Hase Shrine is a shrine located in Shiozaki, Shinanoi, Nagano City, which is dedicated to Yaimimi no Mikoto, the ancestor of the Shinano-no-kuninozukuri. After the Shinto and Buddhist eras, the shrine was transformed into Hase Kannon. It is known as one of the three Hase Kannon temples in Japan, along with Hase Temple in Yamato and Kamakura. The temple was established during the reign of Emperor Seimei (reigned 629-641), who was the father of Emperor Tenchi, and is believed to be the oldest Hase temple in Japan.. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 == Descendants == 
 Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto is also the ancestor of a very large number of clans, as mentioned in the Kojiki. These include the Iwa-no-Kunino-no-Miyatsuko of Hitachinoku, the Naka-no-Kunino-Miyatsuko of Hitachi, the Funaki-no-Atahi of Ise, the Niwa-no-Omi of Owari, and the Shimada-no-Minamoto, < ref name= " :1 " / >  he is also said to be the ancestor of the {{Interlanguage link|Ōshi clan|ja|多氏}}. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/743364863|title=Nihon kodai shizoku jinmei jiten.|date=November 2010|publisher=Yoshikawakobunkan|others=Taro Sakamoto, Kunio Hirano, 太郎 坂本, 邦雄 平野|isbn=978-4-642-01458-8|chapter=神八井耳命（古代氏族）|trans-chapter=Kamuyaimimi (ancient clan)|oclc=743364863}} < /ref >  The descendants of Kamuyaimimi-no-mikoto have left traces all over Japan, from Kyushu to the [[Tōhoku region|Tohoku]] region. They supported and solidified the  " Emperor System "  founded by Emperor Jinmu. Taian Manpo, who compiled the Kojiki, is a descendant of Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 The Kojiki mentions that Kamuyaimi-no-mikoto gave up his right to the imperial throne in favor of his younger brother. His descendants were responsible for performing rituals at [[Aso Shrine]] and [[Suwa-taisha]] Shrine, which are believed to be the oldest sacred sites in the eastern and western regions of Japan.. < ref name= " :0 " / >
