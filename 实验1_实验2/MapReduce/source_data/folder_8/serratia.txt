 ''Serratia'' – [[genus]] of [[Gram-negative]] [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Bacillus (shape)|rod-shaped]] [[bacteria]], some [[species]] of which produce a red [[pigment]], [[prodigiosin]]. Members of ''Serratia'' were initially considered harmless, < ref > {{Cite web|title=Serratia marcescens - Infectious Disease and Antimicrobial Agents|url=http://www.antimicrobe.org/b26.asp|access-date=2022-07-24|website=www.antimicrobe.org}} < /ref >  however, they cause [[Infection|infections]] in [[Animal|animals]], [[Plant|plants]], [[Human|humans]], and [[Insect|insects]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last=Mahlen|first=Steven D.|date=October 2011|title=Serratia Infections: from Military Experiments to Current Practice|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=755–791|doi=10.1128/CMR.00017-11|issn=0893-8512|pmc=3194826|pmid=21976608}} < /ref >  The diseases include [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], [[endocarditis]], and [[Wound|wound infections]]. The most common species – ''Serratia'' ''marcescens'', was found to be highly [[Pathogen|pathogenic]] to humans and animals. ''S. marcescens'' is included in hospital-acquired infections; found in [[Urinary system|urinary]], [[Respiratory tract|respiratory]], and [[Digestive system|gastrointestinal]] tracts. They cause disease mainly in individuals with weak [[immune system]]. Other species cause bone and cardiovascular system infections. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Kämpfer|first1=Peter|last2=Glaeser|first2=Stefanie P.YR 2016|title=Serratia aquatilis sp. nov., isolated from drinking water systems|url=https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.000731|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|year=2016 |volume=66|issue=1|pages=407–413|doi=10.1099/ijsem.0.000731|pmid=26537514 |issn=1466-5034}} < /ref >   
 
 == Habitat == 
 ''Serratia'' genus occupies wide range of [[Habitat|habitats]], including water, both [[Salt water|seawater]] and [[drinking water]]; < ref name= " :1 "  / >  [[Plant|plants]], such as [[Vegetable|vegetables]], [[Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Grass|grasses]], [[Moss|mosses]]; and [[Insect|insects]]: healthy, diseased and dead.  
 
 == History == 
 The discovery of ''Serratia'' genus began with [[Serratia marcescens|''Serratia marcescens'']] species colonised food in 1819. In the city of [[Padua|Padula]], [[Italy]], cornmeal dish, called [[polenta]], of many people turned red. This phenomenon was called “bloody polenta” and was believed to have a diabolical origin. The investigation began, and [[Pietro Melo]] wrote a paper where he stated that it was spontaneous [[fermentation]]. For four years [[Bartolomeo Bizio]], a Venetian [[pharmacist]] observed small red spots which got larger and subsequently merged into a red mass. Later, in 1823, he published a paper where he stated that the organism was a [[fungus]] and named him ''Serratia marcescens'' (after a Florentine [[physicist]] [[Serafino Serrati]]). < ref name= " :0 "  / >   
 
 == Transmission and treatment == 
 Transmission occurs hand-to-hand, through hospital equipment, such as catheters, and also [[Sink|sinks]], [[blood]] products and [[Antiseptic|antiseptics]].   
 
 ''S. marcescens'' species are increasingly [[Antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to [[antibiotics]], they rapidly acquire resistant genes, which makes the infections difficult to treat. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Simsek|first=M.|date=January 2019|title=Determination of the antibiotic resistance rates of Serratia marcescens isolates obtained from various clinical specimens|url=https://journals.lww.com/njcp/Fulltext/2020/23040/Immunosuppressive_Agents_in_the_Treatment_of_IgA.1.aspx|journal=Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice|volume=22|issue=1|pages=125–130|doi=10.4103/njcp.njcp_362_18|issn=1119-3077|pmid=30666031 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  [[Gentamicin]] is the common antibiotic that was used to treat ''S. marcescens'' infections, however, bacteria became resistant to it. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Khanna|first1=Ashish|last2=Khanna|first2=Menka|last3=Aggarwal|first3=Aruna|title=Serratia Marcescens- A Rare Opportunistic Nosocomial Pathogen and Measures to Limit its Spread in Hospitalized Patients|url=https://doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2013/5010.2737|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|year=2013 |publisher=JCDR|publication-date=2013|volume=7|issue=2|pages=243–246|doi=10.7860/JCDR/2013/5010.2737 |pmid=23543704 |pmc=3592283 }} < /ref >  ''S. marcescens'' has the ability to produce [[beta-lactamase]], < ref name= " :2 "  / >  which is the [[enzyme]] providing bacteria resistance to [[beta lactam]] antibiotics, such as [[penicillin]].
