 '''Asecs''', earlier '''A6 center''', is a [[shopping mall]] in the town of [[Jönköping]] in [[Sweden]]. The shopping mall was opened on 2 April 1987. That was following the 1985 disestablishment of the [[Småland Artillery Regiment]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://maltell.se/historia/artal.htm|title=Årtal och händelser i Jönköping|publisher=Jönköpings historia|language=sv|access-date=18 March 2009}} < /ref > 
 
 The shopping mall is located on both the northern and the southern side of the [[European route E4|E4]] [[Controlled-access highway|motorway]]. These parts are connected with a [[covered bridge]] that spans across the motorway. Major parts of the shopping mall are located at this bridge. The bridge also housed a [[McDonald’s]] restaurant until 2019. From that restaurant, the motorway can be seen. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/notiser/lamnar-centrum-i-jonkoping/|title=McDonalds lämnar köpcentrum i Jönköping|publisher=Fastighetsvärlden|author=Philip Wallin|language=Swedish|date=27 September 2019|accessdate=7 August 2022}} < /ref > 
 
 The mall changed its name  spelling-wise to Asecs on 26 October 2017. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.jp.se/article/har-ar-a6-nya-logga/|title=Titta, nu skrotar A6 sitt klassiska varumärke|publisher=Jönköpingsposten|language=sv|author=Sara Uddemar, Ing-Marie Jonsson|date=23 October 2017|access-date=26 October 2017|archive-date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024135313/https://www.jp.se/article/har-ar-a6-nya-logga/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
