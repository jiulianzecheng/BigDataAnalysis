 '''''Goosebumps''''' is a collection of children's [[horror fiction]] books written by [[R. L. Stine]]. 
 
 The ''Goosebumps'' series sometimes contained too much violence, so some [[United States|American]] libraries disagreed with having the books there; the novels were fifteenth on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of most frequently challenged books from [[1990]] to [[1999]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/top100challenged.htm |title=ALA  & #124; Top 100 Challenged Books 1990-1999 |access-date=2008-01-14 |archive-date=2007-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202192459/http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/top100challenged.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 After the series, many different spinoffs were made, also written by Stine, including ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]'' and ''Goosebumps: Series 2000'' which appeared in [[1995]] and [[1998]]. 
 
 Two board games were created after the ''Goosebumps'' series, these were called  " Terror in the Graveyard "  and  " Escape from Horrorland " . a [[1996]] PC game was also produced, entitled ''Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland''. 
 
 Front covers and most other Goosebumps-related art was done by artist [[Tim Jacobus]], while the covers for the later ''Give Yourself Goosebumps'' series were digitally created by Craig White. 
 
 In 2015, [[Goosebumps (movie)|a movie based on the book]] was released starring [[Jack Black]] as [[R. L. Stine]].
