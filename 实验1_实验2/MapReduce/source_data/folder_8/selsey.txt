 '''Selsey''' is a seaside town and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]], about eight miles (12 & nbsp;km) south of [[Chichester]] in [[West Sussex]], England. Selsey is at the southernmost point of the [[Manhood Peninsula]], almost cut off from mainland [[Sussex]] by the sea. It is bounded to the west by Bracklesham Bay, to the north by Broad Rife (''rife'' < ref name=parish96 > Parish. A Dictionary of the Sussex Dialect. pp. 96-97 < /ref >  being the local word for stream or creek), to the east by Pagham Harbour and ends in the south at [[Selsey Bill]]. There are significant rock formations beneath the sea off both of its coasts, named the Owers rocks and Mixon rocks. Coastal erosion has been an ever-present problem for Selsey. < ref name=scopac1 > SCOPAC.

   - The Standing Conference on Problems Associated with the Coastline (SCOPAC) was established in 1986 and consists of local authorities, the Environment agency and others. ''Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the coastline was some 2 to 3km seawards of where it is now at about 5,000 years''. Retrieved 5 February 2014 < /ref > 
 
 The B2145 is the only road in and out of the town crossing a bridge over the water inlet at Pagham Harbour at a point known as  " the ferry " . At one time Selsey was  inaccessible at flood tide, and a boat was stationed at the ferry to take horses and passengers to and from Sidlesham. < ref name= " horsfield35 " > Horsfield.
