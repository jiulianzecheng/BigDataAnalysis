 '''Thurgau''' is a northeast [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Switzerland]]. The [[population]] is 228,200 ([[2003]]). The [[Capital (city)|capital]] is [[Frauenfeld]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 To the north of Thurgau is [[Lake Constance]], across which are [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. The river [[Rhine]] makes the border in the northwest. To the south is the [[Canton of St. Gallen]]; to the west are the cantons of [[Zürich Canton|Zürich]] and [[Schaffhausen]]. 
 
 The area of the canton is 991 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  and is usually divided into three hilly areas. One of these is along [[Lake Constance]] to the north. Another is inland between the rivers [[Thur (Switzerland)|Thur]] and [[Murg]]. The third one makes the southern border of the canton and comes together with the [[Hörnli]] mountain in the pre-Alps. 
 
 == History == 
 In prehistoric times the lands of the canton were inhabited by people of the [[Pfyn culture]] along the lake. During Roman times the canton was part of the province ''Raetia'' until in [[450]] the lands were settled by the [[Alamanni]]. It was only in the [[8th century]] that the canton became a political unit similar to what it is known today, as a [[Gau (German)|Gau]] of the [[Frankish Empire]]. At the time, however, the area was not so clearly defined and changed frequently. Overall, the size of the Thurgau was larger, but during the [[Middle Ages]] the canton became smaller in size. The dukes of [[Zähringen]] and the counts of [[Kyburg]] took over much of the land. 
 The town of [[Zürich City|Zürich]] was part of the Thurgau until it became ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' in [[1218]]. When the Kyburg dynasty became extinct in [[1264]] the [[Habsburgs]] took over that land. The Swiss confederation allied with ten freed bailiwicks of the former [[Counts of Toggenburg|Toggenburg]] seized the lands of the Thurgau from the Habsburgs in [[1460]], and it became subject territory of Zürich. 
 
 In [[1798]] the land became a canton for the first time as part of the [[Helvetic Republic]]. In [[1803]] the canton of Thurgau became a member of the Swiss confederation. The current cantonal constitution dates from [[1987]]. 
 
 == Economy == 
 The canton of Thurgau is known for farm produce such as apples, pears, and other fruits and vegetables. The many orchards in the canton are used for the making of cider. [[Wine]] is produced in the Thur valley.
