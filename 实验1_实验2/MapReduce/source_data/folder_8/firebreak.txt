[[Image:Fireplow0179.JPG|thumb|[[Plow]] cutting a firebreak in advance of a forest fire, [[South Carolina]]]]A '''Firebreak''' is a way to fight [[Wildfire|wildfires]]. In a firebreak, there is no [[vegetation]], or other [[material]] that can burn. This makes it hard for a [[fire]] to jump across the break. Therefore, the spread of a possible fire is delayed.[[Image:RockyPointTrailAsFirebreak.jpg|thumb|Rocky Point Trail acted as a firebreak for a forest fire in the McDonald Lake region of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], Montana, USA in the summer of 2003|none]]
