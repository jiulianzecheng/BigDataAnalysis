It is west of [[England]], and east of the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Ireland]]. 
 
 Wales is one of the [[Celt]]ic areas of Britain. The native people of Wales, [[Welsh people|the Welsh]], have their own [[culture]] and [[tradition]]s. They have their own [[Celtic language]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Not all Welsh people can speak Welsh, but it is a real living language for about 20% of Welsh people. Virtually all Welsh people can speak [[English language|English]]. Most speak only English. The Welsh language is an [[official language]] alongside English, and has equal official status.  
 
 Three [[million]] people live in Wales. Most of them live in the southern and southeastern parts of the country. In this area is the [[capital city|capital]] and largest [[city]] of Wales, [[Cardiff]], and the next largest city, [[Swansea]].  Wales has an ageing population and falling birth rates. The economy is suffering because there are not enough people of working age.  [[Gross value added]] per head in Wales — a measure of how much money is generated through goods produced and services delivered — is 74% < ref > {{Cite web|title=How to help Wales’s economy after Mark Drakeford’s exit|url=https://www.ft.com/content/66f7a8a4-c179-49a7-b7cc-0d984f7df9e4|access-date=2023-12-14|website=www.ft.com}} < /ref >  of the UK average.  
 
 == History == 
 People have lived in Wales for at least 29,000 years. The Romans first entered Wales in 43 AD, and took it around 77 AD. 
 
 === The word 'Wales' === 
 The English words ''Wales'' and ''Welsh'' come from the old Germanic word ''Walh'' (plural: ''Walha''). ''Walh'' itself came from a Celtic tribe, called the ''Volcae'' by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. That was eventually used for the name of all Celts and later to all people who lived in the [[Roman empire]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons]] who lived in [[England]] and who spoke [[Old English]] called the people living in Wales ''Wælisc'' and the land itself ''Wēalas''. < ref name= " Wales Hist 71 " > Davies (1994) p. 71 < /ref >  Other names that come from these origins [[Wallonia]], [[Wallachia]], and Vlachs. < ref > (French) Albert Henry, [[UK|Histoire des mots Wallons et Wallonie]], Institut Jules Destrée, Coll. «Notre histoire», Mont-sur-Marchienne, 1990, 3rd ed.

 In the past, the words ''Wales'' and ''Welsh'' were used to mean anything that the [[Anglo-Saxons]] associated with the Celtic Britons. That included [[Cornwall]], Walworth, and [[Walton]], < ref > {{Cite book|last = Rollason|first = David|year = 2003|contribution = Origins of a People|title = Northumbria, 500–1100|publisher = Cambridge University Press|publication-date = 2003|location = Cambridge|page = 60|isbn = 978-0-521-04102-7}} 
 < /ref >  as well as things associated with non-Germanic Europeans like [[walnut]]s. 
 
 The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry, and '''Cymru''' which is the Welsh name for Wales. These words are descended from the Brythonic word ''combrogi'', meaning  " fellow-countrymen " 
 
 === Conquest by Edward I and brief independence under Owain Glyndŵr === 
 After Llywelyn ap Gruffudd died in 1282, Edward I of England finished his conquest of Wales, which made it a part of England. Owain Glyndŵr was a Welsh leader who fought against English rule in the early 15th century. However, after he was defeated by the English, the whole of Wales was taken over by England, with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. 
 
 === Laws in Wales Acts and annexation by England === 
 In the 16th century, the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 were passed in England while Henry VIII was king there. These added Wales to England. They also said that people who spoke Welsh instead of English could not hold public office. 
 
 === Industrial Revolution === 
 Wales is on ancient rocks which were once in the roots of great mountain systems. In the last three centuries the products of those rocks have transformed what was once an agricultural landscape. 
 
 Rocks were [[smelting|smelted]] to release [[copper]] and [[iron]], key products needed by the [[industrial revolution]]. Coal itself is moved by [[canals]] and later by [[railway|rail]] to England. 
 Social justice was needed for the workers who came into Wales to do this work. < ref > Edwards, Hugh 2012. ''The story of Wales'': 4. Furnace of change. BBC. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01dczfc/the-story-of-wales-4-furnace-of-change] < /ref > 
 
 At the start of the industrial revolution, the mining and metal industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial country. The new jobs in South Wales caused a quick rise in the number of people living in Wales. This is the reason why two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, mainly in the capital Cardiff (''Caerdydd''), as well as Swansea (''Abertawe''), Newport (''Casnewydd''), and in the nearby valleys. Now that the coal industry has become a lot smaller, Wales' economy depends mostly on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. In 2010, the Gross Value Added of Wales was £45.5 billion - £15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain. 
 
 === Return of Welsh identity and devolution of Government === 
 It took until the 19th Century for Welsh-centric politics to return to Wales. [[Liberalism]] in Wales, which was introduced in the early 20th century by Lloyd George, was overtaken by the growth of socialism and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. However, Welsh pride got stronger, and in 1925 [[Plaid Cymru]] was made, which was the first political party to campaign for Welsh independence. In 1962, the Welsh Language Society was made to encourage the [[Welsh language]], which had nearly disappeared during the take over by England. A big change was made in 1998, when the first Government of Wales for the country since its addition to the United Kingdom under the Government of Wales Act (1998). This created an Assembly for Wales, known in Welsh as the senedd. The Senedd has responsibility for a range of laws which have been [[Devolved power|devolved]] from the main [[UK]] government in [[Westminster]]. This means the members of the Assembly can change certain laws in Wales to be different from the rest of the UK. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Wales has a coastline which is {{convert|1680|mi|abbr=off}} long. The country itself is {{convert|20779|km2|abbr=off}} large. 
 
 The highest mountains in Wales are in [[Gwynedd]], in the north-west. They include [[Snowdon]] (''{{lang|cy|Yr Wyddfa}}''), which is the highest peak in Wales at {{convert|1085|m|abbr=off}}. 
 
 There are three [[national park]]s in Wales. They are [[Snowdonia]] ({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri}}), [[Brecon Beacons]] ({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog}}), and [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park|Pembrokeshire Coast]] ({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro}}). 
 
 == Politics == 
 ===Local government=== 
 Wales is divided into 22 council areas. These areas are responsible for local government services, such as education, social work, environment and roads services. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en |title=Local Authorities |publisher=[[Welsh Assembly Government]] |accessdate=9 September 2010 |archive-date=30 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530004428/http://new.wales.gov.uk/topics/localgovernment/localauthorities/?lang=en |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 == Welsh identity == 
 Welsh people are very proud of their country. The first people in Wales to call themselves 'Welsh' were the Celts. The Celts lived in Wales after the Romans left in the 5th century. The national emblems of Wales are [[leek]]s and [[daffodil]]s.  
 
 Although Wales is very close to the rest of Great Britain, and despite most people speaking [[English language|English]], the country has always had a distinct [[culture]]. It is officially [[bilingual]] in English and Welsh. Over 560,000 people in Wales speak the [[Welsh language]]. In some parts of the north and west of the country, particularly in small, rural communities, the majority of people speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. 
 
 From the late 19th century, Wales became famous as the  " land of song " , and for its [[Eisteddfod]] culture festival. At many international sport events, for example the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[Rugby World Cup]], and the [[Commonwealth Games]], Wales competes on its own, as a separate country. However, at most international events, such at the [[Olympics]], Wales competes with the rest of the Great Britain, and sometimes as the [[United Kingdom]] with [[Northern Ireland]] included. [[Rugby Union]] is strongly associated with Wales as a national sport.
