The {{Nihongo|'''Film Classification and Rating Organization'''|映画倫理機構|Eiga Rinri Kikō}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''Eirin'''|映倫}}, is [[Japan]]'s [[industry self-regulation|self-regulatory]] film regulator. Eirin was established on the model of the now-defunct American [[Motion Picture Association|Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association]]'s [[Hays Code#Enforcement|Production Code Administration]] in June 1949, succeeding the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|US-led occupation authorities]]' role of film censorship during the [[Occupation of Japan]]. It classifies films into one of four categories depending on their suitability for viewing by minors of different ages.
