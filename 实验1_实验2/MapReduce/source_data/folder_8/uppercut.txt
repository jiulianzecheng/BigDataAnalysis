 An '''uppercut''' in [[boxing]] is a punch that usually aims for an opponent's chin. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of UPPERCUT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/uppercut|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >  It is commonly known as a '''hook to the chin''' (for example in [[German language|German]]: ''Kinnhaken''). 
 
 In the technical language, people do not use the expression  " hook to the chin " , because as a rule one calls a  " hook "  a punch from the side with the lead hand, and almost always the chin is the target of punches. It is achieved by lifting your right or left hand and attempting to hit the opponent's chin.
