 == History == 
 In January 1992, [[Switzerland|Swiss]] student Urban Müller start to work with software archive. It had been started by other members of a computer science students' club. 
 
 Soon the archive became famous worldwide. In 1995 Aminet has started to distribute on monthly CD-ROMs. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Redirecting to Google Groups|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.sys.amiga.announce/j89TYGs6RhI/X7J3aDtJGJ8J|access-date=2021-09-29|website=groups.google.com}} < /ref > 
 
 By using a single master site for creating ftp scripts for each slave site, Aminet reduced to a bare minimum for setting up new mirror sites. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Grosse|first=Eric|date=1995-03-01|title=Repository mirroring|url=https://doi.org/10.1145/200979.201000|journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|volume=21|issue=1|pages=89–97|doi=10.1145/200979.201000|s2cid=6127610|issn=0098-3500}} < /ref > 
 
 Aminet also shows practical use of metadata schema by software repositories. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Arquivo.pt|url=https://ipres.ischool.utoronto.ca/sites/ipres.ischool.utoronto.ca/files/iPres%202012%20Conference%20Proceedings%20Final.pdf|access-date=2021-09-29|website=arquivo.pt|archive-date=2016-01-10|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160110002619/https://ipres.ischool.utoronto.ca/sites/ipres.ischool.utoronto.ca/files/iPres%202012%20Conference%20Proceedings%20Final.pdf|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  Reports of daily additions to this software archive were posted automatically to Usenet or could be requested as an email newsletter. 
 
 Most of the programs on Aminet were public domain or shareware, but software companies made updates and demo versions of their programs available.  
 
 Now Aminet becomes wider by platform specific sites archiving software for AmigaOS 4, AROS or MorphOS only.
