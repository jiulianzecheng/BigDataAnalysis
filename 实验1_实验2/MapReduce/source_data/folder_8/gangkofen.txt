 '''Gangkofen''' is a [[Municipalities of Germany|municipality]] in the county ( " Landkreis " ) of [[Rottal-Inn]] in [[Bavaria]] in [[Germany]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 
 The market town (Markt) Gangkofen is in the valley of the river Bina along the federal highway B 388 about 17 & nbsp;km (11 & nbsp;mi) west of [[Eggenfelden]], 26 & nbsp;km (16 & nbsp;mi) south of [[Dingolfing]], 40 & nbsp;km (25 & nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Landshut]], 25 & nbsp;km (16 & nbsp;mi) north of [[Mühldorf]] and 32 & nbsp;km (20 & nbsp;mi) west of the county (district) seat, [[Pfarrkirchen]]. 
 
 Gangkofen is the westernmost municipality of the rural county or district ( " Landkreis " ) named [[Rottal-Inn]], and borders the county of Dingolfing-Landau in the north, the county of Mühldorf in the south and the county of Landshut in the west. Gangkofen is considered part of the historic and geographic Rottal region, because the market town was part of the former county of [[Eggenfelden]] (in the Rott valley) and has stronger economic and cultural ties to the east, than in other directions. The western portions of the political municipality - the former rural towns of Dirnaich and Hölsbrunn- historically belonged to the county of [[Vilsbiburg]] (now part of the county of [[Landshut]]), thus the residents of those parts tend to look to be placed in that direction (the west) even today. 
 
 The political municipality makes up the market town itself and the following villages: Angerbach, Dirnaich, Engersdorf, Hölsbrunn, Kollbach, Malling, Obertrennbach, Panzing, Radlkofen, Reicheneibach und Seemannshausen.
