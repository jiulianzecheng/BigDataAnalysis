 A '''hairdresser''''s job is to organise hair into a particular [[wikt:style|style]] or  " look " . They can cut hair, add [[colour]] to it or [[texture]] it. A hairdresser may be female or male. Qualified staff are usually called  " stylists " , who are supported by assistants. Most hairdressing businesses are unisex, that is, they serve both sexes, and have both sexes on their staff. 
 
 [[Male]] hairdressers who simply cut men's hair (and do not serve females) are often called [[barber]]s. 
 
 Qualifications for hairdressing usually mean a college course, or an [[apprenticeship]] under a senior stylist. Some aspects of the job are quite technical (such as hair [[dying]]) and require careful teaching.
