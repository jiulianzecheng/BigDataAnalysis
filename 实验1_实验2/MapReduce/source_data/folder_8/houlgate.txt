 '''Houlgate''' is a small tourist resort in northwestern [[France]] along the [[English Channel]] with a beach and a casino. It is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Basse-Normandie]] [[Regions of France|region]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 It began as a hamlet in the commune of Beuzeval which was a very old parish and was part of the fiefdom of the Aché (or Achey). There were many different lords because several different families inherited the title through marriage, until gradually the land of the Beuzeval was sold to farmers. The parish was eventually controlled by Houlgate. On the south side of the river Drochon, between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing attracted summer visitors. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Houlgate is located along the [[English Channel]] in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for animal grazing. The town's area is 4.69 & nbsp;km² and the average altitude 5 m. Despite its low average height, the town contains two hills which form the natural limits of the commune.
