 '''Armageddon''' ({{lang-grc|Ἁρμαγεδών}} Harmagedōn, {{lang-he|הר מגידו}}, Har Megiddo, {{lang-ar|أرمجدون}}, {{lang-la|Armagedōn}}) is the place where the great war of the end of day will start. 
 
 Christians that believe that [[Jesus Christ]] will someday come back to earth, translated the sentences of the '''Messiah''' and the '''Lamb of God''', are the symbolism of Jesus, that will return to the earth to fight the [[Antichrist]] (or '''the Beast''') in the battle of ''Armageddon''. After that war [[Satan]] (or the ''Antichrist'') will be thrown to the bottomless pit, or ''Abyss'' for a 1,000 years, known as the ''Millennium Age''. After Satan will be out of the pit, he will gather one man called ''Gog and Magog'' (In the texts he is named ''God and Magog'' but also named ''Gog kind of Magog'', in Jewish texts, the war of Gog and Magog means the attack of Gog kind of Magog to kill all the Jewish people, and [[God]] will kill him and his army. In [[Christianity]], Gog and Magog are two separate people that are Evil.) from the [[Flat Earth|Four corners of the Earth]]. They will trap the ''Holy Ones'' (means Christians) in the ''Beloved City'', (means [[Jerusalem]]). Then Fire will come from [[God]] and from the [[Heaven]]s, and it will destroy Gog and Magog and will trap the [[Devil]] in ''Gehenna'' (Gehinom, Valley of Hinom, a place near Jerusalem, lake of fire and brimstone, also known as [[Hell]]). 
 
 The word ''Armageddon'' appears only once in the ''Greek New Testament''. This word comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Har Megiddo'' ({{lang|hr|הר מגידו}}), which means - ''[[Mountain]] of Megiddo''. In [[Israel]] there is a small city, that is in the Azrieli Vally, called Megiddo. The Mountain of Megiddo is a small mountain which had a big [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort.
