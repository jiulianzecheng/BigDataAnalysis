 A '''market''' is a place where [[wikt:people|people]] go to buy or sell things. When people have [[Product (consumer goods)|products]] to sell, they set up a '''market place'''. There may be a special [[building]] for the market place, or the market may be held in an open space where the sellers can put up a stall (like a kind of [[tent]]) and then take the stall down at the end of the day. 
 
 The word ''' " '''market "  can also have a more general meaning in the [[economy]]. It can mean the way things are bought or sold.  " There is a big market for dishwashers "  means that lots of people want to buy dishwashers. Therefore, a business that makes dishwashers is likely to be able to make a lot of money. When things are sold, people buy the [[Product (consumer goods)|product]], and this  " stimulates the economy "  (helps people to spend and earn money). The market needs to balance [[supply and demand]]. There is no reason to make a supply of dishwashers if people do not want dishwashers. In the market, prices may change quickly if supply or demand changes. 
 
 == Competition == 
 If a seller of a good cannot supply what customers want or asks for a very high price, other sellers may try to supply that good. If other sellers enter the market for that good, in [[competition]], that will tend to fulfill demands and lower prices. Sellers who do not like competition may try to kill their competition. When there is no competition, a [[monopoly]] is formed. Many countries have laws to protect the [[free market]] from monopolies.
