 A '''portrait''' is a [[painting]] or a [[photograph]] of a [[person]]'s [[face]] and its expression. The purpose of a portrait is to show the likeness, [[personality]], and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography, a portrait is actually not a snapshot, but a calm image of a person in a still position. A portrait normally shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer.
