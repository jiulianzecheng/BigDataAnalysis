'''Neutering''' is [[castration]], the act of removing the sexual organs from an animal (usually dogs and cats). Females get spayed, males get fixed. It is regarded by some as important to neuter your pet. It is said to allow them to live longer and healthier lives. Neutering is done by  [[veterinarian|vets]]. 
 
 Humane societies, animal shelters, and rescue groups urge pet owners to have their pets neutered. This prevents the births of unwanted litters, which lead to the increased number of unwanted animals. Some countries  require all adopted cats and dogs be sterilized before going to their new homes.
