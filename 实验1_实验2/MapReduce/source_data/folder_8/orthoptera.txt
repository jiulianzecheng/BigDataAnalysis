 '''Orthoptera''' are an order of [[insect]]s. < ref name=insect > Hoell H.V; Doyen J.T.  &  Purcell A.H. 1998. ''Introduction to insect biology and diversity''. 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, pp. 392–394. {{ISBN|0-19-510033-6}} < /ref >  The order contains [[grasshopper]]s, [[katydid]]s, and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s.  " Ortho "  means  " straight " , so  " Orthoptera "  means  " straight wings " . 
 This means the front [[wing]]s, called ''tegmina'', are [[wikt:stiff|stiff]], [[wikt:straight|straight]], and not used for [[fly]]ing. The back wings are [[membrane|membranous]] and are folded like a [[Fan (machine)|fan]] under the front [[wing]]s when the insect is not flying. Many species use their wings to make sounds, which we usually call  " chirping "  noises. 
 
 == Life cycle == 
 Orthopteran insects start life in an [[egg (biology)|egg]] case. After three weeks – or when [[spring]] comes – the tiny [[nymph]]s come out from the egg case. After four or five [[moulting|molts]], they have wings. This shows that they are adults and are ready to reproduce. 
 
 === Sound production === 
 Their sounds are produced by using file-like edges to their wings, or wing veins. In some groups the wing edges are rubbed together, in others the hind limb is rubbed against a wing edge. Each sound is [[wikt:unique|unique]] to the species, and its function is identification for mating purposes. It is males which make the sound, and females move towards it. < ref name=Rick/ > 
 
 === Diet === 
 In the order Orthoptera, members [[wikt:chew|chew]] their [[food]], using their [[mandible]]s ([[jaw]]s). Crickets are [[omnivore]]s, which means they eat both [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. Actually, they will eat almost anything: [[vegetable]]s, [[cereal]], and even their own [[mate]] if they are [[wikt:hungry|hungry]] enough. Katydids are mostly herbivores (plant eaters), though they will eat their own mate, too, if ''they'' are hungry enough. They also enjoy eating [[aphid]]s and other small, slow-moving creatures. Grasshoppers almost always eat plants like [[grass]], [[wheat]] bran, and [[lettuce]], and they can be terrible [[wikt:crop|crop]] [[pest (biology)|pest]]s. 
 
 === Jumping === 
 It's quite hard to catch a member of Orthoptera because they jump so well. They have amazing legs - a grasshopper can jump 20 times farther than the length of its body. Their back legs are very large and long. These long, strong legs give these insects their great ability to jump. < ref name=Rick > Imes, Rick (1992), The practical entomologist, Simon and Schuster, pp. 74–75, {{ISBN|0-671-74695-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=SHHQVehP488C & pg=PA74] < /ref >

 == Suborders == 
 Crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers are in the same order of Orthoptera because they are alike in many ways. However, there are several things that make them different from each other. 
 
 First, their [[color]]s are usually quite different. Since grasshoppers like to move during the daytime, their colors are similar to grass and bright [[flower]]s, making them usually [[green]], light [[brown]], or multicolored (lots of different colors at once). Crickets move at [[wikt:night|night]], so they are dark. Katydids like to spend a lot of time on [[leaf|leaves]], so they are often leaf-colored, and their wings can look like leaves. Their wings can have the same [[vein]] [[pattern]]s as leaves, and they often have little brown spots just like the ones that might be found on a leaf. 
 
 Secondly, their behaviors are different. Grasshoppers like being active in the day; crickets, at night; katydids, in the late afternoon and evening. 
 
 Thirdly, their [[antenna]]e is different. Katydids and crickets usually have long, thin antennae, while grasshoppers usually have short, thick ones. Of course, this rule does is ''not'' perfect – for instance, even though grasshoppers ''usually'' have short, thick antennae, the long-horned grasshopper has long, thin antennae like a cricket. Because of this, it is still sometimes hard to tell the members of this order apart.
