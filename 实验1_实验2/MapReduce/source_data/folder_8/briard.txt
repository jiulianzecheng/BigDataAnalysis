 [[File:Flevobriards.jpeg|thumb|the two common versions of the Briard]] 
 The '''Briard''' (or '''Berger de Brie''', Shepherd (dog) from Brie) is a [[France|French]] kind of [[dog]]. Originally, the Briard was used for herding [[livestock]]. The Briard is an old race of dogs, which is mentioned in a [[manuscript]] of the 14th century (about [[hunting]]). The Briards exist in different colors, the most common ones are pale brown and black. The Briard is a long-haired breed of dog; the short-haired [[Beauceron]] is probably the same race. The Briard is a [[working dog]] breed; it has also been used as a search-and-rescue dog, and in certain roles as a therapy dog, for example to help people with certain conditions, such as those with [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]].
