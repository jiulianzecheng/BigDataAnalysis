In [[design]] '''planform''' or [[plan view]] is a vertical [[orthographic projection]] of an object on a horizontal [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], like a [[map]]. 
 
 In [[aviation]], a '''planform''' is the shape and layout of an [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]]'s wing. Of all the myriad planforms used, they can typically be grouped into those used for [[low-speed flight]], found on [[general aviation]] aircraft, and those used for  
 [[high-speed flight]], found on many [[military aircraft]] and [[airliner]]s.
