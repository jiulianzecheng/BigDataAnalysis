 '''Galeras''' ('''Urcunina''' among the 16th-century [[native people]]) is an [[Andes|Andean]] [[stratovolcano]] in the [[Colombia]]n department of Nariño, near the departmental capital [[Pasto]]. Its peak rises {{convert|4276|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]]. It has erupted many times since the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest]]. Its first historical [[eruption]] was recorded on December 7, 1580. < ref > {{in lang|es}} [http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/geografia/pasto/parte1/cap3-13.htm PASTO: Geographical, Economics and Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211634/http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/geografia/pasto/parte1/cap3-13.htm |date=2016-03-03 }} < /ref >  A 1993 eruption killed nine people, including six scientists who had gone down into the volcano's crater to take samples of gases and measure gravity in an attempt to be able to predict future eruptions. < ref > [http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/article/eruption-survivorx2019s-tale Eruption: A Survivor's Tale], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] < /ref >  It is currently the most active volcano in Colombia. 
 
 == Geological history == 
 Galeras has been an active volcano for at least a million years. Its dominant product is andesite, an [[igneous rock]] . < ref name= " gvp "  / >  Two major [[caldera]]-forming eruptions have occurred: the first was about 560,000 years ago in an eruption which expelled about {{convert|15|km3}} of material. The second was some time between 40,000 and 150,000 years ago, in a smaller but still sizable eruption of {{convert|2|km3}} of material. Since that second eruption, part of the caldera wall has collapsed, possibly due to instabilities caused by hydrothermal (high-temperature water) activity, and later eruptions have built up a smaller cone inside the now [[horseshoe]]-shaped caldera. 
 
 In light of its violent eruptive history and proximity to the 450,000 & nbsp;people of Pasto, Galeras was designated a  " Decade Volcano "  in 1991. This identified it as a target for detailed study as part of the [[United Nations]]'  " International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction " . 
 
 == Eruptive history == 
 
 Galeras is considered the most active volcano in Colombia, followed by [[Nevado del Ruiz]]. Its earliest activity during the [[Holocene]] has been dated at 7050 [[Anno Domini|BC]] ± 1000 years through [[radiocarbon dating]]. Other eruptions similar to this event include those in 3150 & nbsp;BC ± 200 years, 2580 & nbsp;BC ± 500 years, 1160 & nbsp;BC ± 300 years, 490 & nbsp;BC ± 100 years, and in 890 [[Anno Domini|AD]] ± 200 years. Typically these eruptions consist of a central vent explosion, conducive to an explosive eruption causing [[pyroclastic flow]]s and/or [[lahar]]s. Eruptions in more recent times, which have been recorded consist of those in 1535, December 1580, July 1616, 1641, 1670, 1754, November 1796, June 1823, October 1828, 1834, October 1865, July 1889, 1891, December 1923, October 1924, October 1932, February 1936, July 1947, January 1950, 1974, February 1989, January 1990, January 1993, March 2000, June 2002, July 2004, November 2005, and October 2007. Reported incidents with no official proof occurred in 1836, 1930, 1933, and 1973. < ref name= " gvp "  / > 
 
 === 1993 eruption === 
 Galeras became active again in 1988 after 10 years of dormancy. 
 
 A Decade Volcano conference in the city of Pasto, in 1993, ended in disaster when several of the scientists present mounted an impromptu (unscheduled) expedition on 14 January to the crater of Galeras. An eruption occurred unexpectedly while they were at the summit (highest point), resulting in the deaths of six scientists and three tourists. < ref name=Baxter1993 > Baxter  &  Gresham, 1993 < /ref > 
 
 Elements in the media made the event controversial. They suggested that the expedition leader, geologist Stanley Williams, who survived along with four others, had ignored safety procedures. A prediction had been made three days before the eruption, based on B-Type activity seen on a [[seismograph]]. Seismic B-types had been used successfully to predict eruptions on other volcanoes. However, the prediction was based simply on the one seismographic printout viewed in the light of previous history of Galeras, without any additional scientific measurements showing any serious activity within the volcano.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

 Activity at a low level has continued at Galeras. Small explosions occasionally cause [[volcanic ash|ash]] to fall on nearby villages and towns. The volcano has continued to be well-studied, and predictions of eruptions at the volcano have improved. One phenomenon, which seems to be a reliable precursor to eruptive activity, is a low-frequency seismic event known as a  " tornillo event " . These have occurred before about eighty percent (80%) of the explosions at Galeras, and the number of tornillo events recorded before an eruption is also [[correlation|correlated]] with the size of the eruption that followed. 
 
 More than 100 & nbsp;minor tremors were felt during a major eruption in April 2002, although no damage or injury was reported. An eruption in November 2005 forced an evacuation of the dangerous area surrounding the volcano, and about 9,400 & nbsp;people from nearby villages (most of them farmers) were ordered to leave. The city of Pasto, about {{convert|9|km}} from the volcano, was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion, forcing the residents to put on goggles and face masks. 
 
 Numerous minor tremors and ash emissions since March 2006 culminated on 12 July 2006 in three explosive eruptions, producing an ash and gas column reaching an altitude of {{convert|8|km}}. Rock falls and [[pyroclastic flow]]s were reported from towns as distant as Consacá, {{convert|11.4|km}} west of the main crater. The Colombian government has repeatedly ordered evacuations to temporary shelters, of more than 8500 & nbsp;people residing in the highest risk areas surrounding the volcano, < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5176234.stm Colombia volcano provokes alert], BBC News, July 13, 2006 < /ref > < ref name= " reliefweb " > {{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/VBOL-6RNGLQ?OpenDocument |title=Colombia: Reporte de actividad eruptiva de Galeras, Julio 13 de 2006 – Colombia  & #124; ReliefWeb |publisher=reliefweb.int|access-date=2015-09-03}} < /ref >  with hopes of eventual assistance toward permanent relocation. < ref name= " reliefweb2 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KKEE-6R7M3C?OpenDocument |title=Colombia: Galeras Volcano OCHA Situation Report No. 4 – Colombia  & #124; ReliefWeb |publisher=reliefweb.int|access-date=2015-09-03}} < /ref > 
 
 On January 17, 2008, the volcano erupted around 20:06 (local) (01:06 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). There were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. Later the experts confirmed partial damage in the national and local TV towers. < ref name= " ingeominas " > {{cite web|url=http://intranet.ingeominas.gov.co/pasto/images/7/75/Crateres_de_impacto_erupcion_Galeras_ene_17_2008_sector_sur_crater.jpg |title=Image: Crateres_de_impacto_erupcion_Galeras_ene_17_2008_sector_sur_crater.jpg, (2000 × 1500 px) |publisher=intranet.ingeominas.gov.co |access-date=2015-09-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005180544/http://intranet.ingeominas.gov.co/pasto/images/7/75/Crateres_de_impacto_erupcion_Galeras_ene_17_2008_sector_sur_crater.jpg |archive-date=2011-10-05 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/17/international/i202255S91.DTL | title = Few persuaded to flee Colombia volcano | publisher = [[The Associated Press]] via [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = January 17, 2008 }} < /ref > 
 
 Then, on February 14, 2009, the volcano erupted around 19:10 (local) (00:10 UTC). < ref name= " 8,000 evacuated as Colombia volcano stirs: officials " > {{cite news | title = 8,000 evacuated as Colombia volcano stirs: officials |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvrQSoNBVjP5jhm1Fv_2oh43T9nA | date = February 15, 2009}} < /ref >  Some 8,000 residents were evacuated, and there were no immediate reports of injuries or serious property damage. As in 2005, the city of Pasto was blanketed by a layer of ash after the volcanic explosion (due to the direction of the wind). The local authorities ordered two [[water treatment]] plants near Galeras to shut down. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.pr-inside.com/galeras-volcano-erupts-in-southwestern-colombia-r1060096.htm |title=Galeras volcano erupts in southwestern Colombia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=PR-Inside.com |date=February 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220223555/http://www.pr-inside.com/galeras-volcano-erupts-in-southwestern-colombia-r1060096.htm |archive-date=2009-02-20 }} < /ref > 
 
 On March 13, 2009, Galeras erupted twice: at around 15:55 and 17:00 (local time). Ash fell on Pasto and some other towns near the volcano. The city and towns' evacuation was ordered, but reportedly ignored. No injuries or damage were reported. < ref > [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/STRI-7Q8TFP?OpenDocument Eruptions of Galeras Volcano Situation Report No 1], United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 16 March 2009. < /ref > 
 
 === 2010 eruption === 
 The volcano erupted on January 3, 2010, forcing the evacuation of 8,000 people. < ref name= " TVNZ_3323350 " > {{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/evacuation-after-colombia-volcano-erupts-3323350 |title=Evacuation after Colombia volcano erupts |date=3 January 2010 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |access-date=2011-09-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919192904/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/evacuation-after-colombia-volcano-erupts-3323350 |archive-date=2011-09-19 }} < /ref >  This was the tenth such eruption of the volcano in the previous year, and the first of 2010. Colombian authorities also stated that it could remain volatile in the weeks to come. 
 
 Galeras erupted again on August 25, 2010, with an ash plume visible in the air. The eruption, which was described as non-explosive, caused authorities to raise an alert for neighbouring towns. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/08/25/colombia.volcano/index.html?hpt=Sbin | work=CNN | title='Red alert' issued for Colombian volcano after non-explosive eruption | date=August 26, 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project.
