 '''Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S.''' is a [[France|French]] [[supercar]] company currently owned by [[Volkswagen]]. They made cars back in the early 1900s. They made cars such as the [[Bugatti Veyron]]. Unlike the regular Veyron, with 300 produced, there are only 20 supersport versions, which used to hold the record for world's fastest car at 267mph. However, that record has been broken by the new Bugatti Chiron, breaking the 300mph barrier. All Bugattis have a 16-cylinder engine and all cost between $1.8 million to $2.2 million (not counting the extras).
