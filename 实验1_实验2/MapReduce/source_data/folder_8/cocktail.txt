 A '''cocktail''' is a kind of mixed [[drink]]. < ref > " cocktail – Definition of cocktail in English by Oxford Dictionaries " . Oxford Dictionaries – English. [https://www.lexico.com/definition/cocktail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924094302/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cocktail |date=2017-09-24 }} < /ref >  Usually, it is made with [[alcohol]]ic drinks such as [[vodka]], [[gin]] or [[rum]]. Since such spirits do not have much taste of their own (at around 40% alcohol), other [[ingredient]]s are added. Common ingredients are fruits, fruit juice, sugar, crushed ice, and [[ice cube]]s. If the cocktail is served in a [[Bar (business)|bar]] or [[nightclub]], it often comes with a piece of fruit on top. For example, a gin and tonic could have a [[lemon]], a Piña Colada could have a [[pineapple]] and a [[cherry]]. A popular cocktail in Cornwall UK is the McVey, 440ml of strongbow and 125ml of Malibu. 
 
 Most cocktails were invented in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. People began drinking a lot of cocktails in the United States in the 1920s due to [[Prohibition Era|Prohibition]]. < ref >  Mixologist. Volume two, The journal of the American cocktail. Brown, Jared M. Miller, Anistatia R. London: Mixellany. 2006. ISBN 978-0-9760937-1-8.  < /ref >  Around that time, cocktails from Cuba, such as the mojito, became popular around the world. 
 
 Cocktails made without alcohol are also made. 
 
 Because all the ingredients give their flavor to the finished drink, a cocktail is only as good as the worst ingredient.
