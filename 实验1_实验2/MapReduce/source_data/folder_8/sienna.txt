 Siena began as [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], before it was conquered by [[Ancient Rome]]. Sienna prospered under the [[Lombards]], who became the first Kings of Italy. Lombard nobles governed it until the 8th century, when they were conquered by [[Charlemagne]] and his [[Franks]]. [[Feudal]] rule eded with the death of the [[Countess Matilda]] in 1115, and Sienna became an independent city with its own [[government]]. There were struggles between Siena and [[Florence]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[renaissance]]. The city did well in [[wool]] and [[money lending]] or [[usury]], the charging of [[interest]] on [[loan]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 - 900 to 400 BC: Sienna, like other [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] hill towns were occuped by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] that changed the territories with their technology of [[irrigation]]. 
 
 - 390 [[Battle of the Allia]] 
 
 - At the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]], a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] town called ''Saena Julia '' in the territories previously occupied by Etruscans. 
 
 - Siena did not prosper under Roman rule. It was not sited near any major roads and therefore missed out on the resulting opportunities for trade. 
 
 - 774 BC: the oldest [[aristocratic]] families in Sienna date their line to the Lombards' surrender to [[Charlemagne]]. 
 
 - 1115: the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany|Countess Matilda]], an important point for the history of Sienna, because after this the [[Marches|Mark]] of Tuscia which had been under the control of her family – the Canossa – broke up into several [[autonomy|autonomous regions]]. 
 
 - Sienna became a major center of money lending and an important for trade. It was governed at first directly by its [[Bishop]]. 
 
 - During the 1100s: power of Bishop lost energy and at the same thime the biggest build of Sienna, the Duomo, was completed. 
 
 - 1167: Sienna, after a trouble about territories with [[Arezzo]], became independence from the Bishop. 
 
 - 1179: Sienna had a written constitution. 
 
 - Early 12th century a self-governing [[medieval commune|commune]] replaced the earlier aristocratic government. The consuls who governed the republic slowly became more inclusive of the ''poblani'', or common people, and the [[Commune]] increased its territory as the surrounding feudal nobles in their fortified castles submitted to the urban power. Sienna's [[republic]], struggling internally between nobles and the popular party, usually worked in political opposition to its great rival, [[Florence]]. 
 
 - 1203: [[University of Siena|Siena's university]] was founded. 
 
 - 4 September 1260: the Senese [[Ghibellines]], supported by the forces of King [[Manfred of Sicily]], defeated the Florentine [[Guelphs]] in the [[Battle of Montaperti]]. 
 
 -1348: Sienna was devastated by the [[Black Death]]. 
 
 - 1355: with [[Charles IV of Luxembourg]] in the city, the population rose and suppressed the government of the ''[[Noveschi|Nove]]'' (Nine), establishing that ''Dodici'' (Twelve) nobles assisted by a group with a popular majority. 
 
 - Years later gave the power [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] of [[Milan]] in order to defend it from the Florentine attacks. 
 
 - 1404: the Visconti were expelled and a government of Ten Priors established, in alliance with Florence against King [[Ladislas of Naples]]. With the election of the Sienese [[Pius II]] as Pope, the Piccolomini and other noble families were helped to return to the government, but after his death the control returned into popular hands. 
 
 - 1472: the Republic founded the [[monte dei paschi di siena|Monte dei Paschi]], a bank that is still active today and is the oldest surviving bank in the world. 
 
 - 1487: The noble [[legacy]] returned in the city under [[Pandolfo Petrucci]] with the support of [[Florence]] and of [[Alfonso of Calabria]]; 
 
 - Pandolfo was succeeded by his son [[Borghese Petrucci|Borghese]], who was ousted by his cousin [[Raffaello Petrucci|Raffaello]], helped by the Medici [[Pope Leo X]]. The last Petrucci was [[Fabio Petrucci|Fabio]], exiled in 1523 by the Sienese people. 
 
 - Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] took advantage of the chaotic situation to put a Spanish [[garrison]] in Sienna. The citizens expelled the garrison in 1552, and made allies with [[France]]. This was unacceptable for Charles, who sent his general [[Gian Giacomo Medici]] to lay siege to it with a Florentine-Imperial army. 
 
 - August 1554: Sienna lost against Florence at the [[Battle of Marciano]]. After 18 months of resistance, it surrendered to Florence on 17 April 1555, marking the end of the [[Republic of Siena]]. The new Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], owing huge sums to the [[Medici]], gave it (apart from some coastal fortresses) to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], 
 
 - Until the [[unification of Italy]] Sienna was controlled by Florence. 
 
 The city is an important centre for [[art]] and [[culture]].
