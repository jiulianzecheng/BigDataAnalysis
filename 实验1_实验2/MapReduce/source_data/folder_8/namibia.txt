 The '''Republic of Namibia''' is a [[country]] in southern [[Africa]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. It is bordered by [[Angola]] and [[Zambia]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east, and [[South Africa]] to the south. It does not border [[Zimbabwe]], but it is very close to it. It gained [[independence]] from South Africa in [[1990]]. Before that it was called '''South West Africa'''. Its [[capital (city)|capital]] is [[Windhoek]]. 
 
 Before [[World War I]] Namibia was a [[German Empire|German]] colony. [[German language|German]] is still widely spoken in the country, although [[English language|English]] is the official language. 
 
 Namibia has a population of 2.1 million people. 
 
 The name of the country is from the [[Namib Desert]].  This is said to be the oldest desert in the world. < ref > [http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/at/at1315_full.html Namib desert (AT1315)] [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] site on the Namib Desert < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The dry lands of Namibia were lived in since early times by [[Bushmen]], [[Damara (people)|Damara]] and [[Nama people|Nama]]. About the 14th century AD, [[Bantu people|Bantu]] came to the area from central Africa. From the late 18th century onwards, [[Orlam]] clans from the [[Cape Colony]] crossed the [[Orange River]].  They moved into the area that today is southern Namibia. < ref name= " KDA " > {{cite web|url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm|last=Dierks|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Dierks|title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, A|accessdate=24 June 2010}} < /ref >  The nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries with the Orlams were well received by them, < ref name= " Dierks " > {{cite web|last=Dierks|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Dierks|title=Warmbad becomes two hundred years|url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Warm_Bath/index.htm|accessdate=22 June 2010|archive-date=21 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821172028/http://www.klausdierks.com/Warm_Bath/index.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  the right to use waterholes and grazing was given. On their way further north, the Orlams met clans of the [[Herero people|Herero]] tribe.  They were not as friendly. The [[Nama-Herero War]] started in 1880.  They did not stop until [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] sent troops. 
 
 The first Europeans to explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486. Like most of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not largely explored by Europeans until the 19th century.  At this time traders and settlers arrived, mostly from Germany and Sweden.  
 
 ===German rule=== 
 Namibia became a German colony in 1884.  This was to stop the British.  The country was called [[German South-West Africa]]. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}} < /ref >    From 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Namaqua]] took up arms against the Germans.  In the following [[:en:Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide|Herero and Namaqua genocide]], 10,000 Nama (half the population) and about 65,000 Hereros (about 80% of the population) were killed. 
 
 ===South African rule=== 
 [[South Africa]] began to rule the land in 1915.  They defeated the German force during [[World War I]].  It was a [[League of Nations]] [[mandate territory]] from 1919.  In 1946 the League was replaced by the United Nations.  South Africa would not give up their rule of the land.  Many people thought the land should be independent from South Africa.  In 1971 South Africa was told their hold on the country was illegal. < ref > {{Cite web  | publisher=Armed Conflict Events Database  | title = Namibian War of Independence 1966–1988  | url = http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/november/namibia1966.htm  | accessdate =30 November 2009}} < /ref >   They still did not leave. 
 
 The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990. [[Sam Nujoma]] became the first [[List of Presidents of Namibia|President of Namibia]].

 ==Tourism== 
 [[File:Equus burchelli 4.jpg|thumb|An example of Namibian wildlife, the [[Plains Zebra]], one focus of tourism]] 
 Tourism is a major contributor (14.5%) to Namibia's economy.  It creates tens of thousands of jobs (18.2% of all employment).  There are over a million tourists per year. < ref > {{cite web|title=A Framework/Model to Benchmark Tourism GDP in South Africa|publisher=Pan African Research  &  Investment Services|page=34|date=March 2010|url=http://www.southafrica.net/sat/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=29571|access-date=2012-09-03|archive-date=2010-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718143151/http://www.southafrica.net/sat/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=29571|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The country is among the main tourist places in Africa and is known for [[ecotourism]] which features Namibia's extensive and diverse wildlife. < ref name=goodshape > {{cite news

 There are many lodges and reserves for tourists. Sport Hunting is also a large, and growing part of the Namibian economy.  It was 14% of total tourism in the year 2000. Namibia has numerous species wanted by international sport hunters. < ref > Humavindu, Michael N., Barnes, Jonothan I. Trophy Hunting in the Namibian Economy: An Assessment. Environmental Economics Unit, Directorate of Environmental Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia. South African Journal of Wildlife Research 33(2): 65–70 October 2003 < /ref >  In addition, extreme sports such as [[sandboarding]] and 4x4ing have become popular. Many cities have companies that provide tours. The most visited places include the [[Caprivi Strip]], [[Fish River Canyon]], [[Sossusvlei]], the [[Skeleton Coast]] Park, [[Sesriem]], [[Etosha Pan]] and the coastal towns of [[Swakopmund]], [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Lüderitz]].
