 '''Consensus''' is a term which describes general [[:wikt:agreement|agreement]] among members of a group or [[community]].  It also means the [[theory]] and process of bringing a group together in agreement. < ref > Shutt, Randy, [http://www.vernalproject.org/papers/process/ConsensusNotUnanimity.html   " Consensus Is Not Unanimity: Making Decisions Cooperatively, " ] Vernal Education Project; retrieved 2013-1-25. < /ref >   
 
 ==Not majority rule== 
 The cooperative spirit of consensus is different from the competitive spirit which is brought to a point in majority voting.  According to Wikipedia founder [[Jimmy Wales]], 
 < blockquote > We are really strongly focused on consensus. One criticism of Wikipedia is that the majority rules. But majority is not the right way to describe it. We strive for consensus rather than majority rule. If you are in a group of five or ten people working on an article, if 30 percent of those working on the article dissent, then continue to write the article until all but the most unreasonable agree. Those who continue to disagree are typically exhibiting non-collaborative, and sometimes abusive, behavior. < ref > Farber, Dan.
