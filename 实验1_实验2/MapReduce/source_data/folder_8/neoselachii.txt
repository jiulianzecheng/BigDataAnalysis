 The '''Neoselachii''' are an important group of [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish in the [[subclass (biology)|subclass]] [[Elasmobranchii]], [[class]] [[Chondrichthyes]].  
 
 The group is important because it includes all [[Extant|living]]  [[shark]]s, [[skate (fish)|skates]],  and [[Batoidea|rays]]. They rapidly diversified during the [[Upper Triassic]]. 
 
 The group is descended from a primitive type of shark in the [[Devonian |Devonian period]]. < ref > Underwood C.J. 2006.
