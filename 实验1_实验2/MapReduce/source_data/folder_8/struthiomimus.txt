 '''''Struthiomimus''''' was a long-legged, [[ostrich]]-like [[dinosaur]] of the [[ornithomimid]] family.  
 It lived in what is now [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 75 to 65 million years ago. 
 
 ==Description== 
 ''Struthiomimus'' is known from several skeletons and skulls. < ref name= " PJC05 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaurprovinci0000unse|title=Dinosaur Provincial Park: a spectacular ancient ecosystem revealed|last=Currie|first=Philip J.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-253-34595-2|editor=Currie, Phillip J.|location=Bloomington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaurprovinci0000unse/page/367 367]–397|chapter=Theropods, including birds|editor-last2=Koppelhus, Eva}} < /ref >

 As with other ornithomimids, it had a small slender head on a long neck. The neck was about 40% of the length of the body in front of the hips. < ref name=PJC05/ >  Its eyes were large and its jaws were toothless. Its [[vertebra]]l column had ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, six hip vertebrae, and about thirty-five tail vertebrae. < ref name= " MKC04 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/801843269|title=The dinosauria|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94143-4|edition=2nd|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=801843269}} < /ref >  The tail was stiff and was probably used for balance. < ref name=HFO17 > {{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |title=Skeletal adaptations of ''Ornitholestes'', ''Struthiomimus'', ''Tyrannosaurus'' |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=35 |pages=733–771 |year=1917 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/1334/1/B035a43.pdf |access-date=2012-05-22 |archive-date=2007-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720115637/http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/1334/1/B035a43.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It ground food up in its [[gizzard]], and may have been [[herbivorous]] or [[omnivorous]]. < ref > Barrett, Paul M 2005.
