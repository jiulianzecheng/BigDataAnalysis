'''Elsagate''' is a [[neologism]] referring to a controversy about videos posted on YouTube and YouTube Kids. The videos were titled family friendly, but contained [[innapropriate themes]] such as [[graphic violence]], [[Human sexuality|sexual content]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], [[Profanity|vulgar language]], [[Illegal drugs|drugs]], [[alcohol]], [[Injection|injections]], [[Disease|diseases]], [[crude humour]] and dangerous activities. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2017-11-19|title=YouTube Promises Crackdown On Disturbing And Sexually Violent Gore Videos Targeted At Children [Opinion]|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4619073/youtube-promises-crackdown-on-disturbing-and-sexually-violent-gore-videos-targeted-at-children/|access-date=2023-07-27|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119030514/https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4619073/youtube-promises-crackdown-on-disturbing-and-sexually-violent-gore-videos-targeted-at-children/|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 The videos showed characters from family-oriented media, mostly used without any legal permission, thus having no restrictions to the characters' usage limits. The term was created through a mix between [[Disney]]'s [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] character, frequently featured in the videos, and the suffix  " -gate " , used for [[Scandal|scandals]]. A few channels, such as [[Toy Freaks]], featured real children for videos, raising concern from the public about the chance of [[child abuse]] being involved. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
