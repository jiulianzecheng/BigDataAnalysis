 '''Snowpack''' is [[snow]] that has built up over time in an area. It is made of layers of [[snow]] that collect in geographic areas and at high elevations, where it is cold for large parts of the year. Snowpacks feed streams and [[river]]s when they melt and are important water resources. In many communities, snowpack is the main source of drinking water. When snowpack melts quickly, it can cause [[flash flood]]ing. 
 
 Understanding snowpacks is important in the study and prediction of [[avalanche]]s. < ref > {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_SNr4LPdUQC & pg=PA346 |pages=346â€“347|title=Mountaineering|isbn=9781594851292|last1=Cox|first1=Steven M.|last2=Fulsaas|first2=Kris}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|first1=Tobias|last1=Kurzeder|first2=Holger|last2=Feist|title=Powderguide: Managing Avalanche Risk|publisher=Mountain Sports Press|isbn=978-0972482738}} < /ref >
