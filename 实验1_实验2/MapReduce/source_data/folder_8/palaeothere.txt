 '''Palaeotheres''' are an [[extinct]] group of [[herbivorous]] [[mammals]]. They are related to [[tapir]]s and [[rhinoceros]], and probably ancestral to [[horse]]s. They ranged across [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] during the [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] 55{{ndash}}28 million years ago. 
 
 They were small to medium-sized. They lived in dense [[forest]]s. They ate soft leaves, shoots, berries, and leaf matter picked up from the forest floor.
