 A '''whip''' is a long strand of [[leather]] or other [[fabric]] with a hard handle. When a person shakes a whip fast, it makes a loud  " crack "  sound, because it has broken the [[sound barrier]]. It is used for directing or [[hit]]ting animals or people. Some whips are made for [[corporal punishment]].
