 '''WAV''' (or '''WAVE'''), short for '''Waveform Audio File Format''', is a [[Microsoft]] and [[International Business Machines|IBM]] [[audio file format]] standard for storing an audio [[bitstream]] on [[personal computer|PCs]].  It resembles the [[Resource Interchange File Format|RIFF]] [[bitstream format]] in the sense that it stores data in “chunks”. It is also close to the [[Interchange File Format|IFF]] and the [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] format used on [[Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers, respectively. It is the main format used on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] systems for raw and typically uncompressed audio. The default bitstream encoding is the Microsoft [[Linear pulse code modulation|Pulse Code Modulation]] (LPCM) format, although other codecs, such as [[MP3]], are allowed as well.
