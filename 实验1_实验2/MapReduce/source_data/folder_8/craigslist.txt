 '''Craigslist''' is a centralized network of online [[Community|communities]] for free [[Classified advertising|classified advertisements]] (with jobs, [[Internship|internships]], housing, personal advertisements, erotic services, for [[:wikt:sale|sale]]/[[barter]]/wanted, services, community, and pets categories) and [[Internet forum|forums]] on various topics. 
 
 == Description == 
 The service was founded in 1995 by [[Craig Newmark]] for the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. After incorporation as a private for-profit company in 1999, Craigslist expanded into nine more [[United States|U.S.]] cities in 2000, four each in 2001 and 2002, and 14 in 2003. By September 2007, Craigslist had established itself in approximately 450 cities in 50 countries. 
 
 In 2007 Craigslist operated with a staff of 24 people. < ref > {{cite web|accessdate=May 8, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2007-01-02-terror-war-business-usat_x.htm|title=Can small businesses help win the war?|work=[[USA Today]]|date=January 2, 2007}} < /ref > 
 Its sole source of [[revenue]] is paid job ads in select cities ($75 per ad for the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; $25 per ad for [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and recently [[Portland, Oregon]]) and paid broker apartment listings in New York City ($10 per ad). 
 
 The site serves over nine billion page views per month, putting it in 56th place overall among web sites worldwide, ninth place overall among web sites in the United States (per [[Alexa.com]] on January 10, 2008), to over thirty million unique visitors. With over thirty million new classified advertisements each month, Craigslist < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.vizaca.com/craigslist-complete-guide/|title=Craigslist Complete Insight Guide (You Must Know in 2020)|last=#|date=February 20, 2020|website=Vizaca|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}} < /ref >  is the leading classifieds service in any medium. The site receives over two million new job listings each month. So it is one of the top job boards in the world. < ref > {{cite web  | url = http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_SellingOnline_Nov05.pdf  | title = Selling items online  | author = Lenhart, Amanda, Shermak, Jeremy  | date = 2006  | publisher = [[Pew Research Center]]  | accessdate = September 6, 2007  | archive-date = July 14, 2007  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714052427/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_SellingOnline_Nov05.pdf  | url-status = dead  }} < /ref > 
 
 == Criticism == 
 * In July 2005, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' criticized Craigslist for allowing ads from dog breeders, and thereby allegedly encouraging the over breeding and irresponsible selling of pit bulls in the Bay Area. < ref > {{cite web  | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/07/11/MNGJ2DLUUH1.DTL  | title = Craigslist pressured to ban dog, cat ads  | author = Ilene Lelchuk  | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle  | date = July 11, 2005  | accessdate = September 6, 2007}} < /ref > 
 * In January 2006, the ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'' published an editorial criticizing Craigslist for moving into local communities and  " threatening to eviscerate "  local alternative newspapers. Craigslist has been compared to [[Wal-Mart]], a multinational corporation that some feel crushes small local businesses when they move into towns and offer a huge assortment of goods at cheaper prices. < ref > {{cite web  | url = http://www.sfbg.com/40/18/x_editors_notes.html  | title = Editor's Notes  | author = Tim Redmond  | work = [[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]  | date = July 11, 2005  | accessdate = September 6, 2007  | archive-date = December 5, 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205041004/http://www.sfbg.com/40/18/x_editors_notes.html  | url-status = dead  }} < /ref > 
 * In August 2007, Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin wrote a letter to Craigslist asking the company to take steps to avoid unwittingly enabling child prostitution through its classified ads. < ref > {{cite web  | url = http://www.techmeme.com/070823/p28#a070823p28  | title = Mayor rips craigslist over child prostitution  | author = David Pendered  | publisher = agc.com  | date = August 22, 2007}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|title=Atlanta mayor says Craigslist used for child prostitution|work=San Francisco Business Times|date=August 22, 2007|accessdate=January 29, 2008|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/08/20/daily24.html?jst=s_cn_hl}} < /ref > 
 
 == Nonprofit foundation == 
 In 2001, the company started the Craigslist Foundation, a [[§]] [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization that helps emerging nonprofit organizations get established, gain visibility, attract the attention of potential donors, and develop the skills and knowledge required for long-term success. 
 
 It accepts charitable donations, and rather than directly funding organizations, it produces face-to-face events and offers online resources to help grassroots organizations get off the ground and contribute real value to the community.
