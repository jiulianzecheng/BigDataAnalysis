 == History == 
 In 1178, the [[castle]] of Rocha Forcha was built by the bishops of the [[arrondissement of Die]] as a stronghold against the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. It belonged to French lords until the year 1766. The last one, Lord Rey de Noinville, died that year. In 1796, a French trader, Pierre Jossaud bought the land surrounding the castle and renamed it Rochefourchat. The commune has been passed down through Jossaud's family.
