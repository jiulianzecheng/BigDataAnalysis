 The word '''oil''' is used for many different kinds of [[liquid]]s. Oil usually does not mix with water. 
 
 [[Vegetable oil]]s are made from [[plant]]s. Many are used in [[food]]s and for [[cooking]]. Some kinds of [[Cooking oil|plant oils]] that people use are [[palm oil]], [[maize]] (''corn''), [[Olive (fruit)|olive]], [[peanut]], [[soy bean|soy]], and [[sunflower]]. 
 
 Other kinds of oil are made from [[petroleum|crude oil]] (''petroleum''), which comes from under the ground. People use large [[oil well]]s to bring the oil up to the surface. The oil is sent in special [[ship]]s called [[tanker]]s or in [[pipeline]]s to [[factory|factories]] called [[oil refinery|refineries]] where it is distilled into [[LPG]], [[gasoline]] (''petrol''), [[diesel fuel]], and fuel oil. [[Plastic]]s are among the [[petrochemical]]s made from crude oil or [[natural gas]]. Oils from crude oil are also used as [[fuel]]s for [[engine]]s or as [[lubricant]]s to make the parts of machines work together without sticking or stopping. 
 
 Different kinds of oils are also used for many other things, for example, to make [[cosmetics]], [[medicine]]s, [[paint]]s, and [[detergent]]s, like washing up liquids. Soap(s) are similar to detergents, but they are generally made from animal fat(s) rather than oils. 
 
 Oil is also made for various purposes, including [[synthetic fuel]] and [[lubricant]]. 
 
 See [[Thomas Gold]] for the idea that oils come from space.
