 '''Cholesterol''' is a [[molecule]] that is found in animal [[cell]]s and body fluids. Cholesterol is not found in plant sources. It is a type of [[lipid]] which is a [[fat]] or fat-like molecule.  Cholesterol is a soft waxy substance. Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a [[steroid]]. Steroids are lipids that have a special [[chemical]] [[structure]]. This structure is made of four rings of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s. Cholesterol is found especially in [[animal]] [[fat]]s. 
 
 Cholesterol is the main steroid synthesized by animals. Other steroids include [[hormone]] steroids like [[cortisol]], [[estrogen]], and [[testosterone]]. These and other steroid hormones are made by changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol. This is an example of ''[[chemical synthesis]]''. 
 
 [[Hypercholesterolemia]] means that cholesterol level is too high in the blood. High cholesterol levels show that heart disease may develop.
