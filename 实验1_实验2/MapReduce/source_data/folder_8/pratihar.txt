In the mid 9th century, the Gurjjaras rose to the imperial heights in the north and western India under their patriarch Bhoja I. However, after his demise, the empire could not be held together for long. His son Mahendrapala-I could maintain his father's empire. He is known to have enlarged it towards the east, and his son Mahipala extended the realm deeper in the Western Himalayan interiors. The Imperial Gurjjaras ruled uninterruptedly for about four centuries since their rise in the 6th century, until Kanauj fell under the attack of Mahmud of Ghazni. During that period, not only they held their realm together, but also buttressed it up against the foreign attacks and aggressions.}} < /ref >
