 The '''truth''' is what is true. It may be everything that is true ([[reality]]) or just a part of it (a [[fact]]). It may also be a statement that is true: a truth. Things or statements that are not true are untrue or false. True things exist (or have existed); false things do not (or never have). 
 
 [[Aristotle]] said:  " To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true. " < ref name=StanfordCorr > David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1  " Correspondence Theory of Truth " ] in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy < /ref >  However, a statement may be about how things once were; this would be a true statement if it is clear that it is not a statement about how things are now. Most often, the [[tense (grammar)|tense]] of the verb will indicate this, but there may be other ways in which the statement is qualified: for example, by saying when the statement was true. 
 
 Truth is a [[noun]], and the corresponding [[adjective]] is '''''true'''''. The word ''true'' also functions as a noun, a [[verb]] and an [[adverb]]. The English word ''[[wikt:truth|truth]]'' is from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe''. 
 
 Most of the discussion on truth is about one of two things: 
 #How to find out whether a statement (a [[proposition]] or claim) is true 
 #How to find the truth when presented with a particular question or problem 
 Many [[philosopher]]s have given opinions on these issues. 
 
 == Examples == 
 
 * It is a truth (true) that a [[dog]] is an [[animal]]. It is ''untrue'' (or ''false'') that a dog is a [[plant]]. 
 * It is a truth that [[dodo]]s ''were'' found on [[Mauritius]] (although not throughout the past). It is not true that dodos exist. 
 * It has never been true that [[unicorn]]s exist, so it has always been true that unicorns do not exist. 
 
 == In Other words == 
 Something untrue is [[false]]. A half truth is something true mixed with something false, or something partly true with key information omitted. 
 
 If the things one says are true, then they are speaking the truth, or speaking truly. Saying something that is untrue can be called a [[lie]], if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue. A person who says something untrue is often called a  " liar " . 
 
 == True and false in logic and philosophy ==

 ''True'' is also one of the two [[basic]] [[value]]s of [[logic]]. The other such value is usually called ''false''. In symbols, ''true'' is written as, T or 1. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-04-06|title=Comprehensive List of Logic Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/logic-symbols/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Truth-value {{!}} logic|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/truth-value|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Aristotle]] was the first to put logic into a formal [[framework]]. His version is called [[propositional logic]] (see also [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]]). Other forms of logic use types of mathematics ([[mathematical logic]]) or [[symbol]]s. [[Boolean algebra]] is about things being true and false. 
 
 The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. 
 
 [[Philosophy|Philosophers]] argue over what makes up truth and how to define and identify truth.
