 '''Rubella''' (also known as '''German measles''') is a [[disease]] caused by the '''''Rubella [[virus]]'''''. 
 
 It is often mild and an attack can pass unnoticed. However, this can make the virus very difficult to [[Medical diagnosis|diagnose]]. 
 
 The disease can last 1â€“5 days. Children recover more quickly than adults. 
 
 The virus usually enters the body through the nose or throat. Like most viruses living along the [[respiratory tract]], it is passed from person to person by tiny droplets in the air that are breathed out. 
 
 Rubella can also be [[Vertical transmission|transmitted from a mother to her developing baby]] ([[fetus]]) through the [[placenta]].  This can be very dangerous to the fetus, especially if the mother gets rubella early on in her pregnancy.  Rubella can cause [[deaf]]ness, [[heart]] problems, [[intellectual disability]], and many other problems in developing [[fetus]]es. < ref name=vaccines > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt15-crs.html |title=Chapter 15: Congenital Rubella Syndrome.

 The virus has an [[incubation period]] of 2 to 3 weeks during which it becomes established. Common [[symptoms]] are a red/pink [[rash]], swollen [[lymph nodes]], and a high [[fever]]. 
 
 The disease is named ''German measles'' because it has a similar red rash to [[measles]] and was first described in detail by [[Germany|German]] [[Medical doctor|doctors]]. < ref > Best, J.M., Cooray, S., Banatvala J.E.

 == Eliminated in North and South America == 
 On April 29, 2015, it was announced that rubella has been eliminated in [[North American]] and [[South America]]. A [[Scientist|scientific]] group of experts said it took 15 years of work for this to happen. Among the groups are: Pan American Health Organization, United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[UNICEF]], and the [[United Nations]] Foundation. < ref name=rubella > {{cite news|author1=Donald G.
