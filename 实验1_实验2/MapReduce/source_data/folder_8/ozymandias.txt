 |quote= < poem > ''I met a traveller from an antique land 
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
 Stand in the desart < !-- 'desart' is a common historic spelling and appears as such in the source cited below -- > . Near them, on the sand, 
 Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, 
 And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, 
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read 
 Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, 
 The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: 
 And on the pedestal these words appear: 
 " My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! " 
 Nothing beside remains. Round the decay 
 Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare 
 The lone and level sands stretch far away.'' < ref > Text of the poem from {{cite book |title=Rosalind and Helen, a modern eclogue, with other poems. |first=Percy Bysshe |last=Shelley |year=1819 |publisher=C. and J.

 The name ''Ozymandias'' comes from a [[transliteration]] into [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] of the [[Regnal name|throne name]] of [[Ramesses II]]. The sonnet paraphrases (copies in different words) the writing on the base of a [[statue]] of Ramesses. The statue is called Younger Memnon and it is from [[Thebes]] (it is now in the [[British Museum]]). The writing on the statue was recorded by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]''. It reads:  " [[King]] of Kings am I, Osymandias. If anyone would know how great I am and where I lie, let him surpass one of my works " . < ref > (Greek Text) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D47%3Asection%3D4 Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 1.47.4] at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ Perseus Project] < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Percy Bysshe Shelley : Ozymandias|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1904.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010122400/http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1904.html|archive-date=2006-10-10|work=[[University of Toronto]] Department of English|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries, University of Toronto Press|accessdate=2006-09-18}} < /ref >
