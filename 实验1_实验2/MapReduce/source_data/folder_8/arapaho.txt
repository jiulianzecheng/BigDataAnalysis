 ==History== 
 ===Early history=== 
 Around 3,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Arapaho-speaking people (''Heeteinono'eino{{'}}'') lived in the western Great Lakes region. They lived there along the [[Red River Valley]]. This would be in what is present-day [[Manitoba]], Canada and [[Minnesota]], United States. < ref > Pritzker 319 < /ref >  The Arapaho were an agricultural people. They grew crops, including [[maize]]. < ref > Pritzker 297 < /ref >   
 
 ==Language== 
 The [[Arapaho language]] is currently spoken in two different dialects. It is considered to be a part the Algonquian language family. There are only about 250 fluent speakers of Northern Arapaho. Most of them live on the [[Wind River Indian Reservation|Wind River Reservation]] in Wyoming. There are even fewer fluent Southern Arapaho speakers. All of them are very old. < ref > Cowell, Andrew  &  Ramsberger, Gail  &  Menn, Lise.  " Dementia and grammar in a polysynthetic language: An Arapaho case study.
