 The '''rakali''' (''Hydromys chrysogaster''), also known as the '''water-rat''', is an [[Australia]]n native [[rodent]]. The [[species]] lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and [[estuary|estuaries]]. It feeds on aquatic insects, fish, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali are {{convert|231|-|370|mm|in}} in length with a thick tail measuring around {{convert|242|-|345|mm|in}}. They weigh {{convert|340|-|1275|g|lb}}. They have webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip. 
 
 ==Common names== 
 Until the 1980s, this species was commonly known as '''water-rat'''. During the 1990s there was a push for English common names to be replaced with [[Indigenous Australian|indigenous]] names. In 1995 the [[Australian Nature Conservation Agency]] recommended that the name '''rakali''' be used as the common name. < ref name= " ANCA 1995 " > {{cite book |author=Braithwaite R. W. | display-authors = etal |year=1995 |title=Australian names for Australian rodents |publisher=Australian Nature Conservation Agency |isbn=0642213739}} < /ref >  The Australian [[Department of the Environment and Heritage (Australia)|Department of Environment and Heritage]] has taken up this suggestion and both common names are now used.
