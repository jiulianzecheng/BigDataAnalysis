 A '''tipi''' (also called '''tepee''' or '''teepee''') is a kind of [[tent]]. It is cone-shaped. They were made by [[Native Americans]] of the [[Great Plains]] who frequently moved from place to place, following buffalo or other animals Native Americans hunted. 
 
 Tipis are made from long poles, and are covered with material. Long ago the material was animal skin or tree bark. Today, they are made from cloth. 
 
 Tepees were put up in as a circle, which symbolized the life. 
 
 Tepees are no longer usually used for a full-time home, but they are still used for special occasions. 
 
 Tepees were used by the Lakota. 
 
 The Plains Indians would sometimes paint and mark their tepees, and put signs to mark off evil. 
 
 They usually made the cover from [[buffalo]] skin (tanned hide). 
 
 Teepees had a flap that could be open and closed as necessary during the summer and winter months 
 
 They generally had an 'ears' flap. 
 
 The doorway would face towards the rising sun. 
 
 
 Tipis would contain paintings.
