 '''''Megastomatohyla''''' is a [[genus]] of [[frog]]s.  It is in in the family [[Hylidae]]. They [[endemic|live]] in [[cloud forest]]s in [[Mexico]].  It lives in the states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Oaxaca]]. < ref name=Frost/ >  All of the species in this genus are rare and only live in a few places. < ref name= " Canseco Márquez et al. 2018 " / >  The name  " Megastomatohyla "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''mega'' for  " large "  and ''stomatos'' for  " mouth, "  because the [[tadpole]]s have large mouths. ''[[Hyla]]'' is the name of another genus. Four of the frogs in ''Megastomatohyla'' were in ''Hyla'' before the scientists changed their minds. < ref name= " Faivovich et al. 2005 " / >  They are called '''large-mouthed treefrogs''' in English. < ref name=Frost/ > 
 
 ==Taxonomy and characteristics== 
 In 2005, scientists looked closely at the family Hylidae and the frogs in it.  They changed the genuses and groupings.  Scientists looked at [[molecular data]] and decided to make ''Megastomatohyla'' a genus.  Before that, these frogs were called the  " ''Hyla mixomaculata'' group. " 
 
 These frogs have only [[synamorphy|look similar]] in one way that people can see with their eyes: The tadpoles have a very large oral disk with many teeth: 7–10 rows of teeth in front and 10–11 rows of teeth in the back. < ref name= " Faivovich et al. 2005 " / >   
 
 ''Megastomatohyla'' are small frogs. They lay their eggs in streams. The largest frog in ''Megastomatohyla'' is about {{convert|37|mm|abbr=on}} long [[snout-vent length|from nose to rear end]]. < ref name= " Duellman 1970 " / >  Males do not [[Sexual selection in amphibians#Vocal signaling in frogs|sing for the females]] < ref name= " Canseco Márquez et al. 2018 " / > < ref name= " Duellman 1970 " / >  and they do not have vocal slits. They do not have nuptial pads on their thumbs. < ref name= " Faivovich et al. 2005 " / >  The [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] is not visible. < ref name= " Canseco Márquez et al. 2018 " / > < ref name= " Duellman 1970 " / >  The front feet have only a little webbed skin, and the back feet have more webbed skin. < ref name= " Duellman 1970 " / >
