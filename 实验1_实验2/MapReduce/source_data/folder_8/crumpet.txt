[[File:Pancake and crumpet.jpg|thumb|right|A pancake and a crumpet in one dish.]] 
 A '''crumpet''' is a kind of flat, small round [[bread]] that is raised by [[yeast]]. They are about the same size as an [[English muffin]]. They are made in crumpet rings that are four inches wide and usually one inch deep. Crumpets are usually [[bake]]d on a [[griddle]] and served [[toast]]ed. A well-baked crumpet has a brown bottom and a [[sponge]]y top that has many tiny holes. Crumpets are toasted whole, while English muffins are split and then toasted. After the baking, crumpets are spread with [[butter]] or [[cream]] and [[jam]].  
 
 == Definition == 
 
 The word of crumpet may come from the [[Middle English]] word ''crompid'' (cake), or ''curled'' (cake). Or it may come from the [[past participle]] of the Middle English [[verb]] ''crumpen'', which means to curl up. It could also have come from ''crumb'', ''crump'', or ''crooked'', all [[Old English]]. Crumpet is also used as [[British]] [[slang]] for a particularly [[sexual]]ly attractive woman. < ref > Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper, 2010 < /ref >  It Australian [[slang]], it is part of the expression:  " not worth a crumpet " , meaning that somebody or something is useless. 
 
 == History == 
 
 The first [[recipe]] for crumpets was long ago, referred to frequently as the  " crompid cake "  by many. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traced the history back to 1382. 
 
 {{quote|Crumpet...[Not known till in the 17th century], Wyclif has however used 'crompid cake'...which may be the [[descendant|antecedent]] of the name.  " A cake of a loaf, a crusted cake spreynde with oyle, a crompid cake... " |Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, volume IV (p. 83)}} 
 
 The Oxford Companion to Food also says that the earliest [[publish]]ed recipe for crumpets was by Elizabeth Raffald, in 1769. There, the  " crompid cake "  is mentioned as well with [[buckwheat]] griddle cakes so it is believed that there is a connection between crumpets and the buckwheat [[pancake]]. < ref > Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 230) < /ref > 
 
 Elizabeth Raffald mentions it in her book of ''The Experienced English Housekeeper''. Her recipe is very similar to the modern crumpet recipe, especially in the baking, buttering, and serving. < ref > The Experienced English Housekeeper, Elizabeth Raffald, [unabridged facsimile 1769 print with an introduction by Roy Shipperbottom [Southover Press:East Sussex] 1997 < /ref >
