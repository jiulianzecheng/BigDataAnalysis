 '''Mahogany''' is a hard [[tropical]] [[wood]] from the [[Americas]]. It was discovered by Europeans early in the 16th century (~1514). The wood comes from a tree, ''Swietenia mahagoni''. < ref name= " Lamb1966 " > {{cite book|author=Frank Bruce Lamb|title=Mahogany of tropical America: its ecology and management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SrhjAAAAMAAJ & dq=%22after+more+than+400+years+in+the+tropics%22|year=1966|publisher=University of Michigan Press|page=10}} < /ref >  The tree is native to southern [[Florida]]  and islands in the [[Caribbean]] including [[the Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Hispaniola]]. < ref name= " Louppe2008 " > {{cite book|author=D.

 At first, mahogany was used by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[English people|English]] to build ships. < ref name= " Mell1917 " > {{cite book|author=Clayton Dissinger Mell|title=True mahogany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VI-iDtDJMC0C & pg=PA9|date=1917 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture|location=Washington D.C.|pages=9–10}} < /ref >   
 [[Mark Catesby]]'s ''Natural History'' explains why:  
 < br/ > " [Mahogany] has properties for that use excelling oak, and all other wood, viz. durableness, resisting gunshots, and burying the shot without splintering " . < ref name= " Catesby1729 " > {{cite book|title=The natural history of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands ...|year=1729|pages=80–81|url=https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryCc1v2Cate#page/n251/mode/2up|author=Mark Catesby|access-date=26 November 2013|language=fr, en}} < /ref > 
 
 The second use for mahogany was to make [[furniture]]. The Spanish were first to do this, but in the 18th and early 19th century it was much used by English workshops. This period is called  " Age of Mahogany " . < ref name= " Macquoid1906 " > {{cite book|author=Percy Macquoid|title=A history of English furniture: the age of mahogany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asALAQAAMAAJ|year=1906|publisher=Lawrence  &  Bullen}} < /ref >  Also much furniture in mahogany was made in [[France]] and other European countries. 
 
 It has a few special characteristics that make mahogany a helpful [[wood]]. It is strong and durable but easy to bend so is especially helpful for [[Carpenter|carpenters]]. Mahogany trees, although endangered, grow very tall and are so may be cut into large sheets. Also, mahogany is resistant to [[Stain|stains]].
