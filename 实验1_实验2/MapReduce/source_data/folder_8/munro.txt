 A '''Munro''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] mountain with a height over 3,000 & nbsp;feet (914.4 metres). They are named after [[Hugh Munro|Sir Hugh Munro]] (1856–1919), who produced the first attempt at a catalogue of such hills, known as ''Munro's Tables'', in [[1891]]. 
 
 Munro did not set any measure of [[topographic prominence|relative height]] by which a [[:wikt:peak|peak]] qualified as a separate mountain, and much debate has since taken place over how distinct two hills must be if they are to be considered as two separate Munros. 
 
 Despite their modest height, walking and climbing in the Scottish mountains may be made dangerous by their [[latitude]] and exposure to Atlantic weather systems. Even in summer, conditions can be very bad; thick fog, strong winds, driving rain and freezing summit temperatures are not unusual. 
 
 Winter [[wikt:ascent|ascents]] of certain Munros are widely accepted to provide among the most challenging [[ice climbing|ice climbs]] in [[Europe]]. Some walkers are unprepared for the often extreme weather conditions on the exposed tops and many fatalities are recorded every year, often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice.
