 '''''Materpiscis''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for  " mother fish " ) is a [[genus]] of [[ptyctodontid]] [[placoderm]] from the late [[Devonian]] period, about 380 million years ago. A [[fossil]] of this armored placoderm shows an [[embryo]] and [[umbilical cord]] inside its body. So ''Materpiscis'' is the oldest known vertebrate to show [[viviparity]] (giving birth to live young). Viviparity of one kind or another is quite common in certain kinds of fish, for example sharks. 
 
 The [[holotype]] was found in the Kimberley area of northern [[Western Australia]]. Fossils from the Gogo Formation are preserved in [[limestone]] nodules, so dilute [[acetic acid]] is used to dissolve the surrounding limestone and reveal the [[fossil]]. These fossils are often preserved in three dimensions with minimal distortion. < ref > {{YouTube|m18sGLBdPGU|Dr John Long describes the discovery of the ''Materpiscis''}} < /ref > 
 
 The species was named ''Materpiscis attenboroughi'' in honour of [[David Attenborough]] who first drew attention to the significance of the Gogo fish sites in his 1979 series [[Life on Earth (TV series)|''Life on Earth'']]. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7424281.stm BBC News: Fossil reveals oldest live birth] < /ref >
