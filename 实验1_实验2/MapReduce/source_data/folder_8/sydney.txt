 == Geography == 
 Sydney is a city located on the East Coast of Australia. It is currently the largest city in Australia, and the continent of Oceania. Sydney is known for having been the original landing spot for the British. It is situated next to the Blue Mountains. Sydney has more than 650 suburbs, and 38 local government areas.  
 
 Sydney lies on a drowned coastline on the east coast of New South Wales, where the ocean level has risen up to flood deep river valleys carved in the Sydney [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]], which was laid down about about 200 million years ago. Sydney has over two major regions: the Cumberland Plain, a mostly flat region lying to the west of Sydney Harbour, and the Hornsby Plateau, a tableland north of the Harbour. Sydney's native plant species are mostly [[eucalyptus]] trees, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/profiles/eucalypt-forest|title=Eucalypt forest|access-date=29 January 2017|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2017}} < /ref >   and its soils are red and yellow in colour. Sydney has nine rivers and just over a hundred creeks.  
 
 Sydney's main vegetation communities are grassy woodlands or [[savanna]]s, which are open woodlands that feature hard-leaved shrubs, trees like eucalyptuses and [[acacia]]s, and grass in the understory. Dry and wet forests are common as well, and as well as very small rainforest communities.  
 
 ==Climate== 
 Sydney has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with warm to hot summers and cool winters, and rainfall spread throughout the year. Hotter temperatures are recorded inland in the western suburbs, because the coast is moderated by the ocean. Rainfall is higher in the first half of the year when easterly winds are common, and lower in late winter/early spring when winds are more westerly, but rain has been very changeable in recent years. < ref > {{cite news|title=Sydney future: high temps, erratic rain| url =https://www.smh.com.au/national/sydney-future-high-temps-erratic-rain-20081028-5a7x.html| publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald}} < /ref > 
 
 East coast lows bring heavy rainfall to the Sydney area, typically in autumn to early winter. < ref > {{cite web|title=About East Coast Lows|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/ecl.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|access-date=12 December 2022}} < /ref >  In the warm months, rain comes in short heavy falls in the afternoons, usually with a [[thunderstorm]]. Snow is unheard of, but major snowfall was last reported in Sydney on 28 June 1836. The [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] are an important feature in Sydney's weather patterns: [[drought]] and [[bushfire]] on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other. < ref > [https://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/the-beasts-to-our-east-what-are-el-ninos-and-la-ninas-20201209-p56lya.html#:~:text=Events%20usually%20last%20nine%20to,with%20flooding%20in%20eastern%20states. What is La Nina and what does it mean for your summer?] By Peter Hannam and Laura Chung. The Sydney Morning Herald. November 25, 2021. < /ref > 
 
 The highest recorded temperature in the city was {{convert|45.3|C}}, which was experienced on 18 January 2013. The highest recorded temperature in the west was {{convert|48.9|C}}, observed on 4 January 2020 in the suburb of Penrith. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_067113_All.shtml |title=Climate statistics for Penrith Lakes |website=Bureau of Meteorology}} < /ref >  Hot days are usually ended by a southerly buster, a windy sea breeze that comes from the southeast. While Sydney CBD (Observatory Hill) has never recorded [[frost]], the far western suburbs usually get frost in winter. The [[ultraviolet]] index rating in the summer averages at 12, but can reach as high as 13. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.9news.com.au/national/weather-uv-ratings-extreme-sydney-new-south-wales-forecast-skin-cancer-danger/d8a7c657-ce79-4907-bace-13c8ebf34a35 |access-date=25 March 2022|title=Australia's UV index peaks as thousands flock to beach unprotected }} < /ref >  Windspeed recorded in [[Sydney Airport]] averages at 24.3 km/h (15.0 mph), making Sydney the windiest capital city in Australia. < ref > [http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/cvg/av?p_stn_num=066037 & p_prim_element_index=0 & p_comp_element_index=0 & redraw=null & p_display_type=full_statistics_table & normals_years=1991-2020 & tablesizebutt=normal SYDNEY AIRPORT AMO] Bureau of Meterology, Sydney Airport (1991-2020 normals).
