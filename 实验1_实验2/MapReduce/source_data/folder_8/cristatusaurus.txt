 '''''Cristatusaurus''''' was a [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[West Africa]]. Its [[fossil]]s look very similar to the ones from ''[[Baryonyx]]'' and ''[[Suchomimus]].''  < ref name= " TaquetRussell "  / > 
 
 == Discovery and naming == 
 The first specimens were found in [[Niger]] in 1973 by a French [[paleontologist]] named Philippe Taquet. The name of the animal refers to the Latin word for crest, '' " crista " ,'' because it had a crest on its snout. The [[species]] '' " lapparenti " '' is named after another French paleontologist called Albert-Félix de Lapparent. < ref name= " TaquetRussell " > Taquet, P. and Russell, D.A. (1998).

Scientists aren' < /nowiki > t sure if ''Cristatusaurus'' is a new species, some of them say it could be the same dinosaur as ''Suchomimus'' or ''Baryonyx.'' < ref name= " Rauhut " > Rauhut, O.W.M.
