 '''Derbyshire''' is a [[county]] in the [[East Midlands]] of [[England]]. A large part of the [[Peak District National Park]] lies within Derbyshire.  
 
 The northern part of Derbyshire overlaps with the [[Pennines]], a famous chain of hills and [[mountain]]s. The county contains part of the [[National Forest, England|National Forest]], and borders on [[Greater Manchester]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Staffordshire]] and [[Cheshire]].

 == Geology == 
 Derbyshire can only be understood by its ancient geology. Most of the geology was laid down in a tropical paradise in the equatorial region of the Earth. 
 [[File:Peak District Cross Section.gif|400px|thumb|center|A cross-section of northern Derbyshire, from west to east, showing the approximate structure of an eroded dome, with younger Coal Measure rocks to the east, and older limestone exposed in the centre]] 
 
 Northern Derbyshire is an uplifted dome of rock layers. These layers have been eroded to expose older rocks in the centre of the [[Derbyshire Dome]]. They are encircled by younger limestone rocks. They give way on three sides to [[Upper Carboniferous]] [[shale]]s, [[Gritstone|gritstones]] and [[Sandstone|sandstones]] of [[Namurian]] age (331 to 315 mya). 
 
 South of [[Buxton]] much of the land is difficult to walk on, and roads are narrow and winding. This area was once a tropical paradise with scattered [[calcium carbonate]] [[reef]]s. This coarse sandstone was much used for [[gritstone]] grinding wheels for use in mills.
