'''Beaubreuil''' is the largest outer district of Limoges (Haute-Vienne), extending over approximately 230 hectares, and one of the most populated. Completely separated from the central urban fabric of the city by the Bois de la Bastide, its architecture is typical of a concerted development zone from the 1970s to the 1990s, alternating large complexes, residential areas and commercial spaces. < ref > https://www.limoges.fr/ < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/haute-vienne/limoges/il-y-45-ans-limoges-beaubreuil-sortait-terre-1258339.html | title=Il y a 45 ans Ã  Limoges, Beaubreuil sortait de terre }} < /ref > 
 
 The youth policy was completed in 2019: as part of the district's urban renewal program, the former day hospital was completely refurbished into a childhood center: the Sanfourche youth center inaugurated in 2018.
