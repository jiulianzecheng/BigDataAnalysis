 Vim stands for Vi IMproved. Vim is an improved version of the vi text editor, < ref name= " learn " / > < ref name= " pocket " / >  an editor created by Bill Joy in 1976. Vim is free, and the [[source code]] is publicly available on [[GitHub]]. It is available in multiple languages, and it works on multiple [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[macOS]]. Vim can be used from either a [[command-line interface]] or a [[Graphical user interfaces and consoles|graphical user interface]]. 
 
 While Vim can be hard to use, there are built-in commands new users can learn from reading the Vim user manual, running the :help command in Vim, or using the vimtutor command in a terminal. 
 
 Vim is widely popular because it allows users to perform many functions on a document (save, search, scroll, etc.) by pressing as few keys as possible. However, many critics argue that these keystrokes are confusing. 
 
 One can customize Vim using a .vimrc file. To add new features like keyboard shortcuts, one can use Vim script, < ref > Rosset, C. (2013).

Many Vim plugins and extensions are also available online for free.
