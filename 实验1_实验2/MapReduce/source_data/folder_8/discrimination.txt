'''Discrimination''' is when someone is treated unfairly or differently because the person is one of a particular group. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] affirms that all persons must be protected against any kind of discrimination, or even its inciting. 
 
 A person might be discriminated against because of their [[race (sociology)|race]], [[aging|age]], [[sex]], [[politics]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[religion]],[[caste]],the way they look, a past [[criminal]] record, the person's [[lifestyle]], their choice of [[clothing]], their [[ageism|age]] or their [[disability|disabilities]] whether they are a member of or fit in with a social [[clique]] (group), [[social class]], [[social status]] or [[caste]], and many other reasons. 
 
 Discrimination can take many forms. It can include being fired from a [[job]], not being able to be hired for a job, being paid less [[money]] than others at the same job, being refused a [[home]] or [[apartment]], [[teasing]], [[harass]]ment, or simply being treated differently than other people. [[Law]]s known as  " equal opportunity legislation "  protect people from discrimination. They say people should be [[employ]]ed whatever their race, age, sex or religion. There should be reasonable care for people with [[disability|disabilities]] or [[accessibility]]. Two people in the same [[position]] must be paid the same wage if they have exactly the same job. 
 
 In some countries, discrimination against somebody on the basis of race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, age, or disability is [[illegal]]. Even in those countries where discrimination is unlawful, it still takes place for reasons not covered by the law. In some other countries, discrimination against somebody is legal or even official government policy. This especially takes place in countries in which there is an official religion, and people of other religions are discriminated against.
