 The '''Chelicerata''' are a sub-[[phylum]] of the [[Arthropods]]. The sub-phylum consists of only two [[Class (biology)|classes]]: the [[Arachnid]]s and the [[Merostomata]]. 
 
 The Merostomata are the extinct [[Eurypterids]] and the [[horseshoe crabs]] ([[Xiphosura]]). The horseshoe crabs are a small, ancient group which has survived relatively unchanged for millions of years. Groups like this are often called [[living fossil]]s. The Arachnida is the huge and successful terrestrial (air-breathing) group of [[spider]]s and their relatives. 
 
 The chelicerates originated as [[Ocean|marine]] animals. The first confirmed chelicerate [[fossil]]s, the [[eurypterid]]s, date from 445 million years ago in the late [[Ordovician]] period. Although only four marine species survive, all of them [[horseshoe crab]]s, there are over 77,000 species of air-breathing chelicerates, and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species. < ref > Margulis, Lynn and Schwartz, Karlene 1998.

 The [[pycnogonids]] may or may not be Chelicerates. This is in dispute, as [[genetic]] evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods. < ref > {{Cite journal |author= Regier J.C. |display-authors = etal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7284/full/nature08742.html |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=25 February 2010 |title=Arthropod relationships revealed by phylogenomic analysis of nuclear protein-coding sequences |volume=463 |issue=7284 |pages=1079â€“1083 |doi=10.1038/nature08742 |pmid=20147900 |bibcode = 2010Natur.463.1079R |s2cid = 4427443 |quote=our phylogeny [...] only marginally favoured Chelicerata over the alternative of a more basal placement of Pycnogonida}} < /ref >  There are 1,300 [[species]] of  these 'sea spiders'. 
 
 The life-style of chelicerates is largely [[carnivorous]], or other kinds of [[heterotroph]].
