[[File:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|right|These glasses containing red dye show changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more diluted, and the solutions on the right are more concentrated.]] 
 
 In [[chemistry]], '''concentration''' is how much of a [[chemical substance|substance]] is [[mix]]ed with another substance. 
 
 The substance that is [[solvation|dissolved]] (shown as the red dye in the example) is known as the [[solution|solute]]. The substance in which the solute is dissolved (shown as the water in the example) is known as the [[solvent]]. 
 
 To concentrate a [[solution]], one must add more solute, or reduce the amount of solvent. To '''dilute''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute.
