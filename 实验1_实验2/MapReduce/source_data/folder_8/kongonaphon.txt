 '''''Kongonaphon''''' is an early member of the [[dinosaur]]–[[pterosaur]] [[clade]] [[Ornithodira]]. It is a small reptile-type [[fossil]] found in the  
 [[Middle Triassic|Middle]] to [[Late Triassic|Late]] [[Triassic]] of [[Madagascar]]. It was probably an [[insectivore]], based on the shape and texture of its teeth. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 ''Kongonaphon'' is notable for its tiny size, even compared to other small early [[avemetatarsalia]]. The [[femur]] was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was about 10 cm (3.9 inches).  
 
 It has long been thought that early members of the group were small. If they were as small as this, then a miniaturization event occurred near the base of the [[avian]] stem lineage. Also the small size explains the origin of body covering ( " [[integumentary system|integument]] " , hair on the body of dinosaurs and feathers on birds). Tiny creatures are most vulnerable to changes in external temperature. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Kammerer|first1=Christian F.|last2=Nesbitt|first2=Sterling J.|last3=Flynn|first3=John J.|last4=Ranivoharimanana|first4=Lovasoa|last5=Wyss|first5=André R.|date=2020|title=A tiny ornithodiran archosaur from the Triassic of Madagascar and the role of miniaturization in dinosaur and pterosaur ancestry|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=117|issue=30|pages=17932–17936|language=en|doi=10.1073/pnas.1916631117|pmid=32631980 |pmc=7395432 |issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free}} < /ref >
