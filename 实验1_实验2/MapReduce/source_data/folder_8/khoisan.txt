 The '''Khoisan''' is the name for two peoples of [[Southern Africa]]: the '''San''' and the '''Khoikhoi'''. The San are [[foraging]] bushmen, and the Khoi are a [[Herding#Herding occupations|pastoral]] people previously known as the '''Hottentots'''. The relationship between the two groups is not very clear. The San are generally smaller than other humans in the area. They also look very different than other groups of people there. As of 2018, between 90.000 and 100.000 San are left.  Most of them live in [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]. There are San minorities in [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. 
 
 The San were some of the original ([[indigenous]]) inhabitants of Southern Africa. Then the southward [[Bantu]] migrations from [[North Africa|North]] and [[East Africa]] reached the region 700 years ago. The Bantu populations displaced the Khoi and San to become the predominant inhabitants of Southern Africa. 
 
 The Khoisan “was the largest population on Earth at some point”, according to one evolutionary geneticist. < ref > [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/dwindling-african-tribe-may-have-been-most-populous-group-planet ''Science'', December 4, 2014] < /ref > < ref > Lee, Richard B. 1976.

Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates a long period of settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region. < ref > Diamond, Jared 1999.

 [[Charles Darwin]] wrote about the Khoisan and [[sexual selection]] in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' in 1882, commenting that their [[steatopygia]] [[evolution|evolved]] through [[sexual selection]] in [[human evolution]], and that  " the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner " . < ref > {{cite book | title = The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex | author = Charles Darwin | year = 1882 | location = London | publisher = John Murray | page = 578 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F955 & viewtype=text & pageseq=1}} < /ref > 
 
 In the 1990s, [[genome|genomic]] studies of the world's peoples found that the [[Y chromosome]] of San men share patterns of [[polymorphism]]s that are different from those of all other populations. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/12/dwindling-african-tribe-may-have-been-most-populous-group-planet|title=Dwindling African tribe may have been most populous group on planet|work=sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-01-02|archive-date=2015-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023000858/http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/12/dwindling-african-tribe-may-have-been-most-populous-group-planet|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Because the Y chromosome changes little, this type of [[Sequence analysis|DNA test]] is used to determine when different human subgroups separated from one another. This shows their last common ancestry. The authors of these studies suggest that the San may have been one of the first populations to differentiate from the most recent common ancestor of all living humans, estimated to have lived 60,000 to 90,000 years ago. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Complete Khoisan and Bantu genomes from southern Africa| volume=463 | doi=10.1038/nature08795|journal=Nature|pages=943–947|pmid=20164927|pmc=3890430|year=2010 | last1 = Schuster | first1 = SC |issue=7283 |bibcode=2010Natur.463..943S |display-authors = etal }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|author=Mayell, Hillary|title= Documentary Redraws Humans' Family Tree|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1212_021213_journeyofman.html|date=December 2002|work=National Geographic}} < /ref >
