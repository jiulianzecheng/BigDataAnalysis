 '''Schizophrenia''' is a [[condition]] which may be diagnosed by a [[psychiatrist]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=ICD-11: 6A20 Schizophrenia |url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f1683919430 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date= 23 August 2022 }} < /ref >  It is a lifelong [[mental disorder]] where [[people]] may see, hear or believe things which are not real. It can be a big problem for people who have it.  
 
 It may occur at almost any age, but it usually happens between late teens to early 30s. It can show in young people aged from 16 to 30. [[Self injury|Self-harm]] is likely, and confused speech which seems meaningless is a common characteristic. The condition needs psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Because of the self-harm possibility, no time should be wasted if a young person begins to show the signs.  
 
 There is possibly a genetic [[wikt:component|component]] (which is not well understood). If one child shows clear signs, other children in the family may show some [[symptom]]s. 
 
 Some similar mental illnesses include [[schizotypal personality disorder]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], and [[schizoid personality disorder]].    
 
 It is a fairly common condition affecting one in 200 people. < ref > Ferri F.F. 2019. ''Ferri's clinical advisor'' 2019 : 5 books in 1. pp. 1225–1226. ISBN 9780323530422 < /ref >  It is not infectious in any way. There is a danger that the sufferer may [[self-harm]]. Its cause is not exactly known. Very often it first appears in teenage years when the sufferer goes through [[puberty]]. There is no cure, but there is treatment which can help most of the sufferers. 
 
 People with this disorder often do not behave the way most people do towards others. They also may not know what is real (this is called [[psychosis]]). Some common [[signs]] are strange beliefs, unclear or [[Mental confusion|confused]] thinking and language, [[hallucination]]s (such as hearing voices that aren't there), poor interaction with others, less expression of [[Emotion|feelings]], and not doing much. They also may not care about many things. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Types of psychosis|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/psychosis/types-of-psychosis/|access-date=2021-01-26|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Schizophrenia is a [[chronic]] condition. There is no cure, but a combination of a [[therapy]] and certain [[Drug|drugs]] can allow most people suffering from it to lead a normal life. 
 
 == Meaning == 
 The word ''schizophrenia'' comes from two [[Greek language|Greek words]] that mean ''to split'' and ''mind,'' because there is a 'split' between what's going on in the person's mind and what is actually happening. A person with schizophrenia does not change between different personalities: they have only one. < ref name= " fn_3 " > {{cite book|author=Berrios G.E.; Porter, Roy |title=A history of clinical psychiatry: the origin and history of psychiatric disorders |publisher=Athlone Press |location=London |year=1995|isbn=0-485-24211-7}} < /ref >  The condition in which a person has more than one personality, meaning they act like a different person at different times, is [[dissociative identity disorder]]. There are no medical tests that can be used to say if a person has schizophrenia or not, so getting a diagnosis depends on which list of symptoms are used. It also depends on the [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]] or [[psychologist]] who talks to the person. The lists of symptoms include wording like  " Disorganized [not organized, or oddly organized] [[speech]] present for a significant portion of time " . It is difficult to agree on what exactly  " disorganized speech "  is and how disorganized it has to be. It is also difficult to agree on how long a  " significant portion of time "  is. Because of this, two doctors or psychologists trying to make a diagnosis may often disagree. One will say that the person is schizophrenic and the other will say he or she is not. < ref > American Psychiatric Association (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing. pp. 5–25. {{ISBN|978-0-89042-555-8}}. < /ref > 
 
 == About schizophrenia == 
 Schizophrenia has many different [[symptom]]s, and not everyone with schizophrenia has all of them. For this reason, some [[scientist]]s think that schizophrenia is several separate illnesses that have some of the same symptoms. These scientists claim that the [[research]] done on schizophrenia is not accurate since different researchers mean different things when they use the word  " schizophrenia "  in scientific studies. 
 
 Many [[medication]]s (licensed drugs to cure or treat an illness) may also cause the same symptoms as schizophrenia. The most common ones are [[antidepressants]] (medicines to treat depression) and [[ADHD]] medication (medication to treat ADHD, a condition affecting the brain, including memory and focusing on surroundings.) If a person has taken anti-[[vomit]]ing medication (medication to stop them being sick) for some time and suddenly stops, he or she may get schizophrenia symptoms. Hundreds of medications have schizophrenia symptoms as rare [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] (unintended effects of taking them). [[Illegal drugs]] such as [[LSD]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[magic mushroom]]s and [[cocaine]] may cause schizophrenia symptoms. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.pdr.net/resources/mobilePDR/|title=mobilePDR - PDR.net|website=www.pdr.net}}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 Medical illnesses, and treatment with certain medicines, can cause symptoms very similar to that of schizophrenia. In fact, there are over a hundred medical problems that can cause the same symptoms of schizophrenia. For this reason, it is important to rule out the possibility of either of these things being the cause for the person's symptoms. For this reason, the person should have a thorough medical exam to rule out problems like; 
 * Not having enough [[vitamin B12]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], or other chemicals the body needs 
 * [[Sleep disorder]]s 
 * A [[stroke]] or [[brain tumor]] 
 * A [[metabolism]] (chemical reactions keeping the person alive) that is too high or too low 
 
 == Delusions and hallucinations == 
 People with schizophrenia often have [[delusion]]s or hallucinations. A schizophrenic delusion is a belief that is very different from what other people with the same way of life believe. Hallucinations are usually experiences of hearing voices that don't exist. These voices often say unpleasant things to the person. Many people can hear voices like this without being schizophrenic, for instance right before falling asleep. This is called a [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic hallucination]]. The brain cannot tell them apart from normal sounds that are heard. This is not yet fully understood by science. 
 
 == Risk factors == 
 There are many [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] that may cause a person to develop schizophrenia. They include [[psychological trauma|trauma]] (damage caused by [[stress]]ful events) and [[genetics]] (schizophrenia running in families). Having a schizophrenic parent may be very stressful, and there may also be [[gene]]s that influence the development of schizophrenia. It is very easy to show that trauma, such as [[sexual abuse]] (forced unwanted sexual behaviour towards somebody) increases the risk, but 40 years of searching for the right genes has not found anything that has been confirmed by independent research groups. < ref name= " Joseph, J. 2003 " > Joseph, J. (2003). The Gene Illusion: Genetic Research in Psychiatry and Psychology under the Microscope. PCCS Books. {{ISBN|1-898059-47-0}}. < /ref > 
 
 == Hope == 
 People with schizophrenia may also have other mental health disorders, like [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]], [[anxiety]] and [[Drug addiction|drug abuse]]. < ref name= " Sim_et_al_2006 " > {{cite journal |author=Buckley PF, Miller BJ, Lehrer DS, Castle DJ |title=Psychiatric comorbidities and schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=383–402|date=March 2009  |pmid=19011234 |pmc=2659306 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn135}} < /ref >  They often have problems functioning in society, and have difficulty keeping a job. However, there are a number of people with schizophrenia who get well and have earned [[college degree]]s and had professional [[career]]s. For example, Elyn. R. Saks successfully became a law professor at the [[University of Southern California]] and a published author. 
 
 In a family treatment called  " Open dialog "  in [[Finland]], eight out of every ten people with schizophrenia  " get well. "  In [[Developing country|developing]] countries, where doctors use less drugs, 2 out of 3 patients get well from schizophrenia. In western countries, where medications are used as treatment, 1 of 3 get well, but many suffer from drug side effects such as [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], and [[brain damage]]. < ref > Anatomy of an epidemic: magic bullets, psychiatric drugs, and the astonishing rise of mental illness in America. Crown, April 13, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-307-45241-2}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 [[Treatment]] of schizophrenia may include medication to help treat the symptoms, different types of [[psychotherapy]] (therapy by a professional), such as [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] and many rehabilitation therapies (therapies restoring things to how they were before), such as cognitive remediation therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, is a talk therapy that focuses on helping the person to think about their strange ideas (delusions) in more realistic ways. 
 
 The therapist may design a behavioral experiment for paranoia (false beliefs of danger) that will help the person to find out for example, if there really are cameras everywhere in the house. For hallucinations, cognitive therapy focuses on normalizing: many people hear voices without being stressed, and we all hear voices in the form of thoughts, it is just that people with schizophrenia hear them a bit more clearly than most people. < ref name= " :0 " > ''Cognitive therapy of schizophrenia''. David G. Kingdon, Douglas TurkingtonGuilford Press, 2005 < /ref > 
 
 ==Official guidelines== 
 The British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) suggest the following treatments: 
 * Check for reactions to traumatic experiences 
 * Decide together with a doctor about using medication, taking into account the side effect risk of getting diabetes, becoming seriously overweight, getting brain damage (tardive dyskinesia, 5% risk pr year), men growing breasts, and feelings described as inner torture (akathesia). 
 The guidelines also warn against using more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time. Both for people who are at risk for getting schizophrenia and for people who have got it, they recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and [[family therapy]]. Getting support from people who have become well from schizophrenia is also strongly recommended.

 The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. < ref > David Sue, Derald Wing Sue, Stanley Sue. Understanding Abnormal Behavior Wadsworth Publishing; 9 edition (2008) p.361 {{ISBN|0547154410}} < /ref > 
 
 ;Positive symptoms 
 Positive symptoms are thoughts, behaviors, or anything experienced by the senses that are not shared by others - like hearing voices that are not really there. They are called 'positive' not because they are good but because they are  " added on " . These symptoms may include having strange thoughts that do not make sense (delusions), disorganized thoughts and speech, and feeling, hearing, seeing, smelling, or tasting things that do not exist (hallucinations). < ref > Kneisl C. and Trigoboff E.(2009).

 ;Negative symptoms 
 Negative symptoms are thoughts, behaviors or emotions normally present in a healthy person that a person with a mental disorder has less of or may not have at all; they are 'minus' these. The sign for minus is -; it is also the sign for the word  " negative " . Negative symptoms includes a 'flat affect'; having a blank inexpressive look on the face and/or monosyllabic speech (speech always sounding the same) spoken in a slow monotone, few gestures, lack of interest in anything including other people, and an inability to act spontaneously or feel pleasure. These problems are also side effects of anti-psychoctic drugs. They may also be symptoms of many medical problems such as a metabolism that is too low. < ref name= " Breggin2008 "  / > 
 
 ;Cognitive symptoms (or cognitive deficits) 
 Cognitive symptoms are problems with attention, certain types of memory, the concept of time, and with the ability to plan and organize. Cognitive deficits caused by schizophrenia can also be difficult to recognize as part of the disorder. They are the most disabling of the symptoms because cognitive problems affect everyday functioning. These problems may also be side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, antidepressants, sleeping medication and anti-anxiety drugs. < ref name= " Breggin2008 "  / > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 [[File:Schizophrenia risk factors-PLOS.png|thumb|400px|Schizophrenia risk factors.]] 
 A combination of what has happened to a person and the person’s genes may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. < ref name=Lancet09 > {{cite journal |author=[[Jim van Os|van Os J]], Kapur S |title=Schizophrenia |journal=Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9690 |pages=635–45 |year=2009 |date=August 2009|pmid=19700006 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60995-8 |s2cid=208792724 |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19525360/611943554/name/Schizophrenia+-+The+Lancet.pdf |accessdate=2013-04-15 |archivedate=2013-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623065810/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/19525360/611943554/name/Schizophrenia+-+The+Lancet.pdf }} < /ref > < ref name=BMJ07/ >  People who have family members with schizophrenia and who experienced a brief period of psychotic symptoms have a 20 to 40 percent chance of being diagnosed one year later. This may be both the result of stressful events because of the family member and possibly a genetic effect. < ref name= " Drake_Lewis_2005 " > {{cite journal |author=Drake RJ, Lewis SW |title=Early detection of schizophrenia |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=147–50 |date=March 2005  |pmid=16639167 |doi=10.1097/00001504-200503000-00007|s2cid=32547954 }} < /ref > 
 
 ;Inherited factors 
 It is difficult to know if schizophrenia is inherited because it is hard to find out whether something comes from genes or the environment. < ref name= " ODonovan_et_al_2003 " > {{cite journal |author=O'Donovan MC, Williams NM, Owen MJ |title=Recent advances in the genetics of schizophrenia|journal=Hum.

The risk is even higher if you have an identical twin with schizophrenia. < ref name=BMJ07/ >  This may seem to show that schizophrenia is inherited. However, it may be the stress of living with a schizophrenic family member that is traumatic. Identical twins are much closer and are treated much more in the same way, and this may be the reason why one of them is more likely to get schizophrenia if the other has it. Dr Jay Joseph has found many problems with the scientific studies of inheriting schizophrenia, including false reporting of results. Joseph also claims that 40 years of the search for the schizophrenia gene has not found a single gene that independent research groups have confirmed. < ref name= " Joseph, J. 2003 " / > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/the-trouble-with-twin-studies/|title=The Trouble with Twin Studies|first=Jay Joseph|last=PsyD|date=13 March 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ;Environmental factors 
 There are may environmental risk factors factors for schizophrenia such as drug use, stress before birth and in some cases exposure to infectious diseases (a disease that spreads from person to person). < ref name=Lancet09/ >  In addition, living in a city during childhood or as an adult has been found to double the risk of schizophrenia . < ref name=Lancet09/ > < ref name=BMJ07/ >  This is true even after taking into account drug use, race, and the size of one’s social group. < ref name= " fn_19 " > {{cite journal |author=Van Os J |year=2004 |title=Does the urban environment cause psychosis?|journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=184 | issue=4 |pages=287–288 |pmid=15056569 |doi=10.1192/bjp.184.4.287|s2cid=29157204 }} < /ref >  Other factors that play an important role include whether the person feels socially isolated, as well as social adversity, racial discrimination (treating a person badly because of their race), the person's family not working properly, unemployment, and poor housing conditions. < ref name=BMJ07/ > < ref name= " Selten_et_al_2007 " > {{cite journal |author=Selten JP, Cantor-Graae E, Kahn RS|date=March 2007  |title=Migration and schizophrenia |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=111–115 |pmid=17278906|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e328017f68e|s2cid=21391349 }} < /ref >  There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life. < ref > {{cite journal |authors=Larkin W, Read J |title=Childhood trauma and psychosis: evidence, pathways, and implications|journal=J Postgrad Med |year=2008 |volume=54 |issue=4|pages=287–293 |doi=10.4103/0022-3859.41437|pmid=18953148 |url=http://www.jpgmonline.com/text.asp?2008/54/4/287/41437 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >

 ;Smoking 
 More people with schizophrenia smoke than the general population; it is estimated that at least 60% to as many as 90% of people with schizophrenia smoke. Recent research suggests that cigarette smoking may be a risk factor for developing schizophrenia. Smoking also reduces the effects and side effects of anti-psychotic drugs, and this may be one of the reasons for the high smoking rate. Patients taking anti-psychotic drugs die up to 20 years earlier than others, possibly because the medication makes them overweight, gives diabetes and leads to them smoking. 
 
 ;Pre-birth factors 
 Factors such as lack of oxygen, infection, or stress and lack of healthy foods in the mother during [[pregnancy]], might result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. < ref name=Lancet09/ >  People who have schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern half of the world). This might relate to increased rates of exposures to viruses before birth. < ref name=BMJ07/ >  This difference is about 5 to 8 percent. < ref name=yolken > {{cite journal|journal=Herpes |date=Jun 2004 |volume=11 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=83A–88A  |title=Viruses and schizophrenia: a focus on herpes simplex virus.|url=http://www.stanleylab.org/publications/VIRUSES.asp |author=Yolken R. |pmid=15319094}} < /ref > 
 
 ;Brain structure 
 [[File:Enlarged_lateral_ventricles_in_schizophrenia.png|thumb|250px|Enlarged lateral ventricles in schizophrenia]] 
 Some people who have schizophrenia have differences in their brain structure compared to those who do not have the disorder. These differences are often in the parts of the brain that manage memory, organization, emotions, the control of impulsive behavior, and language. < ref > {{cite book |year=2006 |author=Kircher, Tilo and Renate Thienel |title=The Boundaries of Consciousness |isbn=0444528768|page=302 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHGacGKyVbYC & pg=PA302 |chapter=Functional brain imaging of symptoms and cognition in schizophrenia|publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam}} < /ref >  For example, there is less brain volume in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes, and problems within the corpus callosum, the band of nerve fibers which connects the left side and the right side of the brain. People with schizophrenia also tend to have larger lateral and third ventricles. The ventricles are spaces within the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid. < ref name= " Green2006 " > {{cite journal |author=Green MF |year=2006 |title=Cognitive impairment and functional outcome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=67 | issue=Suppl 9 |pages=3–8 |pmid=16965182}} < /ref > 
 
 ;Brain wiring 
 The human brain has 100 billion neurons; each one of these neurons are connected to many other neurons. One neuron may have as many as 20,000 connections; there is between 100 trillion and 500 trillion neural connections in the adult human brain. There are many different parts or 'regions' of the brain. To complete a task - like recalling a memory - usually more than one region of the brain is involved, and they are connected by neural networks which is like the brain's wiring. It is believed that there are problems with the brain's wiring in schizophrenia.

 ==Diagnosis== 
 The [[DSM IV|DSM-IV-TR]] or the [[ICD-10]] criteria are used to determine whether a person has schizophrenia. < ref name=Lancet09/ >  These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities (unusual occurrences) in the behavior of the person, followed by a clinical assessment. A person can be determined to have the disease only if the symptoms are severe. < ref name=BMJ07/ >

 |- 
 | 
 [[Europe]]an countries usually use [[ICD-10]] criteria, while the [[United States]] and the rest of the world usually use the [[Diagnostic and Staticians Manual]] (DSM). < ref name= " Jakobsen_et_al_2005 " > {{cite journal |author=Jakobsen KD, Frederiksen JN, Hansen T | display-authors = etal |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209–12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698| s2cid = 24590483 }} < /ref > 
 
 The DSM diagnostic criteria is divided into three categories: 
 # Characteristic symptoms: Two or more of these symptoms must each be present for much of the time during a one-month period (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment): 
 #* Delusions 
 #* Hallucinations 
 #* Disorganized speech, which is a manifestation of a formal thought disorder 
 #* Very disorganized behavior (such as dressing inappropriately or crying frequently) or [[catatonia|catatonic]] behavior (or being in a daze) 
 #* Negative symptoms, such as a lack of or decline in emotional response, speech, or motivation 
 #: If the delusions are bizarre, or if the person hears one imaginary voice making a running commentary of the person's actions or hears two or more voices talking with each other, then only that symptom (delusions or hallucinations) is required. The speech disorganization criterion is met only if it is severe enough to affect communication negatively and substantially. 
 # Social or work problems: For a significant portion of the time since symptoms began, one or more major areas of functioning, such as work, relationships, or self-care, are markedly below the level that the person achieved before. 
 # Significant duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if symptoms go away with treatment). 
 
 '''Subtypes''' 
 The DSM-IV-TR contains five subtypes of schizophrenia, although the developers of the next version of the DSM, DSM-5, recommend that these subtypes be dropped: < ref > [[American Psychiatric Association]] DSM-5 Work Groups (2010)[http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/SchizophreniaandOtherPsychoticDisorders.aspx Proposed Revisions – Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders]. Retrieved 17 February 2010. < /ref > < ref name=WHOICD/ > 
 * Paranoid subtype: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present. However, thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or lack of emotional response are not present. Delusions involve imagining that someone wants to harm the person or are very complex. Other themes, such as envy, extreme religious beliefs, or physical complaints, might also be present (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0). 
 * Disorganized subtype: This subtype is named “hebephrenic schizophrenia” in the ICD. Thought disorder and lack of emotional responsiveness are both present (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1). 
 * Catatonic subtype: The person might be almost immobile or might exhibit restless, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include acting as though one is in a daze. Or, one might passively allow others to pose one’s limbs and then stay in that position (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2). 
 * Undifferentiated subtype: Serious mental symptoms are present, but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types are not met (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3). 
 * Residual subtype: Positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5). 
 
 The ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes: < ref name=WHOICD > {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders |work=World Health Organization |page=26}} < /ref > 
 * Post-schizophrenic depression: People might have some minor schizophrenic symptoms and have [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]] after one of the five subtypes. (ICD code F20.4). 
 * Simple schizophrenia: Strong negative symptoms increase slowly over time, with no history of episodes of serious mental illness (ICD code F20.6).

 ===Differential diagnosis=== 
 There are various medical conditions, other psychiatric conditions and drug abuse related reactions that may mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia (meaning they have some or all of the same symptoms). For example, [[delirium]] can cause visual hallucinations, or an unpredictable changing levels of [[consciousness]]. Schizophrenia occurs along with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), a disorder in which a person becomes obsessed with certain ideas or actions. However, separating the obsessions of OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia can be difficult. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Bottas A |title=Comorbidity: Schizophrenia With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4|date=April 15, 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1402540 }} < /ref >

 ==Management==

 The treatment of schizophrenia is based upon the phase of the illness the person is in. There are three treatment phases:{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} 
 * ''Acute Phase'' 
 
 There are some goals during the acute phase of treatment. Some of these goals are to prevent [[harm]]. To prevent harm, the person being treated will have the severity of psychosis and it's symptoms reduced. These symptoms include [[agitation]], [[aggression]], [[Apathy|negative symptoms]], [[self-disorder]], and [[Thought disorder|thought disorders]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=NIMH » Schizophrenia|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml|access-date=2021-01-26|website=www.nimh.nih.gov}} < /ref >  Another goal is to find and treat the things that led to the episode of psychosis. Then, the person will be treated by trying to go back to how they were before psychosis. Lastly, the person will be helped by forming social connections and finding out what treatment plans work for them. Some treatment plans can be for a long time, and others can be for a short time. 
 * ''Stabilization Phase'' 
 The stabilization phase also has goals. One is to reduce the stress the person feels. Another is to prevent the person from experiencing psychosis again. Then, the person is helped further with social connection and getting better. If the person has improved with a medication, it is recommended they keep taking it for at least 6 months.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} 
 * ''Stable Phase'' 
 
 The last phase of treatment is to make sure that the person is improving. If the treatment has bad side effects, it may be changed in this phase. Some treatments during this stage are [[psychotherapy]] and [[medication]]. [[Antipsychotic]] medications greatly reduce the [[risk]] of the person experiencing psychosis again. They are strongly recommended. 
 ===Medication=== 
 [[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A 1960s era ad for ''Thorazine'', a commonly used antipsychotic]] 
 The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is [[antipsychotic]] medication, < ref name= " fn_72 " > {{cite web |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG82FullGuideline.pdf |title= Schizophrenia: Full national clinical guideline on core interventions in primary and secondary care |access-date=2009-11-25 |author=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health |date=2009-03-25 |agency= Gaskell and the British Psychological Society}} < /ref >  which can reduce the positive symptoms in about seven to fourteen days.

High concentrations of Dopamine are thought to be the cause of hallucinations and delusions. For this reason blocking Dopamine reception helps against hallucinations and delusions. 
 
 The British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) suggest checking for reactions to traumatic experiences, deciding together with a doctor about using medication, taking into account the side effect risks of getting diabetes, becoming seriously overweight, getting brain damage (tardive dyskinesia, 5% risk per year), men growing breasts, and feelings described as inner torture (akathesia). The guidelines warn against using more than one antipsychotic drug at the same time. 
 
 Some reviews of research sponsored by the makers of antipsychotic drugs claim that about 40 to 50 percent of people have a good response to medication, 30 to 40 percent have a partial response, and 20 percent have an unsatisfactory response (after 6 weeks on two or three different drugs). < ref name= " AFP10 "  / >  Other research from The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] were more negative and claimed that  " the clinical relevance of antipsychotics is in fact limited " .

 A drug called [[clozapine]] is an effective treatment for people who respond poorly to other drugs, but clozapine can lower the white blood cell count in 1 to 4 percent of people who take it.

 The British national guidelines for treatment (NICE) recommend for both people are at risk of getting schizophrenia and people who have got it, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy. Getting support from people who have become well from schizophrenia is also strongly recommended.

 ==Outlook== 
 Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs. < ref name=Lancet09/ >  The condition results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 to 15 years, primarily because of its association with being overweight, not exercising, and smoking cigarettes.

In 1893 [[Emil Kraepelin]] introduced a new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between ''dementia praecox'' and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). Kraepelin believed that ''dementia praecox'' was primarily a disease of the brain, < ref name= " fn_2 " > {{cite book |author=Kraepelin E, Diefendorf AR |title=Text book of psychiatry |edition=7 |year=1907 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London}} < /ref >  and a form of dementia, different from other forms of dementia such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] which usually happen later in life. < ref name= " fn_49 " > {{cite book |author=Hansen RA, Atchison B |title=Conditions in occupational therapy: effect on occupational performance |publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2000 |isbn=0-683-30417-8}} < /ref >

 In the early 1970s, the criteria for determining schizophrenia were the subject of numerous controversies. Schizophrenia was diagnosed far more often in the United States than in Europe. < ref name= " Wing1971 " > {{cite journal |author=Wing JK |title=International comparisons in the study of the functional psychoses |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_british-medical-bulletin_1971-01_27_1/page/77 |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=77–81 |date=January 1971  |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a070819 |pmid=4926366}} < /ref >  This difference was partly the result of looser criteria for determining whether someone had the condition in the United States, where the DSM-II manual was used. In Europe, the ICD-9 manual was used. A 1972 study, published in the journal Science, concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the United States was often unreliable. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Rosenhan D |year=1973|title=On being sane in insane places |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=179 |pages=250–8 |pmid=4683124| doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250|issue=4070|bibcode=1973Sci...179..250R|s2cid=146772269}} < /ref >  These factors resulted in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980 with a stricter and more defined criteria for the diagnosis. < ref name= " Wilson1993 " > {{cite journal |author=Wilson M |title=DSM-III and the transformation of American psychiatry: a history |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_american-journal-of-psychiatry_1993-03_150_3/page/399 |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=399–410 |date=March 1993 |doi=10.1176/ajp.150.3.399 |pmid=8434655 }} < /ref >

 In 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from “Seishin-Bunretsu-Byō”　精神分裂病 (“mind-split-disease”) to “Tōgō-shitchō-shō”　統合失調症 (“integration disorder”), in an attempt to reduce feelings of shame or embarrassment. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Kim Y, Berrios GE |title=Impact of the term schizophrenia on the culture of ideograph: the Japanese experience |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_schizophrenia-bulletin_2001_27_2/page/181 |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=181–5 |year=2001 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a006864 |pmid=11354585}} < /ref >  The idea that the disease is caused by multiple factors (not just one mental cause) inspired the new name.

 In the United States in 2002, the cost of schizophrenia, including direct costs (people who were not hospitalized, people who were hospitalized, medicines, and long-term care) and non-healthcare costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and [[unemployment]]), was estimated to be $62.7 billion. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Wu EQ|year=2005 |title=The economic burden of schizophrenia in the United States in 2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-clinical-psychiatry_2005-09_66_9/page/1122|journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 | issue=9|pages=1122–9|doi=10.4088/jcp.v66n0906 |pmid=16187769}} < /ref > 
 
 The book “A Beautiful Mind” and the film of the same name are about the life of [[John Forbes Nash]], an American [[mathematician]] and [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner who has schizophrenia. The movie “The Soloist” is based on the life of Nathaniel Ayers, a gifted musician who dropped out of the Julliard School, in New York City after the symptoms of schizophrenia began. He later became homeless in Los Angeles, California, in the notorious Skid Row section.
