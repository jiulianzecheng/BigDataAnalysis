 '''Jainism''' is a [[religion]] originally from [[India]]{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=4764}} that teaches that  " all the events in the [[universe]] are self-caused, random, fixed and are independent of previous events or external causes or god " : Jain [[philosophy]] is the oldest philosophy of India that distinguishes [[body]] (matter) from the [[soul]] (awareness) completely. < ref > {{citation|title=Dravya - Jainism|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]}} < /ref >  It teaches that the universe is eternal and that every living being has a soul which has the power to become all-knowing (observer of all the random events). A soul which has won over its inner enemies like attachment, [[greed]], [[pride]], etc. is called ''jina'' which means [[conqueror]] or victor (over ignorance). The holy book of Jainism is [[Pravachansara]].

 # Every [[soul]] is potentially [[divine]], with innate qualities of infinite knowledge, perception, power, and bliss (masked by its [[karma]]s). 
 # The universe is self-regulated, with all the events self-caused, and every soul has the potential to achieve divine [[consciousness]] (siddha) through its own efforts. 
 # There is no supreme divine creator, owner, preserver or destroyer. 
 # Therefore, Jainists think of every living being as themselves, harming no one and being kind to all living beings. 
 # Every soul is born as a [[celestial]], human, sub-human or hellish being according to its own [[Karma|karmas]]. 
 # Every soul is the [[architect]] of its own life, here or hereafter. < ref > Fisher, Mary Pat and Bailey, Lee W. An Anthology of Living Religions. New Jersey: Pearson Education, 2008. < /ref > 
 # When a soul is freed from karmas, it becomes free and attains divine consciousness, experiencing [[Infinity|infinite]] knowledge, perception, power, and bliss. < ref > Kastenbaum, Robert (2003)  " Macmillan Encyclopedia of Death and Dying  "  p. 491 < /ref > 
 # Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct (triple gems of Jainism) provide the way to this realization. < ref name= " Tatvarta Sutra " > {{cite web| url= http://www.jainworld.com/education/seniors/senles23.htm| title= Introduction to tattvartha-sutra| access-date= 2010-04-18| archive-date= 2011-05-14| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514102742/http://www.jainworld.com/education/seniors/senles23.htm| url-status= dead}} < /ref >   
 # [[Namokar Mantra|Navakar Mantra]] is the fundamental prayer in Jainism and can be recited at any time of the day. Praying by reciting this mantra, the devotee bows with respect to liberated souls still in human form (Arihantas), fully liberated souls (Siddhas), spiritual leaders (Acharyas), teachers (Upadyayas) and all the [[Monk|monks]]. By saluting them, Jains receive inspiration from them to follow their path to achieve true bliss and total freedom from the karmas binding their souls. In this main prayer, Jains do not ask for any favours or material benefits. This [[mantra]] serves as a simple gesture of deep respect towards beings who are more spiritually advanced. The mantra also reminds followers of the ultimate goal, [[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]. < ref > Jainism: The World of Conquerors By Natubhai Shah Published 1998 Sussex Academic Press < /ref > 
 # Jainism stresses on the importance of controlling the senses including the mind, as they can drag one far away from true nature of the soul. 
 # Limit [[Possession|possessions]] and lead a pure life that is useful to yourself and others. Owning an object by itself is not possessiveness; however attachment to an object is. < ref > Dulichand Jain (1998) Thus Spake Lord Mahavir, Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai, {{ISBN|978-81-7120-825-8}} Page 69 < /ref >  Non-possessiveness is the balancing of needs and desires while staying detached from our possessions. 
 # Enjoy the company of the holy and better qualified, be merciful to those afflicted souls and tolerate the perversely inclined. < ref > Prof. S.A.Jain. Reality - English Translation of ''Sarvarthasiddhi'' by Srimat Pujyapadacharya, 2nd Edition, Chapter 7, Page 195. < /ref > 
 # It is important not to waste human life in evil ways. Rather, strive to rise on the ladder of spiritual evolution. 
 # The goal of Jainism is liberation of the soul from the negative effects of unenlightened thoughts, speech and action. This goal is achieved through clearance of karmic obstructions by following the [[triple gems of Jainism]]. 
 # Jains mainly worship idols of Jinas, Arihants and [[Tirthankara|Tirthankars]], who have conquered the inner passions and attained divine consciousness. Jainism acknowledges the existence of powerful heavenly souls (Yaksha and Yakshini) that look after the well beings of Thirthankarars. Usually, they are found in pair around the idols of Jinas as male (yaksha) and female (yakshini) guardian deities. Even though they have supernatural powers, they are also wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like most other souls.
