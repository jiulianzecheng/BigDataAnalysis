 The island is divided into eight [[commune]]s: [[Portoferraio]], [[Campo nell'Elba]], [[Capoliveri]], [[Marciana]], [[Marciana Marina]], [[Porto Azzurro]], [[Rio Marina]] and [[Rio nell'Elba]]. The island has a [[population]] of about 30 000 people. 
 
 ==History== 
 The island was well known in to the last century for the [[iron]] resources. [[Mining|Mines]] were created by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s first and (after 480 BC) the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. After the end of the [[Roman Empire]], the island knew barbarians and [[Saracens]]. In the early [[11th century]] it became a part of the [[Republic of Pisa]]. In 1398, was sold to the [[Visconti]] family of Milan. After a few years, the island was acquired by the [[Appiani]], Lords of [[Piombino]], who kept it for two centuries. In 1546 part of the island was controlled by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]]. He [[fortification|fortified]] Portoferraio and renamed it  " Cosmopoli " . In 1577, the rest of the island was returned to the Appiani. In 1603 [[Philip II of Spain]] captured Porto Azzurro and built two [[fortress]]es there. 
 
 In 1802 the island became a part of [[France]]. Following the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau]], [[France|French]] emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] was exiled to Elba after his forced abdication in 1814 and arrived at Portoferraio on May 3, 1814 to begin his [[exile]] there. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of six hundred men. Napoleon stayed on Elba for 300 days before he escaped and returned to France on February 26 for the [[Hundred Days]]. Thanks to Napoleon Elba is well known around the world. In the [[Congress of Vienna]] the island was given to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. In 1860 it became part of the new unified [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].
