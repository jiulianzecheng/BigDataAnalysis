 '''''Devario''''' is a [[genus]] of fish. It is a relative of the [[aquarium]] fish ''[[Danio]]''. Generally, they are larger than ''Danio'', and have deeper bodies than ''Danio'' species. They have vertical or horizontal stripes. In size, they range from 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in). 
 
 They are native to the freshwater rivers and streams of [[southeast Asia]]. Many species are brightly coloured, and are available as aquarium fish. They are active swimmers, and do best in a long tank.
