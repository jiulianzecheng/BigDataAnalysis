 A '''mall''' or '''shopping center''' is a large [[building]] that is full of many smaller [[shop]]s and [[shop|store]]s.  It is different from earlier [[market]]s or [[bazaar]]s because most of the shops are not little [[booth]]s or [[stall]]s in one big open area.  Each store has its own space with walls.  Most of their entrances face a central walking area inside the building. 
 
 People visit the stores in the mall to [[shopping|shop]].  Most malls have [[parking lot]]s (places to park [[cars]]).  Most malls also have roofs so people can shop inside.  Most malls have a [[food court]] where people buy food.  Some malls have [[movie theatre]]s.
