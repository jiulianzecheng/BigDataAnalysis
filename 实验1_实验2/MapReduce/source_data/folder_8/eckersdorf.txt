 == History == 
 Eckersdorf was mentioned for the first time in 1149 in the  " Giechburgvertrag " . The Counts of Andechs-Meranien possessed the area of Eckersdorf until they died in 1248. The lords of Berg Plassenberg obtained property in the Eckersdorf area in 1420. A century later, the lords fully possessed Eckersdorf. In 1552, after the last member of the family died, Eckersdorf came under the control of the Lords of Lüchau, and then in 1757, it became part of Markgrafschaft Bayreuth. During the administrative reforms in Bavaria in 1818, the current municipality of Eckersdorf was established. Eckersdorf was part of the Prussian Principality of Bayreuth, and became a French possession through the Treaties of Tilsit until it was incorporated into Bavaria in 1810. < ref > [http://www.eckersdorf.de/texte/seite.php?id=35942 ''Geschichte (history, German language''].
