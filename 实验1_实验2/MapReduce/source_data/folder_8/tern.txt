 '''Terns''' are [[seabird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Laridae'''. They are normally found near the [[sea]], [[river]]s, or [[wetland]]s.  
 
 They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but some have dark [[plumage]] for part of the year.  
 
 Terns breed in noisy [[colony (biology)|colonies]] and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material. [[Marsh tern]]s make floating nests from the vegetation in their [[wetland]] habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices.  
 
 Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns may take small land [[vertebrate]]s. Many terns are long-distance [[migration|migrants]], and the [[Arctic tern]] may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.
