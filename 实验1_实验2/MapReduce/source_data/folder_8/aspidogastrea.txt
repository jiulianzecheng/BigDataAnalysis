 The '''Aspidogastrea''' (gr. ''aspid'' - shield, ''gaster'' - stomach/pouch) is a small group of [[fluke]]s. There are about 80 [[species]].  
 
 The group is a [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of the [[Trematoda]], and sister group to the [[Digenea]]. Species are between approximately one mm to several cm long. They are [[parasite]]s of [[freshwater]] and [[ocean|marine]] [[mollusc]]s and [[vertebrate]]s ([[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[Actinopterygii|bony]] [[fish]]es and [[turtle]]s). Maturation may occur in the [[mollusc]] or [[vertebrate]] host.  
 
 None of the species has any [[economic]] importance, but the group is of very great interest to [[biologist]]s because it has several characters which appear to be [[basal]].
