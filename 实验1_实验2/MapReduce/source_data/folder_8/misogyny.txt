'''Misogyny''' is the hatred of [[Woman|women]], or the belief that women should be kept down at a lower place in society, under the control of men. Using [[Sexism|sexist]] ideas and [[violence against women]], misogyny punishes women who try to rise in society. A society that sets men above women is called [[patriarchy]]. Misogyny supports patriarchy by keeping women under men. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2018-08-15|title=Kate Manne, Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, Oxford University Press, 2017|url=https://kiej.georgetown.edu/kate-manne-girl-logic-misogyny-oxford-university-press-2017/|access-date=2023-01-29|website=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Sometimes misogyny rewards women for accepting a lower place. 
 
 Misogyny is a very old idea. It can be seen in stories, religion, laws, and customs around the world. It is both a belief held by individuals, and a social custom or system. A '''misogynist''' is a person who hates women. Misogynists may hate women because they believe there is something wrong with them, such as being stupid, dirty or evil. Some misogynists claim to love women, or certain women, while keeping them at a lower place. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 When women practice misogyny on themselves or each other, this is called ''internalized misogyny''. Women who have internalized misogyny may view other women as an enemy. This may damage friendships among women. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Jani|first=Aastha|last2=Jani|first2=Aastha|date=2020-08-30|title=6 Things Internalised Misogyny Ruined For Women|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2020/08/31/6-things-internalised-misogyny-ruined-for-women/|access-date=2023-01-29|website=Feminism in India|language=en-GB}} < /ref >
