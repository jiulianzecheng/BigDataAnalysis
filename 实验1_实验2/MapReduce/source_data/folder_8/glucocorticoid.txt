 '''Glucocorticoids''' ('''GCs''') are [[steroid hormone]]s made in our [[adrenal gland]]s. They bind to [[cell receptor]]s. < ref name =  " Pelt_2011 " > {{cite book | vauthors = Pelt AC | title = Glucocorticoids: effects, action mechanisms, and therapeutic uses | year = 2011 | publisher = Nova Science | location = Hauppauge, N.Y. | isbn = 978-1617287589 }} < /ref >  Glucocorticoids  regulate [[glucose]] [[metabolism]].   
 
 GCs are part of the feedback system for the [[immune system]]. They do things like reducing [[inflammation]]. They stimulate the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbons, such as [[protein]]s.  
 
 They are important in [[foetus|foetal]] development, promoting the maturing of the lungs, and are essential for brain development.

 Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor on cells. The newly formed complex moves into the [[cell nucleus]], where it binds to a region on the target [[gene]]s. This regulates [[gene expression]]. This process is referred to as [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] activation, or transactivation. < ref name= " Newton2007 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Newton R, Holden NS | title = Separating transrepression and transactivation: a distressing divorce for the glucocorticoid receptor? | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 799â€“809 | date = Oct 2007 | pmid = 17622575 | doi = 10.1124/mol.107.038794 | s2cid = 52803631 }} < /ref > 
 
 The proteins encoded by these up-regulated genes have a wide range of effects, including, for example: < ref name= " Newton2007 " / > 
 * [[immunology|immunological]]: anti-inflammatory (reduces [[inflammation]] or swelling) 
 * [[metabolism|metabolic]]: makes more glucose 
 
 A variety of synthetic glucocortisoids have been developed for medical use.  In addition to the above two purposes, glucocorticoids play important roles in [[foetus|foetal]] development, and body fluid [[homeostasis]].
