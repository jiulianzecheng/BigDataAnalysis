 == The land and weather == 
 Corsica is the most mountainous Mediterranean island. The low ground has a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Summers are hot and dry. Winters are mild with moderate rainfall. The climate of the high ground is cold and is wetter. The natural [[vegetation]] is Mediterranean forests, [[woodlands]], and [[shrubs]]. The mountains are rich of forests of [[oak]], and [[pine]], except for the high ground. Much of the coastal lowlands has been cleared for [[agriculture]], which has reduced the mountain forests considerably. The island has a natural park ([[Parc Naturel Régional de Corse]]), which protects thousands of rare animal and plant species. The park was created in 1972 and includes the [[Golfe de Porto]], the [[Réserve Naturelle de Scandola]] (a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]), and some of the highest mountains on the island. This park is protected.

 == Administration == 
 [[File:Corsica.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Map of Corsica]] 
 The capital of the territorial collectivity of Corsica is [[Ajaccio]] ({{lang-co|Aiacciu}}). The territorial collectivity is divided in two ''[[département in France|départements]]'': [[Corse-du-Sud]] and [[Haute-Corse]]. These two ''départements'' were created on [[September 15]], [[1975]] by the ''département'' of Corse. 
 
 == Economy == 
 [[File:Propriano 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Corsica's spectacular coastline is a major drive for tourism (here by the town of [[Propriano]]).]] 
 Tourism is the biggest source of Corsican economy. The island has a pleasant climate, beautiful mountains and really beautiful coastlines that make it a popular destination among the French and other Western Europeans. However, the island has not had the same level of intensive development as other parts of the Mediterranean. Tourism is particularly concentrated in the area around Porto Vecchio and Bonifacio in the south of the island and Calvi in the northwest. 
 
 == Politics == 
 Corsica is currently governed almost as any other ''[[région in France|région]]'' of France. There are lots of movements on the island the independence of Corsica and of Corsicans from France. The French government is against full independence. There is support on the island for to have more autonomy, but [[polls]] show that a large majority of Corsicans are opposed to full independence. Some groups who claim to support Corsican independence have carried out a violent campaign since the 1970s that includes [[bombing]]s and a few accidental [[assassination]]s, usually against ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'' and other non-Corsicans, or buildings of the French government. Corsican independence groups attack when they are sure there won't be a danger for victims. However, not all groups for independence has  " nice treaties " , Sometimes independence groups are known to practice [[extortion]] and other [[intimidation|intimidatory]] tactics, similar to [[mafia]] activity in [[Sicily]] and southern [[Italy]]. Non-Corsican homeowners may be threatened with the destruction of their home, or they are constrict to pay a  " revolutionarian tax " ,for to help the groups in the attacks. 
 
 In [[2000]], [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]] agreed to give more autonomy to Corsica but just for stopping the violence. The propose of autonomy for Corsica would have included greater protection for the [[Corsican language]] (Corsu), the island's traditional language (which is also considered to be a dialect of [[Italian language|Italian]]). However, the plans for increased autonomy were opposed by the [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] opposition in the [[French National Assembly]]. In a [[referendum]] on [[July 6]],[[2003]], a narrow majority of Corsican voters opposed to the project from the government of [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] that would have suppressed the two ''départements'' of the island and granted more autonomy to the territorial collectivity of Corsica. 
 
 ==  " U Corsu " , language of Corsica == 
 In Corsica the official language is [[French language|French]], but lots of people speak,  " u corsu " , the language of Corsica, protected by UNESCO. Corsu shares some similarities with Tuscan dialects (with their accents) or to Gallurese language, spoken in the nearby island of [[Sardinia]]. Corsu has two varietes,  " Supranacciu " , common in the northeast of theisland, ([[Bastia]], [[Corte]]), and the  " Suttanacciu "  common in the south of the island, ([[Ajaccio]], [[Sartene]]). The native Corsican language is closer to Italian than French, but both come from Latin. The ancient Romans spoke Latin.
