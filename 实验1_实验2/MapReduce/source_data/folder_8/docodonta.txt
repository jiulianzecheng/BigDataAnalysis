 '''Docodonta''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] or [[suborder]] of [[extinct]] [[Mammaliaformes|mammaliaforms]]. They lived during the mid- to late-[[Mesozoic]] [[era]].   
 
 They had sophisticated [[molars]], from which the suborder gets its name. In the fossil record, isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found. < ref > [http://palaeos.com/vertebrates/mammaliformes/mammaliformes2.html Docodonta from Palaeos] < /ref >    
 
 Docodonts are not quite as closely related to the [[placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s as the [[monotreme]]s are, so they are not included among the [[Crown group | crown-group]] mammals.  
 
 Because of their molars and their [[lower jaw]] being a single bone (the [[dentary]]), they are generally regarded as mammals. However, those authors who limit the term  " Mammalia "  to the (living) [[crown group]] exclude docodonts. They use the term [[mammaliaformes]] instead. 
 
 Docodonts were primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] or [[Insectivore|insectivorous]]. However, ''[[Castorocauda]]'', adapted to a semi-[[aquatic]] life, has teeth which suggest it ate fish. 
 
 ''Castorocauda'' is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology). It breaks the  " small nocturnal insectivore "  stereotype. < ref name= " JiLuoYuanTabrumCastorocauda " > {{Cite journal|date=2006|title=A swimming mammaliaform from the Middle Jurassic and ecomorphological diversification of early mammals |journal=Science |volume=311|issue=5764|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5764/1123|pmid=16497926|doi=10.1126/science.1123026|pages=1123–7|bibcode = 2006Sci...311.1123J |s2cid=46067702|last1=Ji|first1=Qiang|last2=Luo|first2=Zhe-Xi|last3=Yuan|first3=Chong-Xi|last4=Tabrum|first4=Alan R.}} See also the news item at {{Cite web| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0223_060223_beaver.html | title=Jurassic  " beaver "  found; rewrites history of mammals}} < /ref > 
 It was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils, and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Of course, this strongly suggests mammalian-type [[temperature regulation]].
