 A '''bartender''' (also known as a '''barkeep''', '''barman''', '''barmaid''', '''barwoman''', '''bar chef''', '''tapster''', '''mixologist''', '''alcohol server''', '''cocktologist''', '''flairman''' or an '''alcohol chef''') is a person who creates and serves alcoholic or soft drink [[beverage]]s behind the [[bar]],  in a licensed [[bar|establishment]]. Bartenders also usually have the supplies and inventory for the bar. A bartender can generally mix [[classic cocktails]]. 
 
 Bartenders are also usually responsible for confirming that customers meet the [[legal drinking age]] requirements before serving them [[alcoholic beverages]]. In certain countries, such as [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Sweden]], bartenders are legally required to refuse more alcohol to drunk customers. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/courses_rsa.asp |title=OLGR  >  Information and training for students and staff  >  |website=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |access-date=2015-12-12 |archive-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022114543/http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/courses_rsa.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
