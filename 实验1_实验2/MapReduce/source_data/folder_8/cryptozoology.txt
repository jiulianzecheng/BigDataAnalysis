'''Cryptozoology''' is the study of [[animal]]s that people think might exist, but can't be proved to exist. It also is the study of animals many [[scientist]]s think are [[extinction|extinct]], but which people sometimes report. Those who study or look for such animals are called ''cryptozoologists.'' Some people call the unproven creatures '''cryptids.''' [[John Wall]] was the first person to use this word in 1983.

 === Mongolian Death Worm === 
 The '''Mongolian Death Worm''' is a strange [[snake]]-like animal that lives in the [[Gobi Desert]]. Scientists do not know if it really exists or not.  
 
 People who report seeing it say it is like a red, fat worm around 2 â€“ 4 feet long. People who live in [[Mongolia]] call it ''allghoi khorkhoi''. These people also say the creature spits yellow poison that will kill you as soon as it touches you and it can produce [[electricity]] so powerful that it could kill large animals. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://news.mongabay.com/2005/05/scientists-search-for-mongolian-death-worm/|title=Scientists search for Mongolian Death Worm|date=3 May 2005|website=Mongabay Environmental News}} < /ref >
