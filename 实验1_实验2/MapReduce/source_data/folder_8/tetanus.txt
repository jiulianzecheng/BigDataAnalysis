 '''Tetanus''' (or '''lockjaw''') is a [[disease]] that leads to [[muscle]] contractions that stay that way for some time. 
 
 Infection generally occurs through [[wound]] [[Contamination|contaminatio]] < nowiki/ > n, and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound. The main symptoms are caused by [[tetanospasmin]], a [[neurotoxin]] produced by the [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacterium]] ''[[Clostridium tetani]]''. As the infection goes on, muscle spasms develop in the jaw. This is usually followed by problems with [[swallowing]]. The disease leads to muscle stiffness and [[spasm]] < nowiki/ > s in other parts of the body. < ref name= " Baron " > {{cite book | author = Wells CL, Wilkins TD | title = Clostridia: Sporeforming Anaerobic Bacilli.
