 ==Live performances== 
 Since they are an animated group, they cannot perform live, like other bands can. At Gorillaz concerts, the real members of the band stand behind screens which show [[computer-generated]] images of the animated group performing. 
 
 Despite the animated performances, the actual band members did go on tour as the Gorillaz (which the animated band referred to as ''that Gorillaz tribute band''), playing at various venues across the states, headlining at Coachella. The live Gorillaz band played at the 2010 Glastonbury Festival, performing in place of u2 due to Bono's emergency back surgery. Nevertheless, they were a hit with the crowd.
