 '''Nitroglycerin''', also known as '''nitroglycerine''' (UK spelling), '''trinitroglycerin''', '''trinitroglycerine''', '''1''','''2''','''3-trinitroxypropane'''  and '''glyceryl trinitrate''', is a [[heavy]], [[colorless]], [[Oil|oily]], [[Explosive material|explosive]] [[liquid]] obtained by [[Nitrate|nitrating]] glycerol. It is very dangerous and easy to [[detonation|detonate]]. It was synthesized in 1847 by Italian chemist [[Ascanio Sobrero]]. [[Alfred Nobel]] used it to make one of the most famous explosives in the world during 1867, named [[dynamite]]. 
 
 == Medical Uses == 
 Nitroglycerine is also used in some [[Medication|medicines]] because it is a [[Vasodilation|vasodilator]].  This means it makes the [[blood vessel]]s get wider.  That makes it easier for [[blood]] to flow through them. 
 
 Nitroglycerine is used mostly for [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and some [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] caused by [[coronary artery disease]]. < ref name=x > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601086.html |title=Nitroglycerine Sublingual |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=October 15, 2015 |website=nlm.nih.gov |publisher=US. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   This is a disease that makes the blood vessels that bring blood to the heart get narrower.  When the heart does not get enough blood and [[oxygen]], a person can have [[angina]] (chest pain) or a heart attack.  Taking nitroglycerine makes the blood vessels get wider again, so more blood and oxygen can get to the heart. < ref name=x / > 
 
 Nitroglycerin is sometimes used in emergencies for other [[medical conditions]] caused by narrow blood vessels.
