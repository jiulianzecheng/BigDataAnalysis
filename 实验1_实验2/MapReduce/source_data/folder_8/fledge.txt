 '''Fledge''' is the stage in a young [[bird]]'s life when the feathers and [[wing]] muscles become developed enough for flight. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fledge |title=Fledge - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |first= |last= |work=merriam-webster.com |year=2011 |accessdate=11 December 2011}} < /ref >  It also [[wikt:describe|describes]] the act of a chick's parents raising it until it is fully grown. A young bird that has recently fledged but still needs care and feeding is called a  '''fledgling'''. 
 
 In [[ornithology]], fledging has many meanings, depending on species. Birds are sometimes [[wikt:consider|considered]] fledged once they leave the [[bird nest|nest]], even if they still cannot fly.
