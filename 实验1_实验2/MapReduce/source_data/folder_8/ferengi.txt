The '''Ferengi''' are a [[fiction]]al group of space people on ''[[Star Trek]]''.  They first appeared in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1987.  They are also in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. < ref name=E > {{cite journal|title=Ferengi Business Practices in  " Star Trek: Deep Space Nine " --To Enhance Student Engagement and Teach a Wide Range of Business Concepts (Abstract)|author1=Lopez, Katherine J.|author2= Pletcher, Gary|author3= Williams, Craig L.|author4= Zehner, William Bradley, II|publisher=e-Journal of Business Education and Scholarship of Teaching| volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=19–56 |year=2017|accessdate=December 12, 2021|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1167337}} < /ref > 
 ==Appearance== 
 [[File:Mannequin in Ferengi Makeup and Uniform.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mannequin]] showing Ferengi makeup and costume.]] 
 The Ferengi are shorter than humans.  They have bald heads, large ears and small teeth.  They have noses with deep ridges in them.  Most Ferengi are played by short actors in heavy makeup. 
 
 Many male Ferengi characters wear colorful clothes and some have hats that cover the backs of their heads but not the tops of their heads. 
 
 ==Culture== 
 
 The Ferengi have a very [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] culture.  Ferengi think [[greed]] is good.  In the Ferengi culture, men are supposed to gain wealth. There is a saying:  " A Ferengi without [[profit]] is no Ferengi at all. "  Money, payment, and contracts are a big part of life.  For example, a guest in a house can be charged admission. 
 
 The Ferengi home planet is called Ferenginar.  The capital city has a Tower of Commerce that holds the leader's office.  The leader of the Ferengi is called the Grand Nagus.  The Ferengi call themselves  " The Ferengi Alliance, "  not  " Empire "  or  " Federation. " 
 
 Ferengi culture is very male-dominated.  Women are not supposed to wear clothes or appear in public.  During the ''Deep Space Nine'' run, a Ferengi [[feminism|feminist]] named Ishka becomes the Grand Nagus's chief financial advisor.  She helps Ferengi women gain more rights. 
 
 In the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode  " Little Green Men, "  three characters talk about the Ferengi [[afterlife]].  It has [[reincarnation]].  Ferengi believe that if they have lived well, they will bid on new lives, like in an [[auction]].  If they have lived badly, they will go to the Vault of Eternal Destitution. 
 
 ===Rules of Acquisition=== 
 Ferengi characters on ''Star Trek'' often say the Rules of Acquisition.  They are similar to [[proverb]]s.  They are about how to get (acquire) wealth.  Some of the Rules are  " War is good for business, "   " Peace is good for business, "   " Never have sex with the boss' sister, "  and  " Greed is eternal. "  There are 285 Rules of Acquisition. < ref name=A > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CUKq6v39e0C & dq=ferengi & pg=PP6|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition|author=Ira Steven Behr|date=July 1995|accessdate=December 12, 2021|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439108505}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Origin== 
 
 The word  " Ferengi "  comes from the Persian word for  " foreigner, "  usually a Westerner. < ref name=ST > {{cite web |publisher=StarTrek.com |author=Natesh Srivastava |url=https://www.startrek.com/news/defining-alien-names-from-cardassian-to-vulcan |date=March 17, 2021 |accessdate=December 12, 2021 |title=Defining Alien Names, from Cardassian to Vulcan}} < /ref >   The ''Star Trek'' writers wanted a race of people they could use to tell stories about capitalism and 20th and 21st century Western culture. 
 
 The first idea for the Ferengi was that they would be the main [[antagonist|enemy]] aliens in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', but they were not scary enough.  After that, the writers used the Ferengi for [[comic relief]], to tell the funny parts of their stories. 
 
 ==Criticism== 
 
 Some critics have said the Ferengi are too much like [[Antisemitism|stereotypes of]] [[Jew]]s. < ref name=R > {{cite journal|url=https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/kinema/article/view/1046/1182|accessdate=December 12, 2021|year=2003|title= Racial Issues and Star Trek's Deep Space Nine|author= J.
