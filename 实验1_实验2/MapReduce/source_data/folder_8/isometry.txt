 '''Isometry''' < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-01-21|title=Isometry|url=https://calcworkshop.com/transformations/isometry/|access-date=2023-06-01|website=Calcworkshop|language=en-US}} < /ref >  is a concept of [[geometry]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2023-05-14|title=Geometry {{!}} Definition, History, Basics, Branches,  &  Facts {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/geometry|access-date=2023-06-01|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref >  Isometry means that one shape can be transformed into another, but [[Metric space|metrics]] such as the arrangement of the points in relation to each other stay the same. An isometry is a special way of changing things that makes sure the [[distance]] between every two points stays the same in both places.An isometry is a special kind of function that moves points around from one place to another. Some of these ways include turning objects, moving them in a straight line, [[flipping]] them, sliding them, or not moving them at all. 
 
 Most [[transformation]] that repeats itself after every two moves can either be a mirror image or a rotation by half. Every [[movement]] in a flat surface can be made by reflecting < ref > {{Cite web|last=Nunes|first=Vitor|title=Isometries: Reflection|url=https://www.matematica.pt/|access-date=2023-06-01|website=matematica.pt|language=en}} < /ref >  it at most three times. Every small group of transformations has at least one point that doesn't move. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Isometry|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/|access-date=2023-06-01|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref >  To be an isometry, a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] needs to keep the distances between all points in both places the same. The distance from x to y is the same as the distance from f(x) to f(y). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Isometries Preserve Distances|url=http://new.math.uiuc.edu/public403/isometries/distance.html|access-date=2023-06-01|website=new.math.uiuc.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 If you draw something and then move it a certain way, the distances between the points on the first drawing will be the same as on the new drawing. Isometries are useful tools in many areas of [[mathematics]], < ref > {{Cite web|title=Isometry: Meaning, Types, Examples  &  Transformation|url=https://www.studysmarter.us/explanations/math/geometry/isometry/|access-date=2023-06-01|website=StudySmarter US|language=en-US|archive-date=2023-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230601053548/https://www.studysmarter.us/explanations/math/geometry/isometry/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  such as studying shapes, patterns, and how numbers behave. [[Metric system|Metric]] spaces are helpful in Math because they help us study things like [[symmetry]], [[congruence]], and transformations. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Transformations|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/transformations.html|access-date=2023-06-01|website=www.mathsisfun.com}} < /ref >
