 '''Whisky''', or '''whiskey''', is an [[alcohol]]ic drink distilled from [[grain]] and aged in [[wood]]en {{broken wikt link|cask|casks}}. 
 
 The name comes from a [[gaelic]] word. In [[Ireland]], it is called '''whiskey''', with an added letter ''''e''''. Whiskey made in the [[United States]] often uses the Irish spelling. 
 
 There are many kinds of whisky, of which most important are: 
 
 * '''Single malt''': All of the whisky has been made from single batch of malt in one single distillery. They have been matured in oak barrels, usually 6 to 24 years. ''Glenfiddich'' is the world's best-selling single malt whisky. It comes from [[Speyside]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]], and accounts for 35% of world sales. < ref > About whisky: http://www.scotchwhisky.com/english/about/malts/regduff.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527050410/http://www.scotchwhisky.com/english/about/malts/regduff.htm |date=2008-05-27 }} < /ref >  ''The Glenlivet'' comes second, from the same area. Thus, despite all attempts at competition, this small area near the Spey River still dominates the world market for single malt whisky.  < br/ > Other well-known single malts are ''Laphroaig'', ''Lagavulin'', ''Bowmore'', ''Ardbeg'' and ''Talisker''. Most single malts come from [[Scotland]], either Lowlands, Highlands or Scottish Isles. ''Nikka Yoichi'' comes from [[Japan]]. 
 * '''Blended whisky''' or '''Scotch''': A Scotch is a mixture of various single malts. This is the most common type of whisky. Famous blended whiskys are ''Johnnie Walker'', ''Chivas Regal'', ''Ballantines'', ''J & B'', ''The Famous Grouse'' and ''Vat-69''. In the United States the word  " scotch "  refers to the blended whiskys of Scotland. Blenders do not distill whisky, but mix various single malts. 
 * '''Irish whiskey''': These are blended whiskeys from Ireland. While Scottish whiskys are distilled twice, Irish whiskeys are distilled three times before they are matured. Famous Irish whiskeys are ''Jameson's'' and ''Bushmill's''. 
 * [[Bourbon whiskey]]: Bourbon is American whiskey which contains maize. It may all be made from maize (corn whiskey) or it may also contain barley malt. Famous bourbons are ''Four Roses'', ''Jim Beam'' and ''Kentucky Gentleman''. The name comes from Bourbon county, [[Kentucky]]. 
 * '''Rye''': As name implies, rye whiskey is made from rye malt. These are especially popular in Canada. Famous Canadian rye whiskeys are ''[[Canadian Club]]'' and ''Alberta Premium'' 
 
 Most whiskys contain around 40% alcohol.

 Scotch whisky is legally defined by Scotch Whisky Order of 1990 (UK), < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1990/Uksi_19900998_en_1.htm |title=The Scotch Whisky Order 1990 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=2006-12-22}} < /ref >  and the Scotch Whisky Act of 1988,. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880022_en_1.htm |title=Scotch Whisky Act 1988 (c. 22) |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=2006-12-22}} < /ref > 
 
 These say that Scotch whisky must: 
 # Must be distilled at a Scottish {{broken wikt link|distillery|distillery}} from water and malted [[barley]], to which only other whole grains may be added, have been processed at that distillery into a mash, converted to a [[fermentation (food)|fermentable]] substrate only by [[endogenous]] enzyme systems, and fermented only by the addition of yeast, 
 # Must be distilled to an [[alcoholic proof|alcoholic strength]] of less than 94.8% by volume so that it retains the flavour of the raw materials used in its production, 
 # Must be matured in Scotland in oak casks for no less than three years, 
 # Must not contain any added substance other than water and [[caramel]] colouring, and 
 # May not be bottled at less than 40% alcohol by volume. 
 
 Alcohol is a favorite way to collect tax (called [[Excise tax|excise duty]]) in the United Kingdom. When [[Gordon Brown]], a [[Scotland|Scot]], became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], he concentrated on taxing [[beer]]s and [[wine]]s, and did not increased the duty on whisky. This, he said, was to help the Scotch whisky industry to recover, increase [[export]]s and make more money.{{fact|date=December 2018}}
