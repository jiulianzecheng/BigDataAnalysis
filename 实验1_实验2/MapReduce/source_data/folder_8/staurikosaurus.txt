 '''''Staurikosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Upper Triassic]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaurs]] found in [[Brazil]]. < ref > Nesbitt S.J. ''et al.'' 2009. A complete skeleton of a late Triassic saurischian and the early evolution of dinosaurs. ''Science'' '''326''':1530-1533. < /ref >  It was a small, lightly built [[carnivore]]. < ref name=age > ''Staurikosaurus''. In: Dodson, Peter ''et al.'' ''The age of dinosaurs''. Publications International, p45 {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}. < /ref > 
 
 The rarity of ''Staurikosaurus'' remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive, or because it lived in an [[environment]] such as a [[forest]], where fossils rarely form. < ref name=age/ > 
 
 ==Description== 
 [[File:Human-staurikosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|right|Size comparison between ''Staurikosaurus'' and a human.]] 
 
 At just {{convert|2.25|m|ft}}, < ref name= " caudalposition " > Grillo O.N. and Azevedo S.A.K. 2011. Recovering missing data: estimating position and size of caudal vertebrae in ''Staurikosaurus pricei'' Colbert, 1970. ''Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences'', < /ref >  80 & nbsp;centimetres tall (31 & nbsp;in), and weighing just 30 & nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (66 & nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]), ''Staurikosaurus'' was small in comparison to later theropods like ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. ''Staurikosaurus'' and the related ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' are definitely theropods and [[Evolution|evolved]] after the [[sauropod]] line had split from the theropods. 
 
 The fossil record of ''Staurikosaurus'' is poor, but the skeletal structure of the legs is known. ''Staurikosaurus'' was a quick runner for its size. It also had just two [[vertebra]]e joining the [[pelvis]] to the [[vertebral column|spine]], a distinctly [[basal|primitive]] arrangement. 
 
 The available teeth for Staurikosaurus strongly suggest a carnivorous diet. 
 
 === Tail === 
 The tail of ''Staurikosaurus'' was relatively long (with more than 40 vertebrae) compared to the rest of its body and was held straight and off the ground as it ran.  The rear part of ''Staurikosaurus'''s tail is stiffened by features of the tail vertebrae.  Ostrom thought this was a dynamic stabilizer to help [[balance]] while leaping and running. < ref > Ostrom J.H. 1969. Osteology of ''[[Deinonychus|Deinonychus antirrhopus]]'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana. ''Peabody Museum Bulletin'' '''30''':1-165 < /ref >
