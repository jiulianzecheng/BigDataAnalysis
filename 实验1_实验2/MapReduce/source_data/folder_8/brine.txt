'''Brine''' is [[water]] that has more than 5% [[table salt|salt]] in it. It is used for [[food preservation|preserving]] [[food]]. For this it is much like [[vinegar]] or [[sugar]]. Brine is also used to transport [[heat]]. Adding salt to water lowers the [[freezing point]] of the water. The [[solubility]] of salt in water depends on temperature. At 15.5°[[Celsius|C]], a saturated solution of brine can hold 26.4 % salt by weight. At 0°C, it can hold 23.3% salt. 
 
 Brines also have some [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] properties, which can be used to treat people, especially those with [[diseases]] of the [[skin]], [[allergy|allergies]] and [[common cold]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Panagopoulos|first1=Argyris|last2=Haralambous|first2=Katherine-Joanne|date=2020-10-01|title=Minimal Liquid Discharge (MLD) and Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) strategies for wastewater management and resource recovery – Analysis, challenges and prospects|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343720307673|journal=Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering|language=en|volume=8|issue=5|pages=104418|doi=10.1016/j.jece.2020.104418|s2cid=225309628|issn=2213-3437}} < /ref >
