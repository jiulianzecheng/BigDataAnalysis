 '''Zhytomyr''' ({{lang-uk|Житомир}}) is a city in [[Ukraine]], the administrative center of [[Zhytomyr Oblast]]. Nearly 271 000 people live here ({{asof|2009|7|lc=on}}). 
 
 Zhytomyr is a big transportation center. The city lies on a historic way that connects the city of [[Kyiv]] with the west through [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Today it connects [[Warsaw]] with Kyiv, [[Minsk]] with [[Izmail]], and several major cities of [[Ukraine]]. Zhytomyr was also the location of Ozerne, an important [[Cold War]] strategic plane base that was situated {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the city. 
 
 Zhytomyr is divided into two districts. It is located on the [[Teteriv River]]. 
 
 As a legend says, Zhytomyr was founded about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of Drevlians. This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, that stands on the hill where it was founded.
