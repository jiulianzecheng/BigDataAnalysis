 '''Papaya''' is a tall [[herbaceous plant]] in the [[genus]] '''''Carica'''''; its [[Eat|edible]] [[fruit]] is also called papaya. It is [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to the [[tropical]] region of [[America]], mainly from southern [[Mexico]] to [[Central America]]. Now these plants are grown in all [[tropical]] regions of the world. < ref name= " morton " > {{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/papaya_ars.html|title=Papaya and related species|accessdate=20 July 2009

 Papayas are plants of tropical regions and, for growth and fruit production, they need a warm climate. They cannot live with low [[temperature]]s. < ref name= " crfg " > {{cite web|url=http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/papaya.html|title=Papaya fruit facts|accessdate=19 July 2006|publisher=California Rare Fruit Growers|archive-date=21 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521003913/http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/papaya.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 This is now the only [[species]] in its genus. As a result of genetic research, the other species were put in three new genera. < ref > Aradhya M.K. ''et al'' 1999.

 == Names == 
 The genus ''Carica'' was given that name by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] because the [[Leaf|leaves]] of these plants are like those of the [[common fig]] (''Ficus carica''). 
 
 The [[common name]] comes from the [[Taíno]] word ''papáia'' that was changed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to '''papaya''', the word most used worldwide, with some changes. In Australia and some countries of the [[Caribbean]], the fruit is called ''papaw'' or ''pawpaw'' but another [[North America]]n plant, ''Asimina triloba'' of the [[Annonaceae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] has also that name. 
 
 The [[French language|French]] name for the fruit is ''papaye'' and ''papayer'' for the plant. In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the fruit is called ''mamão'', ''papaia'' or ''ababaia'' and the tree ''mamoeiro'' or ''papaeira''. In Kerala it commonly known as Kapanga - കപ്പങ്ങ. In Spanish, there are other names besides papaya. In [[Cuba]], it is called ''fruta bomba'' except in the eastern provinces where papaya is used. In the [[Dominican Republic]], Los Llanos ([[Venezuela]]) and Eastern Central Colombia, the name is ''lechosa''. In [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]], the fruit is called ''mamón''. < ref name= " morton "  / >

 == Overview == 
 [[File:Carica papaya seedlings.jpg|thumbnail|Papaya seedlings.]] 
 It is a large plant, like a [[tree]], usually without [[branch]]es; it is a herbaceous plant because the stem does not have much [[wood]] and remains soft and green until its death. The single [[Plant stem|stem]] grows from 5 to 10 m tall with all the [[Leaf|leaves]] on the top. The leaves are large, 50–70 & nbsp;cm wide. 
 
 Some plants have perfect (with female and male organs) flowers but other plants have flowers with only one sex (female or male). 
 
 Generally, the fruit is oval to nearly round and, in some cases, like a big [[pear]]. Fruits are 15-50 [[Centimetre|cm]] [[long]] and 10–20 & nbsp;cm [[wide]], and [[Weight|weigh]] up to 9 [[Kilogram|kg]]. < ref name= " morton "  / > 
 
 The [[skin]] of the fruit is thin and tough; it is not eaten because is too [[bitter]]. First, the skin is green but it changes to [[yellow]] in [[ripe]] fruits, ready to be eaten. In a ripe fruit, the pulp is [[yellow]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[pink]], and even light [[red]]. Inside the fruit, there are many small [[black]] [[seed]]s. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Ripe papayas are eaten fresh, after taking out the skin and the seeds; sometimes, they are cut in small pieces and mixed with other fruits for a fruit [[salad]]. Papayas that are not completely ripe can be cut in pieces and cooked with [[sugar]] and eaten as [[dessert]]. < ref name= " morton "  / >  In tropical regions, it is very popular to take papaya juice, after taking the skin and seeds out; this juice can be mixed with [[milk]] to make [[smoothie]]s. 
 
 Green papayas, those that are not ripe, are eaten in some [[Asia]]tic countries in salads, [[curry|curries]] and [[soup]]s but they should be [[Boiling|boiled]] before eating them. Young leaves and stems are also cooked as a [[vegetable]]. < ref name= " duke " > {{cite web

 The papaya is a source of [[iron]] and [[calcium]]; a good source of [[vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[B vitamin complex|B]] and [[Riboflavin]] and an excellent source of [[vitamin C]] (ascorbic acid). < ref name= " morton "  / > 
 
 The [[latex]] (a [[Plant sap|sap]] like milk) from the green fruits, the leaves and the stem are rich in '''papain''', an [[enzyme]] that breaks down tough [[meat]] [[fiber]]s. Papain is a component in products (''meat tenderizers'') sold in [[shop]]s and that is used to make meat softer before cooking it. 
 
 Papaya seeds have a peppery [[taste]] and are a great substitute for black peppercorns.
