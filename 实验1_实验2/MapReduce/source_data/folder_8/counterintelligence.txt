 '''Counterintelligence''' is an activity to protect a [[state]] against [[spy|spies]] and other activities of a foreign [[intelligence service]]. < ref > Clark R.M. and Mitchell W.L. 2018. ''Deception: counterdeception and counterintelligence''. CQ Press. < /ref > 
 
 It includes  " protecting an agency's intelligence program against an opposition's intelligence service " . < ref > {{Cite book|title=Thwarting enemies at home and abroad: how to be a counterintelligence officer |last=Johnson, William |publisher=Georgetown University Press |year=2009|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=2}} < /ref >  It refers to information gathered and steps taken to counter [[espionage]]. Other intelligence activities are taken to prevent [[sabotage]], or [[assassination]]s by foreign powers, organizations or persons. Activities are taken against international [[terrorist]] groups and personnel. Work is done on physical, document or communications security programs. < ref > Executive Order 12333. (1981, December 4). United States Intelligence Activities, Section 3.4(a). EO provisions found in 46 FR 59941, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p.1 < /ref > < ref > Simandan D. 2018.

 Often counterintelligence at home is done by a different department from gathering intelligence abroad. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], there is a distinction between the [[Security Service]] (MI5) and the [[Special Branch]] of the Metropolitan Police. [[Arrest]]s and [[interrogation]] is done by Special Branch. Gathering intelligence abroad is done by [[MI6]], the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]. 
 
 In theory, the USA has a similar division between foreign activities and homeland activities. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) is a domestic security service. The [[CIA]] has no law enforcement function and does overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. In practice, the set-up is much more complex, and ever-changing. For one thing, the career of [[James Angleton]] and also the [[Watergate scandal]] shows how the CIA has been involved in mainland USA. The addition of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was a recognition that the United States was itself a potential target of attack by its various enemies. 
 
 [[Russia]] may have been the first country to set up an official counterintelligence organisation: the [[Okhrana]] was set up in 1880. Its title 'Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order'. sounds very modern. There was an even earlier Russian security department called the 'Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace'. It was founded in 1866. < ref > Hingley, Ronald 1970. ''The Russian secret police: Muscovite, Imperial Russian, and Soviet political security operations''. New York: Dorset. < /ref > < ref > Daly, Jonathan  1998. ''Autocracy under siege: security police and opposition in Russia, 1866â€“1905''. Northern Illinois University Press. ISBN 978-0-87580-243-5 < /ref >  It would be fair to say that these Russian organisations were not directed towards foreign intelligence services, but against internal threats to public order. They were part of the MVD (Ministry of the Interior).
