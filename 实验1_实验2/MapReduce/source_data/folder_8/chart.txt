 A '''chart''' or '''graph''' is an image which summarizes [[Information|data]] and presents it in an easy to understand way. Charts are often used to make it easier to understand the relationships of different aspects of the data. It is easier to read a chart than the raw data. 
 
 == Types of charts == 
 * A [[bar chart]] uses bars to show values for different categories. 
 * A [[pie chart]] shows [[percentage]] values as a slice of a [[pie]]. 
 * A [[flow chart]] shows the separate steps of a process.
