 '''Zupaysaurus''' was a [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[South America]] 213 [[million]] years ago, during the [[Upper Triassic]] period. It was about 5 meters (15 feet) long. A dinosaur very similar to it, ''[[Dracovenator]]'', lived in [[South Africa]] at the same time.  
 
 During the Triassic period, all the continents were connected to form the supercontinent of [[Pangaea]], and animals could migrate freely between them. Zupaysaurus was a carnivore.
