 The word  " '''felsic''' "  is a term used in [[geology]] to refer to [[silicate]] [[minerals]], [[magma]], and [[igneous rock]]s which are enriched in the lighter elements such as [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], [[aluminium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]].  
 
 They are usually light in colour and have [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] less than 3. The most common felsic rock is [[granite]], but others include [[quartz]], [[muscovite]], [[orthoclase]], and the sodium-rich [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]s. In terms of chemistry, felsic rocks are on the other side of the rock spectrum from the [[mafic]] rocks. 
 
 ==Classification of felsic rocks== 
 In order for a rock to be classified as felsic, it generally needs to contain more than 75% felsic minerals; namely quartz, orthoclase and plagioclase. Rocks with greater than 90% felsic minerals can also be called ''leucocratic'', meaning 'light-coloured'. 
 
 The rock texture thus determines the basic name of a felsic rock.
