A '''boycott''' is a [[protest]] where the protesters do not buy a [[product (consumer goods)|product]] or give money to a [[company]]. Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company. 
 
 The word was made during the ''Irish Land War'''. It comes from the name of Captain [[Charles Boycott]]. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a [[landlord]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Ireland]]. In 1880, the [[tenant]]s (those who [[Renting|rented]]) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming [[violence|violent]], everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the [[harvest]], no one worked in his [[stable]]s or his house. Local businessmen no longer traded with him, the [[postman]] no longer delivered his post.  
 
 To get his harvest done, he had to hire 50 people from other counties, the counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]. They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen. Of course, this cost far more than what the harvest was worth.
