 '''''Barbaridactylus''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[nyctosauridae|nyctosaurid]] [[pterosaur]] from [[Late Cretaceous|Maastrichtian]]/[[Paleocene|Danian]]-aged rocks from the Ouled Abdoun Basin in [[Morocco]]. It was one of six new Maastriichtian/Danian-aged [[pterosaur]]s described in 2018. < ref name=Longrichetalpterosaurs > {{cite journal |author1=Nicholas R. Longrich |author2=David M.

 ==Description== 
 ''Barbaridactylus'' was probably a slender [[pterosaur]]. Its arm and wing bones were averagely sized for a pterosaur of its time. 
 
 ==Discovery and naming== 
 ''Barbaridactylus'' was described based from two specimens. 
 
 The first specimen consisted of a partial [[jaw]], a single neck [[vertebra]], part of the [[arm]] and [[wing]] [[bone]]s and the left [[femur|thigh bone]]. 
 
 The second specimen (catalogued as '''USM93000''') consists of a well preserved skeleton. 
 
 ==Paleoecology== 
 ''Barbaridactylus'' was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in [[Morocco]]. It coexisted with the pterosaurs ''[[Alcione elainus|Alcione]]'', ''[[Simurghia]]'', ''[[Tethydraco]]'' and ''[[Phospatodraco]]'' and the [[dinosaur]] ''[[Chenanisaurus]]''.
