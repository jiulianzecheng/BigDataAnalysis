Earphones are lighter and more portable than headphones. They let people listen to music on a [[walkman]], [[MP3 player]], [[mobile phone]] or [[computer]].  
 
 Earphones that are worn inside the ear canal are called '''In-ear headphones''' or '''In-ear monitors'''. They typically have better sound quality. 
 
 Earphones often use a [[Phone connector|small plug]] for connection.
