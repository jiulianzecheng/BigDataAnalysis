 '''''Stegosaurus''''' (meaning  " roof-lizard " ) was a type of [[herbivore|plant-eating]] [[dinosaur]] which lived in what is now western [[North America]]. 
 
 ''Stegosaurus'' lived in the [[Upper Jurassic]] period around 155 to 145 million years ago. It is one of the most easily recognized dinosaurs, with its distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates on its back, and the long spikes on its tail. The armor was necessary as it lived with such meat-eaters as ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''. 
 
 ==Discovery and species== 
 ''Stegosaurus'' was originally named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1877, < ref > {{cite journal|author=Marsh OC|year=1877|title=A new order of extinct Reptilia (Stegosauria) from the Jurassic of the Rocky Mountains|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=14|pages=513–514|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-14.84.513|bibcode=1877AmJS...14..513M|s2cid=130078453|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1450038}} < /ref >  from fossils found near [[Morrison]], [[Colorado]]. These first bones became the first [[species]] of Stegosaur named: ''Stegosaurus armatus''. 
 
 Several different ''Stegosaurus'' species have been found. 
 * '''''Stegosaurus armatus''''': This was the first type of ''Stegosaurus'' to be found. Over thirty different skeletons have been discovered by scientists. This type had four tail spikes and small plates. At 9 & nbsp;meters (30 & nbsp;ft), it was the longest species of ''Stegosaurus''. 
 * '''''Stegosaurus stenops''''': Named by Marsh in 1887, < ref name = " Marsh87 " > {{cite journal|author=Marsh OC|year=1887|title=Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs, part IX. The skull and dermal armour of ''Stegosaurus''|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=34|pages=413–417}} < /ref >  it was discovered near [[Cañon City, Colorado]], in 1886. This is the best known species of ''Stegosaurus'', mainly because its fossils make at least one complete skeleton. It had large, broad plates and four tail spikes. ''S. stenops'' is known from at least 50 partial skeletons of both adults and juveniles, one complete skull and four partial skulls. It was shorter than ''S. armatus'', at 7 & nbsp;m (23 & nbsp;ft). 
 * '''''Stegosaurus longispinus''''': This type of Stegosaur is known from one incomplete skeleton. ''S. longispinus'' had a set of very long tail spines. Like ''S. stenops'', it grew to 7 & nbsp;m (23 & nbsp;ft) in length. 
 * '''''S. ungulatus''''': Named by Marsh in 1879 from remains recovered at [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]], < ref > {{cite journal|author=Marsh OC|year=1879|title=Notice of new Jurassic reptiles|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=18|pages=501–505|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-18.108.501|bibcode=1879AmJS...18..501M|s2cid=131001110|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1450052}} < /ref >  it is only known from a few backbones and armor plates. It is probably the same as ''S. armatus''. 
 * '''''S. sulcatus''''': This is another partial skeleton. It is probably the same as ''S. armatus''. 
 * '''''S. duplex''''': This animal is probably the same as ''S. armatus''. It was also named by Marsh in 1887,. < ref name= " Marsh87 " / >  Its fossils were found in 1879 by Edward Ashley at [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]]. 
 * ?'''''S. seeleyanus''''': Probably the same as ''S. armatus''. 
 * ?'''''S. (Diracodon) laticeps''''': Named by Marsh in 1881 from some jawbone fragments. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Marsh OC|year=1881|title=Principal characters of American Jurassic dinosaurs, part V|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=3|issue=21|pages=417–423|doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-21.125.417|bibcode=1881AmJS...21..417M|s2cid=219234316}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Paleobiology== 
 ''Stegosaurus'' was the largest [[stegosauria|stegosaur]], reaching up to 12 & nbsp;m (39.4 & nbsp;ft) in length and weighing up to 5,000 & nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (5.5 & nbsp;[[short ton]]s). However, 7 to 9 & nbsp;m was a more usual length. 
 
 ===Skull=== 
 The [[skull]] of ''Stegosaurus'' was long and narrow. Because of its short front legs, its head was close to the ground, probably no higher than 1 & nbsp;m (3.3 & nbsp;ft). It ate low-growing plants because of this. It had no front teeth, but it did have a horn-covered beak. Stegosaurian chewing teeth were small and triangular and did little grinding as they lacked wear surfaces. < ref name =  " FasWeis04 " > {{cite book|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs|year=2005|chapter=Stegosauria:Hot Plates|editor=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|author=Fastovsky DE, Weishampel DB|pages=107–130|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521811724|edition=2nd}} < /ref > 
 
 Unlike most dinosaurs, it did not have a lacuna (hole) in its skull between the nose and eye. < ref name = " Lambert93 " > {{cite book|title=The Ultimate Dinosaur Book|year=1993|author=Lambert D|pages=110–129|publisher=Dorling Kindersley, New York|isbn=156458304X}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Nervous system=== 
 It has often been said that the ''Stegosaurus'' brain was the size of a [[walnut]]. Actually, it had a brain several times the size of a walnut. The bundle of nerves near the base of the tail that controlled reflexes in the back of the body was larger than the brain and is sometimes said to be a  " second brain " . These issues are discussed in [[Dinosaur brains and intelligence#Stegosaurus|Dinosaur brains and intelligence]]. 
 
 ===Posture=== 
 ''Stegosaurus'' had very short forelimbs in relation to its hind legs. The back legs each had three short toes, while the front legs had five toes. All four limbs were supported by pads behind the toes. < ref name= " Lambert93 " / > 
 
 ==Classification== 
 ''Stegosaurus'' was a member of the '''[[Thyreophora]]''', or [[armor]]ed dinosaurs, a family of dinosaurs which includes the '''[[Ankylosauria|ankylosaurs]]'''. 
 
 ==Popular culture== 
 ''Stegosaurus'' has been declared the [[List of U.S. state dinosaurs|State Dinosaur]] of [[Colorado]]. It has also appeared in many movies and TV shows.
