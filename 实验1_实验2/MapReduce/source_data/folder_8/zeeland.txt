 '''Zeeland''' (also called '''Zealand''') is a [[province]] in [[Netherlands]]. It is on the south-western part of the country. About 385,000 people are living in Zeeland (2021). 
 
 == Geography == 
 Zeeland is a good example of land partly reclaimed from water or marshes. It is a large [[river delta]] at the mouth of several major rivers.  
 
 Most of the province lies below [[sea level]] and was [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] from the sea. What was a [[mud]]dy landscape, [[flood]]ing at high tide and reappearing at low tide, became a series of small man-made hills that stayed dry. The people of the province connected the hills by making [[levee|dikes]]. This made a chain of dry land which grew bigger, and gave the province its present shape.  
 
 The [[North Sea flood of 1953]] swamped vast amounts of land. Building the protective [[Delta Works]] also changed the face of the province. [[Dam]]s, tunnels and bridges are a vital part of the province's road system. The final touch to this process came in 2003 when the [[Western Scheldt Tunnel]] was opened. It was the first solid connection between both banks of the [[Western Scheldt]] and ended the era of water separating the islands and [[peninsula]]s of Zeeland.
