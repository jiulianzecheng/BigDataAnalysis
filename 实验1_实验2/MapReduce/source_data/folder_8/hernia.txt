A '''hernia''' is a medical condition. If an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or its [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] moves from its normal position through to another position, this is called a hernia. 
 
 There are various types of hernia. Most hernias happen in the [[abdomen]]. Hernias sometimes give pain and/or a lump that can be felt or seen. The cause can be [[hereditary disease|hereditary]] or it can be from lifting objects {{ndash}} especially heavy ones â€“ in a wrong way. There are other things that can give hernias as well. Hernias especially if small or mild can be treated with medicine but will not go away although it will relieve symptoms. 
 
 ==  Types of hernia == 
 
 * Inguinal Hernia - Inguinal hernia occurs when a small portion of the [[intestine]] exits the inguinal canal and enters the femoral joint. Flatulence is a disorder of the esophagus, which usually involves the lining of the abdomen. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Hernia: Types, Treatments, Symptoms, Causes  &  Prevention|url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15757-hernia|access-date=2021-11-22|website=Cleveland Clinic}} < /ref > 
 * Femoral Hernia - This type of hernia develops when fatty tissue or part of the intestines sticks out of the groin at the top of the inner part of the thigh. It is comparatively less common than inguinal hernia and mainly affects women. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-11-01|title=Hernia Symptoms in Women {{!}} Hernia in Women|url=https://sahyadrihospital.com/blog/hernia-symptoms-in-women-and-men/|access-date=2021-11-22|website=Sahyadri Hospital|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 * Umbilical Hernia - When a [[muscle]] or tissue hole opens near the [[umbilical cord]], it starts coming out of the internal part of our body, it is called umbilical hernia. In umbilical hernia, there is swelling in the area around the navel. 
 
 == Hernia treatments == 
 
 ===Laparoscopic procedures for hernia repair=== 
 
 Laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, procedures use several small incisions to access the hernia no more than 1 centimeter in length. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide to provide space for the surgeon to work, and the hernia is repaired with a small, flexible instrument called a laparoscope. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Fisher|first=Martin|title=Hernia Treatment Options {{!}} Comprehensive Hernia Center|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hernia_center/repair_recovery/treatment_options.html|access-date=2021-12-06|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Open surgery=== 
 
 This is an open-cut surgery that is performed in the area of the hernia. In this procedure, the protruding tissues are set back, and the weak muscles are stitched up neatly. Also, these are times when a type of mesh will be inserted over the area to provide additional support. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Hernia - Causes, Symptoms, Treatments {{!}} ONP Hospital {{!}} ONP Hospital|url=https://onphospitals.com/laparoscopy/hernia/|access-date=2021-12-06|website=onphospitals.com}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Reconstructive surgery for hernia repair=== 
 
 Abdominal wall reconstruction repairs defects in the abdominal walls while reducing abdominal tension and providing structural support. This may require a component separation so that the muscular sides of the hernia gap can be brought together again.
