 A '''supercentenarian''' is someone who has lived to the [[aging|age]] of 110 [[year]]s or more, something achieved by only one in a thousand [[centenarian]]s. A very small number of supercentenarians have lived to be 115. Early uses of the word meant a person well over 100, but now it is just known as people who are 110 or older. 
 
 [[Thomas Johhanes Peters]] (1745 - 1857) is the first undisputed supercentenarian case in history.
