A '''duchy''' is a territory or domain ruled by a [[duke]] or [[duchess]].  Historically, some duchies in [[Continental Europe]] were [[sovereignty|sovereign]], while others (especially in [[France]] and [[Britain]]) were subordinate districts of a [[kingdom]].  
 
 Traditionally, a ''grand duchy'', such as [[Luxembourg]], was generally [[independence|independent]] and sovereign. Sovereign duchies were common in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[German language|German]]-speaking areas. In [[France]], a number of duchies existed in the medieval period. Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] still holds the medieval French title of ''Duke of Normandy''; the only lands still attached to the Duchy of Normandy are the [[Channel Islands]].  
 
 In medieval [[England]], the territories of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cornwall]] were made duchies, with certain powers given to their Dukes.  
 
 Today, duchies aren't very common in Europe, primarily because a lot of former [[Monarchy|monarchies]] such as France and [[Russia]] had their [[Revolution|revolutions]]. However, duchies will always be remembered - in our [[Textbook|history textbooks]].
