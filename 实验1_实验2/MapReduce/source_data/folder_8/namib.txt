 The '''Namib''', also known as '''Namibe''' or '''Namibië desert''' is a coastal [[desert]] in [[southern Africa]]. According to the broadest definition, the Namib stretches for more than {{convert|2000|km}} along the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[South Africa]]. 
 
 
 Stretching for 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers), it is one of the oldest deserts on the planet – at least 55 million years. Although a desert, the land is inhabited by a wide range of plants and animals, including ‘desert’ elephants that can go days without water.
