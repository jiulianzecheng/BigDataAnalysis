 A '''headstone''', '''gravestone''' or '''tombstone''' is a marker, normally made from [[stone]], that is used to identify a person who is buried beneath it (in the [[grave]]). 
 
 These markers can be plain or beautifully carved with writing ([[epitaph]] or inscriptions) and pictures, but at times some gravestones can be unmarked, leaving a dead person unidentifiable.
