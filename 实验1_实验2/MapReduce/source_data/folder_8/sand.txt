 '''Sand''' is a [[mixture]] of very small pieces of different rocks or [[minerals]]. It is the same minerals from which those pieces are broken, such as [[granite]] and [[feldspar]]. Sand is gritty to touch. It is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. Sand is also formed various rocks by weathering and [[erosion]]. Erosion breaks large boulders into smaller rocks. They get smaller and smaller until they reach the beach or a low-lying area as sand. 
 
 Sand grains are between the size of [[gravel|gravel grains]] (which is from 2 [[Millimeter|mm]] to 64 & nbsp;mm) and the size of [[silt]] (which is around 0.0625 & nbsp;mm to 0.004 & nbsp;mm). Most sand is found on [[beach]]es, and in [[desert]]s. The most common sands are made of [[silica]] (silicon dioxide, or SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ). [[Calcium carbonate]] is the second more common. 
 
 [[Dune|Sand dunes]] are made when [[wind]] or a [[river]] pulls sand into a mountain-like shape. They can be found in deserts, but sometimes high up on beaches too. 
 
 Sand is crucial in the process of mixing [[concrete]]. It can also be used to make [[sand castle]]s. Sand is sometimes in households for [[aesthetic]] purposes.
