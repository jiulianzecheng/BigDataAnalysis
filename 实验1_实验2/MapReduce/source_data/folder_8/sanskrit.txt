 '''Sanskrit''' is an ancient [[Indo-European language]]. It is a sacred language of [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] and is the origin of most [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. Today, about 14,000 people in [[India]] use it as their daily language mostly for religious purposes. < ref name= " Census "  / >  It is one of the 22 official languages of India. Most languages in [[Pakistan]], [[North India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]] are derived from Sanskrit. The [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South India]] are not derived from Sanskrit but got many [[Loanword|loanwords]] from it. The two primary languages of Pakistan and India, [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], are derived mainly from Sanskrit. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sanskrit-is-second-official-language-in-Uttarakhand/Article1-499467.aspx |title=Sanskrit is second official language in Uttarakhand – The Hindustan Times |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |archive-date=2011-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132120/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sanskrit-is-second-official-language-in-Uttarakhand/Article1-499467.aspx |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Sanskrit is a standardized [[dialect]] of [[Indo-Aryan languages#Old Indo-Aryan|Old Indo-Aryan]] and has a linguistic ancestry that can be traced back to [[Proto-Indo-European]]. The Indo-European Aryan migration theory proposes that the Indo-Europeans migrated from the [[Central Asia]]n steppes into [[South Asia]] during the early 2nd millennium BC and brought the Indo-European language Sanskrit with them. < ref > Witzel, Michael 2005. Indocentrism. In Bryant, Edwin  &  Patton, Laurie L. ''The Indo-Aryan controversy: evidence and inference in Indian history''. London: Routledge. < /ref >  The main script used to write Sanskrit is [[Devanagari|Devanāgarī]], but it can be written in the scripts of various other Indian languages and is sometimes written in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]]. Historically, it was written in the ancient and holy Brāhmī script. 
 
 William Jones, working as a judge in India in the 18th century, studied Sanskrit and recognised its similarities to [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and other [[Europe]]an languages. That led to the Indo-European languages being recognised as a group of related languages stretching from [[Europe]] to [[India]].
