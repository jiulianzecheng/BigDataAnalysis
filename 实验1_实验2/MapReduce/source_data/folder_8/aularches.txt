 '''''Aularches miliaris''''' is a [[grasshopper]] found in [[South Asia|south]] and [[southeast Asia]]. It is protected by powerful chemical defences, and its [[warning colour]] signals its foul taste. 
 
 When it is disturbed or grabbed, it makes a sharp rasping noise with its [[thorax|thoracic]] [[segmentation|segments]]. Then, if its thorax is pinched, it gives off a [[toxic]] [[foam]]. < ref name=hing > {{cite journal|author=Hingston R.W.G. | year=1927|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.1927.tb00060.x|title=The liquid-squirting habit of oriental grasshoppers| journal=Transactions of the Entomological Society of London|volume=75|pages=65–69}} 
 < /ref > < ref name=osfo > (2013) [http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/editTaxon/Distribution/ShowDistribution.aspx?TaxonNameID=39540 ''Aularches miliaris miliaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758)] from Orthoptera Species File (OSF) Online. Accessed on 2013-01-29. < /ref >  It squirts a clear [[viscosity|viscous]] [[mucus]] with unpleasant smell and a bitter taste, faintly [[alkaline]], with many [[bubble]]s. This foam comes out as a strong jet from openings in the thorax, and more gently from other openings in the body (ten in total). The foam heaps up around the insect and partly covers it. < ref name=hing/ > 
 
 == Colouring and behaviour == 
 The head and [[thorax]] are dark green with a canary-yellow band on the side.  The leathery front wings are green with many yellow spots; the legs are blue, with a yellow serrated pattern on the hind legs.  The [[abdomen]] is black with bright red bands. < ref name=hing/ >   
 
 Like most [[wikt:noxious|noxious]] animals, it is very visible and slow-moving on [[vegetation]]. < ref name=hing/ >  It pays to advertise, and it does not need to hide.
