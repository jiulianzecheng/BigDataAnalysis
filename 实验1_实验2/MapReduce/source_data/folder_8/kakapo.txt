 The '''Kakapo''' (''Strigops habroptilus'') is the only [[parrot]] which cannot [[fly]]. It lives in [[grass]]land, [[scrub]]land and [[coast]]al regions of [[New Zealand]], but is now so rare they can only be seen on protected offshore islands. Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the [[Maori language]]. 
 
 Kakapos are most active at night ([[nocturnal]]) and like to be alone. To keep other kakapos out of their [[territory]], they make a 'skraaarking' [[sound]]. The Kakapo can live for about 60 years. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Kakapo are [[herbivore]]s. They eat [[root]]s, [[seed]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]], small [[Pine#Cones|pine cones]], [[fruit]], and [[flower]]s. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Unlike other parrots, male kakapos gather together to [[competition|compete]] with the other males and call females with a deep booming sound. There are 2 to 3 [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in each set of eggs laid. The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a [[tree]]. The female [[incubation|incubates]] the eggs for 10 weeks. She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find [[food]]. 
 
 == Conservation == 
 Kakapo had almost no natural [[predator|animals that wanted to eat it]] on the [[island]]s of New Zealand where they live and lose the ability to fly. At one time, there were many kakapos. Now only about 150 kakapos still live in New Zealand. It is a [[Endangered species|critically endangered species]]. The decrease in the number of kakapo is mostly from [[predator]]y [[animal]]s (for example, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[stoat]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[rat]]s) that [[settler]]s brought with them to New Zealand. The kakapo was also eaten by [[MƒÅori people|Maori]] and [[Europe]] settlers. 
 
 Before [[introduced species|humans brought mammals]] like cats and stoats, the main predator of the kakapo was flying [[birds of prey]]. Birds of prey find animals to eat by looking for them from above. The kakapo would stand very still, so the bird of prey would not find it. But cats and stoats can find animals to eat by smelling them. Standing still did not help the kakapo escape from cats and stoats. < ref name=AZ > {{cite web|url=https://a-z-animals.com/animals/kakapo/|accessdate=August 30, 2021|publisher=A-Z Animals|title=Kakapo}} < /ref > 
 
 At one point, the kakapo was almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s but were not very successful until the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of January 2009, surviving Kakapos have been kept on two predator-free islands, [[Codfish Island|Codfish (Whenua Hou)]] and [[Anchor Island|Anchor]] islands, where they are closely monitored. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.kakaporecovery.org.nz/index.php?option=com_content & view=category & layout=blog & id=58 & Itemid=170|title=Kakapo Habitat|publisher=Kakapo Recovery Programme|accessdate=2009-01-05}} < /ref >  Two large Fiordland islands, [[Resolution Island, New Zealand|Resolution]] and [[Secretary Island|Secretary]], have been prepared as self-sustaining [[ecosystem]]s for the Kakapo. 
 
 The conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being ''Two in the Bush'', made by [[Gerald Durrell]] for the [[BBC]] in 1962. < ref name= " GeraldDurrellBBC " > {{Cite web | url = http://www.durrellwildlife.org/index.cfm?a=51 | title = GERALD DURRELL'S CAREER | publisher = durrellwildlife.org | accessdate = August 8, 2007 | archive-date = July 24, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070724184732/http://www.durrellwildlife.org/index.cfm?a=51 | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  A feature-length documentary, < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://elwin.co.nz/prjkakapo.html |title=The Unnatural History of the Kakapo |access-date=2010-10-05 |archive-date=2013-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208044318/http://www.elwin.co.nz/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. 
 
 Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by [[NHNZ]], are ''Kakapo - Night Parrot'' (1982) and ''To Save the Kakapo'' (1997). The [[BBC]]'s Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with Sir [[David Attenborough]] in ''[[The Life of Birds]]''. It was also one of the endangered animals that [[Douglas Adams]] and [[Mark Carwardine]] set out to find for the radio series and book ''[[Last Chance to See]]''. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which [[Stephen Fry]] and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/38869/fry-making-kakapo-doco|title=Fry making kakapo doco|last=McNeilly |first=Hamish |date=10 January 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=2009-01-09}} < /ref > < ref name=LCTSee-2009 > BBC 2: {{cite episode|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mg3qk |title =Last Chance to See|network=BBC |series=1| station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=2009-10-04}} < /ref >
