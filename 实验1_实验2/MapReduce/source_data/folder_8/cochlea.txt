 A core component of the cochlea is the [[Organ of Corti]], the sensory organ of [[hearing]], which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea. 
 
 The name is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κοχλίας ''kokhlias'' ( " snail, screw " ), from κόχλος ''kokhlos'' ( " spiral shell " ). < ref > [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=cochlea & searchmode=none etymology of  " cochlea " ] < /ref >  This is in reference to its coiled shape: the cochlea is coiled in most mammals, [[monotreme]]s being the exceptions.
