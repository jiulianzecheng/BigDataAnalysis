 '''Hominina''' is a [[tribe (biology)|sub-tribe]] of the [[Hominidae|hominid]] [[primate]]s. It is used by some [[anthropologist]]s to include the upright [[Bipedalism|biped]] [[ape]]s, including the genus ''[[Homo]]''. 
 
 If an anthropologist wants to includes [[chimpanzee]]s in the tribe [[Hominini]], then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put [[Australopithecine]]s and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is: 
 * Family: [[Hominidae]] 
 * Subfamily: [[Homininae]] 
 * Tribe: [[Hominini]] 
 * Subtribe: Hominina  
 
 If used, the group includes ''[[Sahelanthropus]]'' six to eight million years ago.

 Even today, the genus ''Homo'' has not been properly defined. < ref name= " Schwartz 2015 " > {{cite journal |title=Defining the genus ''Homo'' |journal=Science |date=28 August 2015 |last1=Schwartz |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2= Tattersall |first2=Ian |volume=349 |issue=6251 |pages=931–932 |doi=10.1126/science.aac6182 |pmid=26315422 |bibcode=2015Sci...349..931S |s2cid=206639783 |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/931.summary |accessdate=2015-11-02}} < /ref > < ref name= " Homo definition 2015 " > {{cite news |last=Lents |first=Nathan |url=https://www.thewildernist.org/2015/10/homo-nadeli-problems-with-homo-genus/ |title=''Homo naledi'' and the Problems with the ''Homo'' Genus |work=The Wildernist |date=4 October 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-02 |archive-date=2015-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118084131/https://www.thewildernist.org/2015/10/homo-nadeli-problems-with-homo-genus/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |title=The human genus |journal=Science |date=2 April 1999 |last1=Wood |first1=B. |last2=Collard |first2=M. |volume=284 |issue=5411 |pages=65–71 |pmid=10102822 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10102822 |accessdate=2015-11-03 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5411.65|bibcode=1999Sci...284...65. }} < /ref > 
 
 Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, [[Carl Linnaeus]] did not even bother to define ''Homo'' when he first created it for humans in the 18th century. The discovery of [[Neanderthals]] brought the first addition.

 The genus ''Homo'' was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human. 
 
 Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] times.

 Classifying a fossil as ''Homo'' means evidence of: 
 #competent [[Bipedalism#Evolution of human bipedalism|human bipedalism]] in ''Homo habilis'' inherited from the earlier ''[[Australopithecus]]'' of more than four million years ago, (see [[Laetoli]]); 
 # [[Oldowan|human tool culture]] having begun by 2.5 million years ago.
