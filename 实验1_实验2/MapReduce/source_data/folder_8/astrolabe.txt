 The '''astrolabe''' is a tool using the positions of the [[star]]s or [[sun]].  It was formerly used in [[navigation]] to help explorers and sailors figure out where they were.  They found their distance north and south of the [[equator]] by measuring the distance of the sun and stars above the [[horizon]].  [[Astronomy|Astronomers]] used other kinds of astrolabes, usually larger ones. 
 
 An early astrolabe was made in the Hellenistic world in 150 BC. It is often attributed to [[Hipparchus]]. The astrolabe was a marriage of the [[planisphere]] (a star chart analog computing instrument) and [[dioptra]] (a tool to measure [[angle]]s). It was a [[calculator]] able to work out many kinds of problems in [[astronomy]]. Theon of Alexandria wrote a complex book on the astrolabe. Lewis says that [[Ptolemy]] used an astrolabe to make the astronomical [[observation]]s recorded in the ''Tetrabiblos''. < ref > Lewis M.J.T. 2001. ''Surveying instruments of Greece and Rome''.

" It is generally accepted that Greek astrologers, in either the first or second centuries BC, invented the ''astrolabe'', an instrument that measures the altitude of stars and planets above the horizon. Some historians attribute its invention to [[Hipparchus]] " < /ref >
