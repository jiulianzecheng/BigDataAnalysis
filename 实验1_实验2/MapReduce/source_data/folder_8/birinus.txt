 Birinus may have been a [[Lombardy|Lombard]] by birth. < ref name=Farmer52 > David Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Fifth Edition Revised (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 52 < /ref >  He was sent by [[Pope Honorius I]] to help convert [[pagans]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]]. < ref name=Bede153 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 153 < /ref >  The [[pope]] first sent him to [[Genoa]]. There  
 Archbishop Asterius of [[Milan]] [[Consecration|consecrated]] Birinus as a [[bishop]]. < ref name=Farmer52/ >  Birinus arrived in southern Britain {{circa|634}}. < ref name=Counsell100 > Michael Counsell, ''Every Pilgrim's Guide to England's Holy Places'' (Norwich: Canterbury Press, 2003), p. 100 < /ref >  He had planned to go to the midlands of England to preach there. But when he found the [[Gewisse]] in Wessex were completely pagan, he decided to stay with them. < ref name=Farmer52/ >  He began to convert the Gewisse ([[West Saxons]]) to [[Christianity]]. In 635 King [[Cynegils of Wessex]] was [[baptized]] by Birinus and King [[Oswald of Northumbria]] agreed to be his [[Godfather]]. < ref name=Thorpe22 > Benjamin Thorpe, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle according to the Several Original Authorities: Translation'' (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1861), p. 22 < /ref >  This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. < ref name=Ashley304 > Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New york: Carroll  &  Graf, 1999), p. 304 < /ref >  He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. < ref name=Bede153/ >   
 In {{circa|647–48}} Birinus founded a church at [[Winchester]] which later became [[Winchester Cathedral]]. < ref name=Counsell100/ >  Birinus died in 650. < ref name=Farmer52/ >  He was buried at Dorchester. < ref > John Vince, ''Discovering Saints in Britain'' (), p. 11 < /ref >   
 
 == Relics of St. Birinus == 
 
 After 660 there were no more West Saxon Bishops at Dorchester. Along with part of [[Berkshire]] it was taken over by [[Mercia]]. < ref name=Farmer53 > David Farmer, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Fifth Edition Revised (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 53 < /ref >  The new see for Wessex was now at [[Winchester]]. Some time around 690–700 Bishop Hedda of Winchester had the [[relic]]s (bones) of St. Birinus moved from Dorchester to Winchester. < ref name=Farmer53/ >  Up to this time Bishop Birinus had been considered a minor [[saint]]. < ref name=Vincent244 > Nicholas Vincent, ''Peter Des Roches: An Alien in English Politics, 1205-1238'' (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 244 < /ref >  In 1223 [[monk]]s of Dorchester abbey located the tomb of a former Bishop. The body was dressed in the garments and tunic of a bishop so they believed it was St. Birinus. < ref name=Vincent244/ >  At the time of the discovery miracles were claimed. One claim was that a [[:wikt:dumb|dumb]] child could suddenly speak [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. < ref name=Vincent244/ >  The monks sent their findings to [[Rome]]. The pope wrote to Stephen Langton, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] asking him to [[:wikt:manage|manage]] the translation.{{efn|In [[Christianity]] translation is the removal of holy objects from one place to another. In this case it was the saint's body. It was usually done by a bishop or abbot to a special place within the church. A [[:en:wikt:feast day|feast day]], the day the saint's body or relics were moved, is observed from then on. < ref > Eric Waldram Kemp, ''Canonization and Authority in the Western Church'' (London : Oxford University Press, 1948), p. 46 < /ref > }} But a problem caused the ceremony to be delayed. Archbishop Langton discovered the body had already been moved to Winchester {{circa|700}}. < ref name=Vincent244/ >  Both Dorchester and Winchester claimed to have the relics of Bishop Birinus. < ref name=Vincent244/ >  For that reason two feast days were [[:wikt:observed|observed]] for him, December 3rd and 4th. < ref name=Farmer53/ >  The [[Catholic Church]] recognizes December 3rd. A [[shrine]] was created for him in the [[14th century]]. It was later destroyed, but it has been rebuilt since. < ref name=Farmer53/ >
