 '''Pines''' are a large and important [[genus]] of [[conifer]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Pinaceae]]. The Plant List of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] lists 126 species of pines, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=pinus |title=The Plant List Version 1.1 |access-date=2018-02-24 |archive-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601230909/http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Pinus |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  plus a lot of [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]. < ref > A synonym in [[taxonomy]] is a scientific name of a taxon that (now) has a different scientific name < /ref > 
 
 Pines live in almost the entire [[Northern Hemisphere]]. In [[North America]], they live in the southern part of [[Arctic]] to [[Nicaragua]] and [[Hispaniola]]. In [[Europe]], they live in areas from [[Portugal]] and [[Scotland]] to [[Russia]]. In [[Asia]], they live in areas from [[Russia]] to [[Japan]] and the [[Philippines]]. They also live in the [[Himalayas]], some northern parts of [[Africa]], and north of Majorca (Mallorca) on the rugged mountains. 
 
 Pines are long-lived [[tree]]s (rarely large [[shrub]]s), typically reaching heights of 5–70 & nbsp;metres tall and ages of 100–1,000 years, some even more. The longest-lived is the Great Basin bristlecone pine, ''[[Pinus longaeva]]''. One individual of this species, named  " [[Methuselah]] " , is the world's oldest living tree at around 4,600 years old. This tree can be found in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[California]]. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Ryan M.  &  Richardson J.M. |title=The complete pine |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_bioscience_1999-12_49_12/page/1023 |journal=BioScience |year=1999|volume=49|issue=12|pages=1023–1024|doi=10.2307/1313736 |jstor=1313736 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Cones == 
 Pines usually have male and female [[Conifer cone|cones]] on the same tree ([[monoecious]]). The male cones are small, typically 1–5 & nbsp;cm long, and are only present for a short period, usually in spring. They fall as soon as they have shed their [[pollen]]. The female cones take 1.5–3 years (depending on species) to mature after [[pollination]], with actual fertilization delayed by one year. At maturity, the female cones are 3–60 & nbsp;cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. The seeds are mostly small and winged, and are wind-dispersed. Some have larger seeds that look like [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] and are dispersed by [[bird]]s.  
 
 At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds, but in some of the bird-dispersed species (e.g. [[whitebark pine]]), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed ( " serotinous " ) cones for many years until a forest fire triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. The [[resin]] on the cones holds the scales closed until it melts in the fire.
