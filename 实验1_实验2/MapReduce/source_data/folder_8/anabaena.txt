 Anabena is a genus that encompasses [[plankton]] species. They fall under a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/153576078|title=The cyanobacteria : molecular biology, genomics, and evolution|date=2008|publisher=Caister Academic Press|others=Antonia Herrero, Enrique Flores|isbn=978-1-904455-15-8|location=Norfolk, UK|oclc=153576078}} < /ref >  They have the ability to perform photosynthesis, as well as the ability to convert nitrogen in the air to ammonia, in water. They form mutually beneficial relationships, called symbiotic relationships with some plants. Anabena can make neurotoxins. It protects the plants from being eaten by wildlife. However, some species of Anabena have been used as a natural fertilizer in rice fields. 
 ==Genome== 
 A study in 1999 has found the complete genome of Anabena (all of the DNA material). It is 7.2 million base pairs long. Anabena species have been used in research which focused on nitrogen fixation, [[DNA repair]] and primitive vision pigments. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Schapiro|first1=Igor|last2=Ruhman|first2=Sanford|date=2014-05-01|title=Ultrafast photochemistry of Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin: Experiment and theory|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272813001709|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|series=Retinal Proteins|language=en|volume=1837|issue=5|pages=589â€“597|doi=10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.09.014|pmid=24099700 |issn=0005-2728}} < /ref >
