A '''composer''' is someone who writes (composes) [[music]]. Some composers work by writing music down on paper; this is called '[[musical notation|written notation]]'. [[Classical music]] writers work this way. Writers for [[TV]] and [[movie]] music also usually write this way, so that an [[orchestra]] or other players can read the music and play it. 
 
 Some [[musician]]s are very good at [[improvisation]]. This means that they think up (invent) the music as they play it. Some [[Church (building)|church]] [[pipe organ|organists]] are good at improvising. During a [[service of worship|service]] they may need to play some organ music to fill in the gaps while people are collecting [[money]] or taking [[communion (Christian)|communion]]. [[Jazz]] musicians are usually excellent at improvising. Improvisation is not written down, so each time it is different. 
 
 [[Pop music|Popular]] and [[rock and roll|rock]] or [[soul music]] writers are often not able to read and write music down. Many [[pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] composers compose their [[song]]s on a [[guitar]] or [[piano]]. [[Cole Porter]] and [[Irving Berlin]] usually composed at the [[piano]]. 
 
 Many songs are written by two or more people. It is common for two people to work together to write songs. Sometimes, one person writes the music and one writes the words (the [[lyrics]]). Some songs such as [[folk song]]s were composed many years ago and no one knows who wrote them.
