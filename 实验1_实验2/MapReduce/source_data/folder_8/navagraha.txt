The '''navagraha''' are nine bodies and gods that affect human life, according to [[Hinduism]]. The word is from nava, meaning nine, and graha, meaning planet. The nine parts of the navagraha are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the [[Lunar nodes|two nodes of the Moon]]. 
 
 The word ''planet'' was made for only to the five planets known by the naked eye and so, never had the [[Earth]]. The word was later generalized, during the [[Post-classical history|Middle Ages]], to have both the sun and the moon (sometimes referred to as  " lights " ), making a total of seven planets. The [[Seven days of the week#Hindu tradition|seven days of the week]] of the [[Hindu calendar]] also relate with the [[seven classical planets]] and day names of [[Europe]]. In most languages of india, most [[Hindu temples]] around the world have a specific place dedicated to the worship of the navagraha.
