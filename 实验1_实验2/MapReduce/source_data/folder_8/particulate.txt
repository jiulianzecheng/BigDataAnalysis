'''Particulates''' are very tiny pieces of a [[solid]] or [[liquid]] that are carried floating in a [[gas]].  When the tiny pieces are solid, it is called a [[smoke]].  When the tiny pieces are liquid, it is called an [[aerosol]]. Aerosols can be naturally found in [[clouds]] and [[geysers]]. There are also artificial aerosols such as [[haze]] and some [[air pollutants]]. Smokes can be found naturally in [[wildfires]] and [[volcanoes]]. Artificially, they can be found in [[cigarettes]], [[factories]] and [[power plants]]. Both of them can cause [[air pollution]] and [[climate change]]. It is the job of a [[air filter]] to remove them.
