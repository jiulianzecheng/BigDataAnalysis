 '''Nudibranchs''' are a widespread and successful group of [[Ocean|marine]] [[Gastropod]] [[molluscs]]. The name means 'naked [[gills]]'. They are [[Animal shell|shell]]ess and uncoiled Gastropods, famous for their brilliant colours. There are more than 3000 known [[species]]. 
 
 Nudibranchs are one of the groups which are informally known as '''[[sea slug]]s'''. This is a term which includes other Gastropod groups which look similar to nudibranchs. Sea slugs is an informal term; it is not a [[monophyletic]] group.  
 
 ==Biology == 
 The body forms of nudibranchs vary greatly. They are ''opisthobranchs'', a [[clade]] which shed their shells after the [[larva]]l stage.  
 
 Unlike most other gastropods they are ''[[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetrical]]''. They have undergone secondary de[[torsion]]. < ref > Uncoiling of the typical gastropod body shape, see garden [[snail]]. < /ref >  Most species have [[Toxin|venomous]] [[appendage]]s on their sides. These are used to deter [[predator]]s. Many also have a simple gut and a mouth with a [[radula]]. 
 
 Unusually for molluscs, they lack a [[mantle cavity]]. Nudibranchs are [[hermaphrodite]], and thus have a set of reproductive organs for both sexes, but they rarely fertilize themselves. 
 
 Most nudibranchs are [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. Some feed on [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, others on [[polyp]]s, others on [[bryozoa]]ns, and some eat other sea slugs, or, on some occasions, members of their own species. Other groups feed on [[tunicate]]s, [[barnacle]]s, or [[sea anemone|anemone]]s. 
 
 The surface dwelling nudibranch, ''Glaucus atlanticus'' is a specialist predator of [[jellyfish]], such as the [[Portuguese Man o' War]]. This predatory mollusc sucks air into its stomach to keep it afloat and using its muscular foot it clings to the surface film. If it finds a small victim ''Glaucus'' simply envelops it with its large mouth, but if the prey is a larger [[siphonophore]] the mollusc nibbles off its fishing tentacles, the ones carrying the most potent [[nematocyst]]s. < ref > Stinging cells < /ref >  Like some others of its kind ''Glaucus'' does not digest the nematocysts; instead, it uses them to defend itself by passing them from its gut to the surface of its skin. < ref > Piper, Ross 2007.

 === Colours and defence === 
 [[File:Flabellina pedata nudibranch.jpg|thumb|right|''Flabellina pedata'', a nudibranch from East Timor]] 
 Among this group can be found the most colourful creatures on earth. In the course of [[evolution]], sea slugs have lost their shell, and have developed other defence mechanisms. Their anatomy may resemble the texture and color of the surrounding plants, giving them [[camouflage]] (''crypsis''). Many have an intense and bright colouring, which warns that they are distasteful or poisonous ([[Mimicry#Warning coloration|Warning coloration]]). 
 
 Nudibranchs that feed on [[hydroid]]s can store the hydroids' nematocysts (stinging cells) in the [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] body wall. < ref > Frick K. 2003. Predator suites and Flabellinid Nudibranch nematocyst complements in the Gulf of Maine. In: SF Norton (ed). ''Diving for Science''. ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences'', 22nd Annual Scientific Diving Symposium. url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4744 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106062453/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4744 |date=2011-01-06 }} < /ref >  The nematocysts wander through the [[alimentary canal]] without harming the nudibranch. Then, the cells are brought to specific places on the creature's hind body. Nudibranches can protect themselves from the hydroids and their nematocysts. It is not yet clear how, but special cells with large [[vacuole]]s probably play an important role. They can also take in plants' [[chloroplast]]s (plant cell [[organelle]]s used for [[photosynthesis]]) and use them to make food for themselves. 
 
 Another method of protection is the release of a sour liquid from the skin. Once the specimen is physically irritated or touched by another creature, it will release the [[slime]] automatically. 
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 The [[taxonomy]] of the Nudibranchia is still under investigation. 
 Meanwhile, the nudibranchs are commonly divided into two main types, ''dorid'' nudibranchs and ''aeolid'' or ''eolid'' nudibranchs:  < ref name=HansBertsch > Hans Bertsch, [http://slugsite.us/bow/nudi_han.htm Nudibranchs: Marine slugs with verve]. ''Navanax inermis[..] is the bane of all nudibranchs, because it is one of the few known predators on this group of slugs. [...] Dorids mainly eat sponges, bryozoans and tunicates, whereas eolids principally eat cnidarians.'' < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=http://marinelife.about.com/od/invertebrates/tp/Facts-About-Nudibranchs.htm | title=Astounding Nudibranch Facts | access-date=2012-12-13 | archive-date=2012-11-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118232415/http://marinelife.about.com/od/invertebrates/tp/Facts-About-Nudibranchs.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 * Dorids are recognised by the branchial (gill) plume, which forms a cluster on the posterior part of the body, around the anus.   
 * Aeolids have ''cerata'' on their backs, instead of the branchial plume. Some are hosts to [[zooxanthella]]e, which are [[endosymbiont]] brown [[dinoflagellate]]s of the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]''.
