 A '''cough''', also known as '''tussis''', is an action the body takes to get rid of anything that irritates the lungs or throat. To do this, muscles in the [[thoracic cavity]] contract to make air leave the [[lung]]s with a lot of force. Coughs often happen quickly and more than once, and are usually accompanied by a unique sound, also called a cough. 
 
 Coughs are more likely to happen when a person is sick, because infections often irritate breathing passages. Another cause of coughs is a person breathing air that is not clean, like air with [[dust]] or [[smoke]].
