'''Amylase''' is an [[enzyme]] which breaks down [[starch]] into [[sugars]] which the body can use. 
 
 More accurately, it is a family of similar enzymes which work in a wide range of animals, plants and [[fungi]]. There are two variants in humans: alpha-amylase, and gamma-amylase. < ref > [http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/74 PDB-101: Molecule of the month] < /ref > 
 
 Alpha-amylase is a major [[digestion|digestive]] enzyme. Its optimum [[pH]] is 6.7–7.0. It is found in [[saliva]] and [[pancreas|pancreatic juice]]. It takes starch chains and breaks them into smaller pieces with two or three glucose units. It can break down [[starch]] into [[maltose]]. It works in the mouth and [[stomach]] during digestion. 
 
 The gamma-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all amylases because it is most active around pH 3. Therefore, it works best in the [[stomach]], which does have an acidic pH. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.worthington-biochem.com/introbiochem/effectspH.html|title=Effects of pH (Introduction to Enzymes)|work=worthington-biochem.com|accessdate=17 May 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Human evolution== 
 Apparently, early humans did not possess salivary amylase. The closest evolutionary relatives of humans, [[chimpanzees]] and [[bonobo]]s, have either one or no copies of the gene for producing salivary amylase. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Vuorisalo, Timo  &  Arjamaa, Olli 2010. |title=Gene-culture coevolution and human diet |journal=American Scientist |volume=98 |issue=2 |page=140 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2010/2/gene-culture-coevolution-and-human-diet |access-date=2016-05-14 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110626/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2010/2/gene-culture-coevolution-and-human-diet |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   A duplication event of the AMY1 gene led to the production of amylase in the saliva. The same event occurred independently in [[rodents]]. This shows the importance of salivary amylase in organisms that eat relatively large amounts of starch. < ref name=Perry2007 > {{cite journal|last1=Perry G.H. ''et al 2007'' |title=Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy number variation.|journal=Nature Genetics |year=2007|volume=39 |issue=10|pages=1256–60|doi=10.1038/ng2123|pmid=17828263|pmc=2377015}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Carbohydrates]] are a food source rich in energy. After the [[agricultural revolution]], human diet began to rely more on plant and animal domestication in place of hunting and gathering. This shift marked the beginning of a diet composed of 49% carbohydrates as opposed to the previous 35% observed in [[Paleolithic]] humans. As such, starch became a staple of human diet. Humans that contained amylase in the saliva would benefit from increased ability to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. 
 
 Not all humans have the same number of copies of the AMY1 gene. Populations which rely on carbohydrates have a higher number of AMY1 copies than populations that eat little starch. The number of AMY1 gene copies in humans can range from six copies in [[agricultural]] groups such as European-American and Japanese (two high starch populations) to only 2-3 copies in hunter-gatherer societies such as the [[Aka people|Biaka]], [[Datog]], and [[Yakuts]]. 
 
 The [[correlation]] between starch consumption and number of AMY1 copies suggests that more AMY1 copies in high starch populations is caused by [[natural selection]]. It is a favorable [[phenotype]] for those individuals. Therefore, it is likely that having more copies of AMY1 in a high starch population increases [[fitness]] and produces healthier, fitter offspring. Geographically close populations with different eating habits possess a different number of copies of the AMY1 gene. This offers strong evidence that natural selection has acted on this gene. < ref name=Perry2007/ >
