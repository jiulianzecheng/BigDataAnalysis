 '''Atlantis''' is a name for a fictional large [[island]] or small [[continent]] that was in the Atlantic Ocean many years before it sank into the depth of the [[sea]]. < ref name=NatGeo > {{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/archaeology/atlantis/|publisher=National Geographic|author=Willie Drye|accessdate=September 6, 2020|title=Atlantis: Plato created the legend of Atlantis.

 The name Atlantis first appears in the writings of Herodotus - he describes the western ocean as  " Sea of Atlantis. "  Then, one generation later, Atlantis is described in detail in the stories Timaeus and Critias by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]]. < ref name= " Critias " > {{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/critias.html|title=Critias|author=Plato|translator=Benjamin Jowett|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=August 4, 2020|date=n.d.|orig-year=360 BCE|archive-date=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207020226/http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/critias.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   He used this story to help explain his ideas about [[government]] and [[philosophy]]. Plato was the only ancient writer who wrote specific things about Atlantis. < ref name=NatGeo / > 
 
 According to Plato, the Atlanteans lived 9000 years before his own time and were half human and half god.  They created a [[utopia|very good human society]].  When they stopped being good people and did bad things, the gods sent earthquakes and fire to destroy Atlantis. < ref name=NatGeo / > 
 
 Many scholars think that Plato could mean a real place when he was writing about Atlantis. For example, there was a [[Minoan]] kingdom on the island of [[Santorini]].  The Minoan kingdom was very powerful thousands of years before Plato, and their society was damaged when a [[volcano]] erupted on their island. < ref name=NatGeo / >  According to Plato, Atlantis was very large, as big as North Africa, so it should not have been hard to find. < ref name=Discover > {{cite news|author=Geoffrey Giller|publisher=Discover Magazine|url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/where-is-the-lost-city-of-atlantis-and-does-it-even-exist|title=Where Is the Lost City of Atlantis â€” and Does It Even Exist?|date=July 21, 2020|access-date=September 6, 2020|archive-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922073618/https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/where-is-the-lost-city-of-atlantis-and-does-it-even-exist|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 After the [[discovery of the New World|discovery of the Americas]], some people in Europe thought they might be Atlantis. < ref name=Discover / >  However, after Plato, the idea of Atlantis was mostly forgotten until 1882, when a writer named [[Ignatius Donnelly]] wrote a book saying that Atlantis was real and that the [[culture]] of Atlantis had started many other ancient cultures, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian and [[Mayas|Mayan]].  Then other people became interested in Atlantis. < ref name=Discover / >   < ref name=MinLaw > {{cite news|accessdate=September 6, 2020|publisher=Minnesota Lawyer|url=https://minnlawyer.com/2018/05/30/ignatius-donnelly-paranoid-progressive-in-the-gilded-age/|title=Ignatius Donnelly: Paranoid Progressive in the Gilded Age|date=May 30, 2018|author=Zac Farber|archive-date=September 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920132223/https://minnlawyer.com/2018/05/30/ignatius-donnelly-paranoid-progressive-in-the-gilded-age/|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 Atlantis has appeared in many works of fiction.  In [[Marvel Comics]], [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] is at the bottom of the ocean and exists in modern times, with people who breathe water.  Other works of fiction use Atlantis as background.  For example, [[Robert E. Howard]] set his [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories in a fictional time called the Hyborian Age, which began with the destruction of Atlantis and ended when real written history started. < ref name=Carnegie > {{cite news|publisher=Carnegie Library|accessdate=September 6, 2020|title=Conan the Cimmerian: Not the Barbarian You Remember|url=https://www.carnegielibrary.org/conan-the-cimmerian-not-what-you-remember/|date=November 7, 2018|archive-date=August 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809020805/https://www.carnegielibrary.org/conan-the-cimmerian-not-what-you-remember/|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name=ConanOfficial > {{cite web|url=https://conan.com/howards-hyborian-age/|publisher=Conan Official Site|date=August 6, 2019|accessdate=September 6, 2020|title=Howard's Hyborian Age|author=Tim Dedopulos|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806014337/https://conan.com/howards-hyborian-age/|url-status=live}} < /ref >
