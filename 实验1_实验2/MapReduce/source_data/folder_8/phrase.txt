A ''phrase'' is a group of words that adds meaning to a [[sentence]]. A phrase is not a [[sentence]] because it is not a complete idea with a [[wikt:subject|subject]], [[verb]] and a [[wikt:predicate|predicate]]. 18/11/2023 
 
 In English there are five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main [[Part of speech|parts of speech]]. In a phrase, the main word, or the word that is what the phrase is about, is called the '''head'''. In these examples, it is printed in '''bold'''. The other words in the phrase do the work of changing or ''modifying'' the head. 
 
 In a ''''Noun phrase'''', one or more words work together to give more [[information]] about a [[noun]].
