 '''Rafting''' is an [[Sport|outdoor sport]] in which a person uses an inflatable [[raft]] to navigate a [[river]] or other body of water. This is often done on rough water. This usually requires teamwork. < ref > {{cite journal | url=https://doi.org/10.1080%2F14729670701349624 | doi=10.1080/14729670701349624 | title=An analysis of whitewater rafting safety data: Risk management for programme organizers | year=2007 | last1=Hunter | first1=I.

 ==History== 
 Rafting goes back to 1811 when the first attempt to go on the Snake River was planned. With no training, the river was too difficult and dangerous. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.whitewaterrafting.com/rafting-info/history | title=History of Whitewater Rafting  & #124; Whitewater Rafting | date=7 April 2017 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Classes of water== 
 The International Scale of River Difficulty use six grades of difficulty to describe rivers for white water rafting. The scale ranges from simple to very dangerous and potential death or serious injuries. 
 
 *'''Class 1:''' Very small rough areas, might require slight maneuvering. (Skill level: Very basic) 
 *'''Class 2:''' Some rough water, maybe some rocks, might require some maneuvering. (Skill level: Basic paddling skill) 
 *'''Class 3:''' Small waves, maybe a small drop, but no very dangerous. May require significant maneuvering. (Skill level: Some experience in rafting) 
 *'''Class 4:''' Whitewater, medium waves, maybe rocks, maybe a considerable drop, sharp maneuvers may be needed.(Skill level: Exceptional rafting experience) 
 *'''Class 5:''' Whitewater, large waves, large volume, possibility of large rocks and hazards, possibility of a large drop, requires precise maneuvering. (Skill level: Full mastery of rafting) 
 *'''Class 6:''' Class 6 rapids are considered to be so dangerous that they are effectively unnavigable on a reliably safe basis. Rafters can expect a lot of whitewater, huge waves, huge rocks and hazards, and/or substantial drops that will have severe impacts beyond the structural capacities and impact ratings of almost all rafting equipment. Traversing a Class 6 rapid has a dramatically increased likelihood of ending in serious injury or death compared to lesser classes. (Skill level: Full mastery of rafting, and even then it may not be safe < ref > Costello, Ben.
