 '''Tapestry''' is art made with threads. It is [[Weaving|woven]] by hand on a vertical [[loom]]. It is [[weft]]-faced weaving. This means all the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads (the ones that go up and down) are hidden in the completed work. In normal cloth weaving both the warp and the weft threads can be seen.  
 
 In this way, a colourful pattern or image is made. Most weavers use a natural warp thread such as [[linen]] or [[cotton]]. The weft threads, which will be seen, are usually [[wool]] or cotton. They can also be made of [[silk]], [[gold]], [[silver]], or other things. 
 
 Both craftsmen and artists have made tapestries. The 'blueprints' on cardboard (also known as 'tapestry [[cartoon]]s') were made by [[artist]]s, while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by [[craft]]smen.

 The success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability ([[Le Corbusier]] once called tapestries  " nomadic [[mural]] < nowiki/ > s " ). Kings and [[Nobility|noblemen]] could roll up and transport tapestries from one residence to another. In churches, they were displayed on special occasions. Tapestries were also draped on the walls of castles for insulation during winter, as well as for decorative display. 
 
 The famous Bayeux tapestry is not actually a tapestry, but a decorated cloth. And it was probably designed and made in England by [[Anglo-Saxon]] artists. < ref > Wilson, David M. 1985. ''The Bayeux tapestry''. London: Thames and Hudson, 201â€“227. < /ref >
