The '''hypotenuse''' is the [[side]] opposite the 90 [[degree (geometry)|degrees]] [[angle]] in a [[right triangle]]. It is always the longest side. 
 
 For example: 
   
 [[Image:Rtriangle.svg|A right triangle]] 
 
 In this triangle, if angle C is 90 degrees, then the opposite side,  " c " , is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is important in [[trigonometry]], where it is used to calculate many [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. 
 
 The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using [[Pythagoras' Theorem]].  In fact, the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using this theorem.
