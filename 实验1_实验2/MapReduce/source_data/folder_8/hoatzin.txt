 The '''hoatzin''' (''Opisthocomus hoazin'') is a tropical bird found in [[swamp]]s, river [[forests]], and [[mangrove]]s of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the [[Orinoco]] delta in [[South America]]. 
 
 They are the only bird which eats leaves as a main part of their diet. Their gut has special [[adaptations]] which help their [[digestion]]. 
 
 The hoatzin is also notable for having young with claws on two of their wing digits. They are the only living member of the family Opisthocomidae. Its close relatives probably died out long ago. There has been much debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds. 
 
 == Life-style == 
 Hoatzin chicks are born with hooks on their wings. They use the hooks to climb around in the trees before they are large enough to fly. < ref name=Bird > {{cite book |title= LIFEPAC Geography and History |author= Theresa K. Buskey |publisher= Alpha Omega Publications |location= 804 N. 2nd Ave. E., Rock Rapids, IA |isbn= |page=22 |url= }} < /ref >  Hoatzins can fly only short distances even when they are fully grown, so they usually climb. < ref name=Bird/ > 
 
 They build their nests over water. If danger threatens, the birds dive into the water. They climb back up the tree after the danger has passed. < ref name=Bird/ > 
 Hoatzins communicate through unusual sounds that resemble wheezing, grunting, growls, and hisses. 
 
 == Digestion == 
 The hoatzin is the only bird that [[digestion |digests]] leaves. < ref name= " Encyclopædia Britannica " > {{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/268421/hoatzin |title=hoatzin (bird) |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate= 2010-09-01}} < /ref >  Their [[odor]] has been compared to fresh cow [[dung]]. The odor is caused by their [[digestive system]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://fp.auburn.edu/sfws/ditchkoff/Nutrition%20Class%20Papers/Grajal%20et%20al.%201989.pdf |title= Foregut fermentation in the hoatzin, a neotropical leaf-eating bird |date= 1989 |publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate= 2010-09-01 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 The hoatzin eats the [[leaves]] and some [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of plants which grow in the wet habitats where it lives. It clambers around clumsily among the branches. Once it was thought that the species only could eat the leaves of  [[Araceae|arums]] and [[Avicennia|mangroves]], but the species does eat the leaves of more than fifty [[species]]. One study undertaken in [[Venezuela]] found that the hoatzin diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit. < ref name =  " HBW " > Thomas B.T. (1996).  " Family Opisthocomidae (Hoatzins) " .

 One of this species' many peculiarities is that it has a digestive system unique amongst birds. Hoatzins use bacterial [[fermentation]] in the front part of the gut to break down the vegetable material, much as [[cattle]] and other [[ruminant]]s do. Unlike ruminants, however, which have the [[rumen]] (a specialized stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large [[crop (anatomy)|crop]], folded in two chambers, and a large, multi-chambered lower [[oesophagus]]. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds. 
 
 The [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] of the hoatzin is so large that it displaces the flight muscles and keel of the sternum. This is why they fly so poorly. Because of [[aromatic hydrocarbon |aromatic compounds]] in the leaves they eat, and the bacterial fermentation, the bird has a disagreeable, [[manure]]-like odor. It is only hunted by humans for food in times of great need. If the bird feeds on insects or other animal matter, that is purely accidental. < ref > {{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.245.4923.1236 |last=Grajal A. |display-authors = etal |year=1989 |title=Foregut fermentation in the Hoatzin, a neotropical leaf-eating bird |journal=Science |volume= 245 |issue=4923 |pages=1236–1238 |pmid=17747887|bibcode=1989Sci...245.1236G |s2cid=21455374 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Relationships == 
 So far (2015) very few birds have had their total genome analysed. More recently, a start was made to sequence the entire genome of the hoatzin. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/hoatzin.htm |title=The Hoatzin Genome Project |access-date=2015-03-02 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090936/http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/hoatzin.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   As of 2011, it was reported that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of hoatzin DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire [[haploid]] [[genome]], but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Of birds, the genomes of only four [[species]] have been sequenced. Much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with analysing the hoatzin foregut ruminant bacterial [[microflora]]. < ref > [http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/hoatzin.html  " Why sequence Hoatzin crop microbiome? "  US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute web page] Retrieved 2011-Feb-20. < /ref >  At present, the nearest relatives of the hoatzin are not known. There is a [[fossil]] record which suggests its lineage is fairly ancient. < ref name=HBW/ >
