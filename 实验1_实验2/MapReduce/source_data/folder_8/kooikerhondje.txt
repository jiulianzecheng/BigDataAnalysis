 ==Temperament== 
 The Kooikerhondje, like most spaniels, is a very energetic dog that needs plenty of exercise.  The  are mostly friendly and get along with children and other pets.  However, as they are bred gundogs they will have instincts to hunt so care should be taken around pet birds especially. < ref name= " Vetstreet " > {{cite web |title=Kooikerhondje |url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/kooikerhondje |publisher=Vetstreet.com |accessdate=17 July 2021}} < /ref >
