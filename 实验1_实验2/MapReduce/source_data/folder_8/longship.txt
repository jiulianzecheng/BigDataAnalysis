 '''Longships''' were [[:en:wikt:seagoing|seagoing]] vessels made and used for trade, exploring, and raiding. They are usually thought of as [[Viking]] ships but were used by early people on the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[North Sea]]. It was the Vikings who mastered the design of light fast longships that could also go up rivers. At the beginning of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period in [[Britain]], the invading groups of [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]] and [[Jutes]] arrived in longships. From that time on longships were also being built and used in the [[British Isles]]. When the [[Normans]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquered England]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] used a large fleet of longships to transport his army to [[England]].  
 
 == Origins == 
  [[File:Hjortspringboot side.jpg|thumb|left|320px|{{Center|A Model of the Hjortspring boat from the German Museum in Munich.}}]]  
 The earliest discovered longship built from [[:en:wikt:planks|planks]] traces back to {{circa|350}} [[:wikt:BC|BC]]. < ref name=Durham7 > Keith Durham, ''Viking Longship'' (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002), P. 7 < /ref >  The ship was recovered from the Hjortspring [[bog]] in southern [[Denmark]]. Called the Hjortspring boat it was made of planks of wood sewn together with cord. The spaces between planks were filled with [[resin]]. < ref name=Durham7/ >  The ship was about 59 feet (18 meters) long and was a very light and flexible design. < ref > Paul Johnstone, ''The Sea-craft of Prehistory' (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 1988), p. 115 < /ref >  It had a double bow and stern that looked like a bird's beak. The ship had places for 20 men to row and had a steering oar at both ends. A [[:wikt:replica|replica]] of this design was built and tested. It was very [[:en:wikt:seaworthy|seaworthy]], fast and [[:en:wikt:maneuverable|maneuverable]]. In calm waters it averaged 6 knots (about 7 miles per hour) in speed.  
 [[File:Chambers 1908 Clinker.png|thumb|right|160px|{{Center|Clinker-built compared to [[:en:wikt:carvel-built|carvel-built]].}}]]  
 The next design was of [[:en:wikt:clinker-built|clinker-built]] construction (also called [[:en:wikt:lapstrake|lapstrake]]). In this design overlapping boards are held together with nails. < ref > ''Cogs, Cargoes and Commerce: Maritime Bulk Trade in Northern Europe, 1150-1400'', eds. Lars Berggren; Nils Hybel; Annette Landen, (Toronto: Pontificial Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2002), p. 94 < /ref >  Named the Nydam ship for being found in the Nydam bog in 1863 in south [[Jutland]]. It measured 77 feet (23.5 meters) long, a little over 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide and was about 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep. < ref name=Durham8 > Keith Durham, ''Viking Longship'' (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002), P. 8 < /ref >  This ship was sunk (and filled with [[weapons]]) between 350–400 [[:wikt:AD|AD]]. Unlike the Hjortspring boat, the planks are held together with nails (the tips being bent over). < ref name=Durham8/ >  It did not have a [[mast]], as later designs would, it had places for 30 men to row. It also did not have a [[:en:wikt:keel|keel]]. This kind of shallow open ship could cross open sea but could be swamped (filled with water) and sink. < ref name=Durham8/ >  This was a classic Northern design that in different forms{{efn|This design was used for fishing boats, cargo ships, coastal ships or warships. < ref name=Johnstone116/ > }} could range as far as [[Constantinople]] or [[Newfoundland]]. < ref name=Johnstone116 > Paul Johnstone, ''The Sea-craft of Prehistory' (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 1988), p. 116 < /ref > 
 
 == Classic types == 
 
 The Viking designed longship could cross an ocean or could row up a shallow river. < ref > Robert Lomas, ''Turning the Templar Key'' (Beverly, MA: Fair Winds Press, 2007), p. 148 < /ref >  Over time the design changed. There were many different types of longships built for different purposes. The smallest ships were the ''Faering'' (four oars) and ''Sexaeringer'' (six [[oar]] < nowiki/ > s) used around the [[:wikt:fjords|fjords]] to move people and for fishing.  
 [[File:Gokstad-ship-model.jpg|thumb|right|230px|{{Center|Model of the Gokstad ship.}}]] 
 ===Karvi=== 
 
 Longships of from 12 to 32 oars were called ''Karvi''. The [[Gokstad Ship]] is a famous ship of the Karvi type. < ref name=Chartrand142 > René Chartrand, ''The Vikings: Voyagers of Discovery and Plunder'' (Oxford; New York: Osprey, 2008), p. 142 < /ref >  The Gokstad ship was excavated in 1880. Its mast was cut off but otherwise the ship was well preserved. < ref > Johannes Brøndsted, ''The Vikings'' (Harmondsworth, UK; Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1973), p. 140 < /ref >  It was 76 feet (23 meters) long and 17½ (5.3 meters) wide. The Gokstad ship had a keel and was made of [[oak]]. Its rudder was about 11 feet (3.3 meters) long; big enough to steer the ship in any weather. The mast stood about 40 feet (12 meters) tall. 
 
 A replica of the Gokstad ship sailed across the [[Atlantic]] ocean in 1893. < ref > Johannes Brøndsted, ''The Vikings'' (Harmondsworth, UK; Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1973), p. 141 < /ref > 
 
 ===Snekkja=== 
 [[Image:Moragsoorm.jpg|thumb|right|230px|{{center|A replica of a Viking ''snekkja'' in [[Morąg]], Poland}}]] 
 A specialized type of ship with at least 20 rowing benches was called a ''snekkja'', meaning 'thin and projecting.' < ref name=Chartrand142/ >  It was a warship known to be used by both [[Sweden|Swedish]] Vikings and [[Wends]]. It could carry 44 men and 2 horses. < ref name=Magnusson43 > E. Magnússon, ''Notes on shipbuilding  &  nautical terms of old in the North'' (London: W. A. Moring, 1906), p. 43 < /ref >  Snekkjas were one of the most common types of warship. [[Duke]] Ratibor of the Wends had 660 of this type of ship he used when he attacked Kongälf in 1135. < ref name=Magnusson43/ > 
 
 === Skeid === 
 
 Skeid (skeið), meaning 'that which cuts through water,' ships were larger warships. < ref name=Jesch124 > Judith Jesch, ''Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse'' (Rochester, NY: D.S. Brewer, 2001), p. 124 < /ref >  Skeids usually had more than 30 rowing benches. These were the largest longships ever discovered. They had [[:wikt:armour|armour]] over the oar ports (openings for the oars) protecting the men rowing. < ref name=Jesch124/ >  King [[Æthelred the Unready|Aethelred]] of England ordered this type of ship to be made throughout England. Every district of 310 [[hides (unit)|hides]] was to provide one such ship. < ref name=Jesch124/ > 
 
 === Drakkar === 
 [[File:Stockholm Drakkar.jpg|thumb|right|230px|{{Center|A Drakkar ship in Stockholm.}}]] 
 The largest warships of the era were of the Drakaar (dragon) type. < ref name=Holman243 > Katherine Holman, ''The A to Z of the Vikings'' (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2009), p. 243 < /ref >  King [[Olaf I of Norway]] had a famous longship of this design called ''Long Serpent''. King [[Olaf II of Norway]] had a longship named ''Visunden'' (the Ox). It had an Ox head carved in the [[:en:wikt:prow|prow]]. < ref name=Holman243/ >  [[Matilda of Flanders]] had a ship built for her husband  [[William the Conqueror]] of the Drakkar design. < ref > David C. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (Berkeley  &  Los Angeles: The University of California Press, 1964), p. 190 < /ref >  It was named the ''Mora'' and was built at [[Barfleur]] in Normandy in the summer of 1066. < ref > Paul Hilliam, ''William the Conqueror: First Norman King of England'' (New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 2005), p. 39 < /ref >  This type could operate in shallow water and was easy to beach. < ref name=Holman243/ > 
 
 === Transport ships === 
 
 Many of this type of ship were called ''Knarrs''. < ref > ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings'', ed. Peter Sawyer (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 193 < /ref >  From the [[9th century]] larger sailing ships were used for overseas trading. < ref > Seán McGrail, ''Boats of the World: From the Stone Age to Medieval Times'' (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004), p. 212 < /ref >  Many were specialized cargo ships. They were marked by having a small crew, few oars, and depended on sails for power. They had a large load capacity for a variety of cargo. < ref name=Brink176 > ''The Viking World'', eds. Stefan Brink; Neil Price (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2008), p. 176 < /ref >  An example would be the Klåstad ship. It was built in the last years of the 10th century. The ship was wrecked near Kaupang in [[Norway]]. It had a capacity of about 13 tons and a length of 69 feet (21 meters). < ref name=Brink176/ > 
 
 Another form of [[:wikt:cargo|cargo]] ship was the horse [[:wikt:transports|transports]] used by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066. In the ''ship list'' it gives a total of 776 vessels in the Conqueror's fleet. < ref > Elisabeth M. C. van Houts, ' The Ship List of William the Conqueror', ''Anglo-Norman Studies X; Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1987'', ed. R. Allen Brown (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1988), p. 166 < /ref >  Many were for the [[knight]]s and [[soldiers]] but others were used to haul the supplies and horses they needed. Earlier Vikings did not use horse transports and usually used the horses they found in the places they invaded. < ref name=Douglas202 > David C. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (Berkeley; Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1964), p. 202 < /ref >  The Normans, however, used [[cavalry]] and needed to transport their [[Destrier|war horses]] and [[palfrey]]s. But the Normans in [[Sicily]] had used horse transports (1060–61) before possibly based on [[Byzantine]] ships of a similar design. < ref name=Douglas203 > David C. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (Berkeley; Los Angeles, University of California Press, 1964), p. 203 < /ref >  The Byzantines had ships called ''hippagogoi'' designed to land horses which could go right into battle. < ref > Bernard S. Bachrach, 'On the Origins of William the Conqueror's Horse Transports', ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Jul., 1985), p. 513 < /ref >  [[Guy of Amiens]] observed that William's invasion force included men from [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]], and Sicily. William had [[:en:wikt:shipbuilders|shipbuilders]] familiar with building horse transports at his disposal. How many he built is unknown, but he did have such ships in his fleet. < ref > Bernard S. Bachrach, 'On the Origins of William the Conqueror's Horse Transports', ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Jul., 1985), pp. 514–15 < /ref >
