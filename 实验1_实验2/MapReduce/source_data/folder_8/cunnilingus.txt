 '''Cunnilingus''' is when a man or another woman has [[oral sex]] with a woman. He (or she) licks her [[sex organs]] with his (or her) [[lip]]s and [[tongue]]. The word comes from a [[Latin]] word for the [[vulva]] (''cunnus'') and from the Latin word for tongue (''lingua''). 
 
 The [[clitoris]] is the main part of the woman's sex organs that brings the most feeling. Often, a woman reaches an [[orgasm]] during cunnilingus. < ref name=Shere > {{cite book| last = Hite| first = Shere| title = The Hite Report: a nationwide study of female sexuality| publisher = Seven Stories Press| date = 2004| location = New York, NY| pages = 11| isbn=1-58322-569-2}} < /ref >
