[[File:Seneca.JPG|thumb|250px|Ancient bronze bust, known as ''[[Pseudo-Seneca]]''. This is now believed to be an imaginative portrait of Hesiod. < ref > {{cite book |author= Erika Simon |title= Pergamon und Hesiod |language=German |location= Mainz am Rhein |publisher= Philipp von Zabern |year=1975 |oclc=2326703}} < /ref > ]]The '''Theogony''' ({{lang-el|Θεογονία}}, ''Theogonía'', the birth of the [[polytheism|gods]]) is a [[poem]] by [[Hesiod]]. It was written in the 8th or 7th century BC, and uses the same dialect of [[Ancient Greek]] as [[Homer]]. This dialect is known as [[Epic dialect]] today. With the exception of the [[Illiad]] and the [[Odyssey]], the Theogony is the oldest known source of Greek [[mythology]]. 
 
 The poem is a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of different Greek stories and traditions. It is a story that tells how the gods came to be and how they established permanent control over the cosmos. It is the first [[Greece|Greek]] [[myth]]ical [[cosmogony]]. In the beginning, the state of the universe is [[Chaos (mythology)|chaos]] - a dark indefinite void. Everything else appeared from divine chaos.
