 '''Dwarfism''' is used to describe a person of short stature, less than 4 feet, 10 inches (147 cm). This is often, though not always, because of a [[medical condition]]. People with this condition are called '''dwarves''' or '''little people'''. A similar term for short people is [[midget]]; however, dwarves and midgets are not the same. Midgets are perfectly proportioned humans, while dwarves have a large head and misshapen limbs and torsos. 
 
 Dwarfism is usually caused by the person inheriting an  [[allele]] (a [[mutation|mutant]] [[gene]]), which produces a defect in development. Defects caused by [[genetics]] are the main kind of [[congenital defect]]s, and usually cannot be cured.  
 
 The most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in [[bone]] development called '''''achondroplasia''''', in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body. This accounts for 70% of cases.  
 
 Extreme shortness, but with body parts of normal proportions, may be caused by growth [[hormone]] deficiency, once known as '''''[[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] dwarfism'''''. < ref name='dwarfism-pbshome' > {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_dwarfism_ety.html |title=P.O.V. – Big Enough.

 There are more than 200 other conditions which may cause dwarfism. < ref name= " urlMedlinePlus: Dwarfism " > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dwarfism.html |title=MedlinePlus: Dwarfism |date=2008-08-04|publisher=National Institute of Health|work=MedlinePlus |accessdate=2008-10-03}} < /ref >

 In the 19th century in the [[United States]], people with dwarfism were a major attraction of many [[circus]] [[sideshow]]s. The most famous little people in the history of the American circus are [[General Tom Thumb]] and [[Michu]]. < ref > Ogden, Tom. 1993. ''The American Circus''. Facts on File. p. 237. < /ref >
