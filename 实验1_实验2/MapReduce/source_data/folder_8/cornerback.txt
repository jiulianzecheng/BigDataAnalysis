 A '''cornerback''' is a position on defense in [[American football]]. Corners can rush the passer, intercept balls, tackle, and deflect passes. Their main job is to stop the opponent's receivers from making a catch.  Cornerbacks usually line up on the edges, or sides, of the defensive line opposite their opponent's receivers.   In ''zone defense'', corners are assigned to a specific area of the field, in which they cannot let anyone make a catch. In ''man defense'', corners cover one player and try to stop them from catching a ball.
