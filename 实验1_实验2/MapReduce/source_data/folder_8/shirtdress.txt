 A '''shirtdress''' is a style of [[dress]] which borrows details from a boy's-man's [[dress shirt]]. These can include a [[collar (clothing)|collar]], a [[button]] [[Placket|front]], or [[cuff]]ed [[sleeve]]s. Often, these dresses are made up in crisp fabrics like [[cotton]] or [[silk]], much like a men's [[dress shirt]] would be. As they are typically cut without a [[Sewing|seam]] at the waist, these dresses often have a looser fit, usually relying on a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] to define the waist. Button fronts and a forgiving fit make this a flattering look for most [[body types]].
