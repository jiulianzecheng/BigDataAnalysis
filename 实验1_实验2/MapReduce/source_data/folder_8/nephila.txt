 They are also known as the golden silk orb-weavers, golden orb-weavers, giant wood spiders, or banana spiders. Males are smaller than females. Females often get a choice to mate and share gifts with their mates. 
 
 ''Nephila'' spiders have large [[sexual dimorphism]] in size, with females being much larger than males. 
 
 ''Nephila'' species are often parasitized by ''Argyrodes'', a genus of very small black-and-silver spiders. These small spiders are kleptoparasitic: they live by stealing food from their hostess.
