In [[physical cosmology]], '''baryogenesis''' is a process that is thought to have happened during the beginning of the [[universe]]. It would create an imbalance in amount of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] in the universe, called baryonic asymmetry. It is still a problem in modern [[physics]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Barrow|first1=John D.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|date=1981|title=Baryosynthesis and the origin of galaxies|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/291469a0|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=291|issue=5815|pages=469â€“472|doi=10.1038/291469a0|bibcode=1981Natur.291..469B|s2cid=4243415|issn=0028-0836}} < /ref >
