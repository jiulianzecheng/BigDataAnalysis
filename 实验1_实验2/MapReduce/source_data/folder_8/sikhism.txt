 '''Sikhism''' is a [[religion]] and [[philosophy]] that started in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] region of [[South Asia]] (modern-day [[Pakistan]]) around the late [[15th century]]. It's one of the newest [[Religion|major religions]], ranking as the fifth-largest worldwide, with about 25–30 million followers known as ''Sikhs''. < ref name= " Britannica " > McLeod, William Hewat. 2019 [1998]. {{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism |title=Sikhism |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |access-date=7 August 2018}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-50374567| title = Sikhs in Wolverhampton celebrate 550 years of Guru Nanak| work = BBC News| date = 12 November 2019}} < /ref >  The teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]], the founder of Sikhism, and the nine [[Guru|gurus]] who followed him formed the foundation of Sikhism. The tenth guru, [[Gobind Singh]], declared the Sikh scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]] as the eternal guide for Sikhs, concluding the line of human gurus. [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] emphasized living a practical life with values like truthfulness, fidelity, self-control, and purity, prioritizing these over abstract truths. Guru Hargobind, the sixth guru, introduced the idea of balancing the worldly and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of [[life]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doCmVaOnh_wC|title=Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R.

 The Sikh scripture begins with the [[Mul Mantar]], a fundamental prayer about Ik Onkar ('One God'). Sikhism's key beliefs, found in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], include faith and [[meditation]] in the name of the one creator, recognizing the unity and equality of all humans, selfless service, seeking justice for everyone's well-being, and maintaining honesty while leading a family life < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t3CFAwAAQBAJ & pg=PA672|title=Religion, War, and Ethics: A Sourcebook of Textual Traditions|last1=Reichberg|first1=Gregory M.|last2=Syse|first2=Henrik|date=2014-05-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-95204-0|language=en}} < /ref > . Sikhism rejects the idea that any specific religion holds a monopoly on absolute truth. It encourages practices like [[meditation]] (simran) and remembering the teachings through [[music]] (kirtan) or internal reflection (naam japna) to feel God's presence. Sikhs are taught to overcome the  " Five Thieves "  – lust, rage, greed, attachment, and ego. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Socially Involved Renunciate: Guru Nanak's Discourse to the Nath Yogis|vauthors=Nayar, Kamala Elizabeth, Sandhu, Jaswinder Singh|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7914-7950-6|pages=106}} < /ref > 
 
 == Beliefs == 
 [[File:Pilgrims inside the Golden Temple (9693303510).jpg|thumb|Sikh people]] 
 [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is not just a holy book for Sikhs, it is respected and treated as a living being as it is officially The Eternal Guru (Teachers). Shri Guru Granth Sahib is not written by one human but by saints from all across societies and religions. It is a universal teacher for all religions giving the message of one God and respect to all humans of every religion. 
 
 === Some basic beliefs === 
 * There is nothing that is beyond or outside the one God. So, therefore there is nothing being created or destroyed, as the creation and destruction are still only part of the one. 
 * The goal of [[life]] is to focus on being at one with God. This is attainable by meditation, prayer, and being in the company of others who share a similar goal. 
 
 === God === 
 Sikhism teaches that God lasts forever, cannot be seen, and has no body. Therefore, God has no gender. It is taught that God created the universe  and keeps it running. God is considered to be infinite, Alpha and Omega, no beginning and no end. Sikhs worship God, and meditate on God’s name through intense (passionate) repetition. They believe everything is a part of God and God is a part of everything. Good, bad, neutral are not applicable to God and are meant only for human beings, as Sikh philosophy indicates that human beings are born innately good. Since God created the world he could destroy it whenever he wants. 
 
 === Salvation === 
 Followers are all trying to reach [[salvation]], meaning they are trying to break the process of rebirth and become one with God. The thing that is keeping people from reaching union is bad [[karma]]. Bad karma is taught to be caused by pride, anger, greed, attachment and lust. Sikhs try to stay away from these things. Sikhs also believe that a piece of God resides within everything in the world. Once an individual discovers the God within and stops searching else then can he reach salvation. 
 
 == Temples == 
 {{main|Sikh temple}} 
 A [[Sikh temple]] is called a ''Gurdwara'' (meaning  " the house of Guru " ). It is the place of worship in the Sikh religion. Birth, death, baptism and marriage ceremonies are held in the temple. There are four doors for all religions. When a person enters the temple, their head must be covered. There are no chairs in the temple so people sit on the floor. 
 
 The temple also serves as a [[kitchen]]. The kitchen is where festival food is donated, prepared and cooked by volunteers. All the food that has been made there is shared with all the community who visit the temple on that day. The meal is [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and is called the [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]. 
 
 Three holiest sites in Sikhism are the [[Nankana Sahib|Gurudwara Janam Asthan]], [[Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur|Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib]] in [[Pakistan]] and the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] in [[India]]. 
 
 In a Gurdwara, no special place or seat may be reserved or set aside for any dignitary, as all are considered equals. The service consists of singing of the liturgy, as well as the exposition of Sikh history, tradition, and theology.  In traditional Indian society, people of high and low caste were rigidly segregated. To combat this social problem, the Sikh community kitchen, or ''langar'', requires everyone to sit side by side and eat together, thereby teaching the concept of equality by shattering all barriers of caste and class. Every major city in the United States and Canada has Sikh gurdwaras and they are open to all Sikh people go to Gurdwara to worship God. 
 
 == Vaisakhi == 
 {{main|Vaisakhi}} 
 Vaisakhi is an important [[festival]] celebrated by Sikhs. Vaisakhi is also known as Basaki. It is the [[harvest festival]] in the Punjab region. Vaisakhi is celebrated on the first day of the Basak month, in the [[Nanakshahi calendar]]. 
 
 == Gurus and religious authority == 
 The term [[guru]] comes from the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurū'', which means teacher, guide, or mentor. The [[tradition]]s and [[philosophy]] of Sikhism were made by ten gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous one. This resulted in the creation of the Sikh religion. 
 
 And the eternal Guru is the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]], which is a not just a book but contains the writings of each Guru. 
 
 In addition to the above, Sikhs also believe in fifteen ''bhagats'' or [[saint]] < nowiki/ > s, including ones from other creeds, whose words and deeds have been adopted into Sikhism by the great ten Gurus. Most notable of these ''bhagats'' is the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sufi]] saint, Hazrat [[Baba Farid|Baba Farfood]] 
 
 '''Food Banks''' 
 
 Sikhs believe in equality therefore they have food banks to go and get food for free. 
 
 '''Extra facts''' 
 
 It is said that Sikhs have to give 10% of their earnings to charity. 
 
 Sikhs believe in equality therefore the are all equal in money. Nobody is poor and nobody is rich. There is a Sikh alphabet. Sikhism, religion and philosophy founded in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent in the late 15th century. The Sikhs call their faith Gurmat (Punjabi: “the Way of the Guru”). According to Sikh tradition, Sikhism was established by Guru Nanak (1469–1539) and subsequently led by a succession of nine other Gurus.

 === 5 Ks === 
 Khalsa is the military community of Sikhism. A Sikh must follow the 5 Ks: 
 
 # Having unshorn/uncut hair. This is called a Kesh. Whether male or female, a person is required to keep their Kesh covered. People usually cover their Kesh with a [[turban]], or a [[scarf]] (Chunni). 
 # A wooden [[comb]] in their hair. This is called a Kanga. This symbolizes cleanliness which is an important part of Sikhism. 
 # A [[steel]] bangle. This is for protection and physical reminder that a one is bound to the Guru. This is called a Kara. This is to show that God has no beginning and no end. 
 # [[Cotton]] [[underwear]] that has to be always worn. This is called a Kachera. It is a reminder to stay away from lust and attachment. 
 # A [[sword]]. This is worn to defend one's faith and protect the weak. This is called Kirpan. It is only to be used in self-defense. Many of these are now welded shut.
