[[File:Mercapto Group General Formulae.png|thumb|right|200px|General formula for a thiol]] 
 A '''thiol''' is a [[molecule]] that has a Râ€“SH [[functional group|group]]. Thiols are like [[alcohol]]s with an [[oxygen]] atom changed with a [[sulfur]] one. They have often a very strong and bad smell. Thiols are added to [[natural gas]] so that people can smell it. This is because [[methane]] does not have a smell but can explode very easily. 
 
 Thiols are very easy to [[redox|oxidize]]. They are also quite [[acid|acidic]], more than alcohols. When the proton is taken away by a [[base (chemistry)|base]], the thiol can become a [[nucleophile]]. It can do reactions like [[nucleophilic substitution]]. 
 
 One of the natural [[amino acid]]s, [[cysteine]], has a thiol in its structure.
