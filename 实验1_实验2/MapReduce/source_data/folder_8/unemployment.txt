 '''Unemployment''' or '''joblessness''' is when a [[person]] who is of normal working [[Ageing|age]] (usually about 15-18 to about 60-65) does not have a paid [[job]]. They therefore do not get paid a [[salary]]. It is one of [[social issue]]s and human rights violations. In some parts of the [[world]], there are [[social network]]s to care for the unemployed. 
 
 == Overview == 
 The [[unemployment rate]] is the number of unemployed people divided by the total population of that age group of a country. The unemployment rate is influenced by many things, including the government of a country to the average age of a country's population. Unemployment is a bad thing for society. 
 
 A certain amount of unemployment is natural. 'Full [[employment]]' does not mean no-one is out of work. Governments now aim to increase the number of jobs (which can be done) rather than cut out all unemployment (which cannot be done). < ref > Tom de Castella  &  Caroline McClatchey 2011.

 == Most affected groups == 
 People with [[Autism]] and other mental disabilities are mistreated in the workplace, leading to only around 15% of autistic people being employed at all. 
 ==Invisible unemployment== 
 '''Discouraged workers''' are the number of people who do not have work but who are not counted in government reports. For example, people who have stopped looking for a job.  The '''underemployed'''  are people who work less than they want to do, or people who are overqualified for their job.
