 The '''longsword''' is a [[Europe]]an sword. It was mainly used during the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] periods, about 1350 to 1550 [[AD]]. Early and late use is known in the 13th and 17th centuries. 
 
 The longsword has a long blade, but also a long grip, which means it is a weapon designed for two-handed use.
