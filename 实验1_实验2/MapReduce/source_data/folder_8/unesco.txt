 '''UNESCO''' is the '''United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization''' ({{lang-fr|L'Organisation des Nations unies pour l’éducation, la science et la culture}}). It is an [[agency]] of the [[United Nations]] (UN).  
 
 UNESCO says its purpose, as defined just after the end of [[World War II]], is  " to build the defenses of peace in the minds of men and women " . It does this by helping nations work together, through [[right to education|education]] for all, [[science]], and [[culture]]. This is supposed to help other nations follow the [[rule of law]] and [[human rights]]. It also helps promote some [[freedom]]s in the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]]. < ref name=history > {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/about-us/who-we-are/history/ |title=UNESCO History |publisher=www.unesco.org |accessdate=23 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 UNESCO has 195 Member countries. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11170 & URL_DO=DO_TOPIC & URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Member States  & #124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |accessdate=23 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 UNESCO tries to achieve what it wants to do through six programs: education, [[natural science]]s, social and [[human science]]s, culture, communication and [[information]]. Some projects [[sponsor]]ed by UNESCO are [[literacy]], technical, and teacher-training programmes. UNESCO also decides what will become [[World Heritage Site]]s. A World Heritage Site is an important, special, interesting or beautiful place. If a place is a World Heritage Site, the place can not be destroyed, as it can give useful information for the future. The [[Uluru]], for example, gives a lot of information on the culture of [[Aborigines]]. UNESCO is also a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |title=UNDG Members |publisher=Undg.org |accessdate=2011-08-08 |archive-date=2011-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and works for [[Millennium Development Goals]].
