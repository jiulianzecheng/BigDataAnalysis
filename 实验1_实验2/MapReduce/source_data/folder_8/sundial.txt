 A '''sundial''' shows the current [[solar time]] during the day. It does this because the [[sun]] appears to move through the sky. At different times in the day when the sun is shining, a [[shadow]] is cast in different places on the dial. A person marks the dial with the time at a certain shadow. This lets users easily see the time. There are a few commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard horizontal garden sundial. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow. They may be horizontal or vertical or tilted.  
 
 Ancient [[Egypt]] had sundials. Other [[culture]]s developed them further, including the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Romans]].
