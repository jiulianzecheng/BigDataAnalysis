 '''''Ouranosaurus''''' was a sail-backed, plant-eating, [[iguanodon]]tid [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period. It was about 24 feet (7 m) long and may have weighed about 4 tons. 
 
 Two almost complete ''Ouranosaurus'' fossils were found in the southern [[Sahara Desert]], in northeast [[Niger]], in 1966. ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', a large, sail-backed meat-eater, was one of its contemporaries in the hot, Cretaceous environment of [[north Africa]]. ''Ouranosaurus'' was named by the [[France|French]] [[Palaeontology|paleontologist]] Phillippe Taquet in 1976.
