 '''Vernalization''' is something [[plant|plants]] do when the weather is [[cold]].  Vernalization is when some plants only [[germination|sprout from seeds]] or grow flower [[bud]]s in the spring if they have spent enough days in the cold.  Some plants need colder temperatures than others.  For example, an apple tree that has not had a cold winter will not form good flowers the next year.  Some plants need more days of cold than others. [[Biennial]] and [[perennial]] plants (including [[poaceae]]) and some trees do this. < ref name=Ill > {{cite web|url=https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/garden-scoop/2015-01-09-vernalization-why-plants-need-winter|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=August 2, 2021|date=January 9, 2015|title='Vernalization' Why Plants Need Winter|author=Jenney Hanrahan}} < /ref >
