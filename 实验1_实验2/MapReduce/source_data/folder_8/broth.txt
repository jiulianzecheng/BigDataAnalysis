 In [[Britain]], a broth is a soup in which there are solid pieces of meat or [[fish]], with some [[vegetables]]. It is usually made with a stock or plain water as its base, with meat or fish added while being brought to a boil, and vegetables added later. Broth is often made more substantial by adding [[rice]], [[barley]] or [[pulses]]. < ref name= " LeithsTechniquesBible " > {{cite book|last=Spaull|first=Susan|author2=Lucinda Bruce-Gardyne|title=Leith's Techniques Bible|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 38 Soho Square, london W1D 3 HB|year=2003|pages=661|isbn=0-7475-6046-3}} < /ref > < ref name= " ScienceOfCooking " > {{cite book|last=Barham|first=Peter|title=The Science of Cooking|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencecooking00barh|publisher=Springer|location=Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg|year=2001|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sciencecooking00barh/page/n134 127]|isbn=3-540-67466-7}} < /ref >  Broth is distinct from [[Stock (food)|stock]], which is a thin liquid made by simmering raw ingredients until all the taste has been got, then sieving the resulting liquid. In Japan, other stuffs such as kelp, dried small sardines and katsuobushi are also used for Japanese dishes, too. 
 
 In the United States terms, broths are made from portions of meat, whereas stocks are made from vegetable scraps and bones.
