 A '''Zeppelin''' is a type of [[airship]]. Airships are aircraft that float in air, because they are filled with a lightweight [[gas]]. A Zeppelin is a [[Airship#dirigible|dirigible]], which means it is a [[wikt:rigid|rigid]] airship, but can be moved around by itself. It was developed by [[Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], in the early [[20th century]]. The name Zeppelin is now used as a common name for all rigid airships. Zeppelins were used in the [[First World War]]. In the [[Second World War]] the [[Nazi]]s largely used them for [[propaganda]] purposes. 
 
 One of the most well-known Zeppelins was the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]], which caught fire on [[May 6]], [[1937]], during a landing after a non-stop trip from [[Germany]] to [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States]].  After this, Zeppelin passenger service came to a stop.  The [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin]] was still in use, although some modifications had to be made.  Early the [[Second World War]] the remaining Zeppelins were demolished so their metal could be used for other things.  
 
 Plans have been proposed, to use Zeppelins to lift heavy weights.{{fact|date=September 2009}}  Some are used as [[Tourism|tourist]] attractions, or for [[advertisement|advertising]].
