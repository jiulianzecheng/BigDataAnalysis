 ==Etymology== 
 The English word ''samosa'' derives from Hindi/Urdu word '{{transl|hi|samosa}}',traceable to the [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] word {{transl|pal|sanbosag}} ({{lang-fa|{{nastaliq|سنبوسگ}}}}) or Sagosha means ([[triangle]]), and has the meaning of the  " triangular pastry " . 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Nimmatnama-i Nasiruddin-Shahi 283.jpg|thumb|Persian book [[Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi]] explain how the samosas being cooked]]  
 [[File:Sweets 1.jpg|thumb|[[Medieval India]]n Persian book [[Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi]] (16th century) showing samosas being served]] 
 The South Asian samosa has a [[Central Asian]] and/or [[Middle East|Middle Eastern]] origin. 
 ==Regional varieties== 
 
 === India === 
 The samosa is prepared with an [[all-purpose flour]] (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato (preferably diced), onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili.Samosas generally are deep-fried to a golden brown in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney (mint, coriander, or tamarind), or are served in ''chaat'', traditionally accompanied by yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Shingaras may be eaten as a tea time snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with [[potato]], [[peas]], [[onion]]s, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingaras or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is a popular variation.  
 
 Samosa is also an appetiser in [[Iran]]  and [[Pakistan]]. 
 
 It is commonly available in canteens, sweet shops and is also prepared at home. 
 
 Samosa can be [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or non-vegetarian. 
 
 ==Origins== 
 
 It is believed to have originated from the Central and West [[Asia]].  The word samosa originates from the Persian word sanbosag or Sagoshag means small triangle . < ref name= " Name Origin " > {{cite news|last=Duggal|first=Girija|title=Lovely triangles|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/333083.aspx|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=23 August 2008|archive-date=22 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022165222/http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print/333083.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
