 A '''chimney''' is a structure used to ventilate hot [[flue gas]]es  or  [[smoke]] from a [[boiler]], [[stove]], [[furnace]] or [[fireplace]] to the outside [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Most chimneys are vertical, or almost vertical, to make sure that the gases flow easily, drawing air into the [[combustion]] in what is known as the [[stack effect|stack, or chimney, effect]]. The space inside a chimney is called a ''[[flue]]''. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the [[United States]], the term '''smokestack'''  is also used when talking about [[Chimney (locomotive)|locomotive chimneys]] or [[Funnel (ship)|ship chimneys]], the word '''funnel''' can be used too. < ref > [http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/signatures/24h.htm C.F.

 The [[Height]] of a chimney is really important, when higher, chimney's dispersion of [[pollutants]] will not cause too much influence on surrounding areas. Tall chimneys also allow [[chemicals]] to self-neutralize in the air before they reach the ground.
