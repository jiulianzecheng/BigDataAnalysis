A '''fissure''' in [[geology]] is a crack in the [[Earth's crust]]. It is the first sign of the Earth's crust pulling apart. Characteristically, it is long and narrow. As the vent widens it may be called a fissure, and if there is [[volcanic activity]], then it is a fissure vent. A very good example is the [[rift valley]] in North-Eastern [[Africa]]. 
 
 [[Karst]] is vast areas of barren land with rocky ground. It is formed by dissolving soluble [[carbonate]] rocks such as [[limestone]], [[dolomite]], and [[gypsum]]. There may be caves, fissures, and [[sinkhole]]s. Despite rainfall, they lack vegetation, and usually have no lakes, rivers, or streams on their surface. They form when  [[limestone]], [[gypsum]], or [[dolomite]] are  dissolved by underground torrents of flowing water. 
 
 We now know that the huge karst area in [[Mexico]] known as the [[Yucat√°n Peninsula|Yucatan]] was formed by the meteorite which ended the [[Cretaceous period]]. The whole of this huge area is made of porous [[limestone]]. The limestone is regularly punctuated with holes or  " [[Cenote|cenotes]] " . The land is almost entirely covered with scrubby trees, all of a similar size. 
 
 A more familiar type of ground fissure is seen in [[Iceland]], where the fissure vent is an [[active volcano]]. In such places the fissure may pour out molten rock. [[Mauna Loa]] is another good example. In this case it is one of a number of volcanic islands formed by a hot-spot gradually moving across the [[Earth's mantle]].
