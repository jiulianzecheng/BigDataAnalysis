'''Ekphrasis''' is [[figure of speech]]. It is a detailed description of a work of [[visual art]]. The  work can be real or imaginary. Sometimes the language used in the ekphrasis is considered as art in itself. [[Homer]]'s detailed description of the [[shield]] carried by the hero [[Achilles]] in his  [[epic poem]] the ''[[Iliad]]'' is a very early example of the use of ekphrasis in [[literature]]. ''The Shield of Achilles'', a poem written by [[W. H. Auden]] in 1952, describes Auden's reaction to Homer's of ekphrasis. < ref > Mullan. John (14 November 2009).
