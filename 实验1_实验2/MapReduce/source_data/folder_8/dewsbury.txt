'''Dewsbury''' is a [[market town]] in the Metropolitan Borough of [[Kirklees]] in West Yorkshire. It is on the [[River Calder]]. A bit of the [[Calder and Hebble Navigation]] waterway goes there. It is to the west of [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]], east of [[Huddersfield]] and south of [[Leeds]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Calder  &  Hebble Navigation {{!}} Canal  &  River Trust|url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/enjoy-the-waterways/canal-and-river-network/calder-and-hebble-navigation|access-date=2023-04-09|website=canalrivertrust.org.uk|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 It was an important centre for [[wool]] milling.  They collected used woollen items,  mixed them with new wool and made heavy [[Blanket|blankets]] and [[Uniform|uniforms]]. 
 
 Dewsbury Minster is near the River Calder. Some of it was built in the 13th century.  The market was set up in the 14th century. 
 
 In 1770, a short branch of the Calder and Hebble Navigation reached the town.  That helped the mills because the boats could get to  to [[Manchester]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull.]] 
 
 The town now has a large Muslim community. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|date=2008-05-28|title=The name's Dewsbury|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/29/communities.pressandpublishing|access-date=2023-04-09|issn=0261-3077}} < /ref >
