 '''Treehouses''' are [[wikt:platform|platform]]s or [[building]]s built into a [[tree]]. They are [[Construction|constructed]] around, next to, or in mature trees. They are usually above [[ground]] [[level]]. Tree houses can be used for [[recreation]], [[work (physics)|work]] space or as an [[observation deck]]. A tree house can be a [[wikt:peaceful|peaceful]] quiet place for [[wikt:seclusion|seclusion]] or [[wikt:solitude|solitude]]. 
 
 ==Practical uses== 
 Treehouses are often built for [[children]] to play. < ref name=Harris6 > John Harris, ''Treehouses: View from the Top'' (Guilford, CT: Lyons Press, 2003), p. 6 < /ref >  They are a natural extension of children's love of climbing trees. < ref name=Harris6/ >  Treehouses can also be a casual retreat or working space, especially if provided with [[electricity]]. In many parts of the world guests can [[Renting|rent]] a treehouse. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://glampinghub.com/rentalsearch/tree-houses/ |title=Treehouses |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Glamping Hub |accessdate=4 May 2015}} < /ref >  They can also stay in a treehouse [[hotel]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-coolest-tree-house-hotels |title=World's Coolest Tree-House Hotels |author=Damon Tabor |date=12 April 2013 |website=Travel and Leisure |publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=4 May 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 Sometimes they are built for [[wikt:protection|protection]] against [[Wildlife|wild animals]]. In some parts of the [[tropics]], houses are either [[wikt:fasten|fasten]]ed to trees < ref > Lon Levin, ''Knack Treehouses'' (Guilford, CT: Morris Book Publishing, 2010), pp. 132–133 < /ref >  or [[Elevation|elevated]] on [[Stilt house|stilts]]. < ref > David Clark, ''Ultimate Treehouses'' (Philadelphia: Courage Books, 2003), p. 18 < /ref >  This is to keep the living quarters above the ground to protect occupants. A tree house can also be a place to store food from [[scavenger|scavenging]] animals. The [[Korowai people|Korowai]], a [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] tribe in the southeast of [[Irian Jaya]], live in tree houses. < ref name=Collins6 > Candida Collins, ''The Treehouse Book'' (New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing, 2009), p. 6 < /ref >  Some are nearly {{convert|40|m}} high (see image below). < ref name=Collins6/ >  They are used as protection against a tribe of neighbouring [[Headhunting|head-hunters]], the [[Citak]]. < ref > [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/03/980309043026.htm Head-Hunters Drove Papuan Tribe Into Tree-Houses] < /ref > 
 
 Tree houses are an option for building eco-friendly houses in remote forest areas. < ref name=Collins6/ >  They do not require a [[wikt:clearing|clearing]] of a certain area of forest. Because they are elevated or built into forested areas, they are not desirable to some people.
