 A '''trophy''' is an object given to someone because of an accomplishment. These are often given out through [[sporting event]]s.   
 
 A trophy can be in the shape of a [[cup]], a [[bowl]], a [[plaque]], a [[mug]] (these usually painted or engraved with something), a human shape (like the [[Emmy Award]]), or a [[spaceship]] (like the [[Hugo Award]] for science-fiction).   
 
 Trophies can also be an animal head. These are often taken as trophies by [[hunter]]s. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 In ancient times people would take heads or other body parts of enemies they had killed in a battle to show how good a warrior they were. 
 Many years ago (in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]) the [[winner]]s did not get any trophy, only a wreath (a wreath is made of flowers and looks like a crown). The winner also got [[olive oil]] in a [[container]] that was similar to today trophies. In local games, the winners got different trophies, such as a vase or a silver cup. 
 In [[ancient Rome]], the tradition of getting a trophy was slowly forgotten and [[money]] were given instead. 
 Trophies were introduced back in the world on large scale in last century. [[Football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[baseball]] trophies were introduced. 
 Today trophies are mostly made from [[plastic]] and are easily accessible to public thanks to low prices.
