 A '''necropolis''' (meaning “city of the dead”) is a large [[cemetery]] complex. One of the most famous necropolises is [[Giza Necropolis]] and that in [[Thebes, Egypt]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] is noted for multiple necropolises. 
 
 Necropolises are still there today. The [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramid complex]] is still in this world. You can go to this necropolis by flying from any country via an [[airplane]]. It is located in the [[desert]], which is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs. This complex is one of the [[Wonders of the World|wonders of the ancient world]].
