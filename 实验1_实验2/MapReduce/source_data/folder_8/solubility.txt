 '''Solubility''' is the ability of a substance (the [[solute]]), to mix into a liquid (the [[solvent]]). < ref > ''Atkins' Physical Chemistry'', 7th Ed. by Julio De Paula, P.W. Atkins {{ISBN|0-19-879285-9}} < /ref > 
 
 It measures the highest amount of substance mixed into a liquid solvent while they are both at equal amounts.   
 When the two mix together it is called a saturated [[solution]]. Certain substances can mix into any amount of a liquid solvent. An example of this is [[ethanol]] in [[water]]. This process is better described as  " miscible "  (the ability to mix with one another). Solubility does not depend on the size, in fact even the large particles will eventually all dissolve. 
 
 A solute is a substance that is dissolving in a solvent and is the smaller part of the solution. A solvent is the bigger part of a solution and is the substance that the solute dissolves in.
