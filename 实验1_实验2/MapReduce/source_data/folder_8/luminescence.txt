 '''Luminescence''' is [[light]] [[emission|emitted]] by a substance not caused by [[heat]]. In contrast, [[incandescence]] is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating. 
 
 Luminescence can be caused by [[chemical reaction]]s, [[electricity|electrical energy]], subatomic motions, or [[piezoelectricity]] (stress on a [[crystal]]).   The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann. < ref > E. Wiedemann (1888) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_D0bAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA446  " Über Fluorescenz und Phosphorescenz, I. Abhandlung " ] (On fluorescence and phosphorescence, first paper), ''Annalen der Physik'', '''34''': 446-463. p447 (transl.)  " For this second type of light excitation, for which we lack a consistent name, I would like to suggest the name of  " luminescence " , and call  " luminescing "  [any] bodies that glow in this way " . < /ref > < ref > Valeur, Bernard  &  Berberan-Santos, Mario N. 2011. A brief history of fluorescence and phosphorescence before the emergence of quantum theory. ''J. Chem. Educ''. '''88''' (6), pp 731–738 {{doi|10.1021/ed100182h}} < /ref > 
 
 The dials, hands, scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising'. 
 
 == Some types of luminescence == 
 *[[Chemiluminescence]], the making light from a [[chemical reaction]]. 
 **[[Bioluminescence]], emission as a result of [[biochemical]] reaction by a living organism 
 *[[Fluorescence]], emission after higher-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] is applied 
 *[[Phosphorescence]], same cause, but emission is delayed, lasting sometimes for hours 
 *[[Electroluminescence]]: [[Light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs)
