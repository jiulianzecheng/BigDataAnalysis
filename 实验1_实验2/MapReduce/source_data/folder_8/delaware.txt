 '''Delaware''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Delaware.ogg|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|w|ɛər}}) < ref > ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' < /ref >  is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. It is sometimes called the ''First State'' because it was the first [[thirteen colonies|colony]] to accept the new [[United States Constitution|constitution]] in 1787. < ref > [http://delaware.gov/topics/facts/gov.shtml About Delaware] < /ref >  Its capital is [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] and its biggest city is [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]. It is the second smallest state in the United States. 
 
 The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] first settled Delaware. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] then took over in the mid-1600s. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Delaware is {{convert|96|mi|km}} long and ranges from {{convert|9|mi}} to {{convert|35|mi|km}} across, totaling {{convert |1954|sqmi|km2}}, making it the second-smallest state in the United States after [[Rhode Island]]. Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]] and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]]. 
 
 ===Topography=== 
 Delaware is on a flat [[plain]], with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation. < ref name=census > {{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|page=216|title=Extreme and Mean Elevations by State and Other Area|work=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004–2005| publisher=United States Census Bureau| accessdate=March 16, 2011}} < /ref >  Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]], is less than {{convert|450|ft}} above sea level. < ref name=census/ > 
 
 ===Environment=== 
 The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and mixed [[Oak]] forests typical of the northeastern United States. < ref name= " ecoregions " > {{cite journal|author=Olson |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |url=http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |author2=D.

 ===Environmental management=== 
 Delaware provides [[Government subsidy|government subsidy support]] for the [[Environmental remediation|clean-up]] of property  " lightly contaminated "  by [[hazardous waste]]. The money for this cleanup comes from a tax on wholesale [[petroleum]] sales. < ref > {{cite news |title=Cleaning up contamination |first=Jeff |last=Montgomery |newspaper=[[The News Journal]] |publisher=Gannett |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110514/NEWS02/105140360/-1/NLETTER01/Cleaning-up-contamination |location=New Castle, Delaware |at=DelawareOnline |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ygBz8xTN?url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110514/NEWS02/105140360/-1/NLETTER01/Cleaning-up-contamination |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }} ''The first online page is archived; the page containing information related here is not in the archived version.'' < /ref >
