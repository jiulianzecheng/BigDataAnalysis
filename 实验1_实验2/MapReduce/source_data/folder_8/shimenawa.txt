 Shimenawa come in different sizes, ranging from a few centimeters to several meters in diameter, and are often adorned with [[shide]], which are traditional paper streamers. When a space is enclosed by shimenawa, it is considered sacred or ritually pure, such as in a [[Shinto shrine]]. < ref > Cf. Kasulis (2004:17-23). < /ref >  Shimenawa are believed to ward off [[evil]] spirits and are commonly used in [[Jichinsai]] before constructing new buildings. They are also commonly found at Shinto shrines, [[torii]] gates, and other sacred landmarks.
