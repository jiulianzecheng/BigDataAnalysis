 The '''Machairodontinae''' are a [[sister group]] of the felines ([[Felinae]]). They were the last surviving group of [[sabre{{ndash}}toothed cats]]. 
 
 They are an [[extinct]] [[subfamily]] of [[mammal]]ian [[carnivora]] of the family [[Felidae]] (true cats). They lived in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], and [[Europe]] from the [[Miocene]] to the [[Pleistocene]]. They survived from about 23 million until about 11,000 years ago. < ref > [http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?a=checkTaxonInfo & taxon_no=65494 & is_real_user=1 Paleobiology Database: ''Machairodontinae'' basic info]. < /ref > 
 
 The subfamily Machairodontinae included the famed [[genus]] ''[[Smilodon]]''. There were also other cats with [[Canine tooth|canines]] which were not so long, such as ''[[Homotherium]]''. The sabretooth [[adaptation]] evolved a number of times in different carnivore lines. They were evidently very successful as ambush predators. < ref name= " Fossils explained 52 " > Lars W. van den Hoek Ostende, Michael Morlo, Doris Nagel 2006.
