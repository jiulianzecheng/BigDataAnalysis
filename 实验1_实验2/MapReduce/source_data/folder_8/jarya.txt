{{Slavery}} 
 '''Jarya''' is the name for a certain type of [[Slavery|enslaved]] women and slave girls in the [[Islamic world]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Other names include  '''jariyah''' and '''jawaris.''' They were  " Slaves for pleasure "  (muṭʿa, ladhdha) or slave girls for [[sexual intercourse]] ((jawārī al-waṭ). They had received an artistic education. Unlike the [[Qiyan]], they usually did not perform outside the [[harem]] of their master.  
 
 Usually, Jarya were bought on the [[slave market]], or they were captured in a war as a form of [[wikt:booty|booty]]. They are mainly known because they were able to entertain a man with their artistic skills or their knowledge, rather than  sexuality and physical beauty. 
 
 Royal harems often employed  many jawaris, who acted as the entertainers of the royal harem and who were not necessarily the [[Concubinage|concubines]] of the ruler. < ref name= " El-Azhari2019 " > {{cite book|title=Queens, Eunuchs and Concubines in Islamic History, 661–1257|last1=El-Azhari|first1=Taef|date=2019|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-2318-2|jstor=10.3366/j.ctvnjbg3q}}{{pn|date=May 2022}} < /ref >  The [[Abbasid harem]] had thousands of jawaris as well as concubines < !-- who were not always the same-- > . < ref name= " El-Azhari2019 "  / >  The harems of many other Islamic rulers, did the same, < ref name= " El-Azhari2019 "  / >   such as the harems of the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]] and the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. < ref name= " El-Azhari2019 "  / > 
 
 In the  9th-century, writer [[Al-Jahiz]] described the sexual harem slaves. He also said that with their artistic skills they had a destructive influence over their owners. According to him, these skills created a web of dependent feelings such as love (hub), passion (hawa) affinity (mushakala) and a wish for continued companionship (ilf). < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bz7EDwAAQBAJ & pg=PA214|title=Pleasure and Leisure in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Age: Cultural-Historical Perspectives on Toys, Games, and Entertainment|last1=Classen|first1=Albrecht|date=2019|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-062307-9|page=214}} < /ref >
