 '''Hadrian''' (Publius Aelius Hadrianus, < ref > As emperor his name was ''Imperator Caesar Divi Traiani filius Traianus Hadrianus Augustus''. < /ref >  24 January 76 – 10 July 138) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 117 to 138. 
 
 He is well known for building [[Hadrian's Wall]], which marked the northern limit of Roman territory in [[Britain]]. In Rome, he built the [[Pantheon]], Castel Sant'Angelo (originally Hadrian's Tomb) and the [[Temple of Venus and Roma]]. < ref > Anthony Everitt 2009. ''Hadrian and the triumph of Rome''. Random House, N.Y. < /ref > 
 
 In addition to being emperor, Hadrian was a [[humanism|humanist]] and a lover of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture in all his tastes. Hadrian was the third of the so-called [[Five Good Emperors]]. < ref > Birley, Anthony R. 1997. ''Hadrian: the restless emperor''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-16544-X}}. < /ref > 
 
 Hadrian was born to a Hispano-Roman family, probably in [[Italica]] (near [[Seville]]). His predecessor [[Trajan]] was a maternal cousin of Hadrian's father. < ref > [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/text8.html Eutr. VIII. 6]:  " ...nam eum (Hadrianum) Traianus, quamquam consobrinae suae filium... "  and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html SHA, ''Vita Hadr''. I, 2]: ''...pater Aelius Hadrianus cognomento Afer fuit, consobrinus Traiani imperatoris.'' < /ref >  Trajan never officially designated an heir, but according to his wife [[Pompeia Plotina]], Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death. Trajan's wife and his friend [[Lucius Licinius Sura|Licinius Sura]] were well-disposed towards Hadrian, and he may well have owed his succession to them. < ref > After A.M. Canto, in [http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/ghi/02130181/articulos/GERI0303120305A.PDF UCM.es], specifically pp. 322, 328, 341 and footnote 124, where she stands out SHA, ''Vita Hadr.'' 1.2: ''pro filio habitus'' (years 93); 3.2: ''ad bellum Dacicum Traianum familiarius prosecutus est'' (year 101) or, principally, 3.7: ''quare adamante gemma quam Traianus a Nerva acceperat donatus ad spem successionis erectus est'' (year 107). < /ref > 
 
 During his reign, Hadrian traveled to nearly every province of the empire. Hadrian sought to make [[Athens]] the cultural capital of the empire: he ordered the construction of many temples in the city. 
 
 During his travels, Hadrian met a common-born young man named [[Antinous]], who became his favourite and probable lover. In 130, when travelling through Egypt and sailing on the Nile, Antinous drowned. Hadrian grieved his loss deeply, < ref > Historia Augusta (c. 395) Hadr. 14.5–7.  
 
 '' " During a journey on the Nile he lost Antinous, his favourite, and for this youth he wept like a woman. Concerning this incident there are varying rumours; for some claim that he had devoted himself to death for Hadrian, and others – what both his beauty and Hadrian's sensuality suggest. But however this may be, the Greeks deified him at Hadrian's request, and declared that oracles were given through his agency, but these, it is commonly asserted, were composed by Hadrian himself. " '' < /ref >  and did much to preserve his memory, including founding the city of Antinoöpolis and asking the Greeks to diefy Antinous.   
 
 Hadrian spent much of his time with the military. He usually wore military attire, and dined and slept amongst the soldiers. He ordered military training and drilling to be more rigorous and even made use of false reports of attack to keep the army alert. Despite his fondness for the army, there was little military activity throughout the empire while Hadrian reigned. After he became emperor, Hadrian withdrew from Trajan's conquests in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Armenia]], and even considered abandoning [[Dacia]]. Late in his reign, he stopped the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in [[Judea|Judaea]], renaming the province [[Syria Palaestina]]. 
 
 In 136 an ailing Hadrian adopted [[Lucius Aelius]] as his heir, but he died suddenly two years later. In 138, Hadrian promised to adopt [[Antoninus Pius]] if he would in turn adopt [[Marcus Aurelius]] and Aelius' son [[Lucius Verus]] as his own eventual successors. Antoninus agreed, and soon afterward Hadrian died at his villa near [[Tivoli|Tibur]].
