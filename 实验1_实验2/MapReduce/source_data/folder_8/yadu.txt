The [[Mahabharata]], the Harivamsha and the [[Purana]]s mention Yadu as the eldest son of king Yayati and his queen Devayani. The prince of King Yayati, Yadu was a self-respecting and a very established ruler. According to the Vishnu Purana, the Bhagavata Purana and the Garuda Purana Yadu had four sons, while according to the rest of the Puranas he had five sons. The names of his sons are: Sahasrajit (or Sahasrada), Kroshtu (or Kroshta), < ref name= " p1 " > Pargiter, F.E. (1972).

According to a narrative found in the [[Mahabharata]], and the Vishnu Purana, Yadu refused to exchange his years of youth with his father Yayati. So he was cursed by Yayati that none of Yadu's progeny shall possess the dominion under his father's command. < ref > Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996).

Notably, the only remaining dynasty of King Puru was entitled to be known as Somavamshi. Thereby King Yadu ordered that the future generations of his would be known as ''[[Yadav|Yadavs]]'' and the dynasty would be known as ''Yaduvamshi''. The generations of Yadu had an unprecedented growth and got divided into two branches.
