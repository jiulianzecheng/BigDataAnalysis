 '''Guosa''' is a [[constructed language]]. It was created by Alex Igbineweka in 1965. It was designed to be a combination of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] languages of [[Nigeria]] and to serve as a [[lingua franca]] to [[West Africa]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/guosa-the-lingua-franca-to-oust-english|title=Guosa: The lingua franca to oust English|last=Okafor|first=Judd-Leonard|date=20 March 2016|website=dailytrust.com.ng}} < /ref > 
 
 == Source languages == 
 Though Guosa draws its vocabulary from at least 118 native [[West Africa|West African]] languages, it gets most of its vocabulary from [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo language|Igbo]], either taken directly or made from a combination of words from these languages. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://nico.gov.ng/2016/03/17/hausa-igbo-and-yoruba-are-the-tripod-of-guosa-language-igbineweka/|title=Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba Are The Tripod of Guosa Language – Igbineweka|last=Dimgba|first=Njideka|date=17 March 2016|website=www.nico.gov.ng}} < /ref >  English also provides many of the more technical terms, either directly or through one of the African languages said before. Also, some words were produced a priori via sound symbolism, e.g. meeh  " sheep " , yanmu-yanmu  " mosquito " , and wuam  " eat " . 
 
 The different parts of speech came from particular languages. Most nouns come from Hausa, while verbs and abstracts come from Igbo or Yoruba. Also, words from all three source languages are often joined together to create a word that looks like all three. For example, the Guosa word méni  " what "  comes from Hausa ''menini'', Igbo ''gini'', and Yoruba ''kini'', all meaning  " what " . < ref > {{cite book|last=Igbinéwéká|first=Alexander|date=31 January 2019|title=The Complete Dictionary of Guosa Language 2nd Revised Edition|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-5320-6574-3}} < /ref >
