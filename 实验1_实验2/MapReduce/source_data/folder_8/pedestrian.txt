A '''pedestrian''' is a person traveling on foot, whether [[walking]] or [[running]].  In modern times, the term mostly refers to someone walking on a [[road]] or [[footpath]], but this was not the case historically. 
 
 ==History== 
 The main way humans [[movement|get around]] is by walking.  The first humans walked out of Africa about 60,000 years ago. We walked across India to reach Australia. We walked across Asia to reach the Americas.  We walked from the [[fertile crescent]] area to reach Europe.

 Nowadays, roads often have a designated footpath attached especially for pedestrian [[traffic]], called the ''[[sidewalk]]'' in [[American English]] and the ''pavement'' in [[British English]]. There are also footpaths not associated with a road which are used only by pedestrians, especially [[rambler]]s, [[hike]]rs or hill-walkers and there are roads not associated with a footpath. These footpaths, in mountains or forests, are called trails.

 Efforts are underway by pedestrian [[advocacy]] groups to make it easy to be a pedestrian in new developments, especially to counteract newer developments where 20 to 30 percent do not include sidewalks. Some activists advocate large [[auto-free zones]] where pedestrians only or pedestrians and some non-motorised vehicles are allowed.
