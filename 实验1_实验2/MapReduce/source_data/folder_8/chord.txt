[[File:PianoChord C.svg|thumb|C major chord on a piano]] 
 A '''chord''' in [[music]] is when two or more [[note (music)|notes]] are played together (some text books say that it is when ''three'' or more notes are played). 
 
 A chord which is built up of the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of a [[scale]] is called a  " tonic triad " . If it is made from a [[major scale]], it is a major chord. If it is made from a minor scale it is a minor chord. However, any combination of notes played simultaneously is considered a chord. 
 
 When only two notes are played together, it’s more often called “double stops” (referring to the different banks of pipes on a pipe organ, controlled by valves called “stops”). 
 
 Chords can be played on [[musical instrument|instruments]] such as [[piano]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[harp]], [[guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[ukulele]] and [[xylophone]]. Chords with two notes can be played on string instruments by [[bow (music)|bowing]] on two strings together. By bowing on two strings and then quickly on the other two strings a violinist can sound as if he is playing a four-part chord. Some players of wind instruments are able to make chords by playing two or more [[harmonics (music)|harmonics]] together.
