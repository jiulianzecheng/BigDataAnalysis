 '''OceanHero''' is a [[search engine]] focused on collecting plastics, mostly bottle [[waste]] in the oceans. < ref name= " globalgoodawards.co.uk " > {{cite web|url=http://globalgoodawards.co.uk/2021-global-good-awards-finalists/|title=2021 Global Good Awards Finalists|publisher=}} < /ref >  It has been certified by the [[United Nations]] (UN) Head of Marine and Freshwater Branch. < ref name= " globalgoodawards.co.uk " / > 
 
 OceanHero follows the model of a similar search engine, [[Ecosia]], which finances [[tree]] planting. It earns revenue like most other search engines by displaying ads on search results. The revenue generated from ads are then used to finance collecting plastic bottles from oceans located in Southeast Asia. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.getfoundquick.com/what-is-the-oceanhero-search-engine/|title=What is the OceanHero Search Engine?|date=13 December 2019|publisher=}} < /ref >  It can also be installed as a [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] extension. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://plasticbank.com/client/ocean-hero-today/|title=Ocean Hero teams with Plastic Bank to stop ocean plastic|date=25 November 2019|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 
 OceanHero uses a  " shell "  system for their searches. Users earn 20 shells from each search. For opening a tab, users earn 10 shells. Similarly, different colored shells occasionally pop up on the search engine, asking questions where users can earn shells.  Earning 100 shells is the equivalent of financing the recovery of 1 plastic bottle. Every recovered bottle is shown on a bottle counter.  
 
 Using OceanHero gives financial support to collect plastic from the oceans. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/national/saving-oceans-one-click-at-a-time-search-engine-lets-users-recover-sea-bound-plastic/ar-AAL3GJc|title=Saving oceans one click at a time: Search engine lets users recover sea-bound plastic|website=www.msn.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://blog.finfunmermaid.com/2020/04/28/oceanhero/|title=OceanHero: The Eco-Friendly Search Engine Thatâ€™s Making Waves|date=28 April 2020|publisher=}} < /ref > Many people who work for them are low income people who are paid the revenue from ads on search results.
