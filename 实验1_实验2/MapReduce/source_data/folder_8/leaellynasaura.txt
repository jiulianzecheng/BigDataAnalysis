 '''''Leaellynasaura''''' (meaning  " Leaellyn's lizard " ) was a fast-running, plant-eating [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[Australia]] during the middle [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous Period]], roughly 115-110 million years ago. Australia was within the Antarctic Circle during the Cretaceous period, and it had a very long [[winter]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Leaellynasaura'' is known from two nearly complete [[skeleton]]s and two [[skull]]s. It is described as an [[ornithopod]]. < ref > Federico L. Agnolin, MartÄ±n D. Ezcurra, Diego F. Pais and Steven W. Salisbury (2010).  " A reappraisal of the Cretaceous non-avian dinosaur faunas from Australia and 
 New Zealand: evidence for their Gondwanan affinities "  Journal of Systematic Palaeontology,  8 (2) [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/321503875-4656575/content~db=all~content=a922467212~tab=content~order=page] < /ref >  Unlike some other ornithischians, the ''Leaellynasaura'' did not have any tendons in its [[tail]]. The tail is known for being among the longest of its relatives: it was three times longer than the rest of the whole body. It also has more [[vertebrae]] in its tail than any other ornithischians except for some hadrosaurs. < ref name=herne2009 > Herne, M. (2009).
