'''Archezoa''' was a kingdom in [[taxonomy]], which is the system that scientists use to put living things in groups. Thomas Cavalier-Smith said taxonomy should have a kingdom called Archezoa, which would contain some [[eukaryotes|living things that have organelles in their cells]]. Scientists stopped using Archezoa after they learned more about those living things. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal|author=T.
