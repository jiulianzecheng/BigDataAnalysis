 A '''volunteer''' is someone who helps a common cause and who does not expect to get paid for it. There are many cases, such as cleaning up after a [[disaster]], where anyone can help. There are many cases, though, where the volunteers are trained specialists. Examples for these are the [[volunteer fire department]]s or a [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]] or [[nurse]] working for organisations such as the [[Red Cross]]. Another example are the people guiding police dogs, which may be trained for [[emergency rescue]].
