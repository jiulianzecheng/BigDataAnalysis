 '''Sodium''' is a [[chemical element]] with an [[atomic number]] of 11. Its symbol is '''Na''' (from its Latin name ''natrium''). It is an [[alkali metal]]. Although sodium has many [[isotope]]s, most decay in a short time. Because of this, all sodium in nature (mainly found in seawater) is of the isotope  < sub > 11 < /sub > Na < sup > 23 < /sup > . The [[atomic mass]] of sodium is 22.9898. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Sodium is a light-weight, silver-colored [[metal]]. Sodium is soft, and because of that, someone could easily cut it with a knife. When someone cuts it, the exposed part will become white over time. It reacts with air to form [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[sodium carbonate]]. Sodium is a little less [[Density|dense]] than water; when someone puts it in water, it floats and reacts instantly, producing [[hydrogen]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]. This reaction has a lot of heat, usually causing the hydrogen to light on fire. When this happens, sodium melts because of its low melting point. Sodium is highly reactive because it has one [[valence electron]], which is easily removed.   
 
 Compared with other [[Alkali metal|alkali metals]], sodium is less reactive than [[potassium]] and more reactive than [[lithium]]. < ref > {{cite web|author=De Leon, N.|title=Reactivity of Alkali Metals|url=http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/modern-atomic-theory/alkali-reac.html|publisher=[[Indiana University Northwest]]|accessdate=2007-12-07|archive-date=2018-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016113143/http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/modern-atomic-theory/alkali-reac.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 == Discovery and name origins == 
 Sodium was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy, an English scientist, in 1807. He created it by [[Electrolysis|electrolyzing]] sodium hydroxide. Davy named the element after soda, a name for sodium hydroxide or [[sodium carbonate]]. 
 == Use as element == 
 Scientists can use it in the creation of [[Organic compound|organic compounds]]. People also use it in orange streetlights and lamps that emit [[ultraviolet]] light. 
 == Use in compounds == 
 Sodium compounds are used in soaps, toothpaste, baking, and [[antacid]]s. 
 == Occurrence and production == 
 Sodium does not occur as an element in nature, because it is not stable enough. It exists only in [[chemical compound]]s. Sodium [[Ion|ions]] are found in the ocean and in the [[Earth's crust]].  
 
 Sodium is normally made by [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]], which is mined from the Earth's crust. 
 == Use in organisms == 
 The human body needs sodium ions, taken in the form of [[Table salt|sodium chloride]], to live, but too much of it can cause health problems. Many organisms in the ocean depend on the [[concentration]] of sodium ions in water to survive.
