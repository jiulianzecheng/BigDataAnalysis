 '''''Megalosaurus''''' was a large meat-eating [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] of the [[Middle Jurassic]] of [[Europe]]. It was found in 1824, and was the earliest dinosaur named. In 1827, [[Gideon Mantell]] included ''Megalosaurus'' in his [[geological]] survey of southeastern [[England]]. He gave the species its name, ''Megalosaurus bucklandii''. < ref name= " mantell1827 " > Mantell G. 1827. ''Illustrations of the geology of Sussex: a general view of the geological relations of the southeastern part of England, with figures and descriptions of the fossils of Tilgate Forest''. < /ref >   
 
 Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build. The first naturalists who investigated Megalosaurus thought it was a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842 [[Richard Owen]] concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs as a [[quadruped]].  
 
 Later it was realised that all [[theropods]] were [[bipedal]]. Today is known that the early proto-dinosaurs in the late [[Middle Triassic]] were also bipedal. Certainly ''[[Eoraptor]]'', from 231.4 million years ago, was bipedal. < ref name=SFRM93 > {{cite journal |last=Sereno P.C.
