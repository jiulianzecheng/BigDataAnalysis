'''Oneota''' is the name [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] have given to a [[Civilization|culture]]  found in North America. Oneota was mostly in what is now [[Wisconsin]] and neighboring states. It lasted from about AD 900 until about 1700. Archaeologists think Oneota became historic [[Macro-Siouan]] tribes such as the [[Ioway]]. A long-accepted ancestry to the [[Ho-chunk]] is not certain.
