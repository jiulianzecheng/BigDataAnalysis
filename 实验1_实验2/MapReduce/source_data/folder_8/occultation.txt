 An '''occultation''' is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer.  A [[planet]], for example, can pass in front of a [[star]].  Some occultations are [[eclipse]]s. The word is often used in [[astronomy]]. It can also be used in a non-astronomical sense to describe when an object in the foreground ''occults'' (covers up) objects in the background.
