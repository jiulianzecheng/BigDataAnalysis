 The '''Beagle''' is a [[dog breed|breed]] of small to medium-sized [[dog]]. It is a [[Hound]], and it has short legs and long, soft [[ear]]s. Beagles are mostly [[wikt:develop|developed]] for [[hunt]]ing and finding [[hare]], [[rabbit]], and other kinds of [[Game (food)|game]]. They can do this because they can [[Olfaction|smell]] well and have very quick [[instinct]]s. They are also popular as pets because of their good size, sweet temper, and [[health]]. Because of their character, beagles are often used for [[animal testing]].  
 
 Beagles can have [[coat (dog)|coats]] of different colours. Some variations can be three-coloured, orange, red, or lemon, although they are widely known for sporting the three-coloured look (Black, brown, and white). They usually have brown eyes. 
 
 Although beagle-type dogs have [[wikt:exist|existed]] for over 2,000 years, the [[modern]] kind came from [[Great Britain]] around the 1830s. 
 
 Beagles have been included in popular [[culture]] since the times when [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] began to rule, in literature and paintings, and more recently in movie, television and comic books. [[Snoopy]] of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'' has been picked as  " the world's most famous beagle " . < ref name= " mostfamousbeagle " > {{cite web|url=http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/places_to_visit/snoopy_parks_and_museums.html|title=Places to Visit|year=2005|publisher=United Feature Syndicate, Inc.|access-date=9 July 2007}} < /ref >

 Dogs that look almost the same as the modern Beagle can be traced in [[Ancient Greece]] < ref name= " dNSW " > " The Beagle Club of NSW (Australia) " , BeagleClubnsw.org.au,

 back to around the 5th century BC. In the ''Treatise on Hunting'' or ''Cynegeticus'', written by Xenophon, who said there was a [[hound]] that hunted hares by [[scent]] and was followed by foot. Small hounds were mentioned in the Forest Laws. < ref > Daglish p.7 < /ref >  If these laws were true, it would be enough proof that beagle-type dogs lived in England before 1016, but it is likely that the laws were written in the [[Middle Ages]] for tradition. < ref > Rackham p.130 < /ref >   
 
 [[Image:Southern Hound.jpg|thumb|left|The Southern Hound is thought to be an ancestor of the Beagle]] 
 In the 11th century, [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] brought the Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a white, slow hound. Once, English Talbots were crossed with [[Greyhound]]s to make them faster in running. < ref > Smith p.209 < /ref >  They are extinct now, but once they had made the Southern Hound more popular, which helped the Southern Hound descend to the Beagle. 
 
 From medieval times, ''beagle'' was used as a general description for small hounds, even though they are actually very different from the modern breed. Small breeds of beagle-type dogs were living even from the times of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Edward and Henry both had packs of Glove Beagles, who were named because of their small size. Also, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood {{convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=off}} at the shoulder. It was named so because it could fit in a  " pocket "  or saddlebag, when they rode along on the hunt. Elizabeth I called the dogs her ''singing beagles'' and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. < ref name= " J1858 " > Jesse (1858) pp.438â€“9 < /ref >  Ever since then, it is possible that the name was used to refer to the same kind of small hounds. In George Jesse's ''Researches into the History of the British Dog'' from 1866, Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the Beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the:
