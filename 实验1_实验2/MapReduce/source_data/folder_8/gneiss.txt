 '''Gneiss''' is a type of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. The [[mineral]]s in gneiss may come from rocks which were originally either [[igneous]] or [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]]. They were heated and squeezed, and the minerals recrystallized. < ref > Blatt, Harvey, Robert J. Tracy  &  Ernest G Ehlers 1996. ''Petrology : igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic''. Freeman, New York. < /ref > 
 
 '''Orthogneiss''' is gneiss got from igneous rock (such as [[granite]]). '''Paragneiss''' is gneiss got from sedimentary rock (such as [[sandstone]]). 
 
 In gneisses, minerals tend to be foliated: layered and segregated into bands. Thus there are seams of [[quartz]] and of [[mica]] in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral. 
 
 == Lewisian gneiss == 
 The [[Lewisian complex]] or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of [[Precambrian]] [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of [[Scotland]], forming part of the [[Hebridean Terrane]]. These rocks are of [[Archaean]] and [[Palaeoproterozoic]] age, ranging from 3.0â€“1.7 Ga. < ref > Ga = thousands of millions of years ago; so 1.7 Ga = 1,700,000,000 years ago < /ref >
