 {{nihongo|'''''Oiran'''''|花魁}} were [[courtesans]] in [[Japan]]. Oiran were part of Japanese society during the [[History of Japan#Edo period|Edo period]], (1600–1868). [[Prostitution]] was legal then, but only in special [[neighborhood]]s that were closed to outsiders. There were different kinds of oiran, depending on their [[beauty]], [[skill]]s in art, education, and more. High-ranking oiran were called {{nihongo|'''''tayū'''''|太夫}}. Only [[nobility|nobles]] could be with one. Tayū had many [[servant]]s, and when they went outside, their servants carried them and followed them, making a [[procession]]. They wore very [[expensive]] [[clothing|clothes]] and [[jewelry]]. Any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult [[ritual]]s and [[etiquette]]. 
 
 [[Geisha]] replaced oiran. Geisha practiced common types of [[entertainment]] enjoyed by the people of that time. They became more popular than oiran. The last known oiran was in 1761. A few women still practice the arts of the oiran today (without sex) to continue the [[culture|cultural]] heritage.
