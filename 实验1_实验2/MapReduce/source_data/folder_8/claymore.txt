 The '''claymore''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[sword]]. It has two sharp edges. The word claymore is from [[Gaelic]]. It means “great sword”. < ref > " claymore " . ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 1989. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041118?single=1 & query_type=word & queryword=claymore & first=1 & max_to_show=10] (subscription required) < /ref >  The sword is held with two hands. In some sources the broad claymore sword is called “claidheamh da lamh”, which means “two-hand sword”. It was very popular in the [[16th century]] when Scottish warriors ([[highlander]]s) used it against the Englishmen. 
 
 The average claymore was about {{convert|55|in|m|lk=on|abbr=off}} long. The blade was about {{convert|42|in|m|lk=on|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} long. It weighed around {{convert|5.5|lb|kg|lk=on|abbr=off}}. < ref > Wagner, Paul  &  Thompson, Christopher,  " The words claymore and broadsword "  in Hand, Stephen, ''Spada II: Anthology of Swordsmanship'' (Chivalry Bookshelf, 2005) < /ref >  It had a very wide blade. Many claymore blades had a small amount of metal cut out of them. This was done to make the sword weigh less. 
 
 There was also a type of claymore that had one sharp edge and a basket-shaped handle. The basket of the handle was used to protect the hands. The basket was also used to help with [[Equilibrioception|balance]]. This was because the blade was very long. Many claymores were made during the mid-[[1600]]s.  
 
 People in Europe started using swords with two hands in the 14th century. < ref > ''Swords and Sabres'', Harvey J S Withers < /ref >  The biggest European swords were made in the early 16th century. They were usually used by bodyguards or soldiers for defending from [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]] and [[Polearm|polearms]]. One example of these kinds of swords is the [[Germany|Germanic]] [[Zweihänder]] (two-handed) sword.
