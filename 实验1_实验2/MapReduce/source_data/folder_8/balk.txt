A  '''balk''' is something that a pitcher does in [[baseball]] that is not allowed, or illegal. If a balk happens the umpire will point to the pitcher and yell  " balk " , and the runners on base get to move up one base. If there are no runners on base, a ball is issued to the [[Batting (baseball)|batter]]. 
 
 Some ways a balk can happen include; 
 
 * The [[Pitcher (baseball)|pitcher]] faking a pitch 
 * The pitcher throwing the ball to a base where there is no runner 
 * Pitching the ball before everyone is ready 
 * The pitcher takes too long to pitch 
 * If the pitcher drops the ball, even if he didn't mean to. 
 
 There are other ways it can happen, but these are the main ones.
