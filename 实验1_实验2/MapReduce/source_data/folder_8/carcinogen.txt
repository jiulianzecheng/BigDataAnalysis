 '''Carcinogens''' are [[substance]]s that cause [[cancer]]. Sometimes [[radiation]] or [[radionuclide]] are also considered carcinogens. A common example of a carcinogen is [[tobacco]] smoke.  Carcinogens come from both natural and man-made substances. < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00194-3 | title = Paracelsus to parascience: The environmental cancer distraction | year = 2000 | last1 = Ames | first1 = Bruce N | last2 = Gold | first2 = Lois Swirsky | journal = Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis | volume = 447 | issue = 1 | pages = 3â€“13| pmid = 10686303 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Carcinogens in radiation== 
 Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens. The carcinogens in them are caused by the radiation they release, such as [[gamma ray]]s or [[alpha particle]]s.  
 
 [[CERCLA]] says that all radionuclides are carcinogens. How much of a carcinogen a radiation is depends on the type of radiation, the type of exposure to it and its penetration. For example, alpha radiation has low penetration and is not a danger outside the body. Alpha radiation is a carcinogen when breathed in or eaten. 
 
 [[Thorotrast]], previously used in [[x-ray]]s, is a human carcinogen. [[Marie Curie]], one of the pioneers of radioactivity, died of a cancer that was caused by the radiation she was exposed to during her experiments. 
 
 Not all types of electromagnetic radiation are carcinogenic. [[Radio wave]]s, [[microwave|microwave radiation]], [[infrared radiation]], and [[visible light]] are examples of this. Higher-energy radiation, including [[ultraviolet radiation]], usually ''is'' carcinogenic, if a person is exposed to it long enough. 
 
 ==Carcinogens in food== 
 Recent research has shown that when food is cooked at high temperatures, carcinogens may be formed in very small amounts. < ref > Wei Zheng, Deborah R Gustafson, Rashmi Sinha, James R Cerhan, ''et al.''  " Well-done meat intake and the risk of breast cancer. "  ''Journal of the National Cancer Institute''. Oxford: Nov 18, 1998.Vol. 90, Iss. 22; pg. 1724, 6 pgs. < /ref >  Pre-cooking meats in a [[microwave oven]] for 2-3 minutes before broiling shortens the time on the hot pan. This could help stop the carcinogens from being made. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=National Cancer Institute, 2004 analysis and recommendations |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2010-09-22}} < /ref >  Certain kinds of foods, like [[crisps|potato chips]] and [[French fried potatoes|French fries]], may have higher levels of carcinogens than others. < ref > {{cite web |title=Acrylamide |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/acrylamide_branch/ |access-date=2007-12-26 |archive-date=2012-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305164733/http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/acrylamide_branch/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The charred residue on [[barbecue]]d meats is a carcinogen, too. 
 
 This does not mean eating cooked foods is dangerous. The gastrointestinal tract sheds its outer layer continuously to protect itself from [[carcinoma]]s. Because of this, it has a good chance of shedding bad enzymes that could cause cancer.
