 '''''Mycoplasma''''' is a [[genus]] of [[bacteria]]. They do not have a [[cell wall]] around their [[cell membrane]]. < ref name= " Sherris " > {{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry/page/n426 409]–12}} < /ref >   
 They are [[gram-negative]], and need [[sterol]]s such as [[cholesterol]] for growth. Many common [[antibiotics]] such as [[penicillin]] that target cell walls do not affect mycoplasma. ''Mycoplasma'' are the smallest bacterial cells yet discovered. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Cu‐Uvin|first=Susan|date=April 2010|editor-last=Sweet|editor-first=Richard L.|editor2-last=Gibbs|editor2-first=Ronald S.|title=Book Review Infectious Diseases of the Female Genital Tract, Fifth Edition Edited by Richard L.

 Many species are [[parasitic]], [[pathogen]]ic or [[saprophyte|saprophytic]], and can survive without [[oxygen]]. In humans, ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium|M. genitalium]]'' causes [[urethra|urethritis]], and ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae|M. pneumoniae]]'' is a common cause of [[pneumonia]]. Some live as saprophytes but the majority are parasites of plants and animals. The parasitic nature is due to the inability of mycoplasmal bacteria to synthesise the required growth factor.
