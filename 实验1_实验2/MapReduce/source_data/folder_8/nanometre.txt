 The '''nanometre''' (symbol: '''nm''') is a [[units of measurement|unit]] used to [[Measurement|measure]] [[length]] in the [[metric system]]. It is equal to one [[1000000000 (number)|billionth]] of a [[metre]] ({{nowrap|1 m / 1,000,000,000}}) and for [[kilometre]], it is equal to one [[Trillion|trillionth]] of a kilometre (1 km / 1,000,000,000,000). The name combines the [[SI prefix]] ''nano-'' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|νάνος}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|nanos}}'',  " dwarf " ) with the parent unit name ''metre'' (from Greek {{lang|grc|μέτρον}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|metrοn}}'',  " unit of measurement " ). It can be written in [[scientific notation]] as 1 & times;10 < sup > & minus;9 < /sup > & nbsp;m. 
 
 The nanometre is often used to express very tiny [[dimension]]s, such as measuring [[atom]]s. The nanometre is also commonly used to measure the [[wavelength]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] that can be seen by humans. [[Visible light]] ranges from around 400 to 800 & nbsp;nm. < ref > Hewakuruppu, Y., et al., ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069746_Plasmonic__pump__probe__method_to_study_semi-transparent_nanofluids?ev=prf_pub Plasmonic “ pump – probe ” method to study semi-transparent nanofluids]'', Applied Optics, 52(24):6041-6050 < /ref > 
 
 The nanometre was formerly called the '''millimicrometre''' (or the '''millimicron'''). This is because it is 1/1000 of a [[micrometre]], and was written with the symbol '''mµ''' (or sometimes '''µµ'''). < ref > {{Cite journal |first1=The |last1=Svedberg |first2=J.
