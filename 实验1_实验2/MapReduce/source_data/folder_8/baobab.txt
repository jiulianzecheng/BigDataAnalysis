 '''Baobab''' is the common name of a [[genus]] of [[trees]] ('''''Adansonia'''''). There are a total of eight types of its kind: six species live in the drier parts of [[Madagascar]], two in mainland [[Africa]], one in [[Australia]] and three in [[India]]. It is the national tree of Madagascar. 
 
 == Other names == 
 Other common names include 'boab', 'boaboa', 'bottle tree', 'the tree of life', 'upside-down tree', and 'monkey bread tree'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 meters (16 to 98 & nbsp;ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 meters (23 to 36 & nbsp;ft.). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 liters of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air. 
 
 == Medicinal uses == 
 Baobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow, as they are able to provide shelter and wood. The leaves of the tree are used for making soup and the tree has some medicinal purposes in some regions of Africa < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Medicinal-Use-of-Baobab-Fruits-Seeds-and-Leaves-Documented-in-Literature_tbl2_51610244|title=TABLE 2 Medicinal Use of Baobab Fruits, Seeds, and Leaves Documented in...|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2020-08-08}} < /ref >  for treating ailments such as wounds, diarrhea, asthma, fever, and malaria.

 == Long life of baobab tree == 
 The trees are long-lived, but just how long is disputed. The owners of Sunland Farm in [[Limpopo]], [[South Africa]] have built a [[pub]] called  " The Big Baobab Pub "  inside the hollow trunk of the {{convert|22|m|ft}} high tree.  The tree is 47 & nbsp;m (155 & nbsp;ft) in circumference, and is said to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old. < ref > [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-503404/Fancy-pint-worlds-bar-thats-INSIDE-tree.html Fancy a pint in the world's only bar that's INSIDE a tree?, Daily Mail, December 2007] Retrieved 27 August 2012 < /ref > 
 
 == Other uses == 
 The baobab tree is known as the tree of life, with good reason. It can provide shelter, clothing, food, and water for the animal and human inhabitants of the African [[savannah]] regions. The cork-like bark and huge stem are fire resistant and are used for making cloth and rope. The leaves are used as condiments and medicines. The fruit, called  " monkey bread " , is edible, and full of [[vitamin C]]. < ref name=biov > {{Cite web|url=http://news.bioversityinternational.org/index.php?itemid=1166|title=Scientists predict African fruit trees could help solve major public health problem|access-date=2008-10-01|publisher=Bioversity International|archive-date=2007-08-13|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070813225151/http://news.bioversityinternational.org/index.php?itemid=1166|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > Hills S.

 The fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a [[coconut]], weighing about {{convert|1.44|kg}}. It has a somewhat acidic [[flavour]], described as 'somewhere between grapefruit, pear, and vanilla'. < ref name=natgeo/ > 
 
 The tree can store hundreds of liters of water, which is an [[adaptation]] to the harsh [[drought]] conditions of its [[environment]]. The tree may be tapped in dry periods. < ref > {{Cite web| title= The Baobab tree in Senegal| url= http://www.senegal-online.com/anglais/parcs-faune-flore/baobab.htm| access-date= 2008-10-01| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081004233417/http://www.senegal-online.com/anglais/parcs-faune-flore/baobab.htm| archive-date= 2008-10-04| url-status= dead}} < /ref >
