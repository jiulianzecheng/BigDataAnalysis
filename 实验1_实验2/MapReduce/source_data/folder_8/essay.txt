An '''essay''' is a written [[text]]. It is usually about the personal point of view of the author who wrote it. The definition of an essay is vague.  [[wikt:article|Articles]] and [[short story|short stories]] can be quite similar.  Almost all modern essays are written in [[prose]], but works in [[Poetry|verse]] have been called essays (e.g. [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''An Essay on Criticism'' and ''An Essay on Man''). People that write essays are called essayists. 
 
 Most essays are short. This does not have to be the case. [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and [[Thomas Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' are long essays. 
 
 Essays can have all sorts of purposes. For example, an essay can be very argumentative, it can talk about points for and against the essay question to give a balanced argument or opinion. Essay must be essential and give some new points about topics. Its must be useful to readers.

 == Argumentative Essay == 
 The argumentative essay is a genre of writing that requires the student to investigate a topic; collect, generate, and evaluate evidence; and establish a position on the topic in a concise manner. The structure of the argumentative essay is held together by coherence, logical arguments, evidential support, and a conclusion.   Some examples of argument essay topics are 'Is polygamy evil or not?', 'Are US elections always fair?' 
 
 == Thesis Essay == 
 This is a genre of essay where a stance is presented in an essay using a thesis statement. A thesis statement is one or more sentence that expresses the main idea of a research paper or essay, such as an expository essay or argumentative essay. It makes a claim, directly answering a question. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://writinkservices.com/thesis-writing/|title=Thesis Writing|website=YourDictionary|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}} < /ref >  The thesis statement serves as a guide for the readers throughout the whole entire essay.
