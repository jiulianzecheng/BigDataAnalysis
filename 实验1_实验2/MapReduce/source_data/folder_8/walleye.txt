 '''Walleye'''  (''Sander vitreus'') is a freshwater [[perciform]] [[fish]] native to most of [[Canada]] and to the northern [[United States]].  
 
 It is a [[North American]] close relative of the [[Europe]]an [[Zander|pikeperch]].  
 
 The walleye is sometimes also called the '''yellow walleye''' to distinguish it from the [[blue walleye]], which is an extinct subspecies formerly found in the southern [[Great Lakes]].
