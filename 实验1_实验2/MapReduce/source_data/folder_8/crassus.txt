 '''Marcus Licinius Crassus''' (c. 115 BC – 53 BC) was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[General officer|general]] and [[politician]]. 
 
 He commanded the left wing of [[Sulla]]'s army at the [[Battle of the Colline Gate]]. It was he who finally  suppressed the slave revolt led by [[Spartacus]]. The [[Third Servile War]] began with three defeats of Roman armies against Spartacus and his followers. The revolt was finally destroyed by the concentrated military effort of a single commander, Marcus Licinius Crassus. 
 
 The last stage of his career was as a ''triumvir'', one of the [[First Triumvirate]], with Gnaeus [[Pompey|Pompeius Magnus]] and Gaius [[Julius Caesar]]. One of the richest men of the era, he was killed after a defeat at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. His death led to the civil wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey, the other two triumvirs. 
 
 == Brutal discipline == 
 Crassus formed an army to meet the Parthians. In addition to six new [[Roman legion|legions]], he was given other legions which had been beaten by Spartacus. He [[Decimation|decimated]] them. This was the brutal method of [[execution|executing]] ''one man in ten'' to encourage the others to fight harder. Each group of ten men drew [[Lottery|lots]] to decide who would die. This punishment had not been used since the early days of Rome. 
 
 Crassus's punishment of Spartacus's surviving men was just as brutal. They were [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. But his army was beaten by the Parthians, with many Roman deaths, including that of Crassus. 
 
 == Battle of Carrhae == 
 Crassus arranged to govern the [[Roman province]] of [[Syria]], with the transparent intention of going to war with Parthia. In fact, he set out on a war against [[Parthia]], using his own money, and without the Senate's official approval. < ref > This political overview comes mainly from Erich S. Gruen 1969.

 After being informed of the presence of the Parthian army, Crassus panicked. His general [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] recommended that the army be deployed in the traditional Roman fashion, with infantry forming the center and [[cavalry]] on the wings. At first Crassus agreed, but he soon changed his mind and redeployed his men into a hollow [[Square (geometry)|square]], each side formed by twelve [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]. < ref > Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus'', 23.3 < /ref >  This formation would protect his forces from being outflanked, but at the cost of mobility. 
 
 The day went badly for the Romans, who were repeatedly outflanked by the Parthian cavalry. The next day they received a message, offering to negotiate with Crassus. A truce was proposed, allowing the Roman army to return to Syria safely, in exchange for Rome giving up all territory east of the [[Euphrates]]. < ref > Dio, Cassius. ''Roman History: Book 40'', 26.1. < /ref >  Crassus was reluctant to meet with the Parthians, but his troops threatened to mutiny if he did not. < ref > Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus'', 30.5. < /ref >  At the meeting, a Parthian pulled at Crassus' reins, sparking violence. Crassus and his generals were murdered. After his death, the Parthians allegedly poured molten gold down his throat, in a symbolic gesture mocking Crassus' renowned greed. < ref > Dio, Cassius. ''Roman History: Book 40'', 26.3. < /ref >  The remaining Romans at Carrhae attempted to flee, but most were captured or killed. Roman casualties amounted to about 20,000 killed and 10,000 captured, < ref > Plutarch. ''Life of Crassus'', 31.7. < /ref >  making the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history. Parthian casualties were minimal.
