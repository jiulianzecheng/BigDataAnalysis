 '''Psychoanalysis''' is a [[field of study|field]] of [[psychology]] and [[therapy|medical therapy]]. It is a set of [[theories]] and ways of treating [[mental disorder]]s. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist [[Sigmund Freud]], < ref > Freud S. 1940. ''An outline of psychoanalysis''. (The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud, volume XXIII) < /ref >  with experience from the clinical work of [[Josef Breuer]] and others. 
 
 Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as [[Alfred Adler]] and [[Carl Jung]], had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, [[Anna Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein]] used the ideas to treat troubled children. 
 
 The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are: < ref > Freud, Sigmund 1922. ''Introductory lectures on psycho-analysis: a course of twenty-eight lectures delivered at eh University of Vienna''. Authorised English translation by Joan Riviere with a Preface by Ernest Jones. London: Allen  &  Unwin. < /ref > 
 # besides inherited [[personality]], a person's development is determined by events in early childhood; 
 # human behavior, experience, and thought is largely influenced by [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] irrational [[drive (psychology)|drives]]; 
 # attempts to bring these drives into awareness is resisted by [[defence mechanism]]s; 
 # conflicts between conscious and unconscious (repressed) material can result in mental disturbances such as [[neurosis]], neurotic traits, [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], etc.; 
 # liberation from the effects of the unconscious material is achieved by bringing this material into the conscious mind (e.g. by the skilled guidance of the analyst. < ref > Erich Fromm 1992. ''The revision of psychoanalysis'', p13/14. < /ref > 
 
 == The unconscious mind == 
 Sometimes people cannot say why they are feeling the way they feel or acting the way they act. What causes the feelings and actions is called the [[unconscious mind]] in psychodynamic theory. 
 
 == Different methods == 
 Under the broad umbrella of  " psychoanalysis "  there are at least 22 different approaches to the theory and clinical treatment. The term also refers to a method of studying [[child development]]. 
 
 Freudian psychoanalysis uses a type of treatment where the subject (analytic patient) talks, including [[free association]]s, [[Fantasy|fantasies]], and [[dream]]s. < ref > Freud, Sigmend. 1913. ''The interpretation of dreams''. Authorised translation of third edition with introduction by A.A. Brill. London: George Allen. < /ref >  From these the analyst works out the unconscious conflicts which cause the patient's symptoms and character problems. By interpreting them for the patient, the analyst creates [[insight]] into the problems. The analyst identifies and clarifies the patient's pathological [[defence mechanism|defences]], wishes and [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. 
 
 Psychoanalysis has been criticized on many fronts. It has been called a [[pseudoscience]], and lacking in [[empiricism|empirical]] support. < ref > Fisher, Seymour, Greenberg Roger P. 1996.
