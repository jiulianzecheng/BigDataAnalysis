 '''Pedipalps''' are the two [[appendage]]s on the front of a [[spider]]'s head. Other [[arachnid]]s, and [[chelicerate]]s that are not arachnids also have pedipalps. Some spiders seem to have ten [[leg]]s and not eight, because these pedipalps look like an extra pair of legs. The pedipalps are used rather like [[arm]]s.  Spiders often use them to hold [[insects]] (for example [[cricket]]s) for them to eat. 
 
 [[Male]] spiders also use pedipalps for [[mating]].  The male spiders make some [[silk]], put [[sperm]] onto the silk, and then put their pedipalps into the sperm.  The pedipalps then hold the sperm, and the spider can use it to mate with a [[female]] by putting them inside her [[epigynum]]. 
 
 == Diversity of pedipalps == 
 The pedipalps of all chelicerates vary: [[Ricinulei]], [[Thelyphonida]], [[Amblypygi]], some [[Opiliones]], [[Schizomida]], [[scorpion]]s and [[pseudoscorpion]]s all have theirs as pincers, with the Amblypygi's being their entire pedipalps shaped like mantids. The [[Palpigradi]]'s pedipalps have some of the strangest roles of arachnids as they use theirs for locomotion. The pedipalps of [[Solifugae]] act as [[antenna (biology)|antenna]]e.
