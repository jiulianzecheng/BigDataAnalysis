 A '''meow''' or '''miaow''' is a [[noise]] made by [[cat]]s. There are different types of meows, such as ones that mean the same thing as  " [[hello]], "  ones that ask for [[food]], or ones that let people know when they are annoyed, among other things. 
 
 The meow is used by [[kitten]]s to their mother. It is a plea for attention, and experts think pet cats use it because they often need owners to do things for them. Adult cats do not meow to other cats. < ref name= " ASPCA " > {{cite web |title=Meowing and yowling |url=http://www.aspca.org/Pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-articles/meowing-and-yowling |work=Virtual Pet Behaviorist |publisher=ASPCA |accessdate=28 May 2012 }} < /ref >
