 '''Arameans''', also known as '''Syriacs''' are a predominantly Syriac Christian [[ethnic group]] whose origins remain in what is today [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]] and fled to [[Western Europe]], [[North America]] and the [[Caucasus]] due persecution over the past centuries. The Arameans speak Aramaic which once was the language of the whole [[Middle East]]. 
 
 Their culture has survived for thousands of years despite efforts by their Arab, Turkish and Kurdish neighbors to demolish it: it remains a strong influence on their way of life.  
 Today there are about 3-5 million Arameans worldwide with the majority living in the diaspora.
