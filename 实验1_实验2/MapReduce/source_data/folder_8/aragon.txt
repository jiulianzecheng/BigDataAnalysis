 '''Aragon''' is an [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] in the northeast of [[Spain]]. In the various dialects of Spain it is: in {{lang-an|Aragón}}; in {{lang-es|Aragón}}; in {{lang-ca|Aragó}}. 
 
 Aragon covers the area of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Kingdom of Aragon]]. It is named after the [[Aragón (river)|Aragón]] river, a tributary of the [[Ebro]]. 
 
 Aragon has three [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] (from north to south): [[Province of Huesca|Huesca]], [[Province of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] and [[Province of Teruel|Teruel]]. Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] is [[Zaragoza]] (sometimes called ''Saragossa'' in English). 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Aragon is one of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities. It has a surface area of {{convert|47719|km2|sqmi}}, 9.4 percent of the territory of Spain. < ref name= " basicos " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.aragon.es/estaticos/GobiernoAragon/Organismos/InstitutoAragonesEstadistica/Documentos/docs/Areas/DatosBasic/2011_Actualizados/DBA_Wb.pdf |title=Datos básicos de Aragón - Territorio |publisher=Instituto Aragonés de Estadística |language=es |access-date=10 April 2014 |archive-date=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825221736/http://www.aragon.es/estaticos/GobiernoAragon/Organismos/InstitutoAragonesEstadistica/Documentos/docs/Areas/DatosBasic/2011_Actualizados/DBA_Wb.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  By [[Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities by area|area]], it is the fourth largest Spanish autonomous community after [[Castile and León]], [[Andalusia]] and [[Castile-La Mancha]]. 
 
 Aragon is bordered to the north by [[France]] ([[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] [[Regions of France|region]]). Within Spain, the community is bordered to the east by [[Catalonia]] ([[Lerida Province|Lerida]] and [[Tarragona Province|Tarragona]] [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]]), to the south by [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Castellón Province|Castellón]] and [[Valencia Province|Valencia]] provinces) and [[Castile-La Mancha]] ([[Cuenca Province|Cuenca]] and [[Guadalajara Province|Guadalajara]] provinces), and to the west by [[Castile and León]] ([[Soria Province|Soria]] province), [[La Rioja]] and [[Navarre]]. 
 
 ===Relief=== 
 Most of Aragon has an [[altitude]] of {{Convert|201|-|3,404|m|ft|0|abbr=on }}. The highest point is the [[Aneto]] peak with {{Convert|3404|m|ft|0|abbr=on }} high; < ref name= " basicos "  / >  it is the highest mountain of the [[Pyrenees]]. 
 
 The lowest point in Aragon is on the Ebro river, close to Zaragoza, with an altitude of {{Convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on }} high. < ref name= " basicos "  / > 
 
 The three main [[Geography|geographical]] regions of Aragon are: 
 # The '''Aragonese [[Pyrenees]]''' has the highest points of this [[Mountain range|range]] that separates Spain from France. The main mountains are [[Aneto]] (3,404 m), the highest in the range, [[Posets Peak]] (3,375 m), [[Monte Perdido]] (3,355 m), [[Perdiguero]] (3,222 m), [[Cotiella]] (2,912 m), among others. The main [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] [[valley]]s, formed by the rivers that are born there, are Ansó (Veral river), Hecho (Aragon Subordán river), Canfranc ([[Aragón (river)|Aragón]] river), Tena (Gállego river) and Broto-Ainsa-Benasque (Ara, Cinca and Ésera rivers). The [[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] lies above these valleys. 
 # Further south, the '''Ebro valley''', irrigated by the Ebro river, is a rich and fertile [[Agriculture|agricultural]] area covered with vast fields of [[wheat]], [[barley]] and other [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]] [[crop]]s. Many beautiful and little-known [[settlement]]s, [[castle]]s and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ruins are found here. 
 # South of Zaragoza and the Ebro valley, the elevation rises again into the '''[[Sistema Ibérico]]''', a complex system of mountain ranges that separates the Ebro valley from the [[Meseta Central]] and [[plain]]s of [[Castile-La Mancha]]. The highest mountain in this range is the [[Moncayo]] with {{Convert|2314|m|ft|0|abbr=on }}. 
 
 ===Rivers=== 
 Most of the Aragonese rivers are [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the Ebro, Spain's largest river in volume and which divides Aragon into two. Some important tributaries on the left side of the river (rivers that come from the Pyrenees) are the [[Aragón (river)|Aragón]], born in Huesca but flows into the community of Navarre, the Gállego and Cinca, which joins the Segre just before ending up in the Ebro. Right tributaries are the rivers Jalón, Huerva and Guadalupe. 
 
 On the Ebro, near the border with Catalonia, lies the Mequinenza [[Reservoir]], with a length of about 110 & nbsp;km, and that is popularly known as the ''Sea of Aragon''. 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 [[File:Formigal 2007.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Formigal]] (Huesca) winter]] 
 [[Climate|Climatically]], Aragon can be divided into three areas: < ref name= " ibernature " > {{cite web | url=http://www.iberianature.com/regions/aragon/climate-of-aragon/ | title=Climate of Aragon | publisher=Iberia Nature | access-date=11 April 2014 }} < /ref > 
 # '''Continental Mediterranean'''. The Ebro valley. One of the severest climates in Spain and a daily and winter-summer temperature range. Low levels of rainfall which decrease as clouds move east towards Catalonia. 
 # '''Alpine-mountain climate'''. Short summers and very cold winters, though with big differences depending on altitude and orientation. 
 # '''Continental'''. The Calatayud-Daroca-Teruel region with mountains to the west and east that block the humid winds from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Low [[rainfall]]: {{Convert|600|-|900|mm|in|0|abbr=on }}. Hot summers and very cold winters. 
 
 In the middle of Aragon, which is only {{Convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on }} above [[sea level]], the annual average [[temperature]] is around {{Convert|14|°C|°F|0|abbr=on }}. To the north and south of the Ebro valley, where the elevation rises to {{Convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on }} above sea level, the temperature drops by two [[Celsius|degrees]]. In the mountains, between {{Convert|600|and|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on }}, the temperatures are between {{Convert|11|and|12|°C|°F|0|abbr=on }}. 
 
 ==Administrative divisions== 
 Aragon consists of three [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]] named after their [[Capital (city)|capitals]]: [[Province of Huesca|Huesca]], [[Province of Teruel|Teruel]] and [[Province of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]]. Each province is divided in ''comarcas'' (a ''comarca'' is a local [[administrative division]]) and these are divided in [[Municipality|municipalities]].

 ==Population== 
 Aragon has a population, in 2013, of 1,347,150, < ref name=pob > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/FichasWeb/RegComunidades.do?codMapa=8998 |title=INEbase / Estadísticas territoriales |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística de España |language=es |access-date=9 April 2014 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407232951/http://www.ine.es/FichasWeb/RegComunidades.do?codMapa=8998 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  for a population density of {{formatnum:{{#expr:1347150/47719 round 1 }}}} inhabitants/km < sup > 2 < /sup > , one of the lowest in Spain. The most densely populated areas are around the valley of the Ebro river, particularly around Zaragoza, and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] [[:en:wikt:foothill|foothill]]s (the hills at the base of the Pyrenees), while the areas with the fewest inhabitants tend to be those that are higher up in the Pyrenean mountains, and in most of the southern province of Teruel. 
 
 The province of Zaragoza is the one with more inhabitants, with 978,638 people living there, representing {{formatnum:{{#expr:978638/1347150 * 100 round 1 }}}}% of the population of Aragon. 
 
 The city with more people living in it is the [[Capital (city)|capital]], [[Zaragoza]] (620,419). The other provincial capitals [[Huesca]] and [[Teruel]] have, respectively, 47,923 and 31,506 inhabitants. < ref name=pob2 / >
