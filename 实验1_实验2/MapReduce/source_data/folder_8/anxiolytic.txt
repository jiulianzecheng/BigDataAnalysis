 == Mechanism == 
 Anxiolytics are said to act on key biochemical messengers in the brain and eventually decrease the abnormal excitability. The biochemical messengers or binding sites are unevenly distributed in the brain, and also said to be associated with a GABA receptor and a chloride channel. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiolytics#how-they-work2|title=About Anxiolytics|newspaper=Healthline|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-9289-6_10|title=Progress in Drug Research/Fortschritte der Arzneimittelforschung/Progrès des recherches pharmaceutiques|last1=Mennini|first1=T.|last2=Caccia|first2=S.|last3=Garattini|first3=S.|journal=Progress in Drug Research.
