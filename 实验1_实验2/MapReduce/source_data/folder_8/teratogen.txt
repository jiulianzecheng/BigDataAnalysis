[[File:GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg|thumb|This symbol shows that a substance is damaging to human health. This includes substances that cause birth defects.]] 
 A '''teratogen''' is a material that can cause [[Birth defect|birth defects]].  Teratogens include some [[chemicals]], [[medication]]s, and [[infectious disease]]s. The name goes back to Ancient Greek  " theras " , which can be translated as  " monster " . 
 
 About 75% of all birth defects are caused by teratogens. < ref name=akh/ > < ref name= " chung " > {{cite book|title=The New Public Health: An Introduction for the 21st Century|last=Chung|first=Wendy|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0127033501|location=New York|page=|chapter=Teratogens and Their Effects}} < /ref > < sup > p. & nbsp;23-3 < /sup > 
 
 == Types of teratogens == 
 
 === Alcohol and illegal drugs === 
 [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is the most common cause of congenital disorders that can be prevented. < ref name=cdcfas > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html |title=Facts about FASDs |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=April 16, 2015 |website=cdc.gov |publisher=[[CDC|United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   Alcohol is [[poison]]ous to a fetus and can cause [[brain damage]]. < ref name=PubMed > {{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024268/ |title=Fetal Alcohol Syndrome |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |quote=}} < /ref >   [[Alcoholic drink|Drinking alcohol]] while pregnant can cause the fetus to get [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]. < ref name=cdcfas/ > 
 
 [[Illegal drug]]s, like [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]], are also poisonous to the fetus and can cause many different congenital problems.  For example, cocaine use during pregnancy can cause [[microcephaly]] (a smaller head size than usual) and problems with the way the fetus's [[urinary system]] and [[genitals]] grow. < ref name=akh > {{cite web |url=http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/en/resourcecentres/pregnancybabies/pregnancy/healthcareinpregnancy/pages/things-to-avoid-during-pregnancy-teratogens.aspx |title=Things to Avoid During Pregnancy: Teratogens |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=AboutKidsHealth |publisher=The Hospital for Sick Children |accessdate=February 17, 2016 |quote= }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Medications=== 
 [[Image:NCP14053.jpg|thumb|Baby born to a mother who took [[Thalidomide scandal|thalidomide]] while pregnant]] 
 Some medications can also hurt the fetus if its mother takes them while she is pregnant.  For example: < ref name=akh/ > < ref name=chung/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;23-6 < /sup > 
 * [[Lithium carbonate]] (used to treat [[bipolar disorder]]) can cause problems in the way the fetus's [[heart]] grows 
 * [[Phenytoin]] and [[valproic acid]] ([[anticonvulsant|anti-seizure medications]]) can cause [[intellectual disability]], microcephaly, and many other problems in fetuses 
 * [[Warfarin]] (a blood-thinning medication) can cause problems with the fetus's [[central nervous system]], including intellectual disability 
 * [[ACE inhibitor]]s (a group of medications for [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]) can cause problems with the fetus's [[kidney]]s 
 
 Before the 1960s, many countries did not have rules about testing medications for their effects on fetuses. < ref name=asu > {{cite web |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/teratogens |title=Teratogens |last1=Tantibanchachai |first1=Chanapa |date=January 22, 2014 |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia |publisher=Arizona State University |issn=1940-5030 |accessdate=February 14, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   This changed partly because of [[thalidomide]].  This medication was given to pregnant women for [[nausea]] in the 1950s and 1960s.  Between 1956 and 1962, more than 10,000 children in 46 different countries were born with birth defects, like arms and legs that had not grown. < ref name= " Bren " > {{cite news | author = Bren L | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html |work=FDA Consumer |publisher= U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |date= February 28, 2001 |accessdate =February 14, 2016 }} < /ref >   Thalidomide had not been tested well enough before it started being [[prescription|prescribed]]. < ref name= " Bren " / >   Now, many countries require more testing before a medication can be said to be safe during pregnancy. < ref name=asu/ > 
 
 ===Infections=== 
 {{Main|Vertical transmission}} 
 [[File:Cataracts due to Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) PHIL 4284 lores.jpg|thumb|This baby was born with [[cataract]]s (cloudy white [[lens (eye)|lenses]] in the eyes) caused by [[rubella]]]] 
 If a woman gets an infection while she is pregnant, sometimes the infection can affect her fetus.  The [[placenta]] protects the fetus from many different [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and other [[pathogen]]s that cause infections.  However, some pathogens can get through the placenta and infect the fetus.  This is called [[vertical transmission]].  Some of these infections can cause birth defects. 
 
 Examples of infections that can cause birth defects include: 
 * [[Syphilis]] < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/pregnancy/stdfact-pregnancy.htm |title=STDs during Pregnancy – CDC Fact Sheet |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=February 3, 2016 |website=CDC.gov |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 * [[Toxoplasmosis]] < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Torgerson|first1=Paul R|last2=Mastroiacovo|first2=Pierpaolo|date=2013-07-01|title=The global burden of congenital toxoplasmosis: a systematic review|url=http://www.who.int/entity/bulletin/volumes/91/7/12-111732.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=91|issue=7|pages=501–508|doi=10.2471/BLT.12.111732|issn=0042-9686|pmc=3699792|pmid=23825877}} < /ref > 
 * [[Chickenpox]] < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Boussault|first1=Pierre|last2=Boralevi|first2=Franck|last3=Labbe|first3=Laurence|last4=Sarlangue|first4=Jean|last5=Taïeb|first5=Alain|last6=Leaute-Labreze|first6=Christine|date=July 2007|title=Chronic Varicella-Zoster Skin Infection Complicating the Congenital Varicella Syndrome|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00471.x|journal=Pediatric Dermatology|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=429–432|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1470.2007.00471.x|pmid=17845179 |s2cid=22389596 |issn=0736-8046}} < /ref > 
 * [[Rubella]] (German measles) < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-04-06|title=Congenital Rubella Syndrome - Vaccine Preventable Diseases Surveillance Manual {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt15-crs.html|access-date=2022-04-09|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Chemicals=== 
 Some chemicals can cause birth defects, if a pregnant woman is [[Exposure (toxicology)|exposed]] to enough of them.  For example: < ref name=journal > {{cite journal |author=Gilbert-Barness E 2010 |title=Teratogenic Causes of Malformations |url=http://www.annclinlabsci.org/content/40/2/99.full |journal=Annals of Clinical  &  Laboratory Science |date=20 March 2010 |publisher=Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc. |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=99–114|doi= |pmid=20421621 |accessdate=February 2, 2016}} < /ref > 
 * [[Lead]]: If a woman ever had [[lead poisoning]], she can pass lead on to her fetus, even if she is not exposed to lead while she is pregnant.  This happens because most lead is stored in a person's [[bone]]s and can come out into the [[bloodstream]] many years later.  Lead can cause [[miscarriage]] and [[stillbirth]] as well as birth defects. 
 * [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]: High levels of mercury can cause [[brain damage]] in fetuses. 
 
 ===Other things=== 
 High levels of [[ionizing radiation]] can cause birth defects. < ref name=chung/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;23-8 < /sup > 
 
 ==Things that are not teratogens== 
 Examples of things that do not cause birth defects include: < ref name=journal/ > 
 * [[Spermicide]]s (these were suspected of causing birth defects in the 1970s and 1980s, but they have been proven to be safe) 
 * [[Acetaminophen]] (paracetamol) 
 * [[Prenatal vitamins]] 
 * Non-ionizing radiation.  This is the type of radiation that comes from [[sunlight]] and [[microwave oven]]s.  It does not cause birth defects.
