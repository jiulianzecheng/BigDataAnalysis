 == History == 
 
 After [[World War I]] began in August 1914, the western Allies cut the [[Germany|German]] [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s. This caused a tremendous increase in radio traffic across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[General Electric]] corporation made the acquisition of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America in 1919. With this they formed the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). < ref > Eric P. Wenaas, ''Radiola: The Golden Age of RCA, 1919-1929'' (Chandler, AZ: Sonoran, 2007), p. viii < /ref >  In 1926, RCA created the first nationwide broadcast network, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). After the [[golden age]] of radio had passed, RCA began to decline. In 1982 they ended most of their [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs. < ref name=Cox41/ >  Finally, in 1986, General Electric bought back RCA, along with [[NBC]], for $6.28 [[million]]. < ref name=Cox41/ >  In 1988, General Electric sold the right to use its brand on consumer electronics, as well as various assets of RCA, excluding NBC, to Thomson.
