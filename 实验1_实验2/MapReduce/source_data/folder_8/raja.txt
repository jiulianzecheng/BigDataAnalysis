 '''Raja''' ({{lang-sa|राजा}} ('''rājā''')) is a [[Sanskrit]] word for ''king'' and is used as a title for monarchs in [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]]. 
 
 The title has a long history in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], as it is found in the [[Rigveda]]. < ref > where it is more accurately translated as  " tribal chief " ; see for example the ''दाशराज्ञ'' ([[dasharajna|{{IAST|dāśarājñá}}]]), the  " battle of ten ''rajas'' " < /ref >  It can also be used as a name for non-royal people in [[South Asia]]. 
 In [[Pakistan]], Raja is still used by many Muslim [[Rajput]] [[clan]]s as {{broken wikt link|hereditary|hereditary}} titles.

 * The [[ruler]] of the [[state]] of [[Perlis]], [[Malaysia]] is titled the Raja of Perlis. Most of the other state rulers are titled [[Sultan]]s. But the Raja has equal status with the other rulers and is one of the electors who designate one of their number as the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] every five years. Many [[Muslim]] [[Malays|Malay]] rulers in the medieval times adopted the title of ''Raja''.
