 '''Ungulates''' (meaning roughly  " [[hoof]]ed animal " ) are several groups of [[mammal]]s. Most of them use the tips of their [[toe]]s, usually as [[hooves]], to support their body weight while moving.   
 
 As a descriptive term,  " ungulate "  normally excludes [[cetacea]]ns (whales, dolphins, porpoises), because they do not have most of the typical [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics of ungulates. However, recent discoveries show that the Cetacea were descended from early [[artiodactyl]]s. < ref name= " Genomes " > {{Cite journal | title = Analyses of mitochondrial genomes strongly support a hippopotamus-whale clade | volume = 265 | issue = 1412 | year = 1998 | pages = 2251–5 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | author = Ursing B.M. |author2=Arnason U.  | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0567 | pmid = 9881471 | pmc = 1689531}} < /ref >   
 
 Ungulates are typically [[herbivorous]] and many use specialised [[gut flora]] to digest [[cellulose]]. Some modern species, such as [[pig]]s, are omnivorous. Some prehistoric species, such as the [[Mesonychia]], were carnivorous. 
 
 Ungulates include odd-toed ungulates such as [[horses]], [[rhinoceros]]es and tapirs, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, [[pigs]], [[giraffes]], [[camels]], [[sheep]], [[deer]], and [[hippopotamuses]]. [[Cetaceans]] are also even-toed ungulates although they do not have hooves.
