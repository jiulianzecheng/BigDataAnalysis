 '''Diorite''' ( [[Help:IPA/English|/ˈdaɪ.əˌraɪt/]]) is an melted rock that has cooled made mostly of the [[Silicate mineral|silicate minerals]] (materials made of silicon and oxygen). Diorite is in between that of basalt and granite. Diorite is usually grey to dark-grey in color, but it can also be black or bluish-grey, and often has a greenish cast. It is distinguished from gabbro (basalt) because the materials in diorite has more [[sodium]] and less [[calcium]]. Diorite may have small amounts of [[quartz]], [[Microcline|microcline]], and [[olivine]]. Tiny amounts of [[Muscovite|muscovite]] may also be found.  If there is a lot of quartz it makes the rock type ''quartz-diorite'' ( > 5% quartz) or [[tonalite]] ( > 20% quartz). 
 
 Diorite has an often speckled, [[texture]] of coarse grain size. 
 
 Diorites may be associated with either granite or basalt [[Intrusion|intrusions]], into which they may merge. Diorite results from the [[partial melting]] of a rock above the area where two tectonic plates merge under each other. It is commonly produced in [[Volcanic arc|volcanic arcs]], and in cordilleran [[Orogeny|mountain building]], such as in the [[Andes Mountains]], as large [[Batholith|batholiths]]. The [[Extrusive (geology)|extrusive]] [[volcanic]] equivalent rock type is [[andesite]].

 Diorite is a relatively rare rock; source localities include [[Leicestershire]] (one name for microdiorite—markfieldite—exists due to the rock's being found in the village of [[Markfield]]) and [[Aberdeenshire]], [[UK]]; [[Guernsey]]; [[Sondrio]], [[Italy]]; [[Thuringia]] and [[Saxony]] in [[Germany]]; [[Finland]]; [[Romania]]; Northeastern [[Turkey]]; central [[Sweden]]; the Darrans range of [[New Zealand]]; < ref name= " DarransNZ " > {{Cite journal|last1=Wandres|first1=A.

 An [[Orbicular granite|orbicular]] variety found in [[Corsica]] is called [[napoleonite|corsite]].
