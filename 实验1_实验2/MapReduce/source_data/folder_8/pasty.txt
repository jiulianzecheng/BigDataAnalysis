A '''pasty''' is a kind of [[pastry]] filled with meat or [[vegetables]] and [[baking|baked]], a bit like a [[pie]]. They are linked with [[Cornwall]] where they were first made. 
 
 ==Description== 
 Pastry [[dough]] is rolled out and cut in a circle. The raw filling is placed on half the circle, then the pastry is folded in half over the filling to cover it. The edges are then sealed by crimping (firmly pressed together), and baked. The baking time for the filling and the pastry is the same. 
 
 The pasty is made as a single-serving portion, for one person's meal. It's made to be [[Finger food|held in the hand]] and does not need any [[cutlery]]. It may be eaten hot, warm, or at room temperature.  
 
 ==Uses== 
 A pasty is portable and convenient to eat. It can be easily be taken to the workplace and kept until a mealtime break. No refrigeration is required if eaten the same day. The sealed, baked dough keeps the filling warm for hours after baking. A pasty could also be reheated by placing on or near a heat source - even by holding over a candle where no oven is available.
