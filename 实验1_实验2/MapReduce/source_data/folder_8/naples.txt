 == History == 
 
 Ancient Greeks settled Naples in the 6th Century B.C. There were so many Greeks there, the Romans called it ''[[Magna Graecia]]'', which means  " Greater Greece. " < ref > The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature, Paul Harvey, 1927,1955, p258 < /ref >  Later the Romans conquered southern Italy and took Naples.  When the Roman Empire fell to invaders in the west, Naples came under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire. 
 
 Naples became independent later and but was combined with the Kingdom of Sicily during the Middle Ages. By 1500 it was ruled by [[Aragón]], which was a kingdom in eastern Spain. Later Naples became part of Spain when Aragon and the other kingdom in Spain called Castile became one country. Naples was part of this Kingdom of Spain until the [[Austrian Empire]] got it in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1714. 
 
 In the 19th century it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].  The [[Duchy of Savoy]], or kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, conquered Naples in 1861.  That kingdom became the Kingdom of Italy.  Naples was heavily bombed when Italy fought in World War Two and British/American armies tried to capture it. 
 
 Today Naples is the capital of [[Campania]] and the largest city in southern Italy. 
 
 == Climate == 
 
 The average temperature in the [[summer]] is 24°[[Celsius|C]]. In the [[winter]], the average can be as low as 8°[[Celsius|C]]. There is usually around 40 inches of rain in the city every year.
