 A '''vine''' is a [[climbing plant]] which use [[Plant stem|stems]] or [[Runner (botany)|runners]]. These runners trail on the ground, and will climb up when it is possible. It is a growth habit or [[life habit]] which makes use of trees to reach light in natural [[habitats]].  
 
 In the United Kingdom, the term  " vine "  applies almost exclusively to the '''grapevine''', whereas the term  " climber "  is used for all climbing plants. < ref > {{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary. 6th ed|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199206872|pages=3804}} < /ref >   The grapevine, [[genus]] '''''[[Vitis]]''''', carries [[berry|berries]] which can be made into [[wine]].  
 
 In the United States, all climbing plants are called vines or ivies or sometimes creepers (like the [[Virigina Creeper]]).  
 
 Most vines are [[flowering plants]]. These may be divided into woody vines or [[liana]]s, such as [[wisteria]], [[kiwifruit]], and common [[ivy]], and [[herbaceous]] (nonwoody) vines, such as [[morning glory]].
