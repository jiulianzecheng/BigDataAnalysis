 '''Mackerel''' is a common [[name]] given to a number of [[species]] of [[fish]]. Most mackerel are from the [[Scombridae]] family. 
 
 They are [[pelagic]] fish, found in both temperate and tropical seas. Most live along the [[coast]] or offshore in the [[ocean]]ic environment. 
 
 Mackerel typically have vertical stripes on their backs and deeply forked tails. They are superb swimmers, but are often eaten by larger predators such as [[cod]], [[sharks]] and [[dolphins]]. 
 
 Mackerel is an [[oil]]y fish with rich of [[omega-3]]. The flesh of mackerel spoils easily, especially in the [[tropics]], and can cause [[food poisoning]]. So, it should be eaten on the day of capture, unless [[pickling|pickled]] in salt, or refrigerated.
