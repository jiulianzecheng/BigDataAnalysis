 [[Image:Exclave.svg|thumb|275px|C is B's exclave, but is not an [[enclave]].]] 
 [[Image:Enclave.svg|thumb|275px|C is B's exclave, and A's enclave.]] 
 An '''exclave''' is strip of land that belongs to an entity (like a [[country]] or a [[region]]) but that is not connected to it by land (islands are not counted). The strip of land is surrounded by other political entities. A good example is [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (the region around the [[Russia]]n city [[Kaliningrad]]). It belongs to the Russian Federation, but is separated from the rest of that country by territory belonging to [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]. 
 
 Although both meanings are close, an exclave might not be an [[enclave]].  An enclave is completely surrounded by one other country.   For example, Kaliningrad is surrounded not by one state, but by two: Lithuania and Poland. It also borders the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is not an enclave.  On the other hand, the [[Spain|Spanish]] exclave of [[Llivia]] is an enclave in [[France]]. 
 
 Many exclaves today have some of [[idea]] of becoming [[independent]], especially if the exclave is far away from the mainland. 
 
 A much more obscure use means, in medical discussion, a detached part of an organ, as of the pancreas, thyroid, or other gland. 
 
 The lists below are of various types of exclaves that are not [[enclave]]s.

 ==Subnational exclaves== 
 Exclaves of [[administrative division]]s below the national level. 
 
 *Many of the [[cantons of Switzerland]] have exclaves: 
 **[[Canton of Bern|Bern]] has two small exclaves, Münchenwiler and Clavaleyres; the first is entirely surrounded by Fribourg, the second by Fribourg and Vaud's exclave. 
 **[[canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] has two pieces separated from the main territory by the [[Vierwaldstättersee]]; one borders [[Schwyz]], the other Nidwalden. 
 **The  " half-canton "  of [[Obwalden]] is in two large pieces, separated by a strip of Nidwalden. 
 **[[Nidwalden]]'s district of [[Hergiswil]] is separated by an arm of the [[Vierwaldstättersee]]. 
 **[[Fribourg (canton)|Fribourg]] is a large exclave bounded by Vaud and [[Lake Neuchâtel]]; two enclaves, Surpierre and Vuissens, within Vaud; and another enclave, Wallenbuch, within Bern. 
 **[[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] has two exclaves, Dorneck and Thierstein, both bounded on the south by [[Basel-Country]] and on the north by [[France]]; as well as the enclave of Steinhof which is entirely surrounded by Bern. 
 **[[canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], the only canton lying mostly on the north bank of the [[Rhine]], is cut into three parts by [[Germany|German]] territory that links Germany to the Rhine.  The middle part is the largest, and surrounds the German enclave of [[Büsingen]].  The upper and middle parts border on [[Thurgau]], the middle and lower parts on [[canton of Zürich|Zürich]]. 
 **The divided canton of [[Appenzell]] is surrounded by [[Canton of St. Gallen|Sankt-Gallen]].  Since its [[partition]] on religious lines in 1597, [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] has three small exclaves, one enclave in [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]] and two bordering also on Sankt-Gallen. 
 **[[Vaud]] has one exclave, Avenches, bordered by [[Lake Neuchâtel]], Fribourg and the tiny Bernese exclave of Clavaleyres.  The coast of Lake Neuchâtel is thus in seven pieces belonging to four cantons: clockwise from the north they are [[canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], Bern (main), Vaud (Avenches exclave), Fribourg (main), Vaud (main), Fribourg (exclave), Vaud (main). 
 **[[canton of Geneva|Geneva]] has two small exclaves within Vaud, together making the commune of [[Céligny]].  The larger has a shoreline on [[Lake Geneva]]. 
 **The [[secession]] of the new [[canton of Jura]] in 1979 left [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] temporarily with an exclave bounded by Jura, Solothurn (main and both exclaves), [[Basel-Country]] and [[France]].  The exclave, [[Laufental]], joined Basel-Country in 1994. 
 
 *[[United States]]: 
 **[[Kentucky]]: The westernmost part of the state, a piece of land known as the [[Kentucky Bend]], is surrounded on three sides by the [[Mississippi River]], with [[Missouri]] on the opposite shore. Road access to the rest of Kentucky is only available by first going south into [[Tennessee]].  This exclave exists because the Mississippi, which forms the boundary between Missouri (right bank) and Kentucky/Tennessee (left bank), crosses latitude 36°30', which is part of the border between Kentucky and Tennessee, three times. 
 **[[Louisiana]]: [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish]] has an exclave which is separated from the main part of the parish by [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]]. 
 **[[Massachusetts]]: [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] is not in one piece.  The towns of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Cohasset, Massachusetts|Cohasset]] are part of Norfolk County, but are surrounded on all sides by other counties: Brookline by [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]], Cohasset by [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]. 
 **[[California]]: The [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco]] has an exclave on [[Alameda Island]], across [[San Francisco Bay]] and adjoining [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]]. The exclave came into being as land on the border between the two counties was reclaimed from the Bay to build the [[Naval Air Station Alameda]], now decommissioned. This small piece of open space cannot be reached from San Francisco (except by boat) without passing through [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Alameda, California|Alameda]]. 
 **[[Michigan]]: The  " [[Lost Peninsula]] "  in [[Monroe County, Michigan]], can only be reached via [[Toledo, Ohio]]. It is surrounded by [[Maumee Bay]] in [[Lake Erie]]. ([http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q & hl=en & q=monroe,+mi & ll=41.736223,-83.456655 & spn=0.009111,0.02429 Map]) 
 **[[Sandoval County, New Mexico]]: During [[World War II]], [[Los Alamos County, New Mexico|Los Alamos County]] was created out of parts of Sandoval and [[Santa Fe County, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] Counties, for the convenience of the [[Manhattan Project]].  That portion of Sandoval County which is within the [[San Ildefonso Indian Reservation]], about 3 km², became an exclave bounded by Los Alamos County on the southwest, Santa Fe County on the east and [[Rio Arriba County, New Mexico|Rio Arriba County]] on the north. 
 
 == " Practical "  exclaves== 
 Some territories are not geographically detached from their motherland. Nevertheless, they are more easily reached by entering a foreign country. Very often, this is because of their location in a hilly area. It may also be because the only road enters that foreign place before coming back to the mother country.  These territories may be called  " practical exclaves, "   " pene-exclaves "  or  " quasi-exclaves "  and can be found along many borders, particularly those that are not heavily defended. They will only be attached to the motherland via an extremely small or thin slice of land. 
 
 *[[Canada]]: [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation|St. Regis]], [[Quebec]]: Part of the [[Akwesasne]] [[Mohawk Nation]] on the south shore of the [[Saint Lawrence River]], it is attached by land to the [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State; road access to the rest of Canada is only available through New York State. 
 *[[United States]]: 
 ** Alaska: The [[Alaska Panhandle]], though connected geographically, is inaccessible by road from the rest of the state.  One must drive through Canada to reach the area from elsewhere in the state 
 **[[Minnesota]]: The [[Northwest Angle]] is attached by land to the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]; road access to the rest of the [[United States]] is only available through Manitoba 
 **[[Washington]]: [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]] is at the southern end of a [[peninsula]]; land access to the rest of the [[United States]] is only available through the Canadian [[province]] of [[British Columbia]] 
 
 == " Practical "  subnational exclaves== 
 *[[United States]]: 
 **[[Virginia]] :The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]], comprising [[Accomack County, Virginia|Accomack County]] and [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton County]], is located at the southern tip of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]].  It is connected to the rest of Virginia via the 23 mile (37 km) long [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]]. 
 **[[Iowa]]: [[Carter Lake, Iowa|Carter Lake]], a part of [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]], is surrounded by [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] on three sides and the [[Missouri River]] on the fourth; road access to Iowa is only available through Nebraska.   
 **[[Michigan]]: The [[Upper Peninsula]] is attached by land to [[Wisconsin]].  It can be reached from the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] by the 5 mile (8 km) long [[Mackinac Bridge]]. 
 
 *[[United Kingdom]]: 
 **[[England]]: [[Pentreheyling]] can only be reached by road through [[Wales]]. 
 
 ==Historical exclaves== 
 *[[East Prussia]], a [[Germany|German]] exclave during the [[Weimar Republic]]: it was separated from Germany after [[World War I]], when [[Poland]] regained access to the Baltic sea.  East Prussia (essentially the old [[Duchy of Prussia]]) is now divided into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] in [[Russia]] (see above) and the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodship]] in [[Poland]]. 
 later became part of Poland and Russia (see [[Kaliningrad]] above). 
 *[[Bangladesh#History|East Bengal]] (1947-1955) / [[Bangladesh#History|East Pakistan]] (1955-1971), now [[Bangladesh]], was an exclave separated from [[West Pakistan]] by 1600 kilometres of [[India]]'s territory. East Pakistan accounted for 70% of the exports of the country and was more populous than West Pakistan, and so in a sense it was actually the physically larger and politically more influential West that was the enclave and East Pakistan that was the Mainland. 
 *[[Walvis Bay]] was a [[South Africa]]n exclave in [[Namibia]], before being incorporated with Namibia upon its independence.
