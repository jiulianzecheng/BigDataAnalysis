 '''Magpies''' are [[bird]]s in the [[crow]] [[family (biology)|family]], [[Crow|Corvidae]]. They are general [[scavenger]]s and predators of insects, small mammals, and other birds' eggs and young. 
 
 The word  " magpie "  usually means the [[European magpie]] (''Pica pica''), which is a very common bird, found all over Europe. Elsewhere, there are other species of magpie. Most are [[black]] and [[white]] and are in the [[genus]] '''''Pica'''''.  
 
 == Other birds called  " magpie "  == 
 There are other species of bird that are called 'magpies', though they are not true magpies. Oriental  " magpies "  are green and blue in colour, and are in the genera ''[[Urocissa]]'' and ''[[Cissa]]''. There is also one blue and white magpie, the [[azure-winged magpie]] ''Cyanopica cyana''. There is the [[black magpie]], which is really a [[treepie]]. There is also the [[Australian magpie]]. It is not a member of the [[crow]] family at all. It is in the [[Artamidae]] family. All these are in different genera from ''Pica''. This is a good example of the confusion caused by common names before the [[Linnaean system]] came into use. 
 
 == Description == 
 Magpies are large birds. They often have long tails. Magpies eat lots of different kinds of food. They may eat baby birds, eggs and [[carrion]]. They may also eat seeds and other parts of plants. 
 
 Magpies are clever birds. They can pass the [[mirror test]]. This is when the bird sees itself in a [[mirror]] and understands that it is a [[reflection]]. Magpies do not have any attraction to bright, shiny things, contrary to popular belief.
