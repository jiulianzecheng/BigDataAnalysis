 A '''nose''' is a [[body]] part which allows [[animal]]s to [[Olfaction|smell]] things. The nose also helps animals [[breathe]]. It has parts that make it work and send messages to the [[brain]]. The nose's parts include [[smell receptor]]s and [[nerve]] connectors to receptors. In [[human]]s, the nose is on the front of the [[face]]. The power of the nose varies for animals. For example, [[dog]]s have a stronger sense of smell than humans do. It is part of the [[respiratory system]] which is the system in animals that help them to [[breathing|breathe]]. Your nose is very powerful and can remember up to 50,000 different scents.  
 
 The nose is important to [[health]]. It filters the [[air]] breathed in, removing [[dust]], [[germ]]s, and irritants. It warms and moistens the air to keep the [[lung]]s and tubes that lead to them from drying out. The nose also contains nerve [[cell]]s that help the sense of smell. When there is a problem with the nose, the whole [[body]] can suffer. For example, the stuffy nose of the [[common cold]] can make it hard to breathe, [[sleep]], or get comfortable. 
 
 Many problems besides the common cold can affect the nose. They include 
 * Deviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the [[nasal cavity]] into halves 
 * Nasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of the nose or sinuses 
 * [[Nosebleed]]s 
 * Rhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by [[allergy|allergies]]. The main symptom is a runny nose. 
 * Nasal fractures, also known as a broken nose
