 A '''jumpsuit''' is a one-piece [[garment]] with sleeves and legs. It has no coverings for feet, hands or head. The original jump suit is the functional one-piece garment used by parachuters. 
 
 Jumpsuits are garments of convenience, as they're quicker to put on and remove than outfits with two or more pieces.  
 
 Variants of jumpsuits include [[flight suits]],  made of thicker fabric to retain heat, rompers, short-sleeved suits with often shorts instead of trousers, short-sleeved orange or striped suits used in North America as [[prison uniforms]]
