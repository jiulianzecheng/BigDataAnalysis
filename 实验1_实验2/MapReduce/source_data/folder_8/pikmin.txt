 {{Nihongo|'''''Pikmin'''''|ピクミン|Pikumin}} is a series of [[video game]]s created by [[Nintendo]] that started on the [[Nintendo GameCube]] in [[2001]]. It has four released main-series games - ''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]], [[Pikmin 2]]'', ''[[Pikmin 3]]'' and ''[[Pikmin 4]]''. The series is about a spaceman called Captain Olimar visiting an alien planet and working with creatures called Pikmin to explore it. 
 
 ==Characters== 
 
 *'''Captain Olimar''' - Captain Olimar is spaceman who crash lands on the alien planet in ''[[Pikmin (video game)|Pikmin]]'' and meets the Pikmin species, and has to fix his ship and get off the planet in 30 days, or he'll die. Olimar is a play on the name [[Mario (Nintendo)|Mario]], Nintendo's mascot, by rearranging the syllables. Olimar writes about the biological features of every creature encountered in the Notes section. 
 *'''Pikmin''' - The Pikmin are a type of creature who help Captain Olimar. In ''Pikmin'', they come in red, yellow, and blue types. In ''[[Pikmin 2]]'', they also come in white and purple types. 
 *'''Louie''' - Louie joins Olimar in ''Pikmin 2'' and helps him find treasure. Louie is a play on the name [[Luigi]], Mario's brother and sidekick, by using the [[nickname]] for it. Louie is gluttonous, and often causes trouble out of his desire for food. In his unlockable notes on the creatures and plants in game, he details how to cook and eat every creature.  
 *'''Emperor Bulbax''' - The villain of the first ''Pikmin'' game. 
 *'''President''' - The President of Captain Olimar's company, who sends him and Louie to find treasure to pay off the company's [[debt]]. He appears as a playable character in Pikmin 2 when Louie is missing.  
 
 ==Setting== 
 ''Pikmin'' is set on a world that is supposed to be [[Earth]], but Captain Olimar is very tiny, so it looks like a strange world to the player. Nintendo made it seem more like Earth by adding common items, like a globe of the Earth, a [[Duracell]] battery, and a [[Pepsi]] bottle cap. 
 
 ==Gameplay== 
 Both games use [[real-time strategy video game|real-time strategy]] gameplay. The player plays as Captain Olimar, who can command his Pikmin. Olimar gets Pikmin by bringing pellets, a type of food, and bad guys to an [[Onion]], which is the Pikmin's ship. Pikmin will come out of the Onion and get planted in the ground so that Olimar can pull them out. Olimar can use Pikmin to take stuff back to his base, fight insects and other creatures, or travel across places.
