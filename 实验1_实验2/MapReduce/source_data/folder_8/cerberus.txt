 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cerberus''' ({{lang-el|Κέρβερος}}, ''Kérberos''; [[Latin]]: ''Cerberus'') is the monstrous, [[polycephaly|multi-headed]] dog that guards the entrance to the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], preventing the souls of the dead from leaving.  
 
 Often called the  " hound of [[Hades]] " , Cerberus was one of the numerous offspring of the monsters [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]; he is usually depicted as having three heads, along with a serpent for a tail. Cerberus is primarily known for being captured by [[Heracles|Herakles]], as the last of the hero's [[Labors of Herakles|Twelve Labors]].
