'''Veal''' is the [[meat]] of young [[cattle]] ([[calf|calves]]), as opposed to [[beef]] from older cattle. Though veal can be made from a calf of either [[gender|sex]] and any breed, most veal comes from male calves of [[dairy cattle]] breeds. Veal has a tender texture. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/food_matters/veal.shtml|work=BBC Food|title=Food matters - Is veal cruel?|access-date=2011-03-15|archive-date=2007-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529064739/http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/food_matters/veal.shtml|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==As food== 
 [[Image:Veal.png|thumb|Boneless veal cutlets]] 
 Veal has been an important [[ingredient]] in [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[French cuisine]] since [[Ancient history|ancient]] times.  The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian [[cotoletta]] or the famous [[Austria]]n dish [[Wiener Schnitzel]]. Some classic French veal dishes include: fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small thick fillet steaks), stuffed [[paupiette]]s, roast joints and [[Blanquette de veau|blanquettes]]. As veal is lower in [[fat]] than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often [[breading|coated]] in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. [[Parmigiana|Veal Parmigiana]] is a common Italian-American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets. 
 
 ==Animal welfare== 
 Veal is a [[controversy|controversial]] issue in terms of [[animal welfare]]. 
 
 Many animal welfare groups, who strongly focus on [[factory farming]], try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be [[inhumane]]. This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry, resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry. < ref name=HSUSW  > {{cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/welfare/welfare_veal_calves.html|publisher=HSUS|title=Welfare of Veal Calves|access-date=2011-03-15|archive-date=2010-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030024825/http://www.hsus.org/farm/resources/research/welfare/welfare_veal_calves.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 A strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move. After people saw these photographs, people started buying less veal. They have not started buying more again. < ref name=NYTIMESV > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/dining/18veal.html?ex=1334548800 & en=13c1aa1eefd7c4b1 & ei=5124 & partner=permalink & exprod=permalink|title=Veal to Love, Without the Guilt|work=The New York Times}} < /ref > 
 
 Many veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms. < ref name=NYTIMESV/ > < ref name=wpost > {{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/27/AR2009102700563.html|newspaper=Washington Post|title=Veal, Cast in a Kinder Light}} < /ref > 
 
 The American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017, which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming.  Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31, 2008. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://cfhs.ca/farm/veal_crates/|title=CFHS on veal crates|access-date=2011-03-15|archive-date=2011-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172457/http://cfhs.ca/farm/veal_crates/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/sep07/070915r_pf.asp|title=Veal Assoc.

 Though a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves can't move much and get sick, < ref name= " HSUSW "  / >  the Veal Quality Assurance Program  &  Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet, and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt. They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves. < ref name=OntarioVeal > {{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioveal.on.ca/all_about_veal/housing.html|publisher=Ontario Veal|title=All About Veal Housing|access-date=2011-03-15|archive-date=2013-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526192338/http://www.ontarioveal.on.ca/all_about_veal/housing.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name=VealFarmFAQ > {{cite web|url=http://www.vealfarm.com/industry-info/faqs.asp|title=Veal Farm FAQ|access-date=2011-03-15|archive-date=2011-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100256/http://www.vealfarm.com/industry-info/faqs.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 In 2007, less than 5% of veal calves were raised in a group environment. In 2009, this had increased to 35%. 
 
 ==Veal crate bans== 
 The following shows where veal crates have been banned, or are currently in the process of being banned: 
 ===Europe=== 
 Veal crates became [[illegal]] in the [[UK]] in 1990, < ref > [http://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/factory_farming/colorado_bans_veal_crates.aspx CIWF on Veal Crates (UK ban on bottom of page)] < /ref >  and a full ban has been placed for the entire [[European Union]], as of 2007. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://cfhs.ca/farm/veal_crates/ |title=CFHA - Veal Crates |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-date=2011-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172457/http://cfhs.ca/farm/veal_crates/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe-plan-for-ban-on-veal-crates-1525606.html independent.org - Europe Plan for Veal Crate Ban] < /ref >   [[Switzerland]], with its substantial dairy industry, continues to use crates. 
 
 Veal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries, such as in [[Finland]]. In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it, and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food. < ref > [http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1996/en19960396?search%5Btype%5D=pika & search%5Bpika%5D=animal%20welfare Finnish animal welfare decree] and [http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1996/en19960247?search%5Btype%5D=pika & search%5Bpika%5D=animal%20welfare Finnish Animal Welfare Act] < /ref > 
 
 ===USA=== 
 Crates are slowly being banned in the [[United States]]. As stated above, several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates, as well as the American Veal Association. 
 State-by-state veal crate bans are as follows: < ref name=AGE > [http://www.agecon.unl.edu/Cornhuskereconomics/2009cornhusker/9-2-09.pdf University of Nebraska - Cali. Veal] < /ref >
