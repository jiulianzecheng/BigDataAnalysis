'''FIMCAP''' is an international youth organization. It unites youth organizations from different countries. Most of the member organizations of FIMCAP are Catholic. FIMCAP was founded in 1962. 
 
 == History == 
 In 1959 youth organizations from France, Belgium and the Netherlands met. They discussed together how they can work together in the future. Based on these discussion they developed a joint plan. Following the plan they met again in Munich in 1960 at a big Catholic meeting. Following these meetings, they decided in 1961 to officially found FIMCAP. In 1976 FIMCAP was also recognized officially by the Vatican.
