 The '''impala''' (''Aepyceros melampus'') is a medium-sized [[Africa]]n [[antelope]]. The name  " impala "  comes from the [[Zulu language]]. Impala belong in the kingdom [[Animal|Animalia]], phylum Chordata and class [[Mammal|Mammalia]]. Along with cattle, antelopes, sheep, goats, buffalo and bison, they belong to the family [[Bovid|Bovidae]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Lundrigan|first1=Barbara|last2=Sproull|first2=Karen|title=Aepyceros melampus (impala)|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Aepyceros_melampus/|access-date=2021-10-31|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 The impala is reddish-brown with [[white]] hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical [[black]] stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg. 
 
 The impala can jump more than 10 meters distance and 3 meters high, and can reach running speeds of about 80 to 90 & nbsp;km/h, to escape from predators. 
 
 Female impala, called ewes, have no horns. But males, the rams, grow curved horns with a notable twisted appearance due to ridges. These horns are black and grow as long as 36 inches. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Impalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by [[water]]. In Africa, these animals still live throughout Kenya, Botswana, Angola, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, Zaire and Tanzania.
