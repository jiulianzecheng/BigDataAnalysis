 '''Canada''' is a [[country]] in [[North America]]. Its land reaches from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west. The [[Arctic Ocean]] is to the north of Canada. Canada's land area is {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}. It is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second largest country by total area]], but only the fourth largest country by [[land area]]. It has the world's longest [[coastline]] (a border with water). Canada has [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. Most parts of the country are cold or severely cold in the [[winter]]. Areas in the south of Canada are warm in the [[summer]]. Much of the land is covered in [[forest]] or [[tundra]]. Most of the people in Canada live in [[Urbanization|urban areas]], near the southern border with the US. This border is the longest between any two countries in the world. The [[capital city|national capital]] is[[Ottawa]], and the largest [[city]] is [[Toronto]]. Other large cities include [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Quebec City]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]. 
 
 The name  " Canada "  comes from the Huron-Iroquois word  " Kanata, "  meaning  " village "  or  " settlement. "  In 1535, two Aboriginal youths told an explorer from France, named [[Jacques Cartier]], about the route to Kanata. They were actually referring to the village named Stadacona, which is near present-day city of Québec. 
 
 [[Aboriginal people]] lived in the places (that are now Canada) for a long time. In 1537, the [[French colonial empire|French]] started a colony. The [[British Empire]] soon followed. The two empires fought several wars. In the late 18th century, only [[British North America]] remained with what is more or less Canada today. The country was formed from several colonies with the British North America Act on July 1, 1867. Over time, more provinces and territories became part of Canada. In 1931, Canada achieved nearly total independence with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and became [[sovereignty|completely independent]] when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence with the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. 
 
 Canada is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Charles III|King Charles III]] as its head of state. The country is officially [[bilingual]] at the federal level. That means that [[Citizenship|citizens]] have the right to communicate with the [[Government of Canada|government]] in two languages: English or French. [[Immigration to Canada]] has made it one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations. Its economy is [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|the eleventh largest in the world]], and relies mainly on [[natural resources]] and well-developed international [[trading|trade networks]]. Canada's relationship with its neighbor and biggest trading partner, the U.S., has a big impact on its economy and [[culture of Canada|culture]]. 
 
 Canada is a [[developed country]] and has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|tenth highest]] nominal per capita income globally as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|sixteenth highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, [[civil liberties]], quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a [[Commonwealth realm]] member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[Group_of_Seven|G7]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

 Canada is made up of [[List of Canadian provinces and territories|ten provinces and three territories]]. The provinces are between the 45th and 60th parallels of latitude, and the territories are to the north of the 60th parallel of latitude. Most large cities in Canada are in the southern part of the country, including Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Very few people live in the northern part of Canada. 
 
 Canada extends from the west coast to the Atlantic provinces. In the north, there are three territories: Yukon in the west, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. They make up 16% of the Earth's [[fresh water]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] joins the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, allowing vessels in the ocean to travel as far inland as [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]] in Ontario, Canada. 
 
 Canada shares land and sea borders with the USA (the lower 48 states and [[Alaska]]), [[Greenland]], and France (St. Pierre and Miquelon, a small group of islands off the southern coast off the island of [[Newfoundland]]). 
 
 The geography of Canada is very different in each region. Canada's geography features high [[Alpine tundra|alpine areas]] in the west, flat [[grassland]]s and prairies in the middle, and ancient [[Shield (geology)|shield]] rocks in the east. Canada has some of the very last untouched [[boreal forest]] in the world. 
 
 The [[Canadian Shield]] is a vast area of ancient Pre-Cambrian rocks lying in an arc around [[Hudson Bay]], covering more than one third of Canada's land area. This is a unique land of lakes, bogs, swamps, trees, and rocks. It is a terrain that is very dangerous and difficult to traverse cross country because of the lakes, bogs, swamps, trees, and rocks. Canada has 60% of the world's [[lake]]s.

 Many people think the first people to live in Canada came from [[Siberia]] at least 14,000 years ago, using the [[Bering land bridge]]. The land bridge connected Asia and North America. < ref > {{cite book |first=Thomas D. |last=Dillehay |title=The Settlement of the Americas: A New Prehistory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aM0CRBQ9kFcC & pg=PA61 |year=2008 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-7867-2543-4 |page=61 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413032756/https://books.google.com/books?id=aM0CRBQ9kFcC & pg=PA61 |archive-date=April 13, 2016}} < /ref > < ref name= " FaganDurrani2016 " > {{cite book |first1=Brian M. |last1=Fagan |first2=Nadia |last2=Durrani |title=World Prehistory: A Brief Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMneCwAAQBAJ & pg=PA124 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-34244-1 |page=124 |access-date=2022-02-22 |archive-date=2023-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230120114912/https://books.google.com/books?id=fMneCwAAQBAJ & pg=PA124 |url-status=live }} < /ref >

 === European colonization === 
 The [[Vikings]] were the first Europeans to land in Canada, in what is now [[Newfoundland]]. The exploration was led by the Viking explorer [[Leif Erikson]]. They did not stay for a long time. In the early 16th century, Europeans started exploring Canada's eastern coast. The first of these explorers was [[John Cabot]] from [[England]], in 1497, and later [[Jacques Cartier]] from [[France]], in 1534. [[Alexander Mackenzie]] later reached the Pacific coast over land, where captains [[James Cook]] and [[George Vancouver]] went by sea. The Europeans also traded beaver furs to the [[First Nations]]. 
 
 Some parts of Canada were settled by France. Other parts of the country were settled by [[Great Britain]]. In 1605, [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port-Royal]] was built in Acadia (today called Nova Scotia) by the French, led by [[Samuel de Champlain]]. In 1608, he settled in Quebec. The British took control of the French areas after a battle of the [[French and Indian War]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]], near [[Quebec City]], in 1759. 
 
 Thousands of people came north to Canada and settled in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], and [[Ontario]]. They were called [[United Empire Loyalists]].  
 
 === Confederation and expansion === 
 On July 1, 1867, Canada was united under a [[federation|federal government]]. At first, Canada was only made up of the provinces [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] was the first prime minister. [[Manitoba]], the [[Yukon]] territory, and the [[Northwest Territories]] became part of Canada in 1870. [[British Columbia]] joined in 1871, and [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1873. 
 
 There were two [[Red River Rebellion]]s, in 1869-70 and 1885, both led by [[Louis Riel]]. He fought for more [[rights]] for the [[Métis people]], a mix between French and First Nations. A [[railroad]] across the country, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], finished in 1885, making it easier for Canadians to move to the west. Many Europeans came to the [[prairie]]s, so [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] became provinces in 1905. 
 
 === Early 20th century === 
 Canadian soldiers fought in [[World War I]] for the [[British Empire]]. More Canadians died in this war than any other war. Canada became better known as a country after its success in capturing [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] from the Germans in France in 1917. Women were given the right to vote by the end of the war, partly because of the help they gave making weapons while the men fought in Europe. In 1931, Canada became fully [[Independence|independent]]. The government of Canada made all the decisions about Canada. 
 
 [[File:Crew of a Sherman-tank south of Vaucelles.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Crew of a Sherman-tank resting while parked|A Canadian crew during the [[Operation Overlord|battle of Normandy]] in June 1944.|140px]]Canadians also fought in [[World War II]]. The [[Dieppe Raid|Dieppe Raid,]] in 1942, went very badly. Most soldiers were killed, wounded, or imprisoned. Canadians helped capture soldiers at [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]] in 1944. They also liberated the [[Netherlands]] from Germany. 
 
 === Modern times === 
 In 1949, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] became the 10th province of Canada. In 1956, Canadian [[Lester Pearson]], who later became prime minister, helped end the [[Suez Crisis]]. Because of this, he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In 1965, Pearson helped change the design of Canada's flag. This design is known as the [[Maple Leaf]] today. Before that, the [[Flag of Canada|Red Ensign]] was Canada's flag. In 1982, Canada changed its [[constitution]]. The change introduced a new [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The main part of the Constitution is the 1867 [[British North America]] Act. 
 
 Some French Canadians today wish to form their own country, separate from the rest of Canada. The province of Quebec held a [[referendum]] (vote) in 1980, but only about 40% wanted to separate. Another referendum was held in 1995, with almost 50% voting in favour of leaving Canada. Since then, fewer people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada, but it is still important to Quebec politics. 
 
 Today, about 25% of Canadians speak French as their first language. Many people in Canada speak both French and English. Although most French Canadians live in the province of [[Quebec]], there are French-speaking communities and people all across Canada. For example, 40% of the people in the province of [[New Brunswick]] and 20% of those in [[Manitoba]] have a strong French background, as some people do in [[Ontario]], mainly along its border with Quebec. 
 
 In 1999, [[Nunavut]] was created as Canada's third territory, out of the eastern [[Northwest Territories]], in an agreement with the [[Inuit]] people. 
 
 == Government == 
 [[File:Centre Block and Centennial Flame (14766251442).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Parliament Hill]].]] 
 Canada has a government called a [[constitutional monarchy]]. < ref > {{cite web|author=Amanda, Briney|title=About.com: geography and overview of Canada|url=http://geography.about.com/od/atlas/a/canada.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122231021/http://geography.about.com/od/atlas/a/canada.html|archive-date=22 November 2011|access-date=November 12, 2010}} < /ref >  It has a [[monarch]] (meaning a king or queen is the head of that country), and is a [[democracy]] (meaning the people of that country rule it). The head of state is [[Charles III|King Charles III]], who is officially the King of Canada. He appoints a [[Governor General]] to represent him in the country, however, the choice of Governor General is made by the prime minister. 
 
 The King’s powers are mostly exercised by the Governor General, currently [[Mary Simon]]. The Governor General, like the Canadian sovereign (King/Queen of Canada), is not political and remains above politics, and because of that they do not usually use their powers without the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. 
 
 The head of government is the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. The current prime minister is [[Justin Trudeau]], < ref > {{cite web|author=Official Government of Canada website|title=PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/pm.asp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208030501/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/pm.asp|archive-date=8 February 2006|access-date=November 17, 2010}} < /ref >  who replaced [[Stephen Harper]] in October 2015. Each province and territory has a [[premier]] to lead its government. The day-to-day operations of the government are run by the cabinet. The cabinet is usually formed from the largest party in Parliament. 
 
 The Parliament of Canada passes the laws of the country. The governor general, acting on behalf of the monarch, has the right to [[veto]] a law (meaning the law cannot go into effect) but this right has not been used for some time. There are five main parties in the Canadian Parliament: the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], the [[New Democratic Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]], the ''[[Bloc Québécois]]'', and the [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]]. In addition to the five parties with MPs in Parliament, there are fourteen other smaller parties registered with Elections Canada and several MPs who sit as Independents.

 == Climate and its influence == 
 [[File:Northern mountains in Canada.jpg|thumb|Northern mountains in Canada. Because of it's northern geography, most of Canada is very cold, making it unlivable for humans. For this reason it has a small population which live in limited areas of the south that have less severe temperatures that humans and infrastructure can survive in. < ref > Marsden, Lorna.  " Population Issues in the Immigration Debate. "  Canadian Ethnic Studies= Etudes Ethniques au Canada 7.1 (1975): 22. < /ref > ]] 
 Because Canada is very far north, and most people cannot survive the conditions, most Canadians live in the southern parts, where the weather is much milder. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/a1-eng.cfm|title=2006 Census: Where we live? vignette - alternate format|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-01-20|archive-date=2018-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020194256/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/a1-eng.cfm|url-status=live}} < /ref >  In some cities, the temperature gets very cold in the winter, especially inland. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20090428091202/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys08b-eng.htm http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys08b-eng.htm] < /ref >  Warm air systems, moving in from the Pacific Ocean, bring more rain than snow to the Pacific coast.

 Canadians are known to play winter sports, such as [[ice hockey]] and [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]], as well as enjoy many summer sports and games. 
 
 == Natural resources == 
 [[File:Peyto Lake-Banff NP-Canada.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Peyto Lake in [[Alberta]].]] 
 Canada has lots of [[natural resource]]s. Its large amounts of [[fish]] have been used for [[century|centuries]] for food and money. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power (electricity by water) is abundant because of Canada's many rivers. < ref > {{cite web|title=Natural Resources Canada|url=http://nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/eleele/index-eng.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123122001/http://nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/eleele/index-eng.php|archive-date=23 January 2009|access-date=November 17, 2010}} < /ref >  Forests in the west are used for wood.

 == Healthcare == 
 The [[Canadian government]] provides [[universal health care]]. The [[province]]s are responsible for [[health insurance]]. Five provinces prohibit all [[extra-billing]], while [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] allow it in a small number of circumstances, and [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[New Brunswick]] do not restrict it at all. < ref > {{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Terrence James, Patricia M.
