 [[Image:Heart anterior exterior view.jpg|thumb|The heart]] 
 The '''heart''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] found in every [[vertebrate]]. It is a very strong muscle. It is on the left side of the body in humans and is about the size of a fist. It pumps [[blood]] throughout the [[body]]. It has regular '''contractions''', or when the heart squeezes the blood out into other parts of the body.  
 
 ''Cardiac'' and ''cardio'' both mean  " about the heart " , so if something has the [[prefix]] ''cardio'' or ''cardiac'', it has something to do with the heart. 
 
 [[Myocardium]] means the heart muscle: 'myo' is from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word for muscle - 'mys', cardium is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for heart - 'kardia'. 
 
 == Structure == 
 The human heart has four [[wikt:chamber|chamber]]s or closed spaces. Some animals have only two or three chambers. 
 [[File:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg |thumb|right|300px|Heart structure: Arrows show the direction of blood flow.]] 
 In humans, the four chambers are two ''atria'' and two ''ventricles''. Atria is talking about two chambers; atrium is talking about one chamber. There is a right atrium and right ventricle. These get blood that comes to the heart. They pump this blood to the [[lung]]s. In the lungs blood picks up [[oxygen]] and drops [[carbon dioxide]]. Blood from the lungs goes to the left atrium and ventricle. The left atrium and ventricle send the blood out to the body. The left ventricle works six times harder than the right ventricle because it carries oxygenated blood. < ref > {{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Phibbs |title=The human heart: a basic guide to heart disease |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins |year=2007 |page=1 |isbn=9780781767774 |edition=2nd }} < /ref >   
 
 Blood is carried in [[blood vessel]]s. These are [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s. Blood going to the heart is carried in veins. Blood going away from the heart is carried in arteries. The main artery going out of the right ventricle is the ''pulmonary artery''. (Pulmonary means about lungs.) The main artery going out of the left ventricle is the ''aorta''. 
 
 The veins going into the right atrium are the ''superior vena cava'' and ''inferior vena cava''. These bring blood from the body to the right heart. The veins going into the left atrium are the ''pulmonary veins''. These bring blood from the lungs to the left heart. 
 
 When the blood goes from the atria to the ventricles it goes through heart ''valves''. When blood goes out of the ventricles it goes through valves. The valves make sure that blood only goes one way in or out. 
 
 The four valves of the heart are: 
 * Atria to ventricle valves 
 ** ''Tricuspid valve'' – blood goes from right atrium to right ventricle 
 ** ''Mitral valve'' – blood goes from left atrium to left ventricle 
 * Ventricles to arteries 
 ** ''Pulmonic valve'' – blood goes out of the right ventricle to the lungs (through the ''pulmonic artery'') 
 ** ''Aortic valve'' – blood goes out of the left ventricle to the body (through the ''aorta'') 
 
 The heart has three layers. The outer covering is the [[pericardium]]. This is a tough sack that surrounds the heart. The middle layer is the [[myocardium]]. This is the heart muscle. The inner layer is the [[endocardium]]. This is the thin smooth lining of the chambers of the heart. < ref name= " CNX2014 " > {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J.

 == Cardiac cycle == 
 [[File:Latidos.gif|thumb|right|[[Blood]] flow through the [[heart valve]]s]] 
 A ''heart beat'' is when the heart muscle ''contracts''. This means the heart pushes in and this makes the chambers smaller. This pushes blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels. After the heart contracts and pushes in, the muscle ''relaxes'' or stops pushing in. The chambers get bigger and blood coming back to the heart fills them. 
 
 When the heart muscle contracts (pushes in) it is called ''[[systole (medicine)|systole]]''. When the heart muscle relaxes (stops pushing in), this is called ''[[diastole]]''. Both atria do systole together. Both ventricles do systole together. But the atria do systole ''before'' the ventricles. Even though the ''atrial systole'' comes before ''ventricular systole'', all four chambers do diastole at the same time. This is called ''cardiac diastole'' 
 
 The order is: atrial systole → ventricular systole → cardiac diastole. When this happens one time, it is called a ''cardiac cycle''. 
 
 == Heart's pacemaker == 
 Systole (when the heart squeezes) happens because the muscle [[cell]]s of the heart gets smaller in size. When they get smaller we also say they ''contract''. [[Electricity]] going through the heart makes the cells contract. The electricity starts in the ''sino-atrial node'' ([[acronym]] SA Node) The SA Node is a group of cells called pacemaker cells in the right atria. These cells start an ''electrical impulse''. This electrical impulse sets the rate and timing at which all cardiac muscle cells contract. This motion is called 'atrial systole'. Once electrical impulse goes through the ''atrio-ventricular node'' (AV Node). The AV Node makes the impulse slow down. Slowing down makes the electrical impulses get to the ventricles later. That is what makes the ventricular systole occur ''after'' atrial systole, and lets all the blood leave the atria before ventricle contracts (''meaning squeeze'').  
 
 After the electrical impulse goes through the AV Node, the electrical impulse will go through the ''conduction system'' of the ventricle. [[Conduction]] means [[heat]] or electricity traveling through something. This brings the electrical impulse to the ventricles. The first part of the conduction system is the ''bundle of His''. ''His'' is named for the doctor (Wilhelm His, Jr) who discovered it. Bundle means strings or wires grouped together in parallel. Once the bundle (''meaning a group of strings or wires going in parallel directions'') goes through the ventricle muscle, it divides into two ''bundle branches'', the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. The left bundle branch travels to the left ventricle and the right bundle branch travels to the right ventricle. At the end of the bundle branches, the electrical impulse goes into the ventricular muscle through the [[Purkinje Fibers]]. This is what makes ventricle contraction take place and makes ventricular systole. 
 
 The order is: 
 Sino-Atrial Node → Atria (systole) → Atrio-Ventricular Node → Bundle of His → Bundle branches → [[Purkinje Fibers]] → Ventricles (systole) 
 
 == ECG == 
 ECG is an [[acronym]] for '''E'''lectro'''C'''ardio'''G'''ram. It is also written EKG for '''E'''lectro'''K'''ardio'''G'''ram in [[German language|German]]. The ECG shows what the electricity in the heart is doing. An ECG is done by putting [[electrode]]s on a person's skin. The electrodes see the electricity going through the heart. This is written on paper by a [[machine]]. This writing on the paper is the ECG. 
 
 [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] learn about the person's heart by looking at the ECG. The ECG shows some diseases of the heart like [[heart attack]]s or problems with the ''rhythm'' of the heart (how the electricity goes through the heart's conduction system.) 
 [[File:EKG complex.png|thumbnail|275px|ECG - electrocardiogram]] 
 The ECG shows atrial systole. This is called a '''P-wave'''. Then ventricular systole happens. This is called the '''QRS''' or QRS-complex. It is called a complex because there are three different waves in it. The Q-wave, R-wave, and S-wave. Then the ECG shows ventricular diastole. This is called the '''T-wave'''. Atrial diastole happens then too. But it is not seen separate from ventricular diastole. 
 
 The '''PR-Interval''' is the space between atrial systole (P) and ventricular systole (QRS). The '''QT-Interval''' is from when the QRS starts to when the T ends. The '''ST-segment''' is the space between the QRS and T.
