 The name '''Dobro''' originated in 1928 when the Dopyera brothers formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company.  " Dobro "  is both a contraction of  " Dopyera brothers "  and a word meaning  " goodness "  in their native Slovak. This six course (6x1) guitar has a squared-off neck with raised strings for Hawaiian-style playing.
