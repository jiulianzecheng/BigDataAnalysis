'''Treason''' is when a person acts against his/ her [[country]]. For example, somebody might help another country fight a [[war]] against or loot his country by keeping secrets or failing to protect his [[country]]. In history, treason has often included the [[assassination]] of leaders. Treason against the king was called high treason and treason against a lesser role was called petty treason. A treasonous person is called a '''traitor'''.  
 
 Outside the field of law, the word  " traitor "  can be used to describe a person who betrays a group to which he or she belongs. These accusations can often be unclear when the accused do not consider themselves to be in the group. 
 
 Some famous traitors are [[Judas Iscariot]], [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Philippe Pétain]], [[La Malinche]] and [[Vidkun Quisling]]. 
 
 Persons accused of treason can be many. During the [[Reign of Terror]] many thousands were executed as traitors. After [[World War II]] many thousands of Soviet soldiers who had been [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were immediately sent to [[Gulag]] as traitors.
