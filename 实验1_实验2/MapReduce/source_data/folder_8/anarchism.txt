 '''Anarchism''' is a radically revolutionary idea that says no one should be forced into any kind of [[hierarchy]]. For example, anarchism says that the [[government]] is harmful and not needed. However, that does not mean no form of order should not exist. Municipalities and autonomy are familiar terms in Anarchism < ref name=definitions2 > ''Anarchism''.

Anarchism is also a {{c|philosophical movements and positions|philosophical movement}} and is called a [[libertarian]] type of [[socialism]]. It is not a political stance. 
 
 The word  " anarchism "  [[etymology|is from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] word  " αναρχία " , which means  " no rulers "  or  " no government " . But that doesn't have to mean no rules at all. People often use the word  " [[anarchy]] "  to mean [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and [[crime]]. But anarchists usually do not want this. They say anarchy is just a way of relations between people. They believe that, once put into place, these relations work on their own. Anarchists are usually opposed by the systems they wish to remove. 
 
 == Principles == 
 
 Individual freedom, voluntary association, and being against the [[state]] are important beliefs of anarchism. There are also big differences between anarchist philosophies on things like whether [[violence]] can be used to bring about anarchy; the best type of economy; the relationship between technology and hierarchy; the idea of equality; and the usefulness of some organization. The word  " authority "  is not clear, but anarchists are not against some types of [[authority]] (e.g. the authority of someone skilled in self-defence over someone that wants to learn self-defence), they are only against control by force.
