 '''Immurement''' (from [[Latin]]  " immurus " , meaning  "  wall in "   or  " enwall " ), '''immuration''' or '''live entombment''' is a historical form of imprisonment, generally until [[death]], in which someone is/was placed in an enclosed space with the opening walled off. Immurement has been used as a punishment and as a form of [[human sacrifice]]. As a punishment, live entombment was largely used on members of [[clergy]] ([[monk]]s, [[nun]]s and ancient Rome's [[Vestal Virgins]] for example) and others whose blood was not allowed to be spilled according to custom and or law. Also in [[Mongolia]], women who were accused of [[adultery]] were often immured in [[crate]]s which had a holes for the [[head]] and one [[arm]] to poke through. The latest documented case of immurement as a form of execution occurred in 1906 in [[Morocco]]. The one walled up in this case was a [[Serial killer]] named [[Mohammed Mesfewi]] who was originally sentenced to [[crucifixion]] before foreign dignitaries talked the Moroccan government out of crucifying Mohammed. As a form of human sacrifice, live entombment was intended to ensure that [[buildings]] and [[bridges]] remained standing. It was thought that immuring living people in this manner would bring good luck to the [[structure]]. The song  < nowiki > ''London Bridge is Falling Down'' < /nowiki >  may be about such sacrificial entombment. Usually the entombed victim would be left to dehydrate and starve to death, but sometimes they were fed regularly. In the latter case, immurement was more [[life imprisonment]] than a form of execution. There have been historical and fictional accounts of people being walled in alive. One story of fictional immuration is in the story [[The Cask of Armontillado]] by [[Edgar Allen Poe]].
