 A '''passport''' is a [[travel]] [[wikt:document|document]] that says that the person who owns it is a [[citizen]] of the country on the passport. A passport asks that the person carrying it be allowed to enter and pass through other countries. They also allow a person to re-enter their country. Passports are given by national [[government]]s. 
 
 Passports usually have a person's picture, [[signature]], date of birth, [[nationality]] and country of birth. Many countries are now issuing passports with [[biometrics|biometric]] properties. This helps confirm that the person carrying a passport is the real owner. These countries have passports that use biometrics: [[Malaysia]], [[Australia]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[Portugal]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America|United States]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Poland]], [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[India]] and the [[Republic of Korea]]. Many more countries are switching over to biometric passports because it can easily confirm the authenticity of the holder's identity. Passports are used so a stamp can be placed in it to prove that the identity of the holder has been confirmed with the immigration officials in the country of travel. 
 
 In 1920, the International Conference on Passports, Customs Formalities and Through Tickets made a law that said passports must be issued in [[French language|French]] and at least one other [[language]]. Now, many countries issue passports in [[English language|English]] and the language(s) of the issuing country.
