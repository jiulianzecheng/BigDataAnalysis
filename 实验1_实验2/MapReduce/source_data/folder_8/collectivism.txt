 [[File:Individualism  &  Collectivism.jpg |thumb |This diagram shows the basic difference between individualism and collectivism.]] 
 
 [[Collectivism]] is a kind of [[ethics]] based on people being a group. Its opposite is [[individualism]] which is based on people being [[individual]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|title=individualism {{!}} Definition, History, Philosophy, Examples,  &  Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism|access-date=2021-04-08|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref >  Collectivists focus on what's good for a whole group. Individualists focus on what's good for each person. Collectivism and individualism are {{c|Philosophical movements and positions|philosophical positions}} and are also part of [[politics]]. 
 
 The word  " individualism "  was originally used by [[socialist]]s to attack their enemies. They said that individualists were [[selfish]] for not supporting socialism. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Claeys |first=Gregory |title='Individualism,' 'Socialism,' and 'Social Science': Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800–1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}} < /ref >  Instead, individualists support people being [[independent]] and chasing their own goals. They also believe in having lots of [[freedom]]s. < ref > {{cite dictionary |title=individualism |dictionary=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=5th |year=2016 |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |via=TheFreeDictionary.com |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/individualism }} < /ref > 
 
 Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should [[compromise]] to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. < ref name=:1 > {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |authors=The Editors of Encyclopaedia |title=collectivism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism}} < /ref >  They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your [[community]], your [[government]], your [[social class]], your [[race]], or some other group. < ref name=:1/ >

 * In 1930, [[Max Weber]] compared collectivism and individualism in religion. He thought that [[Protestant]]s were more individualistic and independent, but [[Catholic]]s were more focused on [[hierarchy]] and [[community]]. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism|author=M. Weber|publisher=Routledge|year=1930|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}} < /ref > 
 * The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] described an early model of collectivism and [[individualism]] using the terms ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) and ''Gesellschaft'' (society). < ref > {{Cite book|title=Community and association|author=F. Tönnies|publisher=Harper Torchbooks|year=1957|isbn=|pages=}} < /ref >  ''Gemeinschaft'' relationships, in which communalism is prioritized, were thought to be characteristic of small, rural village communities. An anthropologist, Redfield (1941) echoed this notion in work contrasting folk society with urban society. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The folk culture of Yucatán|url=https://archive.org/details/folkcultureofyuc0000redf|last=Redfield|first=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1941|isbn=9780226706597|pages=}} < /ref > 
 * [[Geert Hofstede|Hofstede]] (1980) was highly influential in ushering in an era of cross-cultural research making comparisons along the dimension of collectivism versus individualism. Hofstede conceptualized collectivism and individualism as part of a single continuum, with each cultural construct representing an opposite pole. The author characterized individuals that endorsed a high degree of collectivism as being embedded in their social contexts and prioritizing communal goals over individual goals. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Culture's consequences|last=Hofstede|first=G.|publisher=Sage|year=1980|isbn=|location=Beverly Hills|pages=}} < /ref >
