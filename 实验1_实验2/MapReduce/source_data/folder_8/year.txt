A '''year''' is about 365 [[day]]s (except in a [[leap year]]). It is the time it takes the [[Earth]] to go completely around ([[orbit]]) the [[sun]] once. A year is actually almost 365.25 days long, but a [[calendar]] has 365 days, except in a [[leap year]], which has 366 days. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What Is a Leap Year? {{!}} NASA Space Place – NASA Science for Kids|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/leap-year/en/|access-date=2023-05-17|website=spaceplace.nasa.gov}} < /ref > 
 
 The year starts on [[January 1]] and ends on [[December 31]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], but a [[fiscal year]] or a [[school year]] can start on a different day of the year. 
 
 There are several ways used to measure the length of a year. 
 
 * a '''solar''' year, also called '''tropical year''', is based on the [[season]]s.  The [[Gregorian calendar]] is based on a tropical year of 365.2425 days.  This is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth; for example, the time from vernal [[equinox]] to vernal equinox, or from summer [[solstice]] to summer solstice.  The word  " tropical "  in this sense comes from the Greek ''tropikos'' meaning  " turn " . 
 * a '''lunar''' year is based on the [[moon]] and is usually 12 [[Month|lunar months]] (29 days, 12 [[hour]]s, 44 [[minute]]s each) or 354 days long. 
 * a '''sidereal''' year measures the time between when a selected [[star|fixed star]] is highest in the [[wikt:night|night]] [[sky]]. 
 * an '''anomalistic year''' is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun. 
 * an '''eclipse''' year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when [[eclipse]]s can happen. 
 
 Solar and lunar years are used by different [[calendar]]s for daily life. The other measurements are used by [[astronomer]]s. 
 
 * '''''Ma''''' (for meganum) — a unit of time equal to one [[million]] years. The suffix  " Ma "  is often used in scientific disciplines such as geology, paleontology, and [[astronomy]] to signify very long time periods into the past or future. The simpler term  " '''mya''' "  for  " million years ago "  is generally preferred on this wiki as being intuitively more simple for non-technical readers. 
 
 A specific [[Christian calendar|calendar]] is provided for the liturgical year.
