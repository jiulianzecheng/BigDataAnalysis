An '''opinion''' is something a person or a group of [[wikt:people|people]] think.   " What is your opinion? "  is like saying:  " What do you think about it? " 
 
 The person's answer might start with:  " In my opinion........... "  or  " I think......... " 
 
 Sometimes companies try to find out what people think about something by asking many people their opinion.  This is called an  " opinion poll "  and the people who do it are  " pollsters " .  They might be trying to find out whether people think something is good or bad, such as [[electricity]] or exercise or Wikipedia, or whether one [[politician]] or beer or sport team is better than another. 
 
 Opinions are usually contrasted with [[fact]]s. Facts are [[statement]]s which are reliably supported by [[evidence]]. Opinions may or may not turn out to be facts.
