 '''Reggae''' is a [[music genre]] that began in [[Jamaica]] in the late 1960s. Most music from Jamaica comes from the reggae style. < ref > Stephen Davis.  " Reggae. "  ''Grove Music Online''. ''Oxford Music          Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.16 Feb. 2016. < /ref > 
 
 The music has regular chops on the back beat (off-beat).  These are called “skank”, and are played by a rhythm [[guitar]]ist.  The bass [[drum]] hits on the second and fourth beat of each measure (each bar). These are called the “drop”. Reggae bands also use a bass, a keyboard or organ, and horns. 
 
 Reggae music is often used by [[Rastafarian]] groups. They are usually songs about religion, love and social problems. [[Bob Marley]] (1945-1981) was a famous reggae artist. 
 
 Famous instruments in reggae music are drums, guitar, [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]] and [[trombone]]. 
 
 Reggae was started in 1960 but became famous in the 1970s.
