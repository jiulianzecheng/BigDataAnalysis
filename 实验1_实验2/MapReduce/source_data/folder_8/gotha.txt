 '''Gotha''' is a town in [[Thuringia]], in [[Germany]]. It is the capital of the [[Gotha Rural District|District of Gotha]]. The population was 46,205 in 2004. 
 
 == History == 
 The town has existed at least since the [[8th century]], when its name was mentioned in a document signed by [[Charlemagne]], in which it appears as ''Villa Gotaha'' ( " Good Waters " ). In 1640 Gotha became the [[capital city]] of [[Saxe-Gotha]]. In the 18th century the French philosopher [[Voltaire]] stayed for a long time, and the Royal court became one of the centres of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Germany. From 1826 to 1918, Gotha was one of the two capitals of the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. 
 
 Gotha has played an important role in the Germany's workers' movement: the German [[socialism|socialist]] party ([[SPD]]) was founded in Gotha in 1875, when the Social Democratic Workers' Party, led by [[August Bebel]] and [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], and the [[General German Workers' Association]], founded by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]] joined together. The compromise was known the ''Gotha Program'' and was opposed by [[Karl Marx]]. 
 
 Gotha has also been traditionally a centre of publishing. The firm of [[Justus Perthes]] (now called [[Hermann Haack]]) began publishing the ''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' in 1763. The almanach was a very important directory of the world's major ruling dynasties and Europe's high nobility. 
 
 From 1949 to 1990 the city of Gotha was in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. 
 
 == Sights ==
