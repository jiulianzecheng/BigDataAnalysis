 '''Ceratosaurs''' are a group of [[theropod]] dinosaurs. They are defined as  " all theropods sharing a more recent common ancestry with ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' than with birds " .  
 
 Ceratosauria includes the [[Upper Jurassic]] to [[Upper Cretaceous]] theropods ''Ceratosaurus'', ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', and ''[[Abelisaurus]]'', found mainly in the [[southern hemisphere]].  
 
 The earlies known Ceratosaur is from the [[Middle Jurassic]] of [[Patagonia]], ''[[Eoabelisaurus]]''. This predates the oldest ''certainly known'' known member of the lineage by more than 40 million years. The almost complete skeleton of ''Eoabelisaurus'' shows the earliest evolutionary stages of the distinctive  abelisaurid modification of the forelimb. < ref name=Pol/ >   
 
 Originally, Ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the [[Upper Triassic]] to [[Lower Jurassic]]  ''[[Coelophysis]]'' and ''[[Dilophosaurus]]''. This [[Implication (grammar)|implied]] a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods. However, recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a natural group with other ceratosaurs, and so they are excluded from this group. < ref name=Pol > Pol, Diego  &  Rauhut, Oliver. 2012.
