It is the world's second-largest brewer measured by revenues (after the Belgian-Brazilian-American [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]) and is also a major bottler of [[Coca-Cola]].

It has operations in 80 countries world-wide and in 2009 sold around 21 billion [[litre]]s of beverages. 
 
 SABMiller's origins date back to the foundation of [[South African Breweries]] in 1895 as to serve a growing market of [[miner]]s and [[prospecting|prospectors]] in and around [[Johannesburg]]. Two years later, it became the first industrial company to list on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]]. From the early 1990s onwards, the company increasingly expanded internationally, making several acquisitions in both emerging and developed markets. In 1999, it formed a new UK-based holding company, SAB plc, and moved its primary listing to London. In May 2002, SAB plc acquired [[Miller Brewing]], forming SABMiller plc. 
 
 SABMiller has a primary listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. It has a [[market capitalisation]] of approximately £42 & nbsp;billion as of 24 October 2015, the 6th-largest of any company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange. It has a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 
 
 In October 2015, [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]  announced plans to acquire SABMiller for £69 billion ($104 billion).
