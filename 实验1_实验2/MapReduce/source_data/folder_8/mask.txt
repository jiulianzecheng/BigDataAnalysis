 A '''mask''' is a type of [[clothing]] which covers the [[face]]. It is similar to a [[veil]], but more close-fitting. 
 
 == Uses == 
 There are different reasons why people use masks. < ref name=Lommel > Lommel, Andreas 1970. ''Masks: their meaning and function''. Ferndale Editions, London. < /ref >   A person can use a mask so others do not know who they are (as when committing a [[crime]]).  Or, a mask may keep someones face safe from harm (like a [[gas]] mask so harmful gases do not get into the [[lung]]s). 
 
 There are many practical uses for masks in everyday life. Mostly, the masks used are ''semi-masks'' which cover only the bottom half of the face, the mouth and nose. An example is the use of masks in operating theatres, and 
 by wood-workers. In [[surgery]], the purpose is to keep [[bacteria]] off the patient; in wood-working the purpose is to keep [[wood]] [[fibre]]s out of the [[lung]]s. 
 
 In [[Venice|Venetian]] masks only the top half of the face is covered, to prevent recognition. [[Ice hockey]] masks, used in the [[Hannibal Lecter]] movies, cover the whole face to protect it from the hockey [[Puck (sports)|puck]] moving at high speed. 
 
 == Origin == 
 === The word === 
 The word 'mask' might have come from other languages. The [[French language|French]] ''masque'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maschera'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''máscara'', the [[Latin language|Latin]] (not classical) ''mascus/masca (meaning  " ghost " )'' or the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''maskharah (meaning  " jester "  or  " man in masquerade " )'' all use the same word. 
 
 === History === 
 One of the oldest masks found is the Death Mask. This stone mask is 9000 years old and is probably the oldest mask in the world. It is kept in Musée de la bible et Terre Sainte, Paris. 
 
 There are also three masks from the same period, kept in The Israel Museum, Jerusalem. 
 
 Masks are used in many [[magic]]al or [[shaman]]istic [[ritual]]s in non-western societies. < ref > Chris Rainier and Meg Taylor 1996. ''Where the masks still dance: New Guinea''. Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown. {{ISBN|0-8212-2261-9}} < /ref >  The [[wikt:celebrate|celebration]] or [[wikt:appease|appease]]ment of [[animism|animistic]] [[spirit]]s takes place with dance and song in ancient performances in many parts of the world. In these events performers use costumes and masks to mimic the supposed spirits. < ref > John Emigh 1996. ''Masked performance''. University of Pennsylvania Press. {{ISBN|081221336X}} < /ref > 
 
 From this kind of beginning, the use of masks in [[ancient Greek theatre]] may have started. The [[actor]]s and [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in this early [[theatre]] all used masks. 
 
 == Masks in recent times == 
 Masks have been used to protect people against air-borne diseases. They were worn during the [[plague]] in the [[Middle Ages]]; < ref > This was not caused by an airbourn virus, but by close association with rats. < /ref >  during the [[influenza]] epidemic of 1918, and the [[COVID-19]] epidemic. Gas masks were issued in [[World War II]] even though [[phosgene]] gas was never used in that war (it had been in [[WWI]]). 
 
 === 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic === 
 During the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, a new variation of [[trikini]], with two pieces for the body and a face mask was designed. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Prasad |first1=Amrita PrasadAmrita |title=Bikinis, saris or LBDs: Post corona, all your outfits may come with matching masks in 2020 |url=https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/bikinis-saris-or-lbds-post-corona-all-your-outfits-may-come-with-matching-masks-in-2020/articleshow/75388567.cms |accessdate=28 April 2020 |work=Bangalore Mirror |language=en}} < /ref >  Indian film actress [[Kajol]] popularized the idea of this trikini. < ref > {{cite news |title=What Kajol Thinks A Trikini Suitable For 2020 Should Look Like |url=https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/what-kajol-thinks-a-trikini-suitable-for-2020-should-look-like-2214889 |accessdate=28 April 2020 |work=NDTV.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Figurative uses == 
 There are some other uses of the word 'mask', which arise by extension. That means using 'mask' as a [[metaphor]]. In [[Movie|film]] a mask is a screen which cuts out part of the image. In [[social theory]], a mask is the [[behaviour]] a person takes on in his [[role]] or job. Thus [[police]]men, head [[teacher]]s, [[army]] [[commander]]s, [[prime minister]]s act as they are expected to act (most of the time). The [[Implication (grammar)|inference]] is that behind the mask is the 'real' person. Their role is a mask. As a verb, 'to mask' means to cover or hide.
