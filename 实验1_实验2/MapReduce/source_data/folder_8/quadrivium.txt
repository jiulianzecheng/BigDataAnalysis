The '''Quadrivium''' is the [[medieval]] [[education]] which led to the [[Master of Arts]] (MA) [[Degree (school)|degree]]. The Quadrivium follows the [[Trivium (liberal arts)|Trivium]] in a [[liberal arts]] education. 
 
 The quadrivium consisted of four [[Wikt:discipline|disciplines]] which were related to [[mathematics]]: 
 *[[Arithmetic]] (numbers) 
 *[[Geometry]] (space) 
 *[[Music]] (time: harmonics) 
 *[[Astronomy]] (time and space) 
 
 These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in ''[[The Republic]]''. < ref name=nie > [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Quadrivium New International Encyclopedia. 1905] < /ref >   
 
 All the education was done in [[Latin]], which educated pupils learnt at school, or from a private [[tutor]]. Latin was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' (universal language) of mediaeval [[Europe]]: even the [[Bible]] could only be read in Latin. Since the quadrivium was taught in [[University|universities]], only boys could take it (because only males took part in universities). The teaching was done by [[priest]]s. If girls wanted education, it had to be done in their homes. In the modern form of liberal arts in the [[United States]], both sexes are taught, although there are still a few single-sex institutions.
