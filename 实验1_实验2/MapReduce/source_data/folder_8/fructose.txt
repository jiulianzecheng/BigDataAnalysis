 '''Fructose''' is a simple [[sugar]] ([[monosaccharide]]) found in many foods. It is also one of the three most important [[blood sugar]]s, the other two are [[glucose]] and [[galactose]]. [[Honey]]; tree fruits; [[berry|berries]]; [[melon]]s; and some root vegetables, such as beets, [[sweet potato]]es, [[parsnip]]s and [[onion]]s, contain fructose, usually with [[sucrose]] and glucose. Processed foods also contain fructose due to how sweet it is. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Fructose intolerance: Which foods to avoid?|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/fructose-intolerance/expert-answers/faq-20058097|access-date=2021-05-10|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|archive-date=2014-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325222914/https://www.mayoclinic.org/fructose-intolerance/expert-answers/faq-20058097|url-status=live}} < /ref >
