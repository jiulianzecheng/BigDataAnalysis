 '''Simmering''' is a method of cooking in water, where the temperature is kept just below that where the water would [[boiling|boil]]. 
 
 The temperature at which this is achieved is around {{convert|95|C|F}}. 
 
 To bring water to the point where it simmers, you first heat the water to [[boiling|boiling point]], which is {{convert|100|C|F}}, then reduce the heat so that the bubbles on top of the water have almost stopped.
