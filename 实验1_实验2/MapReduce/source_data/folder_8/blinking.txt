 '''Blinking''' is something that the [[body]] does. It is a fast closing and then reopening of the [[eyelid]]s. It is [[autonomic nervous system|semi-autonomic]], meaning the person doesn't have to think about blinking to do it. People blink to keep the [[eye]]s wet by spreading [[water]] from the [[tear duct]]s around the eyes. < ref name= " d.umn.edu " > {{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~jfitzake/Lectures/DMED/Vision/Optics/Blinking.html|title=Blinking}} < /ref >  Blinking can also be used to spread feeling, in [[body language]].
