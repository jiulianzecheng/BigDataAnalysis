 '''Lactase''' is an [[enzyme]] which acts on [[lactose]], breaking it down so it can be digested.  
 
 [[Mammal]]s in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's [[milk]]. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult [[cat]] it causes discomfort and [[diarrhea]]. 
 
 == Lactase evolution in humans == 
 Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of [[polymorphism]]. < ref name= " Itan, Yuval 2010. P36 "  / > 
 
 The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of [[animal husbandry]]. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk.  
 
 [[Hunter-gatherer]] populations before the [[Neolithic revolution]] were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. < ref name= " Swaminathan2007 "  / > < ref name= " MalmstromEtal2010 "  / >  So are modern hunter-gatherers.  
 
 === Genetics === 
 A [[mutation]] on [[chromosome]] #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives. 
 
 This appears to be a recent [[adaptation]] to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern [[Europe]] and [[East Africa]] in populations with a [[pastoral]] lifestyle. < ref name= " autogenerated1 "  / >  Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a [[dominant]] [[allele]], making lactose intolerance a [[recessive]] [[Trait (biology)|trait]].  
 
 Genetic studies suggest that the oldest [[mutation]]s associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. < ref name= " CoehloEtal2002 "  / > < ref name= " BersaglieriEtal2004 "  / >  Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of [[Human evolution#Recent and current human evolution|recent human evolution]]. < ref name= " Wade2006 "  / > < ref name= " Swaminathan2006 "  / >  As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is [[gene]]–[[culture]] [[coevolution]]. < ref name= " Aoki2001 "  / >
