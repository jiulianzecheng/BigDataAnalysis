 '''Rhabdomyolysis''' is where damaged [[Skeletal muscle|skeletal muscles]] quickly break down. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2016-07-18|title=What Is Rhabdomyolysis?|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/rhabdomyolysis|access-date=2020-09-28|website=Healthline|language=en}} < /ref >  The symptoms can be [[myalgia|muscle pains]], weakness, [[vomiting]], and [[mental confusion|confusion]]. There can also be [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and tea-colored urine. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Rhabdomyolysis: Symptoms, Treatments|url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21184-rhabdomyolysis|access-date=2020-09-29|website=Cleveland Clinic}} < /ref >  Rhabdomyolysis can also injure the [[kidney]]s with [[myoglobin]]. 
 
 The most common causes of Rhabdomyolysis are [[Crush syndrome|crush injury]], strenuous exercise, [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]], or [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Rhabdomyolysis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000473.htm|access-date=2020-09-29|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 During rhabdomyolysis, a protein that stores oxygen in the muscles called [[myoglobin]] is released into the blood. The kidneys filter the blood and remove the myoglobin. However, the myoglobin breaks down into other chemicals which damages the kidneys which can cause severe injury or even death.
