 '''Mercantilism''' is a kind of [[economy|economic system]] that was present in most parts of [[Europe]] between the 16th and the 18th century.  
 
 The term was first used by [[Gabriel de Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Marquis de Mirabeau]] in 1794. [[Adam Smith]] made it known to a wider audience in 1776. At that time, [[absolutism]] was the main form of government in Europe. These [[regime]]s needed money to finance a large [[military]], the many people who worked in the government. The monarchs and princes also needed money in order to finance their lifestyle. These governments were also very [[nationalism|nationalistic]]. For this reason, mercantilism is seen as a form of [[economic nationalism]]. < ref name=econlib > {{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-14 |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Mercantilism.html |title=Mercantilism |publisher=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics }} < /ref >   
 
 The theory of mercantilism holds that the prosperity of a nation depends on its supply of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], and that the [[world economy|global volume]] of [[international trade]] is  " unchangeable " . Economic assets (or capital) are [[bullion]] (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state, and is best increased through a positive [[balance of trade]] with other nations (exports minus imports).  
 
 The theory assumes that wealth and monetary assets are identical. Mercantilism suggests that the ruling government should advance these goals by playing a [[protectionism|protectionist]] role in the economy by encouraging exports and discouraging imports, notably through the use of [[tariff|tariffs]] and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. < ref = " definition " > {{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Mercantilism.html|title=Mercantilism|last=LaHaye|first=Laura|publisher=Library Fund, Inc.|accessdate=2008-10-27}} < /ref >  The theory dominated [[Western Europe]]an economic policies from the 16th to the late-18th century. < ref name=econlib / >
