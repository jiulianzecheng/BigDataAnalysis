 A '''teletypewriter''' (TTY; also called a '''teletype''' or '''teleprinter''') is a [[device]] that sends a [[Typing|typed]] message to another place. A teletypewriter has a [[typewriter]] keyboard, a local [[printer]] (so the user can see what has been typed) and a [[transmitter]]. Messages can be sent over wires or [[radio]] waves. Teletypes were used mostly in the early to mid-20th century. They were developed to improve [[telegraph]]s, some of which also used keyboards, though not typewriter keyboards. 
 
 Though teleprinters have been replaced by other technologies, TDDs ([[Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf]]), which are based on the idea and design of teletypes, are still used these days. Not all people who are [[deaf]], hard of hearing, or speech-impaired have switched to using [[instant messaging]] or [[SMS|texting]] or other modern services. Many still type messages back and forth to one another by TDD.
