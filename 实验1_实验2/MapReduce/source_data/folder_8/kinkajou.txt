 The '''kinkajou''' is a [[mammal]] of the family [[Procyonidae]] and it is related to the [[raccoon]], [[coati]], [[olingo]], [[raingtail]] and [[cacomistle]]. It lives in the [[rainforest]]s of [[South America]] and [[Central America]], and spends most of its time on trees. It can [[omnivore|eat both meat and plants]] and has a [[prehensile tail|gripping tail]] that can be used like an arm. It is an endangered species because it is being hunted for its fur, meat and to be illegally sold as pets. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 
 Although kinkajous may look like [[monkey]]s, [[lemur]]s, [[koala]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[bear]]s or [[ferret]]s, they are not related to those animals. An adult kinkajou's weight is between 1-3 kg (3-7 lb). Its body can grow up to 43-56 cm long (17-22 in) and its tail usually measures between 16-22 cm (41- 56 in). The kinkajou has woolly fur consisting of an outer golden (brownish-gray) coat and another gray coat underneath.
