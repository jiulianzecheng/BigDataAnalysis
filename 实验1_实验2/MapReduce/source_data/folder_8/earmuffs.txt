'''Earmuffs''' are [[Wikt:object|objects]] that are made to cover and protect a person's [[ear]]s. A [[plastic]] or [[metal]] band fits over the top of the head, and there are two pads at the ends that cover the ears warmly.

 Chester Greenwood invented the earmuffs when he was 15. < ref name= " maine " > {{cite web|url=https://www.maine.gov/sos/kids/about/people/c_greenwood.htm|title=Maine Secretary of State Kids: Chester Greenwood|website=www.maine.gov|access-date=2019-02-14|archive-date=2018-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180528012749/http://www.maine.gov/sos/kids/about/people/c_greenwood.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blgreenwood.htm{{Dead link|date=August 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Chester Greenwood - Earmuffs < /ref >  His [[ear]]s would turn into unusual colors like red, white, purple, or blue and begin to hurt when it was cold (he lived in [[Maine]]). < ref name=aha > Caney, Steven.

Chester had tried wrapping a [[scarf]] around his head, but it was too bulky. < ref name=aha/ > < ref name=squish/ >  So Chester twisted some wire so that it went across the top of his head, and made a loop on each end near his ears. Then he asked his grandmother to sew some [[material]] on the end of each loop. She put black [[velvet]] on the inside of the ears, and [[beaver|beaver fur]] on the outside of each loop, then sewed the wire across Chester's hat to make it stay. < ref name=aha/ > < ref name=squish/ >  Soon lots of people in his town wanted ear warmers like Chester's, and he opened a factory when he was 19 to make them.  Each year, his home town ([[Farmington]]) celebrates his invention with a parade on  " Chester Greenwood Day.

 == Types of earmuffs == 
 There are two kinds of earmuffs: ''thermal earmuffs'', which keep a person's ears warm, and ''acoustic earmuffs'', also called ''ear defenders'', which block out a lot of [[sound]] and noise and can be used in construction (building) sites, for example, when jackhammering. < ref name= " EN-2021 " > {{cite book |last1=Technical Committee CEN/TC 159 “Hearing protectors” |title=EN 17479-2021.
