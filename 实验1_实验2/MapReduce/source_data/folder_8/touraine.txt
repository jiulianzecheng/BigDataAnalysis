'''Touraine''' ({{IPA-fr|tuʁɛn}}) is one of the traditional [[province]]s of [[France]]. Its capital was [[Tours]]. In 1790 France changed from being divided into provinces to being divided into [[Departments of France|departments]].{{efn|Departments have less political power than provinces had.}} Touraine was divided between the [[departments of France|department]]s of [[Indre-et-Loire]], [[:Loir-et-Cher]] and [[Indre (department)|Indre]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 
 Touraine has a network of rivers. The [[Loire River|Loire]] and its tributaries the [[Cher (river)|Cher]], the [[Indre River|Indre]] and the [[Vienne (river)|Vienne]] all make up a part of the Paris river basin. It is well known for its [[wine]]. < ref > Francis Miltoun, ''Castles and chateaux of old Touraine and the Loire country'' (Boston: L. C. Page  &  Co., 1906), p. 129 < /ref >  The [[TGV]] connects Tours with Paris. The trip takes less than an hour. This has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the capital but seek a different quality of life. 
 
 ==History== 
 Touraine takes its name from a [[Celt]]ic tribe called the [[Turones]], who inhabited the Tours region about two thousand years ago.   
 In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the [[Count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]]. This same [[:wikt:dynasty|dynasty]] who (as the [[House of Plantagenet]]) became kings of England in 1154. The castle of [[Chinon]] was their great [[:wikt:stronghold|stronghold]]. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a [[Duchy]]. In 1429, [[Joan of Arc|Saint Joan of Arc]] had a historic meeting with the future [[King of France]] [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] at [[Chinon]]. Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French [[king]]s. The castles were converted to Renaissance [[:en:wikt:châteaux|châteaux]]; for this reason the region was titled  " The Garden of France " . These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times. The royal duchy became a province in 1584, and was divided into [[:wikt:departments|departments]] in 1790.
