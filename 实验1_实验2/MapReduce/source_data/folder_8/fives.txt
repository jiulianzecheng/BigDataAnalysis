'''Fives''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] sport believed to come from the same origins as many [[racket]] sports. In fives, a ball is propelled against the walls of a special court using gloved or bare hands as though they were a racquet.  
 
 == Background == 
 
 The name may be derived from the [[slang]] expression  " a bunch of fives "  (meaning a fist). The game has also been known as '''hand-tennis''' and historically was often played between the [[buttress]]es of [[church]] buildings in [[England]]. There are links between Fives and the [[Gaelic handball|Irish]] and [[American handball|North American]] handball games and indeed, in recent years, British clubs have begun to establish ties with clubs in those countries. 
 
 Fives is not the same as Long Fives, which is played in a [[real tennis]] court. 
 
 There are two main forms of the game Rugby Fives and Eton Fives.  
 Eton Fives is played competitively as a doubles game, whilst Rugby Fives is played as both a singles and a doubles game.
