 '''Klushino''' ({{lang-rus|Клушино||ˈkluʂɨnə}}) is a village in [[Smolensk Oblast]], [[Russia]]. It is located between [[Vyazma]] and [[Mozhaysk]], and is not far from the city of Gzhatsk (now called [[Gagarin, Smolensk Oblast|Gagarin]]). [[Battle of Klushino|A major battle]] of the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Polish–Muscovite War]] took place in Klushino. 
 
 [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man in [[outer space]], was born in Klushino in 1934. The house Gagarin was born in is no longer in Klushino. When Gagarin's family moved to Gzhatsk, his father took apart the house. His father then moved the pieces of the house, and put them back together in Gzhatsk. A [[:wikt:replica|replica]] of Gagarin's house was built in Klushino in 1971. The replica house is now a museum. < ref > {{cite web | publisher=[[BBC]] | title=Yuri Gagarin's Klushino: Forgotten home of space legend | author=Katia Moskvitch | date= April 4, 2011 | access-date=February 27, 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-12875848}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | publisher=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] | title=Yuri Gagarin: tour to the birthplace | author=Sergey Panarin | date= March 31, 2017 | access-date=February 27, 2020 | url=https://futuretravel.today/yuri-gagarin-tour-to-the-birthplace-6bcbac30352e}} < /ref >
