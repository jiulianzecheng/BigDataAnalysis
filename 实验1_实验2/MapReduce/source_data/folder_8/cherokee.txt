 The '''Cherokee''' ([[Cherokee language|Cherokee]]: ᎠᏂᏴᏫᏯᎢ, romanized: ''Aniyvwiyaʔi'' or ''Anigiduwagi'') are [[Native American]]s who at the time of European contact in the [[16th century]] lived in the area  that is now called the eastern and southeastern [[United States]] before most were forcefully moved to the [[Ozarks|Ozark hills]]. They were one of the tribes referred to as the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. 
 
 Cherokee people did not live in [[tepee]]s. They lived in houses made from wood. In the [[19th century]], a man named [[Sequoyah]] introduced a form of writing the Cherokee language. For this, he was awarded a medal.[[Image:Rosecottageparkhill.png|thumb|This house belonged to Chief John Ross, in Park Hill, Oklahoma.]]The Cherokee tribe had two chiefs, a red and white chief. When the tribe was at war, the red chief would lead, and when there was peace within the tribe, the white chief would lead. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61367206|title=American Indian religious traditions : an encyclopedia|last=Crawford O'Brien|first=Suzanne|date=2005|others=Dennis F.
