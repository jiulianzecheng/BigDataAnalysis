 A '''desert''' is an arid (dry) [[biome]]. They get less than {{convert|25|cm|abbr=in}} of [[rainfall]] a year. It is  " any region that can have a [[moisture]] deficit over the course of a year " . In other words, they can have less [[rainfall]] in a year than they give up through [[evaporation]] " . < ref > [http://www.universetoday.com/65639/what-percentage-of-the-earths-land-surface-is-desert/ Universe Today] < /ref > < ref > Marshak 2009. Essentials of Geology, 3rd ed. W.W. Norton. p452. ISBN 978-0-393-19656-6 < /ref > 
 
 Including the semi-arid regions, deserts may cover about 33% of the land on Earth. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/what/ |title=What Is a Desert? |work=pubs.usgs.gov |date=December 18, 2001 |access-date=April 9, 2011}} < /ref >  That includes much of [[Antarctica]], where large areas get no snow at all. The largest hot desert is the [[Sahara]] desert, in northern [[Africa]], covering nine million square kilometres. 
 
 Deserts land surfaces are varied. Examples are stones, [[sand dunes]] and [[snow]]. They may have some [[animals]] and [[plants]]. Deserts sometimes expand ([[desertification]]), and sometimes contract.  
 
 Deserts are mostly in the western part of the [[Americas]], [[Western Asia]], Central and western [[Australia]], [[Namibia]] and [[North Africa]]. Some, such as the [[Sahara]], are very hot during the day and have cold nights, but there are also cold deserts such as the [[Atacama]] in South America which are frozen day and night. < ref name= " brittanica "   > {{cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-70815/desert | title = Desert | access-date = 2008-02-09 | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica online}} < /ref > 
 
 == Cold deserts == 
 Cold deserts can be found close to the [[polar circle|poles]]. That is why they are also called '''polar deserts'''. Other regions of the world have cold deserts too, for instance high [[altitude]] areas like the [[Himalayas]]. These are called '''montane deserts'''. [[Antarctica]] is the world's largest cold desert. The second largest one is the [[Arctic]] desert, but that has started to warm up now. 
 
 == Hot deserts ==  
 Hot deserts are mostly in the [[subtropics]]. They can be covered by [[sand]], [[rock (geology)|rock]], salt lakes, stony hills and even [[mountain]] < nowiki/ > s. Most non-polar deserts are hot in the day and chilly at night. The [[temperature]] in the daytime can reach {{cvt|50|C}} or higher in the summer, and dip to {{cvt|0|C}} or lower at night time in the winter. The '''largest''' hot desert in the world is the [[Sahara]] in North Africa. It is almost as large as Europe or the United States. 
 
 == Atacama == 
 The [[Atacama Desert|Atacama desert]] may not have had any significant rainfall from 1570 to 1971.

 It may be the oldest desert on Earth. It has been a desert for at least three million years. It may be the oldest continuously arid region on Earth. < ref name=ucmp2 > {{cite journal |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound/docs/sdarticle.pdf |title=Antiquity of aridity in the Chilean Atacama Desert |author=Jonathan D.A.

 == Rain == 
 It does [[rain]] in the desert, but not often. One place in the Atacama Desert had no rain for 400 years. In other deserts it may rain every year or once every few years.  Rains in a desert may bring a great amount of water to the ground in a short time. Some rain passes straight into the dry soil, but the rest may form a temporary river.  [[Wadi]]s, stream channels that are normally dry, can quickly fill after heavy rain, causing a [[flash flood]].  
 
 People sometimes bring water from wet places to hot deserts so plants can grow. This is called [[irrigation]]. 
 
 == Sandstorm == 
 A sandstorm or [[dust storm]] arises when wind blows loose [[sand]] and dust from a dry surface. Clouds of sand or dust are often so dense that they blot out the Sun. A sandstorm can move whole [[dune|sand dunes]]. Sandstorms are common in large, dusty deserts. 
 
 == Animals and plants == 
 There are not many animals in the desert, but some [[animals]] are able to survive. They have different ways to survive the intense conditions of the desert. Examples of animals that live in hot deserts are lizards, small rodents, [[snake]]s, and [[camel]]s. Plants and animals in hot deserts must live with very little water.  
 
 [[Xerophytic]] plants which live in the desert have special [[adaptation]]s. They may survive by growing roots that are very near the surface to absorb the rain that may fall before it evaporates. Plants such as the [[cactus]] have thick, fleshy stems that help them store water. 
 
 Small animals such as [[lizard]]s and small [[rodent]]s often escape the hot rays by digging underground burrows where they live. They only come out at night to search for food. Like the plants, desert animals must live on as little water as possible. Most of the water used by these animals comes from seeds and stems that absorb and hold water. Camels survive in hot deserts by storing water in body fat in their humps. Like other desert animals, the camel loses little water in its wastes ([[urine]] and [[feces]]). 
 
 == Biggest deserts == 
 # [[Antarctica]]: 14,200,000 sq kms 
 # [[Arctic]]: 13,900,000 sq kms 
 # [[Sahara]]: 9,200,000 sq kms 
 # [[Australia]]: 2,700,000 sq kms 
 # [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]: 2,330,000 sq kms 
 # [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]]: 1,298,000 sq kms
