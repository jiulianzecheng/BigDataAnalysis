 The '''Danelaw''' (from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Old English]] ''Dena lagu'', [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Danelagen'' ) is an 11th-century name for an area of northern and eastern [[England]]. This area was under the [[administration|administrative]] control of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Viking]] empire (or Danes, or Norsemen) from the late [[9th century]] until the early [[11th century]]. 
 
 As can be seen from the map, Danelaw at its height was ''about a third the territory of England''. < ref >
