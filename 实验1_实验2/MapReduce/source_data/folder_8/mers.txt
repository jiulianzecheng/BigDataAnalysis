 '''MERS''' (the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) was discovered in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 2012. It is a disease caused by a [[coronavirus]] whose label is '''MERS-CoV'''. MERS-CoV is a betacoronavirus which originated in [[bats]]. 
 
 Coronaviruses are a family of [[viruses]] some of which cause [[common cold]]s. They can infect both animals and people. MERS is a relative of [[SARS]] (the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus which swept around the world, infecting more than 8,000 people globally and killing 774 before it was stopped in 2004. 
 
 In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] made itself some rules for naming viruses: No official name is allowed to refer to a place, person or animal. This is to prevent [[stigma]], or blame.  The WHO rules list MERS as an example of what not to do when naming a virus or disease. < ref name= " Time " > {{cite news|url    = https://time.com/5782284/who-name-coronavirus-covid-19/|title  = What's in a Name?
