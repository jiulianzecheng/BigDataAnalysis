 '''Cuneiform script''' is one of the earliest known [[writing system|systems of writing]]. < ref > [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] also have a claim, and it is unsettled which system began first.

The name ''cuneiform'' itself means  " wedge shaped " , from the Latin ''cuneus''  " wedge "  and ''forma''  " shape " . It came into [[English language|English]] usage probably from the [[Old French]] ''cun√©iforme.'' 
 
 It was first used in [[Sumer]] in the late 4th millennium [[BC]] (the 'Uruk IV' period). Cuneiform writing began as a system of [[pictogram|pictographs]]. In the third millennium, the signs became simplified and more abstract. Fewer characters were used, from about 1,000 in the early [[Bronze Age]] to about 400 in late Bronze Age ([[Hittite]] cuneiform). The system  used a combination of phonetic, consonantal alphabetic (no [[vowels]]) and [[syllable|syllabic]] signs. < ref name= " Lo " > {{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/sumerian.html|title=Sumerian|last=Lo|first=Lawrence|year=2007|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}

 The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Eblaite]], [[Elam]]ite, [[Hittite]], [[Luwian]], [[Hattic]], [[Hurrian]], and [[Urartian language|Urartian]] languages, and it inspired the [[Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian]] alphabets. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the [[Phoenician alphabet]] during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. By the 2nd century BC, the script was extinct. All knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century.
