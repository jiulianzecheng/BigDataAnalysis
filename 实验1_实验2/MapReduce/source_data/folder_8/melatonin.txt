 Melatonin is produced in the [[pineal gland]] which is outside of the [[blood–brain barrier]]. It acts as a hormone, and is released into the blood. < ref name= " pmid19075654 " > {{cite journal | author = Kaur C.  &  Ling E.A. | title = Antioxidants and neuroprotection in the adult and developing central nervous system | journal = Curr.
