 '''Heliocentrism''' is the idea that the [[Earth]] and other [[planet]]s revolve around the [[Sun]], which is the center of the [[solar system]]. < ref > [[#soed|The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed., 2007)]] < /ref >  Many people proposed heliocentrism, such as [[Aristarchus of Samos]] from [[ancient Greece]], < ref > [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|Dreyer (1953)]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/n148/mode/2up pp.135–48)]; [[#CiTEREFLinton2004|Linton (2004)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC & pg=PA38 pp.38–9)]. < /ref >  but [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was the first to think of good reasons why it is true.

 Before Copernicus, most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth (this was called [[geocentrism]]). This is because if you stand on Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. However, when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the Earth was the center of the Solar system. For example, sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the Earth. Copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543, when he published the book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' ( " On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres " ). This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead. 
 
 Other [[astronomer]]s who made further advances after Copernicus were [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. For example, Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles, and Galileo built very good [[telescope]]s that helped to confirm the heliocentric model. 
 
 Copernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the [[universe]], but we now know that this is incorrect. The Sun is part of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] which is one out of billions of galaxies.
