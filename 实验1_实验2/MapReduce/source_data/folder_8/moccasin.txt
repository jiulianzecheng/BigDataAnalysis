A '''moccasin''' is a shoe made of [[deer]]skin or any other soft [[leather]]. It has a sole and sides made out of a single piece of leather. It is stitched together toward the top, sometimes with vamps (which are additional panels of leather). The soles are usually soft and flexible. Moccasins are usually worn outside. The shoes protect the foot while allowing whomever wears them to feel the ground.
