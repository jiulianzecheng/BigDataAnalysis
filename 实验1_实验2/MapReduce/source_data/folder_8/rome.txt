 '''Rome''' ([[Latin]]: ''Roma'') is the [[capital city]] of [[Italy]]. It is also the capital and largest city in the ''[[Regions of Italy|region]]'' of [[Lazio]], and the geographical region of [[Latium]]. It is on the [[Tiber]] [[River]] and has 2.8 million people. An estimate by the [[OECD]] put the number of people of the city area of Rome at 3.47 million. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF|title=Competitive Cities in the Global Economy|author=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2009-04-30|archive-date=2007-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614043229/http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  When the [[Roman Empire]] was new, Rome was called the ''Eternal City'' because it was already very old. 
 
 Rome is well known for being the home of the [[Catholic Church]], including its leader, the [[Pope]]. He lives in the [[Vatican City]], which is an [[enclave]] in the north-west part of Rome. 
 
 == History == 
 Nothing is known for sure about the founding of [[ancient Rome]]; it is [[prehistoric]]. The [[myth]] of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]] is often told. They were supposedly raised by a she-[[wolf]]. Romulus killed Remus, and became the first king of Rome, for some time Romulus ruled alongside a Sabine King a neighboring tribe. There is no historical [[evidence]] of this, but the story is popular. [[Numa Pompilius]] was the next king. 
 
 With the overthrow of the [[Roman Kingdom]] began the Republican era. The new [[Roman Republic]] fought and conquered the people around it. In [[390 BC]], the town was invaded by [[Gauls]]. Between the third and second century BC, Rome fought against the rival [[Carthage]]. The Roman army captured and destroyed Carthage. 
 
 Only with [[Julius Caesar]] in the first century BC, did the city began to grow significantly, especially toward the Campo Marzio, at the north of [[Capitoline Hill]], and its domain was extended to [[Britannia]]. Caesar was never crowned emperor, a title which, however, fell to his adopted son Octavian who took the throne under the name of Augustus. 
 
 [[Augustus]]  " found a city of bricks and left it [[marble]] " . With him, Rome reached one million inhabitants and this was the first time in history that has happened in the world. Later emperors also added new monuments, temples, and triumphal arches to [[ancient Rome]]. 
 
 With the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], the city declined in importance and fell into ruin. [[Pope Gregory I]] created major reforms for the people. The city was ruled by the [[pope]], and soon also became the capital of a state, the [[Papal States]], which remained active until the [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. Popes, like the emperors, became richer over the centuries and the same happened with the counties ruled by them. 
 
 Rome experienced a second  " rebirth "  in importance during the Italian [[Renaissance]]. The city of monuments and churches was called the  " capital of [[Christendom]] " , as the home of the [[Basilica]] di San Giovanni Laterano, the most important church of the world. The masterpieces of the Renaissance geniuses, like [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], embellished the city. 
 
 The power of the Pope lessened along with its state. 
 
 But with the Italian [[Risorgimento]] Rome experienced a third  " rebirth " . On September 20 1870, [[Garibaldi]]'s army, which had the task of uniting all of Italy under the [[House of Savoy|crown of Savoy]], entered the city through a breach opened in the walls at Porta Pia and, the same year, Rome became the capital of the new Italian state. In a few decades Rome grew to be one of the most important capitals of [[Europe]] and of the world: in 1936 it was the capital of the ''Italian Empire'', even if for a few years because of the second world war. 
 
 Today, Rome is a major European political and cultural center, containing the [[headquarters]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]]. There are also numerous [[museum]]s, [[basilica]]s and [[palace]]s, such as the [[Colosseum]], and, in the Vatican City, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], a brilliant example of the architecture of the [[Renaissance]] which can be found all over Rome. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Rome stands on seven hills, with an area of {{cvt|1285.31|km2}}. The city is crossed by two rivers: the [[Tiber]], which runs from east to west, and l'[[Aniene]], which runs from north-east to north ‚Äì within the city, it flows into the Tiber. Rome was built on Sun Hill, later named ''Palatine''. It grew and covered seven principal hills, which are now the inner city of Rome: 
 * [[Palatine]] 
 * [[Aventine]] 
 * [[Capitoline]] 
 * [[Quirinal]] 
 * [[Viminal]] 
 * [[Esquiline]] 
 * [[Caelian]] 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 Rome has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K√∂ppen climate classification]]: Csa), with cool, humid winters and warm, dry summers. Its average annual temperature is above 20¬∞C (68¬∞F) during the day and 10¬∞C (50¬∞F) at night. 
 
 ==Education== 
 The children in Rome have to go to school from the age of six until 16. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/06296l.htm|title=Law 27 December 2007, n.296|publisher=Italian Parliament|language=Italian|accessdate=30 September 2012|archive-date=6 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206012402/http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/06296l.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This takes them to the middle of [[high school]] (''Scuola secondaria di secondo grado''). Rome has the biggest university in Italy and it is named University of Rome. It was created in [[1303]]. About 200,000 students go to study at this university. 
 
 ==Transport== 
 Rome has an [[airport]], which is named [[Leonardo da Vinci International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: FCO). There is a fast train that goes between the airport and the city center, the ''Leonardo Express'', and many [[Commuting|commuter]] [[rail transport|railway lines]] to the nearby [[suburb]]s, along with long-distance [[train]]s to other cities in Italy. In the city itself, [[public transport]] consists of three [[Rapid transit|metro]] lines (A, B, and C), six [[tram]] lines, and many [[bus]] routes.
