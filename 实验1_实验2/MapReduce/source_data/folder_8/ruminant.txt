 A '''ruminant''' is an [[ungulate]] that eats and digests plant-based food such as [[grass]].  
 
 Ruminating mammals include [[cattle]], [[goats]], [[sheep]], [[giraffes]], [[bison]], [[Yak|yaks]], [[water buffalo]], [[deer]], [[camels]], [[Alpaca|alpacas]], [[Llama|llamas]], [[wildebeest]], [[antelope]], [[pronghorn]], and [[nilgai]]. All of them are [[Artiodactyl]] < nowiki/ > a, cloven-hoofed animals. < ref > Fernández, Manuel Hernández  &  Vrba, Elisabeth S. 2005.

 The word  " ruminant "  comes from the Latin word ''ruminare'' which means  " to [[chew]] over again " . They have a more complex digestive system than other vegetarians. Digestion of food is always done mainly by microorganisms, and in ruminants it is digested twice. 
 
 An example of a grass-eater which is ''not'' a ruminant is the [[horse]]. Horse [[excrement]] leaves the work of digestion half-done. This is very obvious to see in comparison to that of a ruminant. 
 
 == How rumination works == 
 [[File:Abomasum (PSF).png|thumb|right|230px|Rough illustration of a ruminant digestive system]] 
 
 Rumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested '''cud''' to re-chew it and to get the most food value out of it. 
 
 Rumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller, before they can go through the process of digestion. 
 
 === Details === 
 The primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants (such as people, horses, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach.  
 
 The four parts of the stomach are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or [[bolus]].  
 
 The cud is then regurgitated (brought up to the mouth) and chewed slowly. Fiber, especially [[cellulose]], is broken down by microbial [[gut flora]] ([[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[protozoa]], and [[fungi]]). 
 
 Even though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they are the same functional space, as the digesta (food material) can move back and forth between them.   
 
 The digesta then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.  
 
 After this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. Digestion takes place here.   
 
 The digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where [[nutrient]]s are absorbed. Water is absorbed in the [[large intestine]], leaving the waste. 
 
 Almost all the [[glucose]] produced by breaking down cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen, and so ruminants get little [[glucose]] from the [[small intestine]]. Instead, glucose for a ruminants' brain function and [[lactation]], if needed, is made by the [[liver]]. 
 
 == Where ruminants are found == 
 There are 3.5 billion domestic ruminants, with about 95% being [[cattle]], [[goats]] and [[sheep]]. < ref name = Journal > Hackmann. T. J., and Spain, J. N. 2010.[http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302%2810%2900105-0/abstract  " Ruminant ecology and evolution: Perspectives useful to livestock research and production " ]. ''Journal of Dairy Science'', 93:1320–1334 < /ref > 
 
 There are also about 75 million wild ruminants. They can be found anywhere except for the continents [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]]. Most of them are in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. < ref name = Journal/ >
