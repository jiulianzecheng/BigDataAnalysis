 '''Nostalgia''' is an [[emotion]]. It is the feeling of enjoying events from the past. People with nostalgia will often look at or use old things that they were familiar with years ago. This is because people feel more connected to those past times that they enjoyed, usually because it reminds them of how long it has been since they last connected to such past times. Examples where people may have the feeling of nostalgia includes watching old TV shows, using old technology that was very enjoyable, and playing with toys that you played with as a child. These memories are usually misleading, and can make someone wish that they could be young again, even if their childhood was mediocre. Human brains often leave out boring or bad memories, which can cause incorrect feelings about their childhood. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Farrimond|first=Stuart|date=2012-07-23|title=Nostalgia: Why we think things were better in the past|language=en-US|work=Doctor Stu's Science Blog|url=https://realdoctorstu.com/2012/07/23/nostalgia-why-we-think-things-were-better-in-the-past/|access-date=2022-03-25|archive-date=2022-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331184332/https://realdoctorstu.com/2012/07/23/nostalgia-why-we-think-things-were-better-in-the-past/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 During the early Greek times, nostalgia was treated as a mental condition primarily based on extreme [[homesickness]]. < ref name=NYMag20160225 > {{cite magazine |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=The Little-Known Medical History of Homesickness |url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/homesickness-was-once-considered-a-medical-diagnosis.html |magazine=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301021127/http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/homesickness-was-once-considered-a-medical-diagnosis.html |archivedate=March 1, 2016 |date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In modern times, however, nostalgia is treated as a separate emotion. Nostalgia is often associated with positive feelings, often associated with positive memories of the past. The feeling of nostalgia often helps improve the mood of the person who is experiencing nostalgia. It also makes the person feel more connected to society. It can make the person feel more aware about living life to the best. Nostalgia is also shown to help reinforce memories, as well as assist with learning. < ref > {{cite journal |author1=Oba K. |author2=Noriuchi M. |author3=Atomi T. |author4=Moriguchi Y. |author5=Kikuchi Y. |title=Memory and reward systems coproduce 'nostalgic' experiences in the brain |journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience |date=2015-06-04 |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=1069â€“1077 |doi=10.1093/scan/nsv073 |pmid=26060325 |pmc=4927028 |language=English}} < /ref >
