 The three genera of Influenzavirus can be told apart by the structure of their [[protein]]s. They infect vertebrates, as follows: < ref name= " ICTVdb " / > 
 * [[Influenzavirus A]] cause of all [[flu pandemic]]s and infect [[human]]s, other [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s 
 * [[Influenzavirus B]] infect [[human]]s and [[pinniped|seals]] 
 * [[Influenzavirus C]] infect [[human]]s and [[pig]]s 
 
 == Types == 
 
 There are three genera of influenza virus: [[Influenzavirus A]], [[Influenzavirus B]] and [[Influenzavirus C]]. Each genus includes only one species, or type: Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, and Influenza C virus, respectively. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans. < ref name=hay > {{cite journal | author = Hay A, Gregory V, Douglas A, Lin Y | title = The evolution of human influenza viruses | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1416 | pages = 1861–70 | date = 2001-12-29 | pmid = 11779385 | url = http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/media/hf0bujxwvrcxd7nwdrwq/contributions/l/x/y/v/lxyv2p8w45geev90.pdf | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.0999 | pmc = 1088562 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/ | title = Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }} < /ref > 
 
 === Influenza A === 
 
 {{main|Influenzavirus A}} 
 
 Influenza A viruses are further classified, based on the viral surface proteins [[hemagglutinin]] (HA or H) and [[neuraminidase]] (NA or N). Eighteen H subtypes (or serotypes) and eleven N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified. 
 
 [[File:InfluenzaNomenclatureDiagram.svg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of influenza nomenclature.]] 
 
 Further variation exists; thus, specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type, geographical location where first isolated, sequential number of isolation, year of isolation, and HA and NA subtype. < ref > {{cite book | editor = Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases | url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pink-chapters.htm | edition = 10th | year = 2007 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | location = Washington DC}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html | title = Avian Influenza (Bird Flu): Implications for Human Disease | accessdate = 2007-09-14 | date = 2007-06-27 | publisher = Center for Infectious Disease Research  &  Policy, [[University of Minnesota]] | archive-date = 2013-06-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130617170122/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Examples of the nomenclature are:  
 # A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2) 
 # B/Hong Kong/330/2001 
 
 The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease. The serotypes that have been confirmed in [[humans]], ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are: 
 
 * [[H1N1]] caused  " [[Spanish Flu]] " . 
 * [[H2N2]] caused  " Asian Flu " . 
 * [[H3N2]] caused  " Hong Kong Flu " . 
 * [[H5N1]] is a [[pandemic]] threat in 2006-7 flu season. 
 * [[H7N7]] has unusual zoonotic potential. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Fouchier R, Schneeberger P, Rozendaal F, Broekman J, Kemink S, Munster V, Kuiken T, Rimmelzwaan G, Schutten M, Van Doornum G, Koch G, Bosman A, Koopmans M, Osterhaus A | title = Avian influenza A virus (H7N7) associated with human conjunctivitis and a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 1356–61 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14745020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0308352100| pmc = 337057 | bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.1356F | doi-access = free }} < /ref >

 === Influenza B === 
 
 {{main|Influenzavirus B}} 
 
 Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Osterhaus A, Rimmelzwaan G, Martina B, Bestebroer T, Fouchier R | title = Influenza B virus in seals | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1051–3 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10807575 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1051| bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1051O }} < /ref >  This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A < ref > {{cite journal | author = Nobusawa E, Sato K | title = Comparison of the mutation rates of human influenza A and B viruses | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-virology_2006-04_80_7/page/3675 | journal = J Virol | volume = 80 | issue = 7 | pages = 3675–8 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16537638 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.80.7.3675-3678.2006| pmc = 1440390 }} < /ref >  and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. < ref name=hay/ >  As a result of this lack of [[antigen]]ic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. < ref name=webster > {{cite journal | author = Webster R, Bean W, Gorman O, Chambers T, Kawaoka Y | title = Evolution and ecology of influenza A viruses | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed & pubmedid=1579108 |journal = Microbiol Rev | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 152–79 | date = 1992-03-01 | doi = 10.1128/mr.56.1.152-179.1992 | pmid = 1579108| pmc = 372859 }} < /ref >  This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species [[antigenic shift]]), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur. < ref name=Zambon > {{cite journal | author = Zambon M | title = Epidemiology and pathogenesis of influenza | journal = J Antimicrob Chemother | volume = 44 Suppl B | issue = | pages = 3–9 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10877456 | url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/44/suppl_2/3 | doi = 10.1093/jac/44.suppl_2.3}} < /ref > 
 
 === Influenza C === 
 
 {{main|Influenzavirus C}} 
 
 The influenza C virus infects [[human]]s and [[pig]]s, and can cause severe illness and local [[epidemic]]s. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Matsuzaki Y, Sugawara K, Mizuta K, Tsuchiya E, Muraki Y, Hongo S, Suzuki H, Nakamura K | title = Antigenic and genetic characterization of influenza C viruses which caused two outbreaks in Yamagata City, Japan, in 1996 and 1998 | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed & pubmedid=11825952 | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 422–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11825952 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.40.2.422-429.2002| pmc = 153379 }} < /ref >  However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Matsuzaki Y, Katsushima N, Nagai Y, Shoji M, Itagaki T, Sakamoto M, Kitaoka S, Mizuta K, Nishimura H | title = Clinical features of influenza C virus infection in children | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-infectious-diseases_2006-05-01_193_9/page/1229 | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 193 | issue = 9 | pages = 1229–35 | date = May 1, 2006 | pmid = 16586359 | doi = 10.1086/502973}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | author = Katagiri S, Ohizumi A, Homma M | title = An outbreak of type C influenza in a children's home | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-infectious-diseases_1983-07_148_1/page/51 | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–6 | date = July 1983 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/148.1.51 | pmid = 6309999}} < /ref >
