[[File:Charnia.png|thumb|right|200px|''Charnia'']] 
 
 '''''Charnia''''' is the [[genus]] name of a [[frond]]-like [[Ediacaran]] lifeform. It has segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a midline. The genus ''Charnia'' was named after [[Charnwood Forest]] in [[Leicestershire]], [[England]], where the first fossilised specimen was found. 
 
 == Significance== 
 ''Charnia'' is a highly significant [[fossil]] for several reasons. It is the first fossil ever described from undoubted [[Precambrian]] [[rocks]]. Until then the Precambrian was thought to have no fossils. Similar fossils found in the 1930s (Namibia) and the 1940s (Australia) but were thought to be of [[Cambrian]] age. 
 
 Secondly, ''Charnia'' has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an [[algae|alga]] (Ford), it was recast as a [[sea pen]], a sister group to the modern soft corals, from 1966 onwards (Glaessner). The sea pen interpretation has recently been discredited. < ref name= " Williams " > {{cite journal

 == Ecology == 
 Little is known of the ecology of ''Charnia''. It was [[benthic]], anchored to the sea floor. It probably lived in deep waters, below the [[wave]]s (perhaps a great deal below the wave base). This means it did not [[photosynthesis]]e. Further, it has no obvious feeding apparatus ([[mouth]], [[gut]], etc.) and so its [[lifestyle]] is somewhat of an [[wikt:enigma|enigma]]. Some think it survived by [[filter feeding]] or directly absorbing [[nutrient]]s. < ref > Narbonne < /ref > 
 
 The growth and development of the Ediacara biota is also important. It was used to discredit the sea pen [[hypothesis]]. In contrast to the sea pens (that grow by new buds at the base), ''Charnia'' grew by new buds at the apex. < ref name=Antcliffe2008/ >
