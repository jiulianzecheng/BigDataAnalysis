 The '''bonobo''' (''Pan paniscus'') is a [[great ape]] and the smaller of the two [[species]] making up the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' (the other is ''Pan troglodytes'', the [[common chimpanzee]]). The bonobo is sometimes called the '''dwarf''' or '''pygmy chimpanzee'''. < ref name= " deWaal1997 " > {{cite book | first1 = Frans | last1 = de Waal | first2 = Frans 1997| last2 = Lanting | title = Bonobo: the forgotten ape | year = 1997 | url = https://archive.org/details/bonoboforgottena0000waal | publisher = University of California Press|isbn=0-520-20535-9}} < /ref >  Although the name  " chimpanzee "  is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood to mean the common chimpanzee, while ''Pan paniscus'' is usually referred to as the bonobo. 
 
 The bonobo lives in [[rain forest]], in a {{Convert|500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area south of the [[Congo River]]. This is in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Central Africa. 
 
 The bonobo has high levels of [[sexual]] [[behavior]]. Sex functions in conflict appeasement, affection, social status, excitement, and stress reduction. It occurs in virtually all partner combinations and in a variety of positions. This may explain the lower levels of [[aggression]] in the bonobo as compared to the common chimpanzee and other apes. Bonobos are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] and a male's rank in the social hierarchy is often determined by his mother's rank. 
 
 The two chimpanzee species are separated by the huge [[Congo River]]. Its formation 1.5â€“2 million years ago may have led to the [[speciation]] of the bonobo. Their population is between 29,000 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. It is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], human population growth and commercial poaching. The bonobo lives for about 40 years in captivity, < ref > Rowe N. 1996.
