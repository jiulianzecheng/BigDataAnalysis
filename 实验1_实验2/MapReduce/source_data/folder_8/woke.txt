 '''''Woke''''' ({{IPAc-en|'|w|o ä|k}} {{Respell|WOHK}}) is a word which originally referred to awareness about [[racism]] and [[discrimination]]. It later came to include an awareness of other issues of [[social inequality]], for example regarding [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]]. Since the late 2010s it has also been used as a general word for [[Left-wing politics|left-wing political]] movements and viewpoints which emphasise the [[identity politics]] of [[people of color]] (those who are not [[White people|white]]), [[LGBT community|LGBT people]], and [[Woman|women]]. 
 
 The phrase  " '''''stay woke''''' "  began within the everyday language of some [[African Americans]] in the 1930s, because in [[African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) ''woke'' is instead of ''woken'', the usual [[:en:Past participle|past participle]] form of ''wake''. < ref > {{cite web|date=25 June 2017|title=woke adjective ''earlier than 2008''|url=https://public.oed.com/appeals/woke/|website=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=16 July 2021|archive-date=16 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210716171632/https://public.oed.com/appeals/woke/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 After the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]] in 2014, the word was used by [[Black Lives Matter]] (BLM) activists who wanted to raise awareness about police shootings of African Americans in the US. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Elaine|last2=Ragland|first2=Alice|date=Spring 2018|title=#StayWoke: The Language and Literacies of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement|url=https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1067 & context=communityliteracy|journal=Community Literacy Journal|volume=12|issue=2}} < /ref >  It became an Internet [[meme]] and was increasingly utilised by individuals who were not African American to show that they supported BLM. Popular among [[millennials]], the word spread worldwide and was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2017. 
 
 The word ended up being used as a catch-all term to describe [[Left-wing politics|left-wing ideologies]], often centred on the [[identity politics]] of minority groups and informed by academic movements like critical race theory, which identified themselves as being devoted to [[social justice]]. This included BLM, anti-racism, and campaigns on women's and LGBT issues. By 2020, parts of the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] in some Western countries were [[wikt:irony|ironically]] using the word  " woke "  to describe left-wing movements and ideologies they disagreed with. In turn, some left-wing activists came to consider it an offensive term used to [[wikt:belittle|belittle]] those campaigning against [[discrimination]]. < ref name= " Bacon " > {{Cite news|last=Bacon Jr|first=Perry|date=March 17, 2021|title=Why Attacking 'Cancel Culture' And 'Woke' People Is Becoming The GOP's New Political Strategy|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-attacking-cancel-culture-and-woke-people-is-becoming-the-gops-new-political-strategy/|access-date=July 5, 2021}} < /ref >
