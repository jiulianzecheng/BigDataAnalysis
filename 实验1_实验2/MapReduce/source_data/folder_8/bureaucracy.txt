'''Bureaucracy''' is a [[concept]]. It is the [[structure]] and rules which control the activities of people that work for large [[organization]]s and [[government]].  
 
 It has standardized procedure (rule-following), formal division of [[responsibility]], [[hierarchy]], and impersonal relationships. However, in practice, the interpretation and execution of [[policy]] can lead to informal influence. 
 
 Bureaucracy is a concept in [[sociology]] and [[political science]]. Four things are central to any definition of bureaucracy: a well-defined division of work between persons and offices, consistent patterns of [[recruitment]], and stable [[career]]s. There is a hierarchy among offices, such that the authority and status are distributed between actors. Formal and informal networks connect people to one another, through flows of information and patterns of cooperation.  
 
 Examples of everyday bureaucracies include [[government]]s, [[armed force]]s, [[corporation]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[court]]s, [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and [[school]]s.
