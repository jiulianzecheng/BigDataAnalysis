 '''Intelligence''' refers to certain mental powers. There is no general [[agreement]] on which mental powers are intelligent or part of intelligence. The idea comes from a [[Latin language|Latin]] word: ''intelligo'' meaning to ''choose between different options''. A part of intelligence allows people to solve [[problem]]s. These problems may be easy to solve. They may also be difficult to solve, and involve [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] [[thought]]. For some, intelligence is a [[property]], or [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]] of the [[mind]]. For others, it is simply the working of the [[brain]], especially the [[cerebral cortex]]. 
 
 If an answer is found to a problem, it can be remembered. That way, the problem is solved more quickly when it comes up again.  This is what is called [[learning]]. 
 
 There is disagreement about which has more [[influence]] on intelligence, [[genetics]] or [[environment]].  Also, intelligent [[behaviour]] is possibly learned when an [[organism]] (a living thing) reacts enough to a [[stimulus]]. 
 
 [[Scientist]]s believe that intelligence can be [[measure]]d or [[test]]ed. A type of intelligence test would be solving many [[problem]]s in a very short time. Most of the problems have to do with [[sight|seeing]] things, or telling what a [[rotation|rotated]] [[shape]] would look like. Some are also related to [[mathematics]]: for example to tell what [[number]] would come next in a row. Other tests have to do with words or the understanding of [[language]].  After giving such a test to a person, a number would be calculated to give an [[approximation]] of the [[Intelligence quotient|Intelligence Quotient]] (IQ). 
 
 == Intelligent machines == 
 [[Computer engineer]]s try to build [[machine]]s that act as if they were intelligent. This is related to [[computer science]] and is called [[Artificial intelligence]] (man-made  " intelligence " ). Artificial intelligence uses [[logic]], and often combines it with [[machine learning]]. This means that similar to living organisms, the machine has to be trained to solve a problem. After training, it will solve the problem faster. 
 
 == Intelligence in animals and plants ==

 Intelligence is not limited to humans. Many animals also show signs of intelligence: animals also need to solve problems, and remembering how a problem is solved is useful to them.  Many animals use [[tools]] to solve problems. These animals include the [[Hominidae|Great Apes]], [[Dog|dogs]], [[Dolphin|dolphins]], [[Elephant|elephants]], [[Rat|rats]] and [[Mouse|mice]], and some [[Bird|birds]]. All these animals are [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]], but tool use isn't limited to these: Even [[Cephalopod|cephalopods]] and [[Arthropod|arthropods]] show signs of intelligence. To  be able to compare the behaviours of different species, scientists need to adapt the notion of intelligence.  
 
 It has been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent: they are able to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[Plant physiology|physiology]] and [[phenotype]] accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Trewavas|first=Anthony|date=September 2005|title=Green plants as intelligent organisms|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=10|issue=9|pages=413–419|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2005.07.005|pmid=16054860}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Trewavas|first1=A.|year=2002|title=Mindless mastery|journal=Nature|volume=415|issue=6874|pages=841|doi=10.1038/415841a|pmid=11859344|s2cid=4350140}} < /ref >  A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories.  
 
 Opposed to this are computations that only occur once, and that do not involve learning. If this is accepted as part of the definition, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of  " machine learning " , but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensory-motor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of 'learning' (registering memories) from their past experiences. They are also capable of communication, accurately computing their circumstances, using sophisticated [[cost–benefit analysis]] and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Goh|first1=C.
