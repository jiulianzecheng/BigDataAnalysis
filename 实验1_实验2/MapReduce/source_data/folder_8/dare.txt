 A '''dare''' is when somebody tempts someone else to do something. Certain types of dares can get the person they dared in [[trouble]]. However, some types of dares do not mean to get the person who did it in trouble. There is a game that includes dares, called [[Truth or Dare?]]. Some people who accept dares are known as a [[daredevil]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/daredevil | title=Definition of DAREDEVIL }} < /ref >
