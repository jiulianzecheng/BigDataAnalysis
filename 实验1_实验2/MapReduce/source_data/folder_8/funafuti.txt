[[File:Tuvalu Funafuti Atoll.JPG|thumb|Funafuti]] 
 '''Funafuti''' is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of the small island nation of [[Tuvalu]]. It has a population of 4,492 ([[2002]]), making it the most populated atoll in this country. It is a narrow sweep of land between 20 and 400 meters wide. There is an [[airstrip]], hotel ([[Vaiaku Langi Hotel]]), and administrative buildings, as well as homes, constructed both in the traditional manner, out of palm [[frond]]s, and more recently out of cement blocks. The most prominent building on Funafuti atoll is the [[Church of Tuvalu]]. Other sites of interest are the remains of American aircraft that crashed on Funafuti during [[World War II]], when the airstrip was used by the American forces to defend the Gilbert Islands (now [[Kiribati]]). The [[United States]] claimed Funafuti until a treaty of friendship was concluded in the late 70's or early 80's. 
 
 The largest island is [[Fongafale]]. On this island, there are four villages, of which one is [[Vaiaku]], where the government is. The capital of Tuvalu is sometimes given as Fongafale or Vaiaku, but the entire atoll of Funafuti is actually the capital.
