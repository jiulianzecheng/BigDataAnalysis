 A '''well''' is a hole that is dug into the [[Earth]] to get a [[fluid]]. Most wells are to get [[water]]. There are also [[oil well ]]s and gas wells.  
 
 A [[qanat]] is an ancient complex water well system used in the [[Middle East]]. Wells can be as simple as a hole that a bucket on a rope can be lowered into, or very complex with [[pipe]]s and high-powered [[pump]]s to get the water out. Most [[city|cities]] that are not close to [[fresh water]] [[lake]]s or [[river]]s get their water from wells.  
 
 It is important to be careful what rubbish is put into the [[ground]] near a well. If something [[toxic]] is put in the ground, it could go in the [[groundwater]] and the well and make people sick. 
 
 Water is a problem for many [[Africa]]n [[country|countries]]. Many [[Charitable organization|charities]] are helping to build wells in local [[village]]s need not go far to get water. 
 
 A well only works if underneath there is an [[aquifer]] which feeds it.
