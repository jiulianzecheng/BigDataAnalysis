 The monoplacophora were well-known as a fossil group from the [[Cambrian]] to the [[Devonian]]. They were thought to be long [[extinct]]. One species was dredged up from the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Mexico]] in 1952. It was found to be a Monoplacophoran, and given the genus of ''Neopilina''. < ref > Lemche, Henning 1957. ''Nature'' '''179''', 413–416. < /ref >   This was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a '[[living fossil]]', and a [[Lazarus taxon]].
