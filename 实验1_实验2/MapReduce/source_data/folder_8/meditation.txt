 It is a common practice in many religions including [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]] (sometimes), [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] (where [[Yoga]] is important) 
 and other [[religion]]s. Meditation has now become a modern trend, showing many health benefits. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/02/health-not-hedonism-the-festivals-putting-wellness-at-their-heart|title=Boom in wellness at festivals as young people swap hedonism for yoga|last1=Marsh|first1=Sarah|date=2019-08-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-13|last2=Giovannetti-Singh|first2=Shanti|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}} < /ref > 
 The initial origin of meditation is from the Vedic times of India.   
 
 == Buddhist meditation == 
 
 In [[Buddhism]], three things are very important: being a good person, making the [[mind]] stronger, and understanding (Insight or Wisdom) about why people are in [[pain]] ([[Dukkha]]). < ref > In Buddhism, these three things together are called the  " threefold training. "  In the words of 2,000-year-old Buddhist books, these three things are called ''sīla'', ''citta'' (or ''samādhi'') and ''paññā''. See, for example, Thanissaro (1998a) and Thanissaro (1998b). < /ref >  For [[Buddhist]]s, meditation is used to calm the mind so that the mind can better see the cause of pain. Buddhists believe that this type of seeing can end pain. < ref > See, for instance, Thanissaro (1998c). < /ref > 
 
 Buddhist meditation is not just used for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] reasons. [[Research]] shows that Buddhist meditation lowers [[wikt:stress|stress]], [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (illness)|depression]]. < ref > Kabat-Zinn (1990); and, Linehan (1993), p. 1. < /ref > 
 
 Most types of Buddhist meditation focus on something. The most popular things to focus on include [[breath]], [[metta| metta or Loving-Kindness towards all]], other recollections, situational mindfulness and [[religion|religious]] [[image]]s and [[sound]]s. < ref > See, for example, Kamalashila (2003). < /ref > 
 
 == Christian meditation == 
 Christians sometimes meditate by thinking about small parts of the [[Bible]], or by saying the words of a [[prayer]] to themselves over and over. Meditation is an expression of Christian prayer. In the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] is specified that by means of meditation  " The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking " ; also it is pointed out that  " meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Expressions of prayer|website=www.vatican.va}} < /ref > 
 
 Meditation is principally made on the Sacred Scriptures with the [[Gospels]], liturgical texts, writings of the spiritual fathers, and meditative devotions. 
 
 Meditation is a significant part of the devotion of the [[Rosary]];  " by virtue of its meditative character, with the tranquil succession of Hail Marys, the Rosary has a peaceful effect on those who pray it, disposing them to receive and experience in their innermost depths, and to spread around them, that true peace which is the special gift of the Risen Lord (cf. Jn 14:27; 20.21).
