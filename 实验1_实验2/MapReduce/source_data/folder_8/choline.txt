 '''Choline''' is an [[organic compound]]. It is the precursor molecule (~building block) for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. Acetylcholine is involved in many functions including [[memory]] and [[muscle]] control. 
 
 Some animals cannot produce choline, but must have it in their diet to stay healthy. Humans make a small amount of choline in the [[liver]]. In the [[United States]], choline is recommended as an [[essential nutrient]] after research showed that humans need to get it. They need to have choline in their diet or take a [[dietary supplement|supplementation]] for proper health. < ref name= " lpi " > {{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/choline|title=Choline|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon|date=February 2015|accessdate=10 January 2017}} < /ref > < ref name= " Zeisel " > {{cite journal |author=Zeisel SH  |author2=da Costa KA |title=Choline: an essential nutrient for public health |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=615–23 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19906248 |pmc=2782876 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00246.x}} < /ref >  Possible benefits include reducing the risk of neural tube defects and fatty liver disease. It has also been found that intake of choline during pregnancy can have long-term beneficial effects on memory for the child. < ref name=Zeisel/ > 
 
 Choline is usually grouped with the [[B vitamin complex|Vitamin B complex]]. It is a [[vitamin]] that is needed by the [[human body]]. Adults should take between 425 and 550 milligrams of it daily. Choline is used by the body in the walls of [[cell]]s and as a [[neurotransmitter]]. It also helps to prevent [[heart disease]]. There are claims that it helps reduce body [[fat]], but this has not been proven. 
   
 == History == 
 Choline was discovered by Andreas Strecker in 1864. In 1998 choline was classified as an needed [[nutrient]] by the [[Food and Nutrition Board]] of the [[Institute of Medicine]] ([[United States|USA]]). < ref > {{pauling|id=othernuts/choline/|title=Choline|author=Jane Higdon}} < /ref > < ref > " [http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/cho_0283.shtml Choline], ''PDRHealth'' < /ref > < ref > " [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s119524.htm Choline] "  (An interview with Steven Zeisel, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry), ''Radio National Health Report with Norman Swan'', Monday 17 April 2000 < /ref > 
 
 == Sources == 
 Sources of Choline are [[Egg (food)|egg]] [[yolk]]s, [[soybean|soy]] and cooked [[beef]], [[chicken]], [[veal]] and [[turkey (bird)]] [[liver]]s. Many foods contain small amounts of choline, even iceberg [[lettuce]].
