 '''Guadalquivir''' is a river in southern [[Spain]]. It crosses the autonomous community of [[Andalusia]]. The name derives from the Arab ''Wadi al-Kabir'' ( " big river " ), whereas the Romans called it ''Betis''. 
 
 Guadalquivir starts in the Glen of the Sources in the mountains near Cazorla (Jaen province) and ends in Sanlucar de Barrameda (Cadiz province). It goes through the provinces of [[Jaen province|Jaen]], [[Córdoba Province (Spain)|Cordoba]], [[Seville province|Seville]] and [[Cadiz province|Cadiz]]. The river is {{convert|657|km}} long. The main tributaries are the rivers [[Genil]] (which flows through [[Granada]]), The Minor Guadiana, Guadalbullon, and Guadajoz on the left side, and Guadalmena, Jandula, and Guadiato on the right. 
 
 It is the only river in Spain with shipping traffic. At present, it only is navigable up to [[Seville]]. In the Roman epoch it was navigable up to [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]].
