 Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the history of religion as a [[Animism|pre-animistic]] phase. This is a belief system that comes from an earlier time. Sociologists also use the term ''Numen'' to refer to the idea of [[Magic|magical]] power coming from an object, particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, ''numen'' means almost the same thing as ''mana''. However, some authors only use the word ''mana'' for ideas about magic from [[Polynesia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 < blockquote > The literal meaning is simply  " a nod " , or more accurately, " that which is produced by nodding " . In the same way, ''flamen'' is  " that which is produced by blowing " , ''i.e.'', a gust of wind. It came to mean  " the product or expression of power "  — not, be it noted, power itself. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.79665|title=Primitive Culture in Italy|last=Rose|first=H.

 == Roman cults of the numina == 
 Numen was also used in the imperial cult of ancient Rome, to refer to the guardian-spirit, 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor. It was  a way of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god. < ref name= " Bailey " > {{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm|title=The Religion of Ancient Rome|last=Bailey|first=Cyril|publisher=Archibald Constable  &  Co Ltd|year=1907}}, freely available from [[Project Gutenberg]] < /ref >

 == Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion == 
 The expression ''Numen inest'' appears in [[Publius Ovidius Naso|Ovid]]'s ''Fasti'' (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'. Its interpretation, and the exact sense of ''numen'' has been discussed extensively in the literature. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Herbert Jennings|date=October 1935|title=Nvmen inest: 'Animism' in Greek and Roman Religion|journal=Harvard Theological Review|volume=28|issue=4|pages=237–257|doi=10.1017/s0017816000023026|s2cid=162391992 }} < /ref > 
 
 Some people thought, that numen could have been a leftover of ealier [[Animism|animist]] religions which was incorporated into the Roman religion. Sometimes the etymology of Latin names for deities, has often been popularly implied,  but it  was criticised as  " mostly a scholarly fiction "  by McGeough (2004).

 == In popular culture == 
 In modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions: 
 
 * ''Innocue vivito, numen adest'' (Live blameless; God is here.) was the motto of [[Carl Linnaeus]], < ref name= " JacksonFries2011 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWa-A--2LZEC|title=Linnaeus|last1=Benjamin Daydon Jackson|last2=Theodor Magnus Fries|date=22 December 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-03723-5|access-date=9 April 2012}} < /ref >  taken from Ovid's Ars Amatoria (I, 640).
