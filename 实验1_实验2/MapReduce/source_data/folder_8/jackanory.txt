 '''''Jackanory''''' is a long-running [[BBC]] children's television series. It was made to interest children in reading. The show began on 13 December 1965. The first story was the fairy-tale ''[[Cap-o'-Rushes]]'' read by [[Lee Montague]]. ''Jackanory'' continued to be broadcast until 1996. They made around 3,500 episodes in its 30-year run. The final story, ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]], was read by [[Alan Bennett]]. It was broadcast on 24 March 1996. The show returned on 27 November 2006 for two stories. 
 
 The show's format had an actor read from children's novels or [[folk tale]]s, usually while seated in an armchair. From time to time the scene being read would be [[illustrate]]d by a specially made still drawing.  They were often done by [[Quentin Blake]]. Usually a single book would take five daily fifteen-minute episodes, from Monday to Friday. 
 
 A few ''Jackanory'' stories took the form of a play rather than stories being read.  These were made in a series of fully cast and dressed for [[costume drama]]s. These were named ''Jackanory Playhouse'' and were thirty minutes in length. These included a dramatisation by [[Philip Glassborow]] of the comical [[A. A. Milne]] story  " The Princess Who Couldn't Laugh. " 
 
 ==Title== 
 The show's title comes from an old English [[nursery rhyme]]: 
 
 :I'll tell you a story 
 :About Jack a Nory; 
 :And now my story's begun; 
 :I'll tell you another 
 :Of Jack and his [[brother]], 
 :And now my story is done. < ref name=Opie1997 > I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 233. < /ref >
