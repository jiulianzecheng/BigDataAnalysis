 
 The '''Bengali people''' are the main [[ethnic]] group in the region of [[Bengal]] (now divided between  [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Republic of India]]) in [[South Asia]]. They speak [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (বাংলা Bangla), a language of the eastern branch of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]].  
 
 They are natively concentrated in the nation of Bangladesh and in the Indian states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].  Some of the most well established Bengali communities are in the [[Middle East]], [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].

 After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryan]]s, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the [[Bihar]] and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]], reaching its greatest extent under the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] emperor [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named [[Gangaridai]] by the [[Greeks]] around 100 BC. The word is speculated to have come from ''Gangahrd'' (Land with the [[Ganges]] in its heart) in reference to an area in Bengal. < ref name=Gangaridai > {{cite web| url = http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/G_0019.htm| title = Gangaridai| access-date = 2006-09-08| last = Chowdhury| first = AM| work = [[Banglapedia]]| publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh}} < /ref >  Later from the 3rd to the 6th centuries [[AD]], the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the [[Gupta Empire]].
