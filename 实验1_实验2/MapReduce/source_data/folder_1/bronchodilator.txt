 A '''bronchodilator''' is a [[substance]] that [[Wiktionary:dilate#Verb|dilates]] (opens up) the [[Bronchus|bronchi]] and [[bronchiole]]s which increases [[air]]flow to the [[lung]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thoracic.org/copd-guidelines/for-patients/what-kind-of-medications-are-there-for-copd/what-are-bronchodilators.php |title=What Are Bronchodilators? |publisher=American Thoracic Society |access-date=24 December 2015 |archive-date=31 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231014910/http://www.thoracic.org/copd-guidelines/for-patients/what-kind-of-medications-are-there-for-copd/what-are-bronchodilators.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Bronchodilators may be [[wikt:endogenous|endogenous]] (originating naturally within the body), or they may be [[medication]]s taken to [[Therapy|treat]] [[breathing]] difficulties. They are most useful in obstructive lung diseases. [[Asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] are the most common such [[Disease|conditions]]. They are also used to treat respritory blockages that usaully occur when you have the common cold. They are well prescribed by doctors and are really common in house holds. Although this remains somewhat [[Controversy|controversial]], they might be useful in [[bronchiolitis]] and [[Bronchiectasis]].They are often prescribed but of unproven significance in restrictive lung diseases. 
 
 == Types of bronchodilators == 
 Bronchodilators are either short-acting or long-acting. < ref name=webMD > {{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/asthma_inhalers_bronchodilators |title=Bronchodilators and Asthma |publisher=WebMD |access-date=24 December 2015}} < /ref >  Short-acting medications provide quick or  " rescue "  relief from acute bronchoconstriction. < ref name=webMD/ >  Long-acting bronchodilators help to control and prevent symptoms. They are used along with [[Inhalation|inhaled]] [[steroids]] for control of asthma symptoms on a long-term basis. < ref name=webMD/ >  The three types of prescription bronchodilating drugs are Î²2-agonists (short- and long-acting), anticholinergics (short-acting), and theophylline (long-acting). < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707800/ |title=Pharmacological treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |author=Paolo Montuschi |date=December 2006 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |access-date=24 December 2015}} < /ref >
