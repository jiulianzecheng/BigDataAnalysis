 '''Wit''' is a form of intellectual [[humour]]. A wit is someone skilled in making witty remarks. A witty remark is a smart observation, put with [[humor]] and said in the perfect moment. Forms of wit include: the '''quip''' and the '''repartee'''. 
 
 Witty remarks may be intentionally [[wikt:cruel|cruel]], and perhaps more ingenious than funny.  
 
 A '''quip''' is an observation or saying that has some wit but perhaps descends into [[sarcasm]], or otherwise is short of point; a witticism also suggests the diminutive. '''Repartee''' is the wit of the quick answer. (Wilde:  " I wish I'd said that. "  [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]:  " You will, Oscar, you will " .)
