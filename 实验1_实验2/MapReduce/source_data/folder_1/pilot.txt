 A '''pilot''' is a person that drives a transport [[vehicle]] such as an [[airplane]], [[spacecraft]], or [[boat]]. All types of pilots must pass tests and obtain a [[license]] before they can operate the vehicle.  
 
 An aircraft pilot is usually in charge of a flying machine for the whole trip.  
 
 Maritime or ship pilots usually only guide the ship through an especially difficult place such as a [[harbor]] and are usually aboard only during this passage.
