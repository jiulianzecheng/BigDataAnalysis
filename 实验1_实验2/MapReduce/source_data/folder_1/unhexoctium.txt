 '''Unhexoctium''' ({{pron-en|uːnhɛksɒktiəm}}), also known as eka-[[flerovium]], dvi-[[lead]],  or element 168, < ref name= " auto "  / >  is the  possible [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the temporary symbol Uho and has the [[atomic number]] 168. < ref name= " auto "  / >  Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is physically possible, but if possible, Unhexoctium is predicted to be the last [[period 8 element]] in [[Group 14 element|group 14]]. It should have an [[atomic mass]] around 490.  
 
 As of October 2022, no attempt has ever been made to make Unhexoctium, nor has any plans been made known to attempt to make Unhexoctium. 
 
 == Naming == 
 The name Unhexoctium is a systematic element name, < ref name= " auto " > {{Cite web|title=Unhexoctium|url=https://periodicsystem.org/unhexoctium|access-date=2021-02-06|website=Periodic System|language=en|archive-date=2021-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210306162548/http://periodicsystem.org/unhexoctium|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  used as a placeholder until it is confirmed by other research groups and the IUPAC decides on a name. Usually, the name suggested by the discoverer(s) is chosen. 
 
 == Stability == 
 
 Unhexoctium is highly likely to be too unstable to be detected, which would allow very little study of it. 
 
 == Predicted chemistry == 
 
 Unhexoctium is probably a [[post-transition metal]], although it might be a [[noble gas]]. A likely oxidation state is +4, based on the oxidation states of Flerovium and Lead.
