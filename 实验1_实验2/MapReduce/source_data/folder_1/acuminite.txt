'''Acuminite''' is a [[colorless]] [[mineral]] made from [[crystal]]s.  It is named for the [[Latin]] word  " acuminis "  (meaning  " sharp point "  or  " spearhead " ) for the way the crystals are made.  It is easily found in [[Greenland]] in the [[Ivigtut]] [[cryolite]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposit]].  It is easily scratched with a [[copper]] [[penny]]. < ref > [http://www.webmineral.com/data/Acuminite.shtml Mineral Data Sheet] < /ref >
