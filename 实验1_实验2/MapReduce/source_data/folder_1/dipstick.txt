A '''dipstick''' is a tool which can be dipped into [[liquid]] to measure how much of it there is, or to test it for things.

 A testing dipstick is usually made of [[paper]] or [[cardboard]]. It contains [[substance]]s which change colour when something is found in a liquid.

 Measuring dipsticks show the amount of liquid in a container. These containers are usually hard to access. Measuring dipsticks are used by inserting and removing the stick and then checking how much of the stick is covered by the liquid. The [[oil level]] dipstick is an example of a measuring dipstick found on most internal [[combustion engine]]s.
