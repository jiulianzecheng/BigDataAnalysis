 '''Truro''' is the capital of [[Cornwall]] in [[South West England]]. It is the only city in Cornwall, and it is the most southerly city in the [[British Isles]]. The River Truro flows though Truro and boats can travel to Truro along the river. 
 
 ==History== 
 Truro became a large town in the [[19th century]] because of the tin mining [[industry]] of west Cornwall. When a new [[Church of England]] [[diocese]] for Cornwall was set up in [[1876]] Truro became the seat of the [[bishop]]. [[Truro Cathedral]] took many years to build but was finished in [[1910]]. It is built in the Early English Gothic revival style. Truro also became the county town of Cornwall when a county council was set up in [[1888]]. The Royal Cornwall Museum is Cornwall's county museum and is owned by the Royal Institution of Cornwall (founded [[1818]]). 
 
 ==Facilities== 
 The Royal Cornwall Hospital is a major [[National Health Service|NHS]] [[hospital]].
