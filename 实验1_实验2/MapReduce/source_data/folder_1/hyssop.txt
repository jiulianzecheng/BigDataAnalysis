 '''Hyssop''' (''Hyssopus'') is a [[genus]] of about 10{{ndash}}12 [[species]] of [[herbaceous]] or [[subshrub|semi-woody]] plants in the family [[Lamiaceae]]. They are native to the east [[Mediterranean]] to central [[Asia]]. < ref name= " complete-herbal " > {{cite web

 They are [[Aroma compound|aromatic]], with upright branched stems up to 60 & nbsp;cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The small blue [[flower]]s are on the upper part of the branches during [[summer]]. By far the best-known species is the '''herb hyssop''' (''H. officinalis''). It is widely grown outside its native area in the Mediterranean. 
 
 The anise hyssop, ''[[Agastache foeniculum]]'' (also called blue giant hyssop) is a very different plant and not a close relative, although both are in the [[Mentha|mint]] family.  Anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern [[North America]]. 
 ==Origin of name== 
 The name 'hyssop' can be traced back almost unchanged through the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|ύσσωπος}} (''hyssopos'') and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|אזוב}} (''ezov''). < ref name= " complete-herbal " / >  The Book of [[Exodus]] in the [[Bible]] records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of [[Passover]]. Its vomit-inducing properties are also mentioned in the Book of [[Psalms]]. < ref > {{bibleref|Psalms|51:7}} < /ref >  In the [[New Testament]], a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to [[Jesus]] of Nazareth on the cross just before he died. < ref > {{bibleref|John|19:29}} < /ref >  Both Matthew and Mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term {{lang|el|καλαμος}} (''kalamos''), which is translated as  " reed "  or  " stick. " 
 ==Seeds== 
 The seeds are planted in [[spring (season)|spring]] and the seedlings planted out 40–50 & nbsp;cm apart. Hyssop can also be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from cuttings or [[root division]] in spring or [[autumn]]. Hyssop should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil, and will benefit from occasional clipping. It does not live long, and the plants need to be replaced every few years. It is good for use as a low hedge or border within an [[herb garden]]. 
 ==Hyssop in a garden== 
 Hyssop also has uses in the garden. It is said to be a good [[companion planting|companion plant]] to [[cabbage]] because it will deter the [[cabbage white]] [[butterfly]]. < ref name= " icangarden " > {{cite web

Hyssop also attracts [[bee]]s, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]] and [[butterfly|butterflies]], and so has a place in the [[wild garden]] as well as being useful in controlling [[pest (animal)|pest]]s and encouraging [[pollination]] without the use of unnatural methods. 
 ==Leaves== 
 Hyssop leaves can be preserved by drying. < ref name= " complete-herbal " / >  Hyssop is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including the cabbage moth.

 === Ritual use === 
 Hyssop is a sacred plant used in [[Judaism]]. It appears a lot in the Hebrew Bible as [[Ezov]].  In Exodus 12:22 the Jews in [[Egypt]] are instructed to '' " Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning. " ''  It is used by the priests in the [[Temple of Solomon]] for purification rites of various kinds in [[Leviticus]] 14:4-7, 14:49-52, 19:6, 18. Hyssop is also often used to fill the [[Catholic]] ceremonial [[Aspergillum]], which the priest dips into a bowl of [[holy water]], and sprinkles onto the [[congregation]] to [[bless]] them. However, researchers say that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop. It might actually be one of a number of different herbs. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02858924|title=Identification of biblical hyssop and origin of the traditional use of oregano-group herbs in the Mediterranean region|first1=Alexander|last1=Fleisher|first2=Zhenia|last2=Fleisher|date=1 April 1988|journal=Economic Botany|volume=42|issue=2|pages=232–241|via=Springer Link|doi=10.1007/BF02858924|s2cid=45220405}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/hyssop_harrison.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-date=2016-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331201420/http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/hyssop_harrison.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Talmud]] calls the hyssop אברתא and considers it to be an herbal remedy for [[indigestion]]. < ref name= " Talmudsrc " > {{citation |title= " Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sabbath, page 128, folio a |language=Aramaic}} < /ref > 
 
 === In foods === 
 Hyssop leaves have a slightly bitter minty flavor and can be added to soups, salads or meats, but it should be used sparingly as the flavour is very strong.
