 '''Armens''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Արմեններ, Առամեններ), were [[Armenians|Armenian]] tribes, the people are called Arman, Armenic or Armanen. They correspond with the [[Hayasa-Azzi|Hayasa-Azzi Tribes]]. The Armans united with the tribes of Hayasi. Recent linguistic studies present strong evidence that the Indo-European language group originates in [[Anatolia]]. < ref > A History of Armenia 
 by Vahan M. Kurkjian < /ref >   According to most accounts, the Armens were generally tall, blond-haired, and blue-eyed in appearance, in contrast to their Urartian cousins who tended to be slighter with black hair and black eyes. < ref name= " Bauer " > Elisabeth Bauer. ''Armenia: Past and Present'', p. 49. ISBN B0006EXQ9C < /ref >  The Urartian state, which existed there prior to the coming of the

 == History == 
 At the end of the second millennium BC, another [[Indo-European]] ethnic group, closely related to Thracians and [[Phrygians]] and referred to by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] as Armens, migrated to the [[Armenian Highland]] from Northern [[Balkans]]. < ref > [http://un.cti.depaul.edu/Countries/Armenia/1133483520/history.pdf Ancient Armenia (3500 BC - 520 BC)]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
     
 One theory suggests that the Armens were of [[Thracian]] origin, and related to the [[Phrygians]]. < ref > Armenia and the Armenians from the Earliest Times Until the Great War (1914) By Kevork Aslan, Pierre Crabitès - Page 15 < /ref >  The Armens were near the head waters of the [[Halys]], to the west of the [[Euphrates]]. < ref > An inscription of Menousas reveals the existence of a people known as the Urmani or Armeni, living to the west of Ourartou. < /ref >  The Armens seemed to have mixed blood with another Asiatic element whose patronymic Hai, became in time their national designation. The country where the Armens settled were a mountainous region, traversed by deep valleys and smiling plains. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word Armani, (mentioned in [[Akkadian]] inscriptions as early as 2400 BC) an early form of Armen-Armin or Arman denotes the national affiliation, as with many cultures standing for the particular nation thus, the God AR being the primary deity in the [[Indo-European]] (aka [[Aryan]]) pantheon - thus AR MAN denotes—Men of Ar or Children of Ar, again initially AR standing for ARAREL-ARARICH [hence Ar-Ar-At the Place of ARAR] -- Create-Creator, also Sun, Light, Life and Love. < ref > Gevork Nazaryan - The Armenic and Armania < /ref >
