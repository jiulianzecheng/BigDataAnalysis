 A '''hazard''' is something that can be [[wikt:dangerous|dangerous]]. Fire, Explosives and Fuel are all examples of hazards. Many chemicals can be a hazard. There are ways to get rid of hazardous things. There are different types of hazards; some can catch things on fire; some can burn skin; some can irritate the eyes, etc. 
 
 The term 'hazard' is used in [[driving instruction]], and in some [[traffic]]-related [[law]]s. It simply means 'something a motorist should notice and drive accordingly'. For example, children playing on the [[pavement]] (U.S. = sidewalk; Austr. = footpath) are a potential hazard. If any go into the actual road, then they are a real hazard, and motorist should do whatever is safe.
