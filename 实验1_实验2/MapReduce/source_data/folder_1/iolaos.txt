 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Iolaus''' ({{lang-el|Ἰόλαος}}, ''Iólaos'') was the nephew of [[Herakles]], son of the hero's twin brother [[Iphicles]] and [[Automedusa]]. He was famed for having assisted Herakles in completing his Labors, serving as the hero's charioteer. A genus of Lycaenid butterfly has been named after him.
