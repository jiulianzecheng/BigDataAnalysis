 '''Nice''' (pronounced  " neece " ) is a city in southern [[France]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. It is a commune in the French department of [[Alpes-Maritimes]]. It has over 345,000 people living in the city as of 2012 (1,000,000 in its metropolitan area). It has many beaches. It has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Summers are hot, dry, and sunny; winters are mild with moderate rainfall. 
 
 From the late 18th century, wealthy [[British people|British]] visitors came to Nice, with its beauty and its warm climate. [[Queen Victoria]] was amongst them: she made several visits. The city's main seaside promenade, the ''Promenade des Anglais'' owes its name to these visitors. < ref > Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137 < /ref >  The clear air and soft light appeals to painters. [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Henri Matisse]] spent years here and are well represented in  the city's museums, the ''Musée Marc Chagall'', ''Musée Matisse'' and ''Musée des Beaux-Arts''. < ref > {{cite web |author= |url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/573/france/nice/ |title=Nice, France travel.

 Nice has the second largest hotel capacity in the country and is one of its most visited cities. It gets 5 & nbsp;million tourists every year. < ref name= " Nice Airport " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.niceairport.guide/locations/locations-in-nice/nice-city-information/ |title=Nice Airport |access-date=2016-07-01 |archive-date=2017-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601082641/http://www.niceairport.guide/locations/locations-in-nice/nice-city-information/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It also has the third busiest airport in France after the two main Parisian ones. < ref name= " Nice Airport " / > 
 
 The [[cuisine]] is excellent. It benefits from the Mediterranean in the form of [[bouillabaisse]] (a [[shellfish]] dish). From the end of empire, [[immigration]] from [[Algeria]] has led to excellent North African dishes such as [[cuscus|cous-cous]]. [[Ratatouille]] and (obviously) [[salade niçoise]] are more local dishes. < ref > Jacques Médecin 1972. ''La Cuisine du Comté de Nice''. Edition Julliard, Paris. {{ISBN|2-26000-025-8}} < /ref > 
 
 There is a local [[dialect]], le nissard, nissart, or niçard. It is a variety of the regional language, [[Occitan]]. It is Italian in style, reminding that the area has been under different [[sovereignty]] in the past. 
 
 Over 70 people were killed in an [[2016 Nice attack|attack on 14 July 2016]].
