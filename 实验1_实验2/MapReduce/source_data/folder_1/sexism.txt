 '''Sexism''' is generally defined as [[discrimination]] based on the [[gender]] of a personâ€”looking down on people because they are [[male]] or [[female]]. Sexism may also include [[stereotype]]d [[gender role|roles for men and women]]. [[International law]]s, such as [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] or [[Yogyakarta Principles]] demand to abolish any kind of sexism. Sexism could affect a person attending a party, getting a job, joining a game, trying to get a promotion, being selected and so on. 
 The [[women's rights]] and [[men's rights]] movements both say they fight sexism. 
 
 Sexism is often discrimination against women due to the history of sexism in the [[western world]]. 
 
 Hatred of women is called [[misogyny]]. Hatred of men is called [[misandry]]. Reverse sexism is [[misandristically]] being biased because you think you're disadvantaged. < ref > Mahowald, Mary B.  " Reverse sexism? Not to worry. "  The American Journal of Bioethics 1.1 (2001): 15-16. < /ref >
