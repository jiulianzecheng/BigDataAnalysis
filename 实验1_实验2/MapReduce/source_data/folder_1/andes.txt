 The '''Andes''' are a [[mountain range]] along the western coast of [[South America]]. 
 
 They stretch over 7,000 & nbsp;km / 4,400 miles from the south of [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] to the north of [[Colombia]]. They are also found in [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Ecuador]]. 
 
 The [[Amazon river]] system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes. 
 
 The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world, and the second-highest after the [[Himalayas]]. The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside [[Asia]]. 
 
 [[Aconcagua]], the highest peak, rises to 6,962 & nbsp;m (22,841 & nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]]. The top of [[Mount Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earth's surface most distant from its center. Mount Chimborazo is an inactive [[volcano]] in [[Ecuador]], which last erupted over a thousand years ago.

''Salar de Arizaro'' (foreground) is the largest of the dry lakes in this view.  < br / > Near the centre, the two zones, the ''Puna'' and the ''Sierras Pampeanas'', make a striking contrast.

 The Andes has three sections: 
 #The [[south]]ern Andes in Argentina and Chile; 
 #The [[wiktionary:Central|central]] Andes, having the Chilean and Peruvian mountain system and parts of Bolivia; 
 #The [[north]]ern part in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. 
 
 The northern part has two [[parallel]] ranges. They are the ''Cordillera Occidental'' ([[west]]ern) and the ''Cordillera Oriental'' ([[east]]ern). The term ''cordillera'' comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning 'rope'. 
 
 In Colombia, north to the border with Ecuador, the Andes split in three parallel ranges, western, central and eastern. 
 
 In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Snowy Mountain Range of Saint Martha) is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,700 metres above sea level just 42 & nbsp;km from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal range. 
 
 
 The western range of the eastern Cordillia Oriental is the only one which reaches [[Colombia ]]. < ref name= " andesmap " > {{Cite web |url=http://andes.zoom-maps.com/ |title=Andes travel map |access-date=2010-12-11 |archive-date=2010-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924154519/http://andes.zoom-maps.com/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The Andes range is about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide throughout its length, except in Bolivia where it is {{convert|640|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide. The [[island]]s of the Dutch Caribbean [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], which lie in the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the coast of Venezuela, [[wikt:represent|represent]] the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range. 
 
 == Geology == 
 The Andes are a [[Mesozoic]]–[[Tertiary]] [[Orogeny|orogenic]] belt of mountains along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. 
 
 The Andes are the result of [[plate tectonics]] processes, caused by the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] beneath the South American [[continental plate]]. South America, like [[North America]], has been moving west since the [[Cretaceous]] period. Thus the subduction of the [[Nazca plate|Nazca Plate]] beneath the [[South American plate|South American Plate]] formed the Andes. This was caused by the westward movement of South America. 
 
 The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] when Pangea begun to break up and several [[Rift (geology)|rifts]] developed. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the uplifting, [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]] of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of [[tectonic]] stress, uplift, and [[weathering]]. 
 
 == Climate == 
 [[File:Andes1a.JPG|right|220px|thumb|Central Andes]] 
 The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area, the [[wikt:altitude|altitude]], and how close it is to the sea. The southern section is [[rain]]y and cool. The central Andes are dry. The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm, with an [[average]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|18|C|F|0|lk=on}} in Colombia. The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances. [[Rainforest]]s exist just [[mile]]s away from the [[snow]] covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between 4,500 and 4,800 & nbsp;m (14,800–15,800 & nbsp;ft) in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, going up to 4,800–5,200 & nbsp;m (15,800–17,060 & nbsp;ft) in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then going down to {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on Aconcagua at 32°S, {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} at 40°S, {{convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} at 50°S, and only {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at 55°S; from 50°S, many of the bigger [[glacier]]s go down to sea level. < ref > {{cite web

 The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and [[wikt:glaciological|glaciological]] zones; the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes. 
 
 == Plants == 
 [[Rainforests]] used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now reduced, especially in the [[El Chocó|Chocó]] and inter-Andean [[valley]]s of Colombia. Farming, [[deforestation]], illegal crops, and population growth has done this.  
 
 A direct [[wikt:opposite|opposite]] of the [[Humidity|humid]] Andean [[slope]]s are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. That area, and many Interandean Valles, normally have [[deciduous]] [[woodland]], [[shrub]] and [[xeric]] (dry) [[vegetation]], up to the mostly lifeless [[Atacama Desert]]. 
 
 About 30,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s live in the Andes. About half of those are [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[region]]: it is a [[Biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]]. The small [[tree]] ''Cinchona pubescens'' is a source of [[quinine]] used to treat [[malaria]]. It is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that came from the Andes are [[tobacco]] and [[potato]]es.  
 
 The high-altitude ''Polylepis'' forests and woodlands are found in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees are called Queñua, Yagual and other names. They grow at altitudes of {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level. It is still unclear if the patchy [[wikt:distribution|distribution]] of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the [[Inca]]n time. Regardless, in [[modern]] times the clearance has had a faster pace, and the trees are now [[endangered]].  Some think as little as 10% of the original woodland is still here. < ref > {{cite web

 == Wildlife ==

 The Andes has a lot of wildlife. With almost 1,000 species, of which about 2/3 are [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to the [[region]], the Andes is the most [[wikt:important|important]] region in the world for [[amphibians]]. < ref name= " biodiv " > [http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/andes/Pages/biodiversity.aspx Tropical Andes] – biodiversityhotspots.org < /ref > 
 Animal [[wikt:diversity|diversity]] in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of [[mammals]] (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of [[birds]] (1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of [[reptiles]] (45% endemic), and almost 400 species of [[fish]] (1/3 endemic). < ref name= " biodiv "  / > 
 
 The [[Vicuña]] and [[Guanaco]] can be found living in the [[Altiplano]], while the closely related [[wikt:domesticate|domesticated]] [[Llama]] and [[Alpaca]] are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their [[meat]] and [[wool]]. The [[nocturnal]] [[chinchilla]]s, two threatened members of the [[rodent]] order, live in the Andes' alpine regions. The [[Andean Condor]], the largest bird of its kind in the [[Western Hemisphere]], lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers. Other animals found in the mostly open [[habitat]]s of the high Andes are the huemul, [[cougar]], and [[fox]]es in the genus ''Pseudalopex''. And for birds, some species of [[tinamou]]s (they are members of the genus ''Nothoprocta''), are the [[Andean Goose]], [[Giant Coot]], [[flamingo]]s (mainly associated with [[hypersaline]] lakes),  [[Lesser Rhea]], [[Andean Flicker]], [[Diademed Sandpiper-plover]], [[Geositta|miners]], [[Phrygilus|sierra-finches]] and [[diuca]]-finches.
