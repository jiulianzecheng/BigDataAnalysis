 The '''bluefish''' ('''''Pomatomus saltatrix''''') is a kind of [[fish]] which occurs in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Pacific]]. It is a [[pelagic]] fish, which means that it lives near the surface of the ocean. They can grow to a size of {{convert|150|cm}} and reach a weight of {{convert|15|kg}}. In the wild, they live to be about nine years old.  
 
 Bluefish are [[predator]]s: they hunt other fish, in small groups. Bluefish are caught commercially, and there is a problem with [[overfishing]].  
 
 Sometimes another species, [[Rock salmon]] or Coal fish is erroneously called Bluefish. 
 
 It is the only species in the family '''Pomatomidae''', in the genus '''''Pomatomus'''''. 
 
 One [[Extinction|extinct]] relative of the bluefish is ''[[Lophar|Lophar miocaenus]]'', from the Late [[Miocene]] of Southern [[California]].
