 '''A toddler''' is a very young [[child]] who is learning how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to [[communicate]] with others.  
 
 Most children are [[toilet]] trained while they are toddlers. 
 Even when toddlers can walk, they are often [[transport]]ed in a [[stroller]], [[buggy]], or [[pushchair]] when the walk is a long distance or when they're tired. Toddlerhood typically begins after age one and is over by the time the child is 4, but this can differ depending on the child.
