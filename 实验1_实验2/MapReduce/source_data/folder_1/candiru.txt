 '''Candiru''' ('''candirú''') ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], also known as '''canero''' or '''toothpick fish''') are [[parasite|parasitic]] [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[catfish]] and a member of the [[Trichomycteridae]] [[family (biology)|family]]. They can be found in the [[Amazon River]] and to the people who live there, they are the most feared fish in its waters, even over the [[piranha]]. < ref name= " Axelrod " > {{cite book|title=Exotic tropical fishes|last=Axelrod|first=Herbert R. ''et al'' 1996|year=1983|publisher=T.F.H. Publications|isbn=0-87666-543-1}} < /ref >  They are [[eel]]-shaped and [[translucency|translucent]], making them very difficult to see in the water. Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 & nbsp;inches (~15 & nbsp;cm) in length. 
 
 The area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], near [[Brazil]]'s inland city of [[Manaus]]. 
 
 == Parasitism and food == 
 Candiru are [[parasite]]s. Their ability to find [[Respiratory system|breath]] currents in the water allows them to swim into the [[gill]] openings of other [[wikt:aquatic|aquatic]] [[species]], where they feed on their prey's [[blood]]. 
 
 While the fish in the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood, fish in Stegophilinae may feed on [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], [[mucus]], or [[carrion]]. < ref name= " Schaefer " > {{cite journal|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5665/1/N3496.pdf|title=New and noteworthy Venezuelan glanapterygine catfishes (Siluriformes, Trichomycteridae), with discussion of their biogeography and psammophily|last=Schaefer, Scott A. ''et al'' 2005|journal=American Museum Novitates|year=2005|issue=3496|pages=1–27|doi=10.1206/0003-0082(2005)496[0001:NANVGC]2.0.CO;2|s2cid=19506818 |access-date=2009-01-11|archive-date=2008-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217172432/http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5665/1/N3496.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 To hunt for its prey, the Candirú lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals, such as [[urea]] and [[ammonia]] from the gills of other fish. Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill [[cavity]] and attaches itself with its spines. Then, it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes, which usually causes the victim to die. It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to [[Digestion|digest]] its food and wait for its next meal.   
 
 === Attacks on people === 
 These smaller species are known for being thought to invade and make use of a person's [[urethra]]. Even with reports as old as the 1800s, the first written case of the removal of a candiru from a person did not occur until 1997, and even that incident is not believed by everyone. < ref name= " Carvalho " > {{cite journal|url=http://www.mnhn.fr/sfi/cybium/numeros/pdf/272pdf/01.analysecarvalho.pdf|title=Analyse D'Ouvrage|last=de Carvalho, Marcelo R. 2003|journal=Cybium|volume=27|issue=2|pages=82|access-date=2009-01-11|archive-date=2009-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207093227/http://www.mnhn.fr/sfi/cybium/numeros/pdf/272pdf/01.analysecarvalho.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The idea that the fish are attracted by urine appears to be not right.
