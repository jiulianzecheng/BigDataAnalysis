 '''Lime''' is a green fruit, and the tree [[fruit]] itself. They are [[citrus]] fruits similar to [[lemon]]s. Citrus fruits like limes are rich in [[vitamin C]]. [[Sailor]]s from [[Britain]] were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with [[scurvy]]. This is how they got the [[nickname]] ''Limey''. There are several citrus trees whose fruits are called limes. They include the [[key lime]] ''Citrus aurantiifolia'', the [[Persian lime]], the [[kaffir lime]], and the [[desert lime]] ''Citrus glauca''. 
 
 Limes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow. Then they look like small round [[lemon]]s. 
 
 Lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks. Lime oils are often used in perfumes, used for cleaning, and used for [[aromatherapy]]. 
 
 Lime tastes acidic and [[bitter]]. Lime juice is also made from limes.
