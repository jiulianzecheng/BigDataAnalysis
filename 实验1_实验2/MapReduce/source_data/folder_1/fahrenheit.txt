 '''Fahrenheit''' (more precisely, a '''degree Fahrenheit''') is a [[unit of measurement]] used to measure temperature. The conversion rate to Celsius is C= 5/9 x (F − 32).  The degree Fahrenheit is abbreviated '''°F'''.

 ==History== 
 This temperature scale was made in 1724 by a German scientist named [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]].  In the twentieth century, the unit became less used, and the degree [[Celsius]] more used.  Fahrenheit is still often used in the [[United States]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], Fahrenheit is used on some websites, and on weather forecasts. The main reason for this is that the older population is more familiar with Fahrenheit. 
 
 The degree Fahrenheit is considered by many to be old fashioned and outdated way of measuring temperature. The degree Celsius has largely replaced Fahrenheit's use. 
 
 Overall, the use of the degree Fahrenheit is in decline throughout most of the world, with the USA being the main exception. 
 
 ==Examples== 
 *  
 On the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32° and boils at 212°. 
 * Room temperature is about 70 °F. 
 * A human's body temperature is usually close to 98.6 °F. 
 * [[Absolute zero]] is –459.67 °F.
