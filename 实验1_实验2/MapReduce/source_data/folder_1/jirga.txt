A '''jirga''' (sometimes spelt '''jirgah''') (Pashto / {{lang-ur|جرګه}}) is a tribal meeting of elders. The meeting makes decisions by [[consensus]]. It is mainly the [[Pashtun]] people who have theses meetings - but other people who live near the Pashtun also have these meetings to settle disputes. They are most common in [[Afghanistan]] and among the Pashtun in [[Pakistan]] near its border with Afghanistan. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan017434.pdf |title=Jirga - A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution... |access-date=2008-09-21 |archive-date=2006-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007192558/http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN017434.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Solving disputes== 
 The meeting is usually made to help solve a dispute between two people. The people involved in a dispute usually begin by finding a [[mediator]], choosing someone who is trusted to fairly solve the problem. The mediator can be a religious leader, a local notable, or someone who is known for helping to settle disputes.  
 
 The mediator hears from the two sides, and then forms a jirga of community elders, taking care to include supporters of both sides. After listening to both sides the jirga then comes to a decision. When the decision has been made the mediator then announces it. The jirga's decision has to be accepted.
