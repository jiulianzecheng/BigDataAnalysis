 The '''jaguar''' (''Panthera onca'') is a [[big cat]] ([[feline]]) of the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]''. It lives in [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]]. 
 
 The jaguar is the third-largest feline after the [[tiger]] and the [[lion]]. It is also the largest and most powerful feline in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. 
 
 Because of its spots, jaguars look like [[leopards]], though it is usually larger and stronger, and its behavior is more like that of a [[tiger]]. It likes to stay near [[water]], and like the [[tiger]], it is famous for being a big cat that enjoys [[swimming]]. It usually hunts alone. 
 
 The jaguar has a very powerful strong bite, even compared to other big cats. < ref name=Bite > {{cite journal | author = Stephen Wroe, Colin McHenry, and Jeffrey Thomason | title = Bite club: comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behavior in fossil taxa | year = 2006 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B |publisher=[[Royal Society]] | volume = 272 |issue=1563 | pmid = 15817436 |pages=619–625 | pmc = 1564077 | accessdate = 2006-08-07 | url = http://www.bio.usyd.edu.au/staff/research/swroe/Wroeetal2005Biteclub.pdf | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2986|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060921111410/http://www.bio.usyd.edu.au/staff/research/swroe/Wroeetal2005Biteclub.pdf |archivedate = September 21, 2006|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Because of its strong bite, jaguars can bite through [[armour]]ed [[reptile]]s like [[caiman]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[tortoise]]s. < ref name=HAMDIG > {{cite web | url = http://www.ecology.info/ecology-jaguar-puma.htm | first = Paul | last = Hamdig | title = Sympatric Jaguar and Puma | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | archive-date = 2008-02-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201022320/http://www.ecology.info/ecology-jaguar-puma.htm | url-status = bot: unknown }} < /ref >  Jaguars kill their [[prey]] in an unusual way: they bite directly through the [[skull]] between the [[ear]]s and into the [[brain]]. < ref > Rosa CL de la and Nocke, 2000.

 == Appearance == 
 Jaguars have yellow or sometimes yellow-orange fur with brown and black rosettes and spots. They are big and heavy and also have very strong muscles which makes them really powerful. They cannot climb well, but they can swim. 
 
 Sometimes there are jaguars who are completely black, but if you look closely you can still see the spots. They are called  " [[black panther]] "  or just  " [[panther]] " . 
 This is a 'colour morph' of the same species, a kind of [[polymorphism]]. 
 
 == [[Habitat]] == 
 Jaguars live in [[South America]] and [[Central America]]. They mostly live in [[rainforests]], but also in [[savannas]], [[swamps]], [[grasslands]], [[forest]], [[deserts]] and open areas. 
 
 == [[Life]] == 
 Jaguars are not specialized with their food, but eat almost anything they get: big and small [[mammals]], [[birds]], [[reptiles]], [[fish]] and [[livestock]]. It is an [[ambush]] [[predator]]. When hunting, they usually try to secretly get very close to the [[prey]], and then the jaguar suddenly jumps at it and throws it down. The jaguar bites the [[skull]] of its prey to kill it. It then takes the prey to a safe place and eats it. 
 
 After a [[pregnancy]] of about 100 days the female gives birth to usually 1 - 4 babies. The young leave their family after 1–2 years, and they become mature at about 3 years. Jaguars can live up to 10–12 years old in freedom, but in captivity (such as in [[zoo]]s) they can live to 20–22 years old.
