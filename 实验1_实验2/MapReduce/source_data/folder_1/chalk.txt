 '''Chalk''' is a type of [[limestone]]. It was made by calcareous (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ) skeletons of tiny [[plankton]]ic [[algae]] called [[coccolith]]s. They live in the sea in huge numbers. They make chalk (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) as a by-product of their [[photosynthesis]]. The chalk cliffs of [[Dover, Kent|Dover]] and elsewhere were made when England was below the [[equator]] in a tropical sea. It was in the [[Upper Cretaceous]], when the Earth was even warmer than now. There are coccoliths today, but not the same species as formed the white cliffs. 
 
 [[Air]] and [[water]] do not wear chalk away easily, so when chalk is next to the [[sea]], it often makes a large [[cliff]]. The  " [[White Cliffs of Dover]] "  in [[Kent]], [[England]] are a good example of this. Chalk holds water, so these chalk hills may have a lot of water in them. When the [[weather]] is very dry, water comes slowly from the chalk.  
 
 '''Blackboard chalk''' is not real chalk. It is really [[gypsum]] (calcium sulfate), but people call it  " chalk " . People use it for drawing on hard things, because it is soft. If this chalk is rubbed on something hard or rough, it will leave a mark. People often write with chalk on a chalkboard or [[blackboard]]. A chalk [[eraser]] or water can be used to clean the chalk marks away so the board is clean again. Shops usually sell blackboard chalk in sticks that are about 5 cm long. 
 
 There are also big pieces of soft chalk for children to write on the [[ground]] with, for example on [[concrete]] (such as a [[sidewalk]]) or on [[asphalt]]. It is usually okay to write on the ground with this kind of chalk, because the [[rain]] will wash the chalk away. 
 
 '''Tailors' chalk''' is not real chalk either. It is [[talc]] (magnesium silicate). [[Tailor]]s use it to draw on [[material]] when they are making clothes.
