 '''Nitrite''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is NO < sub > 2 < /sub > < sup > – < /sup > . It contains [[nitrogen]] in its +3 [[oxidation state]]. Nitrites are normally strong [[oxidizing agent]]s. Most of them are colorless [[crystalline]] compounds. [[Sodium nitrite]] is a common nitrite. They are also weak [[reducing agent]]s, being [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[nitrate]]s (NO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > – < /sup > ).
