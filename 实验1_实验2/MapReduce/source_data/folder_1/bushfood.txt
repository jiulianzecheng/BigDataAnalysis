 '''Bushfood''' (also called '''bush tucker''' in Australia) is any food native to [[Australia]] eaten by the original inhabitants, the [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aborigines]]. Most bushfoods are very [[nutrition|nutritious]]. < ref > Low, T., ''Wild Food Plants of Australia'', Angus  &  Robertson, 1992, pp 199-202 {{ISBN|0-207-16930-6}} < /ref >  Examples of native animal foods (meats) are [[kangaroo]], [[emu]] and [[crocodile]]. These are quite common and can be found in many [[supermarket]]s and [[restaurant]]s. Other animals, like [[lizard]]s and [[Larva|grubs]], were eaten by aboriginal (native) Australians, long before white people came to the area. It also includes [[fruit]]s and [[Berry|berries]]. The most famous native bushfood plant is the [[macadamia]] nut. This is farmed and sold in large numbers. 
 
 By the end of the 19th century, there were only less than 100.000 Aboriginal people. Since the arrival of the settlers, the native population died from new diseases, alcohol and poverty, as their native land was taken away from them. They had to move to places where they could not live in their traditional way. Most of their languages died out. Until the 1960s, children were taken away from their families and forced to live in children's homes („Stolen Generation“). The idea was to make them „good“ Australians by educating them „properly“.
