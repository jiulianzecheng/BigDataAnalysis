 '''Hispania''' was the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]{{efn|name=Note|The name Hispania was also used in the period of [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]].}} name for the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the provinces. Under the [[Roman Republic]], Hispania was divided into two [[Roman province|provinces]]: [[Hispania Citerior]] and [[Hispania Ulterior]].  
 
 During the beginning of the [[Roman Empire]], Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, [[Baetica]] and [[Lusitania]], while Hispania Citerior was renamed [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].  
 
 == Conquests == 
 === Roman conquest === 
 
 The Roman invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC and used it as a training ground for tactics against the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], the [[Iberians]], the [[Lusitanians]], the [[Gallaecia|Gallaecians]] and other [[Celts]].  
 
 Roman emperor [[Augustus]] was not able to complete the conquest until 19 BC. Much of Hispania remained [[Autonomy|autonomous]] until the end of the [[Cantabrian Wars]]. 
 
 === Germanic conquest ===

 In late 409 AD, the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], [[Suevi]] and [[Vandals]] moved into Iberia together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]]. The Suevi created a kingdom in [[Gallaecia]] and the [[Alans]] created a kingdom in [[Lusitania]]. 
 
 There were conflicts between the [[Chalcedonian]] natives and the [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Visigoths]]. In 589, [[Recared]] renounced his [[Arianism]] and accepted [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], this created an alliance between the Visigothic [[monarchy]] and the native Hispano-Romans. 
 
 ===Umayyad conquest===
