 ==Nautical mile== 
 The nautical mile is used for sea or air travel.  
 
 The nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of arc along a line of [[longitude]] of the Earth.  There are 60 minutes of arc in one degree or arc (60' & nbsp;= & nbsp;1°). So there were 10,800 nautical miles from the North Pole to the South Pole. 
 
 Now the nautical mile is defined as 1,852 [[metre]]s.

 The speed of a ship that travels one nautical mile in one hour is called one [[Knot (speed)|knot]] 
 
 ==Roman mile== 
 The mile was first used by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s.  It comes from the [[Latin]] phrase ''mille passus'' (plural: ''milia passuum'').  This means  " one thousand paces " . A pace is the distance each foot moves when taking one step.

 |1 Roman mile||= 1,000 Roman paces (by definition)

 ==Other miles== 
 Different miles have been used throughout history in various parts of the world. In [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], for example, a mil is a unit of length which is equal to 10 kilometres.
