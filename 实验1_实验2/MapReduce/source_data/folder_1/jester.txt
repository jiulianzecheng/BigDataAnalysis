 {{wiktionary}} 
 A '''jester''', '''joker''', '''fool''', or '''buffoon''', is a type of [[entertainment|entertainer]] mostly (but not always) associated with the [[Middle Ages]]. Jesters typically wore brightly colored clothing. Their hats, sometimes called the ''cap ’n bells'' or ''cockscomb'', were special; made of cloth, they were floppy with three points (liliripes) each of which had a [[jingle bell]] at the end.  
 
 The three points of the hat represent the [[donkey|asses]]' ears and tail worn by jesters when they first appeared. Other typical things about the jester were his constant [[laughter]] and his [[mock]] [[scepter]], known as a ''bauble'' or ''maharoof.''
