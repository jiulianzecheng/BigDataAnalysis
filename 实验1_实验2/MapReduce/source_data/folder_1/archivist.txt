[[Image:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An Archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]] 
 
 An '''archivist''' is a professional who  collects, organizes, [[preservation|preserves]], maintains control over, and provides access to information determined to have long-term value.  The information maintained by an archivist can be any form of [[media]] ([[photograph]]s, [[video]] or [[sound recording]]s, letters, documents, [[electronic record]]s, etc.). 
 
 As Richard Pearce-Moses wrote,  
 '' " Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records. " ''  < ref > Pearce-Moses, Richard.  " Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist? "  ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006. < /ref > 
 
 Determining what records have enduring value is not always easy.  Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description,  and reference service. < ref > {{cite book | first=Gregory| last=Hunter |year=2003 |title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives| location=New York | publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. | url=http://www.neal-schuman.com/db/3/353.html }} < /ref >   The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archives]] practices is called [[archival science]].
