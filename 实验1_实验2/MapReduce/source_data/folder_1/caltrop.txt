 '''Caltrops''' are spiked weapons used against men and horses since at least as early as [[Roman army|Roman times]]. < ref > There are different spellings of this word, such as ''caltrap'' or ''galtrop''. < /ref >  Later versions were designed to deflate automobile tires. They are a type of [[anti-personnel weapon]], and anti-vehicular weapon. Japanese [[samurai]] used a similar weapon, the [[makibishi]]. 
 
 Iron caltrops were used as early as 331 BC at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. They were known to the Romans as ''tribulus'', meaning 'jagged iron'. < ref name=Lewis > Lewis, Charlton T.  &  Short, Charles 1879. ''A Latin dictionary''. < /ref >  They were used in the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 51 BC. < ref > {{cite book|last=Jarymowycz|first=Roman Johann|title=Cavalry from hoof to track: the quest for mobility |year=2007|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-98726-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQDBUgwGae4C & dq=Makibishi & pg=PA21|page=20}} < /ref > 
 
 The Roman writer [[Vegetius]], discussed  [[scythe]]d [[chariot]]s in his ''De Re Militari'': 
 
 {{quote|The armed chariots used in war by [[Antiochus]] and [[Mithridates]] at first terrified the Romans, but they afterwards made a jest of them. As a chariot of this sort does not always meet with plain and level ground, the least obstruction stops it. And if one of the horses be either killed or wounded, it falls into the enemy's hands. The [[Roman legion|Roman soldiers]] rendered them useless... they strewed the field of battle with caltrops, and the horses that drew the chariots, running full speed on them, were infallibly destroyed. A caltrop is a device composed of four spikes or points arranged so that in whatever manner it is thrown on the ground, it rests on three and presents the fourth upright. < ref > {{cite book| url=http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~madsb/home/war/vegetius/dere07.php#21| title=The Military Institutions of the Romans Book III: Dispositions for Action| first=Flavius Vegetius| last=Renatus| year=390| chapter=Armed chariots and elephants| access-date=2014-10-24| archive-date=2005-12-24| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224005323/http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~madsb/home/war/vegetius/dere07.php#21| url-status=dead}} < /ref > }} 
 
 In more modern times, they were used by both the Allies and Axis during [[World War II]] to puncture the tires of wheeled vehicles. Improvised caltrops, usually made of welded nails, have also been used occasionally by labor activists in the [[United States]] during strikes to destroy the tires of vehicles belonging to management and replacement workers. In the labor context, these devices are more often called '''jack rocks'''. A recent example of the use of jack rocks in labor disputes was in 2012, allegedly by two men on a picket line at an aluminum products plant in West Virginia. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201208090085 |title=Two arrested in strike at Constellium |first=Paul J. |last=Nyden |newspaper=The Charleston Gazette |location=[[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston, WV]] |date=August 9, 2012 |access-date=July 9, 2015}} < /ref >
