{{Infobox unbipentium}}'''''Unbipentium''''' is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka-neptunium. 
 The atomic number of this element is 125. It has the symbol '''''Ubp'''''. The name Unbipentium and the symbol Ubp are temporary [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names. This name and symbol exist until a permanent name is decided. It is expected to be a g-block element and an super[[actinides]]. It is the sixth element in the eighth period of the periodic table. 
 
 The synthesis of unbipentium was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of [[Americium]]-238 with [[zinc]]-65 ions at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]:
