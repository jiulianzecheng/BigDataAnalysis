[[Image:Red sofa.jpg|thumb|Couches come in many kinds of colors such as red.]] 
 A '''couch''', '''sofa''' or '''settee''' is a kind of [[furniture]] that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the [[living room]] or in front of the [[Television|TV]]. 
 
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest. < ref > {{Cite web

 Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In [[Greece|Greek]] places, there were flowing designs with all kind of [[elegant]] colors. Many of them had [[scroll|scrolled]] ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age. 
 
 == Expression == 
 Because the couch is usually set in front of the [[TV]], it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a  " couch potato " . This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. < ref > {{Cite web

 == Types == 
 The most common types of couches in homes are the  " love seats "  for two, or the  " sofa "  for more than two.  Other couches include the ''divan'' or the  " ''fainting couch'' " , which usually does not have a back.  Couches are usually bought in a set together with [[cushion]]s, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch.
