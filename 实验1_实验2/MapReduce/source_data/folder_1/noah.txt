 '''Noah''' (meaning rest or comfort < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|5:29}} < /ref > ) is a man in the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. He was the son of Lamech, and the father of sons, [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], and [[Japhet|Japheth]]. Noah and his [[Noah's Ark|ark]] are in the Book of [[Genesis]], which also describes Noah as the 'first man to plant a [[vineyard]]' (chapter 9). Several other parts of the Bible mention him, as does the [[Quran]].

 As described in the [[Genesis|Book of Genesis]], < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|6-9}} < /ref >  Noah and his family kept believing in [[God]] in a time when most people did not. Knowing this was true, [[God]] told Noah he was going to [[flood]] the world, so he could drown out [[evil]]. He told Noah to build a boat called an ''ark''. Noah was to put himself, his family and two (a [[male]] and a [[female]]) of every kind of [[animal]] that wasnâ€™t [[Kosher|clean]] on it but seven of every kind of animal that was [[Kosher|clean]] on it. People laughed at Noah, but they were killed by the flood. Noah and his family stayed on the ark until they reached land. To find land Noah sent out a [[dove]], which returned with an [[Olive tree|olive]] [[branch]]. < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|8:8-12}} < /ref >  After the flood, God made a [[rainbow]] as a [[promise]] to say that he would never destroy the [[Earth]] by flood again. < ref > {{bibleverse|Genesis||8:20-9:17}} < /ref >  When they were able to walk on dry land, the animals were released and they were able to repopulate the earth.
