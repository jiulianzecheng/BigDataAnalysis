The '''NKVD'''  < ref > ''Narodny komissariat vnutrennikh del'' {{Audio|ru-NKVD.ogg|listen}} < /ref >  People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs ([[Russian language|Russian]] : НКВД ; Народный Комиссариат Внутренних Дел) as a [[Ministry (government department)|government department]] in the [[Soviet Union]] operated from 1934 to 1946 . It was the law enforcement agency which did the will of the All Union Communist Party. The NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure changed three times. It was lead by [[Genrikh Yagoda|Genrikh Yagoda (1891-1938)]] (Chief from 1934 to 1938) [[Nikolai Yezhov|Nikolai Yezhov (1895-1938)]] (Chief from 1936 to 1938) and [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrentiy Beria (1899-1953)]] (Chief from 1938 to 1945). Both Yagoda and Yezhov were executed in 1938 and 1940. Beria was removed from power and executed in 1953. 
 
 The public face of the NKVD was the regular [[police]] force, which acted in a similar way to other police forces. In addition to its state security and police functions, some of its departments handled other matters, such as transportation, fire guards, border guards (NKVD border troops), etc. These jobs were usually assigned to the Ministry of the Interior (MVD). 
 
 However, it is the classified (secret) activities for which it was really feared. This was the work of the Main Directorate for State Security, known as the GUGB. The NKVD also included the Soviet [[secret police]]. The GUGB protected the state security of the Soviet Union. This was done by massive political repression, including the use of sanctioned political murders and assassinations, especially in the era of [[Joseph Stalin]], during the [[Great Purge]].

 == During and after the war == 
 In occupied territories, the NKVD carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions of traitors, Nazi collaborators, and other dangerous people. Resistance movements included the Polish Armia Krajowa (which was neither pro-nazi or communist), and leftover Ukrainian Nazi units (aiming to remain separate from the Soviet Union). 
 
 NKVD officers executed tens of thousands of [[NKVD prisoner massacres|Polish political prisoners]] in 1939–1941, including the [[Katyn massacre|Katyń massacre]]. < ref > {{cite book|url=http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf|title=History Documentary film: The Soviet Story|author=Edvins Snore|publisher=SIA Labvakar|year=2008|location=Riga, Latvia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824074927/http://www.sovietstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/soviet-story-press-kit-march-2010.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-24|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|url=http://thepeoplescube.com/peoples-blog/the-soviet-story-a-must-see-for-all-students-of-history-t13314.html|title=History documentary – a must-see for all students of history |author=Red Square|year=2014|publisher=The Peoples Cube |accessdate=2014-03-11}} < /ref >  NKVD units were also used to quell the post-Nazi partisan war in the western [[Ukraine]] (Mostly in the Lviv region), and the  " Forest Brothers "  in the [[Baltic states|Baltics]] (which lasted until the early 1950s). < ref > {{Cite web|title='Do Not Respond': did the Soviet Government abandon its WWII prisoners? |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/do-not-respond-did-the-soviet-government-abandon-its-wwii-prisoners-/29217414.html|access-date=2020-08-11|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en}} < /ref >
