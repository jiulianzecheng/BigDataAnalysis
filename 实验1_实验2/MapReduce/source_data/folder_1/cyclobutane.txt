 '''Cyclobutane''' is a [[cycloalkane]] [[organic compound]] with the formula (CH < sub > 2) < /sub > < sub > 4 < /sub > < sub > , < /sub >  a colorless gas at room temperature. Cyclobutane is usually sold as a liquified gas (a gas that has been pressurized or frozen to be in a state that isn't natural). Variants of cyclobutane are called cyclobutanes. Cyclobutane has no uses in commerce or [[biological|biology]], < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cyclobutane - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/cyclobutane|access-date=2022-03-29|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref >  but compounds containing cyclobutane are important in biology and [[Biotechnology|biotechnology.]]   
 
 == Structure == 
 The [[carbon]] [[Atom|atoms]] within cyclobutane are at odd angles. Cyclobutane is [[unstable]] and will break at temperatures over about 500Â° celcius. Cyclobutane is connected to itself in a ladder-like structure. An example of this structure can be seen in in pentacycloanammoxic [[acid]]. This compound is a ladderane made up of five connected cyclobutane units.
