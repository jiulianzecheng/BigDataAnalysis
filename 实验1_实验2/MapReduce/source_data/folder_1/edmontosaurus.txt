 '''Edmontosaurus''' is a basal [[duck-billed dinosaur]] from the latest [[Cretaceous]] stage. It had short arms, a long, pointed tail, three-toed, hoofed feet, and mitten-like hands. Its head was flat and sloping with a wide, toothless beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground up its food. It is the same animal as'' Anatotitan''. There are two [[species]], and the animal has been called by several other names in the past.'' 
 
 ''Edmontosaurus'' was named from a fossil found in the  Horseshoe Canyon Formation, < ref > Formerly called the lower Edmonton Formation. < /ref >  in [[Alberta]], Canada. Many'' Edmontosaurus ''fossils have been found, in Alberta, and [[Alaska]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]] and [[New Jersey]] in the [[United States|USA]]. Two mummified'' Edmontosaurus ''fossils were found in Wyoming.'' 
 
 The distribution of its fossils suggests that it preferred [[coast]]s and coastal [[plains]]. It could move on two legs and on four. Because it is known from several bone beds, ''Edmontosaurus'' is thought to have lived in groups. It may have been [[migratory]].

 Most of the back and tail was lined by bony [[tendon]]s arranged in a [[lattice]] along the [[neural spines]] of the vertebrae. < ref > Neural spine =  bit that sticks up < /ref >   This made the back and part of the tail  " ramrod "  straight. < ref name=JHO64 > {{cite journal |doi=10.2475/ajs.262.8.975 |last=Ostrom |first=John H. |year=1964 |authorlink=John Ostrom |title=A reconsideration of the paleoecology of the hadrosaurian dinosaurs |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=262 |pages=975–997 |issue=8}} < /ref > < ref name=PMG70 > {{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |year=1970 |title=The posture of hadrosaurian dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-paleontology_1970-05_44_3/page/464 |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=464–473}} < /ref >  The ossified tendons strengthened the vertebral column against [[gravitation]]al stress.

 As a hadrosaurid, ''Edmontosaurus'' was a large terrestrial [[herbivory|herbivore]]. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. < ref name=HWF04 > Horner, John R; Weishampel, David B.  &  Forster, Catherine A 2004.
