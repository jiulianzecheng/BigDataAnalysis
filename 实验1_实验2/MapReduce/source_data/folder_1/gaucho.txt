 '''''Gaucho''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈɡautʃo|lang}}) or '''''Gaúcho''''' ({{IPA-pt|ɡaˈuʃu|lang}}) is the term commonly used for people who live in the south regions of [[Brazil]], mainly in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It can also be used for people from [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. They are similar to the [[North America]]n [[cowboy]]s, and, like them, gauchos of Argentina have become a [[symbol]] of freedom. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Working with his [[horse]], a [[lasso|laço]], ''boleodoros'', and a knife, gauchos rode around the Pampas, killing wild [[cattle]] whose [[:en:hides|hides]] he sold secretly. < ref name=fly > {{cite book |last= Koontz |first= Terri |author2= Mark Sidwell, S.M.Bunker |title= World Studies for Christian Schools |publisher= Bob Jones University Press |date= June 2005|location= Greenville, SC |page= |url= |isbn= 1-59166-431-4}} < /ref >  They were usually [[:en:outlaw|outlaws]], and did not become [[decent|respectable]] until they fought with San Martin for Argentine freedom. < ref name=fly/ >  After some time, many gauchos began working for ''hacendados'' and spent their lives helping huge herds of [[cattle]] over the Pampas. They liked to choose where they worked and traveled from place to place. < ref name=fly/ > 
 
 == Description == 
 Like cowboys, gauchos had a traditional outfit: a big hat, a collared shirt (mainly red), and baggy pants called ''bombachas'', < ref name=fly/ >  which were tucked into [[leather]] boots. Colorful pieces of cloth or a wide leather belt decorated with silver went around his waist, and silver [[spurs]] were on his boots. When working, gauchos often wore a big leather apron. < ref name=fly/ > 
 
 Today, though, most gauchos are disappearing. Trucks, roads, and fences are changing gauchos into farmers and assistants. Traditional dress is usually worn only on festival days, < ref name=fly/ >  when they can remember their exciting old days.
