[[File:Isobates-simple example.svg|thumb|Isobates to show depths of water basin.]]'''Hydrography''' is a subject of [[Geography]]. It concerns itself with measuring the physical characteristics of [[water]]s, such as [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ocean]]s. < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/278837/hydrography Britannica Online Encyclopedia] < /ref >  It can also be about such measurement in [[navigation|navigable]] waters, as they are necessary for the safe passage of [[ship]]s and [[vessel]]s. 
 
 Massive hydrographical studies are usually undertaken by national or international organizations that sponsor [[Information|data]] collection through [[surveying|surveys]] and publication of [[chart]]s and descriptive materials for navigational purposes. < ref > [http://nhd.usgs.gov National Hydrography Dataset] < /ref >   
 
 Hydrography's origin lies in the making of chart like drawings and notations made by individual [[Marine (military)|marine]]rs. It was usually a private [[property]], even closely held [[secret]]s, used for commercial or [[military]] advantage.
