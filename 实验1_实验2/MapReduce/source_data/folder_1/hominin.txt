 '''Hominini''' is the tribe of [[Homininae|african apes]] that comprises [[human]]s (''Homo''), and all ancestors of ''Homo sapiens'' back to the split from the apes. This branching is now dated at five to eight million years ago, with ''[[Sahelanthropus]]'' as a key [[fossil]]. < ref > Wood B. 2010. Reconstructing human evolution: achievements, challenges, and opportunities. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' '''107''': 8902–8909.

 A less frequent usage includes the two species present-day of the [[genus]] ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' (the [[common chimpanzee]] and the [[bonobo]]). In this case, the subtribe [[Hominina]] is the  " human "  branch, including genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' and its close relatives, but not ''Pan''. All species in this tribe carry the same four blood-types which can be exchanged between species.

 [[File:Homininae.svg|center|frame|[[Tree of life (biology)|Evolutionary tree]] of the superfamily [[Hominoidea]]. 
 It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons ([[Hylobatidae]]) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily [[Ponginae]] broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe [[Hominini]] (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe [[Gorilla|Gorillini]]]]
