 '''''Ardipithecus''''' is a very early [[hominid]] [[genus]], which lived during the late [[Neogene]]. 
 
 Two [[species]] are known: ''A. kadabba'', dated to about 5.6 million years ago (late [[Miocene]]), < ref name= " AndThePaleobiology " > {{cite journal |last=White |first=Tim D.|year=2009|title=Ardipithecus ramidus'' and the paleobiology of early hominids |journal=Science |volume=326 |issue=5949 |pages=75–86 |doi=10.1126/science.1175802 |pmid=19810190|s2cid=20189444}} < /ref >  and ''A. ramidus'', which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early [[Pliocene]]. < ref name= " NatGeo-News " > {{cite web

 Because this genus shares several traits with the African [[great ape]] genera (''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' and ''[[Gorilla]]''), some place it on the that branch rather than human branch.  
 
 Most consider it a proto-human because of a likeness in teeth with ''[[Australopithecus]]''. ''Ardipithecus'' had [[bipedalism]] and reduced [[canine]]s, like the [[Australopithecine]]s.
