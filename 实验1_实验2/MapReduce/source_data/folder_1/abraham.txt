 '''Abraham''' (originally '''Abram''') is a man in the [[Book of Genesis]] and the [[Qur'an]]. There, he is said to be the father of all [[Jew]]s. This is because he is their [[ancestor]]. Abraham is part of the [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic [[religion]]s. Abraham is considered the father of these three religions, which are called [[Abrahamic religion]]s. 
 
 Abraham is the father of [[Isaac]] with his wife [[Sarah]]. He also has [[Ishmael]] with [[Hagar]], Sarah's [[maid|handmaid]], and he has other children with [[Keturah]], whom he marries after [[Sarah]]'s death. He is the grandfather of [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]]. Abraham is believed to be the founding patriarch of the [[Israelites]], [[Ishmaelites]] and [[Edomites]]. Abraham was the son of [[Terah]] and the grandson of [[Nahor (son of Serug)]]. Abraham's older brothers were named [[Nahor (son of Terah)]] and [[Haran]]. 
 
 ==The Covenant of Abraham== 
 In the [[Book of Genesis]], Abraham leaves his home in [[Mesopotamia]] for [[Canaan]] because the Almighty told him to go there and become the [[ancestor]] of a great [[nation]]. At the time, his name was Abram but then the Almighty told him to [[circumcise]] himself and all his sons and that “the un[[circumcised]] [[male]] who dwells among you, his [[soul]] shall be cut off, for he has rejected my [[covenant]]” and after his [[circumcision]] Abram changed his [[name]] to Abraham. 
 
 ==The Binding of Isaac== 
 When Abraham was [[circumcised]], the Almighty told him that his [[wife]] [[Sarah]] would give [[birth]] to a [[son]] but Abraham laughed because of how old he was and asked the Almighty to give a [[blessing]] to [[Ishmael]]. The Almighty told Abraham that he would bless Ishmael and that Sarah would give birth to a [[son]] whose [[children]] would inherit what the Almighty promised Abraham.  
 
 After Abraham’s [[circumcision]] three [[angel]]s pretending to be [[human]]s came to him and told him that in one year his wife [[Sarah]] would give birth to a [[son]] but she [[laugh]]ed since Abraham was 100 years old (and she was 90) but the angels said that nothing is impossible for the Almighty. One year later, Sarah gave birth to a son. Abraham circumcised him and named him [[Isaac]] because of the [[laughter]]. Years after [[Hagar]] and [[Ishmael]] were sent away, the Almighty told Abraham “take your son, your only one, whom you [[love]] [[Isaac]] and [[sacrifice]] him” and Abraham took Isaac to a [[mountain]] to be a [[human sacrifice]] but then the Almighty sent an [[angel]] to Abraham to stop him from [[killing]] Isaac and said that “I have seen that you are indeed a [[God]] [[fear]]ing [[man]] since you have not withheld your son, your only one from me” so Abraham [[sacrifice]]d a [[ram]] instead of [[Isaac]]. And Abraham named the [[place]] Yireh. 
 
 ==Later life== 
 After Abraham’s [[wife]] Sarah died when she was 127 years old, Abraham bought the [[Cave]] of Machpelah from Ephron the [[Hittite]] for 400 [[shekel]]s and buried Sarah there. He then sent his [[servant]] to find a [[wife]] for [[Isaac]]. Then Abraham married Keturah and became the [[father]] of many [[children]]. Abraham [[died]] when he was 175 years old and [[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]] buried him next to Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah. 
 
 ==Abraham and the Idol Shop== 
 According to a [[midrash]] in the [[Talmud]], when Abraham was young, his [[father]] [[Terah]] told him to take care of his [[Shop|store]] selling [[idol]]s but instead Abraham destroyed them except the biggest one and told Terah that it had destroyed the rest and Terah told him that idols are [[mind]]less [[statues]] and not [[deities]] so they couldn’t have done that. Then Abraham asked Terah why he [[worship]]ped them so Terah took him to [[King]] [[Nimrod]] who tried to [[kill]] him by [[burning]] him in a [[furnace]] but a [[miracle]] saved Abraham. So Nimrod asked Abraham’s [[brother]] Haran what he believed and Haran said he believed in the [[deity]] of Abraham because He would save him with a [[miracle]]. Then Nimrod threw Haran to the [[furnace]] and he died and Nimrod sent away Terah and his [[family]]. And then the Almighty told Abraham to go to [[Canaan]].
