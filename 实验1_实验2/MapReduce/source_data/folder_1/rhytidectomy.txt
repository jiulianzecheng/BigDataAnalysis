A '''rhytidectomy''' (commonly called a '''facelift''') is a type of [[cosmetic surgery]] procedure used to make a person's [[face]] look younger. Rhytidectomy usually involves the removal of excess facial [[skin]], which cause [[wrinkles]], and the redraping of the skin on the [[patient]]'s face and [[neck]]. The tightening of underlying [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the face is optional. Nearly 112,955 face lift procedures were performed in the United States in the year 2010 alone according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.  < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.plasticsurgery.org/news-and-resources/statistics.html |title=Plastic Surgery Procedural Statistics  & #124; American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) |access-date=2013-03-06 |archive-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226024356/http://www.plasticsurgery.org/News-and-Resources/Statistics.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web| url= https://plasticspot.io/plastic-surgery-calgary |title= Plastic Surgery Calgary }} Friday, June 5, 2020  < /ref >
