It also owns a [[mobile phone]] company, Verizon Wireless. Verizon was created in 2000 by merging GTE and Bell Atlantic.

 In 2015, Verizon bought the [[Internet]] company [[AOL]], and the next year it bought [[Yahoo!]]. Both of these purchases were for about [[United States dollar|US$]]4.4 billion. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-buying-yahoo-likely-merging-it-with-aol/|title=Verizon to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion, merge it with AOL|date=2016-07-25|work=CNET|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}} < /ref >  Today, both AOL and Yahoo! are part of a [[subsidiary]] created by Verizon called [[Oath Inc.]] < ref > {{Cite web|last=Heater|first=Brian|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/03/yahoo-aol-oath-for-some-reason/|title=Yahoo + AOL = Oath, for some reason|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|date=2017-04-03|access-date=2018-03-18}} < /ref >
