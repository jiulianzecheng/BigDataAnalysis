 '''Selfridges''', also known as '''Selfridges  &  Co.''', is a chain of large [[Department store|department stores]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that is operated by Selfridges Retail Limited, part of the Selfridges Group of department stores. It was founded by [[Harry Gordon Selfridge]] in 1908. 
 
 The historic Daniel Burnham-designed Selfridges flagship store at 400 [[Oxford Street]] in London is the second-largest shop in the UK (after [[Harrods]]). It opened on 15 March 1909. Other Selfridges stores opened in [[Manchester]] at the [[Trafford Centre]] (1998) and [[Exchange Square]] (2002), and in [[Birmingham]] at the [[Bullring]] (2003). 
 
 During the 1940s, smaller Selfridges stores were sold to the [[John Lewis Partnership]], and in 1951, the original Oxford Street store was bought by the [[Liverpool]]-based [[Lewis's]] chain of department stores. Lewis's and Selfridges were then taken over in 1965 by the [[Sears Group]], owned by [[Charles Clore]]. The business expanded under the Sears Group to include branches in Manchester and Birmingham. It was bought in 2003 by [[Canada]]'s [[Galen Weston]] for £598 million. In December 2021, the Weston family agreed to sell the majority of Selfridges Group for around £4 billion to a [[joint venture]] between [[Thailand|Thai]] conglomerate [[Central Group]] and [[Austria]]'s [[Signa Holding]]. 
 
 Selfridges  &  Co. was named the Best Department Store in the World in 2010, 2012  and 2014. < ref > [http://www.selfridges.com/en/StaticPage/Our+Heritage/  " Our Heritage. "  Selfridges  &  Co. , n.d.  Web. 20 May 2014.] < /ref > 
 
 It is owned by the [[Signa Holding]] group, which is owned by [[Austria|Austrian]] [[real estate]] [[billionaire]] [[René Benko]].
