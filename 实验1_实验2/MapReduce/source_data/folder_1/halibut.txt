 '''Halibut''' is a kind of [[flatfish]] often used for [[food]]. There are two different kinds of halibut - Atlantic halibut (''Hippoglossus hippoglossus'') and Pacific halibut (''Hippoglossus stenolepis''). The halibut from the Atlantic ocean has been [[overfishing|overfished]]. 
 
 Their names come from ''haly'' (holy) and ''butt'' (flat fish), because it is said people like to eat them on [[Catholicism|Catholic]] holy-days. < ref > ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' < /ref >
