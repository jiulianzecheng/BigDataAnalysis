 '''Mozambique''', officially the '''Republic of Mozambique''', is a [[country]] in southeastern [[Africa]]. Its capital is [[Maputo]]. There are about 31 million people. In 1975, Mozambique became independent from [[Portugal]]. (National Day on 25th June, 1975) The country was named Moçambique by the Portuguese after the [[Island of Mozambique]] which was the capital of Portuguese Africa. After independence from Portugal it became the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]].  There was a big [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] from 1977 to 1992. 
 
 Mozambique has many natural resources. [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[Belgium]] are among the country's most important partners.  It is the second poorest country in the world. They have the world's lowest [[life expectancy]]. In 2012, large natural gas reserves were found in Mozambique.  The revenues from the reserves might dramatically change the economy. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120509-716501.html |work=WSJ.com |accessdate=10 May 2012 |date=9 May 2012 |title=UPDATE: Mozambique Talks To Shell On Developing LNG  |author=Alexis Flynn}} < /ref > 
 
 The only official language of Mozambique is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. About half the people speak it as a second language and very few as a first language. Languages widely spoken natively include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], and [[Sena language|Sena]]. The largest religion in Mozambique is [[Christianity]].  There are also [[Muslim]] and African traditional religious minorities. 
 
 Mozambique is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], the [[Latin Union]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and [[Southern African Development Community]]. 
 
 == Geography and climate == 
 At {{convert|309475|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Mozambique is the world's 35th-largest country. It is bordered by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east, [[Tanzania]] to the north, [[Malawi]] and [[Zambia]] to the northwest, [[Zimbabwe]] to the west and [[Swaziland]] and [[South Africa]] to the southwest. 
 
 The country is divided into two regions by the [[Zambezi River]]. To the north of the Zambezi River, the narrow coastline moves inland to hills and low [[plateau]]s.  Further west are rugged highlands, which include the [[Niassa]] highlands, [[Namuli]] or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, [[Tete]] highlands and the [[Makonde (District)|Makonde]] plateau, covered with [[miombo]] woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and [[Lebombo mountains]] in the deep south. 
 
 [[Image:Gurue Mount Murresse.jpg|thumb|left|475px|Mount Murresse and [[tea]] plantations near [[Gurúè]], [[Zambezia Province]], northern Mozambique]] 
 
 The country has five main rivers and several smaller ones.  The largest and most important is the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: [[Lake Niassa]] (or Malawi), [[Lake Chiuta]], [[Lake Cahora Bassa]] and [[Lake Shirwa]], all in the north.

[[Cyclone]]s are common during the wet season. Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from {{convert|13|to|24|C|F|1}} in July to {{convert|22|to|31|C|F|1}} in February. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://fortuneofafrica.com/mozambique/mozambique-profile/|title=Mozambique Profile|date=June 20, 2014}} < /ref >

 ==Divisions== 
 [[Image:Maputo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A panoramic view of [[Maputo]], the capital of Mozambique and the largest city in the country. Maputo city is separate from the [[Maputo Province]].]] 
 
 Mozambique is divided into ten [[province]]s (''provincias'') and one capital city (''cidade capital'') with provincial status. The provinces are divided into 129 [[district]]s (''distritos''). The districts are further divided in 405  " Postos Administrativos "  (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 43  " Municípios "  (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique.

 ==Culture== 
 ===Arts=== 
 The music of Mozambique can be for many purposes.  These can be religious or for traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used include [[drums]] made of wood and animal skin; the ''lupembe'', a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the [[marimba]], which is a kind of [[xylophone]] native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the [[Chopi]] of the south central coast. They are famous for their musical skill and dance. 
 
 The [[Makonde people|Makonde]] are renowned for their [[wood carving]] and elaborate masks that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings. [[Shetani]], (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy [[ebony]], tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The [[Ujamaa]] are [[totemism|totem-type]] carvings which show lifelike faces of people and various figures. Theses sculptures are usually called “family trees” because they tell stories of many generations. 
 
 During the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art showed the [[oppression]] by the colonial power, and became a symbol of the [[resistance]].   After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter [[Malangatana Ngwenya]] and the sculptor [[Alberto Chissano]]. Art during the 1980s and 1990s shows the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation and struggle. 
 
 [[Dances]] are usually highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually [[ritual]]istic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of [[Makua (people)|Makua]] dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country have a traditional dance called [[Tufo (dance)|''tufo'']], to celebrate [[Islam]]ic holidays. < ref > {{Cite book  | last = Fitzpatrick  | first =Mary  | title = Mozambique  | publisher = [[Lonely Planet]]  | year = 2007  | pages = 33  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DVvRHCBtS9sC  | isbn =978-1-74059-188-1 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Food=== 
 Because the Portuguese were there for nearly 500 years, they greatly impacted the cuisine of Mozambique. Crops such as [[cassava]] (a starchy root) and [[cashew nuts]] (Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts), and ''pãozinho'' were brought in by the Portuguese. The use of [[spices]] and [[seasonings]] such as [[onions]], [[bay leaves]], [[garlic]], fresh [[coriander]], [[paprika]], [[chili peppers]], red sweet peppers, and [[wine]] were introduced by the Portuguese.  So was [[sugarcane]], [[maize]], [[millet]], [[rice]], [[sorghum]] (a type of grass), and [[potatoes]]. ''Prego'' (steak roll), ''rissois'' (battered shrimp), ''espetada'' ([[kebab]]), ''pudim'' ([[pudding]]), and the popular ''inteiro com piripiri'' (whole chicken in [[piri-piri]] sauce) are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique. 
 
 ===Entertainment=== 
 [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Mozambique.
