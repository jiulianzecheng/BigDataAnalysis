 A '''van''' is a type of [[vehicle]]. A van can carry either [[goods]] or people. Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a [[pickup truck]], [[hatchback]], [[station wagon]], and [[SUV]], A van is usually bigger than the regular sized [[car]], but relatively smaller than a [[truck]]/[[lorry]] or a [[bus]]. Panel vans (vans whose cargo space has no side windows) are used for deliveries and carrying goods. These usually have large cargo space and few windows. A van which is used to carry people is often called a ''[[minibus]]''. It can usually carry many people, sometimes up to a total of 15.  
 
 Unlike a [[pickup truck]], many companies make vans, including [[Chevrolet]], [[Daihatsu]], [[Dodge]], [[Fiat]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[GMC]], [[Honda]], [[Hyundai]], [[Isuzu]], [[Mazda]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[Suzuki]], [[Toyota]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], and [[Volkswagen]]. 
 
 You may usually drive a van with the same [[driver's license]] as an ordinary car, but the heaviest and largest vans may require a [[truck]] licence.
