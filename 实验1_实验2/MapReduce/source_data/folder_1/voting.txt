 '''Voting''' is when a group of people decide something by saying what they want. It can be for [[Election|electing]] a leader or representative, passing a [[law]], and other things. When people are done voting, the votes are counted (often by [[machine]]s) and the winner is determined. 
 
 Voting can be done in small groups (friends deciding what to do over weekend), societies (building committee deciding on whether to paint a building), nations (voting for president or - in some cases - voting for independence) and global ([[United Nations]] deciding how to limit [[nuclear weapon]] development).  
 
 Usually the side that gets most votes will win. This is called [[majority rule]]. The right to vote is called [[suffrage]]. 
 
 In some cases, a certain percentage may be needed to win a vote. This is often the case when voting to change the [[constitution]] of a country, or when electing a [[government]] official. When choosing a government official, there may be several rounds. In the first round, votes can be cast for all candidates. In the second round, only the two or three candidates with the most votes can be chosen. 
 Voting is done in democratic government. 
 
 There may also be different systens: In some cases, each person has one vote. Other systems may be like ranking, such as picking the three options the person sees most suitable, for example out of five. 
 
 Especially in bigger votes, it is often not be possible to track who cast a certain vote.
