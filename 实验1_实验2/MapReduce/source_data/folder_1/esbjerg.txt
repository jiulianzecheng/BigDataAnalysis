 '''Esbjerg''' is a city in [[Denmark]], on the [[peninsula]] [[Jutland]]. 
 
 It has about 82,000 [[inhabitant]]s and is the 5th largest city of [[Denmark]]. The growing began in the [[1860s]], because Denmark lost its [[North Sea]] [[harbor]]s to [[Prussia]] in the Danish-Prussian-Austrian war. 
 The new harbor was built in Esbjerg.
