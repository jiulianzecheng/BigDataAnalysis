 ==History== 
 Named for its SIMple SYNtax, Symsyn is based on Free Pascal, which is based on Pascal, developed by [[Niklaus Wirth]] and named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist [[Blaise Pascal]]. 
 
 ==Language== 
 Symsyn has a simple syntax and short learning curve.  It provides access to functionality found in more sophisticated languages, such as the free version of the [[Pascal]] programming language, [[Free Pascal]]. < ref name=fp > {{cite web|url=http://www.freepascal.org/|title=Free Pascal - Advanced open source Pascal compiler for Pascal and Object Pascal - Home Page|access-date=2017-04-02|website=Free Pascal|archive-date=1999-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990125095436/http://www.freepascal.org/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   The language's primitives, or basics, are Pascal procedures which, in some cases, access the Free Pascal Run Time Library. < ref name= " Free Pascal run time " > {{cite web | title=Reference for package 'rtl' | website=Free Pascal | url=http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/current/rtl/index.html | access-date=2017-04-02 | archive-date=2016-12-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212064043/http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/current/rtl/index.html | url-status=dead }} Free Pascal Run Time Library < /ref > 
 
 These primitives provide the normal testing, arithmetic, move, and string handling capabilities as well as the following additions: 
 * Inter program [[synchronization]] and data passing. 
 * Bit [[manipulation]], or changing. 
 * DES [[encryption]] instructions. < ref name=des > {{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/qsys.us/www/des-listing|title=DES listing - www|access-date=2017-04-02|author=Symsyn Group|archive-date=2016-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118195819/https://sites.google.com/a/qsys.us/www/des-listing|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 * Re assignable instruction opcodes, or lower level codes to inhibit reverse engineering, or determination of source code from compiled code. 
 
 It is extensible, in that it can be extended.  [[Algorithm]]s can be added to the collection of primitives. Many programs can be written in SymSyn. < ref name=rc / >  Like most programming languages, SymSyn can say hello to the world. < ref name=hello > {{cite web|url=https://helloworldcollection.github.io/#Symsyn|title=Symsyn in the Hello World Collection|access-date=2017-04-02}} < /ref >
