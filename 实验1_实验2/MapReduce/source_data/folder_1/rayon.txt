'''Rayon'''  is a [[manufacture]]d reconstituted [[cellulose fiber]]. It is made from purified [[cellulose]]. This is mainly from [[dissolving pulp|wood pulp]], which is [[wikt:chemical|chemical]]ly changed into a [[Solubility|soluble]] compound.  It is then [[Solvation|dissolved]] and forced through a [[spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] to produce filaments. These are chemically solidified, resulting in man-made fibres of nearly pure cellulose. < ref name= " fibersource " > {{cite web |url=http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm|title=Rayon Fiber (Viscose)|work=afma.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406101953/http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm|archive-date=2008-04-06}} < /ref >  Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring [[polymer]]s, it is considered a [[semi-synthetic]] fiber. < ref > {{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ed070p887|bibcode=1993JChEd..70..887K |title=Rayon: the first semi-synthetic fiber product |url= https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-chemical-education_1993-11_70_11/page/887|year= 1993 |last1= Kauffman |first1= George B. |journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 70 |issue= 11 |pages= 887}} < /ref >
