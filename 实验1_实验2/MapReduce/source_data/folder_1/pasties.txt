 '''Pasties''' (sing. 'pastie') are small pieces of [[cloth]], [[plastic]] or [[metal]]. They are treated specially so they are sticky. They are used to cover a girl's [[nipple]]s or [[genital]] area. They vary in size and are usually not much larger than the person's [[areola]]. 
 
 The concept of 'pasties' is to show as much of the [[breast]] as possible without making the woman entirely [[topless]]. Many [[exotic]] [[dancer]]s in [[strip clubs]] are required to wear them by law. Pasties are usually applied with a special [[glue]] or tape.  This is the origin of their name, as they are quite literally 'pasted' onto the nipple. 
 
 Pasties are worn by many neo-burlesque performers. [[Burlesque]] pasties may also feature [[tassels]] which hang from the center, performer will sometimes twirl these as part of a performance. < ref > {{cite web| url=https://www.hbstrippers.net/locations/ |title= Dancers For Hire }} Friday, 4 December 2020  < /ref >   
 
 Some women who choose not to wear a [[brassi√®re|bra]] wear pasties to prevent their nipples from protruding visibly through their [[shirt]].  
 
 ==Pasties in law== 
 The [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''Erie v. Pap's A.M.'' that a city ordinance requiring erotic dancers to wear pasties, and a [[g-string]], was constitutional. < ref > [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE & court=US & vol=529 & page=277 CITY OF ERIE et al. v.
