 '''''Ctenochasma''''' (meaning  " comb jaw " ) is a [[genus]] of [[Upper Jurassic]]  [[pterosaur]] of the suborder [[Pterodactyloidea]]. Their fossilized remains have been found in the [[Solnhofen limestone]] of [[Bavaria]], < ref > von Meyer C.E.H. 1852. ''Ctenochasma Roemeri''. ''Paläontographica'', '''2''': 82–84  &  pl. 13. < /ref >  [[Germany]], and a couple of other sites laid down in the late [[Jurassic period]]. 
 
 The teeth were a filter-feeding apparatus: the pterosaurs strained out [[algae]] or small [[invertebrate]]s from stagnant tropical waters, as [[flamingo]]es do today. This kind of life is mirrored by another pterosaur genus, ''[[Pterodaustro]]'', which had an active pumping mechanism to push water through its teeth. < ref > Bennett S.C. 2007.
