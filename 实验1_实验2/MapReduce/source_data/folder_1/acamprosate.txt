 Acamprosate, marketed under the brand name Campral, is a medication used to help individuals with alcohol dependence maintain abstinence. Approved by regulatory authorities for this purpose, acamprosate is thought to act by stabilizing the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. 
 
 Developed in the late 1980s, acamprosate gained approval in several countries as an adjunct to psychosocial support in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Unlike some other medications for alcohol use disorder, acamprosate does not cause a [[disulfiram]]-like reaction with alcohol consumption. 
 
 The precise mechanism of acamprosate's action is not entirely understood, but it is believed to modulate the glutamatergic system, potentially reducing the hyperactivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Clinical trials have demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy, with acamprosate showing effectiveness in supporting abstinence and preventing relapse. 
 
 Acamprosate may have side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, and itching. Its use is generally contraindicated in individuals with severe renal impairment. 
 
 Research continues to explore the optimal use and potential benefits of acamprosate in the broader context of alcohol use disorder treatment. Despite its limitations, acamprosate remains a valuable option for healthcare professionals working to address alcohol dependence in their patients.
