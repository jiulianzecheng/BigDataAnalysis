 '''Nineveh''' was an ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] city on the eastern side of the [[Tigris]] River. It was the capital and a major city of the [[Assyrian empire]]. < ref > {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|19:36|}} < /ref >  Its ruins are across the river from the modern-day city of [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]. < ref > Menko Vlaardingerbroek 2004. The founding of Nineveh and [[Babylon]] in Greek historiography. Iraq, vol. 66, Nineveh. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assriologique Internationale, Part One, pp. 233-241. < /ref > 
 
 The ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700 & nbsp;BC. The wall was bout 12 & nbsp;km in length. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every {{convert|18|m|ft|0}}. The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step [[parapet]]s. 
 
 The city wall had fifteen monumental gateways. They were checkpoints for people entering and exiting the city. They probably had  [[barracks]] and [[armour]]ies. With the inner and outer doors shut, the gateways were fortresses. The gateways had passages and interior chambers lined with finely cut stone. A stairway led from one of the interior chambers to the top of the mudbrick wall. 
 
 The city wall was [[destruction|destroyed]] by [[ISIS]] by February, 2015. The wall was destroyed during an effort to destroy historical buildings and monuments in the province by the jihadist rebel group. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.736/isis-has-blown-up-the-historic-wall-of-nineveh.html | title=ISIS has blown up the historic wall of Nineveh | accessdate=March 2, 2015 | archive-date=January 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120114215/http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.736/isis-has-blown-up-the-historic-wall-of-nineveh.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
