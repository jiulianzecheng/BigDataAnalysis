'''Pelagianism''' is a theory named after [[Pelagius]]. It is the belief that people are not born with [[original sin]] and that mortal [[Will (philosophy)|will]] is still capable of choosing [[Good (philosophy)|good]] or [[evil]] without [[Miracle|Divine aid]]. For this reason, Adam's sin was there to set a bad example for those that came after him; other than that it had no consequences. [[Jesus]] was there to set a good example (much like Adam's bad example) but also to pay the price for our sins. Pelagius believed that because people ''choose'' to sin, they are like criminals who need to be pardoned, ''not'' victims of an inherited sinful nature. 
 
 Pelagianism was condemned as [[heresy]] at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD. However, some people believe that Pelagius was simply misunderstood. Today there are no known Pelagians, but there are people who follow [[Celtic Christianity]] tradition, which respects Pelagius as a good example of Celtic Christian.
