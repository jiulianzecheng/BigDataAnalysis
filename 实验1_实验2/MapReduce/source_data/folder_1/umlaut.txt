 [[File:Germanic_umlaut_on_keyboard.jpg|thumb|A German keyboard, showing the three umlauts]] 
 An '''umlaut''' is a [[diacritic]] or [[accent]] used in some languages, including [[German language|German]]. They are written ä, ö, ü (or ae, oe, ue).  
 
 Without the [[diaeresis]] (the dots) those three letters are said [a], [o], and [u]. In German, when the dots are put over them, [[Ä]], [[Ö]], and [[Ü]] change to sound like [ɛ], [œ]/[ø] and [y]/[ʏ]. 
 
 When a word that has umlaut letters with dots is changed into [[English language|English]], the letters are usually written as ae, oe, or ue instead of ä, ö, or ü.
