 '''Ayn''' ({{lang-so|Cayn}}, {{lang-ar|{{big|عين}}}} & nbsp;) also spelled as '''Cayn''', is a region in northern [[Somalia]] centered on the city of Buuhoodle. It was a province created by [[Puntland]] in 2009. It was one of the 7 regions of [[Puntland]]. Then in 2012 it was reclaimed by [[Khatumo State]], an attempted federal state for [[reer darawiish]]. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Goitom |first1=Hanibal |title=Somalia: Puntland State Approves New Constitution {{!}} Global Legal Monitor |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/somalia-puntland-state-approves-new-constitution/ |website=www.loc.gov |date=6 July 2009}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.statoids.com/yso.html | title=Somalia Districts }} < /ref > < ref > https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/120222_OCHASom_Administrative_Map_Togdheer_Buuhoodle_A3.pdf < /ref >  As of the 2020s, Ayn is an independent administration ruled by [[reer darawiish]] locals and SSC militias. < ref > Jama, Osman M., et al.
