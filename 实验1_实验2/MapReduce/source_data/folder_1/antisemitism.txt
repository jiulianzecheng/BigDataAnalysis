 '''Antisemitism''' is the [[wikt:hatred|hatred]] of or [[prejudice]] against [[Jew]]s. Antisemitism has a long history, but the most well-known act of anti-semitism is the [[Holocaust]] perpetrated by [[Germany]], also known as the Final Solution, a [[genocide]] which happened between 1933 and 1945. The plan was to totally get rid of the Jewish people in Europe, and up to 60-75% of them were killed. Around six million European Jews were killed because of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]. He said that Jews were a [[Race (sociology)|racial group]] with naturally bad features.  
 
 Antisemitism is still common today. In a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center, all of the [[Muslim]]-majority Middle Eastern countries polled had very bad opinions of Jews. Only 2% of Egyptians, 3% of Lebanese Muslims, and 2% of Jordanians reported having a good view of Jews. < ref > {{cite web|date=21 July 2011|title=Muslim-Western Tensions Persist - Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/07/21/muslim-western-tensions-persist|location=Washington, DC}} < /ref >  In a 2013 survey of 5,847 Jewish people in [[Europe]], 76% thought that antisemitism has increased in the past five years and 29% had thought about moving countries because they felt unsafe. < ref > http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-discrimination-hate-crime-against-jews-eu-member-states_en.pdf < /ref >  A related word is Judeophobia, which is when people hate Jews for no reason. < ref > The raft of Mohammed, Jean-Pierre Péroncel-Hugoz - 1988, p. 50 < /ref >  In the [[United States]], a 2017 survey showed that 14% of Americans had antisemitic feelings. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/in-first-new-adl-poll-finds-majority-of-americans-concerned-about-violence|title=In First, New ADL Poll Finds Majority of Americans Concerned About Violence Against Jews and Other Minorities, Want Administration to Act|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Anti-Semitism in the Bible== 
 The [[New Testament]] has anti-Semitic contents. 
 
 {{quote|For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to everyone in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way, they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last. 
 
 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16}}
