 Usually, the banya (wooden house) is near a river.  The bathers jump into the river to cool down after being in the banya. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In 440 b.c.e., the [[Ancient Greek]] history writer [[Herodotus]] wrote about people who live in what is Russia today. < ref name=BBCT / > 
 
 One early mention of the banya is in the ''[[Königsberg Letopis]]'''.''''' < ref name= " :1 " > Aaland, Mikkel (1998).  " [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608113726/http://cyberbohemia.com/Pages/russianbaniahistory.htm The Russian Bania. History of the Great Russian Bath] " . ''Cyber-Bohemia''. < /ref >  The first full description of a banya is in the East Slavic ''[[Primary Chronicles]]'' of 1113. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 At some times in history, women would go to the banya to [[childbirth|give birth to babies]].   After a funeral, the friends and family of a dead person sometimes go to a banya together. < ref name=BBCT / > 
 
 Throughout Russian history, the banya has been used by people in all [[social class|classes]]. < ref name= " :0 " > Suemedha Sood (November 29, 2012).  " [https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20121129-the-origins-of-bathhouse-culture-around-the-world The origins of bathhouse culture around the world] " . [[BBC]] Travel.  < /ref >  Poor workers would get clean in a banya after [[manual labor|work]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Rich Russians sometimes had private banya. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   Sometimes, the bather will jump into a river or a pile of snow instead. < ref name=BBCT / > 
 
 Today, banya have separate places for men and women.  Bathers do not have to be [[nudity|naked]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Common rules == 
 Banya have three rooms: a changing room or ''predbannik'' where people change clothes, a washing room, and steam room or ''parilka''.  < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|date=2019-02-21|title=An Easy Guide to Russian Banya Steam Bath|url=https://vegantrekker.com/2019/02/russian-banya-everything-you-must-know.html|access-date=2021-07-10|website=Vegan Trekker|language=en-US}} < /ref >   
 
 If the banya is for men and women, bathers should wear bathing suits.  If the banya has separate places for men and women, bathers are usually naked. < ref name=BBCT / > 
 
 ==Process==  
 
 Banya are often hotter than 93°C. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 Bathers sit on a small mat to protect their skin from the hot wood. Bathers usually wear [[felt]] hats while they sit in the banya. During the banya bath, bathers use a broom or besom.  Bathers hit each other with the branches like a [[massage]].  Sometimes friends hit each other with branches.  Sometimes a professional masseuse does.  The last part of the banya is when someone throws a bucket of cool or cold water on the bather. < ref name=BI > {{cite news|accessdate=July 11, 2021|publisher=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-bathhouse-moscow-banya-photos-2019-8|date=August 7, 2019|title=I visited a 200-year-old Russian bathhouse in Moscow, where I paid $85 to be whacked with branches and doused in ice-cold water. It was the most memorable part of my trip.|author=Katie Warren}} < /ref >   
 
 The biggest difference between a banya and [[sauna]] are that the banya has steam and most saunas use dry air. 
 
 ==Health== 
 
 Starting in the 1800s, doctors and scientists decided to study the banya.  They already had an idea that it was good for health.  Most of their studies were not good by today's scientific rules, but they told many people to go to the banya for their health. < ref name=BBCT / > 
 
 ==Folklore== 
 
 In [[Slavic]] [[mythology]] there is a spirit called a [[bannik]] that lives in the banya under the bench.  The bannik throws hot water or hot rocks at rude bathers. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
