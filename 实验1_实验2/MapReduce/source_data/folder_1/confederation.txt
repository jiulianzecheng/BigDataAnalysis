A '''confederation''' is a group of [[countries]] that, by [[treaty]], have given some of their powers to a central government. They do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas. This is like a [[federation]], but without the association being a new country.  
 
 A confederation is not the same as a federation, but they have a similarity. A confederation is a group of countries, a federation is a country. 
 
 The only example today is the [[European Union]]. [[Switzerland]] still has the official [[Latin]] name ''Confœderatio Helvetica'', since it was founded in 1291, as a confederation. It later became a federation but kept the word ''Confœderatio''.
