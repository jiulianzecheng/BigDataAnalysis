 A '''spork''' is a combination of a [[spoon]] and a [[fork]] to create a special tool used to [[eat]]. Most sporks are made from [[plastic]]. Many [[fast food]] chains use the spork, including [[Taco Bell]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Taco John's]], and [[Taco Bueno]].  Many people dislike the spork because it cannot poke food as well as a fork nor hold [[liquids]] as well as a spoon.
