 '''Mangosteen''' (''Garcinia mangostana''), also known as the '''purple mangosteen''', is a [[tropical]] [[fruit]] which comes from the [[rainforest]]s of [[South East Asia]]. It grows on [[evergreen tree]]s. It is one of the most popular tropical fruits. It is popular because it has such a sweet, juicy, [[acid]]ic taste. It has a hard purple shell. Inside the shell, there are white [[segment]]s, just like an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]. It has to be grown in temperatures of above 4 & nbsp;°C (40 & nbsp;°F). If it is grown in temperatures below that, the plants perish.
