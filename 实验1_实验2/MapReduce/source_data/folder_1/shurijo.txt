 '''Shurijo''' or '''Shuri Castle''' was the [[palace]] where the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyu]] kings lived before [[Okinawa]] became part of [[Japan]]. Since it was built when Okinawa was [[Independence|independent]], the [[castle]] structure is very different from other castles in Japan. Shuri Castle is located in [[Shuri]]. Shuri was once the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyu]] capital, but it is now part of the present-day city of [[Naha]]. 
 
 Throughout its history, it had been destroyed and rebuilt four times, including during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. This is why the [[courtyard]] is a little [[Symmetry|asymmetrical]], or lop-sided. It was a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. 
 
 On the morning of 31 October 2019, a large fire broke out at the main hall of the castle. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/10/31/national/shuri-castle-fire/|title=Shuri Castle, a symbol of Okinawa, destroyed in fire|date=2019-10-31|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763|archive-date=2019-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031050530/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/10/31/national/shuri-castle-fire/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/asia/shuri-castle-fire-intl/index.html|title=Fire breaks out in Japan's Shuri Castle|last=CNN|first=Tara John|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref >  ''Seiden'', ''Hokuden'', ''Nanden'' and ''Bandokoro'' were completely destroyed. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J00CH5G8fZM|title=焼け落ちる正殿　未明に首里城で火災　消火活動続く|author= < !--Not stated-- > |date=31 October 2019|website=ANNnewsCH|access-date=31 October 2019}} < /ref >  According to news sources,  " Six castle buildings occupying some 4,200 square meters in total were [destroyed].
