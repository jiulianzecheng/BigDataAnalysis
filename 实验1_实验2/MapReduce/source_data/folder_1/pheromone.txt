A '''pheromone''' is a [[scent]] given off by some animals. The scent causes a [[social]] response in members of the same [[species]]. 
 
 There are many types of pheromone, such as: 
 *[[Sex]] pheromones (to attract a partner): e.g. butterflies and moths 
 *[[Alarm]] pheromones (to warn the group): e.g. wasps 
 *Food trail pheromomes (to let others know what has been found): e.g. ants 
 *[[Territory|Territorial]] pheromones: e.g. cats and dogs 
 *Various 'short-term' pheromones cause a rapid but brief behaviour: e.g.  releasing a cluster of [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]], or positioning the body for sex. 
 
 All pheromones work by [[heredity|inherited]] [[instinct]], not by learning. They occur in most animals, but are especially obvious in [[insect]]s.
