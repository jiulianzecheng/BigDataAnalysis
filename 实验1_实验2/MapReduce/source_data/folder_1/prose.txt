 '''Prose''' is the ordinary form of the written (or spoken) [[language]]. < ref > ''Concise Oxford Dictionary''. < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780198715443.001.0001/acref-9780198715443-e-928?rskey=B3tvrP & result=5|title=Prose|last=Baldick|first=Chris|date=2015|website=Oxford Reference - The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (4 ed.)|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-871544-3|access-date=January 7, 2023}} < /ref >  It is not [[poetry]]. On the written page it looks like a group of [[Paragraph|paragraphs]]. It does not need any special format such as [[list]]s or [[Table (information)|tables]]. In writing, it is without special [[rhythm]]. It is similar to everyday [[communication]]. That is what makes it different from poetry and from [[theatre|theatrical]] works such as [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. 
 
 The word prose comes from the [[Latin]] ''prosa'', meaning straightforward; so we have the term  " prosaic " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=prose {{!}} Search Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=prose|access-date=2023-01-07|website=www.etymonline.com}} < /ref >  Prose writing is usually used to describe facts or to discuss whatever one's thoughts are in free flowing speech. It may be used for [[newspaper]]s, [[novel]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[broadcast]] media, [[letter]]s, [[story|stories]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[biography]], and many other kinds of writing. 
 
 Prose generally has no formal structure, like [[meter (poetry)|meter]] or [[rhyme]], that is often found in [[poetry]]. Therefore, it is used to describe literature which is non-poetic, and non-theatrical. There is, however, a blend of the two forms of literature known as ''[[Prose poem|prose poetry]]''.
