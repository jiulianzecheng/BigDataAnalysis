 A '''gymnasium''' (often called a '''gym''') is a place used for physical activity. The word ''γυμνάσιον'' (gymnasion) was used in [[Ancient Greece]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1859/05/the-gymnasium/305407/|title=The Gymnasium|first=David William|last=Cheever|date=1 May 1859|website=The Atlantic}} < /ref >  It meant a place for both physical and intellectual [[education]] of young men (see [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)]]).  
 
 The intellectual education meaning persisted in [[German language|German]] and other languages to mean a certain type of school providing [[secondary education]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], whereas in [[English language|English]] the meaning of physical education was pertained in the word '''gym'''. However, the word  " gymnasium "  is not used very often in English nowadays. The term favoured in English is   " sports centre " , which perhaps seems more natural. 
 
 Some gyms offer memberships where people can train to improve their physical appearance and health. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.hiittraining.net/hiit-workout/|title=hiittraining.net|website=www.hiittraining.net|access-date=2015-01-28|archive-date=2015-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127024133/http://www.hiittraining.net/hiit-workout/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Commercial gyms offer sometimes help from qualified trainer. Again, another term is more used today:  " fitness centre " . 
 
 Sports such as basketball and volleyball are often played in gymnasia. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/404642-gym-class-games-that-are-fun/|title=Gym Class Games That Are Fun|website=LIVESTRONG.COM}} < /ref >
