 A '''condominium''' (or '''condo''') is a building complex containing a number of [[Real property|individually owned]] [[apartment]]s with [[wikt:share|shared]] [[Facility|facilities]]. In the United States and in Canada a condominium is a collection of apartment units, [[townhouse]]s, garden homes or single homes that share common property together. In [[British Columbia]] condominiums are referred to as stratas. By owning a unit in a condominium, a person has access to the common facilities. The shared use of these facilities is legally guaranteed as part of the property; they share ownership of these areas. Such facilities may include hallways, a heating system, [[elevator]]s, [[garden]]s, and [[Recreation|recreational]] facilities.
