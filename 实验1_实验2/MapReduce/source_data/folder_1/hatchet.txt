 A '''Hatchet''' is a special [[axe]] that can be used with one hand. It can be used as a [[tool]], for example to cut [[wood]], or as a [[weapon]]. Hatchets have been in use since the [[Mesolithic]]. The use of hatchets is typical for the [[Neolithic]].Hatchets are often carried by hikers because they can be used to chop woob or kindling for  a fire. In shape a hatchet looks like a tohmahawk but they are often a bit smaller and have thicker blades.
