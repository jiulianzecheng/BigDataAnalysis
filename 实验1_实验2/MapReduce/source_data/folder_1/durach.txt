 '''Durach''' is a [[municipality]] in the district of [[Oberallgäu]] in [[Bavaria]] in [[Germany]]. 
 
 The village came into international media attention in August 2008. A light aircraft hit [[power lines]] nearby. The pilot and passenger survived inside the plane dangling on power cables. They were rescued in front of cameras. < ref > {{cite news|title=Plane hits power lines|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-08-18|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/7568045.stm|access-date=2008-08-18}} < /ref >
