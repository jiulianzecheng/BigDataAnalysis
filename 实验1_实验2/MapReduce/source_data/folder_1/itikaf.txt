'''Itikaf''' or '''Etikaf''' or '''E'tikaf''' is a practice in the [[Islamic faith]]. It consists of a period of retreat in a [[mosque]], for a certain number of days in accordance with the believer's own wish.That number of days is 10 days. Ramadan is a perfect opportunity to do this. During Itikaf the people spend the last set of [[Ramadan]] in the mosque worshipping Allah. They spend their nights in worship by reciting verses from the [[Qur'an]] and praying ''thahajjud''. During Itikaf, the believers  stay at the mosque. E'tikaf is performed during the last set of Ramadan because  " laylatul qadr "  (the night when the Quran was revealed) is most probably expected in it.The Muslims also worship ALLAH more and reflect about what they have done in the past.
