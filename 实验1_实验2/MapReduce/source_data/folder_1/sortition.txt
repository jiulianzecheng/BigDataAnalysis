'''Allotment''', also known as '''sortition''', is a method of [[:wikt:selection|selection]] by some form of [[lottery]]. It is used to have an equal chance to be selected for those that are involved. For instance it is done by drawing coloured pebbles from a bag. In the democracy of [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]] sortition was the main method for appointing officials. People thought it this method was one of the principal characteristics of democracy.  
 
 [[Aristotle]] saw [[Social equality|equality]] and democracy in a close context: 
 
 < blockquote > " Democracy arose from the idea that those who are equal in any respect are equal absolutely. All are alike free, therefore they claim that all are free absolutely... The next is when the democrats, on the grounds that they are all equal, claim equal participation in everything. " < ref > Aristotle Politics 1301a28-35 < /ref > < /blockquote >
