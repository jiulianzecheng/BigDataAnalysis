 '''Petroleum''', (from Greek πέτρα - rock and έλαιο - oil) also called '''crude oil''', is a thick and [[black]] [[liquid]]. It is a natural material mainly made of [[hydrocarbon]]s. The hydrocarbons came from many billions of ancient [[phytoplankton]]. When they died, their bodies sank to the bottom. This formed basins of oil in many parts of the world. 
 
 Most petroleum is found by drilling down through rocks on land or off-[[shore]] on the [[continental shelf]]. Major producers are in the [[Middle East]], the [[Americas]], and [[Russia]]. It is the most important world [[fuel]] source. It supplies 38% of the world's energy and is also used to make [[petrochemical]]s. 
 
 Crude oil is a mixture of many different [[Organic chemistry|chemicals]] (mostly [[hydrocarbon]]s), most of which burn well. It is separated into simpler, more useful mixtures by [[fractional distillation]] in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] to give separate chemicals such as [[gasoline]] (or ''petrol'') for cars, [[kerosene]] for airplanes and [[tar|bitumen]] for roads. The bitumen gives crude oil its dark black color; most of the other chemicals in crude are slightly yellow or colorless.  
 
 Petroleum can be easily [[transport]]ed by [[pipeline]] and [[oil tanker]]. Refined petroleum is used as [[fuel]]s; mainly [[gasoline]] (''petrol'') for cars, diesel fuel for [[diesel engine]]s used in trucks, trains and ships, [[kerosene]] fuel for jets and as [[lubricant]]s. 
 
 Petrochemicals: 
 * [[alcohol]]s 
 * [[antiseptic]]s 
 * [[artificial rubber]] 
 * [[detergent]]s 
 * [[drug]]s 
 * [[explosive]]s 
 * [[food additive]]s 
 * [[insecticide]]s 
 * [[perfume]]s 
 * [[plastic]]s 
 * [[textile]] fiber 
 
 == Problems == 
 Petroleum resource is limited and [[non-renewable]]. Some believe it will run out within 70 years after a [[peak oil]] early in the 21st century. 
 Burning petroleum or other [[fossil fuel]] adds the [[carbon]] in the oil to the [[oxygen]] in the air to create [[carbon dioxide]], which is an [[Air pollution|air pollutant]].  The carbon can be removed from the carbon dioxide by [[plants]]. 
 
 There is a lot of crude oil left underground. [[Oil company|Oil companies]] quote  " reserves "  which some people confuse with the actual amount of oil underground, but are more to do with the cost of extracting it by [[oil well]]s.  
 
 Most of the crude left underground is in the [[Middle East]] which is not a politically stable part of the world. Some governments with lots of oil reserves work together through [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries|OPEC]] to keep production low and prices high. People in countries that use oil complain about high oil prices. However, some environmentalists worry about damage being done by using oil as a fuel source (especially [[global warming]]) and are therefore happy when prices are kept high so that people use less oil. 
 
 == Viable alternatives == 
 There are none as far as we know. The small amounts of uncertain output from all wind and solar energy will not get near what is needed. The person who has proved this is [[Simon Michaux]], an Australian expert. He has shown that the sum total of alternative energy sources comes nowhere near replacing oil. < ref > Michaux, Simon 2023 ''The Climate Crisis and The Climate Crash''. You Tube.
