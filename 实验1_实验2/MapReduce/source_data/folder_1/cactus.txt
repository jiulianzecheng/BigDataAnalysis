 A '''cactus''' is a kind of [[plant|a plant]] adapted to hot, dry climates < ref > The plural of cactus is cacti or cactuses or simply 'cactus'. < /ref >  Plants which live this kind of life-style are called [[xerophyte]]s. Most are [[Succulent plant|succulents]], which store water. 
 
 Cacti are members of the plant [[Family (biology)|family]] Cactaceae, in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Caryophyllales]]. There are about 127 genera, with over 1750 known species. ''Almost all of them are native to the Americas'', from [[Patagonia]] in the south to parts of western [[Canada]] in the north. The species ''Rhipsalis baccifera'' also grows in [[Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. < ref name= " Ed " > Anderson, Edward F. 2001. '' The cactus family''. Pentland, Oregon: Timber Press. {{ISBN|978-0-88192-498-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Many cacti live in dry places, such as deserts. Most cacti have sharp thorns (stickers) and thick skin. There are many shapes and sizes of cacti. Some are short and round; others are tall and thin. Many cactus flowers are big and beautiful. Some bloom at night and are pollinated by moths and bats. Some cactus fruits are brightly coloured and good to eat: many animals eat cactus fruits. 
 
 [[Theophrastus]] was the first to use the word ''cactus'': It comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang-grc|κάκτος|kaktos|label=none}}. Theophrastus used it for a spiny plant whose identity is not known for sure. < ref name=JohnSmit72 > {{Citation |last1=Johnson |first1=A.T. |last2=Smith |first2=H.A. |year=1972 |title=Plant names simplified : their pronunciation, derivation  &  meaning |publication-place=Buckenhill, Herefordshire |publisher=Landsmans Bookshop |isbn=978-0-900513-04-6 |name-list-style=amp }}, p. 19 < /ref >  Cacti are part of an important food chain in dry, hot climates. Now cacti have spread to many other parts of the world, and many people like to grow them in pots or gardens. 
 
 == Adaptations == 
 An [[adaptation]] is anything that helps a living thing survive and make more of its own kind. Cacti have many adaptations for living in places that are sometimes dry for a long time. At other times these places can get lots of rain. 
 
 Cacti can have many small, thin roots near the top of the soil. These roots take in water quickly after a rain. The same cactus may have one long, thick root called a taproot. The taproot grows deep in the soil. It can reach water when the soil on top is dry. 
 
 Cacti store water in thick stems. The stems are covered with tough skin, and the skin is covered with wax. The thick waxy skin slows down loss of water. The leaves of cacti are sharp spines (thorns, stickers). Many animals want the water inside the cactus, but  the sharp spines and thick skin protect the cactus. 
 
 == Uses  of cacti == 
 Cacti are commonly grown as [[houseplants]]. They are pretty and easy to grow. Some cacti are grown in gardens, especially in dry areas. Cactus can be used as a living fence. The wood of dead cactus is sometimes used for houses 
 
 People eat the fruit of some kinds of cactus, such as [[dragonfruit]] and [[prickly pear]]. ''Dactylopius coccus'' is a [[scale insect]] from which [[cochineal]] [[dye]] is got. This insect lives on cacti from the genus ''Opuntia'', feeding on moisture and nutrients in the cactus sap. The insect produces carminic acid, which [[defence against predators|deters predation]] by other insects. The carminic acid can be extracted from the insect's body and eggs to make the red dye. 
 
 == Cactus in history == 
 The ancient [[Aztecs]] of [[North America]] held cactus to be very important. Cactus can be found in many of their [[sculpture]]s and drawings. The national [[coat of arms]] of [[Mexico]] shows an [[eagle]], a [[snake]], and cactus. 
 
 [[Christopher Columbus]] brought the first cactus to Europe. [[Scientists]] and gardeners became very interested in cactus. 
 
 [[Prickly pear]] was taken to [[Australia]] in the 19th century for use as a natural fence and for use in the [[cochineal]] industry. The cactus spread out of control, but was controlled by the larva of a South American [[moth]]. 
 
 From the start of the 20th century interest in cactus has grown. Every year, scientists discover new kinds of cactus. A bad effect of this has been the digging up of many cacti from the wild, making some kinds [[endangered]]. 
 
 == Cactus stems == 
 A cactus does not have leaves because it lives in dry places. Leaves [[transpiration|transpire]], and this can waste [[water]]. So, the cactus saves water by having no leaves. The green parts of the cactus are actually its stems. Because the stems are green, they do the [[photosynthesis]] for the cactus. They also grow prickly needles to protect the cactus from animals that want to eat it.

 == Genera == 
 The family contains more than 100 [[genus|genera]]. < ref name=Miles > Anderson, Miles 1999.''Cacti and succulents: illustrated encyclopedia''. Oxford: Sebastian Kelly. {{ISBN|978-1-84081-253-4}} < /ref >  Some of them are: 
 * ''[[Gymnocalycium]]'' 
 * ''[[Myrtillocactus]]'' 
 * ''[[Schlumbergera]]''
