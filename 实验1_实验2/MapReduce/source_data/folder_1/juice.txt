 '''Juice''' is a [[liquid]] that comes from [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s or [[fruit]]. The juice from fruit is often made into a drink. Some fruits that are often made into drinks are [[apple]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tomato]], [[pineapple]], [[grapefruit]], [[guava]], [[mango]], [[passionfruit]], [[watermelon]], [[cranberry]], [[grape]], [[lemon]] and [[lime]], but there are many others.  
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] the name of a [[fruit]] or fruits followed by ''juice'' can only [[law|legally]] be used to describe something which is 100% fruit juice. < ref name=fruitjuice/ >  This is because of the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations and the Fruit Juices  &  Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003. < ref name=fruitjuice > {{Cite web |title=Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fruijuicedraftreg.pdf |access-date=2010-04-27 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402154827/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fruijuicedraftreg.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |title=Fruit Juices  &  Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003 |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/draftssifruitjuice.pdf |access-date=2010-04-27 |archive-date=2012-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402154838/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/draftssifruitjuice.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Juice can be bought from a [[Shop|store]], already in [[bottle]]s. Companies sell fruit juice just like any other drink. Juices are made by squeezing the juice out of the fruit. 
 
 If something has a lot of juice in it, it is said to be '''juicy'''. Juice does not have to be a [[drink]]. It can just be a liquid contained in something. 
 
 Some Juices could be healthy. [[Orange juice]] has [[vitamin C]], [[folic acid]], and [[potassium]] which may help prevent various diseases. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Vitamin C {{!}} The Nutrition Source {{!}} Harvard T.H.
