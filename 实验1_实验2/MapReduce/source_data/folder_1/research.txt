 '''Research''' is a way of looking for new [[wikt:information|information]], new [[wikt:understanding|understanding]], and new [[fact]]s. A person who does research is called a '''researcher'''. Some researchers work in [[academia]]. Other researchers work for [[business]]es, for [[organisation]]s, or for the [[government]]. Research is often used for solving [[problem]]s or increasing available [[knowledge]]. This can be done by testing [[Theory|theories]] and making [[observation]]s. Research usually prefers to be systematic, organised, and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]]. < ref name=Bunge > Bung, Mario 1967. ''Scientific research''. vol 1: The search for system; vol 2: The search for truth. Berlin:Springer. < /ref >  Research is used in many different [[Discipline (study)|fields of study]] such as [[science]], [[mathematics]], and the [[humanities]].

 == Academic research ==

 == Scientific research ==

 The [[scientific method]] is the usual way of doing this kind of research. It is meant to improve understanding of [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and many other fields. With this kind of research, [[scientist]]s can understand the world, and discover useful things. 
 
 Money for research comes from [[government]]s, private [[corporation]]s, and [[Charitable organization|charities]]. Some of these organizations combine [[research and development]] of new products and ways of doing their work. 
 
 == Some basic principles of research == 
 Any research should be: 
 * ''Systematic'': from a [[hypothesis]] or working objective, researchers gather data according to a scheme set out in advance.  They use the data to change ideas or add new knowledge to that already existing.  The approach used in research is the [[scientific method]]. 
 * ''Organized'': members of a research group use the same definitions, standards and principles.  This is part of the detailed plan.  
 * ''Objective'': conclusions from research must be based on observed and measured [[fact]]s, not on [[objectivity (philosophy)|subjective]] impressions.  The conclusions should be un[[bias]]ed. 
 
 == Basic activities at research process == 
 * Studying available [[information]] on the subject. [facts] 
 * Physical or computer modeling. 
 * Measuring the [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. 
 * Comparing the obtained results. 
 * Interpreting the results with the current knowledge, considering the variables which might have influenced the result. 
 
 == Types of research == 
 * ''Basic research'', also called fundamental research or pure research, aims to understand nature.  
 * ''Applied research'' aims at using the new knowledge to do something. 
 
 == Publishing == 
 Research must be published so the world can learn from it. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]'', are general scientific journals. Many special journals are published. Research must pass the [[peer review]] process in order to be published.
