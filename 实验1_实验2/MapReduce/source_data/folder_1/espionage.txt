 '''Espionage''' or '''spying''' is a practice of getting [[information]] about an [[organization]], society, or [[country]] that is meant to be [[secret]] or [[confidentiality|confidential]], without [[permission]]. Espionage usually involves having access to where the needed information is [[information storage|stored]] or to the people that know the information. In wartime, espionage is a [[war crime]]. The person who does it is called a  " spy "  or more vaguely an  " agent " . A ''double agent'' is one who trades information to both sides, and is (without their knowledge) being employed by both sides.
