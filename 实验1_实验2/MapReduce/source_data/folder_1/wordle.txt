 '''''Wordle''''' is a [[word game]] developed by [[Josh Wardle]]. Players have six guesses to find a five-letter word. After each guess the computer shows the player a colour-coded version of their word, thus helping them reach the right answer.  
 
 This shows the player if each letter in the word is: 
 
 * in the word and in the right place      (shown as green) 
 * in the word and in the wrong place   (shown as yellow) 
 * not in the word                                  (shown as grey) 
 
 There is only one word to guess per day.
