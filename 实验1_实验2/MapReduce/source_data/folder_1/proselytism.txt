 '''Proselytism''' is the practice of attempting to convert people to another opinion and, particularly, another religion.   
 
 The word ''proselytism'' comes from the [[Greek language]] prefix 'pros' (towards) and the verb 'erchomai' (I come). Historically in the [[New Testament]], the word [[proselyte]] meant a person who had converted to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]].  Though the word proselytism was originally used in Christianity, it is also used to refer to other religions' attempts to [[religious conversion|convert]] people to their beliefs or even any attempt to convert people to another point of view, religious or not.  Today, the [[connotation]]s of the word proselytism are often negative.
