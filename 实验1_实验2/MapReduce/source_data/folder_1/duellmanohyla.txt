 ==Description== 
 ''Duellmanohyla'' are small frogs.  Their eyes are bright red, bronze, or yellow. Their [[Dorsum (anatomy)|stomachs]] are pale green, olive, red-brown, or patterned like [[lichenose|lichen]]: green spots on black. Some of these frogs have stripes on their mouths and the sides of the bodies. Some of them have [[webbed feet]] and some do not.

 ==Ecology== 
 ''Duellmanohyla'' lay eggs in mountain streams where the water moves fast. Because they swim, they have some webbing on their front feet and on some of the toes of their back feet. Scientists have not seen any of the frogs lay eggs, but they think the female frogs lay eggs on the plants above the water.  Then the [[tadpole]]s fall into the stream. The tadpoles have dangling oral discs that they use to hold on to the [[Substrate (biology)|bottom of the stream]]. < ref name=Savage > {{cite book|author=Savage, Jay M.|title=The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica: A Herpetofauna Between Two Continents, Between Two Seas|url=https://archive.org/details/amphibiansreptil0000sava |url-access=registration|year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73537-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/amphibiansreptil0000sava/page/297 297]}} < /ref >
