 ==History== 
 [[File:(Albi) Bell tower of the Ste Cécile Cathedral - West exposure.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of the cathedral's bell tower]] 
 The first human [[settlement]] in Albi was in the [[Bronze Age]] (3000-600 [[Anno Domini|BC]]). After the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of [[Gaul]] in 51 BC, the town became ''Civitas Albigensium'', the city of the Albigeois. 
 
 The [[Catharism|Cathars]] had their main centre at Albi and so they were known also as ''Albigens'' after the city. The Cathar movement was a branch of Christianity which was persecuted in the [[Middle Ages]]. Because of this, the city was almost completely destroyed in a [[crusade]] between 1209 and 1229. Since 1678, the city is the seat of an [[archbishop]]. Since 1790, it is the [[capital city]] of the Tarn department. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Albi is in southern France, in the centre of the Tarn department. The [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] flows through the city and splits it in two; the [[History|historical]] city is on the left side of the river. Several small rivers, [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the Tarn, flows also through the city. 
 
 It has an area of {{Convert|44.26|km2|sqmi|abbr=on }} and its average [[altitude]] is {{Convert|169|m|ft|abbr=on}}; at the [[City and town halls|city hall]], the altitude is {{Convert|174|m|ft|abbr=on }}. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.map-france.com/Albi-81990/|title=Albi |publisher=Map-France.com |access-date=27 May 2014 }} < /ref >
