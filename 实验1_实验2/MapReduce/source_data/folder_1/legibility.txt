 '''Legibility''' is the degree to which [[writing]] can be seen and read. < ref > Tinker M.A. 1963. ''Legibility of print''. Iowa State University Press. {{ISBN|0-8138-2450-8}} < /ref >  Each [[glyph]] (individual character) in [[Written language|text]] has a shape we recognize in reading. The complete set of letters and symbols in a design is called a [[font]] (or fount). The choice of font is therefore the first thing which affects legibility. 
 
 A second factor in legibility is the setting, the way the type is used in practice.  This includes line length, line spacing ( " leading " ), justification, typestyle, [[kerning]], tracking, point size, etc. < ref > Williamson, Hugh 1956.
