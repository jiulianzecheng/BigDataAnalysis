The '''hyoid''' is a [[horseshoe]]-shaped bone in the front of the [[neck]]. between the [[chin]] and the thyroid cartilage ([[Adam's apple]]). At rest, it lies at the level of the [[mandible]] in the front and the third [[cervical vertebra]] behind. 
 Unlike other bones, the hyoid is not directly connected to other bones. It is connected only to  muscles and [[ligament]]s. The hyoid aids in [[tongue]] movement and swallowing. The hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the [[larynx]] below, and the [[epiglottis]] and [[pharynx]] behind. 
 
 ==Fracture and applied anatomy == 
 Due to its position, the hyoid bone does not fracture easily. In a suspected case of [[murder]], a fractured hyoid strongly indicates [[throttling]] or  [[wikt:strangle|strangulation]]  However, this is not the case in children and adolescents, because their hyoid bone is still flexible as ossification is yet to be completed.
