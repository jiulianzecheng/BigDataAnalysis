 In woodworking, the type of [[wood]] you get is very important. There are many kinds of [[softwood]] and many kinds of [[hardwood]]. The words hard and soft wood comes from the type of tree it came from. A hard pice of wood could be softwood. 
 
 There are a lot of [[tool]]s that people use during woodworking, such as [[sandpaper]] (used to make wood smooth to touch), [[file]]s, [[rasp]]s (all used for trimming wood, cutting, etc.), [[saw]]s (cutting wood), and automatic saws (saws that use [[electricity]] to run).
