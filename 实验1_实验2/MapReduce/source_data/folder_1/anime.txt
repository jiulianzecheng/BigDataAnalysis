 '''Anime''' (アニメ) is [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for '[[animation]]'. In [[Japan]], anime is the word used for all animation. Outside of Japan, the term anime refers to Japanese animation, which this article is about. 
 
 Some anime is drawn by hand, but anime can also be made with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[computer animation]]. There are many types of anime; you can find anime about sports, magic, or romance. These are just some examples. Anime are shown on [[television]], on [[DVD]], [[VHS]], and the [[Internet]], and are used in [[video game]]s. Also, some anime cartoons are just [[movies]], but they have cartoon characters and [[animation]] instead of real people and places. Anime is often based on Japanese comics that are called [[manga]] and graphic [[novel]]s. Sometimes live action (not animation) movies and television series are based on anime. 
 
 Over the years, anime has evolved both in terms of artistic techniques and storytelling. From traditional hand-drawn animation to the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), anime has embraced technological advancements to enhance its visual appeal. This evolution has broadened the scope of storytelling and allowed for more immersive and visually stunning experiences. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Shukla|first=Bharat|title=2.

 The history of anime begins around 1900, when [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[movie director|filmmakers]] tried out ways of [[animation]] at the same time as the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]] and [[France]].{{fact|date=April 2018}} 
 
 The filmmakers in Japan did not have a lot of money to make their movies and not a lot of places where they could film their movies. The people that the filmmakers could use as actors in their movies was also a problem for making Japanese movies. Japanese people look different from people in other places in the [[world]] (e.g. if the movie's theme were about [[Vikings]], [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]]), and it was hard for filmmakers to make a movie about places other than Japan with Japanese actors. Movie makers liked animation because then they could have [[animator]] draw other places and people that could not be filmed in a normal movie, and the animators could be very creative with the cartoons they made. 
 
 During the 1970s, more and more people started to like manga. At the same time, manga were used as the starting point to make anime with the same characters and stories. Animators would take the drawings done by a manga artist and the stories the manga artist wrote, and turn them into the stories and characters of a similar anime. At that time [[Osamu Tezuka]] became very popular. Now he is called a  " legend "  and the  " god of manga " . Tezuka and other [[pioneer]]s of anime made a lot of types of stories and styles that are common to anime today. The giant [[robot]] genre (known as  " [[mecha]] "  outside Japan) began with manga and anime from Tezuka's ideas. Robot anime like [[Gundam]] and [[Macross]] became [[wikt:classic|classic]]s in the 1980s. Today, the robot genre is still very popular in Japan and worldwide. In the 1980s, anime became very popular in Japan, and saw an increase in production. (Manga is much more popular than anime in Japan.) There are a lot of different kinds of anime that many different kinds of people like besides Mecha, and there are types of anime based on the age of the people (e.g. ''[[seinen]]'' or ''[[shōnen]]'') who might like it or the subject of the anime. < ref > {{Cite web|last=animenonton.id|title=Animenonton Anime|url=https://animenonton.id/|access-date=|website=Animenonton Anime|language=id}} < /ref > 
 
 Very popular stories in anime and manga are often [[translate]]d into other languages, and the words used in the anime or manga will be put into another language where they mean the same thing. That way, people who live outside of Japan and who do not understand Japanese (the language used for [[dialogue]] in anime and manga in Japan) can also understand the stories. If a manga or anime is not translated by a company in another country, sometimes people in that country will translate the story to share with other people for free before a company translates it for the general [[:wikt:public|public]]. This is good because it allows more people to watch anime, but some companies think it is stealing.
