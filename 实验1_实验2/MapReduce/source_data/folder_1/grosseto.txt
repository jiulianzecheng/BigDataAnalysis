 Grosseto was one of the main [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cities. The city was under the control of the [[Aldobrandeschi]] family. In 1137, the city was captured by [[Germany|German]] [[military|soldiers]] under the control of [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry X]] of [[Bavaria]]. In 1151, the people of Grosseto agreed to be under the control of [[Siena]]. In 1222, the city returned to the Aldobrandeschi. When Siena captured the lands of the Aldobrandeschi in 1244, Grosseto was under their control again. The city tried to free itself in 1266 and 1355 but failed. 
 
 Sienese control of the Grosseto lasted until 1559 when [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] gave control of the city to the [[Medici]]. It then became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]].
