 The '''Engadin''' or '''Engadine''' ({{lang-rm|{{Audio|Roh-putèr-Engiadina.ogg|Engiadina}}}}, {{lang-de|Engadin}}, {{lang-it|Engadina}}, {{lang-fr|Engadine}}; lit.: ''Valley of the Inn people'') is a long high [[Alps|Alpine]] valley in the eastern [[Swiss Alps]]. It is found in the canton of [[Graubünden]]. It is about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the [[Inn (river)|Inn]] ({{lang-rm|En}}) from its headwaters at [[Maloja Pass]] in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into [[Austria]], one hundred kilometers downstream. < ref name=Engadine > {{HDS|8067|Engadin|author=Ottavio Clavuot|date=2014-09-04|rm=251}} < /ref >  The Inn subsequently flows at [[Passau]] into the [[Danube]], as the only Swiss river to drain into the [[Black Sea]]. 
 
 The Engadine is connected by the [[Julier Pass|Julier]], [[Albula Pass|Albula]], [[Flüela Pass]]es and the [[Vereina Tunnel]] to the northern part of Switzerland and the rest of the canton of Graubünden. 
 
 The highest mountains of the wider area of the Engadine is the [[Bernina Range]] in the southwestern part.
