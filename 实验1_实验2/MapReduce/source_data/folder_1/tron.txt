The movie [[cast member|stars]] [[Jeff Bridges]] as Kevin Flynn (and Clu), [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Alan Bradley (and Tron) and [[Cindy Morgan]] as Lora (and Yori). [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] plays the [[villain]], Dillinger (and Sark, as well as the voice of the  " Master Control Program " ). It was [[movie director|directed]] by [[Steven Lisberger]]. One of the first movies to use [[computer animation]]s extensively, ''Tron'' has a distinctive visual style. 
 
 The [[music]] for the movie was written by [[Wendy Carlos]], and there were also two songs from the [[band]] [[Journey]]. 
 
 Even though it got mixed success soon after its [[debut]], ''Tron'' has gained a [[cult]] following thanks to its [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and hero story. Several [[video game]]s have been based on it. 
 
 A twentieth [[anniversary]] [[DVD]] edition came out in 2002. In early 2005, Disney revealed plans for a sequel. The sequel was called ''[[Tron Legacy]]'' and was released in 2010. It tells the story of Flynn's son Sam.
