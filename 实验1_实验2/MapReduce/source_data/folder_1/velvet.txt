 '''Velvet''' is a type of woven tufted [[textile|fabric]] in which the cut [[yarn|thread]]s are very evenly distributed, with a short dense [[nap (textile)|pile]], giving it a distinctly smooth feel. 
 
 Velvet can be made from many different fibres. It is woven on a special [[loom]] that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile, but modern [[dry cleaning]] methods perform well. 
 
 Velvet is made, ideally, from [[silk]]. More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly [[polyester]], [[nylon]], [[viscose]], [[acetate]], and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (e.g. viscose and silk). A small percentage of [[lycra]] is used sometimes to give stretch. 
 
 == History == 
 The art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval [[Kashmir]] around the beginning of the fourteenth century. King [[Richard II of England]] directed in his will that his body should be clothed ''in velveto'' in 1399. < ref > L W Cowrie ''Dictionary of British Social History''  Wordsworth Reference.  p304  {{ISBN|1-85326-378-8}} < /ref > 
 
 The earliest sources of European artistic velvets were [[weaver]]s in [[Lucca]], [[Genoa]], [[Florence]] and [[Venice]].
