'''Steeping''' may mean: 
 #Soaking in [[liquid]] until [[saturation|saturated]] with a [[solution|soluble]] {{broken wikt link|ingredient|ingredient}}, as in, for example, the steeping of [[tea]] and [[coffee]].  In the case of [[herbs|herbal]] tea, it is referred to as {{broken wikt link|decoction|decoction}}, and may also be called {{broken wikt link|macerate|maceration}}. 
 #Soaking to remove an ingredient; Example: [[salt]] from smoked ham or salted [[cod]]. 
 
 One example is the steeping of [[maize|corn]], part of the [[mill (grinding)|milling]] process. As described by the US Corn Refiners Association, harvested [[kernel]]s of corn are cleaned and then steeped in water at a temperature of 50 degrees for 30 to 40 hours. In the process their moisture content rises from 15% to 45% and their volume more than doubles. The [[gluten]] bonds in the corn are weakened and [[starch]] is released.  
 
 The corn is then ground to break free the [[Pathogen|germ]] and other components, and the water used (steepwater), which has absorbed various nutrients, is recycled for use in animal feeds.
