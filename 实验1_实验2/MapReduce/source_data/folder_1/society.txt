'''Society''' is the term to describe [[human]] beings together (collective, the sum of their [[social network]]s and [[social interaction]]s). The term comes from the Latin idea of ''societas'', or the connection between friends or allies (friend or ally being ''socius'').  It can also mean a specific group of people who interact, as well as a wider society of which they are members.  People form societies to gain greater benefits as a group than would be possible separately.  Many animals beside humans also do this, such as wolves or [[eusocial]] insects. [[Sociology]] is the name for the study of society. 
 
 A society is often considered in terms of [[citizenship]], [[rights]], and [[ethics]].  The strength and unity of any society's members' willingness to help each other is to be measured can be called [[social capital]]. 
 
 A [[social contract]] sets out the rules and roles for this kind of cooperation.  One kind of social contract is a [[constitution]] â€“ which outlines to some extent what society in a given state is intended to look like.
