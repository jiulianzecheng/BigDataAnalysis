 '''''Hylaeosaurus''''' was a herbivorous [[ankylosaur]]ian [[dinosaur]] which lived about 136 & nbsp; million years ago in the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of [[England]]. 
 
 It was discovered in 1832 by [[Gideon Mantell]]. In 1842 it was one of the three dinosaurs [[Richard Owen]] based the [[Dinosauria]] on. Only limited remains have been found of ''Hylaeosaurus'' and much of its anatomy is unknown. A recent cladistic analysis sees it as a basal [[ankylosaurid]]. < ref > {{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.02.033 | volume=449 | title=Ankylosaurian dinosaur palaeoenvironmental associations were influenced by extirpation, sea-level fluctuation, and geodispersal | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | pages=289â€“299| year=2016 | last1=Arbour | first1=Victoria M | last2=Zanno | first2=Lindsay E | last3=Gates | first3=Terry | bibcode=2016PPP...449..289A }} < /ref >
