 The '''hornbills''' (Bucerotidae) are a [[family (biology)|family]] of bird found in [[tropical]] and subtropical [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Melanesia]]. They have a long, down-curved bill which is often brightly colored and sometimes has a box-like thing on the upper [[mandible]]. Many states of India like Kerala are fond of the hornbills. It is also the state bird of Kerala. 
 
 The female hornbill lays her eggs in a hole in a [[tree]]. Then, helped by her mate, she seals herself in, covering the entrance with droppings and mud. Only a small slit is left, through which the male gives her food. This keeps the nest safe from [[snake]]s until the chicks are grown enough to leave the nest, and learn how to fly. < ref >  {{cite book |title=Jungle animals: over 100 questions and answers to things you want to know |last=Ganeri |first=Anita |year=2000 |location=Dubai, U.A.E |isbn=0-75254-909-X}} < /ref >
