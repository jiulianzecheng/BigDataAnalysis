 The '''Cricetidae''' are a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[rodent]]s in the large and complicated superfamily [[Muroidea]]. It includes true [[hamster]]s, [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, and [[New World rats and mice]]. With almost 600 species, it is the second largest family of [[mammal]]s, and has animals in it in the [[New World]], [[Asia]], and [[Europe]]. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The cricetids are small mammals, ranging from just 5 to 8 & nbsp;cm and 7 & nbsp;grams in weight in the [[Baiomys|New World Pygmy Mouse]], up to 41 to 62 & nbsp;cm and 1,100 & nbsp;grams in the [[Muskrat]]. How long the tail is depends on how big the body is, and the tails can be either with hair or a little hair. Most species have brown fur, with a white colored underbelly, but there are also many other patterns, especially in the [[Cricetinae|cricetine]] and [[Arvicolinae|arvicoline]] subfamilies. 
 
 Like the [[Muridae|Old World Mice]], cricetids live in a wide range of habitats, in the high [[Arctic]] to tropical [[rainforest]]s and hot [[desert]]s. Some are good at climbing, with long balancing tails and other way to help them to climb, while others can swim, with webbed feet and small [[pinna (anatomy)|external ears]]. Yet others are burrowing animals, or ground-dwellers, which live in the ground. 
 
 Their diet is also variable, with [[herbivore|herbivorous]], [[omnivore|omnivorous]], and [[insectivore|insectivorous]] species known. They all have large, biting and chewing, incisors separated from grinding [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth by a gap, or [[diastema (dentistry)|diastema]].  
 There can be a lot of these animals in a very short time, because the mother gives birth to them after 15 to 50 days, and they have a lot of babies at one time. The young are usually born blind, hairless, and helpless.

 The cricetids are thus classified to contain one prehistoric and 5 living [[subfamilies]], around 112 living [[genera]] and approximately 580 living [[species]]: 
 * [[Arvicolinae]] - [[vole]]s, [[lemming]]s, [[muskrat]] 
 * [[Cricetinae]] - [[hamster]]s 
 * [[Democricetodontinae]] ([[fossil]]) < !-- Palaeontology 46(6): 1133-1149 [ " 'Lartetomys' cf. zapfei "  has since been described as Karydomys wigharti] -- > 
 * [[Neotominae]] - North American rats and mice, including deer mice, [[pack rat]]s, and [[grasshopper mouse|grasshopper mice]] 
 * [[Sigmodontinae]] - New World rats and mice, predominantly South American genera such as [[brucie]]s. 
 * [[Tylomyinae]] - New World climbing rats and relatives
