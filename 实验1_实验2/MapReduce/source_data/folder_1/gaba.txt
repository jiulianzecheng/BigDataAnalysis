'''GABA''' is '''''gamma''-Aminobutyric acid''' ('''γ-Aminobutyric acid'''). It is a [[neurotransmitter]] in the [[central nervous system]] of [[mammal]]s. It is an ''inhibiting'' neurotransmitter. Normally, when a [[neuron]] receives an impulse, it will make the signal stronger. In the case where there is an ''inhibiting'' neurotransmitter, the cell will no longer get the impulse, and the signal as a whole will be weakened.  
 
 GABA regulates how much neurons in the central nervous system will be stimulated in [[humans]], and other mammals. It plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. In humans, GABA is also directly responsible for the regulation of [[muscle tone]]. < ref name= " pmid11837891 " > {{cite journal | author = Watanabe M. |display-authors = etal | title = GABA and GABA receptors in the central nervous system and other organs | journal = Int.

 Even though chemically it is an [[amino acid]], GABA is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities. The term  " amino acid, "  used without a [[qualifier]], refers to the [[alpha amino acid]]s, which GABA is not. GABA is also not incorporated into [[protein]]s.
