 '''Normandy''' ({{lang-fr|Normandie}}) is a region in northern [[France]]. People from Normandy are called '''Normans'''. The name Normandy comes from the  " Northmen "  ({{lang-la|Northmanni}}), also called [[Vikings]]. They came from [[Scandinavia]], and conquered this area in the [[9th century|9th]] and [[10th century|10th]] centuries. The group of people that settled at [[Rouen]] and became the Normans was led by [[Rollo]]. Normandy is also famous for being the location of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[France]] during [[World War II]] (See [[D-Day]]). The [[Battle of Normandy]] was the beginning of the Allied invasion and liberation of [[Europe]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence, such as [[cave painting]]s, show that people lived in Normandy in [[Pre-history|prehistoric times]]. < ref > ''The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography'', Volume 7, ed. Frank N. Magill (London; New York: Routledge, 1999), p. 456 < /ref >  The Gouy and Orival cave paintings also show people lived in [[Seine-Maritime]]. Many [[megaliths]] can be found in Normandy, most of them built in the same way.  
 
 Groups of [[Belgae]] and [[Celts]], known as [[Gauls]], invaded Normandy in the [[4th century BC|4th]] and [[3rd century BC|3rd centuries BC]].  Much of our knowledge about this group comes from [[Julius Caesar]]’s book ''de Bello Gallico''.  Caesar wrote about many groups among the Belgae who lived different areas in [[:en:wikt:agrarian|agrarian]] towns surrounded by walls.  In 57 BC the Gauls worked together and tried to fight Caesar’s army. They were led by [[Vercingetorix]]. The Normans lost an important fight at Alesia. They did not stop fighting until 51 BC, when Caesar finished his [[:wikt:conquest|conquest]] of Gaul. Normandy was part of [[Armorica]] when it was ruled by Romans. 
 
 The [[duchy]] of Normandy began in the year 911. < ref name=Brown15 > R. Allen Brown, ''The Normans and the Norman Conquest'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1998), p. 15 < /ref >  [[Charles the Simple]], King of France gave land near Rouen and the lower [[Seine]] to [[Rollo]], leader of a band of Vikings. {{efn|English sources including The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle used the names Vikings and Danes interchangeably. Continental sources used the names Swedes, Danes and Vikings interchangeably. Only the Irish sources tried to identify Vikings by their origins. They called Danes ''Dub-gaill'' (black foreigners) and Norwegians as ''Finn-gaill'' (white foreigners). < ref > Gwyn Jones, ''A History of the Vikings'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), pp. 75–77 < /ref > }} < ref > ''The Annals of Flodoard of Reims 919–966'', ed.  &  trans.

More land was given in 924 and 933. < ref name=Brown15/ >   
 
 The [[Duke of Normandy]], [[William the Conqueror]], invaded [[England]] in 1066 after King [[Edward the Confessor]] died. William the Conqueror thought he should be [[King of England]]. But [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II]] had [[Coronation|crowned]] himself king. King Harold's [[Anglo-Saxon|Saxon]] [[army]] and William's Norman army fought at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on [[October 14]] 1066. King Harold was [[kill]]ed in the battle. On [[December 25]] 1066 William was crowned [[King of England]] as 'William I'. 
 
 The historic duchy is made of two regions of France: [[Upper Normandy]] and [[Lower Normandy]]. The [[Channel Islands]] are part of the duchy of Normandy. But they are not part of France. The whole duchy was not part of France for a long time. In 1205, [[Philip II of France]] took away all the French land from King [[John of England]]. < ref > Maurice Powicke, ''The Loss of Normandy: 1189 - 1204 ; Studies in the History of the Angevin Empire'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1999), p. 283 < /ref >  Then, Normandy was a province of France.

 During the Second World War (1939–1945) Normandy was part of German-occupied France. < ref > Dominique François, ''Normandy: From D-Day to the Breakout: June 6-July 31, 1944'' (Norwalk, CT: MBI Publishing Company LLC, 2013), p. 12 < /ref >  The town of [[Dieppe]] was the site of the unsuccessful [[Dieppe Raid]] by [[Canadian Army|Canadian]] and [[British Army|British armed forces]]. < ref > ''Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1887-1976: A Selected Bibliography'', ed.

Nearly 160,000 Allied soldiers came to the beaches, in about 7,000 ships and landing craft.   
 
 The Germans were defending their [[fortification]]s above the beaches. [[Caen]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Carentan]], [[Falaise]] and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the Battle of Normandy. The German defenders fought aggressively but were constantly pushed back. The battle for Normandy continued until the closing of the Falaise pocket.{{efn|The Falaise pocket was created by the Allied armies encircling the German army near Falaise. < ref name=Bradley336.338 > John N.

That allowed the breakout of Allied forces into France and finally Germany and was a significant [[:en:wikt:turning point|turning point]] in the war. It led to the restoration of the French government in France. The last bit of Normandy was liberated only on 9 May 1945, at the end of the war un Europe, when the German occupation of the [[Channel Islands]] effectively ended. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 [[File:Aiguille1.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|{{center|The Hollow Needle at Etretat}}]] 
 The historical duchy of Normandy occupied the lower Seine area, the [[Pays de Caux]] and the region to the west through the [[Pays d'Auge]] as far as the [[Cotentin Peninsula]]. The region is bordered along the northern coasts by the [[English Channel]]. There are [[granite]] [[cliff]]s in the west and [[limestone]] cliffs in the east. There are also long stretches of [[beach]] in the center of the region. The unique [[bocage]] hedges are typical of the western areas of Normandy. < ref > Judy Smith, ''Holiday Walks in Normandy'' (Wilmslow: Sigma Leisure, 2001), p. 63 < /ref >  The highest point is the Signal d'Écouves at {{convert|417|m}} in the Massif armoricain. < ref > Barbara Eperon, ''Normandy Picardy  &  Pas De Calais'' (Lincolnwood, IL: Passport Books, 1997), p. 76 < /ref >  Normandy is lightly [[:wikt:forest|forested]].
