 '''Vandalism''' is a [[crime]] that is done by [[wikt:destroy|destroying]] or [[wikt:damage|damaging]] the [[property]] of someone else. This can include [[graffiti]] and [[website]] damage. 
 
 A person that does this is called a '''vandal'''. The name comes from the [[Vandals]], a tribe that attacked and damaged the city of [[Rome]] in 455 CE.

 == On the internet == 
 Many [[website]]s, such as [[wiki]]s (like [[Wikipedia]]), [[Internet forum|forums]], and [[blog]]s, can be changed by anyone. Because of this, they can be  " vandalized "  by adding [[Commentary|comments]] or replacing everything on the [[Webpage|page]] with [[spam]], [[nonsense]] or other [[wikt:silly|silly]] content. It is a kind of [[Troll (internet)|trolling]], and these websites have special users, called [[administrator]]s, whose job is to remove the vandalism and to [[wikt:block|block]] users who do not stop vandalizing.
