 '''Nemertea''' is a [[phylum]] of [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s also known as ''ribbon worms'' or ''proboscis worms''. < ref  name= " ITIS " / >  Most of the 1,400 or so [[species]] are [[Ocean|marine]], with a few living in [[fresh water]] and a small number of [[Land|terrestrial]] forms. They live in all marine habitats, and throughout the world's oceans. < ref name= " Moore " > {{cite book |author=J. Moore  &  R.

 ==Anatomy== 
 Nemertean worms are long, thin, animals without segments. They have no true head, although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body. They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis. This is kept inside the body, but pushed out to catch prey. 
 
 Nemerteans collect food with their proboscis, which is closely associated with the digestive system. At rest, the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm's length, lying just above the gut. It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding. At the anterior end, the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain, and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal. < ref name=IZ/ > 
 
 ===Length=== 
 Nemerteans range in size from 5mm (0.2 & nbsp;in) to over 30 & nbsp;m (100 & nbsp;ft) long in the case of the European ''Lineus longissimus'', with most species being 20 & nbsp;cm (8 & nbsp;in) or less. There are reports of specimens up to 50 or 60m  long, which would make it the longest animal in the world. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.seawater.no/fauna/slimormer/kjempe.htm |title=Giant ribbon worm |publisher=The Marine Fauna Gallery of Norway |accessdate=2007-08-10 |author=Kåre Telnes |archive-date=2007-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710165048/http://www.seawater.no/fauna/slimormer/kjempe.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The longest animal on record is a female [[Blue Whale|blue whale]], 29.9m long. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.wildwhales.org/cetaceans/blue/sr_blue_whale_e.pdf.pdf |title=COSEWIC assessment and update status report on the Blue Whale ''Balaenoptera musculus'' in Canada |publisher=Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.
