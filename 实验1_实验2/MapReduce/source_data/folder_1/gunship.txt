 A '''gunship''' (not to be confused with a [[gunboat]]) is a [[military aircraft]] armed with [[aircraft artillery|heavy aircraft gun]]s, primarily intended for attacking ground targets either as [[airstrike]] or as [[close air support]]. 
 
 In modern usage the term  " gunship "  refers to [[fixed-wing aircraft]] having [[:wikt:lateral|laterally]]-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets.{{sfn|Ballard|1982|p=9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|1970}}  < !-- These gunships are configured to circle the target instead of performing [[strafing]] runs. Such aircraft have their armament on one side harmonized to fire at the apex of an imaginary cone formed by the aircraft and the ground when performing a [[pylon turn]] ([[Banked turn#Aviation|banking turn]]).{{sfn|Ballard|1982|p=9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|1970}} -- >  The term  " gunship "  originated in the mid-19th century as a synonym for [[gunboat]] and also referred to the heavily armed [[ironclad]] [[steamship]]s used during the [[American Civil War]]. < ref > {{citation|title=Mystery photo unseen for 30 years may show Civil War gunship|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/14/mystery-photo-unseen-for-30-years-may-show-civil-war-gunship/|agency=Associated Press|date=	February 14, 2015|publisher=[[Fox News]]}} < /ref > 
 
 The term '''helicopter gunship''' is commonly used to describe [[armed helicopter]]s.

 < !-- During 1942 and 1943, the lack of a usable [[escort fighter]] for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in the [[European Theatre of Operations]] led to experiments in dramatically increasing the armament of a standard [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress]], and later a single [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated B-24D Liberator]], to each have 14 to 16 [[Browning M2|Browning AN/M2 .50 cal machine guns]] as the [[Boeing YB-40 Flying Fortress]] and [[Consolidated XB-41 Liberator]] respectively. These were to accompany regular [[heavy bomber]] formations over occupied Europe on [[strategic bombing]] raids for long-range escort duties as  " flying destroyer gunships " . < ref > Buttler, Griffith. ''American Secret Projects: Fighters, Bombers Attack Aircraft 1937 to 1945''. pp. 104-105. < /ref >  The YB-40 was sometimes described as a gunship,{{sfn|Dorr|2011}} and a small 25-aircraft batch of the B-17-derived gunships were built, with a dozen of these deployed to Europe; the XB-41 had problems with stability and did not progress.

 ===Attack aircraft=== 
 During [[World War II]], the urgent need for hard-hitting [[attack aircraft]] led to the development of the heavily armed gunship versions of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell#Use as a gunship|North American B-25 Mitchell]].

 In the more modern, post-World War II [[fixed-wing aircraft]] category, a gunship is an aircraft having [[:wikt:lateral|laterally]]-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets.{{sfn|Ballard|1982|p=9}}{{sfn|Hamlin|1970}}  < !-- These gunships were configured to circle the target instead of performing [[strafing]] runs.

 The [[Douglas AC-47 Spooky]] was the first notable modern gunship.
