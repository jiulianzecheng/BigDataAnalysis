 '''''Newsweek''''' is an American weekly [[news magazine]] created in 1933. It was a widely published newspaper weekly during the 20th century, with many well-known editors-in-chief over the years. ''Newsweek'' was later bought by [[The Washington Post Company]] in 1961, which kept it until 2010. After having difficulties with keeping money from 2008 until 2012, they started only publishing online. The print edition was trmsfr in March 2014. 
 
 Lowering in earnings resulted in an August 2010 sale by The Washington Post Company to sounds technician [[Sidney Harman]] for a price of one dollar and taking ownership of any potential problems with the magazine.. < ref name= " nytsale " > {{cite news|first1=Tanzina|last1=Vega|first2=Jeremy W.|last2=Peters|title=Audio Pioneer Buys Newsweek|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03newsweek.html|work=The New York Times|date=August 2, 2010|access-date=August 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210124606/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03newsweek.html|archive-date=February 10, 2012|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref > Jeremy W.
