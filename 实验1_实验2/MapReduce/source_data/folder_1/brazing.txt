 '''Brazing''' is a [[metal]]-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. 
 
 Brazing differs from [[welding]] because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from [[soldering]] because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering.  
 
 During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by [[capillary action]]. < ref > Groover, Mikell P. 2007.

 The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting  temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a [[flux]]. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength.
