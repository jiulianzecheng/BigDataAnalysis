 The '''dinoflagellates''' are a large group of [[flagellate]] [[protist]]s. About half are [[photosynthetic]], the rest are mostly [[heterotroph]] [[predator]]s of other protists. The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called '[[algae]]'; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called '[[protozoa]]'.  
 
 They have been classified as an [[Order (biology)|order]], a [[Class (biology)|class]] and a [[phylum]] by different authors. Research is being done on their relationships. 
 
 Most are [[Ocean|marine]] [[plankton]], but they are common in [[fresh water]] habitats as well. Their populations vary with [[sea surface temperature]], [[salinity]], and depth. The group includes many [[symbiont]]s and [[bioluminescent]] [[species]]. 
 
 About 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are  described at present. < ref name= " Gómez, F 2005 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Gómez F. 2005. | title = A list of free-living dinoflagellate species in the world's oceans | url = | journal = Acta Botanica Croatica | volume = 64 | issue = 1| pages = 129–212 }} < /ref >  The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates. < ref name= " Gómez12 " > {{cite journal |author=Gómez F. 2012. |title=A checklist and classification of living dinoflagellates (Dinoflagellata, Alveolata) |journal=CICIMAR Océanides |year=2012 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=65–140 |doi=10.37543/oceanides.v27i1.111 |url=http://www.cicimar.ipn.mx/oacis/Medios/oceanides/P%20065%20Fernando%20Gomez.pdf |access-date=2015-06-16 |archive-date=2013-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127104918/http://www.cicimar.ipn.mx/oacis/Medios/oceanides/P%20065%20Fernando%20Gomez.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Biology == 
 === Zooxanthellae === 
 Some dinoflagellates are [[zooxanthella]]e: [[endosymbiont]]s of marine eukaryotes, and animals such as [[anthozoa]]n [[coral]]s. These [[reef]]-building corals largely depend on them. Other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include [[jellyfish]], [[clam]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[sea slug]]s i.e. [[nudibranch]]s, and also [[ciliate]]s and [[radiolaria]]. 
 
 === Red tides === 
 Dinoflagellates are responsible for the '[[red tide]]s' which may [[poison]] fish. They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Some species produce [[neurotoxin]]s, which in such quantities kill fish and accumulate in filter feeders such as [[shellfish]], which in turn may pass them on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of [[bioluminescent]] dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed. 
 
 === Classification === 
 Although classified as [[eukaryote]]s, the dinoflagellate [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei. In fact, Dodge called the dinoflagellate nucleus ''mesokaryotic'', because it had intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. < ref > Steidinger K.A. and Jangen K. 1997. Dinoflagellates. In: Tómas C.R. ''Identifying marine diatoms and dinoflagellates''. Academic Press. p387–584 < /ref >   This group, however, does have typically eukaryotic [[organelle]]s, such as [[Golgi complex]]es, [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. 
 
 The group contains many complex [[organelle]]s and life styles. Some have structures rather like vertebrates eyes; some have [[nematocyst]]s; some live as [[plasmodia]] (multinucleate forms); some have two [[flagella]]; photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain a  " bewildering array "  of [[plastid]] types; and the whole of their [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]] is eccentric. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Dinoflagellates/2445 |title=Tree of Life project |access-date=2010-03-09 |archive-date=2012-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013131322/http://tolweb.org/Dinoflagellates/2445 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === Fossils === 
 Fossil dinoflagellates are important in ''stratigraphy'', the dating and correlation of [[strata]]. During their life, dinoflagellates have a mobile planktonic form and a resistant cyst phase which enables them to survive over [[winter]] in [[sediment]]. Only the cyst gets fossilised. Their first certain appearance is in the [[Silurian]] period, with a big radiation in the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]]. < ref name= " Levin " > Levin, Harold. 2006. ''The Earth through time''. Wiley, Hoboken N.J. < /ref > < sup > p440 < /sup >  They are classified as [[Phylum]] Dinomastigota by Margulis and colleagues. < ref > Margulis L. Schwartz K.V.  &  Dolan M. 1999. ''Diversity of life: the illustrated guide to the five kingdoms''. Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston, p88. < /ref > 
 
 Dinoflagellates leave fossil [[dinocyst]]s. These have a long geological record: the earliest (lowest) occurrence is from the mid-[[Triassic]]. < ref > {{cite journal |vauthors=MacRae RA, Fensome RA, Williams GL |title=Fossil dinoflagellate diversity, originations, and extinctions and their significance |journal=Can.
