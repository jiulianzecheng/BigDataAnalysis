 [[File:Bakdash ice-cream shop in the old souk in Damascus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Booza being sold in the [[Bakdash]] ice cream shop in the [[Al-Hamidiyah Market]] in the [[Old city of Damascus]]]]'''Booza''' ({{lang-ar|'''بوظة'''}}, also called: '''Arabic ice cream''') is an ice cream that is dense and elastic.  It is made with  " sahlab (Arabic: سَحْلَب) or [[salep]] "  with [[mastic]], and its texture allows it to hold shapes and causes it to melt more slowly. this type is most common in the Eastern Mediteranean. There are ice cream sellers who show tourists where they grind the  " mastic resin "  with a mortar and pestle while singing and playing. The preparation of the ice cream is a real art when the sellers prepare ice cream in deep containers and when the texture becomes hard preparation is done with big [[Mortar and pestle | Mortar]] made of wood while drumming and playing on the ice cream until the ice cream is ready
