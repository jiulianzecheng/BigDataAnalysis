 '''Meteorology''' is the science that focuses on the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/n199 190]}} < /ref >  People who study meteorology are called meteorologists. Meteorologists record [[air pressure]], [[wind speed]] and direction, [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[weather]] patterns, and other information. Meteorologists use this data to understand weather and to predict it. Meteorology is a major branch of [[earth science]]. Meteorologists study the causes of particular weather conditions using information obtained from the [[land]], [[sea]] and upper [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. 
 
 They use [[computer]]ized and [[mathematics|mathematical]] models to make short and long-range [[Weather forecast|forecasts]] concerning weather and [[climate]] patterns. A variety of [[organization]]s use meteorological forecasts including: 
 *[[transport]] services, particularly [[Air travel|air]] and [[Ship|sea travel]] 
 *[[shipping]] and sea [[fishing]] industries and [[sailing]] organisations 
 *[[government]] services, e.g. [[firefighter]] < nowiki/ > s or for advice on [[climate change]] policy 
 *[[Military|armed forces]] 
 *[[farmers]]; 
 *[[service sector|public services]] 
 *[[mass media]] 
 *[[industry]] and [[retail]] businesses 
 *[[Insurance|insurance companies]] 
 *[[Health care|health services]] 
 
 In addition to forecasting, meteorologists study the impact of weather on the environment and conduct research into weather patterns, [[climate change]] and models of weather prediction.
