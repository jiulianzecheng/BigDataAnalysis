 '''Poales''' is a [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[monocotyledon]]s. The order includes [[family (biology)|families]] of [[plants]] such as the [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], and [[sedge]]s. 
 
 Most Poales are wind-pollinated, and so lack the colour and scents of most flowering plants. The bromeliads, however, produce large fruits which are eaten by animals and so act as seed-spreaders. 
 
 The earliest fossils of Poales date to the late [[Cretaceous]] period, about 66 million years ago. Some suggest the origin of the group may be 115 million years ago in [[South America]]. < ref > Bremer K. 2002. Gondwanan evolution of the grass alliance of families (Poales). ''Evolution'' '''56''': 1374–1387. [http://www.bioone.org/bioone/?request=get-abstract & issn=0014-3820 & volume=056 & issue=07 & page=1374 Abstract] < /ref >  The earliest known fossils include [[pollen]] and fruits. 
 
 The [[flower]]s are typically small, enclosed by bracts, and arranged in [[inflorescence]]s (except in the  genus ''[[Mayaca]]'', with solitary terminal flowers). The flowers of most species are wind pollinated. The seeds usually contain [[starch]]. 
 
 Among monocots, the Poales come second to the [[Orchid|orchids]] in number of species. But in economic terms, they are far more important. In fact, the true grasses (Poaceae) produce by far the most important grains eaten by humans and other animals.

 == Diversity and uses == 
 The Poales are the most economically important order of monocots and possibly the most important order of plants in general. Within the order, by far the most important family economically is the family of grasses ([[Poaceae]], syn. Gramineae), which includes [[barley]], [[maize]], [[millet]], [[rice]], and [[wheat]]. It is also the largest family in the order, far outnumbering the other families: 
 * Poaceae: 12,070 species 
 * Cyperaceae: 5,500 species 
 * Bromeliaceae: 3,170 species 
 * Eriocaulaceae: 1,150 species
