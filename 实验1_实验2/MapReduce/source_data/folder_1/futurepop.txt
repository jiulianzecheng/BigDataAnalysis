 '''Futurepop''' is a type of [[electronic dance music]] which uses influences from the genre [[synthpop]] (like [[Song structure (popular music)|song structure]] and [[vocal]] style), [[uplifting trance]] (grandiose and [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[synthesizer]] melodies), and [[Electronic body music|EBM]]. The name was created by [[Ronan Harris]] (of [[VNV Nation]]) and [[Stephan Groth]] (of [[Apoptygma Berzerk]]) while trying to describe the style of music their bands produced. < ref name= " million " > {{cite web|url=http://sortedmagazine.com/Sordid.php3?nID=261
