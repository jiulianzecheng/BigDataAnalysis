 '''Phyllomedusidae ''' is a family of [[frogs]] that live in the [[Neotropic]]s in North America, South America, and nearby islands.  They are called '''leaf frogs''' in English. Some scientists say it is a [[subfamily]] of the family [[Hylidae]], the tree frogs. Other scientists say it is a sister clade to Hylidae instead. 
 
 The family could be a sister group to the [[Pelodryadidae|Australian treefrogs]] (Pelodryadidae), a family of frogs that live in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]. Scientists think this is possible even though the two groups of frogs live very far away from each other, on different continents. All these frogs could have come from the same ancestor frog that lived in early [[Cenozoic]] in [[South America]], where the Phyllomedusidae still live. The two families of frogs would have split from one another during the [[Eocene]] period. The ancestors of Pelodryadidae probably colonized [[Australasia]] from South America by going through [[Antarctica]], which at the time was not yet frozen over. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Duellman|first1=William E.|last2=Marion|first2=Angela B.|last3=Hedges|first3=S.
