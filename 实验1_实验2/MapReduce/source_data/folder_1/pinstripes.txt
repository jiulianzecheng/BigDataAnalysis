 '''Pin stripes''' are a pattern of very [[thin]] [[wikt:stripe|stripes]] running in parallel found in [[cloth]].  
 
 Although pin stripes are found in mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pin striped. In [[baseball]], the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball uniform]]s have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first [[Major League Baseball]] team to have pin striping onto a baseball uniform. < ref > [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/uniforms-cubs.shtml Cubs Uniform] - Baseball Almanac < /ref >  Many other Major League Baseball teams like the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[New York Yankees]] later put pin stripes on their own uniforms.
