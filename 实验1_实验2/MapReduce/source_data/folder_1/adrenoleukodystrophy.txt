'''Adrenoleukodystrophy''' is a [[disease]] that is linked on the X [[chromosome]]. It is a result of [[fatty acid]] [[digestive system|digestive]] [[enzyme]]s not breaking up the [[fat]]s. These fats build up in the [[brain]]. They damage the [[myelin]] that surrounds [[nerve]]s. This can cause [[seizure]]s and [[hyperactivity]]. It can also cause problems with [[speech|speaking]], [[hearing|listening]] and understanding [[verbal]] [[wikt:instruction|instruction]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Adrenoleukodystrophy: What Is It?|url=https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-adrenoleukodystrophy|access-date=2021-11-11|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 About 1 in 17,000 people are born with a genetic disease called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). This severe brain disorder mainly affects boys and men. Thereâ€™s no cure yet for it, but a diagnosis early in life may keep it from getting worse.
