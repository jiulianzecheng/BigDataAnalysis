 '''Prague''' ('''Praha''' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] and the largest [[city]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. 1.4 million people live there. 
 
 Prague has been known as one of the most beautiful European cities since the [[Middle Ages]]. It is often called the  " City of 100 Towers " , the  " Rooftop of Europe "  or the  " Heart of Europe. "  Prague was a place where many [[merchant]]s, [[artist]]s and [[inventor]]s met. 
 
 Prague is full of historical monuments in all major artistic styles. The historic center of Prague is on both banks of the [[Vltava]] river. This historical center has six districts, which were once independent cities that joined in the 18th century. These districts are Staré Město (Old Town), Pražský hrad (Prague castle), Josefov (Old Jewish Town), Nové Město (New Town), Malá Strana (Lesser Town), Hradčany (Prague Castle Quarter) and Vyšehrad. It was Prince Bořivoj who established Prague Castle. There are also lots of [[museum]]s, [[Art gallery|galleries]], [[theater]]s, [[concert hall]]s, and other historic buildings. 
 
 == History == 
 The earliest inhabitants of the area lived in the valley of the Vltava river around 500 BC. Slavonic tribes came to Bohemia in about 500 AD. There is a [[legend]] about how the town of Prague started. Princess Libuše, the leader of a Slavonic tribe, chose a simple [[peasant]] Přemysl to be her [[husband]]. She told him to go and find a village on the banks of the Vltava and to start a town there. The town became Prague, ruled by the Přemyslid family.[[File:Karlův_most.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Charles Bridge]].]]In the second half of the [[9th century]] the [[castle]]’s original fortifications were built. During the reign of Wenceslas I (Václav in [[Czech language|Czech]]) in the [[10th century]] the church of St Vitus was built at Prague castle. Wenceslas was murdered by his brother when he was going to church. He was later made a [[Canonization|saint]]. In the early [[11th century]] the Přemyslid family got power in [[Moravia]], too. Vratislav II was the first [[monarch]] to be called King of Bohemia. 
 
 Another ruler, also called Wenceslas I, ruled as King of Bohemia from 1230. He encouraged the [[arts]]. Many [[Germany|Germans]] came to live in Prague. In 1257 King Otakar II founded the area of Prague called the Lesser Quarter for the Germans to live in. The last of the Přemyslid kings was King Wenceslas III. He was murdered in Moravia. 
 
 During the [[Middle Ages]] Prague became very important as the capital of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruled by [[Charles IV]] (1316-1378) who was the most powerful ruler in [[Europe]] at the time. Charles made Prague a great city, building St Vitus Cathedral, a university, and a famous bridge called [[Charles Bridge]] which still exists. 
 
 After Charles IV there were many arguments and fights in Prague. A priest called [[Jan Hus]] said that the [[Catholic Church]] had become too powerful. He was arrested and burned at the [[stake]] in 1415. A lot of people agreed with what Hus had been saying. These people were called Hussites. They threw a lot of important Catholic people out of the window (called  " defenestration " ). A lot more fighting followed, and for many years Bohemia was ruled by kings who lived in other countries.[[File:Prague crowd Malá Strana.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Packed with tourists on a busy summer day in Malá Strana. (Lesser Quarter), Prague]]

 From 1526 the [[Habsburg]] family ruled Bohemia. They were Catholics and ruled the Holy Roman Empire. In 1576 the Emperor Rudolph II moved the capital from [[Vienna]] to Prague. Prague became a rich town again, and people were free to worship as Catholics or [[Protestants]]. After Rudolph II there were a lot of religious fighting and more people were thrown out of windows. Eventually the fighting became part of the [[Thirty Years’ War]]. When Ferdinand II won the fighting a lot of Protestants left the country. New buildings in Prague were built in the [[Baroque]] style. The German language, not Czech, was spoken at [[court]]. [[Maria Theresa]] was the only queen to reign over Prague. One of her 16 children was [[Marie Antoinette]] who became queen of [[France]]. When her son Joseph II ruled, people stopped fighting about religion. The people were free to speak what they thought, and there was no more [[serfdom]]. Prague now had three parts: the Old Town, the Lesser Quarter and the New Town. Famous people such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] visited the town often. 
 
 In the [[19th century]] [[industry]] came to Prague. Factories were built, a [[railway]] was built between Prague and Vienna. The Czech [[nationalist]] movement became very strong after 1848. They wanted to use their own language instead of German. The composers [[Smetana]] and [[Dvořák]] wrote music about their country, often using Czech [[folksong]]s. The [[National Theatre, Prague|National Theatre]] was opened in 1881. 
 
 In June 1914 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, [[Heir apparent|heir]] to the Habsburg throne, was murdered. This led to [[World War I]]. After the war an independent republic called [[Czechoslovakia]] was formed with Prague as its capital. Bohemia, Moravia and [[Slovakia]] were part of it. In 1938 Hitler invaded the country. It was liberated by [[Soviet]] troops in May 1945. However, the [[communist]]s soon seized power and the country was ruled by communists who had to obey the Soviet Union. The prime minister [[Alexander Dubček]] gradually tried to make reforms. This period of time is called the  " Prague Spring " . In 1968 the Soviet Union sent tanks into Prague to [[Wenceslas Square]] to restore their power. 
 
 [[Democracy]] gradually came to Prague in 1989 when the [[Velvet Revolution]] happened. In 1993 the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] split into two countries. Today both these countries are part of the [[European Union]].
