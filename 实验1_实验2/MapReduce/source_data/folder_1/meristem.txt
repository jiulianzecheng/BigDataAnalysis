 A '''meristem''' is a [[biological tissue|tissue]] in [[plant]]s made of [[cell division|dividing cells]]. They are in parts of the plant where growth can take place. 
 
 Plant cells which are [[Cell differentiation|differentiated]] generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, [[mitosis|cell division]] in the meristem is necessary to get new cells. This allows for the growth of tissues and new organs needed by the plant. 
 
 Meristematic cells have the same function for plants as [[stem cell]]s have for [[animal]]s. They are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cell division. 
 
 The cells are small and [[protoplasm]] fills the cell completely. The [[vacuole]]s are extremely small.  The cytoplasm does not contain plastids (such as [[chloroplasts]], but they are there in rudimentary form ('proplastids'). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The [[cell wall]] is a very thin primary cell wall.

 The apical meristem, or growing tip, is found in the buds and growing tips of roots in plants. 
 
 It begins growth of new cells in young seedlings at the tips of roots and shoots (forming buds, among other things). Specifically, an active apical meristem lays down a growing root or shoot behind itself, pushing itself forward. Apical meristems are very small, compared to the cylinder-shaped lateral meristems. < ref > Lyndon R.F. 1998. ''The shoot apical meristem''.

 ==Primary meristems== 
 Apical meristems may differentiate into three kinds of primary meristem: 
 * '''Protoderm''' – around the outside of the stem and develops into the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]. 
 * '''Procambium''' – just inside of the protoderm and develops into primary [[xylem]] and primary [[phloem]]. It also produces the [[vascular cambium]], a secondary meristem. 
 * '''Ground meristem''' develops into the [[pith]]. It produces the [[cork cambium]], another secondary meristem. 
 
 These meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height. 
 
 == Secondary meristems == 
 These meristems cause secondary growth, or an increase in width. There are two types of secondary meristems: 
 * [[Vascular cambium]] – produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem, which may continue through the life of the plant. It is what gives rise to [[wood]] in plants. Such plants are called [[arborescent]]. It does not occur in plants which do not go through secondary growth, that is, [[herbaceous]] plants. 
 * [[Cork cambium]] – gives rise to the bark of a tree.
