 In military [[munitions]], a '''fuze''' is the part of an [[explosive device]] that makes it explode. In some [[:wikt:device|devices]] (notably [[torpedo]]es) a fuze may be identified by function as the  " exploder " . < ref > Arthur P. Fairfield, ''Naval Ordnance'' (Baltimore, MD: Lord Baltimore Press, 1921), p. 24 < /ref >  The term ''fuze'' is used to indicate an advanced [[:en:wikt:ignition|ignition]] device with mechanical and/or [[electronics|electronic]] parts. < ref > ''The New Weapons of the World Encyclopedia: An International Encyclopedia from 5000 B.C. to the 21st Century'' (New York: St Martin's Griffin, 2007), p. 236 < /ref > 
 
 Time fuzes detonate after a set period of [[:wikt:time|time]]. [[Impact]], [[:en:wikt:percussion|percussion]] or [[:wikt:contact|contact]] fuzes detonate when they hit something, usually the [[:wikt:target|target]]. A [[proximity fuze]] uses [[sensor]]s which can be one or more combinations of the following: [[radar]], active [[sonar]], passive acoustic, [[infrared]], [[magnetic]], [[photoelectric]], [[seismic]] or even [[television]] [[camera]]s. Whatever the sensor used, percussion fuzes cause the explosion to occur close to the target. The target will either be destroyed or severely damaged. 
 
 Most English-language countries use the  " z "  spelling to distinguish between simple burning fuses and [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnical]] or explosive devices. < ref > Rudolf Meyer; Josef KÃ¶hler; Axel Homburg, ''Explosives'' (Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, 2002), p. 148 < /ref >
