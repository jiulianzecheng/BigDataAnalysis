 '''''Dracula''''' is a horror [[novel]] written by the [[Irish people|Irish]] writer [[Bram Stoker]]. Bram Stoker [[publish]]ed the novel in [[England]] in [[1897]]. The character 'Dracula' may have been based in part on [[Sir Henry Irving]] (who was an actor and friend of Bram Stoker) and on [[Vlad III the Impaler]] (a Romanian king). The story is about a [[vampire]] called Dracula. A vampire is a kind of [[monster]] associated with [[death]] and the [[Devil]]. 
 
 == Plot== 
 A young [[solicitor]] (a type of [[lawyer]]) Jonathan Harker goes to the country Transylvania to sell a house in England to a [[nobleman]] named Dracula. After living in the castle for a week, he realizes that Dracula is a vampire. Dracula traps Harker in his castle with three other vampire women (who are called his brides) and goes to England, by hiding on a ship and killing the crew. When he gets to England, he bites a young woman called Lucy Westenra and turns her into a vampire. Lucy is then killed by Abraham van Helsing (a [[medical doctor]]) and the other [[Fictional character|characters]] in the book. Then Dracula bites Jonathan's wife Mina. Because of this, the other characters try to defeat Dracula, by chasing him back to Transylvania and killing him. 
 
 == Ideas for the story == 
 People have written about where Stoker got his ideas for the Dracula story.  It has been said that Stoker's mother [[Charlotte Stoker|Charlotte]] telling him of the events of the terrible [[cholera]] plague in [[Sligo]], Ireland may have given him some ideas.

 The idea of blood may have come from Bram's early years when he was unheathly and in bed all the time and doctors may have tried bleeding him to make him healthly. < ref name= " Belford-p19 " > {{Cite Q|Q114769307|pages=19}} < /ref > 
 
 Ideas for the person of ''Dracula'' may have been taken from Henry Irving.  Stoker worked for Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in London for 30 years. < ref name= " D " > {{Cite Q|Q114771237|pages=xxv}} < /ref >
