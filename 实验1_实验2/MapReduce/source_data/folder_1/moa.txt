 The '''moa''' were large, herbevores and were  [[flightless birds]] with no [[wing]]s. They lived only in [[New Zealand]], and are now all [[extinct]]. 
 
 There were nine [[species]] (in six [[genera]]) of Moa. < ref > Ornithological Society of New Zealand: New Zealand recognised bird names (NZRBN) database [http://www.bird.org.nz/nzrbn.htm] < /ref >  The largest and best known were the [[genus]] ''[[Dinornis]]'', which grew up to 3.6 meters (12 & nbsp;feet) tall, and weighed as much as 230 kilograms (510 pounds).  
 
 The [[MƒÅori people]] arrived in New Zealand from [[Oceania]] about 800 years ago. Then, moas lived in large numbers, especially on South Island. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moas became [[extinct]] about five hundred years ago. < ref > Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. (eds) ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. University of Arizona Press, Tucson AZ. < /ref >  The moas had survived being hunted by [[Haast's eagle]]. However, they could not survive being hunted for food by the Maori. 
 
 Recent extinctions (also mostly birds) have been caused by [[habitat]] change and introduced [[species]].
