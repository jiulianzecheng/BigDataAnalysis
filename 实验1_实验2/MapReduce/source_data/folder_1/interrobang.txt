 An '''interrobang''' or '''interabang''' is a [[grammar|grammatical]] symbol which combines both the [[exclamation mark]] (!) and the [[question mark]] (?). 
 
 The basic purpose of is to put at the end an exclamatory sentence, such as one where we are in disbelief (ex. You did what‽) 
 
 It is a very uncommonly used symbol as most people would simply end their exclamatory questions with both of the symbols like this: !? or ?! 
 
 On a computer an interrobang looks like this: ‽ 
 
 On a chromebook the unicode is: Ctrl+Shift+u+2+0+3+D
