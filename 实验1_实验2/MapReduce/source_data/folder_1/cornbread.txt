 '''Cornbread''' or '''Johnny cake''' is a name for any number of  " quick breads " - bread leavened chemically instead of by yeast- which has [[cornmeal]]. As [[maize]] (also known as corn) is native to [[North America]], the various kinds of cornbreads are more prevalent there. For example the [[Cuisine of the Southern United States]] includes  " cornpone " . In [[Italy]], the corn-based mush known as [[polenta]] is sometimes fashioned into a fried form resembling cornbread.
