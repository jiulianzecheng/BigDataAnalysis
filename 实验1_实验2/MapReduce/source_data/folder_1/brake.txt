 A '''brake''' is a device for [[slow]]ing or [[wikt:stop|stopping]] a moving [[machine]] part. < ref > Factum, part 3, page 123, ''Finnish'' {{ISBN|9513566420}} 003 1 398 < /ref >  The most common brakes are for [[wheel]]s, such as those on [[car]]s and [[bicycle]]s. 
 
 The kinetic energy lost by the moving part is usually converted into heat by friction. There are also regenerative braking systems that store some of the energy in a flywheel or capacitor, or convert it to electricity to store in a battery or send to some other machine. The first braking systems were used on horse-drawn vehicles. The horse accelerated the cart to relatively high speeds and could not cope with its stopping by itself. The first mechanisms braked the wheel itself by means of a manual lever or a system of levers. 
 
 The first braking systems were used on horse-drawn vehicles. The horse accelerated the cart to high speeds and could not cope with its stopping by itself. The brake used a manual lever or a system of levers to press a wooden block onto the wheel, slowing it by friction. In wet weather, it was ineffective. Later, faster vehicles such as [[bicycle]] < nowiki/ > s, [[train]] < nowiki/ > s and [[automobile]] < nowiki/ > s needed much better brakes, and many kinds were invented. Even some airplanes have brakes to slow them in the air.
