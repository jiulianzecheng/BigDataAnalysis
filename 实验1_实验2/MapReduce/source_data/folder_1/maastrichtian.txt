The '''Maastrichtian''' is, in the ICS [[Geologic time scale|geologic timescale]], the latest [[Geologic time scale|age]] of the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. It spanned the interval from [https://geoltime.github.io/?Ma=72.1-66 72.1 to 66] million years ago. The breakup of [[Pangaea]] was nearly complete in the Maastrichtian, with [[Australia]] beginning to break away from [[Antarctica]] and [[Madagascar]] breaking away from [[India]]. However, [[Arabia]] had not yet rifted away from [[Africa]]. [[North America]] was separated from [[Europe]] by rift basins, but [[seabed]] spreading had not yet commenced between the two continents.

 === Flora === 
 The radiation of [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]] was well under way in the Maastrichtian. From 50% to 80% of all [[Genus|genera]] of land plants were angiosperms, though [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]] and [[Fern|ferns]] still covered larger areas of the [[Land|land surface]].
