 '''Iconoclasm''' is a [[belief]] that people should reject religious images (like [[icon]]s or [[monument]]s) by destroying or avoiding them. This is the opposite of [[idolatry]], the worship of icons. Iconoclasm happens during important political or religious changes. It is generally distinct from destruction by foreigners, for example by Spanish [[conquistador]]s in America.  The term does not generally include the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]''), for example [[Akhenaten]] in [[Ancient Egypt]].  
 
 People who support iconoclasm are called '''iconoclasts'''. This word is also used for people who are against established [[dogma]]ta or conventions. Similarly, people who revere or venerate religious images are called '''[[idol]]ators'''. In an [[Eastern Orthodox]] context they are known as '''[[iconodule]]s''', or '''iconophiles'''. 
 
 Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. The two Byzantine outbreaks during the [[8th century|8th]] and [[9th century|9th centuries]] were unusual because the use of images was the main issue in the dispute, rather than a by-product of wider concerns. In [[Christianity]], iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of  " graven images "  of God.
