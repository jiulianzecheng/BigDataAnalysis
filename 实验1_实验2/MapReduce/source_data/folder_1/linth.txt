 The '''Linth''' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈlɪnt|}}  " lint " ) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[river]] that starts near the village of [[Linthal]] in the mountains of the [[canton of Glarus]], and flows into the [[Obersee (Zürichsee)|Obersee]] section of [[Lake Zürich|Lake Zurich]]. It is about {{convert|50|km}} long. < ref name=swtopo > {{cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?zoom=4 & X=211114.56 & Y=719648.15 & lang=en & topic=ech & bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe & catalogNodes=457,510 & layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill | access-date = 2015-04-27}} < /ref > 
 
 The textile industry of the canton of Glarus he started because it could use the water power of the Linth. Today, the river drives the Linth–Limmern power stations in its upper reaches. 
 
 The river and its upper valley are the boundary between the mountain ranges of the [[Glarus Alps]], to its east and south, and the [[Schwyzer Alps]], to its west.
