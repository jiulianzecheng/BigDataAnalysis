 '''Schaffhausen''' is a town in northern [[Switzerland]] and the capital of the [[Schaffhausen (canton)|canton of the same name]]. It has a [[population]] of about 36,000 < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/Selection.aspx?px_language=de & px_db=px-x-0102010000_104 & px_tableid=px-x-0102010000_104%5Cpx-x-0102010000_104.px & px_type=PX|title=PX-Web - Datenbank wählen|website=www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch|access-date=2018-07-17|archive-date=2017-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010143432/https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/Selection.aspx?px_language=de & px_db=px-x-0102010000_104 & px_tableid=px-x-0102010000_104%5Cpx-x-0102010000_104.px & px_type=PX|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  as 2016. 
 
 The old portion of the town has many fine [[Renaissance]] era buildings decorated with exterior [[fresco]]s and [[sculpture]], as well as the impressive old canton [[fort]]ress, the ''[[Munot]]''. A train runs out of town to the nearby [[Rhine Falls]] in [[Neuhausen am Rheinfall]], [[Europe]]'s largest waterfall, a tourist attraction. 
 
 == History == 
 Schaffhausen was a city state in the [[Middle Ages]], documented to have struck its own coins starting in 1045. For a time it was under [[Habsburg]] domination, but regained its independence in 1415. It allied itself with Zürich in 1457, and became a full member of the Swiss Confederation in 1501. The first [[railroad]] came to Schaffhausen in 1857. 
 
 Schaffhausen is in a finger of Swiss land surrounded on three sides by Germany. On April 1, 1944, Schaffhausen suffered a bombing raid by [[United States Army Air Forces]] aircraft which strayed from German airspace into neutral Switzerland. While the United States immediately offered four million dollars in reparations, the raid occurred only a month after the [[Swiss Air Force]] had shot down an American bomber. 
 
 In 1947 it merged with the former municipality of Buchthalen. In 1964 it merged with the former municipality of Herblingen. Since 2009, [[Hemmental]] has been part of the town. 
 
 == Industry == 
 Schaffhausen has some well-known industrial companies ([http://www.georgfischer.ch Georg Fischer]) in piping systems, machine tools and automotives, one internationally-reputed [[watches]] [[manufacturer]] ([[International Watch Company|IWC]]), and drug industry ([[Cilag]], founded by [[Bernhard Joos]]).
