 ==History of the term== 
 
 In ancient Greece there was the word  " Techne "  which is often translated as art. From this word comes  " technical "  and America is now the root of words such as technical, technology, etc. The seven muses were the gods of artists in the seven fields of human excellence: • Epic and lyric • History • Choral singing and poetry of love • Music • Tragedy • Religious Hymns • Gay poetry, poetry and rustic comedy • Dance • Astronomy and Geometry. < ref name= " boundless.com " > {{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/blog/immigrant-art/|title=These Notable American Artists Were Also Immigrants|date=3 May 2017|website=Boundless Immigration}} < /ref > 
 
 The word comes from Latin art  " ars " , that literally means skill method or technique, combined with the beauty of the objects produced. In the Middle Ages already existed the word artist, although its meaning is closer to what we now call the craftsman. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/art-definition.htm|title=Art Definition: Meaning, Classification of Visual Arts|website=www.visual-arts-cork.com}} < /ref > 
 
 ==The present day concept of an artist== 
 
 Concept art expresses a series of creations, called classical arts (painting, sculpture, literature, dance, music, architecture and cinema). However, considering someone as an artist is not limited to a series of works or concrete creations. 
 
 An artist is a person exercising the arts and produce artistic works. The artist is someone who has a special sensitivity to create a work or activity. There is no specific classification of what are an artist's own activities .In any case, the concept artist implies knowledge of art and at the same time, is a craft that can be professional but not necessarily. The artist seeks to create an object or activity that has a component of beauty. Very beautiful is one aspect cherished by the creators, but not only that. It also seeks to communicate feelings and ideas and form their own world. < ref name= " boundless.com " / > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html|title=What is an Artist?|website=www.goines.net}} < /ref >
