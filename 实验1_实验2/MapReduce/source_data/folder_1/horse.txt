 '''Horses''' are a group of [[Animal|animals]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] ''[[Equidae]]''. They are [[Herbivore|herbivores]], which means they eat [[grass]] and other plants. Some plants are dangerous for them, like [[ragwort]], lemongrass (oil grass) and sometimes [[Acorn|acorns]]. 
 
 The standard horse is the species '''''Equus caballus'''''. It was domesticated from [[Przewalski's Horse|wild horses]] by humans at least 5000 years ago. They are large, strong animals and some [[Breed|breeds]] are used to pull heavy loads. Racehorses can gallop up to 30 miles an hour. 
 
 A [[male]] horse is a ''stallion'', and a [[female]] horse is a ''mare'', while the general term for a young horse is ''a foal''. A young female horse is a ''filly'', and a young male horse is a ''colt''. A [[Castration|castrated]] horse is a ''gelding''. Horses have [[Hoof|''hooves'']] which need protection by [[Horseshoe|horseshoes]] from hard or rough ground. 
 
 A horse is related to the rhino and tapir in the order [[Perissodactyla]]. 
 
 == Early horses == 
 [[File:Gotlandsruss-slottsskogen-goteborg.jpg|thumb|200px|A group of horses]] 
 
 The [[evolution]] of horses has been well studied. Fifty million years ago, there were no horses as we know them now. Of the earliest fossil horse, the North American one is called ''[[Eohippus]]'', and the Eurasian one is called ''[[Hyracotherium]]''. Both were small animals: ''Eohippus'' was the larger of the two at twice the size of a [[terrier]] dog. 
 
 Many changes occurred between those little animals and today's horses. These changes are best explained as [[adaptations]]. To its changing [[ecological niche]], from a small [[forest]]-dweller eating nuts and fruit to a more significant forest [[browser]] eating leaves and small branches. Finally, the modern horse is a [[grazer]] on open [[grassland]], with different teeth, legs for running, and a much larger size. Significant changes happened in the mid-[[Miocene]] when the climate cooled and grassland replaced forests. This change continued, and several groups of mammals changed from browsers to grazers. 
 
 == Horses and humans == 
 [[File:Farmer plowing.jpg|thumb|200px|Horses pulling a plough]] 
 Horses have been [[domesticated]] for at least 5000 years. Humans have used them in many different ways for [[travel]], work, food, pleasure and show. [[Cavalry]] horses were used in war until the mid-20th century. They are used for riding and transport. They are also used for carrying things, pulling carts, or helping plough farmers' fields in [[agriculture]]. People have used [[selective breeding]] to make more giant horses do heavy work. 
 
 Some people keep horses as [[Pet|pets]]. Today, horses are mainly used for [[entertainment]] and [[Sport|sports]]. They are also still used for [[Labour (economics)|work]] and transportation in some places. Horses are used in [[equestrianism]], and equine sports such as cross-country, show jumping, and other events. [[Show jumping]], cross-country, and [[dressage]] are Olympic sports.  " Equus "  is the old [[Latin]] word for horse. 
 
 == Other uses of horses == 
 Horsehide is a rugged leather made from the skin of horses. Horsehair is used to create a stiff fabric. Horsehair can also be used as a stuffing for furniture. Horsehair can be mixed with plaster to make it strong. People can use horse bones to make [[gelatin]] for food. People can also use the bones to make [[glue]]. Animal glue is still preferred by some woodworkers. 
 
 Horses are used all over the world to carry people and pull carts. Big cities use them to help [[police]] watch and protect people in crowds. 
 
 == Mare == 
 A '''mare''' is a female horse. Other female equines are also sometimes called mares. Before the mare's third birthday, the mare is called a filly. When a mare wants to mate, the mare is called ''in heat''. This part of the [[Estrous cycle|oestrous cycle]] lasts about three weeks. Mares are more prone to being temperamental. Some people would call this being  " mare-ish. "
