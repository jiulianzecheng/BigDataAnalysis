 '''Zeolites''' are microporous, [[aluminosilicate]] [[mineral]]s. It is commonly used as commercial absorbants and [[catalyst]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2009-02-15|title=W. R.

He called the material ''zeolite'', from the Greek ζέω (zéō), meaning  " to boil "  and λίθος (líthos), meaning  " stone " . < ref > {{Cite journal|date=December 1893|title=Bihang till Kongl.

 ==Occurrence== 
 Natural zeolites form where [[Volcanic Rock|volcanic rocks]] and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] react with [[Alkali|alkaline]] [[groundwater]]. Zeolites found in [[nature]] are almost never pure. They are contaminated by other minerals, [[Metal|metals]], [[quartz]], or other zeolites. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Zeolites can be used in domestic and commercial [[water purification]], [[water softening]], and other uses. Zeolites were also found to help [[silver]] naturally emit [[light]], which may compete with [[Fluorescent light|fluorescent lights]] or [[LEDs]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Scientists discover why silver clusters emit light|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-08-scientists-silver-clusters-emit.html|access-date=2021-05-11|website=phys.org|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Zeolites can be used to store solar heat harvested from solar thermal collectors. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=1978-07-01|title=Solar heating and cooling system design and development. Status summary, April--June 1978|doi=10.2172/6594099|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2172/6594099}} < /ref >  The largest use for zeolite is the global laundry [[detergent]] market.
