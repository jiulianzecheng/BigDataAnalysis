 '''''Penicillium''''' is a group, or a [[genus]], of [[Ascomycota|ascomycetous]] [[Fungus|fungi]] commonly isolated from environments like soil, vegetation, and many food products. It is known to have ecological importance as a decomposer of [[Organic matter|organic material]] and cause rotting in food crops by mycotoxin production. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Pitt|first=J.

Antibiotics kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of [[bacteria]] inside the body to reduce or stop infection of harmful bacteria. This genus of 354 species is widely impactful with many applications affecting every modern human today e.g., food and drug production. < ref name= " Kirk2008 " > Kirk PM; ''et al'' 2008.

 == Characteristics == 
 The [[mycelium]] is a highly branched network of multinucleate, usually colourless [[hyphae]]. The conidiospores are the main [[dispersion|dispersal route]] of the fungi, and are often green in colour. 
 
 Sexual reproduction involves the production of ascospores. The [[ascus|asci]] contain eight unicellular ascospores each. 
 
 == Ecology == 
 Species of ''Penicillium'' are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates, commonly present wherever organic material is available. [[Saprophyte|Saprophytic]] species of ''Penicillium'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' are among the best-known representatives of the [[Eurotiales]]. They live mainly on organic biodegradable substances. Commonly known as [[mould]]s, they are among the main causes of [[food spoilage]]. < ref name=Samson2004 > Samson R.A; Seifert K.A. ''et al'' 2004.

The ability of these ''Penicillium'' species to grow on [[seeds]] and other stored foods depends on their ability to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist. < ref name=Pitt2000 > Pitt J.I.

 '''''Penicillium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[fungi]] that includes: 
 * ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (previously known as ''[[Penicillium notatum]]''), which produces the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]]. 
 * ''[[Penicillium marneffei]]'', a [[thermally dimorphic fungus|thermally dimorphic]] species endemic in [[Southeast Asia]], which presents a threat of systemic infection to [[AIDS]] patients. 
 * ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'', which is used in the production of [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] and [[Brie cheese|Brie]] [[cheese]]s. 
 * ''[[Penicillium candida]]'', which is used in making Brie and Camembert. 
 * ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]'', which is used in making [[Gorgonzola cheese]]. 
 * ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'', which is used in making [[Roquefort cheese|Roquefort]], [[Danish Blue cheese]] and also recently Gorgonzola.
