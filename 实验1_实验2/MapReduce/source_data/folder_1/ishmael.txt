 '''Ishmael''' ({{lang-he|יִשְׁמָעֵאל}}, {{lang-ar|إسماعيل}}إ‎ ʾIsmāʿīl) was the first son of [[Abraham]] and [[Hagar]], an [[Egypt]]ian servant.  
 
 He was a son of [[Abraham]], descendant of [[Arpachshad]], son of [[Shem]], son of [[Noah]], grandson of [[Methuselah]] and coming from line of [[Seth]], son of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], first human. 
 
 == In the Book of Genesis == 
 When Abraham (then called Abram) was married to [[Sarah|Sarai]] for ten years without having any children, Sarai told Abram to marry her Egyptian servant [[Hagar]] and he did. After getting pregnant, Hagar became arrogant so Sarai treated her badly and she ran away. Then an [[Angel]] convinced Hagar to go back and said her son would be called Ishmael. Hagar gave birth to a son and Abram named him [[Ishmael]].  
 
 When Abram was [[Circumcision|circumcised]], [[Hashem|G-d]] changed his name to [[Abraham]]. And Ishmael was also circumcised and was thirteen years old at the time. One year later, Sarai whose name was now [[Sarah]] gave birth to a son while she was 90 years old and Abraham was 100. Abraham [[Circumcision|circumcised]] the boy eight days later and named him [[Isaac]]. When Sarah saw how Ishmael played with his [[half-brother]] Isaac, she told Abraham “cast out this slave woman and her son from before me” but Abraham didn’t want to do that so [[Hashem|G-d]] told Abraham to listen to Sarah. So Abraham sent Ishmael and Hagar away with water. Then Ishmael got sick so Hagar gave him all the water and then looked for more so an [[Angel]] showed her a well. Hagar gave Ishmael water and he got better. Ishmael went to [[Egypt]], married an Egyptian woman and became the father of twelve sons and one daughter.      
 
 == Death of Abraham == 
 After [[Abraham]] died, [[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]] buried him in the Cave of Machpelah in [[Hebron]] next to his wife [[Sarah]] 
 
 == Basemath == 
 After Ishmael died, his daughter [[Basemath]] married [[Esau]], who was one of Isaac’s sons.  
 
 == Sale of Joseph == 
 When [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] and his brothers sold [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] into slavery, they sold him to the [[Ishmaelites]], who were Ishmael’s grandchildren.
