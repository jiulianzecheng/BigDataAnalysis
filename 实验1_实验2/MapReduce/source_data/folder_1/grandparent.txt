 The term '''grandparent''' means the [[parents]] of a person's [[father]] or [[mother]]. [[Wikt:grandparent|Grandparent]]s have always been important members of a [[family]]. < ref name=BosakLP > {{cite web |url=http://www.legacyproject.org/guides/gpvip.html |title=Why Grandparents are VIPs |author=Susan V. Bosak |website= |publisher=legacyproject.org |accessdate=21 December 2015}} < /ref >  The [[role]] of a parent is often very different from the role of a grandparent. Parents are the [[wikt:provide|provide]]rs and [[Discipline|disciplinarians]] of their [[children]]. < ref name=BosakLP/ >  Grandparents are often much freer to [[wikt:enjoy|enjoy]] and have [[wikt:fun|fun]] with their grandchildren. < ref name=BosakLP/ >  A grandparent-grandchild [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] is usually much simpler than that of a parent and child. < ref name=BosakLP/ > 
 
 The term 'grandparent' is used for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[gender]]s. The male grandparent is called a [[wikt:grandfather|grandfather]]. The female grandparent is a [[wikt:grandmother|grandmother]]. When looking at the [[Kinship|relationship]] from the [[wikt:point of view|point of view]] of the grandparent, the term [[wikt:grandchild|grandchild]] is used. A grandchild is the [[child]] of a person's child. It can also be used based on gender. Grandchild is correct for either gender. [[wikt:grandson|Grandson]] is male. [[wikt:Granddaughter|Granddaughter]] is female.

 == Grandparents and grandchildren == 
 For [[example]]: Bob has a son named Rick. Rick, in turn, has 2 children; a boy (Bill) and a girl (Mary). Bob is the grandfather (male grandparent) of both Bill and Mary. Bill is the grandson (male grandchild) of Bob, and Mary is the granddaughter (female grandchild) of Bob. Rick's mother would be the grandmother (female grandparent) of both Mary and Bill. 
 
 There are a number of [[nickname]]s for a person's grandparents. These include 'grandpa', 'grandpapa', 'papa' and 'pawpa' for a grandfather. < ref name=HuffPost > {{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/02/grandparents-names-glamma_n_2774101.html |title=Grandparents' Names Go Beyond 'Grandma' And 'Grandpa' |author= |date=2 March 2013 |website=Huffington Post |publisher= |accessdate=21 December 2015}} < /ref >  Nicknames for grandmothers include 'grandma', 'grammy', 'granny', and 'nanna'. < ref name=HuffPost/ >  There are also many unique nicknames. An example is [[Americans|American]] [[actress]] [[Goldie Hawn]] who did not want to be called 'grandma', instead came up with the nickname 'Glamma.' 
 
 [[Custom|Traditionally]], grandparents were highly respected in most [[culture]]s. < ref name=BaskinPT > {{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/smores-and-more/201312/keeping-grandparents-relevant |title=Keeping Grandparents Relevant |author=Steve Baskin |date=6 December 2013 |website= |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=21 December 2015}} < /ref >  Today many grandparent-grandchild relationships are [[wikt:declining|declining]]. Much of the modern [[world]] does not [[value]] older people the way [[Society|societies]] did in the past. < ref name=BaskinPT/ >  Also, popular [[entertainment]], especially [[television program|programs]] and [[movie]]s aimed at 'tweens' (children 10 to 12 years old) portray [[adult]]s as being [[Foolishness|foolish]]. < ref name=BaskinPT/ >  This makes the involvement of grandparents more important than ever. < ref name=BaskinPT/ > 
 
 == Great-grandparents == 
 [[File:Ahnentafel prinz commercy.png|thumb|300px|{{center|A person's pedigree showing five generations of ancestors or to the third great-grandparents}}]] 
 
 A person's great-grandparent's ''parents'' would be that person's  " great-great-grandparents " . Commonly the [[prefix]] ''great-'' is added, one for each additional [[generation]]. To avoid having to add several  " greats "  when discussing a direct [[ancestor]]s, [[Ordinal number|ordinals]] are commonly used instead. For example, a  " great-great-grandfather "  would be a  " second great-grandfather " . A  " great-great-great-grandfather "  would be a third great-grandfather, and so on. Some sources also use [[cardinal number]]s for numbering greats. For example, a great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother becomes  " six times great grandmother " . However, sixth great-grandmother would be most commonly used. 
 
 Not counting the individual person in the relationship, a parent is the first generation of the person's ancestors. A grandparent is the second generation (from the individual). < ref name=Mukherjee157 > Ramkrishna Mukherjee, ''Classification in Social Research'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983), p. 157 < /ref >  A great-grandparent would be the third generation and so a great-great-grandparent would be in the fourth generation of ancestors, and so on. < ref name=Mukherjee157/ >  Another way of putting it is a person's second great-grandparent is a grandparent's grandparent. 
 
 In the past, many great-grandparents died long before their great-grandchildren were born. < ref name=RosenbloomNYT > {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/fashion/02parents.html?pagewanted=all & _r=0 |title=Here Come the Great-Grandparents |author=Stephanie Rosenbloom |date=2 November 2006 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 December 2015}} < /ref >  Today, people in many societies are living longer. < ref name=RosenbloomNYT/ >  This means many children get to know at least one of their great-grandparents. < ref name=RosenbloomNYT/ > 
 
 == Nuclear family vs close kin == 
 The word 'family' is often used to mean the same as the term [[Nuclear family]]. < ref name=JacksonCSU > {{cite web |url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/k/kawamoto/downloadable/50jackson1.htm |title=Traditional Nuclear Family vs. Blended Family |author=Kristy Jackson |website= |publisher=California State University, Sacramento |accessdate=21 December 2015}} < /ref >  Strictly speaking, a nuclear family is made up of a husband, a wife, and their children. < ref name=JacksonCSU/ >  It may also be used to include a [[Stepfamily|stepparent]], [[Stepfamily|stepchildren]] or [[Adoption|adopted children]]. < ref > William Haviland; Harald Prins; Bunny McBride; et al., ''Cultural anthropology: the human challenge'' (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, 2014), p. 223 < /ref >  However, the latter family unit is more commonly called a [[Stepfamily|blended family]]. [[Kinship|Close kin]] however extends the family unit. For example, [[Cousin|second cousins]] are all descendants of one or both great-grandparents. < ref name=Gudeman182 > Stephen Gudeman, ''Relationships, Residence and the Individual: A Rural Panamanian Community'' (New York; London: Routledge, 2006), p. 182 < /ref >  Family units extending to second cousins are considered close kin. < ref name=Gudeman182/ >  So the term includes great-grandparents as well. Third cousins (all those descended from second great-grandparents) are not considered close kin, but just family. < ref name=Gudeman182/ > 
 
 == Distant grandparents and pedigree collapse == 
 A person's ancestor tree is a [[Binary number|binary tree]]. It is formed by the person, the parents (2), the grandparents (4), great-grandparents (8), and so on. With each increasing generation of great-grandparents the number doubles. In other words, a person's sixth great-grandparents (great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents) would number 256 or  < math > 2^{8} < /math >  (2 to the 8th power). However, the number of individuals in such a tree grows [[Exponential function|exponentially]] and will eventually become impossibly high. For example, a single individual alive today would, over 30 generations going back to the [[High Middle Ages]], have about  < math > 2^{30} < /math >  generations or just over a [[billion]] ancestors. That would be far more than the total [[world population]] at the time.{{efn|Using the [[formula]] of 3.3 generations per [[century]], 30 generations ago would be approximately the generation living about the year 1100 [[AD]]. An [[Estimation|estimate]] of the world population in 1100 is only about 301 [[million]] people. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ecology.com/population-estimates-year-2050/ |title=Population Estimates: Year One through 2050 A.D. |author= |website= |publisher=Ecology Global Network |accessdate=21 December 2015 |archive-date=4 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904072429/http://www.ecology.com/population-estimates-year-2050/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > }} 
 
 This [[paradox]] or impossible situation, is explained by having shared ancestors, which is called pedigree collapse. Instead of every person today having a [[family tree]] of all [[wikt:unique|unique]] ancestors, many of these ancestors occupy more than one position in the [[pedigree]]. In other words, one's 15th great-grandfather may have been their 15th great-grandfather more than once if the person today is descended from children of both or all of his marriages. So in a typical family tree, the same ancestor may pop up in more than one place in the pedigree. < ref > Esther Yu Sumner, 'Welcome to the Family', ''Ancestry'' Vol. 26, No. 6 (November–December 2008), p. 31 < /ref >  Pedigree collapse is generally caused by close relatives marrying in the past, which was common in many societies. Even today, because most people do not know their ancestry beyond their grandparents, they are inadvertently marrying their own distant cousins. On average, a typical [[Europe]]an marriage today is between sixth cousins (those descended from a common sixth great-grandparent). < ref name=SciMus > {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/WhoAmI/FindOutMore/Yourgenes/Wheredidwecomefrom/Whatispopulationsgenetics/Howareweallrelated.aspx |title=How are we all related? |author= |website= |publisher=The Science Museum |accessdate=21 December 2015 |archive-date=4 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004152818/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/WhoAmI/FindOutMore/Yourgenes/Wheredidwecomefrom/Whatispopulationsgenetics/Howareweallrelated.aspx |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In closed societies the relationship is usually much closer. < ref name=SciMus/ >
