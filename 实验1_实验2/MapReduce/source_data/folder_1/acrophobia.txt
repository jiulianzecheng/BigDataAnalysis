 '''Acrohobia''' is the [[fear]] of [[Height|heights]]. People with acrophobia experience a fear or phobia when they are at a certain height, and they are being made aware of it. The word is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] akros - top, height, and phobia - fear.  People who do not suffer from acrophobia are said to have a [[head for heights]]. [[Vertigo]] is often used to describe a fear of heights.
