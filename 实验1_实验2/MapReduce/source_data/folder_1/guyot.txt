 A '''guyot''' is an underwater mountain  or [[seamount]] with a flat top. This geologic feature is also called a '''tablemount'''.  In general, the guyot or tablemount is over 200 meters (660 & nbsp;feet) below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat underwater summits may be more than {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " britannica " > [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/250080/guyot Guyot] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''; retrieved 2012-06-09. < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 The existence of flat-topped mountains below the surface of the ocean was established in 1965. [[Harry Hammond Hess]] used echo-sounding equipment to map the floor of the ocean.  The research revealed that some undersea mountains had flat tops.

 Hess called these undersea mountains  " guyots "  because they reminded him of Guyot Hall at [[Princeton University]]. The flat roof was a special feature of this building.  Guyot Hall was  named after the 18th century geographer [[Arnold Henry Guyot]]. < ref > {{cite web|website=Princeton.edu|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/guyot_arnold.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180929024755/http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/guyot_arnold.html |archive-date=2018-09-29 |title=Guyot, Arnold  < nowiki > [Henri] < /nowiki > ]|access-date=2012-06-09}} < /ref >   In other words, the geology term  " guyot "  comes from his name. 
 
 ==Description==  
 Guyots show evidence of having been above the surface at one time. The exposed area was shaped by [[erosion]] caused by rain, wind and waves. < ref name= " britannica " / >   
 
 The Hawaiian islands plus former islands which are now beneath the sea make up the [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain]], and five of the peaks in the chain are guyots. < ref > Frankel, Henry R.
