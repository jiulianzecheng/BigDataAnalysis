 '''Kalypso''' or '''Calypso''' is a [[nymph]] in [[Greek mythology]], who lives on the island [[Ogygia]]. This island was so hidden that no man would find it twice.  Calypso was the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] so she was placed on the island and not allowed to leave. 
 
 In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the hero [[Odysseus]] comes to her island after escaping from the sea, and the death of his men. Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god [[Hermes]] came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus [[immortality]] (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife [[Penelope]], and so he left her. She can be seductive at times.
