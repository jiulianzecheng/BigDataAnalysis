 A '''pyramid''' is a [[structure]], usually made of stone, built in the shape of a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]. From [[Ancient history|ancient]] to modern times people in many different parts of the [[Earth|world]] have built such structures. 
 
 The word  " pyramid "  comes from the Greek word ''pyramis'' which meant  " wheat cake. "  The [[ancient Egypt]]ian word for them was something like  " Mer " . < ref > Janet, Wood.  " ANCIENT NILE'S ANCIENT EGYPT: PYRAMIDS History of the Egyptian Pyramids " . 1995. Ancientnile.co.uk. Retrieved 11 November 2014. < /ref >  The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] was one of the [[Wonders of the World#Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the ancient world]]. 
 
 The first pyramids were built in 2630 & nbsp;B.C. The oldest known pyramid was made for king Djoser of the third Dynasty. 
 
 == Egyptian pyramids == 
 In [[Egypt]], [[king]]s and [[queen]]s, called [[Pharaoh]]s, were buried in the tombs of huge square-bottomed pyramids built of stone. They were usually built to be used as [[tomb]]s for Pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian pyramids are very well built. Some of the pyramids still stand today. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.ducksters.com/history/ancient_egyptian_pyramids.php|title=Ancient Egyptian History for Kids: Pyramids|website=www.ducksters.com}} < /ref > 
 
 The oldest man-made pyramid found is called the Step pyramid. It is in the [[Giza Necropolis]] in Saqqara, near [[Cairo]], Egypt. It was built for King Djoser thousands of years ago. Later pyramids were built much larger. The largest one was the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. It is near [[Cairo]]. It was the tallest building in the world until the [[Eiffel Tower]] was built in Paris, in 1889. The Great Pyramid was built by the pharaoh [[Khufu]] (= Cheops) from the [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom]]. Herodotus was told by his Egyptian guides that it took twenty years for a force of 100,000 slaves to build the pyramid (with another ten years to build a stone [[causeway]] that connected to a temple in the valley below). 
 
 People once thought pyramids were built by [[slave]]s. More recent evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were paid and well-cared for. They were loyal to the Pharaoh. Inside the Great Pyramid, famous man-made objects have been found from ancient times. Many valuable items were buried with the dead Pharaohs, in the hope that they would take them to the [[afterlife]]. Pyramids usually had traps to stop [[Theft|thieves]] from escaping easily. Tomb thieves were punished by death if they were caught. However, by 1000 & nbsp;BC, many of the pyramids had been robbed of their precious treasures. 
 
 A large statue of a [[Sphinx]] stands near the pyramids at Giza. It has the body of a Lion and the head of a Pharaoh. 
 
 The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] called the Great Pyramid one of the [[seven wonders of the world]]. There are over 100 pyramids in Egypt. Most of them are on the western side of the [[River Nile]]. Some Egyptologists have different opinions on why the ancient Egyptian Kings built pyramids as their tombs. Pyramids have been excavated for about the last 200 years. 
 
 The ancient Egyptians believed that the Egyptian pharaohs went to the stars to join their gods in the afterlife.

 The [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] and [[Mayans]] also built many massive pyramids. None are as old or big as the oldest or biggest Egyptian pyramids. Most of them are [[step pyramid]]s. 
 
 Unlike Egyptian pyramids, which were used as tombs for rulers and wealthy people, Aztec and Mayan pyramids are believed to have been used for public displays of [[human sacrifice]].
