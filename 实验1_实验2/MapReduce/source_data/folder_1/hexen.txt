'''''Hexen''''' is a [[first person shooter]] [[video game]]. It is a [[sequel]] to the [[computer game]] [[Heretic (game)|Heretic]], created by [[ID Software]] and [[Raven Software]]. The player can choose to play as a [[fighter]], a [[cleric]] (knight), or a [[mage]] (wizard). Each [[fictional character|character]] can use 4 different [[weapons]]. The [[monster]]s are like the monsters in [[Heretic (game)|Heretic]], but there are a few new ones. This game uses a better [[design]] and plays much better than Heretic. In ''Hexen'', [[door]]s can open forward instead of just going up, you can jump, [[glass]] can break when you shoot it, and monsters can make things happen when they die, like making an item. There is also more of a story in ''Hexen''.
