 ==Notable features== 
 ===The Slayer=== 
 The Slayer or ''Chosen One'' is a young girl with [[superpower|super-human]] [[strength]], [[agility]] and [[stamina]]. It is her [[destiny]] to fight [[evil]]. When one Slayer is killed, a new girl is ''chosen'' to become the new Slayer. The new slayer has all of the power of the last Slayer as soon as she is chosen. The new Slayer also begins to have [[dream]]s that tell her of her future and Slayers from the past. 
 
 The first Slayer was created long before [[writing|written]] [[history]] by a group of men who looked like [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigine]]. She was created by combine her with a demon. As each Slayer is killed, the demon moves to the next slayer. It gives her the powers of the Slayer as well as the dreams of its past with the other slayers. 
 
 === Hellmouth === 
 In the Buffyverse there are many different ''dimensions'' or worlds. Some are full of evil. A place where the borders between the normal world and an evil dimension are weak is called a Hellmouth. Evil in the normal world will naturally move towards a hellmouth. The area closest to a hellmouth will be home to much evil and strange [[wikt:circumstance|circumstances]]. 
 
 There are two well known hellmouths in the Buffyverse. The first is located in Sunnydale, California. This is the place where the [[story|stories]] in ''Buffy'' take place. It is the largest and most powerful hellmouth in the Buffyverse. The second hellmouth is in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Not much is known about this hellmouth.
