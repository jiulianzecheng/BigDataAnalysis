 The '''Apterygota''' are a small [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] of primitive [[insect]]s. 
 
 They are insects which have never had [[wing]]s at any time in their [[evolution]]ary history. Their first known occurrence in the fossil record is in the [[Rhynie chert]] of the [[Devonian]] period, ~400 million years ago. While some other insects, such as [[flea]]s, also lack wings, these are descended from winged insects, and have lost them during the course of evolution. By contrast, the apterygotes are a primitive group of insects that diverged from other orders before wings evolved. 
 
 They have some other primitive [[trait]]s (features). 
 The [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] (younger stages) go through little or no [[metamorphosis]], so they look like the adults. They continue to [[moult]] throughout life, with multiple [[instar]]s (stages) after reaching sexual maturity. All other insects have only a single sexually mature adult stage. Their skin is thin, making them appear translucent. Males deposit [[sperm]] packages rather than fertilising the female internally. < ref name=IIBD > {{cite book |author= Hoell, H.V., Doyen J.T.  &  Purcell A.H. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to insect biology and diversity |publisher= 2nd ed, Oxford University Press |pages= 333–340|isbn= 0-19-510033-6}} < /ref > 
 
 Currently, no [[species]] are listed as being at conservation risk. 
 
 == History of the group == 
 The classification of the Apterygota changed over time. By the mid 20th century, the subclass included four orders ([[Collembola]], [[Protura]], [[Diplura]], and [[Thysanura]]). With the advent of a more rigorous [[cladistic]] methodology, the subclass turned out to be [[paraphyletic]]. The first three groups formed a monophyletic group, the [[Entognatha]]. The Thysanura is more closely related to [[Pterygota|winged insects]]. < ref > [http://www.uoguelph.ca/debu/STEVEweb/html/Thysanura.htm Orders {{ndash}} Thysanura  &  Archaeognatha] < /ref >  thus rendering even the amyocerate apterygotes paraphyletic. 
 
 Some think the Collembola are no longer insects at all, but their position is not yet clear. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Frédéric Delsuc, Matthew J.
