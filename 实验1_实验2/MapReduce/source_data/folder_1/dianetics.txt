 '''Dianetics''' is an [[alternative medicine|alternative]] mental health [[therapy]] created by [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Ron Hubbard]], who published a book about it  in 1950 with the title  " Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health " . It is about the way people think.  Hubbard also started the [[religion]] of [[Scientology]], which uses Dianetics. 
 
 The photo at the right shows a person learning about Dianetics by doing a [[Stress (biology)|stress]] test. The idea of the stress test is to show people something in their own minds. 
 
 Most [[psychology|psychologists]] think that Dianetics is a [[pseudoscience]]. That means that it is not really a science, and it only looks like one.
