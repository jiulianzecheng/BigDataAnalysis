The '''nationality''' of a person is that person's legal relationship with a [[state]], for example a Swedish person's legal relationship with the kingdom of [[Sweden]]. < ref name= " Vonk2012 " > Vonk, Olivier.

Martinus Nijhoff Publishers; 2012-03-19 [cited 17 August 2012]. {{ISBN|9789004227200}}. p. 19. < /ref >  Nationality is not identical to [[citizenship]] but in the majority of states most of the population are both citizens and nationals. Dual nationality means that the person has a legal relationship with two different states at the same time, for example with the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The rights and duties of individual people and the states they belong to vary from country to country. < ref name= " Weis1979 " > Weis, Paul.

 " Nationality "  can take on different meanings depending on the country, language and [[culture]] in question. For example, someone of [[Italy|Italian]] descent may be called  " Italian "  even if the individual, a member of the Italian [[diaspora]], has no right to an Italian [[passport]] and citizenship. In past centuries, the usual meaning of  " nationality "  was not political, but rather meant membership in an [[ethnic group]]. In modern cases such as in airports, when officials ask your  " nationality, "  they are asking to see the passport you use for travel to foreign countries.
