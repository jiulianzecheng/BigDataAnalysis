 '''Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase''', better known as '''RuBisCO''',{{#tag:ref|The term  " Rubisco "  was  coined humorously in 1979 by David Eisenberg at a seminar.  The abbreviation came from the full name ('''R'''ib'''u'''lose-1,5-'''bis'''phosphate '''c'''arboxylase/'''o'''xygenase). < ref > {{cite journal | author = Wildman SG | title = Along the trail from fraction I protein to Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) | journal = Photosyn.

Carbon fixation is how the [[atom]]s of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] are made available to [[organism]]s in the form of [[fuel|energy-rich]] [[molecule]]s such as [[glucose]]. RuBisCO splits 6-C molecules into two equal parts. 
 
 RuBisCO is very important in [[biology]] and [[ecology]] because it catalyzes the primary [[chemical reaction]] by which [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[carbon]] permanently enters the [[biosphere]]. 
 
 RuBisCO is also the most abundant [[protein]] in [[leaf|leaves]] and the most abundant protein on Earth. < ref > {{cite book |author=Cooper, Geoffrey M. |title=The Cell: a molecular approach |publisher=ASM Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2000 |isbn=0-87893-106-6 |edition=2nd |chapter=10.The Chloroplast Genome |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=RuBisCO & rid=cooper.section.1655#1659 |quote= One of the subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rubisco) is encoded by [[chloroplast]] [[DNA]]. Rubisco is the critical enzyme which catalyzes the addition of CO < sub > 2 < /sub >  to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate during the Calvin cycle (see Figure 2.39).

 Given its important role in the [[biosphere]], there are currently efforts to [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineer]] [[crop]] plants to contain more efficient RuBisCO. < ref > Ellis, R.
