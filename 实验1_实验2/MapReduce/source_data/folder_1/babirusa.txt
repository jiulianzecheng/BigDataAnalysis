 The '''babirusas''' are a genus '''''Babyrousa''''', in the [[pig]] family ([[Suidae]]). They live in in [[Wallace Line|Wallacea]], or the Indonesian islands of [[Sulawesi]], [[Togian Islands|Togian]], [[Sula]] and [[Buru]].  
 
 They are often called '''deer pigs'''. All members of this genus were part of a single species. After the split into several species, ''Babyrousa'' is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa is named ''B. celebensis''.  
 
 The name  " pig-deer "  has sometimes also been used in [[English language|English]], and is a direct translation of the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] babi-rusa.
