 A '''treasurer''' is someone who looks after the money in a club, company, organization, association, or government.  
 
 The treasurer of a government manages the [[Annual]] [[Budget]] of a [[state]] or [[country]]. The budget is used to give money to government departments and to pay for the [[Debt|debts]] or promises the government makes. This post is called [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. There is a [[treasurer of the United States]], but the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] actually controls the department.
