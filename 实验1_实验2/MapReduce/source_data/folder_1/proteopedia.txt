 The site contains a page for every entry in the [[Protein Data Bank]] ( > 130,000 pages). Its pages are descriptive of protein structures in general such as [[acetylcholinesterase]], < ref name= " urlAcetylcholinesterase, life in 3D " > {{cite web |url = http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Acetylcholinesterase |title = Acetylcholinesterase |publisher = Proteopedia }} < /ref >  [[hemoglobin]], < ref name= " urlHemoglobin - Proteopedia, life in 3D " > {{cite web |url = http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hemoglobin |title = Hemoglobin |publisher = Proteopedia }} < /ref >  and the [[photosystem II]]. < ref name= " urlPhotosystem II - Proteopedia, life in 3D " > {{cite web |url = http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Photosystem_II |title = Photosystem II |publisher = Proteopedia}} < /ref >    
 
 It employs a scene-authoring tool: users do not have to learn JSmol script language to create customized molecular scenes. Custom scenes are easily attached to  " green links "  in descriptive text that display those scenes in JSmol.
