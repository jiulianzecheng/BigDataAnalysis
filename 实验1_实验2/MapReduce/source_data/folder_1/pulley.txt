 A '''pulley''' is a [[simple machine]] that is used to lift heavy objects. Block and tackle system is a modified form of a pulley. Pulleys are usually used in sets designed to make the amount of [[Force (physics)|force]] needed to lift something smaller.A pulley may be simple, but this is used in complex things like elevators! 
 
 ==Types of pulleys== 
 * '''Static''' A ''static'' or ''class 1'' pulley has an [[axle]] that is  " staticed "  or is stationary, meaning that it cannot be moved.  A fixed pulley is used to redirect the force in a rope (called a [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] when it goes in a full circle).  A fixed pulley has a [[mechanical advantage]] of 1. The static pulley has a [[wheel]] and an [[axle]]. 
 * '''Movable''' A ''movable'' or ''class 2'' pulley has an axle that is  " free "  to move in [[Space (physics)|space]].  A movable pulley is used to transform forces.  A movable pulley has a mechanical advantage of 2.  That is, if one end of the rope is anchored, pulling on the other end of the rope will apply a doubled force to the objecT attached to the pulley. 
 * '''Compound''' A ''compound pulley'' is a combination fixed and movable pulley system. 
 ** Block and tackle - A ''block and tackle'' is a compound pulley where several pulleys are mounted on each axle, further increasing the mechanical advantage.  [[Plutarch]] reported that [[Archimedes]] moved an entire warship, laden with men, using compound pulleys and his own strength. 
 Pulleys are useful in [[construction]] sites.
