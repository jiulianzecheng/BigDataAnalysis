 '''Hexaferrum''', also known as '''epsilon iron''', is a form of [[iron]] at very high [[pressure]]. Hexaferrum is often compared to [[cobalt]]. Hexaferrum is a (formula: Fe, Os, Ru, Ir) hexagonal-dihexagonal dipyramidal yellowish steel-gray mineral containing [[iridium]], iron, [[osmium]], and [[ruthenium]]. It was named for the crystal morphology, being in the Hexagonal system, and its composition, containing essential iron. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Cabri|first1=Louis J.|last2=Aiglsperger|first2=Thomas|date=June 2018|title=A review of hexaferrum based on new mineralogical data|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mineralogical-magazine/article/abs/review-of-hexaferrum-based-on-new-mineralogical-data/F6AA04FCE5163D52C9774D6D1CAD5D15|journal=Mineralogical Magazine|language=en|volume=82|issue=3|pages=531â€“538|doi=10.1180/mgm.2018.86|bibcode=2018MinM...82..531C|s2cid=133693481|issn=0026-461X}} < /ref >
