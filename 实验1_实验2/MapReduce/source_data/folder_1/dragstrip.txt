A '''dragstrip''' is a facility for conducting [[automobile]] and [[motorcycle]] acceleration events such as [[Drag Racing|drag racing]].  Although a '''quarter mile''' (402 m) is the best known measure for a drag track, many tracks are '''eighth mile''' (201 m) tracks. The race is begun from a [[standing start]]. Three factors decide the outcome of the race: reaction time, [[torque]], and traction. 
 
 ==Features== 
 A dragstrip is a straight [[racetrack]], usually an eighth or a quarter of a mile long (660/1320 feet, 201/402 metres), followed by a ''shutdown area'' to allow automobiles room to stop after crossing the finish line. Common features also include a 'water box' where cars and motorcycles start their [[burnout|burn-outs]] to clean and heat up their [[tires]] to improve traction. There is a set of lights known as a '[[Christmas tree (racing)|Christmas Tree]]' that counts down to the start. There are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area.
