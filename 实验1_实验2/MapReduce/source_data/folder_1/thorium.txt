'''Thorium''' is a [[chemical element]] in [[actinide]] group. It is a weakly [[radioactive]] [[metal]]. It has a shiny, silvery white color. It has the [[chemical symbol]] '''Th''' and the [[atomic number]] 90. Natural thorium has an [[atomic weight]] of 232. Thorium is named after [[Thor]], the Norse god of thunder. Its [[ore|ores]] are found in nature (that is, on Earth), especially in [[India]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].  
 
 Thorium would make a good source of [[nuclear fuel]] because it makes much less waste and is four times as common as [[uranium]]. It does not need the wasteful process of [[Uranium mining|enrichment]]. It makes 3,200,000 times as much energy as coal and 200 times as much energy as uranium. Scientists believe that there is enough of it to power the world for thousands of years. Thorium has been used for various purposes since the 19th century. It is an alloying agent in [[magnesium]] and is also used as an industrial [[Catalysis|catalyst]]. 
 
 Thorium is safer than [[uranium]]. This is because thorium cannot undergo nuclear fission on its own. Usually, [[plutonium]] is need to start and maintain a reaction. This is why thorium is considered better for [[Nuclear reactor|nuclear reactors]]. Also, nuclear waste from thorium reactors contains far smaller amounts of dangerous [[transuranic element]]s than waste from [[uranium]] reactors. < ref > Griffin H.C. 2010.
