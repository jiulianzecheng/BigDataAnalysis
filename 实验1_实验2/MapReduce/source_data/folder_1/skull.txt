 A '''skull''', or '''cranium''', is a set of [[bone]]s that make up the [[head]] of a [[vertebrate]] and keep in place all body parts in the head. < ref > [https://www.britannica.com/science/cephalization Cephalization definition from] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] < /ref >  It supports the structures of the [[face]] and forms a protective [[cavity]] for the [[brain]]. < ref > [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skull Definition of skull from] Merriam-Webster dictionary < /ref > 
 
 As well as protecting the brain, the skull fixes the distance between the eyes and between the ears. This allows [[stereoscopic vision]], and helps the brain judge direction and distance of sounds. In some animals, the skull also has a defensive function (e.g. horned [[ungulate]]s). The [[frontal bone]] is where horns are mounted. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Romer |first1=Alfred Sherwood |last2=Parsons |first2=Thomas S. |year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |url=https://archive.org/details/vertebratebody0000rome_a5a9 |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/vertebratebody0000rome_a5a9/page/173 173]–177 |isbn= 0-03-910284-X}} < /ref > < ref > [https://skull-action.com/collections/skull-rings skull rings] < /ref > 
 
 The skull is made of a number of joined (fused) flat bones. In [[human being|humans]], the adult skull is normally made up of 28 bones.
