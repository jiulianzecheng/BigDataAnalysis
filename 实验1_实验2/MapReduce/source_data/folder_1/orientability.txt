In the [[Euclidean space]], ''R < sup > 3 < /sup > '' is called '''orientable''' if a [[two-dimensional]] figure (for example, [[File:Small pie.svg|20px|link=]]) cannot be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own [[mirror]] image ([[File:Pie 2.svg|20px|link=]]). Otherwise the surface is '''non-orientable'''. A concept connected to this is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]. This means that no matter what, a human right [[hand]], cannot be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand. The right hand is therefore orientable.
