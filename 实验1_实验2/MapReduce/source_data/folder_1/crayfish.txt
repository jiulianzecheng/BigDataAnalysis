 '''Crayfish''' are [[crustacean]]s that are also known as crawdads, crawfish, kriddly wigs, and freshwater lobsters. < ref > {{cite journal |author=C. W.

There are about 150 crayfish species in North America, and over 540 species worldwide. 
 
 Most live in freshwater habitats such as rivers. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 The body of a [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]], such as a [[crab]], [[lobster]], or [[prawn]] ([[shrimp]]), is made up of twenty [[body segment]]s. They are grouped into two main body parts, the [[cephalothorax]] and the [[abdomen]]. Each segment may have one pair of [[appendage]]s. In some groups these may be reduced or missing. On average, crayfish grow to {{convert|17.5|cm|in}} in length, but some grow larger. Walking legs have a small claw at the end. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Crayfish live in [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[pond]]s, and other freshwater habitats. Most crayfish are strictly aquatic but some live in semi-aquatic environments. The semi-aquatic crayfish burrow into the soil to get to water (so that they can breathe). 
 Some can also be put in private aquarium to be used as pets 
 
 == Diet == 
 Crayfish are omnivores; they eat [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and decaying organisms. They are nocturnal (most active at night) and eat fish, shrimp, water plants, [[worm]]s, insects, [[snail]]s, and [[plankton]]. Larval crayfish are very tiny; they eat plankton. 
 
 == Name == 
 Crayfish might be sometimes be called crawfish in parts of the [[U.S.A.]]
