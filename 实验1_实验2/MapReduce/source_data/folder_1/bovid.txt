 '''Bovids''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[even-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]]s. < ref name=MSW3 >  Grubb P. 2005. Family Bovidae. In Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D.M (eds) ''Mammal Species of the World: a taxonomic and geographic reference''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 637â€“722. ISBN 978-0-8018-8221-0. OCLC 62265494. < /ref >  The word  " Bovidae "  is comes from [[Latin]] ''bos'',  " ox " . < ref name=mw > {{cite web|title=Bovidae|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bovidae|website=Merriam-Webster online dictionary|accessdate=7 October 2014}} < /ref >  Even-toed ungulates are said to have  " cloven [[hooves]] " : that means their hooves are formed from two toes. They evolved early in the [[Miocene]] period. 
 
 There 143 living [[species]] in this family. They include [[cattle]], [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and [[antelope]]s. The family is widespread, living in all continents except the southern continents [[South America]], [[Australia]] and [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 They are all [[ruminant]]s, with the double [[stomach]] system of digesting [[vegetation]], which is most efficient. The family originated in the [[Miocene]], and is now very successful. Their success is probably helped by their digestive system. The group includes the three [[domestic animals]] [[cows]], [[sheep]] and [[goats]].
