 An '''igloo'''  is a [[shelter]] (a place for people to stay warm and dry) made from blocks of [[snow]] placed on top of each other, often in the shape of a [[dome]] like half of a hollow ball. They were used in [[winter]] as temporary shelters by [[hunting|hunters]] when they were away from their regular homes. 
 
 They were most often built in places where a lot of snow covers the land for weeks or months at a time, such as the far north of [[Canada]] and [[Greenland]]. Most igloos are built by native [[Inuit]] people (sometimes called ''Eskimoes''). As they learned to build them better, sometimes people would build larger igloos that would last longer and hold more people, even for [[dance|dancing]].
