 The '''Sahara''', < ref > {{lang-ar|الصحراء الكبرى}}, aṣ-ṣaḥrā´ al-kubra,  " The Greatest Desert " < /ref >  in [[North Africa]], is the largest [[desert]] in the world except for [[Antarctica]]. The Sahara is the largest hot desert. 
 
 It is bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Atlas Mountains]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Red Sea]], and the [[Sahel]] region. It runs through many countries including [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], and The [[Sudan]]. Most parts are uninhabited, but some people manage to survive in places where there is water. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516375/Sahara |title=Sahara (desert, Africa) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |accessdate=4 May 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 The Sahara Desert is about 9,000,000 square kilometers (3.5 million square miles) in size. It has been both larger and smaller at different times. After the last [[ice age]] it became more [[fertile]], then dried up again. It is the hottest place on the Earth, but not the driest. The driest is the [[Atacama Desert]] in [[South America]]. The Sahara has about the same size as the whole [[United States]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2022-02-25|title=The Sahara: Earth's Largest Hot Desert|url=https://www.livescience.com/23140-sahara-desert.html|access-date=2023-09-21|website=livescience.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Climate == 
 The Sahara has one of the world's most harsh climates. Typically, the Sahara landscape experiences little rainfall, powerful winds and wide temperature ranges. In some areas, there can be no rainfall for years at a time. 
 
 In the summer, daytime air temperatures across the Sahara often reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In the winter the freezing temperatures may occur in the northern Sahara, and milder temperatures, across the southern Sahara. Snow may fall occasionally in some of the higher mountain ranges and rarely, on the desert floor. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.desertusa.com/du_sahara.html|title=The Sahara Desert: Location, Landscape, Water and Climate - DesertUSA|last=DesertUSA.com|website=www.desertusa.com|access-date=2018-03-04}} < /ref > 
 
 == Environment == 
 The highest mountain is 3415 m, and is the ''Emi Koussi'' in Chad. Some [[mountain]] peaks in the Sahara Desert have [[snow]] even in the [[summer]]. < ref name= " looklex " > {{Cite web |url=http://looklex.com/e.o/sahara.htm |title=Sahara - LookLex Encyclopaedia |work=looklex.com |accessdate=4 May 2010 |archive-date=16 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916201850/http://looklex.com/e.o/sahara.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.algeria.com/blog/snow-in-summer-algerias-hoggar-mountains|title=Snow in the Sahara|publisher=Algeria.com|accessdate=5 August 2010}} < /ref >  The main mountain ranges is the Atlas Mountains in Algeria. The Sahara's lowest point lies in the Qattara Depression in [[Egypt]], at about 130 [[metres]] below sea level. Sand sheets and [[dune]]s are about 25% of the Sahara. The other parts are mountains, [[steppe]]s with a lot of [[stone]]s, and oases. < ref name= " looklex " / > 
 
 Several rivers run through the Sahara. However, most of them come and go through the seasons, except for the [[Nile]] River and [[Niger River]]. < ref name= " looklex " / > 
 
 Metallic minerals are very important to most Saharan countries. Algeria and Mauritania have several major deposits of iron [[ore]].  There are also [[uranium]] mines, mostly in [[Niger]].  A lot of [[phosphate]]s are in Morocco and Western Sahara.  [[Petroleum]] is mainly found in Algeria, where it is very important to the economy.  While mineral exploitation has led to economic growth in Sahara, this has rarely helped the indigenous population, as skilled workers have been brought from other countries. 
 
 == Cities == 
 Of the Sahara's around 4 million people, most live in Mauritania, Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and Egypt.  Dominant groups of people are Sahrawis and [[Tuareg people]].  The largest city is [[Nouakchott]], Mauritania's capital.  Other important cities are Tamanrasset in Algeria, and Sebha and Ghat in Libya. 
 
 Only 200,000 & nbsp;km² of the Sahara are fertile oases, where [[date]]s, [[corn]], and [[fruit]]s are grown. The few fertile regions today are fed by underground rivers and underground basins. Many of Sahara's oases rests in depressions (areas under sea level) allowing water to surface from underground reservoirs; artesian [[well]]s. 
 
 The [[soil]] in Sahara is low in organic matter. The soil in depressions is often saline. 
 
 Other sorts of vegetation include scattered concentrations of grasses, shrubs and trees in the highlands, as well as in the oases and along river beds. Some plants are well adjusted to the climate, allowing them to germinate within 3 days of rain and sow their seeds within 2 weeks after that. 
 
 Animals living in the Sahara include gerbil, jerboa, cape hare and desert [[hedgehog]], barbary [[sheep]], oryx, gazelle, [[deer]], wild ass, baboon, hyena, jackal, sand fox, weasel and mongoose. The bird life counts more than 300 species. Reptiles, including 4 species of [[snake]] also live here.  The most venomous [[scorpion]] in the world lives here. 
 
 4,000 years ago, the Sahara was a thriving [[savanna]] [[grassland]] with a great variety of wildlife.  This included animals such as [[elephants]] and [[giraffes]].  [[Climate change]] has caused the rainfall to be less and turn the Sahara into the barren, desert wilderness as we know it today.
