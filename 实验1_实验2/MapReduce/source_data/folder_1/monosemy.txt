'''Monosemy''' is when the words in a [[language]] each have only one meaning.  Most [[Natural language|natural]] human languages are polysemous: words each have more than one meaning.  The [[Constructed language|constructed languages]] [[Lojban]] and Loglan were created to be monosemous.  Monosemy is helpful for machine [[translation]].
