 '''Bern''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Berne'', [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Berna,'' [[Romansh language|Romansh]]: ''Berna'', Bernese German: ''Bärn'') is the [[capital (city)|capital]] [[city]] of [[Switzerland]]. It is also the capital of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Bern (canton)|Bern]]. 
 
 As of early 2006, 127.000 people lived in the city. 
 
 == History == 
 Bern was started in 1191 by [[Berchthold V. von Zähringen]]. A [[legend]] says that he said he would name the city after the [[next]] animal he caught. So when he caught a [[bear]] ([[German language|German]]:  " Bär " ) the city was named Bern. Zähringen built the city in the half-[[circle]] the [[river Aare]] makes. 
 
 == Traffic == 
 [[:wikt:public|Public]] [[streetcar]]s and [[bus]]es are run by an [[organization]] called BernMobil. There are 3 streetcar lines and about 15 bus lines. Most of the lines are in the city but some travel away from the city. There is also the Marzilibahn, a [[funicular]] (inclined- or cliff-[[railway]]) which goes from the [[coast|banks]] of the Aare up to the [[Federal Building]] (German:  " Bundeshaus " ). The Marzilibahn is 105 [[metre|meters]] long. It is the shortest funicular in Europe. Another funicular, called the Gurtenbahn, goes from the section of Bern called Wabern, which is on the river Aare, up to the top of [[Gurten]], a large hill 585 meters high that is just south of Bern. A small [[airport]], Belpmoos, is located a short distance south of Bern in [[Belp]]. 
 
 == Folk Festivals == 
 === Zibelemärit (onion market) === 
 Each year, on the 4th Monday in November, there is the [[Onion Market]] in Bern, where onions are sold. Many people visit the [[market]] in the early morning and throw [[confetti]]. They also hit other people with [[hammer]]s made out of [[plastic]] 
 
 === Aareleuchten (glowing Aare) === 
 Since 1996,  every August 1 (a [[nation]]al [[holiday]] in Switzerland) they hold the Aareleuchten. The Aareleuchten is paid for by [[SwissAid]]. During the [[festival]], people put small ships with a light in them into the river Aare. All of these small lights make the Aare  " glow. "
