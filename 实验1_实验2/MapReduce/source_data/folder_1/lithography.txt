 '''Lithography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''λίθος'' - ''lithos'', 'stone' + ''γράφω'' - ''graphο'', 'to write') is a method for [[printing]] using a stone (lithographic [[limestone]]) or a metal ([[steel]] or [[aluminium]]) plate with a completely smooth surface. 
 
 Lithography was invented in 1796 by Bavarian author [[Alois Senefelder]] as a low-cost method of publishing [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[Poster|posters]]. < ref name= " meggspage146 " > Meggs, Philip B. 1988.

 ==Introduction== 
 Lithography used an image drawn in [[wax]] or other [[oil]]y substance applied to a lithographic stone as the medium to transfer [[ink]] to the printed sheet. In modern times, the image is often made of [[polymer]] applied to a flexible aluminium plate. 
 
 The flat surface of the plate or stone is slightly roughened, or etched, and divided into [[hydrophilic]] (water-loving) regions that accept a film of water and repel the greasy ink, and [[hydrophobic]] regions which repel water and accept ink. The image may be printed directly from the stone or plate (in which case it is reversed from the original image) or may be [[Offset printing|offset]] by transfer to a flexible sheet, usually [[Rubber|rubber,]] for transfer to the printed article. 
 
 This process is different from [[gravure]] or [[intaglio]] [[printing]] where a plate is [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]] or [[stipple]]d to make cavities to contain the printing ink, and in [[woodblock]] printing and [[letterpress]] where ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. 
 
 In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name  " lithography " — " lithos "  (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and avoided the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite. 
 
 == Chromolithography == 
 '''Chromolithography''' (colour lithography) was invented by Engelmann and son, who were granted a patent in 1837. < ref > Twyman, Michael 1970.''Lithography 1800–1850''. Oxford University Press. p160 < /ref >  After that, it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development. 
 
 By using more than one stone, different colours can be added to the same picture. Each colour needs a separate stone. The great posters of such artists as [[Alphonse Mucha]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] are made like this. Complicated graphics may need twenty or more stones. < ref > “Chromolithography.” ''Beautiful Birds Exhibit''.1999.
