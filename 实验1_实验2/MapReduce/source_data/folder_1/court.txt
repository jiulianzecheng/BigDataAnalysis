 A '''court''', in [[law]], is a part of the [[government]] in which people come together to decide how to apply the country's laws to a specific situation, especially when there is an argument over how to apply the law. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is [[guilty]] of a [[crime]], who is the [[legal]] owner of property, or who the [[child]]ren of two [[divorce]]d [[parent]]s should live with. The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is commonly known as the [[judiciary]]. A court is usually located in a special building called a [[courthouse]]. 
 
 Most countries have multiple courts to deal with different issues.  For example, [[civil law|civil]] courts deal with private disputes between people or organizations, while [[criminal law|criminal]] courts deal with people who have been accused of crimes.
