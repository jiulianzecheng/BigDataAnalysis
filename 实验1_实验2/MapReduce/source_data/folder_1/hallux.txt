 The '''hallux''', also called the '''big toe''', is the [[toe]] innermost (closest to the middle of the body) of the [[foot]]. It is usually the biggest toe in the body.  
 
 In humans, the hallux is longer than the toes next to it; this is [[Mendelian inheritance|inherited]]. Humans are unusual amongst [[hominid]]s in walking upright, and their feet are [[adapted]] to their locomotion. 
 
 In other animals the foot is organised differently. [[Mammals]] usually move on four legs with [[paw]]s. In some [[bird]]s, the hallux is pointed backwards: it helps to [[wikt:grab|grip]].
