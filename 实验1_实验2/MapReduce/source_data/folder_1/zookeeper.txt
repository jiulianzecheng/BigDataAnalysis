A '''zookeeper''' is a worker in a [[zoo]], responsible for the feeding and daily care of the [[animal]]s. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in [[Research|scientific research]], and in [[public education]], conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public. 
 
 Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant [[academic degree|college degree]] and extensive experience. 
 
 Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times.
