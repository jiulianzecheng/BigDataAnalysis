 '''Salmon''' is a kind of [[teleost]] [[fish]]. It is a general term for  commercially important ray-finned fish from the family [[Salmonidae]]. Salmon belong to the same family of fish as the [[trout]].  
 
 Most kinds of salmon live in [[salt water]], or migrate between [[river]]s and the sea. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Why do some fish normally live in freshwater and others in saltwater? How can some fish adapt to both?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-some-fish-normally/|access-date=2021-05-07|website=Scientific American|language=en}} < /ref >  Many people like to eat salmon, so sometimes the fish is grown in [[fish farm]]s.  
 
 As the salmon go upstream to the spawning grounds, they may face obstruction from [[beaver]] dams. [[Sluice gate]]s have to be provided so the gravid female salmon can get to the spawning grounds. This is a problem caused by the re-introduction of beavers to the U.K. Sluice gates are opened for the salmon at breeding time. Salmon farms are also possible, in which the fish are non-migratory, but then they have to be fed artificially. 
 
 == Coloring == 
 Salmons get the pink color of their flesh from a pigment called [[astaxanthin]]. Wild salmon get it from the [[krill]] and [[shrimp]] they eat, while farmed salmon gets traces of it in kibble (compound feed). If they don't have the pigment, their flesh has a gray color. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Salmon a hit health food in Japan|url=https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/food-safety-health/salmon-a-hit-health-food-in-japan|access-date=2021-05-07|website=www.seafoodsource.com}} < /ref >
