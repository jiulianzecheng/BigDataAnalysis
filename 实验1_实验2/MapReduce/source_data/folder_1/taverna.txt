 A '''taverna''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ταβέρνα) is a small Greek [[restaurant]] that serves [[Greek food]]. It is an important part of Greek [[culture]]. The taverna has become familiar to foreign visitors to [[Greece]] and through the building of '''tavernes''' ({{lang-gr|ταβέρνες}}, plural) in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] by [[Greek people|Greeks]]. 
 
 ==Name== 
 The word ''taverna'' ({{lang-gr|ταβέρνα}}) is borrowed from the [[Latin]] word ''taberna'' meaning “[[shop]]” or  " [[inn]] " . < ref > {{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|year=2001–2023|title=tavern|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/tavern}} < /ref >   
 
 ==History== 
 The earliest Greek restaurant was discovered in ancient [[Athens]] by [[archaeologist]]s in the early 1970s. < ref name=Shear > {{harvnb|Shear|1975|pp=356–357}}. < /ref >  Large amounts of cooking and eating [[utensil]]s were found at the taverna like [[plate]]s, mixing [[bowl]]s, lidded [[casserole]]s, spits for broiling [[meat]], [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]]s for chopping and grinding along with a cooking [[bell]] and many different jugs. < ref name=Shear/ >  Large amounts of [[seafood]] were also found like [[oysters]], [[mussels]], murex, and large [[fish]]. < ref name=Shear/ >  A nearby [[wine]] shop, maybe connected to the restaurant, served local [[Attica|Attic]] wine and many other wines [[import]]ed from [[Chios]], Mende, [[Corinth]], [[Samos]] and [[Lesbos]]. < ref name=Shear/ > 
 
 There were also shops serving wine in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. < ref name=Dalby > ''Book of the Eparch'', 19 (quoted in {{harvnb|Dalby|1996|loc= " Biscuits from Byzantium " , p. 196}}). < /ref >  This is known from a 10th-century Byzantine [[curfew]] meant to prevent drunken  " violence and rioting " . < ref name=Dalby/ >
