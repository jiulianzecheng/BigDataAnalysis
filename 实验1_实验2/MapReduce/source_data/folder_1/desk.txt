 A '''desk''' is a piece of [[furniture]] where someone can sit and write, often with drawers or other places to put books, papers, pencils, pens and other things. Unlike a [[Table (furniture)|table]], there is only one side of the desk where somebody could [[sit]]. 
 
 Desks come in many different [[size]]s. There is a [[Armoire desk]], which is very big. There is also a [[portable desk]] which is very small. Desks can be used at [[home]]. They can also be used in an [[office]]. Desks may also be used in [[school]]s. 
 
 A [[computer desk]] will have a [[computer]] inside or on top. The [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] and [[mouse]] will pull out from underneath the desk.
