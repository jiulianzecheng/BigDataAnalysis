 Ōtoshi, also known as Ōtoshi-no-kami or Nigihayahi-no-mikoto, is a deity in the Shinto religion of Japan. Often referred to as Toshigami or Ōtoshi-no-kami, this god is associated with the passage of time and is often considered as the  " Year God "  or the  " Great-Year God "  due to their connection with the changing of years in Japanese traditions.
