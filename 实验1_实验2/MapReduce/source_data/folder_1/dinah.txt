[[Dinah]] was a [[person]] from the [[Book of Genesis]] who was the [[daughter]] of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]]. After [[Shechem]] [[kidnap]]ped her, brought her to his hometown and [[rape]]d her, he wanted to marry her. So Shechem’s [[father]], a [[king]] named [[Hamor]] asked Jacob what it would take for Shechem to marry Dinah. Jacob asked his sons what to do about what had happened and they told him to tell Hamor that the [[daughter]]s of [[Israel]] would never marry the [[men]] of Shechem unless they agreed to [[circumcision]]. Then the [[men]] of Shechem actually circumcised themselves. Then Shechem married Dinah.  Then three days later, [[Simeon]] and [[Levi]], [[kill]]ed all [[adult]] [[male]]s in Shechem as [[revenge]] for the [[rape]] of Dinah. When Jacob was worried that the [[Canaan]]ites would [[kill]] them for that and was angry with Simeon and Levi because of it, they asked him “shall our [[sister]] be treated as a [[whore]].”
