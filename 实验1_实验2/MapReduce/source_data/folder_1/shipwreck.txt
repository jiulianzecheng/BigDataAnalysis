 [[History|Historic]] wrecks are attractive to [[marine archaeologist]]s because they preserve historical information. For [[example]], studying the wreck of ''[[Mary Rose]]'' revealed information about seafaring, warfare, and life in the 16th century. Military wrecks, caused by a [[battle]] at sea, are studied to find details about the historic events. They can reveal much about the battle that occurred. Once in a while there is a discovery of a [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure ship]], often from the period of European [[colonisation]]. Some [[wikt:contemporary|contemporary]] wrecks, such as the oil tankers [[Prestige oil spill|''Prestige'']] or [[Erika (tanker)|''Erika'']], are of interest because of their potential harm to the [[environment]]. Other contemporary wrecks are [[Scuttling|scuttled]] (sank deliberately) in order to create [[reef]] growth. 
 
 == Famous shipwrecks == 
 
 Some very famous shipwrecks include the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']], [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']], [[SS Andrea Doria|SS ''Andrea Doria'']], [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald|SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']] or the ''[[Costa Concordia]]''.  There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been [[wikt:abandoned|abandoned]] or [[wikt:sunk|sunk]]. These abandoned, or derelict ships are typically smaller craft, such as fishing vessels. They sometimes pose a [[hazard]] to [[navigation]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Wrecks and Obstructions Database|url=http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/wrecks_and_obstructions.html?utm_source=Discovery+Diving+Newz+%26+Trivia & utm_campaign=Newz+March+19%2C+2015 & utm_medium=email|website=NOAA|access-date=2015-12-11|archive-date=2016-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113634/http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/wrecks_and_obstructions.html?utm_source=Discovery+Diving+Newz+%26+Trivia & utm_campaign=Newz+March+19,+2015 & utm_medium=email|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
