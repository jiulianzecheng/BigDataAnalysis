A '''hysterectomy''' is [[surgery]] to remove the [[womb]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-benign|title=RCPA - Uterus benign|website=www.rcpa.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-21|archive-date=2018-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606031908/http://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-benign|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This is usually done by a [[gynecologist]].  
 Women who undergo a hysterectomy can no longer bear children. Hysterectomies are done for certain forms of [[cancer]] of the reproductive system (affecting womb, [[cervix]], [[ovary|ovaries]]), or [[tumor]]s. 
 
 A woman may have her uterus removed because she has a tumor. A tumor can be cancer. Another type of tumor can be benign. The uterus may be removed because organs in the pelvic area have moved down. When organs move, the uterus may move down, too. A hysterectomy may be able to fix this problem. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-endometrial-and-myometrial-malignancies|title=RCPA - Uterus endometrial and myometrial malignancies|website=www.rcpa.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-21|archive-date=2017-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629040151/http://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-endometrial-and-myometrial-malignancies|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  A hysterectomy can be done for other reasons.
