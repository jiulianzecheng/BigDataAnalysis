 '''Sobek''' was the ancient [[Egypt]]ian god of the [[Nile]]. In [[art]], he was shown with the head of a [[crocodile]]. In temples to Sobek, live crocodiles were kept in pools to honor him. 
 
 == Jobs  &  Roles == 
 
 Sobek was worshipped wherever the Nile was presenting difficulties. Sobek was the ancient Egyptian god of crocodiles and controlled the waters. Sobek’s role was to protect the pharaoh from evil but it differs with each person. He was the most popular god in Arsinoe (Crocodilopolis in Greek), and was considered the Lord of Faiyu (a place in Egypt). 
 
 == Myths  &  stories == 
   
 One day when Sobek was in the Nile, he saw [[Osiris]]’ (who was murdered by [[Seth|Set]], the god of chaos) body. He was so hungry he could not resist eating part of it. His tongue was cut off as a punishment, which is why crocodiles have no tongues in Egyptian myths. He also caught the sons of [[Horus]] when they were born. 
 
 == Physical Appearance ==  
 Sobek was seen as a crocodile headed man or very rarely a plain crocodile. Egyptians mummified crocodiles in honor of Sobek. Crocodiles were treated like household pets and were adorned with anklets and other decorative jewels. In temples people kept sacred crocodiles because they thought that they were images of Sobek on earth. The sacred crocodiles were a big attraction, the Egyptian’s believed that if the crocodiles were fed and they accepted their food, you would receive blessings from the God Sobek. 
 
 == Family  &  friends == 
   
 Sobek was a friend of [[Horus]]. Sobek’s mother [[Neith]] was considered the sister of [[Isis]], who was [[Horus]]’s mother. This made Sobek the cousin of [[Horus]], which was a very important fact because [[Horus]] was a major God. In other myths, Sobek was allied with [[Seth|Set]]. [[Seth|Set]] was also sometimes thought of as Sobek's father.
