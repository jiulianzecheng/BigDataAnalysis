 '''Gospel''' originally meant the Christian message ( " the gospel " ), but in the 2nd century it came to be used also for the books in which the message was set out. 
 
 The word gospel came from the Old English word  " gōdspel " , which literally means  " good news " , < ref > {{Cite web|url = https://www.google.com/#safe=active & q=gospel+etymology|title = gospel etymology|first = |last = |website = |publisher = |accessdate = }} < /ref >  since it narrates [[Jesus Christ]]'s life and teaching to invite anyone to believe that he was born to [[Salvation (Christianity)|save]] the world from [[sin]] and make [[humans]] truly know [[God]] as a Father. It includes the [[Substitutionary atonement|Death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of Jesus. 
 
 The Gospel was originally [[Oral tradition|spoken]], not [[Writing|written]]. Eventually gospel came to mean an ancient book about Jesus, especially one of the four books collected by the [[Church]] in the [[Bible]].  
 
 These books are the first part of the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, and are put in a group of this order: the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the [[Gospel of Mark]], the [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Gospel of John]]. 
 
 " Injil "  ([[Arabic]]: إنجيل) is the Arabic name for the Gospel of Jesus (Isa). In [[Islam]], Jesus is believed to be the second-to-last prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and the [[Messiah]]. Muslims believe that God revealed the Injil to Jesus, while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: the Tawrat (the [[Torah]]) and the Zabur (the [[Psalms]]).
