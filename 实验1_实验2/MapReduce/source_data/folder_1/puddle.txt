 A '''puddle''' is a small mass of [[liquid]], usually [[water]], uncontained on a surface. It can form either in depressions in the surface, or directly upon the flat surface, held together by [[surface tension]]. A puddle is generally considered to be small enough to step over or shallow enough to walk through, and too small to traverse with a [[boat]].  
 
 Puddles commonly form during [[rain]]storms, and can cause problems for transport, especially when combined with cold conditions to form patches of [[ice]], which are highly slippery and difficult to see.
