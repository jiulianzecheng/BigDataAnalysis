 A '''transglutaminase''' is an [[enzyme]] that forms a [[chemical bond]] between two [[protein]] [[molecule]]s. The [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] also produces a molecule of [[ammonia]]. Transglutaminases were first described in 1959. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Clarke DD, Mycek MJ, Neidle A, Waelsch H|title=The incorporation of amines into proteins| journal=Arch Biochem Biophys| year=1959| volume=79| pages=338–354 | doi=10.1016/0003-9861(59)90413-8}} < /ref >  In 1968 it was discovered they form a role in [[coagulation|blood coagulation]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Pisano JJ, Finlayson JS, Peyton MP |title=[Cross-link in fibrin polymerized by factor 13: epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine.] |journal=Science |volume=160 |issue=3830 |pages=892–3 |year=1968 |pmid=4967475 |doi=10.1126/science.160.3830.892|s2cid=95459438 }} < /ref > 
 
 Transglutaminase have many uses. They can be used as a [[chemical bond|binding agent]] to improve the [[texture]] of protein-rich foods such as [[surimi]] or [[ham]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Yokoyama K, Nio N, Kikuchi Y |title=Properties and applications of microbial transglutaminase |journal=Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=447–54 |year=2004 |pmid=14740191 |doi=10.1007/s00253-003-1539-5|s2cid=19068193 }} < /ref >  Other examples of foods made using transglutaminase include [[imitation crabmeat]], and [[fish ball]]s.
