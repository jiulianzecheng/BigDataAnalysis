 '''Acryl''' is a name for a number of [[chemical compound]]s that have an '''acrylic group''', or of [[polymer]]s of these compounds. Especially [[ester]]s of '''acrylic acid''' are used to help make certain [[dye]]s and [[paint]]s or as [[adhesive]]s. 
 
 In [[organic chemistry]], the '''acryloyl group''' is the [[functional group]] with structure [[Hydrogen|H]] < sub > 2 < /sub > [[Carbon|C]]=CH–C(=[[Oxygen|O]])–; it is the [[acyl]] group derived from acrylic acid. The preferred [[IUPAC]] name for the group is '''prop-2-enoyl'''. It is also (less correctly) known as '''acrylyl''' or simply '''acryl'''. Compounds containing an acryloyl group can be referred to as  " acrylic compounds " . 
 
 An acrylic compound is typically an [[Carbonyl#α,β-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds|α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound]]: it contains a carbon–carbon [[covalent bond|double bond]] and a carbon–oxygen double bond, separated by a carbon–carbon single bond. It has therefore the properties characteristic for both functional groups :  
 * at the C=C bond: [[electrophilic addition]] of acids and halogens, hydrogenation, hydroxylation and cleavage of the bond 
 * at the C=O bond: [[nucleophilic substitution]] (such as in [[ester]]s) or [[nucleophilic addition]] (such as in [[ketone]]s). The [[carboxyl group]] of acrylic acid can react with [[ammonia]] to form acrylamide, or with an [[alcohol]] to form an acrylate [[ester]].  
 
 In addition, since both double bonds are separated by a single C–C bond, the double bonds are [[Conjugated system|conjugated]].
