'''Hassium''' is a very radioactive and unstable [[chemical element]]. It has the symbol '''Hs''' and it has the [[atomic number]] 108. It is a superheavy [[transuranium element]]. 
 
 Hassium is a [[radioactive]] element that does not exist in nature. It has to be [[synthetic element|made]] in a lab. 
 
 == History == 
 Hassium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first made]] in [[1984]]. and '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-osmium'''. It was made at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]. The element was named from the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] name for the German state of [[Hessen]]. Hessen is the state that the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung is in. Before it was named Hassium, [[scientist]]s could not decide what the name should be and there was an [[element naming controversy]]. The temporary [[IUPAC]] [[systematic element name]] was ''unniloctium'' meaning  " one-zero-eight-ium "  referring to its atomic number. The symbol with the name was ''Uno''. In [[1994]] a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 108 be named ''hahnium''. The name hassium was adopted internationally in [[1997]]. 
 
 == Chemistry == 
 [[Isotope]] 270 of Hassium was found in December 2006. An international team of scientists led by the [[Technical University of Munich]] discovered it. It is a [[magic number (physics)#Doubly magic|doubly magic]] isotope and it has a long [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of 22 seconds. Scientists had thought that heavy and stable isotopes should exist. Some [[theory|theories]] said Hassium-270 may be part of an [[island of stability]]. < ref name= " Focus " > {{cite journal|url=http://focus.aps.org/story/v18/st19|title= " A Nuclear Magic Trick " |accessdate=2006-12-25|author=Mason Inman|date=2006-12-14|journal=Physical Review Focus|volume=18 }} < /ref >  Hassium can [[oxidation|oxidise]] like [[osmium]], the element above it in the [[periodic table]], into [[hassium tetroxide]].
