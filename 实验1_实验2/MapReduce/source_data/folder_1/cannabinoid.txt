[[File:Kolkata-Kut.jpg|thumb|215x215px|Cannabinoids are found in cannabis plants like this one. ]] 
 A '''cannabinoid''' is a [[Chemical substance|chemical]] found in the [[cannabis]] (marijuana) [[plant]]. There are 113 cannabinoids that scientists know of, but there are likely more. Two of the best known cannabinoids are [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and [[cannabidiol]] (CBD). THC is a [[psychoactive drug]], meaning it can make you feel and think differently. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/marijuana|title=Marijuana|website=www.dea.gov|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  Not all cannabinoids are psychoactive and each one works differently. All cannabinoids share a similar [[Chemical composition|chemical structure]] and are [[Researcher|researched]] for treating [[Disease|diseases]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last=Atakan|first=Zerrin|date=December 2012|title=Cannabis, a complex plant: different compounds and different effects on individuals|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology|volume=2|issue=6|pages=241–254|doi=10.1177/2045125312457586|issn=2045-1253|pmc=3736954|pmid=23983983}} < /ref > 
 
 == Receptors in the body == 
 Cannabinoids work by connecting, or binding, to [[Receptor (cell biology)|receptors]] in the [[body]]. These receptors make up a [[system]] called the endocannabinoid system (ECS). There are two types of receptors: CB < sub > 1 < /sub >  (cannabinoid receptor type 1) and CB < sub > 2 < /sub >  (cannabinoid receptor type 2). CB < sub > 1 < /sub >  receptors are mostly found in the [[central nervous system]], which is made up of the [[brain]] and [[spine]]. It is also found in other places in the body like [[Sex organ|sex organs]]. CB < sub > 2 < /sub >  is found in the [[peripheral nervous system]] in other parts of the body. CB < sub > 2 < /sub >  receptors are found in the [[immune system]], which is the system that prevents us from getting [[Disease|sick]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >

 == Phytocannabinoids == 
 Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that are found naturally in the cannabis plant are affected by [[light]]. They are different than [[Synthetic cannabis|synthetic cannabinoids]] that are made in a [[laboratory]] (lab). When exposed to light, phytocannabinoids can change their [[Chemical composition|chemical structure]] and turn into other cannabinoids.  
 
 == Synthetic cannabinoids == 
 Synthetic cannabinoids are cannabinoids that are [[man-made]] in labs. They are used as a drug for research purposes and do not work the same way that natural cannabinoids do. Synthetic cannabinoids are also known as  " K2 "  and  " spice " . People who have taken synthetic cannabinoids as a drug have gotten very sick and some have died. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/taxonomy/term/606|title=Spice/K2, Synthetic Marijuana {{!}} DEA|website=www.dea.gov|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632261920/d-c-has-had-more-than-300-suspected-k2-overdoses-in-2-weeks|title=America's Synthetic Marijuana Overdose Crisis, Explained|website=NPR.org|date=27 July 2018|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27|last1=Peñaloza|first1=Marisa}} < /ref > 
 
 == Pharmacology == 
 Cannabinoids are [[Fat|fatty]] and [[Oil|oily]] chemicals that can connect to fat cells in our bodies. This is why it takes a long time to pass a drug test after using marijuana. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/drug-testing/|title=Drug Testing: MedlinePlus Medical Test|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  The  " high "  feeling that people get when using marijuana depends on if they [[Cigarette|smoke]] a marijuana cigarette ( " joint " ), [[Vaporizer (cannabis)|vape]] cannabis oils, < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/documents/2019/10/11/vaping-and-marijuana-concentrates-what-vaping|title=Vaping and Marijuana Concentrates: What is Vaping?|website=www.dea.gov|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  or eat food with cannabis in it. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://easyread.drugabuse.gov/content/marijuana-weed-pot-facts|title=Marijuana (Weed, Pot) Facts|date=2015-06-11|website=Easy Read|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana|title=Marijuana DrugFacts|last=Abuse|first=National Institute on Drug|date=2019-12-24|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  Most people feel high for a few hours after using cannabis.

 == Medicinal use == 
 Some medicines, like [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|Marinol]] (dronabinol), are carefully made in a lab to help sick people. THC is used to help [[nausea]] for people getting [[chemotherapy]]. CBD can help people with [[epilepsy]] who get [[Seizure|seizures]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://easyread.drugabuse.gov/content/what-medical-marijuana|title=What is medical marijuana?|date=2016-11-14|website=Easy Read|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cannabis-pdq|title=Cannabis and Cannabinoids (PDQ®)–Patient Version - National Cancer Institute|date=2011-10-24|website=www.cancer.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/marijuana.html|title=Marijuana|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  In places, where it is legal, medical marijuana is grown carefully and sold in stores called dispensaries.   
 
 == Legality == 
 The legality of cannabinoids is different around the world. Many first-world nations have passed laws for people to use marijuana to treat their diseases known as medical marijuana as well as allowing recreational use for adults. Using of having marijuana can be illegal in other countries and be punished with [[Fine|fines]], time in [[Prison|jail]], or the [[death penalty]]. In the United States, psychoactive cannabinoids are illegal on the federal level, but many states have passed laws that allow people to have, use, and grow marijuana. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Haug|first1=Nancy A.|last2=Padula|first2=Claudia B.|last3=Sottile|first3=James E.|last4=Vandrey|first4=Ryan|last5=Heinz|first5=Adrienne J.|last6=Bonn-Miller|first6=Marcel O.|date=September 2017|title=Cannabis Use Patterns and Motives: A Comparison of Younger, Middle-Aged, and Older Medical Cannabis Dispensary Patients|journal=Addictive Behaviors|volume=72|pages=14–20|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.03.006|issn=0306-4603|pmc=5492936|pmid=28340421}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling|title=Drug Scheduling|website=www.dea.gov|access-date=2020-06-27}} < /ref >  CBD is popular in the U.S. because it is not psychoactive and can be sent in the [[mail]].  
 
 == History == 
 Cannabis has been used for thousands of years. CBD was discovered in 1940. THC was discovered in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Yechiel Gaoni in Israel. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Gaoni|first1=Y.|last2=Mechoulam|first2=R.|date=1964-04-01|title=Isolation, Structure, and Partial Synthesis of an Active Constituent of Hashish|url=https://doi.org/10.1021/ja01062a046|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=86|issue=8|pages=1646–1647|doi=10.1021/ja01062a046|issn=0002-7863}} < /ref >
