 In the comic book universe, Deadpool was mostly considered neutral and sometimes even evil, but near the end of the series he was proved to be a good person. He tried really hard to fight his own psychotic mind behaviour and stop killing people. He got married with a person that cared for him and had a daughter. He made friends with an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and by himself destroyed a whole evil army that was trying to kill his family. In the end, on a vacation with his family and friends, Deadpool hugged his daughter as a second earth came crashing down from the sky, presumably killing him and his family and friends, along with many lives on earth, joining up the story with Secret Wars. 
 
 However, Deadpool is seen again in the preview of All-new All-different Marvel, confirming his return. 
 
 {{cquote|He combines the Punisher’s ruthlessness, Spider-Man’s gift of gab, Wolverine’s healing factor, and the Thing’s self-loathing.  And deep-down he’s a regular dude that likes, pizza and porn, tacos and Tecate, so readers can relate.”|4=Axel Alonso, Executive Editor, Marvel Comics  < ref name=newsrama/ > }}
