 '''''Fruitadens''''' is a genus of [[heterodontosaur]] [[dinosaur]].  
 
 The name means  " Fruita tooth " , in reference to [[Fruita]], [[Colorado]], where its fossils were first found. It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals from rocks of the [[Morrison Formation]] in [[Colorado]]. ''Fruitadens'' is a small [[ornithischia]]n dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) in length and 0.5 to 0.75 kg (1.1 to 1.7 lb) in weight.  
 
 The lower jaws had an enlarged [[canine]]-like tooth, opposite a gap in the upper jaw (a '[[diastema]]'). Unlike ''Echinodon'', there wasn't an enlarged tooth in the upper jaw. A small peg-like tooth was present in front of the canine-like tooth. Replacement teeth were present in the jaws, unlike most other heterodontosaurids. ''Fruitadens'' was an omnivore.
