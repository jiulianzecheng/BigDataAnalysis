 '''''Machaeroides''''' ( " dagger-like " ) was a [[genus]] of sabre-toothed [[creodont]]s which lived during the [[Eocene]] (56 to 34 mya). Its fossils were found in the [[U.S.]] state of [[Wyoming]]. It is the earliest known sabre-toothed mammal.  
 
 It looked like a small, dog-sized [[saber-toothed cat]]. ''Machaeroides'' had a longer skull than a [[feliformia|cat-family animal]], and it walked [[plantigrade]], with its palms and heels on the ground, instead of on its toes like a cat or dog. 
 
 The long survival of these small animals shows that their killing method suited small cats as well as large cats.
