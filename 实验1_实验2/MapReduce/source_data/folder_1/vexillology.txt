 '''Vexillology''' is the study of [[flag]]s.  The word comes from both the [[Latin]] word ''vexilla''  " little sail "  for flag plus the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] suffix''-ology'' that means  " study of " .  The ''vexillum'' was a particular kind of flag used by the [[Roman legion]]s.  Vexillology is a kind of study of [[symbol]]s related to [[heraldry]].  A person who studies flags is a ''vexillologist'', and a person who designs flags is a ''vexillographer''. 
 
 Because they are flown outside, where they move with the wind, flags are usually designed with bold images and bright, basic colors.  Flag design also follows a historical process, where later flag designs are based on earlier flag designs.  This means that many flags in an area may look similar because they are all based on one historical flag.  Examples include the [[Pan-African colors]], [[Pan-Arab colors]], and the [[Nordic Cross]].

 ==Flag Identification System (FIS)== 
 
 The ''Flag Identification System'' was created by [[Whitney Smith]] and adopted by Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques (FIAV). 
 
 The first row is for use on land and the second row is for use on water, each divided into private (civil), government (state), and military (war) use.
