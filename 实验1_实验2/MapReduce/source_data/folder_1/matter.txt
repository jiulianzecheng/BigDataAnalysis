 '''Matter''' is the [[substance]] of which all [[material]] is made. That means [[physical body|objects]] which have [[mass]]. More specifically, they must have [[rest mass|''rest'' mass]], which is a form of energy that matter has even when it is not moving (it has no [[kinetic energy]]), is extremely cold (it has no [[thermal energy]]), etc. ''Matter'' is a word that is sometimes used in varying ways in everyday life, whereas ''mass'' is a well-defined [[concept]] and quantity at least in [[physics]]. They are not the same thing, though they are related. < ref name= " inertia " > Here we ignore that all matter can have its rest mass converted to other forms of [[energy]] (a form of the [[mass-energy equivalence]]) by the famous [[formula]] ''E = mc < sup > 2 < /sup > '', where ''E'' is the energy of a mass ''m'' (in this case, rest mass), times ''c < sup > 2 < /sup > '' the [[speed of light]] squared. A relatively small amount of matter (i.e. having a small rest mass) may be converted to a large amount other forms of energy that can be released, such as kinetic energy (the energy of motion) and electromagnetic radiation. An example is that [[positron]]s and electrons (matter) may transform into photons (non-matter). However, although matter may be created (if other forms of energy are converted to rest mass) or destroyed (if the rest mass is converted to other energy forms) in such processes, the total quantity of energy does not change during the process, although some of it can be released or  " escape "  from the original location of the matter.

 ''Ordinary'' matter is made of tiny [[particle]]s called [[atoms]]. The atoms have spaces between them and they move or [[vibration|vibrate]] all the time. The particles move faster and move further apart when heated, and then reverse when cooled. 
 
 == Baryonic matter == 
 Nearly all matter that may be experienced in everyday life is [[baryon]]ic matter. This includes [[atom]]s of any sort, and gives those the property of mass. Non-baryonic matter, as implied by the name, is any sort of matter that is not composed mainly of baryons. This might include [[neutrino]]s and free [[electron]]s, [[dark matter]], such as [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]], [[axion]]s, and [[black hole]]s. 
 
 The very existence of baryons is a significant issue in [[cosmology]]. It is assumed that the [[Big Bang]] produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and [[antimatter|antibaryon]]s. How baryons came to outnumber their [[antiparticle]]s is called [[baryogenesis]]. 
 
 === Properties of matter === 
 Matter can be directly experienced through the [[Sensory system|senses]]. It has properties which can be measured, such as [[mass]], [[volume]], [[density]], and [[wikt:qualitative|qualitative]] properties such as [[taste]], [[Odor|smell]] and [[colour]], for instance. 
 
 === Examples of matter === 
 All physical bodies in the [[universe]] are made of matter: [[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[water]] and [[air]]. Living [[organism]]s like [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[human]]s are also composed of matter. 
 
 In physics, the universe also contains things that aren't matter, including some elementary particles that have no rest mass.  Photons (electromagnetic radiation such as light) are a familiar example. 
 
 In addition to its rest mass, matter can contain other forms of [[energy]], which aren't matter but allow them to interact with each other by exchanging [[kinetic energy]],  [[heat]], [[light]], [[sound]] waves, etc. 
 
 Outside of the physical sciences, there can be many other things that aren't matter or energy.  Just for example, [[emotion]]s can be experienced or [[idea]]s can be had. 
 
 == Composition == 
 The [[structure]] and [[Chemical composition|composition]] of matter is investigated by breaking matter into smaller and smaller pieces. Hence, living organisms are made up of [[cell]]s. Cells are composed of [[molecule]]s, which are sets of [[atom]]s bonded together. Each atom, in turn, is an assemblage of [[elementary particle]]s. 
 
 == States of matter == 
 Physicists also classify matter in a few broad categories, called [[States of matter|states]], with quite different properties: 
 * [[Solid]]s are material objects made up of molecules and atoms so strongly bonded together that they tend to keep their shape even when moved around, though they can deform under stress. Examples: a rock, a [[Table (furniture)|table]], a [[knife]], a block of [[ice]]. 
 * [[Fluid]]s are amounts of matter composed of molecules and atoms weakly bonded together. They do not have a proper shape. There are two types of fluids: 
 ** [[Liquid]]s include condensed forms of matter, like solids, but where the bonds between the constituting elements (molecules, atoms) allow them to move with respect to each other while continuing to stick together in bulk: they maintain a definite surface. Liquids adopt the shape of the recipients in which they are contained. Examples: [[water]], [[oil]], [[blood]], [[lava]], [[soft drink]]s. 
 ** [[Gas]]es are amounts of matter where the bonds between the constituting elements (molecules, atoms) are so loose or weak that they can move independently from each other. Gases do not exhibit a proper surface, they tend to expand to occupy the whole volume available. Examples: [[air]], [[water vapor]], [[helium]]. 
 * [[Plasma (physics)|Plasmas]] are made of [[ionization|ionized]] matter, they are mostly of interest to scientists. Examples: the [[Earth]]'s [[ionosphere]], the [[Sun]]'s corona. The particles in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] are a mixture between a liquid and a gas. The particles are free to move, like a [[liquid]], and the attraction is weak, like a gas. This state of matter is not fully understood. An example of plasma can be found in [[lightning]]. 
 *A [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (BEC) is a state of matter of a dilute gas of [[boson]]s cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero (0 K or −273.15 °C) 
 
 A given amount of matter may change from one state to another depending on its [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. On Earth, water can exist simultaneously in three states: solid (ice), liquid water (lakes, oceans) and gas (vapor or [[steam]]).
