 A '''clipboard''' is a thin board with a large (usually metal) clip at the top. Clipboards are a little larger than a piece of [[paper]]. They are used to support paper with one hand, while writing on the paper with the other hand. Clipboards are often used in situations where a person may not be able to find a good writing surface. 
 
 Clipboards can be made of many things. Most clipboards are made of [[masonite]] or [[particleboard]], two types of [[wood]]. They can also be made from aluminum, steel, or [[acrylic]], which is a type of plastic.
