 '''Braces''' ('''suspenders''' in the U.S.) are a standard item of male [[clothing]]. Their function is to keep [[trousers]] at a set height on the body. They are standard wear for formal styles of dress such as the [[lounge suit]]. 
 
 There is also a [[fashion]] use among some young males, and a use by some workmen, most often with [[newspaper]]. Braces can be worn entirely out of sight, hidden by a [[waistcoat]], or in sight as a display. < ref > As, for example, the red braces worn by [[Michael Douglas]] in the film [[Wall Street (movie)|Wall Street]] < /ref >  A critical factor in formal dress is the  " drop "  of the trousers as they meet the shoes. Here braces avoid the need to hitch trousers up, always a problem with [[belt]]s. < ref > Flusser, Alan 1985. ''Clothes and the man'': suspenders and belts. Villard. {{ISBN|0-394-54623-7}} [http://www.throughtherye.com/flusser/ch6.htm] < /ref > 
 
 In many countries braces were worn by all classes of men for well over a hundred years until about the [[1960s]], except in the [[armed forces]]. Then [[fashion]] changed and men's clothes became informal, with lower waistlines and [[belt]]s. Now they are a minority item.
