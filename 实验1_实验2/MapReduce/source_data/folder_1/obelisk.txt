 An '''obelisk''' is a [[monument]] made out of stone, much like a [[column]] but supporting nothing. 
 
 Obelisks were erected by [[Ancient Egyptians]] for commemoration. Obelisks were usually made of a single piece of [[stone]].  
 
 A bird's eye view of obelisk is square and this structure has gradually tapering four sides and its ends in a [[pyramid]]al top. 
 
 Obelisks originated with the holy stone of sanctuary which served the sun god, [[Ra]], in [[Heliopolis]]. There usually was a pair in front of a gate or sanctuary, and on each side of obelisk there were written hymns and some actions of the of king in [[hieroglyph|hieroglyphics]]. 
 
 Obelisks can have interior spaces. 
 
 There are similar forms of obelisks in [[Europe]] and [[America]], and some were taken from Egypt by Europeans and Americans. The [[Washington Monument]] is a large, modern, built obelisk.
