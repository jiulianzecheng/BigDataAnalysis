Many of the summits have [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]]. These are basically free-standing [[Geological formation|rock formations]] that stand on top of the rocky landscape. < ref name= " cnp-Landscape " > {{cite web|title=Landscape Character Assessment - The Cairngorms Massif|url=http://rrcairngorms-2015.rs.rroom.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cairngorms_Central_Massif.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220212625/http://rrcairngorms-2015.rs.rroom.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cairngorms_Central_Massif.pdf|archive-date=2018-02-20|accessdate=2018-02-20|publisher=Cairngorms National Park Authority}} < /ref >

 There are no glaciers in the area. However, snow can fall at any month of the year. In fact, some snow may be found all summer. It is the most ideal place for [[ice climbing]] in Britain.{{sfnp|Watson|1992|p=16}} < ref > {{cite news|last1=English|first1=Charlie|authorlink1=Adam Watson (scientist)|date=7 February 2009|title=Doctor Watson's feeling for snow|work=Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/weather|url-status=live|accessdate=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6fRSMZMnj?url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/07/weather|archive-date=20 February 2016|df=dmy}} < /ref >   
 
 The mountains are also popular for [[hill-walking]], [[ski touring]] and  [[climbing]]. There are also three [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[Ski resort|ski centres]] within the area: [[Cairn Gorm]], [[The Lecht]] and [[Glenshee]]. 
 
 The range lies in the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Scottish council areas]] of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Moray]] and [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], < ref name= " sheet36 " > [[Ordnance Survey]] Landranger 1:50000, Sheet 36 < /ref >  and within the [[County|counties]] of [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]], Invernessshire and [[Banffshire]].

 The original [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name for the area is ''Am Monadh Ruadh'', (the red hills). It is different from ''Am [[Monadhliath Mountains|Monadh Liath]]'' (the grey hills) which lie to the west of the [[River Spey]]: 
 {{quote|If you look from Aviemore on a clear evening, the granite screes of Lairig Ghru and Braeriach do glow a warm red in the sun. The name Am Monadh Ruadh still lives among the oldest folk of Strath Spey, but long ago, outsiders had replaced it with 'the Cairngorms', on maps and in guide books.|Watson  < ref name= " watson1975 " / > }} 
 The [[English language]] name for the area is Cairngorms. It came from [[Cairn Gorm]]. It is the [[Prominence|prominent]] in the view of the mountains from Speyside. The earliest time when the name appeared in the history is from a [[Colonel T. Thornton]] who visited the area in about 1786: < ref name= " watson1975 " > {{Cite book|title=[[The Cairngorms]]|last=Watson|first=Adam|publisher=The Scottish Mountaineering Trust|year=1975|location=Edinburgh}} < /ref > < ref name= " alex1928 " > {{Cite book|title=[[The Cairngorms]]|last=Alexander|first=Henry|publisher=The Scottish Mountaineering Club|year=1928|location=Edinburgh}} < /ref > 
 {{quote|The use of the term  " Cairngorms "  as applied to the group must have become well established early in the nineteenth century, for we find it in Col Thornton's ''Sporting Tour'' (1804), where there is a reference to  " Aurora peeping over the immense Cairngorms. " |Alexander  < ref name= " alex1928 " / >  (p21)}} 
 Cairn Gorm means ''Blue Cairn. A''lthough the Gaelic ''gorm'' can also be used as an adjective and verb. It means green or greening, and is often seen in connection with growing grass. < ref > {{cite web|last=Dwelly|first=William Robertson, Michael Bauer, Edward|title=Dwelly-d - Dwelly's Classic Scottish Gaelic Dictionary|url=http://www.dwelly.info/|publisher=}} < /ref >
