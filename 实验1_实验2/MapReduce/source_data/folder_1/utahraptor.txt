 '''''Utahraptor''''' was a large mid-[[Cretaceous]] [[dromaeosaurid]] [[predator]] with 9-15 inch (23-38 cm) middle-toe [[claw]]s.  
 
 It was a fast-moving, agile, bipedal (walked on two legs), [[bird]]-like [[dinosaur]]. It had a curved, flexible neck and a big head. Sharp, serrated [[teeth]] were set into very powerful [[jaw]]s. Each of its three fingers on each arm had large, sharp, curved claw. 
 
 It had four-toed feet; the second toe had a 9-15 inch (23-38 cm) sickle-like claw and the other toes had smaller claws. Its long tail had bony rods running along the spine giving it rigidity; the tail was used for balance and fast turning ability.  
 
 It had a relatively large brain and large, keen, eyes. Utahraptor was 16-23 feet (5-7 m) long and may have weighed about .5 ton.
