'''Cladotheria''' (also called Zatheria) is a [[clade]] of [[Mammal|mammals]]â€”that means a group of mammals who all [[Evolution|evolved]] from the same ancient creature. Cladotheria has [[Marsupial|marsupials]], [[Placentalia|placentals]], and some kinds of [[extinct]] animals like [[Dryolestoid|dryolestoids]], [[Amphitheriid|amphitheriids]] and [[Peramurid|peramurids]]. This clade was named in 1975 by [[Malcolm McKenna]]. In 2002, scientists called it a [[node-based taxon]] that had  " the common ancestor of dryolestids and living therians, plus all its descendants " . A different definition was written in 2013. Then scientists said that Cladotheria has all groups of mammals that are more like a house mouse than they are like the animal [[Spalacotherium tricuspidens]].
