 '''Preamplifier''' is a type of electronic amplifier. It doesn't have enough [[power]] to feed [[loudspeaker|speakers]]. Rather a preamplifier amplifies weak signals, for example from a [[microphone]], for electronic processing or distribution.   
 
 Early preamplifiers used [[vacuum tube]]s. Since the [[1960s]], most electronic amplifiers have been built with [[transistor]]s. Transistors are lighter, less expensive, and more reliable.
