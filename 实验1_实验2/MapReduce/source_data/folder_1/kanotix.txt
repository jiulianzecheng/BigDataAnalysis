 '''Kanotix''', also referred to as '''KANOTIX''', is a [[Linux distribution]] [[Live CD]] ([[LiveDistro]]) based on [[Debian]] (until 2006 ''unstable'', in 2007 KANOTIX moved to Debian Etch) with advanced hardware detection. < ref > [http://www.kanotix.org/index.html Kanotix Introduction] < /ref > < ref > [http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/19794 Thorhammer Beta-Review on tuxmachines.org, July 2007 (author: eco2geek)] < /ref >  It can run from an [[optical disc drive]] without using a [[hard disk]]. 
 
 Kanotix uses [[KDE]] as the default [[desktop environment]]. [[GNOME]] and other [[window manager]]s can be downloaded using [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]. 
 
 The name  " Kanotix "  is derived from the founder's [[nickname]]  " Kano " . Kanotix's mascot is a [[fangtooth]]. 
 
 ==Content== 
 Kanotix is based on Debian stable (currently  " Etch " ). It contains a lot of [[backport]]s. < ref > [http://kanotix.com/files/thorhammer/backports/ Kanotix backports] < /ref >  So many of the main applications are more recent than are available in Etch.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

 * [[KDE]], the default desktop environment, including the Konqueror, IceWM, Beryl (allows access to a 3D desktop environment) 
 * [[Amarok]], [[Video Disk Recorder]] 
 * [[Beryl (window manager)]] 
 * Internet access software, including the KPPP dialer, ISDN utilities and WLAN-[[NdisWrapper]] 
 * [[Iceweasel]]-web browser,  [[IceDove]] Mail/News Client, [[Pidgin]] instant messenger

 ===History=== 
 In 2003 Jörg Schirottke was known with the nickname  " Kano "  in the former [[Knoppix]]-Forum (no more available). The distribution derived from ''[http://kanotix.com/files/ " Kano's Scriptpage for Knoppix " ] ''. He wrote about Knoppix:  " I like it much, but I had to improve it :) " . < ref > [http://kanotix.com/files/kanotix/ Kano about  " Knoppix " ] " < /ref >  So he did. One of the main differences from Knoppix was the support of hard disk installation. 
 The first  " Kanotix " -preview was released at [[24 December]] [[2003]]  " KANOTIX XMAS 2003 PREVIEW " . 
 In 2004 and 2005 KANOTIX was a popular distribution ranking in the  " top 20 "  of  " distrowatch.com " . < ref > [http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=2005 Popularity: Ranking in distrowatch year 2005] < /ref > < ref > [http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-kanotix Review  " KANOTIX - Putting the Pizzazz on Debian " ] < /ref >  In 2004 the releases were named  " Bug Hunter "  (Bug Hunter-01-2004 - X-2004). After problems with the stability in 2006 Jörg  " Kano "  Schirottke decided to move from Debian Sid to a less volatile basis. < ref > [http://kanotix.com/Article210.html Codeveloper leaves Kanotix] < /ref > 
 In October 2006 the main Kanotix co-developer (and most of Kanotix's other developers) left the project, to start [[sidux]], another distribution based on [[Debian#Development versions|Debian sid]]. The last Kanotix release based on Debian Sid was 2006-01-RC4.
