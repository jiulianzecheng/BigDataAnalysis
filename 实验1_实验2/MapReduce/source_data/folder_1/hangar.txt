 A '''hangar''' is a closed structure made to hold [[aircraft]] while it is on the ground. It is like a [[garage]] but for aircraft instead of cars. A hangar is most often made of metal, but may be made of other things like wood and concrete. It protects the aircraft from [[weather]] and sun damage.
