 The '''Acrididae''' are the main family of [[grasshopper]]s, with 10,000 of the 11,000 species of the entire suborder [[Caelifera]]. The Acrididae are best known because all [[locust]]s (swarming grasshoppers) are of the Acrididae. However, not all Acrididae are locusts: 'locust' is a term that is only given to those grasshoppers that swarm. 
 
 Acrididae grasshoppers have relatively short and stout [[antenna]]e, and drum-like tympana on the side of the first abdominal [[segment]]. 
 
 The name Acrididae is derived from Greek ''akris'', meaning locust. < ref name= " BUG " > {{cite web |title=Family Acrididae - Short-horned Grasshoppers |url=https://bugguide.net/node/view/155 |website=bugguide.net |accessdate=22 July 2022 |date=21 August 2021}} < /ref >
