 The '''Eublepharinae''' are one of the five [[subfamilies]] of the [[Gekkonidae]], or [[gecko]]s. The Eublepharinae subfamily has 27 [[species]] in five [[genera]]. Also called '''eyelid geckos''', the eublepharines have more simple features than other geckos. For example, they don't have the ability to climb surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable [[eyelid]]s. They are generally [[Nocturnal animals|active at night]] or at [[twilight]]. These lizards often eat [[insects]] and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and, in most species, the gender of the young is determined by the temperature of the egg; just like [[crocodile]]s. < ref name=EoR > {{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G.  &  Zweifel, R.G.|author= Bauer, Aaron M.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0/page/146 146]â€“147|isbn= 0-12-178560-2}} < /ref >
