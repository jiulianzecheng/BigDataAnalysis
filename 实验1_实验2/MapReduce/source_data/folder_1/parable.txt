A '''parable''' is a short [[story]] in [[prose]] or [[verse]]. It teaches something. On the surface, it may be about animals or objects, but is just a [[metaphor]] for the real idea. Familiar are the [[parables of Jesus]], where he explains an idea by telling a story. Familiar also are the parables of [[Aesop]].
