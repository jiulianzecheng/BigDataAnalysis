 '''Summer''' is one of the four [[season]]s. It is the [[heat|hottest]] season of the year. In some places, summer is the wettest season (with the most rain), and in other places, it is a dry season. Four seasons are found in areas which are not too hot or too [[cold]]. Summer happens to the north and south sides of the [[Earth]] at opposite times of the [[year]]. In the north part of the world, summer takes place between the months of [[June]] and [[September]], and in the south part of the world, it takes place between [[December]] and [[March]]. This is because when the north part of the Earth points towards the Sun, the south part points away. 
 
 Many people in rich countries [[travel]] in summer, to [[seaside resort]]s, [[beach]]es, [[Camping|camps]] or [[Picnic|picnics]]. In some countries, they celebrate things in the summer as well as enjoying cool drinks. Other countries get snow in the summer just like winter.
