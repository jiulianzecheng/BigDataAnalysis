 '''Goalball''' is a [[sport]] for people who are [[blind]], meaning they cannot see. It is played by men and women. Each [[team]] has six people on it. Three people play on each team at one time. < ref name= " ipc-about "  / >  A team throws the ball at a [[goal]] behind the people on the other team. They get a point if the ball goes in the goal. The ball has a [[bell]] in it. Players cannot see the ball, but they can hear the bell. They use their body to stop the ball. It is governed by the [[International Blind Sports Federation]], and it is a sport in the [[Paralympic Games]]. 
 
 Goalball players wear [[blindfold]]s. This is because some players can not see at all (they are totally blind), and some other players can still see a little bit. When players wear blindfolds, none of the players can see anything. This makes it [[fairness|fair]] for all the players. < ref > {{cite web|title=Goalball|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/disability_sport/3841085.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2013}} < /ref >

 Goalball was invented in 1946 by Hanz Lorenzen and Sepp Reindle.
