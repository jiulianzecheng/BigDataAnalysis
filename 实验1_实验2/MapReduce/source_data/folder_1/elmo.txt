 }} 
 '''Elmo''' is a muppet character from the TV show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He is a [[red]] monster, and has his own part of the show called ''Elmo's World''. His age is 3 years old. He is very famous for his laugh. His best friend is a pink fairy named [[Abby Cadabby]]. 
 
 Elmo was originally a nameless extra performed by various puppeteers with no established identity. After that, he became a recurring character on the show. Brian Muehl was the first main performer and gave him a whispery voice. Richard Hunt performed him next and gave him a gruff voice. However, [[Kevin Clash]] was given the muppet in 1984 and used a new voice for him. This voice was made using [[falsetto]]. The muppet then became very popular. Elmo always talks in [[grammatical person|third person]]: for example, Elmo says  " Elmo knows where you live! "  rather than  " I know where you live! "  Elmo has a pet fish named Dorothy. He plays the toy [[piano]] and likes to ride his [[tricycle]]. Elmo is very popular with younger children. 
 
 In the 1990s, an Elmo toy called  " Tickle Me Elmo "  was sold. In a short time, it became one of the most popular ''Sesame Street'' toys in stores.
