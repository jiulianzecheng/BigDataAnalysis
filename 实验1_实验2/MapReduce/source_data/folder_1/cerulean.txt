 '''Cerulean''' is a range of colours from [[teal (colour)|teal]]-[[blue]], sky-blue, bright blue, or [[azure]] to deep [[cyan]]. The word cerulean comes from the [[Latin]] word ''caeruleum'', which means  " [[sky]] "  or  " [[heaven]]s " . This was in turn from Latin ''caeruleus'' deep blue: resembling the blue of the sky. 
 
 In classical times, this term was used to describe blue [[pigment]]s, particularly mixtures of [[copper]] and [[cobalt|cobaltous]] [[oxide]]s, called genuine cerulean. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish [[hue]]s and lack of [[Fugitive pigments|permanence]]. When the artificial pigment [[cerulean blue]] was invented people started using this instead. 
 
 The first recorded use of ''cerulean'' as a color name in [[English language|English]] was in 1590. < ref > Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 190; Color Sample of Cerulean: Page 89 Plate 33 Color Sample E6 < /ref >
