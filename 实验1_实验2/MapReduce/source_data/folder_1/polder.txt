 '''Empoldering''' is a method of reclaiming land from the sea or from inland lakes, and a way to control [[flood]] < nowiki/ > s.  Empoldering involves the use of a polder, a piece of land in a low-lying area that has been reclaimed from a body of water by building dikes and [[drainage]] canals. 
 
 Although empoldering is usually carried out in low-lying coastal areas, it can also be dome in inland areas such as lakes and rivers.  It is common in countries like the [[Netherlands]], where much of the country is below sea level and subject to flooding.  About one-fifth of the land in the Netherlands has been reclaimed from the sea.  Their largest and most successful project is the [[Zuiderzee Works]]. 
 
 Polders have two distinct features.  Firstly, they are enclosed by dikes to keep the water out.  The dikes also serve to protect the polder from [[erosion]].  Secondly, polders are continually maintained by systems of drainage canals and pumps which prevent them from becoming waterlogged and hence, suitable for cultivation. 
 
 == Process == 
 
 Stage 1: Dike constructed around the area to be reclaimed to keep water from coming in. 
 
 Stage 2: The area is drained using pumps and drainage canals. 
 
 Stage 3:  " [[Reed (plant)|Reed]] < nowiki/ > s "  (a type of salt tolerant plant) are sown by aircraft to help the soil form. 
 
 Stage 4: After 3 years, reeds are burnt and the ash is used as fertilizers for the soil. 
 
 Stage 5: After a period of up to 15 years, the polder is ready for growing crops, building houses and constructing roads. 
 
 == Limits of land reclamation == 
 
 1. Cost of reclaiming from deeper waters  
 
 2. Availability of sand  
 
 3. Dispute over territorial boundaries
