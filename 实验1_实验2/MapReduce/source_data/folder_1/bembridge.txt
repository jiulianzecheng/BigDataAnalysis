 == History == 
 
 The villages of Bembridge and Yaverland were once a separate island, off the coast of the rest of the Isle of Wight. There was a channel of water called Brading Haven, which separated the two islands. Before the time in which [[Queen Victoria]] was the queen of the United Kingdom, the village of Bembridge only had a few huts and [[farm house]]s. It was only when a church was built in 1827 that the village started to grow.

 The most old buildings in the village are found close to the church in the north of the village. In this part of the village there are a number of shops, pubs (places to buy and drink alcohol), and restaurants (places to buy food). There is also the village hall (a place for meetings, sales and events). 
 
 In the south of the village there is an area which is called 'Lane End'. It is a more modern part of the village and has its own shops. In this part of the village there is a lifeboat station. There are two schools in Bembridge, one is for children of ages 4–8, and the other is for children of ages 9–13.
