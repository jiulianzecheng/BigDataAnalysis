 A '''priest''' or '''priestess''' is a person who  is allowed to do religious rites. Their office or position is the '''priesthood''', a word which can also be used for such persons collectively. In most [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s in history there have been priests, although they have a lot of different names, and follow different rules. {{See also|Clergy}} 
 
 == In Christianity == 
 
 A '''priest''' is a member of a [[church]] that has been told to look after his (spiritual) [[community]]. He is the head of a [[parish]]. 
 
 *Catholic priests are ordained (put in place) by the [[Pope]] (or in his absence: a [[bishop]]). 
 *Orthodox priests are ordained by the [[Patriarch]] 
 *Anglican priests are ordained by their bishop. 
 *Most Protestant groups do not ordain priests. 
 
 To become a Catholic priest, you are required to study [[Theology]]. The Orthodox and Protestant Churches also have laymen as [[clergy]]. 
 
 Catholic priests are not allowed to marry meaning that they have to be [[celibacy|celibate]]. Orthodox priests can be married, but they must not marry after they become a priest. Anglican priests can get married before or during the time they are a priest. 
 
 The Catholic Church does not allow women to become priests. However, some [[Anglican]] Churches allow women to be priests. 
 
 Higher priests are called Bishops and Archbishops in the Anglican Church. John Sentamua and [[Rowan Williams]] are the archbishops of York and [[Canterbury]]. In some denominations only men can become priests. 
 
 The [[Orthodox]] Church has a higher priest called a [[Patriarch]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], like the Roman Catholic Church has a [[Pope]], Pope Tawadras. 
 
 ===Protestantism=== 
 Many [[Protestant]] churches have ministers or [[pastor]]s instead of priests. 
 
 ==Japan== 
 In [[Japan]] there are [[Buddhist]] priests and [[nun]]s, [[Shinto]] priests and [[priestess]]es (''[[kannushi]]'') as well as [[clergy]] in the Christian traditions.
