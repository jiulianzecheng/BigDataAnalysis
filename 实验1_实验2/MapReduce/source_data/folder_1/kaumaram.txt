 {{Kaumaram}} 
 
 '''Kaumaram''' is a [[Hindu denominations|Hindu denomination]] that focuses on the deity of love and war ''Kumara'', also known as ''Murugan'' (in [[South India]]), ''Kandan'', or ''Kadamban'', or ''[[Kartikeya]]''. Most devotees of Kumara also revere members of his family: [[Parvati]], [[Shiva]], and [[Ganesha]]. The important theological texts relating to Kumara are a part of the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Shaiva agama]] canon. This sub-tradition is found among the [[Tamils]], [[Kannada people|Kannada]], [[Vedda]] in South India, Sri Lanka, and among the [[Tamil diaspora]] worldwide. < ref name= " Dalal " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC & pg=PA417|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|author=Roshen Dalal|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2010|isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|location=New Delhi|pages=417–418, 137, 198–199, 241, 425}} < /ref >  The love story of Kumara/Murugan and his wife [[Valli]], a girl from a local tribe, is immensely popular in [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[South India]]. < ref name= " Zvelebil " > {{cite book|title=Tiru Murugan|author=Kamil V.

 == Association with Tamil language ==

 == Legend of Kartikeya == 
 {{seealso|Bhagavata Purana|Devi Mahatmya|Shiva Purana|Kumārasambhava}} 
 According to the [[Skanda Purana]], Kartikeya Muruga was the second son of [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]] younger brother to [[Ganesha]]. According to the [[Purana|Puranic]] sources, he incarnated as six sparks emanating from the [[Third eye]] of Lord Shiva. < ref > [http://www.astrojyoti.com/skandapurana.htm Skanda Purana or Kartika Purana < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  According to the Skanda Purana, [[Muruga]] imprisoned [[Brahma]], protected [[Vishnu]] from the [[asuras]] and taught the [[Om|Pranava Mantram]] to [[Shiva]]. Thus Muruga is considered superior to the [[Trimurti]]. The worshippers of Lord Muruga are called Kaumaras. 
 
 == Worship traditions == 
 [[File:முருகன்_வீதி_உலா.jpg|right|thumb|Lord Murugan with Deivaanai (on right of image) and Valli (on left of image).]] 
 Tamil Nadu has six primary temples for Kartikeya that are known by the name [[Six Abodes of Murugan|''Aru Padai Veedu'']], which that translates roughly as  " the Six Stations " . 
 
 Modes of worship include ''[[Kavadi]]'' that is a form of dance, ''Alagu'' which is a sharp piece of metal that one pierces on the body, carrying milk and water on the heads to offer to the deity and involves a [[Satvic]] diet. 
 
 [[Thaipusam]] is an occasion that is celebrated in Kaumaram. This is much more prevalent in the Murugan Temple in Malaysia. Another chief period of worship is the ''Shashti''. This is a period of six days when villages in South India with primary Kartikeya deities come together for a celebration. The people involved take a vow on following a vegetarian diet for the period. The six days portray events from the life of Kartikeya. The chief parts covered are the ceremonies in which he is awarded the Spear ''Shakti [[Vel]]'' by his mother Shakthi, the killing of the demon [[Surapadman]], and his marriage. 
 
 Other than this, Karnataka, that is another prominent place for Kaumaras, would have its own mode of worship. Trekking the [[Kumara Parvatha]] where he is believed to have attained Mukthi giving up his life is popular although not essentially in a very traditional manner. < ref > {{Cite web|title=OUR HERITAGE KAUMARAM It has already been|url=https://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/details/our%20heritage%205.html|access-date=2021-08-06|website=www.kamakoti.org}} < /ref > 
 
 == Literature and arts == 
 The primary works in [[Sanskrit]] related to Kaumaram are [[Skanda Purana]]m detailing the history of Kartikeya and [[Kumārasambhava]], a poem by the Sanskrit scholar [[Kalidas]] that literally translates as  " The Creation of Kumara "  or  " the Creation of the Son/Boy " . 
 
 [[Adi Shankara]] wrote a piece on Kartikeya called ''Subramanya Bhujangam'' . 
 
 In Tamil, abundant literature is to be found both in the classical texts and in the folklore. The Skanda Puranam was translated into Tamil. Chief contributors to the classical Tamil texts include [[Arunagirinathar]] who wrote hymns of praise with complicated grammar patterns and [[alliteration]] and [[onomatopoeia]]. 
 
 Tamil folk music have hymns written praising the beauty and bravery of Kartikeya. Another chiefly written topic is the way he fell in love and converted his bride [[Valli]]. There is a dedicated tune called  " Kavadi Sindhu "  that is usually used to sing such hymns. This tune became associated with celebrations and dances. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIgnAAAAMAAJ & q=kaumaram|title=Kandar Anubhuti (God-experience) of Saint Arunagirinathar|last=Karthikeyan|first=N.

 == Paramparai and Sampradayam == 
 Lord Muruga in his great mercy and compassion responds to his devotees without the need for a mortal guru. He is the Supreme Guru of the Universe and responds to his devotees in ways that suit their consciousness best. There only is one Sampradaya in the Kaumara faith, that which begins from Lord Muruga Himself. Unfortunately, today the Kaumara faith has lost the glory and majesty it once possessed. It has merged largely into [[Shaivism]]. However, ancient texts such as the Kumara Tantra and the Skanda Sadbhava Tantra does give significant insight on the Kaumara faith in its original sense. 
 
 == Pranava Mantram == 
 There's an anecdote where [[Shiva]] pretends to forget the significance of the mantra [[Om]] and asks little Kartikeya. The young boy astounds everyone by showing Shiva that it is the source of all creation. This earns him the name ''Thagappan Swami'' or ''Swami Naadha'' meaning he outdid his father.
