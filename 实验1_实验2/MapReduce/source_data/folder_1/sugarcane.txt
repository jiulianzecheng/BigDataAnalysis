 '''Sugarcane''' (or '''sugar cane''') is a [[genus|Genus of]]  [[plant]]s. There are between 6 and 37 [[species|types]] of sugarcane.Sugarcane grows in warm and tropical [[climate]]s. It first grew in [[Asia]], but after the year 700 people started planting it in [[Africa]] and southern [[Europe]]. Later it spread to [[the Americas]] and [[Australia]]. Today the biggest producer is [[Brazil]] in [[South America]]. [[India]] in Asia is second biggest producer after Brazil. 
 
 Sugarcane [[plant stem|stalks]] grow to between 2 and 6 [[meters]] tall. These stalks contain [[sugar]], which is used to sweeten [[food]] and [[drink]]s. After the sugar has been taken out the remains of the stalks can be burned to generate heat and electricity. It can also be made into [[paper]], cardboard and [[cutlery]]. This crop requires high temperature and high rainfall. In areas of low rainfall this crop is cultivated with the help of irrigation. Black soil or alluvial soil is the best for this crop. Sugarcane requires a large amount of water. That is why holding deep soil is required. As this crop absorbs nutrient matter from the soil, compost manure and chemical fertilizers are used. It wants 75-100cm rainfall. 
 
 Sugarcane juice can be made by pressing the stalks in a machine.  It is often sold in the streets in some countries.  It can contain disease. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Bruce Kraig|title=Street Food around the World|author2=Colleen Taylor Sen|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598849554|page=130}} < /ref >
