 An '''ellipse'''  < ref > from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἔλλειψις ''elleipsis'', a  " falling short " < /ref >  is a shape that looks like an [[oval]] or a flattened [[circle]].  
 
 In [[geometry]], an '''ellipse''' is a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] [[curve]] which results from the intersection of a [[cone]] by a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] in a way that produces a closed curve.   
 
 [[Circle]]s are special cases of ellipses, created when the cutting plane is [[Right angle|perpendicular]] to the cone's axis.

 [[Image:locating_the_foci_of_an_ellipse.svg|thumb|150px|The foci (purple crosses) are at intersects of the major axis (red) and a circle (cyan) of radius equal to the semi-major axis (blue), centred on an end of the minor axis (grey)]] 
 A circle has one center, called a [[focus]]. An ellipse has two foci.  
 
 An ellipse is simply all points on a graph that the sum of the distances from 2 points are the same. For example, an ellipse can be made by putting two pins into cardboard and a circle of string around those two, then putting a pencil in the loop and pulling as far as possible without breaking the string in all directions. The orbits of the planets are ellipses, with the sun at one focus.   
 
 The equation of an ellipse is 
 
 < math display= " block " > \frac{(x-h)^{2}}{a^{2}} + \frac{(y-k)^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1  < /math >    < br / > where the center of the ellipse is (h,k). 2A is the length from each end of the longer skinnier side.  2b is the length of the 2 ends of the short side.  A²-B²=C² for c is the length between the foci and the center. 
 
 
 An ellipse can also be expressed as  
 
 
 < math > \frac{(x-h)^{2}}{b^{2}} + \frac{(y-k)^{2}}{a^{2}} = 1  < /math > 
 
 
 In this case, it will be taller than it is wide.
