 '''Egypt''' is a [[country]] in northeast [[Africa]], parts of the country hang on to the [[Middle East]]. Its capital city is [[Cairo]]. Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[monument]]s, such as the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]] and the [[Sphinx]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Ancient Egypt]] has one of the longest histories of any country in the world as it used to be ruled by [[pharaoh]]s. As a province of the [[Roman Empire]], it became Christian and some [[Coptic Church]] people are thereafter more than a thousand years of Muslim rule. The [[Fatimid Caliphate]] ruled Egypt in the tenth through twelfth centuries. [[Mamluk]]es ruled it until 1798 when [[Napoleon]] defeated them. [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] soon took over and started a [[dynasty]] of [[Khedive]]s under the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Empire fell apart after [[World War I]]. Egypt became an independent country in 1922 and the khedive became a king. Egypt is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. It became a [[republic]] after the Army's [[revolution]] of 1952. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Egypt is a large country, but a large portion of it is [[desert]]. Most people (95% of Egypt's total people) live in areas around the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and along the [[Nile]] River. This includes the cities of [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Aswan]], and [[Port Said]]. Not many people live in the desert. Today, Egypt has about 90 million people. 
 
 Egypt is divided into 29 areas, called [[Governorates of Egypt]]. 
 
 == Politics == 
 Egypt is a country that has had many different rulers and many political systems. After [[World War II]], Egypt was still ruled by a king, [[Farouk of Egypt]] (11 February 1920 – 18 March 1965). He was the last ruler of the [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali]] [[dynasty]]. 
 
 Farouk was overthrown on 23 July 1952 by a military [[coup]]. The coup was led by Muhammad Naguib, and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. From then on, Egypt had military rulers or rulers who had the backing of the army and many citizens. 
 
 Nasser became president, from 1956 to 1970. Later rulers were [[Anwar Sadat]], and [[Hosni Mubarak]]. 
 
 [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] became president in 2014. 
 
 ===[[Revolution]] of 2011 === 
 {{Main|2011 Egyptian revolution}} 
 In January 2011, thousands of [[protest]]ers gathered in [[Cairo]]. They wanted [[Hosni Mubarak]] to leave office. He had been the [[President]] for almost 30 years. On February 11, 2011, [[Vice President]] [[Omar Suleiman]] made an announcement. He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office. < ref name= " MebarakResignes " > {{cite news |title=Mubarak Resigns as Egyptian President |first=Ahmed A  |last=Namatalla |author2=Mariam Fam and Zainab Fattah |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=2011-02-11 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/mubarak-leaves-presidency-hands-power-to-egypt-s-military-suleiman-says.html |accessdate=2011-02-11 }} < /ref >  In 2012, Egypt had a democratic election for the post of President. The winner was the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] candidate, [[Mohamed Morsi]]. 
 
 The events which followed are still controversial, but one aspect stands out. Morsi issued a declaration that in effect gave him unlimited powers. He had the power to legislate (make laws) without legal overview by the courts. This caused widespread protests. On 3 July 2013, he was unseated by a military coup council (a [[coup d'état]]). After an election in June 2014, [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] became President of Egypt. Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, rejected the change of regime as a military coup, and not democratic. 
 
 == Demographics == 
 === Religion === 
 Today, the people of Egypt are mostly [[Sunni Muslims]]. There are many Christians in Egypt today. Many of these belong to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. 
 
 === Languages === 
 The official language in Egypt is [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The majority speak Egyptian Arabic but many speak other dialects. Some Egyptians still speak [[Coptic language|Coptic]]{{fact|date=September 2018}} and [[English as a second language|English]]. They also speak French and German in Egypt. These are taught in Egypt as additional languages. 
 
 ==Famous people== 
 Many famous people are from Egypt. Some of these include [[Omar Sharif]], who was an international actor, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], who was the first person from [[Africa]] to lead the [[United Nations]], and four [[Nobel Prize]] winners: [[Anwar Sadat]], who won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1978, [[Naguib Mahfouz]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1988, [[Ahmed Zewail]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1999, and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. [[Mohamed Salah]] is a famous footballer who plays for Liverpool in England. A famous Egyptian singer is called Amr Diab. 
 
 ==Governorates== 
 Egypt is divided into 27 [[governorates]]. The governorates are divided into regions. The regions have towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital. Sometimes capital has the same name as the governorate.

 == Culture == 
 Egypt is a country with an immense cultural mix. Life in the countryside differs from life in large cities. There are differences between the families which are Muslim, and the smaller number which are [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]]. There are noticeable differences in the standards of education. 
 
 == Tourism == 
 [[File:Giza Plateau - Pyramid of Menkaure.JPG|thumb|Pyramid of Menkaure|236x236px]] 
 Tourism is one of the most important national incomes in Egypt. In 2008, about 12 million tourists visited Egypt providing nearly $12 billion of national income to Egypt. Tourism affects the economy of the country as a whole. < ref > [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/20/ozabs-tourism-egypt-idAFJOE59J0PG20091020?sp=true  " Egypt tourism numbers to fall less than feared " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143438/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/20/ozabs-tourism-egypt-idAFJOE59J0PG20091020?sp=true |date=2015-09-24 }}, Reuters Africa.

 [[Giza Necropolis]] is one of Egypt's iconic sites. It is a popular destination for tourists to visit. It includes the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]. 
 
 == Transport == 
 There are methods of transport in Egypt. The [[Suez Canal]] carries ships of many countries. 
 
 [[File:Cairo Metro Sadat plathome.jpg|thumb|238x238px|Cairo Metro, Sadat Station]] 
 [[Cairo Metro]] is one of the most important projects in Egypt. It consists of 3 lines. Metro is the most preferable transport in Egypt due to persistent major traffic jams in the streets of Cairo. < ref > [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/world/middleeast/cairos-subway-is-efficient-orderly-and-dependable.html  " Underground, Everything That Life Above Is Not " ], NY Times.
