 '''Steampunk''' is a style of [[fiction]] having to do with a semi-fictional world where old machinery from the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] 19th century is still being used. Technologies that were new or important to the Victorians, such as [[steam power]], [[clockwork]] or [[electricity]], are big themes in steampunk. 
 
 Important influences on steampunk are the Victorian  " [[scientific romance]]s " , the first [[science fiction]] novels. Authors like [[Jules Verne]] and [[H.G. Wells]] are still very popular. < ref name= " Neverwas Haul "  / >  Modern novels often cross-over with [[Goth subculture|Goth]] and [[vampire]] themes. 
 
 The fictional style has become an active 'scene' where steampunks dress in [[costume]] and attend meetings or [[convention]]s. This costume is a large part of the scene. Many steampunks spend lots of time sewing their own outfits, or collecting accessories such as [[hat]]s and [[goggles]]. The ''[[Maker]]'' movement involves many people who are both Makers and steampunks. < ref > {{Cite web

 Sometimes this aspect is expanded to include cultural ideas of the 19th and early 20th century, such as small items like clothing and accessories, or large objects such as locomotives (trains) or machines that have not even been invented yet, like airplanes.  
 
 == Steampunk themes in fiction == 
 Sometimes steampunk is used in stories to give a rough, gritty feel. This is typical of American steampunk stories, where many stories are set around the [[Old West]] or the [[American Civil War]].  
 
 British steampunk is a contrast to this. Instead it considers Victorian society as a more [[politeness|polite]] society and tries to re-create a world of politeness, [[etiquette]] and distinctions between [[social class|class]]es. 
 
 Neither flavour of steampunk cares too much about historical accuracy. The purpose is to have fun, not to accurately re-enact a period of real history. 
 
 == Favourite Steampunk machines == 
 Steampunks are very fond of particular machines and these keep re-appearing as themes in fiction or in costume. 
 * [[Time machine]]s 
 * [[Zeppelin]]s and [[airship]]s 
 * [[Ray gun]]s 
 * [[Robot]]s, especially robots that walk on legs. 
 
 === Costume === 
 * [[Goggles]] 
 : Goggles are one of the most popular pieces of steampunk costume. Part of  " the story "  for steampunks is their bravery in hazardous situations, either exploring remote and dangerous places, or experimenting in their [[laboratory]]. In both of these, goggles are essential protective equipment.  Steampunk goggles often have telescopic lenses or swivelling lenses on posts that can be rotated in front of the eyes. 
 * [[Hat]]s 
 : Hats are not often worn today, compared to the past, and so steampunks favour wearing them as an easy and distinctive piece of costume. Favourite hat styles are [[top hat]]s, [[pith helmet]]s and [[pickelhaube]]s. 
 * [[Boot]]s 
 * [[Gloves]] 
 : These range from ordinary gloves with gears and other accessories sewn on to give them a more technical appearance all the way to highly detailed mechanical hands. 
 * [[Ray guns]] 
 : Ray guns with ornate gearwork or tubing are popular. 
 * [[Accessories]] 
 : Victorian era accessories such as pocket watches, brass spyglasses, or walking sticks are also popular components of steampunk costumes.  Some outfits include large tanks worn on the back. 
 
 ; For ladies  
 * [[Corset]]s 
 : Female steampunk fans sometimes wear corsets on the outsides of their costumes, contrary to actual Victorian era fashions. 
 * [[Bustle]]s 
 * [[Jewelry]] 
 : Steampunk jewelry typically includes gears.  The octopus is a popular theme, perhaps inspired by the attack of the cuttlefish on the ''Nautilus'' in the Jules Verne story ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea''. 
 
 == Origins of the name == 
 The word  " steampunk "  is made of the root words  " [[steam]] "  and  " punk " . 
 
 A well-known [[science-fiction]] author [[William Gibson]], wrote books in the early 1980s that created the  " [[cyberpunk]] "  style. Later he, and the writer [[Bruce Sterling]], wrote one of the early steampunk novels ''[[The Difference Engine]]''. This book was popular and readers looked for a term to describe this new style. They chose  " steampunk " , from  " steam "  and  " cyberpunk " . 
 
 An alternate story is that the term was coined by writer [[K.W. Jeter]] in a letter to Faren Miller at ''Locus'' magazine. 
 
 == Derivative styles == 
 There are several related styles that have grown from steampunk. These usually have names ending in  " -punk " . The best known is  " Dieselpunk " , which is set in the 1930s. Like the Steampunk fondness for Victorian steam machines, Dieselpunks like the [[Modernist]] style of the 1930s, with polished aluminium aircraft and petrol or [[diesel engine]]s. 
 
 Another variety is set in the American frontier during the late 19th century.  The American 1960s television series ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' is a good example of this. 
 
 Paranormal steampunk includes legendary creatures such as werewolves or vampires and mixes horror with steampunk.
