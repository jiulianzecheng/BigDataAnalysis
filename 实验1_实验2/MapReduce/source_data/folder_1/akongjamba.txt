 == Legends == 
 Once Goddess [[Phouoibi]] ([[Fouoibi]]) set out for a journey along with [[Ngaleima]] and [[Thumleima]]. In [[Moirang]], when she was trying to cross a river, Akongjamba came to the place for hunting. He fell in love with [[Phouoibi]] at first sight. They became great lovers. < ref name= " Proceedings of North East India History Association - North East India History Association. Session - Google Books " / > < ref name= " Devi 2002 " / > 
 
 Many days later, [[Phouoibi]] went to Akongjamba's house, disguising herself as a tribal woman (''haonupi'' or ''haonubi''). Akongjamba was not at home. < ref name= " A History of Manipuri Literature - Ch Manihar Singh - Google Books " / >  Akongjamba's mother (''Akongjamba's wife'' in another version) didn't give her good shelter. She was about to hit [[Phouoibi]] (disguised as a tribal woman) with a broom. A divine being could lose his or her powers at the touch of profane objects like broom. So, [[Phouoibi]] fled to the coop of the house. She transformed into a chicken. Akongjamba's mother chased her. She counted the number of chickens. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L.

[[Phouoibi]] spent the night inside the dirty henhouse. On the next day, she once again assumed her true divine maiden form in a glowing dress. She called Akongjamba's mother to come out. She gave her the payment for spending a night at her place. She shook an enormous heap of golden grain off her body. The grains fell in the middle of the courtyard of the house. Then, she was gone to the south east direction. Akongjamba's mother was surprised at this. < ref name= " Proceedings of North East India History Association - North East India History Association.

 When Akongjamba returned home, he found the pile of golden grain as high as a hill in front of the courtyard. His mother narrated him the entire story. He realised that the strange lady was [[Phouoibi]], his ladylove. He immediately followed her path. On the way, he found her. He pleaded her to return home together. But she told him that they are not destined to unite to accomplish their work at that birth. Saying that, she left him. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L.
