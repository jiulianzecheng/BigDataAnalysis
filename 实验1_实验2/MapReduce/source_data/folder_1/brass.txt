 '''Brass''' is an [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]]. Some types of brass are called [[bronzes]]. 
 
 Brass has a golden appearance. It is harder than pure metals and resists [[corrosion]]. It costs more than [[zinc]]. 
 
 There are some common brasses: 
 * [[Alpha brass]]es - with less than 40% zinc 
 * [[Beta brass]]es -  
 * [[White brass]]es - with more than 45% zinc 
 
 Things brass are used to make include: 
 * [[Brass instrument]]s 
 * [[Ornament]]s 
 * [[Electricity|Electrical]] fittings 
 * [[Button]]s 
 * [[Screw]]s 
 * [[Tap (valve)|Tap]]s 
 * [[Hinge]]s 
 * [[Door handle|Door knobs]] 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Brass is more [[malleable]] than [[bronze]] or [[zinc]]. The [[melting point]] of brass can be 900 to 940 °C or 1,650 to 1,720 °F, depending on what it is made of. The [[density]] of brass is 8.4 to 8.73 g/cm < sup > 3 < /sup >  (0.303 to 0.315 lb/cu in). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Different Metals|url=https://www.simetric.co.uk/si_metals.htm|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.simetric.co.uk}} < /ref >   
 
 Today, almost 90% of all brass [[Alloy|alloys]] are [[Recycling|recycled]]. Brass is not [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. Brass [[scrap]] is collected and [[Transport|transported]] to the [[foundry]]. In the foundry, it is melted and recast into [[Billet|billets]]. The billets are heated and stretched into the form and size that is wanted. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXxGAAAAMAAJ|title=Newnes Engineer's Reference Book|last=Camm|first=Frederick James|date=1949|publisher=George Newnes|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Brass will [[corrode]] when it is exposed to moisture, [[Chloride|chlorides]], [[Acetate|acetates]], [[ammonia]], and some [[Acid|acids]].
