 The name of the river has nothing to do with the English word ''main'', which means ''most important'', or the French word ''main'', which means ''hand''. The river was named ''Mogin'' by the ancient [[celts]] after their god [[Mogon]]. Later, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] called the river ''Moenus'' in [[Latin language|their language]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], this name became ''Meyn'' and later ''Main''.
