 '''Calvinism''' belongs to the '''Reformed tradition''' of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]]. This tradition goes back to [[John Calvin]] and other [[Theology|theologians]]. 
 
 Important Calvinists from [[Europe]] include: [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and from [[England]], reformers [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[John Jewel]]. Because [[John Calvin]] had great influence and played an important role in the [[confession]]al and ecclesiastical debates throughout the [[17th century]], the tradition generally became known as '''Calvinism'''. 
 
 Today, this term also means the doctrines and practices of the [[Reformed churches]], of which Calvin was an early leader, and the system is perhaps best known for its doctrines of [[predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] and [[total depravity]]. 
 
 ==Background== 
 [[John Calvin]]'s international influence on the development of the doctrines of the [[Protestant Reformation]] began at the age of 25, when he started work on his first edition of the ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' in [[1534]] (published [[1536]]). He also contributed to confessional documents for use in churches, and his beliefs and practices left a direct influence on [[Protestantism]]. He was only one of many people to influence the doctrines of the Reformed churches, but he eventually became one of the most prominent [[wikt:theologian|theologians]]. 
 
 The rising importance of the Reformed churches and Calvin appened in the second phase of the [[Protestant Reformation]], when evangelical churches began to form, after [[Martin Luther]], another important Reformer, had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Calvin was a French exile in [[Geneva City]]. He had signed the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] in [[1540]], but his importance came from the Swiss Reformation. It was not [[Lutheran]] but followed [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and then Calvin. 
 
 True Calvinism (historical Calvinism) does not teach that God chooses the people who will be saved. Instead, it teaches that for God's own glory recreates men with a new nature,  a nature that loves God and hates sin, instead of men keeping their old nature since if they kept their old nature, they would not want to follow God.(Romans 3:10-12). Historical Calvinism also teaches that if God does not choose to save someone, he can do nothing to be saved. 
 
 ===Spread=== 
 Although much of Calvin's practice was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the [[theology]] of most Christians in [[Scotland]] (see [[John Knox]]), the [[Netherlands]], and parts of [[Germany]], and it was influential also in [[France]], [[Hungary]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Poland]]. Calvinism was popular as well for some time in [[Scandinavia]], especially [[Sweden]], but it was rejected in favor of [[Lutheranism]] after the Synod of [[Uppsala]] in [[1593]]. 
 
 Most settlers in the [[Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]], in the [[United Stages]], were Calvinists, including the [[Puritan]]s and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (now New York). Dutch Calvinist settlers also began to be the first successful European colonizers of [[South Africa]] in the [[17th century]] and became known as [[Boer]]s or [[Afrikaner]]s. 
 
 Some of the largest Calvinist communions [[missionary|missionaries]] were started in the [[19th century|19th]] and the [[20th century]], especially in [[Korea]] and in [[Nigeria]].
