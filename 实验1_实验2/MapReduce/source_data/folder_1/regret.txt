{{emotion}} 
 '''Regret''' is the [[emotion]] of wishing one had made a different decision in the past, because the effect of the decision were not good. 
 
 Regret is related to a missed opportunity. Its intensity changes over time after the decision. 
 
 Regret is different than [[remorse]] because people can regret things beyond their control, but remorse is about a sense of responsibility for the situation. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Citation|last=McConnell|first=Terrance|title=Moral Dilemmas|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/moral-dilemmas/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-07-03}} < /ref >
