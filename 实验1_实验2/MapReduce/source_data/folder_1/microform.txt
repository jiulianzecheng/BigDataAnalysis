'''Microform''' is a name given to special [[photographic film]]s. Microforms contain reduced [[image]]s of [[document]]s. Usually, documents stored on microform are reduced about 25 times. Microform is mainly used for archival purposes. 
 
 There are three common formats: 
 *'''Microfilm''', which comes in [[reel]]s of film. 
 *'''Aperture card''', This contains additional digital data (as a [[punch card]]). 
 *'''Microfiche''', a flat sheet with many pages. 
 
 Properly stored (room temperature, 50% humidity), microform should be able to last up to 500 years.
