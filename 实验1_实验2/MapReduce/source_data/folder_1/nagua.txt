 '''Nagua''' is a [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[city]] and the head [[municipality]] of the [[María Trinidad Sánchez Province|María Trinidad Sánchez]] [[province]], on the northeast ([[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]) [[coast]] of the country. 
 It was a town of [[Fishing|fishermen]] that became a city in the second half of the 20th century. The city of Nagua is almost at sea level. 
 
 ==Population== 
 The [[municipality]] had, in {{Metadata Population Dominican province|YEAR}}, a total population of 40,611: 20,055 men and 20,556 women. The urban population was {{percentage|38540|40611|1 }} of the total population. < ref name= " r-pop "  / > 
 
 ==History== 
 Nagua was a small town close to the place where the river Nagua gets into the sea and that is the reason of its old name: ''Boca de Nagua'' (in [[English language|English]],  " Nagua's Mouth " ); it was part of the old municipality of Matanzas, Duarte province. 
 
 It was created a municipality in 1938 with the name ''Villa Julia Molina'' (Julia Molina was the mother of the [[dictator]] [[Rafael Trujillo]]). On 4 August 1946 there was a [[tsunami]] that destroyed the city of Matanzas and Villa Julia Molina became the main city of the region. < ref > {{cite book

 In 1945 the municipality became part of the Samaná province. With the creation of the new province of  " Julia Molina "  (now María Trinidad Sánchez), Villa Julia Molina became the head municipality of the province. The name of the city was changed to Nagua in 1961, after Trujillo's death. < ref > {{cite book
