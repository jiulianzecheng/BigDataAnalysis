'''Micronations''' are countries started by one or a group of people which are not seen as actual countries by the [[United Nations]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=micronation {{!}} Law, Recognition, History,  &  Definition|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/micronation|access-date=2021-05-18|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref >  Some of these countries are mostly on the internet or exist in a physical location but are not serious states with legitimate reason to exist. Some are taken seriously and even exist for legitimate reasons but are not recognized as independent countries for various political and diplomatic reasons. It is important to note that micronations are different from [[List of states with limited recognition|partially-recognised countries]] and [[Separatism|separatist territories]], which often have full autonomy over their territories.  
 
 People make micronations for lots of reasons. Some are to show they do not like their main country (for example the [[United Kingdom]]), or if they want to make money, or to use it as a place for themselves. Some want a different kind of government than their country currently has, such as a micronationalist declaring independence from USA to build a tiny communist or socialist state. Micronations create their own rules, but because they are not recognised as actual countries, they have to keep within the laws of their home country. 
 
 Some of the more famous micronations include the [[Republic of Molossia]], the Islamic Sultanate of Qarsherskiy, [[Sealand]], the Aerican Empire, and Eternia. And some new one like [[suslandia]].

 ==Competitions== 
 Some micronations play in competitions. 
 ===Football=== 
 The biggest football organisation for micronations is known as the '''MFA''' ''(Micronational Football Association)'', founded by Joe Foxon in 2009. It has 13 micronations from 7 countries as members. It makes a competition every 4 years called the MFA World Cup for all the micronations in the world to play in. The first World Cup will be in Southern [[England]] in 2013. 
 ===Chess=== 
 Every year there is a chess competition for micronations to play in. It is played on the computer and in the first year, 3 micronations took part. 
 
 ===Singing=== 
 Every year there is a singing competition called the '''MicroVision Song Contest'''. Micronations make a song and put it on the internet, and then other micronations vote for the best song. The winner then makes the next one.
