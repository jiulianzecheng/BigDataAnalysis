 '''''Castorocauda''''' was a [[genus]] of small, semi-aquatic proto-[[mammal]]s which lived in the [[Jurassic]] period, about 154 million years ago.  
 
 Its [[fossil]] was found in [[lake]]bed [[sediment]]s of the [[Daohugou Beds]] of [[Inner Mongolia]]. ''Castorocauda'' was highly specialized, with [[adaptations]] like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as [[beaver]]s, [[otter]]s, and the [[platypus]] ([[convergent evolution]]). It is the earliest animal found with [[fur]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/02/0223_060223_beaver.html | title=Jurassic  " beaver "  found; rewrites history of mammals}} < /ref > < ref name=Ji2/ > 
 
 ''Castorocauda'' is one of the near-[[mammals]] in a group called the [[Docodonta]]. < ref name=Ji2 > {{cite journal|last=Ji Q.

 Although ''Castorocauda'' was not a [[crown group]] mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a  " small nocturnal insectivore " . < ref name=Ji2/ > 
 *It was larger than most [[Mesozoic]] mammaliaform fossils {{ndash}} about {{convert|17|in|cm|abbr=on}} from its nose to the tip of its {{convert|5|in|adj=on}} tail, and may have weighed {{convert|500|-|800|g|abbr=on}}. 
 *It is the earliest absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Previously the earliest was ''[[Eomaia]]'', a crown group mammal from about 125M years ago. 
 *It had aquatic [[adaptations]] including flattened tail bones and remnants of soft tissue between the toes of the back feet, suggesting that they were webbed. Previously the earliest known semi-aquatic mammaliaforms were from the [[Eocene]], about 110 million years later. 
 *''Castorocauda'''s powerful forelimbs look adapted for digging. This feature and the spurs on its ankles make it resemble the [[platypus]], which also swims and digs. 
 *Its teeth look adapted for eating fish: the first two molars had cusps in a straight row, which made them more suitable for gripping and slicing than for grinding. These molars are curved backwards, which helps in grasping slippery prey.
