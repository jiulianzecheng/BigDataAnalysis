 '''Halabja''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: Helebce, هەڵەبجە) is a [[city]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], the capital of the Halabja Governorate. It is {{convert|240|km|mi}} northeast of [[Baghdad]]. 
 
 ==Poison gas attack== 
 The city is known for an incident in the final phase of the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. The Kurdish [[peshmerga]] guerrillas, supported by [[Iran]], took control of the city. On March 16, 1988, after two days of ordinary [[artillery]] attacks, Iraqi Air Force planes dropped gas canisters on the town. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/15032017|title=Remembering Victims of Genocide: The Chemical Attack on Halabja 1988|website=Rudaw}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/16/newsid_4304000/4304853.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1988: Thousands die in Halabja gas attack |date=1988-03-16 |access-date=2010-05-04}} < /ref >  The town and surrounding district were attacked with bombs, artillery fire and [[chemical weapons]], the last of which proved most damaging. At least 5,000 people died as an immediate result of the chemical attack. It is estimated that a further 7,000 people were injured or suffered long-term illness. < ref > {{cite news |author=Osman, Hiwa |date=March 17, 2002|title=Iraqi Kurds recall chemical attack |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1877161.stm |access-date=2006-08-05}} < /ref >  Most of the victims of the attack on the town of Halabja were Kurdish civilians. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1991/IRAQ913.htm|title=Whatever Happened To The Iraqi Kurds? |date=March 11, 1991|publisher=Human Rights Watch}} < /ref > 
 
 The attack is believed to have included the [[nerve agent]]s [[Tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]], [[Sarin]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], as well as [[mustard gas]]. Another possibility, according to the former senior CIA analyst Stephen C. Pelletiere, is that Iraq did not have the nerve agent to use in the attack but did have mustard gas which had been used in the Iran–Iraq War. It is occasionally suggested < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts About Cyanide|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415140426/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|archive-date=15 April 2010|df=dmy-all}} < /ref >  that [[cyanide]] was also included among these chemical weapons, though this assertion has been cast into doubt, as cyanide is a natural byproduct of impure Tabun. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/02/iraq_events/html/chemical_warfare.stm |title=Iraq events – Chemical warfare |publisher=BBC News |access-date=2010-05-04}} < /ref >  The attack on Halabja took place amidst the [[Anfal campaign]], in which [[Saddam Hussein]] powerfully suppressed Kurdish revolts during the Iran–Iraq War. 
 
 Before the war ended, Iraqi forces moved in on the ground and completely destroyed the town. < ref > {{cite news |author=Hirst, David|date=March 22, 1988|title=The Kurdish victims caught unaware by cyanide |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1251881,00.html |access-date=2006-06-09 |location=London}} < /ref >  In March 2010, the Iraqi High Criminal Court recognized the Halabja massacre as [[genocide]].
