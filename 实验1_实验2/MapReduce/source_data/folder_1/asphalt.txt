 '''Asphalt''', or '''bitumen''',  is a sticky, black and highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid, composed almost entirely of [[petroleum]]. < ref > Holleran, Glynn and Jeffrey Reed. [http://www.slurry.com/index.php/magazine-articles/177-asphalt-emulsions-definition-manufacture-and-usage.html  Asphalt emulsions - definition, manufacture and usage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615040549/http://www.slurry.com/index.php/magazine-articles/177-asphalt-emulsions-definition-manufacture-and-usage.html |date=2013-06-15 }}; retrieved 2012-4-25. < /ref >   It is present in most crude [[petroleum]]s and in some natural deposits. It is the material which made the [[La Brea tar pits]]. 
 
 Its main use is in road construction. Mixed with  " aggregate "  ([[sand]], [[gravel]], crushed stone, etc.) it makes a good road surface. It has various other names: pitch, tarmac, blacktop, [[asphalt concrete]], asphalt pavement (US), all mean roughly the same thing. 
 
 Asphalt which is liquid is often called [[tar]]. Tar is also used for plant [[resin]]. Solid asphalt is often called [[pitch (resin)|pitch]].  
 
 Although  a block of asphalt or pitch can look like a solid, it still flows, but very slowly. There have been a few  " pitch experiments "  to see how long it takes for a drip to form and drop off a block of apparently solid pitch.
