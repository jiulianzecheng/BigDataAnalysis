 '''Potassium''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]]. It has the [[symbol]] '''K'''. This symbol is taken from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''kalium''. Potassium's [[atomic number]] is 19. It has 19 [[proton]]s and [[electrons]]. Potassium is not found as an element in nature, because it is so reactive. 
 
 Potassium has two stable [[isotope]]s, with 20 or 22 [[neutron]]s. Its [[atomic mass]] is 39.098. The unstable isotope with 21 neutrons is one of the most common [[radioactive]] materials. 
 
 == Properties == 
 === Physical properties === 
 Potassium is a soft gray [[metal]]. It can be cut easily with a knife. Its melting point is 63 degrees Celsius (145.4 degrees Fahrenheit). It melts at a very low temperature. It is an [[alkali metal]]. It is the second lightest metal, after [[lithium]].

[[Hydrogen]] is liberated. The pink or lilac flame comes from burning potassium vapor.

 Potassium reacts in many chemical [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] similar to [[sodium]] and other alkali metals. It [[tarnish]]es in air to produce a whitish [[oxidation|oxidized]] layer on the surface. This is why it is stored in [[oil]]. It also reacts very fast with water, which is another reason for its storage in oil. The hydrogen produced during its reaction with water can burst into flames when a large amount of potassium is added to water. [[Potassium hydroxide]] is also produced. Potassium also burns in air easily, to make the peroxide or the superoxide. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 [[File:Flame Test K.jpg|thumb|Potassium chloride in a flame]] 
 Potassium compounds are only in one [[oxidation state]]: +1. Potassium ions are colorless and similar to sodium ions. [[Potassium chloride]] can be used as a [[wikt:substitute|substitute]] for table salt. [[Potassium hydroxide]] is used in the [[electrolyte]] of [[alkaline cell]]s. Most potassium compounds are nontoxic. If they are toxic, it is because of the anion. [[Potassium chromate]] is colored because of the chromate, not the potassium. Potassium chromate is toxic because of the chromate, not the potassium.

 ==Name== 
 The word potassium comes from the word  " potash " . Potash is a mixture of [[potassium carbonate]] and [[potassium hydroxide]] that has been used for a very long time. In past centuries potash was made from ashes in pots. It is used to make [[fertilizer]], [[soap]], and [[glass]]. 
 
 == Occurrence == 
 Potassium does not occur in nature because it is too reactive. It is found in [[mineral]]s, though. It is extracted from them by [[electrolysis]] of [[potassium hydroxide]] or [[potassium chloride]]. The potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride has to be melted at a very high temperature. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Potassium metal is used to absorb water from [[solvent]]s. It is also used in some scientific instruments. 
 
 Potassium compounds are used in [[soap]], [[fertilizer]], [[explosive]]s, and [[match]]es. 
 
 === Nutrition === 
 Potassium [[ion]]s are very important to [[organism]]s. That is why fertilizers have potassium compounds in them. The ions send messages from [[cell]]s to other cells. It helps [[biology|biological]] [[membrane]]s ''depolarize''. This means go from a negative to a positive [[electrical charge]]. This is needed for [[muscle]]s to ''contract'' (get shorter and move things.) It is needed for the [[heart]] to ''beat'' (push [[blood]] through [[blood vessel]]s.) If the potassium level in the blood is too high or too low it can cause death because the heart stops. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Whelton|first1=P.|last2=He|first2=J.|last3=Cutler|first3=J.|last4=Brancati|first4=F.|last5=Appel|first5=L.|last6=Follmann|first6=D.|last7=Klag|first7=M.|date=1997|title=Effects of oral potassium on blood pressure.

 == Safety == 
 Potassium metal is very dangerous and can form an explosive coating if it is kept in air. It also reacts violently with water, spewing corrosive liquid. Potassium compounds are not normally dangerous, unless they contain a toxic [[anion]] like [[chromate]] or [[chlorate]].
