 '''Tarasp''' was a [[municipality]] in the [[district]] of [[Inn (district)|Inn]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Graubünden]]. Its eleven settlements are situated within the Lower [[Engadin]] valley along the [[Inn (river)|Inn River]], at the foot of the [[Sesvenna Range]]. On 1 January 2015, the former municipalities of [[Ardez]], [[Guarda, Switzerland|Guarda]], Tarasp, [[Ftan]] and [[Sent]] merged into the municipality of [[Scuol]]. < ref > [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/03.html Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office {{in lang|de}} accessed 27 April 2016 < /ref > 
 
 Originally a [[Romansh language]] area, the majority of the population today speaks [[High Alemannic German]]. Unlike the surrounding municipalities, the Tarasp parish is mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].
