 A '''prince''' is a [[male]] member of a [[royal family]]. The female version of this title is called a [[princess]]. Different countries have different rules based on who is a prince.  
 
 == Types of princes == 
 The title of  " prince "  is different depending on the country. Each royal family has its own rules saying who is called a prince.  
 
 === Crown Prince ===

 A '''crown prince''' (female: '''crown princess''') is the [[heir apparent]] of a country. This means that he is the person who will become [[king]] after the current king dies.  
 
 Most of the time, the crown prince is the son of a king but can also be a close relative if the king has no children.  
 
 In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]], the crown prince is given their own unique title, such as [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Prince of Asturias]].  
 
 In addition, the siblings of a crown prince can also be called princes or princesses, even though they are not the heir to the throne. The siblings often continue to be called  " prince "  and  " princess "  even after the crown prince becomes king. 
 
 For example, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Prince Edward]] and [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] all have the title of prince even though their brother, [[Charles III|Charles]] was the crown prince (and now the king). 
 
 === Prince Consort ===

 A '''prince consort''' is the title of the husband of a [[Queen|Ruling Queen]] in many monarchies.  
 
 Unlike kings, whose wives are called queens, the husband of a ruling Queen is called a prince.  
 
 This is because historically, the title of  " king "  is seen as a higher rank than queen. Because the Queen Regnant is the monarch of her country, nobody can be given a  " higher "  title. For this reason, her husband is called a prince consort. 
 
 Some countries, however, do allow the husband of a queen to be titled  " king consort " . But this is very rare. 
 
 === Sovereign Prince ===

 A '''sovereign prince''' (also known as a '''ruling prince''', '''reigning prince''' or '''prince regnant''') is the ruler of a [[monarchy]] known as a [[principality]].  
 
 This is mainly to do with size, because principalities were considered too small to become actual [[Kingdom|kingdoms]], [[Duchy|duchies]] or [[Empire|empires]]. 
 
 The most famous principality is [[Monaco]]. This is because throughout Monaco's history, they were always allied with a country much larger and more powerful. For this reason, the rulers of Monaco did not call themselves kings and queens.
