'''Radiodonta''' is an extinct [[Order (biology)|order]] of ancient arthropods that was successful during the [[Cambrian]] period. They can be called radiodonts and radiodontans along with other names. 
 
 Radiodonts are identified by distinct [[Appendage|appendages]] on their faces, which are diverse and can do a lot of things. Some of the earliest top predators, such as ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' are Radiodonts, but some others, such as ''[[Aegirocassis]]'' were [[filter feeder]]s, eating by filtering food out of the water around them.
