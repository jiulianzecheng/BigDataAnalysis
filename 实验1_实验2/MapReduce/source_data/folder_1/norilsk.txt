 '''Norilsk''' is a city in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] in [[Siberia]], with almost 180,000 people. It lies about {{Convert|300|km||abbr=}} north of the [[arctic circle]], and over  {{Convert|1500|km||abbr=}} north of [[Krasnoyarsk]].  There are many [[ore]] deposits in the region, especially [[nickel]] and [[copper]]. [[Mining]] ore is linked to heavy [[pollution]] of the environment. Norilsk was founded in 1935 as a site of [[industry]], to be able to mine the ore. In 1939, the decision was taken to also build a city. Norilsk got the status of a city in 1953. 
 
 Norilsk is the northernmost city with more than 100.000 inhabitants. It is the second largest city within the arctic circle, only [[Murmansk]] is larger. Norilsk and [[Yakutsk]] are the only large cities built in the continuous permafrost zone. This means that even in summer, the ground remains frozen. 
 
 The [[nickel]] deposits of Norilsk-Talnakh are the largest-known nickel-[[copper]]-[[palladium]] deposits in the world.  The [[smelting]] of the nickel ore is directly responsible for severe pollution, which generally comes in the form of [[acid rain]] and [[smog]]. By some estimates, one percent of global [[sulfur dioxide]] emission comes from Norilsk's nickel mines. < ref name= " Norilsk, Siberia " > {{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1124.html|title=Norilsk, Siberia|date=November 30, 2015|publisher=NASA|access-date=8 February 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 Norilsk is a closed city. This means that a special [[permit]] is needed to be able to travel to Norilsk. This permit is  issued both by the Russian government, and the local mining comany. Foreigners usually do not get this permit.

 Norilsk can only be reached by [[airplane]], or by [[boat]].There is a [[Norilsk railway|railway line]], which connects the city to [[Dudinka]], on the river [[Yenisei]]. The airport lies about {{Convert|34|km||abbr=}} west of the ciry. Dudinka is about {{Convert|90|km||abbr=}} to the west. It is a large [[port]] on the river Yenisei. While at first, there was only the railway, a road to Dudinka has been built. The raiway now only handles freight.

 On 29 May 2020 a [[Fuel oil|fuel]] reservoir collapsed, flooding the nearby [[Ambarnaya River]] with 20,000 tonnes of [[diesel fuel]]. The reservoir was the property of the local mining company, a Nornickel subsidiary, NTEK. Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] declared a state of emergency. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/03/vladimir-putin-orders-state-of-emergency-huge-fuel-spill-siberia-power-plant-kerch|title=Putin orders state of emergency after huge fuel spill inside Arctic Circle|date=June 3, 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 4, 2020}} < /ref >   The fuel was a reserve used as a backup for the main gas supply to a power plant. < ref > {{citation|url=http://siberiantimes.com/other/others/news/state-of-emergency-in-norilsk-after-20000-tons-of-diesel-leaks-into-arctic-river-system/|newspaper=The Siberian Times|title=State of emergency in Norilsk after 20,000 tons of diesel leaks into Arctic river system|author=Svetlana Skarbo|date=2 June 2020}} < /ref >  The storage tank was built on [[permafrost]]. According to a statement by the company, the permafrost could possibly have melted and become unstable because of [[climate change]]. An area of 350 square kilometres (135 square miles) has been [[contamination|contaminated]]. It will be difficult to clean this because there are no roads and the river is too shallow for boats and [[barge]]s. [[Oleg Mitvol]] estimates that the clean-up will cost about 100 billion rubles (1.5 billion US$) and take 5â€“10 years. < ref name= " BBC " > {{citation|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52915807|title=Russia's Putin declares state of emergency after Arctic Circle oil spill|publisher=BBC|date=4 June 2020}} < /ref >
