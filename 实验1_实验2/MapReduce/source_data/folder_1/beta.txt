 {{Greek alphabet|letter=beta}} 
 '''Beta''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Β β'''), is a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used to represent the  " b "  sound in [[Ancient Greek]] and  " v "  in [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 2. Letters that came from it include the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] [[B]] and [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] [[Б]]. 
 
 The sounds [b] and [v] resemble each other a lot. In Ancient Greek the  " b "  sound became  " v "  around 200 BC. Therefore, the letter B means the  " v "  sound in the Cyrillic alphabet, and a new letter, Б, was made for [b].  
 
 The letter beta is also used in [[finance]], [[science]] and [[mathematics]]. For example. the [[beta function]] is named after the capital letter Β, and the probability of [[Type I and type II errors|type II error]] in [[statistics]] is written with the lowercase β. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-20|title=Greek/Hebrew/Latin-based Symbols in Mathematics|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/|access-date=2020-10-02|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Greek alphabet letters  &  symbols (α,β,γ,δ,ε,...)|url=https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/greek_alphabet.html|access-date=2020-10-02|website=www.rapidtables.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Beta Symbol in Greek Alphabet|url=https://www.greeksymbols.net/beta-symbol|access-date=2020-10-02|website=www.greeksymbols.net|language=en}} < /ref >
