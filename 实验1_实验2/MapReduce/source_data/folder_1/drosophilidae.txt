The '''Drosophilidae''' is a huge, widespread  ([[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]]) [[family (biology)|family]] of [[fly|flies]], which includes the famous '''fruit flies'''. The family has over 4000 [[species]] in 75 [[genera]]. < ref name=Markow/ >  A recent publication lists the species: < ref > Yassin, Amir 2013.

'''38''' (2): 349â€“364.[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2012.00665.x] < /ref > 
 
 There is another unrelated family of flies, the [[Tephritidae]], which includes species also known as  " fruit flies " . 
 
 The best known species of the Drosophilidae is ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. This species and its relatives are often used for studies on  [[genetics]], [[development]], [[physiology]], and [[behaviour]]. < ref > Ashburner  M; Golic K  &  Hawley S  2005.

 ''D. melanogaster'' is not so much studied in the field as in the laboratory. The best-known studies of ''Drosophila'' in a natural environment was done by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]] and colleagues on ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'' from the early 1930s to  1970. Reprints and discussions are in Lewontin ''et al'' 2003, < ref > Lewontin R.C; Moore, John C; Provine W.B.  &  Wallace B. (eds) 2003. ''Dobzhansky's genetics of natural populations I{{ndash}}XVIII''. New York: Columbia University Press. < /ref >  and theoretical discussions in Dobzhansky, 1970. < ref > Dobzhansky T. 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. New York: Columbia University Press. < /ref > 
 
 The cells of fruit flies usually do not divide after the imago is hatched. The fruit fly is mostly composed of [[mitosis|post-mitotic]] cells, has a very short lifespan, and shows gradual [[ageing]]. As in other species, temperature influences the life history of the animal. They live longer in colder weather. Several genes can be manipulated to extend the lifespan of these insects. 
 
 The Drosophilidae has two subfamilies, the [[Drosophilinae]] and the [[Steganinae]]. < ref name=Markow > Markow, Therese A. and O'Grady, Patrick 2005. ''Drosophila: a guide to species identification and use''.  Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-473052-3 < /ref >
