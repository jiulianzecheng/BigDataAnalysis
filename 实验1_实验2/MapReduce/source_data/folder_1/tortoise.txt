 A '''tortoise''' is a [[reptile]] of the order [[Turtle|Testudines]] which lives on land.  Like their aquatic cousins, the [[sea turtle]]s, tortoises are shielded from [[predator]]s by a shell. Most are quite small, but island tortoises have several times evolved to a [[giant tortoise|large size]]: those on the [[Galapagos]] are famous. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] made one of his rare mistakes when he did not note which island each of them came from. Later it became clear that they were slightly different on different islands.
