 In the early 1960s, Giorgio Carbona claimed that Seborga was historically a principality and was not formally included in the [[1861]] [[Italian unification]]. As such, he claimed that the town and its surrounding territory was an independent country from Italy. He was elected as the Prince of Seborga. 
 
 There has been no formal recognition of Giorgio Carbone's claims and no country currently recognises Seborga, making it a [[micronation]].
