 '''Cinnamon''' is a [[spice]] from the inner bark of ''[[Cinnamomum]] verum''. 
 
 The spice is used in both [[Taste#Sweetness|sweet]] and [[savoury]] foods. It is aromatic. People usually put cinnamon in sweet baked goods (such as cinnamon rolls), hot [[wine]] or liquors. 
 
 Cinnamon was used to make the spiced [[wine]], [[claret]], in the Middle Ages. In India, cinnamon is commonly used in making flavoured tea. It is either directly added as small pieces or put in powdered form during the preparation of tea. It is known as  " Daal-Cheeni (दाल चीनि) "  in [[Hindi]]. 
 
 The Sinhalese name of cinnamon is ''kurundu''. Cinnamon is grown as an export crop in Sri Lanka.
