 A '''building''' is an enclosed [[structure]], particularly one constructed of solid materials, with some kind of [[roof]] and [[wall]]s. Types include: 
 
 '''Residential buildings''' are constructed as [[dwelling]]s. These are where people primarily [[sleep]] and do other domestic activities. Examples include [[apartment]] blocks and [[house]]s. 
 
 '''Commercial buildings''' are for operating [[business]]es in. Examples include [[restaurant]]s, [[Shop|store]]s and [[office]] buildings. 
 
 [[Hotel]]s and [[motel]]s are in a category of building that is both residential (in that people sleep there), and commercial as they are businesses. 
 
 '''Religious buildings''' are places of worship. Examples include [[mosque]]s, [[temple]]s, and [[Church (building)|church]]es. 
 
 '''Industrial buildings''' are where different types of [[industry]] take place, such as [[manufacturing]]. Examples of an industrial building include a [[warehouse]] or [[factory]] or [[workshop]]. 
 
 '''Residential institutional''' - Buildings that are residential [[institution]]s are facilities that house people who can't live in the general population of the society due to [[crime]]s they committed, inability to take care of themselves, lack of an [[income]] or currently undergoing a residential treatment or training program. [[Prison]]s, [[poorhouse]]s, [[psychiatric hospital]]s, [[nursing home]]s, college [[residence hall]]s and [[military]] [[barracks]] all are examples of residential institutional facilities. 
 
 '''Governmental''', '''utility''' and '''public buildings''' - in which official [[government]] functions are conducted. Examples include [[courthouse]]s, [[legislative]] offices, [[power plant]]s, [[storage shed]]s and [[post office]]s 
 
 == Parts == 
 By putting a [[window]] in a wall with or without [[glass]], we let light inside the building. We leave a hole somewhere big enough to go in and out, with a [[door]] which can be opened and closed. Often the door will have a [[lock]] so the building can be left secure. 
 
 If a building is to last for a long time, it must have a solid [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]. This foundation is like the root of a tree, which is sunk a bit deep into the ground and supports the walls. If the ground is soft, the foundation must be very deep and strong so that the building can have a strong contact with the ground.

 A tall building can have more than one [[floor]]. People can climb from one floor to the next by a [[staircase]], or perhaps by a [[lift]] or [[elevator]]. This is known as going upstairs, or downstairs. Buildings can also have one or more floors under the ground. This is usually called a [[cellar]] or [[basement]]. 
 
 Buildings can be beautiful or ugly, exciting or boring. [[Architects]] are people trained to design buildings. Their work is called [[architecture]] and it can be an art form. There are many [[Architectural style|architectural styles]].  
 
 Look at the building where you are reading this. Look at the shapes and shadows. Is there enough light? Do some rooms make you feel like staying in them while others make you want to hurry away? Do they have interesting features? Think about how you could have made the building better. Almost anybody can become an architect if they want to. But only a good architect or a good builder can design or build a beautiful building.  
 
 Temporary formwork has been used in construction since ancient times. The history of the development of formwork technologies is closely related to the evolution of architectural forms. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://capitalstroy77.ru/vidy-i-harakteristiki-opalubki-sten/ |title=Construction of buildings. |access-date=2023-01-19 |archive-date=2023-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230119213127/https://capitalstroy77.ru/vidy-i-harakteristiki-opalubki-sten/ |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 Collectively, buildings, bridges and roads are known as the [[built environment]] 
 
 ==Types of buildings== 
 [[Shelter|Shelters]] are places to live (residential buildings). We also build places to work and to make things, places to store things, places to sell things, places where sick people can go to be treated, places to put people who break our laws. We build to do many things.  
 
 Some buildings are meeting places. A large number of people can gather at a [[temple]] or [[theater]] or [[stadium]] to worship god or to hear or see what other people say or do. In [[Christendom]] they are called [[Church (building)|church]]es. Until we began to build [[skyscrapers]], religious buildings were usually the largest, tallest buildings in a town. [[Fortress]] < nowiki/ > es and [[castle]]s were also big but usually were not in town. Big buildings require much work to make, thus can symbolize power. They impress and they give a focus to cities. 
 
 Buildings are made of various materials. Where [[wood]] is plentiful, it is much used. Many very old buildings of [[stone]] exist. [[Concrete]] is used almost everywhere. Starting in the late 19th century, skyscrapers were made of [[steel]], increasingly combined with [[glass]].
