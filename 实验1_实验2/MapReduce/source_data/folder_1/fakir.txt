{{Sufism}} 
 A '''fakir''' or '''faqir''', is a [[Sufi]] who [[perform]]s feats of [[endurance]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The word comes from ''faqr'' ({{lang-ar|فقر}}), meaning  " poverty " . < ref > ''God Speaks'', Meher Baba, Dodd Meade, 1955, 2nd Ed. p. 305 < /ref > 
 
 In English, the word is often used for  Sufi mystics. It can also be used to for a common street [[beggar]] who chants [[holy]] names, [[scripture]]s or verses.  It has become a common [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] word for  " beggar " . 
 
 Many [[stereotype]]s of the great fakir exist, including a near-naked man easily [[fire-walking|walking barefoot on burning coals]], sitting or [[sleeping]] on a bed of sharp nails, floating in the air while [[meditation|meditating]], or  " living on air "  (refusing all food).
