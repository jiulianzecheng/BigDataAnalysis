 The '''Charites''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ᵻ|t|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Χάριτες}}, ''Khárites''; sing. Χάρις), also known as the '''Graces''', are three minor goddesses of charm, beauty, grace and splendor in [[Greek mythology]]. They were the daughters of [[Zeus]] and [[Eurynome]], and served as handmaidens of [[Aphrodite]], goddess of love and beauty. In [[Roman mythology]] they are known as the '''Gratiae''' (the “Graces”). They are often shown in [[sculpture]]s and [[mosaic]]s as three naked women, holding hands and dancing in a circle. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Kharites.html |title=Charites : The Graces, Goddesses of Pleasure and Joy  |work=theoi.com |year=2011 |access-date=27 May 2012}} < /ref >  Their names are Euphrosyne ( " the light-hearted one " ), Thalia ( " the flowering one " ), and Aglaia ( " the shining one " ).
