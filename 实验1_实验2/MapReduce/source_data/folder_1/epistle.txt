 An '''epistle''' (from the {{lang-el|ἐπιστολή}}, ''epistolē'', meaning  " letter " ) is a [[writing]] sent to a person or group of people. It is usually written as a formal [[Letter (paper)|letter]]. It was common in [[ancient Egypt]], being taught to [[scribe]]s. The letters in the [[New Testament]] from [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] to [[Early Christianity|Christians]] are usually referred to as epistles. Those letters said to have been written by [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are known as the [[Pauline epistles]] and the others as the [[General epistles]]. 
 
 The epistles of [[Cicero]], and of [[Pliny the Younger]] tell a lot about life at the time of the Romans. [[Ovid]] produced a number of letters while he was in [[exile]] at coast of the [[Black Sea]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s letters influenced many epistle-writers of later times.
