 == Place == 
 The border disagreement along the [[Danube]] River valley started in 1947 but was left unresolved during the existence of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. After the country of Yugoslavia broke apart, the disagreement became more prominent. Serbia claims the thalweg of the Danube valley and the center line of the river is the [[international border]] between the two countries. The Croatian government disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the old lines of the [[cadastre|cadastral municipalities]] along the river — as the Danube was in the 19th century before [[meander]]ing and [[hydraulic engineering]] works changed its course. As a result, Croatia claims a large part of the area controlled by Serbia, while Serbia does not claim the smaller parts on the other side. 
 
 President Jedlička says that the land claimed for Liberland, known as ''Gornja & nbsp;Siga'' (meaning ''upper [[tufa]]''), remains unclaimed by Croatia or Serbia. < ref name= " LiberlandInfo "  / > < ref name=Vice-Nolan/ > < ref name= " novinky-1 " / > 
 
 The area is about {{convert|7|km2|mi2}}, and most of it is covered with forests. A journalist from the Czech newspaper ''Parlamentní listy'' who visited the area in April 2015 found a house that had been abandoned for about thirty years, according to people living in the vicinity. The access road was reported to be in a bad condition. < ref name= " radimpanenka " > {{cite news|last1=Panenka|first1=Radim|title=Navštívili jsme nový stát Liberland, který v Evropě založil Čech Vít Jedlička.

Due to differences in the border definitions, the yellow-colored parts to the east are claimed by both [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]]. Croatia asserts that the green parts are part of Serbia, but Serbia does not claim them. This led Jedlička to assert that the green parts have remained unclaimed by both sides.]] 
 The flag ceremony in Gornja Siga was performed by [[Vít Jedlička]] and others on the same day the statehood of Liberland was proclaimed. < ref name= " ParlamentniListy-interview " > {{cite news|last1=Koulová|first1=Zuzana|title=On to myslí vážně!

 Jedlička stated that neither Serbia, Croatia nor any other nation claims the land (no-man's land or ''[[terra nullius]]''). The border, he argued, was defined according to both Croatian and Serbian border claims and did not interfere with any other state's sovereignty. < ref name= " LiberlandInfo "  / >  Jedlička said in April 2015 that an official [[diplomatic note]] would be sent to both Croatia and Serbia, and later to all other states, with a formal request for [[international recognition]]. < ref name= " B92-1 " > {{cite news|title=Čeh proglasio državu između Srbije i Hrvatske|url=http://www.b92.net/zivot/vesti.php?yyyy=2015 & mm=04 & dd=15 & nav_id=980758|access-date=15 April 2015|agency=BETA|publisher=B92|date=15 April 2015|language=sr}} < /ref >

 In May 2016, several appeals court decisions from Croatia were published. The court upheld the rulings that crossing into Liberland from Croatia is illegal, but found the convictions for entering Liberland from Serbia were not correct. The court said that the lower court committed  " a fundamental breach of misdemeanor proceedings "  and  " essential procedural violations " . It further ruled that  " the facts were incorrectly and incompletely established [by the prosecutor] which could lead to misapplication of substantive law. "  A retrial was ordered in 6 of the 7 appeals. The lower court is therefore required to determine the location of the border and the border crossing, but has not done this yet. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://liberlandpress.com/2016/05/liberland-wins-appeals-lower-courts-committed-fundamental-breach-must-rule-border/ |title=Liberland Wins Appeals!

 == Legality == 
 Croatia and Serbia dismissed Jedlička's claims as not important, although the two countries reacted in different ways. On 24 April 2015, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Serbia)|Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] stated that while they consider the affair a trivial matter, the  " new state "  does not infringe upon the Serbian border, which they say is the Danube River. < ref name=CNN-McKirdy / >  Croatia, which blocks most visitors from accessing Liberland, has stated that after international arbitration, it should be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party. < ref name= " CroatiaStatement "  / > 
 
 An article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, the law review of the [[University of Chicago]] [[Law School]], examined Liberland's claim to statehood in light of the criteria laid out by the [[Montevideo Convention]]. According to the author,  " Croatia’s insistence that Liberland is part of Serbia could constitute a renunciation of Croatia’s legal rights to Liberland. Conversely, if the territory that Liberland claims as its own is Serbian, the Serbian government’s renunciation of its title to that land could also be a quitclaim that would transform the legal status of the land to ''terra nullius''. In both instances, the territory would belong to the first entity —in this case Liberland— to claim it.” < ref name= " chicagounbound.uchicago.edu " > Rossman, Gabriel (2016)  " Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (But Still So Far): Assessing Liberland’s Claim of Statehood, "  Chicago Journal of International Law: Vol. 17: No. 1, Article 10.

 Goran Vojković, professor of law and columnist from the Croatian news portal ''[[Index.hr]]'', described Liberland as a  " circus which threatens Croatian territory " , and argued that there was a risk that Croatia's claim to control land on the other side of the Danube may be weakened by the attention that the Liberland project has drawn to the border dispute. < ref > {{cite news|last1=Vojković|first1=Goran|title=Liberland je Srbija!|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/liberland-je-srbija/819573.aspx|access-date=14 May 2015|publisher=index.hr|date=12 May 2015|language=hr}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2016, an article in [[Stratfor]] summarized the initiative as follows:  " Liberland is a curious case because, in principle, none of the actors that could claim control over it seems interested in doing so.

For the rest of the world's disputed territories, violence and diplomacy will remain the main tools to claim ownership. < ref > {{cite web|title=Introducing Liberland, Europe's Newest Country|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/introducing-liberland-europes-newest-country|website=stratfor.com|publisher=[[Stratfor]]|access-date=24 October 2016|date=25 September 2016}} < /ref >
