 '''Agavaceae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[plant]]s. Many of these plants grow in dry, hot [[climate]]s. Some grow in the [[desert]]. Well-known plants of this family are the [[agave]], [[yucca]], and [[Joshua tree]].  The family includes about 550-600 [[species]] in around 18 [[genus|genera]]. It is widespread in the tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of the world. 
 
 It is not quite clear how large the family really is. There are genera which some biologists leave out of the family. This includes for example ''[[Cordyline]]'' and ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', which are sometimes separated off into a separate family, [[Dracaenaceae]]. Recent research has tended to incorporate these into a larger family [[Ruscaceae]], though.  ''Nolina'', ''Beaucarnea'', and ''Dasylirion'' are sometimes recognized as Nolinaceae or placed in Ruscaceae. Conversely, data from [[molecular systematics]] now suggest that Agavaceae should be broadened to include a number of genera previously classified elsewhere. Among them  are ''[[Chlorogalum]]'', ''[[Camassia]]'' and the family [[Anthericaceae]]. This would enlarge the family with anything up to 22 genera.  The [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]]'s APG II classification places Agavaceae, along with a number of other families (including Ruscaceae) in an expanded family [[Asparagaceae]].  However, APG II allows the alternative of keeping some of these families, including Agavaceae, separate. In this case, it recommends expanding the family to include the genera currently classified in [[Anemarrhenaceae]], [[Anthericaceae]] (with ''Anthericum'' and ''Paradisea''), [[Behniaceae]] and [[Herreriaceae]]. Most references have retained Agavaceae (in varying circumscriptions) as a family distinct from Asparagaceae. ''[[Hesperocallis]]'', sometimes placed in its own family, Hesperocallideaceae, has recently been shown to be closely related and its inclusion in Agavaceae has been recommended (Pires et al. 2004). 
 
 Some species are [[succulent]]. In general, Agavaceae leaves occur as rosettes at the end of a woody stem, which may range from extremely short to tree-like heights, as in the Joshua tree.  The leaves are parallel-veined, and usually appear long and pointed, often with a hardened spine on the end, and sometimes with additional spines along the margins. 
 
 ''Agave'' species are used to make [[pulque]] and [[mezcal]], while others are valued for their [[fibre]]s.  They are quite popular for [[xeriscaping]], many types having showy flowers.
