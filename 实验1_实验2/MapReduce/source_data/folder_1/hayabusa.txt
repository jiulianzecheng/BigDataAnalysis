 {{nihongo|'''''Hayabusa'''''|はやぶさ|extra=literally,  " [[Peregrine Falcon]] " }} is the name of a [[Japan]]ese [[spacecraft]] which was sent into space to collect a sample of material from a small [[near-Earth asteroid]] named [[25143 Itokawa]]. 
 
 The mission was a project of the [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science]] of the [[University of Tokyo]]. 
 
 Hayabusa was sent into space on May 9, 2003. < ref > JAXA, [http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/enterp/missions/catalogue.shtml   " Catalogue of ISAS Missions " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231025049/http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/enterp/missions/catalogue.shtml |date=2014-12-31 }}; retrieved 2012-4-2. < /ref >  In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid.

 ==Mission== 
 ''Hayabusa'' studied Itokawa's shape, spin, topography, colour, composition, density, and history. The ''Hayabusa'' mission was the first time that an attempt was made to bring an asteroid dust sample to earth for analysis. < ref > Amos, Jonathan.
