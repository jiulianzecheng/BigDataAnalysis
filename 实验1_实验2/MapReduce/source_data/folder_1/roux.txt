 '''''Roux'''''  < ref > A French word, pronounced 'roo' in English. < /ref >  is a cooking mixture of wheat [[flour]] and [[butter]] (or other fat). It is the basis of many types of French [[sauce]] for cooking. 
 
 Roux is the thickening agent of three of the [[mother sauce]]s of classical [[French cuisine]]: ''[[sauce béchamel]]'', ''[[sauce velouté]]'' and ''[[sauce espagnole]]''.  [[Clarified butter]], < ref > Melted butter minus its solids, leaving liquid fats. < /ref >  [[vegetable oil]]s, or [[lard]] are commonly used fats. It thickens [[gravy]], other [[sauce]]s, [[soup]]s and [[stew]]s. It is made from equal parts of flour and fat by weight. < ref > {{cite book|last=Berolzheimer|first=Ruth|title=The American Woman's cook book|publisher=Garden City Publishing|location=New York|year=1942|page=307}} < /ref >   
 
 When used in [[Italian cooking]], roux is traditionally equal parts of butter and flour. In [[Cajun cuisine]], roux is almost always made with oil instead of butter and is dark brown in colour. This lends much richness of flavour, but less thickening power. [[Hungarian cuisine]] uses rendered [[lard]] or [[vegetable oil]] instead of butter for the preparation of ''roux'' (called ''rántás'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]).
