 The '''mandible''' is a [[bone]] found in all [[jaw]]ed [[vertebrate]]s. The name comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mandibula''.  
 
 In [[bony fish]] the lower jaw is made of a number of bones, but these were gradually reduced in evolution.  
 
 In humans and other [[mammal]]s the mandible is simply the '''jawbone''' or '''dentary''', which is the largest and strongest [[bone]] of the [[face]].  
 
 In mammals bones formerly in the lower jaw have become the [[ear ossicles]].
