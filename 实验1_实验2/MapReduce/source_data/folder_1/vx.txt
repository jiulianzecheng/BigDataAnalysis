'''VX''' is a type of [[chemical weapon]] called a [[nerve agent]].  It is a very [[toxic]] [[chemical]].  Because it is so toxic, it cannot be used as anything other than a chemical weapon.  The [[United Nations]] classifies VX as a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/documents/687.pdf |title=United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (1991) |date= April 3, 1991 |website= UN.org |publisher=The [[United Nations]] |access-date= February 10, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 VX is the most toxic nerve agent ever created. < ref name= " cfr " > {{cite web |url= http://www.cfr.org/publication/9556/ |title= VX |publisher= Council on Foreign Relations |date= January 1, 2006 |access-date=February 10, 2016 }} < /ref >   The Council on Foreign Relations says:  " A [[fraction]] of a drop of VX, [[Exposure (toxicology)#Routes of exposure#Absorption|absorbed through the skin]], can fatally disrupt the [[central nervous system|nervous system]].

 The [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993, an [[international law]], made it [[illegal]] for countries to use chemical weapons like VX.  It also made it illegal to make or keep more than 100 [[gram]]s of VX.  It allows some [[scientist]]s to make and use amounts under 100 grams only if they are trying to create an [[antidote]], or doing medical [[research]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.opcw.org/fileadmin/OPCW/CWC/CWC_en.pdf |title=Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction (Chemical Weapons Convention) |date=1993 |website=opcw.org  |publisher= Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons |access-date=February 10, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Creation== 
 VX is one of the  " V-series nerve agents "  which were made in the 1950s by the [[United Kingdom]]'s military researchers. < ref name= " CDC " > {{cite web |url= http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/nerve/ |title= Nerve Agents |date=April 19, 2013 |website= emergency.cdc.gov |publisher= United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) |access-date=December 26, 2015 }} < /ref >   Nobody agrees on why these nerve agents are called  " V-series. "   Different people say the  " V "  stands for  " Victory "  or  " Venomous "  (poisonous), or  " Viscous "  (thick liquid). < ref name= " CDC " / > 
 
 ==VX as a weapon== 
 VX is a [[liquid]] that cannot be smelled or tasted.  It is a thick liquid with the texture of [[motor]] [[oil]].  As a weapon, it can be used as a liquid or an [[aerosol]].  It could be spread by air, through water, or through food. < ref name= " niosh " > {{Cite web|date=2019-05-16|title=CDC {{!}} Facts About VX|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/vx/basics/facts.asp#:~:text=VX%20is%20a%20human-made,of%20harmful%20effects%20they%20cause.|access-date=2022-04-09|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us}} < /ref > 
 
 Making VX is difficult and very dangerous.  Many toxic and dangerous chemicals are used in the process. < ref name= " cfr " / >     
 
 VX works [[Nerve agent#How they work|the same way other nerve agents do]].  It blocks [[nerve]] signals from getting from the brain to the body.  Normally, a [[neurotransmitter]] (chemical messenger) called [[acetylcholine]] tells the body's [[muscle]]s to tighten up when they need to.  When it is time for the muscles to relax, an [[enzyme]] called acetylcholinesterase destroys acetylcholine, so the muscles stop getting the signal to relax. < ref name=tb > {{cite book |last1=Mistovich |first1=Joseph J. | last2=Karren |first2=Keith J. |last3=Hafen |first3=Brent |date=July 18, 2013 |title=Prehospital Emergency Care |edition=10th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0133369137}} < /ref > 
 
 VX blocks acetylcholinesterase.  Acetylcholine builds up, because it is not getting destroyed by acetylcholinesterase.  The muscles get tighter and tighter, because the extra acetylcholine keeps telling them to.  The extra acetylcholine also signals the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] to work extra hard.  These changes in the body cause the [[signs and symptoms]] of VX poisoning. < ref name= " armymanual " > {{cite book|url=http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/Portlet.aspx?ID=bddf382f-3ca0-44ba-bd67-fdc48bfa03de|title=Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare|date=1997|publisher=Office of the Surgeon General at TMM Publications|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=129–179|chapter=Nerve Agents (chapter)|access-date=2016-02-10|archive-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318001747/http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/Portlet.aspx?ID=bddf382f-3ca0-44ba-bd67-fdc48bfa03de|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Signs and symptoms=== 
 The earliest symptoms of VX poisoning depend on how a person was [[Exposure (toxicology)|exposed]] to VX.  If VX got on a person's skin, their first symptoms might be [[sweat]]ing or [[myoclonic jerk|twitching muscles]] near where the VX was.  If the person breathed in VX, their first symptoms might be a runny nose and trouble breathing, caused by the [[bronchus|bronchi]] (the tubes that bring air to the [[lung]]s) getting narrower. < ref name=armymanual/ > 
 
 [[File:Diaphragmatic breathing.gif|thumb|left|To breathe, a person's [[diaphragm]] muscle (shown in green) has to tighten and then relax.  VX can stop the diaphragm from being able to relax, and stop a person from breathing.]] 
 All nerve agents have the same symptoms, because they work the same way.  They make the parasympathetic nervous system work too hard.  They also keep signals from the brain from getting through to the body, so the brain cannot tell the muscles to relax.  This causes a group of unique symptoms: < ref name= " WagnerPromes2007 " > {{cite book|author1=Wagner, Mary J. |author2=Promes, Susan B. |title=Last Minute Emergency Medicine: A Concise Review for the Specialty Boards|url=https://archive.org/details/lastminuteemerge00wagn |date=January 1, 2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-150975-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastminuteemerge00wagn/page/n25 12]}} < /ref > < ref name=recert > {{cite web |url=http://utsw.ws/UTSW/EMSSC/0023%201.3.7.1.5%20Organophosphates(ed).pdf |title=EMS Subspecialty Certification Review Course: Organophosphates |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=September 5, 2013 |website=UTSW.ws |publisher=University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center |access-date=February 9, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 * The person's nose will run, tears will come out of their eyes, and they will drool because their body is making so much extra [[saliva]] (spit) 
 * As the brain loses control over the body's muscles, the person will not be able to stop themselves from [[urination|urinating]] and [[defecation|defecating]] 
 * The person will have [[nausea]], [[vomit]]ing, and [[abdominal pain]] 
 * The person's [[heart rate]] will [[bradycardia|be slow]] 
 * The bronchi will get narrower, causing trouble breathing 
 * The body will make a lot of extra [[mucus]], which can build up in the lungs and make breathing even harder 
 
 People with VX poisoning can have [[seizure]]s and go into [[status epilepticus]].  They can die because their breathing muscles get so tight that they do not work. < ref name=armymanual/ > 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 [[Image:AutoinjectorMarkI.jpg|thumbnail|right|Nerve agent [[antidote]] kits used by the U.S. military, containing atropine and pralidoximine]]  
 If a person got VX on their skin, the first step is to wash away the VX with [[bleach]] and water.  This is called ''decontamination.''  Removing clothing that the VX touched is also part of decontamination. < ref name=niosh/ > < ref name=army > {{Cite report |author=Department of the Army |date=November 13, 2012 |title=Toxic Chemical Agent Safety Standards |url=http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/p385_61.pdf |publisher=[[United States Army]] |access-date=February 10, 2016 |archive-date=November 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123083035/http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/p385_61.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < sup > p.30 < /sup > 
 
 There are [[antidote]]s for nerve agent poisoning.  They have to be given together. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=11 & po=23|title=Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Including Insecticides and Chemical Warfare Nerve Agents, Part 4 - Section 11, Management Strategy 3: Medications - 2-PAM (2-Pyridine Aldoxime Methylchloride) (Pralidoxime) | website=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |date=October 16, 2010 |access-date=February 10, 2016 |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}} < /ref > 
 # [[Atropine]] keeps extra acetylcholine from having any more effects on the body 
 # [[Pralidoxime]] (2-PAM) reverses the effects of VX.  It does this by attaching to the VX in the body.  With pralidoxime attached to it, VX cannot keep blocking acetylcholinesterase.  Acetylcholinesterase starts working again, and can destroy the extra acetylcholine that has built up in the body. 
 
 However, nerve agents like VX work very quickly.  Antidotes usually have to be given within a few minutes after a person was exposed to VX.  If pralidoxime is not given soon enough, it cannot reverse VX's effects. < ref name=army/ > < sup > p.6 < /sup > 
 
 Usually, a [[sedative]] like [[diazepam]] (Valium) is also given.  This will help the body's muscles relax, and can prevent seizures. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Marrs TC 2004 |title=The role of diazepam in the treatment of nerve agent poisoning in a civilian population |journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology |year=2004 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=145–157 |doi=10.2165/00139709-200423030-00002 |pmid=15862082 |s2cid=25414979 }} < /ref >
