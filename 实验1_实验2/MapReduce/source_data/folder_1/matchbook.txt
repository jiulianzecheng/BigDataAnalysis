 A '''matchbook''' is a small [[cardboard]] [[container]] that holds a quantity of [[safety match|matches]] inside and has a coarse striking surface on the exterior.  
 
 A flap on the front is lifted to access the matches, which are attached to the interior base in a comb-like pattern and must be torn away before use. (In the matchbox, by contrast, the matches are arranged loosely in the interior tray.) 
 
 Matchbooks are often covered with [[Advertisement|advertising]] logos or various artistic decorations, and they have served as collector's items and free souvenirs.
