 '''Micronesia''' is an area in [[Oceania]]. Many [[island]]s in the western [[Pacific Ocean]] are part of it. Micronesia means ''small islands'' in ancient [[Greek language]]. 
 
 The [[Philippines]] is to the west of Micronesia. [[Indonesia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Melanesia]] are to the south of Micronesia. [[Polynesia]] is to the east of Micronesia. 
 
 Most of the islands in Micronesia are [[atoll]]s. These are ring-shaped islands made of a [[coral reef]]. But some are high islands with a coral reef around them. 
 
 Traditionally in Micronesia, each island or area has a [[chief]]. The chief cannot do anything without support of the council. Everyone is part of a [[clan]], or extended family. Each family group also has a chief. The chiefs are usually older men. Micronesia is mostly [[matrilineal]], which means that [[descent]] is followed through women. So a chief may be followed by his sister's son. 
 
 People in Micronesia often have family members on many other islands. The society values [[social equality]]. [[Wealth]] is spread pretty evenly between people. Even the chiefs are not much richer than everyone else. But this is less true in the eastern islands, where there are [[social class]]es. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436752926|title=Traditional Micronesian societies : adaptation, integration, and political organization|last=Petersen|first=Glenn|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4416-1992-1|location=Honolulu|oclc=436752926}} < /ref >
