'''Pseudopodia'''  are temporary and [[cytoplasm]]-filled parts of the [[cell membrane]] that are able to change their form in order to [[movement|move]]. They are used in some [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell]]s to move around or to eat. Most cells that do this are called [[amoeboid]]s. The [[amoeba]] is a common example. 
 
 The cell wall makes a network of fibers. The cytoplasm flows into the network and fills it up, similar to a [[net]] filled with [[gelatin]]. This is able to move, lengthen, or shorten. The pseudopodia extends from the amoeba. Then the main part of the amoeba flows into that pseudopodia and the amoeba has changed its place. 
 
 Pseudopods are one of the three [[movement|locomotion]] modes of [[unicellular]] organisms (together with [[Flagellum|flagella]] and [[cilia]]). Pseudopods can also capture [[prey]] by [[phagocytosis]]. Pseudopedia are used by some cells to move around. They can detect food and place it inside the cell. The human [[white blood cell]] uses this way to get around. 
 
 Pseudopods can be classified into several varieties according to their appearance: 
 *'''Lobopodia''' are short and blunt in form, very typical of [[Amoeba]].It uses pseudopodia to capture it's food and for movement  
 *'''Filopodia''' are more slender and filiform with pointed ends. 
 *'''Reticulopodia''', also known as '''reticulose pseudopods''', are complex formations where individual pseudopods are blended together and form irregular nets. 
 *'''Axopodia''' are thin pseudopods and are enveloped by [[cytoplasm]]. Axopodia are responsible for phagocytosis, by rapidly retracting in response to physical contacts.  They are observed in [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]].
