 '''Solifugae''' is an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[arachnid]]s sometimes called 'camel spiders', 'wind scorpions' or 'sun spiders'. Although they look rather like [[spider]]s, they are not spiders, and they are not [[scorpion]]s.  
 
 The order includes more than 1,000 [[species]] in about 153 [[genus|genera]]. Much like a spider, the body of a Solifugid is separated into an [[opisthosoma]] ([[abdomen]]) and a [[prosoma]] (a combined head and [[thorax]]). Unlike [[scorpion]]s, they do not have tails, and they do not have [[venom]]. 
 
 Most species of Solifugids live in [[Arid|dry]] climates. They are found in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]]. The largest species grow to a length of {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, including legs. < ref name=schmidt93 > {{Cite book|author=G.
