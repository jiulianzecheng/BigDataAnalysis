 A '''coronation''' is a [[ceremony]] that gives a [[monarch]] regal or royal power or recognizes that power. The power is [[symbol]]ized by putting a [[crown]] upon his or her head. We say that the [[king]] or [[queen]] is  " crowned "  at the coronation.  
 
 The [[ritual]] with [[anointing]] may have a religious meaning. Coronations are not as common now as in the past, although in some countries such as [[Great Britain]] it is still normal to hold the ceremony to install a new king or queen.
