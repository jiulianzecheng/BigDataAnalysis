 '''Alexandrite''' is a [[gemstone]]. It is a type of [[chrysoberyl]]. Different kinds of light make the colors change. That is called the  " alexandrite effect " .  
 
 A gemstone similar to alexandrite can be made in a [[laboratory]]. That kind of stone is called synthetic or simulated alexandrite. These are not made of chrysoberyl. People make these because alexandrite is expensive, and the synthetic alexandrite costs less. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.alexandrite.net/chapters/chapter7/index.html | title = Alexandrite Synthetics and Imitations, In Alexandrite Tsarstone Collectors Guide. | year = 2006 | access-date = 2007-07-09 | archive-date = 2008-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080530143859/http://www.alexandrite.net/chapters/chapter7/index.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 One story says that alexandrite was named in honor of [[Alexander II of Russia]]. Alexander was not yet [[Tsar]] at the time. 
 
 Alexandrite has been found in [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. 
 
 Alexandrite is one of the birthstones for [[June]].
