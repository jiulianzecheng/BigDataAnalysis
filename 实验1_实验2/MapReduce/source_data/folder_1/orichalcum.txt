 '''Orichalcum''' or '''aurichalcum''', '''ὀρείχαλκος''' is the name of a [[metal]] or two different metals.  Old writings from ancient Greece talk about orichalcum and the Romans made coins out of a metal they called orichalcum, but they might not have been the same metal.  People were not sure exactly what it was, until 2015 a [[shipwreck]] was found whose cargo contained [[ingots]] of orichalcum.  < ref > https://www.archaeology.wiki/blog/2015/01/09/ancient-greek-shipwreck-carrying-unusual-metal-discovered/ < /ref >   
 
 Initially some scholars thought orichalcum was the ancient Greek name for [[platinum]].  Others thought it was an [[alloy]], or mixture, of [[copper]] and either [[gold]], [[tin]], or [[zinc]]. < ref name= " MGS " > {{cite web|url=https://www.mgsrefining.com/blog/2012/03/27/orichalcum-extinct-metal-or-common-alloy/|access-date=August 4, 2020|publisher=Manhattan Gold and Silver|title=Orichalcum: Extinct Metal or Common Alloy?|date=March 27, 2012}} < /ref >   Scientists examined Roman coins and found a mixture of copper and zinc. < ref name= " Nature "  / > 
 
 The chemical analysis of the ingots found in the 2015 shipwreck revealed orichalcum is high quality [[brass]]. Brass is an alloy of [[copper]] and [[zinc]], and while the ancient Greeks did not know metallic zinc, they knew zinc-containing ores, and the description that orichalcum has similar colour and shine as gold, fits well to the properties of brass. While brass is not exactly a precious metal, it does not corrode and it is widely used on jewelry, marine instruments and medical instruments. Goldsmiths and jewellers describe brass as  " mahogany of metals " . 
 
 ==Name== 
 
 The name ''orichalcum'' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for  " mountain copper "  or  " mountain metal. " < ref name= " MGS "  / > 
 
 Some people think name ''aurichalcum'' comes from the word ''aurum'' for  " gold, "  but it does not. < ref name= " Tufts "  / > 
 
 ==Greek orichalcum== 
 
 In general, when ancient Greek writers wrote about orichalcum, they said it was a metal that looked like gold but that they did not know much else about it. < ref name= " Tufts "  / >  To Homer, Hesiod and Plato, orichalcum was a metal from much earlier times that did not exist in their own time and place. 
 
 In one of the [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Homer]] writes about orichalcum earrings.  He says the goddess [[Aphrodite]] wears them.  [[Hesiod]] writes about orichalcum [[greaves]], which are leg armor. < ref name= " Tufts "  / >  Neither writer was talking about his own time and place. 
 
 [[Plato]] wrote about orichalcum in his book ''[[Critias]]''.  In the book, Plato says orichalchum was in the ground of the legendary island of [[Atlantis]].  To the Atlanteans, it was the second-most-valuable metal, after gold.  Plato says the Atlanteans put orichalcum on their city walls and temples.  Plato calls orichalcum  " only a name "  in his own time, meaning he did not think he had ever seen orichalcum. < ref name= " Critias " > {{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/critias.html|title=Critias|author=Plato|translator=Benjamin Jowett|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|access-date=August 4, 2020|date=n.d.|orig-year=360 BCE|archive-date=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207020226/http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/critias.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Roman orichalcum== 
 
 The ancient Romans also had a metal that they called orichalcum.  Around the time the [[Roman Republic]] ended and the [[Roman Empire]] started, the Romans stopped making coins out of [[bronze]] < ref name= " Tufts " > {{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:entry=orichalcum-cn|publisher=Tufts University|title=ORICHAL´CUM|work=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |year=1890|author1=William Smith, LLD |author2=William Wayte|editor=G. E. Marindin|access-date=August 4, 2020}} < /ref >  and started making them out of orichalcum: asses coins, [[Sestertius|sestertii]] coins, dupondii coins and semisses coins. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal|journal=Scientific Reports|title=Microstructure and chemical composition of Roman orichalcum coins emitted after the monetary reform of ''Augustus'' (23 B.C.)|author1=Melania Di Fazio|author2=Anna Candida Felici|author3=Fiorenzo Catalli|author4=Caterina De Vito|volume=9|date=September 3, 2019|issue=1 |page=12668|doi=10.1038/s41598-019-48941-4|pmid=31481740 |pmc=6722059 |bibcode=2019NatSR...912668D|s2cid=201714421}} < /ref >

 == Making orichalcum== 
 
 Scientists analyzed Roman coins and saw they were made of copper and zinc.  During the early days of the [[Roman Empire]], Romans invented a better way to make zinc-copper alloys.  This way is called cementation.  To do it, the metalworker has to heat the zinc and copper to exactly the correct temperature.  Then there can be as much as 30% zinc in the orichalcum. < ref name= " Nature "  / > 
 
 ==In fiction== 
 
 Orichalcum appears in many works of fiction, especially stories about Atlantis.  It is in television shows, for example ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' and ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''. It is in video games, for example ''[[Castlevania]]: Curse of Darkness'' and ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' and also [[:en:Indiana_Jones_and_the_Fate_of_Atlantis|Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]
