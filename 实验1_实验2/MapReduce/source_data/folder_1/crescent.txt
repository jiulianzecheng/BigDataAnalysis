 In art and symbolism, a '''crescent''' is generally the shape produced when a [[circle|circular]] disk has a segment of another circle removed from its edge, so that what remains is a shape enclosed by two circular arcs of different diameters which intersect at two points (usually in such a manner that the enclosed shape does not include the center of the original circle).  
 
 The crescent was long used as the symbol of [[Byzantium]]. Now it is the main symbol for the religion [[Islam]].
