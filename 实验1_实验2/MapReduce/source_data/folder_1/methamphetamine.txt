  }} < /ref > < ref name= " Fast Facts "  / >  In its smoked form, methamphetamine is known as  " ice, "   " crystal, "   " crank, "   " batu, "   " barang, "   " cerita, "  or  " glass " . 
 
 == History == 
 Methamphetamine has been around for a very long time, though the procedures for manufacturing the drug have changed throughout the years and made it much more potent. In Germany, in the late 1800s, [[amphetamine]] was developed, and in 1919, Japan created methamphetamine, which was easier to produce than amphetamine. The drug was widely used in combat during [[World War II]] to promote wakefulness. After World War II, there was an epidemic of methamphetamine abuse in Japan, according to the Foundation for a Drug-Free World. 
 
 == Ways of using methamphetamine (routes of administration) == 
 === Snorting === 
 When methamphetamine is snorted, the crystals are ground up and made into little lines (also called rails). Then they are inhaled through the nose with rolled-up paper, rolled-up dollar bills, empty plastic pen tubes, short plastic straws, or other things that can be made into a small  " tube "  shape. 
 
 When methamphetamine is snorted, its effects last longer than when it is smoked or injected. The effects can last as long as twelve hours. < ref > {{Cite web

 Snorting methamphetamine can damage the [[nasal septum]] on the inside of the [[nose]]. Also, if people share the same snorting tube, they can get [[infection]]s. 
 
 === Smoking === 
 When methamphetamine is smoked, the crystals are placed into a [[glass]] pipe (called a  " meth pipe " ) or a hollowed-out lightbulb. The crystals are warmed up from underneath by a flame (like from a lighter or matches). The methamphetamine is not actually  " smoked "  this way; it is heated up until it melts. When it melts, it turns into a [[Vapor|gas]] that the user then breathes in. 
 
 Smoking methamphetamine causes euphoria to happen very quickly in the person using it, and causes strong euphoria. However, the [[vapor]] (gas) can damage the [[lung]]s. 
 
 === Injecting === 
 Methamphetamine can be mixed with water, then put into a needle and injected. Methamphetamine can be injected under the [[skin]] (this is called  " skin-popping " ); into a [[Muscular system|muscle]] (intramuscular injection); or into a [[vein]] (intravenous inection). Injecting methamphetamine into a vein causes the quickest, strongest euphoria. 
 
 Injecting methamphetamine can damage the body in many ways. It is very addictive. People can get infections (including [[HIV]], [[hepatitis C]], and many others) from dirty needles. People sharing a needle can also cause diseases in their blood. 
 
 === Eating === 
 If methamphetamine is eaten, it gets absorbed into the body from the [[digestive system]]. Although the effects take longer to be felt when compared to other routes of administration (between fifteen and forty five minutes), they tend to outlast the highs achieved through smoking, injecting, and snorting. The onset is comparatively gentler, but can cause gastrointestinal problems for the user and is not considered one hundred percent safe. The body naturally filters out some toxins when methamphetamine is ingested orally, but due to the potency of the drug, addiction is still a strong risk factor. 
 
 == Effects == 
 
 === Desired effects === 
 Desired effects are the things people want to feel when they take methamphetamine.  These include: 
 * Euphoria 
 * Having a lot of energy 
 * Being able to stay awake for a long time 
 * Losing weight 
 *numbing emotions 
 
 === Adverse effects === 
 Adverse effects are the bad things that using methamphetamine can cause. Methamphetamine has many adverse effects. For example: 
 
 ==== Addiction ==== 
 Methamphetamine is very [[addiction|addictive]]. < ref name= " NIDA.What "  / >  This means that when people start taking the drug, they will want to keep taking more, even if it is making them sick or depressed. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What are the Dangers of Methamphetamine Abuse?|url=https://www.projectknow.com/methamphetamine-abuse-hotlines/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-23|website=Project Know|archive-date=2021-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523155742/https://www.projectknow.com/methamphetamine-abuse-hotlines/}} < /ref > 
 
 One of the reasons methamphetamine users who quit the drug go back to using it is the craving to use more because of how good it feels. The euphoria is so strong that many users claim to have an uncontrollable urge to get more of the drug after using it. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|last2=|last3=|title=Effects of Meth on the Body {{!}} What Does Meth Do to Your Body?|url=https://drugabuse.com/featured/the-effects-of-meth-on-your-body/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-21|website=DrugAbuse.com|language=en|archive-date=2021-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210821135009/https://drugabuse.com/featured/the-effects-of-meth-on-your-body/}} < /ref >  Cravings to use more methamphetamine can make the user obsessed with getting more and getting the same high. 
 
 When people are addicted to methamphetamine, they can also have [[withdrawal]] [[symptom]]s when they do not take the drug after the high goes away. Withdrawal symptoms can include a wide range of feelings of emotional pain or suffering. Without methamphetamine, addicts can feel [[anhedonia]]. This means they cannot feel good without using the drug. 
 
 '''Dependence''' 
 
 Methamphetamine can make a user psychologically dependent. This means that without using the drug, someone who is dependent experiences withdrawal symptoms. These include depression, anxiety, paranoia, not being able to sleep and other symptoms involving what's going on in the user's head. These symptoms are more intense in methamphetamine users than other drug users. 
 
 Physical dependence is when a user experiences withdrawal symptoms like, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweats, muscle and joint pain and other symptoms involving negative things happening to the user's body. Some who are physically dependent report pain all throughout their body and not going away for days or weeks. Physical dependence is more common among people who use opioids (strong, addictive pain relievers that can cause euphoria in non-medical situations) like morphine, heroin, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl. Physical dependence doesn't happen in users of stimulant drugs like methamphetamine. 
 
 ==== Overdose ==== 
 [[Overdose|Overdosing]] (commonly called  " OD'ing " ) on methamphetamine (taking too much) can make a person very sick. Some of the symptoms of methamphetamine overdose are very [[danger]]ous, and can even kill a person. Methamphetamine overdoses resulting in the user dying are very rare, but in once instance in Thailand, a dose of 200mg in 2 people's systems was enough to kill them. Overdosing on the drug can cause: < ref name= " Medline " > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007480.htm |title=Methamphetamine Overdose |last1=Heller, MD, MHA |first1=Jacob L. |date=April 5, 2013 |website=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=December 31, 2015 |quote= |archive-date=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105061643/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007480.htm |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 * Very [[tachycardia|high heart rate]] 
 * [[Myocardial infarction|Heart attack]] (or, in the worst cases, the [[Cardiac arrest|heart can stop beating]]) 
 * Very [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], which can cause a [[stroke]] 
 * [[Dyspnea|Trouble breathing]] 
 * [[Kidney]] damage or [[kidney failure]] 
 * [[Seizure]]s 
 * [[Coma]] (in the worst cases) 
 
 ====  " Meth Mouth "  ==== 
 [[File:Suspectedmethmouth09-19-05.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A suspected case of meth mouth]] 
 " Meth Mouth "  is a term used to describe destroyed or decayed [[tooth|teeth]] in people that use methamphetamine. Meth mouth can happen very quickly. A new addict can go from having healthy teeth to losing all of their teeth in as little as one year. The decay (rotting teeth) is not caused by methamphetamine itself, but by users not brushing their teeth, having a lot of sugary drinks, and having dry mouth. 
 
 '''Life expectancy''' 
 
 The life expectancy of a methamphetamine addict is 5–10 years. < ref > {{cite web|title=WHAT IS THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A METHAMPHETAMINE ADDICT?|url=http://www.drugrehab.ca/what-is-the-life-expectancy-of-a-methamphetamine-addict.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=18 January 2016|archive-date=18 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518190157/http://www.drugrehab.ca/what-is-the-life-expectancy-of-a-methamphetamine-addict.html|url-status=live}} < /ref >
