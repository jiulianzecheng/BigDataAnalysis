 '''Chocolate''' is a food made from [[cacao bean]]s. It is used in many [[dessert]]s like [[pudding]], cakes, [[candy]], [[ice cream]], and [[Easter eggs]]. It can be in a [[solid]] form like a [[candy bar]] or it can be in a liquid form like [[hot chocolate]]. Commercial chocolate has [[sugar]] and sometimes [[milk]] added. It has a melting point of about {{Convert|30 to 32|C|F}}. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Why does chocolate melt in your hand?|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/why-does-chocolate-melt-in-your-hand/|access-date=2023-08-25|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}} < /ref > 
 
 Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste.  It was originally used to make [[drinking chocolate]]. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-08-10|title=History of Chocolate: Cocoa Beans  &  Xocolatl|url=https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-americas/history-of-chocolate|access-date=2023-08-22|website=HISTORY|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 === Mesoamerica === 
 The cacao [[tree]] was first found to be useful for its [[seed]]s about two thousand years ago. Early the Maya people of [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]] used the seeds from the [[cacao tree]] to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet.  Only important people could drink it.  The word for  " chocolate "  in almost every language comes from its name in the [[Nahuatl language]] of Mexico, ''chocolatl''. 
 
 One vessel found at an [[Olmec]] archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of [[Veracruz]], Mexico, dates chocolate by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 [[BC]]. < ref name= " aj200712 " > {{cite journal |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/powis/index.html |title=Oldest chocolate in the New World |author1=Terry G.

 Later on, this drink was made sweeter and made into what is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[explorer]]s who brought it from [[North America]] to [[Spain]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/J0113211/the_history_of_chocolate.htm|title=History of Chocolate|publisher=ThinkQuest|accessdate=2011-04-16|archive-date=2009-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310040314/http://library.thinkquest.org/J0113211/the_history_of_chocolate.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  When chocolate was sweetened and made into [[candy]], it became a very popular treat for many [[Europe]]ans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. In France at that time, only nobles could buy it.  Now, many people enjoy it.  Most cocoa today is made in Africa in countries like the [[Ivory Coast]] (Côte d'Ivoire) and Nigeria. 
 
 Until the 16th century, the cacao tree was unknown to the Europeans. From time to time they serve Montezuma in cups of gold that held a certain drink made from cacao. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. 
 
 == Types == 
 [[File:Chocolate.jpg|thumb|White, milk, and dark chocolate.]] 
 There are three main types of chocolate: [[white chocolate]], [[milk chocolate]], and [[dark chocolate]]. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter [[ingredient]]s in it. 
 
 Milk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has lots of cocoa. 
 
 Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor. 
 
 * '''Ruby chocolate''' is a type of chocolate created by Barry Callebaut. The variety was in development from 2004, and was released to the public in 2017. The chocolate type is made from the Ruby cocoa bean, resulting in a distinct red colour and a different flavour, described as  " sweet yet sour " . 
 * '''Raw chocolate''' is chocolate that has not been processed, heated, or mixed with other ingredients. It is sold in chocolate-growing countries, and to a much lesser extent in other countries, often promoted as healthy. 
 * '''Compound chocolate''' is the name for a confection combining cocoa with other vegetable fat, usually tropical fats or hydrogenated fats, as a replacement for cocoa butter. It is often used for candy bar coatings. In many countries it may not legally be called  " chocolate " . 
 * '''Modeling chocolate''' is a chocolate paste made by melting chocolate and combining it with corn syrup, glucose syrup, or golden syrup. It is primarily used by cakemakers and pâtisseries to add decoration to cakes and pastries. 
 * '''Cocoa powder''' is the pulverized cocoa solids left after extracting almost all the cocoa butter. It is used to add chocolate flavour in baking, and for making chocolate drinks. There are two types of unsweetened cocoa powder: natural cocoa produced by the Broma process, with no additives, and Dutch process cocoa, which is additionally processed with alkali to neutralize its natural acidity. Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic, and is commonly used in recipes that also use baking soda; as baking soda is an alkali, combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking. Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste, with a darker colour. It is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids. However, Dutch processing destroys most of the flavonoids present in cocoa. 
 
 == Safety == 
 Chocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some [[animal]]s, like [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, become sick even if they eat only a little chocolate. < ref name= " autogenerated1 " > {{cite web|url=http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/nutritiondogs/a/chocolatetoxici.htm|title=Chocolate Toxicity|last=Crosby|first=Janet Tobiassen|website=Veterinary Q  &  A|publisher=[[About.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502141005/http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/nutritiondogs/a/chocolatetoxici.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|url-status=live|accessdate=26 June 2019}} < /ref >  People with [[diabetes]] can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight diseases. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of [[heart disease]] because of [[polyphenol]] in chocolate. It is necessary to moderate the amount of chocolate you eat. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/77958/Lifestyle/2010+calendar:+A+year+of+healthy+living+.html|title=2010 calendar: A year of healthy living|last=Sangam|first=Radhika|work=India Today|publisher=India Today group|date=6 January 2010|quote=A study by Dr Romina di Giuseppe and colleagues from the Catholic University, Italy, reveals that eating up to 20gm (two small squares) of dark chocolate every three days lowers the risk of heart disease by one-third in women and one-fourth in men.|accessdate=2 February 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 == Process == 
 Making chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the [[cocoa]] beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the [[chocolate liquor]] come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and [[vanilla]]. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth instead of smooth. Conches use heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste under regulated speeds and temperatures. Conching for several hours to several days makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.chocolatemonthclub.com/the-chocolate-making-process|title=How to Make Chocolate - Chocolate Making Process {{!}} Chocolate of the Month Club|work=The Gourmet Chocolate of the Month Club|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Ingredients == 
 There are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]]. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each [[chemical]] varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate.
