 '''Southwark''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|ð|ɚ|k}} {{respell|SUDH|ərk}}) < ref > " Southwark " , in ''The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World'' (1952), New York:  Columbia University Press. < /ref >  is the main part of the inner [[London Borough of Southwark]]. It is on the [[Thames]], south of [[London Bridge]]. It is often called just 'The Borough'. Southwark was once a separate town in [[Surrey]], and was made part of London in 1889. 
 
 Southwark has several important buildings: [[Southwark Cathedral]], [[London Bridge station]] and the [[Tate|Tate Modern]] [[art gallery]]. Two [[Roman roads]] met in Southwark: [[Watling Street]] and [[Stane Street]]. The area was [[marsh]]y with [[island]]s in Roman times. They built the first London Bridge here. 
 
 The word 'Southwark' is pronounced ''Suthuk''.
