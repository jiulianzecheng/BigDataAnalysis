 '''Dreams''' are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are [[Sleep|sleeping]]. They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange. Dreams can be so real, the person dreaming may not believe they are awake. This tends to happen during a [[false awakening]], where a person dreams of waking up. A person has around 4 - 6 dreams per night, and tend to only remember the last two.  
 
 Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming, but keeps having the dream. This is called a [[lucid dream]]. This happens very little for most people, but for some people it happens often. During a lucid dream, a person usually has full control over their body, as well as the environment around them. There are no limits in lucid dreams, sometimes not even the imagination. 
 
 Most people remember their dreams in some way or another, even if it is only a small part, but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly. It is often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up. Because of this, many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have. This is called [[dream recall]], and the more it is done the better they remember their dreams. If a person is woken up during a dream, they tend to have a much more reliable memory of it. 
 
 [[Nightmare]]s are dreams which scare or shock people. Nightmares are usually based around that person's everyday fears, like [[spiders]] or [[dark]] places, but even a dream that's not about those things can feel unpleasant. Nightmares are caused by many different things: being uncomfortable or in [[pain]] while sleeping, [[sickness]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], or even eating right before sleeping. 
 
 There are many different [[Theory|theories]] about why people dream and what their dreams mean. Every person has different dreams. Some [[psychologist]]s believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the [[unconscious mind]] (the part of the mind that works by itself). Others think that people, places, and objects in dreams are [[symbols]] for other things in the dreamer's real life. Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them, and have often used them for [[divination]] or [[fortune-telling]]. Today there are still many [[books]] and [[websites]] devoted to making sense of dreams. 
 
 == Ancient ideas on dreams == 
 Generally speaking, ancient civilisations thought dreams were messages from the gods (see the works of [[Homer]]) or alternatively some kind of [[prophecy]]. < ref > Harris, William V. 2009. ''Dreams and experience in classical antiquity''. Cambridge, Mass.  &  London: Harvard University Press. < /ref >  However, they knew that often dreams misled the dreamer, and invented various explanations for this. [[Aristotle]] started off with ideas like this, but later became more skeptical, and denied the divine origin of dreams. < ref > Aristotle, On Dreams, and On divination in sleep. In Ross W.D. 1931. ''The works of Aristotle translated into English''. 3rd ed, Oxford University Press. < /ref > 
 
 == Freudian theory == 
 In his ''Interpretation of Dreams'', [[Sigmund Freud]] connected them to his ideas on [[psychotherapy]]. < ref > Freud, Sigmend. 1913. ''The interpretation of dreams''. Authorised translation of third edition with introduction by A.A. Brill. London: George Allen. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dh00fr.html] < /ref >  Dreams, in Freud's view, are forms of  " wish fulfillment " . They are attempts by the unconscious to resolve a [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] of some sort. Because the information in the unconscious is in an unruly and often disturbing form, a  " censor "  in the preconscious will not allow it to pass unaltered into the conscious. Freud describes three main types of dreams: 1. Direct prophecies received in the dream; 2. The foretelling of a future event; 3. The symbolic dream, which requires interpretation. 
 
 Some authors, such as [[Hans Eysenck]], have argued that the dreams Freud cites do not really support his theories. Eysenck argues that Freud's examples actually disprove his dream theory. < ref > Eysenk, Hans 1985. ''Decline and fall of the Freudian empire''. London:Viking. {{ISBN|0-14-022562-5}} < /ref > 
 
 == Modern work == 
 Since Freud, the emphasis has been on the biology of dreaming. < ref > Foulks D. 1966. ''The psychology of sleep''. New York: Scribner < /ref > < ref > Kramer M (ed) 1969. ''Dream psychology and the new biology of dreaming''. Springflied, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. < /ref > < ref > Hartman, Ernest. 1997. ''Biology of dreaming''. Springflied, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas < /ref > 
 
 The discovery of [[REM]] (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep has been important. Researchers have done many studies on this. Subjects have been woken up in both stages and asked what they were thinking about. < ref > Officially  " sought details of their mental life just prior to waking " . < /ref >  It is clear that the reports from non-REM stages were different from REM stages. In particular, dreams occur mostly when the brain is in the REM state. < ref > Dement W.  &  Kleitman N. 1957. The relation of eye movements during sleep to dream activity. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'. '''53''' (5): 339–346. < /ref > < ref > Hobson J.A; Pace-Scott E.F.  &  Robert Stickgold R. 2000. Dreaming and the brain: toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' '''23'''. < /ref >  There is also some relationship between dreaming and [[daydream]]s. Both seem to occur in a cycle of 90{{ndash}}110 minutes. < ref name=Mind > Dreaming (by Ian Oswald) in Gregory, Richard L. 1987. ''The Oxford companion to the mind''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-866124-X}} < /ref > 
 
 Apparently,  " there is no evidence that a more useful understanding of personality can be gained from them than can be divined from the realities of waking behaviour " . < ref name=Mind/ > 
 
 If sleep is prevented, people suffer and get worse at every kind of waking activity. From this it is clear that one important function of sleep is to maintain normal brain activity during awake time. Somehow, during sleep the brain gets restored to its normal functioning. Sleep is, so far as is known, universal amongst [[vertebrates]]. That also argues for its great importance. However, it is not known whether dreaming supports this repair function of sleep, or whether it is something which just happens. < ref > Coutts R. 2008.
