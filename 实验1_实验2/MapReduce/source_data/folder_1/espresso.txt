 '''Espresso''' is a type of Italian [[coffee]] that is concentrated. In order to make espresso, [[coffee bean]]s are powdered and hot water is added under high [[pressure]]. This is done using an espresso machine or a macchinetta. Usually, espresso is made using 7 & nbsp;grams of coffee beans. This gives espresso a very strong [[flavor]]. Because espresso is so strong, it is usually mixed with other coffee drinks in small amounts.
