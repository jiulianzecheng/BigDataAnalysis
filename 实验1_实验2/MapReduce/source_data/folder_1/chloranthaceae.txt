 '''Chloranthaceae''' is the botanical name of a family of [[flowering plant]]s. The family consists of four genera, totalling several dozen species, of herbaceous or woody plants occurring in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Madagascar]], [[Central America|Central]]  &  [[South America]], and the [[West Indies]]. The flowers are inconspicuous, and arranged in inflorescences. Petals are absent in this family, and sometimes so are sepals. The flowers can be either hermaphrodite or of separate sexes. The fruit is drupe-like, consisting of one carpel.
