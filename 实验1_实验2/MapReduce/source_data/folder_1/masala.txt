 '''Masala''' or '''Massala''' or '''Masalo''' ({{lang-hi|मसाला}}, {{lang-ur|مسالہ}} {{lang-gu|મસાલો}}, {{lang-mr|मसाला}}, {{lang-ne|मसला}}) is a word used in [[South Asia]] mainly in [[India]]. When Indian people talk about [[cook]]ing and they say ''masala'', they mean a mixture of ground [[spice]]s used in Indian cooking.   
 
 There are many different, popular spice mixtures that have been given their own name because they taste really good with one special ingredient. The dish will often use ''masala'' in its name. Some popular dishes are: 
 
 * [[Masala Chai]]: tea flavoured with a special blend of spices 
 * [[Chicken tikka masala]]: pieces of chicken cooked using a special blend of spices; very popular in the [[United Kingdom]]  &  [[Ireland]] 
 * [[Chana Masala]]: a [[chickpea]] dish flavoured with a special mix of spices 
 * [[Maggi masala noodles]]: a brand of noodles with a packet of dried spices for flavouring; very popular in [[India]] 
 
 The blend of spices or ''masala'' for these dishes is often sold in markets or packed by companies to be sold in shops. Some spice blends, like [[Garam masala|Garam Masala]], are so popular it is often used in many different recipes, not just one. 
 
 Also India is one of the only countries to have the highest variety in masalas. Around 70% of the world's spice business and exports are handled by India.
