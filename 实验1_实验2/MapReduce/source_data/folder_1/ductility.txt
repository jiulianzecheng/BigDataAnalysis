 '''Ductility''' is when a solid material stretches under [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] strain. If ductile, a material may be stretched into a [[wire]]. [[Malleability]], a similar property, is a material's ability to deform under pressure ([[Compression (physical)|compressive]] stress). If malleable, a material may be flattened by hammering or rolling.   
 
 Both of these properties are aspects of [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].  Plasticity is how far a solid material can be deformed without [[Material fracture|fracture]].  These properties are commonplace in [[metal]]s, and are dependent on temperature and pressure.  This was investigated by [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] as part of his 1946 [[Nobel Prize]]â€“winning work on high pressures. 
 
 Ductility and malleability do not always go together. [[Gold]] has high ductility and malleability, but [[lead]] has low ductility and high malleability. < ref name= " mms " > {{Cite book | last = Rich | first = Jack C.
