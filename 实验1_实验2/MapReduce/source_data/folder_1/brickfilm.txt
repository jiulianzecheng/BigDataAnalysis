 A '''brickfilm''' is a [[stop-motion]] [[movie]] using [[Lego]]s, Mega Blocks, or  other Lego-like products. Brickfilms are often used to help the [[Lego Group]] [[advertising|advertise]] more sets and themes. The first known Brickfilm was called  " The Magic Portal " . It was made from 
 1980â€“1989 in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]] by Lindsay Fleay. 
 
 A brickfilm can be made by taking a Lego character and placing it on a board. The creator takes a picture, slightly moves the character, and repeats this step many times. The pictures are then streamed together using video editing software. Fifteen frames per second (15 fps) is a common frame-rate.
