 == Life == 
 The Franks—one of the [[Germanic peoples]] who had moved their homes over the [[River Rhine]] into the [[Roman Empire]] as it was falling apart—were, by the year 700, the rulers of [[Gaul]], and a lot of Germania east of the Rhine. They also protected the [[Papacy]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] faith. When their king [[Pepin the Short]] died, his sons, Charlemagne and [[Carloman]] were chosen to share the kingdom. They divided it into two parts: one half for Charlemagne, and the other for Carloman. Carloman died on December 4, 771, leaving Charlemagne as the leader of the whole Frankish kingdom. 
 
 He was king of the [[Franks]] from 768, and king of the [[Lombards]] from 774. He was crowned [[Imperator Augustus]] (Emperor) in [[Rome]] on Christmas Day by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800, starting the [[Holy Roman Empire]], that they hoped would be a kind of second Western Roman Empire (while the [[Byzantine]]s in [[Constantinople]] were still keeping up the Eastern Roman empire). With many wars, Charlemagne spread his empire across much of [[Western Europe]]. 
 
 Charlemagne fought in many wars over the course of his reign. He is known for using his sword, ''[[Joyeuse]]'', in each of the thirty years of war and the 18 battles he fought in. He also finally managed to conquer [[Saxony]], something the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]] could not do 800 years earlier. He was able to convert the [[Saxons]] to Catholic Christianity. He also had many schools built so his people could learn. However, he also killed thousands of those who failed to convert. 
 
 ==Death== 
 Charlemagne's politics and plans failed, which led to low [[self-esteem]]. His last years were spent in bed in deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. He died in 814, leaving his kingdom to his only son, [[Louis the Pious]]. The descendants of Charlemagne are called ''Carolingians''. His family line died out in Germany in 911 and in France in 987. 
 
 == Battles and campaigns == 
 *Saxon Wars.  The Saxon Wars, also called the Saxon War or Saxon Uprising were the campaigns and insurrections of the thirty-three years from 772, when Charlemagne first entered Saxony with the intent to conquer,
