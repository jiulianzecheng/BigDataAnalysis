 The '''Parazoa''' are an ancestral subkingdom of [[animal]]s, literally translated as  " beside the animals " . Parazoans differ from their [[choanoflagellate]] ancestors in that they are macroscopic and have differentiated cells, but unlike  " true animals "  ([[Eumetazoa]]), they do not have tissues. Most people put [[Placozoa]] in Parazoa, but [[Placozoa]] can also be placed in the subkingdom [[Agnotozoa]].
