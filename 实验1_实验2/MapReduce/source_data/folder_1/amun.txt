 In [[Egyptian mythology]], '''Amun''' was a very powerful [[deity|god]]. He was often combined with [[Ra]] to form the god '''Amun-Ra'''. At one point in [[Egypt]]ian [[history]], he was called the  " King of the Gods " . 
 
 '''Amun''' (also spelled Amon, Amoun, Amen, and sometimes Imen, ''Egyptian'' Yamanu) was the name of a [[deity]], in Egyptian mythology, who became one of the most important deities in Ancient Egypt. In later years, bined with [[Horus]] into one god. 
 
 He began as a Theban wind and fertility god and ended up the supreme deity, with most of Egypt's vast wealth dedicated to his temple. Around the second millennium B.C.E., [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and its cult of Amun grew so powerful that it threatened worship of the sun god, Ra. The two deities merged. Amun-Ra was hailed as a national god, the creator of the universe, the pharaoh's personal protector, and the god of war. 
 
 ==Origin of name== 
 Amun's name is first recorded as ''imn''. That means  " The hidden (one) " . [[Vowel]]s were not written in Egyptian [[hieroglyphics]], but Egyptologists think the name survives into the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] language as ''Amoun.'' 
 
 ==Creator== 
 
 It was thought that he had created himself and then created everything else while remaining distant from the rest of the world. In that sense, he was the original [[inscrutable]] and [[indivisible]] [[creator]].   
 
 Amun was shown in [[human]] form, seated on a throne, wearing on his head a plain deep circlet from which rise two straight parallel plumes, maybe meant as had no father   
 
 * the tail [[feather]]s of a [[bird]]. That would remind of his earlier status as a wind god.  
 
 When Amun had become more important than [[Menthu]], the local [[war]] [[god]] of Thebes, Menthu was called the son of Amun. However, as Mut was infertile, it was believed that she, and thus Amun, had adopted Menthu instead. 
 
 The worship of Ammon as creator was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. When [[Alexander the Great]] invaded Egypt in 332 BC, he was pronounced the metaphorical son of Amun at this oracle, < ref > {{cite book |last=Bosworth |first=A.
