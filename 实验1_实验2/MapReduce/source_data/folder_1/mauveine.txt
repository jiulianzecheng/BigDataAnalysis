 In 1856, [[William Henry Perkin]], then 18, was given a challenge by his professor to [[synthesis|synthesize]] [[quinine]]. His professor, August Wilhelm von Hofmann, was the first director of the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] in [[London]]. 
 
 In one attempt, Perkin [[oxidation|oxidized]] [[aniline]] using [[potassium dichromate]]. This failed, but cleaning the flask with alcohol, Perkin noticed the alcohol had turned purple. 
 
 The dye turned out to be suitable for [[silk]] and other [[textile]]s. It was [[patent]]ed by Perkin, who the next year opened a dyeworks mass-producing it at [[Greenford]] on the banks of the [[Grand Union Canal]] in [[London]]. < ref > Google Earth location: [http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/motm/perkin/mauveine.kml Download] < /ref >    
 
 It was originally called ''aniline purple'' or ''[[Tyrian purple]]'', the name of an ancient [[natural dye]] got from a [[mollusc]]. < ref name= " matthew2004 " >

Mauvine was the first of many.
