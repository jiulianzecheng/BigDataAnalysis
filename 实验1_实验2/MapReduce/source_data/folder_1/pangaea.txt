 '''Pangaea''' < ref > meaning ''entire Earth'' in [[Ancient Greek]] < /ref >  was the global [[supercontinent]] which formed in the [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]]. The process started about 450 [[million]] years ago (mya) and was complete by 210 mya. So, apart from some volcanic islands (not proven, but very likely), all the land areas were collected together in one big supercontinent. 
 
 Pangaea was the latest of a series of global supercontinents. They formed at various times since [[plate tectonics]] began on Earth. < ref > {{Cite web|title=(PDF) Earth as an evolving planetary system |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286392394_Earth_as_an_evolving_planetary_system|access-date=2021-08-13|website=ResearchGate|language=en}} < /ref >  '''Panthalassa''' was the name of the huge global ocean which surrounded Pangaea. 
 
 == Formation == 
 The collisions between [[continental plate]]s formed the greatest mountain ranges in the history of the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. < ref name=C & T > Cocks L.R.M.  &  Torsvik T.H. 2006.

(eds) ''European lithosphere dynamics'', Geological Society of London Memoirs '''32''', pp. 83–95. < /ref >  The mountain building included the [[Caledonian orogeny]], the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenian orogeny]] and the [[Variscan orogeny]]. The low mountains of [[Scotland]], [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[North America]] are the ground-down remains of these vast events. < ref > Stanley, Steven 1998.

 == Break-up == 
 There were three major phases in the break-up of Pangaea. The first signs of [[rift (geology)|rifting]] came in the [[Triassic]] before Pangaea was completely formed. < ref > Van Andel T.J. 1994. ''New views on an old planet: a history of global change''. 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, p138/9. {{ISBN|0-521-44755-0}} < /ref > 
 
 Pangaea broke up about 180/200 million years ago, in the early middle [[Jurassic]]. It broke into supercontinents [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] before each of these broke into the present continents. One rift resulted in a new ocean, the North [[Atlantic Ocean]]. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > Zeeya Merali, Brian J. Skinner ''Visualizing Earth Science''. Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0470-41847-5}} < /ref > 
 
 The second major phase in the break-up of Pangaea began in the [[Lower Cretaceous]] (150–140 & nbsp;mya), when Gondwana separated into continents ([[Africa]], [[South America]], [[India]], [[Antarctica]], and [[Australia]]). < ref name= " ReferenceA " / > 
 
 The third major and final phase of the break-up of Pangaea occurred in the early [[Cenozoic]] ([[Paleocene]] to [[Oligocene]]). [[Laurasia]] split when [[North America]] ([[Laurentia]]) broke free from Eurasia, opening the [[Norwegian Sea]] about 60–55 & nbsp;mya. The Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s continued to expand, closing the [[Tethys Ocean]]. 
 
 The break-up of Pangaea continues today in the [[Great Rift Valley]] in [[East Africa]] and [[Arabia]].
