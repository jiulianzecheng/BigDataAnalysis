 A '''monolith''' is a geological feature. It is a massive [[rock (geology)|stone]] or rock.  
 
 [[Erosion]] usually causes the geological formations, which are often made of very hard and solid [[igneous rock|igneous]] or [[metamorphic rock]]. 
 
 In other words, a monolith is what's left after most of an original rock or mountain is worn away.
