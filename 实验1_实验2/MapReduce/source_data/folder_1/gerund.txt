A '''gerund''' is a [[verb]] used as a [[noun]].  
 
 In English, the '''gerund''' is formed by adding -ing to a verb root. < ref > {{cite web|title=Definition: gerund|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/|archive-date=2012-02-23|publisher=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)|quote=A kind of verbal noun, having only the four oblique cases of the singular number, and governing cases like a participle.|accessdate=2010-03-09}} < /ref >  It is identical in form to the present [[participle]] (ending in ''-ing'') and can behave as a [[verb]] within a [[clause]] (so that it may be modified by an [[adverb]] or have an [[Object (grammar)|object]]), but the clause as a whole (sometimes consisting of only one word, the gerund itself) acts as a [[noun]] within the larger sentence. For example: '''''Eating''' this cake is easy.'' 
 
 In  " Eating this cake is easy " ,  " eating this cake " , although traditionally known as a [[phrase]], is referred to as a [[non-finite clause]] in modern [[linguistics]].   " Eating "  is the verb in the clause, while  " this cake "  is the object of the verb.   " Eating this cake "  acts as a [[noun phrase]] within the sentence as a whole, though; the subject of the sentence is the non-finite clause, specifically ''eating''. 
 
 Other examples of the gerund: 
 * ''I like '''swimming'''.'' (direct object) 
 * '''''Swimming''' is fun.'' ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]]) 
 
 Not all nouns that are identical in form to the present participle are gerunds. < ref > [http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=16 & t= & p=47234#p47234 Re: Post Hey man, I gots ta know (Gerund versus gerundive)], Phil White, Mon August 7, 2006 1:35 pm < /ref >  The formal distinction is that a gerund is a [[verbal noun|''verbal'' noun]] â€“ a noun derived from a verb that retains verb characteristics, that functions ''simultaneously'' as a noun and a verb, while other nouns in the form of the present participle (ending in ''-ing'') are [[deverbal noun|''de''verbal nouns]], which function as common nouns, not as verbs at all. Compare: 
 * ''I like '''fencing'''.'' (gerund, an activity, could be replaced with  " to fence " ) 
 * ''The white '''fencing''' adds to the character of the neighborhood.'' (deverbal, could be replaced with an object such as  " bench " ) 
 
 == Double nature of the gerund == 
 As the result of its origin and development, the gerund has nominal and verbal properties. The ''nominal'' characteristics of the gerund are as follows: 
 # The gerund can perform the function of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Object (grammar)|object]] and [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicative]]: 
 #* '''''Smoking''' endangers your health.'' ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]]) 
 #* ''I like '''making''' people happy.'' ([[Object (grammar)|object]]) 
 # The gerund can be preceded by a [[preposition]]: 
 #* ''I'm tired '''of arguing'''.'' 
 # Like a [[noun]] the gerund can be modified by a [[noun]] in the [[possessive case]], a [[possessive adjective]], or an [[adjective]]: 
 #* ''I wonder at '''John's keeping''' calm.'' 
 #* ''Is there any objection to '''my seeing''' her?'' 
 #* '''''Brisk walking''' relieves stress.'' 
 The ''verbal'' characteristics of the gerund include the following: 
 # The gerund of [[transitive verbs]] can take a [[direct object]]: 
 #* ''I've made good progress in '''speaking Basque'''.'' 
 # The gerund can be modified by an [[adverb]]: 
 #* '''''Breathing deeply''' helps you to calm down.'' 
 # The gerund has the distinctions of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. 
 #* '''''Having read the book once before''' makes me more prepared.'' 
 #* '''''Being deceived''' can make someone feel angry.''
