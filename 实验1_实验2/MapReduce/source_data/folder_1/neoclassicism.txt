 '''Neoclassicism''' is the name given to movements in the [[art]]s that draw upon Western [[Classics|classical]] art and [[culture]] (usually that of [[Ancient Greece]] or [[Ancient Rome]]). < ref name=brit/ >  Traditionally, [[Classicism]] is about the art made in antiquity (very long ago, in ancient times) or later art inspired by that of antiquity. < ref name=brit > {{Cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/120317/Classicism |title=Classicism and Neoclassicism (arts) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=britannica.com |accessdate=1 June 2010}} < /ref >  But Neoclassicism is always about the art made later but inspired by antiquity. < ref name=brit/ >  So, Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used together. It often means clearness, elegance, harmony, and rest made by careful attention to traditional forms. 
 
 Examples of Neoclassicism in [[architecture]] include the [[White House]] and [[Neue Wache]].
