 A '''curse''' is a word which threatens the other person to have bad [[luck]]. Nobody knows if it really works or become true. Some people believe in them even so, that they become true by magic. < ref > On the role of belief for curses cf. Andreas Dorschel, 'Entwurf einer Theorie des Fluchens', ''Variations'' 23 (2015), ยง 12, pp. 167-175, pp. 169-170 < /ref >  For example, for [[fairy tale]]s, the [[prince]]s are cursed to become a [[beast]] or a [[frog]] (i.e. frog prince) by [[witch]]es because of their bad behaviours. But in the end a [[princess]] saves them.  
 
 There was also something called a  " curse tablet "  which [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used to curse people they did not like. They would often let them drift to the river so that the curse will be carried to where that person who has the curse. But many curses are made when people are [[jealous]] and they want that person who has the curse to not do well.  
 
 The opposite of a curse is a [[blessing]].
