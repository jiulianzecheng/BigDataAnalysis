 The treasury as a place to keep the king's (or city's) gold and valuables has a long history. The winners in a war would take back whatever they wanted, and [[slaves]] and booty were top of the list. The first recorded booty in history is a [[stele]] taken during 1160 & nbsp;BC. < ref > Neer, Richard T. 2001. Framing the gift: the politics of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi.

 The term ''treasury'' was first used in [[classical antiquity]] to describe the places built for [[Sacrifice|gifts to the gods]]. An example is the [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]]. Many similar buildings were put up in [[Olympia, Greece]] by city-states hoping to impress others during the [[ancient Olympic Games]]. In [[Ancient Greece]] treasuries were almost always inside religious buildings such as temples. This made state funds sacrosanct, and adding moral constraints to the punishment for thieves.
