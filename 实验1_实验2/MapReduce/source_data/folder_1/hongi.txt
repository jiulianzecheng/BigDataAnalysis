'''Hongi''' is a traditional [[Māori]] [[greeting]] performed by two people pressing their [[nose]]s together; some include, at the same time, the touching of foreheads. The greeting is used at traditional meetings among Māori people, and at major ceremonies, such as a pōwhiri. It may be followed by a handshake.
