 == Gameplay == 
 Registration is free and users are asked to provide the name of their nation, a [[Motto|national motto]], a national animal, and a [[currency]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97793 & page=1|title=A Web Site of Virtual Nations|date=2006-01-07|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}} < /ref >  After playing for a few months, players can also modify their government type and religion, leader, etc. Players can upload or choose a [[flag]] for their nation.  
 
 There is a forum in the game, where players can chat about whatever they like, whether it be [[politics]], recent events, etc. There are three major categories: General, which is for  " discussion and debate about anything " , Forum 7, where you can  " relax, unwind, share a joke, and generally goof off, "  and NationStates, where users can  " come together and discuss matters of varying importance " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=NationStates â€¢ Index page|url=https://forum.nationstates.net/|access-date=2021-01-10|website=forum.nationstates.net}} < /ref >   
 
 Players are able to create and manage ''regions'', which are communities for players. Each region has a ''Regional Message Board'', which acts as a type of [[Internet forum|forum]]. Each region is managed by its ''founder'' (the player who created the region), but players within the region can also choose a ''World Assembly Delegate''. The World Assembly (WA) is an [[Organization|organisation]] and part of the game acting as a stand in for the [[United Nations]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un|title=NationStates {{!}} The World Assembly|website=www.nationstates.net|access-date=2019-03-07}} < /ref >  It makes laws that apply to nations that have joined the WA but nations are not required to be a member. It used to be called  " The United Nations " , however Max Barry was sent an [[E-mail|email]] by the United Nations telling him to not use their [[trademark]] in his game. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://maxbarry.com/2008/04/02/news.html|title=Max Barry {{!}} The United Nations vs Me|website=maxbarry.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}} < /ref > 
 
 Players are also able to create factbook and dispatches about their country, which they can use to tell other people about their country.
