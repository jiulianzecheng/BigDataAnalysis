 A '''soup''' is a kind of [[food]]. People make soups by [[boiling]] things in [[water]]. Then they put the things they boiled into a [[bowl]] and eat them. [[Vegetable|Vegetables]] are in most soups. You can also put meat in soups. Soups that are thicker than normal, with more meat or vegetables, are [[Stew|stews]]. The liquid in soup is [[broth]]. 
 
 Traditionally, soups are classified into two main groups: clear soups and thick soups. The traditional French types of clear soups are [[bouillon]] and [[consommé]]. Thick soups are classified by the type of thickening agent used. [[Purée|Purées]] are [[Vegetable soup|vegetable soups]] thickened with [[starch]]. [[Bisque|Bisques]] are made from puréed [[shellfish]] or vegetables thickened with [[cream]]. Cream soups may be thickened with [[béchamel sauce]]; and [[Velouté|veloutés]] are thickened with eggs, butter, and cream. Other ingredients commonly used to thicken soups and [[Broth|broths]] include [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[rice]], [[lentils]], [[flour]], and [[grains]]. Most soups include [[carrots]] and [[potatoes]]. Some of the most common soups are chicken soup, tomato soup, pumpkin soup, and [[:en:Sopa_de_fideo|sopa de fideos]]. Here is a picture to the right showing a picture of pumpkin soup. 
 
 Canned soup can be condensed, which requires adding water (or sometimes milk), or it can be  " ready-to-eat, "  which requires no additional liquid before eating. Condensed soup (invented in 1897 by Campbell Soup Company chemist John T. Dorrance) allows soup to be packaged in a smaller can and sold at a lower price than other canned soups.  The  " ready-to-eat "  variant of soup can be prepared by simply heating the contents of the can on a kitchen stove or in a microwave oven. Soups like these can be used as a side dish. Soups are usually warm and crisp and can be accompanied with many things such as toast, bread and more. A popular American dish is tomato soup with grilled cheese.
