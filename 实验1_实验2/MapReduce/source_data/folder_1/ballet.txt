 '''Ballet''' is a type of [[dance]]. It is only done by dancers who have had special [[training]]. The dancers are employed by a dance company, and they perform in [[theatre]]s. The first reference to ballet is found in a work of Domenico da Piacenza, who lived in the early [[14th century]].   
 
 Ballet involves the creation of the dance itself, often a type of imaginary story. The story is told with the help of dance and [[mime]]. Ballet is a form of expression. It presents a story in a new form to the audience. The creation of a dance is called [[choreography]]. The choreography is learnt by the dancers under the supervision of a trainer, called a ballet master or mistress. Ballet is always performed to [[music]], and in many cases the music was specially composed for a particular ballet. Ballet is a major part of theatre, and a popular example is ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. 
 
 == History == 
 === Early stages === 
 Ballet grew out of [[Renaissance]] spectacles which, rather like big pop music events today, used every type of performance art. These Italian ballets were further developed in [[France]]. ''Le Ballet Comique de la Reine'' (The Queen's Ballet Comedy) was performed in [[Paris]] in 1581. It was staged by Balthazar de Beaujoyeux, a [[violin]]ist and dancing master at the court of [[Catherine de Medici]]. It was danced by [[amateur]]s in a hall. The royal family were watching at one end and the others in galleries on three sides. Poetry and songs came with the dances. < ref name= " history " > {{Cite web |url= http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html |title=Dancing Online, History of Ballet |work=ccs.neu.edu |access-date=1 May 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 The basis of classical ballet was formed in the Court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in [[France]], in the 17th century. < ref name=Oxford > Crane, Debra  &  Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p40 < /sup >  Even his title (the 'Sun King') came from a role he danced in a ballet. Louis founded the first ballet company, the Ballet de l'Opera de Paris. Many of the ballets presented at his court were created by the composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and the choreographer Pierre Beauchamp. Also during this time, the playwright [[Molière]] invented the comedie-ballet. < ref name= " history " / > 
 
 === Modern technique begins === 
 In the early 19th century ballet technique was codified (sorted out and written down) by Carlo Blasis (1797–1878) of [[Naples]]. His dance classes, four hours long, were famous for being the toughest training there was at that time. 'Romantic ballet' flourished in France in the first half of the 19th century. 
 
 Ballet with a more athletic style was developed in [[Imperial Russia]] of the late 19th century. This company performed in the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] at [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. The three famous [[Tchaikovsky]] ballets, ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''The [[Sleeping Beauty]]'', and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', date from that time.  
 
 The next stage was the [[Diaghilev]] ballet. Diagelev was a great [[impresario]] (showman). In 1909 he founded [[Les Ballets Russes de Sergei Diaghilev]], considered by many to be the greatest ballet company of all time. 
 : " Its success was so extraordinary, its ballets so revolutionary, and its artists so electrifying that its appearance in [[Paris]] before the [[First World War]] sparked an international ballet boom " . < ref name=Oxford/ > < sup > p47 < /sup >   
 
 His dancers included the legendary [[Nijinsky]] and the Imperial prima[[ballerina]] [[Karsavina]]; also [[Pavlova]], [[Danilova]] and [[Spessivtseva]]. His choreographers included [[Fokine]], [[Massine]] and [[Balanchine]]; his composers included [[Stravinsky]], [[Prokofiev]], [[Ravel]] and [[Debussy]]; his set designers included [[Picasso]], [[Cezanne]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Utrillo]], [[Bakst]]  and [[Braque]]; and the ballets created changed the course of ballet history. 
 
 Later in the 20th century, permanent ballet companies were set up in English-speaking countries. The [[Royal Ballet]] in [[London]] was started, and in [[New York City|New York]] a company called the ''Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo'' was founded (1938–1962). 
 
 ==Technique== 
 Technique is the physical ability to perform whatever steps a dance may need. < ref > Anderson, Jack. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/02/arts/dance-view-in-quest-of-that-singular-quality-known-as-style.html   " In quest of that singular quality known as style, " ] ''New York Times.'' September 2, 1990; retrieved 2011-12-29. < /ref >  Specific methods for refining technique are named after the ballet master or mistress who started them, such as the Vaganova method after [[Agrippina Vaganova]], the Balanchine method after [[George Balanchine]], and the [[Cecchetti method]] after [[Enrico Cecchetti]].
