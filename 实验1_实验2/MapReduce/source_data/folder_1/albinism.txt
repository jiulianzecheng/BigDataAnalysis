 '''Albinism''' is a condition some [[people]], [[animal]]s, and [[Plant|plants]]  are born with. This condition is caused by a lack of [[pigment]] [[melanin]] (colour) in their [[hair]], [[eye]]s, and [[skin]]. A person or animal with albinism is called an '''albino.''' Many albino people prefer to be called a  " person with albinism " . There are ten different types of albinism. 
 
 People with albinism can have white or light [[blonde]] hair. They can have very [[wikt:pale|pale]] skin. Their eyes are blue, or rarely pink-ish. People with albinism can have problems such as bad vision, increased sweat and getting [[sunburn]]t easily. This is because people with albinism have less [[pigment]]s in their eyes, skin and hair. < ref name= " albinism.org " > {{cite web|url=http://www.albinism.org/publications/what_is_albinism.html|title=What is Albinism|publisher=albinism.org|access-date=2007-07-31|archive-date=2012-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514003907/http://albinism.org/publications/what_is_albinism.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Albinism is rare in the United States. One out of every 20,000 people in the United States has albinism. There are about 15,945 people in the United States who have albinism. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/HWRC/hits?r=d & origSearch=true & rlt=1 & o= & bucket=ref & n=10 & l=d & searchTerm=2NTA & index=BA & basicSearchOption=KE & tcit=1_1_0_0_0_1 & c=1 & docNum=DU2601000036 & locID=palo88030 & secondary=false & t=RK & s=1 & SU=albinism|title=Albinism|last=Turkington|first=Carol|date=22 Feb 2016|website=Health  &  Wellness resource center}} < /ref > 
 
 Vision problems in albinism include [[nystagmus]] (irregular fast movements of the eyes), [[strabismus]] (where the eyes fail to balance) and [[refractory errors]] (like being ''near-sighted'' or ''far-sighted''). 
 
 In most environments, Albino animals are more easily seen and so may be attacked by predators. They lack the [[camouflage]] that the non-albino members of their species have. Also, where colour is a factor in [[mate]] selection, they may be at a disadvantage there, too. 
 
 == Genetics of albinism == 
 Albinism is a [[inheritance|hereditary]] condition. It is usually inherited in a [[recessive]] pattern; it means, both parents have to give the albinism gene to a child to cause albinism. < ref name= " albinism.org " / >  Parents pass on pairs of genes to their children. One of the pairs of genes is in charge of making melanin. If both of these genes are flawed, then little or no pigment is made. If only one gene is flawed then pigment can still be made. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/HWRC/hits?r=d & origSearch=true & rlt=1 & o= & bucket=ref & n=10 & l=d & searchTerm=2NTA & index=BA & basicSearchOption=KE & tcit=1_1_0_0_0_1 & c=1 & docNum=DU2601000036 & locID=palo88030 & secondary=false & t=RK & s=1 & SU=albinism|title=Albinism|last=Turkington|first=Carol|date=22 Feb 2016|website=Health  &  Wellness Resource Center}} < /ref >
