 '''Prosopagnosia,''' also called '''face blindness,''' < ref > 1. Joshua Davis, " Face Blind, "  ''Wired,'' Nov 1, 2006, accessed Feb 13, 2016,  < nowiki > http://www.wired.com/2006/11/blind/ < /nowiki > < /ref >   is a condition where a person cannot recognize [[face]]s, ''even their own''. At first it was thought to be a condition caused by severe [[brain damage]] (acquired prosopagnosia). It may be caused by a head [[injury]] to the [[temporal lobe]] of the [[brain]]. 
 
 However, a [[congenital disorder|congenital]] (inherited [[birth defect]]) or developmental form of the disorder does exist, with a prevalence rate of 2.5%. That is quite a high rate. < ref name= " Gruter 2008 " > {{cite journal |vauthors=Grüter T, Grüter M, Carbon CC |title= Neural and genetic foundations of face recognition and prosopagnosia |journal= J Neuropsychol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=79–97 |year=2008 |pmid=19334306 |doi=10.1348/174866407X231001|citeseerx= 10.1.1.571.9472 }} < /ref >  What this defect shows is that our picture of the world is built up by various brain systems, and we do not notice how this is done. It seems seamless and automatic. Actually, there are many brain [[Mechanism|mechanisms]] which normally work together, tying the visual scene to memory so that we recall vital information. It is difficult to think of anything more vital than remembering who we know, and what their relationship is to us.  
 ''People with prosopagnosia never develop the ability to recognize faces''. They may be able to rely on other physical features, such as the way someone walks and talks, their hair color, their height and build, etc.  Prosopagnosia is not curable or treatable. 
 
 The opposite of prosopagnosia is the skill of superior face recognition ability.  People with this ability are called  " super recognizers " . < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/world/europe/salisbury-novichok-poisoning.html?action=click & module=Top%20Stories & pgtype=Homepage|title=From mountain of CCTV footage, pay dirt: 2 Russians are named in spy poisoning. |last=Barry |first=Elen |date=September 5, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 6, 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Cause== 
 Prosopagnosia can be caused by [[lesion]]s (damage or changes to body tissue) in the lower part of the brain. < ref name= " Mayer 2007 " > {{cite book|last1 = Mayer|first1 = Eugene|last2 = Rossion|first2 = Bruno|title = Prosopagnosia|edition = 1|editor = Olivier Godefroy, Julien Bogousslavsky|work = The Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology of Stroke|pages = 315–334|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2007|location = New York|url = http://www.nefy.ucl.ac.be/facecatlab/PDF/Mayer-Rossion07.pdf|doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511544880.017|isbn = 9780521842617|oclc = 468190971|access-date = 2017-12-26|archive-date = 2013-07-01|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130701194802/http://www.nefy.ucl.ac.be/facecatlab/PDF/Mayer-Rossion07.pdf|url-status = dead}} < /ref >  It can also be caused by damaging the nerves in the lower part of the brain, called 'acquired prosopagnosia'. It can be caused by [[birth defect]]s, [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], [[encephalitis]] (inflammation of the brain), [[Parkinson's disease]], or [[Alzheimer's disease]]. 
 
 Doctors can check patients for prosopagnosia by using [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] scans to see if their brain reacts when they see faces. < ref name= " Mayer 2007 " / > 
 
 An analysis of family inheritance (pedigree trees) suggest that a dominant [[gene mutation]] may be the root cause of the condition when it is present from birth. This mode of inheritance explains why HPA is so common among certain families. < ref name= " Kennerknecht " > {{Cite journal | last1 = Kennerknecht | first1 = I. | last2 = Grueter | first2 = T. | last3 = Welling | first3 = B. | last4 = Wentzek | first4 = S. | last5 = Horst | first5 = J.

 An account of a woman who cannot recognise her own face is an example of prosopagnosia. < ref > Prosopagnosia: The artist in search of her face. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53192821] < /ref >   Its special interest is that she can recognise all inanimate objects, and all animals except humans {{ndash}} and chimpanzees!
