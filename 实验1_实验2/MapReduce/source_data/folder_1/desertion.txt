 '''Desertion''' is a [[military]] word which means a [[soldier]] has left his position without [[wikt:permission|permission]]. The soldier does not plan on returning. The term '''Absence Without Leave (AWOL)''' can also be used, but is usually used where the soldier does intend to return. Usually a soldier who has been AWOL for more than 30 days is listed as a deserter. Deserting is treated as a serious offense; military law usually provides for the [[death penalty]]. The last United States soldier executed for desertion was Eddie Slovik in 1945. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Slovik.html |title=Eddie Slovik |work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |year=2012 |access-date=13 June 2012}} < /ref >  No U.S. soldier has been given more than 18 & nbsp;months in [[prison]] for desertion during the [[Iraq War]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.nlgmltf.org/onWatch/Onwatch_xx-3_Jan_Feb_2009.pdf |title=''On Watch''  " AWOL in the Army, version 2.0 " , James M.
