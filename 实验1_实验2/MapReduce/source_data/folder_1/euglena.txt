 '''''Euglena''''' is a large [[genus]] of [[unicellular]] [[protist]]s: they have both plant and animal characteristics. 
 
 All live in water, and move by means of a [[flagellum]]. This is an animal characteristic. Most have [[chloroplast]]s, which are characteristic of [[alga]]e and [[plant]]s. 
 
 Euglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up [[green algae]] by secondary [[endosymbiosis]]. < ref name= " pmid19335769 " > {{cite journal |author=Keeling PJ |title=Chromalveolates and the evolution of plastids by secondary endosymbiosis |journal=J.

 Over 1,000 species of ''Euglena'' have been described, and there are more to be discovered. Their relationships are being analysed. < ref > Montegut-Felkner, Ann E.  &  Triemer, Richard E. 1997.

 __TOC__ 
 
 ==Form and function== 
 When acting as a [[heterotroph]] (animal), the ''Euglena'' surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by [[phagocytosis]]. When acting as an autotroph, the ''Euglena'' has chloroplasts which produce sugars by [[photosynthesis]]. The chloroplasts use the pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. 
 
 The number and shape of chloroplasts within ''Euglena'' varies greatly. ''Euglena'' are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large [[flagellum]] for locomotion. To detect light, the cell has an [[eyespot]], a primitive [[organelle]] that filters sunlight into light-detecting, photo-sensitive structures. These structures, at the base of the flagellum, allow only certain wavelengths of light to register. With the aid of this photo-sensitive area,  the ''Euglena'' can shift its position to get better photosynthesis. 
 
 The mobility of ''Euglena'' also allows hunting. Most ''Euglena'' are considered [[mixotroph]]s: [[autotroph]]s in sunlight and [[heterotroph]]s in the dark. ''Euglena'' do not have plant cell walls, but have a [[pellicle]] instead. The pellicle is made of protein bands that spiral down the length of the ''Euglena'' and lie beneath the [[plasma membrane]]. < ref > Sommer, Joanchim R. 1965. The ultrastructure of the pellicle complex of ''Euglena gracilis''. ''Journal of Cell Biology''. '''24''': 253-257. < /ref > 
 
 ''Euglena'' can survive in fresh and salt water. In low moisture conditions, ''Euglena'' forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a [[spore]] until environmental conditions improve. ''Euglena'' can also survive in the dark by storing starch-like paramylon granules inside the chloroplast.

 ==Reproduction== 
 ''Euglenas'' reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]] by binary fission. There is no evidence of [[sexual reproduction]]. Reproduction includes transverse division and longitudinal division, which both occur in the active and encysted forms. 
 
 == As a food source == 
 Starting in 2005, the Tokyo-based Euglena Company now markets ''Euglena''-based food and beverage products. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.euglena.jp/en/company/profile.html |title=Corporate Profile  & #124; euglena Co., Ltd. |access-date=2018-06-24 |archive-date=2018-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704174713/http://www.euglena.jp/en/company/profile.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The fitness of ''Euglena'' for human consumption had been thought about before, but this is the first attempt to cultivate and farm it. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/07/25/is-this-the-future-of-food/|title=Is the Future of Food in Tokyo?|first=Jeff|last=Yang|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=25 July 2013|publisher=}} < /ref >  The company's main production facility is on [[Ishigaki Island]], [[Okinawa]], where there is a favourable [[climate]]. 
 
 Euglena Company is also experimenting with the use of ''Euglena'' as a potential fuel source. < ref > NHK World, ''Rising'', 26 June 2015 < /ref >
