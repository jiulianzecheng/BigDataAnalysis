 The '''Peshitta''' ([[Classical Syriac]] {{lang|arc|ܦܹܫܝܼܛܵܐ}} for  " simple, common, straight, [[vulgate]] " ) is the standard version of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] [[Bible]]. 
 
 The [[Old Testament]] of the Peshitta was translated from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], probably in the 2nd century. The [[New Testament]] of the Peshitta, which originally excluded certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become the standard by the early 5th century.
