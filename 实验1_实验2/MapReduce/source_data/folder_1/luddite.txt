 The '''Luddites''' were an early 19th century [[extremism|radical]] group which destroyed [[textile]] [[machinery]] as a form of [[protest]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://thebaffler.com/latest/a-nod-to-ned-ludd|title=A nod to Ned Ludd|access-date=6 November 2018}} < /ref >   
 
 The group was protesting against the use of machinery in a  " fraudulent and deceitful manner "  to get around standard labour practices. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?no-ist= & page=2|title=What the Luddites really fought against|access-date=8 December 2016}} < /ref >  They were [[England|English]] [[textile]] workers who took an [[oath]] to resist machinery in the textile industry.  
 
 Luddites feared  that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry. They were largely correct, but on the other hand, the textile industry grew to be a major exporter of cloth. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/who-were-the-luddites|title=Who were the Luddites? |newspaper=History.com|access-date=2016-12-12}} < /ref >   
 
 It is not quite right that Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt progress. However, over time, the term has come to mean one opposed to [[industrialisation]], [[automation]], or new [[technology|technologies]] in general. < ref > [http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dev_dict & field-12668446=luddite & branch=13842570 & textsearchtype=exact & sortorder=score%2Cname  " Luddite " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220002904/https://languages.oup.com/ |date=2021-02-20 }} ''Compact Oxford English Dictionary'' at AskOxford.com.

 The Luddite movement began in [[Nottingham]] and ended in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. [[Mill]] and [[factory]] owners took to shooting protesters. Eventually the movement was suppressed with military force.
