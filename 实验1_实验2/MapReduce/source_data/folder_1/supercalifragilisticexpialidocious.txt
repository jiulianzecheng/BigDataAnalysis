 The writers of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' think that the word   " supercalifragilisticexpialidocious "  was first used in the 1940s. < ref name= " oed.com " > {{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/194228|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2016}} < /ref >  The word is a compound word, and said by Richard Lederer in his book ''Crazy English'' to be made up of these words: super-  " above " , cali-  " beauty " , fragilistic-  " delicate " , expiali-  " to atone " , and -docious  " educable " , with all of these parts combined meaning  " Atoning for educability through delicate beauty. "  According to the movie, in which the word became widely used, the word is  " something to say when you have nothing to say " . However, a lot of people think the word means  " extraordinarily good "  or  " wonderful "  because all mentions of the word in the movie can be thought of as good.
