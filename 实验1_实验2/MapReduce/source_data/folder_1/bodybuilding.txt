 '''Bodybuilding''' is an [[wikt:activity|activity]] where people develop their [[muscles]]. It is a form of [[human body]] change which uses intensive [[muscle]] [[hypertrophy]]. 
 
 An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a ''bodybuilder''. In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders display their [[physiques]] to a panel of [[judge]]s, who assign points based on their appearance. 
 
 The muscles are revealed through a process known as the  " cutting phase "  - a combination of [[Adipose tissue|fat]] loss, [[oil]]s, and [[tanning]] which, combined with the lighting, make the definition of the muscle group more distinct.
