 }} 
 '''''Cannabis''''' is a genus of plant. There are three [[species]]: ''Cannabis sativa'', ''Cannabis indica'', and ''Cannabis ruderalis''. 
 
 The cannabis plant's flowers contain a [[chemical]] or [[drug]] known as [[THC]] (short for ''tetra-hydro-cannabinol''). Smoking or eating the flower can make a person feel [[euphoria|euphoric]] (very good) or sleepy. The plant is also used to make [[hemp]] fibre, and for its [[seed]]s and seed oil. 
 
 In its natural [[environment]], THC's purpose was to [[defence against herbivory|protect itself against being eaten]]. There are many varieties of cannabis, < ref > Small E 1975. American law and the species problem in ''Cannabis'': science and semantics. ''Bulletin on narcotics'' '''27''' (3): 1–20. < /ref >  and those low on THC production are selected for producing hemp and [[seed]]s. 
 
 Since the 19th century, Cannabis has become an [[Cannabis (drug)|illegal drug]] in many countries.  In the 21st century, some countries have made cannabis legal again.  Others allow cannabis to be used as [[medicine]] when people have certain medical conditions. 
 
 == Ancient history == 
 [[Scientist]]s believe that cannabis first grew somewhere in the [[Himalayas]]. < ref > Marijuana and the Cannabinoids " , ElSohly(p.8) < /ref >  [[Evidence]] of people smoking cannabis goes as far back as [[prehistory]]: [[archaeologist]]s have found burnt hemp seeds at a [[burial]] site in what is now [[Romania]]. < ref > Rudgley, Richard (1998). Lost civilisations of the Stone Age. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-684-85580-1}}. < /ref >

 The most famous users of cannabis were the ancient [[Hindu]]s, who called it ''ganjika'' in [[Sanskrit]] (''ganja'' in modern [[Indian languages]]). < ref name= " Miller 1911 " > Miller, Ga (1911). Encyclopædia Britannica. 34 (11th ed.). 761–762. doi:10.1126/science.34.883.761 < /ref >  According to [[legend]], the Indian [[god]] [[Shiva]] told his followers to [[worship]] the plant. The ancient drug [[soma]] was sometimes associated with cannabis. 
 
 People in the [[Persian Empire]] (what is now [[Iran]]) would light giant campfires made of cannabis, exposing themselves to the [[smoke]].  The ceremony was known as  " the booz-rooz. " < ref > Ibn Taymiyya (2001). Le haschich et l'extase. Beyrouth: Albouraq. {{ISBN|2841-61174-4}} < /ref > 
 
 Cannabis was also known in [[ancient Greece]], where [[magician]]s would burn its flowers in order to cause strange thoughts in the audience members'  minds. [[Historian]]s think that the [[cult]] of [[Dionysus]] also began in ancient Greece and involved [[inhalation|inhaling]] cannabis smoke. < ref name= " Miller 1911 " / > '' 
 
 == Drug effects == 
 {{Unsourced section}}{{Main|Cannabis (drug)}} 
 
 When a person inhales cannabis smoke or consumes cannabis, he or she may get a feeling called  " getting high "  or  " getting stoned " . Cannabis's most common effects include feeling happy, relaxed, tired, silly or scared; having many ideas about what to do; not being able to think clearly (or remember some things at all); and getting hungry (also called getting  " the munchies " ). Smoking cannabis changes how people think and feel, making it either harder or easier to solve some problems. Some people who take cannabis feel strange or [[paranoia|paranoid]] (worried that something bad is going to happen). 
 
 [[Hashish]] (dried [[resin]]) is much more [[concentration|concentrated]] than cannabis (it includes both [[leaf|leaves]] and flowers).  Because of this, people who take large amounts of hashish may feel even stronger effects. They may also [[hallucination|see things]] or [[Auditory hallucination|hear things]] that do not exist (these are called [[hallucination]]s). They may also have strange thoughts. Some hashish users like the feeling of these visions and thoughts, while others may find them scary.  However, people rarely get hallucinations after smoking or eating cannabis. 
 
 ==Legal status== 
 
 ===Medical cannabis=== 
 In the 2010s many [[country|countries]] and some states in the [[United States]] made it legal for people with certain medical problems to use cannabis as [[medication|a medicine]].  Medical use of cannabis is legal in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], Greece, [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  In March 2017 Germany legalised cannabis for medical use with treatment of pain and symptoms by chronic diseases. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cannabis für die Psyche gesund?

Not much known about the broad spectrum of medical cannabis efficacy as the drug is still listed under the German narcotics act (in German  " Betäubungsmittelgesetz "  or abbr.  " BtMG " ). 
 
 In the United States, as of February 2018, 30 states, plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Guam]], had legalized medical cannabis. However, using cannabis for any reason is still illegal under [[federal law]]. < ref name= " ncsl " > {{cite web |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx |title=State Medical Marijuana Laws |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=June 8, 2016 |publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures |access-date=June 13, 2016 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html|title=State Marijuana Laws in 2018 Map|website=www.governing.com|date=7 November 2012|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}} < /ref > 
 
 According to a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, cannabis (especially THC) can decrease [[pain]]; control [[nausea]] and [[vomit]]ing; and improve [[appetite]]. < ref > {{cite book | authors=Joy, Janet E.; Watson, Jr., Stanley J.;  &  Benson, Jr., John A. | date=1999 | publisher=The National Academies Press | title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base | url=https://archive.org/details/marijuanamedicin0000unse | isbn=978-0-309-07155-0}} < /ref >   As of June 2016, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures,  " Further studies have found that cannabis [helps] some of the [[symptom]]s of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[cancer]], [[glaucoma]], and [[multiple sclerosis]]. < ref name= " ncsl "  / >

 == Health risks == 
 [[File:Joint(detail).jpg|thumb|200px|A  " joint " ]] 
 Cannabis is one of the least dangerous of the commonly used illegal drugs. It is almost impossible to [[overdose]] on cannabis. A person would have to smoke their entire body weight in five minutes in order to overdose. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/atod/marijuana.htm |title=Health Education {{!}} Marijuana |access-date=2009-03-29}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.fcda.org/judge.young.htm |title=Medical Marijuana Keystone Document |access-date=2009-03-29 |archive-date=2009-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227074401/http://www.fcda.org/judge.young.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/827177/how_marijuana_can_kill_you_why_a_cannabis.html |title=How Marijuana Can Kill You: Why a Cannabis Overdose is Impossible |access-date=2009-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723043731/http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/827177/how_marijuana_can_kill_you_why_a_cannabis.html?cat=71|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-23}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.diamondcbd.com/hemp-blog/cannabinoid-overdose |title=Cannabinoid Overdose: Is It Possible |access-date=2022-10-02}} < /ref > 
 
 As of 1995, [[scientist]]s had not shown that smoking cannabis causes [[lung cancer]], even in people who smoke a lot of cannabis for a long time. < ref > Turner, Carlton E.

 It is a common, yet false, belief that people who use cannabis are less interested in life and may not want to go to school or work (scientists call this  " amotivational [[syndrome]] " ). However, many reports show that people who use cannabis do just as well as non-users. < ref > {{cite book |title=The Strange Career of Marihuana: Politics and Ideology of Drug Control in America. |url=https://archive.org/details/strangecareerofm0000himm |last=Himmelstein |first=J.L. |year=1983|publisher= Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313235171}} < /ref > < ref > Pope, H.G. et al., “Drug Use and Life Style Among College Undergraduates in 1989:  A Comparison With 1969 and 1978,” American Journal of Psychiatry 147 (1990): 998-1001. < /ref > 
 
 ===Driving while  " stoned " === 
 
 A person who is intoxicated ( " high "  or  " stoned " ) from cannabis could get hurt or killed in an [[Car accident|accident if they drive a car]]. It is not safe to drive under the influence of any [[intoxicant]].  However, drivers who are  " stoned "  are much less likely to get into car accidents than [[Drunk driving|drunk drivers]] and in some cases, sober drivers. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Moskowitz |first1=Herbert |first2=Robert|last2= Petersen |year=1982 |title=Marijuana and Driving: A Review |journal=American Council for Drug Education}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Sewell|first1=R.

 ===Addiction=== 
 {{See also|Addiction}} 
 
 " Hard drugs " , such as [[heroin]], [[methamphetamine|meth]], and [[cocaine]], are chemically [[addiction|addictive]]. This means that if a person starts taking heroin, meth, or cocaine, that person's body will physically need to keep taking the drug. If they try to stop using the drug, they may become very sick.  Cannabis and hashish are not ''chemically'' addictive, but they can be ''[[psychology|psychologically]]'' or [[habit]]ually addictive. This means that people can get so used to the pleasure cannabis causes that they feel as if they need the drug. Unlike with [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and hard drugs, most people who use cannabis can stop taking it when they want, while experiencing only minor withdrawal symptoms.
