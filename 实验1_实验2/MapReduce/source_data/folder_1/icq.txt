 '''ICQ''' is a cross-platform [[instant messaging]] and [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] client. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase  " I Seek You " . Originally developed by the [[Israel]]i company [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] in 1996, the client was [[Acquisition|bought]] by [[AOL]] in 1998, and then by [[Mail.Ru|Mail.Ru Group]] in 2010. 
 
 The ICQ client [[Computer program|application]] and service were initially released in November 1996, freely available to [[download]]. ICQ was among the first stand-alone instant messenger (IM)â€”while real-time chat was not in itself new ([[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) being the most common platform at the time), the concept of a fully centralized service with individual user accounts focused on one-on-one conversations set the blueprint for later instant messaging services like [[AIM (software)|AIM]], and its influence is seen in modern [[Social network service|social media]] applications. ICQ became the first widely adopted IM platform. 
 
 At its peak around 2001, ICQ had more than 100 million accounts registered. At the time of the Mail.Ru acquisition in 2010, there were around 42 million daily users. Since 2013, ICQ has 11 million monthly users.
