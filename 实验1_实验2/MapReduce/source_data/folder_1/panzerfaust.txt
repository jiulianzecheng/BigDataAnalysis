 A '''Panzerfaust''' is a recoilless [[rifle]] that was invented by [[Germany]]. A Panzerfaust can only be used once unlike the [[Panzerschreck]] or the [[Bazooka]]. The Panzerfaust was used heavily late in [[World War II]], especially during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. They were made in very large numbers. They were less powerful than later [[Rocket-propelled grenade]]s.
