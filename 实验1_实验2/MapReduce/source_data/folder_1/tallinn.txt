 '''Tallinn''' is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[Estonia]]. It is on the north-eastern coast of Estonia and borders the [[Gulf of Finland]]. The city is next to many [[lake]]s. The largest of these lakes is called [[Lake Ülemiste]], and most Tallinnites get their drinking water from this lake. 
 
 [[Old Town of Tallinn|Tallinn's Old Town]], which is the historic town center, is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. < ref name= " unesco " > {{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/822/ |title=Historic Centre (Old Town) of Tallinn |publisher=UNESCO}} < /ref > < ref name= " officialweb " > {{cite web |url=http://www.gi.ee/WOGOGOB/wogogob_web.pdf?ref=starshemale.com#page=111 |title=History of Tallinn |publisher=Official Website of Tallinn |date=23 January 2008 |access-date=6 August 2012 |archive-date=5 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305182937/http://www.gi.ee/WOGOGOB/wogogob_web.pdf?ref=starshemale.com#page=111 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 Tallinn first appeared on a map in 1154, when the [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], calling the city ''Qlwn'', added it to his map of the world. < ref name= " wogobob " > {{cite web |author=Nõlvak, Jaak |url=http://www.gi.ee/WOGOGOB/wogogob_web.pdf?ref=starshemale.com#page=111 |title=A glance at the history and geology of Tallinn |date=2004 |work=WOGOGOB-2004 Conference Materials |publisher=University of Tartu |access-date=2012-08-06 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305182937/http://www.gi.ee/WOGOGOB/wogogob_web.pdf?ref=starshemale.com#page=111 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   After being conquered by the [[Denmark|Danes]], the city was known as '''''Reval''''' until Estonia became an independent nation in the 1920s. 
 
 In [[1285]], the city became a part of the [[Hanseatic League]]. As a result, in the [[Middle Ages]] Tallinn was an important stop on the trade routes between [[Europe]] and [[Russia]]. < ref name= " wogobob "  / >  During its history Estonia has been ruled at times by [[Sweden]] and by Russia. It became independent in 1918 after [[World War I]], but after [[World War II]] it was ruled by the [[USSR]]. In March [[1944]] Tallinn was bombed by Soviet Air Force, killing 436 civilians and totally destroying 5073 buildings. Since 1991, Tallinn has been the capital of an independent Estonia. 
 
 Today more than 400,000 people live in Tallinn, which is one third of the population of Estonia. It is a big sea port. Its [[food]] and [[textile]] industries are important. The town has many pretty, old buildings.
