 '''Colorado''' is a state in the western United States. Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city is [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Other large cities are [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] and [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]. Colorado became the 38th [[US state|state]] admitted to the union on August 1, 1876. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Native American]]s first settled in Colorado. The prominent Colorado Native Americans are the Navajo, Ute, and Cheyenne-Arapahoe Indians. The state was named after the [[Colorado River]] by Spanish explorers. US Army officer and [[amateur]] explorer [[Zebulon Pike]] was recruited by the United States government in 1806 to find the source of the [[Mississippi River]] and to check out Spanish settlements in [[New Mexico]]. < ref > {{cite web|url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/pike-expedition-sets-out|title = Pike expedition sets out|website = |publisher = History.com}} < /ref >  Even though his recorded location for the source of the Mississippi was extremely inaccurate and allegedly got lost in his expedition, he did explore much of what would become the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]. When he reached what is now [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], he named a mountain after himself, [[Pikes Peak]], which remains a symbol for the city as well as the state to this day. Colorado has a long history of mining and digging for [[gold]]. It is the place where the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] took place. When gold in California was becoming harder and harder to find, people came to Colorado in large numbers when gold was discovered there in 1859, ten years after the [[California Gold Rush]] began. Many mining camps set up in Colorado would later become cities, such as Denver City and Boulder City. The motto for the gold rush was  " [[Pike's Peak or Bust]] " .  
 
 ==Geography== 
 [[File:National-atlas-colorado.png|180px|left|thumb|A map of Colorado]] 
 The State of Colorado is shaped like a [[rectangle]]. The borders are [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] lines. The four borders are at 37°N, 41°N, 102°03'W, and 109°03'W. (The east and west borders are 25°W and 32°W from the Washington Meridian.) Colorado, [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] are the only three U.S. states that have only lines of latitude and longitude for [[boundaries]] and that have no natural borders. When government [[surveyor]]s made the border markers for the  " Territory of Colorado " , minor surveying mistakes made many small [[wikt:twist|kinks]] along the borders, most seen along the border with the  " Territory of Utah. " 
 
 The tip of [[Mount Elbert]] at 14,440 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] (4,401 & nbsp;m) [[elevation]] in Lake County is the state's highest point and the highest point in the entire [[Rocky Mountains]]. Colorado has more than 100 [[mountain]] peaks that reach over 4,000 [[meter]]s (13,123 & nbsp;ft) in height. Colorado is the only U.S. state that lies [[wikt:entirely|entirely]] above 1,000 & nbsp;meters (3,281 & nbsp;ft) in height. Colorado has the highest average elevation of any state at 6,800 & nbsp;ft. < ref > {{cite web|url = http://www.netstate.com/states/tables/state_elevation_mean.htm|title = 50 State Elevations (mean elevation)|website = Netstate.com}} < /ref >  It borders [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Wyoming]]. 
 
 The land area of Colorado is roughly the same size as New Zealand. < ref > {{cite web|url = http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!MTU5MjExMzE.Nzc3NTExMw*MTkzMDE4ODA(MzE1ODg5OTA~!CONTIGUOUS_US*MTAwMjQwNzU.MjUwMjM1MTc(MTc1)MA~!IN*NTI2NDA1MQ.Nzg2MzQyMQ)Mg~!CN*OTkyMTY5Nw.NzMxNDcwNQ(MjI1)MQ~!US-CO*MA.MTgwMDAwMDA)Mw|title = The True Size Of...|website = }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 The weather and temperatures in Colorado are quite different [[wikt:compared|compared]] to most of the United States. In most other states, the southern part is warmer than the northern part, southern Colorado is not noticeably warmer than northern Colorado. Mountains and surrounding [[valley]]s greatly [[wikt:affect|affect]] [[wikt:local|local]] climate. As a normal rule, with an [[wikt:increase|increase]] in height comes a [[wikt:decrease|decrease]] in [[temperature]] and an increase in rain. The [[Rocky Mountains]] on the west have a very different [[climate]] than the [[Great Plains]] on the east. Between these two areas is a smaller mountain range known as  " the Foothills " . 
 
 ==Population== 
 [[File:Colorado population map.png|180px|left|thumb|A population density map of Colorado]] 
 The state's largest city, and [[capital (city)|capital]], is [[Denver]]. The  " Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area " , is home to 2,927,911 people, it has more than two-thirds of the state's population. 
 
 As of 2005, Colorado has an [[wikt:estimated|estimated]] population of 4,665,177, which is an [[wikt:increase|increase]] of 63,356, or 1.4%, from the last year and an increase of 363,162, or 8.4%, since the year 2000. This has a natural increase since the last census of 205,321 people (that is 353,091 births minus 147,770 deaths) and an increase because of [[human migration|migration]] of 159,957 people into the state. [[Immigration]] from outside the United States makes a net increase of 112,217 people, and migration within the country made a net increase of 47,740 people.
