 The [[genus]] '''''Amanita''''' contains a [[species|species]] of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[mushrooms]], including some of the most [[toxic]] known. It is found worldwide. 
 
 This genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from [[mushroom]] [[poison]]ing, with the '''death cap''' accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is [[amanitin]], of which at least eight versions are known. < ref > North, Pamela Mildred 1967. ''Poisonous plants and fungi in color''.

 === Fly agaric === 
 {{main|Fly agaric}} 
 '''''Amanita muscaria''''', commonly known as the ''fly agaric'', is a [[psychoactive]] [[fungus]]. It is known as the fly agaric for its ability to kill houseflies when combined with milk. The reason for this is that flies are attracted to the milk because it is so sweet. When they drink the milk they feel the effects of the mushroom and begin to get intoxicated. 
 
 === Death cap === 
 '''''Amanita phalloides''''', commonly known as the ''death cap'', is a deadly poisonous [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''Amanita''. Widely distributed across [[Europe]], ''A. phalloides'' forms ecto[[mycorrhiza]]s with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, death cap has been accidentally introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of [[oak]], [[chestnut]], and [[pine]]. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in color, with a white stipe (stem) and gills (underneath the cap). 
 
 One mushroom, if eaten, may destroy the [[liver]] and cause death. There is no [[antidote]]. < ref name=ben > Benjamin, Denis R. 1995.

 === Toxins === 
 Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of [[RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase II]], a vital [[enzyme]] in the synthesis of [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), [[microRNA]] (miRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], and hence cell [[metabolism]], grind to a halt and the cell dies. < ref name= "  Karlson-Stiber " > {{cite journal |author=Karlson-Stiber C, Persson H |title=Cytotoxic fungi - an overview |journal=Toxicon |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=339–49 |year=2003 |pmid=14505933|doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00238-1}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[liver]] is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], though other organs, especially the [[kidney]]s, are susceptible. < ref name=ben/ > < sup > p217 < /sup >  The [[RNA polymerase]] of ''Amanita phalloides'' is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself. < ref name= " Horgen " > {{cite journal |title=The insensitivity of mushroom nuclear RNA polymerase activity to inhibition by amatoxins |journal=Archives of Microbiology |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=317–9 |year=1978 |pmid=567964 |doi=10.1007/BF00429124|s2cid= 37127957|last1= Horgen|first1= Paul A.|last2= Vaisius|first2= Allan C.|last3= Ammirati|first3= Joseph F.}} < /ref >
