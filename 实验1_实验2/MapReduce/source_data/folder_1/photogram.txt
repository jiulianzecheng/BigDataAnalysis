 A '''photogram''' is a [[photograph]] that is made without a [[camera]]. Something is placed on top of some photographic paper (or a similar material) and then shining light on it. At the end of this, you get a [[shadow]] picture. It usually has different tones. This depends on how [[wikt:transparent|transparent]] the object is.
