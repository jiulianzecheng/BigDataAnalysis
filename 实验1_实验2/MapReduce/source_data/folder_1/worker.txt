 A '''worker''' is a [[person]] who works. This usually means a person who does [[manual labour]], like manufacturing goods. In [[economics]] there are three factors of production. These are ''[[labour (economics)|labour]]'' (the work done by workers), [[land]] (usually people need some space to produce something), and [[capital (economics)|capital]] (it will cost resources, or money, to produce something). 
 
 People who work, usually get paid for the work they do. This is either called [[pay|wage]]s (if it is bound to a time period, like an hour), or a [[salary]] (if it is independent of the time taken).  
 
 [[May Day]] is an international holiday for workers' [[human rights|rights]].
