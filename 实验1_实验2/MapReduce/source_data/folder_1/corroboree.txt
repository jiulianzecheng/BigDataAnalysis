 A '''corroboree''' is a ceremonial meeting of [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal Australians]]. The word was made by the European settlers of [[Australia]].  It was an imitation of the Eora word ''caribberie''. At a corroboree, Aborigines interact with the [[Dreamtime]] through dance, music and costume. Many ceremonies act out events from the Dreamtime. Many of the ceremonies are sacred.  People from outside a community cannot participate or watch. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.seqhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=99%3Apart1chpt3 & catid=42%3Atom-petrie & Itemid=67 & limitstart=2|title=Tom Petrie's Reminiscences of Early Queensland |author=Petrie, C.C. |access-date=2009-11-27}} < /ref >
