 '''Suomenlinna''', known until 1918 as '''Viapori''', known in Swedish as '''Sveaborg''', is a [[fortress]] in [[Finland]]. It is located on six [[island]]s in the [[sea]] near [[Helsinki]].  
 
 [[Construction]] of the fortress started in 1748 when Finland was still part of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]. Sweden wanted to defend the sea areas against [[Russia]]. They also needed a place to fix their [[Navy|military ships]]. In 1808 [[Russia]] ruled Finland. < ref name=SuomSvea > {{cite web |url=http://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/fortress/ |title=Fortress and history |publisher=Suomenlinna Sveaborg |access-date=28 February 2016}} < /ref >  They made the fortress stronger to defend Helsinki, which was now the capital of Finland. < ref name= " UN " > {{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/583 |title=Fortress of Suomenlinna |publisher=Unesco World Heritage Center |access-date=28 February 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1917 Finland became [[independent]]. In 1918 Viapori was taken over by the new Finnish government and was renamed Suomenlinna ( meaning  " Castle of Finland " ). < ref name=SuomSvea/ >  Some of the islands were used as a navy [[school]]. There was also a [[prison]], and prisoners worked to repair the old fortress. < ref name= " UN " / >
