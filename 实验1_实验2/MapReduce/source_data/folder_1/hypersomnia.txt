 '''Hypersomnia''' is a medical condition which is characterized by unusual sleepiness. People with hypersomnia easily feel sleepy during the day, and fall asleep. The condition where people wake up often during the night, and have trouble sleeping through the night is called '''insomnia''' and is different. Hypersomnia is a [[sleep disorder]].  
 
 Hypersomnia affects about five percent of the population, or about one of twenty people. Very often, people with [[Sleep apnea]] suffer from hypersomnia. Hypersomia can also occur with other conditions, such as [[Mood disorder|mood disorders]].  
 
 If the hypersomnia is caused by a problem with the brain or nervous system, it is called '''primary hypersomnia'''. [[Narcolepsy]] is an example of a primary hypersomnia. If the hypersomnia is the effect of another condition, it is usually called '''secondary hypersomnia'''. Examples of secondary hypersomnias include someone losing [[consciousness]] because of [[epilepsy]]. Sleep apnea, cited above, is one of the most common forms of secondary hypersomnia. Certain [[Drug|drugs]] can also cause (secondary) hypersomnias. 
 
 Primary hypersomnias are very rare. Secondary hypersomnias are quite common.
