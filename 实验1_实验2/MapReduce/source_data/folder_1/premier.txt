'''Premier''' is a title that some countries might use for their [[head of government]], sometimes used instead of [[Prime Minister]]. In some other countries, such as [[Canada]], the Premier could be title of a regional government of a [[province]] or other local division. 
 
 == British Colonies == 
 
 When a colony is first allowed to elect its own government the head of the government is called the ''Chief Minister''.  As the colony gets more able to rule itself it is given more powers and the title  of the Chief Minister is changed to ''Premier''.  When the colony becomes independent the Premier becomes a Prime Minister, and British government ministers lose any authority to rule the new country. 
 
 == Australia and Canada == 
 {{Main|Premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories|Premier (Canada)}} 
 The leader of the federal governments in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] is called the Prime Minister, but the leader of the governments in [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian Provinces]] is called the Premier. This is because the [[states]] and [[province]]s are not independent.
