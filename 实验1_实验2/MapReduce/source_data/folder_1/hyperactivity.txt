'''Hyperactivity''' (word derived from {{lang-el|ὑπέρ}}  " hyper "  and {{lang-la|agere, actum}}  " to act " ) can be described as a physical state.  
 
 People who have it can not control their overactive behavior and are abnormally active. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Schab DW, Trinh NH |title=Do artificial food colors promote hyperactivity in children with hyperactive syndromes?
