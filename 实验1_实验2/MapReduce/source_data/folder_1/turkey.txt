 '''Turkey'''{{efn|{{lang-tr|Türkiye}} {{IPA-tr|ˈtyɾcije|}}.}} officially the '''Republic of Türkiye''',{{efn|{{lang-tr|Türkiye Cumhuriyeti|links=no}} {{IPA-tr|ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti||Tur-Türkiye_Cumhuriyeti.ogg}}.}} is a [[transcontinental country]] located mainly on the [[Anatolia|Anatolian Peninsula]] in [[Western Asia]], with a small portion on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeast Europe]]. It shares borders with the [[Black Sea]] to the north; [[Georgia]] to the northeast; [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]] to the east; [[Iraq]] to the southeast; [[Syria]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south; the [[Aegean Sea]] to the west; and [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the northwest.  
 
 Turkey is a [[republic]]. There are 81 [[province]]s in Turkey. The money of Turkey is called the [[Turkish Lira]]. The capital city is [[Ankara]], a city in the central region, called [[Anatolia]]. The cultural and economic centre is in the European side of [[Istanbul]]. In the past Istanbul was called [[Constantinople]]. The republic was founded in 1923, after [[World War I]] and a war of independence (''Kurtuluş Savaşı''). Before that, Turkey was the core of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 
 
 Many civilisations were in the area that is now Turkey, like the [[Hittites]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Many important events in the history of [[Christianity]] happened in places that are now in Turkey. Because it lies in both Europe and Asia, some people see Turkey as the  " door "  between them.  
 
 Modern Turkey's varied [[climate]] lets many kinds of [[food]] [[crop]]s grow, and [[livestock]] and [[forestry]] are important [[industries]]. Turkey makes enough food to feed itself. Turkish manufactures include [[aeroplane]]s, [[electronics]], [[car]]s, [[clothes|clothing]] and [[textile]]s for home and for other countries. 
 
 Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beaches on its [[Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] coasts, and many important historical places. 
 
 == History == 
 === Ancient Anatolia === 
 The first major empire in the area was the [[Hittites]] (from the 18th century to the 13th century [[BCE]]). The Hittites, who spoke one of the [[Indo-European languages]], developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the [[Sea People]] in the 11th century BCE and the successor states were [[Lydia]], Caria and Lycia. 
 
 From 1950 BCE, [[Armenians]] and [[Assyrian]]s inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BCE). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until their empire was conquered by [[Babylonia]] in 612 BCE. Then [[Anatolia]] became home for various kingdoms including the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic kingdoms]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]] (Eastern Roman Empire), [[Seljuk Empire]], and [[Mongol Empire]]. 
 
 === The Ottoman Empire === 
 {{Main article|Ottoman Empire}} 
 During the 14th century, after the fall of the [[Mongol Empire]], [[Osman I|Gazi Osman]] built a new empire named after himself: the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the [[Balkans]], ([[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bulgaria]]) in [[Europe]]. The Empire was ruled by [[Sharia|Islamic law]], but other religions had certain [[minority rights]]. 
 
 In [[World War I]] the Ottoman Empire was one of the [[Central Powers]]. During the war, 500,000 [[Armenians]] in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called [[Armenian genocide]]. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the [[Ottoman Empire]] was destroyed, but after that [[Atatürk]] led the newly formed Turkish army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the [[Greeks]] and ousted the imperial Ottoman family from [[Anatolia]]. 
 
 === Republic of Turkey === 
 [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] was the first [[President of Turkey]]. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatürk felt that he weakened [[Islam]] in the country. Later political disputes led to [[Coup d'état]] in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts. 
 
 In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and later established the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], [[Rauf Denktaş]] became the first Turkish Cypriot president. 
 
 On 15 July 2016, a [[coup d'état]] was [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|attempted]]. 
 
 In 2022, the government of Turkey started to use the Turkish spelling of Türkiye in both Turkish and English. However, Turkey remains the more common name.

 {{main|Turkish people}} 
 [[File:Feminist protest from Turkey.jpg|thumb|Turkish women in [[Istanbul]]]] 
 About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are [[ethnic]] [[Turkish people|Turks]]. About 15% are ethnic [[Kurd]]s. Many [[refugee]]s from [[Syria]] (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the [[Syrian civil war]]. Many [[Romani people in Turkey]] live in [[Istanbul]] and [[Edirne]] (European part of Turkey). < ref > {{cite web | url=https://istanbultarihi.ist/472-the-gypsies-of-istanbul | title=THE GYPSIES OF ISTANBUL  & #124; History of Istanbul }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/minorities/turkish-romani-community-expects-concrete-steps-on-its-problems | title=Turkish Romani community expects 'concrete steps' on its problems | website=[[Daily Sabah]] | date=8 April 2022 }} < /ref > 
 
 The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. Much of the population in Turkey is made up of young adults and adults. 
 
 According to religiosity poll conducted in Turkey in 2019 by OPTİMAR, 89.5% of the population identifies as Muslim, 4.5% believed in God but did not belong to an organized religion, 2.7% were agnostic, 1.7% were atheist, 0.5% were belonged to the other religions, and 1.1% did not answer. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Özkök|first=Ertuğrul|title=Türkiye artık yüzde 99'u müslüman olan ülke değil|url=https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/ertugrul-ozkok/turkiye-artik-yuzde-99u-musluman-olan-ulke-degil-41220410|access-date=2020-08-13|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|language=tr}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://t24.com.tr/haber/optimar-dan-din-inanc-anketi-yuzde-89-allah-in-varligina-ve-birligine-inaniyor,821459 |title=Optimar'dan din-inanç anketi: Yüzde 89 Allah'ın varlığına ve birliğine inanıyor |publisher=T24.com.tr |access-date=2020-04-04}} < /ref >  Another poll conducted by Gezici Araştırma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and found that 28.5% of the [[Generation Z]] in Turkey identify as irreligious. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.sozcu.com.tr/2020/gundem/gezici-arastirma-merkezi-baskani-murat-gezici-sozcuye-acikladi-turkiyenin-kaderi-z-kusaginin-elinde-5867771/|title=Gezici Araştırma Merkezi Başkanı Murat Gezici SÖZCÜ'ye açıkladı: Türkiye'nin kaderi Z kuşağının elinde|website=www.sozcu.com.tr}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.gercekgundem.com/siyaset/188215/gezici-arastirma-merkezi-baskani-murat-gezici-turkiyenin-kaderi-z-kusaginin-elinde|title=Gezici Araştırma Merkezi Başkanı Murat Gezici: Türkiye'nin kaderi Z kuşağının elinde|website=www.gercekgundem.com|date=11 June 2020 }} < /ref > 
 
 Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as mantı (Turkish [[ravioli]]), [[doner kebab|döner]], [[kebab|kebap]], [[Turkish delight]] (lokum), [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], börek, köfte, and other foods. 
 
 According to a study, Anatolia is [[genetics|genetically]] more closely related to the [[Balkans|Balkan]] populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of [[Anatolia]] (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from [[Central Asia]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18161848|title = Alu insertion polymorphisms and an assessment of the genetic contribution of Central Asia to Anatolia with respect to the Balkans.|date = May 2008|journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology|publisher = Berkman CC1, Dinc H, Sekeryapan C, Togan I|pmid = 18161848|last1 = Berkman|first1 = C.

 === Majority and minorities === 
 {{Main|Minorities in Turkey}} 
 Most people in Turkey are Turks. The largest minority is [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]. Kurds live mostly in Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are the [[Romani people in Turkey]], mostly live in [[Istanbul]] < ref > {{cite web | url=https://istanbultarihi.ist/472-the-gypsies-of-Istanbul | title=THE GYPSIES OF ISTANBUL  & #124; History of Istanbul }} < /ref >  and [[East Thrace]], the European side of Turkey. 
 
 == Economy == 
 [[File:View of Levent financial district from Istanbul Sapphire.jpg|thumb|View of Levent financial district from Istanbul Sapphire]] 
 Turkey is in the [[OECD]] and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey. 
 
 In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey.{{Cn|date=August 2022}} 
 
 Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's [[international trade]] is mostly with the [[EU]], the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey. 
 
 Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion [[United States dollar]]s. 
 
 Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no [[petroleum]] and not much natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish [[Northern Cyprus]]. 
 
 Rich cities in Turkey include [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], [[İzmir]], [[Edirne]], [[Konya]], [[Mersin]] (also known as İçel), and [[Antalya]]. 
 
 == Culture == 
 === Language === 
 {{main|Turkish language}} 
 Most people in Turkey speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. It is written in [[Latin script]] and it belongs to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] group, which also includes many other languages spoken across [[Asia]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]. The Turkish language came from Central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in [[Central Asia]]. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents. 
 
 In Turkey there are also [[Minorities in Turkey|minorities]] who speak languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Romani language|Romani]] and many others. 
 
 Many of the young adults can also speak English, which is taught throughout Primary, Middle and High school. 
 
 === Lifestyle === 
 [[File:Hayata Artı Gençleri.jpg|thumb|Turkish youth at a vineyard]] 
 Turkish culture is a diverse culture, with some European influence. 
 
 Different parts of Turkey have similar but not exactly the same lifestyles. Central Turkey and Northern Turkey are somewhat more conservative and religious. Western Turkey and Southern Turkey, especially coastal cities are more liberal and secular. Eastern Turkey and Southeastern Turkey are made up of mostly [[Kurds]]–most of them are conservative and religious. Cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in major cities of Turkey are overwhelmingly liberal and secular. Cities like [[Hatay]] and Mardin, where different religions coexist, and [[Eskişehir]], which is the prominent college town of the country, also have cosmopolitan characteristics. 
 
 [[Collectivism]] is dominant in society rather than [[individualism]]. This is seen in everything from a civilian's worldview to the socio-political and socio-economic order of the country. People care a lot about what others think of them or their related ones. Sociologist Şerif Mardin, who argues that there is neighborhood watch in Turkish society, states that  " There is no tolerance for deviations from norms in the Turkish tradition, a watching oppression is applied against individuals in this situation and this is not new.

 === Traditions === 
 The [[circumcision]] of boys in Turkey is very common, with over 98% of men being circumcised. This is due to religious and cultural traditions and the circumcisions are celebrated with ceremonies known as [[Sünnet]] Düğünü or at a Mevlüd ceremony. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Şahin |first1=F. |last2=Beyazova |first2=U. |last3=Aktürk |first3=A. |title=Attitudes and practices regarding circumcision in Turkey |journal=Child: Care, Health and Development |date=July 2003 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=275–280 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2214.2003.00342.x |pmid=12823332 |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823332/ |access-date=9 March 2022 |issn=0305-1862}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |title=Neonatal and child male circumcision: a global review |url=https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/malecircumcision/neonatal_child_MC_UNAIDS.pdf |publisher=UNAIDS |access-date=9 March 2022}} < /ref >
