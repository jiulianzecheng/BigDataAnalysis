 ==Rules== 
 To play the game, one team uses the  " danda "  to hit one of the tapered ends of the  " gilli "  with force. This causes the  " gilli "  to flip through the air. While the  " gilli "  is airborne, the opposing team's hitter attempts to smack it like one would as if playing cricket. The one who hits the  " gilli "  the farthest will wins. It is played with two teams. One side pitches the  " gilli "  using the big  " danda "  (not the bare hands), to the other team's hitter. The hitter, using his  " danda "  then hits the  " gilli " . In the course of the play, if the  " gilli "  is caught, then those players who pitched with the big  " danda "  to the hitter, are out of the game.If the gilli falls on the ground the fielder closest to the gilli gets an opportunity to make the hitter out.He has to throw the gilli towards the danda if the danda is been hit by the gilli it means the striker is out if not then the fielder gains 1 point.When the striker gains 1 point he will get 3 tries to hit the danda if the gilli still doesn't hit the danda the striker is out.If he is successful,the 1 point which he gained will continue.At the end who has the maximum points wins the game.It was most popularly played around 1970 to 1980 throughout India and Pakistan and is played to this day.
