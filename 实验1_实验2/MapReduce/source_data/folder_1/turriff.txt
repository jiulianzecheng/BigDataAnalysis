 '''Turriff''' is a town and parish in [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]]. It is approximately 166 feet above [[sea level]]. It is known locally as '''Turra''' in the [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric dialect]] of [[Scots language|Scots]]. The name appears to be [[Scottish Gaelic]] in origin, from  " ''[[tor]]r'' "  meaning a mound or round hill, or  " ''tur'' "  meaning a tower. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Turriffmercatcross.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Turriff [[mercat cross]]]] 
 
 The [[Knights Templar]] appear to have had a base in the area, and a nearby site is still known as  " Temple Brae " . 
 
 Early in [[1639]], the [[Marquess of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly]] assembled his forces here, and thereafter went to [[Kintore, Scotland|Kintore]] in lower Aberdeenshire, eventually marching from there to [[Aberdeen]] itself. The Marquis — being informed shortly after his arrival in Aberdeen that a meeting of [[Covenanters]] was to be held in Turriff on the fourteenth of February — resolved to disperse them, by occupying the town with 2000 men. The incident was known as the  " First raid of Turray " .
