 A '''stalactite''' is a form that can be found on the ceiling of a cave. When a drop of water flows down the stalactite, the water evaporates and leaves a mineral deposit of calcite. This slowly increases the length and thickness of the stalactite. 
 
 The corresponding formation on the floor underneath a stalactite is known as a [[stalagmite]]. Given enough time, these formations can meet. The results are known as [[column]]s.
