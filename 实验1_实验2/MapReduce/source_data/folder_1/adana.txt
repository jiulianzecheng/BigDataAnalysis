 Adana is also named among the 25 ''European Regions of the Future'' for 2006/2007 by [[Foreign Direct Investment]] Magazine. Chosen alongside [[Kocaeli]] for Turkey, Adana scored the most points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli's points for infrastructure development, while Adana and Kocaeli tied on points for the categories of human resources and quality of life.  < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | title = European Regions of the Future | author =  | publisher = Foreign Direct Investment Magazine | access-date = 2007-06-29 | archive-date = 2007-03-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042032/http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1544/EUROPEAN_CITIES___REGIONS_OF_THE_FUTURE_2006_07.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
