 A '''coprolite''' is [[fossilized]] [[faeces]]. Coprolites are [[trace fossil]]s, not body fossils. They give evidence of the animal's behaviour (in this case, its diet). < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=coprolites|title=coprolite|publisher=Dictionary.com}} < /ref > 
 
 The name is taken from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words κόπρος (''kopros'', meaning  " dung " ) and λίθος (''lithos'', meaning  " stone " ). They were first described by [[William Buckland]] in 1829.
