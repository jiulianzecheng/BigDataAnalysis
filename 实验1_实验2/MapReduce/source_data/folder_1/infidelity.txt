 People who form a couple, or who are [[married]], very often have an agreement that they will only have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with each other, and with no one else. If one of the two has sex with someone else, this is called '''infidelity'''. 
 
 Infidelity is common: About half of the men, and a quarter of women reported having an extra-marital affair, according to the [[Kinsey Reports]], done in the 1950s. < ref name= " Greeley91 " > {{cite journal|last1=Greeley|first1=A|year=1994|title=Marital infidelity|url=|journal=Society|volume=31|issue=4|pages=9â€“13|doi=10.1007/bf02693241|s2cid=189887196}} < /ref > 
 
 In many countries, where [[religion]] is still present in everyday life (mostly in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]), being untrue to the one you love is a [[crime|criminal offense]]. In most [[Europe]]an countries and the [[Americas]], it is no longer a crime punishable by [[law]]. 
 
 Infidelity is one the reasons and causes for [[divorce]].
