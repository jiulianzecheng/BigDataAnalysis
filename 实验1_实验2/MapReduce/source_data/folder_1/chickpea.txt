 The '''chickpea''' ''(Cicer arietinum)''  is a [[yellow]] [[edible]] [[legume]] (bean). It can be used for [[cooking]]. The peas can be bought canned or dried. It was one of the earliest fruits to be grown. The first chickpea was grown in the [[Middle East]] about 7,500 years ago. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.forward.com/articles/2119/ | title=Chickpeas â€” On Language | author=Philologos | date=October 21, 2005 | publisher=[[Jewish Daily Forward]] | access-date=2009-03-28 }} < /ref >   
 
 The most popular place for chickpeas to grow is in [[Pakistan]]. In 2008, nearly 6 million [[Ton|tonnes]] of chickpeas were produced there. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org}} < /ref >  Because the growth is so popular there, it is also known as the '''Indian pea'''.  
 
 Chickpeas contain a great deal of [[protein]], [[zinc]] and [[folic acid]]. They can be an important part of a vegetarian or vegan diet, since they come from a plant.  
 
 The dried bean is boiled and served whole or mashed, such as in the popular dish [[hummus]]. Chickpeas are ground into a flour, called  " besan "  or  " gram "  flour, used in South Asian cooking.
