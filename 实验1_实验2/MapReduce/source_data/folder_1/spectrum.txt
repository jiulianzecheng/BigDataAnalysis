 A '''spectrum''', plural: '''spectra''', < ref > {{Cite journal|title=spectrum|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spectrum|journal=The Free Dictionary}} < /ref >  is a band of several colours: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krMgAwAAQBAJ & dq=spectrum+plural+is+spectra & pg=PA103|title=Understanding the Universe: An Inquiry Approach to Astronomy and the Nature of Scientific Research|last=Greenstein|first=George|date=2013-02-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139618878|language=en}} < /ref >  A spectrum can be seen if the Sun's light is passed through a prism and allowed to gather on a white screen. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_spectrum|title=What is a spectrum|website=Answers.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-12}} < /ref >  This '''visible spectrum''' is part of the larger [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [[Spectroscopy]] is the study of spectra. 
 
 A natural example of a spectrum is a rainbow. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJOCAAAQBAJ & dq=A+natural+example+of+a+spectrum+is+a+rainbow & pg=PT572|title=Studies in Astrology|last=Bacher|first=Elman|date=2017-07-04|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=9781300109945|language=en}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The word ''spectrum'' was first used by scientists studying [[optics]]. They used the word to describe the [[rainbow]] of colors in visible light when separated using a [[Prism (optics)|prism]].  The spectrum seen when light passes through a prism is an example of the [[dispersion]] of light.  The material from which the prism is made has a different  [[refractive index]] ''n'' than air.  Usually, ''n'' < sub > prism < /sub >  is greater than ''n'' < sub > air < /sub > , and ''n'' < sub > air < /sub >  is taken to be approximately one. This implies that light travels a little slower in the material of the prism than in the space surrounding it.  The angle of [[refraction]] can be determined from the angle of incidence and the refractive indexes using [[Snell's law]].   
 
 The reason why the white light separates into in its component colors instead of remaining white is because the shorter [[wavelength]]s are refracted, or bent, more than the longer wavelengths.  Thus, red, having the longest visible wavelength, will appear closest to the line [[perpendicular]] to the surface of the material (the normal), that is, it will be bent the least.  Violet light, with the smallest wavelength  in the visible spectrum, will be bent the most.  The rainbow produced will always be in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
