An '''antagonist''' is the [[Fictional character|character]] in a story who stands in opposition towards the [[protagonist]]. As an example, in the Disney movie ''[[The Lion King]]'', the main antagonist is [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]]. 
 
 While the most common practice is for a [[hero]] to be the protagonist and the [[villain]] to be the antagonist this is not always the case. As an example in the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series [[Death Note]] protagonist Light Yagami was the villain as it was his goal to rid the world of criminals in order to create his own ideal  " [[utopia]] "  and rule it like a [[Deity|god]] while antagonist L was the [[hero]] as it was his goal to end Light's psychotic killing spree. Another example is [[Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]] where the titular protagonist and the antagonist Judge Turpin were both villains.  
 
 A story may also have secondary antagonist, either a partner/accomplice of the main antagonist or an entirely separate threat altogether (though a lesser one). Just like the main antagonist they aren't always villains but they are obstacles towards the goal(s) of the protagonist(s). 
 
 It is possible for a protagonist to become an antagonist. A well-known example of this is in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie series, when [[Anakin Skywalker]] turns from a Jedi to a Sith, to become [[Darth Vader]].
