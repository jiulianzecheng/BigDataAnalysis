 The '''aurochs''', < ref > The word is both singular and plural. < /ref >  or '''urus''', (''Bos primigenius'') was a large [[species]] of [[cattle]]. The aurochs used to be common in Europe. It is [[extinct]] now. < ref > The animal's first scientific name, ''Bos primigenius'', was meant as a [[Latin]] translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Auerochse'' or ''Urochs'', which was they thought meant  " primeval ox "  or  " proto-ox " . Today, [[Integrated Taxonomic Information System|ITIS]] say this name is wrong. They classify aurochs under ''Bos taurus'', the same species as domestic cattle. In 2003, the ''International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature''  " conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms "  (http://www.iczn.org/BZNSep2006general_articles.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312012709/http://www.iczn.org/BZNSep2006general_articles.html |date=2010-03-12 }}) confirming ''Bos primigenius'' for the Aurochs. Taxonomists who consider  domesticated [[cattle]] a subspecies of the [[Wildlife|wild]] Aurochs should use ''B. primigenius taurus''; the name ''B. taurus'' remains available for domestic cattle where it is considered to be a separate species. < /ref >  It was a wild animal, not a [[Domestication#Domesticated animals|domesticated]] animal. The extinct aurochs/urus is a not the same [[species]] as the ''wisent'' (the European [[bison]]). < ref > The word ''Aurochs'' ({{IPA-en|ˈaʊrɒks}} or {{IPA|/ˈɔrɒks/}}) comes to English from German. The use in English of the plural form ''aurochsen'' is the same as the German plural and just like English ''ox'' (sg), ''oxen'' (pl). 
 The word ''urus'' ({{IPA|/ˈjʊərəs/}}) comes to English from Latin, but came to Latin from Germanic origins. AHD4, headword ''urus''. The words ''aurochs'', ''urus'', and ''[[wisent]]'' & nbsp; have all been used [[synonym]]ously in English. AHD4, headwords ''aurochs'', ''urus'', ''wisent''. MWU, headwords ''aurochs'', ''urus'', ''wisent''. < /ref > 
 
 According to the Paleontologisk Museum, University of [[Oslo]], aurochs developed in [[India]] some two million years ago, came into the [[Middle East]] and farther into [[Asia]], and reached [[Europe]] about 250,000 years ago. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/a31922.htm |title=Bos primigenius |access-date=2008-04-14 |archive-date=2006-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926203814/http://www.toyen.uio.no/palmus/galleri/montre/english/a31922.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  People once thought that they were a different species from modern European [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''). Today, people think that aurochs and modern cattle are the same species. 
 
 Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild [[ancestor]]s: the height of a large domesticated cow is about 1.5 & nbsp;meters (5 & nbsp;feet, 15 [[hand (unit)|hands]]), < ref > [http://www.mycattle.com/health/dsp_health_article.cfm?storyid=9204 Height] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015082445/http://mycattle.com/health/dsp_health_article.cfm?storyid=9204 |date=2007-10-15 }} of Holstein cows < /ref >  while aurochs were about 1.75 & nbsp;meters (5.75 & nbsp;feet, 17 hands). 
 
 Aurochs also had several features not often seen in modern cattle, such as [[lyre]]-shaped horns set at a forward angle, a pale stripe down the [[spine]], and different color according to the gender. Males were black with a pale stripe down the spine, while females and calves were reddish (these colours are still found in a few domesticated [[cattle]] breeds, such as Jersey cattle). Aurochs were also known to have very [[wikt:aggressive|aggressive]] behaviour, and killing one was seen as an act of courage in ancient cultures. 
 
 == Subspecies == 
 At one time there were three aurochs subspecies, namely ''Bos primigenius namadicus'' (Falconer, 1859) that occurred in India, the ''Bos primigenius mauretanicus'' (Thomas, 1881) from North Africa and the ''Bos primigenius primigenius'' (Bojanus, 1827) from Europe and the Middle East. Only the European subspecies survived until recent times.
