 '''Globish''' is an attempt at creating a subset of the English language for use as the international language for commerce. It has 1500 words, simple grammar rules, no humor, and no Anglo-cultural references. It was inspired by [[Charles Kay Ogden]]'s [[BE 850]]. It has a word base based on real observation of non-natives' conversations in English. 
 
 The selection of 1500 words is slightly different from the VOA [[Special English]] and the SPOTLIGHT Specialized English word choices, but still quite similar. There is however a different list from a Japanese website on Globish. And the Globish Text Scanner allows some 500 more words.
