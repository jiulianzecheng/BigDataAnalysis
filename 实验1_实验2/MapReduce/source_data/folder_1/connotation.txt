{{enWiktionary|connotation}} 
 '''Connotation''' is a meaning that is suggested or implied, as opposed to a [[denotation]], or literal [[definition]].  
 
 ==Usage== 
 Today the word has different meanings, but it is always used for the contrast of a word or phrase with its primary, [[literal]] meaning (known as a denotation). That can be an implied value judgement or feelings. 
 
 *A stubborn person may be described as being either ''strong-willed'' or ''pig-headed''. Although these have the same literal meaning (i.e. ''stubborn''), ''strong-willed'' connotes admiration for the level of someone's will, while ''pig-headed'' '''connotes''' frustration in dealing with someone. Likewise, ''used car'' and ''previously owned car'' have the same literal meaning, but many dealerships prefer the latter, since it is thought to have fewer ''negative'' ''connotations''. 
 *It is often useful to avoid words with strong connotations (especially [[pejorative|negative]] ones) when striving to achieve a neutral point of view. A desire for more positive connotations, or fewer negative ones, is one of the main reasons for using [[euphemism]]s.
