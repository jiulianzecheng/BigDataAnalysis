In Christian belief,  " kenosis "  means that Jesus emptied himself by giving up his own desires and obeying God's will completely. This is a good example for other Christians to follow. It also means that [[Jesus]], in order to live as a human being, chose to limit the use of his divine powers. Some people disagree with this idea and think it takes away from Jesus' divine power. 
 
 === The Kenosis Hymn === 
 Philippians 2 talks about the human side of Jesus. Some people believed he was only human and others believed he was only divine, but the official belief is that he was both. Kenotic Christology says that even though Jesus was divine, he chose to live like a regular human and face all the same problems. He could still do amazing things, but he didn't always use his divine powers to solve his problems. He had to eat, sleep, and face human struggles like temptation and frustration. He said that no one knows when the world will end. < blockquote > 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. 9 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
