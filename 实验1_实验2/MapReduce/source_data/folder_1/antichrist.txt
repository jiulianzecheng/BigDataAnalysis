 In [[Christian]] beliefs, the '''Antichrist''' or '''Anti-christ''' (''[[:wikt:anti|anti]]'' means opposite; ''[[christ]]'' means [[messiah]]) is used to speak about a [[person]] or [[image]] that implies [[evil]], and more than one person. It is also said that antichrist is the [[devil]] himself. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.prca.org/pamphlets/pamphlet_3.html| title= " The Antichrist|author=Gritters, Barry|publisher=The Protestant Reformed Churches in America|access-date=2007-06-24}} < /ref > 
 
 The Biblical [[Book of Revelation]] refers to two  " Beasts " . One of them is often identified as the Antichrist, the counter-[[messiah]] of the devil.
