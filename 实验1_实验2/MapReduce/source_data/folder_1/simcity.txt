'''''SimCity''''' is a [[Video game|computer game]] where the player has to build a [[city]]. They can do whatever they want to their city. It can be built from the ground up or it can be destroyed by a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane]] or a [[UFO]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 ''Sim City'' was made by [[game]] maker [[Will Wright]] and first released by the company [[Maxis]]. They are now owned by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was first officially released in [[1989]]. 
 
 It was very popular because the game had no end. A player could not win or lose. This was the start of all [[simulation games]]. 
 
 ==Gameplay== 
 At the start, the player has to build [[power station|power plant]]s. Power plants make power so the city can have [[electricity]]. By building [[Power line|power lines]], power is connected to the different areas of the city. [[Water]] needs to be pumped in from a [[river]] using [[water pipes|pipes]] to connect them to the city. 
 
 Smaller areas are marked out. These are made either residential, [[commerce|commercial]], or [[factory|industrial]] zones. Zones are the only places where buildings can develop. Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow. 
 
 [[Road]]s, [[school]]s and [[hospital]]s must all be built for the city to get better. [[Park]]s and [[Library|libraries]] make more people want to move to the city. [[Railway]]s and [[Highway|highways]] provide ways to connect to other [[neighborhood]]s. 
 
 ==Sequels==
