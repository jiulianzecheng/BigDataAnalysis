 '''Apomixis''' is reproduction where only one parent passes genes to the offspring. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p31. {{ISBN|0-19-530761-5}} < /ref >  Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent ([[clones]]). 
 
 The method is most seen in plants, especially [[flowering plants]]. < ref > Gustafsson A. 1945. ''Apomixis in the higher plants''.

 Apomixis includes some methods which are more common in animals, such as [[parthenogenesis]]. 
 
 In [[botany]], apomixis was defined by Hans Winkler as the replacement of the normal sexual reproduction by [[asexual reproduction]], without fertilization. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/46760#page/313/mode/1up|author=Winkler, H.|year=1908|title=Über Parthenogenesis und Apogamie im Pflanzenreich|volume=2|issue=3|journal=Progressus Rei Botanicae|pages=293–454}} < /ref > < ref > Ross A.

 [[Horticulture]] methods, such as propagation from cuttings or [[leaves]], is not apomixis. ''Natural replacement of the seed by an asexual method'' is apomixis.
