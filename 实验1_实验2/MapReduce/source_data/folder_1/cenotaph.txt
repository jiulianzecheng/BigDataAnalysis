A '''Cenotaph''' is an empty [[tomb]] or a [[monument]] built in honor of a person or group of people whose [[Carcass|remains]] are elsewhere. It can also be the first tomb for a person who has since been reburied elsewhere. Although most cenotaphs honor individuals, many noted cenotaphs honor groups of individuals, such as the lost [[soldier]]s of a country or of an empire.
