 '''Cocoa''' is the [[seed]] of the [[cacao tree]]. The seed contains a lot of [[fat]] and is used to produce [[cocoa butter]]. Cocoa butter is then used to produce [[chocolate]]. The cocoa which is used to make chocolate is a fine powder. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Cacao-pod-k4636-14.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cocoa beans in a cacao pod]] 
 Chocolate and cocoa are made from the [[bean]]s of the cacao tree. The tree might have first come from the foothills of the [[Andes]] Mountains near the [[Amazon River]] and the [[Orinoco]] River in [[South America]]. The tree was brought to [[Central America]] by the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]]s, and was grown in [[Mexico]] by the [[Toltec]]s and later by the [[Aztec]]s. 
 
 Cocoa was an important [[Product (business)|product]] in [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]. People who told the story of the [[invasion|conquest]] of [[Mexico]] by [[Hernán Cortés]] said that when [[Moctezuma II]], emperor of the [[Aztec]]s, ate dinner he took no other [[drink]] than [[chocolate]], served in a [[gold]]en [[goblet]] and eaten with a golden [[spoon]]. Flavored with [[vanilla]] and [[spices]], his chocolate was whipped into a [[froth]] that dissolved in the mouth. No less than 50 pitchers of the drink were prepared for the emperor each day, and 2000 more for nobles of his court. 
 
 Chocolate was brought to [[Europe]] by the [[Spaniard]]s and became a popular drink by [[1700]]. They also brought the cacao tree to the [[West Indies]] and the [[Philippines]]. It was used in [[alchemy|alchemical]] processes, where it was known as Black Bean. 
 
 The cacao plant was first given its name by [[Sweden|Swedish]] natural [[scientist]] [[Carl von Linné]] (1707-1778), who called it  " theobroma cacao "  or  " food of the gods " . 
 
 ==Harvesting== 
 
 A [[pod]] has a rough [[leather]]y [[rind]] about 3 & nbsp;cm (1¼ inch) thick. It is filled with slimy pinkish [[pulp (fruit)|pulp]], sweet but inedible, enclosing from 30 to 50 large [[almond]]-like [[seed]]s or  " beans "  that are fairly [[wikt:soft|soft]] and pinkish or purplish in color. As soon as they ripen, the pods are removed with a curved [[knife]] on a long [[pole (object)|pole]], opened with a [[machete]], and left to dry until taken to [[fermentation]]. 
 
 Then the beans are removed and piled in heaps, bins, or on [[grate]]s where, during several days of  " sweating " , the thick pulp ferments until it thins and trickles off. The quality of the beans, which originally have a strong bitter taste, depends upon this sweating. If it is overdone they may be ruined; if underdone they have a flavor like raw [[potato]]es and are susceptible to [[mildew]]. 
 
 Then the beans are spread out, constantly [[rake]]d over, and dried. On large [[plantation]]s this is done on huge trays, either outdoors by sunshine or in [[shed]]s by artificial heat. However, thousands of [[ton]]s from smaller producers are dried on small trays or on [[cowhide]]s. Finally, the beans are trodden and shuffled about (often using bare human feet) and sometimes, during this process red [[clay]] mixed with [[water]] is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the [[United States]], the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], and other countries. About 3,000,000 [[tonne]]s of cocoa are grown each year. The Netherlands is the leading cocoa processing country, followed by the U.S. 
 
 ==Use of cocoa== 
 Uses of cocoa are numerous. It may be used in cakes, creams, drinks, toppings and cookies. 
 
 Besides its use as a food, by use of the scientific process it has been determined that cocoa is beneficial for health. Cocoa has nearly twice the anti-cancer [[antioxidant]]s of red [[wine]], and up to three times those found in [[green tea]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.chocolate.org/health/antioxidants.html |title=Chocolate health research: antioxidants |access-date=2010-09-04 |archive-date=2010-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027085823/http://chocolate.org/health/antioxidants.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Problems with growth and sale== 
 * Many cocoa farmers get a low price for their products. This has led to cocoa and chocolate being available as [[fair trade]] items in some countries, but this fair trade remains a minority percentage of total trade. 
 * [[Slavery]] has commonly been used in its production: see [[Cocoa Protocol]] for an effort to end this. 
 * [[Pollination]] is exclusively by [[midge]]s, which may be affected by [[pesticide]]s
