 '''Romford''' is a town in Essex. It is in the [[London Borough of Havering]], [[England]]. It was first recorded as a town in [[1153]] in the ''Red Book of the Exchequer''. The name  " Romford "  means  " wide ford " . The stream that flows through it was only later called  " the Rom River "  after the town.  
 
 In [[medieval]] times, this town was granted the right to have the only [[market]] for 6 2/3 miles around. This rule was used in the 1990s to stop a nearby town, [[Ilford]], from opening a market nearby.{{fact|date=July 2010}}. Romford had a brewery which now is an entertainment venue.
