 '''KDE''' is a community that produces free software, including a [[desktop environment]] called KDE Plasma for [[operating system]]s based on [[Linux]] or [[UNIX]]. This replaces the console, which is simply a black screen with text on it. KDE Plasma is a popular piece of software for users of [[Linux]] and [[UNIX]]. 
 
 Plasma runs on top of the [[X Window System]], which runs on top of any UNIX-like operating systems like [[Linux]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] [[OS X]].  
 Since KDE SC 4.0, many KDE programs also runs on [[Microsoft Windows]].
