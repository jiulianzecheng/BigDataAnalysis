 '''Neomorphinae''' is a [[subfamily]] of the [[cuckoo]] family, [[Cuckoo|Cuculidae]]. The [[bird]]s in this group live in the [[Americas]] and are terrestrial, meaning they live on the ground. But the two [[genera]], ''[[Dromococcyx]]'' and [[Striped cuckoo|''Tapera'']], are more arboreal, meaning they live in [[tree]]s. Birds in this group are known as  " ''[[New World]] ground cuckoos'' " .

 All [[bird]]s in this group are long-legged and long-tailed. They come in different sizes. The [[species]] in the [[genus]] [[Roadrunner|''Geococcyx'']] are around {{convert|48|to|56|cm}} long. The smallest bird in this group, the [[striped cuckoo]], is {{convert|26|to|29|cm}} long. 
 
 == Feeding== 
 New World ground cuckoos are [[omnivore]]s, meaning they eat both meat and plants. They eat many types of [[insect]]s like [[grasshopper]]s, [[beetle]]s, and [[caterpillar]]s, [[arachnid]]s like [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s, [[snake]]s like [[rattlesnake]]s, [[lizard]]s, other [[bird]]s and bird [[egg (biology)|egg]]s, small [[mammal]]s like [[mice]], small, young [[rabbit]]s and [[bat]]s.
