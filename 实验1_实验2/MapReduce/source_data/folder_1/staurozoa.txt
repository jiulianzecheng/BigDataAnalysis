The '''Staurozoa''' are a [[Class (biology)|Class]] in the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. It includes the stalked [[jellyfish]]. It was an [[Order (biology)|order]] within the Class [[Scyphozoa]], but recent [[Genetics|genetic]] work has shown it to be a class of its own. This is a small class of about 50 species, mostly inshore and quite small. The recent discovery of some Staurozoa near deep sea [[hydrothermal vent]]s was a surprise, and makes it clear that there is much more to learn about them. 
 
 The Staurozoa are unique in not having an alternation of [[polyp]] and [[medusa (animal)|medusa]] life cycle phases. They have an attached ''medusa'' stage, with a life style looking rather like polypoid forms. < ref > Mills, C.E. and Y.M. Hirano 2007. Stauromedusae. In ''Encyclopedia of tidepools and rocky shores'', M.W. Denny  &  S.D. Gaines (eds). University of California Press, Berkeley. 539-541 < /ref >   
 
 Members of this class are commonly found in relatively cold waters, close to the shoreline. After the [[larva]]e crawl across the sea floor and find a suitable place, they attach themselves to rocks or [[algae]].
