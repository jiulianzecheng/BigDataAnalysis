 The '''Meganisoptera''' were the giant [[dragonflies]] from the [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]]. They lived in the [[Pennsylvanian]] (late [[Carboniferous]]) [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] to the late [[Permian period]]. The group used to be called '''Protodonata'''. 
 
 The largest of these dragonflies was ''Meganeuropsis'' from the early Permian. It had a [[wingspan]] of 28 inches (71 cm). Not all this group had giant size, but they were all larger than modern dragonflies. 
 
 The modern classification is as follows: 
 
 *[[superorder]] '''[[Odonaptera]]''' 
 **[[Order (biology)|Order]] [[Meganisoptera]] 
 **Order [[Odonata]]
