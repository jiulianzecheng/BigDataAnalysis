 '''Ironbark''' is a common name of a number of species within the [[genus]] ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' that have dark, deeply furrowed [[bark]]. < ref > Ian Brooker,  " Botany of the Eucalypts "  in J.J.W.

 Many eucalypts shed their bark very year, but on an Ironbark the dead bark stays on the trees, forming the furrows. It becomes rough after drying out and becomes full of [[kino (gum)|kino]], a dark red [[Sap (plant)|tree sap]] exuded by the tree. < ref > CSIRO ''Forest Products Newsletter'' 1946 < /ref >  The bark is resistant to fire and heat and protects the living tissue within the trunk and branches from fire. In cases of extreme fire, where leaves and shoots are removed, the bark protects the [[epicormic]] [[bud]]s which allow the tree to reshoot. < ref > J.B. Reid  &  B.M.
