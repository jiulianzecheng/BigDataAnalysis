 '''Adsorption''' is the sticking of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s to a [[surface]] (called  " adsorbent " ). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.brownfieldstsc.org/glossary.cfm?q=1 |title=Glossary |publisher=The Brownfields and Land Revitalization Technology Support Center |access-date=2009-12-21 |archive-date=2008-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094403/http://www.brownfieldstsc.org/glossary.cfm?q=1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The particles which get stuck on can be from a [[gas]], [[liquid]] or a [[solution|dissolved]] [[solid]]. An example would be the way water sticks to the surface of [[sand]] grains on a [[beach]], or to particles of soil. 
 
 The exact nature of the [[force]] which holds them on varies according to the nature of the surface and the adsorbed molecules. The force may be a weak [[physics|physical]] force, or weak [[chemical bond]]s, but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on. Supplying more [[heat]] usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate. Only  " free water "  (that is not trapped inside solid particles) can [[Evaporation|evaporate]].
