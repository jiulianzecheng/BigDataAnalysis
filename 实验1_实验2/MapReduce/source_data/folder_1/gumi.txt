 == Tourist attractions == 
 Gumi is famous because Geumo Mountain (Geumo San) is there.  Geumo San, designated as a provincial park in 1970, is 976 meters above sea level. It attracts many tourists because of its beautiful scenery; such as oddly formed rocks and strangely shaped stones, forests, and valleys. The mountain is best known for its own unique shape.  Seeing  the mountain from a distance, it resembles the profile of a giant lying on the ground. It has become one of the favorite sites among photographers because it looks most spectacular at sunset. There are a variety of post cards with pictures of its side face of a giant. 
 
 == People == 
 [[Park Chung-hee]] is one of the former presidents of South Korea and he was born in Gumi in 1917. Gumi became prosperous during his presidential term.  The Gyeongbu Expressway and Gyeongbu Line railway, which are the principal traffic routes of the country, were built to pass through the city. The routes could have been connected directly from [[Daejeon]] to [[Daegu]]. The rapid economical growth of Gumi resulted from the presidentâ€™s care for his hometown.
