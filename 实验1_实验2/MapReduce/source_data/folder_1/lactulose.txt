'''Lactulose''' is a synthetic [[disaccharide]] (a special kind of [[sugar]]). It can be obtained from [[Lactose]], at high [[Temperature|temperatures]]. When [[milk]] is treated using [[heat]], for example with [[pasteurization]], some Lactulose will be result as well. [[Friedrich Petuely]] (1922-94) discovered that Lactulose also has properties that are useful for medical treatments: It is beneficial to the [[gut flora]] of [[Infant|infants]]. In larger quantities, in adults, it acts as a [[laxative]]. In the [[gut]], Lactrulose favors the growth of [[bacteria]] that can process lactose.
