 The '''Vignemale''' ({{lang-es|Viñamala}}, {{lang-oc|Vinhamala}}, {{lang-an|Comachibosa}}) is the highest of the [[France|French]] [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] [[summit]]s, on the border with [[Spain]] (the highest in the whole of the [[Pyrenees]] is Pic [[Aneto]]). 
 
 The Vignemale is between the [[Spain|Spanish]] province of [[Province of Huesca|Huesca]] and the French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Hautes-Pyrénées]]. It is the highest [[mountain]] in the French Pyrenees, the [[Occitanie]] [[Regions of France|region]] and in the Hautes-Pyrénées department. < ref name=pbag / >   The mountain is in the ''Pyrénées National Park'' (France) and in the ''Reserva de la Biosfera Ordesa-Viñamala'' (Spain). 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The Vignemale is the name given to the mountain massif that is formed by several distinct [[summit]]s; the main summits are: 
 
 * ''Pique-Longue'' or ''Grand Vignemale'', {{Convert|3298|m|ft|abbr=on }}; 
 * ''Pointe Chausenque'', {{Convert|3204|m|ft|abbr=on }}; and 
 * ''Petit Vignemale'', {{Convert|3032|m|ft|abbr=on }}. 
 
 The ''Pique-Longue'' can bee seen easily from other mountains and even from the city of [[Lourdes]]. 
 
 The Vignemale is also where is the second largest of the Pyrenean [[glacier]]s (after the one one in Aneto): the ''Ossoue'' glacier with an area of around {{Convert|0.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on }}. The easiest route to climb the mountain, and the one most used, is across this glacier. 
 
 ==History== 
 On August 1792, some [[shepherd]]s climbed the ''Pique-Longue'' following orders from Louis-Philippe Reinhart Junker who was in charge of a team that was studying the French-Spanish border. But the names of those shepherds are not known. 
 
 The first known ascent of this [[peak]] was made 45 years later, on 8 October 1837, by Henri Cazaux, from Luz (now [[Luz-Saint-Sauveur]]), and his brother-in-law Bernard Guillembet. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://philrando.free.fr/premieres.html#Vignemale|title=Les premières ascensions des 3000 et de quelques autres sommets |publisher=Carnet de randonnées dans les Pyrénées |language=fr |access-date=18 November 2017 }} < /ref >
