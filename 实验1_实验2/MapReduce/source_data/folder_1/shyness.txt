 '''Shyness''' is the [[feeling]] of [[fear|apprehension]], not being comfortable, or [[awkward]]ness especially when a person is around other people. This usually happens when someone is doing something or being somewhere they are not used to. This can be seen as the opposite of [[confidence]]. 
 
 This fear of negative reactions such as being laughed at, humiliated, criticized or rejected can cause a shy person to retreat. Stronger forms of shyness can be known as [[anxiety]].
