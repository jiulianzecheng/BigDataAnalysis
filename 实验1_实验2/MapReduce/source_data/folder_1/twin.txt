'''Twins''' are two [[babies]] that are born at the same time. 
 
 ''Human twins'' are two people that shared a single pregnancy, and one is normally born quickly after the first. 
 
 ==Types of twins== 
 There are 2 types of twins. They are: 
 === Fraternal twins === 
 '''Fraternal twins''' are also known as  " non-identical twins "  or ''dizygotic twins''. They happen when two [[ovum|ova]] are released from the [[ovary]] at the same time, and each is [[fertilization|fertilized]] by a different [[sperm]]. This results in the birth of fraternal twins. They can be of different sexes. [[Genetically]], they are no more similar than any two [[siblings]]. 
 
 === Identical twins === 
 {{main|Identical twins}} 
 '''Identical twins''' or ''monozygotic twins'': A single ovum is fertilized to form one [[zygote]]. This zygote later splits, and each half of the zygote becomes a twin. The twins have the same [[gene]]s. 
 
 == Variations == 
 There are five variations of twinning that occur commonly. The frequency varies in different populations. < ref > Smits, Jeroen  &  Monden, Christiaan 2011.  Twinning across the Developing World. ''PLoS ONE'' '''6''' (9): e25239. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182188/] < /ref >  The three most common variations are all fraternal, meaning the two twins are not from the same egg:  
 :(1) male-female twins are the most common result, at about 41% of all twins born;  
 :(2) female fraternal twins (sometimes called sororal twins), about 20%;  
 :(3) male fraternal twins, about 19%.  
 The last two variations are identical twins, which means they come from one single egg that split later:  
 :(4) female identical twins (about 10%) and  
 :(5) (least common) male identical twins (about 10%). 
 
 ==Other animals== 
 Twinning is common in many other species, such as [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[ferret]]s. Twinning occurs in [[cattle]] about 1-4% of the time, and research is being done to improve the chances of twins being born. If an animal has twins it can be more profitable for the [[breed]]er, especially if there is a smaller chance of [[miscarriage]].
