Together with [[Dortmund]], Essen is the biggest city of the Ruhr area with its 5,000,000 inhabitants.

 == History of Essen == 
 
 Around 850, Saint Altfrid founded the ''Damenstift'', an abbey for women, ruled by a prince abbess. In this time the cathedral of Essen was built. In those days the name of the city was ''Assindia'' in [[Latin]]. Later it changed over ''Essendia'' and ''Essend'' to ''Essen''. 1377 Essen became a ''free imperial city''. At this time, Essen was just a small city in a region where few people lived. The city became more important when the [[Industrial Revolution]] began. In 1811, ''Friedrich Krupp'' founded a small steel factory in Essen which was fast growing. The city population also grew, and 80 years after the foundation of Krupp's steel work, Essen was a big city with 100,000 inhabitants. Because in the region of the [[Ruhr River]] much coal was found, many coal mines were founded in Essen and other near cities. Great industrial families like the ''Krupp''s, the ''Haniel''s and the ''Grillo''s gave money for cultural buildings like the Grillo theatre and the Folkwang museum. Because of its big industry, Essen was destroyed with bombs in the [[Second World War]]. Many people gave their lives, and many buildings were destroyed. Not all were rebuilt after WW2. But because the coal mining industry ended mining in Essen in the 1970s (coal from abroad was getting cheaper), the city was getting poor. The ''Strukturwandel'' (structural change) saved Essen. Old collieries like ''Zeche Zollverein'' became museums or theatres. In 2003, the universities of Essen and [[Duisburg]] joined as the university Duisburg-Essen. 
 In 2010 Essen was ''Kulturhauptstadt Europas'' (European Capital of Culture) together with [[Istanbul]] and [[Pécs]] in [[Hungary]].

Both newspapers belong to the WAZ-media group. Essen also has a radio station named ''Radio Essen''.

 [[File:Essen Stadtteile und Stadtbezirke.svg|thumb|Districts and boroughs of Essen]] 
 Essen has nine districts (''Bezirke'') and 50 boroughs (''Stadtteile''). The most famous and most known are ''Kettwig'', until 1975 a separate town and not part of Essen, with the ''Altstadt'' of Kettwig, where many timber framing houses are (''Fachwerkhäuser''). Also well-known is ''Werden''. It lays like Kettwig in the south of the city and is the oldest borough of Essen. The ''Werden abbey'' stands here. In Essen-''Rüttenscheid'' there are many cultural buildings (like the ''Folkwang'' or the ''Ruhrland'' museum). The WDR-studio and Essen's trade fair, the ''Gruga'' are also in Rüttenscheid. In the north of Essen is ''Katernberg'', where in the past the coal mine workers lived. Here is ''Zeche Zollverein''. In Katernberg, many houses were built by the Krupp family for their workers. Another big coal mine worker's borough, perhaps the biggest, is ''Margarethenhöhe'' near Rüttenscheid. It is named after Margarethe Krupp, wife of Friedrich Alfred Krupp. The Krupps wanted their workers to be absolutely dependent on them. So they built houses and malls for them, where they should spend their money, what they got from Krupp, again to the industrials. Today Margarethenhöhe is one of the most beautiful boroughs of Essen. Another big borough of Essen is ''Steele'' in the east of the city, that was in the 19th and early 20th century a city as big as Essen. In the west of Essen is ''Borbeck'', which was long separate from Essen. In Borbeck is the great Borbeck Castle (''Schloss Borbeck''). The people of Borbeck speak their own regional dialect, the ''Borbecker Platt''.
