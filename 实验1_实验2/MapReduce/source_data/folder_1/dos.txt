 A '''disk [[operating system]]''' ('''DOS''') will load from a [[floppy disk]] each time a computer starts, and will access that disk for [[software]] to complete operations. [[MS-DOS]] is probably the most well-known DOS, and was purchased by [[Microsoft]] Corporation from a system known as [[QDOS]]. As operating systems became more complicated and took up more space, they began to be permanently installed on [[hard drives]], which are faster and more reliable than floppy disks, and can store more data. This was encouraged by a steady drop in hard drive prices. 
 
 ''DOS''es are usually text-based and without graphics to save space on a floppy disk. Although DOSes have mostly been replaced by [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], and [[Linux]] systems, among others (sporting a [[GUI]], or Graphical User Interface), they are still in use in some places, mostly on older computers. This may be because of a lack of money, the need to use [[software]] which still runs on a DOS system, [[nostalgia]] for an older operating system, or the belief that text-based systems are more efficient. 
 
 Although GUIs are more popular, in times of emergency or when one needs to install special software, a [[boot disk]] allows a user to start his or her computer into a DOS.
