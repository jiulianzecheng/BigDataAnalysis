 '''''Archaeothyris''''' was one of the earliest definite [[synapsid]]s. It lived in the late [[Carboniferous]] period, 306 million years ago. < ref > Falcon-Lang H.J; Benton M.J.  &  Stimson M. 2007. Ecology of early reptiles inferred from Lower [[Pennsylvanian]] trackways. ''Journal of the Geological Society'', London, '''164''', #6. 1113-1118  < /ref >   
 
 It shares this fame with another species ('''''Echinerpeton''''') about which little is known. '''''Protoclepsydrops''''' is even slightly older, but only fragments have been found. 
 
 ''Archaeothyris'' was found in [[Nova Scotia]], in the same area as several other species which were probably [[sauropsid]]s: ''[[Hylonomus]]'', and ''[[Petrolacosaurus]]''.  
 
 ''Archaeothyris'' belonged to a group of early [[pelycosaur]]s which evolved early in the [[Pennsylvanian]]. It is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids (which include [[mammal]]s). 
 
 == Appearance and lifestyle == 
 Unlike the early [[sauropsid]]s, ''[[Hylonomus]]'' and its kin, ''Archaeothyris'' was relatively large, measuring {{convert|50|cm|in}} head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~[[reptiles]]), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged [[canine tooth|canine]]s, suggesting that it was a carnivore. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/n189 186]|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Archaeothyris'' lived in what is now [[Nova Scotia]], about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period ([[Pennsylvanian]]). < ref > Hess J.C  &  Lippolt H.J. 1986. 40Ar/39Ar ages: new calibration points for the improvement of the Upper Carboniferous time scale. ''Chem Geol'' '''59''': pp 143â€“154 < /ref >  Nova Scotia was at this time a swamp, similar to today's [[Everglades]] in [[Florida]]. The 'trees' (actually giant [[clubmoss]]es) were very tall. Some, such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'', were up to {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} tall. ''Archaeothyris'' and the other early [[amniote]]s lived on the [[forest]] floor.
