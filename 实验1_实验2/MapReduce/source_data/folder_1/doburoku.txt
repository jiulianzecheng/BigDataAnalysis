 {{nihongo|'''Doburoku'''|どぶろく or 濁酒}} is a kind of [[sake]]. It is an alcoholic drink made in [[Japan]]. It is made with steamed rice, [[kōji]], water, and [[yeast]]. Actual doburoku is only made with special permission. Something similar is often sold as ''nigori sake''. 
 
 It is very easy to make at home with simple kitchen tools. However, this kind of sake is not legal to make at home in Japan.
