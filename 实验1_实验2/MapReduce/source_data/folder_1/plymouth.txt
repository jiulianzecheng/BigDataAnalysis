 '''Plymouth'''  < !-- Please do not add Cornish translation. It is not and never has been an official language used outside Cornwall, Plymouth is not in Cornwall .  " Plymouth "  is derived from Anglo-Saxon. -- > ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Plymouth.ogg|ˈ|p|l|ɪ|m|ə|θ}}) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[unitary authority]] in [[South West England]]. It is on the south coast of [[Devon]], about {{convert|36|mi|km}} south-west of [[Exeter]] and {{convert|193|mi|km}} south-west of [[London]]. [[Cornwall]] is to its west and south-west. 
 
 Humans in the Plymouth area started in the [[Bronze Age]] when a first [[human settlement|settlement]] was made at [[Mount Batten]]. This settlement continued as a place for [[trading]] for the [[Roman Empire]], until the nearby village of Sutton started in the ninth century was used instead, which is now called Plymouth. In 1588, an English fleet from Plymouth defeated the [[Spanish Armada]]. In 1620, the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] left Plymouth for the [[New World]] and started [[Plymouth Colony]], the second English settlement in what is now [[Massachusetts]], United States. During the [[English Civil War]], the town was held by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. 
 
 Through the [[Industrial Revolution]], Plymouth became a global [[port]], with boats from the United States carrying passengers and [[goods]]. The nearby town of [[Devonport]] became important to the [[Royal Navy]] for its shipyards and dockyards.  In 1914, three towns (the [[county borough]] of Plymouth, the [[County Borough of Devonport]], and the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[East Stonehouse]] were merged, becoming the County Borough of Plymouth. In 1928, it became a city.  During [[World War II]], due to the city being important to the navy, the German military destroyed some of the city by [[bombing]], an act known as the [[Plymouth Blitz]].  After the war, the city centre was completely rebuilt.  Plymouth grew and the towns of [[Plympton]], [[Plymstock]] became part of it in 1967. 
 
 The city has a [[population]] of {{English district population|GSS=E06000026}} ({{United Kingdom statistics year}}) people, making it the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|30th-most populous built-up area]] in the United Kingdom and the second-largest city in the South West, after [[Bristol]]. It is [[government|governed]] locally by [[Plymouth City Council]] and nationally by two [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]]. Plymouth's economy is based mostly on [[ship]]s.  It has ferry links to France ([[Roscoff]] and [[St Malo]]) and to Spain ([[Santander, Spain|Santander]]). It has the largest working naval base in Western Europe, [[HMNB Devonport]], and also has the [[University of Plymouth]]. Plymouth is called a  " Small-Port City "  using the Southampton System for port-city classification. < ref > {{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/03088839.2020.1802785|title=The Southampton system: A new universal standard approach for port-city classification|year=2021|last1=Roberts|first1=Toby|last2=Williams|first2=Ian|last3=Preston|first3=John|journal=Maritime Policy  &  Management|volume=48|issue=4|pages=530–542|s2cid=225502755|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 The Roman Catholic Bishop of Plymouth has his [[cathedral]] here. Plymouth was badly affected by German [[bombing]] during the [[Second World War]], when many [[building]]s were destroyed. The [[Plymouth Fathers]] and the [[Plymouth Brethren]] were both named after Plymouth. Plymouth is linked to Saltash in Cornwall by two bridges across the River Tamar: the Royal Albert Bridge (built in 1859) carries the railway line to Penzance and the Tamar Bridge the A38 main road. On [[Plymouth Hoe]] is the third lighthouse, which used to stand on the Eddystone Rock in the [[English Channel]]. 
 
 ==Sports== 
 It has a [[football (soccer)|football]] team called [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] and a [[rugby football]] team called Plymouth Albion.
