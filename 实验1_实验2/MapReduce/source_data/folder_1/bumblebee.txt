 '''Bumblebees''' or ''bumble bees'', or ''humble bees'') are a group of [[social]] and semi-social [[bees]], of the [[genus]] '''''Bombus'''''. The genus contains about 250 different [[species]], mostly in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. They can also be found in [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass. 
 
 Most bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year (though the queen lasts longer). They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a ''pile''. It is the female worker bee which one sees out collecting pollen. The pollen is packed into two  " baskets "  on its hind, very noticeable when full. The baskets are just hairs specially adapted for this function. 
 
 Most of them have the same social structure as [[honey]] bees do, there is a ''queen'', and there are ''workers'' and ''drones''. The usual size of a [[colony (biology)|colony]] is under 50 members, though some [[tropical]] [[species]] live in larger colonies. 
 
 Bumblebees carry [[Aposematic colouration|aposematic warning colours]], usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual [[Müllerian mimicry]] found in bees and wasps. < ref > {{cite web|title=Williams PH. 2007. The distribution of bumblebee colour patterns world-wide: possible significance for thermoregulation, crypsis, and warning mimicry. ''Biological Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''92''': 97-118|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/projects/bombus/colour.html |access-date=2007-07-09}} < /ref >  Bumblebees are extremely hairy, and that also is a defence against birds. Young birds, particularly, find them difficult to handle. Some birds are regular [[predators]] of bumblebees: the great grey shrike (''Lanius excubitor'') and the [[bee-eater]]s for example. < ref name=Dave > Goulson, Dave 2003.

 == Life cycle == 
 Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the [[Spring]]. The nests are smaller, usually much smaller, than those of hive bees. The queen stores [[sperm]] from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the [[oviduct]] to the [[vagina]]. The females are [[diploid]], the males are [[haploid]]. This is the common method of [[sex determination]] throughout the [[Hymenoptera]]. 
 
 Only fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. To develop, the larvae are fed both [[nectar]] for carbohydrates and [[pollen]] for protein. 
 
 Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by [[aggression]] and [[Odor#pheromones|pheromones]], until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. < ref name= " Honk " > Van Honk C.G.J; Velthuis H.H.W; Röseler P-F.  &  Malotaux M.E. 1980. The mandibular glands of ''Bombus terrestris'' queens as a source of queen pheromones. ''Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata'' '''28''' 2 191–198 < /ref >  The eggs develop into males (drones) if they are not fertilised (haploid), and females if they are diploid. 
 
 Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. < ref > Late in the season some males may be produced by worker females. < /ref >  New queens (those fertilised eggs which are fed on nutritious food) and males leave the colony when they are mature. They mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle. The queens live a number of years. The workers (unfertilized females) live about a season. Drones live away from the hive(s). Queens do not mate with drones from their own hive. < ref name=Dave/ > 
 
 Bumblebees can fly very high. In 2014, ''[[National Geographic]]'' said bumblebees can fly higher than [[Mount Everest]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/02/04/bumblebees-can-fly-higher-than-mount-everest-scientists-find/|title=Bumblebees can fly higher than Mount Everest, scientists find|access-date=October 13, 2020|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|archive-date=November 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107232642/https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/02/04/bumblebees-can-fly-higher-than-mount-everest-scientists-find/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 === Nest size === 
 Nest size ''according to the species'' is between 50 and 400 individuals. < ref name= " BBCT-nest " / >  Colonies have been fiund as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Cueva del Castillo|first1=R|last2=Sanabria-Urbán|first2=S.|last3=Serrano-Meneses|first3=M. A.|year=2015|title=Trade-offs in the evolution of bumblebee colony and body size: a comparative analysis|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=5|issue=18|pages=3914–3926|pmid=26445652|pmc=4588658|doi=10.1002/ece3.1659}} < /ref >  These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees.  
 
 === Nest types === 
 Many species nest underground in old [[rodent]] burrows or sheltered places. They avoid direct sunlight, where nests might overheat. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. Stone-boring bees are found in [[limestone]] walls and cliffs, and sand borers are found in compact sand cliffs. 
 
 A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter. < ref name= " BBCT-nest " > {{cite web|title=Bumblebee nests|url=http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/|publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust|access-date=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922230805/https://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/habitats/bumblebee-nests/|archive-date=22 September 2017|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Parasitic bees == 
 About ten species are called [[cuckoo bumblebee]]s. These are nest [[parasitism|parasites]]: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives. 
 
 == Sting == 
 All bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened. 
 
 They have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone. 
 
 == Bumblebees in England == 
 The BBC has made a number of field reports for its regular Naturewatch  and Spring watch programs. < ref > Links to this source are down.
