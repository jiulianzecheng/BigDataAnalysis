'''Noon''' is the time exactly halfway through the [[day]] (12.00-12:00 in the [[24-hour clock]] and 12:00 PM-12:00 PM in the [[12-hour clock]]). '''Midday''' also means noon, although this also means ''around'' noon, or very early [[afternoon]]. 
 
 '''Solar noon''' is when the [[sun]] appears the highest in the [[sky]], compared to its positions during the rest of the day. It occurs when the Sun is exactly halfway between [[sunrise]] ([[dawn]]) and [[sunset]]. This is also the origin of the terms a.m. and p.m., ''[[A.M.|ante meridiem]]'' and ''[[P.M.|post meridiem]]''.  At solar noon, the sun is due south seen from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and due north seen from the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the [[Equator]] on the [[equinox]]es; at [[Tropic of Cancer ]] ([[latitude]] 23½°N) on the [[summer solstice]] in [[June]]; and at [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23½°S) on the [[winter solstice]] in [[December]]. 
 
 Because of the use of [[time zone]]s and [[daylight saving time]], the highest point of the sun and a [[clock]] time of noon are usually different.  
 
 The opposite of noon is [[midnight]]. 
 
 == Cultural meanings == 
 In traditional [[magical thinking]], '''noon''' represents with [[heaven]], [[order]] and [[life]].
