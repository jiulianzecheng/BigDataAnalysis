 == Mythology == 
 In the creation myth, God Khamlangba was grown out of [[Atingkok|Atiya Sidaba]]. He was a great hunter, warrior and miner. He lived with Goddess Huimu Leima and a son named Amudon was born to them. After this, Khamlangba left [[Ancient Kangleipak]] ([[Antique Manipur]]) for [[Tripura]] ({{lang-mni|Takhel}}) in search of iron ores. When he returned to [[Ancient Kangleipak]] ([[Antique Manipur]]), he settled in [[Kakching]]. The people of [[Kakching]] worshipped Him. Later,  " Kakching Haraoba " , a new form of [[Lai Haraoba]] was developed. < ref name= " Devi " / >  This account is evident in the ''Khamlangba Khunggumlon'' text. < ref name= " Sanajaoba 1988 " / > 
 
 In another legend, God Khamlangba stayed for some time at a place named  " Khuman Heiyel Loubuk " . Later, he came to Kheraching. A person named ''Nganba Tekcha Pamba Laihat Thouba'' beheaded ''Irum Lai Tubi Kokling Lengba''. So, the place where God Khamlangba stayed was later known as Kakching Khullen and Kakching Wairi. < ref name= " Lisam 2011 " / > 
 
 God Khamlangba participated in the divine polo match played among the gods. The divine polo match took place during the reign of the deified Meetei King [[Nongda Lairen Pakhangba]] as described in the [[Kangjeirol]] text. < ref name= " Sanajaoba 1988 " / >  He was one of the 7 polo players in the northern team. His team was led by God [[Marjing]]. On the other hand, his opponent's team (southern team) was led by God [[Thangjing]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=khamlangba & pg=PT102|title=And That Is Why...
