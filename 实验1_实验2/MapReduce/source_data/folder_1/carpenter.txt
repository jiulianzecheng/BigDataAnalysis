 A '''carpenter''' is a person who works with [[wood]]. They can make [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinets]], build [[house]]s, or do other things with wood. 
 
 Carpenters usually make very good foremen (people who watch over a job) on larger jobs as they deal with so much of the project from ground up. Carpenters are always adding to their tools and always learning how to use the new tools, materials, and ways of working with wood. 
 
 Many carpenters will choose to focus their skills in one of two broad ranging categories. Rough carpenters will focus on building things that need to be simple and structural. This includes framing for [[house]]s, or [[crate]]s for shipping. Finish carpenters will focus on things that are detailed and artistic. For example, they can be [[furniture]] builders, [[Cabinet making|cabinet makers]] or [[toy]] makers. [[Wood carver]]s are sometimes counted as carpenters.
