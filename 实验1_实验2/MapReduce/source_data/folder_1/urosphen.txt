 '''''Urosphen''''' is an extinct genus of prehistoric [[bony fish]] that lived from the early to middle [[Eocene]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Urosphen'' was slow like ''[[Nardoechelys]]''. Despite its slow movement, it had different ways to attack other [[Fish|fishes]].  
 
 # It finds a place where the fish live.  
 # It swims, chases, and hunts the fish.  
 # It preys on the creature and eats it.  
 
 If it weren't for the extinction of the other [[Prehistoric eel|prehistoric Anguillidae]], you might think that ''Urosphen'' would hunt other [[Fish|extant fish]]. It has a relative from [[Brazil]] and [[Asia]] called ''[[Urosphenopsis]]''.
