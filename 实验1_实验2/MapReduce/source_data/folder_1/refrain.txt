A '''refrain''' is a [[verse]] or group of verses that is repeated at intervals in a piece of [[music]] or [[poetry]]. In [[song]], it is often called the '''chorus'''. The refrain is often very different to the [[verse]] in [[melody]], [[rhythm]] and [[harmonic]]s. It usually has a higher level of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and activity, often with added [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]. 
 
 In music, a refrain has two parts: the [[lyrics]] of the song, and the melody. Sometimes refrains use slightly different words as they are repeated. Such lines are still able to be recognised as part of the refrain by the fact that it is always has the same tune or melody. The [[rhyme]]s, if present, are also kept even if the words are sometimes different. In [[popular music]], the chorus contrasts with the verse, which leads into it, while the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] contrasts with and leads into both. Many popular songs from the middle of the 20th century consist only of a chorus. < ref > Benward  &  Saker (2003).

 The word comes from [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''refringere'', and later from [[Old French]] ''refraindre'', both of which mean  " to repeat " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/refrain|title=refrain|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=12 October 2013}} < /ref >
