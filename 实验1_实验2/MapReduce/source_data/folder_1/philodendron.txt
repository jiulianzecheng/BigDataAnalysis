 '''''Philodendron''''' (''tree lover'') is a large [[genus]] of the [[Arum]] family, [[Araceae]]. Currently, about 900 different species are known. The plants are [[evergreen]] [[flowering plants]]. Some of them are [[vine]]s, some can grow as [[epiphyte]]s. Most of them grow like bushes. They can reach a height of about 6 meters. 
 
 Very often, ''Philodendron'' are grown as [[houseplant]]s. They grow quickly, and are easy to care for. Sometimes ''[[Monstera]]'' are still called ''Philodendron''. That plant is very similar. 
 
 ''Philodendron'' are sometime grown because they can neutralise some [[poison]]s commonly found indoors, most notably [[formaldehyde]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[benzene]].
