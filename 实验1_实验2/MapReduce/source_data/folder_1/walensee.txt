 The '''Walensee''', also known as ''Lake Walen'' or ''Lake Walenstadt'' from [[Walenstadt]], is a [[lake]] in eastern [[Switzerland]]. It is in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]. Other towns and villages at the lake include [[Weesen]], Quinten, [[Quarten]], and Murg. 
 
 The three main rivers leading to this lake are the [[Seez (river)|Seez]], [[Murgbach]], and [[Linth]]. The last continues its course from Walensee to [[Lake Zurich]]. The [[Schnittlauchinsel]], at the eastern end of the lake, is the only island in the Walensee. 
 
 The [[Churfirsten]] range raises steeply on the north side from the lake's level at 419 m to 2,306 m above sea level.
