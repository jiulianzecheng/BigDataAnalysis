 '''Coffee''' is a [[Drink|beverage]] prepared from roasted [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]]. It's also a [[plant]] ('''[[Coffea]]''') and the name of the [[drink]] that is made from this plant. The [[Coffea|coffee plant]] is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia,]] and now also grow in [[South America]], [[Central America]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. They are an important [[crop]] for the [[economy|economies]] of many countries. 
 
 The drink is made from the [[seed]]s of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called [[caffeine]], a mild drug that keeps people awake. 
 
 To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked. This preserves them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted. Before the beans are made into a drink, they must be roasted or ground (crushed into tiny pieces in a coffee [[mill (grinding)|mill]]). When the ground coffee is placed into [[boiling]] water, the flavour and dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water. Making coffee is called brewing coffee. There are several different ways that coffee can be brewed. 
 
 Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including [[riboflavin]], [[niacin]], magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. 
 
 == Coffee types == 
 
 There are two main types of coffee plants. The ''Coffea arabica'', the most common. Most of the world's coffee is made from Arabica beans, < ref name= " ICO " > {{cite web|title=Botanical Aspects|publisher=International Coffee Organization|url=http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp|accessdate=2007-07-19|archive-date=2009-03-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324155957/http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and the ''Coffea robusta'', which is easier to grow in places where Arabica will not grow. 
 
 Robusta is cheaper and has more caffeine than Arabica < ref name= " Reynolds " > {{cite web | title = Robusta's Rehab | author = Reynolds, Richard | publisher = Coffee Geek | url = http://www.coffeegeek.com/opinions/cafestage/02-01-2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-31 | archive-date = 2007-08-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813215133/http://www.coffeegeek.com/opinions/cafestage/02-01-2006 | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  and it is used in many commercial coffee products. But Robusta tastes [[wikt:bitter|bitter]] and [[wikt:acidic|acidic]], so people only drink it with other things. Better [[wikt:quality|quality]] Robustas are in some [[espresso]] blends. 
 
 In the past, people gave names to new Arabica coffees from the [[Harbour|port]] they came from. The two oldest Arabica coffees are  " Mocha "  and  " Java " . Today, names are more specific. They tell us the country, region, and sometimes even the property where they come from. 
 
 == Single-Origin Coffee == 
 
 Single-origin coffee is a term to describe the coffee varieties that are organically grown in a specific geographical area. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=David|first1=Wahyudi|last2=Intania|first2=Mella|last3=Purnama|first3=Purba|last4=Iswaldi|first4=Ihsan|date=2023-02-06|title=Characteristics of commercial single-origin organic coffee in Indonesia|url=http://www.scielo.br/j/cta/a/nPyQ9rVFNmBNqJL4pxCJfnK/?lang=en|journal=Food Science and Technology|language=en|volume=43|pages=e118522|doi=10.1590/fst.118522|s2cid=256652659 |issn=0101-2061}} < /ref >  For this reason, the overall quality of single-origin coffee is attributed to the agroecological factors in the coffee plantations. External agro ecological factors such as altitudes, temperatures, and quality of the soil are the most significant determiners that play a role in flavor note formation for the green coffee beans inside the coffee cherries.  < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Zakidou|first1=Panagiota|last2=Plati|first2=Fotini|last3=Matsakidou|first3=Anthia|last4=Varka|first4=Evdoxia-Maria|last5=Blekas|first5=Georgios|last6=Paraskevopoulou|first6=Adamantini|date=2021-07-29|title=Single Origin Coffee Aroma: From Optimized Flavor Protocols and Coffee Customization to Instrumental Volatile Characterization and Chemometrics|journal=Molecules|language=en|volume=26|issue=15|pages=4609|doi=10.3390/molecules26154609|issn=1420-3049|pmc=8346979|pmid=34361765|doi-access=free }} < /ref > 
 
 Most of the time, single-origin coffee is the top-notch arabica varieties like Gayo Sumatra, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Lintong Sumatra, Kenya AA, and more varieties going on the list. However, premium-grade robusta can be considered single-origin varieties as long as it grows under an ideal growing conditions.  < ref > {{Cite web|last=shafyra|first=rahmajeng|date=2023-04-05|title=Premium-Grade Robusta: The Shifting Trend for Commercial Coffee in the Coffee Industry|url=https://wallaceacoffee.com/premium-grade-robusta-the-shifting-trend-for-commercial-coffee-in-the-coffee-industry/|access-date=2023-04-05|website=Wallacea Coffee|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 In recent years, more global coffee suppliers provide a diverse selection of single-origin coffees across the globe. Kenya, Indonesia, and Ethiopia are some dependable sources of single-origin coffees that present complex flavor notes. Today, it is relatively easy to purchase single-origin coffee from multiple countries through online shops or luxury coffee shops.

 [[File:Unroasted coffee.jpg|thumb|right|Coffee beans before roasting]] 
 [[File:Roasted coffee beans.jpg|thumb|right|Coffee beans after roasting]] 
 === Aging === 
 Some sorts of coffee taste better if the beans are  " aged " . This means that after they are picked, the beans are dried and then kept from three to eight years. This  " aging "  gives the coffee a less acidic taste. < ref > [http://www.ringsurf.com/online/2091-aging.html  " Coffee Aging " ]. ''Ring Surf''.  Retrieved [[December 11]], [[2007]]. < /ref >  Coffee that has been aged is often mixed or  " blended "  with other coffee that is not aged. 
 
 === Roasting === 
 " Roasting "  is one of the important stages in making coffee beans into coffee. When a coffee bean is roasted, it grows nearly two times bigger and changes from green to yellow to brown. 
 
 The length of time that the coffee beans are roasted makes the coffee taste different. Some types of coffee, such as Mocha and Java, are roasted for a short time. It is easy to tell from the flavour where the coffee is from. When coffee is roasted for a long time, it is harder to tell the different types apart. Green coffee beans can be bought and roasted at home in the oven. 
 
 === Grinding === 
 Before the coffee is made into a drink, it is  " ground "  in a small grinding machine called a  " coffee [[mill (grinding)|mill]] " . The coffee mill breaks the beans into very small pieces. Coffee is turned into a drink in several different ways. For some ways of making coffee, such as  " espresso "  it is best to have the coffee ground into fine [[powder]] but for other types of coffee-making, such as  " filtered coffee " , the coffee is in larger pieces to stop it going through the filter. Finely ground coffee makes a stronger taste. 
 
 === Brewing === 
 Coffee is made into a drink by putting the coffee into boiling water. This is called  " brewing "  coffee.  
 There are many ways to brew coffee.  Four of the most popular are: 
 
 * [[Boiling]]: The coffee and the water are put into a pot on top of the stove and boiled slowly together. This way of making coffee has been used for hundreds of years. It is the way that coffee is usually made in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]]. < ref name=  " Harrison " > {{cite book

 * [[Pressure]]: The boiling water is forced through the ground coffee by a machine. This type of coffee is called Espresso and the machine is called an  " Espresso machine "  or  " Coffee system " . Espresso machines are often found in [[cafe]]s and [[restaurant]]s. Espresso is a very strong coffee that can be used to make other coffee drinks. < ref name= " faq " > {{cite web

 * [[Gravity]]: Filtered coffee is made by gravity because the boiling water falls from a machine onto the coffee. The coffee grounds are held in a paper or metal  " filter "  that the water can run through, but the little coffee pieces cannot. The water becomes coloured and flavoured as it runs through the coffee and into a coffee pot. < ref name=  " Levy " > {{cite book

   | isbn = 978-1552976227}} < /ref > 
 
 * [[Steeping]]: Boiling water is poured onto the coffee and it is allowed to stand for a little while, until the water has taken the colour and flavour. This is often done in a [[French press|cafetière]], which is a tall glass or coffee pot which has a special filter inside that can be pushed down when the coffee is ready so that the person does not drink the coffee grounds. Another way of steeping coffee is to have coffee grounds in a small packet, the right size to make one cup of coffee. The packet is placed in the cup and water poured over it. Then the packet is removed. < ref > {{cite book

 == How people drink their coffee == 
 [[File:Greek Coffee on Corfu.jpg|thumbnail|Greek coffee in a cup]] 
 [[File:Coffee and coffee cake (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Coffee can be drunk with food.]] 
 [[File:A Cappuccino at Amante.jpg|thumb|Cappuccino with whitey foam in Coffee house.]] 
 * ''Black coffee'' is coffee with no [[milk]] in it. 
 * ''White coffee'' is coffee with milk in it.  
 * ''Café au lait'' is coffee made with a lot of hot milk. It is often sweet.  
 * ''Espresso'' is very strong coffee. In Australia, it is often called a  " short black " .  
 * ''Cappuccino'' is espresso with frothed milk (milk mixed with air). A well-made cappuccino should be made of strong coffee. When the frothy milk is poured gently into the coffee cup, it should be white on top and have a ring of darker coffee around the edge. Cappuccino coffee sometimes has [[cocoa]] sprinkled on top.  
 * ''[[Latte]]'' is made like a cappuccino but with added milk and a very thin layer of foam.  
 *  " Flat white "  is a double espresso where milk micro foam is added to the crema (an emulsion of the oils in the coffee beans when combined with hot water that floats) on the double espresso. 
 * ''Americano'' is espresso with a lot of hot water. 
 * ''Irish coffee'' is coffee with whiskey and with cream on the top.  
 * ''Iced coffee'' is espresso in a tall glass with crushed ice, cold milk and [[ice cream]].  
 * ''Vietnamese style coffee (Cafe Sua Da)'' is filtered coffee poured over ice into a glass with sweet [[condensed milk]] (thick milk which has had the water removed). 
 *''Frappé'' has several meanings. It is a mix of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and foam. Another form of the drink is blended frozen coffee. And the last is a milkshake, a thick milkshake. 
 
 == Instant coffee == 
 " Instant coffee "  is a very quick way to make a cup of coffee to drink. It is made in a factory and sold in jars or packets. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Different Types of Instant Coffee|url=https://presto-coffee.com/blogs/coffee/different-types-of-instant-coffee-what-s-the-best|access-date=2021-06-30|website=Presto Coffee Roasters|language=en}} < /ref >  First, strong coffee is made using ground coffee and boiling water. Then, the coffee grounds are filtered out. The coffee liquid is dried out until nothing is left except granules (little crunchy pieces), or fine powder. This is then put into jars or packets. As soon as a spoonful of  " instant coffee "  is added to boiling water, it [[solvation|dissolves]] in the water to make coffee to drink.  The taste can be very different from fresh coffee. Part of the reason for the different taste is that ''Robusta'' coffee beans are usually used for making instant coffee. Robusta coffee beans do not cost as much as ''Arabica''. 
 
 == When people drink coffee == 
 [[File:Aix- café des deux garçons.jpg|thumb|A coffee shop in France]] 
 The United States buys the most coffee; [[Germany]] is next. People in [[Finland]] drink the most coffee for each person. In [[Canada]], the United States and [[Europe]], some restaurants sell mainly coffee; they are referred to as  " [[café]]s "  or  " coffeehouses " . Cafés often sell food, but the type of food is different from one country to another. 
 
 In some countries, for example, those in northern Europe, people like having coffee parties. At these parties, people have coffee and cake. 
 
 In many countries, people drink coffee at work; in the United States and [[England]], for example, people drink it in the morning. In other countries, such as [[Mexico]], people drink it in the evening to help them stay awake. 
 
 == Health problems == 
 Coffee contains the [[drug]] [[caffeine]]. Caffeine is a mild [[stimulant]] which helps to keep people awake.  Caffeine, like many drugs, can be [[addiction|addictive]] and can cause health problems. < ref name= " BJoA " > {{cite journal | title = Caffeine: A summary of some of the known and suspected deleterious effects of habitual use | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_british-journal-of-addiction_1983-09_78_3/page/251 | journal = British Journal of Addiction | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 251–8 |date=September 1983 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1983.tb02509.x | pmid = 6354232 | last1 = James | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Stirling | first2 = K. P. }} < /ref > 
 
 Consuming high amounts of caffeine may increase the risk of anxiety, especially among people with panic disorder or social anxiety disorder. Less commonly, it may trigger mania and psychosis in those who are susceptible. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-07-10|title=Coffee: Benefits, nutrition, and risks|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270202|access-date=2021-06-30|website=www.medicalnewstoday.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Some studies have looked at the health risks of coffee. In February 2003, there was a study in [[Denmark]] of 18,478 women to find out if coffee had an effect on [[pregnancy]] and birth. It was found that if a woman drank between four and seven cups of coffee a day, it did not seem to make a big change to the number of babies that were born dead, ([[stillbirth|stillborn]]). But the women in the study who drank eight or more cups of coffee a day had three times as much chance of having a stillborn baby. < ref > {{cite news|last=Todd|first=Kelsey|date=26 June 2023|title=Coffee During Pregnancy: Cause for Concern?|language=English|newspaper=The Golden Lamb|url=https://thegoldenlamb.com/coffee-science/coffee-during-pregnancy/|access-date=26 June 2023}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/326/7386/420|title=Maternal consumption of coffee during pregnancy and stillbirth and infant death in first year of life: prospective study, British Medical Journal|journal=BMJ|date=22 February 2003|volume=326|issue=7386|page=420|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7386.420|last1=Wisborg|first1=Kirsten|last2=Kesmodel|first2=U.|last3=Bech|first3=B. H.|last4=Hedegaard|first4=M.|last5=Henriksen|first5=T. B.|pmid=12595379|pmc=149440}} < /ref > 
 
 For this, and other reasons, some people drink [[coffee substitute]]s or decaffeinated coffee instead. 
 
 The [[BMJ]] quotes a study that concluded  that there are health benefits for drinking up to four coffee cups per day. However, drinking coffee is not recommended for pregnant women and for  women who are in danger of fractured bones. According to the BMJ not everyone agrees with these findings < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/moderate-coffee-drinking-more-likely-to-benefit-health-than-to-harm-it-say-experts/ |title=Moderate coffee drinking  " more likely to benefit health than to harm it "  say experts  & #124; BMJ |access-date=2019-06-13 |archive-date=2019-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621055818/https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/moderate-coffee-drinking-more-likely-to-benefit-health-than-to-harm-it-say-experts/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
