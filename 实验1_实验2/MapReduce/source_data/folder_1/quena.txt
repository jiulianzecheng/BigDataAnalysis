  }} < /ref >  Made of [[bamboo]], it has six finger holes and one thumb hole and is open on both ends. To make a [[sound]], the player closes the top end of the pipe with the flesh between the chin and lower lip, and blows a stream of air downward, over a notch cut into the end. It is normally in the key of [[G major]]. G is the lowest note when all the holes are covered. It produces a very breathy or airy tone. 
 
 The '''quenacho''' (also  " kenacho "  in English) is a bigger, lower sounding type of quena and made the same way. It is in the key of [[D major]], a fourth lower than the quena. In most of [[Andes]]' towns  " vamos a ir a la quena "  (we will go to the quena) was used to threaten little children, because the quena was made of bamboo, a hard material. 
 
 Quena is mostly used in traditional [[Andean music]]. In the 1960s and 1970s the quena was used by several [[Nueva Canci칩n]] musicians. Some groups such as [[Illapu]] have used it regularly. In the 1980s and 1990s some post-Nueva Canci칩n rock groups have also used the quena in some of their songs; notably [[Soda Stereo]] in ''Cuando Pase el Temblor'' and [[Los Enanitos Verdes]] in ''Lamento Boliviano''. The quena is also relatively common in [[World music]]. 
 
 ==Other flutes== 
 Other Andean flutes include 
 *The '''pinquillo''', also called pinkuyo or pinkiyo, has the same fingering as the quena. It looks and works the same way as a  [[recorder]]. It has an air channel, or fipple, to conduct the air; 
 *The '''[[tarka (flute)|tarka]]''', or tharqa, also like a recorder but it is shorter and quite angular in shape. It needs more breath, and has a darker, more penetrating sound; 
 *The '''mose침o''', or mohose침o, is a long, two tubed bamboo flute with a deep sound. The extra tube acts as an aeroduct.
