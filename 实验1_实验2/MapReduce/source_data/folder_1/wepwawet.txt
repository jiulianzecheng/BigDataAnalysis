In [[Egyptian mythology|late Egyptian Mythology]] Wepwawet (also rendered Upuaut) was originally a war deity whose cult centre was [[Asyut]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. His name means ''opener of the ways'' and he is often depicted as a wolf standing at the prow of a solar boat. Some interpret that Wepwawet is seen as a scout going out to clear routes for the army to proceed forward. One inscription from the Sinai states that Wepwawet  " opens the way "  to king Sekhemkhet's victory. 
 
 Over time, the connection to [[war]], and thus to [[death]], led to Wepwawet also being seen as one who opened the ways to, and through, [[Duat]], for the spirits of the dead.
