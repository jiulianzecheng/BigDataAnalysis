 '''Foraminifera''' or '''''forams''''', as they are called, are an important group of tiny single-celled [[rhizaria]]n [[eukaryote]]s. They are mostly [[Ocean|marine]], though a few live in fresh-water, and even on damp land areas. In the sea, they live both in the [[plankton]] ([[pelagic]]), and in the deeper water (the [[benthos]]). They have ''tests'' (like shells) made of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ). < ref name=Hemleben > Hemleben C. Spindler M.  &  Anderson O.R. 1989. ''Modern planktonic Foraminifera''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. < /ref > 
 
 The organism has [[Pseudopod|pseudopodia]] like an [[amoeba]]. It uses these to capture and eat [[bacteria]] and small [[diatom]]s. Also, many of them keep algal [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbionts]]. Some are ''idioplastic'', which means they eat the [[algae]], but keep the algal [[chloroplast]]s for their own benefit. 
 
 Forams are often used to date [[strata]] in [[palaeontology]]. The detailed record of forams from deep sea drilling projects are the basis of a [[fossil]] index for [[Historical geology|geological period]]s or stages. This is called ''biostratigraphy''. 
 
 Deep sea forams from the [[Mariana Trench]] are below the ''carbonate compensation depth'', below which all CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub >  dissolves. They have evolved organic tests, instead of calcium carbonate ones. < ref > Gooday A.J. Todo Y. Uematsu K. and Kitazato H. 2008.

'''153''', 399â€“423. < /ref >  This suggests that the tests are a vital part of their life-style, perhaps protecting them from other micro-[[predator]]s.
