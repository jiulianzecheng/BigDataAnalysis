 '''Avalonia''' was a micro[[continent]] in the [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]]. Parts of this old microcontinent lie under south-west [[Great Britain]], southern [[Ireland]], and the eastern coast of [[North America]]. Bits of it are in Europe, [[Canada]], and parts of the East coast of the [[United States]]. Avalonia is named after the [[Avalon Peninsula]] in [[Newfoundland]].

 Avalonia started as a chain of volcanoes on the northern margin of [[Gondwana]]. It became a drifting microcontinent. The [[Iapetus Ocean]] in front of it slowly shrank.  
 
 Avalonia collided with other continents. It ended up in the middle of [[Pangaea]]. When Pangaea broke up, Avalonia's remains were divided by the rift which became the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
 
 That is how it came to be part in [[western Europe]], and part in eastern [[North America]].
