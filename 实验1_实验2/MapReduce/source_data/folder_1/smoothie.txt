 '''Smoothies''' are a type of cold drink made from a liquid (either [[milk]], [[fruit]] [[juice]], or [[water]]), crushed [[ice]] or [[ice cube]]s, different [[fruit]]s (such as [[banana]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], or [[pineapple]]). Sometimes other foods are added to smoothies, such as [[yogurt]], [[honey]], [[maple syrup]] or [[ice cream]]. Smoothies are blended with an electric [[blender]] until the fruit and ice is pur√©ed (made smooth).  
 
 People usually drink smoothies from a tall [[glass]] or [[cup]], and use a plastic [[drinking straw]] to suck it into their mouth. Some dieticians think that drinking smoothies is not as good as eating the original fruit, because the smoothie has less fibre, and does not provide exercise for the jaw and other digestive processes which eating the fruit would give. 
 
 Smoothies are similar to [[milk shake]]s. Milk shakes are also a cold drink made with an electric [[blender]]. Milk shakes are usually made with [[milk]], [[ice cream]], and sweet [[syrup]]s, such as [[chocolate]] syrup.
