 A '''lecture''' is when someone talks to a group of people about something interesting.  It is like a [[lesson]].  At [[college]] or [[university]] [[student]]s go to lectures to learn things.  The person who is teaching (talking to the group) is called the '''lecturer''' or sometimes [[professor]].  The lecturer may accept questions from the [[audience]]. 
 
 Sometimes we say that someone was  " given a lecture " .  This means that he was told off for doing something wrong.
