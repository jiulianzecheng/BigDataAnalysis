 '''Junglefowl''' are the four living species of [[bird]] from the genus '''''Gallus''''' in the [[pheasant]] family. They occur in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia. 
 
 These are large birds, with colourful male plumage. They are difficult to see in the dense vegetation they live in. 
 
 The junglefowl are seed-eaters, but [[insect]]s are also taken, particularly by the young birds. 
 
 One of the species in this genus, the [[Red Junglefowl]], is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated [[chicken]].
