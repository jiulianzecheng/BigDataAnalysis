 '''Coburg''' ([[East Franconian German|East Franconian]]: ''Coborch'', ''Coburch'')  is a [[Town#Germany|town]] on the [[Itz (river)|Itz]] River in [[Bavaria]], Germany. Its 2005 population was 42,015. It joined with [[Bavaria]] by popular vote in 1920. Before 1918, it was the larger of the two capital cities in the united [[duchy]] of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. 
 
 Coburg's [[Coat of Arms]] honoring the city's [[patron]] [[Saint Maurice]] was granted in 1493.

 == History == 
 Coburg is about 90 & nbsp;km south of [[Erfurt]] and about 100 & nbsp;km north of [[Nuremberg]]. Coburg was first mentioned in a document dated 1056, although there was a settlement at the site that before then called Trufalistat. Following several changes of noble owners, it came into the hands of the [[Wettin (dynasty)|House of Wettin]] in 1353 when Friedrich III, the Strong, married Katherina von Henneberg. In 1596, it became the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of one of the new Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg]] under the leadership of Duke Johann Casimirs (ruled 1596-1633). 
 
 Due to the royal connections among the royal houses of Europe, Coburg was the site of many royal Ducal weddings and visits. Britain's Queen Victoria made 6 visits to Coburg during her 64-year reign. In 1896 one ceremony brought together Queen Victoria, her son Edward (future Edward VII), her second son Alfred (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), her daughter the German dowager Empress Friedrich (Victoria), and many of her grandchildren, such as Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the future King George V of Great Britain.

 In 1920, two years after the abdication of the last duke, the locals voted to join [[Bavaria]]. Thus whilst the other Saxon-Thuringian principalities were later incorporated into the [[German Democratic Republic]] after [[World War II]], Coburg became part of [[West Germany]] As a result, the town spent the [[Cold War]] years lying right next to the [[Iron Curtain]], surrounded by East German territory on three sides.
