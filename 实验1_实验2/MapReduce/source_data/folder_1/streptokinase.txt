'''Streptokinase''' ('''STK''') is a medication used to dissolve [[Thrombus|blood clots]] (thrombolysis) in human body. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > {{Cite journal|last1=Sikri|first1=Nikhil|last2=Bardia|first2=Amit|date=2007|title=A History of Streptokinase Use in Acute Myocardial Infarction|journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal|volume=34|issue=3|pages=318â€“327|issn=0730-2347|pmc=1995058|pmid=17948083}} < /ref >  Streptokinase is used mainly treat [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] (Myocardia Infarction). There are 2 main types of heart attacks; [[STEMI]] and [[non-STEMI]] and Streptokinase is only used in STEMI type heart attacks after confirming with an [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Streptokinase 1,500,000 iu - Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) - (emc)|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/26905|access-date=2020-09-21|website=www.medicines.org.uk|archive-date=2016-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220184417/https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/26905|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It is given as an injection into a [[vein]].

 == Discovery == 
 Streptokinase was discovered in 1933 by American [[microbiologist]], [[William S.
