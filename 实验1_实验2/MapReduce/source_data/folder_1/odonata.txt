 The '''Odonata''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of flying [[insect]]s, the [[dragonflies]] and [[Damselfly|damselflies]]. They are sometimes listed as the '''Metapterygota'''. 
 
 Like most of the flying insects ([[Diptera|flies]], [[beetle]]s, [[Lepidoptera]] and [[Hymenoptera]]), they evolved in the early [[Mesozoic]] era. < ref name=grimaldi > {{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim/page/n189 175]–187 |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David |last2=Engel |first2=Michael S. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005|isbn=9780521821490 }} < /ref >  Their prototypes, the  giant dragonflies of the [[Carboniferous]], 325 mya, are no longer put in the Odonata. These are now called [[Protodonata]] or Meganisoptera. 
 
 The two suborders are easily distinguished: 
 *Dragonflies: they are '''Anisoptera''' (= usually larger, eyes together  &  wings up or out at rest) 
 *Damselflies: they are '''Zygoptera''' (= usually smaller, eyes apart  &  wings along body at rest) 
 
 All Odonata have [[aquatic]] [[larva]]e called 'nymphs', and all of them, larvae and adults, are [[carnivorous]]. The adults can land, but rarely walk. Their legs are specialised for catching prey. They are almost entirely [[insectivorous]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 These insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by big [[compound eye]]s, legs that catch prey (other insects) in flight, two pairs of long, transparent wings that move independently, and long [[abdomen]]s. They have two [[ocelli]] (eye spots) and short [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing [[mandible]]s in the adult. < ref name=IIBD > {{cite book |author= Hoell H.V., Doyen J.T.  &  Purcell A.H. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to insect biology and diversity |publisher= 2nd ed, Oxford University Press |pages= 355–358|isbn= 0-19-510033-6}} < /ref >
