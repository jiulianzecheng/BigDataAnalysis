 ==Occultism== 
 Occultism is the study of occult. It can involve such subjects as magic (alternatively spelled and defined as [[magick]]), [[extra-sensory perception]], [[astrology]], spiritualism, numerology and lucid dreaming. There is often a strong [[religion|religious]] element to these studies and beliefs, and many occultists profess adherence to religions such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Hermeticism]], [[Satanism]], [[Thelema]], and [[paganism|Neopaganism]]. While [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Islam]] are generally not considered as occult, some of their modern interpretations can be, such as the interpretation of Hinduism within Theosophy or the various occult interpretations of the Jewish [[Kabbalah]]. 
 
 ==Science and the occultism== 
 [[Alchemy]], is considered an occult practice. Alchemy used to be common among scientists, such as [[Isaac Newton]]. < ref > [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/newton/alch-newman.html Newton's Dark Secrets]. < /ref >  During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] alchemy and [[science]] went their separate ways. Newton was accused of introducing occult agencies into natural science when he proposed that [[gravity]] was a force capable of acting over vast distances. < ref > Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', {{ISBN|0-940262-45-2}}. p. 54 < /ref >
