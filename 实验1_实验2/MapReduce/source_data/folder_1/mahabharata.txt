 These sections deal with a number of topics such as a number of aspects of Hinduism, [[Hindu mythology]], [[ethic]]s, and the Hindu way of life.

 Sage Vyasa taught this epic to his son [[Suka]] and his students [[Vaisampayana]] and others. King Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit and grandson of the heroes of the epic, performed a great sacrifice (''yajna''). The epic was retold by Vaisampayana to Janamejaya at the advice of Vyasa. Later on, the other sage Suta retold the ''Mahabharata'' similar to Vaisampayana to Janamejaya, to Saunaka and others, during a sacrifice performed by Saunaka in Naimisaranya, which is near Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh.

 [[Kunti]] wants to fulfil her maternal expectations, but she has no man. She recollects the moment when her first son [[Karna]] was conceived from an arcane ''mantra'' which had given her once. [[Surya]], the Sun God, appeared to her then. Thus, Kunti remembers her secret ''mantra'' and gives birth to the three sons – Yudhistra, Bhima and Arjuna. Yudhisthira’s father was god [[Yama]], Bhima’s father was god [[Vayu]], and Arjuna's father was [[Indra]].
