 '''Labriformes''' is an order of marine [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] which includes the [[Wrasse|wrasses]], [[Odacidae|cales]] and [[Parrotfish|parrotfishes]], within the clade [[Percomorpha]]. Some authors include the Labriformes as the clade Labroidei within the Perciformes while others include more [[Family (biology)|families]] within the Labriformes, such as the [[Cichlid|cichlids]] and [[Damselfish|damselfishes]], but the 5th edition of ''[[Fishes of the World]]'' includes just three listed in the section below and includes 87 genera and about 630 species.
