 '''Ragtime''' (or '''rag-time''') is a musical genre which enjoyed its peak popularity between 1897 and 1918. < ref name= " Perlman and Previn " > {{cite web |url=http://jazzbluesclub.com/uploads/posts/thumbs/1238134246_coversm.jpg |title=The Easy Winners and other rag-time music of Scott Joplin |accessdate=2010-04-26 |last=Perlman |first=Itzhak |archive-date=2013-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426123133/http://jazzbluesclub.com/uploads/posts/thumbs/1238134246_coversm.jpg |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " Berlin " > {{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22825?q=Ragtime & search=quick & pos=1 & _start=1 |title=Ragtime |accessdate=2009-06-29 |last=Berlin |first=Edward |work=The Grove Music Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press }} < /ref > 
 
 Its main characteristic trait is its [[syncopation|syncopated]], or 'ragged', rhythm. < ref name= " Berlin " / >  It began as dance music in the [[red-light district]]s of American cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[New Orleans]] years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. < ref name=Rudi > Rudi Blesh 1981 ''Scott Joplin: Black-American classicist: Introduction to Scott Joplin Complete Piano Works''.

 Ragtime was a modification of the [[March (music)|march]] made popular by [[John Philip Sousa]], with additional [[polyrhythm]]s typical of African music. < ref name=Rudi/ >  The ragtime composer [[Scott Joplin]] became famous through the publication in 1899 of the ''[[Maple Leaf Rag]]'' and a string of ragtime hits that followed. For at least 12 years after its publication, the ''Maple Leaf Rag'' heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its [[melody]] lines, [[Harmony|harmonic progressions]] or [[Meter (music)|metric patterns]]. < ref name=Rudi/ > 
 
 Ragtime fell out of favor as [[jazz]] claimed the public's imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since. First, in the early 1940s many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on [[sound recording|78 rpm records]]. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. 
 
 In 1971 [[Joshua Rifkin]] brought out a compilation of Scott Joplin's work which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. < ref name= " Past Winner Database " > [http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1971/1971grammy.htm Past Winner Database], 1971 14th Grammy Awards. Accessed Feb. 19, 2007. < /ref >  In 1973, the motion picture ''[[The Sting]]'' brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. Subsequently, the film's rendering of Joplin's 1902 rag ''[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]'' was a Top 5 hit in 1974. 
 
 Ragtime (with Joplin's work in the forefront) has been cited as an American equivalent of [[minuet]]s by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[mazurka]]s by [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], or [[Waltz (music)|waltz]]es by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. < ref > H.
