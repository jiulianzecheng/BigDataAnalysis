A '''recession''' is where there is a long period of time where there is economic decline. This can mean that people are choosing not to spend their money (due to [[Deflation]]) or are choosing to rapidly convert their money (due to [[Inflation]]). 
 
 An example of this is the [[Great Recession]] of 2007-2008.
