A '''lipid''' is a type of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]] found in '''living things'''. It is oily or waxy. [[Fats]] are made from lipid molecules. Sources of lipid can be found in [[algae]], [[seeds]], meat, cheese, butter and fish. Lipids are long chains of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] molecules. Lipids are classified as simple and complex. Examples of complex molecules could be [[steroids]] or [[phospholipid]]s.   
 
 A very important biological function of lipids is as [[lipid bilayer]]s, the basis of many [[cell membrane]]s. Another function of lipids is to serve as an energy reserve. Lipids can be hydrophobic (non-polar), or amphipatic (containing both polar and non-polar parts).

 '''Lipids''' are a group of naturally occurring [[molecule]]s that include [[fat]]s, [[wax]]es, [[sterol]]s, fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), [[glyceride]]s, phospholipids, and others. The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy, [[signal transduction|signalling]], and acting as components of [[cell membrane]]s. < ref name=Fahy > {{cite journal |author=Fahy E. |display-authors = etal|title=Update of the LIPID MAPS comprehensive classification system for lipids|journal=Journal of Lipid Research |volume=50 |pages=S9â€“S14 |year=2018 |pmid=19098281 |doi= 10.1194/jlr.R800095-JLR200 |pmc=2674711 |issue=Supplement}} < /ref >
