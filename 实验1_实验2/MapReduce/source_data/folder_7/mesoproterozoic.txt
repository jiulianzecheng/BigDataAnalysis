The '''Mesoproterozoic''' is a [[geology|geologic]] [[era]] which lasted from 1,600 million years ago (mya) to 1,000 mya. 
 
 The major events of this era are:  
 *the breakup of the [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia supercontinent]] ~1,500 mya; 
 *the assembly of the [[Rodinia]] [[supercontinent]] ~1,100 mya; 
 *the [[evolution]] of [[sexual reproduction]]. 
 
 Evidence of a [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[red alga]]e, ''Bangiomorpha pubescens'', has been identified from  ~1200 mya old rocks in the Hunting Formation ([[Nunavut|Somerset Island]], [[Canada]]). This is the oldest known [[sex]]ually reproducing [[organism]] and therefore the earliest known complex [[multicellular organism]]. < ref > Butterfield N.J. 2000.
