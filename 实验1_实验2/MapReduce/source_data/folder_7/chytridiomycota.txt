 '''Chytridiomycota''' is a [[phylum]] of the [[Fungus|Fungi]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. The name comes from '''chytridium''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chytridion'', meaning  " little pot " ): the structure containing unreleased [[spore]]s. 
 
 The chytrids are the most primitive of the fungi. Many chytrids are found in [[fresh water]]. There are approximately 1,000 chytrid species, in 127 genera, distributed among 5 orders. 
 
 Chytrids get their [[energy]] mostly from non-living [[organic matter]]. < ref > That means they are [[saprotroph|saprobic]]. They degrade [[chitin]] and [[keratin]]). < /ref > 
 
 Both [[zoospore]]s and [[gamete]]s of the chytrids are mobile by their [[zoospore#flagella|flagella]], one whiplash per individual. 
 
 Some chytrid species are known to kill [[amphibian]]s in large numbers. The actual process, however, is unknown.
