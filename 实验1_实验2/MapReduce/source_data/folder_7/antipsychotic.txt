 '''Antipsychotic drugs''' or '''Neuroleptics''' are [[drug]]s that act on the [[central nervous system]], and that usually have [[sedative|sedating]] properties. The name ''neuroleptic'' was introduced in 1955. From the 1990s, the term ''antipsychotic'' is the name  that is more commonly used instead. Neuroleptics make the patient calm.  In many of the conditions they are used for, the patients ''lose touch with reality.'' This is called [[psychosis]]. As the name suggests, antipsychotics are also used to lessen the symptoms of psychosis. Today, they are mostly used for the treatment of psychosis, as it occurs in [[schizophrenia]] and  [[bipolar disorder]]. They can also be used to treat [[Depression (illness)|depression]] and mood swings.  
 
 Commonly they are also  used for the following classes of conditions:  
 
 * [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]] and [[Tourette syndrome]] 
 * Depression and [[Personality disorder|personality disorders]] 
 * [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] in children 
 * [[Autism spectrum|Autism-spectrum disoders]] (mostly against irritability, and [[Self-harm|self-harming behavior]])

 Antipsychotics were the first drugs  that allowed to treat people with psychoses. Beforehand, people with an acute psychose would be given cold showers, against their wlll, or they might be chained to a wall. In the [[Middle Ages]], they would be [[Flagellation|whipped]]. Sometimes, people might say that they were [[Possession|possessed]], and they might then be [[burned at the stake]]. Up to the middle of the 20th century, people would be put in a psychiatric hospital. The only  " trearment "  available was locking them up and sedating them. They would then no longer pose a threat to themselves, or to others. Especially in the United States, lobotomy was done. This is a special knd of surgery to the brain. It has the problem that it often fundamentally changes the way the person behaves.
