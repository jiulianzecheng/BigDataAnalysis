 A '''politician''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] πόλις,  " [[polis]] " ) is a person active in [[Political party|party]] [[politics]], or a person holding or seeking office in government.  In [[Democracy|democratic]] countries, politicians seek [[Election|elective positions]] within a government through [[election]]s or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, [[resignation|resigned]] or have been otherwise removed from office.  In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, [[bribery]], [[revolution]]s and intrigues.     
 
 Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of [[government]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title = politician {{!}} someone who is active in government usually as an elected official|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politician|website = www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate = 2015-10-02}} < /ref >   Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.  The word politician is sometimes replaced with the [[euphemism]] [[statesman]].  Basically, a  " politician "  can be anyone who seeks to achieve [[political power]] in any [[bureaucratic]] institution. 
 
 Politicians have always used language, as in speeches or campaign [[advertisement]]s.  They use common [[wikt:theme|theme]]s to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the [[voter]]s. < ref > Jonathan Charteris-Black, ''Politicians and rhetoric: The persuasive power of metaphor'' (Palgrave-MacMillan, 2005) < /ref >   Politicians become [[expert]]s at using the media  < ref > Ofer Feldman, ''Beyond public speech and symbols: Explorations in the rhetoric of politicians and the media'' (2000). < /ref >   With the rise of [[mass media]] in the [[19th century]] they made heavy use of [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[pamphlet]]s, as well as [[poster]]s. < ref > Robert J.
