'''Vibrato''' is a series of very quick changes up and down to the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note. It is like a deliberate, controlled wobble. The word “vibrato” is related to the word “vibrate”. 
 
 Vibrato is used to make a [[melody]] sound more beautiful by making it more expressive. Singers use vibrato, especially when singing dramatic [[solo (music)|solo]] music such as [[opera]]. In [[Italy]] a singer’s vibrato is sometimes called “tremolo”. 
 
 [[Violin]]ists and other players of string instruments produce vibrato by moving the finger backwards and forwards on the fingerboard. Vibrato has to be learned carefully, as the hand needs to be very relaxed. Many beginners who start to use vibrato will try to vibrate too fast and this makes an unpleasant sound. Vibrato can be produced on [[wind instrument]]s by small changes of [[breath]] control. 
 
 Musicians sometimes disagree about how much vibrato was used in earlier times. People who play music from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] or [[Baroque music|Baroque]] on [[period instrument]]s sometimes play without any vibrato. Other people think that players of those days did use some vibrato.
