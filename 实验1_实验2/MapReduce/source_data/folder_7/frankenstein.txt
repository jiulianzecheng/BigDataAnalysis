 '''''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''''' is a [[novel]] written by [[Mary Shelley]]. It is about a creature produced by a strange scientific [[experiment]]. Shelley started writing the story when she was nineteen. It was published when she was twenty-one. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France in 1823. 
 
 Shelley had travelled in the region of [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where much of the story takes place. Ideas about [[occultism]] were topics of [[conversation]] among her travelling companions, especially her future husband, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. Mary, Percy, [[Lord Byron]], and his doctor John Polidori decided to have a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for weeks about what her possible storyline could be, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by the result. She then wrote ''Frankenstein''. 
 
 Since publication of the novel, the name  " Frankenstein "  is often used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard the monster sense of  " Frankenstein "  as well-established and an acceptable usage. < ref > Bergen Evans,  " Comfortable Words, "  New York: Random House, 1957 < /ref > < ref > Bryan Garner,  " A Dictionary of Modern American Usage " , New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998 < /ref > < ref > " Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American English " , Merriam-Webster: 2002 < /ref >  In the novel, the monster however is called  " creature " ,  " monster " ,  " fiend " ,  " wretch " ,  " vile insect " ,  " daemon " ,  " being " , and  " it " . Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster refers to himself as  " the Adam of your labors " , and elsewhere as someone who  " would have "  been  " your Adam " , but is instead  " your fallen angel.
