 '''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}), officially the '''State of Alaska''', is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. It is in the northwest corner of [[North America]].  
 
 Alaska does not touch other US states. It has [[border]]s with [[Canada]], the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Bering Sea]], and the [[Bering Strait]]. 
 The United States bought Alaska from [[Russia]] on March 30, 1867. This was called the [[Alaska Purchase]]. This prevented Russia from having land on continental [[North America]]. Alaska cost $7.2 million. Today, that would be $120 million. The price was about $0.02 per [[acre]] ($4.74/km < sup > 2 < /sup > ).  
 
 Alaska is the [[List of U.S. states by area|biggest state]] in the [[United States]]. < ref > [http://www.toursaver.com/state-of-alaska/ The State of Alaska] < /ref >  It is the 3rd [[List of U.S. states by population|least populated]] state. It has the lowest [[population density]] of [[List of U.S. states by population density|all the states]]. About half of the population of Alaska lives in the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, 731,158 people live in Alaska. < ref name= " PopEstUS " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=December 2011|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2011|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.csv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106033815/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2011/tables/NST-EST2011-01.csv|archive-date=January 6, 2012|accessdate=2011-12-21|work=2011 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]}} < /ref > 
 
 Alaska became an organized (or incorporated) territory on May 11, 1912. It became the 49th state on January 3, 1959. < ref > {{cite video | year =1959 | title =Video: 49th Star. Alaska Statehood, New Flag, Official, 1959/01/05 (1959) | url =https://archive.org/details/1959-01-05_49th_Star_Alaska_Statehood | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]] | accessdate =2012-02-20}} < /ref > 
 
 The name ''Alaska'' comes from the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] word ''alaxsaq''. This means  " the mainland "  or  " the object towards which the action of the sea is directed. " < ref > Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. ''Derivation of the Word  " Alaska " ''. American Anthropologist n.s., 42: pp. 550–551 < /ref >  The land is also called [[Alyeska]], which is another Aleut word that means  " the great land. "  The [[Russian language|Russian]] name was {{lang|ru|Аляска}}. 
 
 Alaska mainly exports [[seafood]], primarily [[salmon]], [[cod]], Pollock and [[crab]]. The [[oil]] and [[gas]] industry is very important in the Alaskan economy. More than 80% of the state's [[revenue]]s is from [[petroleum]] extraction. 
 
 ==  " Seward's Folly "  == 
 [[William H. Seward]], the 24th United States Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaska Purchase  with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2 million. It was called Seward's Folly at the time. 
 
 Russia's ruler then was Tsar [[Alexander II]], the Emperor of the Russian Empire, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland. He also planned the sale.[ < ref >  The man who $old Alaska Archived December 1, 2020, at the Wayback Machine – Anchorage Daily News 
 < /ref >   
 
 The purchase was made on March 30, 1867. Six months later the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged; the formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. In the ceremony 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers marched to the governor's house at  " Castle Hill " , where the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as Alaska Day, a legal holiday on October 18. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Map showing how big Alaska is compared to the other states]] 
 The [[capital city]] is [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], but the biggest city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]. Alaska is the biggest state in the [[United States]], but it has one of the smallest populations. It is also the least densely populated: more than half of the population live in the Anchorage Metropolitan Area. Alaska has almost 20% of all the land in the [[United States|U.S.]], but only about 0.2% of the people. It is not connected to any other states by [[United States|American]] [[land]], but it is connected to the territories of [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] in [[Canada]]. 
 
 Alaska has many [[glacier]]s, some of which are can be seen from passing cruise ships. Some are coastal, and others are not by the [[ocean]]. It is a popular tourist destination, as there is a very rich culture along with beautiful scenery. There are wild animals in Alaska. Some of them are the [[brown bear]], the [[moose]], and the [[wolf]]. 
 
 There are some important [[industry|industries]] in Alaska, like [[Oil industry|oil]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], [[transportation]], [[tourism]], and [[forestry]]. Oil is the biggest industry in Alaska. Most of the oil is very far north in the Alaskan [[arctic]]. A very long [[pipeline]] starts at the northern coast of Alaska and runs to the southern coast. It is over {{convert|800|mi}} long. There were many [[gold rush]]es in Alaska. The [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] (ANC) is ranked as the world's fourth busiest cargo airport. 
 
 [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States, is in Southeast Alaska. The state capital [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]], and the former capital [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], are in Southeast Alaska. < ref > {{Cite web|title=SitNews - 1927: When Ketchikan was the Largest City in Alaska By DAVE KIFFER|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html|access-date=2021-05-04|website=www.sitnews.us}} < /ref > 
 
 == Aleutian Islands == 
 Many active volcanoes are found in the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]] in Alaska. They are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller islands. Most of the Aleutian Islands belong to the U.S. state of Alaska, but some belong to Russia. < ref > The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica (18 December 2015).  " Aleutian Islands " . < /ref > 
 
 One of the world's largest [[Tide|tides]] occur in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of [[Anchorage]], where the differences in the tides can be more than 35 feet (10.7 m). < ref > {{Cite news|last=Porco|first=Peter|date=June 23, 2003|title=Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close|work=Anchorage Daily News}} < /ref > 
 
 It is widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].
