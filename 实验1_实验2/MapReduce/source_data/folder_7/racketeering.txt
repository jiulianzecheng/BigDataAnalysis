 Racketeering might refer to an organized criminal act in which the criminals fraudulently offer services that will not be put into effect or services to problems that do not exist. In many other cases, though, the traditonal racketeering may involve criminals offering an effectual service, like protection from other criminals.  
 
 The terms ''racketeering'' and ''racketeer'' were first used back in 1927. The terms came from a statement of the influence of organized crime within the [[Teamsters]] union. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/110mcrm.htm#9-110.010|title=Organized Crime and Racketeering|publisher=Usdoj.gov|access-date=May 8, 2021}} < /ref >
