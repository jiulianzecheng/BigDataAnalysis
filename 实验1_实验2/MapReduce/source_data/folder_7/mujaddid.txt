'''Mujaddid''' ({{lang-ar|مجدد}}) in [[Islam]] is a [[reform]]er who is given the task of removing errors that have occurred among Muslims. Their job is to show people the great religious truths which the Muslim community will be asked to face. < ref > {{cite book| last = Ali| first = Maulana Muhammad| title = The Religion of Islam by Muhammad Ali| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=etnEKz_rOfgC & pg=PA190| year = 2011| publisher = Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam Lahore USA| isbn = 978-1-934271-18-6| page = 190 }} < /ref >  According to the popular Muslim tradition, it refers to a person who appears at the turn of every [[century]] of the [[Islamic calendar]] to revive [[Islam]], cleansing it of  extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity. In contemporary times, a mujaddid is looked upon as the greatest Muslim of a century. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1590|title=Mujaddid - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Ikhtilaf]] (disagreements) exist among vatious hadith specialists. Scholars and historians like [[Al-Dhahabi]] and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] have interpreted that the term mujaddid can also be understood as plural, thus referring to a group of people. < ref > Fath al-Baari (13/295) < /ref > < ref > Taareekh al-Islam (23/180) < /ref > 
 
 The Arabic word mujaddid means  " reformer " ,  " renovator " ,  " reviver " ,  " renewer "  or  " regenerator " . It is someone who revives and renovates the religion. The concept of [[tajdid]] (renewal or revival) and the term mujaddid come rather from a [[hadith]], a statement of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. This hadith was written down by [[Abu Dawood]] in his [[Sunan]], one of the six authoritative [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] collections of the Prophet's statements. In this hadith, the Prophet says: 
 
 {{quote| " Verily, Allah (God) sends to (or will raise for) this Ummah (the Islamic nation) at the head (the beginning or the end) of every hundred years someone (or people) who will renew (or revive) for it its religion. " < ref > {{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/abudawud/39/1|title=Hadith - Book of Battles (Kitab Al-Malahim) - Sunan Abi Dawud - Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=sunnah.com}} < /ref > }} 
 
 This means reform is in the essential nature of Islam and Muslims are called all the time to work hard to make new ideas cope with [[tradition]]. It also means that not everything in the Muslim tradition is useful and good for this modern age; there are certain things that were possible in the past but are no longer relevant today. [[Slavery]] would be a prime example. < ref > Islam and modernity: Islamist movements and the politics of position by Said Mentak. < /ref > 
 
 == The concept of tajdid in Islamic thought == 
 Tajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought means renewing the ideology representing the intellectual product of Muslims in the fields of science, knowledge and [[ijtihad]] to interpret Islam and understand and explicate its rulings. 
 
 Al-Suyuti mentioned in his book Al-Jami' al-Sagheer,  " Renewing religion means renewing its guidance, clarifying its truth and precedence, refuting the innovations and extremism presented to its followers or their reluctance in upholding it, and following its rules in managing the interests of the people and the law of society and civilization.

 Among the most manifest aspects of tajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought is the renewal of Islamic sciences as follows: < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=1873 & CategoryID=3|title=Renewal (Tajdid) in Islamic sciences|publisher=Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah}} < /ref >
