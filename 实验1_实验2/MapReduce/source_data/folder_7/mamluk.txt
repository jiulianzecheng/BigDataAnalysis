'''Mamluks''' are members of a [[military]] [[caste]] that controlled [[Egypt]] from [[1254]] to [[1811]]. Other mamluks held power in some other Muslim countries. The word means  " slave "  in the [[Arabic language]] and they began as [[slave]]s. In 1517 the Ottoman Empire conquered them, but Mamluks continued to be powerful. [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] defeated them and took control of Egypt in 1811.
