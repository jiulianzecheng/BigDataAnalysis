 A '''take''' is a [[performance]] which is continuously recorded. The word is used in [[movie]]s and [[music]] to track the stages of [[production]]. 
 
 In [[cinematography|movie-making]], a take means each filmed  " version "  of a shot. Takes of each shot are generally numbered starting with  " take one "  and the number of each take after that is increased (with the director calling for  " take two " ,  " take three " ,  " take four " , etc.) until the filming of the shot is finished.
