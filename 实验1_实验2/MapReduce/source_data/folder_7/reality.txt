'''Reality''' means anything that [[existence|exists]]. An [[event]] that has actually happened, or a thing which really exists is said to have  " reality. "  Something close to reality is ''realistic''. 
 
 Reality is the state of things as they are, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined. < ref > ''Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English''. Oxford University Press, 2005. Full entry for ''reality'':  " reality â€¢ noun (pl. realities) 1 the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them. 2 a thing that is actually experienced or seen. 3 the quality of being lifelike. 4 the state or quality of having existence or substance " . < /ref >  In a wider definition, reality includes everything that is and has [[being|been]], whether or not we can see it and understand it. An even wider definition includes everything that has existed, exists, or will exist. 
 
 Reality is often contrasted with what is [[imagination|imaginary]], [[delusion]]al, in the [[mind]], [[dream]]s, what is [[Lie|false]], what is [[fictional]], or what is [[abstraction|abstract]]. 
 
 All the same, what is abstract plays a role in everyday life and in [[academia|academic]] research. For instance, [[causality]], [[virtue]], [[life]] and [[justice]] are abstract [[concepts]]. They are difficult to define, but they are not pure delusions.

 ==Viewpoints on reality== 
 *[[Philosophy]] looks at the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the [[mind]] (as well as [[language]] and [[culture]]) and reality. 
 *[[Science]]: the view that the world described by science is the real world. The scientists' view of reality depends on [[evidence]], tests and [[experiments]], worked out by specialists. In the end, what ends up in [[textbook]]s is what an  " invisible college "  of scientists has agreed on. < ref > Ziman, John 1968.
