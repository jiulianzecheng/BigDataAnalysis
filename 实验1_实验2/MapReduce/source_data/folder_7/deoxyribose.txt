 '''Deoxyribose''' is the sugar component of deoxyribonucleic acid or [[DNA]], having one less hydroxyl group than [[ribose]], the sugar component of ribonucleic acid or [[RNA]].Due to its various attributes it has numerous appellations ie d-2-deoxyribose, a five carbon monosaccharide, and pentose sugar.Deoxyribose is most notable for its presence in the DNA which was first track down by a Russian-born-American biochemist Phoebus Aaron Theodore Levene (1869 â€“ 1940) who discovered ribose (the sugar that forms the alternating backbone of RNA by binding to phosphate group) in 1909 and Deoxyribose in 1929.
