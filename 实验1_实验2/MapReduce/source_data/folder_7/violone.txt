The '''violone''' (pronounced:  " Vee-o-LOH-ne " ) is a very big string instrument that used to be used in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th centuries]].  It is like a [[double bass]], but it belongs to the [[viol]] family.  The name  " violone "  means  " large viol " .  It was really a  " double-bass viola da gamba " .  It usually had six strings, and the fingerboard had [[fret]]s (like a [[guitar]]) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes.  The bow was held underhand (with the palm of the hand facing up).

 The violone is sometimes heard today in [[period instruments|early music]] groups who are playing [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and early [[Baroque music]] music.  The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones. 
 
 == History == 
 The violone was the last member of the [[viol]] family to die out.  When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s and [[cello]]s the violone was often used instead of a double bass. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] used the violone in his [[cantata]]s. Eventually the violone was no longer used, and the double bass was used instead.  The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in [[interval (music)|fourths]].
