The word was coined by scientist [[Andreas von Antropoff]] in 1926 (before the discovery of the [[neutron]]) for the hypothetical  " element of atomic number zero "  (with zero protons in its nucleus) that he placed at the start of the periodic table (denoted by dash, no element symbol). < ref name= " Antropoff 1926 " > {{cite journal|last=von Antropoff|first=A.|date=1926|title=Eine neue Form des periodischen Systems der Elementen|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Angewandte Chemie]]|volume=39|issue=23|pages=722–725|doi=10.1002/ange.19260392303|bibcode=1926AngCh..39..722V}} < /ref > < ref name= " Stewart 2007 " > {{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=P.

[[Science fiction]] and popular literature commonly use the term  " neutronium "  to refer to a very dense phase of matter composed mostly of neutrons.
