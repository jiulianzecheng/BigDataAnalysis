 '''Phosgene''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] COCl < sub > 2 < /sub > .  This gas has no color. The gas was used as a [[chemical weapon|weapon]] during [[World War I]]. It is responsible for most of the deaths related to poison gas during the war. Today, phosgene is used as a tool. It is used for [[organic synthesis]].  When there is a small amount in the air, the smell is similar to that of freshly cut hay or grass.  Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like [[May Blossom]]. When some [[compound]]s of [[chlorine]] and [[carbon]] burn or break down, small amounts of phosgene are given off. < ref name=Ullmann > Wolfgang Schneider and Werner Diller  " Phosgene "  in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002.

 == Uses == 
 Today, most phosgene is used to produce [[isocyanate]]s. The most important isocanates in this context are [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI) and [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] (MDI). Both are [[precursor]]s to [[polyurethane]]s. Large amounts are also used to produce [[polycarbonate]]s. Polycarbonate is produced from its reaction with [[bisphenol A]]. < ref name=Ullmann/ >   Polycarbonates are an important class of engineering [[thermoplastic]]. They can be found in lenses in eyeglasses. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Phosgene is a strong [[poison]]. Its smell may not be noticed. Signs of exposure may sometimes be detected slowly. < ref > {{cite journal

 Phosgene can be seen at 0.4 [[ppm|parts per million]].  This amount is four times the [[Threshold Limit Value|safe]] amount.  Its high ability to poison doesn't come from the hydrogen chloride released by [[hydrolysis|a process]]. It comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary [[alveoli|sac of the lungs]].  The [[alveoli|sacs]] are where the oxygen goes into the body. Their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon.  This will make breathing very hard.  Badges are worn by those at risk of exposure. < ref name=Ullmann/ > 
 
 [[Sodium bicarbonate]] may be used to make spills of phosgene harmless. Gas spills may be made harmless with [[ammonia|a special liquid spray]]. < ref > {{cite web | publisher = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Phosgene: Health and Safety Guide | year = 1998 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg106.htm}} < /ref >
