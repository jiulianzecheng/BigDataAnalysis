A '''pardon''' is a decision that absolves a [[convicted]] person of a criminal conviction. A pardon may be ''full'' or ''partial'': < ref > {{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Apply for a Pardon or Commutation of Sentence|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/how-apply-pardon-or-commutation-of-sentence|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=27 July 2017|date=23 May 2017|archive-date=21 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821170148/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/how-apply-pardon-or-commutation-of-sentence|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 *A '''full pardon''' removes all of the consequences of conviction. 
 *A '''partial pardon''' does not fully absolve a person of the conviction. For example, a partial pardon may not set aside a finding of guilt, or may not fully restore the rights of the person who received the pardon. 
 
 Pardons are sometimes given to people who are wrongly convicted. In that case, the person is cleared of that conviction, as if never convicted. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Williston|first1=Samuel|title=Does a Pardon Blot out Guilt?|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=May 1915|volume=28|issue=7|pages=647â€“663|doi=10.2307/1326170|jstor=1326170|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1326170|accessdate=27 July 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 The practice varies greatly between countries. In the [[United States]] a pardon for a federal conviction may be granted by the [[President]], < ref name= " dojfaq " > {{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Executive Clemency|url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions-concerning-executive-clemency|website=Office of the Pardon Attorney|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=27 July 2017|archive-date=21 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221192518/https://www.justice.gov/pardon/frequently-asked-questions-concerning-executive-clemency|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  while pardons for state convictions may be granted by state [[governor]]s. < ref name= " dojfaq " / > < ref > {{cite web|title=Characteristics of Pardon Authorities|url=http://ccresourcecenter.org/state-restoration-profiles/50-state-comparisoncharacteristics-of-pardon-authorities/|website=Restoration of Rights Project|accessdate=27 July 2017|date=March 2016}} < /ref >
