The band is one of the  " Big Four "  of early thrash metal, with [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. They are well known for many of their songs, including  " Master of Puppets " ,  " The Unforgiven " ,  " One " ,  " Enter Sandman " , and  " Nothing Else Matters " .

 Metallica became popular when they released their third album, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', in 1986. It is called the band's best album. The band was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for their fourth album, ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice For All]],'' in 1988. Their next album, ''Metallica'', was their most popular. The band's latest studio album is ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]''. The band will release a new album ''[[72 Seasons]]'' in 2023. Metallica has sold over 125 total albums. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2018-02-14|title=Metallica to get 'Nobel Prize of music'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43049190|access-date=2022-11-01}} < /ref > 
 
 == Band history == 
 
 === Band starts === 
 The band formed after [[drum]]mer [[Lars Ulrich]] placed an [[advertisement]] in a [[newspaper]] saying that he was looking for musicians to help him [[Cover version|cover]] songs by Tygers of Pang Tang, Diamond Head, and [[Led Zeppelin]]. [[James Hetfield]], a [[guitar|guitarist]] who would become the lead singer of Metallica, answered the advertisement. Later, Lars and James would be joined by another young guitar player looking for a band named [[Dave Mustaine]]. Ulrich, Hetfield, Mustaine, and [[bass guitar|bass]] player [[Ron McGovney]] started playing in the band. Ulrich and Hetfield saw another bass player, [[Cliff Burton]], playing at a concert, and asked him to join the band to replace McGovney. This was because McGovney was having trouble getting along with other band members. Burton joined the band after Ulrich and Hetfield agreed to move from Los Angeles to [[San Francisco]]. In 1983, Mustaine was kicked out of the band for his drug and alcohol problems and violent behavior, and was replaced with guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] who left his previous band, [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]]. Mustaine went on to form his own band named [[Megadeth]]. They became very popular in the metal scene, and have become one of Metallica's metal contemporaries, along with [[Slayer]] and [[Anthrax (US band)|Anthrax]]. All four bands are known as the  " Big Four "  of thrash metal. 
 
 === Successful albums === 
 In 1983, Metallica released their first studio album ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'', on which few of the songs were still credited to Mustaine. One year later, Metallica released their second studio album ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''.  " Ride the Lightning "  and  " The Call of Ktulu, "  the album's final track, were the band's last songs to give Dave Mustaine writing credits. Metallica was one of few bands at the time to deviate from the then popular hair/glam metal trend that was taking place during the 1980s, led by bands like [[Poison (band)|Poison]] and [[Mötley Crüe]]. 
 
 In 1986, Metallica released their third studio album, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', which is widely considered to be one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. On September 27, 1986, Cliff Burton was killed when the band's tour bus crashed in [[Sweden]]. Burton was subsequently replaced by [[Jason Newsted]] after auditioning. 
 
 With Newsted as bassist, Metallica released their fourth studio album ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'', reaching #6 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''. The album features the song  " One, "  which won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1990. The album is criticized for its production and inaudible bass guitar, which is commonly believed to be a result of Jason Newsted's hazing, during which the other members turned down the bass guitar volume on the album. The album is also known for having much more complex song structures than previous albums. 
 
 Metallica reached even greater success with their [[Metallica (album)|self-titled fifth studio album]], which debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and has sold over 15 million copies in the United States. The album won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992, being Metallica's third consecutive Grammy (the second being their cover of Queen's  " Stone Cold Crazy " ). 
 
 === Stage accident === 
 On August 8, 1992, when the band was playing in [[Montreal]], James Hetfield accidentally walked into a 12 foot high blast of fire on stage. He had second and third degree burns. Fortunately, he recovered and was performing with the band again seventeen days after the accident. 
 
 Metallica's music shifted towards a more mainstream hard rock style, and continued their success with [[Load (album)|Load]] and [[ReLoad]], released in 1996 and 1997, which both debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Despite the albums' success, many fans were unhappy with the large change of style from Metallica's previous albums. 
 
 In 1998, Metallica released [[Garage, Inc.]], which was an album of cover songs by many of the artists that influenced Metallica, such as [[Motörhead]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Thin Lizzy]], and [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. 
 
 In 2001, Newsted left Metallica to start his own project, [[:en:Echobrain|Echobrain]], much against the band's wishes, particularly James Hetfield. Their eighth studio album, ''[[St. Anger]]'', was released in 2003, with producer [[:en:Bob_Rock|Bob Rock]] playing bass after Newsted's departure. ''St. Anger'' also debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, but was even further disliked by fans than Load and Reload. Shortly after the release of ''St. Anger'', bassist [[Robert Trujillo]] joined the band after a long auditioning process with many bassists. At Trujillo's request, his audition song was Battery, a very fast-paced song from ''Master of Puppets''. 
 
 ''[[Death Magnetic]]'', the band's ninth studio album, was released in September 2008, and debuted at #1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making Metallica the first band to achieve five consecutive #1 albums in United States. ''Death Magnetic'' showed a return to the band's [[thrash metal]] roots. From 2008 to 2010, Metallica performed their [[:en:World_Magnetic_Tour|World Magnetic Tour]] supporting the album's release. The tour concluded in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] November 21, 2010. 
 
 In June 2010, Metallica attended the Sonisphere Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria with the rest of the Big 4, alongside Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer. Between Metallica's encores, all four bands took the stage to perform  " Am I Evil? "  by [[:en:Diamond_Head_(band)|Diamond Head]]. 
 
 In 2011, ''[[Lulu (album)|Lulu]]'', a collaboration album between Metallica and Lou Reed, was released. Many Metallica fans were dissatisfied due to stylistic differences between Reed and Metallica, but the album has managed to garner success. 
 
 In October 2013, Hetfield stated in an interview that the band would start working on their next album in early 2014. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/metallica-106-1243995|title=Metallica's James Hetfield says band are 'itchin'' to start work on new album|last=NME|date=9 October 2013|website=NME}} < /ref >
