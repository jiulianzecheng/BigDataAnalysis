 '''Hornworts''' are a type of [[bryophyte]]s. They are [[non-vascular plant]]s which do not have tissue that moves water. The name  " hornwort "  come from the horn-like structure that grows on these plants. This structure is the [[sporophyte]]. The flattened, green part of a hornwort is the [[gametophyte]]. 
 
 Like all bryophytes, hornworts have [[alternation of generations]]. In this cycle, the plant has two forms: the [[haploid]] gametophyte and [[diploid]] sporophyte. The gametophyte is the green plant body that you most often see. The sporophyte is the  " horn "  that sheds [[Spore|spores]]. 
 
 Hornworts grow all over the world. They grow well where it is damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny [[weed]]s in the [[soil]] of gardens and cultivated [[field]]s. Some tropical [[species]] may be found growing on tree [[bark]]. 
 
 The [[taxonomy]] of bryophytes is being debated. Some think the hornworts should be placed in a separate [[division (botany)|division]], the '''Anthocerotophyta'''.
