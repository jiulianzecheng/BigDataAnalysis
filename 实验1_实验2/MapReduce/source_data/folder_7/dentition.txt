 '''Dentition''' is the development of [[teeth]] and where the teeth are in the [[mouth]]. Almost all [[mammal]]s have up to four different types of teeth: [[incisor]]s, [[canine tooth|canine]]s, [[premolar]]s, and [[molar]]s. Animals that have different types of teeth are called ''' " heterodont " '''. If they do not, they are called ''' " homodont " '''. 
 
 In mammals, the young have a set of '''primary teeth''' (milk teeth) that fall out after a few years. When they fall out, adult teeth grow in. Animals that have milk teeth and adult teeth are called '''diphyodont'''. 
 
 == Archaeology == 
 Dentition is important in [[archaeology]]. Dentition is used to study human [[migration]]. Tooth [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] contains [[trace element]]s which show where they grew.
