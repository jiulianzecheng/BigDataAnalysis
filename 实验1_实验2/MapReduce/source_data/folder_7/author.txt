An '''author''' is a person who makes an original piece of work. Most people use author to mean [[writer]]. While a writer is a type of author, authors often do more than write. Anyone who creates something original is an author. This could be written items such as [[book|books]], [[story|stories]] or  [[poem|poems]]. This could also be other types of art, such as [[sculpture]] or [[music]]. Any type of work can be made by an author.   
 
 ==''Writer'' and ''author''== 
 {{main|Writer}} 
 The term author is commonly used to refer to a person who writes as a [[profession]]. It is also believed by many that the term is used for writers who are [[wikt:distinguished|distinguished]] and who have had their works [[Publishing|published]]. These [[explanation|explanations]] are common with people who work with those that write professionally. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-01-27|title=Difference between a Writer and an Author|url=https://eliteauthors.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-an-author-and-a-writer/|access-date=2023-08-28|website=Elite Authors|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 An author does not always have to be a writer. If a person [[wikt:simple:dictation|dictates]] a letter to a [[secretary]], then the secretary is a writer but the person who dictated the letter is the author.
