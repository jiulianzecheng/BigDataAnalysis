 A '''Spatula''', also called a '''turner''', or a '''fish slice''', is a [[kitchen]] tool with a long handle and a flat top, used for lifting food. 
 
 ==Design== 
 Spatulas have a handle that is long enough to keep the user's hand away from what they want to lift, flip, or [[scrap]]. 
 The blade is usually somewhat flexible, and shiny. Spatula blades are often longer on the right side than the left. Most have long slots on the blades to allow liquids to go through, though some have simple holes or no holes at all. 
 
 Spatulas are usually made of [[plastic]] or [[metal]], with a wooden or plastic handle to keep it away from [[heat]]. Spatulas made for outdoor [[grilling]] have very long handles. 
 
 Spatulas can be colorful or have designs on them. They can be used as art in the home.
