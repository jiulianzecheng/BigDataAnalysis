 '''Brighton''' is a [[city]] on the south coast of [[England]]. It was called  " Brighthelmstone " . It is in the county of [[East Sussex]]. In 2000, it joined Hove to become the city of '''Brighton  &  Hove'''. Historically, Brighton forms the main part of the Brighton/[[Worthing]]/[[Littlehampton]] [[conurbation]], with 474,485 inhabitants (2011 census). This is England's 12th largest conurbation, and the mostly densely populated area outside [[London]]. < ref > [http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx 2011 Census: built-up areas] < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 From the 1730s, Brighton entered its second phase of developmentâ€”one which brought a rapid improvement in its fortunes. The fad for bathing in seawater as a cure for illnesses was encouraged. < ref name=Seldon > Seldon, Anthony 2002. ''Brave new city: Brighton  &  Hove past, present, future''. Lewes: Pomegranate Press. {{ISBN|0-9542587-1-1}} < /ref >  From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France. Road transport to London was improved when the main road via [[Crawley]] was [[Toll road|turnpiked]] in 1770. < ref name=Gwynne > Gwynne, Peter 1990. ''A history of Crawley''.

 From 1780, development of [[George VI|Georgian]] terraced houses started. The fishing village developed to the fashionable [[resort]] of Brighton. Growth of the town was encouraged by the [[patronage]] of the [[Prince Regent]] (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]) after his first visit in 1783. He spent much of his leisure time in the town, and had the [[Royal Pavilion]] built during the early part of his [[Regency era|Regency]]. 
 
 The arrival of the [[London and Brighton Railway]] in 1841 brought Brighton within the reach of [[Day trip|day-trippers]] from London. Some major attractions such as the West Pier and the Brighton Palace Pier were built for the growing number of tourists. The population grew from around 7,000 in 1801 to more than 120,000 by 1901. 
 
 In 1984, a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing]] killed five people. 
 
 Modern-day Brighton is a centre for education, sports, and recreation. It has two universities: [[University of Sussex]] and the [[University of Brighton]]. It also has 54 other schools.  
 
 In 2003, the universities of Sussex and Brighton formed a medical school, known as Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Brighton has a thriving LGBT community and every year in the first weekend in  August Pride festivities are held.
