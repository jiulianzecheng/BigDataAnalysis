 The '''''yuzu''''' is a [[citrus fruit]] and [[plant]]. It originated in [[East Asia]]. The fruit looks like a rough small and yellow [[grapefruit]], and changes colour from green to yellow when it becomes more [[ripe]]. 
 
 The yuzu is often used in Japanese and Korean cuisine. It appears much like a lemon but tastes more like a floral lime.
