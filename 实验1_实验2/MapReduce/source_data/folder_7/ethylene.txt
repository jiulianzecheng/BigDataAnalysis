 '''Ethylene''' or '''ethene''' is a [[chemical compound]] with two [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and four [[hydrogen]] atoms in each [[molecule]].  These molecules are put together with a [[double bond]] that makes it a [[hydrocarbon]].  It is very important in [[industry]] and has even been used in [[biology]] as a [[hormone]]. < ref name=Wang_2002 > {{cite journal | author = Wang K, Li H, Ecker J | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling networks. | journal = Plant Cell | year = 2002 | volume = 14 Suppl | issue = Suppl| pages = S131-51 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.001768 | pmid = 12045274 | pmc = 151252 }} < /ref >   It is also the most made [[chemical]].

 ==History== 
 Since [[1795]], ethylene was called an ''olefiant gas'', or ''oil making gas''.  This was because it came together with [[chlorine]] to make the ''oil of the Dutch chemists''. 
 
 In [[1866]], the [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] came up with a system for naming hydrocarbons. The [[suffix]]es -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to call the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogen atoms than the [[alkane]] it came from. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/Hofmannaeiou.html|title=Hofmann's Proposal for Systematic Nomenclature of the Hydrocarbons|author=A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.|accessdate=2007-01-06|publisher=www.chem.yale.edu|archive-date=2006-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903081507/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/Hofmannaeiou.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   Because of this system, ethylene became ethene. 
 
 In [[1979]], the [[IUPAC]] decided that ethylene would stay ethylene. 
 
 ==How it is made== 
 Ethylene is made in the chemical industry by [[steam cracking]].  Some of the parts of an ethylene plant can be: 
 
 # The steam cracking furnaces; 
 # Heat recovery systems; 
 # A steam recycling system; 
 # A system to [[compress]] the cracked gas; 
 # A system to remove [[acid]] gas; 
 
 There are other systems in an ethylene plant.  The systems listed above were the most important systems in an ethylene plant. 
 
 Since making ethylene uses a lot of energy, the people making the ethylene try very hard to keep the heat from the gasses from leaving the [[furnace]]s.
