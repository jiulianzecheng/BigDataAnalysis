 A '''meme''' ({{IPAc-en|m|iː|m}} {{respell|MEEM}}) is an [[idea]] or [[belief]] which spreads because one person copies it from another. 
 
 One idea is that [[culture]] builds in a way similar to living things. An example would be how viruses spread to different organisms. Memes change as they go, creating controversy, and sculpting society. Just as a virus would, memes evolve from their state, being photoshopped, and exaggerated. Memes can be about anything.  
 
 [[Biologist]] and evolutionary theorist [[Richard Dawkins]] invented the word ''meme'' in 1976. < ref > Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', 11. Memes:the new replicators, Oxford University, 1976, second edition, December 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-217773-7}}; April 1992, {{ISBN|0-19-857519-X}}; trade paperback, September 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-286092-5}} < /ref >  He said that [[melody|tunes]], [[catch-phrase]]s, [[belief]]s, clothing [[fashion]]s, ways of making pots, and the [[technology]] of building arches were all examples of memes. 
 
 == Examples of memes == 
 * [[Technology]]: cars, paper-clips, etc. The progress of technology is a bit like [[genetics]], because it has spread by '[[mutations]]' or changes to progress. For example, many paper-clip designs have been made. Some last longer than others, and some look better than others. In the end the ones that are copied are a memetic success. 
 * [[Joke]]s spread and change the more they are told. 
 * [[Proverb]]s 
 * [[Gossip]] 
 * [[Nursery rhyme]]s: passed on from [[parent]] to child over many generations (thus keeping old words such as  " [[tuffet]] "  and  " chamber "  popular when they are not used today). 
 * [[Epic poem]]s: once important memes for preserving oral history; writing has largely superseded their oral transmission. 
 * [[Conspiracy theories]] 
 * [[Recipe]]s 
 * [[Fashion]]s 
 * [[Religion]]s: complex memes, including [[folk religion|folk religious]] beliefs, such as [[The Prayer of Jabez]]. 
 * Popular concepts: these include [[Freedom (political)|Freedom]], [[Justice]], [[Ownership]], [[Open Source]], [[Egoism]], or [[Altruism]] 
 * Group-based biases: everything from [[anti-semitism]] and [[racism]] to [[cargo cult]]s. 
 * Longstanding political memes such As  " [[mob rule]] " , [[national identity]], ''[[Yes Minister]]'' and  " republic, not a democracy " . 
 * [[Programming paradigms]]: from [[structured programming]] and [[object-oriented programming]] to [[extreme programming]]. 
 * [[Internet phenomenon|Internet phenomena]]: [[Internet slang]].  " [[Internet meme]]s "  propagate quickly among users using email, websites, blogs, discussion boards and other Internet communications as a medium. 
 * [[Moore's Law]]: this meme is particularly interesting. The original law was  " semiconductor complexity doubles every 18 months " .  It described growth in terms of the number of transistors on a chip. 
 * Metameme: The concept of memes itself is a meme. 
 * [[Anecdote]]s: Short jokes or other stories. 
 * [[Phrase]]s; and common expressions.  
 * [[Viral marketing]]: A type of [[marketing]] based on memes and using  " [[word of mouth]] "  to advertise (see the [[as of 2007|recent]] example of ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]''). 
 * [[Chain letter|Chain-letters]]
