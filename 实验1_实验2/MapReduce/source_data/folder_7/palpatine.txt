 '''Sheev Palpatine''', also known as '''Darth Sidious''' or simply as '''The Emperor''', is a Dark Lord of the Sith and the main antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. The character is played by [[Ian McDiarmid]].   
 
 As the senator of Naboo, he cultivated two identities (Sidious and Palpatine) to further his political power over the galaxy, and he was eventually elected the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. With his Sith apprentices [[Darth Maul]] and [[Count Dooku|Darth Tyranus]], Sidious orchestrated the Clone Wars and various other crises to achieve galactic dominance with the fall of the Republic and destruction of the Jedi Order. Shortly after betraying Tyranus and orchestrating his death, Palpatine lured Anakin Skywalker to the dark side as his new apprentice, [[Darth Vader]], and reorganized the Republic into the Galactic Empire, declaring himself Emperor. His reign was unchallenged until the formation of the Rebel Alliance. During the Galactic Civil War, the Emperor sought to betray Vader by replacing him with his son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. This backfired when Luke refused to join him, while Vader renounced the dark side and killed his master to protect Luke, destroying the Sith and bringing balance to the Force as the prophesied Chosen One. 
 
 However, Palpatine was later able to use the dark side to resurrect himself inside a cloned body. Upon reviving, he aimed to take revenge on the Skywalkers and return to power. His plans culminated in the emergence of the First Order and destruction of the New Republic, the establishment of the Sith Eternal's fleet (the Final Order), besides luring Ben Solo (the heir to the Skywalker bloodline) to the dark side by communicating with him through the Force and creating Supreme Leader Snoke, who eventually becomes [[Kylo Ren]]'s master. During the Battle of Exegol, he was finally killed by his granddaughter, Rey, who called upon the strength of past Jedi and turned his own power against him. 
 
 == Pop culture == 
 Since the initial theatrical run of ''Return of the Jedi'', Sidious has become a widely recognized symbol of [[evil]] in popular culture, and since the prequel films, also one of sinister deception and the subversion of [[democracy]].
