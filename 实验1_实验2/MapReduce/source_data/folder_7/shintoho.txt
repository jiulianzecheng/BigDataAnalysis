 '''Shintoho Company, Limited''' (新東宝株式会社 ''Shin Tōhō Kabushikikaisha'', lit ''New Toho Co., Ltd.'') was a short-lived Japanese film studio. It was founded by defectors from [[Toho Company, Ltd.|Toho]] in 1947 and was financed by [[Daiei Film|Daiei]]. In 1961, Shintoho declared [[bankruptcy]] and a successor was founded the same year, named Shintoho Eiga, which went on to specialize in pink films. 
 
 Shintoho is considered to be one of the 6 major film studios active during the 1950s'  " Golden Age of Japanese Cinema " , which also included [[Toho Company, Ltd.|Toho]], [[Daiei Film|Daiei]], [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], and [[Toei Company|Toei]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Founded in 1947 as an offshoot of Toho after the major company had become struck with labor turmoil, Shintoho began its relatively short existence producing such films as ''[[:en:Stray_Dog_(film)|Stray Dog]]'', which was later distributed by Toho, and ''[[:en:The_Life_of_Oharu|The Life of Oharu]]''. However, the company found itself to be outflanked by other much larger studios and appointed [[Mitsugi Ōkura|Mitsugu Okura]] as its new top executive in 1955 to guide the company toward better things. Under the guidance of Okura, Shintoho began producing such works as the critically acclaimed [[:en:Super_Giant|Super Giant series]], [[:en:War_film|war films]], a slew of pink films, and a number of films centered around the [[supernatural]] among a handful of others. 
 
 In May of 1961, Shintoho declared bankruptcy and two new companies were formed to take its place. Mitsugu Okura, Shintoho's former president, created the [[:en:OP_Eiga|Okura Eiga]] studio after purchasing Shintoho's production facilities in Tokyo. At this time [[Koichi Goto]], a former Shintoho employee, purchased the rights to the Shintoho name and 3 years later established Shintoho Entertainment. In 1972, this new company relocated from [[Osaka]] to [[Tokyo]] and absorbed another piece of the original Shintoho, as well as receiving a new name:  " Shintoho Eiga " . Shintoho Eiga also later went on to distribute a number of Shintoho's films and former director for Shintoho, [[Kiyoshi Komori]], began directing pink films for Shintoho Eiga in 1964 until his retirement in the 1970s.
