 '''Brive-la-Gaillarde''', commonly called '''Brive''', is the [[subprefecture]] of the [[Corrèze]] departement. Until 1919, the name of the city was Brive; since then it has been known as Brive-la-Gaillarde. About 50.000 people live in the city, and close to 100.000 in its urban area. The city goes back to [[antiquity]]; its name simply means [[bridge]]. In this case, the [[Corrèze (river)|Corrèze]] was easy to cross at this place. [[Gundoald]] was elected king of Aquitaine in Brive, in the year [[584]].
