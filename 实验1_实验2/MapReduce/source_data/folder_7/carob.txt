 The '''carob''' is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[Evergreen|evergreen tree]]  in the [[pea]] family, [[Fabaceae]]. Its  [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] is ''Ceratonia siliqua'' L. 
 
 It is widely grown for its [[edible]] [[:en:wikt:pod|pod]]s, and as an [[ornamental]] tree in gardens. The ripe, dried pod is often ground to carob powder, which is used to replace [[cocoa]] [[powder]]. Carob bars, an alternative to chocolate bars, are often available in health-food stores. 
 
 ==Names== 
 The tree is known in English as '''carob tree''', '''St John's-bread''' or '''locust bean''' (not to be confused with the [[Parkia biglobosa|African locust bean]]). 
 
 The word '''carob''', used commonly for the fruit, comes from [[Middle French]] ''carobe'' (modern {{lang-fr|caroube}}), which borrowed it from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|خَرُّوبٌ}} (''kharrūb'',  " locust bean pod " ). < ref name= " etymo " > {{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0 & search=carob |title=Carob |work=Online Etimology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016 }} < /ref >

 ''Ceratonia siliqua'', the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the carob tree given by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] to this plant, comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''kerátiοn'' κεράτιον 'fruit of the carob (from ''keras'' κέρας 'horn'), and [[Latin]] ''siliqua''  " [[:en:wikt:pod|pod]], carob " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.winternet.com/~chuckg/dictionary/dictionary.167.html |title=sicula - sinuatus |work=Dictionary of Botanical Epithets |access-date=8 August 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 The '''carat''', a [[carat (mass)|unit of mass]] for gemstones, and of [[Carat (purity)|purity]] for gold, takes its name, indirectly, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for a carob seed, ''kerátion''. < ref name= " etymo "  / > 
 
 ==Description== 
 [[File:Ceratonia siliqua, total.jpg|thumb|right|Carob tree]] 
 The carob tree grows up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. The crown (the upper part of tree)  is broad and semispherical, supported by a thick [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] with brown rough [[bark]] and solid and firm [[branch]]es. [[Leaf|Leaves]] are {{convert|10|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, alternate and compound. 
 
 Most carob trees are [[Flowering plant sexuality|dioecious]] (with separate [[male]] an [[female]] plants) but some are [[hermaphrodite]]. The male trees do not produce fruit. The trees blossom in autumn. The flowers are small and in an [[inflorescence]] axis in [[Inflorescence|raceme]]s like [[Inflorescence|catkin]]s; the [[pollination]] is by both wind and insects. 
 
 The [[fruit]] is a [[legume]] (also known as a pod). The pods take a full year to develop and ripen. The sweet ripe pods eventually fall to the ground and are eaten by various mammals ([[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cow]]s), and so the hard seeds are dispersed. 
 
 ===Where it grows=== 
 The carob tree is [[Native (ecology)|native]] to the [[Cyprus]] island, [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]]. < ref name= " agro " > {{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Ceratonia_siliqua.PDF |title=Ceratonia siliqua |work= worldagroforestry.org |page=2 |access-date=8 August 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 It is generally found within 30-45°N and 30-40°S and from sea level to an [[altitude]] of {{Convert|500|-|1000|m|ft|abbr=on }}. < ref name= " feedipedia " > {{cite web | last1=Heuzé | first1=V. | last2=Sauvant | first2=D. | last3=Tran | first3=G. | last4=Lebas | first4=F. | last5=Lessire | first5=M. | title=Carob (''Ceratonia siliqua'') | url=http://www.feedipedia.org/node/320 | publisher = Feedipedia.org.

 It has been introduced into regions with a similar [[Mediterranean climate]]. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 ===Food=== 
 [[File:Carob chocolate chip cookies with coconut and cranberries.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate chip cookies with carob powder instead of cocoa powder]] 
 Carob eaten by humans is the dried (and sometimes [[roast]]ed) pod. The pod have 5 to 18 hard brown seeds (10% of the pod weight) within a sweet thick [[wikt:pulp|pulp]] substance. < ref name= " feedipedia "  / > 
 
 Carob is mildly sweet and is used in powdered, chip, or syrup form as an ingredient in cakes and cookies, and as a substitute for [[chocolate]]. Carob bars are widely available in health food stores. A traditional sweet, eaten during [[Lent]] and [[Good Friday]], is also made from carob pods in Malta. 
 
 Carob pod meal is used as an energy-rich feed for livestock, particularly for ruminants, though its high tannin content may limit its use. < ref name= " feedipedia "  / > 
 
 ===Syrup, drinks=== 
 In [[Cyprus]], carob [[syrup]] is known as Cyprus's black gold, and is widely [[Export|exported]]. In [[Malta]], a syrup (''ġulepp tal-ħarrub'') is made out of carob pods. Carob syrup is also used in [[Crete]] as a natural [[Artificial sweetener|sweetener]], and is considered a natural source of calcium. It contains three times more calcium than milk. It is also rich in iron, phosphorus, and natural fibers (Due to its strong taste, it can be found mixed with orange or chocolate). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://cretansoil.com/en/natural-food-products/71-bioaroma-carob-syrup-ideal-for-sugar-replacement-osteoporosis-weight-loss-350-ml-1183fl-oz-5200120590282.html|title=Bioaroma carob Syrup - ideal for sugar replacement-osteoporosis-weight loss|author=Maria T.|date=19 June 2015|work=CretanSoil - best natural products|access-date=9 August 2016|archive-date=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828012306/http://cretansoil.com/en/natural-food-products/71-bioaroma-carob-syrup-ideal-for-sugar-replacement-osteoporosis-weight-loss-350-ml-1183fl-oz-5200120590282.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Carob juice drinks are traditionally drunk during the [[Islam]]ic month of [[Ramadan]]. Crushed pods may be used to make a [[beverage]]; [[:en:wikt:compote|compote]], [[liqueur]], and syrup are made from carob in Turkey, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and Sicily. Several studies suggest that carob may aid in treating diarrhea in infants. < ref > {{Cite journal|vauthors=Fortier D, Lebel G, Frechette A |title=Carob flour in the treatment of diarrhoeal conditions in infants|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=68 |issue=6|pages=557–61 |date=June 1953 |pmid=13059705 |pmc=1822828}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Ornamental=== 
 ''C. siliqua'' is widely [[plant]]ed in the [[horticulture|horticultural]] as an [[ornamental plant]] for planting in [[Mediterranean climate]] and other [[temperate]] regions around the world, as in [[California]] and [[Hawaii]]. The plant can be used as a dense and large [[hedge]]. < ref name= " GRIN " / > 
 
 ===Production=== 
 According to [[FAO]], the top carob-producing countries are (in [[Ton|metric tonne]]s, 2012): ''Source: [[UN Food  &  Agriculture Organisation]] (FAO)'' < ref > {{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=339 & lang=es |title=Major Food And Agricultural Commodities And Producers – Countries By Commodity |publisher=Fao.org |access-date=8 August 2016}} < /ref >
