 The '''aardwolf''' (''Proteles cristata'') is a small, [[insectivore|insectivorous]] [[mammal]], native to [[East Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. Its name means  " earth wolf "  in the [[Afrikaans]] / [[Dutch language]]. It is also called  " maanhaar jackal "  in [[Afrikaans]], < ref name= " OED " > Oxford English Dictionary Online < /ref >  or ''civet hyena'', based on the secretions (civet) from their [[anal gland]]s. < ref name=ingo > Rieger, Ingo 1990. Hyenas. In Parker, Sybil P. (ed) ''Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals'', vol 3. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-07-909508-9}} < /ref > 
 
 The aardwolf is in the same family as the [[hyena]]s. Unlike many of its relatives in the order [[Carnivora]], the aardwolf does not hunt large [[animal]]s, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats [[insect]]s, mainly [[termite]]s – one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky [[tongue]] to capture them. < ref name=mh71 > Mills, Gus  &  Harvey, Martin 2001.

 The aardwolf lives in the [[scrubland]]s of eastern and southern Africa – these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is [[nocturnal]], resting in [[burrow]]s during the day and coming out at night to eat. 
 
 Anal gland scent-marking plays an important role in mating-season in both sexes as it is the primarily communication method. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Stoeckelhuber|first1=Mechthild|last2=Sliwa|first2=Alexander|last3=Welsch|first3=Ulrich|year=2000|title=Histo-physiology of the scent-marking glands of the penile pad, anal pouch, and the forefoot in the aardwolf (Proteles cristatus)|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0185%2820000701%29259%3A3%3C312%3A%3AAID-AR80%3E3.0.CO%3B2-X|journal=The Anatomical Record|language=EN|volume=259|issue=3|pages=312–326|doi=10.1002/1097-0185(20000701)259:3 < 312::AID-AR80 > 3.0.CO;2-X|pmid=10861364|s2cid=9250632 |issn=1097-0185}} < /ref >
