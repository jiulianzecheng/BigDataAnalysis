The '''proletariat''' (often shortened to  " ''prole'' "  in [[slang]]) is a term used by [[Communism|communists]] for a segment of society. It describes the class of workers in [[urban]] areas who work in [[industry]] or [[manufacturing]]. These urban workers are different from the [[peasant]]s, who are workers who do [[farming]] jobs in [[rural]] areas. Someone is who part of the proletariat class is called a '''proletarian'''.  
 
 The political [[philosophy|way of thinking]] of [[communism]] states that the proletariat should have a revolution and take over the [[means of production]]. They are often sarcastically referred to as  " wage-slaves. "   
 
 The proletariat is the laboring bulk of society that does most of the useful, necessary work, and pays most of the taxes. It is also perceived by [[capitalist]]s as being necessary for those reasons: labor and taxes, plus being available to [[exploitation|exploit]] to produce profits. 
 
 == History == 
 The word proletariat comes from the [[Latin]] word ''proletarius'', which means  " maker of offspring " . In [[Ancient Rome]], the ''proletarii'' were the people who were so poor that the only form of property that they had were their children, who could be used as soldiers. 
 
 == Modern use == 
 [[Karl Marx]] used the word ''proletariat'' to describe people who did not own the means of productions (such as factories and land) and had to work for others for a wage. He thought the proletariat class could overthrow the capitalist system and society more just. He learned about the word while studying Roman law in Berlin. < ref > Cf., [[:en:Sidney_Hook|Sidney Hook]], ''Marx and the Marxists'' (Princeton: Van Nostrand 1955) at 13. < /ref >  In Marxist theory, the lumpenproletariat ( " rag-proletariat "  in German) were a class of people who were not interested in revolution. 
 
 Marx believed that the [[bourgeoisie]] exploited the proletariat.
