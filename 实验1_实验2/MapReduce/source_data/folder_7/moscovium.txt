{{Infobox moscovium}} 
 '''Moscovium''' is a [[Superheavy element|superheavy]] [[synthetic]] [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] also known as '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-bismuth'''. It has the symbol '''Mc''' and the [[atomic number]] 115. Moscovium does not exist in nature. It is made from a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction between [[americium]] and [[calcium]]. 
 
 The element is named in honor of the Russian city of [[Moscow]]. 
 
 Moscovium is in or near the center of the [[theory|theoretical]] [[island of stability]]. No [[stable]] [[isotopes]] of moscovium have yet been found. The most stable isotope with 184 neutrons is  < sup > 299 < /sup > Mc. The isotope that has been made has only 175 neutrons ( < sup > 290 < /sup > Mc). 
 
 == Uses == 
 There is no use of Moscovium at the moment because of its radioactivity and the fact that it decays pretty quickly. 
 
 == History == 
 On [[February 2]], [[2004]] a [[report]] that moscovium and [[nihonium]] were [[discovery of the chemical elements|made]] was written in a [[journal]] named [[Physical Review]] C. The report was written by a team of [[Russia]]n [[scientist]]s at [[Dubna]] University's [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] and [[United States|American]] scientists at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. < ref > {{cite journal | year = 2004 | title = Experiments on the synthesis of element 115 in the reaction  < sup > 243 < /sup > Am( < sup > 48 < /sup > Ca,xn) < sup > 291−x < /sup > 115 | journal = Physical Review C | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 021601 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevC.69.021601 | bibcode = 2004PhRvC..69b1601O | url = http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRC/v69/e021601 | last1 = Oganessian | first1 = Yu.

 These people reported that they [[bombardment|bombarded]] [[americium]] with [[calcium]] to make four [[atom]]s of moscovium. 
 
 Scientists of [[Japan]] also report that they have made moscovium. 
 
 In May [[2006]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] this element was made by another method and what the final products from [[radioactive decay]] were was found by [[chemistry|chemical]] [[analysis]]. 
 
 == Name == 
 [[File:Plac Czerwony 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Moscow, the city in whose honor the element Moscovium is named.]] 
 The name was changed to Moscovium. It used to be named ununpentium. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://iupac.org/iupac-announces-the-names-of-the-elements-113-115-117-and-118/|title=IUPAC Announces the Names of the Elements 113, 115, 117, and 118|date=2016-11-30|website=IUPAC {{!}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-09}} < /ref > < !-- 
 Scientists from [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] proposed for element the name  " Langevenium "  (Ln) - in honor of French physicist F. Langeven. -- completely unsourced statement with no mention or confirmation outside this article, and his name was Langevin, and moreover P. Langevin -- > 
 
 ==Chemical properties== 
 Not enough moscovium has been made to measure its [[physical property|physical]] or [[chemical property|chemical]] properties. It is thought that it would be a hard metal. It may be slightly colored. 
 
 Moscovium is in the same group as [[bismuth]] but its [[chemical property|chemical properties]] will be different. The chemistry of ununpentium will be very [[influence]]d by [[special relativity]]. It will make its properties different to the other elements in the periodic table that have a smaller atomic number. < ref > {{cite journal | year = 1974 | title = Predicted properties of the superheavy elements.

L. | last2 = Nestor | first2 = C. W. | last3 = Fricke | first3 = Burkhard }} < /ref >  One important difference from bismuth is the presence of a stable [[oxidation state]] of +I (Mc < sup > + < /sup > ). The (Mc < sup > + < /sup > ) [[ion]] is thought to have chemical properties like [[thallium|Tl]] < sup > + < /sup > . 
 
 ==In popular culture== 
 Moscovium is inside or near the [[island of stability]]. This is probably why it is found in [[popular culture]]. It is more likely to be talked about in [[UFO]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}} 
 
 The most popular story about moscovium is from [[Bob Lazar]]. It is not [[pseudoscience]] because it is a refutable theory, however Lazar's claims are not backed by any direct experimental evidence at this time. < ref > [http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/critiq.htm Lazar Critique] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220030435/http://www.serve.com/mahood/lazar/critiq.htm |date=2006-12-20 }}, D.
