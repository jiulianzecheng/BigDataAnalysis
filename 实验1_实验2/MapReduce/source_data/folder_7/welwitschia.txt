 '''''Welwitschia''''' or ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' is known as one of the oldest living [[plant]]s. It can be called a  " living [[fossil]] " . The plant is mainly found in the [[desert]]s of [[Namibia]]. Some of these plants may be more than 5000 years old. This would make them the oldest living things on [[Earth]]. 
 
 It is named after the discoverer, Dr. Friedrich Welwitsch. The plant is locally called  " '''long haired thing''' " . Its structure consists of a short, woody, top-shaped stem, and never more than two leaves, which are enormously long, (two or three metres) and break up at the ends.
