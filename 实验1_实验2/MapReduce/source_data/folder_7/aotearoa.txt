'''Aotearoa''' is the current [[Māori language]] name for [[New Zealand]]. It has replaced previous translations such as ''Niu Tirani'' (which was used in the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]) and ''Niu Tireni'' (which was used in the Whakaputanga Declaration of Independence). It translates to ''the land of the long white cloud'' or ''one long white cloud''.
