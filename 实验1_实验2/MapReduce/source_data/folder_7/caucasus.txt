 The [[Caucasus Mountains]] are commonly recognised as a natural border between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Countries in the Caucasus are considered to be in one or both [[continent]]s, with Armenia and Azerbaijan considered [[Transcontinental country|transcontinental]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] largely considered [[Europe|European]].  The northern portion of the Caucasus is known as the [[North Caucasus|Ciscaucasus]] and the southern portion as the [[Transcaucasus]].  The highest peak in the Caucasus is [[Mount Elbrus]] (5,642 m) which, in the western Ciscaucasus in Russia, is generally considered the highest point in Europe.

 == Myths and Legends == 
 The Biblical [[Mount Ararat]] where [[Noah's Ark]] landed is known as the landmark of the ancient Armenian realm. The peak of Ararat is seasonally capped with snow. In Greek mythology, the Caucasus or Kaukasos was one of the pillars supporting the world. [[Prometheus]] was chained there by [[Zeus]]. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] placed Caucasus in [[Scythia]] and said it was a cold and stony mountain which was the abode of personified hunger.
