In Western [[Maharashtra]] the Satavahanas were overthrown by Mahakshatrapa Isvaradatta in circa A.D. 230 as shown by his dated coin recently discovered. As it bears the title Mahakshatrapa, he must have acknowledged at least nominally the suzerainty of the contemporary Kushana king. He used the Saka era in recording the dates on his coins. His rule and that of his successor (if he had any) lasted only for twenty years; for the Abhira ruler Isvarasena, who rose to power in A.D. 250 soon conquered Western Maharashtra, Gujarat, Konkan and the Anupa country. His era commencing in that year spread to all these countries. The Saka era at this second time was current in Maharashtra only for twenty years. The Abhira era starting in A.D. 250 remained in use for several centuries till the conquest of Western Maharashtra and the other adjoining countries in A.D. 620, when the Early Chalukya king Pulakesin II defeated Kalachuri Buddharaja And annexed those countries to his empire. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6E0aAAAAIAAJ|title=Numismatic Digest|date=1981|publisher=Numismatic Society of Bombay.|language=en}} < /ref >
