 The company started operating in [[1934]]. Their first product was the professional 35 mm film. Two years later, in 1936, amateur film was added. In 1939, the organization established the Ashigara Research Lab. Research there helped Fuji to make their first color film in [[1948]]. 
 
 In the mid-[[1950s]], the company entered the magnetic media market. In 1954 Fuji created a laboratory for the research of magnetic technologies and in 1960 began making magnetic tapes. In [[1963]], the range was expanded with a two-inch videotape. 
 
 Fuji had a monopoly on camera film in Japan. It became one of the main sponsors of the 1984 [[Los Angeles Olympics]].
