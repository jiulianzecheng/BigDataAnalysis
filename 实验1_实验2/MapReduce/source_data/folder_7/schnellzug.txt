A '''Schnellzug''' is an express train in German-speaking countries, where it refers to trains that do not stop at all stations along a line. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] it is also referred to colloquially as a '''''D-Zug''''', a short form of '''''Durchgangszug''''' ( " through train " ), and express train services were often given numbers preceded by the letter ''D''. The similar term, ''snälltåg'', was used in Sweden until January 1980. 
 
 On the railway networks operated by the [[Deutsche Bahn]] (DB), the [[Austrian Federal Railway]] (ÖBB) and the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] (SBB) today, express trains are divided into categories such as [[Eurocity]], [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]], [[Interregio]] etc. The DB still occasionally runs ''D-Zug'' services in [[sleeping car|night train]]s (''[[D-Nacht]]''), especially those to its eastern European neighbours, and as relief trains. Museum services running on DB routes are also given ''D-Zug'' numbers. ÖBB runs D-Züge on main routes from/to Vienna on weekends and during rush hours.
