 The '''Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel''' or '''Carmelites''' (sometimes simply '''Carmel'''; {{lang-la|Ordo fratrum Beatæ Virginis Mariæ de monte Carmelo}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious order]]. It was begun in the 12th century on [[Mount Carmel]], from which the order receives its name. St. Albert of Jerusalem gave the group its rule for life in 1206. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|title=The Carmelite Rule|url=https://carmelites.net/the-carmelite-rule/|access-date=2023-03-05|website=Order of Carmelites|language=en-US}} < /ref >   Few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived. Women were officially accepted into the Order as nuns in 1452. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Nuns|url=https://ocarm.org/en/carmelites-around-the-world/the-carmelite-nuns|access-date=2023-03-05|website=ocarm.org|language=en-gb}} < /ref >
