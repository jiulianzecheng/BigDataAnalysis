 '''Rwanda''' is a [[country]] in [[Africa]]. It is near [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo-Kinshasa]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]. In the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994, over one million (1,000,000) people were killed. 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Colonialism=== 
 During the [[Scramble for Africa]], [[Belgium]] conquered Rwanda. The Belgians then began to divide Rwandans into groups: Hutu, and Tutsi. The Belgians picked people that they thought looked more European to be Tutsi. The rest became Hutu. The Belgians told Rwandans that Tutsi were superior to Hutu. They helped Tutsi rule over Hutu using their army. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What Impact Did the Belgian Presence in Rwanda Have to Spark Further Conflict?|url=https://education.seattlepi.com/impact-did-belgian-presence-rwanda-spark-further-conflict-5558.html|access-date=2020-10-24|website=Education - Seattle PI|author=Steven Skok|quote=Allowing the existing Tutsi monarchs to exhibit control over the Hutu proved immediately effective, allowing for colonization without a large force of European troops. The Belgians further exploited the Tutsi-Hutu division, lending military and political support to Tutsi leaders who maintained the policies of their colonial rulers.}} < /ref > 
 
 ===After independence=== 
 On July 1, 1962, Rwanda became independent and Hutu were given power. Thus, anti-Tutsi purges occurred frequently. Many Tutsi fled to Uganda, where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF, which tried to invade Rwanda in 1990. 
 
 ===The genocide against Tutsi=== 
 On the night of April 6, 1994, dictator [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]'s plane was shot down, but it is still not clear who did it. Within half an hour, [[roadblock]]s manned by the [[Interahamwe]] [[militia]] were seen all over the capital, [[Kigali]]. The [[Rwandan genocide|genocide against Tutsi]] had begun. It lasted for about 100 days, and it left over one million (1,000,000), Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead. The main weapon used was the [[machete]], or ''umupanga''. Other countries paid little attention to the killing. On July 2, 1994, the RPF captured Kigali. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.kgm.rw/education/|title=Education – Kigali Genocide Memorial|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-22|archive-date=2020-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213040241/https://www.kgm.rw/education/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Geography== 
 [[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kagera River|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu River|Ruvubu]] rivers, part of the upper [[Nile]]|alt=Photograph of confluence of the Kagera and the Ruvubu, with the Rwanda-Tanzania border post in foreground, taken from a nearby hilltop]] 
 At {{convert|26338|km2|sqmi}}, Rwanda is the world's 149th-largest country. The entire country is at a high altitude.  The lowest point is the [[Ruzizi River|Rusizi River]] (also sometimes spelled '''Ruzizi''') at {{convert|950|m|ft|0}} above sea level. Rwanda is in Central/Eastern Africa.  It is bordered by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the west, [[Uganda]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the east, and [[Burundi]] to the south. It is a few degrees south of the [[equator]] and is [[landlocked]]. The capital, Kigali, is near the centre of Rwanda. 
 
 The country's longest river is the [[Nyabarongo River Wetlands|Nyabarongo]]. The Nyabarongo-Kagera eventually drains into [[Lake Victoria]]. Rwanda has many lakes, the largest being [[Lake Kivu]]. It is one of the twenty deepest lakes in the world. Other sizeable lakes include [[Lake Burera|Burera]], [[Lake Ruhondo|Ruhondo]], [[Lake Muhazi|Muhazi]], [[Lake Rweru|Rweru]], and [[Lake Ihema|Ihema]]. Ihema is the largest of a string of lakes in the eastern plains of [[Akagera National Park]]. 
 
 [[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|left|Lake and volcano in the [[Virunga Mountains]]|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga mountains behind, partially in cloud]] 
 There are many mountains in central and western Rwanda. The highest peaks are found in the [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga]] volcano chain in the northwest. This includes [[Mount Karisimbi]], Rwanda's highest point, at {{convert|4507|m|ft|0}}. The centre of the country is mostly rolling hills. The eastern border area has [[savanna]], plains and swamps. 
 
 Rwanda has a [[temperate]] [[Tropical climate|tropical highland]] climate.  It has lower temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries.  This is because of its high elevation. Kigali, in the centre of the country, has a typical daily temperature range between {{convert|12|°C|°F}} and {{convert|27|°C|°F}}.  There is little change through the year. There are two rainy seasons in the year. The first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two [[dry season]]s.  The major one is from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all.  There is a shorter and less severe one from December to February.

 In prehistoric times [[montane forest]] covered one third of the land of present-day Rwanda. Naturally occurring vegetation is now mostly in the three [[National park]]s, with terraced [[agriculture]] in the rest of the country. [[Nyungwe Forest|Nyungwe]], the largest remaining forest, has 200 species of tree as well as [[orchid]]s and [[begonia]]s. Vegetation in the [[Volcanoes National Park]] is mostly [[bamboo]] and moorland, with small areas of forest. Akagera has a [[savanna]] ecosystem.  Here there are mostly [[acacia]]. There are several rare or endangered plant species in Akagera, including ''[[Markhamia lutea]]'' and ''[[Eulophia guineensis]]''. 
 
 The greatest diversity of large mammals is found in the three National Parks. Akagera has typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants, while Volcanoes is home to about one third of the worldwide [[mountain gorilla]] population. Nyungwe Forest has thirteen primate species including [[chimpanzee]]s and ''[[Colobus]]'' monkeys. The Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa. 
 
 There are 670 bird species in Rwanda.  There is a difference between the east and the west. Nyungwe Forest, in the west, has 280 recorded species. Species include the [[Ruwenzori Turaco]] and [[Handsome Francolin]]. Eastern Rwanda, by contrast, has savanna birds such as the [[Black-headed Gonolek]] and those who live near swamps and lakes, including [[stork]]s and [[Crane (bird)|cranes]].
