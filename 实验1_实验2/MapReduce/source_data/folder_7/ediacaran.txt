The '''Ediacaran''' period (about 635–541 million years BC), is named after the Ediacara Hills of [[South Australia]]. It is the last geological period of the [[Proterozoic]] [[eon]]. The Edicaran is followed by the [[Cambrian]], the first period of the [[Palaeozoic]].  
 
 The period is famous for the first larger-bodied fossils, which are probably the first recorded [[metazoa]]ns. These were impressions or [[trace fossil]]s, first found in England's [[Charnwood Forest]], [[Leicestershire]]. < ref > Hill E  &  Bonner T.G. 1877. The PreCarboniferous rocks of Charnwood Forest.

 The status of the Ediacaran as an official geological period was confirmed in 2004 by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).

 == The Vendian == 
 The Ediacaran period was previously called the '''Vendian''' period. The Vendian period was proposed in 1952 by Russian geologist/[[paleontologist]] Boris Sokolov. < ref name= Sokolov1952 > {{cite journal

 The two terms are not the same. The Vendian was a longer period: it included the whole of the [[Marinoan glaciation]], of [[Snowball Earth]] fame. In other words, the Vendian included the last part of the [[Cryogenian]] period.

 The Ediacaran lasted for about 90 million years. It began at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] [[Snowball Earth]]. It ended with the first appearance worldwide of some kinds of trace fossils ([[Treptichnus pedum]]) at the base of the Cambrian. < ref name=Knoll2004a > A. Knoll ''et al'' 2004.

This caps glacial deposits and shows a sudden climatic change at the end of the Marinoan [[ice age]]. The period ended with the mass [[extinction]] of almost all the Ediacaran [[fauna]]. 
 
 No exact [[radioactive dating|dating]] has been possible at the type section of the Ediacaran period in [[South Australia]]. 
 
 == Ediacaran biota == 
 {{main|Ediacaran biota}} 
 
 The Ediacaran biota include the oldest definite [[multicellular organism]]s. The fossils are traces or impressions of soft-bodies forms with segments, fronds, disks, or bags. Skeletons or shells are not found.
