 ==Appearance== 
 Mimikyu is one of the strangest Pokémon as its true identity is hidden under the disguise it has on. There has been many [[fan art]] works of what fans believed to be Mimikyu's true form. However, recently in a [[anime]] episode it is shown that it is a ghostly orb and anyone who looks at its yellow eyes will die of shock.
