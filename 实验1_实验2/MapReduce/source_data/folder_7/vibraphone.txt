 The '''vibraphone''' is an [[percussion instrument]].  It looks like a [[xylophone]] but the bars are made of [[aluminium]] instead of [[wood]].  Like the xylophone, the bars are arranged in a similar way to a piano keyboard so that tunes can be played.  An alternate form is the [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6-system]], where each row has the bars in a [[Whole-tone scale|whole-tone]] distance and both rows are in a [[semitone|half-tone]] distance.  The player uses [[mallet]]s (beaters), either one or two in each hand.  There are tubes underneath each bar.  These are called  " resonators " .  They make the sound louder.  There is also an electric motor which can be switched on by a [[pedal]].  This makes fans go round and round in the ventilators and makes a very strong, vibrating sound.  This is why the instrument has its name.  Sometimes people call a vibraphone '''vibes'''. 
 
 Vibraphones were first made in the [[United States]] in 1921. 
 
 The mallets are beaters with a rubber ball at the end.  [[Yarn]] or a hard cord is wound tightly round these balls.  Vibraphone mallets are usually slightly harder than the ones ones used for the [[marimba]].  They usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel, most commonly made of rattan or birch (other materials, such as nylon, are sometimes used). Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba.  There are different ways of holding them.  A common way is to hold them between the thumb and [[finger|index finger]], using the other fingers to help control the sticks.  Playing with four mallets is harder, but allows the player to play [[harmony]] ([[chord]] with four notes). 
 
 Sometimes special techniques are used such as  " pitch bending " .  This is done by sliding one of the mallets along a bar in a special way.  Occasionally players are asked to use a [[bow (music)|bow]] such as [[cello]] or [[double bass]] bow, and bow across the edge of a bar. 
 
 The vibraphone is used in the orchestra in [[Alban Berg]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''.  It is also used in works by [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Vaughan Williams]] (opening of Symphony no 8).  Vibraphones are commonly heard in [[jazz]], especially in [[combo]]s.
