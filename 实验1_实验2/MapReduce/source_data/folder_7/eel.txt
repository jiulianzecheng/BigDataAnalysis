 '''Eels''' are [[teleost]] [[fish]]. < ref > Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly, eds. 2009.  " Anguilliformes "  in FishBase. January 2009 version. [https://www.fishbase.se/Summary/OrdersSummary.php?order=Anguilliformes] < /ref > < ref > McCosker, John F; Paxton J.R.  &  Eschmeyer W.N. (eds). 1998. Encyclopedia of Fishes. San Diego: Academic Press. pp. 86â€“90. ISBN 0-12-547665-5. < /ref >  They have long and narrow bodies like [[snakes]]. Adult eels can be as short as 10 & nbsp;cm  or as long as 3 & nbsp;m. It depends on their species. The large eels can weigh up to 65 & nbsp;kg. 
 
 Eels have fewer [[fin]]s than other fish. They do not have all the belly and chest fins. The back and [[anus|anal]] fins are long and usually connected to the tail fin. The fins do not have [[spine]]s. 
 
 The shoulder bones are separate from the skull. The [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] have smooth edges or are absent. 
 
 Eels hatch from eggs. Baby ([[larva]]l) eels are flat and transparent (clear). They are called ''leptocephalus'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for  " thin head " ). A young eel is called an '''elver'''. For a long time people did not know where eels came from, because baby eels look very different from adults. They thought the babies were a different species. 
 
 Most eels prefer to live in the shallowest parts of the [[ocean]]. They live at the bottom of the ocean, sometimes in holes. Eels in the [[Anguillidae]] family come to [[fresh water]] to live there. Eels in the Nemichthyidae family swim about 500 & nbsp;m below the ocean [[surface]]. Eels in the Synaphobranchidae family live as deep as 4000 & nbsp;m below the surface. 
 
 Hand [[Fishing net|netting]] (catching with nets) is the only [[law|legal]] way of catching eels in [[England]]. It has been done for thousands of years on the [[River Parrett]] and [[River Severn]]. 
 
 Most eels are [[predator]]s. They hunt their [[prey]]. 
 
 ==Classification== 
 True eels belong to the [[order (biology)|order]] (group) '''Anguilliformes''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for  " eel-shaped " ). This order has 4 suborders (smaller groups) called ''Anguilloidei'', ''Nemichthyoidei'', ''Congroidei'', and ''Synaphobranchoidei''. 
 
 The suborders are separated into 19 [[family (biology)|families]]. The families are [[wikt:divide|divided]] into 110 [[genus|genera]]. The genera are then divided into [[species]]. There are 400 species of eels in all. 
 
 The term  " eel "  is also used for other eel-shaped fish, such as [[electric eel]]s, [[Mastacembelidae|spiny eel]]s, [[swamp eel]]s, and [[deep-sea spiny eel]]s. These other [[clade]]s, however, evolved their eel-like shapes independently from the true eels. Eels live both in salt water and fresh water and some species are [[catadromous]] (they [[migrate]]). 
 
 == Uses == 
 [[Anguillidae|Freshwater eels]] (''unagi'') and marine eels (Conger eel, ''anago'') are used in [[Japan]]ese food. Eels are used in Cantonese ([[Hong Kong]]) food and [[Shanghai]] food. Some people eat the European eel and other eels that live in lakes all around the world. A traditional [[London]] food is  " jellied eels. "  The [[Spain|Spanish]] meal, ''angulas'', consists of deep-[[Frying|fried]] elvers. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.buber.net/Basque/Food/food1.html|title= Basque food}} < /ref >

 Eel [[skin]]s are used to make some [[wallet]]s and [[purse]]s. 
 
 In some classifications, the family [[Cyematidae]] of [[bobtail snipe eel]]s is included in the Anguilliformes, but in the FishBase system that family is included in the order [[Saccopharyngiformes]]. 
 
 The [[electric eel]] of South America is not a true eel, but is a [[Gymnotiformes|South American knifefish]] more closely related to the [[carp]]s and [[siluriformes|catfishes]].
