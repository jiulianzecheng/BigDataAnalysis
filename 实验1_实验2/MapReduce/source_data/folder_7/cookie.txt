 A '''cookie''' is a sweet [[dessert]] made from [[flour]].  Cookies are made in an [[oven]]. They are also called [[wikt:biscuit|biscuits]] in many English-speaking countries. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], many varieties of biscuit are called cookies as well. 
 
 ==Description== 
 [[Image:Kourabiedes platter 2008 01 08.jpg|right|thumb|Greek kourabiades cookies.]] 
 Most cookies are flat and round like a disc.  Cookies often have [[flavor]]s added to them, like [[spice]]s, [[chocolate]], [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s or dried [[fruit]]s. Most cookies are very sweet. Today, many people think of cookies with warmth and love. Cookies may be used like chocolate and [[candy]] as a reward when children do good deeds. 
 
 Even though it is close to cakes and other sweetened [[bread]]s, cookies usually do not use water for [[cohesion]]. Water in cakes makes the base (in the case of cakes called  " batter " < ref > ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', Tenth Edition. Merriam-Webster, Inc.: 1999. < /ref > ) as [[thin]] as possible, which allows the bubbles to form better. Cookies do not have bubbles, so they do not need this. In cookies, some form of [[oil]] or [[fat]] is used for cohesion. Oils, like butter, [[egg (food)|egg]] yolks, [[vegetable oil]]s or [[lard]] are much more [[viscosity|viscous]] than water and [[evaporation|evaporate]] freely at a much higher [[temperature]] than water. So a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is more [[wikt:dense|dense]] when cooked. 
 
 ==History== 
 Cookies where made in [[Ancient Greece]] around 1200 BC. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.twinsdish.com/two-ancient-greek-christmas-cookie-recipes-that-melt-in-your-mouth/ | title=Ancient Greek Christmas Cookie Recipes Santa Most Likely Ate | date=22 December 2018 }} < /ref >  Hard [[wafer]]s have been made for as long as baking [[wikt:exist|existed]]. They were very popular because they last a long time and are not [[wikt:fragile|fragile]], but they were normally not [[Taste#Sweetness|sweet]] enough to be called cookies today. < ref > [http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html] ''Foodtimeline.org'' < /ref > 
 
 Cookies were made at first in 7th century AD [[Persia]], just after the use of [[sugar]] became common there. < ref > [http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm] ''Whatscookingamerica.net'' < /ref >  They spread to [[Europe]] through the [[Muslim]] [[Invasion|conquest]] of [[Spain]]. By the 14th century, they were common in all parts of Europe, and could be found anywhere from royal cuisine to street vendors. 
 
 People started to travel around the world at that time, and cookies made a good travel [[snack]]; a sweeter version of the travel cakes used throughout [[history]]. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled very well and became known on every [[continent]], was the jumble, a hard cookie made mostly from [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, sweetener, and [[water]].
