 ==i-wear== 
 'i-wear' (or 'e-wear') is ''intelligent'' clothing that joins [[fashion]] with [[technology]]. i-wear was born out of the collaboration between European fashion designers and computer technicians. i-wear is a step made towards technologizing a person's fashion, and in this sense, a person can be more as a part of technosexuality.
