'''Fasting''' is a kind of [[abstinence]]. It is when someone does not eat or drink for some specified period of time. It is only the case if the person does so of his or her own will. It may also be that the person only eats and drinks certain kinds of food. Most often, fasting is done for religious reasons. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid [[sexual intercourse]], (or any sexual desire), [[masturbation]], as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. [[meat]]).

 Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], in the [[Mahabharata]], in the [[Upanishads]], and in the [[Bible]], in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]].
