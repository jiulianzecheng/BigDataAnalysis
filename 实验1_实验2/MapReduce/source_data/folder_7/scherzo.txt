A '''Scherzo''' is a piece of music which is quite fast. In the 19th century [[Romantic music|Romantic]] composers started to write scherzos in their [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[sonata]]s instead of the traditional [[minuet]]s. They are similar to a minuet, always with three beats in a bar,  < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/527281/scherzo Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online: Scherzo] < /ref >  but they are faster and less  " polite " . Some composers like [[Frederic Chopin|Chopin]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote scherzos as separate pieces for the [[piano]].
