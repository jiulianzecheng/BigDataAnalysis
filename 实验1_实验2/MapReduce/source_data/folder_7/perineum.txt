 The '''Perineum''' is the area of the [[human body]] found between the lower end of the [[vagina]] and the [[anus]] (in [[female]]s); and the [[scrotum]] and the [[anus]] (in [[male]]s). When a person reaches [[puberty]], the size of the perineum is about one [[inch]] in length. During puberty, [[hair]] will grow around and on the perineum to protect it. 
 
 Inside the perineum-area are specialized muscles that perform functions of sexuality, erection and excretion.
