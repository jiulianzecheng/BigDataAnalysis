'''Californium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It is a [[radioactive]] [[metal]]. It has the chemical symbol '''Cf'''. It has the [[atomic number]] 98. Californium is a [[transuranium element]].  Californium does not have many uses. It was [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]] by [[bombardment|bombarding]] a [[curium]] [[wikt:target|target]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[ion]]s). Californium is named after the US State of California, where it was discovered, in the [[University of Berkeley]]. 
 
 Californium is produced in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s. < ref > Krebs, Robert 2006. ''The history and use of our Earth's chemical elements: a reference guide''. Greenwood, p327/8. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33438-2}} < /ref >   
 There are 20 known [[isotopes]]. The most stable is californium-251, which has a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in the [[Earth's crust]]. Californium-252, whose half-life is 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used. 
 
 Compounds of californium are mostly of californium(III), which can take part in three chemical bonds. Californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and is used as a source of [[neutrons]]. It can be used in making higher mass elements. [[Ununoctium]] was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 [[ions]]. 
 
 == Safety == 
 When californium is used, workers must be protected from the element's ability to disrupt the formation of [[red blood cells]].
