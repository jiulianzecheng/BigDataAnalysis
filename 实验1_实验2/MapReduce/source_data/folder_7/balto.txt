 '''Balto''' was the name of a [[Siberian Husky]], born in 1923 and died 1933. He was a [[sled dog]]. He was the back up for a dog named [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]. Balto took part in the [[1925 serum run to Nome]]. He got a lot of fame for being part of the journey, more than Togo. Many people say Togo should have gotten the attention that Balto got because Togo did the most work. [[Leonhard Seppala]] bred, named, raised, and trained Balto but did not race with him. In a 1927 New York Times article, he claimed that a forgotten dog named Fox had been co-lead with Balto on Kaasen’s team. He did not believe that Balto could have led the team by himself. [[Gunnar Kaasen]] was Balto’s musher. 
 
 In January 1925, [[Nome, Alaska]] needed medicine for a [[diphtheria]] epidemic. First, a [[ship]] tried to bring the medicine but [[ice]] was closing into the [[Bering Sea]]. The ship could not get to Nome. Next, they tried to bring the medicine by [[airplane]]. They could not because there was a [[blizzard]] (snow storm). The winds were too strong for the plane. So the medicine was sent by [[train]] from [[Anchorage, Alaska]] to [[Nenena, Alaska]]. Then [[sled dog]]s took turns carrying the medicine to Nome. The dog that ran the longest was [[Togo (dog)|Togo]]. Balto was the final dog. He lead the team into Nome. The medicine saved many children (almost all of the children). Balto, the other dogs, and the men who carried the medicine were given a hero's welcome. A few months later in [[New York City]], a statue of Balto was placed in [[Central Park]]. It is still there today. 
 
 == The serum run == 
 :{{Main|1925 serum run to Nome}} 
 In January 1925, [[Medical doctor|doctor]]s realized that a [[diphtheria]] [[epidemic]] was likely to sweep through Nome's young people. It could kill many people. The only serum that could stop it was in Anchorage. Anchorage was almost {{convert|1000|mi|km}} away. The only aircraft that could get the medicine to Nome was taken out of winter storage, but its [[engine]] was frozen. It would not start. [[Official]]s chose to move the medicine by sled dog. The serum was [[transportation|transported]] by train from Anchorage to Nenana. At Nenana, the first ''musher'' began the trip as part of a relay to deliver the serum to Nome. More than 20 mushers took part. They had to deal with a blizzard with {{convert|−53|F|C}} temperatures and strong winds. [[News]] coverage of the race was worldwide. 
 
 == After the events == 
 On December 22, 1995, [[Universal Pictures]] released the [[animation|animated]] [[movie]] ''Balto''. The movie was based on the events of the 1925 serum run, although there are big differences. They also made a 2nd and 3rd movies to the original. The 4th and final fan-made movie directed by Stefan Balugani.
