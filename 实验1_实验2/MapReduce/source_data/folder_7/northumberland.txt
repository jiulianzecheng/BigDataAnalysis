 '''Northumberland''' is the most northern county in [[England]]. [[Lindisfarne]] is an island close offshore. The county town is [[Morpeth]]. Its finest church is [[Hexham Abbey]]. Historically Northumberland occupies a small part of the former [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Northumberland is where [[Roman Britain|Roman]] occupiers once guarded a frontier at [[Hadrian's Wall]], [[Anglian]] invaders fought with [[Celt]]ic natives, and Norman lords built castles to suppress rebellion and defend a contested border with [[Scotland]].  
 
 The present-day county is a remnant of an independent Northern English kingdom that once stretched from [[Edinburgh]] to the [[River Humber]]. Reflecting its tumultuous past, Northumberland has more castles than any other county, < ref > Long B. 1967. ''Castles of Northumberland''. Newcastle: Harold Hill. < /ref >  and the greatest number of recognized [[battle]] sites. Once an economically important region that supplied much of the [[coal]] that powered the [[industrial revolution]], Northumberland is now a rural county with a small and gradually shrinking population. < ref > Dowson J. 2009.

 As the kingdom of Northumbria under Edwin (585â€“632), the region's boundaries stretched from the [[Humber]] in the south to the [[Firth of Forth]] in the north. The kingdom and county were named for the Humber. 
 
 The county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high [[moorland]], a favourite with [[landscape]] [[painter]]s, and now largely protected as a [[National park]]. Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England, with only 62 people per square kilometre. This is mainly because the large cities of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Tynemouth]] were joined to [[Gateshead]] and [[Sunderland]] in the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Tyne and Wear]].
