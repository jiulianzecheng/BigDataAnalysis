 '''Knitting''' creates flexible [[fabric]] by looping [[thread]] or [[yarn]] together using two or more knitting needles or a [[knitting machine]]. 
 
 == Types of knitting == 
 === Flat knitting === 
 Flat knitting, which is usually done on two straight needles, makes a length of cloth and is used to create things like [[blanket]]s, [[scarf|scarves]], and the backs, fronts, and sides of [[sweater]]s. 
 
 === Circular knitting === 
 {{main|circular knitting}} 
 Circular knitting, which is done on circular needles, or needles that have points on both ends, produces a seamless [[tube]] and is used to create things like [[hats]], [[sock]]s, [[mitten]]s, rings, and [[sleeve]]s. 
 
 === Cable knitting === 
 {{main|cable knitting}} 
 Patterns called ''cables'' are typically used on [[sweater]]s, particularly on [[Aran|fancy Aran]] sweaters from [[Ireland]]. 
 Different kinds of stitches create different patterns in knitting. For example, the stretchy ends of knitted sleeves are called ''ribbing''.

 === Yarn === 
 {{main|yarn}} 
 Yarn for knitting can be made from any number of natural or synthetic (man made) fibers such as [[wool]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], or [[acrylic]]. Some yarns are made from a blend of several kinds of fibers. 
 
 Yarns come in many thicknesses or ''weights'' from fine to thick: lace, fingering, sock, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, Aran, bulky, and super-bulky. Thinner yarns are generally used with smaller knitting needles, and thicker yarns are used with larger knitting needles. 
 
 === Needles === 
 Knitting needles come in various shapes: straight, double-pointed, cable, and circular. They can be made from [[bamboo]], [[aluminum]], [[steel]], or [[plastic]].
