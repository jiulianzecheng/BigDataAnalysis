 '''Jewels''' (or '''gems''' or '''gemstones''') are rare [[mineral]]s. They usually come in [[color|colour]]s and sizes. They begin in a rough rock form, but can be cut and polished to turn into a [[jewellery]]. 
 
 However, some other non-mineral [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s (such as [[lapis lazuli]]) or [[organic chemistry|organic]] materials can also be also used for jewelry and are called gemstones. These include [[amber]] or [[jet (lignite)|jet]]. [[Pearl]]s and [[coral]] are sometimes also called gemstones. 
 
 Most gemstones are [[hardness|hard]]. Soft minerals are used in jewelry too, because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] that gives them [[value]].  
 
 Being rare or in short supply also makes a gemstone valuable. 
 
 == History == 
 The [[Ancient Greek]]s began to decide which gems are '''precious''' and '''semi-precious'''. This continued in other cultures.  
 
 In modern times, the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious. < ref > {{cite book| last = Bauer| first = Max| title = Precious Stones: A Popular Account of Their Characters, Occurrence, and Applications, with an Introduction to Their Determination, for Mineralogists, Lapidaries, Jewellers, Etc.
