 A '''prefix''' is a part of a word or a word, within a word. It is put at the start of another word to make a different meaning. It can also mean a number that is put in at the start to show which number something is in a group. It is a type of [[affix]]. 
 compound nouns (in other cases also compound adjectives). 
   
 The following examples illustrate real prefixes. 
 
 Often people want to use a prefix to mean ''not''. There are many prefixes that mean ''not''. 
 * ''Un''natural means not natural. 
 * ''A''political means not political. 
 * ''Non''violent means not violent. 
 * ''In''direct means not direct 
 
 We also learnt the prefixes '''''anti''' which means '''against''''' and '''auto''' is used to mean '''''self''''' ''or '''own''''' 
 
 Some examples of these prefixes: 
 
 antisocial which means non social 
 
 anti glare which means it will prevent sun and light glare on a screen 
 
 autograph which means a person's signature 
 
 autopilot which means working by itself 
 
 Other examples of prefixes: 
 
 * ''bi''centennial (and other number related prefixes: mono, ter/tri, tetra, quadro, penta, hepta, octo, nano etc.)

 * ''en''compass 
 * ''para''trooper 
 * ''per''cent 
 * ''peri''scope 
 * ''proto''type 
 * ''poly''technical

 [[Scientist]]s and [[Medical doctor|doctors]] use prefixes in many words. 
 * ''Hepato-'' is a prefix that means [[liver]]. So ''hepatocellular'' means 'about liver [[cell]]s'. 
 * ''Hydro-'' is a prefix that means [[water]]. So ''Hydroelectric'' [[dam]]s are dams that make [[electricity]] from the flow of water. 
 * ''Pre-'' or ''Ante-'' are prefixes that mean before. Prenatal diagnostics is the [[diagnostic]]s done before the birth of a [[baby]]. 
 * ''Post-'' is a prefix that means after. Post-traumatic experience would be an experience that was made after trauma. 
   
 Sometimes people make up words by adding a prefix. These words are not in a [[dictionary]]. But if people use these words enough, sometimes they go into dictionaries. 
 For example, we can make the word ''unsimple'', which splits up into ''not simple''. This is not a word in a dictionary. 
 
 Compare to [[suffix]]. Suffixes are letters put at the end of a word to change its meaning.
