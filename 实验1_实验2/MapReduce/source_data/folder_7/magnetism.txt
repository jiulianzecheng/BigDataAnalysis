 {{Electromagnetism}} 
 
 '''Magnetism''' is a [[force]] that attracts (pulls closer) or repels (pushes away) objects that have a magnetic [[material]] like [[iron]] inside them (''magnetic objects''). In simpler words, it is a property of substances which pull closer or repel other objects. It is a subject in [[physics]]. 
 
 == Magnets == 
 Magnetism can be made by a permanent ''[[magnet]]'', or by [[electricity]] in a wire.  This is called an [[electromagnet]].  When magnets are put near magnetic objects, the magnet and the object are pulled toward each other.  This is called magnetic attraction.  Magnets can also repel (push away) other magnets.  Most objects that are attracted to magnets have [[iron]] in them. This is [[ferromagnetism]]. Some metals, such as [[aluminium|aluminium]], are much more weakly attracted. This is paramagnetism. A few metals are weakly repelled. This is diamagnetism.   
 
 === Magnetic fields === 
 Magnets have an unseen area around them called a  " [[magnetic field]] " . Magnetic objects inside this unseen field are attracted to the magnet. Magnetic things outside the magnetic field are not attracted to the magnet. This is why a magnet must be close to an object to attract it. 
 
 The poles of two magnets repel or attract each other. Different poles attract each other. For example, if the south pole of one magnet is put near the south pole of another magnet, the magnets will repel each other. This will also happen with two north poles that are put near each other. If a north pole is put near a south pole, the magnets will attract each other until they stick to each other and can be hard to pull apart. 
 
 === Magnetic domains === 
 Magnetism is caused by electrons (the negative particles in atoms that are also electric charges) spinning. The more a group of electrons spin in the same direction, the stronger the magnetic force. In a magnet, many electrons are spinning in the same direction. 
 
 We can magnetize a small piece of iron by 'rubbing' it with a magnet. The electrons in the iron get 'spun' by the passing magnet just like a basketball player spinning a basketball. 
 
 === Uses of magnets=== 
 Magnets have many uses. One of them was found long ago when [[explorer]]s found that a magnet could be used as a [[compass]] to show the direction of north  &  south. 
 
 == Electromagnets and electromagnetism== 
 [[Electromagnet]]s are another kind of magnet. They only work when [[electricity]] is running through them. An electric current makes a magnetic field. If you wrap the wire into a coil, the electrons spin around the coil and make a stronger magnetic domain. 
 
 Often, these magnets work by using a [[inductor|coil]] of [[wire]] that makes a magnetic field when there is a [[Electric current|current]] in it. In addition to this coil of wire, a large piece of metal, usually iron, is placed inside the coil to increase the magnetic field made. Though most large electromagnets employ many [[solenoid]]s to lift heavy objects, smaller solenoids are used in everyday [[electronics]]. For example, they are used to change [[voltage]] in a [[transformer]].  
 
 Electromagnets are used to make many things work like [[computer]]s, [[television]]s, [[radio]]s and doorbells. 
 
 == Electromagnetic waves == 
 [[Electromagnetic radiation]] including [[radio wave]]s and [[light wave]]s are used for [[communication]] including [[broadcasting]] and [[optical fiber]], and for many other purposes. 
 
 == Earth's magnetic poles == 
 === North magnetic pole === 
 The [[North Magnetic Pole]] is the point on the surface of Earth's [[northern hemisphere]] where the planet's magnetic field points vertically downwards. There is only one place where this occurs, near to (but distinct from) the [[Geographic North Pole]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Magnetic North Pole|url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819061122/http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html|archive-date=2013-08-19|work=Ocean bottom magnetology laboratory|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=1 June 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 Its [[southern hemisphere]] counterpart is the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Since the Earth's magnetic field is not exactly [[symmetrical]], a line drawn from one to the other does not pass through the geometric centre of the Earth. 
 
 The North Magnetic Pole moves over time due to magnetic changes in the [[Outer core|Earth's core]]. < ref name=Merrill > {{cite book|last1=Merrill|first1= Ronald T.|last2=McElhinny|first2=Michael W.|last3=McFadden|first3=Phillip L.|title=The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|url=https://archive.org/details/magneticfieldofe0000merr|publisher=Academic Pres]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5|chapter=Chapter 8}} < /ref >  In 2001, it was near [[Ellesmere Island]] in [[northern Canada]] at {{Coord|81.3|N|110.8|W|name=Magnetic North Pole 2001}}.

 === Reversals of Earth's magnetic field ===

 Earth does change its magnetic poles every million years (plus or minus 200,000 years). Before a change of magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field becomes weaker and moves around, like a spinning top would before it falls. The Earth has already had hundreds of changes (''flip flops''). Scientists know this as a result of studies of magnetism on the [[sea floor]], near the [[mid-Atlantic ridge]]. The [[lava]] slowly moves out of this [[crevasse]] (gap in the sea floor) and then it cools with its [[iron oxide]] [[molecule]]s all pointing in the new direction of the Earth's magnetic field. We can look at the history of this magnetic field today to look back at the many flips in the past. < ref > {{cite book |last=Vacquier |first=Victor |title=Geomagnetism in marine geology |year=1972 |publisher=Elsevier Science |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9780080870427 |page=38 |edition=2nd}} < /ref >   
 
 Reversals occur at intervals from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent [[geomagnetic reversal]], called the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], occurred about 780,000 years ago. < ref name= " inconstant " > {{cite news |url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield/ |title=Earth's inconstant magnetic field |work=Science@Nasa |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=27 December 2009 |archive-date=12 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312090720/http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=MMMch5 > {{harvnb|Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996|loc=Chapter 5}} < /ref >  Another global reversal of the Earth's field, called the [[Laschamp event]], occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).
