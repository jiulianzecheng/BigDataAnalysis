 '''Władziu (or Vladziu) Valentino Liberace''' (May 16, 1919  & ndash; February 4, 1987), best known as '''Liberace''', was an [[Americans|American]] [[pianist]] < ref > ''88 notes pour piano solo'', [[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], Neva Editions, 2015, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-2-3505-5192-0}} < /ref >  and [[vocalist]] of [[Polish American|Polish]]-[[Italian American|Italian]] origin. 
 
 Liberace's career lasted four decades. It included [[concert]]s, recordings, movies, television and [[endorsement]]s. During the 1950s–1970s he was the highest-paid entertainer in the world. < ref > Barker, 2009, p. 367. < /ref >  He lived a life of [[flamboyant]] excess both on and off the stage. 
 
 == Records == 
 The success of Liberace's [[syndicated]] [[television program]] made him a popular recording artist. From 1947-51, he released 10 [[album]]s. By 1954, it jumped to nearly 70. < ref name=pyron157 > Pyron, 2000, p. 157. < /ref >  He released several recordings through [[Columbia Records]], including ''Liberace by Candlelight''. He sold over 400,000 albums by 1954. His most popular single was  " Ave Maria " , selling over 300,000 copies. < ref name=pyron153 > Pyron, 2000, p. 153. < /ref > 
 
 His albums included popular songs at the time, such as  " Hello, Dolly! " . He also played his versions of [[classical music]] for the [[composer|composed]] by [[Chopin]] and [[Liszt]]. Many fans of classical music criticized them (and Liberace's skills as a pianist in general) for being  " pure fluff with minimal musicianship " . In his life, he received six gold records.
