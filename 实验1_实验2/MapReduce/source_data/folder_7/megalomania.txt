 '''Megalomania''' is a [[mental illness]].  People with megalomania have [[delusion]]al fantasies that they are more [[relevance|relevant]] (important) or [[Influence|powerful]] than they truly are.  They have inflated [[self esteem]] and overestimate their powers and beliefs. People with megalomania tend to exhibit a disposition that is less inclined towards humbleness..  
 
 The word  " megalomania "  is no longer used in the mental health field, and is not mentioned in either the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) or the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases]] (ICD).  Instead, this condition is now called [[narcissistic personality disorder]].  The condition affects both men and women.  
 
 The word  " megalomania "  comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words:  " μεγαλο "  (megalo-), meaning large or great, and  " μανία "  (mania), meaning madness or frenzy.
