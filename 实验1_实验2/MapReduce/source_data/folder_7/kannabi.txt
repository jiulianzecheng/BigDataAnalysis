 In Shinto, there is a concept known as Kannabi (神奈備), also referred to as kaminabi or kamunabi, which denotes a region that houses a [[kami]] or is itself a [[shintai]] (a repository in which a kami resides). These regions are typically [[forests]] or [[mountains]], < ref > https://archive.today/20230407173533/https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/?id=9690 < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > [[富士山|霊峰富士]]など。[[山岳信仰]]を参照 < /ref >  and examples include [[Mount Miwa]] < ref name= " :2 "  / >  and [[Nachi Falls]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Overview == 
 Kannabi can have sacred trees called [[shinboku]] or rocks called [[Iwakura]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Kannabi may also have [[shimenawa]], [[torii]] gates, and [[sandō]] which show the way to them. 
 
 
 Shrines that worship kannabi do not always have a honden or haiden like other shrines. Instead, they enshrine the natural kannabi as deities. One example is Ōmiwa Shrine. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  [[Kanasana Shrine|Kanasana Jinja]] is another shrine where the mountain itself is the shintai. < ref name= " :12 " > {{Cite web|title=Glossary of Shinto Names and Terms: K|url=https://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/glossary/def_K.html|access-date=2023-04-06|website=www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp}} < /ref >
