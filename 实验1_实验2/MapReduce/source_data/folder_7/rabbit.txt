 '''Rabbits''' are [[mammal]]s of the order [[Lagomorpha]]. There are about fifty different [[species]] of rabbits and [[hare]]s. The [[order (biology)|order]] [[Lagomorpha]] is made of rabbits, [[pika]]s and hares. Rabbits can be found in many parts of the [[world]]. < ref name=eircom > {{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~edrice/mammals/rabbit.htm|title=Irish Mammals – Rabbits|publisher=eircom.net|accessdate=2008-11-05}} < /ref >  They live in [[family|families]] and eat [[vegetable]]s and [[hay]]. In the wild, rabbits live in [[burrow]]s, that they dig themselves. A group of rabbits living together in a burrow is called a [[warren]]. Rabbits are famous for hopping and eating [[carrot]]s.  
 
 A [[male]] rabbit is called a '''buck''', and a [[female]] is called a '''doe'''. A [[baby]] rabbit is called a '''kit''', which is short for kitten. Rabbits have a [[gestation period]] of around 31 days. The female can have up to 12-13 kits, very rarely litters as big as 18 and as small as one. When the doe gives birth her babies are collectively referred to as a litter. Some people have rabbits as [[pet]]s.  Rabbits are also raised for their meat. Rabbits are of a different [[biological classification]] than hares.   
 
 Since rabbits are prey [[animal]]s, they are careful in open spaces. If they sense danger, they freeze and watch. Rabbit [[wikt:vision|vision]] has a very wide field, including overhead scanning. Their predators are [[Fox|foxes]], [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Coyote|coyotes]], [[Cougar|cougars]], [[lynx|lynxes]], [[Cat|cats]], [[Dog|dogs]], [[Bear|bears]], [[raccoon]]s, [[Skunk|skunks]], [[weasel]]s, [[Badger|badgers]], [[Snake|snakes]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]. People are also known to shoot rabbits, because they eat [[crops]]. Their escape method is to run for their burrow, where they are usually safe. 
 
 Rabbits have a [[wikt:complex|complex]] social structure and, like [[dog]]s, they have a [[hierarchy]]. Rabbit ears probably have several functions. The main function is to give warning of [[predators]], but they may be used for signalling, and [[temperature regulation]].

 == Rabbits as pets == 
 In the wild, rabbits have plenty to keep them occupied, from foraging to reproduction to territorial defence. Captive rabbits, < ref name= " DAD-IS 2017 " > {{cite web|title=Data export|url=http://www.fao.org/dad-is/dataexport/en/|website=DAD-IS (Domestic Animal Diversity Information System)|publisher=FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)|access-date=30 March 2018|date=21 November 2017}} < /ref >  on the other hand, often lack stimulation. This can lead to behavioural problems and poor health. [[Pet]] rabbits often live eight to twelve years. < ref > {{cite web|title=How long do rabbits live?|website=Blue Cross|url=https://www.bluecross.org.uk/advice/rabbit/wellbeing-and-care/how-long-do-rabbits-live|access-date=14 August 2023}} < /ref >
