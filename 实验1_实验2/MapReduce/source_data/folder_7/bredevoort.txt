 '''Bredevoort''' is a small village in the municipality of [[Aalten]], in the region of [[Achterhoek]] in the [[Netherlands]].  It is between the towns of Aalten and [[Winterswijk]]. About 1,600 people live there. 
 
 Today they name Bredevoort also ''Bredevoort boekenstad'' (''Bredevoort [[book town]]'').  There are now more than twenty [[second-hand]] book shops in the town. 
 
 ==History== 
 The name Bredevoort appears for the first time in 1188, when the earl of [[Steinfurt]] tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of [[MÃ¼nster]] and the earl of Lohn tried to sell his share to the earl of [[Gelderland]], a war broke out between the bishop and the earl of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1696 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership during the eighties years of war. In 1646, lightning hit the [[gunpowder]] tower of the [[castle of Bredevoort]], causing an explosion that destroyed the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. The former municipality of Bredevoort was comprised of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages [[Aalten]], [[Dinxperlo]] and [[Winterswijk]]. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its residents. In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten.
