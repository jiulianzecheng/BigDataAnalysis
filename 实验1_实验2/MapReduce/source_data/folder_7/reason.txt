{{wiktionary}} 
 '''Reason''' or reasoning is a way of [[thinking]] that uses [[logic]] and [[fact]]s.  People can use reason to decide what is [[true]] or [[good (philosophy)|best]].  It is different from obeying [[tradition]] or [[emotion]]s to decide what things are best or true.  In common [[English language|English]], it is using your head instead of your heart.   
 
 Reason has been an important part of [[philosophy]] since [[Ancient Greece]].  Many [[philosopher]]s have thought about what reason is, and how to think using reason ([[Logic]]). Also, they have thought if [[religion|religious]] thinking and [[faith]] are ways of reasoning, what we can know if we only use reason ([[Epistemology]]), and if [[animal]]s or [[computer]]s can think using reason.
