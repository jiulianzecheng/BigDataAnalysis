 '''Numantia''' (Spanish: ''Numancia'') was an ancient Celtiberian [[settlement]]. Its remains are located 7 km north of the city of [[Soria]], on a hill known as ''Cerro de la Muela'' in the municipality of Garray. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246523 |title=Places: 246523 (Numantia) |last=Keay, S., R. Mathisen, H. Sivan |publisher=Pleiades |access-date=April 30, 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 Numantia is famous for its role in the [[Celtiberian Wars]]. It was a city that became famous for its resistance against the Roman armies. 
 
 == History == 
 
 === Origins === 
 The first human settlements in Numantia were established in the III millennium BC. [[Shepherd|Shepherds]] who made seasonal movements with their flocks inhabited this area. The area had a harsh climate but the [[Pasture|pastures]] were rich. 
 
 Towards the 8th century BC., handmade ceramics were used in this [[Human settlement|settlement]]. From the 7th century BC., the settlement became a ''castro''. Around 350 BC., Numantia had many [[Population|inhabitants]] and was born as a city.  
 
 Roman authors don't agree on the people that lived there. [[Pliny the Elder]] believed it was the [[Pellendones]]. < ref > {{cite book |title=Natural History |title-link=Natural History (Pliny) |author=Pliny |author-link=Pliny the Elder}} < /ref >  However, other authors, like [[Strabo]] and [[Ptolemy]] say in their writings that the city belongs to the [[Arevaci]] people. 
 
 === Roman conquest === 
 In 153 BC, Numantia had its first serious [[conflict]] with [[Rome]]. 
 
 After 20 years of fighting, in 133 BC, the [[Roman Senate]] gave [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]] the task of destroying Numantia. 
 
 After 13 months of [[siege]], the Numantians decided to burn the city before surrendering. The few survivors were sold as [[Slavery|slaves]].  
 
 Numantia was rebuilt in the time of [[Augustus]]. It was repopulated with Celtiberians. 
 
 === Modern times === 
 Today, Numancia is an archaeological site in the province of Soria. 
 
 It was declared a ''Bien de Interés Cultural'' (Site of Cultural Interest) on the 29th August 1882. 
 
 This site is being excavated by a group of archaeologists from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] under the direction of Alfredo Jimeno. < ref > [https://ucm.academia.edu/AlfredoJimenoMart%C3%ADnez Alfredo Jimeno Martínez at Academia] < /ref >  It receives funds from the Junta de Castile and León. 
 
 Since 2007 there is a controversy as the Junta of Castile and León allowed the construction of industrial estate near the ruins. Several institutions have protested against that plan despite the statement from official authorities saying that the remains won't be damaged.
