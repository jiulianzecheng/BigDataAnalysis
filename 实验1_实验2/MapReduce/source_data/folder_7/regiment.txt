 A Regiment is a Military Unit, made up of a number of Battalions,under the Command of a Colonel or another officer. A modern regiment can also be similar to a Brigade, in that both can be from a few hundred soldiers to 5,000 soldiers (from 3 to 7 battalions). The modern regiment's size changes in number, purpose, and role from country to country (and might not exist in some [[military]] forces) and sometimes even within the military of the same nations. In the United States Army,a Regiment has a Headquarters Company (Or Headquarters Battery/Headquarters Troop) and several Companies assigned to it.
