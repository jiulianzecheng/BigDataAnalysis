 An '''Earl''' (or '''Jarl''') was a title for [[nobility]] used by [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Scandinavia]]ns. It originally meant  " [[chieftain]] "  and it referred especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it stopped being used in the [[Middle Ages]], whereas, in Britain, it became [[synonym]]ous with the continental [[count]]. 
 In Anglo-Saxon times the title was similar to that of [[Ealdorman]]. 
 
 Today, an earl is a member of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[peerage]], and is below a [[Marquess]], but above a [[Viscount]]. A British Earl is the same as a continental [[Count]]. Since there is no feminine form of '''Earl''', the wife of an Earl has the rank of [[Countess]] (the continental equivalent).
