 A '''quadriga''' is a [[vehicle]], with one [[axle|pole in the center]], that is pulled by four horses (or other animals). Unlike modern [[carriage]]s, the horses are all next to each other and none are in front of the others. The name is a contraction of ''quatuor'' ('four') and ''iugum'' ('joke'). Long ago, quadrigae were common in horse racing. Some [[Chariot|chariots]] were also quadrigae.
