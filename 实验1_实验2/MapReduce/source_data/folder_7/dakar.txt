 '''Dakar''' is the [[capital city]] of [[Senegal]]. It is on the [[country|country's]] [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast on the western edge of [[Africa]]. The city is a [[trade]] [[seaport]] for items leaving Africa. Dakar has a [[population]] of 1,030,594 people. The [[metropolitan area]] has about 2.45 million people living in it. 
 
 The [[National Assembly of Senegal]] and [[Senegal Presidential Palace]] are in Dakar. 
 
 == History == 
 
 The area that is now Dakar was first [[settler|settled]] around the [[15th century]]. In 1444, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] created a [[colony]] there. By 1536, the colony was being used to as part of the [[slave trade]]. Between 1588 and 1677, the area was fought over by many countries. During this time it was under the control of the Portuguese, [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[England|English]], and finally the [[France|French]]. 
 
 In 1857, the French built a [[military]] base here. This base was called Dakar. It was made the capital of [[French West Africa]] in 1902. Dakar was one of the major cities of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] during this time. It was very important in terms of trade, military, and [[communication]]s to the empire until [[World War II]]. 
 
 The city was the capital of the [[Mali Federation]] from [[1959]] to [[1960]]. It then became the capital of Senegal.
