 '''''Marshosaurus''''' is a [[genus]] of medium-sized [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. It was from the [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] of [[Utah]] and perhaps [[Colorado]]. This carnivore operated in the same territory as the larger and more famous ''[[Allosaurus]]''. It was about 4.5 metres long and weighed 200 kg. < ref > {{cite book|last=Paul|first=Gregory S.|date=2010|title=The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs|url=https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu00paul_514|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/princetonfieldgu00paul_514/page/n91 91]|isbn=9780691137209 }} < /ref > 
 
 The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow [[sea]] and [[river delta]] [[sediments]] between 156.3 million years ago at its base, to 146.8 mya at the top. That puts it in the later Jurassic period. The area would have been rather dry, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from [[New Mexico]] to [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. It was formed when the early [[Rocky Mountains]] started pushing up in the west. The deposits from their east-facing [[drainage basin]]s were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in [[swamp]]y lowlands, lakes, river channels and [[floodplain]]s. This formation is similar in age to the [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen Limestone Formation]] in [[Germany]] and the Tendaguru Formation in [[Tanzania]]. In 1877 this formation became the center of the [[Bone Wars]], a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] and [[Edward Drinker Cope]].
