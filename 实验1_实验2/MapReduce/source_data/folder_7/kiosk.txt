 In [[English language|English]] speaking countries, a '''kiosk''' is a small booth offering goods and services. For example, it might sell packaged food, drinks, cigarettes and newspapers. They can still be seen on some train stations. 
 
 In [[Paris]] the old kiosks which sold newspapers, cigarettes and tickets are being replaced. The replacements are said to be more functional but less charming. < ref > Les anciens kiosques parisiens seront bien remplacés [https://www.liberation.fr/france/2016/07/10/les-anciens-kiosques-parisiens-seront-bien-remplaces_1465269] < /ref > 
 
 In oriental countries like [[Persia]] or [[Turkey]], a kiosk is larger and grander than in other countries. It is a self-standing building.
