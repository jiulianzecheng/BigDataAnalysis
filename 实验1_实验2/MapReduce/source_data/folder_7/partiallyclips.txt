 '''''PartiallyClips''''' is a [[webcomic|comic published on the internet]] that was created by [[Rob Balder]] and ran from 2002 to 2015. At the start of 2010, Balder gave authorship of the comic to [[Timothy F. Crist|Tim Crist]], the comedy musician behind [[Worm Quartet]]. 
 
 == Premise == 
 ''PartiallyClips'' is a [[Constrained comics|constrained comic]]. Each three-panel strip consists of the same [[clip art]] image (the comic has no original art) in each panel for the whole strip, with added [[speech balloon]]s and/or captions to create the joke. 
 
 ''PartiallyClips'' frequently tends to use [[dark humor]] because the picture used shows peace, which is common in public-domain clip art, but the added dialogue or captions make it instead not show peace. ''PartiallyClips'' also frequently comments on modern life and culture, especially aspects of Internet culture. No characters or plots often repeat. 
 
 Its name is a [[mondegreen|derivation from a misinterpreted phrase that results from a mishearing of the name]] because  " Partially Clips "  sounds similar to  " Partial [[eclipse]] " . 
 
 == Distribution and reception ==
