 A '''flageolet''' is an old [[woodwind instrument]].  It belongs to the end-blown flute family.  It started to be used in the [[16th century]] for [[folk music]].  There are two types: the [[France|French]] type and the [[England|English]] type.    The French flageolet had four holes in the front and two in the back.  The English flageolet had six holes in the front. 
 
 The flageolet is quite similar to the [[recorder]]. In the [[18th century]] it changed because a narrow mouthpiece made of [[ivory]] or [[bone]] was added at the top.  This led into another section which bulged out.  There was a soft sponge at the end of this.  Sometimes this instrument was called the  " flautino " .  The [[piccolo]] developed from it.  Another instrument that developed from it was the [[tin whistle]]. 
 
 [[Henry Purcell]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] both wrote pieces for it. 
 
 Small versions of this instrument, called bird flageolets were also made and were used for teaching [[birds]] to sing.
