 A '''beehive''' is a structure in which some [[species]] of [[honey bee]]s ([[genus]] ''Apis'') live and raise their young.  Natural beehives (or  " nests " ) are made by honey bee [[colony|colonies]], while [[domestication|domesticated]] honey bees are kept in [[man-made]] beehives in a location known as an [[apiary]]. The beehives made by people are usually the things referred to by the word  " beehive. " 
 
 Beehives have [[hexagon]]al cells in them, packed together. This is called a [[honeycomb]].
