[[File:Achnanthes exigua.jpeg|thumb|right|Different [[Diatom]] [[species]] have hard shells with many different [[shape]]s and [[pattern]]s. The shells stay even after they die, and are useful in palynology.]] 
 Palynology is the study of very small natural [[particle]]s. The word literally means the  " study of dust " . A palynologist is someone whose job is to identify what the particles are. Samples of particles can come from the air or water or [[soil]] or rocks. They could be [[Organic matter|organic]] and inorganic. [[Micropaleontology]] is a related area of study; it involves very small [[fossil]]s. 
 
 ==Methods== 
 A palynologist uses a [[microscope]]. They may also use [[Chemistry|chemical tests]] to find out what a particle is made of. 
 
 The methods used to study fossils in micropaleontology and in palynology are often different. Micropaleontology often involves breaking and dissolving rocks. Palynology often involves soil or [[sediment]]. 
 
 The main work of a palynologist is to identify each particle. Many different kinds of particles might be in the same sample. They may include: 
 * clay 
 * pollen 
 * algae with hard shells such as [[Diatoms]], [[Dinoflagellates]], [[golden algae]] 
 * spores from plants, fungi, or bacteria 
 * small [[seed]]s 
 * pieces of larger [[organism]]s 
 * tiny fossils 
 
 ==Uses==

 When the palynologist knows what particles are present in a sample, they may be able to say what the [[temperature]] or [[environmental chemistry]] was like where the sample came from. They may also be able to say where the sample came from. 
 
 Palynology is used in [[forensic science]] to learn where something came from, by looking at the particles in or on it. 
 
 Palynology is also very important in the study of [[climate]] [[history]]. In bodies of water such as [[lake]]s, [[pond]]s, and the [[ocean]], sediment builds up slowly, so that the oldest sediment is at the bottom. There are ways to take a sample of the sediment that doesn't disturb the layers (either using a tube, or by freezing). 
 
 In [[glacial lake]]s, the sediment may have [[varve]]s, which are two layers per year that are different colours. If there are varves, a lot of detailed information can be discovered in a core sample.
