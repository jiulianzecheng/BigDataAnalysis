 The '''nipple''' is a special [[structure]]. Female mammals (and women) use nipples for [[breastfeeding]]. The [[breast]] in male and female mammals is made the same way. The production of [[milk]] for breastfeeding is controlled by [[hormone]]s. This means that men cannot use their breasts to produce milk (unless they have a problem with their hormones).
