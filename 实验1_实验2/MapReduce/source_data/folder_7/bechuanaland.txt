 '''Bechuanaland''' was a federation of Tswana lands stretching from the territory of the Bangwato in present day [[Botswana]] to the Batlhaping area around present day [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], South  Africa. The area included  large parts of what is now the [[North West (South African province)|North West]] and [[Northern Cape]] provinces of South Africa. 
 
 Bechuanaland was declared a British [[protectorate]], in 1885, and subsequently divided the territory along the Molopo River. 
 
 The areas to the South of the [[Molopo]] became British Bechuanaland and would later be handed over to the [[Cape Colony]], which in 1910 was part of the two British colonies, Cape Colony and Natal, which united with the [[Boer|Boer republic]]'s [[Transvaal|Transvaa]] < nowiki/ > l and [[Orange Free State]] to form the Union of South Africa. 
 
 The territory of modern-day [[Botswana]], North of Molopo became Bechuanaland Protectorate until independence in 1966. 
 
 [[Great Britain]] offered protection against the Boer Republics after the Boers invaded Bechuanaland in the early 1880s establishing [[Stellaland]] and Goshen within Bechuanaland around present day [[Vryburg]], South Africa. 
 
 The Christian missionary John MacKenzie of the [[London Missionary Society]] convinced Bangwato ruler Khama III and other [[Tswana language|Tswana]] rulers to seek Protectorate status and the Warren Expedition was dispatched from the Cape in 1885 to remove the Boers from Stellaland and Goshen and proclaim Bechuanaland a British Protectorate. 
 
 It had a [[territory]] of approximately {{convert|582000|km2}}. 
 
 After the British divided Bechuanaland into two, the [[Capital city|capital]] of Bechuanaland Protectorate now fell outside its territory: It was the modern-day city of [[Mahikeng]], then called Mafeking, in [[South Africa]].
