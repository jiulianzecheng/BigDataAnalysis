[[File:Bimetallic_stripe.svg|thumb|300x300px|Metal 1 expands more with higher temperature than Metal 2. Connecti them together and heating forces the bimetal to bend.]] 
 '''Bimetal''' means two different [[metal]]s joined together. Instead of being a [[Mixture|mix]] of two or more metals, like [[alloy]]s, bimetallic objects are made of layers of different metals. 
 
 Bimetallic strips move when they are heated up. They are the most common bimetallic objects. They are often used in electric kettles as a temperature switch.
