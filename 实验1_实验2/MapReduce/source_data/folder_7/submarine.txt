 A '''submarine''' (or '''sub''') is a [[vessel]] that goes [[underwater]]. Most large submarines are [[warship|war vessels]]. Some small ones are used for [[science|scientific]] or [[business]] purposes. These are often called  " submersibles "  and cannot go far or stay long away from base. Some people buy their own to [[exploration|explore]] under the [[sea]]. A submarine is a [[boat]], not a [[ship]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Early submarines were often powered by hand. This is because boat [[engine]]s had not been [[invention|invented]] yet. They were almost always made for war. Submarines would try to sink enemy ships by crude methods. These included [[drill]]ing [[screw]]s into their [[wood]]en [[hull]]s. Some tried to [[explosion|blow up]] a ship. This often destroyed the submarine, too.  At the end of the 19th century, the Whitehead [[torpedo]] and electrical systems allowed much better submarines. 
 
 These better submarines were much used during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]]. Many of these better submarines were created by [[Germany]], called [[U-boat]]s. The submarines were powered by a [[diesel-electric]] system. A diesel motor would be used to turn a [[generator]]. The generator would charge a large [[battery]] while the submarine was on the surface. The power in the battery was then used by the submarine when it went underwater. These submarines were dangerous to enemies. They were difficult to see while underwater but it was easy to [[attack]] them when they surfaced to recharge.  Many modern boats still use this diesel-electric propulsion system. 
 
 The [[First Battle of the Atlantic]] was the first major battle that was mainly fought between submarines and their enemies. As in later wars, the main jobs of submarines were to enforce a [[blockade]] and to sink enemy [[warship]]s. They usually attacked [[freighter]]s at night, shooting with their [[deck gun]]s and then hiding under the water. Sometimes they used their [[torpedo]]es, which they could fire while underwater, especially against larger ships and [[warship]]s. During World War II The US Navy lost around 52 submarines due to combat and non-combat causes.  
 
 After World War II better [[sonar]] helped the enemies of submarines to find and destroy them. New subs were more streamlined and had no [[deck gun]]s because water [[drag]]ging against the guns made noise underwater and slowed the subs. 
 
 == Modern submarines == 
 Most large modern [[military]] submarines are powered by [[nuclear reactor]]s. These submarines often have a system which can get air from the [[seawater]]. These two things allow them to stay underwater for long periods of time. Their most important uses are attacking ships or launching [[missile]]s. These include [[cruise missile]]s and [[nuclear missile]]s. There are two main kinds of subs. [[Attack submarine]]s are small and fast. They attack other subs and surface ships with [[torpedo]]s. [[Ballistic missile submarine|Missile subs]] are larger and slower. They are built to shoot missiles at far-away targets on land.
