 '''Elaphrosaurus''' is a [[genus]] of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived during the [[Upper Jurassic]] period, about 150 million years ago. It was 15 feet long, and weighed 450 pounds.  
 
 ''Elaphrosaurus'' was a slender, fast, and agile predator that probably preyed on small ornithopods, such as ''[[Dryosaurus]]''.  
 
 The type specimen was found in the [[Tendaguru Formation]] in [[Tanzania]]. It was a nearly complete skeleton, but unfortunately, it lacked a skull. Since its body was similar to [[ornithomimids]], it was originally thought to be the earliest ornithomimid. However, later studies showed that it is actually a [[ceratosaur]]. There is one named species, ''Elaphrosaurus bambergi''. Remains very similar to it have also been found in the [[Morrison Formation]] in the western [[United States]]. These may possibly belong to ''Elaphrosaurus'', indicating that this dinosaur had a wider range than previously thought.
