'''Deconstruction''' is a way of understanding how something was created, usually things like [[art]], [[book]]s, [[poem]]s and other [[writing]]. Deconstruction is breaking something down into smaller parts. Deconstruction looks at the smaller parts that were used to create an object. The smaller parts are usually [[Idea|ideas]].  
 
 Sometimes deconstruction looks at how an author can imply things he does not mean. It says that because words are not precise, we can never know what an author meant. 
 
 Sometimes deconstruction looks at the things the author did not say because he made [[Assumption|assumptions]].  
 
 One thing it pays attention to is how opposites work. (It calls them  " binary oppositions. " ) It says that two opposites like  " good "  and  " bad "  are not really different things.  " Good "  only makes sense when someone compares it to  " bad, "  and  " bad "  only makes sense when someone compares it to  " good. "  And so even when someone talks about  " good, "  they are still talking about  " bad. "  But this is just one thing it does. 
 
 Because of things like this, deconstruction argues that books and poems never just mean what we think they mean at first. Other meanings are always there too, and the book or poem works because all of those meanings work together. The closer we look at the writing, the more we find about how it works, and how meaning works for all things. If we deconstructed everything, we might never be able to talk or write at all. But that does not mean deconstruction is useless. If we deconstruct some things, we can learn more about them and about how talking and writing work. 
 
 == Slippery Words == 
 Words are made up of 'signifiers', or the sounds/spellings, and the 'signified', or the meaning and concepts they are talking about. However, the meaning of a word is naturally unclear; the word in itself and the meaning are not naturally linked. The word 'band' can refer to an elastic band, a pop music group, a gathering of brass musicians or a collection of people, each with different meanings and mental images. This means it is the reader who will choose the meanings of words. In a similar way, reading is like trying to hold a wet fish, because there are different meanings to each word. [[Jacques Derrida]] calls this  " slippage along the chain of signifiers. "   
 
 The chain of signifiers is a long chain of words that are connected to each other, for example a chain might look like this:  " band, brass, copper, police. "  This chain really has no end, because each word connects to many others, and the more slippery a word, the more words it relates to. 
 
 == Important people == 
 Deconstructionists question language and meaning. Some people who were very close to [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] are usually called deconstructionists. These people include [[Helene Cixous]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]. If someone really deconstructed everything, they could not talk or think! Instead there are people who deconstruct things (books, poems, writing, words - in short, texts). [[Jacques Derrida]] began deconstructing things in the [[1960s]], but he was not the first. [[Martin Heidegger]] had talked about deconstruction in [[1927]] with ''[[Being and Time]]'' but he used the word  " destruktion " . Heidegger might even say that he got the idea from Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Other important people who talked about it include [[Paul de Man]] and [[Judith Butler]].
