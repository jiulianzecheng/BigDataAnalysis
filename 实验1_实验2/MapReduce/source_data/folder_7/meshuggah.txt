 Thordendal was working as a [[carpenter]]. He cut off the tip of his left middle finger in an [[accident]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Haake also hurt his hand in an accident.

They released it in 1995 because of the injuries.

 [[File:Meshuggah Hagström (right) Thordendal (left) 2008 Prague.jpg|thumb|Fredrik Thordendal (left) and Mårten Hagström (right).]] 
 In January 1995, Meshuggah went on a European [[Concert|concert tour]]. After the tour, the band made ''[[Destroy Erase Improve]]''. This was their second album. After making the album, the band went on another European tour with [[Machine Head]]. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  During the tour, Nordin had [[Equilibrioception|balance]] problems because of his [[inner ear]]. This made him very [[Dizziness|dizzy]]. Because of it, Nordin went back to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist, Adam Duce, offered to play bass for Meshuggah when Nordin was gone. The band did not want him to. They kept playing music with only four members. Hagström used a [[Pitch (music)|pitch shifter]] for the rest of the tour to make his guitar sound lower. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 The album was released in May 1995. Critics liked the album. One said that the album was the  " work of highly skilled men with powerful instruments " . < ref > {{Citation|title=Meshuggah - Destroy Erase Improve Album Reviews, Songs  &  More {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/destroy-erase-improve-mw0000174601|language=en|access-date=2022-11-03}} < /ref >

 The band has a unique way of playing metal music. They use many complex music styles, such as playing with [[Polyrhythm|polyrhythms]], [[Meter (poetry)|polymeters]], and changing [[Key (music)|key]] and [[tempo]]. This makes the music very difficult to play. Hagström has said that  " it doesn't really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?
