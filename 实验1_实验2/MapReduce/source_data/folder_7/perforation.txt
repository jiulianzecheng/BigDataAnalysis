 '''Perforation''' means lines of punching holes made in any material. It is used in making paper objects like [[Postage stamp|stamp]]s or tickets, and along the edges of [[movie]]s. 
 
 In [[philately]], there are three types of the cutting of [[postage stamps]] for stamp separation, including: 
 # ''Perforation'', or cutting rows and columns of small holes. 
 # ''Rouletting'', or small horizontal and vertical cuts. 
 # ''Diecutting'', or cutting paper to shape using a metal die (used for self-adhesive stamps).
