 An '''ogre''' is [[fiction|fictional]] monster. A [[female]] ogre is called '''ogress'''. Most stories say ogres eat humans, including small children and babies. The word originally comes from French: [[Charles Perrault]] mentioned an Ogre in his [[fairy tale]], [[Little thumbling]], published in 1697. In that story, the word has also been translated as [[giant]].
