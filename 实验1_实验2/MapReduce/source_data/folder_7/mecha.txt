'''Mecha''' (also known as '''meka''' or '''mechs''') are walking [[vehicle]]s often shown in [[science fiction]]. Stories about mecha often focus on mecha fighting other mecha, or fighting against monsters or aliens. Some stories, such as the [[Manga]] [[Patlabor]] and [[United States|American]] miniatures game [[Battletech]], also show mecha doing [[civilian]] purposes such as heavy [[construction work]], [[police]] topics, or [[firefighting]].
