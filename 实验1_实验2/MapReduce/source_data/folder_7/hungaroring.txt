 == Description == 
 [[Image:René Rast and Jeroen Bleekemolen Hungaroring 2009.jpg|200px|left]] 
 The Hungaroring is a circuit in the Formula One Grands Prix calendar. The F1 race is normally held in the middle of a [[Central Europe]]an summer. The circuit is generally dusty, which limits traction. This is because the track is not used very much throughout the season and it is built on sandy soil. The track is built in a natural valley. About 80 percent of the racetrack is visible from any viewing location. < ref > {{cite web|title=Welcome|work=Hungaroring Sport Plc.|url=http://hungaroring.hu/en/|accessdate=2008-02-25}} < /ref > 
 
 The Hungaroring is a twisty style circuit, < ref > {{cite news|title=Formula One: Think it's a joyride?

 Most of the foreign fans are from [[Germany]] < ref name= " AmCham " / >  and [[Austria]]. The Hungaroring has traditionally seen a large number of [[Finland|Finnish]] fans as well. With the loss of the [[Austrian Grand Prix]], this is the closest Formula One event for fans from other Central European countries. The {{F1|2006}} race saw many spectators from [[Poland]] due to the debut of the first Polish Formula One driver, [[Robert Kubica]]. 
 
 The Hungarian Grand Prix has always been more of a promotional event than a profit raising event. < ref name= " AmCham " / >  The Formula One contract was extended until 2016. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/UK_MOTORSPORT/idUKL310055920080803 |title=Motor racing-Hungarian GP gets extension to 2016 |last=Ledsom |first=Mark |author2=Ken Ferris |date= 2008-08-03 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}} < /ref >  Tobacco advertising has been banned since 2007.
