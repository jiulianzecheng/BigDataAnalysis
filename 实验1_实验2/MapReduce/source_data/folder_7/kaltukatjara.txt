 '''Kaltukatjara''' (''{{lang|pjt|Kaḻṯukatjara}}'') is a town in the southwest of the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]. It is also called '''Docker River''' in English. It is about 670 & nbsp;km southwest of [[Alice Springs]], and 8 & nbsp;km from the border with [[Western Australia]]. < ref name= " macshire " / > < ref name= " horton " / >  In the 2006 [[census]], Kaltukatjara had a population of 355. < ref name= " Census2006Y " / >  All of the residents are either [[Pitjantjatjara]], [[Ngaatjatjarra]] or [[Ngaanyatjarra]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] people. < ref name= " gpnnt " / > 
 
 ==Overview== 
 Kaltukatjara is located on the western bank of an [[Wadi|ephemeral watercourse]] called Docker River. It is surrounded by the [[Petermann Ranges]]. < ref name= " horton " / >  From the town, the [[Great Central Road]] leads eastward to [[Yulara]] (196 & nbsp;km) and westward to [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]] (288 & nbsp;km). 
 
 While the roads in the town are sealed, roads out of the town are [[gravel]] and can be closed for up to a week if it rains. There is an [[Airport|air strip]] about 4 & nbsp;km north of the town. Power is supplied by three large [[Electrical generator|generators]]. The water supply is pumped from two underground [[Well|bores]] which are about 5 & nbsp;km from the town. Facilities in Kaltukatjara includes both a primary and secondary school, a health clinic, community store, and an old people's home. < ref name= " macshire " / >  There is also a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[church]]. < ref name= " gpnnt " / > 
 
 ==History== 
 Kaltukatjara was originally established as an [[outstation]] in 1968. < ref name= " cane " / >  It was established so that the Aboriginal people living in [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] such as [[Areyonga, Northern Territory|Areyonga]] could live closer to their [[homeland]]s. < ref name= " horton " / > < ref name= " gpnnt " / >  It was also to encourage people to move out of the [[Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park|Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park]]. < ref name= " chatty " / >  The settlement was named  " Docker River "  after the [[stream]] that flows through the community. This stream was given its name by the explorer [[Ernest Giles]] when he travelled through the area in 1872. < ref name= " macshire " / > 
 
 In 1976, the [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia#Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976|Aboriginal Land Rights Act]] was passed in the Northern Territory. The Kaltukatjara community was given [[freehold title]] over a large block of land in the Territory's southwest corner (see [[Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust]]). This allowed families living at Kaltukatjara to spread out over the surrounding country and set up smaller camps on their own ancestral homelands. This movement was part of a larger trend called the  " [[outstation movement]] " . The first two outstations established were Tjuntinanta and Punritjanta. By the end of 1978, a total of 11 outstations had been established. There were 16 by the end of 1981. < ref name= " cane " / > 
 
 ===Cultural history=== 
 The area in which Kaltukatjara is located is known as ''{{lang|pjt|Kikingkura}}''. < ref name= " layton " / > {{#tag:ref|Also spelled ''{{lang|pjt|Kikingura}}'', ''{{lang|pjt|Kikingurra}}'' or ''{{lang|pjt|Kikinkura}}''. < ref name= " layton " / > |name= " kikingkura " |group= " note " }} It contains several old [[sacred site]]s associated with the {{lang|pjt|Wintalyka Tjukurpa}} (Mulga Seed Dreaming). < ref name= " horton " / > < ref name= " harney " / >  Part of this [[Tjukurpa]], which is restricted to men, extends east through [[Uluṟu]], where the Wintalyka men became involved in a [[feud]] with the [[Rufous hare-wallaby|Mala]] people. < ref name= " tonkinson " / >  According to the legend, the Mala had travelled from the north to perform [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] at Uluṟu with a sacred [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]. On learning of this artefact, the Wintalyka men invited the Mala men to attend ceremonies at Kikingkura, but the Mala refused. Feeling insulted, the Wintalyka decided to punish the Mala by [[wikt:conjur|conjuring]] an [[Devil|evil spirit]] to [[wikt:haunt|haunt]] them. < ref name= " crispin " / >  At Pulpaiyala, a [[soakage]] close to what is now Kaltukatjara, < ref name= " layton " / >  they conjured ''{{lang|pjt|kurpany}}'', a great and terrifying spirit resembling a [[dingo]].{{#tag:ref|The name of the spirit has also been known as ''{{lang|pjt|kurrpannga}}'', ''{{lang|pjt|kurrpanngu}}'', ''{{lang|pjt|kulpunya}}'' or ''{{lang|pjt|kuapunn}}''.|name= " kurpany " |group= " note " }} Kurpany chased the Mala men from Uluṟu and off across the desert to the south. < ref name= " tonkinson " / > < ref name= " mit " / > 
 
 ==Outstations== 
 Kaltukatjara is governed by Kaḻṯukatjara Community Council, a [[local government]] council with 12 members. < ref name= " gpnnt " / >  The community also serves about 30 [[outstation]]s, most of which are not permanently occupied. They are spread over a large area around the Petermann Ranges. < ref name= " planhealth " / >  Only two outstations are funded by the council: Tjauwata, about 5 & nbsp;km to the east, and Kunapula, about 46 & nbsp;km southeast. < ref name= " macshire " / >  Most of the outstations on the eastern side of the border are owned by Pitjantjatjara families. Those in Western Australia are mostly owned by Ngaanyatjarra people. < ref name= " cane " / >
