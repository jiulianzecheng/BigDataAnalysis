'''Snoopy''' is [[Charlie Brown]]'s pet [[beagle]] in the comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]'', by [[Charles M. Schulz]]. < ref > http://www.peanuts.com/ < /ref >   Born on the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm, Snoopy started out in the background.  Eventually he stood on his hind legs and became a main character.  Snoopy has many alter egos, and many siblings. 
 
 Snoopy's house looks small from the outside, but the inside is much bigger, like the Tardis from [[Doctor Who]].  He has many things in his house, including a TV set, Van Gogh painting, pool table, cedar closet, and many other things.  It has been destroyed multiple times, including being burnt down, destroyed by a falling icicle, and being smashed by the violent cat who lives next door.
