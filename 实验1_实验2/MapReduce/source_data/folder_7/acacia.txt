 '''''Acacia''''' is a genus of [[shrub]] or [[tree]] are belonging to the subfamily [[Mimosoideae]] of the family [[Fabaceae]], first described in [[Africa]] by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian Acacias are not.  
 
 == Defences == 
 Acacias are heavily defended against herbivores. Different species have different combinations of defenses: 
 # Thorns (except [[Australia]]) 
 # Chemicals: bitter [[tannin]]s and [[psychoactive]] [[alkaloid]]s are common in Acacias. Some species have up to 40% tannins in their bark < ref name= " pfaf " > [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Acacia+dealbata Plants for a Future Database] < /ref > 
 # Ants: in Africa and Central Americs, [[symbiosis]] with ants can deter all sizes of enemy, from elephants to [[caterpillar]]s and stem-boring [[beetle]]s. < ref >

 < /ref >   Some species of ants will also fight off competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plant's leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing it. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts. 
 
 Products from the acacia plants have often been used for medicinal purposes. 
 
 == Gum arabic == 
 Various species of acacia yield gum. True [[gum arabic]] is the product of ''[[Acacia senegal]]'', abundant in dry tropical West Africa from [[Senegal]] to northern [[Nigeria]]. 
 
 ''[[Acacia arabica]]'' is the gum-Arabic tree of [[India]], but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic. 
 
 == The Whistling Thorn (Acacia drepanolobium) == 
 This species of acacia grows two kinds of thorns. The main defense is provided by pairs 5cm long arranged nearly at a right angle. Smaller stipular spines grow between the pairs of big thorns. These emerge from hollow galls, bulbous swellings 2 to 3cm across. One of four different species of ant lives in each of these igloos, which they open up by cutting holes into them. A dying bush whistles as the wind blows over these entrances. Most acacias make toxins that rush to leaves that are under attack by browsers. The whistling thorn does not. It is infested with stinging ants that swarm out and prepare to bite anything they can when the branch is disturbed. Most browsers seem to avoid infested bushes, perhaps because the ants stink of formic acid.
