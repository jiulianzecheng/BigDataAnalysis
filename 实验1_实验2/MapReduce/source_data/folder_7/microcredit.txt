Microcredits were created to support [[entrepreneurship]], and to lessen [[poverty]]. Very often, people getting a microcredit are [[illiterate]]: they cannot fill out forms to apply for a regular loan. Microcredits also work differently: the interest ot be paid is usually much higher than with a regular loan, often it is over 20%. The interest usually also has to be paid more often. Microcredits have been criticized, because people taking them often end up in a situation where they cannot repay their [[debt]].
