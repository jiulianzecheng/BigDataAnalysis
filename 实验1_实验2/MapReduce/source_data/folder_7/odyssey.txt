 == Story  == 
 It is the story of the return of Ulysses after the Trojan War (Iliad) 
 
 === The Cyclops ===

 On his journey home, [[Odysseus]] lands on the island of the [[Cyclops]] '''[[Polyphemus]]'''.  They go inside his cave at the sight of sheep, cheese and milk.  Polyphemus catches them and eats some of Odysseus' men.  Odysseus tricks and blinds him and they escape.  The Cyclops prays to his father [[Poseidon]] that Odysseus would not get home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home, Odysseus would lose all of his men, his ship and find trouble at home.  This prayer becomes the plot line of the Odyssey. 
 
 === The Sirens ===

 [[Odysseus]] and his ship have to pass the '''[[Siren|Sirens']]''' island. The Sirens were always singing very beautifully, so [[sailors]] would try to go to them, but their ships would get destroyed, and they would die. 
 Odysseus tells his men to put [[wax]] in their [[ear]]s, so they will not hear the song of the sirens. He also tells his men to bind him to the ship's mast, so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song. His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore, because he is calm again. Then they can take the wax out of their ears, and free Odysseus. 
 
 === Calypso ===

 After escaping from the sea, and the death of his men, [[Odysseus]] comes to the island [[Ogygia]]. On this island lives the [[nymph]] '''[[Calypso]]''', and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years. But then the god [[Hermes]] came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go. Calypso promised Odysseus [[immortality]] (that he would live forever) if he stayed, but he wanted to go back to his wife [[Penelope]]. So Odysseus built a [[raft]] and left her. 
 
 === The Phaeacians === 
 After a storm, Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians. There he is found by the king's daughter [[Nausicaä]]. Nausicaä brings him to the palace of her father, King [[Alkinoos]]. During his time there, Odysseus tell the story of his journey. After this, Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca.

 === Return home === 
 During all this time, Penelope has been keeping the suitors at bay with a ruse (trick). She promises  " I will choose when I have finished weaving this cloth " , the cloth being a burial cloth for Odysseus' father. However, every night her servant unpicks the work of the previous day. The story is made more real by Penelope becoming restless. The goddess [[Athena]] causes Penelope to feel the need to display herself, and fan the flames of the suitors' desire. 
 
 Odysseus finally returns to Ithaca, where he disguises himself as a beggar. He goes to his home and meets his son Telemachus. Together they kill the suitors, who are trying to marry Penelope in order to gain his kingdom. Later, the families of the suitors come to kill Odysseus for revenge. The goddess Athena helps Odysseus by making them stop and give up the fight.
