 '''Monocytes''' are a type of [[white blood cell]], part of the [[human body]]'s [[immune system]]. They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]]. They are a kind of reserve cell which turn into [[macrophage]]s and immune helper cells called [[dendritic cell]]s. 
 
 Monocytes work at two speeds in the immune system:  
 # To gradually replenish resident [[macrophage]]s and dendritic cells under normal conditions, and  
 # To move quickly (~ 8-12 hours) to infected tissue in response to [[inflammation]] signals. There they divide and differentiate into [[macrophage]]s and dendritic cells to cause an immune response.  
 
 Half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the [[spleen]]; < ref name= " Swirski " > Swirski F.K. ''et al.'' 2009. Identification of splenic reservoir monocytes and their deployment to inflammatory sites. ''Science'', '''325''': 612-616. < /ref >  the rest are circulating or in tissues.  
 
 ==Physiology== 
 [[Image:monocyte.png|thumb|Monocyte]]  
 Monocytes are produced by the [[bone marrow]] from [[stem cell]] precursors called ''monoblasts''. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. They make up three to eight percent of the [[leukocytes]] in the blood.  
 
 Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into [[macrophage]]s or [[dendritic cell]]s, which then stay in the tissue. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances. They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm and many internal [[vesicles]] for processing foreign material. 
 
 Monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system. These are [[phagocytosis]], [[antigen]] presentation and [[cytokine]] production. < ref > Cytokines are small molecules which carry local messages between cells. < /ref > 
 # Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells using [[Antibody|antibodies]]. 
 # Microbial fragments that remain after such digestion can serve as [[antigen]]s. This process is called ''antigen presentation'' and it leads to activation of T [[lymphocyte]]s. These mount a specific immune response against the antigen. 
 # Other microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
