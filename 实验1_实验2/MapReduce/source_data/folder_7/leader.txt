[[File:Familia de patos.jpg|thumb|A gaggle of [[geese]] following leader (parent, here)]] 
 A '''leader''' is somebody whom people follow. A leader has [[authority]]. For people to accept a leader, his or her leadership must therefore be [[Legitimacy|legitimate]].  
 
 Because people follow a leader, the leader can make people do things. A leader can therefore make people work together towards a common [[goal]]. < ref > Edwin A. Locke, ''The Essence of Leadership: The Four Keys to Leading Successfully'' (New York: Lexington Books; Toronto: Maxwell Macmillan Canada; New York: Maxwell Macmillan International, 1991), p. 2 < /ref >   
 
 An example of a leader is the [[head of government]] of a country. People within the government ''follow'' the leader, and citizens look to the head of government for inspiration and guidance. Sometimes, when a head of government lacks legitimacy, people will stop following him or her. The head of government is therefore no longer able to lead properly. This may result in a new [[election]], or in worst case [[civil war]]. 
 
 A group with no leader is called '''leaderless'''.
