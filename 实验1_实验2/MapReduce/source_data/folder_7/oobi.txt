 '''''Oobi''''' is a [[television program|television show]] for children. It was made by Little Airplane Productions in [[New York City]]. It is about a group of talking hand puppets with eyes and clothes. The main character, Oobi, is a four-year-old boy hand. He has a sister named Uma, a friend named Kako, and a grandfather named Grampu. 
 
 The show was first played in 2000 as a series of two-minute short episodes. It started as a series of longer half-hour episodes in 2003. It was shown on the channels [[Nickelodeon]] and [[:en:Noggin (brand)|Noggin]]. 
 
 While it was being made, the show was popular with preschoolers and fans of puppetry. It won awards from groups like [[:en:Parents' Choice Award|Parents' Choice]] and the [[:en:Academy of Television Arts  &  Sciences|Academy of Television Arts  &  Sciences]]. In the mid-2000s, there was a cult following of small filmmakers who used Oobi-style puppets in short movies. In 2012, a [[spin-off]] of ''Oobi'' called ''Dasdasi'' was made in [[Iran]]. The entire original show is currently included on [[Amazon.com|Amazon Prime Video]]. 
 
 ==Structure and plot== 
 Most episodes are split into two or three parts. < ref name= " PR2003 " > {{cite web|title=Noggin Introduces ''Oobi'' – The Friend Who's Always With You!|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noggin-introduces-oobi---the-friend-whos-always-with-you-74763932.html|publisher=Cision Inc.|work=PR Newswire|date=March 25, 2003}} < /ref >  Every episode has a main story and some [[interview]]s. In the interviews, the puppets ask real kids and families about a topic or place. < ref name= " StarDemocrat " > {{cite web|last=Levine|first=Evan|title=Family  &  Lifestyles: TV Reviews|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/115834025/|work=[[Ancestry.com#Newspapers.com|Newspapers.com]]|publisher=The Star Democrat|date=May 4, 2003|location=Easton, MD}} < /ref >  Episodes in season one also have a  " game segment "  where the puppets play a simple learning game. In season two, there were no game segments anymore and the main stories were made longer instead. 
 
 The show takes place in an old-fashioned town where almost everyone is a talking hand puppet. The puppets have eyes that they wear on the middle finger. The kids have four of their fingers straight, and they use their thumbs as their bottom lips. The adults have their fingers curled up, which makes them look taller. The only regular character who is not a hand is Frieda, a foot puppet.
