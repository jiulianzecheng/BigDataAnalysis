 '''Fugazi''' is an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band that became active in 1987. 
 
 ==History== 
 Singer and songwriter [[Ian MacKaye]] was in two bands before he joined Fugazi. These bands were Embrace, a band that existed from 1985 to 1986, and the more well-known [[Minor Threat]]. [[Guy Picciotto]], who played guitar, was in famous [[punk]]/[[emo]] band [[Rites of Spring]] from 1984 to 1986. [[Brendan Canty]], who played drums, was also in Rites of Spring. For [[Joe Lally]], it was his first major band. 
 
 ==Style of music== 
 Fugazi are known for their aggressive,  " chunky "  music. It is difficult to call them one genre of music. This is because they played many different musical styles. The band wanted to sound different from other bands they knew and had been in. MacKaye and Picciotto also have different styles of singing and songwriting. MacKaye prefers songs that people can sing along to, whereas Picciotto prefers more complex songs. 
 
 The members of Fugazi did not use [[illegal drugs]], drink [[alcohol]], or have casual sex. This was called being  " straight edge " . The term  " straight edge "  was invented by Minor Threat, MacKaye's previous band. 
 
 ==Today== 
 Fugazi have not officially split up. However, they have not played since late 2002. This is because some of the band members have settled down with their families. < ref > {{Cite web
