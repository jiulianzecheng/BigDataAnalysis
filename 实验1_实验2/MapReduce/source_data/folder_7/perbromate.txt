'''Perbromate''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is BrO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > . It contains [[bromine]] in its +7 [[oxidation state]]. It is a strong [[oxidizing agent]]. It is very unstable and turns into [[bromate]] and [[oxygen]] easily. It was first made by [[decay]] of a [[radioactive]] [[selenate]]. Later it was gotten by [[electrolysis]] of a bromate. It can also be made by [[oxidation]] of bromate with [[fluorine]] or xenon difluoride.
