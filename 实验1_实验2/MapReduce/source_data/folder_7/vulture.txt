 '''Vultures''' are large [[bird]]s of prey that usually feed on the [[carrion]] or (dead or dying animals and rocks). Vultures use their large [[wing]]s to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap. Vultures are also called buzzards. 
 
 ''Vultures'' from the Old World ([[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]) are not related to the vultures of the New World (North and South [[The Americas|America]]). They look quite similar, though. Both have [[head]]s and [[neck]]s with no [[feather]]s.  
 
 ''Old World vultures'' are related to [[eagle]]s and [[hawk]]s and use [[sight]] to find their [[food]]. ''New World vultures'' use their sense of [[Olfaction|smell]] to find their food. Vultures symbolize [[death]] in [[literature]]. 
 
 [[King vulture]]s use rocks to open eggs, they pick up a rock with their beak and simply drop or throw the rock onto the egg and breaks it. 
 
 [[New World vulture]]s is a name which is used for a number of species in the Americas. The best known of these are probably the [[Andean condor]] and the [[black vulture]].
