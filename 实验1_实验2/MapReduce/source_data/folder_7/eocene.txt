The '''Eocene''' was the second [[geology|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] in the [[Palaeogene]], and by far the longest. < ref > Kennet J.P.  &  Stott L.D. 1995. Terminal Paleocene mass extinction in the deep sea: association with global warming. Effects of past global change on life: studies in geophysics. ''National Academy of Sciences''. < /ref >  It began 56 [[million]] years ago, and ended 33.9 million years ago with a global warning crisis. Before it was the [[Palaeocene]], and after it was the [[Oligocene]]. 
 
 The Eocene, like the [[Palaeocene]] before it, had a climate much warmer than today. At the start of the Eocene the ''Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum'' was reached. This lasted for 100,000 years, and caused a large [[List of extinction events|extinction event]]. The land was heavily [[forest]]ed, with temperate forests into [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions. The many [[herbivorous]] mammals were [[browser]]s, not [[grazer]]s. All the members of the new mammal orders were small, under 10 kg. Eocene mammals were only 60% of the size of the primitive Palaeocene mammals that came before them. They were also smaller than the mammals that followed them (a typical exmaple is ''[[Eohippus]]'').  
 
 The end of the Eocene was the beginning of the [[Oligocene]] (33.9 million years ago). Many plant and animal species went extinct. This was the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]]. The extinction event was probably caused by [[meteorite]] strikes in [[Siberia]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]]. 
 
 == Swamp forests == 
 Tropical peatlands coexist with [[swamp]] forests in the Eocene. This is the most recent period which has left us [[coal measure]]s. It was so hot in the Eocene that there was a high level of plant growth. Polar forests were quite extensive. < ref > Speelman E.N. et al 2009. The Eocene Arctic Azolla bloom: environmental conditions, productivity, and carbon drawdown " . ''Geobiology''. '''7''' (2): 155–170. < /ref >  Fossils and preserved remains of trees such as swamp [[cypress]] and [[dawn redwood]] from the Eocene have been found on [[Ellesmere Island]] in the [[Arctic]]. 
 
 The end-Eocene flora and some of its fauna is well seen at [[Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument]], [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Colorado]]. < ref > Meyer H.M. 2003. ''The fossils of Florissant''. Smithsonian Books. ISBN 1-5834-107-0 < /ref >
