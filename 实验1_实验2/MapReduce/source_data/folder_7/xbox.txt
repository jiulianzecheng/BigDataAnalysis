 '''Xbox''' is a [[video game console]] brand made by [[Microsoft]]. It began in 1998 when four employees decided to try to make a system to compete with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]]. The employees took apart four [[Dell]] computers and built the console from the parts. The employees named the console DirectX Box because it used Microsoft's [[DirectX]] graphics program. They showed the console to [[Ed Fries]], who was the leader of Microsoft's game publishing business, and he liked the idea. < ref name=seattletimes_20110525 > {{cite news |title=Last of Xbox Dream Team, Otto Berkes Is Moving On |first=Brier |last=Dudley |date=May 25, 2011 |newspaper=The Seattle Time |publisher=Seattle Times Co |page=A12 |quote= Berkes and Hase were among a group of four who first pushed Microsoft to develop a Windows-based gaming system to compete with Sony's PlayStation 2, which was luring game companies from the Windows platform in the late 1990s.
