 A '''spoke''' is one of several [[:wikt:rod|rods]] radiating from the center of a [[wheel]] (the [[:wikt:hub|hub]] where the [[axle]] connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface.  
 
 The term originally meant the portions of a [[:wikt:log|log]] which one had split lengthwise into four or six sections.  The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape.  Eventually, the term spoke was applied to the finished product of the [[wheelwright]]'s work.
