'''Malachi''', '''Malachias''', '''Malache''' or '''Mal'achi''' was the writer of the [[Book of Malachi]] which is part of the [[Bible]]. This is the last book of the [[Neviim]] (prophets) section in the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Tanakh]]. Malachi is not mentioned by [[Ezra]], however, and he does not directly mention the [[Second Temple|restoration of the temple]]. The editors of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] think that he prophesied after [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] ({{Bibleverse||Malachi|1:10|HE}}; {{Bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:10|HE}}). They believe he made his prophecies about 420 BC, after the second return of [[Nehemiah]] from Persia ([[Book of Nehemiah]]{{Bibleverse-nb||Nehemiah|13:6|HE}}), or possibly before his return, comparing {{Bibleverse||Malachi|2:8|HE}} with {{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:15|HE}}; {{Bibleverse||Malachi|2:10-16|HE}} with {{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:23|HE}}).
