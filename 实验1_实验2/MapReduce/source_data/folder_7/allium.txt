 '''Allium''' is a [[genus (biology)|genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s. It contains [[garlic]], [[leek]],  [[onion]]s and [[chives]]. There are hundreds of species, some of which have been cultivated for much of human history. Today, about a dozen species are economically important. The [[type species]] of the genus is ''Allium sativum'', commonly known as ''garlic''. < ref name= " ingallium " > ''Allium'' In: Index Nominum Genericorum. In: [[Regnum Vegetabile]] < /ref >  The taxonomy of ''Allium'' is difficult, because the boundaries between species are often unclear. For this reason, the number of recognised species varies between 260, and 860. Most people think there are about 750 species. < ref name= " hirschegger2010 " > Pablo Hirschegger, Jernej Ja≈°ke, Peter Trontelj, and Borut Bohanec. 2010.
