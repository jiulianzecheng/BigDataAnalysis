 '''Cramlington''' is a [[town]] in the [[county]] of [[Northumberland]], in the north-east of [[England]]. 
 
 Cramlington is about five miles from the coast. The nearest beach is at [[Blyth]], which is to the east. The county town of [[Morpeth]] is rather nearby. 
 
 [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] city is also close, which people of Cramlington can go and enjoy. 
 
 Cramlington is rather new, with lots of [[park]]s. The [[bicycle]] track system means cyclists can travel around the entire town without having to travel on the roads. The underpasses under the major roads mean children can walk around safe from [[traffic]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 It was thought the [[Viking]]s were the first to settle in Cramlington. Until relatively recently it was made up of a few small [[mining]] [[village]]s, but was chosen to be a new town and since the 1960s, builders have enlarged the town to become the town of 40,000 it is today.
