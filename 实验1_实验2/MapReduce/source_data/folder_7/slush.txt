 '''Slush''', also called '''slush ice''', is a mixture of [[snow]] and [[liquid]] [[water]]. < ref > World Meteorological Organization Definitions of Sea Ice http://www.dbcp.noaa.gov/seashelp/HtmlIceGlossary.htm#slush {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108181615/http://www.dbcp.noaa.gov/seashelp/HtmlIceGlossary.htm|date=2009-01-08}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of SLUSH|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slush|access-date=2018-05-19|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In the natural environment, slush is made when [[ice]] or snow melts. This often mixes with dirt and other materials, resulting in a gray or muddy brown color. Ice and snow can often block the draining of water from slushy areas, so slush often freezes and melts multiple times before completely disappearing. 
 
 In areas where [[road salt]] is used to clear [[Road|roadways]], slush forms at lower temperatures than it would usually in salted areas. This can cause many differences, even in the same area.

 Slush behaves like a [[non-Newtonian fluid]], < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=S.|last2=Izumi|first2=K.|last3=Kimiishi|first3=I.|date=2007|title=Slushflow disasters in Japan and its characteristics|url=http://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/issw-1994-657-665.pdf|journal=Annals of Glaciology|volume=47}} < /ref >  which means it acts solid until its inner [[Shear force|shear forces]] reach a certain amount. When this happens, it can suddenly become fluid. This makes the behaviour of slush very unpredictable. This is the reason [[Avalanche|avalanches]] happen and are so unpredictable. This gives them potential to become a hidden [[natural hazard]]. 
 
 Too much slush can be a problem on an [[aircraft]] [[runway]] since it cause resistance on the aircraftâ€™s wheels. This can cause accidents such as the [[Munich air disaster]]. Slush on [[Road|roads]] can also increase the [[Braking distance|braking distances]] for [[Automobile|cars]] and [[Truck|trucks]], increasing the chance of rear end [[Car accident|crashes]] and [[Collision#Traffic|other accidents]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Snow  &  Ice - FHWA Road Weather Management|url=https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/weather_events/snow_ice.htm|access-date=2018-05-19|website=ops.fhwa.dot.gov|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Slush can be dangerous and slippery in overnight [[frost]]. 
 
 Sometimes, slush can be helpful. When snow hits slush, it melts on contact. This stops roads from becoming too full of snow or [[sleet]]. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Wilson|first=Logan|date=2018-02-07|title=PennDOT: Slush kept roads from becoming icy|language=en-US|work=WHTM|url=http://www.abc27.com/news/penndot-slush-kept-roads-from-becoming-icy_20180327041330708/1081508938|access-date=2018-05-19}}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
