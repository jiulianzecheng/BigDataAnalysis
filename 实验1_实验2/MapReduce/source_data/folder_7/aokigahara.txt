 '''Aokigahara''' is a [[forest]] at the northwest base of [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Japan]]. The forest is known to be quiet because of the absence of [[wildlife]] and the wind-blocking density of the trees that are in it. A number of rocky, icy caverns are in the forest and some of them are popular [[tourist]] destinations. [[Demon]]s in Japanese mythology are associated with the forest. 
 
 It is known as a popular [[suicide]] spot and is reportedly the most popular in Japan. It also ranks as the second in the world after [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. < ref name=WSJ > {{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114504929764426405.html|access-date=2012-12-15|title=Exiting Early|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}} < /ref >  There are signs in the forest in both Japanese and English that try to persuade people not to commit suicide. The forest is said to be haunted by the [[YÅ«rei]] (angry spirits) that were left to die. People that go there to take their life usually tie a thread when entering so that if they change their mind and want to make it out alive can locate their path but nobody has ever came out < ref name=Studio360 > {{cite web|url=http://www.studio360.org/2010/jan/08/|access-date=2012-12-15|title=STUDIO 360 IN JAPAN|publisher=Studio 360|archive-date=2011-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408142034/http://www.studio360.org/2010/jan/08/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
