 '''Haemocyanin''' (or '''hemocyanin''') is a [[protein]] which transports [[oxygen]] in the bodies of some [[invertebrates]]. Their active centre has two [[copper]] atoms which reversibly bind a single [[oxygen]] molecule (O < sub > 2 < /sub > ). Unlike the [[hemoglobin]] in [[red blood cell]]s found in vertebrates, hemocyanins are not bound to blood cells. The molecules are carried in the [[haemolymph]].  
 
 Hemocyanins are found only in the [[Mollusca]] and [[Arthropoda]]. < ref >  Burmester T. 2001. Molecular evolution of the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily. ''Mol. Biol. Evol''.

[http://www.jbc.org/content/275/50/39339] < /ref >  However, the molecule is used only in a few [[insects]]. This is because insects evolved another system: the direct transfer of oxygen to tissues by a system of tubes called [[trachea]]. This delivers oxygen direct to the wing muscles and other organs.
