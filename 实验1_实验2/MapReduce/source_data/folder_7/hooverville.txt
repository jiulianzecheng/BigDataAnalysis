 A ''' " Hooverville " ''' is the popular name for [[slum]] towns built by people without homes during the [[Great Depression]]. They were named after [[Herbert Hoover]], who was the [[President of the United States]] during the start of the Great Depression and was given the blame for it. < ref > Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88 < /ref > 
 
 Most Hoovervilles were made out of any materials people could find, including crates, [[cardboard]], and scraps of [[metal]]. They usually had a small [[stove]], a bed, and some cooking instruments. People who were living in Hoovervilles without jobs created public [[charitable organization|charities]] or asked for food from people with houses. 
 
 One well-known Hooverville was in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], where people lived on the Great Lawn, which was then an empty [[reservoir]]. < ref > {{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/29/realestate/streetscapes-central-park-s-hooverville-life-along-depression-street.html |title=Streetscapes: Central Park's 'Hooverville'; Life Along 'Depression Street' |last=Gray |first=Christopher |work=The New York Times |date=29 August 1993}} < /ref >
