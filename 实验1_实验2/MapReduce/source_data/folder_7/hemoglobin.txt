 '''Hemoglobin''' (or haemoglobin) is a [[protein]] in [[red blood cells]] which contains [[iron]]. It is used to transport [[oxygen]] around the human body. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/hemoglobin.html|title=Hemoglobin Overview|website=sickle.bwh.harvard.edu}} < /ref >   
 
 Hemoglobin is found in the [[red blood cell]]s of almost all [[vertebrates]]. The exceptions are the fish family [[Channichthyidae]], < ref name= " Sidell2006 " > {{cite journal

 Hemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases. It carries some of the body's respiratory [[carbon dioxide]] (about 20-25% of the total). < ref > {{Cite book|title = Anatomy and Physiology|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko2bBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences|date = 2015-02-10|isbn = 9780323316873|first = Kevin T.|last = Patton}} < /ref > 
 
 Red blood cells get their colour from hemoglobin, which is red. There are millions of hemoglobin molecules in each [[red blood cell]] and millions of red blood cells in the human body. When hemoglobin has oxygen attached, it is called '''oxyhemoglobin'''. 
 
 ==Structure== 
 The most common type of hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits. Each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein (globin) with a [[heme]] group inside it. Each heme group has one iron atom. This binds one oxygen molecule. So the complete hemoglobin molecule has four globin chains, four heme [[molecules]], and four iron [[atoms]]. < ref > [http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/hbsynthesis.html Hemoglobin synthesis] < /ref >  When hemoglobin is in the [[lungs]], it picks up oxygen in its hemes, and carries it to the rest of the body. 
 
 Its structure took years to work out. [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] worked out the structure of [[myoglobin]] first. That muscle globin is smaller, with only one heme group.
