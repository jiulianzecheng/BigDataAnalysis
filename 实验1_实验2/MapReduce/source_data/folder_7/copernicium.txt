 The element is named in honor of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. 
 
 Using [[periodic trend]]s, people think that it will be a liquid metal. It is likely to be more [[volatility|volatile]] than [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Copernicium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first made]] on [[February 9]], [[1996]] at the [[Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]. Copernicium was made by [[nuclear fusion]] of a [[zinc]] atom with a [[lead]] atom. The [[zinc]] nuclei was [[bombardment|bombarded]] on to a lead [[wikt:target|target]] in a machine named a heavy [[ion accelerator]]. 
 
 The element was made in [[2000]] and [[2004]] at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Russia]]. 
 
 In May [[2006]] in the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] checked that it had been made using a different method. They identified the last atoms that were made from [[radioactive decay]] of copernicium. 
 
 In February [[2010]] IUPAC officially approved the name copernicium and symbol Cn. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/web/nt/2010-02-20_112_Copernicium|title=Element 112 is Named Copernicium|accessdate=2010-02-20|archive-date=2010-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224054826/http://www.iupac.org/web/nt/2010-02-20_112_Copernicium|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
