 '''MyLifeIsAverage''' ('''MLIA''') is a [[website]] where people submit stories about their day. MLIA is similar to [[FMyLife]], except the stories are about average things, rather than bad things. The stories are judged by several users. If enough users vote that the story is worthy of being posted, then it becomes the first story on the home page, and will later be pushed down the page. Anyone can submit a story. Users may click on a story to leave a comment.  
 
 The stories almost always begin with the words  " Today "  and end with the phrase  " MLIA " .  < ref > {{cite news |first=MG |last=Siegler |title=MyLifeIsAverage: The Service Twitter Was Meant To Be |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051404238.html |work=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=8 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5isqrTEcI?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051404238.html |archivedate=2009-08-08 |url-status=live }} < /ref >

 The co-founder of the site, Guru Khalsa, says that MLIA tries to  " bring to light how much stupid and boring stuff gets posted on the Internet.
