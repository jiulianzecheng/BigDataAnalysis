 The '''Bosporus''' or '''Bosphorus''' < ref > also known as the ''Istanbul Strait'', ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''İstanbul Boğazı'') ({{lang-el|Βόσπορος}}) < /ref >  is a [[strait]] that forms part of the boundary between the [[Europe]]an part of [[Turkey]] and its [[Asia]]n part ([[Anatolia]]). It connects the [[Black Sea]] with the [[Sea of Marmara]]. It is about 30 & nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] long, with a maximum width of 3,700 & nbsp;[[metre]]s at the northern entrance, and a minimum width of 700 & nbsp;metres between Kandilli and Aşiyan; and 750 & nbsp;metres between Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı. The depth varies from 36 to 124 & nbsp;metres in midstream. 
 
 The shores of the strait are heavily populated as [[Istanbul]] is located on each side. Three bridges and one tunnel cross the strait.
