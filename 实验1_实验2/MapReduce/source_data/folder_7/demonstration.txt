 A '''demonstration''' can mean an [[wikt:event|event]] where [[people]] do something to let others know what they [[think]] and to try to change their [[point of view]]. It is one kind of [[protest]]. Examples of demonstrations include [[wikt:march|marches]], where people [[walk]] together, and [[wikt:rally|rallies]], where people gather in one place. During a demonstration, the people who are part of it, called ''demonstrators'', may display [[placard]]s or other [[symbol]]s that are easy to see, especially when the protests are being shown on [[mass media]] such as [[news]], [[television]], or [[social network]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-to-make-a-protest-sign-that-isnt-garbage |title=How to Make a Protest Sign That Isn't Garbage |author=Justin Caffier |date=February 22, 2017 |publisher=Vice.com |accessdate=23 January 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 Demonstrations are often made against a [[government]] if they do something the people do not want. Because they are meant for many people to be a part of, they are usually considered more successful if more people take part. Demonstration is permitted by [[international human rights law]] as the [[freedom of assembly]] if done [[peace]]fully (meaning there is no [[violence]]). However, demonstrations can get out of control and even turn into a [[riot]]. 
 
 == Another meaning == 
 A '''demonstration''' can also mean when someone shows how to do something, or in what ways a thing can be used. [[Salespeople]] often demonstrate things like [[computer]]s, [[car]]s, and [[television]]s to [[customer]]s so they can make sure the [[customer]] sees all the features of the item.  " ''Demo'' "  is short for demonstration, and people often use it to describe this meaning of the word.
