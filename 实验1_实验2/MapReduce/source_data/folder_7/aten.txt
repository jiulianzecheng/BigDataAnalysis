 '''Aten''' is the disk of the [[Sun]] in ancient [[Egyptian mythology]], and an aspect of the Sun-god [[Ra]]. Aten was pictured as a [[sun]] with rays that ended in hands. 
 
 The deified Aten is the focus of the  [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]] of [[Atenism]] established by [[Amenhotep IV]], who later took the name [[Akhenaten]] in worship and recognition of the Aten. In his poem ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'', Akhenaten praises Aten as the creator, and giver of life. Akhenaten was the first person to attempt to make a monotheistic religion. 
 
 The worship of Aten was eradicated by [[Horemheb]].
