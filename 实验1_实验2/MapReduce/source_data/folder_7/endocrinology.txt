'''Endocrinology''' studies the working of the [[endocrine system]] and [[hormones]]. < ref > Nussey S.  &  Whitehead S. 2001. ''Endocrinology: an integrated approach''. Oxford: Bios Scientific. {{ISBN|1-85996-252-1}} < /ref > 
 
 It is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a [[medical specialty]]. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in. 
 
 The endocrine system consists of several [[glands]] in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action. 
 
 Hormones are active in [[metabolism]], [[growth hormone|growth]] and [[developmental biology|development]], [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] function, [[sleep]], [[digestion]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], [[excretion]], [[mood]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[lactation]], [[movement]], [[reproduction]], and [[perception]]. Another field is behavioral endocrinology. < ref > Nelson R.J. 2005.

 == Medical aspects == 
 Medical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with [[Graves' disease]], caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone. 
 
 An endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include: 
 * [[diabetes mellitus]] 
 * [[hyperthyroidism]] and [[hypothyroidism]] 
 * [[Cushing's syndrome]] 
 These are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases. 
 
 An endocrinologist can find out if a person has one of these diseases by doing tests. They can test a person's blood to find out if they have too much or too little of a hormone. An example of this is [[Type 1 diabetes]]. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not have enough of a hormone called [[insulin]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.patient.co.uk/health/type-1-diabetes |title=Type 1 Diabetes |access-date=2015-04-21 |archive-date=2015-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419075638/http://www.patient.co.uk/health/type-1-diabetes |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Endocrinologists usually do not treat patients directly, but give advice to physicians about what how patients might be helped. 
 
 Endocrine disorders fall into three groups: < ref > {{cite web|title=Endocrine disorders|url=http://diabetes.webmd.com/endocrine-system-disorders|publisher=webmd}} < /ref >   
 # too little hormone: hormone deficiency 
 # too much of a hormone: hormone excess 
 # [[tumour]]s (benign or malignant) of endocrine glands 
 
 Most medical applications concern the lack of balance between hormones, and sometimes the complete lack of a necessary hormone. For example, most forms of [[hyperthyroidism]] are associated with an excess of [[thyroid hormone]] and a low level of [[thyroid stimulating hormone]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Diagnosing hyperthyroidism: overactivity of the thyroid gland|url=http://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/hyperthyroidism/diagnosing-hyperthyroidism-overactivity-thyroid-gland|publisher=endocrineweb}} < /ref > 
 
 === Helping transgender people === 
 Endocrinologists can advise on hormone treatment for [[transgender]] persons. A transgender person might want their body to look different so that they look more like their chosen gender. For example, a transgender woman might want less facial hair so that she looks less like a man to other people.
