 The '''tenrec''' is a [[mammal]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Tenrecidae''', found on [[Madagascar]] and in parts of the [[Africa]]n mainland. 
 
 Tenrecs are varied. As a result of [[convergent evolution]], they look like [[hedgehog]]s, [[shrew]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[mouse|mice]] and even [[otter]]s. < ref > Savage RJG,  &  Long MR 1986. ''Mammal evolution: an illustrated guide''. New York: Facts on File. p. 53. {{ISBN|0-8160-1194-X}} < /ref >  They occupy [[aquatic]], [[arboreal]], [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] and underground [[habitats]]. Some of these species can be found in the Madagascar's dry [[deciduous]] [[forests]]. 
 
 Although they may resemble shrews, hedgehogs, or otters, they are not closely related to any of these groups. Their closest relatives are other African, insectivorous mammals such as [[golden mole]]s and [[elephant shrew]]s. The common ancestry of these animals, together with [[aardvark]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[elephant]]s, and [[sirenia|sea cow]]s in the group [[Afrotheria]], was not recognized until the late 1990s. < ref > Stanhope M.J.

 Unusual among [[placental]] mammals, the [[anus]] and [[urogenital]] tracts of tenrecs share a common opening, or [[cloaca]], a feature more commonly seen in birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They have low body temperatures, sufficiently so that they do not require a [[scrotum]] to cool their sperm as most other mammals do. < ref > Nicholl, Martin 1984. In Macdonald D. (ed) ''The encyclopedia of mammals''. New York: Facts on File, pp. 744–747. {{ISBN|0-87196-871-1}} < /ref >
