'''Monolatry''' ({{lang-el|μόνος}} [''monos''] = single, and {{lang|el|λατρεία}} [''latreia''] = [[worship]]) is belief that many [[Deity|gods]] exist, but that only one of them is worshipped. < ref > Frank E. Eakin, Jr. ''The Religion and Culture of Israel'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1971), 70. < /ref >  The term  " monolatry "  was perhaps first used by [[Julius Wellhausen]]. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Robert|year=1916|title=Monolatry and Henotheism|url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfReligionAndEthics.Hastings-selbie-gray.13Vols|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=VIII|pages=810|access-date=Jan 21, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 Monolatry is different from [[monotheism]], which asserts there is only one god, and [[henotheism]], a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity. < ref > {{citation|author-link=Bruce R.
