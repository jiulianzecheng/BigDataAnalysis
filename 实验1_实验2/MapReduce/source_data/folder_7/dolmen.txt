 A '''dolmen''' is a type of single-[[room|chamber]] [[megalith]]ic [[tomb]]. < ref > Also known as 'cromlech', 'quoit', or 'portal tomb' < /ref >  It usually consists of three or more upright stones ([[megalith]]s) supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (table). < ref > [https://www.astromeridian.ru/magic/put_dolmena.html Dolmen's way - unique technologies of antiquity] < /ref >   
 
 Most date from the early [[Neolithic]] period (4000 BC to 3000 BC). Dolmens were usually covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[Tumulus|barrow]], though in many cases that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone  " skeleton "  of the burial mound intact.
