 '''Soundgarden''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band. They began in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in 1984. 
 
 Soundgarden helped create the sound of  [[grunge music]]. This is a [[genre]] of [[alternative rock]] that first became popular in Seattle. They were first signed to a local [[record label]] [[Sub Pop]]. Later, they were the first grunge band to sign to a major label, [[A & M Records]], in 1988. 
 
 Soundgarden became well known with the 1994 album ''[[Superunknown]]''. It debuted at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.

 In 1997, the band broke up because they could no longer agree on the sound of their musical future. The members worked on other projects for more than ten years. Soundgarden got back together in 2010. Two years later, they released their sixth [[studio album]], ''King Animal''. 
 
 On May 17, 2017, frontman Chris Cornell was found dead in his Detroit hotel room, the night after a concert at the city's Fox Theatre. An [[autopsy]] on his body revealed that Cornell had [[suicide|killed himself]]. The band broke up after Cornell's death.

 Bassist [[Ben Shepherd]] joined Soundgarden in 1990. Their next album, ''[[Badmotorfinger]]''  was released in 1991.  It had some success, reaching number 39 on the album charts. But it got less attention because of the surprise success of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', released the same month as ''Badmotorfinger''. < ref name= " Erlewine " > Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

Considine of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said ''Superunknown''  " demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career. "  He also stated,  " At its best, ''Superunknown'' offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on ''[[In Utero]]''. " < ref > Consideine, J.D.

October 1996. < /ref >  Tensions continued to increase during the tour. When asked if the band hated touring, Cornell said,  " We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring. " < ref name= " questiontime " > " Gardener's Question Time " . ''[[Kerrang!]]''. March 1, 1997. < /ref >  At the tour's final stop in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass guitar into the air in frustration after his equipment failed. He then stormed off the stage. < ref > " Nirvana and the Story of Grunge " , pg. 100. < /ref >  The band then also left the stage, but Cornell returned to play a [[solo (music)|solo]] as an [[encore (concert)|encore]]. < ref > Berger, John.
