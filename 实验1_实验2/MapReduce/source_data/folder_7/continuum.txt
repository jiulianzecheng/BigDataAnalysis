{{enWiktionary|continuum}} 
 
 A '''Continuum''' is a continuous series where all parts are very similar to their nearest neighbour, but the ends or extremes of it are different from each other.  
 
 This describes something that changes gradually (little by little) from one condition, to a different condition, but without any sudden changes or [[wikt:discontinuity|discontinuities]]. 
 
 The difference between a continuum, and something with very different changes that can be measured, is important for all [[Continuum (theory)|continuum theories]].
