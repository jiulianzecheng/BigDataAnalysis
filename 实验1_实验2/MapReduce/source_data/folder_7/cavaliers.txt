 '''Cavaliers''' was a [[nickname]] for the people who fought for King [[Charles I of England]] during the [[English Civil War]]. They fought against the [[Roundheads]] and [[Parliament]]. At first the name applied only to the royalist [[cavalry]]; the words are similar because they were originally the same word.
