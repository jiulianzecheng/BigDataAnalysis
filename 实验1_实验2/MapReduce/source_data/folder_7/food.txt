 '''Food''' is what [[people]], plants and [[animal]]s eat to live. Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and [[plant]]s. It is eaten by living things to provide [[energy]] and [[nutrition]]. < ref name= " eb " > {{cite web|title=Food:Definition|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/food|publisher=The Editors of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=16 July 2017|archive-date=27 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727134023/https://www.britannica.com/topic/food|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Food contains the [[nutrition]] that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans. 
 
 It contains [[protein]], [[fat]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[water]] and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/guide-to-essential-nutrients/simple-guide-to-good-nutrition/|title=5 Essential Nutrients to Maximize Your Health|last=Bowers|first=Elizabeth Shimer|website=EverydayHealth.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01|archive-date=2019-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801090430/https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/guide-to-essential-nutrients/simple-guide-to-good-nutrition/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called  " [[drink]]s " . If someone cannot afford food they go hungry. 
 
 Food for humans is mostly made through [[farming]] or [[gardening]]. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like [[meat]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and products with [[milk]] in them. Not eating [[meat]] is called [[vegetarianism]]. Not eating or using any animal products is called [[veganism]].

 [[Food]] produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the [[food industry]]). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and [[food additive]]s (such as [[food preservation|preservative]]s, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers). For example, [[bread]] is processed food. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Benisek|first=Alexandra|title=Processed Foods: What You Should Know|url=https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-are-processed-foods|access-date=2023-09-07|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Food processing]] at home is done in the [[kitchen]], by the [[cooking|cook]]. The cook sometimes uses a [[cookbook]]. Examples of cooking utensils are [[pressure cooker]]s, [[pot]]s, and [[frying pan]]s. 
 
 Food can also be prepared and served in [[restaurant]]s or [[refectory]] (in particular for children in [[school]]). 
 
 The utensils used may be a [[plate]], [[knife]], [[fork]], [[chopsticks]], [[spoon]], [[bowl]], or [[spork]]. 
 
 Many people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People [[trade|buy]] most of their food in [[shop]]s or [[market]]s. But some people still grow most or all of their own food. 
 
 People may buy food and take it home to [[cooking|cook]] it. They may buy food that is ready to eat from a [[market|street vendor]] or a [[restaurant]]. 
 
 Other countries have their own way of eating food. An example of an ethnic food is [[Mexican food]]. 
 
 == Production of food {{Anchor|Production of Food}} == 
 Originally, people got food as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. The [[agricultural revolution]] changed that. Farmers grew [[crop]]s including those invented and improved by [[selective breeding]]. < ref > {{Cite journal

 Food shortage has been a big problem throughout history. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad [[weather]] or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are [[hunger|hungry]]. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become [[disease|sick]] and die from [[starvation]]. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is [[famine]] there. 
 
 Food and water can make people [[Illness|sick]] if it is contaminated by [[microorganism]]s, [[bad metals]], or chemicals. 
 
 If people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick. 
 * If people do not eat enough protein, they get the disease called [[kwashiorkor]]. 
 * If they do not eat enough [[thiamine|vitamin B1]] ([[thiamine]]), they get the disease called [[beriberi]]. 
 * If they do not eat enough [[ascorbic acid|vitamin C]], they get the disease called [[scurvy]]. 
 * If [[child]]ren do not eat enough [[vitamin D]], they get the disease called [[rickets]]. 
 
 People may often have a variety of [[eating disorder]]s that cause them to either eat too much, or not be able to eat certain things or amounts. Common diseases like [[Coeliac disease]] or food allergies cause people to experience ill effects from consuming certain foods that are normally safe. If people eat too much food, they can become [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]]. This causes numerous health problems. On the other hand, eating too little food, from lack of access or [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] could cause [[malnutrition]]. Therefore, people have to balance the amount, the nutrition, and the type of food to be healthy. 
 
 == Food in religions == 
 Many cultures or [[religion]]s have food [[taboo]]s. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the ''[[Kashrut]]'' of [[Judaism]] and the ''[[Halal]]'' of [[Islam]], that say that [[pig]] meat cannot be eaten. In [[Hinduism]], eating [[beef]] is not allowed. Some Christians are ''vegetarian'' (someone who does not eat meat) because of their religious beliefs. For example, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] recommends vegetarianism. 
 
 In addition, sometime beliefs do not relate to the religion but belong to the culture. For example, some people pay respect to ''[[Guān Yīn]]'' mothergod and those followers will not consume  " beef "  as they believe that her father has a shape of the cow.
