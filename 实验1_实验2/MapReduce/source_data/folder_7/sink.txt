A '''sink''' is a place for washing. In homes, sinks are in kitchens and bathrooms. A sink has a [[bowl]] or [[basin]], one or two [[tap (valve)|taps]], and a [[drain]]. Water comes out of the taps; the bowl holds the water. The drain lets the water flow out.  < ref name=ohj > [https://books.google.com/books?id=3BYa3h-UGooC Sinks].
