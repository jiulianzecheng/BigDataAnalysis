'''Cartomancy''' is the study of reading cards for [[fortune-telling]] or [[divination]]. There are many different types of cards used for cartomancy, some of which include standard playing cards and the [[tarot]]. 
 
 Tarot cards are similar to a standard deck of [[Playing card|playing cards]]. In fact, Tarot predates regular playing cards, and might have been the basis for them. The major difference between playing cards and tarot is that tarot decks contain 22 extra cards called the [[Major Arcana]], which are primarily used to read fortunes. 
 
 Some Spanish-speaking countries like [[Mexico]] use cards similar to [[bingo]] for fortune-telling. They call this practice [[Loteria|Lotería]]. Because the game was invented in Italy, Lotería gets its name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for [[lottery]].
