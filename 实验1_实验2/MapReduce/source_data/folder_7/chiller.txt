 A '''chiller''' is a machine that removes heat from a [[liquid]] through an [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|vapor compression]], [[adsorption refrigeration]], or [[absorption refrigeration cycles]]. This liquid can then be moved through a [[heat exchanger]] to cool equipment. Refrigeration makes [[waste heat]] as a byproduct that must be removed from it or for greater efficiency it can be recovered for heating purposes. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/signup?a_id=65054884|title=Academia.edu - Share research|website=Academia.edu|access-date=24 January 2022}} < /ref >  Vapor compression chillers may use any of a number of different types of [[Gas compressor|compressors]].The most used today are the hermetic scroll, semi-hermetic screw, or centrifugal compressors. The condensing side of the chiller can be either air or water-cooled. The chiller is often cooled by an induced or forced draft [[cooling tower]]. Absorption and adsorption chillers need a heat source to work. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/machinery-tools-supplies/types-of-chillers|title=Types of Chillers - A Thomas Buying Guide|website=Thomasnet.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://theengineeringmindset.com/absorption-chiller-works/|title=Absorption Chiller, How it works|first=Paul|last=Evans|website=Thengineeringmindset.com|date=September 26, 2017}} < /ref >

 Chilled water is used to cool and dehumidify air. This is used in large commercial, industrial, and [[wikt:institution|institutional]] buildings. For example, schools, hospitals, and factories. Water-cooled chillers can be liquid-cooled (through cooling towers), air-cooled, or [[Evaporative cooler|evaporatively cooled]]. Water or liquid-cooled systems can be more efficient and have [[Environmental issue|environmental impact]] advantages over air-cooled systems. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ & q=water+chiller & pg=PR17|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

 ==Use in air conditioning== 
 [[File:Air Cooled Liquid Chiller.jpg|thumb|A liquid (glycol-based) chiller with an air-cooled condenser on the roof of a medium size commercial building]] 
 In [[air conditioning]] systems, chilled coolant, normally chilled water mixed with [[ethylene glycol]], from a chiller in an air conditioning or cooling plant is distributed to [[heat exchanger]]s, or '''coils''', in [[air handler]]s or other types of devices which cool the air in that area. The water is then brought back to the chiller to be cooled again. These cooling coils transfer [[sensible heat]] and [[latent heat]] from the air to the chilled water. This cools and usually dehumidifies the air. A chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between {{convert|50|kW|e3BTU/h|lk=on|abbr=unit}} and {{convert|7|MW|e6BTU/h|abbr=unit}}, and at least two manufacturers (York international and LG) can produce chillers capable of up to {{convert|21|MW|e6BTU/h|abbr=unit}} cooling. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.york.com/commercial-equipment/chilled-water-systems/water-cooled-chillers/yd_ch/yd-dual-centrifugal-chiller |title = YD Dual Centrifugal Chiller |website=York.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.lg.com/global/business/centrifugal-chiller |title = Centrifugal Chiller {{!}} HVAC {{!}} Business |website=Lg.com}} < /ref >  Chilled water temperatures (leaving from the chiller) usually range from {{convert|34|to|45|F|C|order=flip}}, depending upon application requirements. < ref > American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers {{cite web |url=http://www.ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |title=Handbook |access-date=2008-05-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162917/http://ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |archive-date=2008-05-17 }} < /ref >  Chillers will get water at 12°C (entering temperature), and cool it to 7°C (leaving temperature). 
 
 When the chillers for air conditioning systems are in need of repair or replacement emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] so that they can be quickly brought to the site. Large chilled water [[hose]]s are used to connect rental chillers and air conditioning systems. < ref > {{cite book|title=Request for Proposal #946 - Emergency Chillers Rentals|publisher=Montclair State University|url=http://www.montclair.edu/news/media/originals/Ad_Bid_946.pdf|access-date=23 July 2015}} < /ref >
