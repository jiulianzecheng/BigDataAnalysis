 '''Tokelau''' is a group of islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is made of three [[atoll]]s. These atolls have a surface area of about {{Convert|12|km2}}. About 1500 people lived there in 2016. The [[territory]] belongs to [[New Zealand]]. The atolls are [[Alatufu]], [[Nukunonu]], and [[Fakaofo]]. Together with [[Swains Island]] (which is now part of [[American Samoa]]) they are known as the '''Union Islands.''' Swains Island is about 180 & nbsp;km to the south of Fakaofo. Less than 50 people live on Swains Island. Tokelau is about halfway between New Zealand and [[Hawaii]]. 
 
 Tokelau does not have an official [[Capital (city)|capital]]. The most important languages spoken in Tokelau are [[English language|English]] and [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]]. 
 
 The people who live in Tokelau mostly live in four [[Village|villages]]: Two of them are on Fakaofo. The islands Atafu and Nukunonu each have one village. The most common language is Tokelauan, about half the people speak English. 
 
 According to the UN, many people on Tokelau are [[overweight]]: Many of the 15 to 64 age group also suffer from [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/westernpacific|title=WHO Western Pacific {{!}} World Health Organization|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2019-01-26}} < /ref >

 Tokelau is among the most remote areas in the Pacific: There are no [[Airport|airports]]; the islands can only be reached by [[ship]]: there are no sea ports, which makes travelling difficult, even between the atolls. New Zealand pays for a ship, which connects Tokelau with the next bigger seaport ([[Apia]], on [[Samoa]]). The trip from Apia to Fakaofo takes about a day, reaching the northernmost atoll Atafu will take another three to four hours. There is no large pier on any of the islands, which means that smaller boats (called [[Barge|barges]]) are needed to reach the shore. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.tokelau.org.nz/Bulletin/Sept+2017/Tokelaus+new+cargo+vessel+on+schedule+for+2018+service.html|title=Tokelau's new cargo vessel on schedule for 2018 service|website=www.tokelau.org.nz|access-date=2019-01-26}} < /ref >  The ship reaches Tokelau about once every two weeks. 
 
 In 2004 there was a vote to change the status of Tokelau: Rather than being a dependent territory of New Zealand, the proposal was to be  " in association with "  New Zealand, much like [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. At the time, the people of Tokelau voted against this independence.
