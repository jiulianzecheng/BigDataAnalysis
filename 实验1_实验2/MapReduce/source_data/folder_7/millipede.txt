 '''Millipedes''' are a very long type of [[arthropod]]. Millipedes are [[segmented]]. Most have between 20 and over 100 segments, and have flattened bodies. Except for the first few segments, each segment has 2 pairs of legs, as a result of each segment being the fusing (coming together) of two. 
 
 So far, about 12,000 different [[species]] of millipedes have been described. with 10,000 identified, and there is an estimated 80,000 total species of millipede on [[Earth]]. The animals are [[detrivore]]s, they eat what is left over from plants. 
 
 Most of the time, their food is [[rotting|decaying]] [[leaf|leaves]] and other dead plant matter. Millipedes are not [[poison|poisonous, but many species have glands capable of producing irritating fluids that may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.]] This protects them from being constantly eaten because of their slow movement. Generally, they are not a [[pest]], although young seedlings in [[greenhouse]]s can be sometimes eaten by these creatures. ''[[Xenobolus carnifex]] ''is known for its common infestation of [[thatch|thatched roofs]] in [[India]]. Several species swarm houses and farms, causing damage. < ref > Alagesan, P.; J.

 Some millipedes have fangs that allow them to directly prey on plants. 
 
 The primary [[defense mechanism]] of millipedes is to roll up into a spiral-shaped circle, protecting their more delicate [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] from being hurt by an armor-like skin. Millipedes can [[secrete]] liquids that can burn their [[predator]]s for protection. 
 
 Bristly millipedes lack armor-like skin, and instead have bristles (small spiky hairs) that protect them from insects, like detaching a bristle when it goes through the body of an [[ant]]. 
 
 They can easily be told apart from [[centipede]]s because centipedes move faster, have only have one pair of legs per segment, and eat animals instead of just plants, although a very small amount of millipede species are omnivores, feeding on insects, earthworms, or snails. 
 
 Scientists who study millipedes are called diplopodologists, and the scientific study (like astronomy or biology) of millipedes is known as '''[[diplopodology]]'''. 
 
 A millipede species,'' [[Pneumodesmus newmani]],'' was the first animal species to live constantly on land that lived 428 million years ago. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Millipedes are the most common in [[temperate]], wet [[Deciduous|deciduous forests]], but are also often found in [[Coniferous|coniferous forests]] and high-altitude alpine environments, some species live in deserts, and even fewer in caves. < ref > [[Shelley, Rowland]] M.

 Some species of bristly millipedes have been known to live in the common small cracks of tree [[bark]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Millipedes and People == 
 Millipedes, due to their [[herbivore]] (plant-eating) and, with some species, limited [[omnivore]] capabilities, do not bite [[human]]s, although some of the defensive liquids that they give out might cause minor [[irritation]] and burns on human skin. On the eyes, these can be much worse, and direct exposure can lead to very bad problems. 
 
 They also appear in various folklore, remedies, and traditional usages around the world.
