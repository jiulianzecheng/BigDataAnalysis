 '''Deshret''' was the name for the Red [[Crown]] of [[Lower Egypt]]. When joined with the [[Hedjet]], the White Crown of [[Upper Egypt]], it forms the [[Pschent]]. This double crown was called the ''sekhemti'' in [[ancient Egypt]]ian. Deshret was also the name for the [[desert]] Red Land on either side of the [[Nile|Nile river]]. 
 
 The Red Crown in [[Egyptian language]] [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] became the vertical letter  " n "  . The old  " n "  hieroglyph from the [[Predynastic Period]], and the [[Old Kingdom]] was a sign showing ripples in water. 
 
 ==Significance== 
 In [[mythology]], the earth god [[Geb]], the first ruler of Egypt, gave [[Horus]] the power to rule over Lower Egypt. < ref > Ewa Wasilewska, ''Creation Stories of the Middle East'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers 2000, p.128 < /ref >  The Egyptian pharaohs, who saw themselves as successors of Horus, wore the deshret to show their authority over Lower Egypt. < ref > Toby A. H. Wilkinson, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'', Routledge 1999, p.194 < /ref >   < br / > Other gods wore the ''deshret'' too, such as the protective serpent goddess [[Wadjet]] and the creator-goddess of Sais, [[Neith]], who often is shown wearing the Red Crown. < ref > George Hart, ''The Routledge Dictionary Of Egyptian Gods And Goddesses'', p.100 < /ref > 
 
 The Red Crown would later be joined with the [[Hedjet|White Crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]] to form the [[Pschent|Double Crown]]. This was a [[symbol]] to show their rule over the whole country, which they called  " The Two Lands " . < ref > Ana Ruiz, ''The Spirit of Ancient Egypt'', Algora Publishing 2001, p.8 < /ref > 
 
 The Red Land, the deserts and foreign lands around Egypt, was ruled by [[Seth]]. < ref > John D. Baines, Byron Esely Shafer, Leonard H. Lesko, David P. Silverman, ''Religion in Ancient Egypt: Gods, Myths, and Personal Practice'', Cornell University Press 1991, p.93 < /ref >  The Egyptians saw it as a dangerous confusing place, without laws or any order. 
 
 ==Records of the Red Crown== 
 None of the red crowns have [[wikt:survive|survived]]. It is not known how the crown was made or what materials were used. It could have been made from [[copper]], reeds, cloth, or even leather. 
 
 The Red Crown is often shown in texts, wall carvings and [[statue]]s. An early example shows a victorious pharaoh wearing the ''deshret'' on the [[Narmer Palette]]. A text from the reign of [[Djer]] records a royal visit to the shrine of the Deshret which may have been at Buto in the Nile delta. < ref > Toby A. H. Wilkinson, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'', Routledge 1999, p.284 < /ref > 
 
 No crown has ever been found buried with any of the pharaohs, even in tombs that have not been robbed. This suggests that the deshret was passed from one king to the next, much as in present-day [[monarch]]ies.
