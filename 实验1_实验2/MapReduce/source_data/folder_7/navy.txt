 The '''navy''' is the part of a country's [[military]] that fights on water using [[boat]]s. People in the navy are called sailors. The navy is mostly made up of [[warship]]s. It may also have its own [[air force]] and [[soldier]]s. It may have special boats that can go underwater, called [[submarine]]s, or another kind of special boat that is meant to carry [[airplane]]s, called [[aircraft carrier]]s.  
 
 == History == 
 Originally, Naval war was fought by ramming other ships and then jumping onto them to fight the crew. In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the ships were usually powered by [[oar]]s. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[cannon]] was invented. These could be shot at other ships from a great distance. Warships around this time also began to use [[sail]]s instead of oars for power. In the middle 19th century, ships began to be plated in [[armor]] for protection. [[Steam engine]]s allowed them move while carrying the armor, and better ones soon made them much faster. These early warships, called [[ironclad]]s, are thought to have begun the type of Naval [[war]]fare used today. Ships and guns soon became much larger.
