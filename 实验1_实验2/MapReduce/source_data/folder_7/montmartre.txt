 ==Name origin== 
 Montmartre means 'mountain of the martyr.' The name comes from the martyrdom of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], who was [[Decapitation|decapitated]] on the hill around 250 AD. Saint Denis was the [[Bishop of Paris]] and is the [[patron saint]] of [[France]]. 
 
 The hill's religious symbolism is thought to be even older. It may have been a [[druid]]ic holy place because it is the highest point in the area.
