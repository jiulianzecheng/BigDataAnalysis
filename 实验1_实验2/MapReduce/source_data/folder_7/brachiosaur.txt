 '''Brachiosaurs''' are a family of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s, the '''Brachiosauridae'''. < ref > Glut, Donald F. 1997. ''Dinosaurs, the Encyclopedia''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland. < /ref >  They were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs. As a result, there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family. 
 
 The largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaur, the ''[[Giraffatitan|Giraffatitan brancai]]'' (formerly ''Brachiosaurus brancai'') at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 Brachiosaurs first evolved in the [[Middle Jurassic]], < ref > On the basis of trackways only: no skeletal remains until the Upper Jurassic. < /ref >  and died out at the end of the [[Lower Cretaceous]], surviving for about 60 million years. The earliest known brachiosaur may be ''[[:en:Lapparentosaurus|Lapparentosaurus]]'' from the Middle Jurassic of [[Africa]]. The giant ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'' from [[North America]] was one of the last brachiosaurs, living just before the end of the Early Cretaceous period.  
 
 The name  " brachiosaur "  means  " arm lizard " , which may sound like a strange name for a four-legged animal. The family Brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer  " arms "  (front legs) than back legs. 
 
 == In popular culture == 
 Brachiosaurs have been featured in many works of popular culture, particularly the type genus, ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''. ''Brachiosaurus'' was featured in the 1993 film ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', as well as the 2000 Disney film ''[[:en:Dinosaur_(film)|Dinosaur]]''. The brachiosaur ''[[Astrodon]]'' is the state dinosaur of [[Maryland]]. It was featured in paleontologist Robert T. Bakker's novel [[Raptor Red]], where it was portrayed as a prey item of the dromaeosaur ''[[Utahraptor]]''.
