 The '''Palaeoproterozoic''' was the first [[era]] of the [[Proterozoic]] [[eon]]. It came after the [[Archaean]] eon, and lasted from 2500 to 1600 [[million]] years ago (mya). 
 
 In the Palaeoproterozoic, there was a huge production of [[stromatolite]]s by [[cyanobacteria]]. The first [[unicellular]] [[eukaryote]] organisms also appeared in the [[fossil]] record. 
 
 The first [[supercontinent]] grew, and some of the rocks were normal [[sedimentary rock]]s, not [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]]. 
 
 == Basic differences in Earth physics == 
 Because the Earth was only half as old as now, there were some basic differences from today. Heat in the Earth's interior was greater than today. This was mainly due to the higher abundance of [[radioactive]] [[isotope]]s, which decay as time passes. 
 
 Temperatures at the surface were also higher, due to radiation from the Earth's interior, and due to a [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]]-based [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse]] atmosphere. During the previous eon, the Archaean, the oceans were hot (55–85 & nbsp;°C). < ref name=Reddy/ >  This was only partly balanced by the fact that the Sun's radiation was lower at that time. 
 
 Paleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history suggests that ~1.8 billion years ago, there were about 450 days in a year, implying 20 hour days. < ref > Giorgio Pannella 1972. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/u4pl7170jr5427t6/ Paleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history since early precambrian] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706171244/http://www.springerlink.com/content/u4pl7170jr5427t6/ |date=2020-07-06 }} ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' '''16'''.2 p212 < /ref >  Further back, the Earth day had about 17 hours, and there were 514±33 days per year. The Earth–Moon distance for the earliest Palaeoproterozoic was 51.9±3.3 Earth [[Radius|radii]] (compared to 60.27 at present). < ref > Williams G.E. 2000.

 == Supercontinent == 
 A global supercontinent (called '''[[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]''', or '''Nena''') existed from about 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago in the Palaeoproterozoic era. < ref > Rogers J.J.W. and Santosh M. 2002.

 == Climate == 
 During the era climate changes were as severe as any in Earth history. From a global high temperature at the start, there were three massive [[ice age]]s, with ice deep into the tropics. < ref name=Reddy > Reddy S.M. and Evans D.A.D. 2009.

 === Drop in methane === 
 There are clear indications that the era saw a drop in atmospheric methane: 
 : " The collapse of methane from formerly high levels in the [[Archaean]] atmosphere  probably plays a large role, not only the oxygenation history, but also the occurrence of Palaeoproterozoic [[ice age]]s. The data point to 2.4–2.3 [[billion]] years ago as host to a ‘[[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation Event]]’, < ref > Cloud P.E. 1968.

''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B'': Biological Sciences '''361''':903–915. < /ref >  during which Earth's surface environment changed profoundly and irreversibly " . < ref name=Reddy/ > 
 
 === The buildup of oxygen === 
 [[File:Oxygenation-atm.svg|thumb|right|300px|Amount of [[oxygen]] in the Earth's atmosphere. The upper red and lower green lines represent the range of the estimates. The stages are roughly: stage 1 [[Archaean]] eon, stage 2 Early '''Paleoproterozoic''', stage 3 Later Palaeoproterozoic plus [[Mesoproterozoic]], Stage 4 [[Neoproterozoic]], and stage 5 [[Phanerozoic]]]] 
 
 Oxygen was produced by the cyanobacteria, but it was mostly used up by chemical sinks. These were the [[Oxidation|unoxidized]] [[sulfur]] and [[iron]]. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level. < ref name=Stanley > Stanley, Steven M. 1999. ''Earth system history''. New York: W.H. Freeman. {{ISBN|0-7167-2882-6}}. < /ref > < sup > p323 < /sup > 
 
 [[Banded iron formation]]s, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were formed by the oxygen forming compounds with iron; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago. [[Red beds]], which are colored by [[hematite]], indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks. < ref name=Stanley/ > < sup > p324 < /sup > 
 
 === Ice ages === 
 There were three major ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics. < ref > Evans D.A., Beukes N.J., Kirschvink J.L. 1997. Low-latitude glaciation in the Palaeoproterozoic era. ''Nature'' '''386''':262–266. < /ref >  Undoubtedly, they happened as a result of reduced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen production. 
 
 There is what researchers call  " a puzzling interval of ~1,400 million years with no verified glaciation between early Palaeoproterozoic glaciations at 2400–2200 mya in North America, South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia and the [[Neoproterozoic]] glaciations that affected all continents at 800–600 mya " . < ref > Williams G.E. 2005. Subglacial meltwater channels and glaciofluvial deposits in the Kimberley Basin, Western Australia: 1.8 Ga low-latitude glaciation coeval with continental assembly.

 === Meteorite strikes === 
 There were major bolide impacts during the era, two of which caused the largest impact crators on Earth. < ref name=Reddy/ > < ref > Grieve R. and Therriault A. 2000. Vredefort, Sudbury, Chicxulub: three of a kind? ''Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences'' '''28''':305–338. < /ref >  There are also three smaller (equal or more than 30 kilometers diameter) in the time zone of 3.0 to 1.2 billion years ago. 
 
 == Origin of eukaryotes == 
 The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll suggests they developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago. < ref > Knoll, Andrew H. 2004.

 < /ref >  Some [[acritarch]]s are known from at least 1650 million years ago, and the possible alga ''Grypania'' has been found as far back as 2100 million years ago. < ref >
