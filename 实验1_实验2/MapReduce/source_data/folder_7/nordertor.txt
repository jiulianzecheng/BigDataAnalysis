 The '''Nordertor''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Nørreport'') is an old [[City gate|town gate]] of the city of [[Flensburg]]. The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little [[landmark]] is in use as a symbol for the [[Germany|German]] town [[Flensburg]]. < ref > Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: ''Flensburg'', 29 < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 In 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its [[Wall|town wall]]. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called ''Norder Porte''. It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor. < ref > Werner Scharnweber: ''Flensburg'', 29 < /ref >  This marked the northern [[Border|boundary]] of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > Heinz Taufel, Kay Wohlsen: ''Flensburg'', Glossary: Nordertor < /ref > 
 
 On the north side of the gate are two [[Commemorative plaque|plaques]]. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], 1577-1648 and the [[Latin]] words: „Regna Firmat Pietas“ — Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the [[German language|German]] words: „Friede ernährt, Unfrieden verzehrt“ — [[Peace]] nurtures, [[War|strife]] devours. < ref name= " ReferenceA " / >  There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was [[building restoration|restored]] in the time of [[Christian VII of Denmark|Christian VII]], 1749-1808. < ref > Compare ''Flensburger Straßennamen''.

 After 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then. < ref > [[Flensburger Tageblatt]]: [http://www.shz.de/lokales/flensburger-tageblatt/stadtgeschichte-vor-der-haustuer-id866616.html Engelsby, Mürwik, Jürgensby - Stadtgeschichte vor der Haustür], Februar 5. 2009. Retrieved November 28, 2015. < /ref >  The Neustadt (''Newtown''), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the [[architect]] [[Paul Ziegler]]. The Nordertor got a [[clock]]. < ref > [[Lutz Wilde]]: ''Denkmaltopographie Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Kulturdenkmale in Schleswig-Holstein.'' Band 2, Flensburg, page 140 < /ref >  In 1966 the [[Deutsche Bundespost]] made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 [[Deutsche Mark|Pfennig]] [[Postage stamp|stamp]], used to send letters within [[Germany]]. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times. < ref > [http://www.flensburg-online.de/az/nordertor.html Flensburg-Online, Nordertor], Retrieved November 28, 2015 < /ref >  In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for [[Wedding|civil wedding]]s, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate. < ref name= " ReferenceA " / >
