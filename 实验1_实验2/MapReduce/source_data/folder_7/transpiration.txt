'''Transpiration''' is the [[evaporation]] of [[water]] from [[plant]]s, especially [[leaf|leaves]]. It is a type of [[translocation (botany)|translocation]] and part of the [[water cycle]]. The amount of water lost by a plant depends on its size, the light intensity, temperature, [[humidity]], [[wind speed]], and soil water supply. The process of  '''Transpiration''' helps in regulating temperature in the plant.  
 
 Transpiration was first worked out by [[Stephen Hales]] (17 September 1677 â€“ 4 January 1761), an English [[clergyman]]. < ref > Morton A.G. ''History of botanical science''. New York: Academic Press, 248{{ndash}}251. < /ref > < ref > Hales, Stephen 1727. ''Vegetable Staticks''. London: W  &  J Innys. [http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/title.asp?relation=QK711H341727  < nowiki > [1] < /nowiki > ] < /ref >   He proved what is still believed, that the evaporation of water molecules from leaves is the main force pulling the water column up from its origin in the roots. 
 
 == How transpiration works == 
 [[Leaf]] surfaces are dotted with openings called [[stomata]], which act rather like [[pore (skin)|pores]]. In most plants there are more on the undersides of the leaves than on the top. The stomata are bordered by [[guard cell]]s that open and close the pore.  Transpiration happens when the guard cells open the stomata.  This lets [[oxygen]] and [[water vapour]] flow out, and [[carbon dioxide]] flow in.  The carbon dioxide is used in [[photosynthesis]], and the oxygen is produced by photosynthesis. 
 
 Transpiration also pulls water through the plant. This brings with it the mineral [[nutrients]] from [[root]]s to [[shoot]]s. Water moves out of the leaves into the [[atmosphere]]. This exerts a pull on the water column, which brings the water up against [[gravity]]. Water gets into the plant at the roots by [[osmosis]], and it transports dissolved mineral nutrients to the upper parts of the plant through the [[xylem]]. A fully grown tree may lose hundreds of [[gallon]]s (thousands of liters) of water through its leaves on a hot, dry day. About 90% of the water that enters a plant's roots is used for this process; most of the rest is used in photosynthesis. 
 
 [[Xerophyte|Desert plants]] and [[conifers]] have [[adaptations]] which reduce water loss.  Examples are: thick [[cuticle]]s, reduced leaf areas, sunken stomata and hairs. All these reduce transpiration and conserve water. Many [[cacti]] do photosynthesis in [[succulent]] [[stem]]s, rather than leaves. The surface area of even a fat stem is far less that the total surface of leaves in a tree. Also, stomata of desert plants are usually closed during the day and open at night, when transpiration is lower.
