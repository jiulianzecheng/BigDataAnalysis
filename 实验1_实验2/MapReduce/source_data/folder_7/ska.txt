 '''Ska''' is a popular [[music]] from [[Jamaica]] that began in the 1950s. Ska music that was first played at a slower [[tempo]] then became [[reggae]] in the late 1960s. 
 
 Ska music bands include singers, [[electric guitar]]s, electric [[bass guitar]], [[piano]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[saxophone]], [[trumpet]], and [[trombone]]. In ska, the electric guitar and piano normally play short chords on the [[beat (music)|off-beat]]. If you go  " one and two and three and four " , the off-beat is the  " and " .  
 
 A ska singer does a style of Jamaican singing called  " toasting. "  When a singer is  " toasting " , they make sounds, repeat words, invent rhymes, and shout into the microphone. The Jamaican  " toasting "  style of singing and talking was adapted into [[Hip hop|rap]] music in the 1980s.
