'''Defamation''' is saying or writing something about another person that hurts their [[reputation]]. Usually, when people use the word ''defamation'', it means that the statement is not true.  < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/defamation.html |title=Defamation, Libel and Slander Law |author=Larson, Aaron |date=August 2003 |work=ExpertLaw |access-date=March 21, 2010 |archive-date=March 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323142209/http://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/defamation.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In this case, it is against the law. A statement that is defamation is called ''defamatory''. 
 
 In order to be defamatory, a statement has to claim to be a [[fact]] instead of an [[opinion]]. For example, saying,  " Mr. Jones is mean "  cannot be defamatory, because it is someone's opinion. However, if someone says,  " Mr. Jones steals candy from children " , then the statement is defamatory ''if'' it is not true, because it would be a fact, not an opinion. 
 
 If a defamatory statement is written, such as in a book or in a [[newspaper]], it is called '''libel'''. If it is spoken out loud, it is called '''slander'''. Somebody who is the victim of defamation can [[lawsuit|sue]] the person who wrote or said it. 
 
 Defamation is a tool of [[bullying]]. < ref > [http://www.apsbullying.com/defamation-law.html   " Bullying, Harassment, Victimisation and Discrimination in the Australian Public Service (APS)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413054751/http://www.apsbullying.com/defamation-law.html |date=2015-04-13 }}; retrieved 2013-2-15. < /ref > 
 
 ==Defamation laws== 
 Defamation laws are not the same in every country. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/overview |title=Legal Liability Overview  & #124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |work=eff.org |year=2011 |access-date=March 21, 2011}} < /ref >  In most countries it is a civil wrong or [[tort]]. In some it is a [[crime]]. In many countries the burden of proof is on the person claiming that somebody is defaming them. This means they have to prove that the thing that was said about them is false. However, in [[England]], it is the other way around. If somebody claims that a statement is defamation, the person who made the statement has to prove the statement is true. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1183394 |title=BBC - actionnetwork How to avoid libel and defamation |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2004|access-date=March 22, 2011 |archive-date=March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315201853/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A1183394 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
