 '''Creatine''' is a combination of three non-essential [[amino acids]]. These are methionine, arginine and glycine. Creatine is used to produce [[adenosine triphosphate]]. The short word for Adenosine triphosphate is ATP. ATP is the energy of the human body. Creatine is already in the body as a natural substance and in some food (for example beef). The body changes creatine to phosphocreatine. It is then stored as energy in the muscles. < ref > {{cite web|title=Diseases  &  Conditions: A-Z Fact Sheets  >  Creatine|url=http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/ConditionsAZ.aspx?ChunkID=21706|publisher=Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center|access-date=29 November 2013|date=August 2013|archive-date=28 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128035754/http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/ConditionsAZ.aspx?ChunkID=21706|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   The energy systems of the body are: aerobic, lactate and phosphocreatine. Most of the creatine is used in the lactate system and the phosphocreatine system because these two systems need more energy the aerobic system. They also take a part of the energy from the production or the absorption of creatine. 
 
 == Effects on the human body == 
 When someone eats creatine it can increase the size of their muscles and increase the amount of [[protein synthesis]]. The increase comes from the [[water retention]] of [[Cell|cells]] that store creatine. For [[protein synthesis]], it is not entirely known, but creatine can help with the recovery of muscle. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=Matthew B|last2=Rybalka|first2=Emma|last3=Williams|first3=Andrew D|last4=Cribb|first4=Paul J|last5=Hayes|first5=Alan|date=2009-06-02|title=Creatine supplementation enhances muscle force recovery after eccentrically-induced muscle damage in healthy individuals|journal=Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition|volume=6|pages=13|doi=10.1186/1550-2783-6-13|issn=1550-2783|pmc=2697134|pmid=19490606}} < /ref >  During the time a body recovers from training, the creatine gives extra energy so the cells of the muscle can speed up the protein absorption of the [[cells]]. 
 
 The creatine travels around the entire human body by going into the [[blood stream]]. The heart and the muscles are the main parts that use creatine cells. Most of the creatine production will be stored in the skeletal [[muscle]] because these muscles need a lot of energy and they need it quickly. The body produces about two grams of creatine per day. Only 90 to 95 percent of the human creatine production will travel in the blood stream. The five to ten percent that is not used is lost.
