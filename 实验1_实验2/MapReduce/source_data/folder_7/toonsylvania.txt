 '''''Toonsylvania''''' is an [[animated television series]], which ran for two seasons in 1998 on the [[Fox Kids|Fox Kids Network]] block < ref name=AWNSpielbergNickelodeon / >  (usually placed in a block called  " The No Yell Motel "  that contained other scary kids' shows such as ''[[Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Eerie, Indiana]]'') in its first season, then was moved to Monday afternoons from February 6, 1998 until January 18, 1999, when it was cancelled. It was executive produced in part by [[Steven Spielberg]], as [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]]' first animated series. < ref name=AWNSpielbergNickelodeon > {{cite web|title=Steven Spielberg Presents...Nickelodeon?|url=https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.10/2.10pages/2.10television.html|publisher=Animated World Network|access-date=August 7, 2015|date=January 1998}} < /ref > 
 
 The show had recurring cartoon series that appeared in each episode. (Unlike ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''Toonsylvania'' did not have a wide range of characters and almost every episode had the same content.) The main segments were  " Frankenstein " ,  " Night of the Living Fred "  (most episodes on season one),  " Attack of the Killer B Movies "  (some episodes from season 1),  " Igor's Science Minute " , and  " Melissa Screetch's Morbid Morals " . < ref name=Perlmutter > {{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman  &  Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=653–654}} < /ref >
