 '''Brigadier''' is an [[army]] rank, the seniority of which depends on the country. In the British tradition, this officer commands a [[brigade]], which is one-third of a [[Division (military)|division]]. As well as the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Marines]], this also applies to the [[Australian Army]], the [[Indian Army]], the [[New Zealand Army]] and the [[Pakistan Army]]. The rank is above [[Colonel]] and below [[Major-General]]. The badge on the uniform is three pips with a national symbol on top. 
 
 In other countries it is a non-commissioned rank (e.g. Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands). Instead, these countries use [[Brigadier general]] as equivalent. All [[NATO]] forces use OF-6 as the equivalent rank.
