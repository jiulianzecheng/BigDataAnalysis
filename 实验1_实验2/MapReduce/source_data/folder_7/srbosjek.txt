[[Image:jasenovac11.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Croatian Ustaše during [[World War II]] for the killing of prisoners in the concentration camps of the Nazi-puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]], most notably the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]]] 
 
 The knife gained notoriety because it was believed to be used by the Croatian Ustashas during [[World War II]] for the killing of Serbs, Romas and Jews in the tens of concentration camps across the Nazi-puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]], most notably the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. 
 
 It is said that in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] competitions in speedy slaughter were organized by the Ustashas. The winner of one such competition, Petar Brzica slit the throats of 1,300 (or 1360 ) prisoners. However, since recently it is regarded as something that was made up by the Yugoslav communists as there doesn't seem to be any solid evidence of it. It is also mentioned that even if it were true, the number is greatly exaggerated as one would have to kill non stop for 10 hours one person every 45 seconds.

 ==Description== 
 The upper part of the knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 & nbsp;cm long knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was fastened to a bowed oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle. < ref > Taborišče smrti--Jasenovac  by Nikola Nikolić (author), Jože Zupančić (translator),Založba  " Borec " , Ljubljana 1969  < br >  ''The knife described on page 72:'' 'Na koncu noža, tik bakrene ploščice, je bilo z vdolbnimi črkami napisano  " Grafrath gebr.
