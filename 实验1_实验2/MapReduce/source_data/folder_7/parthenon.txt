 The '''Parthenon''' is a [[temple]] in the middle of the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] (Europe). It was a temple to honor the goddess [[Athena]] for nearly 900 years from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, and originally had a huge idol to her. It was a Christian church from the 5th century to the 15th when it became a [[mosque]]. The name ''Parthenon'' means ''the [[virgin]]'s place'' in Greek. < ref name=crt > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/topic/parthenon |title=Parthenon - Credo Reference Topic |first= |last=|work=credoreference.com |year=2011 |accessdate=17 May 2011}} < /ref >  It was built between 447 BC and 432 BC during the reign of [[Pericles]]. < ref name=crt/ >  It is considered one of [[ancient Greece]]'s greatest [[architecture]] accomplishments. < ref name=crt/ >   
 
 The building was constructed using [[limestone]] foundations and 22,000 tons of [[marble]]. The building was designed by the [[architect]]s [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]]. < ref name=crt/ >  It has 46 [[doric order|Doric]] [[column]]s which support the roof, with 8 across the front and back, and 17 on each side. < ref name=crt/ >   
 
 In 1687 a [[gunpowder]] explosion damaged the building. [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]] took some of the sculptures, now called the [[Elgin Marbles]], from the Parthenon in 1759. They have been on display in the [[British Museum]] since 1816.
