 On the [[October 5]] [[2005]] Cobert Report, Stephen Colbert has this to say about truthiness: < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/the_word/index.jhtml?start=81 |date=October 17, 2005 |accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: The Word (Truthiness) |archive-date=2007-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210225152/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/the_word/index.jhtml?start=81 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 : " I will speak to you in plain, simple [[English language|English]]. And that brings us to tonight's word: 'truthiness.' Now I'm sure some of the 'word [[police]],' the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'hey, that's not a word.' Well, anyone who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books.  
 :I don't trust [[book]]s. They're all [[fact]], no [[heart]]. And that's exactly what's pulling our [[country]] apart today. 'Cause face it, folks; we are a [[division|divided]] [[nation]]. Not between [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] and [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], or [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[liberal]]s, or tops and bottoms. No, we are divided between those who think with their [[brain|head]], and those who know with their heart. 
 
 :Consider [[Harriet Miers]]. If you 'think' about Harriet Miers, of course her [[Nominate|nomination's]] absurd. But the [[President (United States)|president]] didn't say he 'thought' about his [[selection]]. He said this: 
 
 ::([[video]] clip of [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]:) 'I know her [[heart]].'  
 :Notice how he said nothing about her [[brain]]? He didn't have to. He feels the truth about Harriet Miers. 
 
 :And what about [[Iraq]]? If you think about it, maybe there are a few missing pieces to the [[wikt:reason|rationale]] for [[war]]. But doesn't taking [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam]] out feel like the right thing? "
