 '''Insight''' is understanding the inner nature of things. It is a type of [[wikt:comprehension|comprehension]] or [[learning]]. It can be used in several ways: 
 *a piece of information: ''I have an insight into that problem.''. 
 *the way you come to know something, a kind of [[learning]]. 
 *the answer to a [[question]] or [[problem]]. 
 *a sudden realization: the [[Eureka effect]], named after [[Archimedes]]. This is also known as an epiphany. 
 
 Higher intelligence (higher IQ) has also been found to be associated with better performance on insight problems. < ref name= " Nature of insight " > Sternberg, Robert & nbsp;J.  &  Davidson, Janet E.

 The definition of insight by sources, is for example:  " The fact of penetrating with the eyes of the understanding " ,  " deep " ,   " the power or act of seeing into a situation " . The idea of penetration into the psychology of the mind has existed at least since 1927, which is the year Dr. E. Minkowski described the idea of psychiatrists penetrating into the mind of patients for diagnosis.  A similar idea also is found in the writing/work/ideas of [[Carl Jung|Dr. C. Jung]] sometime  after 1909,  which Dr. E. Bleuler described as  " depth psychology " .  < ref > [https://www.oed.com/search/advanced/Entries?sortOption=AZ & textTermOpt0=WordPhrase & dateOfUseFirstUse=false & page=0 & jumpTo=insight  " insight NOUN " ] Oxford University Dictionary < /ref > < ref > [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/insight  " Meaning of insight in English " ] Cambridge University Dictionary < /ref > < ref > [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/insight  " Definition of 'insight' " ] Collins Dictionary < /ref > < ref name=mwin > [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insight  " insight noun " ] Merriam-Webster Dictionary < /ref > < ref > [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-thesaurus/insight  " Synonyms of 'insight' in British English " ] Collins Thesaurus  < /ref > < ref > Eugene Minkowski (The Schizophrénie, 1927): J.R.
