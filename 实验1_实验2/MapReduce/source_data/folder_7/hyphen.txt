The '''hyphen'''  is a [[punctuation]] mark used to join [[word]]s and to separate [[syllable]]s of a single word. The use of hyphens is called '''hyphenation'''. < ref > {{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hyphen|title=''Hyphen'' Definition|dictionary=[[dictionary.com]]|access-date=18 June 2015}} < /ref >  A '''hyphen''' looks like this: '''-'''. Hyphens have many uses in writing. 
 
 ''Son-in-law'' is an example of a hyphenated word. The hyphen is sometimes confused with [[dash]]es which are longer and have different uses, or with the [[minus sign]]. The hyphen is the shortest of these signs. 
 
 * Some words can have a hyphen added to change the meaning. For example, ''re-form'' means  " start again "  but ''reform'' means  " change " . A re-formed group is different from a reformed group. 
 * A hyphen is used to spell out some numbers (thirty-two, forty-nine, eighty-six). 
 * When a name for a material such as  " [[stainless steel]] "  is used with a word for a thing made of that material, a hyphen may be used, as in  " stainless-steel knife " . 
 * Some words have letters at the beginning, or [[prefix]]es, these can sometimes use hyphens: un-[[United States|American]], anti-[[pollution]], non-[[proliferation]] 
 * When spelling out a word: H-Y-P-H-E-N 
 * In some cases, when putting two words together would be hard to understand. For example, if something is '''l'''ike a she''ll'', writing it as  " shelllike "  is hard to read with so many uses of the letter 'l'. It is better to use  " shell-like. " 
 * When writing words that someone has spoken when that person has difficulty speaking, as in:  " I reached for the w-w-w-watering can. "  This is called a [[stammer]]. 
 * When adding words that already have a hyphen. For example: ''two'' to ''year-old'' as in:  " He was a two- or three-year-old dog. " 
 * If a word for a person (a name or [[proper noun]]) is used with another name, a hyphen is used, such as  " the Merriam-Webster dictionary "  or  " the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. " 
 * Some people take a name from the family names of both parents, or from the last name of their father and husband. For example:  " John Rees-Williams " . This is not always the case, for example:  " Hillary Rodham Clinton " . 
 * A hyphen is also used when a word is too long to fit in one row of writing. This is often done in books, magazines and [[newspaper]]s to save space and paper. A long word is broken into two parts, of nearly the same length, with a hyphen at the end of the first part. The normal way is to make the first part of the word as much of a complete word as possible. For example: 
 
 < center > 
 {| class=wikitable 
 |- 
 !Good 
 !Not so good 
 |- 
 |What was done was not good, not help- < br > 
 ful, nor was it very useful. 
 |What was done was not good, not hel- < br > 
 pful, nor was it very useful. 
 |} 
 < /center >
