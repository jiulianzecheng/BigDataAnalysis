A '''fermion''' is a category of [[elementary particle]]s. They are very small and very light. Fermions can be thought of as the building blocks of matter because [[atoms]] are made up of fermions. [[Paul Dirac]] named them fermions in honor of the famous scientist [[Enrico Fermi]]. 
 
 An [[electron]] (a charged particle) is a fermion, but a [[photon]] (the particle of [[electromagnetic radiation]]) is not.  The [[spin (physics)|spin]] numbers of fermions are 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc. Because their spin is not a whole number, they follow the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: no two fermions can share a [[quantum state]] (which includes position in space), if they have the same [[quantum number]]s, such as [[spin (physics)|spin]]. In other words, fermions can collide with each other. This behavior is not in the other class of elementary particles called [[boson]]s: you can have many bosons, for example photons, in the same place at the same time. The motion of fermions follows the [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]]. 
 
 Most well known fermions have [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2. An example of a type of fermion with a spin of 1/2 is the [[electron]]. The electron belongs to a group of fermions called [[lepton|leptons]]. 
 
 [[Fundamental particle|Fundamental]] fermions (fermions that are not made up of anything else) are either [[quarks]] or [[lepton]]s. There are 6 different types of quarks (called  " flavours " ) and 6 different types of leptons. These are their names: 
 * Quarks — up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom 
 * Leptons — electron, muon, tau, electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino 
 
 Each of these fermions also has an [[antimatter|anti-particle]] associated with it, so there are a total of 24 different fundamental fermions. The anti-particle is similar to the original particle, but with opposite [[electrical charge]]. The  " up " ,  " charm " , and  " top "  quarks have electrical charge of +2/3. Their anti-particles have charge -2/3 (anti-up, anti-charm, anti-top). The other three quarks (down, strange and bottom) have charge -1/3, and their anti-particles have charge +1/3. The electron, muon, and tau leptons all have charge of -1, and their anti-particles (anti-electron or  " [[positron]] " , anti-muon, anti-tau) have charge +1. All the neutrinos and anti-neutrinos have charge 0. The main difference between quarks or leptons with the same charge is their [[mass]]. 
 
 The [[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] counterpart of any fermion is called a  " sfermion. "
