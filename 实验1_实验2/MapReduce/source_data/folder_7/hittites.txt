 The '''Hittites''' were an ancient people from [[Anatolia]] who spoke an [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] language.  They wrote with [[cuneiform script]].  They established a kingdom centered at [[Hattusha]] in north-central Anatolia from the 18th century BC. 
 
 At its peak, the Hittite Empire covered most of modern [[Turkey]] and [[Syria]]. This was under the reigns of [[Suppiluliuma I]] (~1350–1322) and [[Mursili II]] (~1321–1295 BC). They had up-and-down relationships with the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] to the south and the [[Assyria|Assyrian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. They were a party to the first known [[peace treaty]], made with [[Ramesses II]] of Egypt by [[Hattusili III]] in 1258 BC. 
 
 After 1180 BC, the empire disintegrated into several independent  " Neo-Hittite "  city-states, some surviving until as late as the 8th century BC. 
 
 == Empire of Suppiluliuma and Mursili II == 
 The Hittite Kingdom reached its zenith during the reign of Suppiluliuma I (~1350–1322). < ref name=Bryce > Trevor R. Bryce 2005. ''The Kingdom of the Hittites''. < /ref >  The kingdom of Mitanni, wracked by civil war, was unable to withstand the Hittite onslaught. Suppiluliuma swiftly attacked the Mitanni heartland, capturing and plundering the Mitanni capital of Washshuganni. He then turned west, recrossed the [[Euphrates]] and captured all the [[Syria]]n kingdoms which were vassals to the Mitanni, including [[Aleppo]], Mukish, Niya, Qatna, Upi (Upina), and [[Kadesh]]. Other kingdoms such as [[Ugarit]] and [[Amurru]] (an Egyptian vassal) voluntarily became vassal states of the Hittites. < ref name=Bryce/ >    
 
 When hostilities flared up once more with Mitanni, Tulipinu, Suppiluliuma's son and viceroy at Aleppo invaded [[Carchemish]] but was unable to take the city. Suppiluliuma met with his son and then invaded Syria himself, laying siege to the city of Carchemish. Suppiluliuma broke the siege on the eighth day, installing his son Piyassili as viceroy of the kingdom. With his sons as viceroys of [[Aleppo]] and Carchemish, Suppiluliuma had cemented his rule over [[Syria]] and brought the empire of Mitanni to an end. The Mitanni King was assassinated soon after. < ref name=Bryce/ > 
 
 === The murdered prince === 
 When [[Tutankhamun]], the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] died, his widow asked to marry one of Suppiluliuma's sons.  He agreed, and sent his son Zannanza to Egypt to marry the queen.  However, Zannanza was [[assassination|assassinated]] en route to Egypt. Suppiluliuma was furious and blamed the new Egyptian Pharaoh [[Ay]] for his son's death. A Hittite army under crown prince Arnuwanda invaded Egyptian territory from Syria, pillaging and taking many prisoners. These prisoners brought with them a plague which ravaged the Hittite Kingdom continuing well into Mursili's reign and may have killed Suppiluliuma himself. < ref name=Bryce/ > 
 
 === Mursili II === 
 Mursili II was young and inexperienced, but he proved to be a strong king. In the first years of his reign he carried out punitive campaigns against several kingdoms. In Syria the Nuhashshi king Tette rebelled and was joined by Egyptian troops. Troubles in Syria continued when Mursili's brothers Tulipinu and Piyassili both died. The loss of his Syrian viceroys led to rebellion and even the invasion of Carchemish by [[Assyria]]. Leaving his generals to deal with Syria and Haysa, Mursili invaded Carchemish and drove out the Assyrians. < ref name=Bryce/ >  Later in his reign Mursili II campaigned against the Kaska once again retaking the Hittite holy city of Niniveh. He also decisively defeating the King of Tummanna.
