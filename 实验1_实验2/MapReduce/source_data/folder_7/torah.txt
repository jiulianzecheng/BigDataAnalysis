 '''Torah''' ({{lang-he|תורה}}) is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word that means  " instructions " . When most people say the word Torah they either mean the whole [[Jewish]] [[Bible]], the [[Tanakh]], the first five books of the Bible, or all of the Jewish teaching in general. These five books are the beginning of both the [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] bibles. They are 
 
 # [[Genesis]] ({{lang-he|Bereishit, בראשית}}), 
 # [[Exodus]] ({{lang-he|Shemot, שמות}}), 
 # [[Leviticus]] ({{lang-he|Vayikra, ויקרא}}), 
 # [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] ({{lang-he|Bemidbar, במדבר}}) and 
 # [[Deuteronomy]] ({{lang-he|Devarim, דברים}}). 
 
 Other names for this set of books are the  " Five Books of [[Moses]], "  or  " [[Pentateuch]] " . 
 
 Some people may use the word '''Torah''' as a name for all the main Jewish teachings. 
 
 Each of the books in the Torah are separated into parts called  " Parshiyot. "  ''Parsha'' is a Hebrew word meaning  " portion. "  Every [[Shabbat]] one ''parsha'' is read in the [[synagogue]], but sometimes two are read. This is so that all the ''parshiyot'' are finished every year, on the Jewish holiday of [[Simchat Torah]]. 
 
 It is also known as the '''Five Book of Moses''' because [[Moses]] received these five books from God. 
 
 The  " Tawrat "  ({{lang-ar| 
 توراة‎}}) is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an [[Islamic]] holy book believed by [[Muslims]] to be given by God (Allah) to prophets and messengers amongst the [[Children of Israel]], and often refers to the entire [[Hebrew Bible]]. < ref > Isabel Lang ''Intertextualität als hermeneutischer Zugang zur Auslegung des Korans: Eine Betrachtung am Beispiel der Verwendung von Israiliyyat in der Rezeption der Davidserzählung in Sure 38: 21-25'' Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH, 31.12.2015 {{ISBN|9783832541514}} p. 98 (German)  < /ref > 
 
 == Pentateuch == 
 Pentateuch means the first five books of the [[Bible]]. These books are [[Genesis]], [[Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]. The word ''Pentateuch'' comes from two [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] words that mean  " five books "  or  " five scroll " 
 
 According to tradition, the books were written by the [[Israelite]] leader, [[Moses]]. The Pentateuch is often called the Five Books of Moses or the Torah. 
 
 The Pentateuch tells the story from the [[Creation myth|Creation]] of the world to the death of Moses and the preparation of the Israelite's to enter the land of [[Canaan]]. The story is told in three parts. The first part (Genesis 1-11) is about the Creation and the beginning of human beings on earth. The second part (Genesis 12-50) are the stories of the [[wikt:ancestor|ancestors]] of the Israelites, mainly [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], and [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. The third part, beginning with the book of Exodus, describes how the Israelite's left [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the early history of the people of [[Israel]] as a nation. It also has many [[law]]s about how the Israelite's must build their [[society]]. Deuteronomy is mostly Moses's final speech to his people and a summary of the Pentateuch.
