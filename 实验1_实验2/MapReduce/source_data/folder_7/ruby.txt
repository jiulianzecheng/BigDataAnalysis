 A '''ruby''' is  a kind of precious stone. It is often associated with [[emerald]], [[sapphire]] and [[topaz]]. < ref name=Mindat/ >  It is usually red, but can sometimes be other colors. < ref name=Mindat/ >  It is formed of [[aluminum]] and [[oxygen]] (Al < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 3 < /sub > ), < ref name=Mindat/ >  and that means it's a kind of [[corundum]]. A small amount of [[chromium]] makes the color.
