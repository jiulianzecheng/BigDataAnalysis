 '''Procellariiformes''' is an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[seabird]]s that comprises four [[Family (biology)|families]]: the [[albatross]]es, [[Procellariidae|petrels and shearwaters]], [[storm petrel]]s, and [[diving petrel]]s. They have a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] across the world's oceans, with the highest diversity being around [[New Zealand]].  
 Only a single [[Egg (biology)|egg]] is laid per nesting attempt, and usually only a single nesting attempt is made per year, although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years. Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Incubation times are long compared to other [[bird]]s, as are fledgling periods. Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care.
