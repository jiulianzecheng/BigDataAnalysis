 '''Dieldrin''' is a [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]] originally produced in 1948 by J. Hyman  &  Co, Denver, as an [[insecticide]]. Dieldrin is closely related to [[aldrin]]. Aldrin reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to [[insect]]s; it is [[oxidation|oxidized]] in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the [[Diels-Alder reaction]] which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and [[hexachlorocyclopentadiene]]. 
 
 Dieldrin was developed as an alternative to [[DDT]] and has proved to be a highly effective insecticide. It was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. [[Endrin]] is a [[stereoisomer]] of dieldrin. 
 
 However, it is an extremely [[persistent organic pollutant]]; it does not degrade easily. Furthermore, it tends to [[biomagnify]] as it is passed along the [[food chain]].  Long-term exposure has proven [[wikt:toxic|toxic]] to a very wide range of animals including humans. For this reason it is now banned in most of the world. 
 
 It has been linked to health problems such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. It can also adversely affect testicular descent in the [[fetus]] if a pregnant woman is exposed to Dieldrin. 
 
 Dieldrin is listed in the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]. 
 
 ==Synthesis== 
 It can be formed from the synthesis of hexachloro-1,3-cyclopentadiene with [[norbornadiene]] in a [[Diels-Alder reaction]], followed by epoxidation of the norbornene ring. < ref name= " Tedder " > {{cite book |first=A. H. | last=Jubb |year=1975
