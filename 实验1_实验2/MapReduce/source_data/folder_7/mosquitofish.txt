 The '''mosquitofish''' (''Gambusia affinis''), also named the '''mosquito fish''', '''western mosquitofish''', '''western gambusia''', or '''live-bearing tooth carp''', is a [[fish]] in the [[Poeciliidae]] family.  It is from the southern and midwestern [[United States]] and east coast of [[Mexico]]. < ref name= " IUCNRed " > {{cite journal|author=NatureServe|year=2019|title=Gambusia affinis|publisher=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|volume= 2019|page= e.T166562A58317114|doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2019-2.RLTS.T166562A58317114.en|access-date=June 28, 2020|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/166562/58317114}} < /ref > < ref name= " USGS " > {{cite web|url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=846|access-date=June 28, 2020|publisher=United States Geological Survey|author1=Nico, L.G.|author2=Fuller, P.|author3=Jacobs, G.|author4=Cannister, M.|author5=Larson, J.|author6=Fusaro, A.|author7=Makled, T.H.|author8=Neilson, M.E.|title=Gambusia affinis (Baird and Girard, 1853): U.S. Geological Survey, Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database|location=Gainesville, FL|date=January 25, 2016}} < /ref >  Human beings brought it to many other places, for example [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Australia]].

 ==Size== 
 
 The adult male western mosquitofish grows to 4 cm and the female to 7 cm. < ref name= " FWS " > {{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/ans/erss/highrisk/Gambusia-affinis-ERSS-FINAL.pdf|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|title=1Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis): Ecological Risk Screening Summary|date=November 15, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2020|archive-date=November 12, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112013522/https://www.fws.gov/fisheries/ANS/erss/highrisk/Gambusia-affinis-ERSS-FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It has a round tail fin. < ref name= " IUCNData "  / >  It eats algae, insects, and other [[invertebrate]]s. It can eat more than its own body weight every day. < ref name= " USGS "  / >  It can live in water that is twice as salty as seawater. It can live in water as hot as 43°C. < ref name= " IUCNData "  / >  The western mosquitofish usually has 60 eggs at a time, but it can have as many as 300 at a time. The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch. < ref name= " IUCNData "  / > 
 
 ==Invasive species== 
 
 In the early 20th century, human beings caught western mosquitofish and took them to other places. They did this because they thought the western mosquitofish would eat mosquitoes and their young. This did not work. Sometimes there were more mosquitoes than before: The western mosquitofish killed other fish that were eating mosquitoes. It did this by either eating the other fish, killing them without eating them, or eating so much of the food that the other fish died. The western mosquitofish sometimes killed fish that were better at killing mosquitoes than it was. It also ate some of the insects that had been eating the mosquitoes and mosquito young. It also ate zooplankton, which left more food for the mosquito young to eat themselves. < ref name= " USGS "  / > 
 
 The western mosquitofish can kill larger fish by biting their fins and eating their eggs and babies. It kills and eats smaller fish. It kills frogs by eating their eggs and [[tadpole]]s. < ref name= " USGS "  / >  After people put western mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an [[algal bloom]] because the western mosquitofish kills all the fish that usually eat algae. < ref name= " USGS "  / >  The western mosquitofish is one reason why many other species are endangered. Some of the important ones are the Gila topminnow (''[[Poeciliopsis occidentalis]]''), < ref name=USFW > {{cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/1116|accessdate=December 15, 2021|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|title=Gila topminnow (incl. Yaqui) (''Poeciliopsis occidentalis'')|author=Environmental Conservation Online System}} < /ref >  and the [[damselfly]] in Hawaii. < ref name= " USGS "  / > 
 
 ==Name== 
 
 The western mosquitofish ''G. affinis'' and [[eastern mosquitofish]] ''G. holbrooki'' used to both be called ''G. affinis'' because people thought they were the same species. They are not. According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say  " ''G. affinis'' "  really mean ''G. holbrooki''. < ref name= " IUCNData "  / >
