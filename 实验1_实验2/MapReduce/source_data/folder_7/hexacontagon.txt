 A '''hexacontagon''' or '''60-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 60 sides and 60 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. < ref > {{cite book| last = Gorini| first = Catherine A.| title = The Facts on File Geometry Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PlYCcvgLJxYC & pg=PA78| year = 2003| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-1-4381-0957-2| page = 78 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = Peirce| first = Charles Sanders| title = The New Elements of Mathematics: Algebra and geometry| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wALvAAAAMAAJ| year = 1976| publisher = Mouton Publishers| isbn = 9780391006126| page = 298 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Regular hexacontagon == 
 A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] hexacontagon'' is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {60} and also can be constructed as a [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] [[triacontagon]], t{30}, or a twice-truncated [[pentadecagon]], tt{15}. A truncated hexacontagon, t{60}, is a 120-gon, {120}. 
 
 One interior angle in a regular hexacontagon is 174°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 6°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The [[area]] of a regular hexacontagon is (with {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} edge length}}) 
 : < math > A = 15t^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{60} < /math > 
 
 and its [[inradius]] is 
 : < math > r = \frac{1}{2}t \cot \frac{\pi}{60} < /math > 
 
 The [[circumradius]] of a regular hexacontagon is 
 : < math > R = \frac{1}{2}t \csc \frac{\pi}{60} < /math > 
 
 This means that the trigonometric functions of π/60 can be expressed in radicals. 
 
 === Constructible=== 
 Since 60 = 2 < sup > 2 < /sup >  × 3 × 5, a regular hexacontagon is [[constructible polygon|constructible]] using a [[compass and straightedge]]. < ref > [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConstructiblePolygon.html Constructible Polygon] < /ref >  As a [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] [[triacontagon]], it can be constructed by an edge-[[bisection]] of a regular triacontagon. 
 
 == Dissection== 
 [[File:60-gon rhombic dissection-size2.svg|thumb|60-gon with 1740 rhombs]] 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every [[zonogon]] (a 2''m''-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into ''m''(''m''-1)/2 parallelograms. 
 < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref > 
 In particular this is true for [[regular polygon]]s with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the ''regular hexacontagon'', ''m''=30, and it can be divided into 435: 15 squares and 14 sets of 30 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a [[Petrie polygon]] projection of a [[30-cube]].
