 '''Solvation''', commonly called '''dissolution''', is the process of attraction and association of [[molecule]]s of a [[solvent]] with molecules or [[ion]]s of a [[solute]]. If the molecules or ions of the solute are more strongly attracted to the molecules of the solvent than to each other, solvation can occur.  
 
 The solvation is the action of dissolving the mix to form the solution.
