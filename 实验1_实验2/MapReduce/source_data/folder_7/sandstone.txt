 '''Sandstone''' is a [[sedimentary rock]]. It is a rock made of compacted [[sand]]. Sand is small grains of [[rocks]] and [[minerals]] (such as [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]). These are the most common [[mineral]]s in the [[Earth's crust]]. 
 
 Sandstone which is resistant to [[weathering]] is used for building in many countries. It can be a hard rock. For example, paving slabs can be made out of hard sandstone. 
 
 Sandstone is converted into [[quartzite]] through heating and pressure. This happens when rocks are squeezed and heated under a [[mountain]] chain. < ref > [[Metamorphic rock]] is formed by [[tectonic]] compression in [[Orogeny|orogenic]] belts. < /ref > 
 
 Sandstone is most likely to be deposited from fast pacing water such as rivers. 
 
 == Origin == 
 Sandstone forms in two stages. First, layers of sand build up as [[sediment]], either from water or from air (as in a [[desert]]). 
 
 Then sand particles are compacted by pressure of overlying deposits, and cemented ('glued' together). < ref > The [[geological]] word for this is '[[cementation]]'. < /ref >  The 'cement' is either [[calcite]] ([[calcium carbonate]]), [[quartz]] ([[silica]]), or [[clay]]. [[Iron oxide]] often makes sandstone a reddish color.
