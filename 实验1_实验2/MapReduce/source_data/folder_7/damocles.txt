 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Damocles''' ({{respell|da|mo|KLEES}}) was a friend of [[Dionysus I|Dionysus]] ({{respell|die|oh|NIS|ee|us}}), the king of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] from 405 to 367 [[BC]]. 
 
 According to [[Greek mythology|legend]], when he spoke of the good life of King Dionysus, the king invited him to a [[banquet]] (large public meal). A [[sword]] was placed above Damocles, held up by a single thread. Damocles was scared of the sword, and felt that he could not enjoy his meal with it hanging above him. Dionysus said that this sword was a [[metaphor]] for the pressures put on those in [[public life]], and that they must conduct themselves accordingly. < ref name= " Damocles " > [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Damocles Damocles], ''[[Britannica.com]]''. < /ref >
