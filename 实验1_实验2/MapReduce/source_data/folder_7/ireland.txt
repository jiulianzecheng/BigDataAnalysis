 ==Countries== 
 Today, the island of Ireland is made up of two [[country|countries]]: the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]: 
 * The Republic of Ireland is a [[sovereign state]] and occupies 84% of the island. Its [[capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Dublin]]. The [[official language]]s of the Republic are Irish and English. Even though Irish is official in the country, only a small part of the population is fluent or a [[native speaker]]. While the Irish language (or [[Irish language|Gaelic]]) is taught in most schools, most people speak English in their day-to-day lives. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/|title=Irish Language and the Gaeltacht - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}} < /ref > 
 * Northern Ireland, which is one of the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], makes up the remaining 17% of Ireland and is in the north-east part of the island. It has a population of 1.8 million people, < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite web|url=https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2017-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland|title=2017 Mid Year Population Estimates for Northern Ireland|date=11 June 2018|website=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}} < /ref >  and its capital and largest city is [[Belfast]]. 
 * During the 1550s and the 1650s four [[Plantation of Ulster|plantations]] had taken place in Ireland. 
 
 From 1801 to 1921, all of Ireland was part of the same country, called the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1919, a war broke out, the [[Irish War of Independence]], and on December 6 1921, the [[Irish Free State]] became independent. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2026/v26.pdf#page=9|title=League of Nations Treaty Series}} League of Nations. Retrieved June 19 2019 < /ref >  After a new [[constitution]] came into effect in 1937, the state became a [[republic]]. Northern Ireland stayed with the UK, and this would lead to [[The Troubles]] beginning in the 1960s and ending with the [[Good Friday Agreement]] signed in 1998. 
 
 == Facts == 
 * The [[flag]] colours of the Republic of Ireland are green, white and orange.

 ==History== 
 {{main|History of Ireland}} 
 
 During the last glacial period (the  " ice age " ), most of Ireland was covered with ice. After that, Ireland became covered with trees. The first people came to Ireland about 9,000 years ago, in the Middle [[Stone Age]] (Mesolithic period). They were nomadic. Once food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another place. Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel, Co. Derry. 
 
 About 4000 & nbsp;BC, in the New Stone Age ([[Neolithic]] period), the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. When people in this age died, they were buried in tombs called megaliths. Many megaliths are left standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs.The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co.Meath. 
 
 New settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the [[Bronze Age]]. Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel, Co. Cork and tin was imported from Cornwall. These people used bronze to make weapons, such as swords. They also used it to make early forms of jewellery, such as sun discs and torcs. These settlers buried the dead in court tombs or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles. 
 
 It is unknown when the [[Celts]] came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the [[Iron Age]]. It is known that by about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The Celts lived in ring forts, hill forts, promontory forts and crannógs. It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in crannógs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them. 
 
 Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was elected from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos Dána, who were people with special skills, such as poets, Druids (priests), judges and craftsmen. 
 
 By the early 6th century, Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of [[St. Patrick]] and other missionaries. [[Druids]] were replaced by priests and monks. Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co. Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when [[Vikings]] attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of co. Kerry. 
 
 At this time many hand-written manuscripts were created by the monasteries. They include the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver chalices, croziers and brooches, and carved high crosses. 
 
 In 1169, [[Anglo-Norman]] lords invaded Ireland. They were led by Strongbow who landed at Passage East, Co. [[Waterford]]. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland in the following 60 years. They introduced their way of life to the Irish people. The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as a means of organising land. Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle, Co. Meath. During the [[Middle Ages]], Ireland's first proper towns were built. 
 
 From 1801 until 1921, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'. 
 
 In 1921 the south became the [[Irish Free State]]. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution which named the state '[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]', and in 1948 this state passed the Republic of Ireland Act which declared it to be a [[republic]]. 
 
 ==Migration== 
 Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the United States, [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[South America]]. The [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] (1845 to 1849 inclusive) forced many to leave; it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation, and a million more emigrated. From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s. Since then, the population has grown to over 6 million. This has been helped by the economic growth of the  " Celtic Tiger "  and since 2004 immigration from countries in [[Eastern Europe]] such as [[Poland]]. 
 
 Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from [[Irish people|Irish immigants]].
