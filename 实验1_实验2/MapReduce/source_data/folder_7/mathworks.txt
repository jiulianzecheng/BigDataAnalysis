 ==Company logo== 
 The logo represents a L-shaped object which is related to the [[wave equation]]. < ref > This is a [[partial differential equation]] about [[wave (physics)|physical waves]]. < /ref >  This was the subject of Moler's thesis. < ref >  Haigh, Thomas (January 2008).  " Cleve Moler: Mathematical Software Pioneer and Creator of MATLAB " . [[IEEE]] Annals of the History of Computing. 30 (1): 87–91. < /ref > 
 ==Who is Cleve Moler?== 
 Cleve Moler is a famous [[mathematician]]. He is known for his scientific textbooks < ref > Moler, C. B. (2011). Experiments with MATLAB. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. < /ref > < ref > Moler, C. B. (2004). Numerical computing with MATLAB. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. < /ref >  and technical reviews. < ref > Gupta, M. M. (1991). Numerical methods and software (David Kahaner, Cleve Moler, and Stephen Nash).

 ===MATLAB=== 
 {{main|MATLAB}} 
 MATLAB is a programming language made for [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[numerical linear algebra]]). < ref > Gilat, Amos (2004). MATLAB: An Introduction with Applications 2nd Edition. John Wiley  &  Sons. < /ref > < ref > Quarteroni, Alfio; Saleri, Fausto (2006). Scientific Computing with MATLAB and [[GNU Octave|Octave]]. Springer. < /ref > < ref > Gander, W.,  &  Hrebicek, J. (Eds.). (2011). Solving problems in scientific computing using Maple and Matlab®. Springer Science  &  Business Media. < /ref >  It is named after '''[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]] Laboratory'''. 
 ===Simulation software=== 
 MathWorks is also known for their [[simulation]]-related products. The most famous one is '''Simulink'''. < ref > Binh, L. N. (2014). Optical fiber communication systems with Matlab and Simulink models. CRC Press. < /ref > < ref > Stewart, R. W., Barlee, K. W.,  &  Atkinson, D. S. (2015).

American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.. < /ref > < ref > Klee, H.,  &  Allen, R. (2016). Simulation of dynamic systems with MATLAB and Simulink. CRC Press. < /ref >  It is very popular as same as MATLAB. There is also SimEvents and Stateflow. SimEvents was made to '''simulate''' physical or dynamical '''[[Phenomenon|events]]'''. < ref > Gray, M. A. (2007). Discrete event simulation: A review of SimEvents. Computing in Science  &  Engineering, 9(6), 62-66. < /ref > < ref > Harahap, E., Sukarsih, I., Gunawan, G., Fajar, M. Y., Darmawan, D.,  &  Nishi, H. (2016).
