 '''Citizendium''' (short for the [[citizen]]s' [[compendium]]) is an English-language [[wiki]]-based [[online encyclopedia]] launched by [[Larry Sanger]] in 2007. On this wiki, people have to use their [[given name]]s and must request an account to prove they are real. Articles created by Citizendium editors are under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License]]. As of September 2020, Citizendium has 17,000 articles < ref > {{cite web|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Category:CZ_Live 
  |title=Category:CZ Live 
  |publisher=Citizendium|access-date=2013-10-17}} < /ref >  and 149 approved articles. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Category:Approved_Articles

 When Citizendium started, experts were given a special status: they were allowed to  " approve "  articles and were able to decide who is right when there are conflicts over the content in the encyclopedia.  As of 2020, the former  " experts "  policy is in limbo, as the membership of the wiki is too small to implement it and because it was deemed not effective.  All writers are treated as equal. 
 
 The [[server]] which runs the website costs money to run.  The only way the wiki can stay active is if members donate money, or if Citizendium can find a group or organization that can provide funds. < ref > [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Financial_report CZ Financial report] < /ref > 
 
 Citizendium is now a small community. In early 2022, it had around ten contributors making at least one edit a month. < ref name=NumberOfEditors > [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Citizendium  " Welcome to Citizendium " ], Citizendium.
