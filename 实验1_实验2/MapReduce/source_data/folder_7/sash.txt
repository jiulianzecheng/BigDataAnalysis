 A '''sash''' is of a cloth [[belt]] used to hold a [[robe]] together, and usually tied about the [[waist]]. The [[Japan]]ese equivalent of a sash, called an ''[[obi]]'', serves to hold a [[kimono]] together. Decorative sashes may pass from the [[shoulder]] to the [[hip]] rather than around the waist. Sashes traditionally form part of formal military uniform and the [[Royal family|royal]] [[attire]]. 
 
 The meaning  " strip of cloth worn about the waist or over the shoulder "  was first recorded in 1681.  < ref > {{Cite web
