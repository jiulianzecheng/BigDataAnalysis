 '''Kuwait''' (Arabic: الكويت) is a small Arab [[country]] (about 17,819 [[square kilometre|square kilometers]]) in the [[Middle East]]. 
 
 Kuwait is the most socially progressive country in the Gulf region. It has a small and rich [[economy]]. It has about 96 billion [[barrel]]s of [[petroleum|crude oil]] reserves. Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up. Kuwait has 10% of all of the oil reserves in the world. The country makes a lot of money by selling oil. This money is almost half of all the money the country makes. The oil money is also 95% of the money made by selling things to different countries (people call that [[export]]s). Also, the oil money is 80% of the money the government makes. Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country. 
 
 Kuwait's weather makes farming hard (too little [[rain]]). Instead of farming, the country catches [[fish]] and buys [[food]] from other countries. About 75% of the country's [[water]] to drink has to be [[distillation|distilled]] (have the [[salt]] removed) or [[wikt:purchase|purchase]]d from other countries. 
 
 In [[1990]], [[Iraq]] [[invasion|invaded]] (brought an army in to fight against) Kuwait. This started the first [[Gulf War]]. Kuwait's official religion is [[Islam]], although 15% of its population are [[Christian]] or [[Hindu]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis (residents of Kuwait). Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age. 
 
 Another interesting fact about Kuwait is that a lot of people speak English.

 == Governorates == 
 Kuwait is divided into 6 [[Governorates of Kuwait|governorates]]. The governorates are divided into districts, And the establishment of the governorates of Kuwait dates back to the Emiri Decree No. 6 issued in 1962, which divided Kuwait into three governorates: the Capital Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Al-Ahmadi Governorate. The decree clarified the work of the governor, his subordination of the governor to the Ministry of Interior, and his responsibility towards security, provided that the Ministry of Interior issues the necessary decisions to indicate the limits of the governor's jurisdiction. There have been some changes regarding the governorates of Kuwait, which we summarize as follows: 
 
 . On November 14, 1979: Some provisions of the administrative division decree were amended so that a fourth governorate, Al-Jahra Governorate, was added. 
 
 . On October 12, 1988: The first article of the article was amended to divide Kuwait into five governorates by adding Al-Farwaniyah Governorate. 
 
 . On November 27, 1999: Emiri Decree No. 290 was issued to add a sixth governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate. 
 
 Thus, Kuwait has become administratively divided into six governorates, each affiliated with several regions. Warba Island and Bubiyan Island belong to the Jahra Governorate, while the rest of the islands belong to the Capital Governorate.
