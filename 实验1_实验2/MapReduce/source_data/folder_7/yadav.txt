 ==Origin and History== 
 Yadavs are the descendants of [[Yadu]], the eldest son of King Yayati. It is said that Yadu was expelled by Yayati from his kingdom and became a rebel. His successor was Madhu, who ruled from Madhuvana, situated on the banks of river [[Yamuna]], which extended up to Saurastra and Anarta (Gujrat). His daughter Madhumati married Harinasva of Ikshvaku race, from whom Yadu was born again, this time being ancestor of Yadavas. [[Nanda (Hinduism)|Nanda]], the foster father of Krishna, was born in the line of succession of Madhu and ruled from the same side of Yamuna. Jarasandh, Kansa's father-in-law, and king of Magadha attacked Yadavas to avenge Kansa's death. Yadavas had to shift their capital from [[Mathura]] (central Aryavart) to [[Dwarka|Dwaraka]] (on the western coast of Aryavart) on the Sindhu. Yadu was a legendary Hindu king, believed to be an ancestor of the god Krishna, who for this reason is sometimes referred to as Yadava. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BRjkE385ScC & dq=madhu+yadu & pg=PA122|title=Ancient Indian Historical Tradition|last=Pargiter|first=F.

 The Yadavs of the [[Mahabharata]] period were known to be the followers of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnavism]], of which [[Krishna]] was the leader. They were the [[Gopa (caste)|gopas]] (cowherd) by profession, but at the same time they held the status of the [[Kshatriya|Kshatriyas]], participating in the battle of [[Kurukshetra War|Kurukshetra]]. The present [[Ahir|Ahirs]] are also followers of [[Vaishnavism|Vaisnavism]]. In the Epics and the Puranas the association of the Yadavas with the [[Abhira|Abhiras]] ([[Ahir|Ahirs]]) was attested by the evidence that the Yadava kingdom was  "  mostly inhabited by the [[Abhira|Abhiras]] ([[Ahir|Ahirs]]) " . < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8kiAQAAMAAJ|title=Man in India|last=Bahadur)|first=Sarat Chandra Roy (Rai|date=1974|publisher=A.

 Ramprasad Chanda, points to the fact that in the Indra is said to have brought Turvasu and [[Yadu]] from over the sea, and Yadu and Turvasu are called Barbarian or Dasa. After analyzing the ancient legends and traditions he comes to the conclusion that Yadavas were originally settled in the Kathiawar peninsula and subsequently spread to [[Mathura]]. 
 
 Of the [[Yadu|Yadus]], [[Rigveda]] provides two very interesting data, first, that they were arajinah - without King or non-monarchical, and second that Indra brought them from beyond the sea and made them worthy of consecration. A. D. Pusalkar observed that Yadvas were called Asuras in the epic and puranas, which may be due to mixing with non-aryans and the looseness in observance of Aryan Dharma. It is important to note that even in the Mahabharata Krishna is called Sanghmukhya - Head of Sangh (congress). Bimanbehari Majumdar points out at one place in the mahabharata Yadavas are called Vratyas and at another place Krishna speaks of his tribe consisting of eighteen thousand vratyas. It is interesting to note that much later, < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lr9pFQPwhXYC & dq=yadu+Rigveda & pg=PA33|title=Theory of Avatāra and Divinity of Chaitanya|last=Roy|first=Janmajit|date=2002|publisher=Atlantic Publishers  &  Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0169-2|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Abhira]] of Deccan were called Andhra-Vratyas, and Puranas refer to them as Vratyas on many occasions.

 The Yadavs are divided into different subdivisions which have different ritual ranks ([[Yaduvanshi caste|Yaduvanshi]], Goallavanshi and Nandavanshi).

 ==== The Shaineyas ==== 
 The Shaineyas are believed to have descended from Shini, son of Anamitra, son of Vrishni. In the ''Mahabharata'' and the Puranas, the most notable Shaineya was [[Satyaki|Yuyudhana]], son of Satyaka and grandson of Shini. He was a contemporary of Krishna. According to the Puranas, Asanga and Yugandhara were his son and grandson respectively. < ref name= " p4 "  / >

 === The fratricidal war and its aftermath === 
 According to the ''[[Mausala Parva]]'' (7.185-253) of the ''Mahabharata'' a few years after the ''Kurukshetra War'', Andhaka-Vrsni Yadava clans of Dvaraka were destroyed due to a fratricidal war. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XO3Im3OMi8C & pg=PA102|title=Seer of the Fifth Veda: Kr̥ṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa in the Mahābhārata|last=Sullivan|first=Bruce M|publisher=Motilal|year=1999|isbn=9788120816763|page=103}} < /ref >  Both [[Balarama]] and [[Krishna]] died soon after this war. Later, son of Kritavarma became ruler of Mrittikavati and grandson of Yuyudhana became ruler of the territory near the [[Sarasvati River]]. The rest of the surviving Yadavas took refuge in [[Indraprastha]]. Vajra, great-grandson of Krishna was installed as their king. < ref name= " p6 " > Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922].

 Vajra is mentioned as the great-grandson of Krishna in the [[Vishnu Purana]]. According to a section of this text (IV.15.34-42), he was the son of [[Aniruddha]] and Subhadra. < ref name= " wilson2 " > {{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp108.htm|title=The Vishnu Purana|last=Wilson|first=Horace Hayman (tr.)|publisher=John Murray|year=1840|location=London|page=440}} < /ref >  But according or another section (V.32.6-7), he was the son of Aniruddha and Usha, daughter of Bana and granddaughter of [[Mahabali|Bali]]. < ref > {{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp149.htm|title=The Vishnu Purana|last=Wilson|first=Horace Hayman (tr.)|publisher=John Murray|year=1840|location=London|page=591}} < /ref >  Bahu (or Pratibahu) was his son and Sucharu was his grandson. < ref name= " wilson2 "  / >  Elsewhere in this text (V.38.34), he was mentioned as installed as king in Mathura instead of Indraprastha. < ref > {{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp155.htm|title=The Vishnu Purana|last=Wilson|first=Horace Hayman (tr.)|publisher=John Murray|year=1840|location=London|page=615}} < /ref > 
 
 The narrative of the Yadava fratricidal war is also found in two [[Jataka tales]] of the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Buddhist canon]]: the ''Ghata Jataka'' and the ''Samkicca Jataka''. According to the ''Ghata Jataka'', Vasudeva, Baladeva and eight other ''Andhaka-Venhu'' (probably, a corrupt form of ''Andhaka-Venhi'', [[Pali language|Pali]] equivalent to Sanskrit Andhaka-Vrishni) brothers seized [[Dvārakā|Dvaravati]] and killed its king Kamsa. Later, these brothers fought amongst themselves and except Vasudeva and Baladeva everybody died. Vasudeva and Baladeva also died soon after. The ''Samkicca Jataka'' mentions that the ''Andhaka-Venhu''s killed each other. < ref name= " sullivan " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIfOXgak2H8C & pg=PA103|title=Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa and the Mahābhārata: A New Interpretation|last=Sullivan|first=Bruce M.|publisher=E.

 == Yadava kinship system == 
 According to a modern historian, [[Romila Thapar]], the [[kinship]] system of the Yadavas shows traces of [[matrilineal]] structure, which is found from the mention of their cross-cousin marriages. This is particularly prohibited in the [[Indo Aryan]] kinship system. < ref name= " thapar3 " > Thapar, Romila (1978, reprint 1996). ''Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations'', New Delhi: Orient Longman, {{ISBN|978-81-250-0808-8}}, pp.231,236 < /ref >  The Vishnu Purana mentions that Krishna married Rukmini, a Vidarbha princess. His son Pradyumna married Kakudvati, daughter of [[Rukmi|Rukmin]], brother of Rukmini. Pradyumna's son Aniruddha married Subhadra, granddaughter of Rukmin. < ref name= " wilson2 "  / >
