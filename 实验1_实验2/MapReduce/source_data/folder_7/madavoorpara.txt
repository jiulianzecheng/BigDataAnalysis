 ==History of Rock-Cut Temple== 
 Madavoorpara Shiva Temple, the most important attribute of the view point, dates back to the 9th century CE and is known for its architecture, as it was carved from a single rock. It is in the lowest part of the viewpoint. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2019/may/17/madavoorpara-this-8th-century-siva-temple-is-a-must-visit-1977873.html | title=Madavoorpara: This 8th century Siva temple is a must visit }} < /ref >  The cave temple is open from 6am to 10 am and from 5pm to pm everyday, maintaining its rituals and religious festivities regularly. It is also one of the rarest rock-cut temples in the state. On the pillars of the temple, an ancient [[Malayalam]] script, named ''Vattezhuthu'' had been inscribed which was used ages ago which is a rare sight. The main deity of the temple is Lord Shiva. 
 
 ==The View Point== 
 ===Bamboo Bridge=== 
 The Bamboo Bridge is one of the finest facilities that is stretched at a length of 100m. It provides the scenic beauty from the hill-top and is often used as a pathway to the topmost part of the rock. A lot of bamboo huts are established for the visitors to take rest and enjoy the venue. There is also an open stage built for future ventures including programmes, exhibitions and many more literary and cultural events. The bridge provides the finest experience of walking by foot especially during rainy seasons, when the water droplets are scattered on the bamboo and it makes it soothing for the visitors to walk along.  < ref > {{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/madavoorpara-on-the-outskirts-of-thiruvananthapuram-is-an-ideal-place-for-a-quick-getaway/article19214918.ece | title=Road Less Travelled: A view to a thrill | newspaper=The Hindu | date=5 July 2017 | last1=N | first1=Aswin V. }} < /ref >
