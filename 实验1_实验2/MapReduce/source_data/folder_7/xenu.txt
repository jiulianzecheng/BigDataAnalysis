[[Scientology]] teaches that '''Xenu''' (pronounced {{pron-en|ˈziːnuː}} (ZEE-noo)) was the [[dictator]] of a [[Galaxy|galactic]] [[Confederation|confederacy]] of 76 [[planet]]s, who was captured and imprisoned on [[Earth]] 75 million years ago after bringing billions of his people to Earth, placing them around [[volcano]]es and killing them by using [[hydrogen bomb]]s. < ref name= " galactictales " > {{cite news | last1 =Sappell | first1 =Joel | first2 =Robert W. | last2 =Welkos | title =Defining the Theology: The religion abounds in galactic tales | work =[[Los Angeles Times]] | page =11A | date =June 24, 1990 | url =http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-scientologysidea062490,0,4570654,full.story | accessdate =2009-01-21 | archive-date =2009-06-25 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090625211341/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-scientologysidea062490,0,4570654,full.story | url-status =dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " churchbattles " > {{cite news|last=Hargrove|first=Mary|date=March 10, 1992|title=Church battles critics - Mental treatment clashes with regulators, psychiatrists|page=1A|work=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=World Publishing Co.}} < /ref >  Scientologists believe he is still being kept there these days. Xenu is very important to the [[Religion|beliefs]] of Scientology because the story of Xenu explains the believed origin of what are known as [[body thetans]] from humans. Body thetans are believed to be the essence of Xenu's people that gather around humans and cause them spiritual harm. It is the purpose of [[Audit (Scientology)|auditing]] within Scientology to remove these thetans from the Scientologist. 
 
 The existence of Xenu has been reported by [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s writings and by Scientology spokesman [[Tommy Davis]] in an interview [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[affiliate]] [[KESQ-TV]].
