 '''Millet''' is a type of [[grain]] that is eaten. There are many types of millet. Millets are of good [[nutrition|nutritional value]]. 
 
 Millets also have high fiber content, and poor [[digestion|digestibility]] of [[nutrients]]. This limits their value in nutrition and makes them rather less acceptable to consumers. < ref > Sorghum and millet in human nutrition. 1995. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
