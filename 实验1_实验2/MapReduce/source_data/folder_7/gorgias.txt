 '''Gorgias''' ({{lang-grc|Γοργίας}}, ca. 487-376 BC), [[Greece|Greek]] [[sophist]], [[presocratic]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, was a native of [[Leontini]] in [[Sicily]]. Along with [[Protagoras]], he forms the first generation of [[Sophism|sophists]]. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of [[Empedocles]], although he would only have been a few years younger. 
 
 His theory was subjected of critique by [[Plato]] in his work ''[[Gorgias (Plato)|Gorgias]]''.
