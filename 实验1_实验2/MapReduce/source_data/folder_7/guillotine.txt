 The '''guillotine''' is a [[machine]] used to [[Execution|execute]] people by [[decapitation]] (chopping off their [[head]]s).  
 
 A guillotine is made of a heavy [[blade]] attached to a rack, which moves up and down on a vertical [[frame]]. When the executioner releases the rack, it will fall down and the blade will cut the [[convict]]'s head off. 
 
 == History == 
 Machines like the guillotine were first invented in the [[Middle Ages]], and were used throughout [[Europe]]. For example, [[Scotland]] used a machine called the  " Scottish Maiden " . 
 
 Such machines were not used in [[France]], until the [[French Revolution]] of [[1789]]. Instead, aristocrats were executed by beheading and ordinary criminals by [[Hanging (death)|hanging]]. The guillotine became the only legal way to execute someone in France. The guillotine was used because it caused a quick death.  Everyone, rich or poor, died the same way, no matter what [[social class]].   
 
 The guillotine was commonly used in [[France]] (including [[French colonial empire|France's colonies]]), [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]].  It was also used in [[Sweden]]. Today, all of these countries have abolished (legally stopped) the [[death penalty]].  The guillotine is no longer used. 
 
 == The invention of the guillotine == 
 === Joseph Guillotin === 
 [[File:Anonymous - Portrait de Joseph-Ignace Guillotin (1738-1814), médecin et homme politique. - P1052 - Musée Carnavalet (cropped).jpg|thumb|Joseph-Ignace Guillotin (1738-1814)]] 
 The guillotine is named after a [[French people|French]] [[medical doctor]], [[:en:Joseph-Ignace_Guillotin|Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]]. Guillotin was against the [[death penalty]]. Realising he could not stop the death penalty, Guillotin instead tried to think of a quicker, less painful way of executing people. On October 10, 1789, he suggested using a machine to do all the [[execution]]s.  
 
 The actual guillotine was designed by another doctor, Antoine Louis.  Guillotin did not help much with the design, but his name went down in history.  Against Guillotin's wishes, the new machine quickly became known as the  ''Guillotine''. Guillotin regretted this until death in 1814. 
 
 === Design === 
 The design for a quick, painless, decapitation machine was given to Tobias Schmidt, a [[Germany|German]] [[engineer]].  Schmidt built the first guillotine and tested it, on animals at first, but later on dead humans. It was made of two fourteen-foot uprights joined by a crossbar, whose inside edges were grooved and greased with [[fat|tallow]]; the weighted blade was either straight, or curved like an [[axe]]. The system was started by a [[rope]] and [[pulley]], while the whole construction was set up on a platform. The first execution was in 1792. 
 
 == Later use ==

 The guillotine was still the only [[legal]] way to execute a person in [[France]] until 1979, when France stopped using the [[death penalty]]. In [[Nazi Germany]], the guillotine was used to kill prisoners sentenced for serious crimes like [[murder]], [[treason]], or [[conspiracy]] against the government.  
 
 A guillotine was last used in [[West Germany]] in 1949 and [[East Germany]] in 1961.  The last person guillotined was the [[Tunisia]]n murderer Hamida Djandoubi in 1977.
