The '''Trajectory''' something follows is its path through [[space]] and [[time]]. If a [[cannon]] is fired, its shell will follow a certain path depending on how much [[Wikt:gunpowder|gunpowder]] was used, how heavy the [[Wikt:shell|shell]] is, and the [[Wikt:angle|angle]] up and down that the cannon is aimed at.
