 An '''Autotransformer''' (sometimes called '''''autostep down transformer''''') < ref > Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, ''The Art of Electronics Second Edition'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge MA, 1989, {{ISBN|0-521-37095-7}}, page 58 < /ref >  is a [[transformer]] which has only one [[Electromagnetic coil|winding]]. The  " [[wiktionary:auto-|auto]] "  ([[Greek language|Greek]] for  " self " ) prefix refers to the single [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] acting on itself and not to any kind of [[Automation|automatic mechanism]]. The winding acts as both primary winding and secondary winding in a normal transformer. Since part of the winding does  " double duty " , autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, < ref > John Winders, ''Power Transformers: Principles and Applications'' (New York; Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2002), p. 132 < /ref >  and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers. The disadvantage of an autotransformer include not providing [[Galvanic isolation|electrical isolation]] between the [[Transformer|primary winding]] and the [[Transformer|secondary winding]]. < ref name=Ghosh101 > Smarajit Ghosh, ''Electrical Machines'', Second Edition (Delhi: Pearson, 2012), p. 101 < /ref >  There is also a higher possibility of [[short circuit]]s due to low [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. < ref name=Ghosh101/ > 
 
 ==Usage== 
 Autotransformers are used in [[power transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|power distribution]], [[Sound recording|audio]], [[rail transport]], [[etc.]] Autotransformers are often used to step up (increase) or step down (decrease) [[voltage]]s in the 110–120 [[V]] range and in the 220–240 V range.
