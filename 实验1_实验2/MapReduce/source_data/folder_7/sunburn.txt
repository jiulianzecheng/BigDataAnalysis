 A '''sunburn''' is a kind of [[burn]] that happens when [[skin]] is exposed to [[sunlight]] for too long. The [[ultraviolet]] part of sunlight breaks down natural chemicals in the skin. This makes the skin become [[red]]. Sunburns stay for [[day]]s or [[week]]s. 
 
 People with lighter skin sunburn more quickly than people with darker skin. This is because of a dark [[pigment]] called [[melanin]] that protects the skin. There is more of it in dark-skinned people than in light-skinned people. Eventually, if exposed to too much sunlight, skin [[cancer]] may develop. In any event, sunburn can be ''extremely'' painful.
