 '''Mating''' is the pairing of opposite-[[sex]] or [[hermaphrodite]] [[organism]]s. It is usually for [[sexual reproduction]]. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mating|title=Mate|author=The Free Dictionary|access-date=May 31, 2013}} < /ref > < ref > The Penguin ''Dictionary of Biology'' does not list the term. < /ref >  Other definitions extend the term to crossing in [[plants]] and [[fungi]]. It is usual for mating in [[plants]] or [[fungi]] to be called cross-[[fertilization]], or  " crossing "  if the offspring have [[DNA]] from both genetic sources. < ref > Note Darwin's titles (short form): ''[[Fertilisation of orchids]]'', and ''[[Cross and self fertilisation]]''. < /ref >   
 
 [[Copulation]] is the union of the [[sex organ]]s of two sexually reproducing animals for internal fertilization. [[Fertilization]] is the actual fusion of [[gamete]]s. < ref > {{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary|title='Fertilization' - definition of|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fertilization|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|access-date=25 January 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 Mating may also lead to external fertilization. This is done by [[amphibians]], most [[fish]], many lower animals, and plants. Many aquatic species just spread their eggs and sperm in the water at one specific time of year. That time varies between species.  
 
 For some [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] species, copulation is not needed because the parent organism can self-fertilize ([[Reproduction#Autogamy|autogamy]]). In some [[flowering plants]] self-pollination can happen within the same [[flower]], and some [[hermaphrodite]] animals self-fertilize. Many [[gastropods]] are hermaphrodite, and do simultaneous copulation in pairs. So do [[earthworms]].  
 
 In some birds, mating includes behaviors such as [[nest]]-building and [[nutrition|feed]]ing offspring. The human practice of [[artificial insemination]] of [[domesticated]] animals is part of [[animal husbandry]].
