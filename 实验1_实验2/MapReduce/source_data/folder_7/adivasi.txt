The '''Adivasi people''' of [[India]] look very different from the [[Dravidian]]s and [[Aryan]]s. Adivasi people face discrimination and it's hard for them to get jobs in the city areas. These groups have survived in the forest and mountain regions in India for many years. They were the first to inhabit India. 
 
 Adivasi people are facing discrimination for their skin color, their beliefs and their [[ethnicity]].
