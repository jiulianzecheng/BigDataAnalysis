 ==People== 
 Jejemons started to appear because of [[cellphone]]s. Cellphones can only use 160 characters so people who use them write shorter words to save space. Jejemons don't want this so they made their words longer. < ref name= " MB 1 " / > < ref name= " CNET " / > < ref name= " PDI " / > < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideLifestyle.htm?f=2010/april/30/lifestyle4.isx & d=2010/april/30 |title=The jejemon phenom |date=2010-04-30 |work=Manila Standard Today |accessdate=2010-05-01 |archive-date=2010-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503102350/http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideLifestyle.htm?f=2010/april/30/lifestyle4.isx & d=2010/april/30 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on [[Leet]].
