'''Defection''' is when a person leaves their home country in a way the home country claims to be illegal. To the first country, they can be seen as [[Treason|traitors]]. 
 It is a political label used by [[authoritarian]] countries. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defector|title=Definition of DEFECTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226091416/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defector|archive-date=2015-02-26}} < /ref > 
 
 More broadly, it involves abandoning a person, cause, or doctrine to which one is bound by some tie. The tie may be one of allegiance or of duty. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defection |title=Defection  & #124; Define Defection at Dictionary.com |access-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403075045/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defection |archive-date=2011-04-03 }}  " de·fec·tion [dih-fek-shuhn] ''noun'' (1.) desertion from allegiance, loyalty, duty, or the like; apostasy: His defection to East Germany was regarded as treasonable.

 An example of this today are [[North Korea]]ns who escape the country to live in a new country, such as [[South Korea]] or the [[United States]]. The North Korean government makes leaving the country without permission illegal, and punishments for this are extremely harsh. Escapees who are caught usually get sent to a prison camp or are publicly put to death. There have been around 33,000 '''defectors''' from North Korea since the [[North Korean famine]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Policy on North Korean Defectors <  Data  &  Statistics <  South-North Relations <  통일부_영문|url=https://www.unikorea.go.kr/eng_unikorea/relations/statistics/defectors/|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.unikorea.go.kr}} < /ref >
