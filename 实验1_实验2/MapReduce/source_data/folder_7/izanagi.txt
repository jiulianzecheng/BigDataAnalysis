 {{nihongo|'''Izanagi'''|イザナギ||recorded in the [[Kojiki]] as 伊弉諾}} is a [[deity]] of [[kami]] who was a child of the seven divine generations in [[Japanese mythology]] and [[Shinto|Shintoism]], and is also referred to in the roughly translated Kojiki as  " male who invites " , or '''Izanagi-no-mikoto'''. 
 
 He and his wife [[Izanami]] [[creation myth|created]] many islands, deities, and forefathers of Japan. When Izanami died while giving birth to a child, Izanagi tried (but failed) to retrieve her from [[Yomi]] (the [[underworld]]). In the cleansing rite after his return, he created [[Amaterasu]] (the [[sun]] goddess) from his left eye, [[Tsukuyomi]] (the [[moon]] god) from his right eye, and [[Susanoo]] (tempest or [[storm]] god) from his nose. 
 When Izanagi looks at his wife in Yomi, he sees her monstrous and hellish state and she is ashamed and angry. She chases him in order to kill him. She fails, but promises to kill a thousand of his people every day. Izanagi says that he will create a thousand and five hundred every day.
