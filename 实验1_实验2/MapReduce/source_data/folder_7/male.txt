 '''Male''' is one of two biological sexes. Most species have two [[sex]]es {{ndash}} male and [[female]]. [[Human]] males are usually [[man|men]] or [[boy]]s; human females are usually [[woman|women]] or [[girl]]s (Except if their [[gender]] doesn't correlate with their sex assigned at birth).  
 
 The two sexes have different [[sex organ|sexual organs]], and different [[secondary sex characteristic]]s. They also often have different biological functions. The female sexual organs can give [[birth]] to [[child]]ren with the [[semen]] provided by the male.  
 
 In many human [[society|societies]], females often were involved in gathering, while men used to hunt, but over the course of time, [[Gender equality]] has been (or is being) recognized in more and more countries.
