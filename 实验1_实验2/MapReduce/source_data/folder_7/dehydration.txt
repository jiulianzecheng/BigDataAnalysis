'''Dehydration''' ('''hypohydration''') means less [[water]] in something. The word comes from the [[ancient Greek]] word for water, ''hydor''.

 == What causes dehydration? == 
 A living organism will get dehydrated if their body is losing water in some way and they do not drink enough to replace the water.  The most common causes of dehydration are: < ref name= " Dehydration " / >   
 * Sweating a lot (because of hot weather or exercise)  
 * Bad [[diarrhea]]  
 * [[Vomit]]ing (throwing up)  
 * [[Urination|Urinating]] more than usual (this can happen if a person has uncontrolled [[diabetes]] or takes [[medication|medicines]] like [[diuretic]]s which cause them to urinate more often)  
 * [[Fever]] 
 
 == Who gets dehydration? == 
 Any living being can get dehydrated.  Some people are [[Risk factor|more at risk]] of dehydration. [[Elderly]] people, very young children, and people with [[chronic]] illnesses are at the highest risk for dehydration. < ref name= " Dehydration " / > 
 
 == Symptoms == 
 Dehydrated people may have different [[symptom]]s depending on how dehydrated they are.  If dehydration is not treated, it will get worse.  As dehydration gets worse, the symptoms get more dangerous. 
 
 When people start to get dehydrated, they may have these symptoms: < ref name=nlm > {{cite web|last1=Kaneshiro|first1=Neil K.|title=Dehydration|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000982.htm|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=10 June 2014}} < /ref > < ref name= " Shirreffs SM, Merson SJ, Fraser SM, Archer DT 951–8 " > {{cite journal |author=Shirreffs SM, Merson SJ, Fraser SM, Archer DT |title=The effects of fluid restriction on hydration status and subjective feelings in man |journal=Br.

 * Being very thirsty 
 * Feeling irritable and [[Confusion|confused]] ([[infant]]s and children may be very fussy or get very sleepy) 
 * Very dry mouth and [[mucous membrane]]s 
 * Shriveled, dry skin that is less elastic than normal (it  < span > doesn't  " bounce back "  when pinched into a fold) < /span > 
 * Urinating very little, with darkly colored urine, or not urinating at all 
 * Sunken eyes 
 * In infants, the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head) may be sunken 
 * [[hypotension|Low blood pressure]] ([[blood pressure]] may also drop when the person sits up or stands up, making them feel dizzy or [[Fainting|faint]]; this is called orthostasis) 
 * Fast heartbeat ([[tachycardia]]) 
 * Fast breathing (tachypnea) 
 * Fever 
 * In the most serious cases, [[delirium]] or [[unconsciousness]] 
 
 Severe dehydration is a [[medical emergency]].  If a person with severe dehydration does not get medical treatment soon enough, they can die. 
 
 == What problems may dehydration cause? == 
 Bad dehydration can cause serious health problems. Some of these problems are: 
 * '''Heat injury.'''  When it is very hot outside, or when a person is exercising a lot, [[fluid]]s like water help keep the body cool.  If the person is dehydrated, their body can overheat (it gets too hot and cannot cool itself down).  This can cause heat injury.  The mildest (least serious) form of heat injury is heat cramps (cramping, or [[pain]], in the [[muscles]]).  As heat injury gets worse, it becomes heat exhaustion.  If the body keeps overheating and the person does not get medical treatment, heat exhaustion becomes heat stroke.  Heat stroke is a very serious medical emergency.  People with heat stroke can have damage to their organs and even die if they do not get treatment quickly enough. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/pediatrics/heat-related_illnesses_heat_cramps_heat_exhaustion_heat_stroke_90,P01611/ |title=Heat-Related Illnesses (Heat Cramps, Heat Exhaustion, Heat Stroke) |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine Health Library |accessdate=2015-01-01}} < /ref > 
 * '''[[Inflammation|Swelling]] of the [[brain]] ([[cerebrum|cerebral]] [[edema]]).'''  Sometimes the body tries to fix dehydration by pulling a lot of water into its [[cell]]s.  If the body pulls too much water into the cells, those cells can swell and break.  If this happens to the cells in the brain, the brain can swell. < ref name= " Dehydration " / >    
 * '''[[Seizure]]s.'''  When a person gets dehydrated, their [[electrolyte]]s can get out of balance.  Electrolytes are important salts in the body which carry [[electricity]].  When electrolytes like [[Hyponatremia|sodium]] and [[potassium]] get out of balance, the body's electrical signals can get mixed up.  This can cause seizures. < ref name= " Dehydration " / >    
 * '''Shock.'''  Fluid is an important part of human [[blood]].  Water makes up most of [[blood plasma]], which carries [[blood cell]]s and other important things to the entire body.  If a person gets very dehydrated, the amount of blood in the body drops.  This causes low blood pressure.  If a person does not have enough blood and oxygen in their body, they can go into shock.  In medicine, this is called hypovolemic shock. < ref > {{cite web |last=Heller |first=Jacob |title=Hypovolemic Shock |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000167.htm |date=2014-01-13 |publisher=Medline Plus |accessdate=2015-01-01}} < /ref > 
 * '''[[Kidney failure]].'''  Bad dehydration can hurt the [[kidney]]s.  When the kidneys are hurt or not working properly, they cannot remove [[Toxin|poisons]] and extra fluid from the blood. < ref name= " Dehydration " / > 
 
 == How is dehydration treated? == 
 To fix dehydration, a person has to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they have lost. < ref name= " Dehydration " / > 
 
 When dehydration is not too bad, people can usually treat themselves by drinking. < ref name= " Dehydration " / >    This is called [[oral rehydration therapy]].  Stores sell special drinks like Pedialyte and [[Gatorade]], which have both water and electrolytes in them.  People can also make their own [[oral]] rehydration [[solution]] (a drink which treats dehydration) by mixing water with [[sugar]] and [[salt]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/fch_cah_06_1/en/ |title=Oral Rehydration Salts |date=2009 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2015-01-01}} < /ref > 
 
 People with very bad dehydration need emergency medical treatment.  They may need to get fluids intravenously (through a needle placed into a [[vein]]).  This replaces lost fluids and electrolytes much more quickly than drinking.  It is also helpful for people who are unable to drink because of [[nausea]] and vomiting from dehydration. < ref name= " Dehydration " / >
