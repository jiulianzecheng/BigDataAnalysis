 An '''emulsion''' is what you get when you put two or more liquids together and the two liquids do not [[mixing|mix]]. Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. These droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Emulsion - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/emulsion|access-date=2021-09-04|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends, a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils, and a hydrophobic end (water-hating [[lipophile]]) that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What Is an Emulsion?
