:''This article is about the kind of address that you find or communicate with someone through. Address can also mean [[public speaking]]. It can also be used when someone is working on something, or talking about something.'' 
 
 An '''address''' (pronounced AD-dress or ad-DRESS) is a way to find or [[Communication|communicate]] with someone. It can be a '''postal address''' or an '''[[E-mail|e-mail address]]'''. On forms, it is common to ask for someone's [[name]], address and [[phone number]], so that the person can be found easily. 
 
 == Postal address == 
 A '''postal address''' is usually the location of someone's house, but sometimes it is the person's [[Post Office Box]]. It is the [[information]] that is put on a [[letter]] to have the letter delivered to a person. 
 
 Example (in England): 
 :Mr John Smith 
 :132, My Street, 
 :Bigtown  BG23 4YZ 
 :England 
 
 Example (in the U.S.): 
 :Mr John Smith 
 :132, My Street, 
 :Kingston, New York 12401 
 :United States 
 
 Example (in Nigeria): 
 :Mr Daniel Izuchukwu Nwoye 
 :8, My Street, 
 :Ilassan Lekki, Lagos 105102 
 :Nigeria. 
 
 ==Email Address== 
 An '''email address''' is used to send someone an [[e-mail]]. It has a [[username]], and this is followed by the name of the person's email provider. The at sign (@) separates the two. For example: 
 :john@[[Gmail|gmail.com]] 
 :horseycrazy@[[Yahoo!|yahoo.com]] 
 :larry.smith@[[MSN Corporation|msn.com]] 
 :example50150@domain.eu

 The  " name "  part can be made up of any letters or numbers, and a few special characters, but it cannot contain spaces. The  " provider "  part can be made up of any letters or numbers, but no special characters and no spaces. Some providers may restrict the  " name "  part in other ways. For example, [[Gmail]] does not allow underscores.
