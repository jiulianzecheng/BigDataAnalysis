 '''Leather''' is the [[skin]] of an [[animal]] made into a durable [[material]] by [[tanning]]. The skins of [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[Domestic goat|goat]]s are often used to make leather. Skins of [[snake]]s, [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s, and [[ostrich]]es are sometimes used to make fancier leather. [[Shoe]]s, [[bag]]s, [[clothes]], and [[ball]]s are often made of leather.  Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, giraffes, and African elephants.  All of these ways of making leather are very simple but some are rare. 
 
 == How leather is made == 
 The way leather is made is divided into three processes. They are preparing the leather, [[tanning]] it, and crusting. 
 
 In preparing the leather, many things are done to make it ready for tanning. They include soaking it, removing the [[hair]], [[liming]], [[deliming]], [[Bathing|bating]], [[bleaching]], and [[pickling]]. 
 
 [[Tanning]] is a process that makes the [[Protein|proteins]], especially [[collagen]], in the raw hide stable. It increases the thermal and chemical [[stability]] of the animal [[Skin|skins]]. The difference between fresh and tanned animal skin is that fresh animal skin dries to make it hard and stiff. When water is added to it, it becomes bad. But, animal skin that is tanned dries to make it [[wikt:flexible|flexible]]. It does not become bad when water is added to it. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76788460|title=Conservation of leather and related materials|last=Kite|first=Marion|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|others=Roy Thomson|isbn=0-08-045466-6|location=Oxford|pages=1-3|oclc=76788460}} < /ref > 
 
 Crusting is a process that makes the leather thin and [[Lubrication|lubricates]] it. Chemicals added when crusting must be set in place. Crusting ends with drying and making the leather soft. It may include splitting, shaving, [[dyeing]], [[Whitening (leather processing)|whitening]] or other methods. 
 
 ==From other animals== 
 Today, most leather is made from the skin of [[cattle]], which makes up about 67% of all the leather made. Other animals that are used include [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] (about 12%), [[Pig|pigs]] (about 11%), and [[Domestic goat|goats]] (about 10%). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Statistics  &  Sources of Information {{!}} ICT Leather|url=https://leather-council.org/information/statistics-sources-of-information/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007173853/https://leather-council.org/information/statistics-sources-of-information/|archive-date=7 October 2022|access-date=6 December 2022|website=leather-council.org}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Horse]] skin is used to make strong leather. Lamb and deerskin are used for soft leather. It is used in work gloves and indoor shoes. 
 
 [[Kangaroo]] leather is used to make things that must be strong and flexible. It is used in bullwhips. 
 
 In [[Thailand]], [[stingray]] leather is used in wallets and belts. Stingray leather is tough and durable.
