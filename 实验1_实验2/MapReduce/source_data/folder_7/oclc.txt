 == OCLC control numbers == 
 OCLC gives a special number (called  " OCN "  for  " OCLC Control Number " ) to every new record in WorldCat. A record is [[metadata]] about books and things like books. Every record has a different number. There are more than a billion numbers, and there are more every day. Old numbers are small and new numbers are big. 
 
 OCNs help find books and things like books that do not have [[ISBN]]s. Many books from before 1970 do not have ISBNs. OCNs are often used for books in Wikipedia and [[Wikidata]].
