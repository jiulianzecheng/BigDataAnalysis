 In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Aloadae''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλωάδαι}}, ''Aloadai'') were a a pair of giants, sons of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal princess Iphimedia. Their names were '''Otos''' and '''Ephialtes''' ({{lang-el|Ὦτος}} and {{lang|el|Ἐφιάλτης}}), and they attempted to storm [[Mount Olympus]] in order to seize the goddesses [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]] and make them their wives. (Otos wanted Artemis and Ephialtes wanted Hera). [[Ares]], the god of war, tried to stop them, but was defeated and imprisoned for thirteen months in a bronze jar. [[Artemis]] then raced between them in the form of a deer; they both cast their spears to hit her but missed and instead struck each other dead.
