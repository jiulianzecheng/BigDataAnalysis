The '''Blunderbuss''' is a short, [[muzzleloader|muzzleloading]] [[smoothbore]] [[gun]], similar to a [[musket]] or [[carbine]] but has a bigger barrel designed for multiple [[Bullet|pellets]] to be put in. It is considered to be a precursor to the [[shotgun]]. A blunderbuss in [[handgun]] shape was called a ''dragon'' which made way for the word ''[[dragoon]]''. < ref name=scott > {{cite book|title=The British Army: Its Origin, Progress, and Equipment|author=Sibbald Mike Lier|year=1868|publisher=Cassell, Petter, Galpin|pages=33, 302–304}} < /ref > < ref name=mildict > {{cite book|title=A Military Dictionary |url=https://archive.org/details/militarydictiona00voyliala |author=George Elliot Voyle, G. de Saint-Clair-Stevenson|year=1876|publisher=W.

 ==Etymology== 
 [[File:English flintlock blunderbuss.jpeg|alt=|thumb|An English flintlock blunderbuss.]] 
 
 The term  " blunderbuss "  is from the [[Dutch language]], from the Dutch word ''donderbuis'', which is a fusion of ''donder'', meaning  " thunder " , and ''buis'', meaning  " Pipe "  (Middle Dutch: ''busse'', box, tube, from [[Late Latin]], ''buxis'', box, from [[Ancient Greek]] ''pyxίs'' (πυξίς), box: esp. from [[boxwood]]). 
 
 The evolution from ''donder'' to ''blunder'' is thought by few to be done on purpose; the term ''blunder'' was originally used in a [[transitive verb|transitive]] sense, synonymous with ''to confuse'', and this is thought to describe the very loud sound of the large-bore, short-barreled blunderbuss. The term ''dragon'' is taken from detail of older models that were designed with a carving in the shape of a [[dragon]]'s head around the barrel; the muzzle blast would then give the impression of a fire-breathing dragon.
