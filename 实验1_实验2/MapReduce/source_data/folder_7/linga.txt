 A '''linga''' or a '''lingam''' is a very complex [[Phallus]] symbol of [[Hinduism]]. It is associated with [[Shiva]], supreme god in main [[Deity|gods]] of the [[Hindu]]s. The [[Hindu scripture]]s say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the [[temple]]s of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a [[Circumcised]] linga. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.islam-hinduism.com/shiv-ling-sign-circumcision-hinduism/ | title=Shiv Ling: A Sign of Circumcision in Hinduism | date=21 March 2017 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://english.newstracklive.com/news/maybe-shiv-ji-has-also-been-circumcised-delhi-university-professors-shoddy-remark-in-gyanvapi-case-ta303-1229211-1.html | title='Maybe Shiv ji has also been circumcised...', Delhi University professor's shoddy remark in Gyanvapi case | date=18 May 2022 }} < /ref > 
 The Hindu scriptures also say that Shiva took twelve forms as [[Jyotirlinga]], that is, ''a linga of light''. In India, there are twelve places where this form of Shiva is worshiped. The Hindu scriptures also tell about five more forms of lingas. These form of lingas represent the [[earth]], the [[water]], the [[fire]], the [[air]] and the [[sky]] (or ether). There are five different places in India where Hindus worship these forms of Shiva. These places are located at the following locations: 
 
 * [[Kanchipuram]]: God Shiva’s linga in the form of the earth 
 * [[Srirangam]]: God Shiva’s linga in the form of the water 
 * [[Tiruvannamalai]]: God Shiva’s linga in the form of the fire 
 * [[Kalahasti]]: God Shiva’s linga in the form of the air 
 * [[Chidambaram]]: God Shiva’s linga in the form of the sky (or ether) 
 
 Beside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shiva’s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://openthemagazine.com/lounge/books/the-cult-of-the-lingam/ | title=The Cult of the Lingam | date=18 June 2021 }} < /ref >
