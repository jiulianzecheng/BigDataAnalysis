'''Hypoglycemia''' is when the level of [[blood sugar]] is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per [[deciliter]].  All of the [[cell]]s in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive.  When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally. 
 
 Hypoglycemia can cause many [[symptom]]s.  Some common symptoms are [[nausea]], feeling hungry, [[sweating]], feeling sad, and [[heart]] palpitations (feeling the heart pounding).  Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are [[Drunkenness|drunk]] or have taken [[Illegal drugs|drugs]].  Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a [[stroke]].    
 
 Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic]].  It is often a [[complication]] of treatment for diabetes with [[insulin]] or oral [[medication]]s.  
 
 Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal.  Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating.  In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water [[Intravenous|intravenously]] (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the [[liver]] is able to handle the issue by making glucose. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Gluconeogenesis - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gluconeogenesis|access-date=2021-05-04|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Glycogenolysis {{!}} biochemistry|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/glycogenolysis|access-date=2021-05-04|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[brain]] and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar.  Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like [[seizure]]s) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough.
