 A '''hyperparasite''' is a [[parasite]] (or [[parasitoid]]) which is parasitic on another parasite. Usually, this means it is parasitic on the [[larva]]l stage of the victim species. 
 
 Typical examples are members of the [[Apocrita]], and some species in two other insect [[order (biology)|orders]], the [[Diptera]] (true flies) and [[Coleoptera]] (beetles). Seventeen families in the [[Hymenoptera]] and a few [[species]] of [[Diptera]] and [[Coleoptera]] are hyperparasitic. < ref name= " Sullivan2009 " > {{cite book |last1=Sullivan |first1=Daniel J. |title=Encyclopedia of Insects |chapter=Hyperparasitism |year=2009 |pages=486â€“488 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-374144-8.00138-7|isbn=9780123741448 }} < /ref >   
 
 Primary parasitism in the Hymenoptera evolved in the [[Jurassic]] period about 135 million years ago. < ref name= " Sullivan2009 " / >   
 
 ==In literature== 
 [[Jonathan Swift]] refers to hyperparasitism in these lines from his poem  < br/ > " On Poetry: A Rhapsody " : < ref name= " Swift1733 " > {{cite book |author=Swift, Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Swift |title=On Poetry: A Rapsody |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmIJAAAAQAAJ |access-date=20 May 2013 |year=1733 |publisher=And sold by J. Huggonson, next to Kent's Coffee-house, near Serjeant's-inn, in Chancery-lane; [and] at the bookseller's and pamphletshops}} < /ref > 
 
 So nat'ralists observe, a flea < br/ > 
 Hath smaller fleas that on him prey; < br/ > 
 And these have smaller fleas to bite 'em. < br/ > 
 And so proceeds ''ad infinitum''. 
 
 ==Number of levels== 
 Three levels of parasitism have been seen in [[fungi]] (a fungus on a fungus on a fungus on a tree). < ref name= " hyperhyper " > {{cite web |url=http://www.funnz.org.nz/sites/default/files/MycNotes4-FungiCubed.pdf |title=Fungi Cubed}} < /ref >
