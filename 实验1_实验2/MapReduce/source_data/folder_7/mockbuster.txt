They are made to be released [[direct-to-video]] at the same time that the original [[movie]] is released in theaters or on video. 
 
 Mockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted. For example, someone may think that they are buying ''[[Transformers (movie)|Transformers]]'', but they are actually buying ''Transmorphers'', a mockbuster that was released in 2007. < ref name= " Potts " > {{cite news

 Many mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original [[movie]] was made in. There are many [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]] and [[Brazil]]ian versions of [[United States|American]] movies, as well as [[sequel]]s that were not made by the people who made the original movie. Animated movie mockbusters are ''Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale'', a rip-off of ''[[Charlotte's Web]]''; ''[[Ratatoing]]'', a rip-off of ''[[Ratatouille (movie)|Ratatouille]]''); ''The Little Panda Fighter'' and ''Chop Kick Panda'', rip-offs of ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', and many more movie mockbusters.
