 The '''Piankeshaw''', '''Piankashaw''' or '''Pianguichia''' Indigenous Peoples are [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and members of the [[Miami Indians]]. They lived away from the rest of the Miami nation, therefore they were known as '''Peeyankihšiaki''' ( " splitting off "  from the others, Sing.: ''Peeyankihšia'' -  " Piankeshaw Person " ). They live in an area that now includes western [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]]. They are closely allied with the [[Wea]] Indians.
