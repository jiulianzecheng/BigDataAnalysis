 == History == 
 [[Nguni languages|Nguni]]-speaking [[settler]]s were probably the first people to live in the river valley that later became the location of the city of Pretoria. 
 
 Pretoria was [[:wikt:found|founded]] in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius]]. He was a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]]. Pretoruis named the city after his father [[Andries Pretorius]]. Andries Pretorius had become a [[hero]] of the Voortrekkers after the [[Battle of Blood River]]. The city became the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) on May 1, 1860. 
 
 During the [[First Boer War]], the city was [[wikt:attack|attacked]] in December 1880 and March 1881. The [[peace treaty]] which ended the [[war]] was signed in Pretoria on August 3, 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]]. 
 
 The [[Second Boer War]] (1899 to 1902) caused the end of the South African Republic. After this war, the [[United Kingdom]] took control of South Africa. During the war, [[Winston Churchill]] was [[prison|imprisoned]] in the Staats Model School in Pretoria. He later got free and went to [[Mozambique]]. The city [[wikt:surrender|surrender]]ed to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military|forces]] on June 5, 1900. The war ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on May 31 1902. 
 
 In 1910, Pretoria then became the [[Administration|administrative]] capital of all of South Africa, with Cape Town the [[legislature|legislative]] capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal]]. On 14 October 1931, Pretoria got official [[city]] status. When South Africa became a [[republic]] in 1961, Pretoria stayed its administrative capital. 
 
 Pretoria was at one time seen as  " the capital of [[Apartheid]] South Africa " . This was changed when [[Nelson Mandela]] became the country's first black [[President of South Africa|President]].
