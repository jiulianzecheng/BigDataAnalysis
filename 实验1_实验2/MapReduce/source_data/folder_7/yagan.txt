 Yagan was the son of Midgigoroo, one of the elders of the tribe who lived in the Perth area. < ref name=adb/ >  Yagan was blamed for spearing cattle near the [[Swan River]]. There were not many cattle in the new colony and food was scarce. Yagan's taking of the settlers animals and food supplies was seen as a very serious crime. After a European was killed, the military started a search for Yagan. He was found after four months and sent to [[Carnac Island]]. He escaped after six weeks. One of the soldiers who had got to know him on Carnac Island, compared him to [[William Wallace]]. < ref name=adb/ > 
 
 Yagan's brother was killed in April 1833 while trying to steal flour from a cart. Yagan, Midgigoroo and several others attacked another cart and killed the drivers. < ref name=adb/ >  They were declared [[outlaw]]s, which meant they had no legal rights and could be killed by anyone. A reward of £30 was offered for their capture. < ref name=adb/ >  Midgigoroo was soon captured and [[executed]]. Two months later, on 11 July 1833 a [[shepherd]], William Keates, shot and killed Yagan. < ref name=adb/ >  Keates was killed soon afterwards in another fight with the Aborigines, and his brother claimed the reward for the capture of Yagan. < ref name=adb/ >  Yagan's head was cut off and sent to England for display. < ref name=nma > {{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/first_australians/resistance/yagan |title=National Museum of Australia - Yagan's story |first= |last= |work=nma.gov.au |year=2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-date=7 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507063043/http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/first_australians/resistance/yagan |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 After a long search his remains were rediscovered in an unmarked grave in [[Liverpool]] and returned to Australia in 1997. < ref name=nma/ >  On 10 July 2010, Yangar was reburied in Perth, at a site now called the Yagan Memorial Park. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.noongarculture.org.au/noongars/yagan.aspx |title=Kaartdijin Noongar - Sharing Noongar Culture |first= |last= |work=noongarculture.org.au |year=2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The park is on the site where Yagan was killed in 1833. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.swanvalley.com.au/Lists/Attractions/Yagan_Memorial_Park |title=Yagan Memorial Park |first= |last= |work=swanvalley.com.au |year=2012 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-date=20 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820085651/http://www.swanvalley.com.au/Lists/Attractions/Yagan_Memorial_Park |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
