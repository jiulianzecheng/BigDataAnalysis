 '''Karaoke''' is music-only (no singing) performance. It originated in Okayama Prefecture, [[Japan]], and was originally used by professional singers to practice before recording. It is also called a '''backing track'''. Since the 1970s, they have been sold for general use. In the mid-1980s, the popularity of laser discs broke out and became a big hit. When using laser discs, the lyrics appear on the screen, so you don't have to hold the lyrics like you did before, and you can sing in the same way.
