'''Andrology''' is the study of male health, especially male sexual organs and reproduction.  
 It is similar to the study of women's health, called [[gynaecology]]. Andrology has only been studied since the late [[1960s]]. The first specialist journal on the subject was the [[Germany|German]] periodical ''Andrologie'', published from [[1969]] onwards. < ref > ''Social Studies of Science'' (1990) '''20''', p. 32 < /ref > 
 
 Men are more susceptible to [[heart disease]] than women. They also usually have a slightly shorter natural [[average life span]]. However, men get many conditions, such as [[osteoporosis]], less than women.
