 '''Surveying''' is the [[Skill|technique]] and [[science]] of accurately finding out the [[position]] < ref > terrestrial or three-dimensional space < /ref >  of points and the distances and [[angle]]s between them. These points are usually, but not always, associated with positions on the surface of the [[Earth]]. They are often used to make land [[maps]] and boundaries for [[ownership]] of land. A person who does the surveying is called a [[surveyor]]. In order to find the information they need, surveyors use [[geometry]], [[engineering]], [[trigonometry]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[geology]] and [[law]]. 
 
 Surveying has been very important in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history (ca. 5000 years ago) and it is a requirement planning of nearly every form of [[construction]]. Its most common uses are in the fields of [[transport]], [[building]] and construction, [[communication]]s, mapping, and the making of legal boundaries for land ownership. 
 
 == Origins == 
 Surveying has existed throughout much of our history.  In [[ancient Egypt]], when the [[Nile River]] overflowed its banks and washed out [[farm]] boundaries, the boundaries were recreated by surveyors using simple [[geometry]]. The construction of the pyramids, including the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]] (built c. 2700 BC) show us that the Ancient [[Egypt]]ians used surveying efficiently. 
 
 ==Surveyor== 
 
 A '''surveyor''' is a person who has the skills to accurately find out the [[position]] of points and the distances and [[angle]]s between them. These points are usually, positions on the surface of the [[Earth]]. Finding these points is called  " surveying " . Surveyors are needed to make land [[maps]] and boundaries for [[ownership]] of land. In order to find the information they need, surveyors use [[geometry]], [[engineering]], [[trigonometry]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[law]]. 
 
 There are different types of surveyor. A construction or building surveyor is the person who has to make sure that buildings are being put up in the correct place and fit in with planning and building laws. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://aibs.businesscatalyst.com/fabs/about_building_surveyors |title=About Building Surveyors |first= |last= |work=aibs.businesscatalyst.com |year=2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511062654/http://aibs.businesscatalyst.com/fabs/about_building_surveyors |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  A [[quantity surveyor]] is the person who keeps track of costs on a building project.  A [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] surveyor measures features to do with water, such as rivers, lakes and oceans.  A [[marine surveyor]] inspects ships.  A mine surveyor is the person who finds out the position of underground mines, for example gold mines or coal mines. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.minesurveyors.com.au/default.php |title=AIMS - The Australian Institute of Mine Surveyors |first= |last= |work=minesurveyors.com.au |year=2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archive-date=16 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216054206/http://www.minesurveyors.com.au/default.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
