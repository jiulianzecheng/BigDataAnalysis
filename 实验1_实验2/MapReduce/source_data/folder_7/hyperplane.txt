 A '''hyperplane''' is a space composed of 1 less dimension than the space that it occupies. Visually, a hyperplane in a two-dimensional space (a [[:en:Cartesian_coordinate_system|Cartesian plane]]) would be a line, which is one-dimensional. A hyperplane in a three-dimensional space would be a plane, or some surface, which is two-dimensional.
