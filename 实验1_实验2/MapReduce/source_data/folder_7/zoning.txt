'''Zoning''' is a method of [[urban planning]]. A [[local government]] divides land into areas called zones. Each of these has regulations for new development different from other zones.  
 
 Zones may be defined for a single use (e.g. residential, industrial), or they may combine several uses. Regulations may govern the density, size and shape of buildings, whatever their use.  
 
 Zoning laws that limit the construction of new housing may be a big factor in [[segregation]] in the [[United States]] by income and race. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Monkkonen |first1=Paavo |title=The Elephant in the Zoning Code: single family zoning in the housing supply discussion |journal=Housing Policy Debate |date=2019 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=41–43 |doi=10.1080/10511482.2018.1506392|s2cid=158380453 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2hk5k1k6 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Knaap |first1=Gerrit‐Jan |last2=Meck |first2=Stuart |last3=Moore |first3=Terry |last4=Parker |first4=Robert |title=Do we know regulatory barriers when we see them?

 Some countries, like the [[United Kingdom]], have town planning, but not strict zoning
