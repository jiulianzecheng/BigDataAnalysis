 The '''Oomycota''' are a [[class (biology)|class]] in a huge [[phylum]] of [[eukaryotic]] [[microorganisms]] called the [[heterokont]]s. '''Oomycetes''' are a distinct [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] line of [[fungus]]-like [[microorganism]]s. 
 
 They are not actually fungi, though some have filaments as fungi do. Like fungi, they are [[Saprophyte|saprophytic]] and [[pathogen]]ic. also like fungi, oomycetes rarely have septa, < ref > Septum: a wall which divides one cell from another. < /ref >  and if they do, they are scarce. < ref > Kortekamp A.

 They are microscopic organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes are some of the most prolific [[pathogens]] of [[plant]]s, causing devastating diseases such as [[potato blight]] and sudden oak death. 
 
 They are often referred to as '''water moulds''' (or [[mould]]s), although the water-loving nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens.

 Most oomycetes produce two types of spores. The main dispersing spores are asexual, self-mobile [[spore]]s called [[zoospore]]s. These do [[chemotaxis]] toward a food source in surface water. A few oomycetes produce asexual spores that are distributed by wind. Oomycetes also produce sexual spores, called  " oospores " . These are [[translucent]], double-walled, spherical structures which can survive harsh conditions.
