 Waluigi is very tall and thin. He wears black overalls with a purple shirt, and has brown, pointed shoes. He has upside-down Ls (Γs) on hat, gloves and mustache which is a Greek letter [[Gamma]], and is the evil [[counterpart]] to [[Luigi]]. 
 
 He was made as a partner for [[Wario]] by the company [[Camelot]] in [[Mario Tennis and]] other Mario spinoff games and has no real story behind him. He is in ''[[Super Smash Bros.
