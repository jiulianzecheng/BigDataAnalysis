 '''Roraima''' is one of the [[States of Brazil|states]] of [[Brazil]]. It is in the northern part of the [[country]]. It shares borders with the states of [[Pará]] and [[Amazonas (Brazil)|Amazonas]], as well as the countries [[Venezuela]] and [[Guyana]]. Roraima is both the northernmost and least [[population|populated]] state of Brazil. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The [[climate]] is [[tropics|tropical]] with an average [[temperature]] of 26 & nbsp;°C. Most of the state is in the [[Amazon rainforest]]. A small part of the state is a small strip of [[savanna]] to the east. The state has many [[mineral]] deposits - especially [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[cassiterite]], [[bauxite]] and [[copper]]. These create constant fights with the native people. The [[Yanomami]] are the most well-known of the native people, but they are greatly out-numbered by the [[Macuxi]]. 
 
 The [[Monte Roraima National Park]] is near one of the highest [[mountain]]s of Brazil, the 9220 ft (2727 m) high [[table-top]] [[Mount Roraima]]. 
 
 == History == 
 In 1943, the [[federal government]] separated the area from the state Amazonas. The [[territory]] was first named Rio Branco after the main [[river]]. In 1962, it was renamed  " Roraima. "  In 1988, it became a state. The name of the state was taken from [[Monte Roraima]], whose name comes from the [[Pemon]] words ''roroi'' ([[cyan]]) and ''ma'' (large).
