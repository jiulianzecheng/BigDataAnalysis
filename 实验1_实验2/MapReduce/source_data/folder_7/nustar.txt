 '''NuSTAR''' is a [[telescope]] launched into space by [[NASA]] in 2012. It is the eleventh satellite in the  " Small Explorer "  program. Telescopes in space can see much better than on Earth, because the telescopes on Earth need to look through the [[atmosphere]].  
 
 NuSTAR measures high-energy [[X-ray]]s, which have a much higher frequency than [[visible light]]. It uses special [[Optics|optical]] devices to do this, so it works differently from a normal telescope. This type of telescope is called a Wolter telescope. < ref name= " aboutNuSTAR " > [http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/about-nustar About NuSTAR: The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array] < /ref > 
 
 NuSTAR is searching for [[black hole]]s. It is also looking at [[supernova]]e to help understand how the [[chemical elements]] are created. < ref name= " aboutNuSTAR " / >  One of the first discoveries made by NuSTAR, along with another space telescope called XMM-Newton, was to measure the spin rate of a [[supermassive black hole]] for the first time. < ref > {{cite press release | title=NASA's NuSTAR Helps Solve Riddle of Black Hole Spin | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20130227.html | publisher=Whitney Clavin, NASA | date=27 February 2013 | accessdate=3 March 2013 | archive-date=3 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203021016/https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/news/nustar20130227.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
