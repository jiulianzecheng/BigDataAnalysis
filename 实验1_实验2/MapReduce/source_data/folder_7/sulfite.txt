A '''sulfite''' is an [[ion]] that is made of one sulfur atom and three oxygen atoms; it has a charge of two minus. Sulfite is made when [[sulfurous acid]] (a [[solution]] of [[sulfur dioxide]] in [[water]]) is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]]. [[Salt]]s containing the sulfite ion are called sulfites. [[Sodium sulfite]] is an example. Sulfites are weak [[reducing agent]]s; they can be [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[sulfate]]s. They are used to [[food preservation|preserve]] dried food. Some people have [[allergy|allergies]] to sulfite in food, and it makes them sick. It contains sulfur in the +4 [[oxidation state]]. Its chemical formula is SO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > .
