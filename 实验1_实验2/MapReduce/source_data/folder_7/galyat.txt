The '''Galyat''' region is an area roughly 50â€“80 & nbsp;km north-east of [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]], on both sides of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]-[[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] border. The word ''Galyat'' is the plural of the [[Urdu]] word ''gali'', which means an alley between two mountains on both sides of which there are valleys and it is not the highest point in the range. Many of the towns in the area have the word ''gali'' as part of their names. These are popular summer-holiday destinations in [[Pakistan]]. [[Murree]], one of the most popular hill stations of [[Pakistan]], is the largest town of the Galyat area.
