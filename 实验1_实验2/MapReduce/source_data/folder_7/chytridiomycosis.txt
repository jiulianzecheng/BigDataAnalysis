 '''Chytridiomycosis''' is a [[disease]] that can kill [[amphibian]]s, for example frogs.  A [[fungus]] causes it.  THe [[chytrid]] fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' causes the disease.  The animals can [[infection|catch it from each other]]. Chytridiomycosis one reason why there are fewer amphibians on Earth than there were. The fungus has decreased the amphibian population by 30% worldwide.  Many spcies are now [[extict]] because they died of chitridiomycosis.  In some species, only a few animals die, but in other species, they all [[mortality|die]].  This is called 100% mortality. There is no [[cure]].
