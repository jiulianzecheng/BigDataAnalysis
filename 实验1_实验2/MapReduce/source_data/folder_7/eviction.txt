'''Eviction''' is the process of forcing a [[tenant]] or [[homeowner]] to move out of a property, usually for failure to pay [[rent]], [[mortgage]] or [[property tax]]es,(the latter two resulting from [[foreclosure]]) or for breaking the rules the [[landlord]], [[homeowners association]] or [[municipality]] has enacted upon said property. Eviction can take a long time and sometimes is only done as a last resort.
