'''''Hatsumoude''''' is the first visit of the new year to a [[shrine]] or [[temple]]. Many [[Japanese people]] visit a [[shrine]] or [[temple]]. They [[pray]] to gods or [[Buddha]] for the health and happiness of their family in the coming year. A Hatsumoude is usually performed between January 1st and 7th, which is based on ancient beliefs. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://kininarutorenndo.com/archives/267.html |title=kininarutorenndo.com |access-date=2014-12-08 |archive-date=2015-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231145220/http://kininarutorenndo.com/archives/267.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 ==History== 
 Originally, hatsumoude had been called ''toshigomori''. < ref > [http://www.solution11.com/kaiunn/qes007hatsumoude.html www.solution11.com]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It was a custom that the head of [[family]] stay in the shrine from night on New  Year Eve to morning on New Year's Day for prayer. In [[Meiji period]], toshigomori had divided into ''jyoyamoude'' that was done at night on New Year's Eve. Also ''ganjitsumoude'' that was done in morning on New Year's Day. So ''ganjitsumoude'' is the original form of today's hatsumoude.
