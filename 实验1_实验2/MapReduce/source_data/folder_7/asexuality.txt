 '''Asexuality''' is a [[sexual orientation]]. Asexual people usually do not have [[sexual attraction]] towards anyone, no matter what [[gender]] they are. Asexuality has nothing to do with a person's romantic/aesthetic/sensual attraction. The opposite of an asexual is an ''allosexual''. Allosexuality means that a person feels sexual desires. < ref > {{cite web|last=Powers|first=Olivia|date=25 April 2018|title=Asexual student shares story of identity|url=https://unothegateway.com/asexual-student-shares-story-identity/|website=The Gateway|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 ==Meaning== 
 Asexuality is described as a spectrum. [[Demisexuality|Demisexual]] people are on the asexual spectrum. They feel sexual attraction, but only to people who they feel a connection to. About 1% of people identify as asexual. [[Alfred Kinsey]] used the label  " X "  to describe asexual people. < ref > Kinsey, Alfred C. (1948). ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''. W.B. Saunders. ISBN 0-253-33412-8. < /ref >  Grey-asexual people are people who feel like they are not asexual, but they're not sexual either. For example, a grey-asexual person doesn't feel sexual attraction often. Some asexuals also identify with a romantic identity as well, meaning they may feel the need to form relationships, while others may not. Some asexual people identify as [[queer]]. However, some people think that 'queer' is not an appropriate word for asexual people. Not having sex ([[celibacy]]), is not always asexuality. Some [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], for example, don't want to have sex because they feel guilty about their sexual attraction. < ref > https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/gay-christians-choosing-celibacy-emerge-from-the-shadows/2014/12/13/51c73aea-6ab2-11e4-9fb4-a622dae742a2_story.html < /ref > < ref > Margaret Jordan Halter, Elizabeth M.

 ==Studies== 
 In 2001, David Jay started the Asexual Visibility and Education Network. A 2012 study found that asexuals are just as [[discriminated]] against as [[gay]] men, [[lesbian]]s, or [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1177%2F1368430212442419 & |title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|website=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/1368430212442419|s2cid=3056711}} < /ref >  Asexuality has only recently been studied. One writer, S.E. Smith speculates that it has not increased, its just people have only just started noticing it.  < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/asexuality-always-existed-asexual|title=Asexuality always existed, you just didn't notice it - SE Smith|first=S.

 == Libido == 
 [[Libido]], or sex drive, is the sexual arousal that humans feel. Some asexual people have a libido, this does not mean they are allosexual. They feel it as the body just doing it's thing, and often [[Masturbation|masturbate]] to relieve it. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Prause|first1=Nicole|last2=Graham|first2=Cynthia A.|date=2007-06-01|title=Asexuality: Classification and Characterization|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9142-3|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=341–356|doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9142-3|pmid=17345167|s2cid=12034925|issn=1573-2800}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Yule|first1=Morag A.|last2=Brotto|first2=Lori A.|last3=Gorzalka|first3=Boris B.|date=August 2014|title=Sexual fantasy and masturbation among asexual individuals|url=https://doi.org/10.3138/cjhs.2409|journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=89–95|doi=10.3138/cjhs.2409|s2cid=4091448|issn=1188-4517}} < /ref > 
 
 == Romantic orientation == 
 {{Main|Romantic orientation}} 
 Some asexual people are [[Aromanticity|aromantic]]. This means that they do not feel romantic attraction such as getting a crush on someone. Others can be homoromantic, heteroromantic, biromantic, etc. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=MacNeela|first1=Pádraig|last2=Murphy|first2=Aisling|date=2015-04-01|title=Freedom, Invisibility, and Community: A Qualitative Study of Self-Identification with Asexuality|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-014-0458-0|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=799–812|doi=10.1007/s10508-014-0458-0|pmid=25548065|s2cid=23757013|issn=1573-2800}} < /ref >
