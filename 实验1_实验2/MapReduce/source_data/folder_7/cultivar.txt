 A '''cultivar''' is a variant of a [[plant]] that has been selected for planting and [[Sales|sale]] because it has certain characteristics. It keeps its [[Trait (biology)|traits]] when it is [[Plant propagation|propagated]] because they are [[Heritable|inherited]].  
 
 Usually, cultivars are given a name which is not related to their biological [[taxon]]. There is a system of naming run by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the ICNCP), commonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code.
