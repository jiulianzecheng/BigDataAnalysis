 '''Snowdonia''' ({{lang-cy|Eryri}}) is a region in north [[Wales]]. It is also a [[national park]] of {{convert|838|sqmi|km2|-1|abbr=off}} in area. It was the first national park in Wales, set up in 1951. It is the largest national park in Wales and includes the highest mountain in Wales, and the largest natural lake in Wales. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/home |title=Eryri |first= |last= |work=eryri-npa.gov.uk |year=2014 |accessdate=28 May 2014}} < /ref >  Before 1951, the word ''Snowdonia''  was used for the much smaller area around [[Snowdon]] itself. The which includes the national park is twice as large. 
 
 ==Name== 
 The [[English language|English]] name for the area comes from [[Snowdon]], which is the highest [[mountain]] in [[Wales]], at {{convert|3560|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] it is named ''Eryri.'' This could be the Welsh word for [[eagle]], which is'' eryr'', or it may mean ''highlands''. < ref > Ifor Williams, ''Enwau Lleoedd'' (Liverpool, 1945), p. 18. < /ref >  In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]], who was the [[Prince of Wales]], was called ''Prince of [[Wales]] and Lord of Snowdonia''. In Welsh, it translates to ''Tywysog Cymru ac Arglwydd Eryri''. Gruffudd's [[grandfather]], [[Llywelyn Fawr]], was called  " Prince of north [[Wales]] and Lord of Snowdonia. " 
 
 Before it was a [[national park]], the name  " Snowdonia "  was used to describe  " Snowdon, "  a small area north of [[Gwynedd]]. Today, the national park covers an area that is two times larger than the area originally called Snowdonia. The park covers areas as far south as [[Meirionnydd]]. The original Snowdonia includes Snowdon, and three other mountain ranges: the [[Glyderau]], the [[Carneddau]] and the [[Moel Siabod]] group. The hills that are south of [[Maentwrog]] are not part of the original Snowdonia.

 Snowdonia National Park ({{lang-cy|Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri}}) was started in 1951. It was the third national park in Britain. It makes up {{convert|827|sqmi|km2|abbr=off}}, and has {{convert|37|mi|km|abbr=off}} of coastline in its border. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/travel-national-parks--the-complete-guide-to-britains-national-parks-1108194.html|title=National Parks – The complete guide to Britain's national parks|last=Culliford|first=Alison|date=24 July 1999|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=31 August 2017|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925054754/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/travel-national-parks--the-complete-guide-to-britains-national-parks-1108194.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://estb.msn.com/i/26/9D3386135C8A465B0C44431A53D2F.swf|title=Our national parks|publisher=[[MSN]]|access-date=2014-06-11|archive-date=2011-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002084601/http://estb.msn.com/i/26/9D3386135C8A465B0C44431A53D2F.swf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The park is ran by the Snowdonia National Park Authority. The park has lands that are owned by private people and also by the public.  
 
 Snowdonia has many historic sites, including [[Stone Age]] burial chambers, [[Iron age]] [[hill fort]]s, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] forts, churches, and [[medieval]] castles. There are also industrial sites including large slate quarries, copper mines, and woolen mills. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/a-sense-of-place |title=A Sense of Place |first= |last= |work=eryri-npa.gov.uk |year=2014 |accessdate=28 May 2014 |archive-date=9 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709194844/http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/a-sense-of-place |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  More than 26,000 people live in Snowdonia. < ref > {{cite news|title=Make the most of Snowdonia|last=Thomas|first=Helen|date=28 October 2001|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.eryri-npa.co.uk/page/index.php?nav1=learning & nav2=2 & nav3=13 & lang=eng & contrast=1 & view=graphic|title=The Welsh Language|publisher=Snowdonia National Park Authority|access-date=2014-06-11|archive-date=2007-10-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023061323/http://www.eryri-npa.co.uk/page/index.php?nav1=learning & nav2=2 & nav3=13 & lang=eng & view=graphic & contrast=1|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The area attracts over six million visitors every year. < ref > [http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/page/index.php?nav1=learning & nav2=11 & nav3=1 & lang=eng & view=graphic & contrast=1 Park Profile 2007]{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

 ==Mountain ranges== 
 [[Image:North snowdonia panorama.jpg|thumb|center|600px|Panorama including Snowdon (centre right) taken from [[Mynydd Mawr]].  The [[Glyderau]] are can be see in the distance.]] 
 Snowdonia may be divided into four areas: 
 * The northern area is the most popular with visitors. It includes [[Moel Hebog]], [[Mynydd Mawr]], the [[Nantlle Ridge]], Snowdon, the [[Glyderau]], and the [[Carneddau]]. These are the highest mountains in Wales. 
 * The second area includes [[Moel Siabod]], [[Cnicht]], the [[Moelwynion]], and the mountains around [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]]. 
 * The third area includes the [[Rhinogydd]]  and the [[Arenig]]. It also includes the bog [[Migneint]] and an [[extinct volcano]], [[Rhobell Fawr]]. Because it a remote area, there are not many visitors. 
 * The southern area includes [[Cadair Idris]], the Tarren range, the [[Dyfi hills]], and the Aran group, including [[Aran Fawddwy]]. 
 
 ==Hiking== 
 [[File:Badgernet Snowdonia walks 1.JPG|right|thumb|A photograph of a path marker in [[Gwynedd]]]] 
 People can [[hiking|hike]] the area, primarily in Snowdon. People can hike the [[Snowdon Mountain Railway]] all the way to the top of the mountain. < ref > {{cite book |last=Parker |first=Mike |author2= Whitfield, Paul |title= The Rough Guide to Wales|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetowale0000park |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |edition=4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetowale0000park/page/385 385]|isbn=978-1-84353-120-3}} < /ref >  People also hike other mountains in the area such as [[Tryfan]] and lower areas that aren't very mountainous.

 ==Nature and environment== 
 [[File:Rain coming in over the lake.jpg|left|thumb|A photograph of it [[rain|raining]] at [[Llyn Cowlyd]] north of [[Capel Curig]]]] 
 The [[coastline]] in the park is a [[Special Area of Conservation]]. The area starts at [[Llŷn Peninsula]] and goes down the coast. There are [[sand dune]]s located in the special area. The park has [[tree]]s. They are a mix of different types of [[deciduous]] trees. The tree seen the most in the park is the [[Welsh oak (tree)|Welsh Oak]]. [[Birch]], ash, mountain-ash and hazel trees are also found in the park. There are [[coniferous]] [[forest]]s that have been planted by people. These forests include [[Gwydir Forest]]. These forests used to be harvested for wood. Now they grow without people cutting down the trees.  
 
 The park is the only place in Britain where [[Snowdon lily]] and the [[Snowdon beetle]] can be found. It is the only place in the world where the [[Snowdonia hawkweed]] is found. An [[invasive species]] is growing in the park, too, called the ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]''. It kills native species that live in the park and also makes [[fungus]] grow that is poisonous. The fungus stays alive up to seven years after the rhododendron is killed. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/3301402/Important-Plant-Areas-in-the-UK.html|title=Important plant areas in the UK|date=24 July 2007|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=1 April 2018|archive-date=13 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113055049/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/3301402/Important-Plant-Areas-in-the-UK.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
