 The '''Corvidae''' are the crow [[Family (biology)|family]].  They are all [[passerine]]s, but unusually they do not have musical voices. They are intelligent.  
 
 There are over 120 species in the family. The word 'crow' is also used to describe birds in the [[genus]] ''[[Corvus]]''. This genus includes the [[crow]]s, [[jackdaw]]s and [[raven]]s. 
 
 Crows are found on every [[continent]] except for the southern area of [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]]. Most crows are found in [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. There are 10 species each in [[Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[North America]]. 
 
 A group of crows is called a ''murder'' and, indeed, they are distinctly carnivorous. 
 
 == Description == 
 Most members of the crow family are [[black]], such as crows, rooks, choughs, ravens and jackdaws. However, not all crows are black. Magpies and treepies can be black and white, or blue and green, or brown. Jays are often blue and white. 
 
 Crows are some of the most intelligent birds in the world. Crows and rooks are good at using [[tools]], for example sticks or twigs. Magpies can see themselves in a [[mirror]] and they understand that it is a [[reflection]]. Many crows live near to humans in [[town]]s and [[cities]]. Some crows (such as treepies) live in [[forest]]s. They are more shy than the crows that live in cities. 
 
 Some crows in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and northern [[Asia]] [[migrate]]. This means they travel to different places in [[summer]] or [[winter]]. Most crows are resident birds. This means they live in the same place all year round. 
 
 Many crows live in large groups. For example, many rooks nest together in large groups at the top of trees. This is called a rookery. Crows in big groups are often noisy. However, when it is the breeding season (this means when birds nest and have babies), crows can become angry and will scare off other crows. 
 
 Crows eat a variety of food. They will eat fledglings (baby birds) and eggs from nests, small animals ([[mouse|mice]] and rats), [[carrion]] (dead animals), [[vegetables]] and [[garbage]]. for much of the year, crows and rooks dig into [[grassland]] with their strong beaks, and eat various kinds of insect [[grub]]s and [[Earthworm|worms]]. Because they may attack the nest of other birds, crows may get mobbed by other species. This is when the defending birds group together to chase off the crow. Also, on [[farm]]s, crows will eat vegetables and seeds. Farmers do not want this to happen so they make a scarecrow. This is an object made of [[straw]] and old clothes. It looks like a man and it may scare the crows away. 
 
 Crows make their nests in tall trees. They make the nest from large sticks. They usually lay 3 & ndash;8 eggs. Both parents look after the fledglings.
