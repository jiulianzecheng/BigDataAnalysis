 '''Keratin''' is one of a family of [[fibrous protein|fibrous proteins.]] Keratin is what makes up [[hair]] in [[animal]]s, as well as [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[Hoof|hooves]], [[animal shell|shells]], [[beak]]s, and [[feather]]s. The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''keras'' meaning  " horn " . 
 
 Keratins are tough and [[Solubility|insoluble]]. They form the hard but [[mineral|non-mineral]] structures in [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[amphibian]]s and [[mammal]]s. A similar [[biology|biological]] toughness is found in [[chitin]]. 
 
 == Variety of animal uses == 
 Keratins are the main constituent of structures that grow from the skin:  
 
 * the ''α-keratins'' in the [[hair]] (including [[wool]]), [[horn (anatomy)|horns]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[claw]]s and [[Hoof|hooves]] of mammals  
 * the harder ''[[β-keratin]]s'' in the [[scale (zoology)|scales]] and claws of [[reptiles]], their [[animal shell|shells]] ([[chelonia]], such as [[tortoise]], [[turtle]], [[terrapin]]), and in the [[feather]]s, [[beak]]s, and claws of [[birds]]. These keratins are formed mainly in [[beta sheet]]s. However, beta sheets are also found in α-keratins. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Kreplak L. |display-authors = etal |title=New aspects of the alpha-helix to beta-sheet transition in stretched hard alpha-keratin fibers |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_biophysical-journal_2004-07_87_1/page/640 |journal=Biophys J |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=640–7 |year=2004 |doi = 10.1529/biophysj.103.036749 |pmid = 15240497 |pmc = 1304386 |bibcode = 2004BpJ....87..640K }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Arthropods]] such as [[crustacea]]ns often have parts of their [[exoskeleton]] made of keratin, sometimes in combination with [[chitin]]. 
 
 Keratins are also found in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]s of many animals, including [[roundworm]]s (who also have an outer layer made of keratin).  
 
 Although it is now difficult to be certain, the scales, claws, some [[Thyreophora|protective armour]] and the beaks of [[dinosaur]]s would, almost certainly, have been composed of a type of keratin.  
 
 == Silk == 
 The [[silk]] [[fibroin]]s produced by [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins. 
 
 Silk found in insect [[pupa]]e, and in [[spider web]]s and egg casings, also has twisted β-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates.
