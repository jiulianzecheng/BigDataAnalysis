 '''Vitiligo''' is a [[skin disease]] that causes the [[skin]] to lose its [[color]].  It occurs when the [[melanocyte]]s, [[cell]]s that give skin their color, die or do not work. This is a problem because these cells protect against the light from the sun. 
 
 == How is it caught? == 
 The exact cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood. It may be caused by the [[immune system]], [[genetic]], and environmental factors.  
 Vitiligo may also be caused by stress that affects the [[immune system]], leading the body to react and start eliminating skin pigment. 
 
 People over 20 years old rarely develop this disease. These patches often occur to both sides [[symmetry|symmetrically]] and may change shape. 
 
 == Effects of vitiligo == 
 * color of the skin is lighter because there are no [[pigment]]s 
 * purple or golden brown patches on and around the [[eye]]s, [[nose]], and [[mouth]]  
 * puffiness of the middle layer of the [[eye]]  
 * quicker graying of [[hair]]  
 * more sensitive to [[sun]] 
 
 This disease can also affect the mental state of the patient. 
 
 == Curing it == 
 As of 2020, doctors do not understand what causes the disease, so right now, it can not be cured. Some things can be done to fight its effects, though. [[Makeup]] or [[cosmetics]] can cover up the parts of the skin with vitiligo. Also, staying out of the sun to prevent [[tanning]] is good. But the treatment given by most skin [[Medical doctor|doctors]] is cortico steroid cream. 
 Breakthrough discovery in 2004 allowed for the transplant of [[melanocyte]]s to vitiligo affected areas, repigmenting the region. 
 
 == Famous people with vitiligo == 
 *[[Michael Jackson]] told [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] in a 1993 interview that he had vitiligo. He is the most well known person to have had the disease. A lot of people thought that he was lying. He died in 2009, and his [[autopsy]] found that he was telling the truth. Apparently, when it got past the point where makeup could have hidden it, he chose to have the rest of the pigment removed. < ref > [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/michael-jacksons-son-suffer-loss-pigment/story?id=11064783#.UW1SRFdQqHc Pigment loss story] < /ref >
