 '''Lichens''' are a [[symbiosis]] of at least two quite different [[organism]]s. The partnership always involves a [[fungus]], which lives with one or more partners which can do [[photosynthesis]]. The photobiont < ref > [[photosynthesis]]+bio = photobiont < /ref >  partner may be a green [[alga]] and/or a [[cyanobacterium]]. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p5,6,13 < /sup > 
 
 The algae or bacteria live inside the fungus, and exchange [[nutrient]]s with it. The lichen is different in shape and mode of life from any of the partners. It is a distinct form of life. [[Botanist]]s did not know this until about 1875. < ref name=Anton > [[Anton de Bary|de Bary, Anton]] 1879. Die Erscheinung der Symbiosis. In ''Verlag auf der Versammlung der Naturforscher und Artze zu Cassel''. Strassburg. < /ref > 
 
 There are more than 2,000 species in Britain and Ireland alone, many of which are found in temperate rainforests. < ref > Rescue mission for UK rainforests’ weird treasures [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66989115] < /ref > 
 
 == Classification == 
 Lichens pose a problem for [[biological classification]], because the three types of organism concerned come from three different [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. After long debate, lichen are now classified as fungi, under the [[genus]] and [[species]] of the host fungus. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p47–48 < /sup >  This allows specimens to be put into boxes and labelled. By having specific names, researchers know what they are working on: that is one of the basic functions of [[taxonomy]]. The system still has its problems. In those fungi which may associate either with an alga, or with a cyanobacterium, the resulting forms (called ''photomorphs'') may look quite different, yet are now referred to by the same name. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p13 < /sup > 
 
 20% (one in five) of fungal species live in lichens. Lichen fungi belong to several different groups of fungi. Most common (over 40%) are [[Ascomycota|Ascomycete]]s, which produce spores in a sac-shaped container, the ''ascus''. Only a few types of alga occur within lichens; these algae also have their own names. Algae may be sometimes the dominant partner in so-called 'jelly lichens', ''Collema'' and ''Leptogium'', but this is rare. More usually, the algae are the green alga ''Trebouxia''. Other species are the orange ''Trentepohli'', and the cyanobacterium ''Nostoc''. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p9–10 < /sup > 
 
 == Their life habit == 
 The [[life habit]] of lichens is to stick closely onto surfaces. 
 
 Lichens can occur anywhere on land, and some can live in [[aquatic]] [[environment]]s. The nearest [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[wall]] or [[roof]] probably has lichen on it. Often the lichen is mat-like, and clings to the surface. Some are like little [[Shrub|bushes]]: see the photos. Lichens are famous for not needing a regular supply of [[water]]; their [[metabolism]] can go into suspension, and later revive. When growing on [[mineral]] surfaces, some lichens slowly break down the [[substrate]], and extract tiny amounts of mineral [[nutrient]]. Fungi form the main part of the thallus (body), with the photobiont contributing 20% or less. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p17 < /sup >  The photobiont is usually on the inside of the thallus. 
 
 Lichen thalli may grow together and fuse, and this may happen between different species and genera. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p23 < /sup >  These are called 'mechanical hybrids'. They get noticed when the two forms are differently colored. 
 
 === Survival === 
 Lichen do survive extreme conditions. They are found in some of the most extreme places on [[Earth]] – the frozen north, hot [[desert]]s, rocky [[coast]]s. They are common as [[epiphyte]]s on leaves and branches in [[rain forest]]s and [[temperate]] woods. They can live on bare rock, walls and gravestones, and on exposed [[soil]] surfaces. < ref name= " Purvis " > Purvis, William 2007. ''Lichens''. Natural History Museum, London. {{ISBN|0-565-09153-0}} < /ref > < sup > p19 < /sup >  There are about 200 different kinds of lichens in [[Antarctica]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online & aid=957340|title= " Phytogeography of continental Antarctic lichens " |journal=The Lichenologist| year=1995|issue=27|pages=417-431|author=R.D. Seppelt}} < /ref >  In the [[Horlick Mountains]], at 86 degrees south, there are six different kinds of lichen. In the [[Himalaya]]s, they grow at altitudes up to 18,000 feet (~5500m). < ref > Attenborough, David 1994. ''The private life of plants: a natural history of plant behaviour''. BBC, London. < /ref > < sup > p216 < /sup > 
 
 The [[European Space Agency]] discovered that lichen can survive unprotected in space. Two species of lichen were sealed in a capsule and launched on a [[Russia]]n Soyuz [[rocket]]. Once in [[orbit]] the capsules were opened. Two species of lichen were exposed to the [[vacuum]] of [[Outer space|space]], to cosmic [[radiation]] and huge swings of [[temperature]]. After 15 days the lichens were retrieved and were found to be in full health: no damage was found. < ref > Lichen survives in space [http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMUJM638FE_index_0.html] European Space Agency 2005. < /ref > < ref name=Sancho2007 > {{cite journal| author = Sancho L.G. | year = 2007| title = Lichens survive in space: results from the 2005 LICHENS experiment.| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 443–454| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed & uid=17630840 & cmd=showdetailview & indexed=google | accessdate = 2007-12-22| doi = 10.1089/ast.2006.0046}} < /ref > 
 
 === Rain forests === 
 There are a huge number of lichen species in [[rainforest]]s, far outnumbering [[flowering plant]]s. The lichen are mostly [[epiphyte]]s, living on trees. A single site in [[Costa Rica]] yielded about 300 species of lichen on leaves, in the understory of the rain forest; a single fallen ''Elaeocarpus'' tree in [[New Guinea]] held 173 species; the [[evergreen]] [[laurel]] ''Ocotea atirrensis'' was found with 50–80 lichen species on a ''single leaf''. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p60–61 < /sup > 
 
 === Mutual benefits === 
 When partnerships are very close, it is difficult to assign benefits to either partner. < ref > Crombie J.M. 1886. On the algo-lichen hypothesis. ''J. Linnaean Soc''. '''21''', 259–282. < /ref >  Their success is as a pair (or trio). Sometimes the partners can exist as separate organisms: certainly their close relatives can. Probably most of the algae and all of the cyanobacteria can survive on their own, though in more restricted habitats. The details vary according to the specific species or strains involved. The man who first realised the nature of lichen, Simon Schwedener, thought of the partnership as one of controlled [[parasitism]]. < ref > Schwedener, Simon 1868. Untersuchungen über den Flechtenthallus. ''Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichten Botannik'' '''6''' 195–207 < /ref > < ref > Schwedener, Simon 1869. Die Algentypen der Flechtengonidien. ''Program für die Rectorsfeier der Universität Basel''. '''4''', 1–42. < /ref >  Obviously, the photobiont provides [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products: [[carbohydrate]]s as [[sugar]] [[alcohol]]s (green algae) or [[glucose]] (cyanobacteria). The bacteria also convert [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[nitrogen]] (N < sub > 2 < /sub > ) to [[Ammonia|ammonium]] [[ion]]s (NH < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup > ) which the fungus can use in [[amino acid]]s for [[protein]]s. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p26 < /sup > 
 
 The alga certainly benefits from a supply of water (which the fungus is good at storing). There is also general mechanical protection. Algae get protection from [[ultraviolet]] light, which in some [[environment]]s is quite significant. Probably, algae get access to the minute amounts of [[mineral]]s, which the fungus gets from the substrate or from dust settling on the thallus. Algal cells are sometimes destroyed in the course of [[nutrient]] exchange, though the algal cells divide and replace them. Above all, the partnership is a resounding success, and gets to places where few plants can survive. 
 
 === Reproduction === 
 Many lichens reproduce without sex ([[asexual reproduction]]). They make small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments. These ''soridia'' can be blown by wind. Some lichens just break up into fragments when they dry. Wind carries the pieces, which grow when moisture returns. Also, lichen fungi can reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] by forming fruiting bodies containing spores. These fruiting bodies are usually [[perennial]], and may be long-lasting: some in the [[Swiss Alps]] have lived for over 50 years. After [[wikt:disperse|dispersal]] by wind, such fungal spores must meet with an algal partner to form a lichen. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p19–22 < /sup > 
 
 == History on Earth == 
 [[File:Lisaj2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Shrubby light green lichen on bark just below a [[moss]]]] 
 
 The [[fossil]] record for lichen dates back 400 million years for certain, and the signs are that earlier forms existed 600 million years ago. They must have been one of the earliest life-forms on land. It is thought, from the number of fungal and algal species involved, that the symbiosis must have taken place many times between different species. < ref name= " Purvis " / > < sup > p46 < /sup > 
 
 It has been suggested that some or all of the [[Ediacaran biota]] might be lichen. < ref > Retallack G.J. 1994. Were the Ediacaran fossils lichens?. ''Paleobiology'' '''20''', 523–544. http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-8373(199423)20%3A4%3C523%3AWTEFL%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V. Retrieved 2008-02-04.   
 < /ref >  The proposal has been received with some [[skepticism]]. 
 
 == Lichenometry == 
 '''Lichenometry''' is a method of dating exposed [[rock (geology)|rock]] by using the growth of lichen. It uses an estimate of how long the lichen's [[radius]] or [[width]] grows over time. < ref > Holocene climatic and glacial history of the central Sierra Nevada, California. R.R. Curry, pp. 1-47, 1969, ''Geological Society of America'' Special Paper 123. S.A. Schumm and W.C. Bradley, eds., 1969 < /ref > < ref name=GA > Bradwell, Tom 2009. Lichenometric dating: a commentary in the light of some recent statistical studies. ''Geografiska Annaler''. < /ref >

 Many lichen are sensitive to changes around them. For this reason, they are used by scientists to show changes in the [[environment]], such as air [[pollution]], < ref name=ferry > Ferry B.W., Baddeley M.S.  &  Hawkworth D.L. 1973. (eds) ''Air pollution and Lichens''. Athlone Press, London. < /ref > < ref name=Hawksworthrose1976 > D.L. Hawksworth and F. Rose 1976. ''Lichens as pollution monitors''. Edward Arnold, Institute of Biology Series #66. 60pp. {{ISBN|0-7131-2554-3}}:  0713125551(pbk.) < /ref > < ref name=rosehawksworth > C.I. Rose  &  D.L. Hawksworth (1981) Lichen recolonization in London's cleaner air. ''Nature'' '''289''', 289-292. < /ref >  [[ozone]] depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have also been used to make [[dye]]s, [[perfume]]s, and herbal [[medicine]]s. 
 
 Some lichen produce natural [[antibiotics]] that kill bacteria. Humans have used these compounds as natural antibiotics. < ref > [[Penicillin]] originally came from a fungus, as did several other antibiotics. Now, they are synthesised (artificially made) by chemists, and prescribed as tablets. < /ref >  Extracts from many ''Usnea'' < ref > [http://www.susunweed.com/An_Article_wisewoman3d.htm Gordino, Jessica 2002. ''Usnea''] < /ref >  species were used to treat wounds in Russia in the mid-twentieth century. 
 
 The [[map lichen]] ''Rhizocarpon geographicum'' grows extremely slowly, and can reach an age of over 1000 years. It may be used for dating: the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface shows the time that the rock has been exposed. 
 
 Lichen are the main winter food for [[reindeer]]. The deer can get at [[shrub]]by lichen under the snow. < ref > [http://www.eattheweeds.com/www.EatTheWeeds.Com/EatTheWeeds.com/Entries/1939/7/28_Reindeer_Moss,_Cladonia_Evanii_Lichen.html Jordan, Deane. 2008. Edible ''Cladonia'': what's not to lichen?] < /ref >  In summer they have much more choice of food. Some lichen are eaten by humans. A kind of lichen, which is called ''Iwatake'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and ''Seogi'' in [[Korean language]], is collected from cliffs, and used in various Korean and Japanese foods. Lichen have a high level of [[acid]]. Care must be taken, as there are at least two kinds of lichen that are [[toxic]]. 
 
 The [[bacteria]]l or [[alga]]l partners produce [[pigment]]s that absorb sunlight in [[photosynthesis]]. There are reports dating back almost 2000 years of purple and red colours being extracted from lichens. < ref name=Karen > {{cite book |author=Casselman, Karen Leigh  &  Dean, Jenny |title=Wild color: the complete guide to making and using natural dyes |publisher=Watson-Guptill |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-8230-5727-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} < /ref >  Lichens of the family Roccellaceae are commonly called 'orchella weed' . They have been important in history, because they could supply [[orcein]], a [[dye]].  ''Rocella tinctoria'' is the source of the [[pH]] indicator [[litmus]]. < ref > Litmus is called an 'indicator' because it is red in [[acid]]ic [[pH]] and blue in [[alkaline]] pH. < /ref >  Orcein is got by boiling the lichen, and litmus is produced by adding [[ammonia]] and air. Orcein is also used as a food dye, with the [[E number]] E121. 
 
 Today, dyes based on lichens have largely been replaced by [[synthetic]] ones.
