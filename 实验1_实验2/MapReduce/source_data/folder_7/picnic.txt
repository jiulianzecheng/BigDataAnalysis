 ==History== 
 In the 12th century, a picnic was described in the [[Persia]]n [[poetry]] of ''The Rubaiyat'': 
 ::: " A book of verse beneath the bough, < br / > 
 :::A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou  < br / > 
 :::Beside me singing in the Wilderness –  < br / > 
 :::Ah, wilderness were paradise enough! "
