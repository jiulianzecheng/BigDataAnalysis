 '''Methyl''' is an [[ion]]. It is made by removing one of the [[hydrogen]] atoms from an atom of [[methane]]. It is an [[organic chemistry|organic]] ion. < ref > March, Jerry (1992). Advanced organic chemistry: reactions, mechanisms, and structure. John Wiley  &  Sons. ISBN 0-471-60180-2 < /ref >  Its chemical formula is CH < sub > 3 < /sub > . It bonds with other ions, such as [[hydroxide]], to make [[chemical compound]]s. The bonding with hydroxide makes [[methanol]]. If it bonds with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], it makes [[dimethylmercury]]. 
 
 Methyl groups added to [[cytosine]] are the basis of [[epigenetics]]. They change the way genes act, and so explain how (for example)  [[identical twin]]s may turn out differently later in life. Or, they help understand how a mother's [[nutrition]] may have long-lasting effects on her offspring. < ref > Carey, Nessa 2011. The epigenetics revolution: how modern biology is rewriting our understanding of genetics, disease and inheritance. London: Icon Books. ISBN 978-184831347-7 < /ref >
