 '''Nouakchott''' ({{lang-ar|نواكشوط or انواكشوط}}) is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the [[Africa]]n [[county]] of [[Mauritania]]. It is the largest city in that country and one of the largest cities on the [[Sahara Desert]]. The city is the [[administration|administrative]] and [[economy|economic]] centre of Mauritania. The Arabic name is said to mean  " The place of winds "  in the [[language]] of the [[Berber people]]. 
 
 The city is often a place where the [[urban]] Mauritanians and the [[nomad]]ic people of the area can [[wikt:interact|interact]]. 
 
 The [[population]] of Nouakchott is about 881,000 people. It is hard to know exactly how many people live in the city because many of them are nomadic. They find a good place to live, set up their [[tent]] for a short time and then move to somewhere else. 
 
 Although [[Islam]] is the state religion in Mauritania, Nouakchott includes the Cathedral of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]], a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[cathedral]]. 
 
 Nouakchott has a deep-[[sea]] [[harbor|port]]. It was opened in 1986. The port is mainly used for [[import]]s. The city also features an [[Nouakchott International Airport|international airport]]. The city is home to the [[Université de Nouakchott]]. It is the only [[university]] in [[Mauritania]]. Things to see in Nouakchott include [[Nouakchott Museum]], several [[market]]s including [[Nouakchott Silver Market]], and the [[beach]]es. 
 
 == History == 
 Nouakchott has very little history. It was a tiny [[fishing]] town until 1958.  It is possible that the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Muslim]] [[Almoravids]] came from the area.  The city was selected as the capital city for its [[wikt:mild|mild]] [[weather|climate]] and its location near the center of the country. < ref > ''Cities of the World'', Vol. 1, p331; Brian Rajewski, ed., for Eastword Publications Development Inc., Cleveland, Ohio; Gale Research, Detroit, 1999. {{ISBN|0-8103-7692-X}}. < /ref > 
 
 Mauritania was part of the larger French [[colony]] of [[French West Africa]]. During that time, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], in [[Senegal]] was the capital. In 1957, this small [[harbor|port]] town was chosen to be the capital of the new country. A [[building]] [[government|program]] was begun to grow its [[population]] to 15,000. In 1962, Nouakchott became the capital of an [[Independence|independent]] country. 
 
 The city has much growth. Because of the north African [[drought]] since the beginning of the 1970s many people have moved to the city. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Nouakchott is located on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the [[Sahara Desert]]. The city is very spread out. It has only a few tall [[building]]s. 
 
 Nouakchott is built around a large [[tree]]-lined street, [[Avenue Abd an-Nasir]]. This street runs northeast through the city center from the [[airport]]. Other major streets are named (in [[French language|French]]) for notable Mauritanian people, or [[international]] people of the 1960s: Avenue de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example. 
 
 [[Temperature]]s range between 33°[[celsius|C]] (92°[[fahrenheit|F]]) and 13 & nbsp;°C (56 & nbsp;°F). The average [[rain]]fall is 178[[millimetre|mm]] (7[[inch|in]]) a [[year]].
