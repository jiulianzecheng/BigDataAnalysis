In [[chemistry]], a '''sulphate''' ('''sulfate''' in US English) is a [[salt]] of [[sulphuric acid]]. The sulphate [[ion]] is a group of [[atom]]s with the formula SO < sub > 4 < /sub >  and two negative charges. It consists of a central sulphur atom surrounded by four equivalent [[oxygen]] atoms. It occurs when sulfuric acid is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] twice. If it is only deprotonated once, the [[hydrogen sulfate]] ion is made.
