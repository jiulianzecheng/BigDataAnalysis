 '''Crossrail''' is a {{convert|118|km|0|abbr=off|adj=on}} railway line under development in the [[London]]  area. It goes to the [[counties]] of [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Essex]], England.  
 
 The central section between {{rws|Paddington}} in central London and {{rws|Abbey Wood}} in the south-east, is open. It will later join with two existing routes operated by [[TfL Rail]] to become the '''Elizabeth Line''', named after Queen [[Elizabeth II]].  
 
 TfL Rail's Shenfield branch is connected to Paddington and the branches west of Paddington are connected to Crossrail's central core. This completes a new east–west route across London. It will provide a new high-frequency [[Commuter rail|commuter]] and suburban passenger service. 
 
 Basically, it is an additional NE to SW connection, ending up in [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. Previously, it has been difficult to get to and fro between N.E. London and Heathrow, so this will help that journey.
