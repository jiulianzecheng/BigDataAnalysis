'''Cytokines''' are a group of signalling [[molecules]] made by [[cells]]. They help to control the [[immune system]] and fight [[disease]]. They are similar to [[hormones]] and, as we learn more about each, distinctions between the two are fading. 
 
 Cytokines carry signals locally between cells, and these signals have an effect on other cells. < ref > ''The New Oxford American Dictionary'' < /ref >  They are made of [[protein]]s, [[peptide]]s, or [[glycoprotein]]s. The cytokines are a large family of [[polypeptide]] regulators that are produced throughout the body by many groups of cells. < ref > {{cite book |author=Gilman A. | display-authors = etal |title=Goodman  &  Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-135469-7}} < /ref > 
 
 Some well-known cytokines include [[interferon]], [[prostaglandin]] and [[interleukin]]s. Cytokines can be detected using the [[ELISA]] and [[ELISPOT]] techniques. 
 
 Cytokines work by [[signal transduction]]. Each cytokine has a matching [[Receptor (biochemistry)|cell-surface receptor]]. Then [[cascade]]s of signals inside the cell changes cell functions. This may include the [[gene regulation|regulation]] of several [[genes]], the production of other cytokines, or an increase in surface receptors for other molecules.
