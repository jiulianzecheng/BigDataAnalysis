 The '''future''' is something that has not happened yet. Once that something has happened, it is called the [[past]]. If it is happening now, it is called the [[wikt:present|present]]. And the study of social advancement in the future is called [[futurology]]. 
 
 [[Movies]], [[television]] shows and [[books]] that tell made-up stories about the future are often called [[science fiction]], but there is also science fiction which takes place in the past, and fiction that takes place in the future but is not science fiction.
