In [[anatomy]], a '''ganglion''' (plural '''ganglia''') is a mass of [[tissue]] in the [[nervous system]]. It is a group of [[neuron|nerve cells]] which do a job in the nervous system. Ganglia are basically clusters of nerve cell bodies. They may have thousands of nerve cell bodies working on some particular function. We perceive the brain's action as a whole. We cannot perceive ( " see " ) the activity unless it goes wrong. 
 
 In the brain, the [[basal ganglia]] is a group of nuclei interconnected with the [[cerebral cortex]], [[thalamus]], and [[Brain stem|brainstem]]. They do various things: motor control, [[cognition]], emotions, and learning. < ref > Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM, eds. (2000).

 In [[invertebrate]]s, ganglia often do the work of a [[brain]]. In cases like the [[earthworm]], there is a ganglion above the [[gut]] at the front. This is linked to another under the gut by [[nerve fibre]]s running down each side of the gut. The rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut. This type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate [[phyla]], and contrasts with the [[vertebrate]]s, who have their [[spinal cord]] above ([[dorsal]] to) their gut. 
 
 In another usage, ganglion cells are found in the [[retina]] of the vertebrate [[eye]].
