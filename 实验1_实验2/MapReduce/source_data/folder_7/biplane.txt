 A '''biplane''' is a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] that has two fixed wings. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEUEAAAAMAAJ & q=biplane+description|title=Monoplanes and Biplanes, Their Design, Construction and Operation|last=Loening|first=Grover|date=1911|publisher=Munn, Incorporated|language=en}} < /ref >   The lower wing is often attached to the body of the [[aircraft]] and the top wing is raised above.  Most early airplanes were biplanes because they have a stronger structure than a [[monoplane]].  When [[engineer]] < nowiki/ > s found how to makes strong monoplanes, biplanes became rare because they produce more [[Drag (physics)|drag]].   
 
 Famous biplanes include the [[Polikarpov Po-2]], [[Sopwith Camel]], [[Avro Tutor]], [[Antonov An-2]], [[Beechcraft Staggerwing]], [[Boeing Stearman]], [[Bristol Bulldog]], [[Curtiss JN-4]], [[de Havilland Tiger Moth]], [[Fairey Swordfish]], [[Hawker Hart]], [[Pitts Special]] and the [[Wright Flyer]].  The Stearman is particularly associated with stunt flying with wing-walkers.
