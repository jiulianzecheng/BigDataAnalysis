{{distinguish|Chemical precipitation}} 
 
 '''Precipitation''' is the falling of water from the [[atmosphere]]. It is a term in [[meteorology]], and includes [[rain]], [[snow]], [[sleet]], [[ice pellets]], [[dew]], [[frost]], and [[hail]]. These form by [[condensation]] from atmospheric [[water vapour|water vapor]], and fall under [[gravity]]. 
 
 [[Fog]] and [[mist]] are not precipitation but [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]]. In that case, the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate.  
 
 If liquid, precipitation can be measured using a [[rain gauge]]. The most common form of solid precipitation is [[snow]]. Snow is made when temperatures are so cold that water vapor changes directly to [[solid]] crystals. Frozen rain is [[hail]] or [[ice pellets]].
