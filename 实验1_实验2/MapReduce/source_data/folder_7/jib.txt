 A '''jib''' is a [[Triangle|triangular]] [[sail]] that sets ahead of the [[mast|foremast]] of a [[Sailing ship|sailing vessel]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.schoolofsailing.net/terminology.html |title=Terminology |website=School of Sailing |publisher=Blue Water Sailing School |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-date=December 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205002035/http://www.schoolofsailing.net/terminology.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Its [[tack (sail)|tack]] (lower leading edge) is [[wikt:attach|attach]]ed to the [[bowsprit]], to the [[bow (ship)|bow]], or to the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and [[spinnaker]]s are the two main types of [[headsail]]s on a modern boat. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.marinesurveyorschool.org/pages/sails.htm |title=About Sails |publisher=The Marine Surveyor School |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709065553/http://www.marinesurveyorschool.org/pages/sails.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 [[Schooner]]s typically have up to three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast [[forestay]] and is generally called the ''jib topsail''. A second jib on the main forestay is called ''the jib''. The innermost jib is called ''the staysail''. Actually, all three sails are both jibs and [[staysail (sail)|staysail]]s, in a general sense. A large [[square rig|square-rigged]] ship typically has four jibs, but could have as many as six. < ref name=mayne1 > {{cite book|last1=Richard Mayne|title=The Language of Sailing|url=https://archive.org/details/languageofsailin0000mayn|date=2000|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|isbn=1-57958-278-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/languageofsailin0000mayn/page/155 155]}} < /ref > < ref name=king256 > {{cite book|last1=Dean King|title=A Sea of Words|url=https://archive.org/details/seaofwordslexico0000king|date=2000|publisher=Henry Holt|isbn=978-0-8050-6615-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/seaofwordslexico0000king/page/256 256]|edition=3}} < /ref >   
 
 From forward ([[wikt:fore|fore]]) to the back of the boat ([[wikt:aft|aft]]), these sails are called: 
 * Jib of jibs 
 * Spindle jib 
 * Flying jib 
 * Outer jib 
 * Inner jib 
 * Fore ([[topmast]]) staysail. < ref name=mayne1/ > < ref name=king256/ > 
 
 The first two were rarely used except by [[clipper ships]] in light winds. < ref name=mayne1/ > < ref name=king256/ >  A storm jib was a small jib of heavy [[canvas]] set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad [[weather]]. < ref name=mayne1/ >

 Boats may be sailed using a jib alone. More commonly jib(s) make a minor direct contribution to moving the boat, compared to a [[mainsail]]. Generally, a jib's most important [[wikt:function|function]] is as an [[airfoil]], increasing [[wikt:performance|performance]] and overall [[stability]] of the mainsail. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.working-the-sails.com/how_a_boat_sails.html#Forward_Drive_ |title=How Sailboats Move - Sailing Theory Airfoil and Hydrofoil |publisher=Working The Sails.com |access-date=December 27, 2016 |archive-date=December 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212093423/http://www.working-the-sails.com/how_a_boat_sails.html#Forward_Drive_ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
   
 On boats with only one jib, it is common for the [[Parts of a sail#The corners|clew]] of the jib to be further aft than the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a ''genoa jib'' or simply a [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] (see illustration). These are efficiently used when [[reaching (sailing)| reaching]] more broadly than a [[close reach]]. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the mainsail is [[reef (sail)| reefed]]; these more rugged sails are called ''storm jibs'' or ''spitfires''. < ref name=oct > {{cite book |last=Torrey |first=Owen C., Jr. |title =Sails |publisher =Palmer  &  Oliver |edition =Seamen's Bank for Savings |date =1965 |location =New York |pages =20-25,36 & 37 }} < /ref > 
 
 On a boat with two staysails the inner sail is called the ''staysail'', and the outer (foremost) is called the jib. This combination of two staysails is called a ''cutter rig'' (or in North America a ''yankee pair'') and a boat with one mast rigged with two staysails and a mainsail is called a [[cutter (ship)|cutter]]. 
 
 On cruising yachts, and nearly all racing sailboats, the jib needs to be worked when [[wikt:tack|tack]]ing. On these yachts, there are two [[wikt:sheet|sheet]]s (ropes) attached to the [[Parts of a sail#The corners|clew]] of the jib. As the yacht comes [[Points of sail#Head to wind|head to wind]] during a tack, the active sheet is released. At the same time the other sheet (the ''lazy sheet'') on the other side of the boat is pulled in. This sheet becomes the new ''active sheet'' until the next tack.
