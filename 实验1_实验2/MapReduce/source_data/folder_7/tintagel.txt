 '''Tintagel''', formerly '''Trevena''', is a civil parish and village on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is about 5 miles from [[Boscastle]] and 6 miles from Camelford. The population of the parish is 1,820 people. The village and nearby [[Tintagel Castle]] are associated with the legends surrounding [[King Arthur]] and the knights of the Round Table. The village has, in recent times, become attractive to tourists from many parts of the world and is one of the most-visited places in Britain. The modern-day village of Tintagel was known as Trevena until the [[Post Office]] decided to call it 'Tintagel' in the mid 19th century (until then Tintagel had always been the name of the headland and of the parish). 
 
 In the village is the 'Old Post Office', which dates from the 14th century. It became a post office during the 19th century, and is now owned by the National Trust. There are three churches in Tintagel, the Anglican church of St Materiana on the cliffs, and Methodist and Roman Catholic churches in the village. 
 
 Scholars have found it hard to explain the origin of 'Tintagel' as a name: the most likely one to be correct is from Norman French, rather than from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. < ref > It is not  found in the Domesday Book, 1087, since Bossiney (Botcinii) was the name of the manor; not until the 12th century when Geoffrey of Monmouth's history mentions  " Tintagol " , and in records of 1200 there is  " Tintajoel " . Both Henry Jenner and Oliver Padel support a Norman French origin because of the soft  " g "  sound ('i/j' in the earliest forms) as against the hard  " g "  as in modern English ''girl''. < /ref > < ref > Padel, O.
