 A '''pentagram''' is a five-pointed star, with all lines the same length and all [[angle]]s the same. A 'pentangle', 'star pentagon', or 'pentalpha' means the same thing. It is a type of [[pentagon]]. 
 
 The word ''pentacle'' originally meant 'any symbol that defies against pureness  spirits'. There are many of such symbols, only a few of which include a pentagram. During the modern age of [[Wicca]], the word 'pentacle' acquired a second definition, due to sounding similar to the word 'pentagram', and the fact that wiccan pentacles use a pentagram. That second definition of 'pentacle' is 'a circumscribed pentagram', which means 'a pentagram drawn inside a circle so that the points of the pentagram touch the circle'. 
 
 The pentagram is a symbol of the devil aka Satan.

 Some [[Satanism|Satanists]], especially members of the [[Church of Satan]], use an upside-down pentacle as a symbol for their religion. The Church of Satan's official symbol is an upside-down pentacle with a [[goat]] head inside, called the ''Sigil of [[Baphomet]].'' < ref name= " costm " > {{cite web|url=http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/BaphometSigil.html|title=The Sigil of Satan|publisher=ChurchofSatan.com|accessdate=2012-11-10}} < /ref > < ref name= " usgovtm " > {{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc & state=4810:2zrjj.3.1 |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office |accessdate=November 10, 2012}} < /ref >  (A 'sigil' is a symbol of a supernatural being).

[[Anton LaVey]], who created the Church of Satan in 1966, took the idea from Levi.
