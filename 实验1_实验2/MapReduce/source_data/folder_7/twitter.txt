Twitter's main URL is still twitter.com, and the  " Twitter "  name and logo are still used in various locations, such as the help center and the developer platform.}}, is a [[social network service|social networking]] and [[microblogging]] service. Users use any device with an [[internet]] connection and a [[web browser]] to send and to read messages, called  " tweets " . For years, tweets could be up to 140 [[character (computing) |character]]s long, then doubled to 280 characters in November 2017. < ref name=max280/ >  Tweets appear on the user's profile [[webpage]]. Tweets can usually be read by anyone, but senders can also keep messages private. Private tweets only go to their list of friends. Users may [[Subscription|subscribe]] to tweets from other people. This is called ''following'', and subscribers are known as ''followers''. As of late 2009, users can also follow lists of authors. < ref name= " lists1 " > {{cite web |url=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/theres-list-for-that.html |title=There's a List for That |publisher=blog.twitter.com |date=October 30, 2009 |access-date=February 1, 2010 |archive-date=April 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429143525/http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/theres-list-for-that.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref name= " lists2 " > {{cite web |url=http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/76460 |title=Twitter Lists! |publisher=help.twitter.com |date=November 9, 2009 |access-date=February 1, 2010 |archive-date=December 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222223731/http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/76460 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 Twitter started at a [[podcast]]ing company [[Odeo]]. The company board members had a  " daylong brainstorming session " . During the meeting, [[Jack Dorsey]] introduced the idea of one person using an [[SMS]] service to communicate with a small group. At first, they called this project  " twttr " . It fit the five-character length of American SMS [[short code]]s and sounded like  " [[Flickr]] " . At first, the developers planned to use  " 10958 "  as a short code. Later they changed it to  " 40404 "  because it was easier to remember and type. < ref name=HowTwitterWasBorn > {{cite web|url=http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/|title=How Twitter Was Born|publisher=140 Characters|date=January 30, 2009|first=Dom|last=Sagolla|access-date=June 25, 2009|archive-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508105855/http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM [[Pacific Standard Time]] (PST) March 21, 2006.

Now applications must use [[OAuth]] to connect to Twitter. This method means that users do not have to give their [[password]]s to the third-party applications. Changing the [[login]] system to OAuth did cause some problems. Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords. However, now third-party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all. The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users  " increased security and a better experience.

 ===Interface=== 
 On April 30, 2009, Twitter changed the way it looks on the web. They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with  " [[trending topic|Trending Topics]] " . That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages. [[Biz Stone]] explained that all messages are instantly [[Index (search engine)|indexed]] and explained the results of the change. The Trending Topics has made Twitter something  " unexpectedly important — a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now. " < ref > {{cite web|access-date=May 7, 2008|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/04/twitter-search-for-everyone.html|title=Twitter Search for Everyone!|publisher=Twitter|date=April 30, 2009|last=Stone|first=Biz|author-link=Biz Stone|archive-date=April 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429171643/http://blog.twitter.com/2009/04/twitter-search-for-everyone.html|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Service problems=== 
 Sometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and cannot access the website. They cannot read or write tweets but only see the ''[[Fail Whale]]'' image created by Yiying Lu, < ref > {{Cite news|first=Rob|last=Walker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15wwln_consumed-t.html?_r=2|title=Fail Whale|work=Consumed|publisher=New York Times Magazine|page=17|date=February 15, 2009|access-date=February 15, 2009|archive-date=March 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210311125559/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15wwln_consumed-t.html?_r=2|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 Twitter worked well approximately 98% of the time in 2007. That is about six full days of no service. < ref name= " downtime2 " > {{cite web|access-date=June 17, 2009|url=http://royal.pingdom.com/2007/12/19/twitter-growing-pains-cause-lots-of-downtime-in-2007/|title=Twitter growing pains cause lots of downtime in 2007|publisher=Pingdom|date=December 19, 2007|archive-date=December 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229114042/http://royal.pingdom.com/2007/12/19/twitter-growing-pains-cause-lots-of-downtime-in-2007/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 [[Macworld Conference  &  Expo]] [[keynote|keynote address]]. < ref name= " downtime3 " > {{cite web|access-date=May 7, 2008|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2008/01/macworld.html|title=MacWorld|publisher=Twitter|date=January 15, 2008|author=Dorsey, Jack|archive-date=April 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412200750/http://blog.twitter.com/2008/01/macworld.html|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name= " downtime4 " > {{cite web|access-date=May 7, 2008|url=http://theappslab.com/2008/01/15/macworld-brings-twitter-to-its-knees/|title=MacWorld Brings Twitter to its Knees|publisher=Oracle AppsLab|date=January 15, 2008|author=Kuramoto, Jake|archive-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221537/http://theappslab.com/2008/01/15/macworld-brings-twitter-to-its-knees/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 *May 2008, Twitter's new engineering team made changes to the structure of Twitter to handle the amount of growth. Problems with stability caused the service to stop working sometimes and forced Twitter to cancel some features for a short time. 
 *August 2008, Twitter stopped free [[SMS]] services for users in the United Kingdom < ref > {{cite web |access-date=June 14, 2009 |url=http://blog.twitter.com/2008/08/changes-for-some-sms-usersgood-and-bad.html |title=Changes for Some SMS Users—Good and Bad News |publisher=Twitter (blog) |date=August 13, 2008 |archive-date=June 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618143403/http://blog.twitter.com/2008/08/changes-for-some-sms-usersgood-and-bad.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  and for approximately five months instant messaging support via a [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] [[Internet bot|bot]] was listed as being  " temporarily unavailable " . < ref > {{cite web |url=http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/twitter_im_down_may_23rd_may24th |date=May 23, 2008 |first=Jack |last=Dorsey |author-link=Jack Dorsey |title=Twitter IM down May 23rd–May 24th |publisher=[[Get Satisfaction]] |access-date=July 29, 2008 |archive-date=July 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729013427/http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/twitter_im_down_may_23rd_may24th |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 *June 12, 2009, there was a serious problem with the unique number that identifies each tweet. This was called a possible  " Twitpocalypse " . (This is a combination of Twitter and [[apocalypse]]). The number that labels each tweet went beyond the limit of [[32-bit]] signed [[integer (computer science)|integers]]. That limit was 2,147,483,647 messages. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/12/all-hell-may-break-loose-on-twitter-in-2-hours/|title=Twitter Moves Up The Twitpocalypse.

 *September 22, 2009, the identifier went past the limit for 32-bit ''unsigned'' integers (4,294,967,296 total messages). This broke some third-party applications again. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/twitpocalypse-ii-update/ |title=Twitpocalypse II: Twitter Apps Might Break Tomorrow |first=Ben |last=Parr |website=[[Mashable]] |date=September 21, 2009 |access-date=September 23, 2009 |archive-date=December 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225082058/http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/twitpocalypse-ii-update/ |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 *August 6, 2009, Twitter and [[Facebook]] both suffered a [[denial-of-service attack]]. This stopped the Twitter website from working for several hours. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=219100308|title=Twitter Downed By Denial Of Service Attack|publisher=[[InformationWeek]]|first=Thomas|last=Claburn|date=August 6, 2009|access-date=August 6, 2009|archive-date=August 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808212046/http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/attacks/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=219100308|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The attacks were actually directed at one [[Georgia (country)|pro-Georgian]] user around the anniversary of the [[2008 South Ossetia War]], rather than the sites themselves. < ref > {{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8189162.stm |title=Web attack 'aimed at one blogger' |publisher=BBC News |date=August 7, 2009 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |archive-date=March 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309164844/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8189162.stm |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 *December 17, 2009, a hacking attack replaced the website's welcoming screen for almost one hour. Users saw an image of a green flag and the words  " This site has been hacked by Iranian Cyber Army " . So far there is no proof of any connection between the hackers and the government of Iran. < ref > {{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/18/twitter.hacked/index.html |title=CNN: Twitter attacked |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=December 18, 2009 |access-date=March 28, 2010 |archive-date=November 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115232203/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/12/18/twitter.hacked/index.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Open source=== 
 Twitter developed several software projects to improve their own service. The company shared these as [[open source]] software. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/about/opensource |title=Twitter / OpenSource |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=2010-06-01 |archive-date=2010-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602014659/http://twitter.com/about/opensource |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Some of these software projects are related to databases, such as the [[Gizzard (scala framework)|Gizzard Scala framework]] and a distributed graph database called [[FlockDB]]. 
 
 ==t.co== 
 '''t.co''' is a service created by Twitter to make [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] shorter. < ref name=twitterhelpshort > {{cite web |url=http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623 |title=About Twitter's Link Service (http://t.co) |access-date=2010-09-03 |archive-date=2011-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225203154/http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter.

 ===History of t.co=== 
 [[File:Twitter Logo.png|thumb|100px|Logo of t.co]] 
 Twitter had used the services from other sites such as [[TinyURL]] and [[bit.ly]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-switches-from-tinyurl-to-bitly-2009-5 |title=Twitter Switches From TinyURL To Bit.ly |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=2010-09-05 |archive-date=2013-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308105113/http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-switches-from-tinyurl-to-bitly-2009-5 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010. They used the domain, twt.tl, < ref name=twitterblog / >  before they bought the t.co domain. 
 
 The company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site: @TwitterAPI, @rsarver, and @raffi. < ref name=twitterblog / > 
 
 On September 2, 2010, Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them. 
 
 ==Other== 
 Twitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/27/i-cant-believe-some-people-are-still-saying-twitter-isnt-a-news-source |title=I Can't Believe Some People Are Still Saying Twitter Isn't a News Source |access-date=2009-10-21 |publisher=TechCrunch |archive-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020224156/http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/27/i-cant-believe-some-people-are-still-saying-twitter-isnt-a-news-source/ |url-status=live }} < /ref >
