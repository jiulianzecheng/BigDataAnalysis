'''Goheimochi''' is a local [[cuisine]] made in the mountains in the [[ChÅ«bu region]] of [[Japan]]. It started in the [[Edo period]], when [[rice]] was very valuable. Pounded [[rice]] is wrapped around a thin wooden stick, then grilled with [[miso]], sugar, and [[mirin]]. [[Soy sauce]], [[sesame]], and [[walnut]]s can also be used. It is particularly famous in [[Nagano Prefecture]] where it is shaped like [[dango]] or traditional Japanese straw sandals called ''waraji''. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/food/recipe/kyou_20184.html|title=Goheimochi Rice Cake - Japanese Food - NHK WORLD|work=NHK WORLD|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en|archive-date=2017-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120085135/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/food/recipe/kyou_20184.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
