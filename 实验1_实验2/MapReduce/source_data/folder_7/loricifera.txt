 '''Loricifera'''  < ref > from [[Latin]], ''lorica'', [[corset]] + ''ferre'', to bear < /ref >  is a recently discovered [[ecdysozoa]]n [[phylum]] of [[Ocean|marine]] animals. The phylum includes the first animals known to exist in a completely [[anoxic]] environment (no oxygen at all). < ref name=Nature/ >  The phylum was described in 1983 by Reinhardt Kristensen. < ref name=Heiner > Heiner I.  &  Kristensen R.H. 2005. Two new species of the genus ''Pliciloricus'' (Loricifera, Pliciloricidae) from the Faroe Bank, North Atlantic. ''Zoologischer Anzeiger''. '''243''': 121–138. < /ref > 
 
 They are a [[phylum]] of very small animals which live in [[sediment]]. There are now twenty-two described [[species]], in eight [[genera]]. < ref name=anzieger > Gad G. 2005.

Toronto: Brooks/Cole—Thomson. p776. < /ref >  In addition, there are about 100 more species which have been collected, but not yet described. < ref name=anzieger/ >  Their size ranges from 100 & nbsp;µm to about 1 & nbsp;mm. < ref name=Heiner2005 > Heiner I. 2005.

 Their habitat is in the spaces between marine [[Particle size (grain size)|gravel]] to which they attach themselves. They are among the most recently discovered groups of [[Metazoan]]s. < ref name=dane > Kristensen, R.M. 2002. An introduction to Loricifera, Cycliophora, and Micrognathozoa. ''Integrative and Comparative Biology''. '''42''': 641–651. < /ref >  They attach themselves quite firmly to the gravel, and this explains why they remained undiscovered for so long. < ref name=Ruppert/ >  The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and later described in 1983. < ref name=dane/ >  They are found at all depths of water, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes. < ref name=Ruppert/ >  They have not yet been found in the fossil record. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 These animals have a protective outer case called a [[lorica]]. Protected by the lorica, the animals have a head, mouth and digestive system. Development is usually direct, though there are larvae in some species. The animals have two sexes as adults. There are some complex and flexible [[life cycle]]s with different forms of [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] reproduction. < ref name=anzieger/ > 
 
 Their closest relatives are thought to be the [[Kinorhyncha]] and [[Priapulida]], with whom they share some characteristics. Together they make up the clade [[Scalidophora]]. < ref name=Heiner/ > < ref name=dane/ > 
 
 == In anoxic environments ==

 Three species of Loricifera have been found in the sediments at the bottom of the [[L'Atalante basin]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The 'surface' of this basin is 3,500 meters down. They are the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an oxygen-free environment. It is thought they are able to do this because they rely on [[organelle]]s which, unlike normal [[mitochondria]], do not use oxygen for their energy cycle. < ref name= " Nature " > {{Cite journal|last=Fang|first=Janet|date=2010|title=Animals thrive without oxygen at sea bottom|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100406/full/464825b.html|journal=Nature|volume=464|issue=7290|page=825|doi=10.1038/464825b|pmid=20376121|id=|s2cid=4340458|accessdate=2010-04-06}} < /ref > < ref name= " Science News " > {{Cite journal| last = Milius| first = Susan| title = Multicelled animals may live oxygen-free| journal = Science News| publisher = Society for Science and the Public| date = 2010| url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/58154| accessdate = 11 April 2010| archive-date = 23 May 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100523023212/http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/58154| url-status = dead}} < /ref > < ref > Oren A.

 The newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of [[light]] and [[oxygen]], and they are less than a millimetre in size. < ref name= " Mentel 2010 " / >  They were collected from the deep basin where they live in a nearly [[salt]]-[[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[brine]]. This brine, because of its density, does not mix with the waters above. < ref name= " Mentel 2010 " / >  As a result, the brine is completely anoxic, and high in [[ammonia]]. Also, due to the action of [[sulphate]] reducers, it contains [[sulphide]] at a high concentration. < ref name= " Mentel 2010 " / >  In the brine, the abundance of cells is not high. [[Extremophile]]s predominate, including members of the deep-sea [[hydrothermal vent]] community of [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. < ref name=Yakimov > Yakimov, Michail M. ''et al.'' 2007.
