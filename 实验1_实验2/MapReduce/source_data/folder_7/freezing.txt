'''Freezing''' is the [[wikt:process|process]] when a [[liquid]] turns into a [[solid]]. Freezing occurs when [[heat]] is lost from an object, which causes the [[molecule]]s to slow down and form tighter [[Chemical bond|bonds]]. One example of freezing is when water turns into [[ice]]. Freezing is the opposite of melting, and two steps away from [[evaporation]]. Freezing occurs at below 0 degrees Celsius with water, while some other liquids become a solid at higher or lower temperatures. 
 
 Most liquids can freeze. It is a necessary step in [[casting (metalworking)|casting]] for example.
