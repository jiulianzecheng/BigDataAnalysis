 '''Evil''' means something which is morally bad or wicked. < ref > ''Concise Oxford Dictionary''. < /ref >  It is the opposite of [[Goodness|good]]. People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the [[Ten Commandments]] is evil. A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil. 
 
 == Logical problem of evil == 
 A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by [[Epicurus]], < ref > Perhaps wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his [[Christian]] perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Reinhold Glei, the argument of theodicy is from a source which is anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei 1988. ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20-21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''42''' pp. 47-58 < /ref >  goes as follows: < ref > Larrimore M.J. 2001. ''The problem of evil''. Wiley-Blackwell. < /ref > 
 # If a perfectly good god exists, then evil does not. 
 # There is evil in the world. 
 # Therefore, a perfectly good god does not exist. 
 
 Another argument goes: 
 # God exists. 
 # God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good. 
 # A perfectly good being would want to prevent all evils. 
 # An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence. 
 # An omnipotent being, who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence. 
 # A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil. 
 # If there exists an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good being, then no evil exists. 
 # Evil exists (logical contradiction). < ref name= " IepEvidential " > The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The evidential problem of evil] Nick Trakakis < /ref > 
 
 Arguments such as these are about the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[statement|proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[wikt:contradiction|contradiction]] and so cannot all be correct. 
 
 ==Theology== 
 A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as  " God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of [[free will]] "  are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. < ref > {{cite book |title=Introducing philosophy of religion |url=https://archive.org/details/introducingphilo00meis |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415403276 |page=[https://archive.org/details/introducingphilo00meis/page/n146 134]}} < /ref >  Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are ''logically incompatible'', even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose. < ref name= " IepLogical " > The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. [http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The logical problem of evil] James R. Beebe < /ref > 
 
 In [[theology]], there is a question: ''If there is a [[God]], why does God let evil happen?'' Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose ''not'' to do evil. < ref name= " Stanford " > {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Michael|last=Tooley|accessdate=2012-07-07}} < /ref > 
 
 Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of [[empiricism]]. For [[logical positivism]] the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of [[wikt:verify|verification]]. In their view, this makes the proposition  " God exists " , not true or false, but meaningless. < ref > Ayer A.J 1936 [2nd ed 1946]. ''Language, truth and logic''. Gollancz, London. < /ref >  A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified. < ref > Lakatos, Imre 1976. ''Proofs and refutations''. Cambridge. < /ref >

 The study of good and evil in [[philosophy]] is called [[ethics]]. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good. Christians believe that at the [[Second Coming]] of [[Christ]], God will put an end to evil and the works of the [[Devil]]- see the end of the [[Book of Revelation]]. In movies or TV series evil people are often called [[villain]]s. Political actions are sometimes viewed as evil such as authoritarianism, [[ableism]], [[corruption]] or censorship. People disagree on why people do evil things. Religious people may think that it is the result of listening to an evil being such as the devil or [[sin]]. Others think it happens because of mental issues like anger, mental illness or revenge. Certain types of behavior are also often seen as universally evil, such as [[Murder|killing]], [[Lie|lying]] or [[Theft|stealing]]. Sex crimes such as [[rape]], [[hebephilia]] or [[pedophilia]] are also often seen as evil in basically every [[culture]] or [[society]].  < ref > Baaz, Maria Eriksson, and Maria Stern.  " Why do soldiers rape? Masculinity, violence, and sexuality in the armed forces in the Congo (DRC). "  International Studies Quarterly 53.2 (2009): 495-518 < /ref >
