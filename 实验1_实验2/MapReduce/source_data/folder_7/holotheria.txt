The '''Holotheria''' are a group of [[mammal]]s.  
 
 They are the descendants of the last common ancestor of ''[[Kuehneotherium]]'' and the [[Theria]]. The Theria are the group which includes [[marsupial]]s and [[placental mammal]]s. < ref name=wibleetal2001 > Wible J.R; Rougier G.W; Novacek M.J.  &  McKenna M.C. 2001. Earliest eutherian ear region: a petrosal referred to ''Prokennalestes'' from the Early Cretaceous of Mongolia " . ''American Museum Novitates'', '''3322'''. < /ref > 
 
 Therefore, the group does not include the [[monotremes]].
