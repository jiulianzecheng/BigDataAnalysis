 The '''Cercopithecinae''' are an important [[subfamily]] of [[Old World monkey]]s. There are 12 [[genera]] and about 71 [[species]]. the [[baboon]]s, the [[macaque]]s and the [[vervet monkey]]s. 
 
 Most of then live in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], but the [[macaques]] range from the far eastern parts of [[Asia]] through northern [[Africa]], and [[Gibraltar]]. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The various species are [[adapted]] to the different terrains they inhabit. Tree-dwelling ([[arboreal]]) species are slim, delicate and have a long tail. [[terrestrial animal|Ground-dwelling]] species are heavier, and their tail may be small or nonexistent. All species have well-developed [[thumb]]s. 
 
 Like many Old World monkeys, they have pads on their bottoms. These are called ''ischial callosities''. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://monkeybuiznezz.wordpress.com/tag/ischial-callosities/|title=Ischial callosities|publisher=MonkeyBuiznezz|access-date=2014-02-12}} < /ref >  They let the monkeys sleep sitting upright on thin branches, beyond reach of predators, without falling off. In some species, these pads change their colour during the mating period. < ref > Steudel K. 1981. Functional aspects of primate pelvic structure: a multivariate approach.

 These monkeys are active in the [[diurnal|daytime]], and live together in social groups. They live in all types of terrain and climate, from cool mountains to rain forests, [[savanna]]h, bald rocky areas or even snowy mountains, as does the [[Japanese macaque]]. 
 
 Most species are [[omnivorous]], with diets ranging from fruits, leaves, seeds, buds, and mushrooms to insects and spiders to smaller vertebrates. All species have cheek pouches in which they can store food. < ref > {{cite book|last=Strier|first=Karen B.|title=Primate behavioral ecology|url=https://archive.org/details/primatebehaviora0000stri_u6i0|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=9780205444328|pages=[https://archive.org/details/primatebehaviora0000stri_u6i0/page/61 61]|edition=3rd}} < /ref > 
 
 Gestation lasts approximately six to seven months. Young are weaned after three to 12 months and are fully mature within three to five years. The life expectancy of some species can be as long as 50 years.
