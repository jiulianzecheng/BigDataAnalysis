[[Image:Nightie.jpg|thumb|A Nightgown]] 
 A '''nightgown''' or '''nightdress''' is a [[gown]] worn for [[sleep]]ing. It is usually loose-fitting. There are different lengths, [[hip]]-length (called ''baby-doll''), floor-length (called ''négligée'') or [[knee]]-length. 
 
 Men wore them until about the 1940s when they changed to [[pajamas]]. Today, they are mostly worn by women.
