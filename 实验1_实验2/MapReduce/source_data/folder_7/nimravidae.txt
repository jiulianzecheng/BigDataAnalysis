 The '''Nimravidae''' is an [[extinct]] [[Family (biology)|family]] in the [[Carnivora]]. It is a type of [[cat]]-like [[mammal]] in the [[suborder]] [[Feliformia]]. 
 They lived in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] from the [[Eocene]] through the [[Miocene]] epochs, 42–20 million years ago (mya). They lasted for about 22 million years. < ref > [http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo & taxon_no=41036 & is_real_user=1 PaleoBiology Database: ''Nimravidae'', basic info] < /ref > 
 
 Although some nimravids physically resembled the [[saber-toothed cat|sabre-toothed cat]]s of genus ''[[Smilodon]]'', they were not closely related, but [[evolved]] a similar form through [[parallel evolution]]. 
 
 The ancestors of nimravids and [[Felidae|felids]] diverged from their common ancestor about 50 mya. Most had muscular, low-slung, catlike bodies, but with shorter legs and tails. 
 
 == Teeth == 
 Some nimravids did evolve into large toothed cat-like forms with massive flattened upper [[Canine teeth|canines]] and mandibular flanges. < ref > The function of these flanges was to protect the flattened canine teeth. < /ref >  Others had teeth similar to modern cats, with smaller canines. Some had canines more intermediate relationship between the [[saber-toothed cat]]s and felids. These differences must have reflected different methods of attacking their [[prey]]. 
 
 Not only did nimravids have varied tooth styles, but they also showed the same range of size size and shape as felids. Some were [[leopard]]-sized, others the size of today's [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, and one had the short face, rounded skull and smaller canines of the modern [[cheetah]].
