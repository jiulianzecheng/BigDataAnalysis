 The '''[[Roman province]] of Dacia''' was in the [[Balkans]]. It included [[Transylvania]], [[Banat]] and [[Oltenia]] in the modern [[Romania]], and [[Muntenia]] and southern [[Moldova]]. It did not include the nearby regions of [[Moesia]]. 
 
 It was a big [[district]] in [[Central Europe]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The northern part of the [[border]] was made up of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]; the southern part of the border of Dacia was made up of the [[Danube|Danube River]], and the western part of the border of Dacia was made up of the [[Tisza|Tisza River]]. Along the borders many Roman strongpoints built. The Dacia [[district]] protected the Empire from foreign tribes of the north east side. 
 
 The place where Dacia once was is now made up of [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], along with some parts of [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ukraine]]. The capital of Dacia was [[Sarmizegetusa]]. The name of [[Romania]] came probably from the idea of the former  " Romans country " . 
 
 Dacia was added to the [[Roman Empire]] in its earliest days by the Emperor [[Trajan]]. Despite its wealth, it was the first province from which Rome withdrew.
