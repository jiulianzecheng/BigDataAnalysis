 ==History== 
 [[File: " Craw Stane "  with Tap O'Noth in background - geograph.org.uk - 1163017.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The  " Craw Stane " , a Pictish symbol stone depicting a salmon and an unknown animal]] 
 Eight Pictish [[symbol]] [[stone]]s have been found at Rhynie. These include the  " Rhynie Man " , discovered in 1978. It is a six foot tall boulder [[wikt:carve|carved]] with a bearded man carrying an [[axe]]. It may possibly be the [[Celt|Celtic]] god [[Esus]]. 
 
 The  " Rhynie Man "  now stands inside Woodhill House (the headquarters of the Aberdeenshire Council ) in [[Aberdeen]]. < ref name= " scotsman-2011-11-16 " > {{Cite news | last=Urquhart | first=Frank | title=Archaeologists find village fit for Pictish kings | url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/historic-sites/archaeologists_find_village_fit_for_pictish_kings_1_1968963 | publisher=[[The Scotsman]] | date=16 November 2011 | access-date=29 June 2015 | archive-date=21 December 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221032115/http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/historic-sites/archaeologists_find_village_fit_for_pictish_kings_1_1968963 | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2011, [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[wikt:excavate|excavations]] at Rhynie, near the site of the  " Rhynie Man " , dug up a [[defensive wall|fortified]] [[settlement]]. It dates to the early [[medieval]] period.  Among the finds at the site were fragments of a late 5th or 6th century Roman [[amphora]]. It is the only known example of a Roman amphora from Eastern Britain that dates to the post-Roman period. This must have been [[import]]ed from the [[Mediterranean]] [[region]]. It means that the [[inhabitant]]s of the settlement must have been of high [[status]].  Archaeologists have said that the settlement may have been a [[royal family]] site where Pictish kings lived. < ref name= " scotsman-2011-11-16 " / >
