 '''''Upwelling''''' is a rise of water from deep cold water towards the [[ocean]] surface.  
 
 Upwelling occurs in the open ocean and along [[Coast|coastlines]]. The reverse process, called “downwelling,” also occurs when wind causes surface water to build up along a coastline and the surface water eventually sinks toward the bottom. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is upwelling?|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/upwelling.html|access-date=5 August 2021|website=NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research|language=EN-US}} < /ref >
