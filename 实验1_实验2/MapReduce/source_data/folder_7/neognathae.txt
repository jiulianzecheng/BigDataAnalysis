 '''Neognathae''' are birds in the subclass [[Neornithes]]. The Neognathae include almost all living birds: their sister taxon [[Palaeognathae]] has just the [[tinamou]] and the flightless [[ratite]]s. 
 
 There are nearly 10,000 species of neognaths. Since the [[Cretaceous]] they have undergone an [[adaptive radiation]]. This has produced the variety of form, [[Function (biology)|function]], and [[behavior]] which we see today. The [[Passerine bird|Passeriformes]] (perching birds) are the largest order of land vertebrates. They are some 60% of living birds. 
 
 The neognaths have fused [[metacarpus|hand bones]], an elongate third finger, and 13 or fewer vertebrae. They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones.  " Neognathae "  means  " new jaws "  but, ironically, paleognath jaws are one of the few [[derived]]) features of that group.
