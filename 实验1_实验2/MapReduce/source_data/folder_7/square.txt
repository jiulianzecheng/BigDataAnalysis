 A '''square''' is a [[shape]] with four equal sides and four corners that are all [[right angle]]s (90 degrees). The [[diagonal]]s of a square also cross at right angles. The angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees. A square has rotational [[symmetry]] of four. It has four lines of regular symmetry. A square with vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' can be written as  < math > \square ABCD < /math > . < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-02|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Square|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Square.html|access-date=2020-09-02|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 A square is a type of [[rectangle]] with all sides of equal [[length]]. However, while a square is a type of rectangle and rhombus, < ref > {{Cite web|title=Quadrilaterals - Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Trapezoid, Parallelogram|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/quadrilaterals.html|access-date=2020-09-02|website=www.mathsisfun.com}} < /ref >  the opposite does not need to be true. 
 
 A square is also the 2-dimensional analogue of a [[cube]].
