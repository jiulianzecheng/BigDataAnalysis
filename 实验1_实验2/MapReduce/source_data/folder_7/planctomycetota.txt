 Planctomycetes are a group ([[phylum]]) of [[gram-negative]] bacteria that can be found in marine habitats including oceans, freshwater lakes, wastewater but also terrestrial habitats like soils. Approximately 11% of marine microbial communities is occupied by this phylum. They grow very slowly compared to other bacteria phylum. The majority of Planctomycetota [[species]] reproduce by [[binary fission]] which is when the bacterium divides into two (or more) and each part regenerates to become a new cell which resembles the original cell; < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Makar|first1=A.

 Planctomycetes were only discovered to be a bacterium in 1972 even though they were first discovered back in 1924. They were first wrongly identified as a [[eukaryote]] because their cells are unusually structured compared to majority of bacteria cells and looked more similar to eukaryotes. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=R.

 This phylum is part of the PVC superphylum which is a superphylum that contains and is named after [[Plantomycetes]], [[Verrucomicrobia]] and [[Chlamydiae]]. The two classes that are part of the Planctomycetota are [[Planctomycetia]] and [[Phycisphaerae]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Planctomycetes have been identified as a potential source for bioactive molecules which are compounds that can possibly encourage great health. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Planctomycetes are heavily involved in producing nitrogen gas with an estimated 30-50% of nitrogen gas in the oceans produced by this phylum. This aids nitrogen production for the [[nitrogen cycle]] which is the process of nitrogen transforming into different forms where it is used by many organisms to stay alive.
