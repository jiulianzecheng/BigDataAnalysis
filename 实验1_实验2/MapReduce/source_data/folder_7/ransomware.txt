'''Ransomware''' is a type of [[malware]]. It restricts access to the [[computer system]] that it [[wikt:infect|infect]]s all the [[data]] that it stores (often using [[encryption]] techniques), and demands a [[ransom]] be paid to the creator(s) of the malware. This is in order for the restriction to be removed. Some forms of ransomware [[Cryptography|encrypt files]] on the system's [[hard disk]]. Others may simply lock the system and [[scareware|display messages]] intended to [[wikt:persuade|persuade]] the user to pay. < ref name= " FBI " > {{Cite web|title=New Internet scam: Ransomware...|publisher=FBI|date=Aug 9, 2012|url=http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/august/new-internet-scam/new-internet-scam}} < /ref > 
 
 Ransomware first became [[wikt:popular|popular]] in [[Russia]]. Now the use of ransomware [[Internet fraud|scams]] has grown [[international]]ly. In June 2013, [[McAfee]] said it had collected over 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first three months of 2013. This is more than double the number of the previous year. < ref name=infoworld-mcafeeransom > {{cite web|title=Update: McAfee: Cyber criminals using Android malware and ransomware the most|url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/security/mcafee-cyber-criminals-using-android-malware-and-ransomware-the-most-219916|work=InfoWorld|access-date=28 March 2015}} < /ref >  [[CryptoLocker]], a ransomware [[Computer worm|worm]] that surfaced in late-2013, had collected an estimated $3 [[million]] [[USD]] before it was taken down by [[Authority|authorities]]. < ref name=cl-takedown > {{cite news|title=Cryptolocker victims to get files back for free|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28661463|access-date=28 March 2015|agency=BBC News|date=6 August 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 In May 2017, a piece of ransomware called [[:en:WannaCry_ransomware_attack|WannaCry]] spread around the world. It lasted four days and affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-15/ransomware-attack-to-hit-victims-in-australia-government-says/8526346|title=Ransomware attack still looms in Australia as Government warns WannaCry threat not over|last=Belot|first=Henry|date=16 May 2017|access-date=14 January 2018}} < /ref >  Only about $130,000 (USD) was ever paid in ransom, but the attack affected a lot of large companies and organizations. The United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]] (NHS) was hit hard by WannaCry. Hospitals could not access their files, and so many surgeries were cancelled and patients had to be turned away. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39907965|title=Cyber-attack 'unprecedented' in scale|date=2017-05-13|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-GB}} < /ref >  The NHS was especially at risk because it was using a version of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system called [[Windows XP]] that [[Microsoft]] no longer supported. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jpgb3y/nhs-hospitals-are-running-thousands-of-computers-on-unsupported-windows-xp|title=NHS Hospitals Are Running Thousands of Computers on Unsupported Windows XP|date=2016-09-29|newspaper=Motherboard|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-us}} < /ref >  This meant that Microsoft had not been sending out security updates for this version of Windows, leaving it open to the WannaCry virus. Other systems were affected even though they were running newer versions of Windows, because their users had not yet installed the most recent security updates. Even though it was not designed to actually damage computers or their files, WannaCry led to a lot of wasted time and money, showing how vulnerable the world still is to ransomware attacks.
