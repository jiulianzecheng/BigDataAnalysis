 }} < /ref >  [[Cuba]] and [[Venezuela]] do not see the group as terrorist. They instead refer to the group as “insurgents”.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]], for example, publicly rejected this classification of ''terrorists'' in January of 2008. He called on Colombia and other world governments to recognize the guerrillas as a ''belligerent force''.

 The FARC was established in the 1960s as the [[military]] wing of the [[Colombian Communist Party]]. The group started as a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement.  It became involved with trading [[illegal drugs]] during the 1980s. < ref name= " drugrelation " > {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Colombia's most powerful rebels|date=19 September 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1746777.stm|access-date=7 April 2007}} < /ref >  This caused an official separation from the Communist Party and the formation of a political structure it calls the [[Clandestine Colombian Communist Party]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}} 
 The FARC-EP still claims to be a guerrilla movement. According to the Colombian government, FARC has an estimated 6,000-8,000 members in 2008, down from 16,000 in 2001. < ref name= " BBC estimate " > {{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title= " Colombia's rebels: A fading force?

 In June 2016, the FARC signed a ceasefire accord with the [[President of Colombia]], [[Juan Manuel Santos]] in [[Havana]].
