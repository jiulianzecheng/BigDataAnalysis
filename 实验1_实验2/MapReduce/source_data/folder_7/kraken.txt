 A '''kraken''' is an imaginary sea [[monster]] of huge size, said to have dwelt off the coasts of [[Norway]], [[Greenland]], and [[Iceland]]. The legend may actually have originated from sightings of real [[giant squid]]. They are estimated to grow to 13–15 m (40–50 & nbsp;ft) in length, including the tentacles. 
 
 The mysterious sea monster started to be talked about in literary works as far back as 1180, according to paleontologist Rodrigo Brincalepe Salvador.
