 '''''Procompsognathus''''' was a small, speedy [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. This meat-eater lived during the late [[Triassic]] period, about 210 million years ago (mya). It probably ate [[insect]]s and [[lizard]]s in a relatively dry, inland environment. < ref > Frances Freedman  &  Tony Gibbons 1997.

 ''Procompsognathus'' may have been about one meter long (3.3 & nbsp;ft), < ref name= " Holtz2008 " > Holtz, Thomas R.

 A [[biped]], ''Procompsognathus'' had long hind legs, short arms, large clawed hands, a long slender snout with many small teeth, and a stiff tail. The [[tibia]] is approximately 20% longer than the [[femur]] in ''Procompsognathus''. This suggests that they were good runners. < ref > Coombs W.P Jr. 1978.
