 '''Genocide''' is the crime of trying to destroy an [[ethnic group|ethnic]], [[Race|racial]], [[Nation|national]] or [[Religion|religious]] group. Genocides are done by [[Murder|killing]] and harming the group, preventing them from being able to live (like starving them), or by [[Cultural assimilation|assimilating]] them, stopping them from having kids and destroying their identity.  
 
 Genocide is usually done by governments and large armies or [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. Genocide is often motivated by hatred or fear of the group, and for political reasons. 
 
 The word genocide was made up by [[Raphael Lemkin]], a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Jew]], in 1944, from the words  " genos "  ([[Greek language|Greek]] for family, tribe or race) and  " -cide "  (from the [[Latin]]  " occidere " , to kill). It was first used to the Nazi [[Holocaust]], when many groups, including Jews and others, were killed. 
 
 Ustashe of Croatia are another example of genocidial horror. About a million of Serbs were killed during WWII in Ustashe death camps especially in Jasenovac. Another example of genocide was when about a million of the [[Tutsi]] group of people of [[Rwanda]] were killed along with [[Hutu]]s who were against [[Rwandan Genocide|the genocide]] in 1994. 
 
 In 1933 Lemkin made a speech to the Legal Council of the [[League of Nations]] conference on [[international]] criminal law in [[Madrid]], for which he prepared an essay on the ''Crime of Barbarity'' as a crime against international law. The purpose of the [[crime]], which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based mostly on the experience of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] < ref name= " Raphael Lemkin " > [http://www.europaworld.org/issue40/raphaellemkin22601.htm Raphael Lemkin] - EuropeWorld, 22/6/2001 < /ref >  [[Simele massacre|massacred]] in [[Iraq]] on 11 August 1933. The event in Iraq reminded him of earlier similar events of the [[Armenian Genocide]] during [[World War I]]. < ref name= " Raphael Lemkin " / > 
 
 Today, any genocide is prohibited by the [[Genocide Convention]] and actor or inciter of genocide is judged by the [[International Criminal Court]].
