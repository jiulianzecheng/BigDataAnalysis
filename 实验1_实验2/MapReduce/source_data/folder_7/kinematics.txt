'''Kinematics''' is the branch of [[classical mechanics]] which describes the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of points, bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without looking at the cause of this motion. < ref name= " Whittaker " >

 To describe motion, kinematics studies the paths of points, [[line|lines]] and other [[geometry|geometric]] objects in [[Space (physics)|space]], and some of their properties such as [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]]. [[Astrophysics]] uses kinematics to describe the motion of [[celestial bodies]] and systems. [[Mechanical engineering]], [[robotics]] and [[biomechanics]] use it  to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts  such as an [[engine]], a robotic arm or the [[Human skeleton|skeleton]] of the [[human]] [[body]]. < ref name= " Biewener " > {{cite book |title=Animal Locomotion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC |author=A.

 The study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely [[mathematical function]]s.  It is possible to represent [[rotation]] with elements of the [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]]. Other [[Non-Euclidean geometry#Planar algebras|planar algebras]] are used to represent the [[shear mapping]] of classical motion in [[absolute time and space]] and to represent the [[Lorentz transformation]]s of relativistic space and time.   Mathematicians have developed a science of [[Non-Euclidean geometry#Kinematic geometries|kinematic geometry]], which uses [[time]] as a parameter. 
 
 Certain  geometric transformations which are called  [[rigid transformation]]s have been developed to  describe the movement of components of a [[mechanical system]]. These transformations simplify the derivation of its equations of motion, and is central to [[Lagrangian mechanics|dynamic analysis]]. 
 
 [[robot kinematics|Kinematic analysis]] is the process of measuring the [[Physical quantity|kinematic quantities]] used to describe motion.  In engineering, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]], and, working in reverse, [[Burmester theory|kinematic synthesis]] designs a mechanism for a desired range of motion. < ref name=McCarthy2010 > J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C & dq=geometric+design+of+linkages & pg=PA231 ''Geometric Design of Linkages,''] Springer, New York. < /ref >   < !-- I am not sure that these are the best examples:  The movement of a crane and the oscillations of a piston in an engine are both simple kinematic systems. The crane is a type of open kinematic chain, while the piston is part of a closed [[four-bar linkage]].-- >  In addition, ''kinematics'' applies algebraic geometry to the study of the [[mechanical advantage]] of a [[mechanical system]], or [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]].
