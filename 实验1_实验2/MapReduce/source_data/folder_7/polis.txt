'''Polis''' means a [[city]], a [[city-state]] and also [[citizenship]] and body of citizens. In context with [[Ancient Greece]] ''polis'' means nearly always  " city-state. " 
 
 The word originates from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-state]]s, which developed during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period and existed well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, when the equivalent [[Latin]] word was ''civitas'', that means 'citizenhood' as well. 
 
 An ancient ''polis'' often centered around a [[citadel]], called the ''[[acropolis]]''. Nearly always it had an ''[[agora]]'' (market) and typically one or more temples and a ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]''.  Many citizens of a ''polis'' did not live in the central city but in the suburbs or countryside.  The Greeks regarded the ''polis'' as a religious and political association: while the ''polis'' would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the ''polis'' would not simply consist of a geographical area.
