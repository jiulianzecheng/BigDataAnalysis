 A '''pithos''' (several pithoi) is a large [[jar]] used for storage. It was common in the whole [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]]. It was used for storing things like [[wine]], [[vegetable oil]] or [[grain]]. Pithoi were common in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and on [[Crete]]. These jars were very big, they could reach the height of a man. As a consequence, creating them required special skill. Pithoi were similar to [[Amphora|amphoras]], but they were usually bigger, and had a flat bottom.  
 
 Pithoi were sometimes used for [[Burial|burials]], examples of these are the [[Argaric culture]], or the child-skeleton of Kritsa.
