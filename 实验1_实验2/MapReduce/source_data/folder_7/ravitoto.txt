 '''Ravitoto''' ({{IPA-mg|ravˈtutʷ|}}) is a traditional [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] food. In [[French language|French]], Ravitoto means “crushed [[cassava]] leaves”. These are specifically sweet cassava (cassava tree) leaves pounded with a mortar or meat grinder. It is cooked with [[garlic]] and very fatty [[pork]]. In other societies, [[coconut milk]] is used instead to cook cassava leaves, like mataba in the [[Comoros]]. You can add dried fish or small shrimp, called tsivaki.
