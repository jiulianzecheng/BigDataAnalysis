 The '''Cotswolds''' is a range of hills in central-southwest [[England]], sometimes called the  " Heart of England " , a hilly area reaching over 300 m. The area has been designated as [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The highest point in the Cotswolds is [[Cleeve Hill]] at 330 & nbsp;m (1083 & nbsp;ft). 
 
 The Cotswolds lie within the current [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of  [[Oxfordshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Warwickshire]], and [[Worcestershire]]. The county of Gloucestershire forms the largest area of the Cotswolds. 
 
 ==Description== 
 
 The [[spine]] of the Cotswolds runs southwest to northeast through six counties, particularly [[Gloucestershire]], [[Oxfordshire]], and southern [[Warwickshire]]. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep [[slope]]s down to the [[River Severn|Severn valley]] and the [[River Avon]], [[Warwickshire|Avon]]. These are a result of the broken edge of the limestone layer. On the eastern boundary is the city of [[Oxford]] and on the west is [[Stroud, England|Stroud]]. To the south towns as [[Cirencester]], [[Lechlade]], [[Tetbury]], [[Beverston]] and [[Fairford]] mark the southern limit of this region.  
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[wool]] trade made the Cotswolds prosperous. Some of this money was put into the building of [[church]]es. The area has a number of large, handsome Cotswold stone  " wool churches " .  The area is still wealthy and has attracted people who own second homes in the area, or have chosen to retire to the Cotswolds. 
 
 Typical Cotswold towns are [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Burford]], [[Chipping Norton]], [[Cirencester]], [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]] and [[Winchcombe]]. The town of [[Chipping Campden]] is famous as the home of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], that was founded by [[William Morris]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. 
 
 The [[Cotswold Way]] is a long-distance [[Trail|footpath]] about 103 & nbsp;miles long (166 & nbsp;km) running the length of the AONB, mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpement with good views over the [[Severn Valley]] and the [[Vale of Evesham]]. 
 
 === Cotswold stone === 
 The area has attractive small [[town]]s and [[village]]s built of  ''Cotswold stone'' (a yellow [[limestone]]). This limestone is rich in [[fossils]]. The stone  is a yellow [[ooid|oolitic]] [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]]. At the time, this was laid down in a warm tropical sea, about 177 million years ago. The latitude of [[Britain]] was about where [[North Africa]] is today. The stone is full of fossils such as stalked [[crinoid]]s. A project is under way to collect examples for the [[Natural History Museum]]. < ref > Tens of thousands of Jurassic fossils found at secret site.
