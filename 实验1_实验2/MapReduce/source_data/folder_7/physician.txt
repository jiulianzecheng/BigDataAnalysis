 A '''physician''' or '''medical doctor''' is a person who uses medicine to treat [[illness]] and [[Injury|injuries]] to improve a patient's health. 
 
 In most countries, the basic medical degree qualifies a person to treat patients and prescribe appropriate [[treatment]], including [[drugs]]. A [[physician]] may also do the simplest kinds of [[surgery]]. 
 
 == Training and qualifications == 
 Doctors are trained in [[medical school]]s which are usually part of a [[university]]. They hold a [[Academic degree|degree]] awarded by a medical school. Doctors work in [[hospital]]s, medical [[clinic]]s, from their own offices, or may even visit people in their homes. They may also work for schools, companies, sports teams, or the [[military]]. Medical doctors are often assisted in their work by [[nurse]]s. 
 
 The basic degree is awarded on the successful completion of medical school education and practice. It is given different names in different countries. It is [[M.D.]] (Doctor of Medicine) in the [[USA]], [[Scotland]] and some other countries. In England, different universities use different terms. The [[University of London]] qualification is M.B. Ch.B. (that is, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery). Most countries have higher qualifications, based on [[experience]], supervised work, more exams, and theses. Because of its history, in England a general practitioner eventually becomes an [[MRCP]] (member of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]), but a [[surgeon]] works towards becoming an [[MRCS]] (Member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]]). A similar system is used in [[Edinburgh]], [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. 
 
 == What they do == 
 Medical doctors treat patients by finding out what is wrong with them, known as a [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]]. They ask questions about the patient's [[symptoms]]. These might include [[fever]] or [[pain]]. They may ask about past illnesses or family members who have been sick. They will then examine the patient. They look at different parts of the body, listen to the [[heart]] and [[lungs]] with a [[stethoscope]]. Sometimes they may need to collect a sample of blood, use an [[x-ray]] machine, or use other tools. When they have gathered enough information, a doctor can make a diagnosis and then plan a [[treatment]]. Often they [[Prescription|prescribe]] [[drug]]s. 
 
 ==Specialists== 
 Some physicians only work on certain [[diseases]] or injuries, or may only work on one part of the human body. These doctors are called specialists. For example, there are doctors who specialize in [[diseases]] of the [[stomach]] or [[intestine]]s. Other medical doctors are  " general practitioners "  or  " family practitioners " . This means that they do a little bit of everything. The general practitioner the first doctor a patient will see, and this doctor may decide to send them to a specialist doctor if needed. 
 
 Some types of specialists are: 
 * [[Anesthesiologist]], a doctor who gives [[anaesthesia|anesthesia]] to patients 
 * [[Dentist]], also known in the US as a dental surgeon, is a surgeon who specializes in [[dentistry]]â€”the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the oral cavity. 
 * Ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating [[eye]]s 
 * Podiatrist, a doctor who specialises in treating [[feet]] 
 * [[Psychiatrist]], a doctor who specializes in [[psychiatry]], and treats people with [[mental illness]]. Psychiatrists can prescribe [[Psychiatry#Prescribing Psychiatric Medications|psychiatric medication]]. 
 * [[Surgeon]], a doctor who performs [[surgery]] 
 * [[Pediatrician]], a child specialist who also knew about everything such as elderly health, [[mental illness]], eye problems etc., 
 
 == Pay == 
 A qualified doctor has many opportunities to work in different countries, though they may need to pass more [[Examination|examinations]].  Many places rely on immigrants to keep their health services going.  In 2023 the highest pay for doctors was in [[Luxembourg]], where specialists could earn $352,300 and GPs $278,900 a year.  < ref > {{Cite web|last=Mortensen|first=Rebecca|date=2020-05-19|title=10 highest paying countries for doctors|url=https://medicfootprints.org/10-highest-paying-countries-for-doctors/|access-date=2023-07-24|website=Medic Footprints|language=en-GB}} < /ref >
