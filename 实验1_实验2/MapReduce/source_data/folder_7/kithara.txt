 The '''kithara''' or '''cithara''' ({{lang-el|κιθάρα|translit=kithāra}} {{lang-lat|cithara}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[musical instrument]]. It was a kind of [[lyre]] with seven strings. The lyre was used for teaching [[music]] to beginners, but the cithara was used by [[expert]] [[musician]]s called ''kitharodes''. The word  " [[guitar]] "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''kithara''. < ref > {{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|year=2001–2022|title=guitar|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=guitar}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 The cithara's origins are from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] lyres shaped like [[swan]]-[[neck]]s. < ref > {{harvnb|Vorreiter|1975|loc=p. 94:  " [T]he swan-neck lyres were the predecessors of the sacred ''kitharai'' of later times, i.e. the 6th to 3rd centuries B.C., in the Hellenic world. " }} < /ref >  Some [[scholars]] have connected the cithara with string instruments from ancient [[Anatolia]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Maas|Snyder|1989|p=185}}. < /ref > {{Sfn|West|1992}} 
 
 The lyre was used as a teaching tool in schools, but the cithara was an instrument needing a great amount of skill. < ref name=Aristotle > {{cite book|author=[[Aristotle]]|title=Politics|at=1341a}}: Aristotle calls the cithara an ''organon technikon''. < /ref >  The cithara was played mainly with [[dance]]s, [[epic]] recitations, rhapsodies, [[ode]]s, and lyric songs.{{Sfn|West|1992}} It was also played [[Solo (music)|solo]] at receptions, [[banquet]]s, national games, and trials of skill. [[Aristotle]] said that these stringed instruments were not for educational purposes but for pleasure only. < ref name=Aristotle/ >  It was played by strumming the strings with a stiff [[plectrum]] made of dried [[leather]], held in the right [[hand]] with the [[elbow]] outstretched and handpalm bent inwards.{{Sfn|West|1992}} 
 
 Most paintings on [[vase]]s show citharas with seven strings but sometimes a very skillful kitharode is shown playing a kithara with more than the traditional seven strings.{{Sfn|West|1992}} 
 
 ==Construction== 
 The cithara had a deep, [[wood]]en box made of two resonating tables, either flat or slightly arched, connected by ribs or sides of equal width. At the top, its strings were knotted around the crossbar or yoke (''zugon'') or to rings threaded over the bar, or wound around pegs. The other ends of the strings were secured to a tail-piece after passing over a flat bridge, or the tail-piece and bridge were combined.{{Sfn|West|1992}}{{Sfn|Maas|Snyder|1989}} 
 
 ==Greek mythology== 
 The cithara is said to have been invented by [[Apollo]], the god of music. < ref > {{cite book|author=Pausanias|author-link=Pausanias (geographer)|title=Description of Greece|at=5.14.8}} < /ref >  [[Apollo]] is often depicted playing a cithara instead of a lyre, often dressed in a kitharode’s formal [[robe]]s. ''Kitharoidos'', or ''Citharoedus'', is an epithet given to Apollo, which means  " lyre-singer "  or  " one who sings to the lyre " . 
 
 An ''Apollo Citharoedus'' or ''Apollo Citharede'', is the word for a kind of statue or other image of Apollo with a cithara. Among the best-known examples is the Apollo Citharoedus, a large 2nd-century CE [[marble]] statue made by an unknown Roman sculptor that is now located in the museums of the [[Vatican]].{{Sfn|West|1992}} 
 
 [[Sappho]] is closely connected to music including string instruments like the cithara and the barbitos. She was an important woman in Greek society and made popular songs that focused on [[emotion]]s. A story from [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] goes that she went up the slopes of [[Mount Parnassus]] where she was welcomed by the [[Muses]]. She wandered through the [[laurel]] grove and came upon the cave of [[Apollo]]. There, she bathed in the Castalian Spring and took [[Phoebus]]' (Apollo's) [[plectrum]] to play skillful music. The sacred [[nymphs]] danced while she stroked the strings with much talent to bring forth sweet [[Melody|melodies]] from the cithara.{{Sfn|Anderson|1994}}  
 
 ==Famous players== 
 According to the ''[[Suda]]'', Phrynis ({{lang-grc|Φρῦνις}}) of [[Lesbos]] was the first to play the cithara in [[Athens]] and won at the Panathenaea. < ref > [https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/sol/sol-entries/phi/761 Suda, phi.761] < /ref >
