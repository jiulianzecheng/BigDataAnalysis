 Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising, and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that  " tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste. " < ref name =  " mat " / > 
 
 As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising. 
 Very important was the growth of [[mass media]], with mass circulation illustrated newspapers in the later 19th century followed by [[movies]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. 
 
 ==Types of advertising== 
 Advertising happens in many different ways. Many products are advertised on [[television]], although not all channels permit advertising. The advertisements usually appear during breaks between a [[television show]]. They are usually for products, other television shows, or movies. These ads are not normally much longer than 30 seconds. Some [[radio station]]s have [[audio]] advertisements that play between programmes. 
 
 An advertisement for a [[movie]] is called a [[Trailer (movie)|trailer]]. It shows a short collection of clips from the movie, and shows the date it will be released in [[cinema]]s. 
 
 Advertising also takes place on [[website]]s. These may appear as  " banner ads "  or  " popups " . They are often non-moving [[image]]s or [[Macromedia Flash|flash]] [[animation]]s{{Update inline|date=February 2023}}. The owner of the website will get [[money]] when a user clicks on the advertisement. Sometimes they will get a [[percent]]age of the money if they buy a [[Product (consumer goods)|product]]. 
 
 [[Billboard]]s advertise products on highways and city streets. These may simply be freestanding billboards or may be part of street furniture such as a bus shelter.  Buses and taxis are often covered in adverts, while budget airlines sometimes allow advertising inside their planes. Adverts also appear in newspapers, magazines, and sports programmes. Many sport [[stadium]]s have adverts set around them. Sports teams, tournaments, television programmes and public events may have a [[sponsor]] who is the main or, sometimes, only advertiser. 
 
 Nowadays, [[Online advertising|online advertisement]] are increased rapidly. Compare to print media  &  other advertisement types, digital online advertisement is winner. This 2023 huge people join on social media and max advertising market are overflow. 
 
 ==Techniques== 
 Advertisers use many different techniques to get people to notice their adverts, often using shocking or sexy images on purpose. Once advertisers have managed to make people notice their advert, they need to 'sell' the product or brand. They may try to make the product look appealing, however, often, advertisers use humor in such a way that gets people to remember the brand without actually promoting the product. Poor adverts can damage sales or spoil a brand's identity. 
 
 ==Regulations== 
 Advertising is often strictly regulated, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]] it is illegal to advertise tobacco, except in the shop where it is sold and this is also restricted. In [[France]], it is illegal to advertise alcohol, meaning that when many European football teams play in France, they cannot play in their usual shirts as breweries often advertise on sports shirts. It is also illegal to advertise on some television channels, the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom and [[RTE]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are not allowed to permit advertising and instead make their revenue from selling a compulsory [[television licence]]. Some countries, such as [[Canada]], regulate misleading advertising and labelling to try to prevent deceptive practices and protect consumers. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/02776.html | title=Competition Bureau Canada - Home | date=25 April 2005 }} < /ref >
