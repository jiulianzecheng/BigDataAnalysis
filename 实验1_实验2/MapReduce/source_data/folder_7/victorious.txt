 '''''Victorious''''' (stylized as '''''VICTORiOUS''''') is an American [[Adolescence|teen]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] created by [[Dan Schneider]] that originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from March 27, 2010, to February 2, 2013. The show revolves around aspiring singer Tori Vega (portrayed by [[Victoria Justice]]), a [[teenager]] who attends a performing arts high school called Hollywood Arts High School, after taking her older sister Trina's ([[Daniella Monet]]) place in a showcase while getting into screwball situations on a daily basis. On her first day at Hollywood Arts, she meets Andre Harris ([[Leon Thomas III]]), Robbie Shapiro ([[Matt Bennett]]), Rex Powers (Robbie's puppet), Jade West ([[Elizabeth Gillies]]), Cat Valentine ([[Ariana Grande]]) and Beck Oliver ([[Avan Jogia]]).  
 
 == Plot == 
 The series follows Tori Vega, a teenage girl who is accepted into Hollywood Arts, a performing arts high school for talented teens. The show follows Tori and her friends as she finds her place within Hollywood Arts, completing school projects that usually involve musical and theatrical performances, and overcoming unusual and absurd challenges. Other students at Hollywood Arts (and the students who make up Tori's group of friends) include the musical prodigy Andre Harris, the socially awkward Robbie Shapiro and his ventriloquist dummy Rex, the sweet but dim-witted red-head Cat Valentine, the sarcastic and mean Jade West (who serves as Tori's frenemy), Jade's handsome down-to-earth [[boyfriend]] Beck Oliver, and Tori's untalented and self-absorbed older sister Trina. Other characters include Erwin Sikowitz, the performing-arts teacher for Hollywood Arts; Lane Alexander, the school's guidance counselor; and Sinjin Van Cleef, an odd and often unsettling classmate that handles audiovisual.

 == Characters == 
 * '''Tori Vega''' - The [[protagonist|main character]] of the series. She goes to school at Hollywood Arts, a high school for talented teens. She first discovered her talent after she takes her older sister Trina's place in a big showcase at the school. Tori's best friend is Andre Harris and her                 [[frenemy]] is Jade West.

 * '''Robbie Shapiro''' - A [[nerd]]y boy who carries a [[puppet]] named Rex Powers. 
 * '''Jade West''' - A [[Gothic fashion|Gothic]] girl who is Tori's frenemy. She is often the [[antagonist|villain]] of the series. Her boyfriend is Beck Oliver. 
 * '''Cat Valentine''' - A sweet and innocent girl who is also very [[naïve]]. Her hair is dyed the color red because it is the color of her favorite snack, a red velvet [[cupcake]]. When she feels offended, she will say  " What's that supposed to mean?! "  Andre [[nickname]]s her  " Little Red " , because she is little and has red hair. She is also the only character who is a good friend to Trina, because the other characters (especially Tori because they are sisters) usually get annoyed by Trina. 
 * '''Beck Oliver''' - Jade's boyfriend, who is well-liked by the other characters. He keeps things together in tough situations. 
 * '''Trina Vega''' - Tori's big sister, who was always the star of the Vega house. She acts like a [[diva]] as she believes that stardom is her [[fate]], but the truth is that she does not have much talent. Her attitude is that she is a [[celebrity]], but she really has the talent of a much lower grade. 
 * '''Rex Powers''' - Robbie's puppet. He is often [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]], unlike Robbie.
