 An inkanyamba is a kind of [[eel]] that is found in some [[legend]]s. The legends tell about a [[Big|gigantic]], winged [[eel]] with a big appetite that is associated with extreme storms. The Inkanyamba is also a legendary serpent said to be living in a waterfall lake in the northern forests near [[Pietermaritzburg]], most commonly in the base of [[Howick Falls]], South Africa. The Zulu people of the area believe it to be a large serpent with an equine head. It is a very tall creature. It is invisible, so no one has ever seen it. Inkanyamba in English means the deity of tornadoes, taking the form of a black snake.
