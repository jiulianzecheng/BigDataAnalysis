 A '''genus''' is a rank in the [[biological classification]] (or [[taxonomy]]). It is above [[species]], and below [[Family (biology)|families]]. A genus can include more than one species. When [[biologist]]s talk about a genus, they mean one or more [[species]] of [[animal]]s or [[plant]]s that are closely related to each other. 
 
 As with other [[taxon|taxa]], the [[plural]] is different from other English words because it is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word. 'Genus' is the [[singular]], and 'genera' is the [[plural]] form of the word. 
 
 When printing the scientific name of an [[organism]], the name is ''always in italic''. A name of species has two parts, with the genus first. For example, in  " ''[[Felis silvestris]]'' " , ''[[Felis]]'' is the genus. The genus name always begins with a capital letter. In  " ''[[Felis silvestris catus]]'' " , the third word is the [[subspecies]], which is not often used. 
 
 == As a common word == 
 In writing, genus names in Latin may be 'anglicised' to form a [[common name]]. For example, the genus ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' is  " pseudomonad "  (plural:  " pseudomonads " ). In practice, most really common animals and plants already have a common name. So instead of saying 'felids', or '[[feline]]s', one says 'cats' both for the family pet, and for all the cat family ([[Felidae]]).
