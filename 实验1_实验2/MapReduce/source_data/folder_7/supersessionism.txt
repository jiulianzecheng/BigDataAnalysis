'''Superssessionism''' is the idea that one [[religion]] was true but that it stopped being true after another [[religion]] showed up to supersede it. For example, [[Christianity]] believes that [[Judaism]] was true once but that because the [[Jews]] rejected [[Jesus]] they stopped being the Chosen People and that the [[New Testament]] and a faith-based [[religion]] replaced [[Jewish Law]].  [[Islam]] also believes that [[God]] gave the [[Torah]] (or something similar to it) to the [[Israelites]] at [[Mount Sinai]] but that the [[Quran]] ultimately replaced it.
