'''Hejaz''' is the western region of [[Saudi Arabia]], stretching along the [[Red Sea]] (Sea of Hejaz). It extends from [[Taif]] in the south to [[Jordan]] in the north. There are four important cities in this region: 
 
 * [[Jeddah]] is the largest city, in the middle of the Red Sea coast. Jeddah is the economic and tourism capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
 * [[Mecca]] is the holy city for [[Muslim]]s because of [[Masjid al-Haram|Al-Haram Mosque]] and [[Kaaba|Al-Kaaba]]. Muslims face this city when they [[Prayer|pray]], and millions go there every year for doing [[Hajj]], the Muslim [[pilgrimage]].  
 * [[Medina]] is the second most holy city, and was the first capital of Islam. This is where the Mosque Of Prophet [[Muhammad]] is and where the Prophet Muhammad lived. There are many monuments and historical places. 
 * [[Taif]] is the youngest city. Taif is a tourist city in Saudi Arabia due to the cooler climate compared with the other cities. Hejaz has spiritual, cultural, economic and tourist importance.
