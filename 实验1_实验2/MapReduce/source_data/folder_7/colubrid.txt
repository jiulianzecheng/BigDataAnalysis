 A '''colubrid''' (from Latin ''coluber'', snake) is a [[snake]] that is a member of the '''Colubridae''' [[family (biology)|family]]. Colubridae is the largest snake family, and includes about two-thirds of all known living snake [[species]]. However, colubrids are ''certainly not a [[Monophyly|natural group]]'', and many are more closely related to other groups, such as [[elapid]] < nowiki/ > s, than to each other. This family has classically been a [[wastebasket taxon|dumping ground]] for snakes that do not fit anywhere else. There is on-going [[mitochondrial DNA]] research which will sort out the familial relations within this group. < ref > Lawson R. ''et al'' 2005.

 A colubrid's body is almost completely covered in scales. Most colubrids are not venomous and are normally harmless. A few groups, such as genus ''[[Boiga]]'', can produce medically significant bites. In addition, the [[Boomslang]] and [[African twig snake]] have both caused human fatalities. The venom-injecting fangs associated with venomous colubrids are almost always in the back of the mouth, in contrast to [[Viperidae|vipers]] and [[elapid]]s.
