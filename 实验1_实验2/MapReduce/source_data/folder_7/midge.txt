 '''Midge''' is a common term for many types of small [[fly]]. They are all in a [[suborder]], the [[Nematocera]]. 
 
 They are found on practically every land area except permanently dry [[deserts]] and the frozen zones. Some midges, such as many [[Phlebotominae]] ([[sand fly]]) and [[Simuliidae]] (black fly), are [[vector (biology)|vectors]] of various [[diseases]]. Others are prey items for [[insectivore]]s, such as various [[frogs]] and [[Hirundinidae|swallows]]. 
 
 The [[highland]] midge of [[Scotland]] (''Culicoides impunctatus'') is present in huge numbers. It is a significant blood-sucking pest. It is found in upland and lowland areas ([[fens]], [[bogs]] and [[marsh]]es) especially in the north west of Scotland from late spring to late summer. < ref > Hendry, George. 2003.

 The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family midges commonly have similar ecological roles. Examples of families which include midges are: < ref > Merritt R.W.  &  Cummins K.W. (eds) 1996. ''An introduction to the aquatic insects of North America''. Kendall/Hunt Publishing. < /ref >
