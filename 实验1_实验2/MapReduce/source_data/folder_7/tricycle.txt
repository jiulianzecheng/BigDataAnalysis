 A '''tricycle''' is a vehicle with three wheels. It can be also called a '''trike'''. Tricycles can have pedals, an [[electric motor]] or a [[petrol engine]]. 
 
 == Human powered == 
 A child's tricycle is best known, but adult tricycles are becoming more common.  The adult trikes will have a chain, gears and are recumbent (the feet are in front of the body).  They come in two main styles: '''tadpole''' with two wheels up front and one in back and '''delta''' with two wheels in the back and one wheel in the front. < ref > {{cite web|title=Tadpole or Delta|url=http://www.jetrike.com/tadpole-or-delta.html|publisher=Jetrike|accessdate=5 January 2017}} < /ref >   Almost always the front wheel or wheels steer the bike, and power goes to the back wheel or wheels.

 Some trikes are ''fully faired'' (covered in a shell to cut wind resistance).  These are called '''velomobiles'''.

 Other trikes are built to carry [[cargo]] or passengers (also called a ''cycle [[rickshaw]]'' or ''pedicabs''). 
 
 == Motor driven == 
 [[Motorcycle]]s also come in three wheeled versions.  Some people like them for better balance or more room. < ref > {{cite web|title=Why bikers make the switch|url=http://www.buffalochip.com/NEWS-INFO/News/Sturgis-Rider-News-Blog/ArtMID/2002/ArticleID/373/Why-Bikers-Make-the-Switch-%E2%80%93-8-Triker-Love-Stories|publisher=Buffalo Chips (Sturgis)|accessdate=5 January 2017}} < /ref >
