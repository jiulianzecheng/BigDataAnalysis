 In [[Networking technology|computer networking]], mainly [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), '''netsplit''' is the event when two servers disconnect. Because how IRC networks are built, a disconnection between two servers splits the entire network into two parts. This makes it look like people on the other half of the network have quit from IRC.

 ==Appearance of netsplits== 
 Below is an example of typical netsplit. When two servers split, a user sees this as large number of users quitting. After the servers are reconnected, a user sees the other users rejoining.
