 '''Freegle''' is an [[organisation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that help people give away things they do not need anymore to other people for free, if someone will collect and take the item away. This means that used items are not thrown away while they are still useful to someone. This is to make sure that less [[garbage]] is thrown into [[landfill]]s, so that these landfills can have more space and last longer. 
 
 In October 2009, there were more than 200 Freegle groups with more than 920,000 members in the UK. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.ilovefreegle.org/groups/|title=Freegle|website=www.ilovefreegle.org|access-date=2019-02-13|archive-date=2018-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222221426/https://www.ilovefreegle.org/groups/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
