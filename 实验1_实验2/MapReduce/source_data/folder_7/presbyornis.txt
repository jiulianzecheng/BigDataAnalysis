 '''''Presbyornis''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of water bird. It was a wading bird, often walking in shallow water on its long legs. 
 
 ''Presbyornis'' was one of the first [[Anseriformes|anseriforms]]. Because of its long legs and neck, it was initially mistaken for a [[flamingo]]. Later it was reclassified as an anseriform when the [[duck]]-like anatomy of its [[skull]] and [[beak|bill]] was found. It is from an extinct group closely related to [[Anatidae|ducks and geese]]. Judging from numerous [[fossil]] findings, ''Presbyornis'' probably lived in colonies around shallow [[lakes]]. Its broad, flat bill was used to filter food (small plants and animals) from the water, in the manner of today's [[dabbling duck]]s. < ref > Palmer D. (ed) 1999.
