 '''Tetrapods''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''tetrapoda'' = four feet) are [[vertebrate]] [[tetrapodomorph|four-legged]] land [[animal]]s. This kind of [[locomotion]] is called [[quadrupedal]].  
 
 [[Amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[dinosaur]]s (including their direct descendants, the [[bird]]s), and [[mammal]]s are all tetrapods. Even though [[snake]]s do not have limbs, they are tetrapods because they [[evolution|evolved]] from animals with four limbs. 
 
 The earliest tetrapods evolved from the [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish) into [[air]]-breathing amphibians, perhaps in the Upper [[Devonian]] period. < ref name= " Jenny " > [[Jennifer Clack|Clack, Jennifer]] 2012. ''Gaining ground: the origin and early evolution of tetrapods''. 2nd ed, Bloominton, Indiana: Indiana Umiversity Press, 127, 143 et seq. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35675-8}}, ({{Google books|6Ztrhm8uLQ0C }}) < /ref >  This means the transition took place in fish, before the land was the main habitat. This is typical of [[transitional fossil]]s undergoing [[mosaic evolution]]. 
 
 ==Evolution== 
 === Fishapods === 
 Clear fossil tetrapod [[Animal tracks|tracks]] from the mid-[[Devonian]] predate previous tetrapod records by 18 million years. < ref > Janvier, Phillipe and Clément, Gaël 2010. Muddy tetrapod origins. ''Nature'' '''463''', p40/41. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7277/full/463040a.html] < /ref >  These tracks are from the Middle Devonian of [[Poland]], nearly 400 million years ago. The footprints were made in the mud of a [[tropical]] [[lagoon]], and no animal of that time could have made the tracks except a tetrapod. The find strongly suggests that the animals were [[fish]], not [[amphibia]], when the transition to [[limb]]s occurred. The term '''fishapod''' is sometimes used. They would have been derived from lobe-finned fish ([[Sarcopterygii]]), but of a [[genus]] whose body fossil has not yet been found. The Polish team suggest the fish to tetrapod transition might have taken place as early as the Lower Devonian. < ref > Niedzwiedzki G. Szrek P. Narkiewitcz K  &  M and Ahlberg P.E. 2010. ''Nature'' '''463''', p43/48. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7277/full/nature08623.html] < /ref > 
 
 The earliest tetrapods lived entirely in [[water]]. < ref name=Jenny/ >  They could not live on land. Earlier, it was believed that fish had first moved onto land – either looking for [[food]] (like modern [[mudskipper]]s) or to find water when the [[pond]] they lived in dried out. It was believed that they later evolved legs, lungs, and other body parts to live better on land. 
 
 Nine [[genera]] of Devonian tetrapods have been described. These earliest tetrapods were not terrestrial. They lived in swampy habitats like shallow [[wetland]]s, [[coast]]al [[lagoon]]s, brackish [[river delta]]s, and even shallow [[Ocean|marine]] [[sediment]]s. There is much to suggest that these are the kind of [[environment]]s in which the tetrapods evolved. Also, because fossils of early tetrapods are found widely in the [[Old Red Sandstone]] continent, < ref > formed by the joining of North America and northwestern Europe < /ref >  they must have spread by following the coastal lines. This means they could not have lived only in freshwater. 
 
 Still, they may have spent brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw their way through the mud. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are known from the early [[Carboniferous]] deposits, some 20 million years later. 
 
 Tetrapods adapted to terrestrial environments over time and spent longer periods away from the water. They also spent more of their juvenile stage on land before returning to the water for the rest of their life. It is also possible that the adults started to spend some time on land  to bask in the sunlight, close to the water's edge. The first true tetrapods that were adapted to moving on land were small. Only later did they increase in size. 
 
 === Romer's gap === 
 Between the lobe-finned fish tetrapods and the first [[amphibia]] and [[amniote]]s in the Middle [[Carboniferous]] lies a gap of 30 million years, with few satisfactory tetrapod fossils. This, noted in the early 1950s by Alfred Romer, is Romer's gap. < ref > Romer A.S. 1949. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' Saunders, Philadelphia. 2nd ed. 1955; 3rd ed. 1962; 4th ed. 1970 < /ref >  Some new fossils were found in the 1990s, such as ''[[Pederpes]]'', right in the middle of the Romer Gap. The gap still hides details of the transition from fish to tetrapod, but not so much as before. 
 
 So far, only two fossil sites from the Tournasian (earliest [[Carboniferous]]) are known. One is Horton Bluff Formation at Blue Beach, [[Nova Scotia]]. < ref > Carroll R.L. ''et al'' 1972. Excursion A59, Vertebrate palaeontology of Eastern Canada. In 24th Int. Geol. Congr. 1–113. < /ref > < ref > Clack J.A.  &  Carroll R.L. 2000. in (eds) Heatwole H.  &  Carroll R.L. ''Amphibian Biology'', vol 4, 1030–1043. Surrey Beatty. < /ref >  Much of this material has not yet been scientifically described. 
 
 The only other place a Tournasian tetrapod was found is near [[Dumbarton]] in the [[West of Scotland]]. The articulated (connected) skeleton of ''[[Pederpes]]'' was found there. < ref > Clack J.A. 2002. An early tetrapod from ‘Romer’s Gap’. ''Nature'' '''418''', 72–76. < /ref > < ref > Clack J.A.  &  Finney S.M. 2005. ''Pederpes finneyae'', an articulated tetrapod from the Tournaisian of western Scotland. ''J. Syst. Palaeontol''. '''2''', 311–346. < /ref >  Now comes news of new finds from this formation in five places in the [[Scottish Borders]]. < ref name=five > Clack J.A. ''et al'' 2016. Phylogenetic and environmental context of a Tournaisian tetrapod fauna. ''Nature Ecology  &  Evolution'' '''1'''. [http://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0002] < /ref >  The paper describes  five new Tournaisian tetrapods, with information about their habitat. < ref > Briggs, Helen 2016. Scottish fossils tell story of life on land. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38186397] < /ref >   
 : " Our analysis shows that the Tournaisian included a rich and diverse assemblage of [[taxa]], which included close relatives of some Devonian forms on the tetrapod stem and [[basal]] members of the [[amphibian]] stem " . < ref name=five/ > 
 
 The authors say  
 : " Although an [[extinction event]] at the end of the Devonian saw the demise of many archaic fish groups, < ref > Sallan L.C.  &  Coates M.I. 2010. End-Devonian extinction and a bottleneck in the early evolution of modern jawed vertebrates. ''Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA'' '''107''', 10131–10135. < /ref >  our studies provide new perspectives on the recovery and diversification of surviving groups that went on to found the basis of modern vertebrate diversity " . 
 
 Apparently, the split between the [[amphibians]] and the [[amniotes]] came soon after the extinction event as the tetrapods began to recover.  " This accords with most molecular dates for the split, which place it at an average of 355  my ago, a date only 4 myr after the end-Devonian " . < ref > Hedges S.B. ''et al'' 2015. Tree of Life reveals clock-like speciation and diversification. ''Mol. Biol. Evol''. '''32''', 835–845. < /ref > 
 
 === The cleidoic egg === 
 Whereas amphibia lay their eggs in water, all other tetrapods (the [[amniote]]s) lay [[cleidoic egg]]s. These eggs are like private little ponds, protecting and nourishing the embryo until it grows into a hatchling. This was a key evolutionary 'invention', which allowed the amniotes to invade the land. Once the amniotes were truly land animals, there followed a huge [[adaptive radiation]]. This was one of the most significant advances in vertebrate evolution. 
 
 === Stem tetrapods === 
 Stem tetrapods are difficult to classify because they lack some or all of the key characteristics of the standard groups. 
 *Land-dwelling stem tetrapods 
 Descendants of fishapods which at first lived an amphibious life-style. The amniotes and later amphibia are their descendants. Features: able to support their body on land for long periods; had five fingers and toes (pentadactyl limb) in contrast to their fishapod ancestors. Have not yet developed the characteristic features of the main tetrapod groups. 
 *Stem tetrapods evolved into: 
 **[[Amphibia]]  >  present-day [[Lissamphibia]] 
 **[[Amniota]] 
 ***[[Sauropsida]]  >  present-day reptiles and birds 
 ***[[Synapsida]]  >  present-day mammals 
 
 === Early fossils of stem tetraopds === 
 * ''[[Pederpes]]'', an early [[Mississippian]] tetrapod, 359–345 million years ago (mya). 
 * ''[[Westlothiana]]'', from 350mya, either an early [[amniote]] or a sister group to the amniotes 
 * ''[[Casineria]]'', from 340 mya, a basal [[amniote]]. 
 * ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]'', from the middle [[Pennsylvanian]], 314 mya, probable earliest [[synapsid]] 
 * ''[[Hylonomus]]'', from 312 mya, early [[anapsid]] [[sauropsid]] 
 * ''[[Paleothyris]]'', 312–304 mya, another early [[anapsid]] [[sauropsid]] 
 * ''[[Archaeothyris]]'', from 306 mya, an early [[synapsid]] 
 * ''[[Petrolacosaurus]]'', from 302 mya, the first [[diapsid]] [[sauropsid]] 
 
 == The tetrapod clade == 
 The tetrapod [[clade]] separated from fish in the [[Devonian]]. The amniotes were the earliest to lay cleidoic eggs. The Synapsids ( >  mammals) and the Sauropsids ( >  reptiles) are sister clades, and in particular, reptiles did ''not'' give rise to mammals.

 === Living tetrapods === 
 [[File:MetoposaurusDorsal.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Flat skull of a typical early amphibian, ''Metopsaurus''.]] 
 There are three main groups of living ( " [[crown group]] " ) tetrapods. Each group also includes many [[extinct]] groups: 
 
 ;[[Amphibian|Amphibia]] : [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[salamander|newts and salamanders]], and [[caecilian]]s 
 ;[[Sauropsida]] : [[bird]]s and modern [[reptile]]s 
 ;[[Synapsida]] : [[mammal]]s 
 
 [[Snake]]s and other legless reptiles are tetrapods because they are evolved from [[ancestor]]s who had four limbs. This is also true for [[caecilian]]s and [[aquatic]] mammals.
