 '''Thales of Miletus''', < ref > {{Polytonic|Θαλῆς ὁ Μιλήσιος}}  ({{pronEng|ˈθeɪliːz}}: the '''a''' is a long '''a''' as in 'base'; the '''e''' as in 'eez' < /ref >  about 624 [[BC]] – 546 BC, < ref > exact dates unknown < /ref >  was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]]. He was from [[Miletus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Many, notably [[Aristotle]], regard him as the first philosopher in the [[Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]]. < ref > [[Aristotle]] ''Metaphysics''.

 According to [[Bertrand Russell]],  " Western philosophy begins with Thales " . < ref > {{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1945 |title=The history of western philosophy |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwestern00russ |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn= }} < /ref >   Thales attempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to [[mythology]] and was tremendously influential in this respect. Almost all of the other pre-Socratic philosophers follow him in attempting to provide an [[explanation]] of ultimate substance, change, and the existence of the world—without reference to mythology. Those philosophers were also influential, and eventually Thales' rejection of mythological explanations became an essential idea for [[science]].  He was also the first to define general principles and set forth [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]. As a result he has been called the  " Father of Science " , though maybe [[Democritus]] is more deserving of this title. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Singer |first=C. |title=A short history of science to the 19th century |location= |publisher=Streeter Press |year=2008 |page=35 |isbn= }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book |last=Needham |first=C.

 In mathematics, Thales used [[geometry]] to solve problems such as calculating the height of [[pyramid]]s and the [[distance]] of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Also, Thales was the first person known to have studied electricity. < ref > {{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc= " Ionia and the Pythagoreans "  p. 43}} < /ref >
