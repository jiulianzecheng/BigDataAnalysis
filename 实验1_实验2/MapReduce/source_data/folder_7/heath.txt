 A '''heath''' or '''heathland''' is a [[shrubland]] [[habitat]] found mainly on low quality, [[acid]]ic soils. It has open, low growing woody [[vegetation]].  
 
 There are some clear differences between ''heath'' and ''[[moorland]]''.  For example ''moorland'' has a very peaty topsoil, and it is also free-draining, whereas a heath is not.  Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths < ref > {{cite book|last= Polunin, Oleg  &  Walters, Martin 1985 |title= A guide to the vegetation of Britain and Europe |year= 1985 |url= https://archive.org/details/guidetovegetatio0000polu |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 0-19-217713-3|page= [https://archive.org/details/guidetovegetatio0000polu/page/220 220]}} < /ref >  with & nbsp;— especially in Great Britain & nbsp;— a cooler and damper [[climate]]. 
 
 Heathland is common worldwide. They form extensive and diverse communities across [[Australia]] in [[humid]] and sub-humid areas. Fire regimes with burning maintain the heathlands. < ref > Spech R.L. 1988. Heathlands. In ''Australian vegetation'' R.H. Groves (ed) Cambridge University Press. < /ref >  Even more diverse though less widespread heath occurs in Southern Africa. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the [[California]] [[chaparral]], [[New Caledonia]], central [[Chile]] and along the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is also found in scattered locations across all continents except [[Antarctica]].
