 '''Cormorants''' are a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[bird|seabirds]]. There are about 40 different [[species]] of Cormorants. In some areas, they are also known as '''shags'''. 
 
 == Description == 
 Cormorants range in size from as little as 45 [[centimetre|cm]] (18 [[inch|in]]) and 340 [[gram|g]] (12 [[ounce|oz]]) to a maximum size 100 cm (40 in) and 5 kg (11 lbs). Most cormorants, including nearly all [[northern hemisphere]] species, have mainly dark [[feather]]s. Some [[southern hemisphere]] species are black and white. A few species are very [[color]]ful. Many species have areas of colored skin on the face. These areas can be bright blue, orange, red or yellow. They usually become more brightly colored in the [[breed]]ing season. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. 
 Cormorants can dive for 4 minutes looking for food. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Cormorants breed on rocky [[headland]]s and [[islands]] as well as near [[inland]] [[lake]]s, [[marsh]]es and reservoirs. The [[birds]] spend the [[winter]] on [[coast]]s, [[Estuary|estuaries]], [[river]]s, [[lakes]] and [[reservoirs]].
