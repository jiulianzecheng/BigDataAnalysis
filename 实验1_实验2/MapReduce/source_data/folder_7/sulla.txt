 '''Lucius Cornelius Sulla'''  < ref > L•CORNELIVS•L•F•P•N•SVLLA•FELIX is his name in [[Latin]]; In English, it means  " Lucius Cornelius Sulla, son of Lucius, grandson of Publius, the [[luck]]y " . < /ref >  (c. 138 BC – 78 BC), usually called '''Sulla''', was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[General officer|general]] and [[statesman]]. He was a ''praetor'' (a commander o an [[army]]) in 97 BC, < ref > Keaveney, Arthur 2005. ''Sulla: The last republican''. 2nd ed, London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-33660-4}}. < /ref >  and held the office of [[Roman Consul|Consul]] twice. He was the only man in history to have attacked and kept both [[Athens]] and [[Rome]]. 
 
 Sulla unconstitutionally marched his armies into Rome and defeated his enemy [[Gaius Marius]] in battle. After his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator. Sulla was made [[Roman dictator|Dictator]] in 81 or 82 BC. He had the Senate draw up a list of those he considered ''enemies of the state'' and published the list in the [[Roman Forum]]. [[Plutarch]] states in his ''Life of Sulla'' (XXXI):  " Sulla now began to make blood flow, and he filled the city with deaths without number or limit " . < ref > [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sulla*.html Plutarch • Life of Sulla " . penelope.uchicago.edu] < /ref > 
 
 This was remembered when [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] became Dictator.
