 Hariyali Teej (Green Teej) is celebrated on the third day after the new moon in the month of Sravan (in Hindu calendar). Since the month of Shravan means rainy season and around this time it becomes green, so Shravan Teej is also called Hariyali Teej. 
 
 The Hariyali Tij festival is also celebrated to commemorate the reunion of Shiva and Parvati. In this day Shiva adopted Parvati as his wife. Parvati fasted and practiced severe austerities for many years. At the 108th rebirth of Parvati, Shiva took her as his wife. Parvati is also known as Teej Mata (Teej Mother). < ref > Art Culture and Heritage of Rajasthan Study Material With MCQ: Useful for RPSC RAS Prelims and Other Exams. (n.d.). (n.p.): New Era Publication. < /ref > 
 
 Hartalika teej is observed in all parts of Nepal and in most parts of northern India (Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Rajasthan). 
 The festival celebrates the generosity of nature, the arrival of clouds and rain, green nature and birds and with it social activities, rituals and customs. The women's festivals include dancing, singing, gathering with friends and telling stories, designing henna on the hands and feet, wearing red, green or orange, sharing festive food, and playing under the green rocking trees. The monsoon festival of Rajasthan is dedicated to Parvati.
