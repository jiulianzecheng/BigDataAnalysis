 The '''ragdoll''' is a [[cat]] [[breed]]. It is large, with blue [[eye]]s, and a semi-longhair soft and silky coat of [[fur]]. It is usually mostly white, with light to dark marks.  
 
 The ragdoll was first bred by an American breeder named Ann Baker from a [[Persian (cat)|Persian]]-like cat (without a pedigree) and a Birman cat with the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] colorpoint gene. It is similar in appearance to the [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan]], which was bred directly from the Persian and Siamese.  
 
 The Ragdoll is gentle, easy going, and affectionate. The breed was named  " Ragdoll "  because they often go limp and relax like a rag or [[cloth]] [[doll]] when it is picked up.
