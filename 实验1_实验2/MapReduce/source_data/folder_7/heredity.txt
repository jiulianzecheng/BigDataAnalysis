 '''Heredity''' is the passing of [[Trait (biology)|traits]] (characteristics) from parents to offspring. In [[biology]], the study of heredity is called [[genetics]]. With most living things, heredity is analysed by [[breeding]] (making crosses), often in a [[laboratory]]. But with [[humans]], heredity is studied in other ways. [[Family]] [[pedigree]]s, [[identical twins]] and [[DNA]] [[genome]] analysis all provide clues. < ref > Sesardi, Neven 2005. ''Making sense of heritability''. Cambridge University Press. < /ref > 
 
 A trait which may be inherited is '''heritable'''; it is '''inborn''' or '''innate'''.
