 A '''schnitzel''' is a traditional German and [[Austria|Austrian]] dish.  It is made out of boneless meat thinned with a hammer, coated in [[bread crumb]]s and fried. It is a popular part of Austrian cuisine. In Austria, the dish called ''Wiener Schnitzel'' is traditionally served with a slice of lemon and either [[Potato salad]] or potatoes with [[parsley]] and [[butter]].   
 
 The traditional Wiener schnitzel is made of [[veal]].  It is now often made of [[pork]]. When made of [[pork]], it is often called ''Schnitzel Wiener Art'' in [[Germany]].  In Austria, by law it has to be called ''Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein'' to show it is different it from the original. In Austria and Germany, the term ''Wiener Schnitzel'' is protected by law.  Any schnitzel called by that name has to be made from veal. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/wienerschnitzel |title=Wiener Schnitzel |access-date=2012-05-07 |archive-date=2012-02-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225054454/http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/wienerschnitzel |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
