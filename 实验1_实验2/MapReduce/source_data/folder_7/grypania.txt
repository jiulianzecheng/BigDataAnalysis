 '''''Grypania''''' is an early, tube-shaped [[fossil]] from the [[Proterozoic]] [[eon]]. It is regarded by some as the first known [[eukaryote]]. < ref name= " Han " > Han T.M.  &  Runnegar B. 1992. Megascopic eukaryotic algae from the 2.1-billion-year-old negaunee iron-formation, Michigan. ''Science'' '''257''' (5067): 232–235.

 ''Grypania'''s status as a eukaryote is not absolutely proven. It might have been a giant [[bacterium]] or bacterial colony. Its size (over one centimeter) and consistent form, suggest it is a [[eukaryotic]] [[alga]]. < ref name=Han/ >  The oldest known ''Grypania'' fossils come from an iron mine near Negaunee, [[Michigan]]. The fossils were originally dated as 2100 [[million]] years ago, but later research showed the date as about 1874 [[million]] years ago. < ref > Schneider D.A. ''et al'' 2006.

''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences''  '''43''', 571-591, [http://cjes.geoscienceworld.org/content/39/6/999.abstract] < /ref >  ''Grypania'' lasted into the [[Mesoproterozoic]] era.
