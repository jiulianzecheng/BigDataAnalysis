 '''''Mestizo''''' (meh-STEE-tzo) is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for a person who is of mixed [[Europe|European]] (usually [[Spanish people|Spanish]]) and [[Amerindian]] [[ancestry]]. 
 
 Mestizos have existed since the time when [[Spain]] controlled much of what is now [[Latin America]]. A mestizo was usually the son of a Spanish father and a Native American mother. Mestizos form the largest part of the [[population]] in some Latin American nations, a large minority of mestizos makes up most of the population in [[Mexico]], which is the Spanish-speaking nation with the largest population in the world. 
 
 During the colonial era, many Native Americans were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and began using the Spanish language instead of their traditional one. This was because of the [[concept]] that existed in the Spanish colonies which gave more  " [[value]] "  to European people over Native Americans and [[African]]s. Because of this, many Native Americans gained better [[social status]] by calling themselves  " mestizos "  instead of  " indios. "
