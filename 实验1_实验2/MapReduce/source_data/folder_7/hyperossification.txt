'''Hyperossification''' is when there is much more [[bone]] material on a bone than usual.  Hyperossification is found in [[frogs]].  Many frogs have smooth skulls, but some frogs have skulls that only look smooth from the outside.  Under their skins, their skulls have spikes, ridges, flanges, or unusual neck joints. < ref name= " Evans " > {{cite journal|title  = New Material of Beelzebufo, a Hyperossified Frog (Amphibia: Anura) from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar

 Even frogs that did not come from the same ancestor evolved big, spiky skulls if they ate the same other animals: usually animals almost as big as they were, like birds and mice.  Scientists say this is because big, strong skulls let the frogs have big mouths and strong jaws that are good for catching big prey. < ref name= " FMNF "  / > 
 Other frogs have spikes inside their skin to protect from predators.  When a bigger animal bumps into the frog's head, the spikes break open sacs full of venom under the frog's skin, and this protects the frog from being eaten. < ref name= " FMNF " > {{cite news|url    = https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/fmon-sgw032020.php
