The '''Graeae''', sometimes called the '''Grey Sisters''', are characters from [[Greek mythology]]. They are a trio of [[hag]]s, called Deino, Enyo and Pemphredo.  They are called the Grey Sisters because they were born with grey skin and hair. They also share one [[tooth]] and one [[eye]]. They take turns using the tooth and eye. The Graeae are affiliated with the [[gorgon|gorgons.]] The hero [[Perseus]] made them say where [[Medusa]] was by taking their eye. Perseus said he would not give the eye back until the Grey Sisters told him where Medusa was.
