 A '''sneeze''' is a reaction in the body that suddenly presses air out of [[lungs]] so it flows quickly out through the mouth and [[nose]]. [[Air]] and [[mucus]] (the liquid found in the nose) are forced out quickly. Sneezing often happens after breathing [[dust]] or other small things that irritate the [[membrane]]s in the nose. The function of sneezing is to clean the space in the nose by removing the mucus and irritating things. Sneezing is mostly involuntary, which means that it happens without trying. 
 
 A sneeze consists of a deep inward breath that fills the lungs, a closing or partial closing of the throat, and a sudden increase in pressure in the lungs that forces air out. This increase in pressure is a result of muscles near the lungs that contract (tighten and shorten). Sneezing never happens during sleep because [[reflex]] signals do not pass to the part of the brain that causes muscles to move. When people sneeze, their [[eye]]s close. The speed of the air from sneezing is about 150 kilometers per hour or more. < ref > {{cite web |ref=HowFast |title= " How Fast Is a Sneeze Versus a Cough? Cover Your Mouth Either Way!

 When a person sneezes, many small drops of [[saliva]] and mucus blow out from the nose and mouth. These tiny drops often contain [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]]. Some of these are [[pathogens|germs]], which can make other people sick. To keep this from happening as much, is important to block the sneezed air with something like cloth or tissue to catch the drops. It also helps to move away from other people, go outside, or face away. 
 
 A common thing to say to people when they sneeze is  " Bless you! " , or sometimes in the [[United States]] sometimes  " Gesundheit! "  (from [[German language|German]], meaning  " Good [[health]] " ). There is a story that the blessing started with [[Pope Gregory VII]] (540â€“604 & nbsp;AD). He said a blessing might stop people from getting the [[bubonic plague]] which was killing people in [[Rome]] at the time. < ref name= " Siy " > {{cite book |last=Siy |first=Alexandra |author2=Kunkel, Dennis |title=Sneeze! |publisher= Charlesbridge |location=Watertown, MA|date=2007|page=40|isbn= 9781570916533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPgGBoqt9MUC & dq=pope+gregory%2Bsneeze & pg=PA40|accessdate=May 8, 2010|language=English}} < /ref >  There is a myth that when you sneeze your [[heart]] and all internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] stop functioning. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/3673/20120815/heart-stop-when-sneeze.htm|title=Does Your Heart Stop When You Sneeze|publisher=International Science Times.com|author=Feldman, Judy|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=August 15, 2012|archive-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005231443/http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/3673/20120815/heart-stop-when-sneeze.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The sound of a sneeze is written  " achoo! "  in English. Other languages write it differently. For example, in Swedish it is  " atjoo! " , in French it is  " atchoum! "  and in German it is  " Hatschi! " . 
 
 Some involuntary ways that people move air in or out of the lungs are: to sneeze, [[laugh]], [[cough]], [[hiccups|hiccup]], or [[yawn]].
