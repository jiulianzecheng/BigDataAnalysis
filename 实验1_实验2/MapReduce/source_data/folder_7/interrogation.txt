'''Interrogation''' (also called '''questioning''') generally means formally or informally [[interview]]ing a person to gain needed information of some kind. < ref name= " ChgMind " > {{cite web|title=Interrogation Is...|url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/interrogation/interrogation_is.htm|access-date=11 February 2016|publisher=Changing Minds}} < /ref >  Interrogations are used by [[military]] organizations, [[intelligence agencies]] and [[police|law enforcement agencies]] [[worldwide]]. < ref name= " Skerker163 " > Michael Skerker, ''An Ethics of Interrogation'' (Chicago; London: University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 163 < /ref >  Sometimes the interrogated person is suspected of committing a [[crime]] or thought to have a reason to hide the information. The questioner in criminal and military interrogations is often an officer trained in different interrogation techniques. < ref name=ChgMind/ >  Depending on how they view the person being questioned or the purpose of the interrogation, the methods used may vary widely. < ref name=ChgMind/ >  For example: 
 *The person being questioned may be a [[witness]] and may give [[information]] freely. < ref name=SwansonMH > {{cite web |url=http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072564938/student_view0/chapter4/chapter_outline.html |title=Interviewing and Interrogation |author=Charles R.

 *The person being interrogated may be [[suspect|suspected]] of a [[crime]] and the [[wikt:goal|goal]] is a [[wikt:confession|confession]]. < ref name=SwansonMH/ > 
 *The person being questioned is not a suspect, but may not want to give any information. < ref name=SwansonMH/ > 
 
 == Interrogation questions == 
 An interrogation may often begin with several [[closed-ended question]]s. Examples would be  " are you comfortable "  or  " would you like a cigarette " ? < ref name=IntQuestCM > {{cite web |url=http://changingminds.org/techniques/interrogation/interogation_questions.htm |title=Interrogation Questions |publisher=Changing Minds |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >  The intent is for the interviewer to control the conversation and put the person being interrogated at ease. < ref name=IntQuestCM/ >  Let them think they are not in any trouble. < ref name=IntQuestCM/ > 
 
 Next may follow asking [[narrative]] questions to find out what the person knows about a subject. Next, the interrogator may ask [[direct question]]s. Throughout the interview interrogators may ask  " cross-questions " . These are the same question asked in different ways and at different times during the interview to see if the person being questioned answers them the same every time. < ref name=IntQuestCM/ > 
 
 === The Reid technique === 
 A method taught to police interrogators since the 1970s is called the [[Reid technique]]. < ref name=ForensicOut > {{cite web |url=http://forensicoutreach.com/4-police-interrogation-techniques-you-should-know-and-why-not-all-of-them-work/ |title=4 Police Interrogation Techniques You Should Know (And Why Not All of Them Work) |publisher=Forensic Outreach |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >  It was named for a Chicago police officer who developed it in the 1940s. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >  It is widely used in [[North America]] because it gets confessions; sometimes false confessions. < ref > Brian Gallini, 'Police 'Science' in the Interrogation Room: Seventy Years of Pseudo-Psychological Interrogation Methods to Obtain Inadmissible Confessions', ''Hastings Law Journal'', Vol. 61 (February 2010), p. 529 < /ref >  It is based on outdated [[psychology]] that maintains if a person shows stress they are lying. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >  Unfortunately most people show stress when in stressful conditions. Suspects are questioned, often by teams of police officers. The [[Good cop/bad cop]] routine seen on [[police procedural]] shows is an example of the Reid technique. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/defendants-rights/tactics-police-use-get-a-confession |title=Tactics Police Use to Get a Confession |publisher=NOLO |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >  The police use this method to convince a suspect that confessing to the crime (whether they are guilty or not) is the best way out for the suspect. Many false confessions have been obtained this way resulting in false in[[prison]]ments. 
 
 === Informal questioning === 
 A police officer may stop and question a person at any time. They do not need to give a [[Miranda v. Arizona|Miranda warning]] before informal questioning or before making an arrest. < ref name=faqFindLaw > {{cite web |url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/faqs-police-interrogations.html |title=FAQs: Police Interrogations |publisher=FindLaw |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >  But any information gained this way is not admissible at a trial against the person. Miranda required advising a person of their rights before being question in police custody. < ref name=faqFindLaw/ >  If the person asks the officer if they are free to leave, they are not in custody. < ref name=faqFindLaw/ >  That is one of the few things a police officer may not lie about. During questioning police may use [[trickery]], [[lying]] or other forms of [[deception]] in order to get a confession from a suspect. < ref name=faqFindLaw/ >    
 
 === PEACE method === 
 A fairly new technique is being used in the [[UK]], [[Denmark]], [[New Zealand]] and other places. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >  The word PEACE is an [[acronym]] for '''P'''reparation and Planning, '''E'''ngage and Explain, '''A'''ccount, '''C'''losure and '''E'''valuate. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >  It is considered a more [[Ethics|ethical]] model of police questioning. < ref name=Snook11 >  Brent Snook; John C. House, 'An alternative interviewing method', ''Blue Line Magazine'', (November 2008), pp. 11â€“12 < /ref >  It is intended to prevent wrongful convictions by eliminating any coercion or deceptive methods. < ref name=Snook11/ >  When tested in England and Wales, it resulted in the same percentage of convictions as the older methods produced. < ref name=Snook11/ >  Peace is more of a [[Journalist|journalistic]] approach. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >  It assumes a liar will find it increasingly difficult to keep all the lies consistent and will eventually break down and confess. < ref name=ForensicOut/ >   
 
 === Third degree === 
 A historic method of obtaining confessions is the applying of the so-called [[third degree (interrogation)|third degree]]. It consists of treating a suspect brutally, keeping them awake for long periods of time with no food or water. Beatings were given along with threats. Often a suspect confessed to stop the abuse. The suspect was then forced to sign a paper saying he was not intimidated or coerced into giving his statement. In 1937, the court threw out a confession upon learning it was not given voluntarily but the defendant had been hung from a tree and whipped until he confessed. < ref name=ForensicOut/ > 
 
 === Torture === 
 Even though it is a serious breach of most [[international]] [[agreement]]s, [[torture]] is still used by some police, military and intelligence services. < ref name=tortureRT > {{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/op-edge/cia-torture-information-kiriakou-766/ |title=Ex-CIA officer: Torture great way to get false confessions |date=25 January 2013 |publisher=RT network |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >  Torture is prohibited under [[international law]], but it is still used. In 2014 the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] found that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] tortured [[Terrorism|terror suspects]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/the-humane-interrogation-technique-that-works-much-better-than-torture/383698/ |title=The Humane Interrogation Technique That Actually Works |author=Olga Khazan |date=14 December 2014 |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |access-date=11 February 2016}} < /ref >
