However, it is likely that she did it because Mrs. Allen did not like her writing. < ref name=Doody/ >  However, the story of ''Evelina'' was still in her mind, and she began writing it secretly.

 == Summary == 
 === Volume one === 
 
 The novel begins with a letter from Lady Howard to her friend, the [[pastor|Reverend]] Arthur Villars. In the letter, Lady Howard says that Madame Duval (the grandmother of Evelina) is going to visit [[England]] to see her granddaughter Evelina again. In his reply, Reverend Villars tells her about Evelina's history. 18 years ago, Mme. Duval had been very angry with her daughter Caroline, Evelina's mother, when she ran away with Sir John Belmont. After they had married, Sir John Belmont burnt up the marriage papers, and said that it was the same as if they had never married. Unhappy, she went back to Reverend Villars, who had brought her up, as he now brought up Evelina. There, she gave birth to Evelina, and died. Reverend Villars is afraid that Mme. Duval might make Evelina die shamefully like her mother Caroline. 
 
 Reverend Villars wants to keep Evelina away from Mme. Duval, so he lets her visit Lady Howard's home. While she is there, they get news that Lady Howard's son-in-law, Captain Mirvan, is coming back to England. Evelina wants to see what [[London]] is like, and asks Reverend Villars to let her go there. Sadly, the Reverend says yes. 
 
 In London, people are [[wikt:attract|attracted]] by Evelina's [[beauty]] and [[wikt:doubt|doubtful]] birth. Evelina, who is [[intelligence|intelligent]], but very inexperienced, does not know about the rules of 18th century London society. Because of this, she makes many mistakes. She falls in love with Lord Orville, a handsome, modest, and polite man. Another man, Sir Clement Willoughby, is in love with Evelina, but her birth and his character make him try [[flirting]] with her instead of wishing to [[marriage|marry]] her. Evelina is confused and embarrassed by his behavior, but does not know how to stop him. 
 
 In London, Evelina is very surprised to meet her grandmother and some of her cousins, the Branghtons. She is embarrassed by their [[wikt:impolite|impolite]] behavior and thinks that Lord Orville will never love her. The Mirvans return to the country, taking Evelina with them. 
 
 Both Evelina and the Reverend are unhappy to hear Mme Duval's wish to sue Sir John Belmont. Lady Howard writes to Sir John Belmont instead, telling him about Evelina. Evelina waits for the answer fearfully. 
 
 === Volume two === 
 
 Sir Clermont Willoughby comes to Lady Howard's house without being invited. He and Captain Mirvan dress up like [[thief|robbers]] to play a trick on Mme. Duval, whom Captain Mirvan hates. They tell her that M. Du Bois, her friend, is in jail. Afraid, she goes to see if it is true with Evelina. While Captain Mirvan throws Mme. Duval into a [[wikt:ditch|ditch]] and ties her up, Sir Clement Willoughby talks to Evelina [[wikt:private|privately]]. Evelina feels very sorry for Mme. Duval, and tries to make Captain Mirvan stop his tricks, but he only becomes angry. Sir Clermont Willoughby offers to go away from Lady Howard's house, and leaves, to Evelina's [[happy|satisfaction]]. 
 
 Shortly after he leaves, Lady Howard receives a letter from Sir John Belmont. He says that he is already bringing up a daughter of Caroline, and that she will inherit his money. Evelina is very confused, and Mme Duval is [[anger|furious]]. She visited Reverend Villars and said she must take Evelina to [[lawsuit|sue]] Sir John Belmont. The Reverend says no. Then she [[wikt:threat|threatens]] that if Evelina does not live with her in [[London]], she will not give Evelina her money when she dies.  " To me, I own, this threat seemed of little consequence (importance), "  writes the Reverend,  " but...my diffidence (fear, shyness, doubt) of the right I have of depriving (taking away) her of so large a [[money|fortune]]...induced me to listen to her [[wikt:idea|proposal]] " . He tells Evelina to be careful, and  " ...not only ''judge'' but...''act'' for yourself " . Evelina goes with Mme Duval back to [[London]]. 
 
 Evelina lives with the Branghton family, and is very unhappy. Mme Duval is very angry to find out that she had been tricked by Captain Mirvan when she finds M. Du Bois at the Branghton's house. At the Branghtons' house, she meets a very poor, [[sadness|melancholy]] [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]], Mr. Macartney, and sees him with [[gun]]s in his hands, saying,  " O [[God]]!--forgive me! "  Thinking he is trying to [[suicide|kill himself]], she stops him and cries,  " O Sir! have [[mercy]] upon yourself! "  She later finds out he had been planning to rob people by [[fear|frightening]] them with his guns for [[money]], because the Branghtons had threatened to put him in [[prison]] if he didn't pay money to stay at their house. He had fallen in love with a lady, but the lady's father had been so angry, they had fought, and the father had become sick. When he told this to his mother, she told him the lady's father was actually his father, who had left them long ago - so the lady he had loved was actually his sister! Evelina gives him her own money, and makes friends with him. 
 
 She is very sad with the Branghtons, however. Once, they visited Marybone, a [[wikt:pleasure|pleasure]] [[garden]]. There, Evelina was attacked by a drunken [[sailor]] and saved by [[prostitute]]s. While she is with the prostitutes, she meets Lord Orville again. She is very surprised when he comes to visit her in the unfashionable part of London and again is kind to her. Later, the Branghtons use Evelina's name to ride in Lord Orville's [[carriage]], even breaking its [[glass]]. [[wikt:horror|Horrified]], Evelina writes a letter to Lord Orville saying that she was sorry for what the Branghtons did, and the Branghtons had used her name without even telling her. She is [[wikt:shock|shocked]] when she gets a [[wikt:insult|insulting]] reply from Lord Orville.  " Oh...how have I been [[wikt:deceive|deceived]] in this man! "  Soon after, she returns to Reverend Villars. There, she becomes very [[illness|ill]]. Worried, the Reverend sends her to Bristol Hotwells, a vacation town at Clifton Hill, with her  " [[wikt:extreme|extremely]] [[intelligence|clever]] "  neighbor, Mrs. Selwyn.
