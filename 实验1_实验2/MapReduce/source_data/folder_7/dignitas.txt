 In [[Ancient Rome]], '''''Dignitas''''' was regarded as the sum of the personal [[influence]] that a male [[citizen]] [[:wikt:acquire|acquired]] throughout his life. It included personal reputation, moral standing, and ethical worth and the man's entitlement to respect and proper treatment as well. 
 
 The word does not have a direct [[connotation]] or [[translation]] in English. Some interpretations include [[dignity]] (merely a [[derivation]]) and [[prestige]]. The [[Oxford Latin Dictionary]] defines the expression as fitness, suitability, worthiness, visual impressiveness or distinction, dignity of style and [[gesture]], [[rank]], [[status]], position, standing, esteem, importance, and [[honor]]. 
 
 == Origins == 
 Authors who had used ''dignitas'' extensively in their writings and oratories include M. Tullius [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar]], Cornelius [[Tacitus]], and T. Livius ([[Livy]]). The most prolific user was Cicero, who initially related it to the established term [[auctoritas]]. These two words were highly associated, auctoritas was thought to be the expression of a manâ€™s ''dignitas''. 
 
 == The changing definition of dignitas == 
 Over the course of Ancient Roman history, ''dignitas'' took on different meanings over time, adjusting for the gradually changing viewpoints of society, politicians, and the various authors. 
 
 Years after Caesar's death, his heir [[Augustus]] rejected the contemporary meaning of ''dignitas''. Augustus found the related term ''auctoritas'' to be a suitable alternative.
