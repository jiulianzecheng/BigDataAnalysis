 ==Geography== 
 [[File:Samoa upolu.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of [[Falefa Valley]] from Le Mafa Pass, east [[Upolu]].]] 
 Samoa is south of the [[equator]].  It is about halfway between [[Hawai‘i]] and New Zealand in the [[Polynesia]]n part of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters of Samoa's people 
 
 The two large islands of [[Upolu]] and [[Savai'i]] are 99% of the total land area.  There are eight small islets. These are the three islets in the [[Apolima Strait]]: [[Manono Island]], [[Apolima]] and [[Nu'ulopa]]. There are four [[Aleipata Islands]] off the eastern end of [[Upolu]].  They are: [[Nu'utele]], [[Nu'ulua]], [[Namua]], and [[Fanuatapu]].  And there is [[Nu'usafe'e]]. 
 
 East of Samoa is a group of islands called [[American Samoa]]. They are part of the [[United States]], but they are similar to the country Samoa, because they also speak Samoan. 
 
 Samoa used to be east of the [[International Date Line|international date line]]. In 2011, the line changed, so that Samoa would be to the west of the date line. < ref name= " Stuff.co.nz_4974902 " > {{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/4974902/Samoa-moves-into-tomorrow |title=Samoa moves into tomorrow |date=7 May 2011 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=7 November 2011}} < /ref >  This change took effect on the night of 29 December.  Friday was skipped altogether and the following day was Saturday 31 December. < ref name= " Samoans set to time travel " > {{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2 & objectid=10775783 |title=Samoans set to time travel |date=29 December 2011 |work=[[nzherald.co.nz]] |accessdate=28 December 2011 |archive-date=29 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229205918/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2 & objectid=10775783 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 [[File:Samoa Familie.JPG|thumb|left|alt=|A Samoan family]] 
 [[File:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|thumb|left|175px|alt=|A Samoan fire dancer.]] 
 Samoa has 194,320 people. 92.6% are [[Samoans]], 7% [[Euronesian]]s (people of mixed, European and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestors) and 0.4% are [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. 
 
 Religion in Samoa includes the following: [[Christian Congregational Church of Samoa]] 35.5%, [[Roman Catholic]] 19.6%, [[Methodist]] 15%, [[Latter-day Saint]]s 12.7%, [[Samoan Assemblies of God]] 10.6%, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] 3.5%, Worship Centre 1.3%, unspecified 0.8%.There is also about 522 Jehovah's Witnessses in Samoa since 1931. < ref > {{cite news | title =Samoa: People; Religions | url =https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ws.html#People | work =CIA World Factbook | accessdate =26 November 2007 | archive-date =21 May 2016 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160521030905/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ws.html#People | url-status =dead }} < /ref >  Samoa has one of seven [[Bahá'í House of Worship|Bahá'í Houses of Worship]] in the world. It is in [[Tiapapata]]. 
   
 Many people say that Samoan people are related to [[Māori people]] because lots of the language words are very similar to Maori language. 
 
 As with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawai'ian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[Māori culture|Māori]]), Samoans have two gender specific and culturally important [[tattoo]]s. For males, it is called the [[Pe'a]],  It is intricate and geometrical patterns [[tattoo]]ed on areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who has such a tatau is called a [[soga'imiti]]. A Samoan girl or ''teine'' is given a [[malu]].  It covers the area from just below her knees to her upper thighs. < ref > {{cite news | title =Worn With Pride  >  Tatau (Tatoo) | url =http://www.oma-online.org/worn_with_pride_04.html | work =Oceanside Museum of Art | accessdate =26 November 2007 | archive-date =30 March 2009 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090330024149/http://www.oma-online.org/worn_with_pride_04.html | url-status =dead }} < /ref >
