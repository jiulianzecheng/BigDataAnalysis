 '''Gars''' (or garpike) are a type of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]]. Gars have long bodies that are heavily armoured with scales. Their long jaws have long, sharp teeth. < ref name= " natgeo " > {{cite web |title=Gars, Gar Pictures, Gar Facts |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/gar/ |website=National Geographic |accessdate=14 June 2019 |date=16 November 2009 |archive-date=19 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719173824/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/gar/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |title=Gar |url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/85750.html |website=Department of Environmental Conservation, New York State |accessdate=14 June 2019 |archive-date=3 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803173715/https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/85750.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  All gars are relatively large fish.

 They are carnivores which eat other fish. There are seven species of living gars. Their peak period was in the early [[Mesozoic]]. Once worldwide, they are now confined to the [[Americas]]. 
 
 Unusually, their [[swim bladder]]s can function as lungs. Most gars surface once in while to take a gulp of air. < ref > {{cite web |title=Atractosteus spatula |url=https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/atractosteus-spatula/ |website=Florida Museum of Natural History |accessdate=14 June 2019 |date=10 May 2017}} < /ref >  Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans.
