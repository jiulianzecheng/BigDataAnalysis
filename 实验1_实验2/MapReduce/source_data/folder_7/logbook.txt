A '''logbook''' (or '''log book''') is a written account of the hours one works while driving a truck, bus, or ferry. In general, each logbook is set up with the same basic information, and they provide a record of one's work activity. Details (for example) include one's name, date, company address, hours on duty, hours sleeping, and hours driving.
