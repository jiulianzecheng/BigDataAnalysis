 " Plain "  sewing is mostly done to make or mend [[clothing]] and household furnishings such as [[curtain]]s, sheets, upholstery, and table linens. It is also used for [[sail]]s, [[bellows]], skin boats, banners and other items shaped out of flexible materials. < ref > {{Cite web|date=17 June 2021|title=What does sewing mean?|url=https://www.fashiongonerogue.com/how-to-turn-your-sewing-hobby-into-a-business/|access-date=13 August 2021|website=Fashion Gone Rogue|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 " Fancy "  sewing is done to decorate materials, such as [[embroidery]] or [[quilt]]ing. 
 
 Sewing is an important part of [[shoemaking]] and [[bookbinding]]. [[Wound]] < nowiki/ > s are often sewn shut. 
 
 If a thread becomes loose in a sewn item, the stitches may unravel and require restitching to repair them. In repair sewing, pulling the threaded needle in and out of the fabric at the same lengths and places as the other remaining stitches can make a repair nearly invisible. Replacing a missing button on a garment follows the same procedure, although there are different possible ways to place the thread to sew on a button. While repairs are usually sewn by hand, most garments are created using a machine, which can range from simple to complex. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is Sewing?
