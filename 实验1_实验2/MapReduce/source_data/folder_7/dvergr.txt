'''Dvergar''' or '''Norse dwarves''' ([[Old Norse]] ''dvergar'', singular ''dvergr'') are creatures in [[Norse mythology]]. They are associated with rocks, the earth, [[craft]] and [[Metalworking|metal work]], [[wisdom]], and [[greed]]. The dwarves came from [[maggot]]s that formed on [[Ymir]]'s skin as he was killed by [[Odin]], [[VÃ©]] and [[Vili]]. Odin transformed the maggots into dwarves. It is said that dwarves are [[blacksmith]]s and built weapons for war between the gods. Some say that dwarves and [[Elf|elves]] are the same thing.
