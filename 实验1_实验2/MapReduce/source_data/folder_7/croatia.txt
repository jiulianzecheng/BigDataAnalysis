 '''Croatia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Croatia.ogg|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} {{respell|kroh|AY|shə}}) is a unitary democratic [[parliamentary republic]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern]] [[Europe]]. Croatia has been influenced by powers from both regions at varying points in its history. Its [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Croatia|largest city]] is [[Zagreb]]. Croatia is a part of the [[Balkans]], and was one of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of [[Yugoslavia]]. It became independent in 1991. It joined the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. 
 
 ==History== 
 In earlier times, the land now known as Croatia was inhabited by different kinds of humans including [[Neanderthal]]s and [[Neolithic]] cultures. In Roman times, seafaring pirates known to the Romans as the Dalmatian Tribes lived there, as the Histri, Liburni and the Delmatae. The Romans conquered and annexed the territory in 9 & nbsp;AD, calling it the province of  " Dalmatia, "  named after these tribes. During more than 400 years of Roman rule, the province of Dalmatia would become Romanized. The Roman invaders mixed with the natives and their descendants adopted a Roman lifestyle even after the collapse of the Roman state in 476 & nbsp;AD. 
 
 In the early seventh century AD, pagan [[West Slavs]] named the [[Croats]] (where Croatia gets its name) came to live in the former province of Dalmatia when they conquered the people already living there. However, they would soon be influenced by [[Roman Catholic]] Christian missionaries who completed the process of [[Christianization]] in the early 9th century. From the time of the crowning of Tomislav in 925 as the first King of Croatia, Croatia would become its own independent Catholic kingdom until 1102, when a Hungarian prince inherited the Croatian throne. The Hungarians would rule as Kings of Croatia until the early modern period, when the last Hungarian king of Croatia Louis II was killed at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526 and the kingdom chose the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand as king the next year. 
 
 Croatia would remain as a part of the empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] under Ferdinand's descendants until 1918. In 1918 it became a part of Kingdom of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs, later named [[Yugoslavia]] which was occupied in [[World War II]]. 
 After a short war with Italy a [[Fascism|fascist dictatorship]] formed the [[Independent State of Croatia]] in 1941, but it was not independent from the control of [[Nazi Germany]] (see also [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]). 
 
 In 1945, Croatia became a part of new Yugoslavia (Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) which was non-aligned after breaking connections with Eastern Bloc. It collapsed in 1991 as initially Slovenia, than Croatia, later other republics claimed independence and became parliamentary democracies. War with Yugoslavia made a strong impact on society in economic, political and cultural terms. Civil society and media that came out of [[Arkzin|anti-war struggle in Croatia]] grew against nationalism, media and civil freedoms, later also corruption. 
 
 The country's democratic development around 2000, made it possible for Croatia to finally join Slovenia as only the second republic to become the [[European Union]] member on 1 July 2013. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2011-05-23/19468/Croatia_to_become_EU_member_1_July_2013|title=Croatia to become EU member 1 July 2013|work=Croatian Times|date=May 23, 2011|accessdate=November 17, 2011|archive-date=August 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809070417/http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2011-05-23/19468/Croatia_to_become_EU_member_1_July_2013|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 == Tourism == 
 After the war that devastated the country, Croatia has rebuilt its infrastructure, revitalizing its image as a Mediterranean country with crystal clear waters, medieval cities that mix western and eastern architecture, respect for the environment and traditions with the arrival of tourism. [[Dubrovnik]] has become the most characteristic symbol of this new Croatia that is strongly committed to European tourism. It is developing a type of tourism based on sustainability, in which culture, gastronomy and nature coexist with the visitor, offering them the experience of discovering Croatia as part of it. 
 
 There are many reasons to visit Croatia. Its six UNESCO World Heritage sites : Dubrovnik's Old Town (undoubtedly one of the most beautiful cities in [[Europe]]), the Diocletian's Palace in Split, the historic core of Trogir, the Cathedral of St. James of Sibenik, the Plitvice Lakes National Park, or the Episcopal Ensemble of the Euphrasian Basilica in the Historic Center of Porec (Istria) . 
 
 Nature is another attractive source of tourism in Croatia. Its eight National Parks and ten Natural Parks with their varied fauna and flora show all their splendor, with a coastline that winds from the Istria Peninsula to the south of Dalmatia, leaving beautiful coves, beaches, and cliffs. The islands, such as Hvar or Korcula, in Dalmatia or Rab and Losinj in Kvarner Bay, which are sometimes grouped together in archipelagos as interesting as those of Brijuni or Kornati, they host millions of tourists who seek peace or the possibility of practicing nudism, so associated with Croatia, in its crystalline waters. More than a thousand islands and islets that make up the Adriatic Coast, a paradise for those who love sailing and seek to cross the Adriatic by Sailboat . 
 
 The variety of the tourist offer in Croatia goes beyond the beautiful cities Dubrovnik, [[Zagreb]] or Split.
