A '''ghoul''' is a [[monster]] from [[mythology|ancient Arabian folklore]]. Ghouls live in burial grounds and other [[uninhabited]] places.

 ''Ghoul'' is also a [[shapeshifter|shapeshifting]] demon that lives in the [[desert]]. The demon can take the form of an animal, especially a [[hyena]]. It lures unwary travellers into the desert. It will [[then]] [[kill]] and [[eat]] them. The creature also [[prey]]s on [[young]] [[children]], [[rob]]s [[Grave (burial)|graves]], and eats the dead. < ref > " ghoul " , ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. < /ref >  Because of this [[habit]] the word ''ghoul'' is sometimes used to refer to an ordinary human such as a [[grave robber]], or to anyone who likes the [[macabre]].

 == In Iran == 
 In Iranian mythologies, Ghouls are creatures very similar to humans, but larger. Usually they are less intelligent and not necessarily evil. 
 Most Persian speakers use Ghoul to describe large people (figuratively  " [[giant]]s " ). This may or may not be considered an insult, depending on the situation. 
 
 == How ghouls are shown == 
 
 Ghouls and ghoul-like creatures have been portrayed in different ways in [[fiction]], including a series of [[dark fantasy]], short stories by [[Brian McNaughton]], a [[Michael Slade]] novel,  " [[Ghoul (Slade)|Ghoul]] " , [[Larry Niven]]'s  " [[Ringworld]] "  series, [[J.K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] series, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the works of [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]], [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]'s [[Anita Blake]] series, and [[Jim Butcher]]'s [[The Dresden Files]]. 
 
 === Literature === 
 
 Morlocks are a [[List of fictional humanoid species|fictional species]] of cannibalistic ghouls, created by [[H. G. Wells]] for his 1895 novel, ''[[The Time Machine]]''. The Morlocks, as well as another supposed offshoot of [[humans]], the [[:en:Eloi|Eloi]], exist in the future world in the year 802,701 A.D. in ''[[The Time Machine]]''. 
 
 [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' has a character that acts much like a ghoul.  The character is named [[Renfield]]. Under the vampire's influence, Renfield becomes his willing [[slave]]. He develops a craving to eat living creatures in the hope of obtaining their life-force for himself. After being confined to an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]], he considers eating a human hospital orderly, but finds he can only capture and consume [[fly|flies]], [[spider]]s, and the occasional [[bird]]. 
 
 In the fiction of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], a ghoul is a member of a [[nocturnal]] race that lives underground. Some ghouls were once human, but a diet of human corpses, and perhaps the tutelage of proper ghouls, changed them into horrific bestial [[humanoid]]s. In the [[short story]]  " [[Pickman's Model]] "  ([[1927 in literature|1927]]), the first of Lovecraft's ghoul stories, they are unutterably terrible monsters; however, in his earlier [[novella]] ''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'' ([[1926 in literature|1926]]), the ghouls are somewhat less disturbing, even comical at times, and both helpful and loyal to the protagonist. [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Pickman, Richard Upton|Richard Upton Pickman]], a noteworthy [[Boston]] painter who disappeared mysteriously in  " Pickman's Model " , appears as a ghoul himself in ''Dream-Quest''. Similar themes appear in  " The Lurking Fear "  ([[1922 in literature|1922]]) and  " The Rats in the Walls "  ([[1924 in literature|1924]]). Both of stories claim there are subterranean clans of degenerate,  cannibals or carrion-eating humans. 
 
 In modern and contemporary fiction, ghouls are often confused with other types of [[undead]], usually the mindless varieties of [[zombies]]. Although modern fiction (post-1954), particularly 1954's ''[[I Am Legend]]'', suggests that the latter beings share cannibalistic habits with ghouls, it is nonetheless generally believed that [[vampire]]s and [[zombie]]s prefer live prey. 
 
 In [[:en:Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert]]'s [[Dune]] series, a ''Ghola'' is a deceased person who has been brought back to life, via a secret, almost illegal [[Tleilaxu]] technology. Traditionally, the ''Ghola'' is stripped of memories from his or her past life and taught new skills. ''Ghola'' are often sold to nobles by the [[Tleilaxu]] as servants and retainers. Given their highly superstitious nature, Fremen are distrustful of ghola, despite the potential usefulness of the living dead. The ambiguity as to whether or not latent memories of the  " old self "  are still present in the ghola's mind is a long-drawn debate throughout the story. It has been suggested that the term ''ghola'' originates in Arabic, as do other terms in the Dune series. 
 
 === Movies and television === 
 Although many [[screenplay]]s have featured ghouls, the first major motion picture of this theme was the 1933 British movie entitled ''[[The Ghoul]]''. The actor [[Boris Karloff]] plays a dying Egyptologist who possesses an occult gem, known as The Eternal Light, which he believes will grant immortality if he is buried with it, and thereby able to present it to [[Anubis]] in the afterlife. Of course, his bickering covetous heirs and associates would rather keep the jewel for themselves. Karloff vows to rise from his grave and avenge himself against anyone who meddles with his plan, and he keeps this promise when one of his colleagues steals The Eternal Light after his death. 
 
 In [[1968]], George A. Romero's movie ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' combined reanimated corpses (zombies) with cannibalistic monsters (ghouls). With this, it created new movie monsters more terrifying than either of the two alone. The term  " ghoul "  was the one actually used in the movie. The term [[zombies]] came later, after the movie was released. Romero had never thought of them that way; he said he thought of the [[Caribbean]] creatures, when he heard the term ''zombies''. 
 
 The 1976 Turkish movie 'Milk Brothers' (original story by H. Rahmi Gurpinar's 'Ghoul') is a Turkish comedy. Here, a ghoul is a monster with extra power. Ghoul is a monster that was used to frighten little children in the old times, so here the ghoul is used to frighten not only little children, but as well big people. 
 
 The 1975 British movie ''The Ghoul'' (unrelated to the Karloff movie) stars [[Peter Cushing]] as a [[defrocked]] missionary whose son has developed a taste for human flesh while traveling in [[India]]. As the son's mind and body degenerate, Cushing has several young people dispatched and prepared as food for his offspring, whom he keeps locked up in the [[attic]]. 
 
 The 1975 [[anthology]] movie ''[[The Monster Club]]'' featured a scene where a [[village]] of ghouls stumbled upon by an unwary traveller ([[Stuart Whitman]]), who temporarily escapes the creatures with the help of one half-human girl, but he is recaptured when it turns out that the ghouls have representatives inhabiting our normal human world. 
 
 In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Hellsing]]'', ghouls are [[zombie]]-like creatures that are created when a  " chipped "  (technological) vampire drains a victim to death, or, in the Manga, where a vampire drains the blood of someone who is not a virgin. If fatally wounded, they instantly crumble to dust. They are under the control of the vampire who bites them, eat human [[flesh]], and are intelligent enough to use [[firearms]]. It is not rare to see a [[vampire]] make a small army of Ghouls for attack or defense. 
 
 " The Ghoul "  is the stage name of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-area horror television host [[Ron Sweed]]. 
 
 The Batman comics-based franchise, including the [[2005]] movie, ''[[Batman Begins]]'', has an [[antagonist]] named, [[Ra's al Ghul|Rā's al-Ghūl]], whose name derives from the original Arabic name for the star [[Algol]] in the [[constellation]] [[Perseus]] meaning  " the monster's (i.e. [[Medusa]]'s) head " .
