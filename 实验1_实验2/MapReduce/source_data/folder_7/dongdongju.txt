'''Dongdongju''' is a traditional [[liquor]] in [[Gyeonggido|Gyeonggi-do]], [[Korea]]. Dongdongju was named because the [[grain]]s of boiled [[rice]] float to the [[surface]] of the drink while it is brewed.  It is also called Buryuju(floating alcohol). 
 
 There are two ways to [[brew]] Dongdongju. One way is to brew with [[gluten|non-glutinous]] [[rice]], [[yeast]], [[wheat]] flour, and [[water]]. The other way is to brew with glutinous rice, yeast powder, and water. In the Korean book named ''Kyu Gon Si Ui Bang'', the making process of Dongdongju is written very precisely. 
 
 In [[1983]], the Korean cultural assets office sent a [[report]] of investigation and designated Kwon O soo to the making vocational technician of Kyungi Dongdongju. According to him, with 100 kilogram of glutinous rice, 14L of water (14%), and 15 & nbsp;kg of yeast (15%), 240L of Dongdongju can be brewed about 15~20 days. It can be brewed any time, but especially from September to November is the right time to brew.
