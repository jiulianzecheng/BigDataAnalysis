 Mitamaya altars are not as commonly found in Japanese households as their [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] counterpart, the [[butsudan]], because Buddhist funeral rites are more commonly practiced in Japan. Mitamaya altars are considered less valuable than [[kamidana]] altars, which are highly respected in Japanese culture. < ref name= " Hearn " > {{Cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/shi/jai/jai05.htm|title=Japan, an Attempt at Interpretation|last=Hearn|first=Lafcadio|publisher=The Macmillan Company|year=1904|location=New York|pages=42–45}} < /ref > 
 == Ritual == 
 The mitamaya altar is usually placed in an inner chamber on a shelf called  " mitama-san-no-tana, "  which is attached to the wall at a height of about six feet. It is positioned lower than the kamidana altar.. < ref name= " dictionary " / > 
 
 Rituals are performed for the mitamaya altar every tenth day up to the fiftieth day after the death of the family member. After that, rituals are performed on the one-hundredth day and on the one-year anniversary of the death. After the one-year ritual, another ritual is performed to mark the spirit's joining of the ancestors at the family shrine.. < ref name= " Shinousai " > {{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1054|title=Shinsōsai (Shinto Funeral Rites)|last=Motegi|first=Sadazumi|date=24 February 2007|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics, Kokugakuin University|accessdate=2007-08-09}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 In ancient times, people held domestic rites called [[kinensai]] in the February or April and [[Niiname-no-Matsuri|Niinamesai]] in November. During these rites, people worshiped their ancestors, the god of food, and the hearth deity. They believed the spirits of their ancestors ([[Oyagami]]) came to them through the rice. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 During the [[Heian period]] cults of [[Goryō]] developed and people changed to honoring the dead in [[July]] for Urabon-e, and in [[January]]. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 During the medieval period, people started to enshrine the spirits of dead individuals, like Retired [[Emperor Go-Toba|Emperor Gotoba]] (1180-1239) whose memory was kept through [[Spirit tablet|memorial tablets]]. In the early modern period, there was a rise in  " Shinto funerals "  (shinsōsai) where people were treated like kami. The Yoshida clan gave spirit ranks like Myōjin-gō, Reisha-gō, and Reijin-gō to the dead, who were sometimes worshipped at shrines. < ref name= " :02 " > {{Cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto詳細|url=https://d-museum.kokugakuin.ac.jp/eos/detail/id=9664|access-date=2023-04-15|website=國學院大學デジタルミュージアム|language=ja}} < /ref > 
 
 The spread of [[Kokugaku]] led to an increased interest in Miyamaya, and more people enshrined their ancestors in their homes. < ref name= " :0 " / > 
 
 The first modern mitamaya was constructed in 1599 at the Toyokuni Shrine in [[Kyoto]], Japan for [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Screen paintings and the remains of the shrine suggest that it was designed based on the [[Kitano Tenman-gū]]. Unfortunately, it was later destroyed by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] clan. < ref > {{Cite web|year=2001|title=reibyou　霊廟|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/r/reibyou.htm|access-date=2007-08-09|publisher=Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System}} < /ref > 
 
 Later on, the mitamaya became a symbol of high status and was mainly established for Japanese nobles, military heroes, and other respected individuals. This practice became more widespread during the [[Edo period]]. As part of the Kokugaku movement, it became more common for ordinary households to erect mitamaya altars. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=287|title=Mitamaya|last=Okada|first=Yoshiyuki|date=2 June 2005|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics, Kokugakuin University|accessdate=2007-08-09}} < /ref >  These altars played a central role in Shinto funeral rituals known as  " shinsōsai "  (神葬祭). < ref name= " Shinousai "  / >
