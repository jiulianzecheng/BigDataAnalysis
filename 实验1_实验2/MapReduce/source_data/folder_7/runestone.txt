 A '''Runestone''' or '''Rune stone''' is a large [[stone]], with [[rune]]s inscribed on it, dating from the early [[Middle Ages]]. Currently, about 6000 such stones are known to exist in [[Scandinavia]]. About half of them date from the [[10th century|tenth]] and [[11th century|eleventh century]], and were found in [[Sweden]]. Most of them are like grave stones. They announce the life and death of a local person. About 10 percent of the known stones tell about the travels and deaths of persons abroad. Some of these texts are similar to what [[Scandinavia]]ns who travelled to [[Byzantium]] have written in [[Latin language|Latin]].
