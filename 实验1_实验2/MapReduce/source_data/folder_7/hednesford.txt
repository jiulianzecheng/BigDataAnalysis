 ==History== 
 [[File:William_Yates_1775_Hedgford_Map.png|200px|left|thumb|Part of a map of Staffordshire made in 1775 by William Yates. Hednesford is called ''Hedgford'' on this map.]] 
 The first mention of Hednesford was in 1153, when the town was called ''Hedenedford''. King Stephen decided to not make the people in the hamlet have to pay a tax called a {{interlanguage link|pannage|en}} due. His choice meant that people in the hamlet no longer had to pay to let their [[pig]]s eat in the forest. < ref > {{cite web
