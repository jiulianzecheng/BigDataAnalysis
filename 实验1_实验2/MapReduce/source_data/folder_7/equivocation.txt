 '''Equivocation''' is a [[fallacy]] when a word has more than one meaning and the person arguing confuses the multiple meanings of the word to prove an argument correct. For example,  " All trees have bark. All dogs bark. Therefore, all dogs are trees. " < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://penlighten.com/equivocation-fallacy|title=Examples That Illustrate the Meaning of Equivocation Fallacy|date=2015-01-19|website=Penlighten|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-19}} < /ref >  This is a fallacy because the two times  " bark "  is used in the argument have very different meanings from each other, while in the argument, the word  " bark "  should have the same meaning the whole argument. The first meaning of  " bark "  is the outer layer of a tree, and the second meaning is a shouting sound that a dog makes. The argument does not work because the person changed the meaning of  " bark "  in the middle of the argument.
