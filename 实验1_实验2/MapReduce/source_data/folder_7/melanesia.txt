 '''Melanesia''' is a region of islands in [[Oceania]].  
 
 It stretches from the western side of the Eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], to the [[Arafura Sea]], northeast of [[Australia]]. Its name was invented in 1832 and means  " black islands " .  
 
 The following islands and groups of islands since the 19th century have been considered part of Melanesia: 
 * [[Bismarck Archipelago]] 
 * [[Fiji]] 
 * [[New Caledonia]]

 Some of the islands to the west of New Guinea such as [[Halmahera]], [[Alor]], and [[Pantar]] can also be considered part of Melanesia, although people in this area do not make use of the term.
