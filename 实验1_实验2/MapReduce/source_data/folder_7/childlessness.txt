'''Childlessness''' is not having a [[child]]. Since the 1970s, there are more childless people. < ref > {{cite web|title=Having it All without Having Children|publisher=TIME Magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2148636,00.html|access-date=Jan 18, 2014}} < /ref >  There are two kinds of childlessness, voluntary and involuntary. 
 
 Voluntary childlessness is when people choose to not have children. People do this for several reasons, which include: 
 *[[Celibacy]] (not having [[sexual intercourse]]) 
 *Not wanting to have a child (see [[Childfree]]) 
 *Not having enough money to take care of a child 
 *Being too old to have a child 
 Voluntary childlessness is sometimes called [[childfree]]. 
 
 There are also several reason for involuntary childlessness, including: 
 *[[Infertility]], which means they are unable to biologically have children. 
 *[[Infant mortality|the death of an infant or child]] either before, during, or shortly after birth. 
 
 ==Options for involuntary childlessness== 
 Sometimes a couple can have a child through [[artificial insemination]], when a sperm is place in a woman's uterus immediately after ovulation. Another option is [[in vitro fertilization]] (or IVF). In this process, a sperm and an egg are placed together until fertilization happens, then the egg is put into the uterus.
