 A {{nihongo|'''Tomason'''|トマソン}}, also spelled '''Thomason''' and '''Thomasson''' in English, < ref > [http://greg.org/archive/2008/02/04/on_tomason_or_the_flipside_of_dame_architecture.html   " On Tomason, Or The Flipside Of ''Dame'' Architecture, " ] February 4, 2008; retrieved 2012-4-26. < /ref >  is a kind of [[conceptual art]] or [[found art]]. [[Gempei Akasegawa ]] created this word to describe certain kinds of useless parts of buildings or roads. < ref > Munroe, Alexandra. (1994).

 ==Origin of the name== 
 Akasegawa named this special kind of  " art "  after an [[United States|American]] baseball player who joined the [[Yomiuri Giants]] in 1981. [[Gary Thomasson]] became famous in Japan for getting the biggest baseball contract ever, then playing very poorly and retiring early. < ref > Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse. (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rDGd7HDMFp4C & dq=tomason+%2B+art & pg=PA397  ''The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life,'' p. 397 n25]. < /ref >

 Tomason can be grouped by features they have in common. These include:  " useless stairways " ,  " pointless doorways " ,  " overhangs " ,  " blocked windows " ,  " sealed up walls " ,  " A-bomb type " , {{nihongo|High places|高所|kōsho}} (doors opening from a high place into open air),  " outies " ,  " poundcakes " ,  " atago "  (strange bumps or things sticking up out of the road for no reason),  " premature burial "  (when a wall is built partly covering an existing feature), and more.
