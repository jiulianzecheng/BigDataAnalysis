'''Pentene''' is the name of [[alkene]]s with the formula C < sub > 5 < /sub > H < sub > 10 < /sub > . They are [[hydrocarbon]]s. In total, there are five different pentenes. Pentens occur in [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] processes and in [[natural gas]]. Pentenes are used for [[polymerization]], and for the [[synthesis]] of [[isoprene]], [[amyl alcohol]]s and [[Alkylphenol]]s. Amyl alcohols are used as [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] in the production of [[Chloroform]] and [[Dichloromethane]] to stop [[phosgene]] from being made.
