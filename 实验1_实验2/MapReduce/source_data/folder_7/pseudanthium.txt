 A '''pseudanthium''' (Greek for  " false flower " ) or '''flower head''' is a special type of [[inflorescence]]. < ref name=Hutchinson > {{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=John|title=The genera of flowering plants (Angiospermae)|url=https://archive.org/details/generaofflowerin0001hutc|year=1964|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press}} < /ref >  Many [[flower]]s are grouped together to form a flower-like structure. The real flowers ( " florets " ) are generally small and greatly reduced, < ref name=calfloraGlossary > {{cite web |  title = Calflora botanical terms | url = http://www.calflora.net/botanicalnames/botanicalterms.html | accessdate = 2012-02-26 }} < /ref >  but can sometimes be quite large (as in the [[sunflower]] flower head). 
 
 Pseudanthia are characteristic of the daisy and sunflower [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Asteraceae]] or Compositae). Their flowers are either ''ray flowers'' or ''disk flowers''. The disk flowers in the center of the pseudanthium look like the centre of a normal flower. Flowers on the periphery have one large petal. This sytem is unique to this family. Either ray or disk flowers may be absent in some [[species]]: ''Senecio vulgaris'' lacks ray flowers < ref name= " MissouriPlants " > {{cite web| last=| first=| title=Senecio vulgaris L.| publisher=Missouri Plants| url=http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Senecio_vulgaris_page.html| accessdate=2 December 2012| archive-date=27 June 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627073613/http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Senecio_vulgaris_page.html| url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and ''Taraxacum officinale'' lacks disk flowers. < ref name= " MissouriPlants " / > < ref name= " FloridaData " > {{cite web | last= | first= | title=''Taraxacum officinale'' |publisher=Florida Data| url=http://www.floridata.com/ref/T/tara_off.cfm| accessdate = 2 December 2012}} < /ref >  The pseudanthium has a whorl of [[bract]]s below the flowers. 
 
 At a glance, a pseudanthium (inflorescence) looks just like a normal flower, but closer inspection shows it is composed of multiple flowers. Thus, the pseudanthium represents an [[evolution]] of the inflorescence to a reproductive unit that may function in [[pollination]] like a single flower, at least in plants that are animal pollinated. The advantage of this  " flower "  is that it produces far more [[seeds]] than a normal flower, but needs only one act of pollination.
