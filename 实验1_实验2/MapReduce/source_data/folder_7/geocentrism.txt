 '''Geocentrism''' is the belief that the [[Earth]] is fixed at the centre of the [[Universe]]. Geocentrists accept that the Earth is round. Before the [[16th century]], most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s are moving across the sky. The geocentric model was the predominant description of the cosmos in many European [[Ancient history|ancient]] civilizations, such as those of [[Aristotle]] in Classical Greece and [[Ptolemy]] in Roman Egypt.

 From the 15th to the 17th century, [[astronomer]]s, especially [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo]] and [[Kepler]], found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called [[heliocentrism]].
