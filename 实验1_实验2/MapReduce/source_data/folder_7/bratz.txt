 There have been a number of animated Bratz [[direct-to-video]] movies. ''Bratz Go to Paris: The Movie'' is a re-release of the three ''Bratz'' episodes where the Bratz go to Paris. ''Bratz Babyz Save Christmas'', originally released in 2008, was re-released in 2013 as ''Bratz Babyz Save Christmas: The Movie''. ''Bratz: The Movie'' from 2007 is the only [[live-action]] Bratz feature film. It was co-produced by MGA Entertainment. The plot involves the four Bratz girls starting high school. It received overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics; the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] consensus reads:  " Full of mixed messages and dubious role-models, ''Bratz'' is too shallow even for its intended [[audience]].
