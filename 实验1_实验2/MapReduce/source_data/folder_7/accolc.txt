'''ACCOLC''' ('''Access Overload Control''') was a process in the [[United Kingdom]] for limiting [[mobile telephone]] use in times of emergencies. It is like the GTPS ([[Government Telephone Preference Scheme]]) for [[landline]]s. 
 
 This process allowed the telephone networks to limit access in a specific area to registered numbers only and is normally started by the Police Incident Commander (although it can be invoked by the [[Cabinet Office]]). The [[emergency service]]s are responsible for registering their key numbers in advance. 
 
 ACCOLC was replaced by [[MTPAS]] (Mobile Telecommunication Privileged Access Scheme) in 2009. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/resilient-communications|title=Resilient communications - GOV.UK|publisher=gov.uk|date=20 February 2013|access-date=17 June 2021}} < /ref >
