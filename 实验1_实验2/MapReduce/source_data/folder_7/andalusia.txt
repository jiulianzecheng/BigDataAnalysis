 '''Andalusia''' ({{lang-es|'''Andalucía'''}}) is the [[Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities by population|first in population]] among the 17 [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous communities]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities by area|second]] in area. The territory is divided into eight [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]]: [[Province of Almería|Almería]], [[Cádiz (province)|Cádiz]], [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|Córdoba]], [[Granada (province)|Granada]], [[Huelva (province)|Huelva]], [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]] and [[Seville (province)|Seville]]. Its capital is the city of [[Seville]] (Spanish: ''Sevilla'').  
 
 Andalusia is in the south of the [[Iberian peninsula]], just to the south of the autonomous communities of [[Extremadura]] and [[Castile-La Mancha]]; west of the autonomous community of [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; east of [[Portugal]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; and north of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The small [[British overseas territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]] shares a land border with the Andalusian province of Cádiz at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.  
 
 ==History== 
 The name Andalusia is the modern version of the [[Arabic language]] ''[[Al-Andalus]]'' (الأندلس), name used by the [[Muslim]] Moors for all of the territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under their control. During that period, northern [[Iberian Peninsula]] was controlled by [[Christian]] kings and the southern [[Iberian Peninsula]] was controlled by [[Moors]]. 
 
 In 711 [[CE]], the Moors invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]], then controlled by [[Christian]]s of [[Visigoth]]ic origin. By 719 the [[Moors]] conquered all of the peninsula except for a small area in the northern [[Pyrenees]] Mountains. The [[Moors]] used the name [[Al-Andalus]] for all of the territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under their control. 
 
 [[Christian]]s in the north waged war for more than seven [[centuries]] against the [[Moors]], gradually taking over more and more of the southern areas. This process of war is called the ''[[Reconquista]]'' (a Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word meaning  " to [[conquest]] again " ). In the year 1492 under [[Spanish Inquisition]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain retook the last [[stronghold]] in the southern area at [[Granada]]. In that same year, the majority [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] and [[Sephardi Jews]] were forced to leave [[Spain]], other who want stay in Andalusia got baptized and became Catholic Christians. 
 
 ==Symbols== 
 The Andalusian [[coat of arms]] shows the figure of [[Hercules]] and two [[lion]]s between the two [[pillars of Hercules]] that [[tradition]] puts on both sides of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The words below read ''Andalucía por sí, para España y la Humanidad'' ( " Andalusia by herself, for Spain and Humanity " ). Over the two columns is an [[arch]] in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''Dominator Hercules Fundator''. < ref name= " himno y escudo "  / > 
 
 The official [[flag]] of Andalusia has three equal horizontal [[:wikt:stripe|stripes]], colored green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is on the central stripe. It was approved in a [[meeting]] in 1918 of [[Andalusian nationalism|Andalusian nationalists]] at [[Ronda]], a city in the [[province]] of [[Málaga (province)|Málaga]]. < ref name= " himno y escudo "  / > 
 
 [[File:Himno de Andalucía.ogg|thumb|left|An instrumental version of the Andalusian anthem.]] 
 The [[national anthem|anthem]] of Andalusia was [[Musical composition|composed]] by José del Castillo Díaz with [[lyrics]] by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by ''Santo Dios'', a [[Religion|religious]] [[Folk music|folk song]] sung at [[harvest]] time by [[peasant]]s. < ref name= " himno y escudo "  / > 
 
 The national [[holiday]], the ''Día de Andalucía'', is celebrated on 28 February. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Andalusia is one of the 17 Spanish autonomous communities and is in the southwestern region of the [[European Union]]. < ref name= " junta-geo " > {{cite web | title=Andalucía: Puerta de Europa | publisher=Junta de Andalucia | url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/andalucia/alsur/contrastes.html |language=es |access-date=27 July 2013 }} < /ref >  It has a surface area of {{convert|87597|km2|sqmi}}, 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. By [[Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities by area|area]], it is the second Spanish autonomous community. 
 
 The natural limits of Andalusia are: to the south, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; to the north, the [[Sierra Morena]], [[mountain range]] that separates Andalusia from the autonomous communities of [[Extremadura]] and [[Castilla-La Mancha]]; to the west is [[Portugal]]; and to the east is [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]. < ref name= " junta-geo "  / >

 [[File:Mulhacen north face.JPG|175px|left|thumb|[[Mulhacén]] peak, north face]] 
 Andalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over {{convert|1000|m|ft}}. The picture is similar for areas under {{convert|100|m|ft}} (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of [[slope]]s. 
 
 The Atlantic [[coast]] is mostly beach and gradually [[Slope|sloping]] coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many [[cliff]]s. < ref > {{cite book | last =Ojeda | first =J. | chapter =espn | title =Geografía de Andalucía (Coor.

 The three main [[Geography|geographical]] regions of Andalusia are: 
 
 # The [[Sierra Morena]] separates Andalusia from the [[plain]]s of Extremadura and Castile–La Mancha on Spain's [[Meseta Central]]. Although few people live there, this is not a particularly high [[Mountain range|range]]. 
 # The [[Baetic Cordillera]] consists of the [[parallel]] mountain ranges of the [[Cordillera Penibética]] near the Mediterranean coast and the [[Cordillera Subbética]] to the north. The Cordillera Subbética is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penibético forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penibética in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in the Iberian peninsula: [[Mulhacén]] at {{convert|3481|m|ft}} and [[Veleta (Sierra Nevada)|Veleta]] at {{convert|3324|m|ft}}. < ref name= " junta-alta " > {{cite web | title=Alta montaña en Andalucía | publisher=Junta de Andalucia |work=Ecosistemas naturales de Andalucía |url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/html/adjuntos/2008/02/11/0004/altamontana.html |language=es |access-date=27 July 2013 }} < /ref > 
 # Lower Andalusia or [[valley]] of the [[Guadalquivir]] is between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the part of Andalusia where there are more people. 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 [[File:Olivares en Jaén.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Olive tree]]s in [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], Andalusia.]] 
 In general, Andalusia has a [[Mediterranean climate]], except in the Valley of Granada ({{lang-es|Vega de Granada}}), with occasional heavy rains and extremely hot temperatures. 
 
 Rainfall decreases from west to east. The place in Andalusia with the highest [[rainfall]] is in the Sierra de Grazalema ({{convert|2138|mm|in}} per year) and the driest place is Cabo de Gata, the place with the least amount of rainfall in Europe with only {{convert|117|mm|in}} of rain per year. 
 
 The average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over {{convert|16|°C|°F}}. Averages in the cities range from {{convert|15.1|°C|°F}} in [[Baeza]] to {{convert|18.5|°C|°F}} in [[Málaga]]. < ref name= " ibernature " > {{cite web | url=http://www.iberianature.com/regions/andalucia/climate-of-andalusia-andalucia/ | title=Climate of Andalusia | publisher=Iberia Nature | access-date=27 July 2013 }} < /ref >  Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about {{convert|18|°C|°F}}. The coldest month is January when [[Granada]] at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of {{convert|6.4|°C|°F}}. The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of {{convert|28.5|°C|°F}} for Andalusia as a whole. [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] is the hottest provincial capital, followed by [[Seville]]. 
 
 [[File:Río Guadalquivir Cordoba.jpg|thumb|right|The Guadalquivir as it passes through Córdoba.]] 
 The mountain ranges are cooler than the plains and have a higher rainfall with some snow in winter. The Sierra Nevada, above {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is [[snow]] covered for most of the year. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.absoluteaxarquia.com/climate.html | title=Climate and weather in Andalusia | publisher=AbsoluteAxarquia | access-date=27 July 2013 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Rivers=== 
 Andalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the [[Guadiana]], [[Odiel]]-[[Río Tinto|Tinto]], [[Guadalquivir]], [[Guadalete]], and [[Barbate (river)|Barbate]]. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the [[Guadiaro]], [[Guadalhorce]], [[Guadalmedina]], [[Guadalfeo]], [[Andarax]] (also known as the Almería) and [[Almanzora (river)|Almanzora]]. Of these, the [[Guadalquivir]] is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at {{convert|657|km|mi}}. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.ign.es/ign/layoutIn/anetabladatosdatoshidrograficoshidrografia.do?buscar=SI & tipo=rios & vertiente=ATL%C1NTICA & cuenca=GUADALQUIVIR | title=Datos Geográficos y Toponimia - Guadalquivir | publisher=Instituto Geográfico Nacional | language=es | access-date=27 July 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >

 == People == 
 The '''Andalusians''' are the inhabitants of '''Andalusia''' of the southern region in [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Traditional male [[Circumcision]] is usually performed due to [[Islam]]ic influence, especially in the [[Province of Granada]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://pap.es/article/12806/situation-of-religious-circumcision-in-spain | title=Situation of religious circumcision in Spain }} < /ref >  They are generally considered an ethnically distinct peoples because of the two of the most important markers of distinctiveness: their own language and an awareness of a presumed common origin. Andalusian is said to be a distinct dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], according to the [[Andalusian nationalism]]. 
 The Andalusians have a rich culture which includes the famous [[flamenco]] style of music and dance, even though it was adopted by the Spanish [[Caló]] who have changed it and monopolized into their own culture.
