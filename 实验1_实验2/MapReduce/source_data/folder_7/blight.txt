 '''Blight''' refers to way [[plants]] [[wikt:wither|wither]] when [[infection|infected]]. It is usually caused by [[Fungus|fungi]], or [[Virus|viruses]], or sometimes by [[bacteria]]. 
 
 Blight is a rapid and complete chlorosis, < ref > yellowing due to loss of [[chlorophyll]] < /ref >  browning, then death of plant [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s such as leaves, branches, twigs, or flowers. < ref > Agrios, George N. 2005 ''Plant pathology''. 5th ed, Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic Press. < /ref >  Various diseases which cause the [[symptom]] are known as '''blights'''. Several notable examples are: 
 
 * [[Phytophthora infestans|Late blight of potato]], caused by the water [[mould]] ''Phytophthora infestans'', the disease which led to the [[Irish potato famine]] 
 * Southern [[corn]] leaf blight, caused by the [[fungus]] ''Cochliobolus heterostrophus''. This caused a severe loss of corn in the United States in 1970. < ref > Partridge J.E. ''Southern Corn Leaf Blight''. 2003. 8 August 2006. http://nu-distance.unl.edu/homer/disease/agron/corn/CoSCLB.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723184952/http://nu-distance.unl.edu/homer/disease/agron/corn/CoSCLB.html |date=2010-07-23 }} < /ref > 
 * [[Chestnut]] blight, caused by the fungus ''Cryphonectria parasitica'' has nearly eradicated mature [[American chestnut]]s in North America. 
 * Bacterial leaf blight of [[rice]] is caused by the bacterium ''Xanthomonas oryzae''. < ref > Oda M. Sekizawa Y. and Watanabe T. 1966. Phenazines as disinfectants against bacterial leaf blight of the rice plant. ''Applied Microbiology'' '''14'''(3):365-367. < /ref > 
 * Early blight of potato and tomato, caused by species of the common fungal genus ''Alternaria''. 
 * Leaf blight of grasses. On leaf tissue, symptoms of '''blight''' are the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue.
