 '''Mannerism''' is a style of art that was created in the Late [[Renaissance]] period, from about 1520 until about 1600. The Mannerist style of [[painting]] or [[sculpture]] often shows figures that are  " elongated "  (made longer) and  " distorted "  (made into strange shapes " ). < ref name=White > Anthony White and Kay Sutton, ''Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists'', Harrap Books Ltd., (1990) {{ISBN|0245546928}} < /ref >  The aim of the Mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked  " elegant " . < ref name=Gardner/ > 
 
 The Mannerist style began in [[Italy]], where the artists were influenced by the figures that [[Michelangelo]] painted on the ceiling and in the  " Last Judgement "  in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. < ref name=Gardner > Helen Gardner, Gardner's Art through the Ages, (1970) Harcourt, Brace and World, {{ISBN|0155037528}} < /ref >  During the Renaissance, artists like [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] had tried very hard to learn from nature, and to paint things in a way that was very realistic. These two famous painters both died around 1520. Many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to  " express themselves " . They were not going to follow the rules of [[anatomy]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in the way that Leonardo and Raphael did. < ref name=Gardner/ >  Mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting, writhing or fighting. The faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness, fear, hatred or sexual feelings. 
 
 Not all the painters who were working during the Mannerist period painted in the Mannerist style. Many artists continued to work in the style of the High Renaissance. < ref name=White/ >  Painters in the Mannerist style were Tintoretto, Jacopo Pontormo, Agnolo Bronzino, Parmigianino and Rosso Fiorentino. Giambologna and Benvenuti Cellini were Mannerist sculptors. Giulio Romano was a Mannerist architect. < ref name=Wolf > Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', Harry N. Abrams, (1968) < /ref > 
 
 Mannerism spread from Italy to [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]. One of the most famous Mannerist painters was [[El Greco]] who worked in Spain. < ref name=Gardner/ >  Some other artists who worked in the Mannerist style are the French sculptor Jean Goujon, the Dutch painter Abraham Bloemaert and the German painter Bartolomeus Spranger. Possibly the strangest paintings from this time were by Giuseppe Arcimboldo who did pictures in which people's faces seem to be made from fruit, flowers, fire and even fish. < ref name=Wolf/ >
