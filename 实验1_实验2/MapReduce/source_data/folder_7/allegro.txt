'''Allegro''' is a tempo marking for [[classical music]]. It says that the music is to be played moderately fast. At first, it was also used to describe the character of a piece, but since the 18th century, it is mainly used for the speed. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/allegro-definition-2701489|title=The Musical Term Allegro|last=Kraemer|first=Brandy|date=2019-05-24|website=LiveAbout|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}} < /ref >  It is faster than [[Andante]], but slower than [[Presto]]. Sometimes, the term is translated: Composers such as [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] used the word ''vite'', [[Gustav Mahler]] wrote Rasch, and [[Benjamin Britten]] wrote ''Quickly''. Most people say that piece that is played allegro should generally be played at speeds of between 120 and 168 beats per minute.
