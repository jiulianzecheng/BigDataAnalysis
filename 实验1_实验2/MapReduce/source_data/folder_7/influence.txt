 The adjective '''influential''' means  " having much influence " , so influential people or things have the power to change other people or things in some way. This word is often used to describe [[celebrity|famous]] people. For example, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was a very influential person, because the things he did and said changed many peoples lives, and many people believe he has even influenced the [[world]]. [[King]] < nowiki/ > s, [[clergy]] and [[Celebrity|celebrities]] are also among the influential, as people pay attention to what they say or do. 
 
 Events can also influence. For example, [[World War II]] changed many people's lives. They died or became richer or poorer or went to a new place, even after the war ended. When [[printing]] became common, it influenced developments in science, politics, religion, and other human activities.
