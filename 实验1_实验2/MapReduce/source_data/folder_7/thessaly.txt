'''Thessaly''' is a traditional [[geographic]] and modern administrative region of [[Greece]]. It is most of the ancient region of Thessaly. It is in the central part of Greece. 
 
 Thessaly was known as Aeolia, and appears so in [[Homer's Odyssey]]. Thessaly became part of the modern Greek state in 1881, after four and a half centuries of [[Ottoman]] rule. Since 1987 it has been one of the country's 13 regions. It is sub-divided into five regional units and 25 [[municipalities]]. The capital of the region is [[Laris]].
