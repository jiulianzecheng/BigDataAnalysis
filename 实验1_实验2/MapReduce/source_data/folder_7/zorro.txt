 In the stories, his real name is Don Diego De La Vega who fights for the people against the corrupt tyranny of Govenor Montero where he proves to be much too foxlike and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 The first Zorro story was a 1919 novel, ''The Curse of Capistrano'', by Johnston McCulley.  He soon becomes a regular character in [[pulp fiction]] magazines.  McCulley was inspired by the story of the real bandit [[Salomon Pico]] and other real Mexican bandits who robbed Americans after the [[Mexican-American War]].  However, because his readers were Americans, McCulley had his Zorro fighting Spanish people instead of Americans. < ref name=SB / >
