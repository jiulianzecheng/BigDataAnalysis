 '''Birefringence''' (or '''double refraction''') happens when [[light]] is passed through a special material and it splits into two different [[ray]]s of light. [[Calcite]] [[crystal|crystals]] and [[boron]] [[nitride]] are two good examples of materials that cause birefringence. Just as a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] splits light into a large number of colors, birefringence splits light into two images of the same color. You see this as a  " double image " .
