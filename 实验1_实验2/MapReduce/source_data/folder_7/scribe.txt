 A '''scribe''' is an ancient occupation. A scribe's job involved [[reading]] and [[writing]], especially during the [[Renaissance]].  Being a scribe meant writing letters, and historical records for  [[monarch|kings]], [[nobility]], and [[temples#religion|temples]].  It was an important job when few people could read and write. Later, it changed into being [[Secretary|secretaries]], [[clerk]]s: [[servant|public servants]], [[journalist]]s, [[accountant]]s and [[lawyer]]s. Today, there are no scribes, but there are still [[author]]s and [[writer]]s. 
 
 ==Egyptian scribes== 
 The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian scribe was an important job. Ancient Egypt also had its painters and artisans who decorated [[tomb]]s, buildings, furniture, [[statue]]s, and other relics with pictures and [[hieroglyphics]]. In Ancient Egypt, only males could be scribes. This was so in many civilisations, because most official positions were exclusively male.

 The scribes had to be able to write not only the hieroglyphs, but also the hieratic (priestly) script, and they had to know [[arithmetic]]. They used a type of paper called [[papyrus]], made from [[reed (plant)|reeds]], and wrote with reed [[pen]]s and [[ink]].
