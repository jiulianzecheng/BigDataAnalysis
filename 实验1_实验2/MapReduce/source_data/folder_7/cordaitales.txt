 '''Cordaitales''' are an extinct order of woody plants. They are [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]] which may have been early [[conifer]]s. < ref > Eckenwalder, James E. 2009. ''Conifers of the World: the complete reference''. Portland: Timber Press. < /ref >    
 
 They had cone-like reproductive structures rather like those of modern conifers. The Cordaitales appeared during the [[Carboniferous]] period. They made big trees which were common on drier ground in [[tropical]] environments.  
 
 Also, some tall trees and some shrubby [[mangrove]]-like species of Cordaitales seem to have grown in the [[Carboniferous]] [[coal]] [[swamp]]s. Cordaitales were also abundant during the [[Permian]], but died out at the end of the Permian.  
 
 Many Cordiatales had elongated strap-like leaves, which look like the leaves of some modern-day conifers of the [[Araucariaceae]] and [[Podocarpaceae]].
