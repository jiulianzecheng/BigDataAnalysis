 The island is democratic, with its own elections and a representative seat of government in Nuuk. It is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], a constitutional monarchy with [[Queen Margrethe II]] as head of state. Greenland has two members in Denmark's [[Folketing]].

 == History == 
 Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples. They came from what is now [[Canada]]. < ref name= " natmus " > {{cite web |title=Saqqaq-kulturen kronologi |url=http://natmus.dk/forsknings-og-formidlingsafdelingen/etnografisk-samling/sila-arctic-centre/prehistory-of-greenland/saqqaq/ |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=2 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207035806/http://natmus.dk/forsknings-og-formidlingsafdelingen/etnografisk-samling/sila-arctic-centre/prehistory-of-greenland/saqqaq/ |archive-date=7 December 2013 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|vauthors=Saillard J, Forster P, Lynnerup N, Bandelt HJ, Nørby S |year=2000|title= mtDNA variation among Greenland Eskimos: the edge of the Beringian expansion|journal= American Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 67|issue=3|pages= 718–26|pmid= 10924403|doi= 10.1086/303038|pmc=1287530}} < /ref >  [[Vikings|Norsemen]] settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled [[Iceland]]. 
 
 Norsemen would later set sail from Greenland and Iceland with [[Leif Erikson]]. They were the first known Europeans to reach North America. They did so nearly 500 years before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] reached the [[Caribbean]] islands. [[Inuit]] peoples arrived in Greenland in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of [[Norway]] and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. Their colonies declined after the [[Black Death]] in the late 1400s. Denmark–Norway, joined in alliance at the time, reclaimed sovereignty over the island in the 17th century. Greenland became Danish in 1814. < ref > Sowa F. 2014. Greenland. In: Hund A.

 == Languages == 
 The island is populated mostly by [[Inuit]] and [[Scandinavia]]ns who speak [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], an Eskimo-Aleut language. [[Danish language|Danish]] is also spoken by most people. The national anthem of Greenland is [[Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit]].
