 The '''stinkhorns''' are a [[family (biology)|family]] of fungi, the  '''Phallaceae'''. Belonging to the fungal order [[Phallales]], the Phallaceae have a worldwide distribution, but are especially common in [[tropical]] regions. Their [[mushrooms]] are foul-smelling, sticky [[spore]] masses, or [[gleba]], on the end of a stalk. 
 
 Their mushroom distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass smells of [[carrion]] or [[feces|dung]], and attracts [[fly|flies]] and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although a great diversity of body structure shape exists between the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as  " eggs " . According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species. < ref name=Kirk2008 > Kirk P.M. ''et al'' 2008.
