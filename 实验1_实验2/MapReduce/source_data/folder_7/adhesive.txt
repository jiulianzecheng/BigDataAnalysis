An '''adhesive''' is a compound that sticks or bonds two items together. Adhesives may come from either natural or man-made material.  Some modern adhesives are extremely strong, and are becoming increasingly important in modern construction and industry. Examples of adhesives include [[adhesive tape]], glue, and sticky-tac.  Some adhesives are for temporary use, like sticky-tac or the adhesive on sticky notes.  Others are for more permanent bonding of small items like gluing paper or building large pieces of furniture using construction adhesive. 
 
 == History == 
 The first adhesives were natural [[natural gum|gums]] and other plant [[resin]]s.  Archaeologists have found 6000-year-old [[ceramic]] vessels that had broken and been repaired using plant resin.  
 
 The earliest known use of adhesives was discovered in central [[Italy]] when two stone flakes partially covered with [[birch]]-[[bark]] [[tar]]. This is thought to be the oldest discovered human use of adhesives. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Mazza|first1=Paul Peter Anthony|last2=Martini|first2=Fabio|last3=Sala|first3=Benedetto|last4=Magi|first4=Maurizio|last5=Colombini|first5=Maria Perla|last6=Giachi|first6=Gianna|last7=Landucci|first7=Francesco|last8=Lemorini|first8=Cristina|last9=Modugno|first9=Francesca|date=2006|title=A new Palaeolithic discovery: tar-hafted stone tools in a European Mid-Pleistocene bone-bearing bed|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305440306000197|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1310–1318|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.01.006|via=}} < /ref >   
 
 In [[Europe]], glue was not used until the 1500–1700s. At this time, [[Cabinet making|cabinet]] and [[furniture]] makers such as Thomas Chippendale and Duncan Phyfe started to use adhesives to hold their products together. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755779919|title=Handbook of adhesives and surface preparation : technology, applications and manufacturing|date=2011|publisher=William Andrew/Elsevier|others=Ebnesajjad, Sina.|isbn=978-1-4377-4462-0|location=Amsterdam|oclc=755779919}} < /ref >  In 1690, the first commercial glue plant was established in The [[Netherlands]].

 In 1920s–1940s, there was great advances in the development and production of new [[plastics]] and resins because of the [[First World's War|First]] and [[Second world war|Second World Wars]]. 
 
 == Types == 
 {{Main|List of glues}} 
 Adhesives are usually classified by the method of adhesion. These are then classified into reactive and non-reactive adhesives, which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden. They can also be classified by whether it is made from natural, or synthetic [[material]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|title=MIL-HDBK-691B Department of Defense - Military Standardization Handbook - Adhesive Bonding|url=https://roofonline.com/mil-hdbk-691b-department-of-defense-military-standardization-handbook-adhesive-bonding|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Roof Online|language=en-us}} < /ref > 
 
 ===By reactiveness=== 
 ====Non-reactive==== 
 =====Drying===== 
 There are two types of adhesives that harden by drying. They are solvent-based adhesives and polymer dispersion adhesives. They are also known as emulsion adhesives. Solvent-based adhesives are a [[mixture]] of [[Ingredient|ingredients]] (usually polymers) dissolved in a [[solvent]]. [[Polyvinyl acetate|White glue]], contact adhesives and [[Rubber cement|rubber cements]] are drying adhesives. As the solvent [[Evaporate|evaporates]], the adhesive hardens. 
 
 A polymer based adhesive is a milky white coloured mixture that is based on polyvinyl acetate (PVA). They are used in the [[woodworking]] and [[packaging]] industries. They are also used with [[Fabric|fabrics]] and in engineered products such as [[Loudspeaker|loudspeakers]]. 
 
 ===== Pressure sensitive ===== 
 {{Main|Pressure-sensitive adhesive}} 
 ''Pressure-sensitive adhesives'' (PSA) stick to materials when pressure is applied. The [[bond]] forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow to the adherend. The bond is very strong because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow. 
 
 PSAs are made for either permanent or removable applications. Examples of permanent applications include safety [[label]] for power equipment, foil [[tape]] for [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|HVAC]] duct work. 
 
 Removable adhesives are made to form a temporary bond, and can be removed after months or years without leaving residue on the adherend. Removable adhesives are used in applications such as surface protection films, [[Masking tape|masking tapes]], [[bookmark]] and note [[Paper|papers]], [[barcode]] labels and price marking labels. 
 
 =====Contact===== 
 {{Main|Contact adhesives}} 
 Contact adhesives are used in strong bonds with high [[Shear stress|shear-resistance]] like laminates, such as bonding [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] to a wooden counter, and in [[footwear]]. Natural rubber and polychloroprene ([[Neoprene]]) are commonly used as contact adhesives. 
 
 Contact adhesives must be applied to both surfaces. It must be allowed some time to dry. Once the surfaces are pushed together, the bond forms very quickly. < ref > {{Cite web|title=This to That|url=http://www.thistothat.com/glue/contact.shtml|access-date=2020-11-29|website=www.thistothat.com}} < /ref > 
 
 =====Hot===== 
 {{Main|Hot-melt adhesives}} 
 Hot adhesives, are thermoplastics applied in melted form which turns into a solid when it cools to form strong bonds between. Ethylene-vinyl acetate-based hot-melts are mainly used for crafts. 
 
 ==== Reactive ==== 
 
 ===== Anaerobic ===== 
 Anaerobic adhesives hardens when in comes in contact with [[metal]], in the absence of [[oxygen]]. 
 
 ===== Multi-part ===== 
 
 
 ''Multi-component adhesives'' harden by mixing two or more chemical which react together. 
 
 There are several commercial combinations of multi-component adhesives in use in industry. Some of these combinations are: 
 
 * [[Polyester]] resin – [[polyurethane]] resin 
 * [[Polyol|Polyols]] – polyurethane resin 
 * Acrylic polymers – polyurethane resins
