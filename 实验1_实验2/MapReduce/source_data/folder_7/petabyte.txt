A '''petabyte''' ('''PB''') is a [[unit of measurement]] in [[computer]]s and similar [[electronic]] [[device]]s. One petabyte holds 1000 [[terabyte]]s ('''TB''') or 1,000,000,000,000,000 [[byte]]s.  
 
 Large organizations use petabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data. To store this amount of data at home would require about 1000 large home computers.  People at home probably do not use petabytes, they would use [[terabyte]]s (primarily for very large backups), [[gigabyte]]s, [[megabyte]]s and occasionally [[kilobyte]]s. 
 
 One thousand petabytes make one [[exabyte]]. 
 
 There is also already petabyte supercomputers such as Frontier and Summit.
