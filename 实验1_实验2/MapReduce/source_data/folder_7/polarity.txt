In [[physics]], '''polarity''' describes an [[attribute]] that can usually have two values: 
 * An [[electricity|electric charge]] has a polarity of either positive or negative. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/polarity-chemistry|title = Polarity  & #124; Definition  &  Examples  & #124; Britannica}} < /ref > 
 * A [[voltage]] has a polarity, in that it could be positive or negative (with respect to some other voltage, such as the one at the other end of a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[electric circuit]]). 
 * A [[magnet]] has a polarity, in that one end is the  " north "  and the other is the  " south " . 
 * The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of an entity in [[quantum mechanics]] has a polarity - positive or negative. 
 * [[Polarized light]] has waves which all line up in the same direction. 
 
 [[Chemical polarity]] is a feature of [[chemical bond]]s, where two different [[atom]]s in the same [[molecule]] have different [[electronegativity]].  As a result, the electrons in the bond are not shared equally by the two atoms. This causes an asymmetrical (polar) electric field.  Molecular [[covalent bond]]s can be described as polar or nonpolar. Entire molecules can also be described as polar.
