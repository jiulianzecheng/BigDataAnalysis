 '''Mysticism''' is the belief that people can ''directly'' experience [[God]] or true [[reality]], rather than through books, ritual or other people. People who practice this are called ''mystics''. 
 
 Mystics exist within most [[religion]]s, though not all people who practice religions are mystics. Mystics may experience [[vision]]s or [[dream]]s, or hear God as a voice.
