 '''Golant''' is a small [[village]] in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is in the [[parish]] of [[St Sampson]] on the [[shore|banks]] of the [[Fowey estuary]] and between [[St. Austell]] and [[Polperro]]. The [[church]] in the villiage is dedicated to [[Saint Sampson|St. Sampson]].

 == History == 
 Until very recently, Golant has been almost unknown except to the people who live there and [[pilgrim]]s and other walkers of the [[Saints' Way]]. Nearby, there is a little used [[ford]] across the Fowey estuary. In late summer 1644, during the first [[English Civil War]], [[war]] came to Golant and the area around the village. A large group of about 10,000 [[Parliament of England|Parliamentary]] [[soldier]]s  fought against the forces of [[List of English monarchs|King]] [[Charles I of England|Charles]] on the [[peninsula]] between [[Lostwithiel]], [[St Blazey]] and [[Fowey]]. King Charles was in the area at the time.
