 '''Planthoppers''' are [[insect]]s in the [[infraorder]] '''Fulgoromorpha'''. They are true bugs ([[Hemiptera]]), with over 12,500 described species.  
 
 They are [[cryptic]] [[mimicry|mimics]]: their body shape and colours look like leaves and other plant parts in their environment. They either walk very slowly or hop like [[grasshopper]]s.  
 
 Members of this group are plant-feeders, and live world-wide. Few are pests, but some are [[vector (biology)|vectors]] for plant diseases. [[Phytoplasma]]s which live in the [[phloem]] of plants can be transmitted by planthoppers when feeding. < ref > Lee ''et al'' 2000. Phytoplasmas: phytopathogenic mollicutes.

 Their nymphs have a biological gear mechanism at the base of the hind legs, which keeps the legs in synchrony when the insects jump. < ref > Burrows M.  &   Sutton G. 2013.

 The planthopper is mentioned in a key scene from [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Marnie]]'': < ref > Tony Lee Moral (2002).

 : " In Kenya, there is quite a beautiful flower â€“ rather like a hyacinth. If you should reach out to touch it, you would discover that the flower is not a flower at all, but a design made up of hundreds of tiny insects called flatid bugs. They escape the eyes of hungry birds by living and dying in the shape of a flower " .
