 }}'''Pfarrwiese''' was a stadium in [[Vienna]], Austria. It was the home ground of [[SK Rapid Wien]] from 1912 till 1978. < ref name= " Geschichtewiki Wien German " > [https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Pfarrwiese Geschichtewiki Wien (German)] < /ref > 
 ==History== 
 After the loan for the Sportplatz Rudolfsheim was quited SK Rapid went to Hütteldorf where they built a new home. < ref > [https://www.rapidarchiv.at/spezial/stadion.html Rapid Archiv (German)] < /ref >  The place was owned by the St Peter's Abbey in Salzburg and managed by the parish of Hütteldorf. This is the reason why the ground was called  " Pfarrwiese " . The loan was  800 Kronen/Year (which is approximately 4.300 €). Also two tickets for each match were part of the contract. 
 
 The ground was built between August 1911 and April 1912.  Architect was Eduard Schönecker, who also planed the [[Hohe Warte Stadium]]. 
 The capacity was 4 000 and  was step by step expanded to 8000. The pitch was borderd with a cinder track. The place was opened on  28 April 1912 with two matches in front of 3000 visitors. Rapid played versus [[Wiener AC|WAC]] and won 2-1. The main match was  [[FK Austria Wien|Amateure]] versus [[Vienna Cricket and Football-Club|Cricketer]]. 
 
 The club decided to built a stadium because Rapid became very sucessful and the old place was therefore to small. In June 1919 15 000 people where at the Pfarrwiese to see the match versus [[MTK Budapest FC|MTK Budapest]]. The new stadium was also planed by Eduard Schönecker. It had a capacity of 24. 150. If a lot of people were expected Rapid went often to the [[Prater Stadion|Praterstadion]].  The demages in the Second World War were small so the first match on the Pfarrwiese was held on 1 May 1945. A combined team of SK Rapid and [[First Vienna FC|Vienna]] played versus a team of the Red Army. The last modifications were made in 1955. In 1977 the [[Gerhard-Hanappi-stadium|Weststadion]] was built and Rapid left the Pfarrwiese. In 1986  a tennis facility was built. < ref > [https://brucki.blogspot.com/2012/12/lost-ground-pfarrwiese-wien-hutteldorf.html Brucki.blogspot.com] < /ref >
