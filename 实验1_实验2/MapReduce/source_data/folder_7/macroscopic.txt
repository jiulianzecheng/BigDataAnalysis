'''Macroscopic''' means [[physics|physical]] objects that are [[measurement|measurable]] and can be seen by the [[naked eye]]. 
 
 When one uses macroscopic for abstract objects, one thinks of the world as we see it without any help. Lengths scales are called macroscopic if they fall in the range of more or less than 1 [[millimeter|mm]] or up to 1 [[kilometer|km]]. 
 
 One may use the term ''macroscopic'' also for a  " larger view " , namely a view only available from a large perspective. A macroscopic position could be considered the  " big picture " . 
 
 == Examples == 
 
 * A macroscopic view of a [[ball]] is just that: a ball. A microscopic view could reveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of [[crack]]s and fissures (as viewed through a [[microscope]]) or, further down in scale, a collection of [[molecule]]s in the rough shape of a [[sphere]]. 
 
 == Macroscopy in physics == 
 
 In physics macroscopy is a relative term. If one looks at a [[galaxy]], a [[star]] is microscopic in comparison with the whole galaxy, even if it is many, many [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] larger than us. macroscopy can also be described as a relation between any two objects in terms of its magnification on a scale of some sort. A macroscopic object is something that we are able to see in plain [[sight]] through our own field of vision no [[matter]] where we are located. In [[Space-time|spacetime]] light must also come into contact with our eyes and the object we are observing in order for it to be visible.
