 '''Weaving''' is the interlacing of two sets of [[thread]]s at right angles to each other to form [[cloth]]. Weaving is usually done on a [[loom]]. 
 
 One set of threads is called the ''warp''. These threads are held taut and in [[parallel]] order on the loom by ''harnesses'' creating a space called the ''shed''. The ''weft'' thread is wound onto ''bobbins''. In old-fashioned hand weaving the bobbins are held in a ''[[shuttle]]'', which carries the weft thread through the shed. The warp threads are moved over and under the weft threads. Modern high speed weaving does not use a shuttle.
