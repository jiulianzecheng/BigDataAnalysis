'''Popularity''' is the state of being well-liked or well-known. People, things, and ideas can be popular. Popularity [[wikt:figure|figure]]s are an important part of many people's personal [[value system]]s, and forms a critical part of success in fields such as [[management]], [[politics]], and the entertainment industry, among others. 
 
 Many different varieties of popularity exist, and many ways in which to gain it. General popularity usually involves [[wikt:simple|respect]] in two ways: a popular person is respected by [[peer group|groups of people]] and will take that respect. This reinforces the idea that the person deserves the popularity. Likewise, [[wikt:amicable|amicability]] ([[wikt:friendly|friendliness]]) is an important part of popularity, as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others. This inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people (particularly the young) who are attempting to become popular: being [[wikt:simple|loud]] may be successful in gaining [[wikt:simple|attention]], but is unlikely to provide mutual respect.
