'''Ataxia''' is trouble with [[balance]] that is not caused by a person's [[muscle]]s being weak.  Instead, ataxia is caused by a [[neurology|neurological]] problem. < ref name=faq/ > 
 
 Ataxia is not a [[diagnosis]].  It is a neurological [[Signs and symptoms|sign]].  It is a sign of damage to the parts of the [[nervous system]] that control balance. < ref name=faq/ > 
 
 There are three different types of ataxia.  Each type has many possible causes. 
 
 ==Types== 
 
 ===Cerebellar ataxia=== 
 Cerebellar ataxia is ataxia that is caused by a problem with a person's [[cerebellum]].  The cerebellum is the part of the [[brain]] that controls balance and coordination.  It makes the body move smoothly and controls movements like walking. < ref name= " Schmahmann " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Schmahmann JD | title = Disorders of the cerebellum: ataxia, dysmetria of thought, and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-neuropsychiatry-and-clinical-neurosciences_summer-2004_16_3/page/367 | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–78 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15377747 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.16.3.367 }} < /ref >

 * Controlling how hard their muscles contract, how fast, and in what direction 
 * Getting their muscles to work together ([[asynergy]]) 
 * Walking (gait abnormality) 
 * Moving their [[eye]]s 
 * [[Swallowing]] ([[dysphagia]]) 
 * Saying words ([[dysarthria]]) 
 * Judging how far away something is ([[dysmetria]]) 
 * Reacting quickly 
 
 ===Sensory ataxia=== 
 [[Senses|Sensory]] ataxia is caused by the loss of [[proprioception]] (knowing where parts of the body are).  It is usually caused by damage to the parts of the [[spinal cord]] that carry information about proprioception to the brain.  However, it can also be caused by damage to the parts of the brain that receive that information (the cerebellum, the [[thalamus]], and the [[parietal lobe]]s of the brain). < ref name=faq > {{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About... Ataxia |url=http://www.ataxia.org/pdf/AtaxiaFAQ.pdf |publisher=National Ataxia Foundation |access-date=September 18, 2016 |archive-date=April 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408144825/http://www.ataxia.org/pdf/ataxiafaq.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 A person with sensory ataxia may have these [[symptom]]s: 
 * They may have trouble walking.  They may stomp their feet and hit their heels hard against the ground while they walk 
 * Trouble walking that gets worse when the person cannot see well 
 ** For example, if the person stands with their feet together and their eyes closed, their balance problems will get much worse, and they may fall.  [[Physician|Doctors]] call this a  " positive [[Romberg's test]]. 
 
 ===Vestibular ataxia=== 
 Vestibular ataxia is caused by problems with the [[vestibular system]].  This is the body's main sensory system that controls balance and movement.  It includes the inner [[ear]]. < ref name=causes/ > 
 
 Along with balance problems, people with vestibular ataxia may have: 
 * [[Nausea]] and [[vomit]]ing 
 * [[Vertigo|Dizziness]] 
 
 == Causes == 
 There are many different causes of ataxia.  The National Ataxia Foundation breaks up these causes into three categories: acquired, genetic, and idiopathic. < ref name=causes > {{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions About... Ataxia Classification |url=http://www.ataxia.org/pdf/Ataxia_Classifications.pdf |publisher=National Ataxia Foundation |access-date=September 18, 2016 |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418212141/http://www.ataxia.org/pdf/Ataxia_Classifications.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === Acquired ataxia === 
 A person is not born with acquired ataxia.  ''Acquired'' means that something happened during the person's life to cause the ataxia. < ref name=causes/ > 
 
 Causes of acquired ataxia can include: < ref name=causes/ > 
 * [[Stroke]], [[brain tumor]], or [[multiple sclerosis]] 
 ** A person can acquire (get) any of the three types of ataxia from these problems in the brain, depending on where the problem happens.  For example, if a person has a brain tumor in their cerebellum, they may get cerebellar ataxia.  If the tumor is in the vestibular system, the person may get vestibular ataxia.

 === Genetic (hereditary) ataxia === 
 [[Genetics|Genetic]] ataxia is caused by [[Genetic disorder|hereditary disorders]] that damage the cerebellum or spine. < ref > {{cite book |vauthors=Pagon RA, Bird TD, Dolan CR, Stephens K, Adam MP, Bird TD |title=Hereditary Ataxia Overview (last revision 2012)|work=All GeneReview |year=1998 |pmid=20301317  |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1138/}} < /ref >   People are born with these disorders.  In most cases, they get worse over time. < ref name=causes/ > 
 
 === Idiopathic ataxia === 
 ''[[Idiopathic]]'' means that doctors cannot find a cause for a person's ataxia. 
 
 Idiopathic ataxias often cause symptoms that come and go.  Many doctors and scientists think these ataxias are caused by a combination of things inside the body (like [[gene]] problems) and things outside the body (like the things happening in a person's life).  However, they are still researching the causes of idiopathic ataxias. < ref name=causes/ > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 Ataxia can be treated.  However, treatment usually does not make ataxia go away completely.
