 '''Extinction''' is when a species of animal, plant, or other organisms are no longer living or [[Death|dies]]. Extinction is one of the major features of [[evolution]]. < ref > When talking about [[volcano]]s,  " [[Extinct volcano|extinct]] "  means that the volcano is no longer active. When talking about [[language]]s,  " [[Extinct language|extinct]] "  mans that it is no longer in use. < /ref > 
 
 All species become extinct sooner or later. The end of a species may happen for many reasons. It may be caused by [[habitat]] loss or by being [[hunted|overhunted]], or by a major [[extinction event]]. An example of an animal that is now extinct is the [[Dodo]], from over-hunting. Another quite different way for a species to end is by [[species-splitting]], known as [[cladogenesis]]. The species living today probably were not living in the [[Cambrian]] period, but their ancestors were. 
 
 Notable extinct animal species include the [[dinosaur|non-avian dinosaurs]], the [[saber-toothed cat]]s, the [[dodo]], the [[mammoth]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, the [[thylacine]], the [[trilobite]]s and the [[golden toad]]. 
 
 [[Endangered species]] are those which may become extinct. A report from [[Kew Gardens]] suggests that one fifth of plant species may be at risk of extinction. < ref > [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/10/one-in-five-of-worlds-plant-species-at-risk-of-extinction One in five of world's plant species at risk of extinction] 2016 May 10 The Guardian < /ref >  Fossil species sometimes reappear millions of years after they were thought to be extinct. These cases are called [[Lazarus taxa]]. [[Human|Humans]] are to blame due to cutting down animals’ natural habitat such as [[forest]]s. 
 
 ==Duration of species== 
 The average duration of species varies according to the groups studied. A study of benthic (deep water) [[foraminifera]] showed an average of 16 million years if they lived above 200 metres, but 25my if they lived below 200 metres. < ref > Bozas M.A.  &  Culver S.J. 1984. Species duration and evolution: benthic forms on the Atlantic continental margin of North America. ''Science'' '''225''', 829–230. < /ref >  On the other hand, the average survival time for [[mammal]]ian species over the past 20my has been 2.33my. < ref > K.J. Willis, E.S. Vrba and D. DeGusta 2004. Do species populations really start small? New perspectives from the Late Neogene fossil record of African mammals. ''Phil Trans Roy Soc'' '''B359''', 285–293.

Maud (eds) ''Cenozoic geology of southern Africa''. Oxford. pp 277–304 < /ref > 
 
 It is estimated that 99.9% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct. < ref name= " Newman " > Newman, Mark. 1994.  " [http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/newmme/science/extinction.html A mathematical model for mass extinction] " . [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved July 30, 2006. < /ref > < ref name= " Raup " >  Raup, David M. 1991. ''Extinction: bad genes or bad luck?'' W.W. Norton, New York. < /ref >  More than half of the plants and animals that have become extinct in the last 200 years have been in [[Australia]]. There the arrival of Europeans with (accidentally or deliberately) [[introduced species]] has damaged the native [[biota]]. Especially, the introduction of [[eutheria]]n mammals has caused the extinction of many [[marsupial]] forms. 
 
 ==Duration of higher groups== 
 {{Unsourced section|date=December 2020}} 
 Naturally, higher categories such as [[genera]], [[Family (biology)|families]], [[Order (biology)|orders]], [[Class (biology)|classes]] and [[Phylum|phyla]] last longer, because they are composed of more species. As far as we know, no phylum has gone completely extinct since the [[Cambrian]], but quite a few classes went extinct in one or other of the 'big five' [[List of extinction events|extinction events]]. Examples of higher categories of animal now extinct are: [[placoderm]] fish, [[trilobite]]s, [[ammonite]]s, [[pelycosaur]]s, non-[[avian]] [[dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s. 
 
 ==Reasons== 
 Darwin thought that most extinctions occurred because some organisms became more effective, and replaced their less advanced competitors. No doubt that does occur, but the view now is that environmental change is more important. [[Organism]]s become [[adaptation|adapted]] to the environments they live in. The [[environment]] certainly does change, and sometimes quite dramatically. When it does, some organisms can adapt to the changes. Others cannot. 
 
 The Earth's environment can stay rather stable for long periods of time. Then the rate of extinction is usually quite low. Then changes occur, sometimes quite rapidly. In these times the rate of extinction can be much higher. The rate of extinction is therefore a useful thing to measure. < ref > Lawton J. and May R. 1995.
