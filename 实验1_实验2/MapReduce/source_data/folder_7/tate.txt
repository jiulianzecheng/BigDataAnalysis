 The  '''Tate''' is the [[United Kingdom]]'s national [[museum]] of British and [[Modern art|Modern Art]]. It is a group of four art [[Art gallery|galleries]] in [[England]]:  
 *'''Tate Britain''' (opened in 1897 and renamed in 2000) 
 *[[Tate Liverpool]] (1988),  
 *[[Tate St Ives]] (1993)  
 *[[Tate Modern]] (2000).  
 There is a website, Tate Online (1998). It is  administered as a [[quango]] (a non-departmental public body).Tate is used as the name for the [[corporation]] which was started as The Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery. 
 
 The gallery was started in 1897, as the '''National Gallery of British Art'''. When its role was changed to include [[Modern Art]] it was renamed the '''Tate Gallery''' after [[Henry Tate]]. The Tate Gallery was first started in a building at [[Millbank]], [[London]] on the [[Embankment]]. In 2000, the Tate Gallery split its collection into four museums:  
 *'''Tate Britain''' (in the original building) displays the collection of [[British]] art from 1500 to the present day;  
 *[[Tate Modern]], also in London, houses the Tate's collection of British and International Modern and [[Contemporary art]] from 1900 to the present day.  
 *[[Tate Liverpool]], in [[Liverpool]] has the same purpose as [[Tate Modern]] but on a smaller scale, and  
 *[[Tate St Ives]] displays modern and contemporary art by artists who have a [[connection]] with the local area. All four museums share the Tate Collection.  
 
 One of the Tate's most publicised art events is the awarding of the annual [[Turner Prize]], which takes place at '''Tate Britain'''.
