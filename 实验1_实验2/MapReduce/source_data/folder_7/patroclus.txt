 '''Patroclus''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Πάτροκλος, Pátroklos -  " glory of the father " ) was a central figure in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the son of [[Menoetius]], and is most famous as being the lover of [[Achilles]]. 
 
 During the [[Trojan War]], Achilles refuses to fight after a quarrel with [[Agamemnon]],  leader of the Greek forces, over a woman, Briseis. Patroclus, with Achilles' permission, then dons Achilles' armor and leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle. The Greeks, thinking him to be Achilles, are roused into a frenzy as they begin to beat the Trojans back. He managed to kill [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]] when he charged into battle. However, the ruse is discovered as Patroclus is soon killed by the Trojan prince [[Hector (mythology)|Hector]]. The death of Patroclus is a key event in the ''[[Iliad]]'', as it serves as the catalyst of Achilles' legendary rage.
