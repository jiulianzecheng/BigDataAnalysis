 Sumbawa is inside the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. It is a [[volcano|volcanic]] island, including [[Mount Tambora]] (8°14’41”S, 117°59’35”E) which exploded in [[1815]], the most destructive volcanic eruption in modern history (roughly four times larger than the [[1883]] eruption of [[Krakatoa]], between [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], in terms of volume of magma ejected). The eruption killed as many as 92,000. It also apparently destroyed a small culture of [[Southeast Asia]]n affinity, known to archaeologists as the Tamboran kingdom.
