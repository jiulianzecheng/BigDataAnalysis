 ==History== 
 ''Takoyaki'' was [[wikt:invent|invented]] in [[Osaka]] in 1935 by Tomekichi Endo. < ref > JapanVisitor, [http://www.japanvisitor.com/index.php?cID=361 & pID=1168  " Takoyaki: Icon of Osaka " ]; retrieved 2012-3-6. < /ref >   It is most often made with [[flour]] and small pieces of boiled [[octopus]]. 
 
 == How to make Takoyaki == 
 *First, mix flour and egg with water to make [[dough]]. It is important the dough is not too thick but not too watery.  
 *Second, pour the dough into a ''takoyaki'' pan.  
 *Third, put a piece of cut, boiled octopus into each of the holes of the ''takoyaki'' pan. Also, put [[pickle]]d [[ginger]], and ''tenkasu'' (deep-fried flour dough).  
 *Fourth, turn the dough as it cooks to make a ball-shape.  
 *Finally, once cooked, put ''takoyaki'' sauce, ''katsuobushi'' (dried fish flakes), and ''aonori'' (green [[Seaweed|laver]]) on the balls. 
 
 ==Minor planet== 
 A minor planet named  " 6562 Takoyaki "  was discovered in 1991 by M. Yanai and K. Watanabe at Katani.  The name was selected by children who visited the Funai Space Festival which was held in Osaka in 2001. < ref name= " schmadel487 " > Schmadel, Lutz D. (2003).
