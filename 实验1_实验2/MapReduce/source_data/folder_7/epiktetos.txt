 '''Epiktetos''' was an ancient Greek [[pottery|potter]] and vase painter. His name means  " newly acquired " . He may have been a slave, as were most potters and painters in [[ancient Greece]]. He worked mostly with cups and plates between 520 and 490 BC in the red-figure style. He signed more than half his works. He was an expert with the ''tondo''{{mdash}}the circular picture at the bottom of a cup. He painted mostly everyday scenes rather than [[mythology|mythological]] ones. His end is unknown.
