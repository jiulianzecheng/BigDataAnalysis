 A '''referee''' is an official who watches a whole game of [[sports]] and makes all the decisions. The players of the sport being watched must always admit that the referee is always right, even if they aren't. Usually, if any player argues, they can get a yellow card or even sent off with a [[:en:Red_card|red card]]. Referees use a [[whistle]] so players and fans can hear when play needs to be stopped. Sometimes referees may have [[Assistant referee|Assistant referees]] to help them just in case they didn't see something or for [[Offside rule|offsides]] in [[Football (soccer)]]. 
 
 Referees usually wear clothing to separate them from the players. Most referees wear white and black shirts or an all black uniform.
