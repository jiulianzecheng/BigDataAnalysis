 '''''Mistletoe''''' is the common name for a group of semi-[[parasitic]] [[plant]]s in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Santalales]]. They grow attached by a [[haustorium]] to the branches of trees or shrubs. 
 It is not the name of any one plant: rather, it is a name given to plants which have a particular [[Growth habit|growth-habit]]. 
 
 The different mistletoes have white fruit (berries), and are parasitic on trees and shrubs. The name was invented in Europe, for local mistletoes. Similar parasitic plants are found in other parts of the world. 
 
 == Species == 
 The name was first given to ''[[Viscum album]]'' (European mistletoe, Santalaceae), the only species native in [[Great Britain]] and much of [[Europe]]. Later the name was given to other related species, including ''[[Phoradendron|Phoradendron serotinum]]'' (the eastern mistletoe of eastern [[North America]], also Santalaceae). 
 
 The largest family of mistletoes, Loranthaceae, has 73 genera and over 900 species. < ref > Judd W.S. ''et al'' 2002. ''Plant systematics: a phylogenetic approach''. Sunderland MA: Sinauer. {{ISBN|0-87893-403-0}} < /ref > 
 
 == In culture and myths == 
 European mistletoe played a large role in [[Greek mythology]], and is believed to be [[The Golden Bough]] of [[Aeneas]], ancestor of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. < ref > Virgil (19 BC) The Aeneid. < /ref >  The [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Baldr]] was killed with mistletoe. < ref > Gylfaginning, [http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/069072.php XLIX On-line text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184501/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/069072.php |date=2007-09-30 }} < /ref > 
 
 In Romanian traditions, mistletoe (''v√¢sc'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) is considered a source of good fortune. 
 
 [[William Shakespeare]] mentions it in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', Act II, Scene I:  " Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe " . 
 
 Mistletoe is often used as a [[Christmas]] [[beauty|decoration]]. ''Viscum album'' is used in [[Europe]] and ''[[Phoradendron]] serotinum'' is used in [[North America]]. According to [[custom]], the mistletoe must not touch the ground between its cutting and its removal as the last of Christmas greens at [[Candlemas]]; it may remain hanging through the year, often to [[preserve]] the house from lightning or fire, until it was replaced the following Christmas Eve. < ref > Mistletoe: the evolution of a Christmas tradition.

 Mistletoe (''[[Phoradendron]] flavescens'') is the state [[floral emblem]] for the State of [[Oklahoma]]. 
 
 === Kissing under mistletoe at Christmas  === 
 According to a custom during Christmas, any two people who meet under a hanging of mistletoe are urged to [[kiss]]. The custom started in [[Scandinavia]]. < ref > Brewer, E. Cobham  1898. ''Dictionary of phrase and fable''.  " Kissing under the mistletoe "  relates the custom to the death of Balder, without authority. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.worldofchristmas.net/christmas-mistletoe/history.html The WorldofChristmas.net] < /ref >
