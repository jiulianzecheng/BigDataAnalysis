 '''Brooklyn''' is one of the five [[borough]]s of [[New York City]]. It also covers the same area as '''Kings County'''. Brooklyn is New York City's second largest borough in land area (after [[Queens]]).  
 As of 2020, about 2.7 million people live there. This is more than in any of the other four boroughs. 
 
 Brooklyn is the west end of [[Long Island]].  The [[East River]] separates it from [[Manhattan]] in the north. Brooklyn's only land boundary is with [[Queens]] in the east.  Jamaica Bay separates Brooklyn from Rockaway in the south.  The Narrows separates Brooklyn from [[Staten Island]] in the west.  
 
 [[Coney Island]] is the south end of Brooklyn.  The [[Brooklyn Museum]] is near the middle of Brooklyn, near [[Prospect Park]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called  " Breukelen " . Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the [[Lenape]]. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of [[New Netherland]]. 
 
 During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there [[Plebiscite|voted]] to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one [[culture]] or [[ethnicity]]. Other parts are mixed. 
 
 The [[Brooklyn Bridge]] is old and famous. It goes over the [[East River]] and connects Downtown Brooklyn to [[Lower Manhattan]]. The longest bridge in New York, the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to [[Staten Island]].
