 '''''Triodia''''' is a large [[genus]] of [[grass]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to Australia. They are often called '''spinifex''', but they are not a part of the genus ''[[Spinifex (genus)|Spinifex]]'', which is only found near the coast. There are 64 known species. < ref > Lazarides, 1997 < /ref >  Triodia is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] grass that grows in dry areas. They have spikey, pointed leaves, about 30-40 centimetres long. 
 
 The leaf tips can break off in people's [[skin]], causing [[infection]]s. Spinifex has been used by [[Australian Aborigines]] in many things. The seeds are collected for [[Bushfood|food]]. [[Spinifex resin]] is used as a glue in [[spear]]-making. The grasses were also burned to make [[smoke signal]]s, to communicate with groups a long way away. Some species are used for building shelters. Others are used to make [[trap]]s for catching fish. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Wanggalili; Yinjibarndi and Ngarluma Plants|author=Burndud|publisher= Juluwarlu Aboriginal Corporation |year=1990|page = 17}} < /ref >
