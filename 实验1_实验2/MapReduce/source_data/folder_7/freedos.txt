 '''FreeDOS''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] operating system. It is made to work just like [[MS-DOS]]. Almost all programs that will run on MS-DOS will run on FreeDOS too. It was created because [[Microsoft]] did not want to make MS-DOS anymore. FreeDOS can be installed with a [[floppy]] or with a [[Compact disc|CD]].
