 '''''Casuarina''''' is a [[genus]] of 17 tree species in the family Casuarinaceae. They are native to [[Australia]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[southeast Asia]], islands of the western [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[eastern Africa]]. 
 
 This was once the only [[genus]] in the family, but it is now split into four genera. 
 
 They are [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s growing to {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.  
 
 The [[flower]]s have no petals. They are in small [[catkin]]-like [[inflorescence]]s. Most species are [[dioecious]], but a few are [[monoecious]].  
 
 The [[fruit]] is a woody, oval structure. It looks a bit like a [[conifer cone]]. It has many [[Gynoecium|carpels]], each with a single [[seed]] and a small wing. < ref name= " foao " > {{cite web |last1=Wilson |first1=K.L. |last2=Johnson |first2=L.A.S. |title=Flora of Australia online: Casuarinaceae |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/online-resources/flora/stddisplay.xsql?pnid=38582 |date=1989 |publisher=ABRS, Commonwealth of Australia |access-date=3 November 2018 |archive-date=30 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230003529/http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/online-resources/flora/stddisplay.xsql?pnid=38582 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " rhs " > {{cite book |editor=Huxley A. |year=1992 |title= New RHS Dictionary of Gardening |publisher= Macmillan |isbn= 0-333-47494-5}} < /ref >
