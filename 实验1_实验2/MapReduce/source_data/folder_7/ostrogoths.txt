 The '''Ostrogoths''' were the eastern branch of the later [[Goths]]. The other major branch was the [[Visigoths]]. 
 
 The Ostrogoths started with the [[Greutungi]], a branch of the Goths that moved southward from the [[Baltic Sea]] during the 3rd and the 4th centuries. 
 
 They built an empire that stretched from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]] and traded with the [[Roman Empire]]. Its peak was under King [[Ermanaric]]. 
 
 After the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Ostrogoths built a new kingdom in northern [[Italy]] centred in [[Ravenna]].
