 A '''hominid''' is any member of the biological family '''[[Hominidae]]'''. These are the  " great apes " , living and [[extinct]]. At present there are [[human]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orangutan]]s. 
 
 The word  " hominid "  has been used in various ways. The classification of the great apes [[Ape#History of hominoid taxonomy|has been revised]] several times in the last few decades. These revisions led to different uses of the word  " hominid " . The original meaning of the [[taxon]] Hominidae meant only humans and their closest relatives. Now this group is called the [[Hominina]]. 
 
 The [[primatology|primatological]] term '''hominid''' is easily confused with a number of similar words: 
 * A '''hominoid''' or [[ape]] is a member of the superfamily ''[[Hominoidea]]'': existing members are the [[lesser ape]]s ([[gibbon]]s) and [[great ape]]s. 
 * A '''hominid''' is a member of the family ''[[Hominidae]]'': all of the great apes. 
 * A '''hominine''' is a member of the subfamily ''[[Homininae]]'': gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans (excludes orangutans). 
 * A '''hominin''' is a member of the tribe ''[[Hominini]]'': including chimpanzees and humans. 
 * A '''hominan''' is a little used term for a sub-tribe. 
 * A '''human''' is a member of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The word is sometimes also used to refer to any extinct member of the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' or members from other hominan genera. 
 * A '''[[humanoid]]''' is a vaguely human-shaped entity; the term is typically used in [[science fiction]]. 
 
 The dispute is really about whether humans and [[Australopithecine]]s are sufficiently different from chimpanzees to rank as a separate family. In [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[life style]] they are, in [[genetics]] they are not. 
 
 A move from [[rainforest]] to [[savannah]] and [[woodland]] led first to [[bipedalism]] (walking on two feet). Later, hunting and social needs led to larger [[brain]]s and the making and use of tools. These differences between human beings and the other great apes are certainly important. However, a genetically based [[taxonomy|taxonomic classification]] shows the genetic differences are not enough to divide us into separate families. [[Genetics]], rather than morphology, is generally more widely accepted as the critical standard. However, many scientists, including [[anthropologist]]s, use the term  " hominid "  to mean humans and their direct and near-direct ancestors.
