 '''Halophiles''' are [[organism]]s that need salt in their [[environment]] to live. Halophiles live in [[evaporation]] ponds or [[salt lake]]s such as [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Owens Lake]], or [[Dead Sea]]. < ref name=Gimlour > {{harvnb|Gilmour|Sephton|2004|p=78}} < /ref >  The name  " halophile "  comes from Greek for  " salt-loving " . < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |last1=Gordh |first1=George |last2=Gordh |first2=Gordon |last3=Headrick |first3=David |year=2003 |publisher=CABI Publishing |isbn=0851996558 |page=425 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0XSwMJLDg4C |accessdate=5 December 2010}} < /ref >   
 
 Most halophiles are [[archaea]]ns, but some [[bacteria]] and [[eukaryote]]s are also halophiles, such as the [[alga]] ''[[Dunaliella salina]]''. < ref > {{harvnb|Oren|2002|p=23}} < /ref >   
 
 == Lifestyle ==   
 Most halophilic and salt-eating animals use [[energy]] to remove salt from their [[cytoplasm]]. < ref name=Thomas2008pg.73 / >  Normally, organisms living around a lot of salt would lose water and die because of [[osmosis]]. < ref name=Gimlour / > < ref name=Siddiqui > {{harvnb|Siddiqui|Thomas|2008| p=72}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |title=Biological Control Of Environmental Pollution (Set Of 3 Volumes) |last=Arora |first=Madhu |year=1998 |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd |isbn=8174889493 |page=736 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESfEBQ6u8FUC |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref name=Archaea / >  Water inside the organism would move from inside the cell to its outside environment. This is because there is always movement of water to reach a state where the concentrations of salt are the same on both sides of the [[cell membrane]].

 To survive, the cytoplasm of halophiles must be [[Osmosis#Hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic|isotonic]] with its environment. < ref > {{cite book |title=Microbiology and biogeochemistry of hypersaline environments |last=Oren |first=Aharon |year=1998 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0849383633 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBk1hHU1zx8C |accessdate=20 January 2011}} < /ref >   
 
 To get to this state, halophiles use two different methods. In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, [[yeast]]s, [[algae]] and [[fungi]]), [[organic compounds]] are stored in the cytoplasm. These compounds help the organism survive the stress of osmosis. < ref > {{harvnb|Gilmour|Sephton|2004| p=79}} < /ref > < ref name= " Santos " > Santos H. and da Costa M.S. 2002. Compatible solutes of organisms that live in hot saline environments. ''Environmental Microbiology'' '''4''': 501–509. < /ref >  The most commonly used [[solute]]s for this process are [[pH|neutral]] and include [[amino acid]]s and [[sugar]]s. < ref name=Archaea > {{cite book |title=Archaea: molecular and cellular biology |last=Cavicchioli |first=Ricardo |year=2007 |isbn=978-1555813918 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBfXbf6z1MEC |accessdate=19 December 2010}} < /ref > < ref name=Microbialg > {{cite book |title=Microbial genomes |last1=Fraser |first1=Claire M. |first2=Timothy D. |last2=Read |first3=Karen E. |last3=Nelson |year=2004 |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=1588291898 |page=383 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AANZer_oCJsC |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref name=Stolp1988 > {{harvnb|Stolp|1988|p=139}} < /ref >  [[wikt:advantage|Advantage]]s to this method are that organisms can live in a wider range of salt concentrations. Also, if proteins are not exposed to high salt levels, they do not have to adapt to high salt levels. It requires the organism to use much more energy then the adaption below. < ref name=Thomas2008pg.73 > {{harvnb|Siddiqui|Thomas|2008|p=73}} < /ref >   
 
 The second, less common [[adaptation]], is the selective intake  of [[potassium]] (K < sup > + < /sup > ) [[ion]]s into the cytoplasm. In exchange, the organism pumps [[sodium]] (Na < sup > + < /sup > ) ions out with the help of the sodium-potassium pump. < ref name=Stolp1988 / >  Ions of [[sodium]] may be used instead of potassium, but potassium is the most common. < ref name=Archaea / >  This adaptation is only used by one [[order (biology)|order]] of bacteria and one family of Archaea. < ref name=Oren2002 > {{harvnb|Oren|2002|p=279}} < /ref >  An advantage to this method is that it uses much less energy than the adaption above. The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell ([[enzyme]]s, structural [[protein]]s, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions, < ref name=Oren2002 / >  and high salt levels. < ref name=Thomas2008pg.73 / >  This is much more demanding than the adaptation described above. 
 
 Most halophilic organisms only use one of the two methods, but a few  halophiles can use both. < ref > {{harvnb|Siddiqui|Thomas|2008|pp=72–73}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Categorization== 
 Halophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best. Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles, moderate halophiles, or extreme halophiles. < ref > {{cite book |title= Biotechnology Applications |last=Mishra |first=C.S.K. |author2=Pascale Champagne |year=2009 |publisher=I K International Publishing House |isbn=978-9380026299 |page=288 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VZyADqBbxYC |accessdate=11 December 2010}} < /ref >  Slight halophiles grow best in [[wikt:concentration|concentration]]s of salt around 2% to 5%. An example of a slight halophile is ''Erythrobacter flavus''. < ref > {{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12892146 |title=Erythrobacter flavus sp. nov., a slight halophile from the East Sea in Korea. |author=Yoon JH |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=1169–1174 |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.02510-0 |pmid=12892146 |accessdate=14 December 2010}} < /ref >  Slight halophiles live in mud on the ocean floor, in [[seawater]], and in garden soil. < ref > {{cite book |title=The Biology of halophilic bacteria |last1=Vreeland |first1=Russell H. |last2=Hochstein |first2=Lawrence I. |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0849388414 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NsrFQ-ZhY8C |accessdate=13 December 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Moderate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5% to 20%. Examples of moderate halophiles are organisms in the [[genera]] ''Desulfovibrio'', ''Desulfocella'', ''Desulfohalobium'', and ''Desulfotomaculum''. Moderate halophiles live in marine [[saltern]]s, saline lakes, in matter at the bottom of the sea, and in oil brine fields. < ref > {{cite book |title=Journey to diverse microbial worlds: adaptation to exotic environments |last=Seckbach |first=Joseph |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0792360206 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPZ4pMFKdIEC |accessdate=13 December 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Extreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20% to 30%. Examples of extreme halophiles are ''[[Salinibacter ruber]]'' and organisms in the Halobacteria class. Extreme halophiles live in the Dead Sea in the [[Middle East]] and in man-made solar salterns (lakes used for making sea salt). 
 
 ==Importance and uses== 
 ===In nature=== 
 [[Image:San Francisco Bay Salt Ponds.jpg|thumb|Halophile single-celled organisms color the basins of these salt-evaporation ponds. Depending on the level of salinity, different species dominate, which results in different colors.]] 
 Halophiles play an important part in [[ecosystem]]s. For example, halophiles often support entire [[wikt:population|population]]s of wild birds.  
 
 Halophiles are useful for cleaning up [[pollution|polluted]] environments. < ref name=Dion > {{harvnb|Dion|2007|p=101}} < /ref >  [[Waste water]] with salt concentrations more than 2% is ideal for halophiles to remove organic pollutants from. < ref > {{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/25045354 |title=Use of Halophilic Bacteria in Biological Treatment of Saline Wastewater by Fed-Batch Operation |last1=Kargi |first1=F. |last2=Dinçer |first2=A.R. |journal=Water Environment Research |year=2000 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=170–174 |publisher=Journal Storage |doi=10.2175/106143000X137248 |jstor=25045354 |s2cid=100080392 |accessdate=24 January 2011}} < /ref >  For instance, halophiles have been shown to remove [[phenol]] (a [[wikt:poison|poisonous]] [[chemical]]) from their environments. This could lead to future use in cleaning up [[oil]] [[wikt:spill|spill]]s. < ref > {{cite book |title=Advances in water and wastewater treatment |last=Surampalli |first=Rao Y. |year=2004 |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers |isbn=078440741X |page=168 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOQ8M_SUnWoC |accessdate=24 January 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 ===In fermentation=== 
 Halophiles play an important part in the [[fermentation]] of some foods. For instance, halophiles ferment [[soy sauce|soy]] and [[fish]] [[sauce]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://halo4.umbi.umd.edu/~haloed/halophiles.pdf |title=Halophiles |first1=Shiladitya |last1=DasSarma |first2=Priya |last2=Arora |work=University of Massachusetts |page=8 |accessdate=27 January 2011 |archive-date=12 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812181242/http://halo4.umbi.umd.edu/~haloed/halophiles.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Halophiles also ferment salted fish. 
 
 ===In biotechnology===  
 Halophilic microorganisms are useful in [[biotechnology]]. The compounds that certain halophiles make are valuable. Some of these compounds are not found anywhere else in the living world. < ref > {{harvnb|Oren|2002|p=357}} < /ref >  The salt-tolerant enzymes that halophiles produce can be used in a [[wikt:variety|variety]] of ways. < ref name=HumanaPress > {{cite book |title=Recombinant gene expression: reviews and protocols |last=Lorence |first=Argelia |year=2004 |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=1588292622 |page=184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72AGbwPNyFMC |accessdate=17 December 2010}} < /ref >  For example, these enzymes could be used for rough industrial processes, like [[food processing]]. < ref name=Dion / > 
 
 Some moderate halophiles produce sugars outside the cell. These sugars can be used as thickeners and [[emulsifier]]s in the [[petroleum]] and medicine industries. < ref > {{harvnb|Dion|2007|p=103}} < /ref >
