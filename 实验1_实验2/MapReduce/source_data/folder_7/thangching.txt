 The [[Moirang Ningthourol Lambuba]] mentioned that [[Ancient Moirang|Moirang]] was the amalgamation of different groups of people with different traditional beliefs. During the reign of King Fang Fang Ponglenhanpa (52 BC- 28 AD), all the diversities were merged into one with God Thangjing as the central figure. < ref name= " Birajit 82 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgHgCwAAQBAJ & dq=thangjing & pg=PA82|title=Meeyamgi Kholao: Sprout of Consciousness|last=Birajit|first=Soibam|date=2014-12-01|publisher=ARECOM ( Advanced Research Consortium, Manipur)|language=en|pages=82}} < /ref > 
 
 When the cult of God Thangjing was merged into the [[Umang Lai]]sm, the folk deities associated with God Thangjing began to be identified with other [[Umang Lai]]s. One example is that of goddess Ayang Leima Ahal and goddess Ayang Leima Atonpi. These two goddesses were originally associated with fertility and agriculture. This fact is evident in the ritualistic songs praising them. Later, these two female deities were identified as the consorts of God Thangjing. < ref name= " Birajit 82 " / > 
 
 When God Thangjing was identified as an [[Umang Lai]], the identity of the two goddesses was associated with that of goddess [[Panthoibi]]. Thus, the new identity of Goddess Ayang Leima Panthoibi was formed. < ref name= " Birajit 82 " / > 
 
 == Description == 
 Thangjing is described as the Lord of the tiger hunters. < ref name= " archive.org " / >  The [[Moirang Ningthourol Lambuba]] describes God Thangjing as the Divine Chief of Koireng people, the Progenitor of Kege Clan, the Protector of all the domestic as well as wild animals and the Lord of Mahui tribe. < ref name= " Birajit 82 " / >

 The history of [[Moirang]] is always associated with the godly powers of Thangjing. Thangjing is a living God to the people of [[Ancient Moirang]]. The epic legend of the [[Khamba Thoibi]] is always related to God Thangjing. The ancient temple dedicated to Thangjing still stands on the banks of [[Loktak lake]] in the present day [[Moirang]]. < ref name= " Prakash 2007 " / > < ref name= " archive.org " / > 
 == Mythology == 
 In the legendary epic [[Khamba Thoibi]], Lord Thangjing always stands for righteousness and as a saviour of [[Khuman Khamba|Khamba]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8jlWVP4uKsC & q=Looming+large+in+the+background+is+Lord+Thangjing+who+stands+for+righteousness+.+He+serves+as+saviour+of+Khamba+as+Lord+Krishna+did+for+the+Pandavas & pg=PA35|title=Khwairakpam Chaoba Singh|last=Singh|first=Rajkumar Mani|date=2002|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1519-1|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Thangjing sent [[Phouoibi]] to [[Ancient Moirang|Kege Moirang (Keke Moilang)]] to prosper the human world. < ref name= " Session 1999 " / > 
 
 When goddess [[Panthoibi]] was searching for her beloved [[Nongpok Ningthou]], she asked God Thangjing and God [[Wangbren]] about the whereabouts of [[Nongpok Ningthou]]. 
 To Thangjing, she said: 
 < blockquote > 
 O! Thangjing,  
 Supreme God of Moirang,  
 Loktak is your mirror,  
 My beloved Nongpok has gone like a wind,  
 Like a cattle looking for its herd,  
 I am looking for my beloved.  
 Please tell me
