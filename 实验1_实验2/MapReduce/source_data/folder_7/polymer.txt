 A '''polymer''' is a [[molecule]], made from joining many small molecules called [[monomer]]s. The word  " polymer "  can be broken down into  " poly "  (meaning  " many "  in Greek) and  " mer "  (meaning  " unit " ). This shows how the [[chemical]] [[composition]] of a polymer consists of many smaller units (monomers) bonded together into a larger [[molecule]]. A [[chemical reaction]] bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called '''[[polymerization]]'''. 
 
 Some polymers are natural and made by [[organism]]s. [[Protein]]s have [[polypeptide]] molecules, which are natural polymers made from various [[amino acid]] monomer units. [[Nucleic acid]]s are huge natural polymers made up of millions of [[nucleotide]] units. [[Cellulose]] and [[starch]] (two types of [[carbohydrate]]) are also natural polymers made up of [[glucopyranose]] monomer bonded together in different ways. [[Rubber]] is a mixture of polymers. [[Plastic]]s are man-made polymers. Many [[fiber]]s are made of polymers. 
 
 If the  " units "  called monomers in a polymer are all the same, then the polymer is called a  " homopolymer " . Homopolymers are named by adding the [[prefix]] '''poly-''' before the monomer name from which the polymer is made. For example, a polymer made by bonding [[styrene]] monomer molecules together is called [[polystyrene]]. 
 
 [[File:Polystyrene formation.PNG|frame|center|Many [[styrene]] [[molecule]]s join to make a [[polystyrene]] molecule. The squiggly lines at both ends of the polymer mean that just a short section of a long molecule is shown here. ]] 
 
 If the monomers are not all the same, the polymer is called a  " [[copolymer]] "  or a  " heteropolymer " .

 Many polymer molecules are like ''chains'' where the monomer units are the links. Polymer molecules can be straight-chain, have ''branching'' from the main chain, or ''cross-linking'' between chains. As an example of cross-linking, sulfhydryl (-S-H) groups in two [[cysteine]] amino acid units in polypeptide chains can bond together to make a disulfide bridge (-S-S-) joining the chains together. 
 
 In the same way how large [[hydrocarbon]] molecules in [[Petroleum|crude oil]] can be broken down in smaller molecules e.g. [[ethylene]] by applying heat (a process called [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]), the [[monomer]] ethylene can then be turned into the polymer [[polyethylene]] by applying pressure and adding [[Catalysis|catalysts]]. Polyethelene is the basis of many plastic objects.
