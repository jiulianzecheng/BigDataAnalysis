A '''partnership''' is when two or more [[people]] [[work]] together to complete a task. Those people are '''partners'''. Partner may share a [[business]] together for the [[profit]] of each other. If one business partner ends up making money they both share the profit. Some partners are not individuals but [[corporation]]s or other groups. 
 
 Partnerships may be temporary, e.g. dancing partners (two people who [[dance]] together) or partners at a [[card games]] such as [[bridge game|bridge]] in which partners work together against the other partners (their opponents). 
 
 A partner may also be somebody who lives with another person, e.g. a [[husband]] or [[wife]] ([[marriage]] partners), or a very good friend who shares his or her life with the other person. The word partner in this sense is used a lot in modern times because it does not [[discrimination|discriminate]] between married or unmarried couples.
