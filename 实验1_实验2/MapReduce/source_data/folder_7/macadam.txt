 '''Macadam''' is a type of road making. It was invented by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[engineer]] John Loudon McAdam, about 1820.  
 
 He put crushed stone in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly (squashed it down). Sometimes a layer of stone dust was covered with a cement or [[Bitumen|bitumin]]. This keeps the dust and stones together. 
 
 Macadam's ideas were built on the ideas of some earlier road engineers, like [[Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet|Trésaguet]] and [[Thomas Telford]]. 
 
 The [[Roman roads|Romans]] had not used a binding substance like bitumen. Their roads were nevertheless quite long-lasting.
