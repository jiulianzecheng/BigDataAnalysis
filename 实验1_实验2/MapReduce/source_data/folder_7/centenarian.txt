 A '''centenarian''' is a person who has lived to be at least 100. Because people normally die before this age, the word centenarian is usually linked to [[longevity]]. The [[United States]] has the most centenarians, while [[Japan]] is second.  
 
 Much more rare is a [[supercentenarian]], who is a person that has lived to be at least 110.  Famous supercentenarians have included [[Harry Patch]], who was the last surviving [[Britain|British]] soldier of the [[First World War]] [[trench]]es.  He died on [[25 July]] [[2009]] (aged 111).  For the last seven days of his life he was Britain's oldest man.  [[Henry Allingham]], another First World War [[veteran]], had died a week earlier (aged 113).  < ref > " Then there were none " , The Mail on Sunday, 26 July 2009 p.16 < /ref >
