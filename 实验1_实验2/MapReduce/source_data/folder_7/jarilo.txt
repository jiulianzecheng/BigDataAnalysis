 The only historical source that mentions Jarilo was from a [[German people|German]] [[bishop]] who encountered pagans celebrating a festival called Gerovit (likely a [[German language|German]] way of saying, ''Jarovit''). Until the 19th century in [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Serbia]], folk festivals called ''Jarilo'' were celebrated in late spring. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.argonauts-book.com/kresnik-perun-and-jarilo.html |title=Kresnik, Perun and Jarilo |publisher=Jason and the Argonauts |access-date=15 December 2017}} < /ref >  In these festivals, they worshiped a springtime god.
