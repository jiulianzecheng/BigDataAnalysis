 This Kratos is not to be confused with the protagonist of the video game franchise  " God of War. "  That [[Kratos (God of War character)|Kratos]] is a Spartan warrior and son of Zeus, who is enslaved by Ares, the Greek God of War. Over the course of the original God of War game, Kratos escapes bondage and becomes the new God of War by slaying Ares. However, that title is stripped from Kratos by Zeus at the beginning of God of War II.
