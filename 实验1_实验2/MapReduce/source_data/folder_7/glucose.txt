'''Glucose''' ('''C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub > ''') is a simple [[carbohydrate]], or ''sugar''. It is one of several kinds of sugars. It is important because [[cell]]s in an [[organism]] use it as a source of [[energy]]. Turning glucose into energy is called [[cellular respiration]], which is done inside the [[cells]] of a living organism. Excess glucose is converted to fats and are stored in adipose tissues. 
 
 Glucose is made by [[plants]] in a process called [[photosynthesis]].  It can also be made by animals in their [[liver]] or [[kidney]]s. 
 
 Having the right amount of glucose available in a person's body is important. Glucose is essential in the proper functioning of the brain. It can be measured with a simple blood test. People that do not have enough glucose have low blood sugar levels. This is a health condition called [[hypoglycemia]]. People with too much glucose have [[hyperglycemia]]. They might have a health condition called [[diabetes]]. 
 
 Its [[chemical formula]] is '''C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub > '''. This means it has six [[carbon]] [[atom]]s, 12 [[hydrogen]] atoms, and six [[oxygen]] atoms [[chemical bond|bonded]] together. 
 
 How sugars work, and how glucose can be formed, was studied by a German [[chemist]] named [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] in the 1890s. His work earned him the 1902 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. < ref > [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html  " The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1902 - Emil Fischer " ].

 ==Isomers== 
 
 There are two forms of glucose, the α- and β- forms. The only difference between them is the position of the hydroxyl group, above and below the plane of the ring of the molecule. 
 
 For α-glucose, the hydroxyl (-OH) group is below the ring, while for β-glucose, the (-OH) group is above. < ref > {{cite web|title=A Guide to α and β Carbohydrates|url=https://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/ec_tutorials/tutorial43.pdf|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|accessdate=10 June 2014|archive-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124041208/http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/ec_tutorials/tutorial43.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
