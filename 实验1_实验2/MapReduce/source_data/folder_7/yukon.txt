 The '''Yukon''' is a territory of [[Canada]], north of [[British Columbia]], west of the [[Northwest Territories]], and east of the American state of [[Alaska]]. Its population is 31,000. Most of the territory's people live in the capital of [[Whitehorse]]. Many of the people are native Canadians ([[First Nations]]). 
 
 The Yukon became a territory in 1898. It was part of the [[Northwest Territories]] from 1870 to 1898. Many people came to live in the Yukon during the [[Yukon Gold Rush]] of the 1890s. 
 
 [[Mount Logan]], at 5959 metres above [[sea level]], is Canada's highest mountain. 
 
 The most important industry in the Yukon is [[mining]].
