 '''Sociology''' is the study of [[society|societies]] and how [[human]]s act in groups. Sociology is a [[social science]].  People who study sociology are called [[sociologist]]s.  A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared [[customs]], laws, and [[organization]]s. 
 
 Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780 was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an [[industrial]] society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology. [[Auguste Comte]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] were leading figures in the study of social phenomena.  Themes included: [[community]], [[authority]], [[Social status|status]], [[alienation]] and lack of power. 
 
 In the 2000s, some sociologists look at such things as: [[race (sociology)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[Social class|class]], [[gender]], the family and [[social interaction]]. They also study the breakdown of [[social structure]]s; [[crime]] and [[divorce]]. 
 
 == Work of sociologists == 
 
 Sociologists research the structures that organize society, such as race, [[gender]] (whether a person is male or female), and [[social class]]es (rich or poor). They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse. 
 
 Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or  " sub-fields " . Sociology includes many sub-fields that examine different aspects of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society.  The field of [[demography]] studies changes in population size or type.  Criminology examines criminal behavior and [[crime]].  Political sociology studies [[government]] and laws.  Sociology of race and [[sociology]] of gender examine how people think about race and gender. 
 
 Many sociologists also do research outside of the university. Their research is supposedly intended to help teachers, lawmakers, and government administrators to make better institutions, government programs, and rules. 
 
 Sociologists often use [[statistics]] to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave. Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods. 
 
 == History of sociology == 
 
 Social analysis has been done since the time of [[Plato]]. Sociology became accepted as a type of [[science]] in the early 1800s. [[European]] cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories. Sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted. 
 
 The word  " sociology "  was invented by French thinker Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780. Early thinkers who wrote about sociology included [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Max Weber]]. 
 
 Sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the [[University]] of Kansas in 1890. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by [[Émile Durkheim]]. The first sociology department to be established in Britain was at the [[London School of Economics]] and Political Science in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in [[Germany]] at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by [[Max Weber]].
