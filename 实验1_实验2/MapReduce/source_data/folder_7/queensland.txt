 '''Queensland''' is a state in eastern [[Australia]]. It is the second largest [[state]] by area and the third largest state by [[population]]. In 2006 there were 3,904,532 people living in Queensland. < ref > {{Census 2006 AUS  |id =3|name = QLD |accessdate = 16 June 2012 |quick=on}} < /ref > 
 	 
 It occupies the north-east corner of Australia. The state has the [[Northern Territory]] to the west, [[South Australia]] to the south-west and [[New South Wales]] to the south. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the [[Coral Sea]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. The capital city is [[Brisbane]]. 
 
 The area was first settled by [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]], who arrived between 40,000 and 65,000 years ago. Later, Queensland was made a British Crown Colony that was separated from New South Wales in 1859. The area that currently forms Brisbane was originally the [[Moreton Bay]] punishment colony, intended as a place for [[criminal]]s with a repeated offence [[history]] who had offended while serving out their sentences in New South Wales. The state later encouraged free settlement, and today Queensland's [[economy]] is dominated by the agricultural, tourist and natural resource sectors. 
 
 The population is concentrated in the south-east corner, which includes the [[Capital (city)|capital]] Brisbane, [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], [[Logan City]], and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]. Other major regional centres are in [[North Queensland]] and they are [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]], [[Bundaberg, Queensland|Bundaberg]], [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]], and [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]]. Queensland is often nicknamed the Sunshine State, since it enjoys warm [[weather]] and a sizable portion of the state is in the tropics.
