 The '''albedo''' of an object is the extent to which it [[reflect]]s [[light]], more specifically light which comes from the [[Sun]]. It is defined as the ratio of reflected to incident [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is a [[Dimensionless quantity|unitless]] measure indicative of a surface's or body's diffuse [[reflectivity]]. The word is derived from ''albus'', a [[Latin]] word for  " white " .
