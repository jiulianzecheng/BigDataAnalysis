 '''Ellipsis''' is a term of [[punctuation]] marks with a row of three points (...). Its name comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|ancient Greek word]] ''ἔλλειψις'' (omission/falling short). Notice that the three dots are not spaced as full points: they are a separate special [[typographic]] sign. 
 
 Depending on context and place in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious or echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. An ellipsis can be used to trail off into silence—for example: ''But I thought he was...'' 
 
 * ''So much more could be said...'' 
 
 When [[text]] is [[wikt:quote|quoted]] from a book or a newspaper, it stands for words that have been cut out to save space in a page. For example: 
 *  " ''...one day all Americans will live peacefully throughout the world...they will be at peace with all other world inhabitants...'' " 
 
 When speaking, it can be referred to as  " dot-dot-dot " . 
 
 In [[mathematics]], different symbols for ellipsis are used to a similar effect. These include the horizontal ellipsis symbols  < math > \ldots < /math >  and  < math > \cdots < /math > , along with vertical ellipsis symbols such as  < math > \vdots < /math >  and  < math > \ddots < /math >  . < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Dots (LaTeX2e unofficial reference manual (July 2018))|url=http://joshua.smcvt.edu/latex2e/Dots.html|access-date=2020-09-22|website=joshua.smcvt.edu}} < /ref >
