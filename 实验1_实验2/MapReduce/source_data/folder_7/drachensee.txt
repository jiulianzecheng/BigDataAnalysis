The '''Drachensee''' is a lake in [[Austria]] which is a few meters below of [[Coburger Hütte]]. It is at about 1910 meters (6 266 feet) attitude. If you climb up above [[Coburger Hütte]] at most of the high peeks it will be seen. It is very similiar to the [[Seebensee]] which is lower down the Drachensee and on the other side of [[Coburger Hütte]].
