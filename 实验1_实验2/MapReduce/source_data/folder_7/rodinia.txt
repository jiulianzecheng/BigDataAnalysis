'''Rodinia''', meaning  " to give birth " , is the name of a [[supercontinent]]. It had most or all of [[Earth]]'s landmass when the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[era]] began. < ref > Li Z.X. ''et al'' 2008.

 Rodinia existed between 1.1 [[billion]] and 750 million years ago. It formed from parts of an older and poorly understood supercontinent. < ref name= " Zhao1 " > {{Cite journal |first=Guochun | display-authors = etal|last=Zhao |year=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_earth-science-reviews_2002-11_59_1-4/page/125 |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 | issue = 1–4|pages=125–162 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z}} < /ref > < ref name= " Zhao2 " > {{Cite journal |first=Guochun | display-authors = etal|last=Zhao |year=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_earth-science-reviews_2004-09_67_1-2/page/91 |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 | issue = 1–2|pages=91–123 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z}} < /ref > 
 
 Rodinia broke up in the first period of the Neoproterozoic, the [[Tonian]]. Later its continental fragments were re-assembled to form [[Pangaea]] 300{{ndash}}250 million years ago. In contrast with Pangaea, little is known yet about the exact position and history of Rodinia. 
 
 The extreme cooling of the global climate around 700 million years ago (the so-called [[Snowball Earth]] of the [[Cryogenian]] [[period (geology)|period]]) and the rapid [[evolution]] of primitive life during the following [[Ediacaran]] and [[Cambrian]] periods may have been caused by the breaking up of Rodinia. 
 
 == Break-up == 
 The break-up of Rodinia is understood better than its formation. Extensive [[flood basalt]] flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents. This is evidence for large scale [[Rift (geology)|rifting]] about 750 million years ago. < ref name= " mcmenamin "  / >  As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, < ref name=Torsvik2003 > {{Cite book

 In a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the [[Iapetus Ocean]] formed. It might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called [[Pannotia]]. 
 
 == Its effect on life == 
 Unlike later supercontinents, Rodinia itself was entirely barren. It existed before life colonized dry land. It was before the [[ozone layer]] formed, so Rodinia was too exposed to the [[ultraviolet radiation]] in sunlight for organisms to live there and leave fossils. However, its existence probably affected the marine life of its time. 
 
 In the [[Cryogenian]] period, the Earth experienced large [[glaciation]]s, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by [[glacier]]s or the southern polar [[ice cap]]. 
 
 The eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans, and [[seafloor spreading]], which produces warmer, less-dense oceanic [[lithosphere]]. Due to its lower [[density]], hot oceanic lithosphere does not lie so deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the [[sea level]] to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas. < ref name=mcmenamin > {{Cite book |last1=McMenamin |first1=M.A. |last2=McMenamin |first2=D.L. |year=1990 |title=The emergence of animals |url=https://archive.org/details/emergenceofanima00mcme |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-06647-3}} chapter: ''The Rifting of Rodinia'' < /ref > 
 
 The increased [[evaporation]] from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the [[weathering]] of exposed rock. This increased rainfall may have reduced [[greenhouse gas]] levels. When CO < sub > 2 < /sub >  level dropped, the period known as [[Snowball Earth]] began. < ref > {{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature02408|last=Donnadieu |first=Y. | display-authors = etal|year=2004 |title=A 'snowball Earth' climate triggered by continental break-up through changes in runoff |journal=Nature |volume=428|issue=6980 |pages=303–306|pmid=15029192 |bibcode = 2004Natur.428..303D |s2cid=4393545 }}
