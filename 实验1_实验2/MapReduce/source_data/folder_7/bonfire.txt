A '''bonfire''' or '''balefire''' is a large controlled outdoor [[fire]] made from [[bale]]s of [[straw]] or [[wood]]. The word is believed to come from  " [[bone]] fire " . In the time of the [[Celt]]s, there were [[midsummer]] festivals where animal [[bone]]s were burnt to ward off evil [[spirit]]s.  
 
 ==What it means in Great Britain== 
 In [[Great Britain]], bonfires are particularly associated with ''[[Guy Fawkes Night]]''. This night is  also known as ''[[firework]]s night'' or ''[[bonfire night]]''. On this night, people celebrate that the [[Gunpowder Plot]]  was discovered. This discovery took place on 5 November 1605. They do this celebration each year. (It is called an ''annual celebration''.) 
 
 In [[Northern Ireland]], ''bonfires'' are associated with celebrations on the anniversary of the [[Battle of the Boyne]]. 
 
 ==What it means in Japan== 
 In Japan, large fires called bon-bi are set to welcome the return of the spirits of the [[ancestor]]s.  Though the two terms are not etymologically or historically related, they serve similar purposes and indicate the universal importance of large fires. 
 
 ==Use of bonfires for rituals== 
 Bonfires were also used for [[ritual]]s. The idea was that the fire would [[pure|purify]]. It was used to consecrate things, or people, that is to make them sacred, in some way. In ancient times, [[cattle]] were important symbols of wealth and status. Such cattle were led through the smoke of a bonfire. Couples who were to be [[marriage|wed]] on May Day would leap through the flames of the bonfire to seal their vows. [[Coal]]s from a bonfire would be taken home to light the fires in family [[hearth]]s.  This practice was thought to bring good [[luck|fortune]]. People also believed that the residents of the [[Faery]] realm were incapable of producing fire themselves; [[ember]]s of bonfires would be carried to the [[underworld]] and tended there. 
 
 ==Neopagan and Wiccan beliefs== 
 Along with the [[Maypole]], the bonfire is an important component of the [[Wicca]]n and [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] celebration of [[Beltaine]], also known as [[May Day]]. 
 
 Nine woods are placed into a traditional Wiccan balefire.  These woods are [[rowan]], [[dogwood]], [[elder]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[oak]], [[juniper]], [[holly]], [[cedar]], and [[apple]].  Occasionally, [[pine]] is also used instead of holly or elder, as are a handful of other woods.  In some regions, superstition, religious belief, or tradition prohibits the cutting of certain trees.
