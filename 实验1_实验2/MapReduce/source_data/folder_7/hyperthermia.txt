'''Hyperthermia''' is a high [[body temperature]].  It happens when a person is not able to [[Thermoregulation|control their body temperature]].  This can happen for many reasons, like very hot weather, [[fever]], and some [[Medication|medicines]] or [[illegal drugs]]. 
 
 Doctors [[wikt: define|define]] hyperthermia as a body temperature that is over 101 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (equal to 38.3 degrees [[Celsius]]). < ref name=Mayohs / >  This is higher than the [[average]] human body temperature, which is normally around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). When a person gets hyperthermia, they can have ''heat-related injuries'', where the high body temperature hurts the body. 
 
 There are three forms of heat-related injuries caused by hyperthermia: '''heat cramps''' (the least serious), '''heat exhaustion''', and '''heat stroke''' (the most serious). 
 
 == Causes of hyperthermia == 
 [[File:Ecstasy monogram.jpg|thumb|right|Drugs like [[MDMA|Ecstasy]] can cause severe hyperthermia]] 
 All types of hyperthermia can be caused by the same things.  Some common causes are: < ref name=ortho > {{cite web |url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00319 |title=Heat Injury and Heat Exhaustion |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=July 2009 |website=www.orthoinfo.aaos.org |publisher=American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 * [[Weather]]: Weather that is very hot, sunny, and [[humid]] 
 * Activity: Exercising or working a lot, especially if it is hot out 
 * [[Old age|Older people]] and [[Baby|infants]] can get hyperthermia even if they are resting inside, if the weather outside is hot and [[Humidity|humid]], and they are not getting enough cool air.  This can happen because very old and very young people have trouble controlling their body temperatures. 
 * Illegal drugs, especially [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and [[amphetamine]]s, can make the body's temperature get very hot, very quickly < ref name=nhs > {{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Heat-exhaustion-and-heatstroke/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Heat Exhaustion and Heatstroke |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=June 11, 2015 |website=www.nhs.uk |publisher=National Health Service of the United Kingdom |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 Other things that make a person more likely to get hyperthermia, especially if they are exercising or working, include: < ref name=ortho / > 
 * Clothing: Wearing dark clothing, hats or helmets, or padded clothing (like football pads) 
 * Body weight: Having more body [[fat]] makes it harder for the body to cool down 
 * [[Dehydration]] (not having enough [[fluid]]s in the body): This makes it harder for the body to cool itself down by [[sweat]]ing 
 * Fever: Because the body's temperature is already higher than normal 
 * Medicines: Some medications, like [[beta blocker]]s and [[antipsychotic]] medicines < ref name=nhs / > 
 
 == Heat cramps == 
 Heat cramps are the least serious form of hyperthermia.  (A  " cramp "  is a sharp pain caused by a muscle getting tighter and shorter.) 
 
 [[File:Amanda Fran√ßozo At The Runner Sports Fragment.jpg|thumb|left|The body sweats to try to cool itself down]] 
 === Symptoms === 
 The major [[symptom]]s of heat cramps are: < ref name=ortho / > 
 * Painful cramps, usually in the legs or abdomen 
 * [[Sweat]]ing a lot, which can cause [[dehydration]] and loss of [[electrolyte]]s (important salts that the body needs) 
 
 === Treatment === 
 People with heat cramps usually do not need medical treatment.  The best treatments for heat cramps are: < ref name=ortho / > 
 * Moving to a cool place and resting 
 * Resting the muscles that hurt 
 * Drinking water or sports drinks to treat dehydration 
 
 == Heat exhaustion == 
 Heat exhaustion is more serious than heat cramps.  If affects the whole body instead of just certain muscles, like heat cramps. 
 
 === Symptoms === 
 Symptoms of heat exhaustion may include: < ref name=nhs / > 
 * [[Syncope]] (fainting) or dizziness 
 * [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]] 
 * More serious dehydration 
 ** The person may be [[Orthostasis|orthostatic]] (this means they get dizzy or faint when they stand up; it is a sign of dehydration) 
 * Feeling very [[thirst]]y with a dry mouth 
 * Cool, clammy skin (because the body is trying as hard as it can to pull heat out of the body by sweating) 
 * [[Nausea]] or [[vomit]]ing (because of dehydration) 
 
 === Treatment === 
 People with heat exhaustion may need medical treatment. 
 
 [[First aid]] for people with heat exhaustion includes: < ref name=nhs / > 
 * Moving the person to a cool place 
 * Having the patient take off extra layers of clothes 
 * Cooling the patient down by fanning them and putting wet towels on their body 
 * Having them lie down and put their feet up if they are feeling dizzy 
 * Having them drink water or sports drinks - but only if they are awake, not [[Mental confusion|confused]], and not vomiting 
 * Turning the person on their side if they are vomiting 
 If a person with heat exhaustion gets medical treatment, EMTs or doctors may: 
 * Give them [[oxygen]] 
 * Give them water and electrolytes [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] (through a needle placed into a [[vein]]) if they are too confused to drink, or are vomiting 
 
 == Heat stroke == 
 Heat stroke is a [[medical emergency]].  If it is not treated quickly enough, it causes [[brain damage]] and [[death]]. < ref name=Mayohs > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/basics/definition/con-20032814 |title=Heat Stroke |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=July 12, 2014 |website=www.mayoclinic.org |publisher=The Mayo Clinic |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   It is one of the most common causes of death in sports that can be [[wikt: prevent|prevented]]. < ref name=hs > {{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/166320-overview#a6 |title=Heatstroke |last1=Helman, MD |first1=Robert S. |last2=Habal, MD |first2=Rania |date=May 1, 2015 |website=Medscape |publisher= |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 Heat stroke happens when a person gets so hot that their body cannot do anything to bring their temperature down.  The body has tried every strategy it has to cool itself down.  But the body is so hot that none of those strategies work any more.  This causes the body temperature to rise very quickly.  The body gets so hot inside that its [[tissue]]s, especially the [[brain]], get damaged.  Usually, people with heat stroke have a body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.  The brain cannot survive for long at these temperatures.  Heat stroke can very quickly cause damage to the brain, [[heart]], [[kidney]]s, and muscles. < ref name=Mayohs / > 
 
 === Symptoms === 
 
 ==== Early symptoms ==== 
 Often, the first signs of heat stroke are: < ref name=Mayohs / > 
 * Agitation (the person gets upset and restless) 
 * [[Mental confusion|Confusion]] 
 * A strong, [[Tachycardia|fast heart rate]] 
 
 ==== Late symptoms ==== 
 As heat stroke gets worse, symptoms that can kill the person start to appear.  For example: < ref name=hs / > 
 * [[Seizure]]s, especially [[status epilepticus]] 
 * Very [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]] (too low to get [[blood]] and [[oxygen]] to the brain) 
 * A weak, [[Bradycardia|slow heart rate]] (this is a sign that the heart cannot beat strongly enough to get blood and oxygen to the body) 
 * [[Delirium]] or [[coma]] (caused by the brain getting so hot that it cannot work, and not getting enough oxygen) 
 * The patient's skin will also be flushed (red), hot, and dry (because the body is no longer able to cool itself by sweating) 
 
 === Treatment === 
 [[File:The British Army in the Middle East 1943 E26027.jpg|thumb|A British soldier in the Middle East has heat stroke and is being cooled with water spray (1943)]] 
 People with heat stroke always need emergency medical treatment as soon as possible.  If a person might have heat stroke, [[9-1-1]] or another [[emergency telephone number]] should be called right away.  The [[emergency medical dispatcher]] can explain what to do to help the person until an [[ambulance]] gets there. 
 
 Once the person with heat stroke gets to an ambulance or a [[hospital]], treatments for heat stroke may include: < ref name=hs / > 
 * Cooling the person down as fast as possible.  Ways to do this include: 
 ** Taking the person's clothes off 
 ** Covering the person with wet towels 
 ** Turning up the air conditioning or turning on a fan, if possible 
 ** Putting ice packs in the person's [[Axilla|armpits]], on the back of their neck, and in their [[groin]] 
 ** Putting the person into an ice bath  
 ** Giving cold intravenous fluids, both to help cool the person down and to help with dehydration 
 * Giving [[benzodiazepine]]s to stop shivering from being cooled down so quickly (shivering makes the body even warmer) 
 * Giving [[anticonvulsant|medicines to stop seizures]] 
 * Giving medicines to help heart problems caused by the heat stroke 
 * Giving oxygen, or putting a tube down the person's throat to help them breathe (this is called [[intubation]]) 
 
 ===Prognosis=== 
 The [[prognosis]] for people with heat stroke depends on how high their body temperature got, how quickly their body temperature increased, and how quickly they got treatment. 
 
 Up to 80% of people who do not get treatment for heat stroke right away die. < ref name=hs / >   But cooling people with heat stroke down right away, and getting them treatment very quickly, can change this so that only 10% die. < ref name=hs / >   But some people who survive have brain damage or other health problems caused by their heat stroke.
