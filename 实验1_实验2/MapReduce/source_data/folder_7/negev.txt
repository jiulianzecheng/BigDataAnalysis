 The '''Negev''' or '''Naqab''' is the southern region of [[Israel]]/[[Palestine]]. It is a [[desert]] that covers about 60% of the current state of Israel. Only about 10% of the people that live in Israel live there. The Negev has borders with [[Egypt]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] to the west, the [[Arabah]] in the [[Great Rift Valley]] in the east, and a line connecting [[Gaza city]] to [[Ein Gedi]] near the [[Dead Sea]] to the north. [[Beersheba]] and [[Eilat]] are the main cities of the Negev. 
 
 The Negev has a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]]. The '''Negev incense route''' was a trade route in the Negev. It connected [[Arabia]] to the [[Mediterranean]] in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]]-[[Roman Empire|Roman period]]. < ref > That is, from the death of Alexander through the Roman Empire. < /ref >  The trade led to the development of ancient towns, [[fort]]s and [[caravanserai]] en route, and agricultural development. It was proclaimed as of outstanding universal value by [[UNESCO]] in 2005. < ref name= Desert > {{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1107|title=Incense Route â€“ Desert Cities in the Negev|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=UNESCO Organization}} < /ref >
