 '''Nihilism''' is a way of thinking which rejects [[meaning]], [[concept]]s, or [[life]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Crosby|first=Donald A.|title=Nihilism|year=1998|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-N037-1|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9780415250696|quote=As its name implies (from Latin nihil, 'nothing'), philosophical nihilism is a philosophy of negation, rejection, or denial of some or all aspects of thought or life.}} < /ref >  It can be a {{c|Philosophical movements and positions|philosophical position}} or a [[wikt:condition|condition]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was a German thinker who wrote many things about nihilism. What he wrote is often called the most important [[wikt:explanation|explanation]] of nihilism.

This is called  " {{definition with link|link=#Value destruction|value destruction|questioning traditional values until they fall apart}} " . < ref name=Pratt / > 
 
 Russian thinkers like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and Dmitry Pisarev inspired a lot of nihilists because they believed this kind of destruction was good. < ref > {{cite book|title=Russian Philosophy Volume II: the Nihilists, The Populists, Critics of Religion and Culture|first1=James M.|last1=Edie|first2=James|last2=Scanlan|first3=Mary-Barbara|last3=Zeldin|date=1994|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|page=3, 65}} < /ref >  The word  " nihilism "  was also made popular by a Russian novel called ''Fathers and Sons'' by [[Ivan Turgenev]].

 Nietzsche thought value destruction had bad results but couldn't be stopped. He also thought [[Christianity]] had made value destruction happen, and called it a type of nihilism. He thought Christianity was nihilistic because it was {{definition with link|link=#Life-denying|life-denying|having a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living}}, meaning it has a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living. < ref name=Deleuze > {{cite book|title=Nietzsche and Philosophy|last=Deleuze|first=Gilles|publisher=The Athlone Press|year=1962|isbn=978-0-231-13877-2|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Tomlinson|translator-first=Hugh|publication-date=1983}} < /ref >  Religious thinkers have instead said that nihilism comes from rejecting religion. Sometimes people think parts of [[Buddhism]] are like nihilism, even though other parts reject nihilism.

 *{{anchor|Anti-nihilism}} '''''anti-nihilism''''' — ''Anti-nihilism'' means to be against nihilism. It was also a genre of [[Russian literature]] in the 19th century. Examples of people who have been called anti-nihilists are [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], < ref name=Petrov2019/ >  and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. < ref name=Haar1985 > {{cite book|last=Haar|first=Michel|title=The New Nietzsche: contemporary styles of interpretation|year=1985|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-51034-9|page=6|url=https://archive.org/details/newnietzschecont00alli/page/6 }} < /ref >  But in one way or another, many anti-nihilists have ended up helping nihilism. 
 *{{anchor|Life-denying}} '''''life-denying''''' — If something is ''life-denying'' it means it has a [[wikt:negative|negative]] and unhealthy attitude towards living. It is the opposite of being  " [[life-affirming]] " .

 *{{anchor|Value destruction}} '''''value destruction''''' — ''Value destruction'' means destroying the [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] that people take for granted. This is by questioning [[wikt:traditional|traditional]] values until they fall apart.

 == Origins == 
 
 The word  " nihilism "  comes from  " {{lang|la|nihil}} " , which is the [[Latin]] word for  " [[nothing]] " . But the exact origins of the word  " nihilism "  are unknown. In the [[Middle Ages]] the word was used for some kinds of [[heresy]]. < ref name=Britannica/ >  Around the time of the [[French Revolution]], it was a word for the destruction of [[Christianity]] and traditional European values. It was used in many European countries. < ref name=terBorg1988 > {{cite journal|last=ter Borg|first=Meerten B.|year=1988|title=The Problem of Nihilism: A Sociological Approach|journal=Sociological Analysis|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–16|jstor=3711099|doi=10.2307/3711099}} < /ref >  Soon, the word was also used in [[English language|English]]. It probably came from the [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], or [[Latin|Late Latin]] form of the word. < ref > {{cite dictionary|entry=Nihilism|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=September 2003|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127097 |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary}} < /ref > 
 
 " Nihilism "  first became a philosophical word in German, and then in Russian. These two meanings were combined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. < ref name=Marmysz2003/ >

 In 1733, the word  " nihilism "  was used by a German writer named Friedrich Leberecht Goetz. He used the word as a literary term. < ref > {{cite book|last=Gloy|first=Karen|year=2014|chapter=Nihilismus–Pessimismus|title=Zwischen Glück und Tragik|publisher=Wilhelm Fink|pages=145–200|lang=de|doi=10.30965/9783846756454_007|isbn=9783846756454}} < /ref >  A Swiss thinker called [[Jacob Hermann Obereit]] also used the word in 1787, and [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] did in 1799. This is where it first became part of philosophy. The belief that no one can know true [[reality]] is what Obereit called  " nihilism " . He used this definition to call [[Immanuel Kant]] a nihilist. This was because Kant said people cannot be certain of real things, but can only be certain about their [[wikt:experience|experience]] of real things. Jacobi also used this definition to say Kant and his followers were nihilists. For example, he famously called [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] a nihilist. < ref name=Marmysz2003 > {{cite book|last=Marmysz|first=John|title=Laughing at Nothing: Humor as a Response to Nihilism|location=Albany|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2003|isbn=9780791458402}} < /ref >  Jacobi thought [[German idealism]] and [[humanism]] were kinds of nihilism that came from the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

 Around 1824, a German journalist called [[Joseph von Görres]] used the word  " nihilism "  in a political way. He said that rejecting [[social structure]]s was nihilism. < ref > {{cite dictionary|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Nihilism  & #124; Etymology, origin and meaning of nihilism by etymonline|entry=Nihilism|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/?term=nihilism }} < /ref >  But the word  " nihilism "  almost died out during this time. < ref name=Gillespie1996 > {{cite book|title=Nihilism Before Nietzsche|url=https://archive.org/details/nihilismbeforeni0000gill|first=Michael Allen|last=Gillespie|year=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226293486}} < /ref >  For example, the German thinker [[Max Stirner]] is called one of the first true nihilists but he never used the word. < ref name=Pratt/ > < ref name=Nishitani1990 > {{cite book|title=The Self-Overcoming of Nihilism|first=Keiji|last=Nishitani|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|translator=Graham Parkes|translator2=with Setsuko Aihara|editor-first=Peter J.|editor-last=McCormick|isbn=0791404382}} < /ref >  He wrote most of his works in the 1840s. 
 
 === Russian nihilism === 
 {{hatnote| " Russian nihilism "  redirects here.}} 
 [[File:Dimitri Pisarev.jpg|[[Dmitry Pisarev]] was a main Russian nihilist of the 1860s|thumb|left|upright=0.75]] 
 
 Russian nihilism was an early kind of nihilist philosophy. It was also a [[subculture]] that sometimes mixed with [[revolution]]ism. < ref name=Pratt/ > < ref name=Lovell1998 > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Nihilism, Russian|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Stephen|last=Lovell|year=1998|publisher=Taylor and Francis|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-E072-1|isbn=9780415250696}} < /ref >  Russian nihilism is often wrongly called a kind of [[terrorism|political terrorism]] because of this. < ref name=Britannica/ >  Its main interest was to destroy traditional values, especially in [[art]] and [[religion]]. Its main [[philosopher]]s were Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev. < ref name=Lovell1998/ >  It also attacked the belief in [[free will]] and [[God]]. German nihilism came from [[German idealism]], but Russian nihilism was different because it attacked idealism. < ref name=Petrov2019/ > 
 
 Nikolai Nadezhdin was probably the first writer to use the word  " nihilism "  in Russian. He first used it in 1829 by calling [[scepticism]] the same as nihilism. And Vasilij Bervi used the same meaning. Russian journalists like Mikhail Katkov and Vissarion Belinsky also used the word. Katkov called nihilism because it rejected all [[morality]]. He worried it could cause a [[revolution]]. < ref name=Britannica/ >  Belinsky used the word in a more [[wikt:neutral|neutral]] way. < ref name=Petrov2019/ >  But the word was still not popular at the time. < ref name=Gillespie1996/ > 
 
 [[Mikhail Bakunin]] is often called the father of Russian nihilism. In 1842, he wrote:  " Let us therefore trust the eternal spirit which destroys and [[wikt:annihilate|annihilates]] only because it is the [[wikt:unfathomable|unfathomable]] and eternal source of all life. The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too! " . Then in the 1850s and 60s, the theory behind Russian nihilism started to form. < ref name=Petrov2019/ >  Originally it was a philosophy of scepticism towards [[moral]]s and [[truth]]. It was in 1862 that the Russian author [[Ivan Turgenev]] made the word  " nihilism "  popular. He used it in his novel called ''Fathers and Sons'' to describe the attitude of the younger generation. < ref name=Britannica/ > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Fathers and Sons|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=March 27, 2020|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fathers-and-Sons }} < /ref >  The nihilists in the book say they are people who reject {{em|everything}} that they can. < ref name=Frank1995/ > < ref > {{cite book|title=Fathers and Sons|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451515001|chapter=Chapter 5|first=Ivan|last=Turgenev|translator=Constance Garnett|quote=A nihilist is a man who does not bow down before any authority, who does not take any principle on faith, whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in.}} < /ref >  Even though Turgenev was more of an {{definition with link|link=#Anti-nihilism|anti-nihilist|someone who is against nihilism}}, many young people started to call themselves  " nihilists "  because of this book. < ref name=Petrov2019/ > 
 
 For Pisarev, nihilism was mostly philosophical and not [[political]]. He thought [[wikt:extraordinary|extraordinary]] people should free themselves from rules and morals. He thought anyone who did this would be above ordinary people. < ref name=Frank1995/ >  But later, Russian nihilism became more and more political. It inspired many [[revolution]]aries such as [[Sergei Nechaev]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. < ref name=Marmysz2003/ > 
 
 === Nietzsche === 
 [[File:Friedrich Nietzsche von WikiImages auf Pixabay.jpg|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote a lot about the problems of nihilism|thumb|upright=0.8]] 
 
 Probably the most important explanation of nihilism comes from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He wrote many criticisms against nihilism. But he also had some similar beliefs to nihilists like Dmitry Pisarev and Max Stirner. < ref name=Frank1995/ > < ref name=Nishitani1990/ >  Because of this, he is sometimes called a nihilist and sometimes called an {{definition with link|link=#Anti-nihilism|anti-nihilist|someone who is against nihilism}}. < ref name=Haar1985/ >  His explanation of nihilism combined the German and Russian meanings of the word, and also went further. < ref name=Marmysz2003/ > 
 
 When Nietzsche asks the question  " What does nihilism mean? " , his answer is that  " the highest values {{definition|devalue|to lose the value of something}} themselves. " < ref name=Wilkerson > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilkerson|first=Dave|title=Friedrich Nietzsche (1844—1900)|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/|archive-date=March 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331214808/https://www.iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/ }} < /ref >  He says nihilism is when someone thinks that what {{em|should}} exist is not what {{em|does}} exist. < ref > Nietzsche, Friedrich.
