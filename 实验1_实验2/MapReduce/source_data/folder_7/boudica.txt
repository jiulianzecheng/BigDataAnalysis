 '''Boudica'''  < ref > or '''Boudicca'''; known by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] as '''Boudicea''' and the Welsh as '''Buddug''' < /ref >  (born about 25 & nbsp;AD, died 60/61 & nbsp;AD) was the queen of the [[celts|Celtic]] [[Iceni]] people in [[Norfolk]] in the eastern part of [[Roman Britain]]. Her husband Prasutagus ruled an independent [[client state]] of Rome. He died in 60 AD and left his [[kingdom]] jointly to his daughters and the [[Roman emperor]]. 
 
 A statue of Boudica has stood in the [[Westminster]] area of [[London]] since 1902. She was the Boss of the celts. 
 
 == Death of Prasutagus and its aftermath == 
 In this era it was normal Roman practice to allow allied [[kingdom]]s independence  for the lifetime of their [[Client state|client king]]. For example, the provinces of [[Bithynia]] and [[Galatia]], were part of the Empire in just this way. Also, Roman law allowed inheritance only through the male line. 
 
 When Prasutagus died, his will was ignored by the Governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. His kingdom was then annexed just as if it had been conquered. To make matters worse, Roman money-lenders called in the debts which Prasutagus owed during his lifetime. To collect the debts the Romans confiscated the lands and property of the Iceni and treated their [[noble]]s like [[slave]]s. 
 
 When Boudica protested, Paulinus had her [[Flogging|flogged]], and her two daughters [[rape]]d in public. [[Tacitus]] reports: 
 : " Prasutagus, the late king of the Icenians... by his will he left the whole to his two daughters and the [[emperor]] in equal shares, conceiving, by that stroke of policy, that he should provide at once for the tranquillity of his kingdom and his family. 
 
 : " The event was otherwise. His dominions were ravaged by the [[centurion]]s; the [[slave]]s pillaged his house, and his effects were seized as lawful plunder. His wife, Boudicca, was disgraced with cruel stripes; her daughters were ravished, and the most illustrious of the Icenians were, by force, deprived of the positions which had been transmitted to them by their ancestors. The whole country was considered as a legacy bequeathed to the plunderers. The relations of the deceased king were reduced to slavery " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.athenapub.com/tacitus1.htm |title=Tacitus, Chapter 31 |access-date=2013-09-28 |archive-date=2013-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091613/http://www.athenapub.com/tacitus1.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Revenge of the Iceni == 
 Choosing a good moment, when the [[Governor]] was attacking [[Anglesey]] and another legion was in [[Bristol]], Boudica led the Iceni and their associates, the Trinovantes, to war. < ref name= " hingleyunwin " > Hingley, Richard  &  Unwin, Christina. 2006. ''Boudica: Iron Age warrior queen''. Hambledon, p.44 and 61. {{ISBN|978-1-85285-516-1}} < /ref >  They destroyed [[Camulodunum]] (modern [[Colchester]]), and moved towards [[Londinium]]. There was only the 9th legion (Legio IX Hispana) to defend it. The tribes burnt and destroyed both [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]) and Londinium and massacred all they could lay their hands on. < ref > Davies N. 2008. ''The Isles: a history'', p. 93. < /ref > < ref > Dando-Collins S. 2012. ''Legions of Rome: the definitive history of every Roman legion''. < /ref >  An estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and British were killed in the three cities by those led by Boudica. < ref name= " TAnn14.33 " > Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D33 14.33] < /ref > 
 
 == Battle of Watling Street == 
 The final battle took place near [[Watling Street]] in the English [[Midlands]]. Watling Street was an old trackway between Canterbury and St Albans. The Romans rebuilt it their way, and took it through the Midlands into Wales. 
 
 While Boudica's army assaulted in Verulamium, Suetonius put together a force with his own Legio XIV Gemina, some detachments of the Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and any available auxiliaries. < ref name= " TacAnn14.34 " > Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.34 14.34] < /ref >  Down near [[Exeter]], The [[Prefect]] of Legio II Augusta, [[Poenius Postumus]], ignored the Governor's call to arms. < ref name= " TacAnn14.37 " > Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.37 14.37] < /ref >  Nonetheless, the Governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men. 
 
 The Romans were heavily outnumbered. However, the tribes lacked manoeuvrability. They had no way to direct these numbers, which put them at a disadvantage to the Romans. The Romans were skilled at open combat, and had better equipment and discipline. Also, the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans at any given time. 
 
 First, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of ''[[pilum|pila]]'' (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of Britons who rushed toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers engaged Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a [[Flying wedge|wedge]] formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families. They had put their people in wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered. 
 
 Tacitus reports that  " according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell "  compared with only four hundred Romans. Boudica fled, and her time and place of death is not known. 
 
 The Prefect Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. Fearing Suetonius' actions would provoke further rebellion, [[Nero]] replaced the governor with the more conciliatory [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]]. < ref > Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#39|14.39]] < /ref >  The historian  [[Suetonius|Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus]] tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain. < ref > [[Suetonius]], ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#39 39-40] < /ref >
