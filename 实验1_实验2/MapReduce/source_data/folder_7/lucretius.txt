 '''Titus Lucretius Carus''' (ca. 98 BC â€“ ca. 55 BC) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[poet]] and [[philosopher]]. He is known for ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (in [[English language|English]]: " On the Nature of the Universe " ). It is an [[epic]] philosophical work about the [[belief]]s of [[Epicureanism]]. 
 
 There are not any details about his life. [[Saint Jerome]] tells of how he became [[insanity|insane]] because of a [[love]] [[potion]] and wrote his poetry in between fits of insanity. Modern [[academia|scholarship]] thinks this was just used to explain how he [[behavior|behaved]]. The ''De rerum natura'' had a large affect on the [[Augustan poet]]s, including [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]]. The work were lost for a time. It was later found in a [[monastery]] in [[Germany]]. This work played an important part both in the [[development]] of [[atomism]] and in the efforts of many people of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era to build a new [[Christian humanism]].
