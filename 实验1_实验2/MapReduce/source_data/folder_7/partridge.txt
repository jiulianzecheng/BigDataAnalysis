 The '''partridge''' is a medium sized [[bird]]. They are known as game birds because they are hunted and eaten by humans. They are in the [[Pheasant]] family ([[Phasianidae]]). 
 
 Partridges are in the song [[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)| " The Twelve Days of Christmas " ]]. The line  " ...and a Partridge in a [[pear]] [[tree]] "  is sung. 
 
 == Color and shape == 
 
 Most partridges are [[brown]], [[gray]] and [[white]]. They are camouflaged and difficult to see. They have short legs and short bills. Partridges are smaller than [[Pheasant]]s but they are bigger than [[Quail]]s. 
 
 Partridges can not fly very well and they do not [[migrate]]. This means they always stay in the same area all year round.  
 
 == Habitat == 
 
 Partridges live in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. They live in places such as [[moor]]s, [[grassland]] and [[farm]]land. They feed mostly on seeds, and [[nest]] on the ground. This means their nests are not very safe from [[predator]]s such as [[fox]]es. Partridges use their camouflage to make it difficult for [[predator]]s to see them and their nests.
