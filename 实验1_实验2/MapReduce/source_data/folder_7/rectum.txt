The '''rectum''' is a part of the [[large intestine]] which forms a part of the [[gastrointestinal system]]. The rectum ends in the [[anus]] which is the end of the [[gastrointestinal system]]. It is where [[feces]] or stools are stored temporarily before coming out of the [[anus]]. 
 
 [[Body temperature]] can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a [[medical thermometer]] not more than 25 & nbsp;mm (1 & nbsp;inch) into the rectum via the [[anus]]. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 & nbsp;°C (97.6 to 100.4 & nbsp;°F) and is about 0.5 & nbsp;°C (1 & nbsp;°F) above [[Oral sex|oral]] (mouth) temperature and about 1 & nbsp;°C (2 & nbsp;°F) above [[axillary|axilla]] (armpit) temperature and 3 degrees warmer than vaginal temperatures.
