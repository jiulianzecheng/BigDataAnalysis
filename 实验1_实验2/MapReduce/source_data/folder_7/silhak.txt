'''Silhak''' (실학) was a [[Korea]]n teaching. It was very famous in the [[Joseon|Joseun Dynasty]]. ''Sil'' means  " actual "  or  " practical, "  and ''hak'' means  " studies "  or  " learning " . It also meant  " practical learning " , like teaching how to [[farm]] and about [[economy]]. 
 
 == Creation == 
 Silhak was first made when the Joseon Dynasty was having a hard time, and after [[Japan]] had made [[war]] with them. The people of [[Korea]] were very [[poor]], and their [[economy|economical]] situation was not good. Also, all the farmland had grown [[wikt:barren|barren]] and it was very hard to farm. To prevent all of this trouble, instead of learning [[neo-Confucianism]], some [[philosopher]]s decided that a new education should be made to help the poor, and they named it Silhak.
