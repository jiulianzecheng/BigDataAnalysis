 The word '''data''' means  " known [[facts]] " . Data especially refers to [[number]]s, but can mean [[word]]s, [[sound]]s, and [[image]]s. [[Metadata]] is data about data. It is used to find data. 
 
 Originally, data is the plural of the [[Latin]] word ''datum,'' from ''dare,'' meaning  " give " . ''Datum'' is rarely used in English. So '''data''' often gets used as if it were a singular word. Some people like to say  " data are " , not  " data is " .
