A '''mat''' is a most likely flat object (normally soft) to wipe your feet/shoes off. It can also mean a few other things like a small piece of [[Cork (material)|cork]], card, or [[Textile|fabric]] placed on a table or other surface to protect it from the heat or moisture of an object placed on it. In a different form called [[matted]] it can mean almost completely different things.
