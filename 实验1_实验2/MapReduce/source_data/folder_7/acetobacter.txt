'''''Acetobacter''''' is a kind of [[bacteria]]. These bacteria are  
 known by their ability to change [[alcohol]] to [[acetic acid]] in the presence of [[air]]. There are several [[species]] within this [[genus]], and there are other bacteria that can form acetic acid under different conditions; but all of the ''Acetobacter'' are known by this ability. 
 
 == Why Acetobacter is important == 
 ''Acetobacter'' are important to people, because: 
 * they are used to make [[vinegar]] (intentionally converting the ethanol in the [[wine]] to acetic acid) 
 * they can destroy wine which it infects by producing big amounts of acetic acid or [[ethyl acetate]]. 
 
 Sometimes, ''Acetobacter'' is not wanted. It can be killed by adding [[Food preservation|preservatives]] like [[Sulfur dioxide]]s, or by getting rid of the [[air]] when the wine is stored.
