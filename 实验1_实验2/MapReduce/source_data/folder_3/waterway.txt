[[Image:Damnoensaduak97.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A floating market on one of Thailand's waterways]]A '''waterway''' is any body of [[water]] that can be used for [[transport]]ation by people in [[boat]]s. These include [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[ocean]]s, and [[canal]]s. 
 
 They must be wide and deep enough for the boats, and either have no waterfalls and rapids, or have ways for boats to get around them, such as [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s.
