'''Couleur''' (from [[French language|French]], in English ''[[colour]]'', or in the United States ''color'') is the word which is used for the headgear and ribbons worn by members of some [[Central Europe]]an [[student]] societies ([[Studentenverbindung]]en). 
 
 ==Ribbon== 
 {| 
 |- 
 |The ''[[ribbon]]'' (so called ''Band'') is worn over the right shoulder to the left hip. Both ends are held together by a [[button]], often made of [[metal]] or [[porcelain]]. A lot of societies have two types of ribbons. One is used by the new members (so called ''Fux'' or ''Fuchs'', after the German for  " fox " ), the other one is used by the elder members (so called ''Bursche'' or, if with degree, ''Alter Herr''). The ribbons of the elder members show the original or full colours of the society, where the ribbons of the new members often show a variation of them, such as displaying only two of the three main colours.
