 A '''whole tone''' means a distance of two semitones, i.e. the distance between two notes which are separated by one other note in pitch. 
 
 This is easy to see with a picture of a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]].  The distance between two white notes that are side by side may be a whole tone (if there is a black note in between them) or a semitone (if there is no black note between). 
 
 To go from a C to a C sharp (or D flat) is a semitone. 
 
 To go from a C sharp (or D flat) to a D is a semitone. 
 
 To go from a C to a D is a tone. 
 
 An [[octave]] is divided into twelve semitones.  These semitones are exactly equal in size. 
 
 Musical intervals are defined by a [[ratio]] of [[frequency|frequencies]]. An octave is a ratio of 2:1, so from 100 Hz to 200 Hz, and from 200 Hz to 400 Hz, are both octaves. A semitone is a ratio of the [[nth root|12th root of 2]] to 1, which is equal to 1.05946:1, so 1000 Hz and 1059.46 Hz are a semitone apart. A musical interval sounds better if the two notes have a small integer ratio. For this reason, it can be approximated by a ratio of 16:15 in [[just intonation]].
