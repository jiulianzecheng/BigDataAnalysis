 '''Frigg''' (or '''Frigga''') is the goddess of marriage, family, and motherhood in [[Norse mythology]]. She is the wife of [[Odin]] (chief of the [[Æsir]]), by whom she is the mother of [[Baldr]] and [[Höðr]], and stepmother of [[Thor]] (Odin's eldest son) and [[Vidar|Víðarr]]. Ruling [[Asgard]] as queen alongside the All-Father, Frigg often dwells in the dense, foggy lands of [[Fensalir]] ([[Old Norse]]: “Halls of Fen”) when her husband is away on one of his quests for knowledge; additionally, she is the only one besides Odin permitted to sit on his throne Hliðskjálf, and look out across the Nine Realms. Serving as Frigg's attendants are [[Eir]], the gods' doctor and goddess of healing, [[Hlín]] (a goddess of protection), [[Gná]] (a messenger goddess), and [[Fulla]] (a fertility goddess). It is unclear whether Frigg's companions and attendants are simply different aspects of Frigg herself (cf. [[avatar]]).
