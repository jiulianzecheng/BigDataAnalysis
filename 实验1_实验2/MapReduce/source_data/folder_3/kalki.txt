 '''Kalki''' is the final [[avatar]] or incarnation of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[deity|god]] [[Vishnu]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-10-31|title=Kalki Avatar - 10th Avatar of Lord Vishnu|url=https://rgyan.com/blogs/kalki-avatar/|access-date=2021-10-24|website=Rgyan|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Hindus believe that there are four stages of time. The stage of time we are in is called the [[Kali Yuga]]. In this stage of time, people are very bad. To make the world good, Kalki will come to [[Earth]], and will destroy the bad things and kill the bad people. People will change then, and become good people. A new stage of  will begin, called the [[Satya Yuga]] or the first stage of life. He is deciding to only come when everybody on Earth is very cruel. Kalki will come after [[Buddha]], his work is to punish people who not changed their behaviour even after Buddha taught the right way. Kalki will come within this millennium. He will take birth in [[India]]. Lord Kalki will be expected to incarnate on the Shukla Paksha Dwadashi Tithi(12th day of the bright fortnight) in the Hindu month Vaishakha. According to some beliefs, he will appear at the end of this Kali Yuga which is about 432,000 years away. 
 
 According to [[Nostradamus]] prophecies Kalki is the Chyren who will be king of whole world. He establish rightness in earth after defeating the whole world. He will punish bad people without mercy. It is said that he will be ruthless to cruel people. Kalki will establish a Golden Age within the Kali Yuga, before becoming king of the world. It is said that [[Krishna]] told [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield that right after his death, there will be the beginning of the Kali Yuga. He says 5000 years after his death (6000 B.C.) will come a Golden Age within the Kali Yuga. After the Kali Yuga Golden Age which will last approximately 10,000 years, he will establish the real Satya Yuga by defeating Kali (Demon) who is also known as the prince of evil in vedic scriptures. 
 
 The Shrimad Bhagwat Purana describes in detail the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. There is a description of Lord Kalki in the second chapter of the 12th wing of the same Purana. In which it is said that Lord Kalki will be born as a son in the house of an ascetic Brahmin named Vishnuyasha at a place called Shambhala in [[Moradabad]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Lord Kalki will destroy the sinners from the world by riding on a horse or vehicle named Devadatta and re-establish religion. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2011-10-16|title=Destroyer and deliverer: The true meaning of Vishnu's Kalki avatar-Ideas News , Firstpost|url=https://www.firstpost.com/ideas/the-last-horseman-the-true-meaning-of-vishnus-kalki-avatar-108561.html|access-date=2021-10-24|website=Firstpost|language=en}} < /ref >
