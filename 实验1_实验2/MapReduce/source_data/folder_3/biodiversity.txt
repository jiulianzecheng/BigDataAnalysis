 == The term == 
 The term '''biological diversity''' was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist Raymond F. Dasmann in 1968, < ref > 
 Dasmann R.F. 1968. ''A different kind of country''. MacMillan, New York.  {{ISBN|0-02-072810-7}} < /ref >  where he advocated [[conservation]]. It was widely adopted only in the 1980s. < ref > Soulé M.E. and B. A. Wilcox. 1980. ''Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective''. Sinauer. Sunderland, Massachusetts. < /ref > 
 
 The term '''biodiversity''' first appeared in a publication in 1988 when entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] used it as a title. < ref > Edward O.Wilson, editor, Frances M.Peter, associate editor 1988.

Retrieved 2006-04-26. < /ref >  Since then, the term has often been used by biologists, environmentalists, political leaders, and citizens. A similar term in the United States is  " natural heritage. "  It predates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation. Broader than biodiversity, it includes [[geology]] and [[landform]]s. 
 
 == Definitions == 
 Biologists most often define biodiversity as the  " totality of [[gene]]s, species, and ecosystems of a region " . < ref name= " Larsson2001 " > {{cite book|author=Tor-Björn Larsson|title=Biodiversity evaluation tools for European forests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeTU8QauENcC & pg=PA178|accessdate=28 June 2011|year=2001|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-87-16-16434-6|page=178}} < /ref >  An advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances. There are three levels at which biological variety can been identified: 
 
 *[[species]] diversity 
 *[[ecosystem]] diversity 
 *[[variation|genetic diversity]]. 
 
 == Threats == 
 The idea can be used for tackling practical problems in [[conservation]], for example: 
 *[[extinction|loss of species]] 
 *destruction of [[habitat]]s 
 *introduced and [[invasive species]] 
 *genetic pollution 
 *[[Over-harvesting|over-exploitation]] 
 *effect of [[climate change]]
