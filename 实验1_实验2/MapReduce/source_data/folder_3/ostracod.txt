 '''Ostracods''' are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of the [[Crustacea]]. They are often called '''seed shrimps''' because of their appearance.  
 
 Some 65,000 species (13,000 of which are living) have been identified. < ref > Brusca R.C. and G.J. 2002. ''Invertebrates''. < /ref >   
 
 Ostracods are small crustaceans, typically around {{convert|1|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in size, but varying from {{convert|0.2|mm|in}} to {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the case of ''Gigantocypris''.  
 
 Their bodies are flattened from side to side and protected by a [[bivalve]]-like, [[chitin]]ous or [[calcareous]] valve or  " shell " . The hinge of the two valves is in the upper ([[dorsal]]) region of the body. 
 
 Marine ostracods live in the [[zooplankton]]. Others live in the [[benthos]], on or in the upper layer of the sea floor.  
 
 Many ostracods are also found in fresh water. [[Land|Terrestrial]] species of ''Mesocypris'' are known from [[humid]] [[forest]] [[soil]]s of [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]]. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bio11Tuat02-t1-body-d1.html |journal=Tuatara |volume=11 |issue=2|year=1963 |title=The Terrestrial Plankton |author=J. D. Stout |pages=57–65}} < /ref >  They have a wide range of [[diet]]s, and the group includes [[carnivore]]s, [[herbivore]]s, [[scavenger]]s, and [[filter]] feeders. 
 
 Copepods may not be [[monophyletic]]. < ref > {{cite book |author=Richard A. Fortey  &  Richard H.
