 '''Cuba''' is an island country in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The country is made up of the big [[island]] of Cuba, the [[Isla de la Juventud]] island (''Isle of Youth''), and many [[archipelagos|smaller islands]]. [[Havana]] is the capital city of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest cities are [[Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Las Villas]]. In Spanish, the capital is called  " La Habana " . Cuba is near the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]]. People from Cuba are called Cubans (''cubanos'' in Spanish). The official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Cuba is warm all year. 
 
 In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. After the war, it was part of the [[United States]]. It gained independence in 1902. 
 
 In 1959, guerrilla fighters led by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] overthrew Cuba's dictator, [[Fulgencio Batista]], in what became the Cuban Revolution. Castro began making relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and tried to close a lot of American businesses in Cuba; the [[United States]] did not like this. In 1961 Castro officially announced that his government was socialist. The US attempted to [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|invade Cuba]] to regain control of it and overthrow its communist-led government but failed. The [[Communist Party of Cuba]] was created in 1965 and has ruled the island ever since. Today, Cuba is the only socialist state outside of [[Asia]], in the [[Caribbean]], and in the [[western hemisphere]]. 
 
 == Culture == 
 Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the [[Salsa]] and [[Mambo]]. Because Cubans have ancestors from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different. 
 
 Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love [[music]] and [[sport]]s. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms. [[Baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] events are loved by many Cuban people. The Chiefs football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quarter-final and lost against [[Sweden]] 0:8. < ref name= " lifepac " / >

 === Early history === 
 Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks, which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later, he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them. 
 
 The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of [[sugar]]. In the early 1800s, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent [[republic]] in [[1902]]. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the [[Platt Amendment]]. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba’s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt. 
 
 In addition to political control, the United States also exercised significant control over the Cuban economy. At the time, Cuba was a [[monoculture]] economy. While they produced coffee, tobacco, and rice, they relied primarily on sugar. Thus, they were known by other countries as the  " sugar bowl of the world. " < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/wais/Cuba/cuba_NoLongerSugarBowl(100203).html|title=Cuba no longer the Sugar Bowl of the World 10.02.03|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-01-14|archive-date=2017-06-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613084246/http://web.stanford.edu/group/wais/Cuba/cuba_NoLongerSugarBowl(100203).html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The United States bought sugar from the Republic of Cuba at a price higher than the global standard. In exchange, Cuba was to give preference to the United States, and its industries. Cuba depended on the United States and their investments. Cuba was not industrialized and needed the revenue for goods and oil. They also needed the US investment for gas, electricity, communications, railways, and banks. While Cuban workers had better conditions than other countries in the continent, they still faced inequality, lack of infrastructure, high illiteracy rates, and a lack of full-time work (the sugar industry was seasonal). 
 
 === Cuban Revolution === 
 In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] led a revolution against [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Castro took power in Cuba with [[Che Guevara]] from [[Argentina]], his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The [[Soviet Union]] put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the ''[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]''. The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey. 
 
 Cuba became a [[communist]]-led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in [[Africa]] to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries. 
 
 However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power. 
 
 In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island. 
 
 In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though [[Fidel Castro]] had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2018, [[Miguel Díaz-Canel]] became the official President of Cuba. 
 
 In April 2015, historic talks took place with US [[President Obama]] and Cuban [[Raúl Castro|General Secretary Raúl Castro]] in improving relations between the two nations. 
 
 The trade embargo issued by [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy]] in the 1960s has been considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via [[Mexico]] if they wanted to go to Cuba. Americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke [[Cuban cigars]]. The cigars are smuggled over the US-Canadian border since they are legal in [[Canada]]. 
 
 For military service, men from the age of 17 to 28 years old must go into the army for two years. < ref name= " factbook " > {{Cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html|title = CIA - The World Factbook -- Cuba|work = cia.gov|accessdate = 17 July 2017|archive-date = 18 December 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201218051736/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html|url-status = dead}} < /ref >  It is optional for women. 
 
 In July 2021, there were demonstrations against the government. See the English Wikipedia article, 2021 Cuban protests, for details.

 == Demographics == 
 The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the [[barracoon]]) as [[New World]] slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is: 
 * [[European people|European]] Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of [[Spain]], but the most numerous were the [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]], [[Andalusia]]ns, and Catalans. There was as well some [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[England|English]] peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the western part of Cuba, specially cities like [[Havana]] and [[Pinar de Rio Providence|Pinar del Rio]]. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others. 
 * [[Africa]]ns and [[Mulatto]] Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of [[Africa]] but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 [[Haiti]]ans that came to Cuba during the [[Haitian Revolution]] days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the [[Kongo]] and [[Yoruba]] tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. [[Afro-Cuban]]s range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion ([[Santeria]]), and customs to the Cuban culture. 
 * [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of [[Moor]] blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like [[Guantanamo Bay]]. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies. 
 
 == Health and education == 
 Cuba is a [[developing country]], and is often depicted as a very [[Poverty|poor]] country. In some aspect however, like [[education]], [[health care]] and [[life expectancy]] it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America. < ref name= " Harvard " > [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] The Cuban Paradox < /ref >  Its [[infant death rate]] is lower than some developed countries. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2011-09-30 |archive-date=2018-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207062332/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The average life expectancy is 78 years. < ref name=factbook/ >

 In 2006, the [[World Food Programme]] certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children. In the same year, the [[United Nations]] said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]]. < ref > {{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 {{see also|List of cities in Cuba}} 
 [[File:Tobacco field cuba1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tobacco field in Pinar del Río.]] 
 Cuba is the largest island in the [[West Indies]]. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a mostly warm and humid climate that makes it a great place for growing crops. 
 
 Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the [[sugar cane]]. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is [[tobacco]]. Tobacco is made into [[cigar]]s by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world. < ref name= " lifepac " > {{cite book|last=Buskey|first=Theresa|title=History and Geography|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781580951586|editor=Alan Christopherson, M.S.|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|location=804 N. 2nd Ave. E., Rock Rapids|series=LIFEPAC|date=March 2001|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781580951586/page/11 11]|isbn=978-1-58095-158-6|accessdate=14 April 2010|language=English}} < /ref >  Other important crops are [[rice]], [[coffee]], and [[fruit]]. Cuba also has many minerals. [[Cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]] are all on the island. Salt, [[petroleum]], and natural gas are there too. < ref name= " lifepac " / >  The coast of Cuba has many [[bay]]s and a few good harbors. Havana, which is the capital, is also a [[Harbour|port]]. Other harbors have port cities. Nuevitas is a port city on the north [[coast]]. Cienfuegos, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cuba are some of the port cities on the south coast. 
 
 Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it from becoming hot, despite it being in the tropical zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, most of Cuba's port cities can be flooded along the coast. < ref name= " lifepac " / >
