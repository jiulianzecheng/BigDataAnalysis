 The '''cervix''' is the bottom part of the womb ([[uterus]]) of the [[female reproductive system]]. The cervix is about 1 inch long. It is in the shape of a cylinder. The shape changes during [[pregnancy]]. There is a thin, central [[cervical canal]] that runs through its length. This canal connects the womb and the [[vagina]]. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Myers KM, Feltovich H, Mazza E, Vink J, Bajka M, Wapner RJ, Hall TJ, House M | display-authors = 6 | title = The mechanical role of the cervix in pregnancy | journal = Journal of Biomechanics | volume = 48 | issue = 9 | pages = 1511–1523 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25841293 | pmc = 4459908 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.02.065 | series = Reproductive Biomechanics }} < /ref >  The opening into the uterus is called the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]]. The opening into the vagina is called the [[external os]]. The lower part of the cervix bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been written about since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], over 2,000 years ago.
