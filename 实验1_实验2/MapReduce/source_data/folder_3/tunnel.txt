 A '''tunnel''' is an underground passage. Some tunnels are used for [[car]]s, and others are used for [[Railway|trains]]. Sometimes, a tunnel is used for movement of [[ship]]s. Some tunnels are built for [[communication]] cables and some are built for [[electricity]] cables. Other tunnels are built for animals. < ref > [http://www.google.com/images?client=flock & channel=fds & q=tunnel & oe=utf-8 & um=1 & ie=UTF-8 & source=univ & sa=X & ei=KGp5TeyKNM-OrQHP9cD9BQ & ved=0CEYQsAQ & biw=984 & bih=514 Images for tunnels] < /ref > [[File:Milford Tunnel.jpg|thumb|North portal of Milford railway tunnel, [[England]].]]

 Tunnels are dug in different kinds of [[ground]]s, from soft [[sand]] to hard [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. The way of digging is chosen by the type of ground. There are two additional ways of digging : [[quarry]] and 'cut and cover'. In quarry, the tunnel path is drilled in a horizontal way. 
 This system requires a deep tunnel that's built in a firm rock. In the 'cut and cover' system, a tunnel is dug in the ground and, afterwards, a [[roof]] is built above the tunnel. This system fits tunnels that are close to the ground like road tunnels and [[infrastructure]]. 
 
 Building tunnels is a large [[civil engineering]] project that could cost very high sums of money. The planning and building of a long tunnel may take many years. 
 
 The [[Channel Tunnel]] between [[France]] and [[England]] is one of the longest tunnels in the world. It is 50 kilometers long. The longest tunnel in the world, the ''Gotthard Base Tunnel'', is being dug in [[Switzerland]]. 
 
 == Reasons to build a tunnel == 
 * A [[Rapid transit|subway]] is based on a network of tunnels that are dug underground so the trains will not disturb and will not be disturbed by the local transport. 
 * On the path of a [[railway track|railroad track]] or a [[road]] a tunnel is dug when the lane encounters an obstacle such as a [[mountain]] to avoid bypassing the obstacle. 
 * A tunnel is built sometimes to overcome a [[water]] obstacle as a replacement for building a [[bridge]] above it. 
 * A tunnel is built to connect between [[military]] posts so the movement between them will not be visible for the enemy. 
 * A tunnel is built for infrastructure like electricity cables, water, communication and sewerage to avoid damage and disruption above ground. 
 * Some tunnels are used by [[prisoner]]s to escape [[jail]]. 
 * Sometimes tunnels are used by [[criminal]]s to do a bank robbery (e.g. in [[Brazil]], Summer 2005). 
 
 ==Cut-and-cover==

 '''Cut-and-cover''' is a simple way of making hollow tunnels where a [[trench]] is hollowed out and [[roof]]ed over with an overhead support system strong enough to carry the load of what is to be built above the tunnel.{{sfn|Ellis|2015|p=118}} 
 Two basic forms of cut-and-cover tunneling are available: 
 * ''Bottom-up method'': A trench is hollowed out, with ground support when needed, and the tunnel is built in it. In earliest days bricks were used. The trench is then carefully filled and the surface is reinstated. 
 * ''Top-down method'': Side support walls and capping beams are made from ground level by such methods as [[slurry wall]]ing or neighbouring bored piling. Only a hollowed out excavation is needed to construct the tunnel roof using beams or in situ concrete sitting on the walls. The surface is then remade except for access openings. This allows early recreation of roadways, services, and other surface features. Excavation then takes place under the permanent tunnel roof, and the base slab is made.
