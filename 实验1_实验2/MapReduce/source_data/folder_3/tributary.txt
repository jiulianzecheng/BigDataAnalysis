 A '''tributary''' of a [[river]] is another river that [[Flux|flows]] into it. If one river flows into a second river, then the first river is a '''tributary''' of the second river. A tributary is a body of water that flows into another body of water. 
 
 The opposite of a tributary is a distributary. A distributary is a  river that branches off from the main flow of water, for example in a [[river delta]].
