 '''Endemism''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] word meaning that a plant or animal lives only in a particular location, such as a specific island, [[habitat]] type, nation or other defined zone. For example, many species of [[lemur]] are endemic to the island of [[Madagascar]].  
 
 There are two types of endemism - paleoendemism and neoendemism. ''Paleoendemism'' means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area. ''Neoendemism'' means that a species has recently appeared which is closely related to the main species or one that has formed following [[hybrid]]ization and is now classified as a separate species. This is a common process in plants especially those which exhibit [[polyploidy]]. 
 
 The opposite of endemism is [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. 
 
 Endemic types are most likely to develop on islands because they are isolated. This includes remote island groups, like the [[Hawaiian Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and [[Yemen|Socotra]]. Endemism can also occur in areas which are separated from other similar areas like the highlands of [[Ethiopia]], or large bodies of water like [[Lake Baikal]]. 
 
 Endemics can easily become [[Endangered species|endangered]] or [[extinction|extinct]] because of only living in a small area. They are also [[wikt:vulnerable|vulnerable]] to the actions of man, including the [[introduced species|introduction]] of new organisms. There were millions of both [[Bermuda petrel]]s and  " [[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedars]] "  (actually [[juniper]]s) in [[Bermuda]] when it was settled at the start of the 17th century. By the end of the century, the petrels were thought to be extinct. Cedars, whose numbers were low as a result of centuries of [[shipbuilding]], were nearly made extinct in the 20th Century by the introduction of a parasite. Both petrels and cedars are very rare today, as are other species endemic or native to Bermuda. 
 
 Endemic organisms are not the same as [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous organisms]] — a species that is indigenous to somewhere may be native to other locations as well. An [[introduced species]], also known as a naturalized or exotic species, is an organism that is not indigenous to a given place or area. 
 
 == Ecoregions with high endemism == 
 According to the [[World Wildlife Fund]], the following [[ecoregion]]s have the highest percentage of endemic plants:

 == Threats to highly endemistic regions == 
 
 Some of the principal threats to these special ecosystems are: 
 
 * Large scale [[logging]] operations 
 * [[Slash-and-burn]] techniques (which are sometimes a part of [[shifting cultivation]]) 
 * Destruction of habital or vegetation leads to endangering of the endemic species
