 '''Drenthe''' (pronounce:  " DREN-te " ) is a [[province]] in the northeast of the [[Netherlands]]. The capital city is [[Assen]]. South of it is [[Overijssel]], west of it is [[Friesland]] and north of it is [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. East of it is [[Lower Saxony]], that is a part of [[Germany]]. About 495,000 people are living in Drenthe (2021). 
 
 == History == 
 Thousands of years ago, there were already people in Drenthe. Around [[3500 BC]] people made [[dolmen]]s (''hunebedden''), piles of big stones. 53 of the 54 dolmens in the Netherlands are in Drenthe. Most of them are in the northeast of the province. 
 
 The oldest paper with the name Drenthe on it is from [[820]]. It was called ''Pago Treanth'' (district Drenthe). Papers from [[1024]] and [[1025]] show that is was a county at that time.  
 
 From [[1046]] until [[1528]], the [[bishop]]s of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] ruled over Drenthe. From [[1581]] until [[1795]] it was part of the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces]], but Drenthe itself was not a province. In [[1796]], under the [[Batavian Republic]], Drenthe was a province for the first time. 
 
 In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[nazi]]s build a [[concentration camp]] near [[Westerbork]]. From there, they put Dutch [[Jew]]s on the train to other camps in [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]. In the last train from Westerbork was also [[Anne Frank]]. She was a [[Jew]]ish girl and she wrote a [[diary]]. She died in the [[concentration camp]] [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in Germany. After the war her diary became world famous.
