 A '''centrifuge''' is a device with a [[motor]] in it, which is used to spin an object with high speed. This high speed spinning forces the object outwards. This force is used for several purposes: 
 
 * a '''uranium centrifuge''' is used to separate two [[isotope]]s of [[uranium]] (named U-235 and U-238) from each other; < ref > {{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/uranium-centrifuge.htm|title=What's a uranium centrifuge?|publisher = HowStuffWorks|accessdate=2007-07-24}} < /ref > 
 * in medical [[Laboratory|laboratories]], [[serum]] is separated from the [[blood]] samples using a centrifuge; 
 * in chemical laboratories, centrifuges are used to subtract [[solid]] parts of an [[emulsion]] from its [[liquid]] parts. 
 * large centrifuges are used by [[NASA]] to expose [[astronaut]]s to high forces for their training. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-centrifuge.htm|title = What is a Centrifuge?|accessdate = 2007-07-24}} < /ref >
