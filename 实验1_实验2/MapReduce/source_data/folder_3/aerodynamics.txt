'''Aerodynamics''' means studying how [[air]] (or [[gas]]) travels around something moving through it. Streamlining to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in [[vehicle]]s is a major field in aerodynamics. [[Aircraft]] design is another. < ref > A Dictionary of Aviation, David W. Wragg.

 The study of gases that are not in motion is called [[aerostatics]]. 
 
 Aerodynamics comes from Aero (Air), and [[Dynamics]] (Moving). 
 
 For aircraft, [[lift (force)]] is the force pushing up. [[Gravity]] is the force pushing down. If lift is stronger than [[gravity]] the plane goes up. If gravity is stronger than lift, the plane goes down. In planes, lift is caused by airflow. Airplane wings are designed in such a way that, the air [[molecule]]s prefer moving under the wing rather than above it, so as a result there is more air flowing underneath the [[wing]] compared to above it. This [[movement|motion]] of the air gives upward lift to the aircraft. ''See [[Bernoulli's principle]].''    
 
 Thrust and drag govern forward motion.  [[Thrust]] is the force pushing forward, and drag is the force pushing backward.  Thrust is usually made by either [[propeller]]s or [[jet engine|jets]].  [[Drag (physics)|Drag]] is the force pushing backward.  Most drag is caused by air [[friction]].
