 The '''trogons''' and '''[[quetzals]]''' are [[bird]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Trogoniformes''' which has only one family, the '''Trogonidae'''. There are 39 living [[species]] in seven [[genus|genera]]. 
 
 The [[fossil]] record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the mid-[[Eocene]]. The word  " trogon "  is [[greek language|Greek]] for  " nibbling "  and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests. 
 
 Trogons are residents of [[tropical forests]] worldwide. The greatest [[biodiversity|diversity]] is in the [[Neotropics]], where four genera, with 24 species occur. The genus ''Apaloderma'' has the three [[Africa]]n species. The genera ''Harpactes'' and ''Apalharpactes'', with twelve species, live in southeast Asia. < ref name =HBW > Collar N.J. 2001.

 They feed on [[insect]]s and [[fruit]]. Their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and [[arboreal]] habits. Although their flight is fast, they do not fly long distances. Trogons are generally not [[migration|migratory]]. They have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They are the only type of animal with a [[bird feet#Heterodactyly|heterodactyl]] toe arrangement. They nest in holes dug into trees or termite nests, laying 2–4 white or pastel-coloured eggs.
