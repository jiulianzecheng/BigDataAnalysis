'''Bail''' is money given to the court to guarantee that someone will go to their trial. If the person does not show up for their [[trial]], the [[government]] gets to keep the [[money]]. 
 
 If the arrested person cannot afford the full bail amount, they can use a '''bail bond'''. This is a system where part of the bail amount is paid to a company, and they do the bail paperwork. Unlike placing the full bail to the court, the bail bond payment is not returned. 
 
 If someone uses a bail bond company, and they do not show up for their court appearance (these people are known as  " bail jumpers " ) a bounty hunter can be hired to track them down and bring them back.
