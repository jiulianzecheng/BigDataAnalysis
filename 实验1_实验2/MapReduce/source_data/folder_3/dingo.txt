 The '''dingo''' is a [[dog]] found in [[Australia]] and South-East Asia. They are not found in [[Tasmania]], where the sea levels cut the island off from mainland Australia about 10,000 years ago. < ref > Jackson, Stephen; Groves, Colin 2015.

 The earliest known dingo remains was found in [[Western Australia]]. It dates to 3,450 years ago. However, the [[Gene|genes]] show that the dingo reached Australia 8,300 years ago. The humans which brought them are unknown.  Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years: this suggests that [[artificial selection]] has not been done over this period. < ref > Smith, Bradley P.; Cairns, Kylie M.; Adams, Justin W.; Newsome, Thomas M.; Fillios, Melanie; Déaux, Eloïse C.; Parr, William C.H.; Letnic, Mike; Van Eeden, Lily M.; Appleby, Robert G.; Bradshaw, Corey J.

 == Description == 
 Dingos (or Dingoes) are usually between 117 & nbsp;cm to 124 & nbsp;cm in length. Their tail is about 30 & nbsp;cm in length. They usually weigh between 10 & nbsp;kg and 20 & nbsp;kg. The colour of their fur is usually yellow-ginger, but can sometimes include tan, black, white or sandy colours. They live for about 14 years. 
 
 Dingos live in packs of between 3 and 12, but they can be seen alone as well. The leaders are the alpha male and the alpha female and are usually the only pair to breed. Young dingos are called  " cubs " . The breeding season is in March and April. After a [[gestation]] of 63 days, the adult females usually give birth to 4-5 cubs in a litter. < ref > Smith, Bradley ed. 2015. ''The dingo debate: origins, behaviour and conservation''. CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne, Australia. ISBN 978-1-4863-0030-3 < /ref >  Mothers will [[regurgitate]] food for the cubs to eat. < ref name=af/ >  They become independent of their mother after four to eight months of age. 
 
 Dingos do not bark like other dogs, but they do howl. < ref name= " af " > {{cite web|url=http://www.australianfauna.com/dingo.php|title=Australian Dingo|accessdate=2009-11-14|archive-date=2009-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218082203/http://www.australianfauna.com/dingo.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Diet == 
 Dingos are [[carnivore]]s and eat other animals such as [[kangaroo]]s, [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[wallaroo]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[sheep]], [[calf|calves]], [[poultry]] and [[carrion]]. It believed to have hunted several animal [[species]] to [[extinction]] including some species of [[bandicoot]]s and rat kangaroos. They often hunt in packs. 
 
 == Managing dingos == 
 While some people keep dingos as pets, they are regarded as a pest by farmers. They are controlled by trapping, shooting, poisoning (with [[sodium monofluoroacetate]]), and fences. < ref name=decc/ >  The dingo fence which runs through [[South Australia]], and then along the [[New South Wales]] border through to central [[Queensland]] is the world's longest fence. < ref name=decc/ >  Dingos are protected in national parks and reserves. 
 
 It is illegal to have a dingo as a pet in South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. In Victoria and the Northern Territory you have to have a special permit to keep a dingo. < ref name= " abc " > {{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/creaturefeatures/facts/dingoes.htm|title=Dingoes|date=2009|work=Creature Features|publisher=ABC|language=English|accessdate=2009-11-14}} < /ref >  The dingo can be a dangerous animal: they have attacked people at times.
