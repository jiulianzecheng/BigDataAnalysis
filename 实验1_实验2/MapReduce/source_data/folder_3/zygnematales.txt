 The '''Zygnematales''' also called the '''Conjugales''', are an order of [[green algae]], comprising several thousand different species in genera such as the well-known ''Zygnema'' and ''[[Spirogyra]]''. All the members of this group develop into unbranched filaments, one cell thick, which grow longer through normal [[cell]] division. Most live in [[Fresh water|freshwater]], and form an important component of the algal scum that grows on or near plants, rocks, and various debris.
