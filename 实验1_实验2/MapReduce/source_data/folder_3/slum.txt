 A '''slum''' is a part of a [[city]] or a [[town]] where many [[poverty|poor]] people live. It is a place where people may not have basic needs, such as [[running water]], [[electricity]], [[toilet]]s, [[telephone]]s, etc. Some of these people may also have social disadvantages, such as [[unemployment]], no [[:wikt:access|access]] to [[education]], no access to [[health care]], no [[municipality|municipal]] [[:wikt:service|services]], etc. There are slums in most of the big cities of [[developing countries]] and [[Less Developed Countries|least developed countries]] (which are also [[:wikt:label|labelled]] as the  " [[Third World]] " ). They may not be called ''slum'', however; see [[shanty town]]. 
 
 ==Victorian London== 
 [[Charles Dickens]] was a great author of [[Victorian]] [[London]]. His account of the St Giles '''rookery''' was: 
 : " Wretched houses with broken windows patched with rags and paper; every room let out to a different family, and in many instances to two or even three – fruit and ‘sweetstuff’ manufacturers in the cellars, barbers and red-herring vendors in the front parlours, cobblers in the back; a bird-fancier in the first floor, three families on the second, starvation in the attics, Irishmen in the passage, a ‘musician’ in the front kitchen, a charwoman and five hungry children in the back one – filth everywhere – a gutter before the houses, and a drain behind – clothes drying, and slops emptying from the windows; (…) men and women, in every variety of scanty and dirty apparel, lounging, scolding, drinking, smoking, squabbling, fighting, and swearing " .
