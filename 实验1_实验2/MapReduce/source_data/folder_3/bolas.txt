 '''Bolas''' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''bola'',  " ball " , also known as ''boleadoras'') are a throwing [[weapon]] made of weights on the ends of interconnected [[:wikt:cord|cords]], designed to capture animals by [[wikt:tangle|entangling]] their legs. They are used by the [[gaucho]]s in [[South America]] today, but have been found in [[excavation]]s of pre-Hispanic [[Human settlement|settlements]], especially in [[Patagonia]], where indigenous peoples used them to catch [[guanaco]] and [[ñandu]].

 Gauchos use boleadoras to capture running [[cattle]] or [[game]]. The thrower gives the balls [[momentum]] by swinging them and then releases the boledoras. The weapon is usually used to entangle the animal's legs, but when thrown with enough force might even break the bone. 
 
 == Design == 
 There is no uniform design; most bolas have two or three balls, but there are versions of up to 8 or 9 balls. Some bolas have balls of equal weight, others vary the knot and cord. Gauchos use bolas made of [[leather]] cords with [[wood]]en balls or small leather sacks full of stones at the ends of the cords. 
 
 Bolas can be named depending on the amount of weights used: 
 * Perdida (1 weight) 
 * Avestrucera or ñanducera (2 weights) 
 * Boleadora (3 weights) 
 * Ka-Lum-Ik-Toun ([[Inuit]] name for bolas with 10 or more weights)
