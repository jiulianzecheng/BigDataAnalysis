 '''Ventnor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|ɛ|n|t|n|ər}}) is a [[seaside resort]] and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] on the [[south]] coast of the [[Isle of Wight]], [[England]]. It was established in the [[Victorian era]]. < ref name=Else296 > David Else; Oliver Berry, ''England'' (Oakland, CA: Lonely Planet Pub., 2009), p. 296 < /ref >  Ventnor lies underneath [[St Boniface Down]]. At {{convert|241|m}} it is the highest point on the Isle of Wight. Ventnor is built on steep slopes and [[cliff]]s leading down to the [[sea]]. < ref name=Else296/ >  The higher part is called Upper Ventnor. The lower part is simply known as Ventnor. Ventnor is sometimes understood as including the coastal villages of [[St Lawrence, Isle of Wight|St. Lawrence]] to one side and [[Bonchurch]] to the other. 
 
 The [[shelter]]ed location on the cliff of the Island's south coast means the area experiences a [[microclimate]]. < ref name=Curtis75 > Paul Curtis, ''Walking on the Isle of Wight'' (Milnthorpe: Cicerone Press, 2013), p. 75 < /ref >  It has more [[sun]]ny days than much of the [[British Isles]], and fewer [[frost]]s. This has allowed many [[species]] of [[subtropical]] plant to grow here. [[Ventnor Botanic Garden]] is particularly notable. < ref name=Curtis75/ >
