 '''Qeqqata''' ({{IPA-all|qeqːata}}, ''The Center'', {{lang-da|Centrum}}) is a [[municipality]] in western [[Greenland]]. It was created on 1 January 2009. The municipality was named  " Qeqqata "  because it is in the central-western part of Greenland. < ref > [http://www.qeqqata.gl/Info/tabid/55/language/en-US/Default.aspx Qeqqata Kommunia, municipal page]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Its population is 9,378 as of January 2020. < ref name= " stat1 " > {{cite web|title = Population by Localities|url = https://bank.stat.gl/pxweb/en/Greenland/Greenland__BE__BE01__BE0120/BEXST4.PX/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=27d6ab46-03f8-43bd-868c-24a2a5a0a8e0|publisher = Statistical Greenland|access-date = 7 April 2020|archive-date = 26 July 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200726135012/https://bank.stat.gl/pxweb/en/Greenland/Greenland__BE__BE01__BE0120/BEXST4.PX/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=27d6ab46-03f8-43bd-868c-24a2a5a0a8e0|url-status = dead}} < /ref >  The [[administrative center]] of the municipality is in [[Sisimiut]] (which used to be called Holsteinsborg). 
 
 ==Creation== 
 Qeqqata was created on 1 January 2009. [[Kangerlussuaq]] and two older municipalities of western Greenland, [[Maniitsoq Municipality]] and [[Sisimiut Municipality]], were combined to make Qeqqata. Kangerlussuaq used to be [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]], which means that it was not a part of any municipality. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Most of the [[Human settlement|settlement]]s and [[trade]] in Qeqqata are along the [[coast]]. 
 
 Qeqqata borders [[Sermersooq]] municipality in the south and in the east. In the north, it borders the [[Qeqertalik]] municipality. The [[Davis Strait]], which separates Greenland from [[Baffin Island]], is to the west. It has an area of {{convert|115500|km2|mi2|1|abbr=on}}. This makes it it the second-smallest municipality of Greenland, after [[Kujalleq]]. 
 
 ==Politics== 
 Qeqqata's municipal council has 15 members. They are elected every four years. < ref > [https://qeqqata.gl/Emner/Politik/Kommunalbestyrelsen?sc_lang=da#x5b9676cacdd74bdfb0d4b06cbcc4b943 Qeqqata.gl]  " Kommunalbestyrelsen " < /ref >

 There are no [[road]]s between settlements. This is the same in all of Greenland. There are three [[airport]]s in Qeqqata: [[Kangerlussuaq Airport|Kangerlussuaq]], [[Maniitsoq Airport|Maniitsoq]] and [[Sisimiut Airport|Sisimiut]]. Kangerlussuaq is the international hub for Greenland. Other settlements have boats that take people to them. 
 
 A simple road for terrain [[vehicle]]s between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut was approved in June 2020. The first 21 & nbsp;km of the road, which connecting Kangerlussuaq with the [[Tasersuaq]] area, will be built in July 2020. < ref > [https://www.arctictoday.com/greenlands-first-road-project-connecting-settlements-clears-its-last-hurdle/ Greenland’s first road project connecting settlements clears its last hurdle] < /ref > < ref > [https://polarjournal.ch/en/2020/06/24/first-overland-road-project-between-greenlandic-towns/ First overland road project between Greenlandic towns] < /ref >
