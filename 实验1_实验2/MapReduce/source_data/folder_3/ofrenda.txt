 An '''''ofrenda''''' (Spanish:  " [[Sacrifice|offering]] " ) is a collection of objects placed on a display during the annual and traditionally Mexican ''[[Día de Muertos]]'' celebration.  An ''ofrenda'', which can be large is usually created for an individual person who has died and is intended to welcome them. They are filled with the deceased personal objects, picture of the person and food. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/coco-pixar-ofrenda-explained-details/ | title=Coco: The Importance of the Ofrenda Explained | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=September 2017 }} < /ref >
