 ''Not to be confused with [[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve]]'' 
 
 '''Lihou''' ({{IPA-en|ˈliːuː|}}) is a small [[tidal island]] (95 [[vergée]]s; 38½ [[acre]]s; 15.6 [[hectare]]s) that is part of the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], [[Channel Islands]]. It lies off the west coast of [[Guernsey]] and is the most westerly point in the Channel Islands. Coordinates: {{coord|49|27|38.16|N|2|40|4.44|W|}}. The island was bought by the States of Guernsey in January 1995. Lihou is connected to Guernsey at low [[tide]] by an ancient stone [[causeway]] between the island and L'Eree headland. It is part of the Parish of [[St Peter's, Guernsey|St. Peter's]]. Lihou's bird and marine life makes it an important [[conservation area]].

 ==History== 
 [[Image:GU020, Lihou.jpg|left|250px]] 
 Like many other [[Channel Islands]], Lihou's name contains the [[Norman language]] suffix  " ''[[-hou]]'' "  of [[Old Norse]] origin. 
 
 The island has the ruins of the [[priory]] of St. Mary which is believed to have been set up by [[Benedictine]] monks in the 12th century. The monks of the priory were not very popular with the local people, who thought they were [[devil worship]]pers. < ref > ''Folklore of Guernsey'', De Garis, Guernsey 1975 < /ref >   This animosity may be due to the monks' insistence on [[Jus naufragii|rights of wreck]].  Until 1415 it was under the control of [[Mont Saint Michel]] and then [[Eton College]] until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] when it was closed and fell into disrepair. 
 
 The house on Lihou was used for target practice by heavy artillery during the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation of the Channel Islands]] during [[World War II]].  It has now been rebuilt as accommodation for school groups, and is used as an educational resource. 
 
 ''[[Vraic]]'' ([[seaweed]]) was harvested and dried on frames set up on the beach. A 1927 factory building produced [[iodine]] from seaweed. All traces of the industry disappeared during the [[German Occupation]]. 
 
 The Lihou family name is included in parish records which go back as far as the early 15th century and there are a number of groups who study the ancestry of the Lihou's. More recently a group was set up using the social networking site 'Facebook' which links Lihou's around the world.
