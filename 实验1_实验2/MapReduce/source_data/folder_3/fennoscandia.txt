 Fennoscandia is different to both [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Nordic countries]]. [[Denmark]] is not in the Scandinavian Peninsula and Karelia and the Kola Peninsula are not a part of the Nordic countries. They are a part of [[Russia]]. The [[geography]] of Fennoscandia is very [[mountain|mountainous]] and rough. It is also very beautiful with sights such as [[fjords]], which take up a lot of space in Norway. Socially Fennoscandia shows the historically close relationship between the [[Finns|Finnish]], [[Norwegians|Norwegian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Sámi]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] people.  It also  includes the [[Karelia]] area which until near the end of the [[Second World War]] was part of Finland.  Until 1956 much of the area was a [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Republic]] and it remains an administrative division of [[Russia]].
