 The '''eye''' is a round organ for '''sensing''' [[light]] so organisms can see. It is the first part of the [[visual system]]. About 97 percent of animal [[species]] have eyes. < ref name= " Land1992 " > {{cite journal

 In [[mammal]]s, two kinds of cells, ''rods'' and ''cones'', allow sight by sending signals through the [[optic nerve]] to the brain. 
 
 Some animals can see light that humans cannot see. They can see [[ultraviolet]] or [[infrared]] light. 
 
 The lens on the front part of the eye acts like a [[camera]] lens. It can be pulled flatter by [[muscle]]s inside the eye, or allowed to become rounder. As some people get older, they may not be able to do this perfectly. Many people are born with other small problems or get them later in life. [[Eyeglasses]] (or [[contact lens]]es) may fix the problem. 
 
 Like different cameras, different eyes have different abilities. They may have higher or lower resolution, the ability to detect small details. They may have different performance in low light; [[nocturnal animal]]s can see better at night than daytime animals. They may have different ability to distinguish colours. 
 
 == Parts of the eye == 
 [[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|right|250px|Diagram of the eye]] 
 The human eye is composed of several different parts. These parts may or may not be the same in other animals. They are: 
 * [[Cornea]]: the outermost, transparent layer that protects the iris and pupil.  
 * [[Pupil (eye)|Pupil]]: the black circle in the middle of the eye, through which light passes.  
 * [[Iris (eye)|Iris]]: the colorful circle of the eye around the pupil. It can be brown, blue, green, etc. Its main function is to regulate the amount of light coming into the eye. 
 * [[Sclera]]: the large, white field around the iris that keeps the eyeball in shape. 
 * [[Lens (eye)|Lens]]: behind the cornea there is a transparent bioconvex lens of very short focal length.This lens is held in the centre of eye ball with the help of ciliary muscles. 
 * [[Retina]]: has the cells which turn light into nerve impulses. 
 * [[Optic nerve]]: the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. Optical information is taken to the rear of the brain for processing: see [[cerebral cortex]]. 
 
 == Types of eye == 
 Today, ten different types of eyes are known. Most ways of capturing an image have [[evolution|evolved]] at least once. 
 
 One way to categorize eyes is to look at the number of  " chambers " . ''Simple eyes'' are made of only one [[concave]] chamber, perhaps with a lens. [[Compound eye]]s have many such chambers with their lenses on a [[convex]] [[surface]]. < ref name= " Land1992 " / > 
 
 Eyes also can be grouped according to how the photoreceptor is made. Photoreceptors are either ciliated, or [[rhabdom]]ic. < ref name=Kozmik2008 > {{citation| author = Kozmik, Zbynek ''et al'' 2008| title = Assembly of the cnidarian camera-type eye from vertebrate-like components| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| year = 2008| volume = 105| issue = 26| pages = 8989–8993| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800388105| pmid = 18577593| pmc = 2449352| doi-access = free}} < /ref >  and some annelids possess both. < ref name=Fernald2006 > {{citation | author = Fernald, Russell D. 2006 | title = Casting a genetic light on the evolution of eyes| journal = Science| year = 2006| volume = 313| issue = 5795| pages = 1914–1918| doi = 10.1126/science.1127889| pmid = 17008522| bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1914F| s2cid = 84439732}} < /ref > 
 
 === Simple eyes === 
 ==== Pit eyes ==== 
 Pit eyes are set in a depression in the skin. This reduces the [[angle]]s at which light can enter. It allows the [[organism]] to say where the light is coming from. < ref name=Land1992/ > 
   
 Such eyes can be found in about 85% of [[phylum|phyla]]. They probably came before the development of more complex eyes. Pit eyes are small. They are made of up to about hundred cells, covering about 100 & nbsp;µm. < ref name= " Land1992 " / >  The directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the opening, and by putting a [[reflection|reflective]] layer behind the receptor cells. < ref name= " Land1992 " / > 
 
 ==== Pinhole eye ==== 
 [[File:Nautilus pompilius (head).jpg|thumb|[[Nautilus]] has a pinhole eye]] 
 
 The pinhole eye is an advanced form of pit eye. It has several bits, most notably a small [[aperture]] and deep pit. Sometimes, the aperture can be changed. It is only found in the ''[[Nautilus]]''. < ref name= " Land1992 " / >  Without a lens to focus the image, it produces a blurry image. Consequently, nautiloids can not discriminate between objects with a separation of less than 11°. < ref name= " Land1992 " / >  Shrinking the aperture would produce a sharper image, but let in less light. < ref name= " Land1992 " / > 
 
 ==== Spherical lensed eye ==== 
 The resolution of pit eyes can be improved a lot by adding a material to make a [[lens (optics)|lens]]. This will reduce the radius of the blurring, and increase the resolution that can be achieved. < ref name= " Land1992 " / >  The most basic form can still be seen in some [[gastropod]]s and [[annelid]]s. These eyes have a lens of one [[refractive index]]. It is possible to get a better image with materials that have a high refractive index which decreases towards the edges. This decreases the [[focal length]] and allows a sharp image to form on the retina. < ref name=Land1992/ > 
 
 This eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring. To minimize the effect of eye motion while the animal moves, most such eyes have stabilizing eye muscles. < ref name=Land1992/ > 
 
 The ocelli of insects have a simple lens, but their focal point always lies behind the retina.They can never form a sharp image.  This limits the function of the eye.  Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina. They are very good at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field — this fast response is accelerated even more by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain. < ref name=Wilson1978/ >  Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image to be focused on a few receptors. These could possibly be damaged by the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and  reduce their sensitivity. < ref name= " Wilson1978 " > {{citation| last = Wilson M. 1978| title = The functional organisation of locust ocelli| journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology| issue = 4| pages = 297–316}} < /ref > 
 
 This fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight, because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up (because light, especially UV light which is absorbed by vegetation, usually comes from above). < ref name=Wilson1978/ > 
 
 ==== Refractive cornea ==== 
 The eyes of most land-living [[vertebrate]]s (as well as those of some [[spider]]s, and [[insect]] [[larva]]e) contain a [[fluid]] that has a higher refractive index than the [[air]]. The [[cornea]] is sharply curved and refracts light towards the focus. The lens need not do all of the refracting. This lets the lens adjust the focus more easily, for much higher resolution. < ref name=Land1992/ > 
 
 ==== Reflector eyes ==== 
 Instead of using a lens it is also possible to have cells inside the eye that act like [[mirror]]s. The image can then be reflected to focus at a central point. This design also means that someone looking into such an eye will see the same image as the organism which has them. < ref name=Land1992/ > 
 
 Many small organisms such as [[rotifer]]s, copeopods and [[platyhelminthes]] use such this design, but their eyes are too small to produce usable images. < ref name=Land1992/ >   Some larger organisms, such as [[scallop]]s, also use reflector eyes.  The scallop  ''[[Pecten]]'' has up to 100 millimeter-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell.  It detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses. < ref name=Land1992/ >

 [[File:Carpenter bee head and compound eyes.jpg|thumb|Arthropods such as this [[carpenter bee]] have compound eyes]] 
 
 Compound eyes are different from simple eyes. Instead of having one organ that can sense light, they put together many such organs. Some compound eyes have thousands of them. The resulting image is put together in the [[brain]], based on the signals of the many eye units. Each such unit is called ''ommatidium'', several are called ''ommatidia''. The ommatidia are located on a convex surface, each of them points in a slighly different direction. Unlike simple eyes, compound eyes have a very large angle of view. They can detect fast movement, and sometimes the [[polarization]] of light. < ref > {{cite journal| url = http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf| doi = 10.1016/S0167-9317(03)00102-3| title = Miniaturized imaging systems| year = 2003| author = Völkel R.; Eisner M.  &  Weible K.J.| journal = Microelectronic Engineering| volume = 67-68| issue = 1| pages = 461–472| access-date = 2009-07-28| archive-date = 2008-10-01| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001225326/http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf| url-status = dead}} < /ref >

 ==Evolution of the eye== 
 The [[Evolution of the eye|evolution of eyes]] started with simplest light-sensitive patches in [[protist|unicellular organisms]]. These eye-spots do nothing but detect if the surroundings are light or [[darkness|dark]]. Most animals have a biochemical 'clock' inside. These simple eye-spots are used to adjust this daily clock, which is called [[circadian rhythm]]. Some [[snail]]s, for example, see no image (picture) at all, but they sense light, which helps them stay out of bright sunlight. < ref > Autrum H. Introduction in Autrum H. ''Comparative physiology and evolution of vision in invertebrates''. A: Invertebrate photoreceptors. Handbook of Sensory Physiology. VII/6A. New York: Springer-Verlag. pp. 4, 8–9. {{ISBN|3-540-08837-7}} < /ref > < ref > Halder G; Callaerts P.  &  Gehring W.J. 1995. New perspectives on eye evolution. ''Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev''. '''5''' (5): 602–609. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0959437X95800298] < /ref > 
 
 More complex eyes have not lost this function. A special type of cells in the eye senses light for a different purpose than seeing. These cells are called ''ganglion'' cells. They are located in the [[retina]]. They send their information about light to the [[brain]] along a different path (the ''retinohypothalamic tract''). This information adjusts (synchronizes) the animal's [[circadian rhythm]] to nature's light/dark [[Sequence|cycle]] of 24 hours. The system also works for some [[blind]] people who cannot see light at all. 
 
 Eyes that are a little bit better are shaped like [[cup]]s, which lets the animal know where the light is coming from. 
 
 More complex eyes give the full [[Sensory system|sense]] of [[Sight|vision]], including [[color]], [[Movement|motion]], and [[texture]]. These eyes have a round shape that makes light [[ray]]s [[focus]] on the back part of the eye, called the ''[[retina]]''.

 [[File:Dragonfly compound eyes02.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The compound eye of a [[dragonfly]]]] 
 Good fliers like flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects like [[praying mantis]] or [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], have specialized zones of [[ommatidium|ommatidia]] organized into a [[fovea]] area which gives sharp vision. In this zone the eyes are flattened and the facets  are larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot. This gives a higher resolution. 
 
 The body of ''Ophiocoma wendtii'', a type of [[brittle star]], is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye. The same is true of many [[chiton]]s.
