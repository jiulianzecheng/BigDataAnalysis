 A '''lever''' is a [[simple machine]]. It is something that can be used in a lot of ways. One way is by measuring things, or by seeing which weighs more. A lever is supported by a fulcrum which it uses to lifts weights. It is one of six simple machines. There are three types of levers: first-class, second-class and third-class. 
 
 ==Early== 
 The earliest remaining writings about levers are from the 3rd century BC. They were written by [[Archimedes]].  " ''Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the earth.'' "  is a famous quote from Archimedes who stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by Pappus of Alexandria). < ref > {{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Alan Lindsay|title=A Dictionary of scientific quotations|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780750301060|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780750301060/page/11 11]|chapter=Archimedes ca 287â€“212 BC|isbn=9780750301060}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Types of levers== 
 There are three kinds of levers. The difference between them is where the [[Wiktionary:fulcrum|fulcrum]] is and where the forces are acting. 
 
 ===First class===

 A first-class lever is a lever where the fulcrum is in between the effort and resistance (the load). Seesaws and crowbars are examples of first class levers. 
 
 ===Second class=== 
 A second-class lever is where the resistance is between the effort and the fulcrum. Wheel barrows and wrenches are examples of second class levers. 
 
 ===Third class=== 
 A third class lever is where the effort is between the resistance and the fulcrum. Staplers and your forearm are examples of third class levers.
