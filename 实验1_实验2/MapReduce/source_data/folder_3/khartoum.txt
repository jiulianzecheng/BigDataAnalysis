It is also Sudan's largest city. It is where the [[Blue Nile]] and main [[Nile]] come together. Its name means  " [[elephant]] [[tusk]] " . Two other cities nearby are [[Omdurman]] and [[Khartoum North]]. 
 
 Khartoum has a hot [[desert climate]] (''BWh'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). 
 ==Climate== 
 Khartoum has a hot desert climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). It is very dry in the [[winter]]. This is normal in the Saharo-Sahelian zone. The [[climate]] is very dry for most of the year. In eight months of the year, the average [[rainfall]] is less than {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} of [[rain]]. 
 
 In August, there is a little bit of rain. The most amount of rainfall in this month is about {{convert|48|mm|abbr=on}}. The rainy season is usually windy. The [[average]] amount of rainfall is very low. There is only {{convert|121.3|mm|abbr=on}} of [[precipitation]] on average in a [[year]]. The highest temperatures usually are during two main parts of the year. The first is in the late dry [[season]] when the temperatures are usually above {{convert|40|C}} from April to June. The second is in the early dry season. Here, the [[average]] highs are above {{convert|39|C}} in September and October. [[Temperature|Temperatures]] are usually colder in the [[night]]. The lowest average low [[temperature]] in the year in [[January]] is just above {{convert|15|C}}. Khartoum is one of the hottest major cities on Earth. It has an [[Year|annual]] [[mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|30|C}}. In most months, the monthly [[average]] [[Temperature|temperatures]] doesn't get below {{convert|30|C}}. This is usually not seen in any other majors cities with hot desert [[Climate|climates]] like [[Riyadh]], [[Baghdad]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf |title=Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification |first=M.
