 '''Haskovo''' is a town in southeastern [[Bulgaria]]. Around 96,000 people live there. It celebrated the 1,000th anniversary in 1985. 
 
 ==History== 
 Archeologists (people who study stuff from long ago) say that people started to live in the Haskovo area about 7,000 years ago.   
 
 During the [[9th century]], a [[fortress]] was built, and soon after, a town was built around the fortress.  The town was located on a big piece of land between the Klokotnitsa, Harmanliyska, and [[Maritsa]] rivers. 
 
 In 1395, the ''Eski camii'' (the Old Mosque) was built as one of the first in the Balkans. 
 
 In 1782, the town was known as Marsa (Arab name). 
 
 Most Bulgarians started living in Haskovo in the [[19th century]].  The town was a trading center for merchants (people who sell stuff) from [[Edirne]], [[Enos]], and [[Istanbul]]. The area became known for producing [[cotton]], [[silk]] [[fabric]]s, and [[carpet]]s. At the Treaty of Istanbul in 1913, after the second Balkan Wars, a population exchange was made by the Ottoman Empire with the Kingdom of Bulgaria, 9714 Muslim's ([[Turks]] and [[Xoraxane Roma]]) from Haskovo was expelled to East Thrace in Ottoman Empire, and 9472 Orthodox Christian ([[Bulgarians]]) from [[Edirne]] was expelled to North Trace at Kingdom of Bulgaria.
