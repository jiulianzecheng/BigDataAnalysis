 == Family == 
 Acastus was the son of [[:en:Pelias|Pelias]], then king of [[:en:Iolcos|Iolcus]], and [[:en:Anaxibia|Anaxibia]] (Philomache in some traditions). Acastus with his wife [[:en:Astydameia|Astydameia]] (also called [[:en:Hippolyte_(mythology)|Hippolyte]], daughter of [[:en:Cretheus|Cretheus]]) had two daughters: Sterope (Στερόπη) and [[:en:Laodamia_of_Phylace|Laodamia]], and a number of sons. Another daughter, [[:en:Sthenele|Sthenele]] (Σθενέλη), was given by the ''[[:en:Bibliotheca_(Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' as the wife of [[:en:Menoetius_(mythology)|Menoetius]] and mother of [[:en:Patroclus|Patroclus]]. 
 
 == Mythology == 
 After the return of the Argonauts, Acastus's sisters were manipulated by [[:en:Medea|Medea]] to cut their father Pelias in pieces and boil them. Acastus, when he heard this, buried his father, and drove Jason and Medea from Iolcus (and, according to [[:en:Pausanias_(geographer)|Pausanias]], his sisters also), < ref > [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] vii. 11 < /ref >  and instituted funeral games in honor of his father. < ref > [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]].
