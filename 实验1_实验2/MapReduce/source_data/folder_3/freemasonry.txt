 '''Freemasonry''' is an [[organization]] of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others. Its members are known as  " Freemasons "  (in full:  " Ancient Free and Accepted Masons " , or simply  " Masons " ). Freemasons also help one another in times of hardship. Freemasonry can be found all over the [[world]] in various forms. About 6 million people are Freemasons. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BumIGVB_d7MC & dq=6+million+freemasons & pg=PT362|title=The Freemasons In America:: Inside Secret Society|last=Jeffers|first=H.

 The local groups in various countries are known as  " lodges " . At the State or National level are  " Grand Lodges " . These are independent of each other.  " Regular "  Freemasonry is only for [[Man|men]], but there are also co-ed Masonic lodges (and lodges for only [[Woman|women]]) that are not recognized as legitimate by the  " regular "  groups. All of these lodges believe in  " brotherly [[love]], relief and [[truth]] " . They do work for [[Charitable organization|charities]] such as running [[school]]s for [[orphan]]ed [[child]]ren. There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families.{{r|Hitz-2017-09-01}} 
 
 The word [[mason]] means a [[construction worker]] who works with [[stone]]. He is also called a  " [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] " . Freemasonry grew from the groups ([[Guild|guilds]]) of stonemasons in the [[Middle Ages]]. These men were building [[Cathedral|cathedrals]] and other big [[Building|buildings]]. They were called freemasons because they were free, they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord, like many workers were in those days. They often changed jobs and moved from one [[town]] to another. In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town. The stonemasons tried to keep their [[Trade secret|skills secret]] so only they knew how to do their job. This is probably why the Freemasons have [[Handshake|handshakes]] and [[Password|passwords]] that they swear to keep [[Secrecy|secret]]. 
 
 About [[1650]], Masons' guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds. In [[1717]], the first Grand Lodge (the Grand Lodge of England) was formed. It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England. In [[1813]], it merged with a rival and is now called the United Grand Lodge of England. 
 
 Freemasonry is controversial and has been opposed. The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in early American politics. The [[Catholic Church]] opposes Freemasonry, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/freemasonry.htm|title=Freemasonry|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2011-11-01|archive-date=2011-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115233105/http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/freemasonry.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  although Freemasonry itself does not block [[Catholicism|Catholics]]. Political authorities also sometimes oppose it. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] nations outlawed freemasonry.
