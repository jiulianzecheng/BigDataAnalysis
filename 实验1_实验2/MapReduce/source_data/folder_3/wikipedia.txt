 == History == 
 Wikipedia began as a related project for [[Nupedia]]. Nupedia was a free [[English language|English-language]] [[online encyclopedia]] project. Nupedia's articles were written and owned by [[Bomis|Bomis, Inc]] which was a [[web portal]] company. The important people of the company were [[Jimmy Wales]], [[CEO|the person in charge]] of Bomis, and [[Larry Sanger]], the [[:wikt:editing|editor-in-chief]] of Nupedia. Nupedia was first licensed under the Nupedia Open Content License which was changed to the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] before Wikipedia was founded and made their first article when [[Richard Stallman]] requested them. < ref name= " stallman1999 " > {{cite web

 Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, [[Slashdot]], and from [[search engine|people who looked it up]]. It grew to about 20,000 articles, and 18 languages by the end of 2001. By late 2002 it had 26 languages, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the end of 2004. < ref > " {{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual_statistics |title=Multilingual statistics |work=Wikipedia |date=March 30, 2005 |access-date=2008-12-25}} < /ref >  Nupedia and Wikipedia both existed until Nupedia's servers were stopped in 2003. After this, its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The [[English Wikipedia]] passed the 2 million-article mark on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, even larger than the [[Yongle Encyclopedia]] (1407), which had held the record for exactly 600 & nbsp;years. < ref name= " EB_encyclopedia " > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Encyclopedias and Dictionaries|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed.|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|volume=18|pages=257–286}} Encyclopedia Britannica  < /ref > 
 
 The [[English Wikipedia]] reached 3 million articles in August 2009. The number of articles and contributors appeared to be growing less quickly around the spring of 2007. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/12/wikipedia-deletionist-inclusionist |title=Wikipedia approaches its limits |author=Bobbie Johnson}} < /ref >
