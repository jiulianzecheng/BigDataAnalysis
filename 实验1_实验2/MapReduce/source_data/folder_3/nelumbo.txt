 '''''Nelumbo''''' is a [[genus]] of [[water plant]]s which are also known as lotus.  Lotus flowers are large – up to 20 & nbsp;cm (8 inches) across – and they smell sweet. 
 
 The Sacred lotus of Asia has pink flowers. The American lotus has yellow flowers. 
 
 In [[India]] the lotus is considered a symbol of purity 
 
 The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the [[mud]] (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for [[respiration]] (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water. 
 
 People can eat lotus roots and seeds. [[Cattle]] (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers. 
 
 Lotuses look rather like water lilies from the [[Nymphaeaceae]] family.  It is the  " National flower "  of both [[India]] and [[Vietnam]] and also the  " Provincial flower "  of [[Sindh]] province, Pakistan.
