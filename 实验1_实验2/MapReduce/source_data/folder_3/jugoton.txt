 ==Legacy== 
 ===Yugonostalgia=== 
 [[Image:Jugoton logo price sticker.jpg|thumb|1980s price sticker featuring Jugoton company logo. The price is in [[Yugoslav dinar]]s]] 
 Jugoton, as an important part of the former Yugoslav culture is one of the subjects of [[Yugonostalgia]]. 
 
 The former Jugoton record shop in the main [[shopping mall]] in [[Skopje]] (''Gradski Trgovski Centar''), [[North Macedonia]], still operates under the same name managed by the Macedonian record label Lithium Records. < ref > [http://www.jugoton.com.mk/eindex.htm Jugoton Shop Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527220005/http://www.jugoton.com.mk/eindex.htm |date=2007-05-27 }} < br / > [http://www.lithiumrecords.com.mk Lithium Records Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430192324/http://lithiumrecords.com.mk/ |date=2008-04-30 }} < /ref > 
 
 An example of different kind is the [[online radio]] and [[web tv]] station called Jugoton which operates in the Yugoslav [[diaspora]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. < ref > [http://www.jugoton.com  " Jugoton "  Radio] {{in lang|hr|de}} < /ref >  It plays music from the [[former Yugoslavia]], but also from all the contemporary former Yugoslav countries, including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[folk music|folk]]. However, it is not formally related to the actual Jugoton, and not all the Yugoslav artists represented in its program were really signed to the label. 
 
 ===Yugoton=== 
 {{main|Yugoton}} 
 ''Yugoton'' is a Polish [[tribute album]] to the former [[Yugoslav rock]] scene released in 2001. Its title is a nod to Jugoton.
