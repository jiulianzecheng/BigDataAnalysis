 A '''raven''' is a big black [[bird]], (''Corvus corax''). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a [[crow]] but bigger. It and the [[thick-billed raven]] are the two largest birds in the [[corvidae|crow family]], and perhaps the heaviest [[perching birds]]. The raven's [[feather]]s are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a [[distance]].  
 
 The most famous raven is in the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story called ''The Raven''. 
 
 The common raven can be [[wikt:tame|tamed]]. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and [[wikt:mysterious|mysterious]] character. < ref > {{Cite web
