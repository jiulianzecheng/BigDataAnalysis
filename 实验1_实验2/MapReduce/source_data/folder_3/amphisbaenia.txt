 '''Amphisbaenia''' are a [[suborder]] of [[Squamata]].  
 
 Amphisbaenians have features that link them to both [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s, but they have enough of their own features to be a separate suborder. Amphisbaenians can live both above and below the ground.  
 
 There are four families, made up of 18 [[genera]], and about 160 [[species]].  
 
 == Famililes == 
 * [[Amphisbaenidae]]  
 * [[Bipedidae]]  
 * [[Rhineuridae]] 
 * [[Trogonphidae]]
