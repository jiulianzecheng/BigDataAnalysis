'''Rumination''' is the constant urge for a person to focus their attention on their troubles, misery or [[worry|worries]] and possible causes or consequences. Rumination is having thoughts about earlier events, failures, abuse or hardships. The tendency to ruminate often serves as a big factor for [[Depression (mental illness)|clinical depression]]. People who ruminate a lot are more likely to become depressed and to carry major mental troubles, such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[suicide|suicidal behavior]]. One type of rumination, the '''state rumination''', is connected with [[pessimism]] and serious [[neurosis]]. 
 
 == Theories == 
 
 === Response Styles Theory === 
 The Response Styles Theory (RST) was developed by [[:en:Susan Nolen-Hoeksema|Susan Nolen-Hoeksema]] in the early 1990s in the hope of explaining the strong relationship between [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]] and rumination. The theory describes rumination as a way of dealing with hard situations where you keep thinking about how and why you are depressed, and difficult situations in this way are more likely to get depressed in the future. Even though this theory is most focused on how rumination influences depression, research on rumination also explains how it relates to other mental troubles too, like [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[binge drinking]] and [[eating disorder]]s. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|last2=Wisco|first2=Blair E.|last3=Lyubomirsky|first3=Sonja|date=2008-09-01|title=Rethinking Rumination|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=3|issue=5|language=en|pages=400–424|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x|pmid=26158958|s2cid=6415609|issn=1745-6924}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Olatunji|first1=Bunmi O.|last2=Naragon‐Gainey|first2=Kristin|last3=Wolitzky‐Taylor|first3=Kate B.|date=2013|title=Specificity of Rumination in Anxiety and Depression: A Multimodal Meta-Analysis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cpsp.12037|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=225–257|doi=10.1111/cpsp.12037|issn=1468-2850}} < /ref >  Wendy Traynor and her co-workers tried to improve RST to explain the link between rumination and depression better, because some people said that there might be other things that explain the relationship. They created the two-factor model. This says that rumination can be divided into two parts: brooding and reflection. Brooding is when you keep thinking of how your situation right now is not where you want to be, and what stops you from getting there. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Treynor|first1=Wendy|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Richard|last3=Nolen-Hoeksema|first3=Susan|date=2003-06-01|title=Rumination Reconsidered: A Psychometric Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023910315561|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=247–259|doi=10.1023/A:1023910315561|hdl=2027.42/44342|s2cid=7098702|issn=1573-2819}} < /ref >  This style of rumination is related both to being depressed and getting depressed in the future. The second style is reflection, and is thought to be a better way to deal with difficult situations and feelings as it is related to less depression in the future. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Verstraeten|first1=Katrien|last2=Bijttebier|first2=Patricia|last3=Vasey|first3=Michael W.|last4=Raes|first4=Filip|date=2011|title=Specificity of worry and rumination in the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children|url=https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/014466510X532715|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=364–378|doi=10.1348/014466510X532715|pmid=22003947|issn=2044-8260}}{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Reflection is when a person often tries to solve problems by thinking about how they can deal with their difficult situation or depression. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 People have criticised RST for being too simple. They say that we should pay more attention to how the things that make up rumination, like feeling lonely, being mean to yourself and feeling sad, influence each other. New research suggests that it might be wrong to simply describe rumination using two words (reflection and brooding), and that how we measure rumination should [[mirror]] how the parts that make up rumination are influencing each other. < ref name= " :4 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Emily E.|last2=Heeren|first2=Alexandre|last3=McNally|first3=Richard J.|date=2019-06-01|title=Reexamining trait rumination as a system of repetitive negative thoughts: A network analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301241|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|language=en|volume=63|pages=21–27|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.12.005|pmid=30590225|s2cid=58536838|issn=0005-7916}} < /ref > 
 
 === Goal Progress Theory === 
 Goal Progress Theory (GPT) says that rumination is a way of achieving goals. < ref name= " :5 " > {{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/769007752|title=Depressive rumination : nature, theory and treatment|last=Adrian|first=Papageorgiou, Costas Wells|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-48692-3|pages=153–175|oclc=769007752}} < /ref >  This way of seeing rumination is very different from RST, which says that rumination “does not lead to active [[problem solving]]”. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  More specifically, GPT defines rumination as a result of the [[:en:Zeigarnik effect|Zeigarnik Effect]], which says that unfinished tasks come to mind more easily than finished tasks. So, when people who ruminate think the same thoughts over and over GPT explains this as a way of finding another path to reach a goal, and says that they will stop ruminating when they reach this goal. This concept has been tested in experiments. In one, people were told not to think of a white bear and were given feedback that either they did or did not succeed in this. Those who thought that they had not succeeded had thoughts related to white bears come to mind more easily than those who were told that they had been successful, showing the possible effect of unfinished goals on rumination. < ref name= " :5 "  / > 
 
 == Links to mental illnesses == 
 
 === Depression === 
 It is generally thought that those who ruminate, especially those who brood, have a higher likelihood of getting depressed and falling into a deeper depression than those who do not. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :4 "  / > < ref name= " :6 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Nolan|first1=Susan A.|last2=Roberts|first2=John E.|last3=Gotlib|first3=Ian H.|date=1998|title=Neuroticism and ruminative response style as predictors of change in depressive symptomatology|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1023/A:1018769531641|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=22|issue=5|pages=445–455|doi=10.1023/A:1018769531641|s2cid=15419457}} < /ref >  This association seems to hold even when you account for people being depressed at the start of the study, and to be valid across ages and populations. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Ruminating is also suggested to make people more vulnerable to other risk factors for depression such as gender, less memory of one’s own life, [[:en:Neuroticism|neuroticism]], [[:en:Negative affectivity|negative thinking styles]] and [[perfectionism]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  The effects of the other kind of rumination, reflection, are more varied. Even though it is generally agreed that the this style of rumination is related to less depression overall, and especially a smaller likelihood of developing depression in the future, < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / >  new research points to the connection between the reflection and self-critical ruminative thinking (often thinking the same mean thoughts about yourself). 
 
 At first, RST said that rumination predicted for how long one was depressed, < ref name= " :7 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|first1=Susan|last2=Morrow|first2=Jannay|date=1991|title=A prospective study of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms after a natural disaster: The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.115|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=1|pages=115–121|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.1.115|pmid=1890582|issn=1939-1315}} < /ref >  but evidence has shown that this might not be true, and instead rumination predicts how many and how deep depressive episodes a person might have. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :8 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Just|first1=Nancy|last2=Alloy|first2=Lauren B.|date=May 1997|title=The response styles theory of depression: Tests and an extension of the theory.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-843x.106.2.221|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=106|issue=2|pages=221–229|doi=10.1037/0021-843x.106.2.221|pmid=9131842|issn=1939-1846}} < /ref >   It was also first suggested that people who ruminate can distract themselves to improve their [[mood]], < ref name= " :7 "  / >  but this has been questioned and evidence against it has been shown since. < ref name= " :8 "  / > 
 
 === Anxiety === 
 Rumination is in many ways similar and related to worry, which is central to [[anxiety disorder]]s. This relationship is thought to explain the part of the link between anxiety and rumination. Still, rumination on its own, especially the brooding kind, has been shown to predict both having anxiety and getting it in the future. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Brooding has also been shown to make the link between neuroticism and anxiety stronger. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 Rumination is also thought to increase the risk of getting other mental troubles like [[bipolar disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[binge drinking]] and [[self-injury]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Gender differences == 
 Studies on what groups of people ruminate and how much show that women generally ruminate more than men. This difference is the biggest in teenage years, but on the whole it is small. Studies on this suggest that the higher likelihood for women to ruminate might explain the generally bigger portion of women suffering from depression compared to men. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Daniel P.|last2=Whisman|first2=Mark A.|date=2013-08-01|title=Gender differences in rumination: A meta-analysis|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|language=en|volume=55|issue=4|pages=367–374|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2013.03.019|issn=0191-8869|pmc=3786159|pmid=24089583}} < /ref >  This finding is limited by similar things such as worry and neuroticism playing into the association, though. The two-factor model suggests that it is the higher rates of brooding among women specifically that is driving the gender differences we see in depressive symptoms. < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref name= " :6 "  / >
