 '''Pumice''' is a term for a lightweight [[Volcano|volcanic]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]].  
 
 It is a solidified [[froth]]y [[lava]], created when highly-heated, pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano. Its light weight is due to air spaces, which are caused by fast cooling and loss of [[pressure]]. The loss of pressure makes [[wikt:bubble|bubbles]] by lowering the [[boiling point]] of the lava (like the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened). The  cooling then freezes the bubbles in [[The Matrix|the matrix]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Most famously, pumice stone has been used as a skin-scraper. It is used in  [[pedicure]] to remove excess skin from the bottom of the foot, and on [[callus]]es (tough areas of skin).  
 
 It has also been used to make lightweight blocks for building, and as a powdered [[ingredient]] in polishing.
