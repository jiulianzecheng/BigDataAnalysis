 '''Suprematism''' is an [[abstract art]] movement started in [[Russia]], 1915/1916. It focussed on basic [[geometric]] forms such as the [[square (geometry)|square]] and [[circle]]. It is an example of [[geometric abstraction]]. 
 
 Suprematism was founded by [[Kazimir Malevich]]. In his book ''The Non-Objective World'', published abroad as a [[Bauhaus]] Book in 1927, Malevich described the inspiration which brought about the powerful image of the black square on a white ground: 
 
 :''I felt only night within me and it was then that I conceived the new art, which I called Suprematism''. 
 
 He created a suprematist 'grammar' based on fundamental geometric forms; in particular, the square and the circle. In 1915, Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting. The centerpiece of his show was the ''Black Square'', < ref > {{cite web |title=Photo of the Black Square |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/malevich/sup/malevich.black-square.jpg |publisher=www.ibiblio.org}} < /ref >  placed in what is called the ''red/beautiful corner'' in Russian Orthodox tradition, the place of the main icon in a house.  " Black Square "  was painted in 1915 and was a breakthrough in his career and in art in general. Malevich also painted ''White on White'' which marked a breakthrough from polychrome to [[monochrome]] suprematism. 
 
 Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-euclidean geometry]] which imagined forms in movement, or through time; titles such as: ''Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement.'' 
 
 ==Association== 
 The ''Supremus'' group met from 1915 onwards to discuss the philosophy of suprematism and its development into other areas of life. There was some crossover with [[constructivism]], with suprematists such as [[Lyuba Popova]] and especially [[El Lissitzky]] working on [[propaganda]] and [[industrial]] [[design]]. 
 
 Lissitzky spread suprematist ideas abroad in the early 1920s. 
 
 == Architecture == 
 Nikolai Suetin used suprematist motifs on works at the [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] Lomonosov Porcelain Factory where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed, and Malevich designed a suprematist teapot. The suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in [[Constructivism|constructivist architecture]]. 
 
 Malevich's architectural projects were known after 1922 ''Arkhitektoniki''. Designs emphasized the [[right angle]], with similarities to [[De Stijl]] and [[Le Corbusier]], and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all. Another part of the [[formalism]] was low regard for triangles which were dismissed as [[ancient history|ancient]], [[pagan]], or [[Christian]]. < ref > Hanno-Walter Kruft, Elsie Callander, Ronald Taylor, and Antony Wood 2003.

 ==Social context== 
 [[File:Автопортрет. Художник. 1933. ГРМ.png|thumb|Malevich, Self-Portrait, 1933]] 
 This development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state, ideas were in ferment, and the old order was being swept away. As the new order became established, and [[Stalinism]] took hold from 1924 on, the state began limiting the freedom of artists. From the late 1920s the Russian [[avant-garde]] experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of [[socialist realism]] became official policy, and prohibited abstraction and different artistic expression.
