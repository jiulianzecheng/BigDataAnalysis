 In [[Indian religions]], a '''mudra''' ([[Sanskrit]], literally  " seal " ) is a [[gesture]] made with the hand or fingers.  Along with ''[[asana]]s'' (body postures), they are used in [[yoga]].  Each mudra has a meaning. They are a central part of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[iconography]]. Mudras are also used in [[Buddhism]]. There are  hand gestures in both Hindu and Buddhist iconography. An example would be the outward-facing open palm known as ''Abhay'' (without fear) mudra, a gesture meant to dispel fear.
