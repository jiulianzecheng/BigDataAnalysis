 In [[chemistry]], '''alcohol''' is a general term which refers to many [[organic compound]]s used in industry and science as [[reagent]]s, [[solvent]]s, and [[fuel]]s. Alcohols are [[carbohydrates]] which are  made of an [[alkyl]] [[function groups|group]] with one or more [[hydroxyl]] (-''[[Oxygen|O]][[Hydrogen|H]]'') groups bound to its [[carbon]] [[atom]]s. Alcohol is [[colorless]], and also [[transparent]].     
 
 == Names for alcohol == 
 There are two ways of naming alcohols: Common names, and IUPAC names.  
 
 * Common names often are made by taking the name of the [[alkyl]] group, and adding the word  " alcohol " . For example,  " methyl alcohol "  or  " ethyl alcohol " . 
 * IUPAC names are made by taking the name of the alkane chain, removing the last  " e " , and adding  " ol " . Examples of this are  " methanol "  and  " ethanol " . 
 
 == Properties == 
 The [[hydroxyl]] (OH) group makes alcohols [[polarity (chemistry)|polar]]. Alcohols are very weakly [[acid]]ic. Most alcohols are highly flammable. 
 
 == Common alcohols == 
 The simplest two alcohols are [[methanol]] (or [[methyl]] alcohol) and [[ethanol]] (or [[ethyl]] alcohol), which have the following structures:

 [[IUPAC nomenclature]] is used when describing more complex alcohols. 
 
 In common usage,  " alcohol "  often means ethanol or  " grain alcohol " . (See also: [[alcoholic proof]]). 
 
 Other commonly used alcohols include: 
 * [[Isopropyl alcohol]] (''sec''-propyl alcohol, propan-2-ol, 2-propanol) H < sub > 3 < /sub > C-CH(OH)-CH < sub > 3 < /sub > , or  " rubbing alcohol " 
 * [[ethylene glycol]] (ethane-1,2-diol) HO-CH < sub > 2 < /sub > -CH < sub > 2 < /sub > -OH, which is the main substance in [[antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] 
 * [[glycerin]] (or [[glycerol]], propane-1,2,3-triol) HO-CH < sub > 2 < /sub > -CH(OH)-CH < sub > 2 < /sub > -OH bound in natural [[fat]]s and oils, which are [[triglyceride]]s (triacylglycerols) 
 * [[phenol]], an alcohol where the hydroxyl group is bound to a [[benzene ring]].
