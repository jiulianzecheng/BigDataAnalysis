'''Charmin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑːr|m|ᵻ|n}}) is a brand of [[toilet paper]]. It is made by [[Procter  &  Gamble]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The Charmin name was first created in 1928 by the Hoberg Paper Company in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. In 1950, Hoberg changed its name to Charmin Paper Company and kept making toilet paper, paper napkins, and other paper products. Procter  &  Gamble (P & G) bought Charmin Paper Company in 1957, but sold the right to make and sell it in Europe (where it is now called ''Cushelle'') to [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget|SCA]] in 2008. 
 
 == Advertising == 
 Older American adverts had actor [[Dick Wilson]] in them. He played the fake [[grocer]] [[Mr. Whipple|Mr. George Whipple]]. He told customers  " Please don't squeeze the Charmin! "  in more than 500 commercials between 1964 and 1985. < ref > [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jykyF_SSoGg97nrQ-hpWIZUhxLMwD8T0SMB00] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121170633/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jykyF_SSoGg97nrQ-hpWIZUhxLMwD8T0SMB00 |date=2007-11-21 }} Associated Press report, November 19, 2007 ( " Wilson appeared in over 500 commercials for Charmin between 1964 and 1985 " ), accessed same day < /ref >
