 '''Exmoor''' is a [[national park]] in [[England]]. The [[border]] of two counties, [[Devon]] and [[Somerset]], runs through it. It is an area of [[sandstone]] hills which form tall [[cliff]]s on its north coast. The high ground of Exmoor is mostly rough [[grassland]], but there are small [[woodland]]s on its lower slopes. 
 
 In Exmoor is an important water [[reservoir]], [[Wimbleball Lake]]. 
 
 It is also famous for the [[Exmoor Pony]].
