 '''Gravy''' is an English [[sauce]] made often from the juices that run naturally from meat or vegetables during cooking. It is a smooth, non-chunky liquid. Ready-made [[bouillon cube|cubes]] and powders can be used as a substitute for natural meat or vegetable extracts. Canned gravies are also available. Gravy is commonly served with roasts, meatloaf, rice, and potato dishes. It is very popular because it is used on [[mashed potatoes]] sometimes. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://life-in-the-lofthouse.com/garlic-parmesan-mashed-potatoes-and-gravy/ | title=Garlic Parmesan Mashed Potatoes and Gravy | date=11 November 2021 }} < /ref >
