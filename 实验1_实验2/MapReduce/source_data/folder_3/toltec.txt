 '''Toltec''' is used by [[historian]]s in different ways. It is either used to refer to certain [[people]] that lived in what is [[Mexico]] today, before [[Christopher Columbus]] came there. Some scholars also use the word to refer to the people that later developed into the [[Aztec]] civilisation. These people are only known from Aztec stories. It is not known if they actually formed one people or not.
