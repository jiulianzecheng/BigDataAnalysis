'''Optimism''' is a [[philosophy]] and a way of life. [[Optimist]]s believe that the world is generally a positive place to be in. In the view of an [[optimist]], people and things are good. Many [[liberal]] optimists do not believe in [[original sin]].  
 
 Optimism basically looks on the positive side, believing things will work out in the end. When a person is optimistic, it doesn't mean that they never doubt themselves. They might have a bad day or two. They recognize that they can make things better; there is a lesson to be learned from this, and they will move on.  
 
 The opposing theory is called [[pessimism]]. [[Gottfried Leibnitz]] was a famous optimist. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] is often considered to be a famous pessimist. 
 
 Optimism is associated with the idea of a glass looking  " half full " , instead of looking  " Half empty " . Optimism is also a habit of looking on the bright side of a situation
