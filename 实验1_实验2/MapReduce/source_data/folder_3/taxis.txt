 A '''taxis''' (plural '''taxes''') is an [[heredity|innate]] [[behavior]]al response by an [[organism]] to a directional [[stimulus]]. This means the organism automatically moves towards or away from the stimulus. 
 
 A taxis differs from a [[tropism]] (turning response, often [[plant]] growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has [[wikt:motility|motility]] and shows movement towards or away from the stimulus source. < ref > {{cite book |author=Kendeigh S.C |year=1961 |title=Animal ecology |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs N.J |pages=}} < /ref > < ref > Dusenbery, David B. 2009.

 *'''Phototaxis''': movement, usually towards [[light]]. Shown by many organisms, such as many flying insects. 
 *'''Chemotaxis''': movement towards desirable [[chemicals]], and away from unpleasant ones. 
 
 Even single-celled organisms can show taxis.
