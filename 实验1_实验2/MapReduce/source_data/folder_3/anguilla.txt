 '''Anguilla''' is a group of five islands in the [[Caribbean Sea]].  The islands are ruled by the [[United Kingdom]]. 
 
 Anguilla was colonized by the [[British Empire]] and used to be part of what is now [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], but broke away in 1980 so it could stay part of Great Britain. Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be [[Independence|independent]]. 
 
 It is named after the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for  " [[eel]] " , because it has such a shape. 
 
 Anguilla was first settled by Arawakan-speaking Indians who called it Malliouhana.  
 
 ==Politics== 
 The King or Queen of the [[United Kingdom]] is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a [[governor]].  He or she names, or ''appoints'' the governor, and he is just working there in place of the monarch.  The [[legislature]] is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 Anguilla has mostly been part of the British Empire since the [[17th century]]. The British brought thousands of [[Slavery|slaves]] from [[Africa]] and forced them to work, like they did all over the [[Caribbean]] and [[North America]]. Many of the slaves decided to run away rather than be forced to work. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/bondmenrebelsstu0000gasp|title=Bondmen and rebels : a study of master-slave relations in Antigua|last=Gaspar|first=David Barry|date=1993|publisher=Durham : Duke University Press|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-8223-1336-6}} < /ref >  When the British decided to [[Abolitionism|abolish]] slavery they paid all the slave owners a lot of money, < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/ukslaveownercompensation|title=Accounts of slave compensation claims; for the colonies of Jamaica.

 ==Culture== 
 Most people in Anguilla are [[Protestant]]s, and speak [[English language|English]].
