 '''Friars''' are special [[monk]]s that do a service to a [[community]] and that lead a simple life, rather than living like [[asceticism|ascets]] in a [[monastery]]. 
 
 ==Orders== 
 There are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four  " great orders "  and the so-called  " lesser orders " .  
 
 ===Four great orders=== 
 The four great orders were mentioned by the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274), and are: 
 
 * The '''[[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]''', founded ca. 1215. The Dominicans are also known as the  " Friar Preachers " , or the  " Black Friars " , from the black mantle ( " cappa " ) worn over their white habit. The Dominicans were founded by [[Saint Dominic]] and received papal approval from [[Honorius III]], in 1216 as the  " Ordo Praedicatorum "  under the [[Rule of St. Augustine]]. They became a [[mendicant]] order in 1221. 
 * The '''[[Franciscan]]s''', founded in 1209. The Franciscans are also known as the  " Friars Minor "  or the  " Grey Friars " . The Franciscans were founded by [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and received oral papal approval by [[Innocent III]] in 1209 and formal papal confirmation by [[Honorius III]] in 1223. 
 * The '''[[Carmelites]]''', founded ca. 1155. < ref > The Carmelite order was founded around 1155 according to many modern historians, but this [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03354a.htm date is often disputed], and has been disputed since at least the 14th century. < /ref >  The Carmelites are also known as the  " White Friars "  because of the white cloak which covers their brown habit. They received papal approval from [[Honorius III]] in 1226 and later by [[Innocent IV]] in 1247. The Carmelites were founded as a purely contemplative order, but became mendicants in 1245. There are two types of Carmelites, the Calced and Discalced Carmelites. 
 * The '''[[Augustinians]]''', founded in 1255. The Augustinians are also known as the  " Hermits of St. Augustine " , or the  " Austin Friars " . Their rule is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinians were assembled from  various groups of hermits as a mendicant order by [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]], from whom they obtained papal approval in 1255. 
 
 ===Lesser orders=== 
 The lesser orders are:  
 * the [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]], established in 1474 
 * the [[Conventual Franciscans]], < ref > The Conventual Franciscans are a branch of the Franciscan Order < /ref >  established in 1517 
 * the [[Third Order Regular of St. Francis]], < ref > The Third Order Regular of St. Francis are a branch of the [[third order]] of St. Francis, part of the Franciscan Order. < /ref >  established in 1521 
 * the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]], < ref > The Capuchin are a branch of the Franciscan Order. < /ref >  established in 1525 
 * the [[Discalced Carmelites]], < ref > The Discalced Carmelites are a branch of the [[Carmelites]]. < /ref >  established in 1568 
 * the [[Trinitarian Order|Discalced Trinitarians]], established in 1599 
 * the [[Order of Penance]], < ref > The Order of Penance is known in Italy as the ''Scalzetti''. < /ref >  established in 1781
