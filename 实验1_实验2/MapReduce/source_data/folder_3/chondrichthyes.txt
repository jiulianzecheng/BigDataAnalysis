 '''Chondrichthyes''' or '''cartilaginous fishes''' are the [[sharks]] and their relatives. They have [[jaws]] and paired [[fins]], paired [[nostril]]s, [[scale (zoology)|scales]], two-chambered hearts, and skeletons made of [[cartilage]] rather than [[bone]]. They are divided into two subclasses: [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s, [[ray]]s and [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s) and [[Holocephali]] ([[Chimaera (fish)|chimaera]], sometimes called ghost sharks). 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 * Class '''Chondrichthyes''' 
 ** Subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s, [[ray]]s and [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s) 
 *** Superorder [[Batoidea]] (rays and skates), containing the orders: 
 ***# [[Rajiformes]] (common [[rays]] and skates) 
 ***# [[Pristiformes]] ([[Sawfish (fish)|Sawfishes]]) 
 ***# [[Torpediniformes]] ([[electric ray]]s) 
 *** Superorder [[Selachimorpha]] ([[shark]]s), containing the orders: 
 ***# [[Hexanchiformes]] There are two families in this order.  Species of this order are distinguished from other sharks by having additional gill slits (either six or seven).  Examples from this group include the [[cow shark]]s, [[frilled shark]] and even a shark that looks on first inspection to be a marine snake. 
 ***# [[Squaliformes]] There are three families and more than 80 species in this order.  These sharks have two dorsal fins, often with spines, and no anal fin.  They have teeth designed for cutting in both the upper and lower jaws.  Examples from this group include the [[bramble shark]]s, [[dogfish]] and [[roughshark]]s. 
 ***# [[Pristiophoriformes]] There is one family in this order.  These are the ''sawsharks'', with an elongate, toothed snout that they use for slashing the fishes that they then eat. 
 ***# [[Squatiniformes]] There is one family in this order.  These are flattened sharks that can be distinguished from the similar appearing skates and rays by the fact that they have the gill slits along the side of the head like all other sharks.  They have a caudal fin (tail) with the lower lobe being much longer in length than the upper, and are commonly referred to as ''angel sharks''. 
 ***# [[Heterodontiformes]] There is one family in this order.  They are commonly referred to as the ''bullhead'', or ''horn sharks''.  They have a variety of teeth allowing them to grasp and then crush [[shellfish]]. 
 ***# [[Orectolobiformes]] There are seven families in this order.  They are commonly referred to as the ''carpet sharks'', including [[zebra shark]]s, [[nurse sharks]], [[wobbegong]]s and the largest of all fishes, the [[whale shark]]s.  They are distinguished by having [[barbels]] at the edge of the nostrils.  Most, but not all are nocturnal. 
 ***# [[Carcharhiniformes]] There are eight families in this order.  It is the largest order, containing almost 200 species.  They are commonly referred to as the ''groundsharks'', and some of the species include the [[blue shark|blue]], [[tiger shark|tiger]], [[bull shark|bull]], [[reef shark|reef]] and [[oceanic whitetip shark]]s (collectively called the [[requiem shark]]s) along with the [[houndshark]]s, [[catshark]]s and [[hammerhead shark]]s.  They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack. 
 ***# [[Lamniformes]] There are seven families in this order.  They are commonly referred to as the ''mackerel sharks''.  They include the [[goblin shark]], [[basking shark]], [[megamouth]], the [[Thresher Shark|thresher]], [[mako shark]] and [[Great White Shark|great white shark]].  They are distinguished by their large jaws and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] reproduction. The Lamniformes contains the extinct [[Megalodon]] (''Carcharodon megalodon''), which like most extinct sharks is only known by the teeth (the only bone in these cartilaginous fishes, and therefore are often the only [[fossil]]s produced).  A reproduction of the jaw was based on some of the largest teeth (up to almost 7 & nbsp;inches in length) and suggested a fish that could grow 120 feet in length.  The jaw was realized to be inaccurate, and estimates revised downwards to around 50 feet.
