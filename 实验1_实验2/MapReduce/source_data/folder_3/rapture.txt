 The '''Rapture''' (meaning  " to carry to another place " < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rapture Dictionary.com] < /ref > ) is a [[future]] [[event]] in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]] where [[Jesus Christ]] will return to [[Earth]] to bring his followers to [[Heaven]]. In Christianity it is believed that following this amazing event, the [[world]] will go through what is called ''the tribulation''. Then later following, will come the ''[[millennium]]'' (a [[thousand]] [[year]]s). 
 
 == Tribulation == 
 The ''tribulation'' (or the ''great tribulation'') is supposed [[theory]] of a period of time somewhere around the ''rapture'', where the [[Antichrist]] comes to power and controls the world. It is not entirely agreed among Christians whether the rapture occurs before (Pre-tribulation view), in the middle of (Pre-wrath view), or after the end of (Post-tribulation view) the tribulation, but most Christians seem to hold a Pre-tribulation view. Most [[Christian]]s agree that the period lasts around [[seven]] years. 
 
 == Millennium == 
 The ''Millennium'' is the period following the ''rapture'', and the ''tribulation'', that [[Christian]]s believe they will live in glory on the Earth. They also believe that Jesus Christ will be in total control over earth for ''1,000'' years (a millennium).  
 
 == Books and movies == 
 === Books === 
 In [[1950]], the novel ''Raptured'' by ''Ernest Angley'' was [[publish]]ed, and in [[1995]], the first of the [[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind series]] was published. These and other [[book]]s have made the [[story]] of the ''rapture'' and the ''tribulation'' [[Popularity|popular]]. 
 
 === Movies === 
 The ''Rapture'' story has been retold in many [[movie]]s. The most well-known production company is [[Cloud Ten Pictures]]. Which have created the ''Left Behind film series'' ([[Left Behind]]: The Movie, [[Left Behind II: Tribulation Force]], and [[Left Behind: World at War]]), as well as several other movies. Some other notable [[Apocalypse|end times]] movies are [[A Thief in the Night]] and [[The Omega Code]].
