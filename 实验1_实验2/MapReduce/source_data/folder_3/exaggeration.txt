 *”I’ve heard that a million times” 
 *”You’ve got a head the size of a pin”. 
 *  " I just ran a million miles " 
 People may understate because they are being [[modesty|modest]]: 
 *“Thank you, yes, I suppose I may have helped a little” (in a situation where the person actually helped a lot). 
 
 In modern [[slang]], the word “hype” is sometimes used about something that is getting more [[publicity]] than it really deserves.  The word hype comes from the word “hyperbole”.
