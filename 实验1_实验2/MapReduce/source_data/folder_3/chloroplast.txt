 A '''chloroplast''' is a small [[organelle]] inside the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of [[plants]] and [[algae]]. They absorb [[light]] to make [[sugar]] in a process called [[photosynthesis]]. The sugar can be stored in the form of [[starch]].  
 
 Chloroplasts contain the [[molecule]] [[chlorophyll]], which absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis. In addition to chlorophyll, a chloroplast uses [[carbon dioxide]] (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) and [[water]] (H < sub > 2 < /sub > O) to form sugar and gives off [[oxygen]] (O < sub > 2 < /sub > ).  
 
 Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow and orange [[pigment]]s to assist in [[photon]] capture for photosynthesis.

 == Structure == 
 Each chloroplast is surrounded by a double walled semi-permeable membrane. These are collectively known as peristromia. In the layered stacks are flat disk-shaped thylakoids. They contain light-absorbing pigments, including chlorophyll and [[carotenoid]]s, as well as [[protein]]s which bind the pigments. Like [[mitochondria]], chloroplasts also contain their own [[DNA]] and [[ribosome]]s. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 Chloroplasts are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell. They may have originated as [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] [[cyanobacteria]]. This was suggested by Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905, < ref > {{cite journal | author= Mereschkowsky C | title= Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche | journal= Biol Centralbl | year=1905 | volume=25 | pages=593–604}} < /ref >  after an observation by Schimper in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resembled cyanobacteria. < ref > {{cite journal | author= Schimper AFW | title= Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper | journal= Bot. Zeitung | year=1883 | volume=41 | pages=105–14, 121–31, 137–46, 153–62}} < /ref >   
 
 Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event. < ref > An exception is ''Paulinella chromatophora'', which has recently acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont which is not closely related to the chloroplasts of other eukaryotes: {{cite journal | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J. Keeling | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/z1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 1481–1493 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481 | pmid = 21652304 | s2cid = 17522125 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >   
 
 [[Mitochondria]] also had a similar origin, but chloroplasts are found only in [[plant]]s and [[protist]]s. In green plants, chloroplasts are surrounded by two [[cell membrane|lipid-bilayer membrane]]s. They may be the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium. < ref > {{cite journal |author= Joyard J; Block M.A.  &  Douce R. |title=Molecular aspects of plastid envelope biochemistry. |journal= Eur J Biochem. |volume=199 |pages=489–509 |year=1991 |pmid=1868841 |doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16148.x |issue= 3}} < /ref >  Chloroplasts have their own genome, much smaller than that of free-living cyanobacteria. The DNA which remains shows clear similarities with the cyanobacterial genome.  
 
 Plastids may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often contain more than 1500 genes. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Martin W; Rujan T.  &  Richly E. |title=Evolutionary analysis of ''Arabidopsis'': cyanobacterial and chloroplast genomes reveal plastid phylogeny and thousands of cyanobacterial genes in the nucleus |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=99 |issue=19 |pages=12246–51 |year=2002 |pmid=12218172 |pmc=129430 |doi=10.1073/pnas.182432999 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  Many of the missing genes are encoded in the nuclear genome of the host.  
 
 In some algae (such as the [[heterokont]]s), < ref > A large group of non-green algae and some fungus-like types. They are unified by the possession of two unequal [[flagella]] at a stage in their life-cycle. They include brown, golden, yellow-green algae and diatoms. < /ref >  chloroplasts seem to have evolved through a secondary event of [[endosymbiosis]], in which a eukaryotic cell engulfed a second eukaryotic cell containing chloroplasts. This formed chloroplasts with three or four membrane layers. In some cases, such secondary [[endosymbiont]]s may have themselves been engulfed by still other eukaryotes, so forming tertiary endosymbionts. In the alga ''Chlorella'', there is only one chloroplast, which is bell-shaped. 
 
 In some groups of [[mixotroph]]ic [[protist]]s such as the [[dinoflagellate]]s and some sea slugs, chloroplasts are separated from a captured alga or [[diatom]] and used temporarily. These klepto (stolen) chloroplasts may only have a lifetime of a few days and are then replaced. < ref name=Skovgaard > {{cite journal |author=Skovgaard A |title=Role of chloroplast retention in a marine dinoflagellate |journal=Aquatic Microbial Ecology |volume=15 |pages=293–301 |year=1998 |url=http://www.alfskovgaard.dk/publications/Skovgaard1998.pdf |doi=10.3354/ame015293 |access-date=2010-01-13 |archive-date=2010-11-18 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKjjzB0M?url=http://www.alfskovgaard.dk/publications/Skovgaard1998.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
