 '''Salland''' is a historical region in the west and north of the present [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[province]] of [[Overijssel]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The history of Salland goes back to the early [[Middle Ages]], when the four quarters of [[Oversticht]] (Salland, [[Twente]], Land van [[Vollenhove]] and [[Drenthe]]) came together. 
 Salland (and nearby areas) may have been the early seat of the Salian [[Franks]], the founders of the modern Dutch and [[France|French]] nations. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Salland is bound to the west by the provincial border with [[Gelderland]], which is partly formed by [[river]] [[IJssel]]; to the north by the [[Meppelerdiep]] stream and the provincial border with [[Drenthe]], which partly consists of the [[Reest]] stream; to the east by the borders with the [[Germany|German]] [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] and the eastern Overijssel region of Twente; and to the south by the border with the Gelderland region of [[Achterhoek]], part of which is formed by the [[Schipbeek]] stream. 
 
 Geologically, most of Salland's landscape consists of a lowland covered with river [[sediment]].
