 Most normal cells undergo a programmed form of death ([[apoptosis]]). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead. < ref > [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/illpres/implications.html The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002.] Illustrated presentation. < /ref >  Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause [[cancer]]. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins coded by oncogenes. < ref name=Kimball/ > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Croce C.M |title=Oncogenes and cancer |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=358 |issue=5 |pages=502–11 |date=2008 |pmid=18234754 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra072367 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/5/502}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Yokota J |title=Tumor progression and metastasis |journal=Carcinogenesis. |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=497–503 |date=2000 |pmid=10688870 |doi=10.1093/carcin/21.3.497 |url=http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/3/497

 In 1976 [[J. Michael Bishop]] and [[Harold E. Varmus]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] showed that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes, found in many organisms including humans. For this discovery Bishop and Varmus were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1989. < ref > [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1989/press.html Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1989 jointly to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus for their discovery of  " the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes " .] Press Release. < /ref > 
 
 == The history of a mistake == 
 The work of Bishop and Varmus corrected a long-standing error. The Nobel citation includes this explanation: 
 : " The term oncogene was introduced in the middle of the 1960s to denote special parts of the genetic material of certain [[viruses]]. It was believed that this part of the genetic material could direct the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell... The favourite theory of the time was that virus-mediated cell-to-cell transmittance of oncogenes was the origin of all forms of cancer. ''This view was later proven to be incorrect'' " . < ref name=Nobel > [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1989/press.html 1989 Nobel Prize citation] < /ref > 
 
 In fact, the [[reverse transcriptase|reverse transcription]] of the virus [[RNA]] into [[DNA]] had the effect that the oncogenes become integrated into the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] DNA in the cells. It was then found that oncogene-like material could be detected in different species throughout the animal kingdom, in fact even in simple organisms with only a few cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the gene had a fixed position in the chromosomes of a certain species, and that the gene, when it constituted part of the cellular genetic material, was divided into fragments. < ref name=Nobel/ > 
 
 == Proto-oncogene == 
 A '''proto-oncogene''' is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to [[mutations]] or increased [[Gene expression|expression]]. The resultant protein can be called an '''oncoprotein'''. < ref name=Kumar20 > Chapter 20 in: {{cite book |author=Mitchell, Richard Sheppard | display-authors = etal |title=Robbins basic pathology| year = 2007 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1 |oclc= |doi=}} 8th edition. < /ref >  Proto-oncogenes code for [[protein]]s that help to regulate [[cell growth]] and [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in [[signal transduction]] and execution of [[mitosis|mitogenic]] signals, usually through their [[protein]] products. Upon ''activation'', a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Todd R.  &  Wong D.T. |title=Oncogenes |journal=Anticancer Res. |volume=19 |issue=6A |pages=4729–46 |year=1999 |pmid=10697588}} < /ref > 
 
 === Examples === 
 The MYC gene is implicated in [[Burkitt's Lymphoma]]. This starts when a [[Translocation (genetics)|chromosomal translocation]] moves an enhancer sequence close to the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used [[transcription]] factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the [[Bcr-Abl]] gene found on the 'Philadelphia Chromosome'. This is a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is active, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation.
