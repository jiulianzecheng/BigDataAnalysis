 A '''hawk''' is a common term for a medium to large-sized [[bird of prey|birds of prey]]. Its usage varies in different places. 
 
 *The subfamily '''Accipitrinae''', the subfamily of the [[Accipitridae]] often called the  " true "  hawks. It includes all members of ''[[Accipiter]]'' and the closely related [[genera]]. [[Goshawk]]s and [[sparrowhawks]] are examples. They are mainly [[woodland]] birds with long tails and good sight, hunting by sudden dashes from a concealed [[perch]]. 
 *More generally, the term may be used for [[eagle]]s, [[kite]]s, and [[buzzard]]s. 
 
 Accipitrine hawks generally take birds as their primary [[prey]]. They have also been called  " hen-hawks " , or  " wood-hawks "  because of their woodland habitat. Within the hawk species, the female is generally larger than the male. Like most birds, the hawk migrates in the autumn and the spring.  
 
 == Eyesight == 
 Hawks, like most [[vertebrate]]s, have four types of colour receptors in the eye. They can see not only the visible range, but also the [[ultraviolet]] part of the [[spectrum]]. Other [[adaptations]] let them detect [[polarization|polarised light]] and [[magnetic field]]s.  
 
 They have many [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in their [[retina]], and an exceptional number of [[Neuron|nerves]] connecting the receptors to the [[brain]]. There is an indented [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], which magnifies the central portion of the [[visual field]]. < ref > {{cite web  | title = Hawks | publisher = beautyofbirds.com   | url = http://www.beautyofbirds.com/hawks.htm  | accessdate = 2010-01-30 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | last = Kirschbaum | first = Kari | title = Family Accipitridae | work = AnimalDiversity Web | publisher = University of Michigan Museum of Zoology  | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Accipitridae.html  | accessdate = 2010-01-30 }} < /ref > 
 Hawks have always been known to have sharp vision and to be very able hunters. < ref name= " National Geographic " > {{cite journal|title=Red-Tailed Hawk|journal=National Geographic|date=11 November 2010|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/red-tailed-hawk/|accessdate=18 October 2012|archive-date=29 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129001535/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/red-tailed-hawk/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
