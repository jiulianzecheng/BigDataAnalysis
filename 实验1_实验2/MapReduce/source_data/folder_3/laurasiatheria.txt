 '''Laurasiatheria''' is a large group of [[placentalia|placental mammals]]. The name comes from the area where [[derived (biology)|advanced]] mammals [[evolved]]. This was on the northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]], roughly corresponding to [[Eurasia]] today plus [[North America]]. When [[Pangaea]] broke up, it split first into Laurasia in the north and [[Gondwana]] in the south. 
 
 Members of the group include [[shrew]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[pangolin]]s, [[bat]]s, [[whales]], most [[ungulate|hoofed mammals]], and [[carnivora]]ns, and others. 
 
 The Laurasiatheria is defined by [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]]. The group does not share any obvious [[Anatomy|anatomical]] features. It includes these [[Extant taxon|living]] [[order (biology)|orders]]: 
 
 *[[Eulipotyphla]]: hedgehogs, gymnures, moles, shrews, solenodons (cosmopolitan) 
 *[[Cetartiodactyla]]: cosmopolitan; includes former orders [[Cetacea]] (whales, dolphins and porpoises) and [[Artiodactyla]] (even-toed ungulates, including pigs, hippopotamus, camels, giraffe, deer, antelope, cattle, sheep, goats) 
 *[[Pholidota]]: pangolins or scaly anteaters (Africa, South Asia) 
 *[[Chiroptera]]: bats (cosmopolitan) 
 *[[Carnivora]]: carnivores (cosmopolitan) 
 *[[Perissodactyla]]: odd-toed ungulates  
 
 There are various ideas as to how these groups are related to each other, and no tree of descent is agreed by experts so far. < ref > Zhou, Xuming ''et al'' 2011.
