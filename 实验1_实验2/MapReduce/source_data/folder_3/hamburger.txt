Hamburgers appeared on menus in [[England]] and the [[United States]] in the 19th century, and became a popular food after the 1904 World's Fair. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.geography.ccsu.edu/harmonj/atlas/burgers.html |title=Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeast United States, John Harmon |access-date=2010-08-03 |archive-date=2010-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628134343/http://www.geography.ccsu.edu/harmonj/atlas/burgers.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news | date = August 2009 | title = The World's First Hamburger | magazine = [[Texas Monthly]] | url = http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2009-08-01/feature7 | accessdate = August 15, 2009}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news | date = October 5, 1951 | title = Obituary: Charles Menches | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}} < /ref >   What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers; German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat.
