A '''fibre''' (also spelled as '''fiber''') is a piece of material which is long, thin and flexible, like a length of [[Yarn|thread]]. Plant fibres are the basis of [[fabric]] such as [[cotton]]. [[Silk]] and [[wool]] fibres come from animals. In the 20th century many artificial fibres were [[invention|invented]] like [[nylon]] and [[polyester]]. 
 
 They are very important in the structure of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, because they hold [[Tissue (biological)|tissues]] together. 
 
 There are many uses for fibres. They can be [[Spindle (textiles)|spun together]] into [[wikt:filament|filament]]s, [[Yarn|thread]], [[Twine|string]] or [[rope]]. They can be [[woven]] in [[fabric]] or in [[composite material]]s 
 
 ==Natural fibre== 
 {{Main|Natural fiber}} 
 Natural fibers include those made by [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and geological processes. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45136560|title=Textiles|last=Kadolph, Sara J.|date=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|others=Langford, Anna.|isbn=0-13-025443-6|edition=9th|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|oclc=45136560}} < /ref >  They can be classified according to where they came from: 
 
 * [[Fiber crop|Vegetable fibers]] are based on arrangements of [[cellulose]], often with [[lignin]]. Examples include [[cotton]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[flax]], [[abaca]], [[pi√±a]], [[ramie]], [[sisal]], [[bagasse]], and [[banana]]. Plant fibers are used to make [[paper]] and [[textile]] (cloth). It is also used as [[dietary fiber]]. 
 * [[Wood fibre|Wood fiber]] is fiber that gotten from [[tree]]s. They include [[groundwood]], [[lacebark]], [[thermomechanical pulp]] (TMP), and bleached or unbleached [[kraft]] or sulfite pulps. 
 * [[Animal fiber]]s mainly consist of [[protein]]s. Examples are [[silkworm]] [[silk]], [[spider silk]], [[sinew]], [[catgut]], [[wool]], [[sea silk]] and [[hair]]. 
 * [[Mineral fiber]]s include the [[asbestos]] group. Asbestos is the only long mineral fiber that can be found in [[nature]]. Six minerals have been classified as  " asbestos " . They include [[chrysotile]], [[amosite]], [[crocidolite]], [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]] and [[actinolite]]. Short, fiber-like minerals include [[wollastonite]] and [[palygorskite]]. 
 * Biological fibers also known as [[fibrous protein]]s or [[protein filament]]s consist of biologically important proteins, [[mutation]]s or other genetic defects can lead to severe [[disease]]s. For example, the [[collagen]] family of [[protein]]s, [[tendon]], [[muscle protein]]s like [[actin]], cell proteins like [[microtubule]]s and many others, spider silk, sinew and hair etc. 
 
 ==Man-made fiber== 
 Man-made are fibers that are changed by man. Man-made fibers consist of regenerated fibers and synthetic fibers. 
 
 ===Semi-synthetic fiber=== 
 Semi-synthetic fibers are made from [[raw material]]s with natural long-chain [[polymer]] [[structure]]s. They are only changed and partially [[wikt:degradation|degraded]] by chemical processes. The first semi-synthetic fiber is [[rayon]]. Most semi-synthetic fibers are [[cellulose regenerated fiber]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Kauffman|first=George B.|date=1993|title=Rayon: The first semi-synthetic fiber product|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed070p887|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|language=en|volume=70|issue=11|pages=887|doi=10.1021/ed070p887|issn=0021-9584|via=}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Cellulose regenerated fibers ==== 
 [[Cellulose fiber]]s are a type of man-made fibers, regenerated from natural [[cellulose]]. The cellulose comes from many sources: rayon comes from [[tree]] [[Wood fibre|wood fiber]], [[bamboo fiber]] comes from [[bamboo]], [[seacell]] comes from [[seaweed]], etc. 
 
 Some examples of this type of fiber are: 
 
 * [[Rayon]] 
 * [[Bamboo fiber]] 
 * [[Lyocell]], a [[brand]] of rayon 
 * [[Modal]] 
 * [[Diacetate fiber]] 
 * [[Triacetate fiber]] 
 
 ===Synthetic fiber=== 
 {{Main|Synthetic fiber}} 
 Synthetic fibers come from synthetic materials such as [[petrochemical]]s. 
 
 ==== Metallic fibers ==== 
 {{Main|Metallic fiber}} 
 Metallic fibers can be gotten from [[ductile]] [[metal]]s such as [[copper]], [[gold]] or [[silver]] and [[Extrusion|extruded]] or [[Deposition|deposited]] from more brittle ones, such as [[nickel]], [[Aluminium|aluminum]] or [[iron]]. 
 
 ==== Carbon fiber ==== 
 {{Main|Carbon fiber}} 
 [[Carbon fiber]]s are fibers that are mostly made up of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s. Carbon fibers are often based on [[Oxidized|oxidizing]] carbonized [[polymer]]s through [[pyrolysis]]  like [[Polyacrylonitrile|PAN]]. 
 
 ==== Silicon carbide fiber ==== 
 In [[silicon carbide]] fibers the basic [[polymer]]s are not [[hydrocarbon]]s but polymers. About 50% of the [[carbon]] atoms are replaced by [[silicon]] atoms. 
 
 ====Fiberglass==== 
 {{Main|Fiberglass}} 
 [[Fiberglass]] are also man-made fibers that come from natural raw materials. It is made from a specific type [[glass]], and [[optical fiber]], which is made from purified natural [[quartz]]. 
 
 ==== Polymer fibers ==== 
 
 * Polymer fibers are a type of man-made fibers, which are based on synthetic chemicals. These fibers are made from: 
 ** [[Polyamide]] [[nylon]] 
 ** PET or PBT [[polyester]] 
 ** Phenol-formaldehyde (PF) 
 ** Polyvinyl chloride fiber (PVC) [[vinyon]] 
 ** Polyolefins (PP and PE) [[olefin fiber]] 
 ** Acrylic polyesters 
 ** Aromatic polyamids ([[aramid]]s) 
 ** [[Polyethylene]] (PE), eventually with extremely long chains / [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|HMPE]] 
 ** [[Elastomer]]s can even be used 
 ** [[Polyurethane]] fiber 
 ** [[Elastolefin]]
