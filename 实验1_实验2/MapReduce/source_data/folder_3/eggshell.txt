 An '''eggshell''' is the outer covering of a hard-shelled [[egg (biology)|egg]] and of some forms of eggs with soft outer coats. It is a main character of the [[cleidoic egg]], which allows [[amniote]]s to breed on land. 
 
 == Worm == 
 Worms eggs present a three layered structure with an External Vitellin Layer, a Chitin Layer that confers mechanical resistance and an internal Lipid-rich layer that makes the egg chamber impermeable. < ref name= " pmid19368796 " > {{cite journal|vauthors=Benenati G, Penkov S, Müller-Reichert T, Entchev EV, Kurzchalia TV | title=Two cytochrome P450s in Caenorhabditis elegans are essential for the organization of eggshell, correct execution of meiosis and the polarization of embryo | journal=Mech Dev | date= May–Jun 2009 | volume= 126 | issue= 5–6 | pages= 382–93 | pmid=19368796 | doi=10.1016/j.mod.2009.02.001 | s2cid=17220562 }}  < !--Formatted by http://sumsearch.uthscsa.edu/cite/-- > < /ref > 
 
 == Amniotes == 
 Amniotes developed the cleidoic egg early in the [[Carboniferous]] period, and this meant they could live and reproduce on dry land. These early land animals [[evolved]] into the [[reptiles]], [[birds]] and [[mammals]] of today. In contrast, the [[amphibia]] are land animals who must lay their eggs in water, because the eggs are not protected by a shell.  
 
 The structure and composition of the eggshell protects the egg against damage, [[microbe|microbial]] contamination, and desiccation (drying out). Small [[molecules]] can pass through it, so the shell allows gas exchange for the growing [[embryo]]. It also provides calcium for the embryo's [[skeleton]].   
 
 === Reptile eggs === 
 While many [[reptile]]s lay eggs with flexible, calcified, eggshells, there are some that lay hard eggs. Eggs laid by snakes generally have leathery shells which often adhere to one another. Depending on the species, turtles and tortoises lay hard or soft eggs. Several species lay eggs which are nearly the same as bird eggs. 
 
 === Bird eggs === 
 The normal [[bird]] egg is a fertilized egg sitting on the yolk surface and surrounded by [[albumen]], or egg white. The albumen in turn is surrounded by two shell membranes (inner and outer membranes) and then the eggshell. The chicken eggshell is 95-97% [[calcium carbonate]] crystals, which are held together by a [[protein]] matrix. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Arias |first1=J.

 While the bulk of eggshell is made of calcium carbonate, it is now thought that the protein matrix has an important role to play in eggshell strength. < ref > http://ict.udg.co.cu/FTPDocumentos/Literatura%20Cientifica/Maestria%20Nutricion%20Animal/6.%20EVENTOS%20RELEVANTES/XVII%20Congreso%20Avicultura/confs/hunton1.htm{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  These proteins affect crystallization, which in turn affects the eggshell structure.  
 
 The average [[chicken|laying hen]], takes about 20 hours to make the shell. [[Pigment]]ation is added to the shell by [[wikt:Papillae|papillae]] lining the oviduct, coloring it any of a variety of colors and patterns depending on the [[species]].
