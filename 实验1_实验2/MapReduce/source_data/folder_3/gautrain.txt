 '''Gautrain''' is an [[wikt:express|express]] [[suburban rail]] [[transport network|network]] in [[Gauteng]], [[South Africa]], which links [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], [[Ekurhuleni]], [[Sandton]] and [[O.R. Tambo International Airport]]. The Gautrain network has 10 [[train stations|stations]] and a total length of 80 [[kilometers]]. < ref name= " Gautrain " > [http://gma.gautrain.co.za/performance/Shared%20Documents/GMA%20annual%20report%202018-19.pdf Annual Report] Gautrain Management Agency < /ref > 
 
 It takes 15 minutes to travel from Sandton to O.R. Tambo International Airport and 35 minutes from Pretoria to Johannesburg on the Gautrain. 
 
 [[Bus]] and [[minibus]] [[service]]s are available to transport [[passenger]]s to and from all stations, but not the O.R. Tambo International Airport Station. < ref name= " Gautrain " / >   
 
 The purpose of Gautrain is to provide a faster service for passengers, than the [[:wikt:regular|regular]] and slower [[Metrorail Gauteng]] suburban rail which also links most of the same places. Some stations of Gautrain are [[interchange station]]s with the Metrorail Gauteng stations. < ref name= " Gautrain " / > 
 
 Another purpose of Gautrain is to reduce [[traffic congestion]] between Johannesburg and Pretoria and their [[metropolitan area]]s. < ref name= " Gautrain " / >
