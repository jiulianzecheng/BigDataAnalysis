 '''Erzulie''' (sometimes spelled '''Erzili''' or '''Ezili''') is a family of [[loa]] in [[Voodoo]]. 
 
 == Overview == 
 The Erzulie is a family of [[loa]] that are often associated with water, femininity and feminine bodies. 
 
 ''Erzulie Fréda'', the Rada aspect of Erzulie, is the African spirit of love, beauty, jewelry, dancing, luxury, and flowers. She wears three [[wedding ring]]s, one for each husband - [[Damballa]], [[Agwe]] and [[Ogun]]. Her symbol is a heart, her colors are pink, blue, white and gold. Her favorite sacrifices include jewelry, perfume, sweet cakes and liqueurs.
