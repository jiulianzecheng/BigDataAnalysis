 '''Diocletian''' (Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus, about 245 to about 312) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 20 November 284 to 11 May 305. He was born in [[Dalmatia]] of poor parents. Diocletian ended the period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (235–284). He worked to return Rome to its former glory by making changes in key areas. 
 
 Religion: He [[persecution of Christians|persecuted Christians]], [[crucifixion|crucifying]] more than any other emperor. He imposed the traditional [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religion of the Romans. 
 
 Economy: Recognizing a [[gold]] drain from the western [[Mediterranean]] to the east, he tried to stop the [[inflation]] of the region by legislation. This did not work. He decreed that coins could only be made of gold or silver, stopping the trend of using lead in their creation. He made the tax system work better. 
 
 Military: Diocletian changed the army from the traditional [[garrison]] defense. He put small outposts of soldiers on the border. He got local soldiers from the border regions along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. These soldiers farmed and lived with their families in a village atmosphere. They lit signal fires on signal towers to warn other outposts of possible invasion by Germans from across the border. These outpost soldiers got regular pay from Rome for their services. He allowed soldiers to move up through the ranks by  " military credits "  earned by years of loyal service and by actions on the field of battle. 
 
 == Political structure == 
 Diocletian established a form of government known as the '''tetrarchy'''. In this, the Empire was organised into four parts, each ruled by a co-emperor. Diocletian took charge of the eastern empire. The senior co-emperor was '''Maximian Augustus''', a fellow officer. He took charge of the western empire. Later, two junior co-emperors were added: '''[[Galerius]]''' and '''Constantius Chlorus'''. 
 
 Finally, in 305, the two senior emperors [[abdicate]]d and [[retire]]d, and the two juniors rose to the rank of ''Augustus''. They in turn were supported by two juniors: '''Severus II''' in the west under Constantius, and '''Maximinus''' in the east under Galerius. In this way, the Tetrarchy showed how it could reproduce itself. 
 
 == Illyria == 
 These men were from the Roman province of [[Illyria]], several in the city of [[Sirmium]], which would become one of the four capitals under this system. From the time of [[Domitian]] (81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian provinces had been the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions. 
 
 In the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians came to dominate the army's senior officer echelons. Ultimately, the Illyrian officer class seized control of the state itself. 
 
 ==Regions and capitals== 
 The four Tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire. They faced [[Sassanid dynasty|Persia]] and the Germanic tribes. Also, there were many tribes from the eastern steppe which presented at the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]]. 
 
 The four centres are known as the 'Tetrarchic capitals'. Although Rome ceased to be the operational capital, it was still the nominal capital of the entire empire. It had its own Prefect of the City, an idea later copied in [[Constantinople]]. The four Tetrarchic capitals were: 
 
 *[[Nicomedia]] in northwestern [[Asia Minor]] (modern [[Izmit]] in [[Turkey]]), a base for defence against invasion from the [[Balkans]] and Persia's Sassanids was the capital of Diocletian, the eastern (and most senior) ''Augustus''. In the final reorganisation by [[Constantine the Great]], in 318, the domain, facing Sassanid Persia, became the pretorian prefecture ''Oriens'' 'the East', the core of later [[Byzantium]]. 
 *[[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) in the [[Vojvodina]] region of modern [[Serbia]], and near [[Belgrade]], on the [[Danube]] border, was the capital of Galerius, the eastern ''Caesar''; this was to become the Balkans-Danube prefecture ''Illyricum''. 
 *[[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]], near the [[Alps]]) was the capital of Maximian, the western ''Augustus''; his domain became  " Italia et Africa " , with only a short exterior border. 
 *[[Augusta Treverorum]] (modern [[Trier]], in Germany) was the capital of Constantius Chlorus, the western ''Caesar'', near the strategic Rhine border, it had been the capital of Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]]; this quarter became the prefecture Galliae. 
 
 [[Aquileia]], a port on the [[Adriatic]] coast, and [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]], in northern England near the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] tribes), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively. 
 
 In terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division between the four Tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theatre'. Each Tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective [[Praetorian Prefect]], each supervising several [[Vicarii]], the governors-general in charge of another new administrative level, the civil [[Roman diocese|diocese]].  
 For a listing of the provinces, now known as [[eparchy]], within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see [[Roman province]]. 
 
 In the West, the ''Augustus'' Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his ''Caesar'', Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the ''Augustus'' Diocletian and his ''Caesar'', Galerius, were much more flexible. 
 
 == Retirement and death == 
 Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government, and stabilized the empire economically and militarily. This helped the empire to remain intact for another hundred years, despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. 
 
 Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily [[Abdication|abdicate]] the position. < ref > Barnes, Timothy D. 1981.

His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split]]. 
 
 Maximian attempted to return to power.  Diocletian ordered him to step down permanently.  Finally, Maximian was forced to commit [[suicide]] and the tetrarchy began to unravel . Diocletian despaired and died in 311, possibly of suicide.
