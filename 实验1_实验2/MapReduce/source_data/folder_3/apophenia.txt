 '''Apophenia''' is when people see a connection, or a link between two things that are [[Correlation|unrelated]]. People who suffer from [[Schizophrenia]] often see patterns where there are none. [[Klaus Conrad]] first used the term, in 1958, when he talked about a patient suffering from Schizophrenia. Conrad used the term to describe a [[cognitive bias]], which offten occurs during a [[psychosis]]. Apophenia is a special case of [[Pareidolia]].  
 
 Today, the term is also used outside a medical context.
