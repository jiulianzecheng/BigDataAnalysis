 '''Rosaceae'''  ([[rose]]-like plants) is a large [[family (biology)|family]] of [[plant]]s. There are about 100-120 [[genus|genera]] with between 3,000 and 4,000 species in them. Well-known plants from the family include: 
 *[[Rose]]s 
 *[[Strawberry|Strawberries]] 
 *[[Raspberry|Raspberries]] 
 *[[Apple]]s, and [[Pear]]s 
 *[[Peach]]es, [[Cherry|Cherries]], and [[Apricot]]s 
 
 Plants in Rosaceae usually have flowers with five [[petal]]s. However, some decorative roses have many more. Species of [[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]] usually have eight petals. 
 
 ==Subfamilies== 
 The Rosaceae family has been divided into subfamilies; usually the following four subfamilies are used:  
 *[[Rosoideae]] 
 *[[Spiraeoideae]] 
 *[[Maloideae]] 
 *[[Amygdaloideae]] (sometimes incorrectly called Prunoideae) 
 However, it has become clear that the last three of these subfamilies cannot be divided in a clear way. Also, there is a small group that is so different from other Rosaceae, that it is now given its own name. Botanists now use only three subfamilies in Rosaceae: 
 *[[Rosoideae]] 
 *[[Amygdaloideae]] 
 *[[Dryadoideae]]
