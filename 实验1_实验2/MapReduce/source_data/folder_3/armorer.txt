 A modern '''armorer''' is someone whose job is [[wikt:repair|repair]]ing, [[wikt:assemble|assembling]] and [[test]]ing of [[small arms]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/armorer |title=armorer |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=31 July 2016}} < /ref >  Originally, an armorer was a person who created [[armor]] for [[medieval]] [[knight]]s and [[noblemen]]. Today an armorer is someone who belongs to an [[organization]] such as the [[police]] or military and who maintains [[gun]]s and [[weapon]]s belonging to that organization. An armorer keeps these weapons in top working condition always ready for trouble-free use in the field. < ref name=Beretta > {{cite web |url=http://www.beretta.com/en-us/bdt/armorer-class/ |title=Beretta Armorer Training Course Guidelines |publisher=Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A. |access-date=31 July 2016}} < /ref >  By doing this an armorer extends the service life of these weapons at minimum cost to the organization. < ref name=Beretta/ >  A failure of a weapon in a [[wikt:crucial|crucial]] [[wikt:situation|situation]] could cost lives.
