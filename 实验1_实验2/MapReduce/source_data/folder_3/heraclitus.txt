 '''Heraclitus''' of [[Ephesus]] < ref > [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|Ἡράκλειτος ὁ Ἐφέσιος}} — {{lang|grc-Latn|Hērákleitos ho Ephésios}}, English ''Heraclitus the Ephesian'' < /ref >  or '''Herakleitos''' (c.535 – 475 BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]]. He was a native of [[Ephesus]], [[Ionia]], on the coast of [[Asia Minor]]. 
 
 His teaching, as we have it now, is a series of [[wikt:epigram|epigrams]]. This means his teachings are sayings and remarks, rather than systematic essays. Heraclitus is famous for his doctrine of change being central to the universe. His famous sayings,  " All is flux " , and  " You cannot step twice into the same river "  is still remembered today. < ref > Guthrie W.K.C. 1962. ''A history of Greek philosophy, vol 1, the earlier presocratics and the pythagoreans''. Cambridge University Press. Chapter VII Heraclitus, p403. < /ref >  Another of his sayings appeals to some psychologists: 
 * " You cannot discover the depths of the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], even if you travelled every road to do so, such is the depth of its meaning " . < ref > Quoted in Hilgard E.R. 1986. ''Divided consciousness: multiple controls in human thought and action''. Expanded edition, New York: John Wiley, p167. {{ISBN|0-471-80572-6}} < /ref > 
 
 Often it is difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He believed in the unity of opposites, stating that  " the path up and down are one and the same " . 
 * " Good and bad are the same " . < ref > Fairbanks, Arthur 1898. ''The first philosophers of Greece''. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, London. #57, p39. < /ref >  In many of these 'opposite ends' pairs, if one never happened, then the other would be meaningless. 
 His utterance that  " all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', "  (literally,  " word, "   " reason, "  or  " account " ) has been the subject of many interpretations. 
 ''Logos'' became a technical term in philosophy, beginning with Heraclitus, who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge. < ref > ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''. 2nd ed, 1999. Heraclitus. < /ref > 
 
 [[Diogenes Laërtius]] states that Heraclitus' work was  " a continuous treatise ''On Nature'', but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology. "  [[Theophrastus]] says (in Diogenes)  " ... & nbsp;some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley " . < ref > Laertius, Diogenes. 1925. ''Lives of the eminent philosophers. .  Life of Heraclitus'', translated by Robert Drew Hicks. ix, 6 < /ref > 
 
 Diogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of [[Artemis]], the [[Temple of Artemis|Artemisium]], one of the largest temples of the 6th century BC, and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances. Many later philosophers refer to the work.
