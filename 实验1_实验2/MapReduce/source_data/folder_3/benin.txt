 From the 17th to the 19th century, Benin was ruled by the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]]. It was called the [[Slave Coast]] by [[white people]] from as early as the 17th century, because of the large number of slaves shipped from Porto-Novo, Cotonou, and other [[Port|ports]] to European [[colonies]] in [[Americas|the Americas]]. 
 
 After slavery was made illegal, France fought a war against Dahomey and took over the kingdom. They renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained official independence from France. < ref name= " Ibp Usa p85 " > Ibp Usa.
