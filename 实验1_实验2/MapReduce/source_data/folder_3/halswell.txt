 '''Halswell''' is a suburb of [[Christchurch]]. It was originally a separate village until the 1960s when [[Oaklands, New Zealand|Oaklands]] subdivision was added, this expanded further when Westlake was developed in the late 1980s and in the early 2000s when [[Aidanfield]] was developed to co-join the city. State Highway 75 runs through the suburb.
