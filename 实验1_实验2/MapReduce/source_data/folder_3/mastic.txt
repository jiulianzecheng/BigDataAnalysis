 '''Mastic''' ({{lang-el|Μαστίχα}} ''Mastika'') is a [[resin]] that comes from the mastic tree, ''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/does-it-work-can-chios-mastic-gum-help-stomach-ailments-1.619807|title=Chios mastic gum for stomach pain|first=|last=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}} < /ref >   The tree grows in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. In [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] and nature shops, it is called  " Arabic gum "  (not to be confused with [[gum arabic]]). 
 
 The resin is harvested in various places, especially the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Chios]].   
 It is a liquid when the tree first produces it. Then it dries in the sun into drops of hard  resin. When chewed, the resin softens and becomes a white, [[opacity|opaque]] gum. The flavour is [[bitter]] at first. After some chewing, it has a refreshing, slightly [[pine]] or [[cedar]]-like flavour. 
 
 Mastic is used in food, medicine, and industry.
