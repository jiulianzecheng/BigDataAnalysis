 '''Realism''' is a way of [[wikt:portray|portraying]] or thinking about [[reality]]. The word  " realism "  is used in many [[liberal arts]] in many different ways (such as in [[music]], [[painting]], and [[philosophy]]). It usually means trying to be true to reality. This is where the word  " [[wikt:realistic|realistic]] "  comes from. < ref > {{cite dictionary|last=Harper|first=Douglas|entry=Realistic|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|entry-url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/realistic }} < /ref >  Realism is usually seen as an opposite of [[romanticism]] and [[idealism]]. < ref name= " BritannicaA " / > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Hale|first=Bob|title=Realism (philosophy)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=November 19, 2020|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/realism-philosophy }} < /ref >  It is also sometimes seen as an opposite of [[liberalism]] and [[classicism]]. < ref name= " BritannicaA " / > < ref name=Korab-Karpowicz/ >  It is used mainly to describe the way that some [[artist]]s treat making art.

 Realism began as an [[art movement]] and {{c|Philosophical movements and positions|philosophical movement}} in the [[19th century]]. These realists wanted to give an accurate description of [[nature]] and of the way people lived. Realism can also apply to artists and artworks from before the 19th century though. < ref name= " BritannicaA " > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Realism (art)|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=May 29, 2020|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/realism-art }} < /ref > 
 
 == Origins == 
 {{For2|more information|[[:en:Realism (art movement)|Realism (art movement)]] on the ordinary English Wikipedia}} 
 
 The word  " realism "  first appeared in 1794, as the opposite of [[idealism]] in art and philosophy. < ref name=OnlineEtymologyDictionary > {{cite dictionary|last=Harper|first=Douglas|entry=Realism|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|entry-url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/realism }} < /ref >  The French magazine {{lang|fr|Mercure du XIXe siècle}} ({{lang-en|italics=yes|Mercury of the 19th Century}}) used the word in 1826. It said that realism was the art-style of being accurate to real life, rather than following art of the past. < ref name=BritannicaA/ >  Around this same time, realism was thought to have been one of the styles of philosophy within [[scholasticism]]. < ref name=OnlineEtymologyDictionary/ >  Then in the 1840s, realism began as an [[art movement]] in [[France]]. It focused on realistic modern life without avoiding what was unpleasant. It also focused on the [[lower class|lower]] or [[middle class]]es. 
 
 == Realism in liberal arts == 
 === In music === 
 
 In music there was a movement called [[Verismo]] which was the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for  " reality " . Verismo was popular in Italian [[opera]] around the end of the [[19th century]] and early [[20th century]].  [[Puccini]] was an opera composer whose style is typical of Verismo.

 === In politics and history === 
 {{expand section}} 
 
 In [[politics]], realism focuses on conflict and the harsher parts of [[history]]. < ref name=Korab-Karpowicz > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Korab-Karpowicz|first=W. Julian|title=Political Realism in International Relations|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Summer 2018|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/realism-intl-relations/ }} < /ref > 
 
 === In writing and philosophy === 
 
 Realism as a [[literature|literary movement]] began in Germany.  The [[poet]] and writer [[Heinrich Heine]]  tried in his books to accept the world as it is instead of trying to escape from it. Realistic writers tried to find good things about society. The interest in realism led to a movement called [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]. This meant describing scenes in nature accurately. The novelist [[Emile Zola]] was a naturalist. 
 
 In [[philosophy]], realism is also a way of thinking about [[knowledge]] and [[reality]]. It is usually the view that a particular thing is real whether or not it is known about. In fact, one person can be a realist about some things and a non-realist about other things. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Alexander|entry=Realism|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Winter 2019|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|entry-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entries/realism/ }} < /ref >  For example, some realists say that the [[past]] really happened no matter what we think about it. Other realist philosophers say that there are [[moral]]s that really exist as [[fact]]s. This is different from philosophers who say that things only exist because of people who are aware of them. For example, a non-realist philosopher might say [[beauty]] only exists because someone sees something that they think is beautiful. A realist philosopher might instead say that beauty is there whether anyone sees it or not. 
 
 === Other styles === 
 
 The term [[social realism]] describes an art form in [[America]] in the [[1930s]] which expressed social protest in a naturalistic way.  This is different from what is usually called [[socialist realism]] which was a term used by [[Soviet]] politicians from 1932 to the mid 1980s to describe art which showed the workers' struggle, glorifying the Soviet Union. 
 
 In the early [[20th century]] Realism led to other movements such as [[Dadaism]] and [[Surrealism]].
