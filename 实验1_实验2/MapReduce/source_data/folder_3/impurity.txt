Something that has '''impurity''' is not pure. For example, water that is clean would be called pure water. Water that is dirty would be called impure water. This may result in a change in [[melting point]] or [[boiling point]]. 
 
 ==Harmful impurity== 
 Impurities may be harmful. For example, an [[engine]] works bad when its [[fuel]] is not pure. 
 
 ==Useful impurity== 
 Impure materials are useful sometimes. [[Alloy]]s are metals with impurities. [[Solar cell]]s are made of [[silicon]] crystals, but a very small amount of impurity (0.001% to 0.01%) is needed in them to work. 
 
 == Removing impurities == 
 # Removed by [[distillation]] for liquids 
 # Removed by [[recrystallization]] for solids
