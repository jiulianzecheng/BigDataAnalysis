 '''Pseudosuchia''' ( " false crocodiles " ) is one of two major divisions of [[archosaurs]]. It includes living [[crocodilia]]ns.  
 
 Pseudosuchia is one of the two  " daughter "  [[clades]] of the [[Archosaur]]ia. It includes a group of superficially crocodile-like prehistoric reptiles from the [[Triassic]] period. These are relatives of living crocodiles, but more distant than the archosaurs. 
 
 == Description == 
 The skull is often massive. The snout is narrow and often long. The neck is short and strong. The standing position may be a typical reptilian sprawl. More often it is an erect stance like [[dinosaur]]s or [[mammal]]s, though done a different way. The body is often protected by two or more rows of [[armored]] [[scute]]s. Many crurotarsans get to lengths of three metres or more. 
 
 == Evolution ==

 Pseudosuchians appeared in the late [[Lower Triassic]]. By the late [[Middle Triassic]] they were the dominant land [[carnivore]]s. Their great time was the [[Upper Triassic]], during which time their ranks included a number of carnivore groups, and one group of herbivores. 
 
 The [[Triassic-Jurassic extinction event|end Triassic extinction]] caused the extinction of most pseudosuchians. The ancestors of modern-day crocodiles survived. A study published in 2010 suggests [[volcanic eruption]]s changed the [[climate]], causing a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs' main competitors. < ref > Whiteside, Jessica H.

 As the [[Mesozoic]] progressed, more typically crocodile-like forms evolved. [[Dinosaurs]] were the dominant animals on land, but the proto-crocodiles flourished in rivers, [[swamps]], and the oceans. These early crocodiles had far more diversity they have today. With the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end Cretaceous extinction]], the dinosaurs became extinct, except the birds, while the crocodilians continued with little change. Today, the [[crocodile]]s, [[Alligatoridae|alligators]], and [[Gavialidae|gharials]] are the surviving representatives of this lineage.
