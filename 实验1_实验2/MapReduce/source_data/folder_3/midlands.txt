 '''Midlands''' could be in general the central [[region]] of any [[territory]]. In [[Britain]] and [[Ireland]], the term is reseved for the  " middle "  in the north–south ( " vertical " ) direction (countries that are oriented more east–west use  " Mid "  with a  " horizontal "  meaning.) 
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]], Scotland and England both have midland areas that are famous enough to be called the  " Midlands "  (as a name, not just as a description). In [[Wales]] the term for the central region is  " Mid Wales "  (not  " The Welsh Midlands " ). 
 
 The rest of this article deals with the English Region known simply as '''The Midlands''', which is more or less the territory of the early-medieval kingdom of [[Mercia]]. 
 
 The area lies between [[Southern England]], [[Northern England]], [[East Anglia]] and [[Wales]], and includes the [[county|counties]] of [[Derbyshire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Rutland]], [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]], the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and [[Worcestershire]]. The 2001 census also included [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Cambridgeshire]] in the Midlands but these are not generally considered to be part of the Midlands but [[East Anglia]]. 
 
 There are two administrative [[regions of England]] in the Midlands: [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] and [[East Midlands]]. Taken together, these regions do not fully cover the traditional Midlands: 
 # Part of Northern [[Lincolnshire]] is now in [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]; 
 # [[Peterborough]] has been removed from Northamptonshire and included with [[Cambridgeshire]] in the [[East of England]]; 
 # [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxfordshire]] are now in the [[South West England|South West]] and [[South East England|South East]] respectively. 
 # [[Bedfordshire]] is now in the [[East of England]]. < ref > The [[1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica]] describes Gloucestershire as  " west midland " , [[Bedfordshire]] as  " south midland " , and [[Huntingdonshire]] as  " east midland "  counties respectively. < /ref > 
 
 The  " midland "  status of [[Cheshire]] is often debated. South Cheshire has strong links with North Staffordshire (definitely in the Midlands), and North Cheshire with Merseyside and Manchester (both definitely in Northern England). Officially Cheshire is now part of the [[North West England|North West]] region. 
 
 The largest Midlands [[conurbation]], which includes the cities of [[Birmingham]] and [[Wolverhampton]], is approximately covered by a [[metropolitan county]] (which also includes [[Coventry]]) also called the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. Thus, there are two West Midlands, a Region and a (smaller) County. 
 
 Parts of the East Midlands are also densely populated, particularly the triangle formed by the cities of [[Leicester]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]]. 
 
 The [[South Midlands]] have an own government for development. They include [[Northamptonshire]] and [[Bedfordshire]] with northern [[Buckinghamshire]]. In other context Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire are not considered part of the Midlands. They are in the administrative regions of the [[South East England|South East]] and the [[East of England]].
