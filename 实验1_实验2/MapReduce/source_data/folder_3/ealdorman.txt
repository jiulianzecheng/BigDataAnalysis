An '''ealdorman''' (from Old English ''ealdorman'', lit.  " elder man " ; plural:  " ealdormen " ) is a term used for a high-ranking royal official who was in charge of one or more [[shire]]s. The title dates from the [[6th century|sixth century]] and was in use up to the time of King [[Canute]]. Their position was a combination of [[:wikt:administrator|administrator]], [[:wikt:judge|judge]] and military [[:en:wikt:commander|commander]]. Ealdormen were the [[:en:wikt:predecessors|predecessors]] of the later [[England|English]] [[earl]]s.

 The king appointed an ealdorman to govern one or more [[shire]]s or [[:wikt:territories|territories]]. < ref name=Swanton19 & n10 > ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', ed.  &  trans. Michael James Swanton (New York: Routledge, 1998), p. 19  &  note 10 (Peterborough Manuscript) < /ref >  The ealdorman was also responsible for leading his local [[w:Fyrd|fyrd]] (part-time army) in battle. But these armies owed their first [[:en:wikt:allegiance|allegiance]] to their ealdorman. < ref name=Yorke171 > Barbara Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'' (London: Routledge, 1997), p. 171 < /ref >  Very often the support of one or more ealdormen could help a royal candidate to become king. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  In many cases ealdormen succeeded [[:en:wikt:underkings|underkings]] yet kept the same rights. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  Several had been underkings and were members of the royal family. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  In early Anglo-Saxon documents ealdormen are also termed ''[[:en:wikt:dux|dux]], ''[[:en:wikt:princeps|princeps]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:comitis|comitis]] in documents of the time. < ref name=StGeorge20 > Thomas St. George, ''Titles of Honour'' (London: 1864), p. 20 < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 The term first appears in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] under the year 568. < ref name=Swanton19 & n10/ >   But it was probably used long before then.  As early as the [[7th century|seventh century]] ealdormen were seen as judges. < ref name=Blair246 > Peter Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain and Early England 55 B.C.–A.D. 871'' (New York; London: W. W. Norton  &  Company, 1968), p. 246 < /ref >  But the development of the shire may have come later. < ref name=Blair246/ >  As ealdormanries began to become [[:en:wikt:hereditary|hereditary]] (passed down from father to son) the families who held them became more and more powerful. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  Several rose in power second only to the king. They were described in documents by the term ''[[:en:wikt:patricius|patricius]]''. In the [[8th century|eighth century]] these occurred in [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]] and [[Kent]]. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  The term ''patricius'' was roughly the same as the office of [[w:Mayor of the Palace|mayor of the palace]] in the [[w:Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian dynasty]] of [[Franks|Frankish]] kings. This could be dangerous for a king to have someone so powerful exercising power in his name. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  In the eighth and [[9th century|ninth centuries]] the most dangerous ealdormen were those who claimed royal descent. They could and in some cases did rise up against a king and took the throne themselves. < ref name=Yorke171/ >  In the very basic royal [[:wikt:administrations|administrations]] of the time a king needed to depend on his ealdormen. A king could create ealdormen from his own family. But he could only fill only a portion of the ealdormanries in that way. As the families of ealdormen banded together in ties of mutual support it became more difficult to remove an ealdorman. < ref name=Yorke171/ >

 The term ealdorman was replaced by the term earl during the [[11th century|eleventh century]]. < ref name=Hudson203 > ''The Oxford History of the Laws of England: c.900-1216'', Vol. II, ed. John Hudson (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2012). p. 203 < /ref >   In the laws of King [[Canute]] both ealdormen and earls are mentioned. But there was no distinction made between them. < ref name=Hudson203/ >  After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the title Earl was no longer [[:en:wikt:interchangeable|interchangeable]] with ''dux'' or ''princeps''. They were written at times as ''[[:en:wikt:comes|comes]]'' (count).{{efn|This was due to [[William the Conqueror]]'s knowledge of the use of these words in Latin. Both ''dux'' and ''princeps'' had been used to describe the [[Duke of Normandy|Dukes of Normandy]] as independent rulers of [[Normandy]]. < ref > ''The Annals of Flodoard of Reims 919–966'', ed.  &  trans. Steven Fanning; Bernard S. Bachrach (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. xxi < /ref >  There was no desire to confuse an English Earl with an independent ruler. The Dukes of Normandy were familiar with and had used the title count themselves up to the early eleventh century. < ref > David Douglas, 'The Earliest Norman Counts', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 61, No. 240 (May, 1946), p. 130 < /ref > }} < ref name=StGeorge20/ >  King William replaced most Anglo-Saxon earls with his own [[:en:wikt:appointees|appointees]]. He then limited the power of most earls giving them control of [[:wikt:counties|counties]], [[castle]]s or other [[:wikt:territories|territories]]. A few were given more power. These were titled [[w:Earl palatine|Earl palatine]]. < ref name=StGeorge20/ >
