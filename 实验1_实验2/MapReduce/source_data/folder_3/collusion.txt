A '''collusion''' is a secret agreement between two or more people or groups, usually to create unlawful advantages over others. Collusions often organize secret agreements to gain an advantage by modifying the [[market]] unfairly. In businesses, this is often done by intentionally by secretly changing the [[supply and demand]] of [[goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. 
 
 Sometimes major companies will use collusions to make significant advantages over other companies by the use of [[cartel]]s (the creation of unfair trade deals).
