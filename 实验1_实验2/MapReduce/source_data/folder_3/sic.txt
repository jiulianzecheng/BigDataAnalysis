'''''Sic''''' is a [[Latin]] word meaning  " thus " ,  " so " ,  " as such " , or  " in such a manner " . In [[writing]], it is put in square [[bracket]]s and [[Italic|italic type]] – [''sic''] – to show that any incorrect or unusual [[spelling]], [[phrase]]s, [[punctuation]], or other quoted material have been copied [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] (word for word) from its original source. < ref name= " cgsau " > {{cite book |url=http://www.bartleby.com/68/67/5467.html |chapter=sic (adv.) |title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English. |first=Kenneth G. |last=Wilson |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2007-06-15 |archive-date=2007-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211191251/http://www.bartleby.com/68/67/5467.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 At first, it was said like the English word  " seek "  ([[IPA]] /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word  " sick "  (/'sɪk/). 
 
 == Usage == 
 The word ''sic'' may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the [[U.S. Constitution]]: 
 
 : " The House of Representatives shall chuse [''sic''] their Speaker... " 
 
 It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in ''[[The Times]]'': 
 
 :Warehouse has been around for 30 years and has 263 stores, suggesting a large fan base. The chain sums up its appeal thus:  " styley [''sic''], confident, sexy, glamorous, edgy, clean and individual, with it's [''sic''] finger on the fashion pulse. " < ref > {{cite news |first=Anne |last=Ashworth |title=Chain reaction: Warehouse |url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,26930-2234374,00.html |work=[[The Times]] |date=2006-06-21 |accessdate=2007-01-06 }} < /ref > 
 
 Sometimes, ''sic'' is said to be an [[abbreviation]] for  " said in context " ,  " spelled in context " ,  " said in copy " , and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.
