 '''''Calluna vulgaris''''' ('''heather''') is the sole species in the [[genus]] '''''Calluna''''' in the family [[Ericaceae]]. 
 
 It is a low-growing [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[shrub]] growing to {{Convert|20|to|50|cm|in}} tall, or rarely to {{Convert|1|m|in}}. It is found widely in [[Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]] on [[acid]]ic soils in open sunny situations and in moderate shade. 
 
 Heather is the dominant plant on most [[heath]]s  and [[moorland]] in Europe, and in some [[bog]] vegetation and [[acid]]ic [[pine]] and [[oak]] woodland. It is tolerant of [[grazing]] and regenerates following occasional burning. It is often managed in nature reserves and [[grouse]] [[moorland|moor]]s by [[sheep]] or [[cattle]] grazing, and also by light burning. 
 
 The flowers emerge in late summer; in wild plants these are normally mauve, but white-flowered plants also occur occasionally. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Heather is an important food source for various [[sheep]] and [[deer]] which can graze the tips of the plants when snow covers low growing vegetation. [[Willow Grouse]] and [[Red Grouse]] feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant. Both adults and [[larva]]e of the Heather Beetle ''Lochmaea suturalis'' feed on it, and can cause damage. The larvae of a number of [[Lepidoptera]] species also feed on the plant. 
 
 Heather [[honey]] is a highly valued product in moorland and heathland areas, with many [[beehives]] being moved there in late summer.  It has a strong taste, and an unusual texture. It is [[thixotropic]], being a [[Gel|jelly]] until stirred, when it becomes a [[syrup]] (like other honey), but then sets again to a jelly.  This makes the extraction of the honey from the comb difficult, and it is therefore often sold as [[comb honey]]. 
 
 == Cultural references == 
 Heather is seen as iconic of [[Scotland]], where the plant grows widely. When poems like ''Bonnie Auld Scotland'' speak of  " fragrant hills of purple heather', when the hero of [[Kidnapped (novel)|''Kidnapped'']] flees through the heather, when heather and Scotland are linked in the same sentence, the heather talked about is ''Calluna vulgaris''. < ref > {{cite book| last = Wallace| first = Alexander| title = The Heather in Lore, Lyric and Lay| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dugpAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA6| access-date = 2010-01-27| date = 2008-07-22| publisher = A.T.
