 '''Sukarno''' (6 June 1901 – 21 June 1970) was the first [[President of Indonesia]]. He helped the country win its independence from [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. He was President from 1945 to 1967, presiding with mixed success over the country's rough switch to independence. Sukarno was forced to resign by one of his generals, [[Suharto]]. Suharto formally became President in March 1967. 
 
 The spelling  " Sukarno "  has been official in Indonesia since 1947. It is still common to see the older spelling '''Soekarno''', mainly because he signed his name with the old spelling. Official Indonesian presidential [[decree]]s from 1947-1968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling. 
 
 Indonesians also remember him as '''''Bung'' Karno''' or '''''Pak'' Karno'''. < ref > ''Bung'' is an [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] term of endearment similar to 'older brother', ''Pak'' is more formal, like 'sir' or 'father'. < /ref >  Like many [[Java (island)|Javanese]] people, he had only one name; in religious contexts, he was occasionally referred to as 'Achmad Sukarno'. < ref > [http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/ASAA/biennial-conference/2006/Drakeley-Steven-ASAA2006.pdf In Search of Achmad Sukarno] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608113017/http://coombs.anu.edu.au/SpecialProj/ASAA/biennial-conference/2006/Drakeley-Steven-ASAA2006.pdf |date=2011-06-08 }} Steven Drakeley, University of Western Sydney < /ref >
