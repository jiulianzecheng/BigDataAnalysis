'''Sophism''' can mean two very different things. In [[Ancient Greece]], sophism was practiced by ''sophists'', who were a group of teachers of [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]]. In the modern definition, a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The [[word]]  " sophism "  originated from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word σόφισμα,  " sophisma "  (from σοφίζω,  " sophizo "  meaning  " I am wise " ).  
 
 The similar Greek word σοφιστής,  " sophistēs "  means  " wise-ist, one who does wisdom, one who makes a business out of wisdom "  while σοφός,  " sophós "  means a  " wise man " . 
 
 == History == 
 The [[ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Protagoras]]  
 (ca. 490–420 & nbsp;BC) is often said to be the first of the sophists. Others include: [[Gorgias]], [[Prodicus]], [[Hippias]], [[Thrasymachus]], [[Lycophron]], [[Callicles]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], and [[Cratylus]]. 
 
 [[Plato]] opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the [[truth]] and [[justice]]. 
 ==Modern usage== 
 In modern usage, ''sophism'', ''sophist'', and ''sophistry'' are [[derogatory]] terms, due the influence of many philosophers in the past. Sophism and [[platonism]] were rival schools, as enemies of each other. 
 
 A ''sophism'' is a statement to deceive someone in a [[debate]] or conversation. It might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong, or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing.  An argument ''[[ad hominem]]'' is an example of sophistry. 
 
 A ''sophist'' is a person who uses sophisms. ''Sophistry'' means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation. < ref >
