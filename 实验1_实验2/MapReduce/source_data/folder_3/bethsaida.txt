Bethsaida is a town in ancient Israel, near the sea of Galilee.  According to the first chapter of the [[Gospel of John]] the apostles Peter, Andrew, and Philip came from there. The [[Gospel of Mark]] Chapter 8 says that [[Jesus]] healed a blind man there. In the ninth chapter of the [[Gospel of Luke]] we are told that Jesus fed 5000 people using only 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish. 
 
 Modern [[Archeology|archeologists]] have not been able to prove for sure exactly where Bethsaida was.
