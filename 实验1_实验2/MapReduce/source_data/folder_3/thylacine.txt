 The '''thylacine''' ('''''Thylacinus cynocephalus''''') is an extinct species of [[mammal]]. It was a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[marsupial]] [[animal]]. The Thylacine was also known as '''[[Tasmania]]n tiger''', '''Tasmanian wolf''' and '''Tasmanian hyena'''. The last known Thylacine died in a [[Hobart]] [[zoo]] on 7 September 1936. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/wildlife/mammals/thylacin.html |title=Tasmanian Wildlife - Thylacine, or Tasmanian Tiger |access-date=2008-06-01 |archive-date=2008-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721024331/http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/wildlife/mammals/thylacin.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They once lived across [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]].

 Thylacines were common across Australia. Fossil remains have been found in Queensland, paintings have been found in Western Australia, and a [[mummification|mummified]] body was found in cave on the [[Nullabor Plain]] in [[South Australia]]. The body was dated as being 4,650 years old. < ref name=qb/ >  The thylacine began to disappear from the Australian mainland about 5,000 years ago. This is about the same time as the arrival in Australia of the [[dingo]]. Because of rising sea levels 10,000 years ago, Tasmania was separated from the Australian mainland by Bass Strait which the dingo never crossed. By the time [[Europe]]ans came to Australia in [[1788]], the Thylacine was only living in Tasmania. 
 
 Sailors on [[Abel Tasman]]'s ship in November 1642 reported seeing  " tiger "  footprints. < ref name=paddle > {{cite book|last=Paddle|first=Robert|title=The Last Tasmanian Tiger: The history and extinction of the thylacine|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia}} < /ref >   The French explorer, [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]], found a thylacine jaw bone in 1792. < ref name=paddle/ >  On May 13, 1792, he made the first confirmed sighting, which was described as being the size of a large dog, streaked with black. In 1805, Lieutenant Governor Paterson sent a description of a thylacine to Sydney. He said the animal was rare and uncommon. < ref name=paddle/ > 
 
 Thylacines were hunted because farmers said they were killing [[sheep]]. The Tasmanian government gave money to farmers for each thylacine they killed. The last thylacine shot and killed was at [[Mawbanna, Tasmania]], on 13 May, 1930, by farmer Wilfred Batty. < ref name=qb/ >  The government brought in laws to protect them a few months before the last one died. < ref name=qb/ >  They are now [[extinct]], which means there are no thylacines left alive anywhere in the world. < ref > [http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/additional/additional.htm  The last known Tasmanian tiger was named  " Benjamin " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819183932/http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/additional/additional.htm |date=2012-08-19 }}; retrieved 2012-7-5. < /ref > 
 
 == Appearance == 
 The Thylacine was about 1.8 metres (71 inches) long and its tail was up to 53 [[centimetre|cms]] (21 inches) long. It would have been about 58 centimetres (23 inches) tall and could be up to 30 kilograms (66 pounds) in weight. It was gray and brown in colour with 16 black or brown stripes on its back. It had the same shape as a dog, but the back, rump and tail were more like a [[kangaroo]]. Its tail was quite stiff. It had very short legs. < ref > {{cite web

 < /ref >  It had teeth like a dog, but with more [[incisor]] teeth. The thylacine was able to open its mouth about 120 degrees. < ref name=qb > {{cite book | last =Beresford ,Quentin  &  Bailey, Garry| title =Search for the Tasmanian tiger | publisher = Blubber Head Press| date = 1981| location =[[Hobart]], Tasmania | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-908528-06-X}} < /ref >   
 
 The thylacine was a [[nocturnal]] (night) hunting animal. They ate [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[rat]]s, [[bird]]s, [[echidna]]s, [[rabbit]]s and [[sheep]]. 
 
 The thylacines were marsupials, which means the female carried the babies in a pouch. The pouch opened to the rear. < ref name=qb/ >
