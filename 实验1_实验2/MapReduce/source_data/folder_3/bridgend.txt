 '''Bridgend''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|b|r|ᵻ|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|d}}; {{lang-cy|Pen-y-bont ar Ogwr}}, meaning  " Head of the Bridge on the Ogmore " ) is a town in [[Bridgend County Borough]] in [[Wales]], {{convert|18|mi|km|sing=on}} west of [[Cardiff]] and {{convert|20|mi|km|sing=on}} east of [[Swansea]].  The river crossed by the original bridge, which gave the town its name, is the River Ogmore, but the River Ewenny also passes to the south of the town. 
 ==History== 
 Historically a part of Glamorgan, Bridgend has grown a lot since the early [[1980s]] - the United Kingdom Census in 2001 found a population of 39,429, < ref > {{cite web|title=Key Statistics for urban areas in England and Wales|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=033488 & productId=2491 & $ph=60_61_62 & datasetInstanceId=33488 & startColumn=1 & numberOfColumns=8 & containerAreaId=6275340|work=Census 2011|publisher=UK Office for National Statistics|access-date=4 September 2013|archive-date=18 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018025715/http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/viewFullDataset.do?instanceSelection=033488 & productId=2491 & $ph=60_61_62 & datasetInstanceId=33488 & startColumn=1 & numberOfColumns=8 & containerAreaId=6275340|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and the 2011 census found that the Bridgend Local Authority had a population of 139,200 up from 128,700 in 2001. This 8.2% rise was the largest in Wales except for Cardiff. The town is undergoing redevelopment, with the town centre pedestrianised and a new business park opened.
