 A '''catwalk''' is a [[wikt:raise|raised]] [[walk]]way. The term is most often used for [[fashion]] shows, where [[Model (person)|models]] walk along showing off the [[clothes]]. A catwalk on a ship is a passageway above decks. A similar term is '''runway''', but it need not be off the ground.

The movie was shot in black and white and colour, and featured many top designers at work, like a young [[John Galliano]], [[Justin Thomas]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]], and [[Gianni Versace]] four years before his death.
