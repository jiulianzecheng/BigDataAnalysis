 In [[Hinduism]], '''Sita''' was the daughter of [[Janaka]] and wife of [[Rama]], an [[avatar]] of [[Deity|god]] [[Vishnu]]. The word Sita means “furrow”, that is, the line created on the farm when it is ploughed. She is believed to be the daughter of [[Bhūmi]] in many legends.  
 
 There is a story about Sita's birth. Her father Janaka was ploughing the land and a furrow was formed. From that furrow a [[baby]] [[girl]] came out. Janaka took the girl as his daughter and named her Sita. 
 
 In [[Hinduism]], Sita is considered a form of the [[goddess]] [[Lakshmi]]. Sita is worshiped for her greatness and for her loyalty. She was the goddess of loyalty and her responsibility.
