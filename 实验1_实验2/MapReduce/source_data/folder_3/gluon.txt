[[Photon]]s do the same thing, but for the [[electromagnetic force]]. Also, like photons, gluons are [[spin (physics)|spin]]-1 particles, and when a particle has spin-1 it is considered a [[boson]]. 
 
 Gluons are hard to study because although they exist in nature all the time, they are so small and require so much energy to break them away from quarks (about 2 trillion degrees) that scientists have only been able to find more about them from [[Particle physics#Collider|particle colliders]] such as  the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].
