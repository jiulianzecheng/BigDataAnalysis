 The '''equator''' is a line which is not real drawn around a [[sphere]] or [[planet]], such as the [[Earth]]. It is one of the lines known as a line of [[latitude]], or [[circle of latitude]]. The name  " equator "  is [[Latin]] for  " even-maker " ; at equator the day and night are exactly the same length around the year. 
 
 The equator is halfway between the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]]. There, the surface of the planet is [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] of rotation. The equator divides the surface into the [[northern hemisphere]] and the [[southern hemisphere]]. 
 
 == Climate == 
 Unlike the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, countries around the equator do not experience the four seasons, and the climate is usually very humid.
