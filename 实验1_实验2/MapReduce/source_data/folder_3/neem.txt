 * A compound from the Neem tree can be used as a [[spermicide]] . 
 * [[Neem oil]] is used for preparing [[cosmetics]] ([[soap]] and [[shampoo]], ozone as well as [[lotion]]s and others), and is useful for skin care such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] treatment.  Neem oil has been used effectively as a [[mosquito repellent]]. 
 * Neem is useful for damaging over 500 types of insects, mites, ticks, and nematodes, by changing the way they grow and act. Neem does not normally kill pests right away, rather it slows their growth and drives them away. As neem products are cheap and not poisonous to animals and friendly insects, they are good for [[pest control]] 
 *In the UK, plant protection products that contain [[azadirachtin]], the active ingredient of neem oil, are illegal. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pesticides/|title=Pesticides|website=www.hse.gov.uk}} < /ref >
