 '''[[MDMA]]''' ('''3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine'''), commonly seen in tablet form ('''ecstasy''') and crystal form ('''molly'''{{efn|U.S. English}} or '''mandy'''{{efn|U.K. English}}), is a [[psychoactive]] drug with [[stimulant]] and [[psychedelic]] effects that is primarily used as a recreational drug. < ref name=nhtsa > {{citation|title=Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy)|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/methylenedioxymethamphetamine.htm|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=5 April 2016|archive-date=3 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403053214/http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/methylenedioxymethamphetamine.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Drugs sold under the street names ecstasy, molly, or mandy are often advertised as pure MDMA, but are often mixed with multiple other drugs. < ref name=Drugs2014 > {{cite web|title=MDMA|url=https://www.drugs.com/illicit/mdma.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|editor-last=Anderson|editor-first=Leigh|website=Drugs.com|publisher=Drugsite Trust|date=18 May 2014}} < /ref >  MDMA can cause feelings of [[euphoria]] (extreme happiness) and altered sensations. Bad side effects include [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], rapid heartbeat, and [[addiction]]. It causes an initial increase in neurotransmitters that is followed by a short-term drop in neurotransmitters, which can lead to severe depression after coming down from the high. < ref name=Drugs2014/ > < ref name=NIH2016 > {{cite web|title=DrugFacts: MDMA (Ecstasy/Molly)|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/mdma-ecstasymolly|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=30 March 2016|date=February 2016}} < /ref > < ref name=palmer > {{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Robert B.|title=Medical toxicology of drug abuse : synthesized chemicals and psychoactive plants|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9780471727606|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWFiVaDZnkQC & pg=PA139}} < /ref >

 Many ecstasy tablets, especially those sold online on the “[[Darknet|dark net]]” are more potent than ever before, as well. According to one European study, while tablets in the 90s and early 2000s average about 50–80 mg, the average dose of an ecstasy tablet on the current market is now 125 mg. Some “super pills” have been marketed, with doses ranging between 270 and 340 mg. < ref > http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/2473/TD0116348ENN.pdf < /ref > 
 
 ==Effects on health== 
 MDMA has many effects on the [[human]] body and [[brain]]. It makes the brain release the chemicals [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]]. < ref name=nida > {{cite web |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/mdma-ecstasy-abuse/what-does-mdma-do-to-brain |title=What does MDMA do to the brain? |author= < !--staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=March 2006 |website=DrugAbuse.gov |publisher=National Institutes of Health – National Institute on Drug Abuse |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >  During MDMA use the body also makes more of the [[hormones]] [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]]. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Forsling ML, Fallon JK, ‘’et al.’’ 2002 |title=The effect of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,  " ecstasy " ) and its metabolites on neurohypophysial hormone release from the isolated rat hypothalamus |journal= British Journal of Pharmacology |year=2002 |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=649–656 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0704502 |pmid=11834612 |pmc=1573171 }} < /ref > 
 
 All these effects together can make MDMA dangerous to use. < ref name=nida / >  The change in body temperature and the tendency to dance for hours on end can make users dehydrate if not enough [[water]] is drunk during this time (an example of [[dehydration]] and [[hyperthermia]]). Lots of dancing can also put pressure on the heart. People with existing heart conditions are vulnerable to these negative side effects. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Impact of Ecstasy on the Body (and Treatment Options)|url=https://greenhousetreatment.com/ecstasy/|access-date=2021-07-08|website=Greenhouse Treatment Center}} < /ref >

Many people have died from this after taking MDMA. Another factor is the hormone vasopressin, which is released during MDMA use. Vasopressin restricts the body's urge to urinate, which helps to get rid of excess liquid in the body before it becomes a problem. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/hypopit/adh.html |title=Antidiuretic Hormone (Vasopressin) |last1=Bowen |first1=R |date=December 26, 2006 |website=vivo.colostate.edu |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=January 26, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 ==No current legal use== 
 Ecstasy is illegal in most, if not all, countries. In the United States, it is classified as a  " Schedule I "  drug. Schedule I drugs have no official medical use and are highly [[addiction|addictive]]. Some scientists believe Ecstasy may be useful in therapy since it has been found to reduce [[fear]] in some individuals. Recently, there has been some research on if it can help people with severe PTSD confront painful memories during therapy appointments. < ref > {{cite book|url=|title= " The therapeutic use of MDMA.
