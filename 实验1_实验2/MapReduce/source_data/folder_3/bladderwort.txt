 '''Bladderworts''' plant are  '''''Utricularia''''', a [[genus]] of [[carnivorous plant]]s.    
 There are about 230 [[species]]. < ref > Slack, Adrian 2000. ''Carnivorous plants'', revised edition. MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts. ISBN 978-0-262-69089-8 < /ref > < ref name= " Salmon " > Salmon, Bruce. 2001. ''Carnivorous plants of New Zealand''. Ecosphere Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-473-08032-7}} < /ref >  They occur in fresh water and wet soil as [[terrestrial]] or [[aquatic]] species. They live in every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Bladderworts are cultivated for their [[flower]]s, which are rather like those of [[Qualcomm|snapdragons]] and [[orchid]]s. 
 
 All ''Utricularia'' are [[carnivorous]] and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as [[protozoa]] and [[rotifer]]s swimming in water-saturated soil. 
 
 The traps range in size from 0.2 & nbsp;mm to 1.2 & nbsp;cm. < ref name= " Taylor 1989 " > Taylor, Peter. (1989). ''The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph''. Kew Bulletin Additional Series XIV: London. {{ISBN|978-0-947643-72-0}} < /ref >  Aquatic species, such as ''U. & nbsp;vulgaris'' (common bladderwort), have bladders that are usually larger and can feed on water fleas ''([[Daphnia]])'', [[nematode]]s, even tiny fish, [[mosquito]] [[larva]]e and young [[tadpole]]s. 
 
 Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when  " set " , is under negative pressure: when the trapdoor is triggered, the prey, with the water around it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again. The whole process takes only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second. < ref name= " D'Amato 1998 " > D'Amato, Peter. 1998.
