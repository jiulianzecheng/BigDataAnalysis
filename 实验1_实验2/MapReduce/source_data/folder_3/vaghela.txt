Some opines that they served as a body guards to other rulers like Guhilot while some say the epithet was given as the defender of the India’s frontier since they repulsed and threw out Arab’s from India’s heartland. In spite of their military success, they must have remained delegitimized in the eyes of masses and Brahmins because of their obscure foreign origin. The other Gujjar clans like Chauhan, Paramara, Solanki, Chavda, '''Vaghela''' and Guhilot remained the allies and fiduciary to paramount ruler of Imperial Gurjara-Pratihara.}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxtuAAAAMAAJ & q=Vaghela+subcaste+of+Gurjaras|title=Gujjars of Jammu and Kashmir|last1=Warikoo|first1=Kulbhushan|last2=Som|first2=Sujit|date=2000|publisher=Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya|pages=59|language=en|quote=The Origin of Gujjars: This fact is true in case of Vaghela Gurjara families, which is now a sub-caste of Gurjaras (Gujjar).
