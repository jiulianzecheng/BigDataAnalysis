 A '''business''' is an [[organisation|organization]] where people [[work]] together. In a business, people work to make and [[sales|sell]] [[product (business)|products]] or [[service (economics)|services]]. Other people buy the products and services. The business owner is the person who hires people for work. A business can earn a [[profit]] for the products and services it offers. The word ''business'' comes from the word ''busy'', and means doing things. It works on regular basis. 
 
 Originally, individual trades people were qualified, and they hired assistants. The invention of the joint-stock [[company]] meant a new era in business. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Joint Stock Company|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Joint+Stock+Company|encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|accessdate=4 May 2012}} < /ref >  By this means, some people put up the money as [[capital (economics)|capital]], and others used it to run the business. There is a [[law]] which says this kind of company is a  " [[legal entity]] " : it has a legal life separate from its owners or shareholders. In this way, a company can outlive the people who started it. This idea was invented in [[mediaeval|medieval]] times, but really flowered in the 19th century. < ref > Hunt B.C. 1936. ''The development of the business corporation in England, 1800â€“1867''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. < /ref >  It has spread around the world since then. 
 
 Most businesses are created for [[commerce]]. There are big and [[small business]]es. For example, one person can open a small [[barber]]-shop. A big business, like [[Microsoft]],  employs thousands of people all over the world. 
 
 Some businesses need fixed locations. Examples are an [[office]], store, or [[farm]]. For some businesses the worker goes to different locations. Examples are [[carpenter]]s or [[electrician]]s. They usually bring everything they need for work in their truck. 
 
 ''Business'' can also mean the work or current state of a business. A business owner might say:  " I am doing a lot of business "  or  " My business is good "  or  " Business is bad " . 
 
 The term can also be used in a more general way. As a noun, it can be used, for example, to speak about a broad area of activity.
