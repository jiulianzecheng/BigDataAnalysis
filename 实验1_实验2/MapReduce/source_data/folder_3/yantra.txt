 '''Yantra''' literally means loom, instrument or machine. In actual practice, a yantra is a symbol which represents aspects of the divine, such as the [[Devi|Mother Goddess]] or [[Durga]]. It is made of interlocking geometric figures, circles, triangles and floral shapes that form a pattern. Though drawn in two dimensions, a yantra can represent a three dimensional sacred object. The yantra is primarily a [[meditation]] tool. Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths.
