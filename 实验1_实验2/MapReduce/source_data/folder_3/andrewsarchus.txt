 '''''Andrewsarchus mongoliensis''''' (Andrews + [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀρχός,  " ruler " ), was a [[Predation|predatory]] [[artiodactyl]], closely related to [[Entelodont|entelodonts]], [[Hippopotamus|hippos]],[[Cetacea|whales]] and [[Mesonychid]]s 
 
 ''Andrewsarchus'' lived during the Eocene, about 45 to 36 million years ago. Because ''Andrewsarchus'' is only known from a skull and a few other bones, the animal's full appearance is unknown, but based on what is known of it and its relatives, it was most likely a stocky [[Hoof|hoofed]] entelodont-like animal. It had a long snout with large, sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones. Because Andrewsarchus is only known from a skull and a few other bones, whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate, as is its exact time range.
