 A '''boson''' is a [[particle]] which carries a [[force]]. It has a [[whole number]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] (''spin'' is a property of [[subatomic particles]]).  Bosons carry [[energy]].  
 
 A [[photon]] is an example of a boson as it has a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1 and carries [[electromagnetism]]. [[Meson]]s are also bosons as they carry [[nuclear force]]. 
 
 Bosons are different from [[fermion]]s, which are particles that make up matter, because bosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics. (This means that you can put two of them in the same place at the same time; the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] does not apply.)  
 
 [[Gauge boson]]s carry [[fundamental force]]s. There are three known gauge bosons, which are [[elementary particle]]s.  For example, the photon carries the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force. The three types of gauge bosons are: [[photon]]s for [[electromagnetism]], [[gluon]]s (eight kinds) for [[strong force]], and [[W and Z bosons]] (three kinds) for [[weak force]]. Other [[Theoretical Particle|theoretical]] gauge bosons are predicted, such as [[graviton]]s for [[gravity]]. The [[Higgs boson]] is another fundamental particle of a type called a [[scalar boson]]. 
 
 [[Paul Dirac]] named this class of particles  " bosons "  in honor of a famous Indian scientist called [[Satyendra Nath Bose]]. 
 
 The bosons include the photon, the gluon, the Z boson, W boson and the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson also might be classified by itself. Since none of them have a charge, the [[Antimatter|antimatter]] version of them will also not have any charge.
