 '''''Whatcheeria''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of early [[tetrapod]] from the early [[Mississippian]] of [[Iowa]]. Fossils have been found in an old [[limestone]] [[quarry]] in the town of [[Delta, Iowa|Delta]]. They date to 340 million year ago (mya). The [[type species]] ''W. deltae'' was named in 1995. It is classified with the closely related ''[[Pederpes]]'' in the [[Family (biology)|family]] Whatcheeriidae. < ref name=LB95/ > 
 
 ==Description== 
 ''Whatcheeria'' possesses a mixture of [[basal]] and [[derived]]  (advanced) [[Trait (biology)|traits]]. Like other [[stem tetrapod]]s it has a series of [[lateral line]]s across the skull, and rows of teeth on the [[palate]] These are basal traits derived from its [[lobe-finned fish]] ancestors. 
 
 It has a [[cleithrum]], a bone in the [[pectoral girdle]] that extends from the [[scapula]]. The cleithrum once attached to the skull in lobe-finned fish, the ancestors of tetrapods, but detached to allow the neck to move freely. < ref name=LB95 > {{cite journal |last1=Lombard |first1=R.E. |last2= Bolt|first2= J.R. |year=1995 |title=A new primitive tetrapod, ''Whatcheeria deltae'', from the Lower Carboniferous of Iowa |journal=Palaeontology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=471–495 |url=http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2038/Pages%20471-494.pdf |access-date=2012-05-25 |archive-date=2012-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324051328/http://palaeontology.palass-pubs.org/pdf/Vol%2038/Pages%20471-494.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ''Whatcheeria'' grew to about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long. The skull is deep (this is an advanced trait) and the snout is pointed.  A hole on the top of the skull behind the eyes called the [[parietal foramen]] is relatively large in ''Whatcheeria''. The bones on the skull surface are unusually smooth, unlike the pitted skulls of many other early tetrapods. < ref name=LB95/ > 
 
 === Classification === 
 With modern [[cladistic]] [[taxonomy]], Whatcheeriidae is not placed in [[Amphibia]] or any other class but simply as its own family within Tetrapoda. Its relationships with other tetrapods are left unclear.
