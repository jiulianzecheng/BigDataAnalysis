A '''hydride''' is a [[Compounds of oxygen|compound]] with [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonded]] to other elements. Except for a few of the [[Noble gas]]es, all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides. The properties of hydrides can be very different, but some of the hydrides have similar properties. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Chemistry (IUPAC)|first=The International Union of Pure and Applied|title=IUPAC - hydron (H02904)|url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/H02904|access-date=2021-05-07|website=goldbook.iupac.org|doi=10.1351/goldbook.H02904}} < /ref >   
 
 ''Metallic hydrides'': compounds with [[ionic]] bonding. They are very reactive, making them difficult to [[Solvation|dissolve]]. Most [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s form ionic hydrides. 
 
 ''Metallic'' or ''Interstitial hydrides'': These have metallic properties like good [[electrical conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]]. They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice (framework of metal atoms). Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the [[periodic table]]. Some of these are used in the [[nickel metal-hydride battery]]. 
 
 ''Covalent hydrides'': These have [[covalent]] bonds between hydrogen and the other element. Most of the [[p-block]] elements form covalent hydrides. Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated. [[Hydrocarbon]]s are the hydrides of [[carbon]], [[ammonia]] is a hydride of [[nitrogen]], and [[water]] is a hydride of oxygen. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Peter F.|last2=Johnson|first2=Brian F.
