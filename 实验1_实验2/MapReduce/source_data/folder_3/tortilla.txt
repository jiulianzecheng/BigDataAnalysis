 A '''tortilla''' is a flat [[bread]] used in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[cuisine]]. They are used in [[burrito]]s, [[enchilada]]s, and mainly as a wrap called [[taco]]. They are normally made of [[maize]] (corn), but can also be made of [[wheat]] or [[potato]]es. 
 
 In [[Spain|Spanish]] [[cuisine]], tortillas are very different; they are closer to an [[omelette]] based on potatoes, usually mixed with other ingredients like [[onion]]s, [[Sausage|pork sausages]] or other vegetables; they can be baked or cooked in a frying pan. Also many Latin-American countries call omelettes tortillas, and the ingredients can be different in every country, using their local ingredients and by choice of the chef. 
 In [[Armenia|Armenian]] cuisine a tortilla is known as [[lavash]] which is a type of flat bread.
