 '''Staffa''' is an island in the [[Inner Hebrides]] off the north-west of [[Scotland]]. It is famous for [[Fingal's Cave]] and other examples of [[basalt]] columns. No-one lives there. 
 
 The islands became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, the ''Suðreyjar'' kingdom of the [[Norse]]. The Norsemen ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266. The islands were then held by the [[Clan]]s MacLeod and MacDonald, but Staffa was not regularly inhabited. 
 
 == Geology == 
 This small island is entirely of [[volcanic]] origin. It consists of a basement of [[tuff]], underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained [[Tertiary]] [[basalt]], overlying which is a third layer of basalt [[lava]]. Slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of [[hexagonal]] [[column]]s which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. < ref name=Smith > Haswell-Smith, Hamish. 2004. ''The Scottish Islands''. Edinburgh. Canongate < /ref >  The lava contracted as it cooled and solidified into columns, a process known as columnar jointing. 
 
 The columns have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. < ref > Mitchell, Colin and Mitchell, Patrick 2005.
