 '''Unbitrium''' ({{pron-en|uːnˈbaɪtriəm}}), also known as eka-[[protactinium]] or element 123, is the  possible [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the temporary symbol Ubt and has the atomic number 123. Calculations have shown that  < sup > 326 < /sup > Ubt would be the most stable isotope. The closed neutron shells say that  < sup > 307 < /sup > Ubt and  < sup > 319 < /sup > Ubt would be the most stable isotopes.  
 
 As of February 2021, no attempt has ever been made to make element 123. 
 
 ==Naming== 
 The name unbitrium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until it is confirmed by other research groups and the IUPAC decides on a name. Usually, the name suggested by the discoverer(s) is chosen. 
 
 ==Synthesis== 
 
 This reaction would create  < sup > 307 < /sup > Ubt, which is expected to be relatively stable. 
 
 {{chem|262|103|Lr}} + {{chem|48|20|Ca}} → {{chem|307|123|Ubt}} + 3 n  
 
 == Fictional reference to element 123 == 
 In the [[fictional universe]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', this element was seemingly discovered and named. The episode  " [[Rascals (TNG episode)|Rascals]] "  depicted a  " trans-periodic table, "  in a schoolroom set, which depicted element number 123 as being named jamesium, symbol Rj, having an atomic weight of 326. The graphic was created by set artists, probably a homage to designer Richard D. James, and listed this element in the fictional  " gamma series. " 
 
 In the third episode of season one of the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' element 123 is depicted 24 minutes in as the element Gravitonium, atomic weight 308
