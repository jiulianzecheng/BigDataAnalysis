 '''Fundamentalism''' was used at first to describe some people in the [[Protestant]] community in the [[United States]] in the early [[20th century]]. These people had a set of well-defined ( " fundamental " ) values. These values were in opposition to more modern ideas. The group also said it was important to stick to what [[faith]] (and a more literal translation of the [[Bible]]) told them. When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as ''absolute''. This means that it is not possible for them to change. When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism. 
 
 Today, the term is used more generally. It is now often used to describe groups of people who are committed to behave or act according to their (mostly moral, and religious) values and beliefs even though these values may be criticised by many people or unpopular. Modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions. 
 
 Religious fundamentalism has been prevalent in [[society]] since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. People today who [[Research|study]] fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society. Today society is not as simple as it was: many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand. Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe. So some people look in their [[religion]] to see something that does not change. They also want rules about how to act that do not change. So they see their religion as this thing that does not change.

 == Terminology == 
 Some people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that name, as the term has other meanings. They do not like it because 'religious fundamentalist' has some negative ideas about it. Many people who are [[politics|politically]] ''progressive'' or ''liberal'' sometimes do not like religious fundamentalists. They believe bad things about them like that they are not clever, they are not [[education|educated]], or that they do not respect people's [[human rights]]. 
 
 Some people who are [[Christian]] fundamentalists ''do'' like that term and use it to name themselves. But they do not like being called religious fundamentalists because [[Islam]]ic fundamentalists are in this same group. 
 
 == History == 
 Fundamentalism began as a movement in the [[United States|U.S.]], starting among conservative [[Presbyterian]] [[Academia|academics]] and [[Theology|theologians]] at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. < ref name= " autogenerated2 " / > < ref name= " autogenerated4 " / >  It soon spread to conservatives among the [[Baptist]]s and other [[Christian denomination|denominations]] during and immediately following the [[First World War]]. < ref name= " autogenerated2 " / > < ref name= " autogenerated4 " / >  The movement's purpose was to ''reaffirm'' [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]] and zealously defend it against the challenges of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]], [[Germany|German]] [[higher criticism]], [[Darwinism]], and other movements which it regarded as harmful to [[Christianity]]. < ref name= " autogenerated2 " / > < ref name= " autogenerated4 " / > 
 
 The term '' " fundamentalism " '' has its roots in the [[Niagara Bible Conference]] (1878â€“1897) which defined those things that were ''fundamental'' to Christian belief. The term was also used to describe '' " [[The Fundamentals]] " '', a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by Milton and [[Lyman Stewart]] < ref name= " autogenerated2 " > {{cite web |url=http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/twentyone.html |first=Terry L. |last=Matthews |title=Fundamentalism |access-date=2008-07-27 |work=Lectures for Religion 166: Religious Life in the United States |publisher=Wake Forest University |archive-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006100127/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/twentyone.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " autogenerated4 " > {{cite book |last=Noll |first=Mark A. |title=A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada |url=https://archive.org/details/ahistoryofchrist0000noll |publisher=W.B.

 == Issues of fundamentalism == 
 Not all religious fundamentalists believe the same things. But there are many issues that they have strong beliefs about. Some of these issues are similar even in different religions. Some of these issues are: 
 * [[Abortion]] 
 * [[Homosexuality]] 
 * [[Feminism]] (or women's rights) 
 * [[Sex]] before [[marriage]] 
 * [[Contraception]] 
 * [[Religion]] as the basis for [[law]]s 
 * Teaching religion in schools 
 * [[Science]] 
 
 == Criticism == 
 Many criticisms of fundamentalist positions have been offered. One of the most common is that some claims made by a fundamentalist group cannot be proven, and are irrational, demonstrably false, or contrary to scientific evidence. . For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by [[Clarence Darrow]] in the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. 
 
 Another is that religious beliefs do not translate well into laws or social policy in diverse tolerant societies. This criticism favors [[secularism]] as a better foundation for social harmony and stability. 
 
 One of the critics, [[Elliot N. Dorff]] wrote: 
 < blockquote > In order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be (found...) among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word (requires) human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will. < ref > Dorff, Elliot N. and Rosett, Arthur, A Living Tree; The Roots and Growth of Jewish Law, SUNY Press, 1988. < /ref > < /blockquote >
