 '''Germanicus Caesar''' (24 May 15 [[BC]] – 10 October 19 [[AD]]) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[General officer|general]]. He was the son of the general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], and nephew of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. 
 
 Germanicus commanded the Roman forces in their campaign of 14/16 AD against the [[Germanic tribes]]. Three whole [[Roman legion]]s had been wiped out in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD. It was the greatest disaster in Roman military history. 
 
 Plans for the revenge were started by the Emperor [[Augustus]], and put into effect by his successor [[Tiberius]]. Germanicus had command of eight legions, one-third of the Roman Army. He destroyed the opposing German tribes, and recovered two of the three symbolic [[legionary]] eagles which had been lost. He was called back by Tiberius after he crossed the [[Rhine]]. The reasons for the recall are not agreed, but Augustus had set the Rhine as the limit of Rome's ambitions in Germany. 
 
 Germanicus was given an official triumph. A contemporary [[calendar]] gives 26 May as the day in which  " Germanicus Caesar was borne into the city in triumph " . Coins issued under his son Gaius ([[Caligula]]) depicted him on a triumphal chariot, with the reverse reading  " Standards Recovered. Germans Defeated " . < ref > Beard, Mary 2007. ''The Roman Triumph''. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. ISBN 978-0-674-02613-1 pp=107–109 < /ref > 
 
 In AD 18 he was given charge of the eastern part of the empire and fought in Asia and Egypt. Germanicus died in [[Syria]] of unknown causes.
