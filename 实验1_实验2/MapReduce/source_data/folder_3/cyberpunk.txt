 Soon, people used this word to describe William Gibson's book, ''[[Neuromancer]]''. 
 
 Cyberpunk [[author]]s put their stories in different settings. The time is usually set in the near-future and the settings are often [[dystopia]]n (characterized by misery). These are often societies with very advanced technology. Often, only a few huge [[corporation]]s control the society. These corporations control the technology. Instead of being beneficial to all, technology is used by the few corporations for their own interests only.  Many cyberpunk novels are about individual computer users. One [[hero]] fights a [[computer]]/[[Internet]] controlled society. < ref > {{Cite web

 ==Themes== 
 Common themes in cyberpunk include advances in [[information technology]] and especially the [[Internet]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[prosthetics]] and post-democratic societal control where corporations have more influence than governments. [[Nihilism]], [[post-modernism]], and [[film noir]] techniques are common elements, and the protagonists may be disaffected or reluctant [[anti-hero]]es.
