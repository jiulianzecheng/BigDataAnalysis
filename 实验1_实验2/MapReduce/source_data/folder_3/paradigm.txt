 In [[philosophy of science]], a '''paradigm''' is a way of thinking about a problem. The word comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παράδειγμα (''paradeigma''),  " pattern, example, sample " < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fdeigma παράδειγμα], 
 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library < /ref >  from the verb παραδείκνυμι (''paradeiknumi''),  " exhibit, represent, expose " < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparadei%2Fknumi παραδείκνυμι], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library < /ref >  and that from παρά (''para''),  " beside, beyond " < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F παρά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library < /ref >  and δείκνυμι (''deiknumi''),  " to show, to point out " . < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddei%2Fknumi δείκνυμι], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library < /ref >  Paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject. The idea that the [[Geocentrism|Earth is the center of the universe]], or that the [[Heliocentrism|Earth and other planets move around the sun]] are examples of paradigms. One of the first modern people to use the word was [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]]  (1742-1799), an 18th century [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]]. 
 
 In [[rhetoric]], paradeigma is known as a type of [[Mathematical induction|proof]]. The purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. A personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus|Anaximenes]] defined paradeigma as,  " actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing.

Aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another. 
 
 The original Greek term ''παράδειγμα'' (paradeigma) was used in Greek texts such as [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurge (god) used to create the cosmos. < !--- also see: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pCbPAAAAMAAJ & dq=paradigm Here's] its usage in 1931 in philosophy-- >  The term had a technical meaning in the field of [[grammar]]: the 1900 ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in [[rhetoric]], as a term for an illustrative [[parable]] or [[fable]]. In [[linguistics]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] used ''paradigm'' to refer to a class of elements with similarities.
