 '''''Astrodon''''' (meaning  " star-tooth " ) was a long-necked plant-eating [[dinosaur]], a relation of ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''. The [[sauropod]] was about 30 feet (9 m) long. It lived during the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period, about 130 million to 120 million years ago. ''Astrodon'' is known from teeth and scattered bones found in [[Maryland]]. Astrodon is the state dinosaur of Maryland. ''Astrodon'' was named by Johnston in 1859. The type species is ''A. johnstoni''. ''Astrodon'' may be the same as ''[[Pleurocoelus]]''. 
 
 Carpenter and Tidwell (2005) accepted Hatcher's argument that there is only one species of sauropod dinosaur known from the Arundel Formation and that ''Astrodon johnstoni'' is it. Interestingly, the majority of the bones of ''Astrodon'' are of juveniles, and Carpenter and Tidwell considered the two species named by Marsh, ''P. nanus'' and ''P. altus'', as different growth stages of ''Astrodon johnstoni''. < ref name= " carpenter & tidwell2005 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/thunderlizardssa00tidw|title=Thunder lizards: the sauropodomorph dinosaurs|author=Carpenter, Kenneth|last2=Tidwell, Virginia|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-253-34542-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thunderlizardssa00tidw/page/38 38]â€“77|chapter=Reassessment of the early Cretaceous sauropod ''Astrodon johnstoni'' Leidy 1865 (Titanosauriformes)}} < /ref >
