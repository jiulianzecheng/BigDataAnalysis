The '''Moors''' were the [[Muslim]] < nowiki/ > s who lived in the [[Maghreb]] and on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Sicily]] and parts of Southern [[France]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In [[Europe]], the word was often used for [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] European people whose [[ancestor]]s were converted to [[Islam]], although Islam was not actually invented until 700 A.D., so the religion of the Moors who are indigenous to Europe was something else.  
 
 In 750 A.D. the [[Umayyad Dynasty]] was defeated in [[Syria]]. Many refugees came to what is now [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They had a very big [[influence]] on the [[culture]] of these countries. 
 
 Umayyad Muslims were the ones who captured and named [[Al-Andalus]], which means land of the [[Vandals]]. The majority of Moors in [[Iberia]] were native [[Europe]]an populations who converted to [[Islam]] due to the [[Arab]] conquests of the peninsula. These Moors were forcefully converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] after the [[Christianity|Christian]] reconquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in completion of the period popularly known as the [[Reconquista]].
