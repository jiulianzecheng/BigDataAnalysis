 '''Fjellheisen''' or '''Tromsø Cable Car''' is an [[Cable car|aerial tramway]] in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]. It has a lower station in [[Tromsdalen]] and an upper station called Storsteinen, which offers a panoramic view of the [[city]], surrounding [[Island|islands]], and [[Fjord|fjords]]. The [[cable car]] is a popular starting point for [[Hike|hikes]] to [[Tromsdalstinden]], an iconic [[Mountain|peak]] visible from the [[city]]. It is busy in [[summer]] due to [[cruise ship]] passengers wanting to experience the [[midnight sun]] and is also an excellent place to view the [[Aurora|Northern Lights]] in [[winter]]. Fjellheisen was built by Brødrene Jakobsens Rederi in [[1960]] and officially opened on February 22, [[1961]]. It is currently owned by Skips AS Nordfisk and operated by Utelivsbyen AS. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cable Car|url=https://www.visittromso.no/cable-car|access-date=2023-03-16|website=Visit Tromso|language=en}} < /ref >
