 '''''Gorilla''''' is a genus of [[Homininae|African apes]] commonly known as '''gorillas'''. They are divided into two species, the [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla'') and the [[eastern gorilla]] (''Gorilla beringei'').  
 
 == Behavior == 
 Gorillas may be aggressive when attacked or provoked, but they are naturally gentle. They are generally [[herbivore]]s, which means that they eat plants. But they also eat [[insect]]s. 
 
 == Life span == 
 A gorilla's [[lifespan]] in the [[wild]] is between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more because they have more [[food]] and [[health care]]. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.colszoo.org/news_room/press_releases/colo_queen_of_the_columbus_zoo_celebrates_year_55.aspx | title = Colo, Queen of the Columbus Zoo, celebrates year 55 | publisher = Columbus Zoo  &  Aquarium | date = 16 December 2011 | accessdate = 10 February 2012 | author = Wilson, J. | archive-date = 9 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101806/http://colszoo.org/news_room/press_releases/colo_queen_of_the_columbus_zoo_celebrates_year_55.aspx | url-status = dead}} < /ref >

 [[File:Homininae.svg|center|frame|[[Tree of life (biology)|Evolutionary tree]] of the superfamily [[Hominoidea]]. 
 It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons ([[Hylobatidae]]) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily [[Ponginae]] broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe [[Hominini]] (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe [[Gorillini]]]] 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Gorillas are large apes. Fully grown males are can be very strong. An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 225 kilograms and stand 1.8 meters in height. Gorillas live in family groups called troops. They have a broad chest, wide shoulders, short legs, and long strong arms. They have black [[skin]] and [[hair]]. Adult male gorillas' hair becomes silver/grey on their backs as they become older. Because of that, older males are called  " silverbacks " . 
 
 There is a much bigger difference in sizes between the sexes than is the case with humans. 
 
 == Life == 
 [[File:Mapa distribuicao pans.png|thumb|140px|Where ''gorillas'' live]] 
 
 Gorillas live in the [[rainforest]]s in central [[Africa]]. They mostly live on the ground, but they can also climb. When on the ground, they walk on their [[knuckle-walk|feet and finger knuckles]]. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite news|title=These fists were made for walking|publisher=Nature|date=March 23, 2000|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/news000323-7|accessdate=July 8, 2020|author=Henry Gee|archive-date=February 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214103532/https://www.nature.com/articles/news000323-7|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name= " Ringer " > {{cite news|url=https://thedaily.case.edu/arent-humans-knuckle-walkers/|publisher=The Daily|accessdate=July 7, 2020|title=Why aren't humans 'knuckle-walkers'?|date=April 9, 2018|archive-date=July 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709062642/https://thedaily.case.edu/arent-humans-knuckle-walkers/|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name= " Conv " > {{cite journal|title=Knuckle-walking Anteater: A Convergence Test of Adaptation for Purported Knuckle-Walking Features of African Hominidae|journal=Am J Phys Anthropol|year=2005|volume=128|issue=3|pages=639–58|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20192|accessdate=July 8, 2020|author=Caley M Orr|pmid=15861420|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15861420/|archive-date=July 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200708152037/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15861420/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Troops of gorillas wander slowly through the forests of Central Africa. For about half of their day they search for leaves, vines, and bamboo shoots to eat. Sometimes they also eat ants or termites. For the rest of the day, they lay in the sun and play with their children. If another gorilla threatens them, the troop's leader, the silverback, protects them by rearing up and beating his chest. Although mostly vegetarian, they have long [[canine teeth]] or fangs that the adult males sometimes use to fight each other for the troop leadership. 
 
 Gorillas sleep in nests that they build on the ground. At the end of each day, each adult gorilla spends a few minutes putting together a soft, flat bed made of leaves, branches, and moss. The young gorillas sleep with their mothers. 
 
 The gestation period (when a baby grows inside the mother) of a gorilla lasts between eight and ten months. Gorillas almost always produce one offspring - twins are rare. Gorilla babies begin to hang onto their mothers when they are only a few hours old and will continue to do so for the next three years. Gorillas live up to 50 years in the wild and up to 54 years in captivity. < ref > Blue Planet Level 5, Dinorah Pous, p71{{ndash}}72. < /ref >
