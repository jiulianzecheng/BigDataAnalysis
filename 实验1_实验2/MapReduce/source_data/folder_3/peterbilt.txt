 == History == 
 The company can trace its roots to the Fageol Motor Company. < ref name=Beach16 > J.E. Beach, ''Peterbilt: Long-Haul Legend'' (Minneapolis: MBI Pub. and Motorbooks, 2008), pp. 16–20 < /ref >  It was a regional truck maker that started in [[Oakland, California]] in 1916. The company made [[automobile]]s, [[truck]]s and [[tractor]]s. The company made trucks that could stand up to the tough conditions of the [[desert]]s and [[mountain]]s of the [[western United States]]. < ref name=Beach16/ >  In 1923 they shut down all other products to concentrate on trucks. They made trucks from the 1920s and 1930s. Due to the [[Great Depression]], the company went into [[bankruptcy]] in 1932. < ref name=Beach16/ >  It kept operating under control of its [[creditor]]s but by 1938 was about to shut down. < ref name=Beach16/ >  In 1939 the company [[asset]]s were purchased by T.A. Peterman, a [[log]]ger and [[businessman]] from [[Tacoma, Washington]]. < ref name=Beach16/ >  The name Peterbilt was already being used by one of his wood products companies and was used for his new truck manufacturing company. < ref name=Beach16/ >
