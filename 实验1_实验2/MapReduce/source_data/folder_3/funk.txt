'''Funk''' is a type of music from the [[United States]] that was developed in the 1960s by [[African American]] musicians and singers such as [[James Brown]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and The Meters. Funk music emphasizes the [[rhythm]] of the music. Funk music is [[dance music]] that mixes [[rhythm and blues]] music with [[soul music]]. 
 
 Funk [[Band (music)|bands]] use many rhythm [[musical instrument|instruments]], such as [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drum]]s, and [[keyboard instruments]], mainly [[synthesizer]]s and [[electronic organ]]s. Funk bands also have people who play [[brass instrument|horns]], including [[saxophone]]s, [[trumpet]]s, and [[trombone]]s. 
 
 == Role of the electric bass == 
 In funk music, the electric bass has a more important role than in other styles of popular music. Many funk songs are based on a strong bass line (melody) played by the electric bass player. Well-known funk bass players include Bootsy Collins, [[Louis Johnson]] and Larry Graham of Sly  &  the Family Stone. Larry Graham invented a new style of electric bass playing called  " slap bass technique. "  With this technique, the bass player slaps and plucks the strings to create a strong rhythm. 
 
 == History == 
 === Late 1960s === 
 The United States singer and musician [[James Brown]] was one of the first funk musicians. James Brown recorded a song in 1965 called  " Papa's Got a Brand New Bag "  which is considered the first funk song. Other musical groups copied the rhythms and musical style developed by James Brown and his band. A band called The Meters played funk music in [[New Orleans]]. The Meters had hit songs such as  " Sophisticated Cissy "  and  " Cissy Strut "  in 1969. Another funk group, [[The Isley Brothers]], had a hit song in 1969 called  " It's Your Thing " . 
 
 === 1980s === 
 In the 1980s, funk music changed. Funk musicians began using electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]] keyboards and electronic drum machines instead of electric bass, electric organ, trumpets, saxophones, and drums. [[Rick James]] had hits in the 1980s with funk songs such as  " Give It To Me Baby "  and  " Super Freak. "  The band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] had funk songs such as  " Another One Bites The Dust.
