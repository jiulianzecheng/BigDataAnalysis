 A '''gentleman''' is an historical term used in the [[British]] [[class system]] for an educated man who is [[wealthy]]. Its significance is that in a class system, people were educated, lived and worked in quite different ways according to the circumstances of their birth. This is behind the otherwise strange divide in sports like [[cricket]] between [[amateur]] and [[professional]]s (who often played in the same side), and between [[Rugby Union]] and [[Rugby League]]. 
 
 This distinction is needed to understand many of the [[novels]], [[theatre|plays]], and [[films]] of the pre-[[WWII]] era. Similar distinctions ran in most other countries before the modern era. Consider the characters in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' as an example.
