 Up to the advent of [[Christianity]] the term was not used like that in the Greek-speaking world. Orthodoxy is opposed to ''[[heterodoxy]]'' ('other teaching'), ''[[heresy]]'' and ''[[Schism (religion)|schism]]''. People who profess a doctrine considered to be false by the majority are most often called heretics. People who separate themselves from the body of believers, i.e. from [[full communion]], are called schismatics. -- >
