 The '''Camargue''' a place in [[France]] near where the [[Rhone]] river flows into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. < ref name=NatGeo > {{cite magazine|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/road-trip-through-wild-camargue-delta-arles-provence|publisher=National Geographic|author=Kimberly Lomato|accessdate=January 2, 2022|date=March 28, 2019|title=Take a road trip through this wild, beautiful French delta}} < /ref >  Before it flows into the sea, the Rhone splits into two smaller rivers, forming a triangle.  The Camague is the [[floodplain]] in that triangle between the two smaller rivers. This place is the '''Grande Camargue''' (Great Camargue). A smaller part just outside the triangle is named the '''Petite Camague''' (Little Camargue). The Carmargue is about {{convert|150|km}} long from east to west, and {{convert|100|km}} long from north to south. Part of it is a [[nature reserve]]. 
 
 The Camargue is important to the [[wildlife|animals that live there]]. Almost 400 types of birds live in the Camargue.  There are also black bulls and horses. < ref name=NatGeo / >  Many birds stop in the Camargue to rest when they [[migration|fly south for the winter or north for the summer]]. There have been 30,000 [[Greater flamingo|flamingos]] there at the same time, and common [[crane (bird)|cranes]] there as well. There are also [[European pond turtle|European pond turtles]]. People have brought [[coypu]] to live there. As with any [[wetland]], there are [[mosquito]]es. In the Camargue, there are 40 different species of mosquito. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.parc-camargue.fr/oiseaux-camargue.html|title=Une multitude d'espèces|language=fr|date=January 2, 2022}} < /ref > 
 
 == Economy == 
 Few people actually live in the Camargue. Its biggest City is [[Arles]], just north of the triangle. Arles has about 60,000 people, and a long history. The economy in Camargue is based on three things: 
 
 * Agriculture {{ndash}} Growing [[wine]], [[Cereal|cereals]] and [[rice]]; Raising [[livestock]] - there's a special kind of bovine from the Camargue; there are also feral horses in the Camargue 
 * Tourism – like the rest of [[Provence]] and the French Mediterranean coast. There are people who come to visit the nature reserve 
 * There is little [[industry]] and [[commerce]] – salt is taken from seawater, and processed. This is mostly done in [[Salin-de-Giraud]], and [[Aigues-Mortes]]
