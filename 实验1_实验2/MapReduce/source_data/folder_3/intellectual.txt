An '''intellectual''' is a person who uses his or her [[intellect]] and [[critical thinking]] skills to work, study, reflect, or ask and answer questions about a wide variety of different [[idea]]s. Intellectuals are often times [[author]]s, [[Artist|artists]], [[Writer|writers]] for [[Newspaper|newspapers]], and college professors. 
 
 There are some people who do not like intellectuals because they are not traditional or practical. This is called  " anti-intellectualism " .
