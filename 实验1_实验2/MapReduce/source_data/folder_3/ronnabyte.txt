A ronna'''byte''' (R'''B''') is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[Computer|computers]] of the future. One ronnabyte holds 1000 [[Yottabyte|yottabytes]] ('''YB''') or a octillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) [[Byte|bytes]]. 1000 ronnabytes make up 1 [[quettabyte]]. 
 
 A ronnabyte is so large that it would take about a trillion [[Supercomputer|supercomputers]] to store this amount of data.
