A '''federation''' is a union of a number of self-governing [[state]]s or regions, which are joined together under a central government.  The central government is not able to do a lot of things that central government in more centralized states can.  These things are done by the states (or regions) in a federalized state. 
 
 The [[United States of America]] is a federation. The federal (central) government has the highest executive role. However, state governments can exercise any powers as long as those powers are not assigned to the federal government (by the [[United States Constitution]]) and if those powers are not prohibited by the states themselves. 
 
 [[Australia]] became a Federation in 1901. 
 
 After the 1971 [[civil war]], [[Pakistan]] became a Federation adopted in the [[1973 Constitution of Pakistan]]. 
 
 Other examples of federal states are [[Austria]], [[Belgium]] (since 1993), [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]] and [[Switzerland]].
