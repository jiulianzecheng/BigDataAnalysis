 '''Trowbridge''' is the [[county town]] of [[Wiltshire]], a [[county]] in England. It is on the River Biss in the west of the county, 8 miles (13 km) south east of [[Bath, Somerset]], separated by the Mendip Hills, which rise 3 miles (4.8 km) to the west. The town is also 38 miles (61 km) south of [[Gloucester]] and 20 miles (32km) south east of [[Bristol]]. 
 
 Trowbridge has been a [[market town]] for a long time. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been a very important part of the town's growth because it allowed coal to be moved from the Somerset Coalfield. This began steam-powered wool production in mills, which the town is famous for. The town was a very important producer of clothes and blankets in the south west of England. Because of this, in the late 18th century and early 19th century, it had the nickname of  " The [[Manchester]] of the West " . < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=228|title=My Page  < !-- Title -- > |last=Webmaster|first=Wiltshire Council|website=Wiltshire Council|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-25|archive-date=2016-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514201545/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom.php?id=228|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
