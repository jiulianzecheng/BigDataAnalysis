 The '''Aristolochiaceae''', or '''Birthwort family''', are a family of [[flowering plant]]s with seven [[genera]] and about 400 [[species]] belonging to the order [[Piperales]]. The type genus is ''[[Aristolochia]]'' [[Carl Linnaeus|L.]] 
 
 == Description == 
 They are mostly [[Perennial plant|perennial]], [[herbaceous plant]]s, [[shrub]]s, woody [[vine]]s or even [[liana]]s. 
 
 The membranous, cordate simple [[Leaf|leaves]] are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. There are no [[stipule]]s. 
 
 The bizarre [[flower]]s are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical. 
 
 == Classification == 
 The Aristolochiaceae are [[magnoliid]]s, a basal group of [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] which are not part of the large categories of [[monocot]]s or [[eudicot]]s. 
 
 Some newer classification schemes place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order [[Piperales]]. 
 
 == Phytochemistry == 
 Many members of ''Aristolochia'' and some of ''[[Asarum]]'' contain the toxin [[aristolochic acid]], which [[defence against predators]], in this case [[herbivore]]s. It is known to be [[carcinogen]]ic in [[rat]]s. ''Aristolochia'' itself is carcinogenic to [[human]]s. 
 
 === Ecology === 
 Pipevine [[Swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail butterflies]] lay their [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s on pipevine (''Aristolochia'' species), and the [[Caterpillar|larvae]] dine on the plant but are not affected by the [[toxin]], which then offers the adult butterfly protection against [[predator]]s.
