 '''''Brontosaurus'''''  < ref > meaning  " thunder lizard "  (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''brontē'' = thunder + ''sauros'' = lizard) < /ref >  is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]].  
 
 ''Brontosaurus'' was originally named by its discoverer [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1879. ''Brontosaurus'' had long been considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''[[Apatosaurus]]''. Its only species was reclassified as ''A. excelsus'' in 1903.  
 
 However, an extensive study published in 2015 concluded that ''Brontosaurus'' was a valid genus of sauropod distinct from ''Apatosaurus''. < ref name=TMB2015 > Tschopp E; Mateus O.V.  &  Benson R.B.J. 2015.

 ''Brontosaurus'' is a member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Diplodocidae]], a [[cladistics|clade]] of gigantic [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Supersaurus]]'', and ''[[Barosaurus]]''. ''Brontosaurus'' is closely related to ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' in the subfamily Apatosaurinae. < ref name=TMB2015/ >
