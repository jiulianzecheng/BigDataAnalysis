[[File:Lek Prevent zawierający mifepriston.jpg|thumb|Mifepristone pills]] 
 '''Mifepristone''' is a [[synthetic]] [[steroid]] that is used as a [[drug]]. It can be used to cause a [[medical abortion]] in the first two months of [[pregnancy]]. It can also be used as an [[emergency contraceptive]].  It is often known as '''RU-486''', the name it had in early tests. It was discovered by [[Roussel Uclaf]] in [[France]] in 1980.  
 
 When it is used for an abortion, it is usually combined with another drug. It is delivered as a pill that is taken by mouth. When it is used as a form of emergency contaception, the dose is usually lower. 
 
 Where it is legal, it is usually sold as a [[prescription]] drug. Before taking it, people often need to see a doctor, who can check that the drug is safe to take. In some cases, the drug also needs to be taken while under the supervision of a pharmacist or a doctor. 
 
 Other than to end a pregnancy, the drug is also used for peope with [[Cushing's syndrome]]. These people produce too much [[Cortisol]], and the drug can act against that.

 == Situation in the U.S. == 
 Especially in the United States, there's a [[Abortion debate|debate]] whether [[abortion]] should be legal, and available to women.  
 
 In April 2023, during the ''[[Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. US Food and Drug Administration]]'' lawsuit, federal district judge [[Matthew J. Kacsmaryk]] issued a preliminary [[injunction]] suspending the approval of mifepristone. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite news|last=Belluck|first=Pam|date=2023-04-07|title=Texas Judge Invalidates FDA Approval of the Abortion Pill Mifepristone|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/health/abortion-pills-ruling-texas.html|access-date=April 7, 2023|archive-url=https://archive.today/20230408075712/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/07/health/abortion-pills-ruling-texas.html|archive-date=April 8, 2023}} < /ref >  This ruling would come into effect a week later. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   Also in April 2023, in a lawsuit brought by 17 U.S. states and the [[District of Columbia]], federal district judge [[Thomas O.

 * Abortion is against their [[Ethics|ethical]] values, therefore a drug that causes aborion should not be taken 
 * The drug is not safe to take, and there may be unwanted side effects. 
 
 In March 2022, during a debate in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] about anti-abortion legislation, Republican representative Danny Bentley made several false claims, including the assertion that mifepristone had originally been called [[Zyklon B]] and had been developed by the Nazis during World War Two. After several Jewish advocacy groups including the [[American Jewish Committee]] complained about Bentley's comments, he later apologized for any harm he had caused, stating that he  " clearly should have been more sensitive with (his) comments " , but failed to correct the false statement regarding the development of the drug. < ref > {{cite news|date=2 March 2022|title=Kentucky lawmaker apologizes for referencing Jewish women's sex life amid abortion debate|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|url=https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-general-assembly/2022/03/02/kentucky-lawmaker-danny-bentley-invokes-holocaust-jewish-women-sex-life-floor-speech/9350236002|url-status=live|access-date=6 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220629032704/https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-general-assembly/2022/03/02/kentucky-lawmaker-danny-bentley-invokes-holocaust-jewish-women-sex-life-floor-speech/9350236002/|archive-date=29 June 2022|vauthors=Watkins M, Sonka J}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|date=4 March 2022|title=Kentucky politician sparks outrage with comments on Jewish women's sex in error-laden argument against abortion|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kentucky-danny-bentley-jewish-women-b2028155.html|url-status=live|access-date=6 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220305183241/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kentucky-danny-bentley-jewish-women-b2028155.html|archive-date=5 March 2022|vauthors=Grasiosi G}} < /ref >
