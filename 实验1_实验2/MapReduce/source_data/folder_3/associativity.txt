'''Associative property''' is a property of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] operations (like [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]). It means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator (like +) in a row, the [[order of operations]] does not matter. 
 
 
 For example, if you have  < math >  2+5+10\  < /math > , there are two plus signs (+) in a row. This means we can add it in either this order: 
 
 :  < math >  (2+5)+10=(7)+10=17\  < /math > 
 
 Or this order: 
 
 :  < math >  2+(5+10)=2+(15)=17\  < /math > 
 
 The answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative. 
 In other words, associativity means: 
 
 :  < math >  (2+5)+10=2+(5+10)\  < /math > 
 
 
 Not all operations are associative. [[Subtraction]] is not associative, which means: 
 
 :  < math >  (10-5)-2\ne10-(5-2)  < /math > 
 
 This is true because: 
 :  < math >  (10-5)-2=(5)-2=3\  < /math > 
 :  < math >  10-(5-2)=10-(3)=7\  < /math > 
 And: 
 :  < math >  7\ne3  < /math > 
 
 
 Also, associativity is different from [[commutativity]], which lets you move the numbers around.
