 '''Rubidium''' is [[chemical element]] 37 on the [[periodic table]]. Its symbol is '''Rb'''. Its [[atomic mass]] is 85.47. It has 37 [[proton]]s and 37 [[electron]]s. It is a soft silver colored [[metal]]. It was first discovered in 1861 by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchoff]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. < ref name=rsc/ > 
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Rubidium melts at a very low [[temperature]], for example it could melt in a person's hand. Rubidium is an [[alkali metal]]. It can make an [[amalgam]] with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 Rubidium is very [[chemical reaction|reactive]]. It will ignite in air because it reacts with many other elements in the air like [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. < ref name=rsc > {{cite web |url= http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/pages/data/rubidium_data.html |title=Visual Elements: Rubidium |first= |last= |work=rsc.org |year=2011 |accessdate=26 June 2011}} < /ref >  Rubidium reacts very violently with water to make hydrogen and [[rubidium hydroxide]], a strong corrosive [[base (chemistry)|base]]. The reaction is normally very hot so the hydrogen [[Combustion|ignites]]. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 [[File:Rubidium chloride.JPG|thumb|right|alt=|Rubidium chloride]] 
 Rubidium forms [[chemical compound]]s in only one [[oxidation state]]: +1. Some rubidium compounds have a mixed oxidation state, though. [[Rubidium chloride]] is the most common rubidium compound. [[Rubidium hydroxide]] and [[rubidium carbonate]] are also used commonly. Rubidium compounds makes a red-violet color in a flame. Most rubidium compounds are colorless. Rubidium compounds are not as common as other [[alkali metal]] compounds, such get sodium compounds. Otherwise, they are similar. 
 
 *[[Rubidium chloride]], similar to [[sodium chloride]] 
 *[[Rubidium hydride]], strong [[reducing agent]] 
 *[[Rubidium hydroxide]], powerful [[base (chemistry)|base]] 
 *[[Rubidium nitrate]], strong [[oxidizing agent]] 
 *Rubidium[[Rubidium oxide|oxide]], yellow, strong base when dissolved in water 
 
 ==Occurrence and preparation== 
 Rubidium is about as common as [[zinc]]. It is the 23rd most common element in the [[Earth]]'s crust. < ref name=rsc/ >  Most minerals only have a small amount of rubidium in them. It normally comes in small quantities in other [[mineral]]s. It is made by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of rubidium ores with [[calcium]]. It is expensive because calcium is difficult to make and the rubidium needs to be kept in [[argon]] and away from water or air. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 There are not many common uses for rubidium. Rubidium compounds are sometimes used in purple fireworks. It and its compounds are used mainly in science research though. It is also used to make [[superoxide]] ions. It is used in some special types of glass. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Rubidium compounds are not very dangerous in the human body; however, if a person gets too much from eating, they could get sick because it acts like other alkali metal ions such as [[sodium]] ions in [[sodium chloride]]. Rats can live with up to half of their potassium replaced with rubidium, though it is not likely for that to happen. 
 
 Rubidium metal is very dangerous. It reacts with air and water and makes the corrosive substance rubidium hydroxide.
