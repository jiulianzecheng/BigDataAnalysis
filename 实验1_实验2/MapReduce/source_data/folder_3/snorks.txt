 '''''Snorks''''' is an [[United States|American]]-[[Belgium|Belgian]] [[animated]] [[television series]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], and created by Belgian comics [[Freddy Monnickendam]]. 
 
 ==Story== 
 The Snorks are a race of small, colorful, fictional beings that live happily in the underwater world of Snorkland. They have [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]s on their heads, which are used to propel them swiftly through the water. As evidenced by the cartoon series, when a Snork becomes excited their tube makes a '' " snork " '' sound.  Like [[the Flintstones]] or [[the Smurfs]], they have much of the same technology as contemporary humans, adapted to their own aquatic environment. The Snorks use clams as currency, a reference to the slang word '' " clam " '', meaning '' " dollar. " '' 
 
 According to the Snork back-story, a few ventured to the surface (which the Snorks believe is  " [[outer space]] " ) in [[1643]], and watched a [[Royal Navy]] ship being attacked by [[pirates]]. The [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] wound up in the water, and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life, to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing a book about the Snorks, although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks. Since then, Snorks have adopted several human habits, such as wearing clothes.
