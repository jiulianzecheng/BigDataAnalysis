 '''''Hyouka''''' (or the Japanese name  " 氷菓 " ; English:  " [[Ice cream|Ice Cream]] " ) is a slice of life and a mystery [[novel]] written in 2001 by Honubo Yonezawa. It is the first volume of the ''Classic Literature Club'' series. There are also 2 other adaptations of this novel, which include: [[Anime]] [[adaptation]], as well as a [[Manga]] adaptation. The anime adaptation was produced by ''Kyoto Animation'' and directed by ''Yasuhiro Takemoto.'' It consists of 22 episodes filled with many mysteries, which often begin with a simple question. The anime adaption aired (or was watchable) from April 22nd to September 16th, 2012. The anime adaptation was illustrated (or drawn) by ''Taskohna''.  
 
 == Plot == 
 The mystery genre of Anime and Manga was dull (or boring) until the Manga and Anime adaptation started ''airing''. The whole plot of Hyouka revolves around a high-school (grade 9 - 12) boy, Ho(u)taro Oreki, who solves multiple mysteries without even him noticing (except some parts where he ''does''). The basic concept of Hyouka was very simple (or plain) at the time it was airing. In fact, it was too simple that many people thought it just a regular mystery anime or manga. However, as simple as the concept is, the build-up is very mesmerizing (or fascinating), to say the least. Fans who were interested ''or not interested'' in mystery were mesmerized by the build-up of the riddles (or mysteries), that take place in the anime or manga.
