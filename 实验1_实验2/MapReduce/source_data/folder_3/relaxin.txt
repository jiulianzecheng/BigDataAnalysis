 '''Relaxin''' is a [[peptide]] [[hormone]]. < ref name= " pmid9112071 " > {{cite journal | author = Bani D | title = Relaxin: a pleiotropic hormone. | journal = General Pharmacology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = 1997 | pmid = 9112071 | doi=10.1016/s0306-3623(96)00171-1}} < /ref > 
 
 == Function == 
 === In humans === 
 Relaxin is produced in females. It rises to a peak about 14 days after [[ovulation]], and then declines if the egg is not fertilised. During the first three months of pregnancy, levels rise and more relaxin is produced. Relaxin adjusts blood supply during pregnancy. It also relaxes pelvic [[ligaments]]. < ref name= " pmid21613576 " > {{cite journal | author = Conrad K.P. | title = Maternal vasodilation in pregnancy: the emerging role of relaxin | journal = Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. | volume = 301 | issue = 2 | pages = R267–75 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21613576 | pmc = 3154715 | doi = 10.1152/ajpregu.00156.2011 }} < /ref >   It softens the [[pubic symphysis]] (the ligaments joining the bottom of the pelvis). 
 
 In males, relaxin also has a function: it enhances motility of sperm in [[semen]]. < ref name= " pmid2497805 " > {{cite journal | author = Weiss G | title = Relaxin in the male | journal = Biol. Reprod. | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–200 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2497805 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod40.2.197 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/40/2/197 | access-date = 2017-06-24 | archive-date = 2008-11-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081122033040/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/40/2/197 | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === In other animals === 
 In animals, relaxin widens the [[pubic bone]] and facilitates [[childbirth|labor]]. It also softens the [[cervix]] (cervical ripening), and relaxes the uterine musculature. Thus, for a long time, relaxin was looked at as a pregnancy hormone. However, its significance may reach much further. Relaxin affects [[collagen]] metabolism, inhibiting collagen synthesis and enhancing its breakdown. < ref > {{cite journal | title = Endogenous relaxin regulates collagen deposition in an animal model of allergic airway disease | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 147 | issue = 2 | pages = 754–61 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16254028 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1006 | last1 = Tang | first1 = Mimi L.
