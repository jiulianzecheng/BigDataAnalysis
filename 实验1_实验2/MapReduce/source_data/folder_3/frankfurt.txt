 '''Frankfurt''', officially '''Frankfurt am Main''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁaŋkfʊʁt ʔam ˈmaɪn|lang|De-Frankfurt_am_Main-pronunciation.ogg}}; [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]]: ''Frangford am Maa'', {{lit.}}  " [[Franks|Frank]] [[ford (crossing)|ford]] on the{{efn|an dem → am}} [[Main (river)|Main]] " ), is one of the biggest cities in [[Germany]]. The city of Frankfurt has a [[population]] of 700,000. The [[metropolitan area]], called [[Rhine-Main]] after its two biggest rivers, has over four million people. Frankfurt is an important centre for traffic and for the financial business. The [[Frankfurt International Airport]] is the largest in Germany, and one of the largest in the world. Frankfurt's train station is one of the largest, and its highway crossing is the centre of Germany's street network. Frankfurt is the seat of the [[European Central Bank]], the German Federal Bank (Bundesbank) and of the biggest German banks, and it has an important [[stock exchange]] where [[share (finance)|shares]] of German companies are traded. 
 
 Frankfurt is on the [[Main]] river. The city's name means ''ford of the Franks'' - a [[ford]] is a place in a river where it is so shallow that you can walk through it, and the [[Franks]] were a [[Germanic people]] which existed in the first [[millennium]]. So, this was a place where travellers could cross the river without a boat. The frankish [[king]]s built a [[palace]] and a [[church]] here. Over the [[century|centuries]], this group of buildings grew to be a big city which was famous for international [[trade]] and [[fair]]s, like today. Frankfurt was one of the most important cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and its [[emperor]]s were crowned here. In the [[19th century]], Frankfurt was the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[German Confederation]] which was founded after the Holy Roman Empire fell apart. During the [[European Revolutions of 1848|revolution of 1848]], the first freely [[election|elected]] German [[parliament]] worked in Frankfurt. 
 
 During the [[Industrial Revolution]], many [[Factory|factories]] and [[railway]] lines were built in Frankfurt and its [[suburb]]s. In the city centre, a lot of big buildings were built, like an [[opera]] house, [[theatre]]s, stock exchange, [[railway station]]s, [[department store]]s or [[museum]]s. [[Tram]] lines were constructed to make travelling inside the growing city easier. In [[World War II]], the old city was totally destroyed by airplane bomber attacks. After the war, Germany was divided into two parts, and Frankfurt became the economic capital of [[West Germany]] while [[Bonn]] was chosen to be the political capital. 
 
 Frankfurt is a very international city. Every third inhabitant is not German. Most immigrants come from southeastern [[Europe]], [[Turkey]] and [[North Africa]], but there are people from almost every country living in Frankfurt. There are also many international business companies here, and the big airport links Frankfurt with many countries in the world. Many [[bank]]s are based in Frankfurt, which is why so many are offered there. Frankfurt has some of the tallest buildings in Europe, which is why the city is although called  " Mainhattan " . 
 
 The largest shopping street in Frankfurt is called the Zeil. 
 
 ''Frankfurter'' is also a name for a [[hot dog]], or [[sausage]], because they are said to have originated in the city. 
 
 Frankfurt has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]).
