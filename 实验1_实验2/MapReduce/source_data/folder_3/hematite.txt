 '''Hematite''' or '''haematite''' is the main [[ore]] of [[iron]]. It is mostly [[iron(III) oxide]]. Millions of tons are dug up every year. This is usually to feed to [[blast furnace]]s to make [[steel]]. It is a [[mineral]] related to [[corundum]]. It is an [[Oxide mineral|oxide]]. 
 
 It has a metallic [[Luster (mineralogy)|luster]]. It has no cleavage (the way a mineral breaks). It has a [[Material fracture|fracture]]. The fracture is irregular and uneven. Hematite on the [[hardness]] scale is 5 to 6. It has a bright red to dark red streak. To find the streak, you take the [[mineral]] and run it across a plate of [[Glaze|unglazed]] [[porcelain]]. The colours can be metallic grey to a dark, rough and earthy red colour. Hematite has the [[chemical formula]] of Fe < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 3 < /sub > .
