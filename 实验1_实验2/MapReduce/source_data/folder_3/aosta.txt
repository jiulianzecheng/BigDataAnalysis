 '''Aosta''' ({{lang-it|Aosta}}, {{lang-fr|Aoste}}) is a city in northern [[Italy]]. It is the capital city of the [[Valle d'Aosta]] ({{lang-fr|Vallée d'Aoste}}) region. It is roughly in the middle of the region, along the [[Dora Baltea]] ({{lang-fr|Doire baltée}}), the main river that flows in the valley. It is at 583 & nbsp;m above sea level. Around the city there are many mountains (the [[Alps]]). 
 
 [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the area in 25 & nbsp;BC. Later, the city was conquered by the [[Frankish Empire]] after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Finally, it went under control of the [[House of Savoy]] in the 11th century. Many Roman buildings still survive in the city, like the east and south [[gate]]s. The basic plan of the city, with rectangular blocks of streets, is Roman. 
 
 == History == 
 The valley of Aosta is a typical [[alpine]] valley, cut into a V-shape by [[glaciers]] during the [[ice age]]. It runs from an upper part near [[Mont Blanc]] to lower areas like the city of Aosta. 
 
 The area has been [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], French and Italian ([[House of Savoy]]) before the [[unification of Italy]]. All street names are in French and Italian, and dialects of French are still spoken by many. 
 
 === Roman Aosta === 
 The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] defeated the local ''Salassi'' tribe in 25 & nbsp;BC. < ref > {{cite book| last = Lempriere| first = John| title = Bibliotheca Classica: Or, A Dictionary of All the Principal Names and Terms Relating to the Geography, Topography, History, Literature, and Mythology of Antiquity and of the Ancients; with a Chronological Table| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D6QPAAAAYAAJ| year = 1839| publisher = W.E. Dean| isbn = | page = 281 }} < /ref >  Their commander, Marcus Terentius Varro, then founded the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony of ''Augusta Praetoria Salassorum'', housing 3,000 retired [[veteran]]s. 
 
 After 11 & nbsp;BC Aosta became the capital of the ''Alpes Graies'' ( " Grey Alps " ) province of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. 
 
 ==== Significance ==== 
 Aosta is at the join of two rivers. It is at the end of the [[Great St Bernard Pass]] (which leads to [[Switzerland]]) and the [[Little St Bernard Pass]] (which leads to France). Its position gave it considerable military importance, and the layout of the town was that of a Roman military camp. 
 
 The valley was a way for trade and soldiers to get from Italy to [[Gaul]] (later, France). This explains its importance to the Romans. Now it sits  near the Italian entrance of the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]]. 
 
 At present [[Aosta Valley]] is a semi-autonomous region in northwestern Italy. It is the smallest region in Italy, and is not divided into provinces. 
 
 == Aostan == 
 Aostan French ({{lang-fr|français valdôtain}}) is the variety of [[French language|French]] spoken in the [[Aosta Valley]], where many speak some form of French. Some expressions, words and phrase constructions are different from standard French; some are similar to [[Swiss French]]. Some words come from the [[Piedmont]]ese language or [[Italian language|Italian]]. Both modern French and Italian mix with this local ''[[patois]]'', ''valdôtain'', which is Franco-[[Provençal]] in type.
