 == History == 
 Lucca was founded by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. It later became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[village]] in 180 BC. The Romans built an [[amphitheatre]] that is still seen in the Piazza dell'Anfiteatro. Lucca was an important city and [[fort]]ress even in the [[6th century]], when Narses [[wikt:attack|attacked]] it over and over again for several months in [[553]]. During the [[10th century|10th]] and [[11th century|11th centuries]], Lucca was the capital of the feudal territories of Tuscany, with more power about the Roman Emperor. 
 
 After the death of Matilda of Tuscany, the city began an independent [[Medieval commune|commune]]. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent [[republic]]. There were many minor communes in the region between southern [[Liguria]] and northern Tuscany (which was filled by the Malaspina). Tuscany in this time was part of feudal [[Europe]]. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]’s ''Divine Comedy'' was written to remember the days spent in his [[exile]] in Lucca. 
 
 In [[1273]] and again in [[1277]], Lucca was ruled by a Guelph (captain of the people) named Luchetto Gattilusio. In [[1314]], after internal problems Uguccione della Faggiuola of Pisa make himself lord of Lucca. The people of the city made him leave two years later and ''condottiere'' gain the [[leadership]]. In [[1325]], in the battle of Altopascio, Lucca soldiers defeated [[Florence]]'s Guelphs with the help of Castracani, a leader of the city in time of war. After they won, Castracani was named  " Duke of Lucca "  by Louis IV the Bavarian. Until the [[French Revolution]] in [[1789]], Lucca was independent from [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. It was a city controlled by [[democracy]] or sometimes by [[oligarchy]]. 
 
 === Republic of Lucca === 
 Lucca was the second largest Italian [[city-state]] (after [[Venice]]) with a republican constitution ( " comune " ). In [[1805]] Lucca was taken over by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who put his sister Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi in the place reserved for the  " Queen of Etruria " . The city became a part of [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]] in [[1847]] and later a part of [[Italy]].
