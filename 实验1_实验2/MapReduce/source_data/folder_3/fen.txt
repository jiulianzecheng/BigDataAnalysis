 A '''fen''' is a type of [[wetland]]. It is usually fed by [[mineral]]-rich surface water or [[groundwater]]. < ref > Godwin K.S. ''et al'' 2002. Linking landscape properties to local hydrogeologic gradients and plant species occurrence in New York fens: a hydrogeologic setting (HGS) framework. ''Wetlands'', '''22''', 722–37. < /ref >   Fens have [[pH|neutral]] or [[alkali]]ne water, with dissolved minerals but few other plant [[nutrients]]. They are usually dominated by [[grass]]es and [[sedge]]s, and typically have brown [[moss]]es like ''Scorpidium'' or ''Drepanocladus''. < ref name=Keddy > Keddy P.A. 2010. Wetland ecology: principles and conservation. 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press. < /ref > < sup > p8 < /sup >   
 
 Fens may have a high diversity of other plant species, including [[carnivorous plant]]s such as ''[[Pinguicula]]''. < ref name=Keddy/ > < sup > ch9 < /sup > < ref > Wheeler B.D. and Giller K.E. 1982.

''Journal of Ecology'', '''70''', 179–200. < /ref >  Fens may occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level keep soil wet, with few woody plants. < ref > Charlton D.L.  &  Hilts S. 1989. Quantitative evaluation of fen ecosystems on the Bruce Peninsula. In ''Ontario Wetlands: inertia or momentum?'' eds. M.J. Bardecki and N. Patterson, pp. 339–54.

 The distribution of individual species of fen plants is connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations. < ref > Slack N.G; Vitt D.H.  &  Horton D.G. 1980. Vegetation gradients of minerotrophically rich fens in western Alberta. ''Canadian Journal of Botany''. '''58''', 330–50. < /ref > < ref > Schroder H.K. ''et al'' 2005. Rejecting the mean: estimating the response of fen plant species to environmental factors by non-linear quantile regression. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'', '''16''', 373–82. < /ref > 
 
 Fens have a characteristic set of plant species, which indicate environmental conditions. They are called  " fen indicator species " . < ref > Godwin K.S. ''et al'' 2002. Linking landscape properties to local hydrogeologic gradients and plant species occurrence in New York fens: a hydrogeologic setting (HGS) framework. ''Wetlands'', '''22''', 722–37. Table 3. < /ref > 
 
 Fens are distinguished from [[bog]]s. Bogs which are [[acid]]ic, low in minerals, and usually dominated by [[sedges]] and shrubs, with abundant ''[[Sphagnum]]'' mosses. < ref name=Keddy/ > < sup > p8 < /sup > 
 
 Fens have been damaged in the past by land [[drainage]], and also by [[peat]] cutting. < ref > Sheail J.  &  Wells T.C.E. 1983. The Fenlands of Huntingdonshire, England: a case study in catastrophic change. In ''Ecosystems of the World'', vol. 4B Mires: Swamp, Bog, Fen and Moor – Regional Studies. ed. A.J.P. Gore, pp. 375–93. Amsterdam: Elsevier. < /ref >   Some are now being carefully restored with modern management methods. < ref name=Keddy/ > < sup > ch13 < /sup >  The principal challenges are to restore natural water flow regimes, to keep the quality of water, and prevent invasion by woody plants.
