 '''Ssir√ªm''', or '''Korean wrestling''', is a very old [[sport]]. It is shown in [[picture]]s that are [[paint]]ed on walls in the ancient [[grave]]s in [[Korea]].  
 
 This kind of [[wrestling]] was formed in Korea. It took place on days of  " public enjoyment "  that were created by [[custom]].  Similar to [[Sumo]]. the man who stays on his feet until the end was the winner. He was given the title ''changsa'' ( " the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] "  or  " the strong man " ). He was also given an [[ox]].  
 
 As Korea grew [[industry|industrially]], this type of wrestling has become a real sport. It has support in the form of the teams of [[professional]] athletes coming from [[college]]s and [[University|universities]]. There are also [[organization]]s for the national [[Championship]] Ssirum Changsa. There are competitions in the country.  
 
 Two fighters fight on the [[sand]] inside a [[circle]]. They each put on  " satpa "  - a piece of [[cloth]] that ties around the [[waist]] and [[thigh]]s. Using their [[hand]]s, [[leg]]s backs, they try to make the other person fall.  
 
 Most wrestlers are {{convert|1.8|-|2|m|ftin}} in height and  {{convert|100|-|150|kg|lb}} in weight. The fights can seem slow at first they are actually very [[dynamic]].  
 
 [[Li Man-ki]] is one of the most well known sportsmen in this sport. In the 1980s, he won the title ''changsa'' (''jangsa'') many times. He has caused much of the interest of this sport.
