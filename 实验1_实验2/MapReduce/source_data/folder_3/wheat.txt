 '''Wheat''' ([[Genus]]: ''Triticum'') is a [[cereal]] grain. People eat it most often in the form of [[bread]]. It is a kind of [[grass]] whose [[fruit]] is a  " head of wheat "  with [[wikt:edible|edible]] [[seeds]]. It was first grown in the [[Levant]], a region of the [[Near East]]. Now it is cultivated worldwide.

Almost 800,000,000 tonnes are harvested every year. 
 
 Wheat was a key factor enabling the emergence of city-based societies at the start of [[civilization]]. It was one of the first crops that could be easily cultivated on a large scale, and its seeds could be stored for long periods in a dry climate. Wheat helped the growth of city-states in the [[Fertile Crescent]], including the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Assyria]]n and [[persia]]n empires.

 An allergy to wheat (mostly from its [[gluten]]) can cause [[coeliac disease]], which makes the sufferer have [[diarrhoea]] if they eat any food containing wheat. 
 
 == Description == 
 The wheat plant has long, slender leaves, stems that are hollow in most types of wheat plants, and heads that have many kinds of flowers, from 20 to 100. The flowers are grouped together in spikelets. Each spikelet has two to six flowers. In most spikelets, two or three of the flowers become fertilized, and this makes them produce the grains used for food. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/641558/wheat |title=wheat (plant) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |accessdate=29 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 ===  Cultivated species of wheat === 
 All cultivated wheats have more than one normal [[diploid]] set of [[chromosomes]]. The increases in chromosome sets occurs naturally at a low rate. Because they have more chromosomes, their ears of wheat are larger.  All man did was to select the plants with extra fat ears of wheat when they occurred. Now a whole range of cultivated wheats are available. These are just a few: 
 
 [[Ploidy|Hexaploid]] species (six sets of chromosomes) 
 *'''[[Common wheat]]''' or '''Bread wheat''' (''T. aestivum'') & nbsp;– A [[ploidy|hexaploid]] species that is the most widely cultivated in the world. 
 *'''[[Spelt]]''' (''T. spelta'') & nbsp;– Another hexaploid species cultivated in limited quantities. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species [[common wheat]] (''T. aestivum''), in which case its botanical name is considered to be ''Triticum aestivum'' subsp. ''spelta''. 
 
 [[Ploidy|Tetraploid]] species (four sets) 
 *'''[[Durum]]''' (''T. durum'') & nbsp;– The only tetraploid form of wheat widely used today, and the second most widely cultivated wheat. 
 *'''Emmer''' (''T. dicoccon'') & nbsp;– A [[ploidy|tetraploid]] species, cultivated in [[Ancient history|ancient times]] but no longer in widespread use. 
 
 [[Diploid]] species (normal two sets of chromosomes) 
 *'''Einkorn''' (''T. monococcum'') & nbsp;– A [[diploid]] species with wild and cultivated variants. Domesticated at the same time as emmer wheat, but never reached the same importance.

 '''Emmer wheat''' (''Triticum dicoccum''), or 'hulled wheat', < ref name=GRIN > {{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?314587 |title=USDA GRIN Taxonomy |access-date=2014-12-26 |archive-date=2012-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921005953/http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?314587 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  is a type of ''awned'' wheat. < ref > ''Awns'' are the [[bristle]]-like structures you can see in the diagram < /ref >  It was one of the first [[crops]] [[domestication|domesticated]] in the [[Near East]]. It was widely cultivated in the ancient world, but is now a [[relic]]t crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. 
 
 In the wild, the awns of emmer wheat spikelets help them dig into the [[soil]].  With [[humidity]] in the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil.  During the day, the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again.  During the course of days and nights, the awns' pumping movements drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil. < ref > {{ cite journal | last = Elbaum, Rivka | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = The role of wheat awns in the seed dispersal unit | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 316 | issue = 5826 | pages = 884 & ndash;886 | doi = 10.1126/science.1140097 | url = | accessdate = | quote =| pmid = 17495170 | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..884E | s2cid = 42898148 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Einkorn wheat == 
 '''Einkorn wheat''' is one of the [[domestication|earliest cultivated forms]] of wheat, (''Triticum monococcum''). Grains of wild einkorn have been found in [[Paleolithic]] [[Archaeological site|sites]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was first domesticated about 7500 BC (~9000 years ago), in the early [[Neolithic]] period. < ref > {{cite book | author = Hopf, M.; Zohary, D. | title = Domestication of plants in the Old World: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in west Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 2000 | page = 38 | isbn = 0-19-850356-3 | edition = 3rd }} < /ref >   Evidence from [[DNA]] suggests einkorn was domesticated in southeast [[Turkey]], where a number of early farming villages have been found. < ref name= " Heun1997 " > {{ cite journal | author = Heun M. | display-authors = etal | title = Site of einkorn wheat domestication identified by DNA fingerprinting | year = 1997 | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1312–1314 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1312 | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1312H }} < /ref >   Its cultivation decreased in the [[Bronze Age]], and today it is a [[relic]] crop that is rarely planted. It has found a new market as a health food. It is still used for [[bulgur]] (cracked wheat) or as animal feed, in mountainous areas of [[France]], [[Libya]], former [[Yugoslavia]], [[Turkey]] and other countries. It often survives on poor soils where other species of wheat fail. < ref > Zohary and Hopf, ''Domestication'', pp. 33f < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.world-grain.com/articles/10295-focus-on-libya|title=Focus on Libya}} < /ref > 
 
 Einkorn was domesticated at the same time as emmer wheat, but was not so important.
