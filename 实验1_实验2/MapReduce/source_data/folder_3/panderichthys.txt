 '''''Panderichthys''''' is a [[genus]] of extinct [[sarcopterygian]] ([[lobe-finned fish]]). It lived in the late [[Devonian]] period, about 380 [[mya]]. Possible [[tetrapod]] tracks dating back to before the appearance of ''Panderichthys'' in the fossil record were found. This suggests that ''Panderichthys'' is not a direct ancestor of [[Tetrapod|tetrapods]]. It shows the traits which evolved during the [[fish]]-[[tetrapod]] evolution. < ref >  Niedzwiedzki, G., Szrek, P., Narkiewicz, K., Narkiewicz, M and Ahlberg, P., Nature 463(7227):43–48, 2010, Tetrapod trackways from the early Middle Devonian period of Poland, 7 January 2010. < /ref > < ref > Clack, Jennifer A.

 Decreased oxygen in the atmosphere would have caused the [[oxygen]] concentrations in [[water]] to decrease. This  would have caused any aquatic animal which could breathe [[air]] to have an advantage, and be more likely to thrive.   
 
 In addition to its ability to swim in [[water]], ''Panderichthys'' could also [[Breathing|breathe air]]. Its strong pectoral [[Fin|fins]] might allow it to prop up its head in shallow water and take a breath. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Panderichthys'' is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in{{ndash}}6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large [[tetrapod]]-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back.  
 
 In January 2010, ''Nature'' reported well-preserved and  " securely dated "  tetrapod tracks from Polish marine tidal flat sediments approximately 397 million years old. These fossil tracks suggest that a group of two meter long tetrapods lived in the fully marine intertidal or lagoonal areas on the south coast of Laurussia. This implies that ''Panderichthys'' is not a transitional fossil and represents its own adaptive morphology. Therefore, ''Panderichthys'' can only be a  " late-surviving relic " , showing traits that evolved during the transition from fish-like creatures to tetrapods, but whose date does not reflect that transition. The tracks  " force a radical reassessment of the timing, ecology and environmental setting of the fish–tetrapod transition, as well as the completeness of the body fossil record " .
