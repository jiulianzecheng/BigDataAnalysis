 '''Eroticism''' is the quality of [[sex]]ual excitement. In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be ''erotic''. Eroticism is an ''erotic'' feeling. It is named after [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] god of [[love]]. 
 
 Many types of things can be part of ''eroticism''. Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the [[sight]], [[touch]], [[Odor|smell]], and [[sound]] of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way.  
 
 Sometimes ''eroticism'' has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a [[magazine]], listening to a piece of [[music]], reading a [[story]] or article, or just thinking their own [[thought]]s, or being aware of their own body. In fact, everything can be eroticism for someone.

 Most people believe there is a difference between ''erotica'' and ''[[pornography]]'', but some people have argued that all ''erotica'' is  " pornographic " . (In other words, some people believe that all pictures, movies or writing which are sexually exciting are rude and wrong, and should not be made.) 
 
 People who have studied this subject say that erotica is not harmful to anyone, and may be helpful with people's loving relationships. The same writers say that pornography, which generally shows a person being treated without respect or love, is not helpful with people's loving relationships. < ref name=MIT > [http://www-tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html Erotica is Not Pornography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408042014/http://www-tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html |date=2008-04-08 }}, William J.
