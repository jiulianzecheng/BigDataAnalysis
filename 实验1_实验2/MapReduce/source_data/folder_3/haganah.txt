The [[Haganah]] was a [[militia]] group that [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]] created to [[fight]] against [[Arab]] [[terrorist]]s and protect the [[Jew]]s in [[British Mandatory Palestine]].  It also helped Jewish [[refugee]]s get into Palestine from [[Europe]].  Jabotinsky left after the Haganah started to support [[Labour Zionism]].  The Haganah ended up being led by [[David Ben-Gurion]].  Ben-Gurion and the Haganah still started to fight the British in 1939 when the British tried to stop Jewish [[immigration]] and tried to stop the creation of the [[state of Israel]]. But after [[Hitler]] attacked [[Poland]], the Haganah stopped fighting against the British and started to fight for the [[British Empire]] against the [[Nazi]]s.  In 1944, Ben-Gurion helped the British fight against [[Menachem Begin]] and the [[Irgun]] and he helped the British fight against [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and the [[Lehi (group)|Lechi]].  After the war ended, Ben-Gurion and the Haganah fought against the British to get them to let the Jews have a [[country]]. After, Israel became a country, the Haganah, Irgun and Lechi became the Israeli army.
