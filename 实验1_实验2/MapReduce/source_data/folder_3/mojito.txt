 When making a mojito, lime [[juice]] is added to sugar and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently [[wikt:mash|mashed]] together. The mint leaves should only be [[wikt:bruise|bruised]] to release the [[essential oils]]; they should not be torn apart. < ref name= " wb " > {{cite web |author=Posted by Fumi |url=http://www.wasabibratwurst.com/mojito-recipe/ |title=How to Muddle a Mojito |publisher=WasabiBratwurst.com |accessdate=1 September 2011 |archive-date=11 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811202518/http://www.wasabibratwurst.com/mojito-recipe/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Then rum is added.

 There are several stories about how the mojito was invented. One story says that it is similar to a 19th-century drink called  " El Draque " , after [[Francis Drake]]. < ref name=latimes / >  This drink is said to have been given to the crew of Drake's ships when they came to Cuba in the 16th century. Many in the crew were suffering from [[dysentery]] and [[scurvy]]. They were told that the [[Native American]]s had remedies for various tropical illnesses. They went ashore on Cuba and were given [[ingredient]]s for a remedy: a kind of rum, lime, [[sugarcane]] [[syrup]] and mint. < ref >  {{cite book |last=Burkhart |first=Jeff|year=2012 |title=Twenty Years Behind Bars: the spirited adventures of a real bartender |edition=1st |publisher=PhotoCine Media |isbn=9780985500115}} < /ref >  While this drink was not called a mojito at this time, it is the same combination of these ingredients. < ref name=latimes / >
