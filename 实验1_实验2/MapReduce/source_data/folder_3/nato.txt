 The '''North Atlantic Treaty Organization''' (sometimes known as the '''North Atlantic Alliance''', the '''Atlantic Alliance''' or the '''Western Alliance'''), also simply called '''NATO''' is a [[military alliance]] mostly in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. It was established by the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] in 1949 and it was signed in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]], on April 4, 1949. Its headquarters are in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Its other official name means the same in [[French language|French]]: ''Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique nord'' (''OTAN''). 
 
 == Languages == 
 NATO has two [[official language]]s, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], as defined in Article 14 of the North Atlantic Treaty. 
 
 == History == 
 Its members in 1949 were the [[United States]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]]. On [[18 February]] [[1952]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] also joined. 
   
 When [[West Germany]] joined the organization on [[9 May]] [[1955]] it was described as  " a decisive turning point in the history of our continent "  by Halvard Lange, Foreign Minister of Norway at the time., < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/9/newsid_2519000/2519979.stm|title=1955: West Germany accepted into Nato|date=9 May 1955|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}} < /ref >  the result was the [[Warsaw Pact]], signed on [[14 May]] [[1955]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[satellite state]]s as response to NATO. 
 
 After the [[Cold War]] in 1999 three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland joined NATO. On [[29 March]] [[2004]] seven more Northern European and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries joined NATO: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] and also [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]]. 
 
 [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]] received NATO membership invitation on [[3 April]] [[2008]]. The [[Republic of Macedonia]] received the only conditional invitation because it was vetoed by Greece because of its name dispute with Greece. 
 
 [[Montenegro]] joined on 5 June 2017.   < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_144647.htm|title=Montenegro joins NATO as 29th Ally|last=NATO|website=NATO|language=en}} < /ref >  Having changed its name to end the dispute, 
 [[North Macedonia]] joined NATO on 27 March 2020 and became its 30th member. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2020/0327/1126854-north-macedonia/ | title=North Macedonia officially joins NATO | website=[[RTÉ.ie]] | date=27 March 2020 }} < /ref > 
 [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] officially joined NATO on 8 September 2020 as an observer. 
 
 In April 2023, [[Finland]] joined NATO, following efforts to join since the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.euronews.com/2023/04/04/finland-joins-nato-in-the-alliances-fastest-ever-accession-process |publisher=[[Euronews]] |date=2023-04-04 |accessdate=2023-04-04 |title=Finland joins NATO in the alliance's fastest-ever accession process |last=Laverick |first=Evelyn}} < /ref > 
 
 Apart from this, [[Iceland]] also threatened to leave during the [[Cod Wars]], which would put the UK at fault, and NATO would lose a key position in the North Atlantic. They did not leave as they won the Cod Wars. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lv0xEFtUc0 | title=The FISH  &  CHIPS Wars: U.K. Vs Iceland | website=[[YouTube]] }} < /ref >
