 '''Carbonatite''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|k|ɑr|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|ə|t|aɪ|t}}) is a type of [[igneous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It has greater than 50% [[carbonate]] [[mineral]]s. < ref > Bell, Keith (editor) 1989. ''Carbonatites: genesis and evolution''. London, Unwin Hyman. < /ref >   Carbonatites may be confused with [[marble]], so may need geochemical analysis to make sure. 
 
 Carbonatites usually occur as small [[Volcanic plug|plugs]], or as [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], [[Sill (geology)|sills]], [[breccia]]s, and [[vein (geology)|veins]]. They are almost all near or in continental [[Rift (geology)|rift]]-related [[tectonic]] settings.  
 
 It seems that there has been a steady increase in the carbonatitic [[igneous]] activity through the Earth's history, from the [[Archean]] [[eon]] to the present. Carbonates in general are typical products of life-forms.
