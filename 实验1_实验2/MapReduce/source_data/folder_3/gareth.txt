 '''Gareth''' was one of the [[Knights of the Round Table]] in [[King Arthur]]'s Court. In [[Sir Thomas Mallory]]'s classic story, ''Le Morte D'Arthur'' ( French for  " the death of Arthur " ), Gareth is given the nickname of  " Beaumains "  by [[Sir Kay]]. After one year, Gareth revealed his identity as Sir Gawain's brother and went on a quest as a gift from Arthur. 
 
 He was named a [[knight]] by [[Sir Lancelot]] after a [[jousting]] and [[sword]] fighting challenge. He dies in the same story, which is the last in the series. < ref > Norris J.
