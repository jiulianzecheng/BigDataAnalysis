 A consultant is usually an expert or a professional, in a specific field, who also has a wide knowledge of the subject matter. < ref > Pieter P. Tordoir (1995). ''The professional knowledge economy: the management and integration services in business organizations.'' p.140. < /ref >  A consultant usually works for a consultancy firm or is self-employed, and engages with multiple and changing clients. Thus, clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in-house, and may purchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired. 
 
 'Consultant' is also the term used to denote the most senior medical position in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (e.g., a consultant [[surgery|surgeon]]).
