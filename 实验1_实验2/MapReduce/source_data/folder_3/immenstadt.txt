 == History == 
 Immenstadt was first mentioned in a 1275 administrative document. It was granted town privileges in 1360 by emperor Charles IV. This makes it one of the oldest towns in the area. It was the seat of the counts of Königsegg-Rothenfels until 1804. Immenstadt was a garrison town in the [[First World War]], and was bombed once in the [[Second World War]]. In 1999 parts of the municipality were flooded. < gallery widths= " 200 " >
