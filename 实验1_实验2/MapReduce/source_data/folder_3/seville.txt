 '''Seville''' ({{lang-es|Sevilla}}) is a city in the southern parts of [[Spain]]. A river called the [[Guadalquivir]] River goes through Seville. The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] [[Andalusia]] and of the province of [[Province of Seville|Sevilla]]. People from Seville are called ''Sevillanos.'' 
 
 == History == 
 A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of [[Greece]], named [[Hercules]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] when they came to Spain gave it the [[Latin]] name of Hispalis. Over time this changed to be spelled in English as ''Seville''. The [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]] took the city when they invaded the country, and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800-year stay in [[Spain]] ([[711]]-[[1492]]). 
 
 In [[1992]] Seville was the place for the Expo 92. There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called ''Puente del Alamillo''. It was thought up by Santiago Calatrava a famous building expert. 
 
 Seville is famous for its hot summer weather. Su equipo por excelencia,el sevilla fc , no el betis que es una *ierda, obtuvo 15 champioNs la pasada temporada.VIVA JESUS NAVAS
