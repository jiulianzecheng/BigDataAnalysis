 A '''geyser''' is a [[hot spring]] which shoots out water and [[steam]]. < ref > The word ''geyser'' comes from ''[[Geysir]]''. ''Geysir'' is the name of an [[wikt:erupt|erupting]] spring at Haukadalur, [[Iceland]]. Geysir's name came from the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] [[verb]] ''geysa''. This means  " to gush (pour, flow) " . The verb from [[Old Norse]]. < /ref > < ref name=brit > {{Cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232281/geyser |title=geyser (geology) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=britannica.com 
  |accessdate=15 July 2010}} < /ref >  They erupt when pressure has built up, often at regular intervals. There are about a thousand geysers around the world. About half are in [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. < ref > Bryan T.S. 1995. < /ref > 
 
 == Causes == 
 Geysers are made in special [[geology|geological]] conditions. Only a few places on [[Earth]] have these conditions. Because of this, geysers are not very common. One place is the Yellowstone National Park, which is the remains of a gigantic [[volcano]]. Another is [[Iceland]], which sits on top of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], where new [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] is formed. 
 
 Geysers are often near [[active volcano]]s. This is because the geyser is caused by [[magma]]. < ref name=brit/ >  Surface water usually goes down to about {{convert|2000|m|ft}}. There, it mixes with hot rocks. The [[pressure|pressurized]] water begins to boil. When it is pressured enough, hot water and steam burst out of the geyser. 
 
 === Form and function ===

 Individual geysers do not last forever, but ''systems'' of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues. The oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old. < ref name= " wyo " / >  Geysers are usually near volcanic areas. < ref name= " wyo " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.wyojones.com/how__geysers_form.htm |title=Conditions needed for the formation of geysers |work=wyojones.com |accessdate=15 July 2010 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053235/http://www.wyojones.com/how__geysers_form.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  As the water boils, the pressure increases. This forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser. Geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes. < ref name= " wyo " / > 
 
 ;Great heat  
 :A geyser needs a lot of heat . This heat comes from magma. This magma needs to be near the surface of the earth. Geysers need much more heat than is usually found near the earth's surface. This is why they are often around volcanoes or volcanic areas. 
 
 
 ;Water 
 :The water that bursts from a geyser must travel underground through deep, high-pressure cracks in the earth's crust. 
 
 ;A [[plumbing]] system 
 :For the heated water to form a geyser, a plumbing system is needed. The water needs to be held while it is being heated. < ref name= " wyo " / >  The plumbing system is made up of a system of [[Material fracture|fractures]], [[fissure]]s, spaces and sometimes cavities (holes). 
 
 Most importantly, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser become high enough to start boiling the water. Steam bubbles come out of the top of the column. They burst through the geyser's vent. Some water flows or splashes out. This makes the weight of the column of water and the pressure on the water below less. When this pressure is released, the hot water turns into steam. It boils violently. < ref name= " wyo " / > 
 
 == Solar system == 
 There are several bodies in the [[Solar System]] where jet-like eruptions, often called  " geysers "  and  " cryogeysers " , have been seen. Unlike geysers on Earth, these are eruptions of gas, together with dust or ice particles, but without [[liquid]]. 
 
 Water vapor streams have been seen near the south pole of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. [[Nitrogen]] eruptions have been seen on [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. [[Carbon dioxide]] eruptions from the southern polar [[ice cap]] of [[Mars]] have also been seen.
