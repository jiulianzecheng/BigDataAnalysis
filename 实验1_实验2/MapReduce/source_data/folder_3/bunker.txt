 A '''bunker''' is a [[military]] building for [[fortification]]. They are usually built below ground. [[Blockhouse]]s are like bunkers, but are built above ground.  Bunkers were of big importance during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  Bunkers were built during the [[Cold War]] for important political people and for the general public because of the scare of a [[nuclear war]]. 
 
 ==Types of bunkers== 
 There are many different types of bunkers: 
 
 === Trench === 
 A [[trench]] is long and narrow.  It may be part of a big system of trenches.  Soldiers often dig and use trenches.  When most of the front-line soldiers use trenches, it is called [[trench warfare]]. < ref > ''[http://archives.queensu.ca/wwi/warfare.html An archival look at World War I] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219002104/http://archives.queensu.ca/wwi/warfare.html |date=2008-12-19 }}'' from the [[Queen's University]] Archives, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

 ===Pillbox=== 
 A pillbox is a small building made of [[concrete]] that also has small windows that people can shoot guns out of.  The name came from the fact that they look like the boxes that pills came in. < ref > ''[http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/whypillbox.htm Why Pillbox?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926061025/http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/whypillbox.htm |date=2009-09-26 }}'' - Hellis, John; an article from the ''Loopholes'' journal with further references. Retrieved 2007-09-08. < /ref > 
 Pillboxes were used a lot during [[World War I]] when [[defence in depth]] was being used.  Pillboxes are most often found [[Military camouflage|camouflaged]] so that they are harder to spot.  They can also be part of a trench system, where the pillbox is a firing step that has been built to take grenade blasts and smaller mortar fire.  Pillboxes were also built to help protect strategic structures such as bridges or jetties. 
 
 ===Industrial=== 
 Industrial bunkers are built like regular bunkers and they can be mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes places that people live in.  They were built by nations during World War II to help protect the important industries from getting bombed.  Many [[mining|mines]] in [[France]] and [[Germany]] were made into bunkers by both the Germans and the French in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. 
 
 ===Bomb/fallout shelters===  
 A [[bomb]] shelter or [[fallout shelter]] is a type of bunker, usually [[civilian]] bunker, used for protection against [[nuclear weapons]] and the toxic [[radiation]]  " fallout "  they leave behind. These shelters run the gammit from modified [[storm shelters]] to vast underground [[cities]] 
 
 ==Famous bunkers== 
 Famous bunkers include the World War II V-weapon buildings in Germany (e.g., [[Mittelwerk]], [[La Coupole]], and [[Éperlecques]]) and the Cold War buildings in the United States ([[Cheyenne Mountain]], [[Site R]], and [[The Greenbrier]]) and Canada ([[Diefenbunker]]). 
 
 ===Examples of bunkers=== 
 * ''[[Atlantic Wall]]'', coasts of [[Western Europe]], built by [[Nazi Germany]] during WWII 
 * ''[[Maginot Line]]'', eastern France, built by [[France]], pre-WWII 
 * ''[[Führerbunker]]'', built by [[Nazi Germany]] before and during WWII
