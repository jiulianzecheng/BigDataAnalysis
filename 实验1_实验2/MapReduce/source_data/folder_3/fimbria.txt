 The '''fimbria''' are projections of tissue that come out from the ends of the [[Fallopian tube]]s. They appear to be in the shape of fingers. The largest of these fimbria, the fimbria ovarica, is attached to the [[ovary]]. The fimbria form a funnel shape that helps move the egg cell ([[ovum]]) into the Fallopian tube and then the [[uterus]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2018-01-30|title=Fallopian Tube Disorders: Overview, Salpingitis and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Salpingitis Isthmica Nodosa|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/275463-overview}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.gfmer.ch/International_activities_En/El_Mowafi/Fallopian_tube.htm|title=Fallopian Tube|website=www.gfmer.ch|access-date=2018-03-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | last = Heffner | first = Linda | title = The reproductive system at a glance | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, West Sussex, UK Hoboken, NJ | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1405194525|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_2yd2b8ybNoC & dq=fimbria+fallopian+tube & pg=PA28 }} < /ref >
