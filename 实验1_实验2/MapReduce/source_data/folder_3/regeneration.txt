 '''Regeneration''' means that an organism regrows a lost part, so that the original [[function]] is restored. It is a term in [[ developmental biology]]. 
 
 The ability to regenerate differs in different groups. Whereas [[newt]]s, for example, can regenerate severed limbs, [[mammal]]s cannot. Limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps, first de-[[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of adult cells into a [[stem cell]] state similar to embryonic cells and second, [[developmental biology|development]] of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time. < ref name= " odelberg " > Odelberg SJ.Unraveling the molecular basis for regenerative cellular plasticity.PLoS Biol. 2004 Aug;2(8):E232. PMID 15314652 < /ref >   
 
 Simpler animals like [[flatworm]]s can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies. These can migrate to damaged parts of the body, then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue.
