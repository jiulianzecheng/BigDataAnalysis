 '''Cuttlefish''' are [[Ocean|marine]] [[Cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s. They belong to the same [[class (biology)|class]] as [[squid]], [[octopus|octopodes]] and the [[nautilus]]. 
 
 Cuttlefish have an internal [[Animal shell|shell]] (called a [[cuttlebone]]), large [[eye]]s, and eight arms and two [[tentacle]]s furnished with finely toothed suckers, with which they grab their [[prey]]. 
 
 Cuttlefish eat small [[mollusc]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]], [[fish]] and other cuttlefish. Various [[shark]]s and fish prey on them. They live about 1 to 2 years. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 === Cuttlebone === 
 Cuttlefish have an [[internal]] [[cuttlebone]], made of [[calcium carbonate]]. It is porous, full of small holes, The [[buoyancy]] of the cuttlebone can change, allowing the cuttlefish to go lower or higher by changing the amount of [[gas]] and [[liquid]] in its chambers. The cuttlebone of each [[species]] has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. Cuttlebones are used by [[jeweller]]s and [[silversmith]]s as moulds for [[casting]] small objects. They are probably better known today as the material given to pet birds as a source of [[calcium]]. The cuttlebone is only found in cuttlefish, and is one of the features that makes them different from [[squid]] and other [[mollusc]]s. 
 
 === Changing color === 
 Cuttlefish are sometimes called the [[chameleon]] of the sea because they are able to change their skin color. Their skin can flash a colorful pattern in order to [[communicate]] with other cuttlefish and to [[camouflage]] them from [[predator]]s. This color-changing function is produced by groups of red, yellow, brown, and black [[pigment]]ed [[chromatophore]]s above a layer of reflective iridophores and leucophores. These are all in the cuttlefish's skin, and work together to change its colour. < ref > {{cite magazine |title=The Cuttlefish’s Camouflage Ability |magazine=Awake! |issn=0005-237X |date=2016 |volume=97 |issue=1 |page=16 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/awake-no1-2016-february/cuttlefish-camouflage/ |accessdate=20 April 2020 |language=en}} < /ref >  There are up to 200 of these special [[pigment]] cells per square [[millimeter]]. 
 
 The pigmented chromatophores have a sac of pigment and a large [[membrane]] that is folded when retracted. There are 6-20 small [[muscle]] [[cells]] on the sides which can contract to squash the [[elastic]] sac into a disc against the skin. 
 
 Iridophores are plates of [[chitin]] or [[protein]], which can reflect light. They are responsible for the metallic blues, greens, golds, and silvers often seen on cuttlefish. All of these cells can be used in combinations. As well as being able to influence the colour of the light that reflects off their skin, cuttlefish can also affect the light's [[polarization]], which can be used to signal to other animals which sense polarization. 
 
 === Eyes === 
 Cuttlefish eyes are among the most developed in the animal kingdom. The way cephalopod eyes develop is fundamentally different from that of [[vertebrate]]s like humans, but the way they work is rather similar. < ref > Miller 2003. [http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2003/Muller/development%20of%20the%20cephalopod%20eye.htm] < /ref >  The similarity between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes is an examples of [[convergent evolution]]. Although they cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which improves their ability to see contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina (known as [[fovea]]), one to look more forward, and one to look more backwards. The lenses, instead of being reshaped as they are in humans, are instead pulled around by reshaping the entire eye in order to change focus.

 === Blood === 
 The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue because it uses the [[copper]]-containing protein [[haemocyanin]] to carry [[oxygen]] instead of the red [[iron]]-containing protein [[haemoglobin]] that is found in [[vertebrates]]. This is similar to the blood of [[arthropod]]s. Haemocyanin is not as good at carrying oxygen as haemoglobin. The blood is pumped by three separate '[[heart]]s'. Two of these are used for pumping blood to the cuttlefish's pair of [[gill]]s (one heart for each gill), and the third for pumping blood around the rest of the body. 
 
 == Human interest == 
 === Ink === 
 Cuttlefish have [[ink]]s like [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es. As with squid, the ink is a defensive tool, squirted out to cover its retreat in the case of danger. This ink was formerly an important [[dye]], called [[sepia tone|sepia]]. Today artificial (not natural) dyes have replaced natural sepia. 
 
 === Cuttlefish as food === 
 Cuttlefish are caught for food in [[Mediterranean]], and [[East Asia]]n cultures. Although squid is more popular as a restaurant dish all over the world, in East Asia dried cuttlefish is highly popular. 
 
 Cuttlefish is popular in [[Italy]] and [[Croatia]], where it is used in ''[[Risotto]] Nero''.  " Nero "  means 'black', which is the colour the rice turns because of the cuttlefish ink. Spanish cuisine often uses cuttlefish and squid ink for cooking due to the [[ocean|marine]] flavor and smoothness that it provides to the meals and it is included in dishes such as rice, pasta and fish stews. 
 
 === Cuttlefish in literature === 
 Cuttlefish made their most important literary appearance in the title of [[Eugenio Montale]]'s collection of poetry called '''Cuttlefish Bones''' (''Ossi di seppia''), published in [[Turin]] in 1925. Montale was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1975.
