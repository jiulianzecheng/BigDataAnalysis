 '''Theophrastus''' ({{lang-el|Θεόφραστος}}; c. 371 – c. 287 BC), a Greek native of Eresos in [[Lesbos]], was the successor to [[Aristotle]] in the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] school. 
 
 He came to [[Athens]] at a young age and studied in [[Plato]]'s school. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle. Aristotle left his writings to Theophrastus, and named Theophrastus the new leader of the [[Lyceum]]. 
 
 Theophrastus led the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school was very successful. He is often considered the  " father of [[botany]] "  for his works on [[plant]]s. After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was [[Strato of Lampsacus]].
