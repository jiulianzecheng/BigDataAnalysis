 '''''Populus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[tree]]s common in the [[northern hemisphere]]. They are often called just '''poplars'''. The genus has 25–35 [[species]] in three sub-groups, which are called '''poplars''', '''[[aspen]]s''', and '''[[cottonwood]]s'''. 
 
 In the September 2006 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', it was announced that the Western Balsam Poplar (''[[Populus trichocarpa|P. trichocarpa]]'') was the first tree to have its full [[DNA]] code [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]]. < ref > Joint Genome Institute: [http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1_1/Poptr1_1.home.html ''Populus trichocarpa''] < /ref > 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 The [[flower]]s are mostly [[dioecious]] (rarely [[monoecious]]) and appear in early spring before the leaves. They are borne in long, drooping [[catkin]]s. The male flowers have a group of 4–60 [[stamen]]s on a disk. The female flower is a single-celled [[ovary]] in a cup-shaped disk. 
 
 [[Pollination]] is by wind. The [[fruit]] is a two to four-valved [[capsule]], green to reddish-brown, mature in mid summer. It contains tiny light brown [[seed]]s surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which help wind dispersal. < ref name=rdm > Meikle R.D. 1984.

 ==Ecology== 
 Poplars of the cottonwood section are often [[wetland]]s or [[riparian]] trees. < ref > Riparian: along river margins and banks. < /ref >  The aspens are among the most important [[Taiga|boreal]] broadleaf trees. < ref name=rdm/ > 
 
 Poplars and aspens are important food plants for the [[larva]]e of a large number of [[Lepidoptera]] species.  ''[[Pleurotus populinus]]'', the aspen oyster [[mushroom]], is found exclusively on dead wood of ''Populus'' trees in North America.
