 == Location == 
 Apia ({{coord|13|50|S|171|50|W}}) is on a natural dock at the mouth of the [[Vaisigano River]]. It is on a narrow coastal plain with [[Mount Vaea]] (height 472 m) directly to its south. Two main ridges run south on either side of the Vaisigano River, with roads on each sides. The more western of these is Cross Island Road, the fewer roads crossing to the south coast of Upolu.

 [[Mulinu'u]], the old capital, is the location of the [[Parliament]] House (''Fale Fono'') and the historic observatory, which is now the [[meteorology]] office. In [[1983]], the [[Apia Samoa Temple]] was built here by the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].
