A '''cabal''' is a group of people who try to [[control]] things in a [[secret]] way. Cabals are often an important part of a [[conspiracy theory]]. 
 
 Sometimes people say  " There Is No Cabal " , or use the [[abbreviation]] TINC to mean  " There Is No Cabal " . The joke is that since a cabal is necessarily secret, only those who are in the cabal can know.

 The former chief of staff, Lawrence Wilkerson, of the [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] said that the foreign policy of [[George W. Bush]]'s administration were run by a  " Cheney-[[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] cabal " . With this word he meant that the [[President]] had not really the power that he is given by the [[constitution]] and that the Vice President and the [[Secretary of Defense]] had more influence than they should have.  < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/21/politics/21wilkerson.html|title=Former Powell Aide Says Bush Policy Is Run by 'Cabal'|last=Knowlton|first=Brian|date=2005-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}} < /ref >
