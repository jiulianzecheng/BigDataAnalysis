 The '''plesiosaurs''' were an [[Order (biology)|order]] of large, [[carnivorous]] [[Ocean|marine]] [[reptile]]s. They flourished from 203 [[million]] years ago (mya) to 66 mya. 
 
 In 1719, [[William Stukeley]] described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it. < ref > Stukeley W. 1719. An account of the impression of the almost entire sceleton of a large animal in a very hard stone, lately presented the Royal Society, from Nottinghamshire. ''Philosophical Transactions'', '''30''': 963-968. < /ref > 
 
 [[Mary Anning]] was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the '[[Jurassic Coast]]' of [[Dorset]], England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its [[skull]], but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare.  
 
 The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle [[Triassic]] period. < ref > Benton M.J. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Quarto N.Y. < /ref > < sup > p128 < /sup >  The group was important through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]. They had two large pairs of [[paddle]]s, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the [[K/T extinction event]], 65 million years ago. < ref > Carroll R.L. 1988.

 == Description == 
 Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers, making them [[wikt:flexible|flexible]]. No modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy: modern [[turtle]]s use their forelimbs for swimming. Plesiosaurs  were mainly piscivorous (fish-eaters). 
 
 === Pliosaurs === 
 The [[pliosaur]]s were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their [[streamline]]d body shape suggests they swam and ate under water.  
 * ''[[Liopleurodon]]''. 
 
 === Long-necked plesiosaurs ===

 There were three families of long-necked plesiosaurs, < ref > Other classifications are possible: O'Keefe F.R. 2001. A cladistic analysis and taxonomic revision of the Plesiosauria (Reptilia: Sauropterygia); ''Acta Zool. Fennica'' '''213''': 1-63. < /ref >  who evidently had a different life-style from the pliosaurs. It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on [[plankton]]. < ref > Watson D.M.S. 1951. ''Palaeontology and modern biology''. Yale, CT. < /ref > < ref > Watson D.M.S. 1958. ''Studies on fossil vertebrates''. London. < /ref > < ref > Alexander, R. McNeill 1989. ''Dynamics of dinosaurs and other extinct giants''. Columbia N.Y. p137 < /ref >  It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water; [[aquatic]] [[mammal]]s operating under water all have a streamlined [[torpedo]]-shape, as did pliosaurs and [[ichthyosaur]]s. All the longer-necked familiers were, from the setting of the [[teeth]] and [[jaw]]s, eaters of small fish. However, some at least were bottom-feeders, consuming various prey. Digestion of shellfish was aided by [[gastrolith]]s. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4341204.stm BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Plesiosaur bottom-feeding shown < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > 
 
 * Plesiosaurids: neck not so long as the other two families, and not so flexible: a more general all-round plesiosaur. Head of medium size, neck fairly thick and strong, up to 30 vertebrae. 
 ** ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' 
 
 * Cryptoclidids: longer necks, with more than 30 vertebrae.  
 ** ''[[Cryptoclidus]]'' 
 
 * Elasmosaurids: very long necks; some later forms have as many as 76 cervical (neck) vertebrae and quite small [[skull]]s. < ref > Benton M.J. 2004. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. 3rd ed, Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p30 < /sup >  Watson and Alexander's ideas apply especially to this group.

 ==== Gastroliths ==== 
 [[File:Gastroliths.jpg|thumb|Plesiosaur gastroliths]]  
 Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of [[belemnite]]s ([[squid]]-like animals), and [[ammonite]]s (giant [[nautilus]]-like [[mollusc]]s) associated with their stomachs. But plesiosaurs could not crack shells. Instead, they probably swallowed them whole. In the belly of a plesiosaur were  " stomach stones " , which are called ''gastroliths.'' These stones moved around in the plesiosaur's stomach and cracked or [[wikt:crush|crushed]] the [[Animal shell|shell]]s of the [[animal]]s it ate. One plesiosaur fossil found in [[South Dakota]] had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds. < ref > Everhart, M.J. 2005.

Sci. Trans.'' 103(1-2):58-69] < /ref > 
 
 == Live birth? == 
 Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs, but is uncertain for plesiosaurs.
