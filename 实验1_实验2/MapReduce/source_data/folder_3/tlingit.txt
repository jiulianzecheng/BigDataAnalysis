The '''Tlingit''' are a [[Native American]] group from the [[Pacific Northwest]]. They live in the [[United States]] (in the state of [[Alaska]]) and in [[Canada]] ([[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]]). They speak the [[Tlingit language]]. In their language, Tlingit means  " people of the tides. " 
 
 The Tlingit get their food through hunting, gathering, and fishing. They are a matrilineal society. That means property is passed down from a mother to her children. 
 
 The Tlingit practiced slavery extensively until it was outlawed by the United States. < ref > {{Cite web|title=NEWS_Blog_Slavery_QA {{!}} Sealaska Heritage|url=https://www.sealaskaheritage.org/node/553|access-date=2022-04-06|website=www.sealaskaheritage.org}} < /ref >
