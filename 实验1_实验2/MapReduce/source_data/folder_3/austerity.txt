'''Austerity measures''' ([[Political economy|political-economics]]) are government actions that try to reduce government budget deficits. They do this by spending less, increasing tax, both, or some other clever ways. < ref name= " ft_lexicon " > {{Cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=austerity-measure|title=Austerity measure|website=[[Financial Times]] Lexicon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322221836/http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=austerity-measure|archive-date=22 March 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=1 March 2013}} < /ref > < ref name= " Traynor " > {{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jun/11/europe-deficit-crisis-austerity-budgets|title=Austerity Europe: who faces the cuts|last=Traynor|first=Ian|date=11 June 2010|access-date=29 September 2010|publisher=Guardian News|last2=Katie Allen|location=London}} < /ref > < ref name= " Wesbury " > {{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/government-spending-taxes-opinions-columnists-brian-wesbury-robert-stein.html|title=Government Austerity: The Good, Bad And Ugly|last=Wesbury|first=Brian S.|date=26 July 2010|work=Forbes|access-date=29 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929125657/http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/26/government-spending-taxes-opinions-columnists-brian-wesbury-robert-stein.html|archive-date=29 September 2010|url-status=live|last2=Robert Stein}} < /ref > 
 
 Austerity measures are used by governments that find it difficult to pay their debts. The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenue closer to spending. 
 
 In most [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] models, austerity policies generally increase unemployment as government spending falls. < ref name= " Austerity – Pros and Cons " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/5366/economics/austerity-pros-and-cons/|title=Austerity – Pros and Cons|publisher=Economics Help}} < /ref > < ref name= " What is austerity? " > {{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/buttonwoods-notebook/2015/05/20/what-is-austerity|title=What is austerity?|publisher=The Economist}} < /ref >  Decreased government spending reduces public and maybe private employment. Also, tax increases can reduce consumption by cutting household [[disposable income]]. Some say that reducing spending may result in a higher debt-to-GDP ratio because government expenditure itself is a part of GDP. 
 
 For example, after the [[Great Recession]], austerity measures in many European countries were followed by increasing unemployment and debt-to-GDP ratios despite smaller budget deficits. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/austerity-aftermath-great-recession|title=Austerity in the aftermath of the Great Recession|last=House|first=Christopher|last2=Proebsting|first2=Christian|date=2017-04-11|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2019-07-18|last3=Tesar|first3=Linda}} < /ref >  When an economy is operating at or near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise. This results in a reduction in private investment. This then reduces economic growth. Where there is excess capacity, the stimulus can result in an increase in employment and output. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/opinion/krugman-europes-economic-suicide.html|title=Europe's Economic Suicide|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=15 April 2012|work=The New York Times}} < /ref > < ref name= " Tyson1 " > {{Cite news|url=http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/confusion-about-the-deficit/|title=Confusion about the Deficit|last=Laura D'Andrea Tyson|date=1 June 2012|access-date=16 May 2013|publisher=New York Times}} < /ref >
