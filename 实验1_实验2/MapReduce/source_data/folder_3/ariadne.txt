'''Ariadne''', in [[Greek mythology]], was daughter of [[Minos of Crete|King Minos]] of [[Crete]] and his queen, [[PasiphaÃ«]], daughter of [[Helios]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Sun-titan]].  She helped [[Theseus]] in defeating the [[Minotaur]] (by giving him a length of string to escape the labyrinth). But Theseus abandoned her so she became the [[consort]] of the [[god]] [[Dionysus]]. She is the Greek goddess of passion and mazes.
