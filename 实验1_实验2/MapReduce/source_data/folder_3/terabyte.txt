A '''terabyte''' ('''TB''') is a [[unit of measurement]] in [[computer]]s and similar [[electronic]] [[device]]s. One terabyte holds 1000 [[gigabyte]]s ('''GB''') or a trillion (1,000,000,000,000) [[byte]]s, and 1000 terabytes make one [[petabyte]].   
 
 Large organizations use terabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data. People at home might use terabytes for backups.  An external [[hard drive]] can be several terabytes.
