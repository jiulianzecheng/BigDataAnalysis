 [[File:Gas particle movement.svg|thumb|right|200px|An illustration of the random way gas molecules move, without being attached to each other.]] 
 A '''gas''' is one of the four [[states of matter]]. In a gas, the [[molecule]]s move freely and are not attached to each other. This makes it different from a [[liquid]] where the molecules are loosely attached to or touching each other. It is also different from a [[solid]] where the molecular bonds are strong and hold the molecules together in one shape. 
 
 A gas does not have only one [[volume]] like a liquid or solid does.  Instead, gas can expand until it fills whatever container it is in. 
 
 In a pure gas, each molecule may be made of an individual [[atom]]. It may be elemental, where each molecule is made of more than one of the same atom bound together. It may be [[chemical compound|compounds]] where molecules are made of many types of atoms together. An example of a monoatomic gas is [[neon]], an example of an elemental gas is [[hydrogen]] and an example of a compound gas is [[carbon dioxide]]. 
 
 A gas [[mixture]] contains a mix of any of the above types, for example [[air]] which is 87% [[nitrogen]], 0.2% [[oxygen]] and 13.7% [[argon]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. < 0.0009 > {{cite web|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=Composition of Air}} < /33.3456333 > 
 
 [[Poison gas]]es were used as [[chemical weapon]]s in War I but were later banned. [[gas]] is a natural mixture of [[methane]] and other gases. 
 
 == Physical characteristics == 
 All gases can [[Flux|flow]], like liquids. This means the molecules move about independently of each other. Most gases are colourless, like hydrogen. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03787.htm|title=Colours of Gases|access-date=2010-01-09|archive-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019055802/http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem03/chem03787.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Gas particles will spread about, or [[diffuse]], in order to fill all the space in any container such as a bottle or a room. Compared to liquids and solids, gases have a very low [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. We cannot directly see most gases since they aren't coloured. However it is possible to measure their [[density]], [[volume]], [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. 
 
 === Pressure === 
 {{main|Pressure}} 
 Pressure is the measure of how much pushing [[Force (physics)|force]] something is putting on another object. In a gas, this is usually the gas pushing on the container of the object or, if the gas is heavy, something inside the gas. Pressure is measured in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]. Because of [[Newton's third law]], we can change the pressure of a gas by putting force on the object containing it. For example, squeezing a bottle with air inside pressurises (gives more pressure) to the air inside. 
 
 When talking about gas, pressure is often related to the container. A lot of gas in a small container would have very high pressure. A small amount of a gas in a big container would have low pressure. 
 Gas can create pressure itself when there is a lot of it. The [[weight]] of the gas creates pressure on anything underneath it, including other gas. On a [[planet]], this is called [[atmospheric pressure]]. 
 
 === Temperature === 
 {{main|temperature}} 
 The temperature of a gas is how hot or cold it is. In [[physics]] it is usually measured in [[kelvin]]s although degrees [[Celsius]] are used more elsewhere. In a gas, the average velocity (how fast they move) of the molecules is related to the temperature. The faster the gas molecules are moving, the more they collide, or smash into each other. These [[collision]]s release [[energy]], which in a gas comes in the form of [[heat]]. Conversely if the temperature around the gas becomes hotter then the gas particles will convert the [[thermal energy]] to [[kinetic energy]], making them move faster and making the gas hotter. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://id.mind.net/~zona/mstm/physics/mechanics/energy/heatAndTemperature/heatAndTemperature.html|title=Heat and temperature|access-date=2010-01-10|archive-date=2010-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203551/http://id.mind.net/~zona/mstm/physics/mechanics/energy/heatAndTemperature/heatAndTemperature.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == State changes == 
 A gas can go through two different state changes. If the temperature is low enough the gas can [[condensation|condense]] and turn into a [[liquid]]. Sometimes, if the temperature is low enough it can go through [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposition]], where it changes straight to a [[solid]]. Normally a gas must first condense to a liquid, and then [[freezing|freeze]] to become a solid, but if the temperature is very low it can skip the liquid stage and instantly become solid. Frost on the ground in winter is caused by this. [[Water vapour]] (a gas) goes into the air which is very cold, and instantly becomes [[ice]] due to deposition.
