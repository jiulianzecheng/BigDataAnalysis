 '''Medina''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|d|iː|n|ə}}; {{lang-ar|المدينة المنورة}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Madīnah al-Munawwarah}}'' ,  " the radiant city " ; or {{lang|ar|المدينة}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Madīnah}}'' ({{IPA-acw|almaˈdiːna}}),  " the city " ), also transliterated as '''Madīnah''', is a city in the [[Hejaz]], and the capital of the Al Madinah Region of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The city contains [[al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] ( " the Prophet's Mosque " ), which is the burial place of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], and is the second-holiest city in [[Islam]] after [[Mecca]]. 
 
 Medina was Muhammad's destination after his [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijrah]] from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, first under Muhammad's leadership, and then under the first four Rashidun caliphs, [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]]. It served as the power base of Islam in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. Medina is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the [[Quba Mosque]], al-Masjid an-Nabawi, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.hajinformation.com/main/h2022.htm |title=Masjid Quba' – Hajj |location=Saudi Arabia |publisher=Hajinformation.com |accessdate=26 March 2013}} < /ref >  and [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] ( " the mosque of the two [[qibla]]s " ). Muslims believe that the chronologically final [[sura]]hs of the [[Quran]] were revealed to Muhammad in Medina, and are called [[Medinan sura]]hs in contrast to the earlier [[Meccan sura]]hs. < ref > {{cite book| last = Khan| first = A.M.| title = Historical Value Of The Qur An And The Hadith| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcMHD5WWL7AC & pg=PA26| year = 2003| publisher = Global Vision Publishing House| isbn = 978-81-87746-47-8| page = 26 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = Al-Laithy| first = Ahmed| title = What Everyone Should Know about the Qurʼan| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5ShMqiiJbNYC & pg=PA61| year = 2005| publisher = Garant| isbn = 978-90-441-1774-5| page = 61 }} < /ref >

 == Overview == 
 Medina currently has a population of  more than 1,300,000 people (2006). The city was originally known as ''Yathrib'', but later its name was changed to Madīnat al-Nabī (مدينة ﺍﻟﻨﺒﻲ {{IPA-all|mæˈdiːnæt æˈnːæbiː}}  " city of the prophet " ) or ''Al Madīnah al Munawwarah'' ( " the enlightened city "  or  " the radiant city " ). The short form ''Madīnah'' simply means  " city " . Madina is the second holiest city of [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]] (Makkah). < ref > However, an article in [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200606/Saudi Aramco World]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by John Anthony states:  " To the perhaps parochial Muslims of North Africa in fact the sanctity of Kairouan is second only to Mecca among all cities of the world. " 
 Saudi Aramco’s bimonthly magazine's goal is to broaden knowledge of the cultures, history and geography of the Arab and Muslim worlds and their connections with the West; pages 30-36 of the January/February 1967 print edition [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196701/the.fourth.holy.city.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624130307/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196701/the.fourth.holy.city.htm |date=2004-06-24 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Medina's religious significance in Islam == 
 [[File:Green Dome, Masjid Al Nabawi.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome at the Prophet's mosque in Medina]] 
 Medina is the second holiest site in Islam after [[Mecca]] that's why Medina is very important to [[Muslim]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Abdullah|first=|date=6 July 2016|title=The Prophet's Mosque: An insight into Islam’s second-holiest site|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/features/2016/07/06/The-Prophet-s-Mosque-An-insight-into-Islam-s-second-holiest-site|website=al arabiya}} < /ref >  This is because Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as '[[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|Masjid-e-Nabawi]]' or 'The Mosque of The Prophet' located in Medina. The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammad's home. Muslims believe {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die. Accordingly, Muhammad was buried in his house. The [[tomb]] later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]]. The first mosque of Islam is also in Medina. It is known as ''Masjid Quba,'' (the [[Quba Mosque]]). 
 
 Like Mecca, the city of Medina only permits [[Muslim]]s to enter. The ''haram'' (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, though. Many facilities on the [[wikt:outskirts|outskirts]] of Medina are open to non-Muslims. In Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the 'Tomb of Prophet' and to [[worship]] at mosques in a unified celebration. Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Abdul|first=Latef|date=25 April 2013|title=The rewards of praying at the 3 Sacred Mosque|url=https://abdullatef.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/earn-great-reward-the-virtue-of-praying-at-the-three-sacred-mosques/|access-date=16 October 2023|website=Word Press|language=AR}} < /ref >
