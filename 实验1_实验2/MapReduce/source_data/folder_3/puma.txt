 '''Pumas''' (''Puma concolor''), also called '''cougars''', '''mountain lions''', '''catamounts''', or '''brown panthers''', are large [[Felidae|wild cats]] that live in the western half of [[North America]], along with [[Florida]], and most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].  
 
 Pumas are mainly tan-color, and can be up to 9 feet long, although average length is 6 – 8 feet. They can weigh from 29 [[kilogram]]s to 90 kilograms.  (The [[male]]s are larger.)  Most pumas live up to 21 years.{{Fact|date=February 2012}} Although pumas are very large and some are larger than humans, the puma is classified as a small cat. That means that, in scientific terms, the puma is more closely related to the domestic cat than they are to [[lion]]s. Unlike the big cats in the genus ''[[Panthera]]'', the puma cannot roar. Instead, it can growl, hiss, screech, and purr. Since pumas are, in the biological sense, small cats, they are capable of purring continuously. The big cats can only purr while breathing out.  
 
 Pumas are [[carnivores]] because they eat only meat. Pumas are [[apex predator]]s. They prey on [[deer]], [[elk]], [[raccoon]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s, and [[skunk]]s.  They can also prey on [[Mouse|mice]], [[beaver]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[Bobcat|bobcats]], [[bird]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[fish]], and [[bear]] cubs. They will sometimes prey on livestock such as [[cattle]], [[Domestic goat|goats]], [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], and [[Pig|pigs]]. They hunt at night. Cougars can see better at night than people can.  They can hear well too.  Pumas stalk their prey, which means they walk slowly and quietly, they hide and then when close, they jump or run fast to catch their prey by surprise.  They live and hunt alone. Female cougars take care of their babies until they are old enough to take care for themselves. Baby cougars are called cubs or kittens. 
 
 Pumas live in the mountains and forests far from people. However, encounters with humans happen sometimes. 26 people have been killed by cougars in North America in the last 30 years. However, many more cougars have been killed by humans. Cougars used to be found all in eastern North America, but they were hunted to extinction there by the beginning of the 1900s. Also, recent sightings of cougars have been reported from [[Michigan]], [[New Brunswick]], southern [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont]]. For now, the only confirmed, population of cougars east of the [[Mississippi River]] is in [[Florida]], where a subspecies of the cougar lives.
