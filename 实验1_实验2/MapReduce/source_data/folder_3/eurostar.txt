All Eurostar trains cross the [[English Channel]] through the [[Channel Tunnel]]. 
 
 The service is operated by 18-carriage [[British Rail Class 373|Class 373 trains]] at up to 300 & nbsp;km/h (186 [[miles per hour|mph]]) on a network of [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] lines. Since Eurostar began in 1994, new lines have been built in [[Belgium]] ([[HSL 1]]) and Southern [[England]] ([[High Speed 1]]) to the same standard as the [[LGV Nord]] line originally used in France, reducing journey times. The two-stage Channel Tunnel Rail Link < !--CTRL was the name of the project-- >  project was completed on 14 November [[2007]], when the London terminus of Eurostar transferred from [[Waterloo International railway station|Waterloo International]] to [[St Pancras station|St Pancras International station]].
