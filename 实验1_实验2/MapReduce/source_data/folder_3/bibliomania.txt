'''Bibliomania''' can be a [[symptom]] of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], by [[collection|collecting]] of [[book]]s to the point where social relations or health are in danger. It can be connected to stealing ([[kleptomania]]) of books. 
 
 Bibliomania is not to be confused with [[bibliophilia]], which is the usual love of books. 
 
 [[Don Quixote]] may be the most famous bibliomaniac in [[fiction]].
