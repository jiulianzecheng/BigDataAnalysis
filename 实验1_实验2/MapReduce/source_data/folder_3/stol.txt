 '''STOL''' refers to short take-off and landing aircraft. They only need a short runway for takeoff and landing. This type of aircraft is made to use short runways for take off and landing in high altitudes, hilly regions, and remote areas.  < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/n251 242]}} < /ref > 
 
 An STOL aircraft has a large wing for its weight. These wings often use [[aerodynamic]] devices like flaps, slots, slats, and vortex generators. < ref name= " gtri.gatech.edu " > {{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/powered-lift|title=Powered Lift: Novel GTRI design would let commercial jets use smaller airports while reducing noise |publisher=Georgia Tech Research Institute|access-date=2010-10-28}} < /ref >  Typically, an STOL aircraft has lower maximum speed, but good payload lifting. The payload is critical, because many small, isolated communities rely on STOL aircraft for their transport link to the outside world. < ref name= " gtri.gatech.edu " / >
