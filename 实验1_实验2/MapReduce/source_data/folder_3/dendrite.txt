[[File:Anatomy of neuron.png|thumb|500px|The neuron contains dendrites that receives information, a cell body called the soma, and an axon that sends information. Schwann cells make activity move faster down axon. Synapses allow neurons to activate other neurons. The dendrites receive a signal, the axon hillock funnels the signal to the initial segment and the initial segment triggers the activity (action potential) that is sent along the axon towards the synapse.

 '''Dendrites''' are the branches of [[neuron]]s that receive signals from other neurons. The signals go into the cell body (or [[soma]]). 
 
 A cell may have hundreds of dendrites, but may have only one [[axon]]. The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, and the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a [[muscle fiber]]. < ref > {{cite web  |first = Eric H. |last = Chudler | name-list-style = vanc |title = Brain Facts and Figures |url = http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html |work = Neuroscience for Kids |access-date = 2009-06-20 }} < /ref > 
 
 A dendrite from one neuron and an [[axon]] from another neuron meet at a [[synapse]], which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon, they trigger the release of chemicals called [[neurotransmitters]]. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of [[ions]] into or out of the cell. 
 
 The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal. 
 
 If the dendrites get lots of signals from axons, then it sets off a chain reaction. The chain reaction is a strong electrical current called an [[action potential]] that flows down the axon to the next synapse. 
 
 Fully differentiated neurons do not divide. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Herrup K, Yang Y | title = Cell cycle regulation in the postmitotic neuron: oxymoron or new biology? | journal = Nature Reviews.
