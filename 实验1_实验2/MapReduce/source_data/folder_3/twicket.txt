 == Background == 
 
 John Popham is a [[consultant]]. He decided to show Twicket online after seeing two comments on Twitter. < ref name= " Twicket-official "  / >  In the first comment, Dan Slee said he wanted to see news about his a local village cricket team on Twitter. < ref name= " Twicket-official "  / > 
 
 Then, Chris Conder mentioned that she was testing a new 30[[Data rate units#Megabit per second|Mbps]], [[Symmetric digital subscriber line|symmetrical internet]] connection.  " Symmetrical internet "  means that the upload speed is as fast as the download speed. Conder lives in a village called [[Wray, Lancashire|Wray]]. Wray is in Lancashire, England. < ref name= " Twicket-official "  / >  The connection was installed in Wray by [[Lancaster University]] < ref name= " LivingLab " > {{cite web|url=http://www.infolab21.co.uk/livinglab/|title=RuralConnect Living Labs|accessdate=17 April 2011}} < /ref >  Wray is one of only three villages in the UK to have a symmetrical [[community network]]. < ref name= " Hartley-2 "  / > 
 
 Conder told Popham that a special cricket match was going to be played in Wray. The match was part of the village’s Scarecrow Festival. < ref name= " Twicket-official "  / >  The Scarecrow Festival happens every year. The match was between Wray and a team called  " The Rest of the World " . < ref name= " Scarecrow " > {{cite web|url=http://www.wrayvillage.co.uk/scarecrows.htm|title=Wray scarecrow village UK information page|accessdate=17 April 2011|archive-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430090256/http://www.wrayvillage.co.uk/scarecrows.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Popham said: 
 
 < blockquote > I'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed ... It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it {{Allcaps|is}} possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast {{Allcaps|upload}} connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content. < ref name= " Hartley-1 "  / > < /blockquote > 
 
 ==The match== 
 The match was 20 [[Over (cricket)|overs]] per side. This is called the [[Twenty20]] format. There was an extra rule that said that any batsman who scored 20 runs had to retire. Wray won the toss. < ref name= " Twicket-video " > {{cite web|url=http://www.twicket.info|title=Twicket (video stream archive)|date=2011-04-25|accessdate=25 April 2011|archive-date=2011-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428062314/http://twicket.info/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They decided to bowl first. < ref name= " Twicket-video "  / >  After 20 overs, The Rest of the World had scored 69 runs and lost 5 wickets. < ref name= " Twicket-video "  / >  That meant that Wray needed 70 runs off 20 overs. Wray managed to do that. Their final runs were a six. Wray won in their eleventh over. < ref name= " Twicket-video "  / >  They won by 8 wickets. < ref name= " Twicket-video "  / >
