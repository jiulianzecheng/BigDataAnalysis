'''Connemara''' ({{lang-ga|'''Conamara'''}}) is a district in the west of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The Owenglin River flows into the sea at An Cloch√°n/Clifden.  At first, Connemara was divided into North and South Connemara. The mountains of the Twelve Bens and the Owenglin River were the natural boundaries between the two parts. 
 
 Actor [[Peter O'Toole]] was born here in 1932.
