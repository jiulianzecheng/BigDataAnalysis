 The '''oesophagus''' (or '''esophagus''') is also called the '''gullet'''. It is the part of the [[gastrointestinal system]] between the mouth and the [[stomach]]. It connects the [[pharynx]] and the stomach. It is about {{convert|25|cm}} long. 
 
 The oesophagus is lined with [[muscle]], and is [[lubrication|lubricated]]. Its muscle pushes food down into the stomach. The oesophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food. The muscular movement that pushes the food down the oesophagus is called [[peristalsis]]. At the entrance to the stomach there is a ring of muscle called a sphincter. This is usually closed, but relaxes as food approaches, allowing it to enter the stomach. In the stomach, the food is churned until it turns into a soupy mixture called [[chyme]].
