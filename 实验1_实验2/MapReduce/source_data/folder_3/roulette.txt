 '''Roulette''' is a [[casino]] game named after a [[French language|French]] [[diminutive]] for ''little wheel''. In the game, players may choose to place bets on fields which include one or more numbers, < ref > [http://youroul.com/en Roulette Strategy Simulation] by [[youroul.com]] < /ref >  the colors red or black, or whether the number is odd or even. 
 
 To determine the winning number and color, the game wheel is spun in one direction, then a ball is spun in the opposite direction around a track running around the wheel. The ball eventually slows down and falls on to the wheel and into one of 37 (in French/European roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) colored and numbered pockets on the wheel. < ref > [http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ExpectationsForRoulette/ Expectations for Roulette] by Michael Schreiber, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]], demonstrations.wolfram.com < /ref > 
 
 == Variants of games== 
 * French roulette is available at the top rated casino roulettes. 
 * Mini roulette is becoming popular at [[Casino|casinos]]. The wheel only has 12 figures rather from the standard 36. 
 * Probably the most performed form of roulette is European roulette. The game has only just one zero, It has the biggest payout of any form of roulette should you bet and land on one number: 35:1. 
 * American roulette. The game is broadly offered at all online roulette games but it is the version using the greatest house edge, mainly due to the double zero. For those who have an option, especially if you're not a higher roller or really are a novice would be to avoid American roulette before you feel at ease with the sport.
