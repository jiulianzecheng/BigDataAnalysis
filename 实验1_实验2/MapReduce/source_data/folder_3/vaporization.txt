 '''Vaporization''' is a [[phase change]] from [[liquid]] to [[vapor]]. There are two types of vaporization: [[evaporation]] and [[boiling]]. 
 
 Evaporation is a phase change from liquid to vapour. Evaporation happens below the [[boiling point]] of a substance at a given [[pressure]]. Evaporation happens on a surface. 
 
 Boiling is also a phase change from liquid to [[gas]]. Boiling takes place when the [[vapor pressure]] of the [[substance]] is greater than or equal to the pressure of its environment. The temperature at which  a substance boils is called the boiling point.
