 '''Testosterone''' is an [[androgen]] [[sex]] [[hormone]]. A hormone is one that is made from [[cholesterol]]. A sex hormone is one that regulates sexual changes in the body. An androgen is the [[male]] type of sex hormone. 
 
 The [[testicles]] of men make lots of testosterone. [[Ovaries]] and [[adrenal gland]]s make testosterone too. But they make much less than the testicles do. So men have much higher testosterone levels than women. The process takes place during the ages of puberty for both males and females 
 
 Testosterone has two different kinds of effects. One effect is [[anabolic]]. This effect causes growth of muscle and bone. The other effect of testosterone is [[androgen]]ic. These effects make the body look male. This includes the effects that boys have at puberty: growing a beard, making the [[penis]] and [[testicles]] bigger, and making the voice deeper.
