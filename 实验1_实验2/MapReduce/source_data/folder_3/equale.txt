An '''equale''' is a [[Composition (music)|composition]] of music for several [[Musical instrument|instruments]] of the same type. Most of the time, they are short festive pieces. Most of them were written to be played at [[Funeral|funerals]], or at days where the dead are remembered, such as [[All Souls' Day]]. The instrument commonly used is the [[trombone]]. Among the best known are probably ''[[Drei Equale für vier Posaunen]]'' [[WoO]] 30, by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (composed 1812), and ''[[2 Aequale für 3 Posaunen]]'' by [[Anton Bruckner]], composed 1847.
