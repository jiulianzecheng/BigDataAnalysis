 '''Niobium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It is sometimes named '''columbium'''. It has the chemical symbol '''Nb'''. It has the [[atomic number]] 41. It is a [[wikt:rare|rare]] [[metal]]. Niobium is hard and grey. It is [[wikt:ductile|ductile]]. In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the [[transition metal]]s. Niobium was discovered in a variety of a [[mineral]] called columbite (now called [[niobite]]). Niobite is an [[ore]] of niobium. < ref > G.V. Samsonov {ed) 1968.

 Niobium is considered a ''technology-critical element''. It is used in [[alloy]]s, such as to make special [[steel]]s and strong [[Welding|welded joints]]. Less than 0.1% of Niobium significantly improves the strength of [[steel]]. < ref > Patel, Zh.  &  Khul'ka K. 2001. ''Niobium for steelmaking''. ''Metallurgist''. '''45''' (11–12): 477–480. < /ref >  It is in the [[superconduction|superconducting]] [[alloy]]s used in [[MRI]] scanners, which are one of the most important [[medical]] [[inventions]] of the modern age.
