A '''ventilator''' is a [[machine]] which artificially moves [[air]] in and out of the [[lungs]] of a [[patient]] in order to help them [[breathe]] if that patient cannot breathe on their own or breathe properly. Some ventilators can also be used in order give patients [[anesthesia]] and can be part of an [[anesthetic machine]]. 
 
 ==How do they work== 
 There are different types of ventilators which can work differently, but they all help pump air into and out of the lungs using [[pressure]]. 
 
 ===Manual resuscitators===

 Some types of ventilators require someone else to make them work by hand and help the patient breathe for a short period of time: they are called manual resuscitators. 
 
 Bag-valve masks (BMVs) have an oxygen mask which covers the [[nose]] and [[mouth]] of the patient, a one-way valve attached between the mask and the bag which filters the moving air and prevents the air to be breathed back into the bag, and an inflatable bag which holds the air in and is squeezed by [[hand]]. An operator squeezes the bag which forces air into the patient's lungs, and as the hand releases the bag is the patient breathes out into the outer environment and the bag refills itself with outside air. The bag is squeezed and released by hand repeatedly in order to keep the patient breathing. 
 
 Amnesia bags is another type of manual resuscitator in which the bag does not refill itself with air as the patient is breathing. Instead, the bag is filled with air or [[gas]] beforehand and the bag is either squeezed by hand or the patient can inhale the air or gas inside of bath if they can breathe on their own. 
 
 ===Mechanical ventilators=== 
 Mechanical ventilators work by themselves without manual operation and are usually controlled by [[computers]], and can be powered by either [[electricity]] connected to a [[wall outlet]] or [[battery]], or [[pneumatics]] without the use of electricity. The air can be moved in and out of the patient by attaching an oxygen mask on the patient or by connecting the ventilator to a breathing tube inserted into the [[nostril]]s, the [[larynx]] or the [[trachea]]. They are used to help the patient breathe for a long period of time.

 Positive pressure ventilators work by blowing air from the outside or from an [[oxygen tank]] or [[air tank]] through a pneumatic [[reservoir]] which holds and [[compressed air|compressing the air]], or through a [[turbine]] which turns around and forces the air through a mask or breathing tube and into the patient. As the air is forced into the lungs, the patient would later breathe out through a  " patient circuit "  with a one-way valve.

 On the other hand, a negative pressure ventilator, also known as an  " iron lung "  or a tank respirator, is a [[chamber]] which is enclosed around the patient's [[chest]] and lowers the pressure inside the chamber around the chest area to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is less than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe in, and then the pressure inside heightens to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is greater than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe out. This process occurs periodically. Negative pressure ventilators are now considered obsolete and instead positive pressure ventilators are used in its place.
