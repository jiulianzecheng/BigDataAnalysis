 The '''Navajo people''' (Navajo: Diné or Naabeehó) are a [[tribe]] of [[Native American]]s from the [[Indigenous peoples of the North American Southwest|southwestern part]] of the [[United States]]. The Navajo tribe has about 300,000 members.

 ==Language== 
 {{main|Navajo language}} 
 The Navajo language is called Diné.  It is a tonal language, meaning that a word may mean something different if said with a different pitch.  About 150,000 people speak Diné.  Diné is very difficult to learn because the speaker has to understand the relationships between different things. < ref name= " PBS " > {{cite web|publisher=PBS|access-date=July 15, 2020|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/missnavajo/language.html|title=Navajo Culture  >  Language|author=Billy Luther|archive-date=January 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200105093657/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/missnavajo/language.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Culture == 
 
 Much of the Navajo culture, religion and other beliefs say everything in the world is connected and everything has a spirit. < ref name= " Lewis "  / > 
 
 The Navajo culture involves many different ceremonies.  Some are short. The longest can take nine days.  There are ceremonies to make sick people well and solve other problems.  When a Navajo person becomes sick, he or she might go to a modern doctor or hospital, might pay a medicine man to sing a healing ceremony, or might do both. < ref name= " Lewis "  / >

 Many Navajo people are more comfortable with not talking than most Americans and would rather just touch hands than do a full [[handshake]].  In a Navajo conversation, it is all right to take a long time to answer a question and it is important not to interrupt the other person.  Some Navajo do not like to make [[eye contact]]. < ref name= " Ch14 " > {{cite book|url=http://freebooks.uvu.edu/NURS3400/index.php/ch10-navajo-culture.html|access-date=July 15, 2020|title=Transcultural Nursing|chapter=Chapter 14 - Navajo Culture|author1=Sean N. Bennett|author2=Cody Fitzwater}} < /ref > < ref name= " Nez "  / > 
 
 Navajo culture has [[clan]]s.  Sons and daughters are in the same clan their mother is in.  When meeting a new person, a Navajo will usually say their own clan and their father's clan.  Navajo culture does not allow people to marry other people from the same clan.  Navajo people usually think of anyone from the same clan as a brother, sister or cousin.  Originally, there were four Navajo clans, but there are more now. < ref name= " Lewis "  / > 
 
 The number four is in many parts of Navajo culture: Four seasons, four clans at first, four directions, and four holy mountains. < ref name= " Lewis " > {{cite web|url=https://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture.aspx|publisher=Navajo Tourism Department|author=Ray Baldwin Lewis|title=Navajo Culture|access-date=July 15, 2020|archive-date=July 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705215052/https://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Most Navajo wear modern American clothing most of the time but put on traditional clothes for special occasions.  For women, traditional clothes are a ''tl'aakal'' skirt with a long-sleeve ''deiji'éé''' shirt and shawl with moccasins.  For men, traditional clothes are a white pants and silver or turquoise ''dootl’izhii'' jewelry with a headband and shirt, and moccasins.  Both men and women tie their hair into a bun on the back of the head. < ref name= " Lewis "  / > 
 
 The Navajo Nation Fair is in Window Rock, Arizona every year in September.  It is the largest Native American fair in the United States.  It has a [[rodeo]], a [[parade]], Navajo music and dance contests and the [[Miss Navajo Nation]] [[beauty pageant]]. < ref name= " Lewis "  / >

 ==Livestock == 
 
 The Navajo got sheep and goats after the Spanish brought them to North America.  This might be why their culture changed from Apache culture.  They became very good at raising sheep and goats and making cloth from sheep's wool.  In Navajo culture, the official owner of the sheep was usually a woman and not a man. < ref name= " NatRoots " > {{cite web|publisher=Native American Roots|url=http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/1136|title=The Navajo, Sheep, and the Federal Government|date=November 10, 2011|access-date=July 14, 2020}} < /ref > < ref name= " Gendered " > {{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/whq/article-abstract/38/4/437/1905495?redirectedFrom=PDF|access-date=July 14, 2020|author=Marsha Weisiger|title=Gendered Injustice: Navajo Livestock Reduction in the New Deal Era |date=November 1, 2007|doi=10.2307/25443605|journal=Western Historical Quarterly|volume=38|issue=4|pages=437–455|jstor=25443605}} < /ref >   The Navajo also had horses and cows. < ref name= " Voice " > {{cite web|url=https://library.nau.edu/speccoll/exhibits/indigenous_voices/navajo/livestock.html|title=Navajo Livestock Reduction|publisher=Northern Arizona University|access-date=July 14, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 During the [[Great Depression]], the [[United States]] government saw that Navajo and Hopi land was [[overgrazing|overgrazed]] and decided to  " reduce "  the number of sheep and goats.  They did not ask the Navajo what they thought.  They took sheep and goats away from the Navajo.  Some of the animals were sold, but for less than half what they were worth. < ref name= " Nez " > {{cite book|author1=Chester Nez|author2=Judith Schiess Avila|title=Code Talker|isbn=9780425247853|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2011}} < /ref >   Some of the animals were killed and their meat processed and returned to the owners.  Some of the animals were set on fire in front of their owners. 
 
 In his [[autobiography|book about his own life]], ''Code Talker'', [[Chester Nez]] wrote that the Great Livestock Massacre hurt the [[work ethic]] of the Navajo people because it meant no matter how hard you worked to build your family's herd, the government could take it away. < ref name= " Nez "  / > 
 
 ==History== 
 
 According to Navajo traditional beliefs, the Navajo came into the world, which they call  " the glittering world, "  after passing through three other worlds. < ref name= " DiscoverHistory "  / >  According to historians and anthropologists, the Navajo were not the first humans to live in the Four Corners area, but they were already there in 1492.  The Spanish made contact with the Navajo in 1581. < ref name= " DiscoverHistory " > {{cite web|url=https://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture-and-history.aspx|publisher=Discover Navajo|access-date=July 23, 2020|title=Navajo History|archive-date=July 5, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200705222914/https://www.discovernavajo.com/navajo-culture-and-history.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Like many other Native American tribes, the Navajo suffered after white colonists came to the area.  After the [[Spanish-American War]] in the 1840s, the United States took over the land where the Navajo lived.  Many Navajo died during the [[Long Walk]], or Hwé​eldi Baa Hane', in 1864. < ref name= 
 " DiscoverHistory "  / >   The Long Walk was when the United States government made many Navajo leave their homes and go to Bosque Redondo Reservation.  It was not a real reservation; it was a camp with soldiers to keep people from leaving. < ref name= " SmithLong " > {{cite web|publisher=Smithsonian|url=https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/navajo/long-walk/long-walk.cshtml|title=The Long Walk: The Navajo Treaties|access-date=July 22, 2020}} < /ref >   Although they were allowed to go back years later, many died during the journey and during their time away. 
 
 The Navajo Nation government, called the Navajo Tribal Council, was established in 1923.  One of the reasons for this was that [[oil]] had been discovered on Navajo land. < ref name= " Gov " > {{cite web|title=Welcome to the Navajo Nation Government: History|url=https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/history.htm|access-date=July 23, 2020|publisher=Navajo Government|archive-date=July 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723022140/https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/history.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   The first election was in 1938.  In 1989, the government was changed to have three branches, judicial, legislative, and executive. < ref name= " DiscoverHistory "  / >   It is now the largest Native American government in the world. < ref name= " Gov "  / > 
 
 During the 20th century, many Navajo families lost much of their wealth in the Great Livestock Massacre. < ref name= " Nez "  / > < ref name= " Gendered "  / > < ref name= " Voice "  / >

 Navajo code talkers were bilingual [[Navajo language|Navajo]] speakers who were recruited during World War II by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. They served in their standard [[communication]]s units in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. The Navajo code was created by the first 29 Navajo [[Recruitment|recruits]] in May of 1942. About 400 Navajos were trained as code talkers. < ref name=NMAI > {{cite web |url=https://nmai.si.edu/education/codetalkers/html/chapter4.html |title=Code Talking |publisher=National Museum of the American Indians |access-date=7 February 2016}} < /ref >  Their training was [[wikt:intense|intense]] and all 17 pages of the code had to be [[Memory|memorized]]. < ref name=NMAI/ >  From 1942 to 1945 Navajo Code Talkers took part in every Marine [[Attack|assault]] in the Pacific Theatre. < ref name=hhcUSN > {{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/diversity/american-indians-in-the-navy/code-talkers.html |title=Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet |publisher=History and Heritage Command, United States Navy |access-date=7 February 2016 |archive-date=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207015040/http://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/diversity/american-indians-in-the-navy/code-talkers.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Navajos served in all six Marine divisions plus parachute units and the Marine Raider battalions. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >   The Navajo Code worked much faster than Morse Code, minutes instead of hours. < ref name= " DiscoverHistory "  / >  They transmitted messages on the [[battlefield]] including orders, troop movements and [[logistics]]. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >  While the [[Japan]]ese were able to break codes used by the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Army Air Corps]], they were never able to break the Marine codes. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >  Even a Navajo [[soldier]] captured during the [[Battle of Bataan]] could not figure out the code for the Japanese. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >  Major Howard Connor, a [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] signal [[officer]] at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] stated:  " Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima. " < ref name=hhcUSN/ > 
 
 The United States Military used the Navajo code in the [[Korean War]] and in the beginning of the [[Vietnam War]], so they kept the code a secret.  During the late 1960s, the United States stopped using the code, and declassified it in 1968, < ref name= " DiscoverHistory "  / >  meaning it was no longer a secret.  The code talkers were then allowed to talk about what they had done. < ref name= " Nez "  / > 
 
 On September 17, 1992, the Navajo code talkers of World War II were honored for their contributions at the [[Pentagon]] in [[Washington, DC]]. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >  The long delay was due to the Navajo code being [[Classified information]]. < ref name=hhcUSN/ >
