 A '''harpoon''' is a long [[spear]]-like instrument used in [[fishing]] to catch [[fish]] or large [[Marine biology|marine]] [[mammals]] such as [[whale]]s. It does this task by impaling the target animal, allowing the fishermen to use a rope or chain attached to the butt of the [[projectile]] to catch the animal. A harpoon can also be used as a [[weapon]]. 
 
 Typically, a harpoon for fishing has backwards-pointing [[barb]]s which stop the fish getting free.
