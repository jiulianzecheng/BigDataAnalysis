 {{wiktionary|fee}} 
 
 A '''fee''' is the price one gives as payment for services, especially the [[honorarium]] paid to a doctor, [[lawyer]], consultant or member of a learned [[profession]]. Traditionally, a fee is different to a ''payment'', [[salary]], or wage, because the fee usually is paid only once for the professional's services.
