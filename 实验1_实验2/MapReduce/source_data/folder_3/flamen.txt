In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Ancient Roman religion]], a '''flamen''' was one of fifteen [[priest]]s assigned to major deities with state recognized [[cult]]s during the [[Roman Republic]]. The most important of these were the three ''flamines maiores'' ( " major priests " ). They served as chief priests of the deities apart of the [[Capitoline Triad#Archaic Triad|Archaic Triad]]. The other twelve were known as the ''flamines minores'' ( " lesser priests " ). All fifteen flamens were part of the [[College of Pontiffs]], responsible for administering state-sponsored religion. < ref > [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], ''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil'' iv.262; [[Cicero]] ''Brutus'' 57. < /ref >
