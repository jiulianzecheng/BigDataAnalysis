 '''Riebeckite''' is a [[silicate mineral]]. It is found in nature as both a fibrous form and a [[solid]] form. The fibrous form, called '''blue asbestos''' or '''crocidolite asbestos''', is one of the six types of [[asbestos]]. It is considered by many experts to be the most dangerous type of asbestos. It can cause [[cancer]] and [[asbestosis]]. It was formerly used in Kent brand [[cigarette]]s as a filter material. It is rare in construction compared to [[white asbestos]], but it is sometimes found in caulking, cement, wallboard, rope, and numerous other products. Due to its hazards, blue asbestos is no longer mined commercially.
