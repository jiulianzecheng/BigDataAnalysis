A '''phase''' is one part of a [[cycle]] or change that goes in a circle. For example, the [[moon]] has phases.

 The seasons of the year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, are also phases. The planet [[Venus]] has phases, like the [[moon]]: [[Galileo]] showed that the phases of Venus meant it must go around the [[Sun]], not the [[earth]]. 
 
 [[Wikt:graph|Graphs]] can be made for things that have phases. Things that have phases change in some [[Wikt:regular|regular]] way from time to time. For example, a [[pendulum]] in a [[clock]] moves from some position (called its  " displacement " ) to the left (labelled -x with [[algebra]]), to the bottom, and then to some position to the right (labelled +x with [[algebra]]). Two pendulums may have the same length, but unless they begin swinging at the same time and place they will not move together. One may be swinging left while the other swings right. When something like that happens the two [[wikt:vibration|vibrations]] are ''' " not in phase. " '''
