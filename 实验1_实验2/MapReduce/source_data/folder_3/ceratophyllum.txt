 '''''Ceratophyllum''''' is a genus of [[flowering plant]]s, commonly found in [[pond]]s, [[marsh]]es, and quiet streams in tropical and in temperate regions. 
 
 ''Ceratophyllum'' grows completely submerged, usually, though not always, floating on the surface, and does not tolerate drought. The plant stems can reach 1â€“3 m in length. At intervals along nodes of the stem they produce rings of bright green [[Leaf|leaves]], which are narrow and often much-branched. The forked leaves are brittle and stiff to the touch in some species, softer in others.
