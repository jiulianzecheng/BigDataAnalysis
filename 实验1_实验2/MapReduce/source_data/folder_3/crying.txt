 Some animals also cry. However, animals mostly release tears for reasons such as intense [[pain]], and also cry when losing loved ones, seeing their own [[species]] being killed for their [[skin]] and [[meat]], but these two reasons are mostly rare. < ref > Why do we Cry?

 A useful term is ''lachrymation'', which means the non-emotional shedding of tears. There are many terms for the more usual crying: sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering. 
 
 In general, crying is [[non-verbal communication]]. It (and other) facial signals evolved in our species as ways which help people in social groups signal feelings. The term  " a cry for help "  recognises this function.  " Cry for joy "  expresses the fact that sometimes great delight can be the trigger for crying.
