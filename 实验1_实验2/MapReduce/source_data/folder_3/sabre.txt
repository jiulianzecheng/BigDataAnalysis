 The '''sabre''' ([[British English]]) or '''saber''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences|see spelling differences]]) is a type of [[backsword]]. It has a curved blade associated with the [[Cavalry|light cavalry]] of the Early Modern and [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]] periods. It was first associated with central [[European]] cavalry, such as the [[Hussars]]. It became widespread in Europe during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In particular the Croat light cavalry helped spread it. In the [[17th century]] a light sabre was also used by [[infantry]]. In the [[19th century]] sabres without curved blades became common. These could be used by heavy cavalry. The last sabre to be given to US cavalry was the Patton sabre (Model 1913 Cavalry Sabre) in 1913.  
 
 The sabre was used as a [[Duel|duelling]] weapon in [[fencing]] in the 19th century. This has led to the rise of sabre fencing, which first appeared at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]]. This discipline allows for cuts as well as thrusts, as did the historical sabre.
