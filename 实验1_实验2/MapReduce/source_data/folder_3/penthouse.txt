 A '''Penthouse''' is typically an [[apartment]] on the highest [[floor]] of an apartment [[building]]. It usually takes up less than half of the entire (flat) [[roof]] of the building. < ref > ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', ed. Cyril M. Harris (New York: Dover Publications, 1983), p. 408 < /ref >  Originally the word penthouse meant a small building with a sloped roof. < ref name=Hayes170.1 > Justin Cord Hayes, ''The Unexpected Evolution of Language'' (Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2012), pp. 170–171 < /ref >  The modern use of the word started in the 1920s in [[United States|America]]. In the age of [[skyscraper]]s the  " house "  on the roof was called a penthouse. < ref name=Hayes170.1/ >  A penthouse can also be [[Commerce|commercial space]].

 Under some [[Building code]]s a penthouse cannot be more than one-third the size of the floor below it. < ref name=Yatt142 >  Barry D. Yatt, ''Cracking the Codes: An Architect's Guide to Building Regulations'' (New York: J. Wiley, 1998), p. 142 < /ref >  There is no limit to the number of penthouses a building can have. The only limit is the amount of space they can take up (one-third rule). < ref name=Yatt142/ >  Also, some building codes do not allow [[Machine|mechanical]] or [[Electricity|electrical]] equipment to count as a penthouse unless they are enclosed by a [[roof]]. < ref name=Yatt142/ >
