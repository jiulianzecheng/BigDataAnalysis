'''Investiture''' < ref > from the Latin preposition ''in'' and  verb ''vestire'', 'dress' from ''vestis'' 'robe' < /ref >  means the formal installation of somebody (heir, elect of nominee) in public office by formally giving him the  " [[insignia]] " .  The term is normally reserved for formal offices of [[state]], [[aristocracy]] and [[church]]. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]] investiture was the [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] transfer of a [[fief]] by an [[overlord]] to a [[vassal]].  The lord ''invested'' the vassal with a fiefdom, by giving a symbol of the land or office.  From feudal times up to the present, the term has been used in [[canon law]] to refer to a [[cleric]] receiving the symbols of spiritual office, such as the pastoral ring, [[mitre]] and [[Staff of office|staff]], signifying transfer of the office.

 == Investiture Controversy == 
 
 The question who should invest (appoint) whom was the subject of a conflict between the [[Catholic church]] (mainly the [[papacy]]) and state (mainly the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) in the [[Middle Ages]] during the so-called [[lay investiture controversy]]. < ref name= " McKay1 " > {{cite book |last=McKay |first= John P. |author2=Bennent D.
