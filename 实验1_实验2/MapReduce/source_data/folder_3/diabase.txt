 '''Diabase''' (also known as '''dolerite''' or '''microgabbro < ref name= " Microgabbro " > {{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/bgsrcs/rcs_details.cfm?code=DOLR|title=BGS Rock Classification Scheme - Dolerite (synonymous with Microgabbro)|publisher=British Geological Survey|access-date=24 August 2015}} < /ref > ''') is an [[igneous rock]] that is often [[blue]] in colour. It is rich in [[magnesium]] and [[iron]]. 
 [[Dike (geology)|Dikes]] and [[Sill (geology)|sills]] in [[igneous rock]] are often made of diabase.  
 
 Diabase is mostly a [[silicate]] [[feldspar]] known as [[labradorite]] (about 40% to 70%). Most of the rest is [[pyroxene]] minerals (usually augite). Small amounts of [[hornblende]], [[olivine]], [[magnetite]], and [[quartz]] are in some diabase rocks.
