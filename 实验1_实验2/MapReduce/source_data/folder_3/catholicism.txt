 '''Catholicism''' is the [[tradition]]s and beliefs of Catholic Churches. It refers to their theology, liturgy, morals and spirituality. The term usually refers to churches, both [[Latin Church|western]] and [[Eastern Catholic churches|eastern]], that are in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]]. 
 
 In 2012, there were more than 1.1 billion Catholics worldwide. This makes up more than 17% of the [[world population]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news|title=Breaking News Stories from US and Around the World - MSN News|website=www.msn.com}} < /ref > 
 
 The word  " Catholicism "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''catholikismos'' ({{lang|el|καθολικισμός}}). This means  " universal " . 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 
 The word  " Catholicism "  refers to so many things, including its religious beliefs (called [[Theology|theologies]] and  " [[doctrine]]s " ), and its form of religious worship (called [[liturgy|liturgies]]).  The word also refers to Catholic religious beliefs about [[ethics]] (things that are right and wrong). It also refers to the ways that members of the Catholic religion live and practice their religion. < ref name= " McBrien " > {{cite book|last=McBrien|first=Richard P.|title=Catholicism|url=https://archive.org/details/catholicism0002mcbr|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1994|pages=[https://archive.org/details/catholicism0002mcbr/page/3 3]–19|isbn=9780060654054}} < /ref > < ref > For McBrien, the  " broad term "  refers exclusively and specifically to that  " Communion of Catholic Churches "  in communion with the Bishop of Rome. Richard McBrien, ''The Church: The Evolution of Catholicism'' (New York: HarperOne, 2008), 6, 281-82, and 356. In its [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_28051992_communionis-notio_en.html Letter on Some Aspects of the Church Understood as Communion] the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] stressed that the idea of the universal church as a communion of churches must not be presented as meaning that  " every [[particular Church]] is a subject complete in itself, and that the universal church is the result of a ''reciprocal recognition'' on the part of the particular Churches " . It insisted that  " the universal Church cannot be conceived as the sum of the particular Churches, or as a federation of particular Churches " . < /ref > 
 
 Many people use the word Catholicism to talk about religious beliefs of the [[Catholic Church]], whose leader is called the  " [[Bishop of Rome]] "  and often called the  " [[Pope]] " . The [[Catholic Church]] is based in the [[Vatican City]], a small independent country in the city of [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. < ref > McBrien, Catholicism, 19-20. < /ref >  Sometimes the word also refers to beliefs of other Christian churches, including the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Churches, who have many beliefs similar to the [[Catholic Church]], but do not believe the Bishop of Rome is their leader. 
 
 The word Catholicism is often used to tell the difference between the beliefs of Catholic Christians and the beliefs of others called [[Protestant]] Christians. Catholic and Orthodox churches use church leaders, called [[bishop]]s, to determine beliefs. Protestants, however, often use each member's own understanding of the [[Bible]] to determine beliefs. Protestants use guidelines from the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] to understand the Bible. < ref > The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Catholic'', p. 308 < /ref >  It is the world's second largest religious denomination after [[Sunnism]]. < ref > Religious Diversity and Children's Literature: Strategies and Resources, Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf - 2011, p 156 < /ref > 
 
 ==Where the word Catholic came from== 
 The oldest document that uses the name  " Catholic Church "  is a letter written by a man named [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]]. Ignatius lived in the ancient city of [[Antioch]]. In the year 107, Ignatius wrote a letter addressed to the Christian community in the ancient city of [[Smyrna]]. In this letter, Ignatius encouraged the Christian Community to be loyal to their leader, the [[Bishop]]. Ignatius wrote:

 == Groups who call themselves  " Catholic "  == 
 Many different [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (groups) of [[Christian]]s call themselves  " catholic " . Often these groups have special beliefs about their leaders, called [[bishop]]s. They believe [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (whom Christians believe is the [[Son of God]]) appointed the first bishops, who appointed future [[bishop]] < nowiki/ > s, who eventually appointed each community's current bishops. This appointing of leaders is called  " [[Apostolic Succession]] " . 
 
 The groups that use the term  " Catholic "  to talk about themselves are the:

 # [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], [[Anglican]], and some [[Lutheran]] and other groups 
 # Communities that believe they lost their  " Apostolic Succession " , but asked a different community to  " ordain "  new leaders for them. ( " Ordain "  or [[Consecration|consecrate]] "  is a word for the ceremony that makes a bishop or new religious leader.) 
 
 Not all communities believe that other communities use the term  " catholic "  properly. Also, not all communities believe that the other communities have apostolic succession either. For example, the Catholic Church believes that the Eastern Orthodox have apostolic succession. However, the Catholic Church does not believe that the Anglicans or Lutherans have it. 
 
 Eastern Orthodox have similar beliefs about Anglicans and Lutherans. Not all Eastern Orthodox believe that the Catholic Church has apostolic succession. Different members of the Eastern Orthodox churches have different opinions. 
 
 However, the Anglicans and Lutherans generally believe that all Christians are part of the  " catholic "  church. These groups have a very different understanding of the term  " Catholic " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617 & collectionID=711 & contentID=4334 & shortcutID=2077#nicene|title=Nicene Creed|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040415020835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617 & collectionID=711 & contentID=4334 & shortcutID=2077|archive-date=15 April 2004|access-date=21 November 2008}} < /ref > < !--{{Failed verification|date=February 2010}}-- > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ilflutheran.org/page11.html|title=Texts of the Three Chief Symbols are taken from the Book of Concord, Tappert edition|publisher=The International Lutheran Fellowship|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628165250/http://www.ilflutheran.org/page11.html|archive-date=28 June 2006|access-date=21 November 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 === How it was started === 
 Catholicism was started as a result of Jesus of Nazareth, a [[Jewish]] man whom Christians believe is the Son of [[God]], a Christian belief known as the [[Trinity (Christian)|Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Catholics believe Jesus to be a descendant of [[David]], a Jewish king from a long time ago. Jesus was [[crucified]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the year [[33|33 AD]]. Catholics believe Jesus rose from the dead, and spoke to his followers, called the [[twelve Apostles]]. They also believe that Jesus rose into [[Heaven]], and then sent the [[Holy Spirit]] to guide his followers at an event known as [[Pentecost]]. 
 
 One of his followers, the apostle named [[Saint Peter]], was appointed leader by Jesus and later became recognized as the first [[Pope]], or [[Bishop]] of [[Rome]], soon after that he was captured and was martyred in Rome. Catholics believe that Saint Peter was given the  " keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, "  meaning that Jesus made him and the apostles in charge of forgiving [[sin]]s. Catholics believe that [[Saint Peter]] passed the [[Apostolic Power]] (the ability to ordain [[priest]]s and consecrate the [[Eucharist]]), given to him by Christ, to the [[Pope]]s, who continue to pass the power through the [[papacy]] to this day. At the current time, the pope is [[Pope Francis]], who is the leader of the [[Catholic Church]]. The word ''pope'' comes from the [[Latin]] word for  " father. " 
 
 In 325, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] agreed on how to organize the church. The council agreed the Church had five [[patriarch]]s (patriarch was the highest type of church leader). The five leaders were the archbishops of [[Rome]] (the Pope), [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Jerusalem]]. The Patriarch of Rome was honored as  " first among equals. " 
 
 === Quarrels within the church === 
 In time, several groups split off from the [[Catholic Church]] because of differing opinions of [[theology]]. This caused breaks from the Church called [[schism]]s. Most schisms happened because people had different beliefs about what is true. 
 
 In 451, a church division happened when all the church leaders meeting at the [[Council of Chalcedon|Church Council in the city of Chalcedon]] [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] (cut off) three leaders, because they held to [[monophysitism]] and would not accept the view that Jesus had two natures (fully divine and fully human). These three were the bishops of [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Armenia]]. Of course, these three bishops did not accept being excommunicated either, so the churches under them are still known today as [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es. 
 
 In 1054, an Eastern part of the Catholic Church severed itself, in the [[East-West Schism]]. The church in Western [[Europe]] which followed the [[Pope]], became known as the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The churches in the rest of the world, which did not think that the Pope should lead all Christians, became known as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]].  " Orthodox "  means  " correct belief; "  as they believe that they have kept the teachings of the early church, and the Roman Catholics have not. 
 
 The next big secession was the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Protestants resisted the valid central authority of the Church in Rome and rejected many practices, beliefs and disciplines. The Reformation started in Germany, where [[Martin Luther]] sent his demands for change to the Church. Because of politics in Europe, many nations supported Luther. The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] was started. Later the [[Calvinist]] or [[Presbyterian]] Church started. 
 
 In [[England]], King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] started the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] church. He wanted to [[divorce]] his [[Catherine of Aragon|first wife]]; but the Pope wouldn't allow it, as the marriage was valid. At first, the church of King Henry VIII, the [[Church of England]], was very similar to the [[Catholic Church]]. The major difference was that the king was head of the church, instead of the Pope. Later, under his son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], the Anglican Church became more [[Reformed churches|reformed]] or Protestant. Anglicans, and several other [[Protestant]] denominations, still believe they are reformed Catholics. [[Puritanism]] arose among Anglicans who thought the reforms didn't go far enough. 
 
 After the Reformation, many other Churches began because of disagreements over beliefs and practices of earlier Protestant doctrine. According to the 2010 U.S. Religious Congregations and Membership Study, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.usreligioncensus.org/maps2010.php|title=Religion in America: Demographic Maps - U.S. Religion Census|website=www.usreligioncensus.org|access-date=2019-02-11|archive-date=2019-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209183112/http://www.usreligioncensus.org/maps2010.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  this accounts for most of the Protestant denominations in the United States. There are about 314,000 of these. Two examples of these Protestant (or Reformed) churches are [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Baptist]]. 
 
 == Religious Beliefs == 
 === The same aspects of Catholic and other Christians === 
 * The [[Ten Commandments]] 
 * The belief that God knows everything, that God has unlimited power, and that everything God does is good 
 * The belief that [[Jesus Christ]] died for the sins of the world, rose again, and one day  " will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. " 
 * The importance of worshipping God. 
 * The infallibility of the [[bible]] 
 
 === What is different from Eastern Orthodox Christians === 
 * The supremacy of the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]] (also known as the pope) 
 * the [[Filioque clause]] (Nicene creed) 
 
 === What is different from mainstream Protestants === 
 * Catholics believe in the real presence of Christ in the [[Eucharist]] (this is called [[Transubstantiation]]). 
 * Catholics believe God forgives mortal [[sin]]s through the [[sacrament]] of [[Absolution|reconciliation]] (confession), which is performed through a [[priest]], while most Protestants do not believe in the sacrament. 
 * Catholics hold to the authority of Scripture and Tradition, which the teaching authority of the Church Magisterium (the bishops in communion with the Pope) comes from, while most Protestants believe in ''[[Sola scriptura|Sola Scriptura]]'' (the [[Bible]] alone) 
 * Catholics believe that papal authority (in very specific, solemn occasions called  " ex Cathedra " ), the Bible, and the conclusions of [[ecumenical council]]s are infallible, while most Protestants believe in an [[Biblical inerrancy|infallible Bible]] but not an infallible Pope. Papal infallibility has been declared twice in the history of the Catholic Church. Once to state that Mary was conceived without sin and another to state that Mary was assumed into heaven body and soul. 
 * Catholics hold to a larger 72 book [[Books of the Bible|bible canon]], while Protestants typically hold to 66 books. 
 * Catholics venerate [[saint]]s, especially the [[Virgin Mary]] (Mother of God).  " Venerating saints "  means that Catholics give special honor to saints (people in heaven) because they believe that saints can pray for them directly to God. Many Protestants do not, because they regard  " venerating saints "  as  " worshiping saints " . Because they believe that only God should be worshiped, they do not venerate. Many Protestants also simply do not believe that any veneration is necessary. 
 * Catholics have an elaborate [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|mariology]], while most Protestants do not.
