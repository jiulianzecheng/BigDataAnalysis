 A '''heptagon/septagon'''/'''7-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 7 sides and 7 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular heptagon == 
 All sides of a '''regular heptagon''' are the same length. Each corner is 147. < span style= " text-decoration: overline " > 27 < /span > °. All corners added together equal 6840°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular heptagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > A = \frac{7}{4}a^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{7} \simeq 3.634 a^2. < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides.
