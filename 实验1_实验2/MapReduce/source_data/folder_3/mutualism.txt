'''Mutualism''' is a relationship between two [[organisms]] in which both benefit. It is a type of [[symbiosis]] which improves the biological [[fitness]] of both parties. The two organisms usually come from widely different types, often from different [[phyla]] or even [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. The term is not used for any cooperation between animals of the same [[species]]. 
 
 [[Edouard van Beneden]] (1809{{ndash}}1894) introduced the term into evolutionary biology and ecology in the 1870s. < ref > Boucher D.H. 1985. The idea of mutualism, past and future. In D.H. Boucher (ed) ''The biology of mutualism: ecology and evolution''. Oxford University Press. 1{{ndash}}28 < /ref > 
 
 Examples: 
 *[[Mycorrhiza]]: relationship between roots of plants and [[fungi]]. 
 *[[Rhizobia]]: relationship between roots of plants and [[bacteria]] which promotes [[nitrogen fixation]]. 
 *Many relationships between [[insect]]s and [[flowering plant]]s, where the insect gets food, and the plant gets transfer of [[pollen]]. 
 *[[Gut flora]]: many relationships between gut [[bacteria]] and [[herbivore]]s. The bacteria digest [[cellulose]], and get a regular supply of nutrients. Almost no animal can digest cellulose by itself. 
 *[[Lichen]]: an extremely close relationship between [[algae]] and [[fungi]]. Probably a mutualistic relationship, but less clearly. 
 *[[Fig]]s: each fig tree species is pollinated by its own wasp species. 
 *[[Cleaner fish]]: small fish which pick [[parasite]]s and dead matter from the mouth and body of much larger fish. The larger fish responds to the 'dance' of the cleaner by going passive.
