'''Currying''' is a technique used in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] that consists of changing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that takes several arguments into a number of functions that each take one argument.

Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[ML]] and [[Haskell]] say that functions can only have one argument.
