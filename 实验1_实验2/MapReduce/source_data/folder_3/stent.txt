In [[medicine]], a '''stent''' is a metal or plastic tube inserted into the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of an anatomic vessel or duct to keep the passageway open, and '''stenting''' is the placement of a stent.  " Stent "  is also used as a [[verb]] to describe the placement of such a device, particularly when a disease such as [[atherosclerosis]] has [[pathology|pathologically]] narrowed a structure such as an [[artery]].
