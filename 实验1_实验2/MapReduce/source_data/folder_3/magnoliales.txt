 '''Magnoliales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s. They are very successful, despite being an early type of flowering plant. 
 
 == Classification == 
 The Magloliales includes six families: 
 * [[Annonaceae]] (custard apple family, over 2000 species of [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, and [[liana]]s; mostly tropical but some temperate) 
 * [[Degeneriaceae]] (two species of trees found on Pacific islands) 
 * [[Eupomatiaceae]] (two species of trees and shrubs found in [[New Guinea]] and eastern [[Australia]]) 
 * [[Himantandraceae]] (two species of trees and shrubs, found in tropical areas in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Australia]]) 
 * [[Magnoliaceae]] (about 225 species including [[magnolia]]s and [[Tulip|tulip trees]]) 
 * [[Myristicaceae]] (several hundred species including [[Nutmeg]])
