 The '''Rhombozoa''', or '''Dicyemida''', are a group of tiny [[parasite]]s that live in the [[renal]] appendages of [[cephalopod]]s. 
 
 Classification is controversial. < ref name= " pmid17961212 " > {{cite journal |author=Aruga J, Odaka YS, Kamiya A, Furuya H |title=Dicyema Pax6 and Zic: tool-kit genes in a highly simplified bilaterian |journal=BMC Evol.

Traditionally, dicyemids have been grouped with the [[Orthonectida]] in the [[Mesozoa]]. However, [[Sequence analysis|molecular phylogeny]] indicates that dicyemids may be more closely related to the [[Nematoda|roundworms]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Pawlowski J, Montoya-Burgos JI, Fahrni JF, Wüest J, Zaninetti L |title=Origin of the Mesozoa inferred from 18S rRNA gene sequences |journal=Mol.

 == Anatomy == 
 Adult dicyemids range in length from {{convert|0.5|to|7|mm|in}}, and they can be seen through a light microscope. < ref name=IZ/ >  They have [[eutely]]: each adult individual of a given [[species]] has the same number of cells. Cell number is a useful identifying character.  
 
 The organism's structure is simple: a single axial cell is surrounded by a jacket of twenty to thirty [[cilia]]ted cells. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 248–249|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Life cycle== 
 Dicyemids exist in both [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[sexual reproduction|sexual]] forms. The asexual forms are found in juvenile and immature hosts; and the sexual forms in mature hosts.  
 
 The asexual stage is termed a ''nematogen''; it produces ''vermiform'' (worm-like) [[larva]]e in the axial cell. These mature through direct development to form more nematogens. < ref name=IZ/ >  Nematogens proliferate in young cephalopods, filling the [[kidney]]s. Later, as the hosts mature, sexual forms called ''rhombogens'' are formed. They are [[hermaphrodite]]s, with [[gonad]]s of both sexes. The rhombogens self-fertilise, and later release [[larva]]e.
