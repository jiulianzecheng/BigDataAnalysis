The '''Neoarchaean''' ('''Neoarchean''') is the last [[geology|geological]] [[era]] in the [[Archaean]] eon. It began 2.8 [[billion]] years ago and ended 2.5 billion years ago. < ref name=chart/ >  Before the Neoarchaean era was the [[Mesoarchaean]] era and before the [[Palaeoproterozoic]]. 
 
 [[Oxygen]]ic [[photosynthesis]] first [[evolution|evolved]] in this era. This led to an [[oxygen catastrophe]] in the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era. It was caused by a [[poison]]ous buildup of oxygen in the [[atmosphere]]. This was created by oxygen-producing [[photoautotroph]]s that evolved in the Neoarchaean. The [[supercontinent]] [[Kenorland]] formed during this period, about 2.7 billion years ago.
