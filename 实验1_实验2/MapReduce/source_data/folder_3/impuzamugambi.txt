 The '''Impuzamugambi''' was a [[militia]] that was created in [[Rwanda]] in [[1992]].   " Impuzamugambi "  means  " those with the same [[goal]] "  in [[Kinyarwanda]], Rwanda's [[official language]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://kinyarwanda.net/index.php?q=impuzamugambi & start=0 |title=Impuzamugambi |website=Kinwarwarda |access-date=April 13, 2016 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023107/http://kinyarwanda.net/index.php?q=Impuzamugambi & start=0 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The Impuzamugambi was made of young people from an [[ethnic group]] called the [[Hutu]]s.  A similar militia, the [[Interahamwe]], was also made of young Hutus.  Together, these two militias killed tens of thousands of [[Tutsi]]s, members of another ethnic group, in the [[Rwandan genocide]].  They also killed some Hutus who did not agree with the pro-Hutu [[government]]. 
 
 ==About the Impuzamugambi== 
 In 1992, two [[political party|political parties]] that supported [[Juvénal Habyarimana|the Hutu president]] created the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe.  These political parties were [[extremism|extremist]] pro-Hutu groups. < ref > Temple-Raston, Dina (2005).

 ==The Impuzamugambi during the genocide== 
 On April 6, 1994, Rwanda's President, [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], and [[Burundi]]'s President were in an [[airplane]] that got shot down.  Both men were [[Hutu]]s.  As the [[United States Department of State]] said later: < ref name=state > [http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/rwanda_0398_bgn.html Background Notes: Republic of Rwanda, March 1998.] Office of Central African Affairs, Bureau of African Affairs. [[United States Department of State]]. March 1998. Retrieved April 13, 2016. < /ref > 
 {{cquote|Both presidents were killed. As though the shooting down was a signal, military and militia groups began rounding up and killing all Tutsis and [[politics|political]] moderates [members of the government who were not [[extremism|extremists]]], regardless of their [[ethnic group|ethnic background]].}} 
 
 ===Roadblocks=== 
 Within half an hour of the airplane crash, the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe started blocking the roads in [[Kigali]], Rwanda's [[capital city]].  All Rwandans had to carry identification cards that said their [[ethnic group]] on them.  The militias killed every Tutsi they found. < ref name=uscis/ > 
 
 The militias kept using roadblocks, which became an important part of Rwanda's genocide [[wikt:strategy|strategy]]: < ref name=uscis/ > 
 * Identification cards made it easy to tell who was a Tutsi 
 * Leaders gave the militia lists of people they wanted to be killed; if one of these people stopped at a roadblock, the militia would kill them 
 * The roadblocks made Tutsis too scared to try to escape from Rwanda on the roads 
 
 ===Door-to-door killing=== 
 
 During the first few days of the genocide, the Rwandan Army and the Presidential Guard took charge of [[execution|executing]] people in Kigali.  However, the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe were with them, and the [[soldier]]s taught them what to do.  Soon, they were working together.  First the soldiers would fire [[grenade]]s, [[tear gas]], and [[machine gun]]s into places where Tutsis might be staying.  Then the militia were allowed to go in and kill everybody inside.  Often, they used [[machete]]s or [[club (weapon)|clubs]] to kill people.  Then the soldiers and militia would search, [[inch]] by inch, to find anyone who might still be hiding. < ref name=bbc > {{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26875506 |title=Rwanda genocide: 100 days of slaughter |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=April 7, 2014 |website=BBC News Online |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=April 10, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 In this way, the Rwandan army and the militias killed 20,000 people in the first five days of the genocide. < ref name=bbc/ > 
 
 ===Spreading the genocide=== 
 [[File:Rwandan Genocide Murambi skulls.jpg|thumb|left|325px|[[Skull]]s of people killed at Murambi Technical School]] 
 According to Human Rights Watch, before April 6, the militias had only about 2,000 members, mostly in Kigali. < ref name=hrw/ >   However:  " Once the genocide began and militia members began [[wikt:reap|reaping]] the rewards of violence, their numbers [increased quickly] to between twenty and thirty thousand for the [whole] country[.] " < ref name=hrw/ >   Eventually, the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe grew so much that together they had 50,000 members.  That was half as many members as the regular Rwandan Army had. < ref name=uscis > {{cite web |url=https://www.uscis.gov/tools/asylum-resources/ric-query-rwanda-14-august-2001 |title=RIC Query – Rwanda: The Role of the Interahamwe Militia During the 1994 Rwandan Genocide |author=Immigration and Naturalization Service Resource Information Center |date=August 14, 2001 |website=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services |publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security |access-date=April 11, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 This allowed the militias to spread the genocide around Rwanda.  There were militia all over the country.  However, the militia did not do all of the killing in the genocide.  They [[wikt:encourage|encouraged]], and sometimes forced, regular people to kill their Tutsi [[neighbor]]s, friends, wives, or husbands.  If they did not do this, they would be killed themselves. < ref name=prunier > {{cite book |title=The Rwanda Crisis: History of a Genocide |last=Prunier |first=Gérard |publisher=Fountain Publishers Limited |year=1999 |isbn=978-9970-02-089-8 |edition=2nd |location=Kampala |page=247}} < /ref > 
 
 The militias [[mass murder|massacred]] groups of Tutsis who were trying to hide in places like [[school]]s and [[church]]es.  For example, on April 21, 1994, in the [[Murambi Technical School]] massacre, militia members killed almost 65,000 Tutsis in one day. < ref name=murambi > {{cite web |url= http://www.museum.gov.rw/2_museums/murambi/genocide_memorial/pages_html/page_murambi_exibit.htm |title=Murambi Memorial |website=Genocide Memorials: Murambi |publisher=Institute of National Museums of Rwanda |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408033208/http://www.museum.gov.rw/2_museums/murambi/genocide_memorial/pages_html/page_murambi_exibit.htm |archive-date=April 8, 2008 |access-date=April 11, 2016 }} < /ref > < ref name=genarch > {{cite web |url=http://genocidearchiverwanda.org.rw/index.php/Murambi_Memorial |title=Murambi Memorial |website=Genocide Archive of Rwanda |publisher=AEGIS Trust |access-date=April 11, 2016 |archive-date=July 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220717074239/https://genocidearchiverwanda.org.rw/index.php/Murambi_Memorial |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The militias also [[rape]]d and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] many women and girls.  Overall, during the genocide, between 150,000 and 250,000 women and girls were raped (though there is no way to know how many of these [[crime]]s were committed by militia, and how many by army members). < ref name=un > {{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/education/rwandagenocide.shtml |title=Rwanda: A Brief History of the Country |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations |publisher=[[United Nations]] |access-date=April 10, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==End of the genocide== 
 The [[Uganda]]n [[army]] joined the a Tutsi [[rebel]] army in fighting the extremist Hutus.  Bit by bit, they took control of more parts of Rwanda.  Finally, on July 4, 1994, they took control of Kigali. < ref name=bbc/ > 
 
 After this, about two million Hutus ran away from Rwanda to [[Zaire]] (now called the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]).  With the Tutsis in control, the genocide ended. < ref name=bbc/ > 
 
 ==Prosecution and punishment== 
 
 Many of the Impuzamugambi were among the two million people who [[wikt:fled|fled]] from Rwanda to eastern Zaire.  The Tutsi and Ugandan armies went after them.  According to the [[BBC]],  " Human rights groups say the [Tutsi rebel army] killed thousands of Hutu [[civilian]]s as they took power {{ndash}} and more after they went into [Zaire] to [follow] the [militias]. " < ref name=bbc/ >   However, there is no way to know how many members of the Impuzamugambi may have been killed. 
 
 However, an international court was able to [[conviction|convict]] two of the Impuzamugambi's [[commander]]s: Hassan Ngeze and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza.  In 1995, the [[United Nations Security Council]] set up the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR).  Its goal was to [[prosecution|prosecute]] people who took part in [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, or [[crimes against humanity]]. < ref name=ictr > {{cite web |url=http://unictr.unmict.org/en/tribunal |title=The ICTR in Brief |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=Legacy Website of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda |publisher=United Nations |access-date=April 10, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2003, the ICTR found both Ngeze and Barayagwiza [[guilt (law)|guilty]] of planning and leading the genocide; trying to get other people to commit genocide; and crimes against humanity.  They were both [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] to life in [[prison]].  The sentence against Barayagwiza was later decreased to 35 years due to a legal mistake.  He will stay in prison for at least 27 years. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Twagilimana |first1=Aimable |date=2015 |title=Historical Dictionary of Rwanda |publisher=Rowman  &  Littlefield |page=119 |isbn=978-1442255913}} < /ref >
