 The '''pipits''' are a [[cosmopolitan]] genus '''''Anthus''''', of small [[passerine]] [[bird]]s with medium to long tails. Along with the [[wagtail]]s and [[longclaw]]s, the pipits make up the family [[Motacillidae]]. The genus is widespread, occurring across most of the world, except the driest deserts, rainforests and the mainland of Antarctica. 
 
 They are slender, often drab, ground-feeding insectivores of open country. Like their relatives in the family, the pipits are monogamous and territorial. Pipits are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled eggs.
