[[File:Hasiya krish.jpg|thumb|Sickle]] 
 A '''sickle''' is a curved cutting [[tool]] used in [[agriculture]] for harvesting [[grain]] [[crop]]s. It is a hand tool and was used before [[machine]]s for harvesting. It has a curved [[blade]] with an attached handle. The inside part of the curve is sharp, so the user can swing the blade against the crop's base, catching it in the curve and slicing it. Some sickles have a serrated blade like a [[saw]]. 
 
 A sickle is sometimes used as a [[weapon]]. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cronus]] and [[Perseus]] did this. 
 
 A sickle and a [[hammer]] are the symbols of the [[Soviet Union]].
