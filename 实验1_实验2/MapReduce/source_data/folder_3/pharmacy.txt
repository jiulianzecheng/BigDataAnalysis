 A '''pharmacy''' is a [[shop]] where [[drug|therapeutic drugs]] are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a  ''drug store or chemist and druggist store''. The people working in a pharmacy are called [[pharmacist]]s, druggist or [[chemist]]s (British English). These people can recognise simple [[diseases]] and dispense [[drug]]s for some of them. 
 
 Certain drugs are special, because they can be [[addiction|addictive]], or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A [[prescription]] is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out [[prescription]] < nowiki/ > s, which can then be used to get the drug. 
 
 Many pharmacies do not sell drugs only. They also sell [[beauty products]] and [[hygiene]]-related products, like [[tampon]]s for women and [[contraception|contraceptives]].   
 
 The number of pharmacies in England has been falling. There were 11,500 active pharmacies in 2022â€” the lowest total since 2015/2016. The number of prescription items given out in 2021/2022 was 1.1 billion, 2.7% more than 2020/2021. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Quinn|first=Helen|title=Community pharmacies at lowest number for seven years, NHS figures show|url=https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/news/community-pharmacies-at-lowest-number-for-seven-years-nhs-figures-show|access-date=2023-02-06|website=The Pharmaceutical Journal|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Pharmacology]] is a branch of [[chemistry]] that studies the molecular structure of drugs to find better drugs.
