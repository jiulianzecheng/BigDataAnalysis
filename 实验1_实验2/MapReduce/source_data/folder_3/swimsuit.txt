 A '''swimsuit''', '''bathing suit''' (sometimes shortened to bathers), or '''swimming costume''' (sometimes shortened to cozzie) is [[clothing]] designed to be worn for [[swimming]]. 
   
 '''Swimming trunks''' are a pair of [[shorts]] or [[briefs]] worn for [[swimming]] or bathing. 
 
 In [[New Zealand English]] and some areas of [[Australian English]], swimsuits are usually called '''togs'''. This term is less common in other parts of the English-speaking world where it may refer to clothes in general. Swimsuits can be skin-tight or loosely fitting. They range from garments designed to preserve as much [[modesty]] as possible to garments designed to reveal as much of the body as possible without actual [[nudity]]. They are often lined with a fabric that prevents them from becoming [[transparency |transparent]] when wet.
