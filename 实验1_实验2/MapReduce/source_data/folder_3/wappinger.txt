 The Dutch convinced the Eastern Wappinger to sell their lands.

 In 1655, the Wappinger fought the Dutch in the short [[Peach Tree War]] (1655). After this war, many Wappinger left their territories and the confederation fell apart.

 The Dutch [[Philipse Family]] purchased land from the chiefs of the Wappinger. This land was bought in the [[Philipse Patent]]. Wappinger sued to get the land back. They did not get their land back. < ref > Kammen, Michael (1996). ''Colonial New York: A History''. Oxford University Press. p. 302.

 [[Daniel Ninham]] (1726-1778) was the last chief ([[sachem]]) of the Wappinger. He went to England to the king. He asked for land rights and better treatement of Natives. The English had some understanding for the chief. However, they did not give land. The treatment of the Natives also did not change. < ref > Smolenski, John. and Humphrey, Thomas J., ''New World Orders: Violence, Sanction, and Authority in the Colonial Americas'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 [[ISBN (identifier)|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/9780812290004|9780812290004]] < /ref >   
 
 Daniel Nimham and Wappinger supported Americans in the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]]. After the war, the Wappinger moved to [[Oneida County, New York]]. They were with the [[Mohican]] and [[Oneida]] people. Later Wappinger mostly intermarried.  
 
 In the 19th century, the Wappinger were forced to leave their land and move to Wisconsin. This is now a reservation for the [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee Nation]].
