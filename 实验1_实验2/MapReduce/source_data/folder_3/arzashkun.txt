 '''Arzashkun''' ({{lang-hy|Արզաշկուն}}) was a [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the [[Kingdom of Urartu]] in the 9th century B.C. It is thought that the city was located north of [[Lake Van]] in what is now eastern [[Turkey]]. The [[city]] had two [[wall]]s and [[tower]]s.

 The [[nation]] of Urartu was at the [[headwater]]s of the [[river]] [[Tigris]] in the 9th century B.C. [[Shalmaneser III]], [[king]] of [[Assyria]] thought that Urartu was a danger to Assyria. He started an [[expedition]] to Urartu in 857. He said that he destroyed the capital, Arzashkun. He also claimed that he traveled as far as Lake Van and left his [[inscription]] on [[Mount Irritia]]. 
 
 It is believed that the name ''Arzashkun'' is the Assyrian form of an Armenian name.
