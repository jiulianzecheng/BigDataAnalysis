[[Image:Myoglobin.png|thumb|200px|A representation of the 3D structure of [[myoglobin]], showing [[alpha helix|alpha helices]], represented by ribbons. This protein was the first to have its structure solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] in 1958, for which they received a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].]] 
 
 A '''biomolecule''' is any [[molecule]] produced by a living [[organism]]. That includes large [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s, as well as many smaller molecules.  
 
 Biomolecules are used in biological processes such as [[cell division]], [[morphogenesis]], or [[developmental biology|development]]. < ref > Bunge M. 1979. ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'', vol. 4. Ontology II: A World of Systems, p. 61-2. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hpNzUzH1E4C & pg=PA61 link]. < /ref > 
 
 Just four [[chemical element|elements]]—[[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[nitrogen]]—make up 96% of the [[human body]]'s mass. But many other elements, such as the various '''biometals''',  are also present in small (but vital) amounts. < ref >  Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Wlater P 2002. ''Molecular biology of the cell'' (4th ed). New York: Garland Science. pp. 120–1. ISBN 0-8153-3218-1 < /ref > 
 
 Biometals are at the heart of many biomolecules. One or two atoms of [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[iron]] or [[manganese]] are in the most important biological molecules. < ref > Maret W 2018.

ISBN 978-94-007-5560-4 < /ref >  They act as cofactors, [[electron donor]]s, at the heart of key biological molecules. 
 
 ==Types of biomolecules== 
 A huge range of biomolecules exist, including: 
 
 * Small molecules: 
 ** [[Lipid]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[sterol]]s, [[glycerolipid]]s 
 ** [[Vitamin]]s 
 ** [[Hormone]]s, [[neurotransmitter]]s 
 **[[Metabolite]]s 
 * [[Monomer]]s, [[oligomer]]s and [[polymer]]s:
