 The '''''Kaiten''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 回天, [[translation|translated]] '' " Change the World " '' or '' " Reverse Destiny " '') was a [[torpedo]] that was changed to become a [[suicide]] [[weapon]], and used by the [[Navy]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] in the last months of the [[Second World War]]. It was basically a torpedo with a [[pilot]], and it could be thrown from a [[submarine]] or a [[ship]]. 
 
 The ''Kaiten'' was not very effective. Out of more or less 100 attacks made with them, only two enemy ships were sunk.
