 '''Endothelium''' is a layer of cells that line the walls of the [[circulatory system]] which carries blood around the body. < ref name=pvd > {{cite web |url= http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/91/10/3527.full |title=Endothelial Cells in Physiology and in the Pathophysiology of Vascular Disorders |first=Douglas B. |last=Cines |work=bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org |year=2012  |accessdate=25 October 2012}} < /ref >  The cells form a [[membrane]] so that certain substances, such as nutrients, can move through the walls. In an adult human there is about 1 kg of endothelium cells, which would cover an area of about  7m < sup > 2 < /sup > . < ref name=pvd/ >  The endothelium plays an important part in controlling the flow of blood around the body.
