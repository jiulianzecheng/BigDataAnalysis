 Hellois are one of the most common female spirits believed in [[Meitei mythology]] and [[Meitei folklore|folklore]]. < ref name= " chaki119 " > {{cite book| last = Chaki-Sircar| first = Manjusri| others = Internet Archive| title = Feminism in a traditional society : women of the Manipur Valley| url = https://archive.org/details/feminismintradit0000chak/page/119/mode/2up?q=Heloi+Hinchhabi| date = 1984| publisher = New Delhi : Shakti Books ; New York : Distributed by Advent Books| isbn = 978-0-7069-1967-7| page = 119 }} < /ref >  According to the [[Maiba]]s (priests), hellois are the most powerful female spirits. They could spread diseases, especially sexually transmitted infections. Hellois attack men and cause disorder of mind. From men, women may get sick in their sexual organs. According to belief, the highest rate of such attacks occurs in March and April. It is the time of celebrating [[Yaoshang]], a spring festival. At the same time, [[Thabal Chongba|Thabal Chongba]] occasions are performed by both men and women. < ref name= " chaki120 " / > 
 
 == In Meitei religion == 
 ''Helloi Oknaba'' (lit. ''Encounter with Hellois'' in [[Meitei language|Meitei]]) is one of the most common events of meeting with supernatural beings in [[Meitei folktales|Meitei folk stories]]. Challenges to or conflicts with the hellois often make one's life unhappy. In such cases, one may get sick, mental imbalance and temporary madness. If such people are not properly treated by a [[maiba]] or a [[maibi]], the symptoms may continue long. It may lead to permanent madness (mental impairment). One who meets a helloi often acts in abnormal and mentally challenged ways. < ref name= " archive129 " / >  For example, the victims may not be able to recognize his family members and friends. However, the victims could still communicate with the very helloi. The spirit may not easily leave the victim. She will demand something in return to leave the victim. Thus, Hellois seek their needs by bewitching people. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.language.1357/page/n135/mode/2up?q=Heloi|title=A collection of Essays in Manipuri Folklore|last1=Dr. Chirom Rajketan Singh|last2=Sadananda Mayanglambam|date=2013|page=135}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[maiba]]s perform rites and rituals to prevent attraction and attacks on men by the hellois. They feed the spirits with animal faeces and some specially prepared ritual foods. < ref name= " chaki120 " / >
