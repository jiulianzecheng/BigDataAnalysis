'''Thundersnow''', also known as a '''winter thunderstorm''', a '''snow thunderstorm''' or a '''thundersnowstorm''', is a [[thunderstorm]] with [[snow]] instead of [[rain]].  This rare kind of weather is less rare around the [[Midwestern United States]], the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Sea of Japan]], and [[Mount Everest]].  Thundersnow mostly happens in [[March]]. 
 
 ==How it is made== 
 *A thunderstorm at the front of a wave of cold air or warm air ([[cold front]] or [[warm front]]) 
 *The edge of a big ocean storm (or [[cyclone]]) where lower warm and higher cold air mix. 
 *Thunderstorms going over a warm lake while the air is [[cold]] (or [[lake-effect]]). 
 
 Thunder can be heard many miles away, but thundersnow thunder can only be heard a few miles away. The snow stops sounds of thunder more than rain does.
