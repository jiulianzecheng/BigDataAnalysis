'''Wahhabi''' ({{lang-ar|Al-Wahhābīyya }}الوهابية) or '''Wahhabism''' is the conservative form of [[Sunni Islam]] practised in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Qatar]]. People think [[Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab]], an 18th century scholar, started this belief. He wanted to see a return to the practices of the first three generations of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]].
