 '''Rhubarb''' is one of about 60 plants in the [[genus]] '''''Rheum''''', family [[Polygonaceae]]. The vegetable rhubarb is ''Rheum rhabarbarum'' (or ''Rheum x hybridum''). The leaves are somewhat [[toxic]] because they have oxalic acid, but the red stalks are [[baking|baked]] in pies, with sugar to soften their tart flavor. 
 
 There are many varieties grown for eating. The drug ''rheum'' is prepared from the [[rhizome]]s and roots of another species, ''R. officinale'' or medicinal rhubarb.
