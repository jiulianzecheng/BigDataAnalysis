 A '''disease''' or '''medical condition''' is an unhealthy state where something bad happens to the [[human body|body]] or [[mind]]. < ref > {{DorlandsDict|three/000030493|Disease}} < /ref >   Diseases can cause [[pain]], parts of the body to stop working the right way, or death. The word ''disease'' is sometimes used to include: 
 * parts of the body being hurt,  
 * not having the usual abilities,  
 * medical problems or [[syndrome]]s,  
 * [[infection]]s by [[microorganism]]s, 
 * feeling unhealthy, such as having pain or feeling hot (called [[symptom|'symptoms']]),  
 * unusual shapes of body parts. 
 
 == Causes == 
 A disease can be caused by many things.  Sometimes [[germ]]s enter our body through food, water or air.  A person can be [[Infection|infected]] by infectious agents like [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es or [[fungus]]. Disease can also be caused by eating bad or old [[food]]s. There are small [[Pathogen|germs]] in old foods that can cause diseases. Sometimes the [[germs]] produce [[chemicals]] or [[toxin]]s which causes the disease.  
 
 One of the most common causes of disease is poor [[sanitation]] and lack of clean water.  Some deadly diseases like [[malaria]] in [[tropical]] parts of the world are spread by a [[mosquito]].  Animals that spread disease are called ''vectors''. There are many vectors, including snails, ticks, and fleas.  
 
 Some people are born with '[[Genetics|genetic]] diseases'. These are diseases because of an error or [[mutation]] in a person's [[DNA]]. An example of a mutation is [[cancer]]. Living or working in an unhealthy [[environment]] can also be a cause for diseases. Diseases are more common in older people. 
 
 == Treatments == 
 Some diseases can be helped with [[medicine]]. [[Infection]]s can often be cured by [[antibiotics]], though [[resistance to antibiotics]] is a problem. Some disease may be helped by [[surgery]]. Not every disease can be helped with medicine or surgery, though. Some diseases must be treated during the whole life; they are ''chronic'' (long-lasting) diseases. An example of a chronic disease is [[diabetes mellitus]]. Diabetes can be treated (made better) but it can not yet be cured (made to totally go away). People who usually treat diseases are called [[Medical doctor|doctors]] or [[physician]]s. 
 
 == Prevention == 
 Some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who do not show any [[symptoms]]. If these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems. An example would be checking a woman for [[cervical cancer]] with a test called a [[pap smear]]. If cervical cancer is found early it can be cured. If it is found later it usually causes death.  
 
 Another example is [[immunization]]. The basic idea is to make the body ready for a disease. The body has its own defense against disease called the [[immune system]]. One special characteristic of the [[immune system]] is its ability to remember some diseases. If a person is sick and recovers, the immune system will produce a substance called [[antibodies]] which fight the disease if it comes back to the person.  
 
 The antibody is [[specific]] to a particular disease or [[antigen]]. An example of this is [[measles]] which is a [[virus]]. A person (usually a child) who had never been sick with [[measles]] is given a milder form of the [[virus]], this causes the [[immune system]] to produce antibodies against the virus. If this person is exposed to the same virus in the future, the person's immune system will remember and will fight the virus. 
 
 For general prevention to be useful: 
 *The disease must be found and stopped in early stage. 
 *The disease should be common or be easy to recognize. 
 *The test for the disease should be easy, work all the time, and not hurt people. 
 *The society is well-trained and can recognize most common symptoms on some diseases.  
 *The treatment for the disease should be safe and be easy for people to get. 
 
 ==Epidemiology== 
 {{Main|Epidemiology}} 
 Epidemiology is the study of the cause of disease. Some diseases are more popular for people with common characteristics, like similar origins, sociological background, food or nationality. Without good epidemiological research some diseases can be hard to track and to name. Some diseases can be taken for something else. This is why epidemiology takes a huge part in understanding how to protect ourselves against viruses, toxins and bacteria. < ref > {{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/health/research/08fatigue.html| title = Defining an illness is fodder for debate| author = Tuller, David| newspaper = The New York Times| date = 4 March 2011}} < /ref >
