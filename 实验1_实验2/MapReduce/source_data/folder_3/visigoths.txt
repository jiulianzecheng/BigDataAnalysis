 The '''Visigoths''' (''Western Goths'') were one of two main branches of the [[Goths]], an East Germanic tribe (the [[Ostrogoths]] were the other). Both were among the loosely-defined [[Germanic tribes]] that fought the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Migration Period]].  
 
 Most famously, a Visigothic force, led by King [[Alaric I]], succeeded in storming Rome in [[410]] AD. Later Visigothic kings ruled southern [[Gaul]], and [[Hispania]] after they had taken it from the [[Alans]] and the [[Vandals]]. 
 
 After the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Visigoths played a major role in [[Western Europe|southwestern Europe]] for another 250 years and adopted Roman culture and clothing.
