 '''Armour''' (or '''armor''' U.S.) is a protective covering or [[clothing]] to prevent [[injury]] from attack. Armour can be worn by a person, or it can be used to protect machines, animals, even [[buildings]]. Armour has always been made from the strongest materials available at the time, but weight has always been a problem. Early [[body armour]] was made from [[leather]]. Later, [[metal]]s were used (e.g. [[chainmail|mail]] or plate armour). Some modern armour, like [[bullet-proof vest]]s, are made from [[plastic]]s that do not stretch or break, such as [[Kevlar]]. These plastics may be woven into a cloth and used in layers, which makes them even stronger. 
 
 Plastic lamination (layers) is often used to protect windows against bullets.  Many [[jewellery]] stores, [[embassy|embassies]], and vehicles have [[bullet-proof glass]] with this feature. 
 
 == For vehicles == 
 Armour put on vehicles is usually made of metal and can include one layer over another with open spaces in between (spaced armour) or multiple layers of metal; ceramics (baked clay), and other materials. Another type of armour uses blocks of explosive that explode when another explosion goes off near it. This explosive armour protects by pushing against the other explosion. Vehicle armor is often angled to increase the amount of armour that must be shot through to get inside and to make the shot bounce off rather than piercing the armour. 
 
 [[Tank]]s have the heaviest armour of all land vehicles. Other military vehicles have armour, but not as much as a tank.  
 
 Sometimes armour is put in non-military vehicles, such as [[limousine]]s used by leaders of a country or by anyone who thinks they might be attacked, e.g. film stars or [[president]]s of major companies. 
 
 == For animals == 
 In the past, armour has also been used in wars to protect animals such as [[dog]]s, [[elephant]]s, and [[horse]]s. Today, [[police]] dogs and horses sometimes wear woven plastic [[bullet-proof vest]]s. 
 
 ==For sports== 
 Many [[sports]] involve violent physical contact and may be highly dangerous if the players are unprotected. Such sports include [[ice hockey]], [[American football]] and [[kendo]]. Sports armour is usually made from hard [[plastic]].
