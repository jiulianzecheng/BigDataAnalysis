A '''pretender''' is someone who says that he or she has the [[Rights|right]] to be ruler.  The word is often used to describe someone who claims that they have the right to be [[king]], [[queen]], [[emperor]] etc.  They claim that the ruler who is on the throne should not be there.  
 
 Sometimes people call such a person a  " claimant " . The person may be an [[imposter]] (someone who is pretending to be someone else).  Often they are pretending to be a prince or other royal person who is missing or whom people think is dead.  However, they may have a genuine right to the throne.  The word ''pretend'' comes from the French word ''pr√©tendre'' (from the Latin ''praetendo'' lit.  " to stretch out before " < ref > Cassell's Latin Dictionary, ed. Marchant  &  Charles < /ref > ).  It means: to profess, to make a loud statement.  In modern English the word ''pretend''  means  " to claim falsely " .
