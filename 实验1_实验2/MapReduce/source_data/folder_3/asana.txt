 '''Asana''' is a body position in [[Yoga]]. It can mean where a person sits, and the way that they sit. It helps to balance the mind and body. It is meant to be firm, yet comfortable. 
 
 All the many different body positions in Yoga are ''Asana''s:  they all have their own names and every name ends with  ''asana'', such as sav''asana'' (correct lying). Many have names of [[animal]]s, such as bujang''asana'' ([[cobra]]). Others have names that describe the position, such as shirsh''asana'' (head).
