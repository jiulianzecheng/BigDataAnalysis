 '''Firs''' (''Abies'') are about 45-55 [[species]] of [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] ''[[Pinaceae]]''. Fir trees can reach heights of 10–80 m tall and trunk diameters of 0.5–4 m when mature. The difference between firs and other members of the pine family is that their needle-like [[leaf|leaves]] are attached to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup, and by erect, cylindrical female [[Conifer cone|cones]] 5–25 & nbsp;cm long that release the winged [[seed]]s. The male cones are normally much smaller and spread through the tree so that the wind can help [[pollinate]] the female cones. < ref name= " rhs " > The RHS Encyclopedia of Garden Plants, edited by Christopher Brickell, Dorling Kindersley, London, 1996, {{ISBN|0751304360}}. p56 < /ref > 
 
 Like all members of the pine family, these trees have a sticky sap called resin. 
 
 Fir wood is not good to use in buildings because it is not very resistant to [[Insect|insects]] and decay. It is usually cut or squeezed into thin sheets or pieces and made into [[plywood]] or [[:en:Particle board|chipboard]] for indoor or temporary outdoor use. < ref > :en:Fir#Uses_and_ecology < /ref >  However, fir trees are used widely in [[gardening]]. They can be used as shelter trees to protect other plants from wind or grown alone as decorative trees. < ref name= " rhs " / >
