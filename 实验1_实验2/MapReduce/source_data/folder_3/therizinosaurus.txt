 '''Therizinosaurus''' was a huge [[herbivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.  
 
 New, well-preserved finds such as ''[[Alxasaurus]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Beipiaosaurus]]'' in 1996 provided details about the bird-like [[pelvis]], [[feet]] and [[skull]]s of primitive members. This helped confirm they belonged to the same group of theropod dinosaurs as ''Therizinosaurus'' and that therizinosaurs were, more specifically, advanced, herbivorous maniraptoran theropods. 
 
 Their [[fossil]]s were first found in the late 1940s in [[Asia]]. They were named in 1954 after more [[bone]]s were found. It was a thought to be a [[carnivore]] and [[herbivore]]; it had very long claws - they were about {{convert|90|cm|ft}} long. 
 
 ==Paleobiology== 
 The feeding habits of ''Therizinosaurus'' are unknown, since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet. However, like other therizinosaurs, it was probably primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]]. < ref name=svarney2003 > Svarney T.E. and Svarney P.B. 2003. ''The handy Dinosaur answer book''. 1st ed.

 There are multiple possible functions that could have been served by the claws of ''Therizinosaurus'', such as defense against predators (e.g. the contemporary ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'') and in intraspecific fighting, such as fighting for territory or for mating, or to pull leafy tree branches towards its mouth. The claws may have served all these functions.
