 The '''Iditarod''' is the worldâ€™s most famous [[Sled dog racing|dog sled]] race. It is an annual race that starts on the first Saturday of March in [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and ends in [[Nome, Alaska]].  The annual race crosses the [[Alaska Range]] and Kuskokwim Mountains [[mountain range|range]].  The contestants in the race go northwest from Anchorage. Then they turn north and go along the [[Bering Sea]] to Nome.  On even years they take the route that goes more north and on odd years they take the route that goes more south. [[White Mountain, Alaska|White Mountain]] is the last of three rest stops for teams in the race.  
 
 Iditarod is an endurance sport for the sled driver and the dogs.  They have to keep moving for 1,100 miles.  All the paths are cold, icy, and snowy.  12 to 16 dogs are in the race.{{clarify}} 
 
 The current way the Iditarod is run today started in 1973.  There were also shorter races that started in 1967. The first shorter race took place in the years from 1967 - 1973.  The shorter races were held on the Iditarod trail which was an old mail route.
