 The '''Jurassic''' is the second and middle [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]] in the [[Mesozoic era]] and the eighth period in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]].  
 
 It began 201.3 [[million]] years ago, and ended 145 million years ago. The Jurassic period happened between the [[Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. 
 
 == Climate == 
 During the Jurassic period, the [[climate]] was hotter and wetter than it is today. [[Carbon dioxide]] levels and [[sea level]]s were also higher than today.   
 
 The [[Kimmeridge Clay]] of the [[Upper Jurassic]] was laid down in an [[environment]] which does not exist on the earth today. < ref name= " Chambers "  / >  Much of [[Western Europe]] was covered by a high [[sea level]]. The supercontinent [[Pangaea]] was beginning to break up, causing a narrow [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Because of this, the [[United Kingdom]] was covered by a shallow and largely [[anoxic]] [[sea]], perhaps less than 100 [[metre]]s deep, with occasional landmasses.  
 
 This was shallower water than the [[Blue Lias]] of the [[Lower Jurassic]]. It was often low in [[oxygen]], which caused its [[Organic matter|organic]] material to [[Decomposition|decompose]], but only partially. The Jurassic's [[mudstone]]s are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the [[North Sea]] [[oil]]. < ref name= " Chambers " > Chambers, Martin 2000. ''The Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay''.

 == The world of the Jurassic == 
 === Plate tectonics === 
 
 The Jurassic started with all the continents together, 201.3 million years ago (mya). This was the global [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. It ended about 145 mya. The boundary with the following [[Cretaceous period]] is not marked by any clear signs. 
 This is the only boundary between geological periods which has no clear markers. 
 
 The Jurassic happened in two parts. The first was marked by widespread oceanic [[anoxia]], ocean acidification, and relatively high temperatures. This was likely caused by the eruptions in what we now call South Africa. Already, Pangaea was beginning to break up. From now on it was [[Laurasia]] to the north, and [[Gondwana]] to the south. The break-up of Pangaea took a long time to complete. The process of pulling apart in geology is called  [[Rift (geology)|rifting]]. [[Flood]]s of [[lava]] flowed from [[fissure]]s (splits) and [[volcano]]s.  
 
 By the end of the Jurassic, [[South America]] had begun to part from [[Africa]]. In the western part of [[North America]], [[mountain]] ranges began to form. This continued as the American [[tectonic plate]]s gradually moved west. The westward-moving North American plates gradually rode over the [[Pacific Ocean]] plates to form the [[Rocky Mountains]]. < ref > Levin, Harold 2006. ''The Earth through time''. Wiley, Hoboken N.J. Chapters 13  &  14. < /ref > 
 
 == Palaeontology == 
 On sea and land, [[evolution]]ary trends which started in the [[Upper Triassic]] continued through the Jurassic. [[Archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s dominated the land [[biota]]. [[Reptile]] groups [[adaptive radiation|radiated]] and filled many [[niche]]s. [[Dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[Ocean|marine]] reptiles ([[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[turtle]]s) all flourished. < ref > Benton M. 1990. ''The reign of the reptiles''. Crescent, N.Y. < /ref >  A recent discovery has shown that [[pliosaur]]s (a clade of large plesiosaurs) may have been top predators in the Upper Jurassic. 
 
 Amongst [[invertebrate]]s, there was much change. Modern predators like [[starfish]], [[crab]]s, and hole-boring [[gastropod]]s took over the sea floor, eating the [[benthic]] [[fauna]] in huge numbers. [[Brachiopod]]s gradually lost their grip on the in-[[shore]] [[habitat]]s; [[mollusc]]an [[bivalve]]s took their place.  
 
 Early [[mammal]]s existed, but mostly as small [[nocturnal]] creatures on the margins of the reptilian world. The first [[fossil]]s of small dinosaurs with [[feather]]s, such as ''[[Anchiornis]],'' come from the Jurassic period. The famous fossil [[bird]], ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', lived in the [[Upper Jurassic]], though we now know it was not the ancestor of modern birds. 
 
 In the last 20 million years of the Cretaceous period (Turonian–Maastrichtian ages), with the extinction of the ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs, [[Mosasaur|mosasaurs]] became the dominant marine predators. 
 
 == Land plants == 
 The dominant land plants were the [[Fern|ferns]] (especially [[tree fern]]s), [[gymnosperm]]s ([[conifers]]), large [[horsetail]]s, '[[monkey puzzle]]' trees, [[ginkgos]] and [[cycad]]s. The [[coal]]fields laid down in the first part of the Jurassic were formed mainly from tree ferns, which grew thickly. They were for a time the most common plant type. 
 
 [[Ginkgo]]ales, of which the only living species is ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'', were more diverse during the Jurassic. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Fabiany|last2=Shi|first2=Gongle|last3=Ichinnorov|first3=Niiden|last4=Takahashi|first4=Masamichi|last5=Bugdaeva|first5=Eugenia V.|last6=Herendeen|first6=Patrick S.|last7=Crane|first7=Peter R.|date=2017-03-21|title=The presumed ginkgophyte Umaltolepis has seed-bearing structures resembling those of Peltaspermales and Umkomasiales|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=12|pages=E2385–E2391|doi=10.1073/pnas.1621409114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5373332|pmid=28265050|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  These plants were not easy to digest, compared to modern flowering plants (Angiosperms). < ref > Amos, Jonathan 2019. Mission Jurassic: searching for dinosaur bones. ''BBC News''. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nxVbFidDbs/mission-jurassic] < /ref >  They must have spent longer in the gut than the food of modern [[herbivores]]. That would make increased size an advantage for [[ankylosaurs]] and [[sauropods]]. Sauropods did indeed become much larger in the Jurassic than any animal land life had before. 
 
 === Coal measures === 
 The Jurassic is the second period notable for large coal seams (the first being the [[Pennsylvanian|Upper Carboniferous]]). Once again, plants which grew and died in stagnant water did not decompose well, and formed coal as a result. The coalfields laid down in the first part of the Jurassic were formed mainly from [[Tree fern|tree ferns]], which grew thickly. They were for a time the most common plant type.
