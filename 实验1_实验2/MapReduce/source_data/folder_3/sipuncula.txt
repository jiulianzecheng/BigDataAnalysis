 The '''Sipuncula''', also known as the '''Sipunculida''', or '''peanut worms''', are a small [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of marine worms, < ref name=IZ/ >  or they may be a [[class (biology)|class]] in the [[Annelida]]. < ref > Anderson D.T. 1998.

 ==Anatomy== 
 Sipunculans are worm-like animals ranging from {{convert|2|to|720|mm|in}} in length, with most species being under {{convert|10|cm|in}}. The body consists of a narrow front section, called the ''introvert'' and a larger trunk section. The introvert is retractable into the trunk. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders|location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 863–870|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Sipunculans have a [[coelom]] (body cavity), and a body wall somewhat similar to that of [[annelid]]s. The body wall is strong and [[muscle|muscular]]. When threatened, Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a [[peanut]] [[seed|kernel]] – a practice that has given rise to the name  " peanut worm " . 
 
 ===Introvert=== 
 The most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth, which is surrounded by a mass of 18–24 [[cilia]]ted [[tentacle]]s, all of which may be inverted into the body. The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and probably also function as [[gill]]s. The mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert, which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules. In contrast, the trunk tends to be relatively smooth.
