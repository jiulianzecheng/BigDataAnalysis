 The '''Stasi''' was the official state security service of [[East Germany]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] in short the GDR. The Stasi motto was  " ''Schild und Schwert der Partei'' "  (Shield and Sword of the Party).  " The Party "  was the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]. The main job of the Stasi was to prevent opposition to the Party. 
 
 It was one of the most effective and ruthless [[secret police]] agencies in the world. < ref > Chambers, Madeline [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/04/us-germany-wall-stasi-idUSL118487020091104 No remorse from Stasi as Berlin marks fall of Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041544/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/04/us-germany-wall-stasi-idUSL118487020091104 |date=2015-10-16 }}, [[Reuters]], 4 Nov 2009. < /ref > < ref > [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/5351229/Angela-Merkel-turned-down-job-from-Stasi.html Angela Merkel 'turned down' job from Stasi], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 14 November 2012. < /ref > < ref > Connolly, Kate,[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/01/world/fg-germany-stasi1 'Puzzlers' reassemble shredded Stasi files, bit by bit], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 1 November 2009. < /ref > < ref > Calio, Jim, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-calio/the-stasi-prison-ghosts_b_359690.html The Stasi prison ghosts], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 18 November 2009. < /ref > < ref > Rosenberg, Steve, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6692895.stm Computers to solve Stasi puzzle], [[BBC]], 25 May 2007. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/east-german-spies-new-study-finds-more-stasi-spooks-a-540771.html New study finds more Stasi spooks], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 11 March 2008. < /ref >  The Stasi headquarter was in [[East Berlin]], with a group of buildings in [[Lichtenberg]] and several other buildings in Berlin.  
 
 One of its main tasks was [[spy]]ing on the people, through a vast network of citizens who were informants ( " snitches " ). Informants were paid, or given favours for this.   
 
 The Stasi also worked as an [[intelligence agency]] abroad, using [[espionage]] and [[covert operation]]s in foreign countries. Under its long-time head [[Markus Wolf]] it got a reputation as one of the most effective intelligence agencies of the [[Cold War]]. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, many Stasi officials were prosecuted for their crimes. The files that the Stasi had kept on millions of East Germans were laid open. Now citizens can see their personal files on request; these files are kept by the [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives]].
