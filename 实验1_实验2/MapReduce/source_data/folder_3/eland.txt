 The '''eland''' is the largest [[antelope]]. There are two [[species]], both [[Africa]]n.  
 
 The '''common eland''', ''Taurotragus oryx'', is from [[East Africa]] and [[South Africa]]. The '''giant eland''', ''Taurotragus derbianus'', is found in [[Sudan]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Cameroon]] and [[Senegal]]  and [[West Africa]]. 
 
 The two species are rather similar in size: males range in size from {{convert|600|and|800|kg}} and may even reach a ton on rare occasions; females range from {{convert|400|and|600|kg}}. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2005/Rivers/generalinformation.html |title=General Information |publisher=Bio.davidson.edu |accessdate=2011-01-05}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/common-eland/tragelaphus-oryx/facts-and-status.html |title=Common eland at Arkive |publisher=Arkive.org |accessdate=2011-01-05 |archive-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201023842/http://www.arkive.org/common-eland/tragelaphus-oryx/facts-and-status.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/common_eland.shtml |title=Common eland: ''Tragelaphus (Taurotragus) oryx'' |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2011-01-05 |archive-date=2012-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217221335/http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/common_eland.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Taurotragus_oryx.html |title=Common Eland at |publisher=Ultimateungulate.com |accessdate=2011-01-05}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/common_eland.shtml |title=The living Africa-back to wildlife |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2011-01-05 |archive-date=2012-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217221335/http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/common_eland.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Giant eland are alert and wary, making them difficult to approach and observe. They are gregarious, and [[migrate]] in small [[herd]]s of twenty or so animals. Giant eland live in open [[forest]] and [[savannah]] where they eat [[grass]], [[leaves]], and [[branch]]es. Common eland live in large herds.  
 
 Observers have, as usual, found it difficult to measure their speed of running. Some claim they move quickly, running at over {{convert|70|km/h}}, and despite their size are exceptional jumpers, easily clearing heights of {{convert|1.5|m}}. < ref > Note: these figures are only rough or approximate figures < /ref >  Others claim elands are one of the slowest antelopes, < ref name= " seaworld1 " > {{cite web |url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/artiodactyla/common-eland.htm |title=Animal bytes - Common eland |publisher=Seaworld.org |accessdate=2011-01-05 |archive-date=2012-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619004728/http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/artiodactyla/common-eland.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  but can even jump a height of {{convert|2.5|m}} or more. 
 
 When walking, tendon or joints in the eland's foreleg produce a sharp clicking sound, the cause of which is not known. The sound carries some distance and is a good indication of an approaching herd. Naturalists think it is a form of communication in elands. < ref name= " seaworld1 " / >
