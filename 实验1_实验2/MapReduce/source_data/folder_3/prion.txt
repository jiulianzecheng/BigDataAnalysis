 A '''prion''' (pronounced ''pree-on)'' is an infectious [[protein]]. The word is short for  " proteinaceous infectious particles " .  
 
 All known prion diseases in [[mammals]] affect the structure of the [[brain]] or other [[neuron|neural]] tissue. Right now, they cannot be treated and always end in death. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Prusiner SB | title = Prions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 23 | pages = 13363–83 | date = Nov 1998 | pmid = 9811807 | pmc = 33918 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.23.13363 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9513363P | doi-access = free }} < /ref > 
 
 Prions cause many forms of [[encephalitis]], or [[brain]] disease, such as [[prion disease|scrapie]], [[chronic wasting disease]], [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease]], [[Mad cow disease|bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] and [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]]. Prions work by changing the shape of proteins in infected animals. While normal proteins have lots of [[alpha helix|alpha helices]], or twisted parts, changed proteins have lots of [[beta sheet]]s, or flat parts. It has also been suggested that [[Alzheimer's disease]] causes damage to the prions.  < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Kellett |first1=Katherine AB |last2=Hooper |first2=Nigel M |title=Prion protein and Alzheimer disease |journal=Prion |pages=190–194 |date=2009|volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.4161/pri.3.4.9980 |pmid=19887909 |pmc=2807690 }} < /ref > 
 
 Because prions are proteins, and proteins cannot reproduce themselves, it is a mystery how prions work. A lot of [[molecular biology]] research is going on to find out how they reproduce themselves, with no clear result so far.
