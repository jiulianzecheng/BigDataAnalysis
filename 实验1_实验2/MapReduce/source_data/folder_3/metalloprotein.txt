 A '''metalloprotein''' is a [[protein]] that contains a [[metal]] [[ion]] [[Cofactor (biochemistry) |cofactor]]. < ref name=AS > {{cite book |last=Shriver |first=D.F |author2= Atkins P.W. |title= Inorganic chemistry |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=1999 |edition= 3rd |chapter= Chapter 19, Bioinorganic chemistry |isbn=0-19-850330-X }} < /ref >  A large fraction of all proteins are members of this [[category]], so the number is very large. 
 
 It is estimated that about half of all proteins contain a metal. < ref > Thomson A.J.  &  Gray H.B. 1998.  " Bio-inorganic chemistry " . ''Current Opinion in Chemical Biology''. '''2''', 155-158. {{doi|10.1016/S1367-5931(98)80056-2}} < /ref >   In another estimate, about one-quarter to one-third of all proteins need metals to carry out their functions. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Waldron K.J.  &  Robinson N.J |title=How do bacterial cells ensure that metalloproteins get the correct metal? |journal= Nat.
