 '''Cannibalism''' is where a member of a [[species]] eats the [[flesh]] of another member of that species. It is also called '''anthropophagy''' when humans do it. [[Anthropologist]]s are not sure how widespread it was, but it did happen in some [[societies]]. 
 
 The word 'cannibalism' comes from the [[Island Carib]] people of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. They got a long-standing reputation as cannibals when their legends were recorded in the 17th century. < ref name= " brief history " > Brief history of cannibal controversies; David F. Salisbury, August 15, 2001, Exploration, Vanderbuilt University.

 Cannibalism was widespread in the past among humans in many parts of the world, continuing into the 19th century in some isolated [[Australasia|South Pacific]] cultures, and to the present day in parts of [[tropical]] [[Africa]]. Cannibalism was certainly practiced in [[New Guinea]] and in parts of the [[Solomon Islands]], and flesh markets existed in some parts of [[Melanesia]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Knauft| first = Bruce M.| title = From Primitive to Postcolonial in Melanesia and Anthropology| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YM18gG16Z7YC & pg=PA104| year = 1999| publisher = University of Michigan Press| isbn = 0-472-06687-0| page = 104 }} < /ref >  [[Fiji]] was once known as the 'Cannibal Isles'. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Sanday| first1 = Peggy Reeves| last2 = Godelier| first2 = Maurice| title = Divine Hunger: Cannibalism as a Cultural System| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SYW6EzB9rYkC & pg=PA151| year = 1986| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-31114-4| page = 151 }} < /ref >  Cannibalism has been well documented around the world, from [[Fiji]] to the [[Amazon Basin]] to the [[Congo Basin]] to the [[MƒÅori]] in [[New Zealand]].
