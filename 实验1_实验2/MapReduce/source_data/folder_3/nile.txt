 The '''Nile''' (النيل ''an-nīl'') is a [[river]] in [[Africa]]. It is the longest river on [[Earth]] (about 6,650 & nbsp;km or 4,132 miles), though other rivers carry more water.  
 
 Its longest section starts in [[Lake Victoria]], and flows into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Alexandria]]. It gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word  " Νεῖλος "  (''Neil's'').  
 
 This longest part is called the White Nile. It flows from [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Uganda]], and through [[Sudan]] to [[Khartoum]]. There it is joined by the Blue Nile to form the Nile proper, which then flows through [[Egypt]]. The Blue Nile comes from [[Ethiopia]] near the [[Red Sea]]. The two branches meet near Khartoum, in the Sudan. About 300 million cubic metres of water [[Discharge (hydrology)|flow down]] the Nile each day. 
 
 The Nile is essential to the drier countries in the north of Africa. On the Nile there are many [[boat]]s: it is one of the easiest ways to [[transport|get around]]. Historically, most[[city|cities]] in Egypt are built next to the river, and the [[pyramid]]s are close to the Nile. The Nile has always provided most of the water used to grow [[crop]]s in Egypt: much of the rest of the country is a [[desert]]. In ancient times the Nile flooded every year and the people would starve if there was not enough water for the crops. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians got [[papyrus]] from the Nile to write on. Papyrus is made from a plant which grows near the Nile. 
 
 Many different types of [[animal]]s live in or near the waters of the Nile, including [[crocodile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[fish]] and many others. Not only do animals depend on the Nile for survival, but also people who live there need it for everyday use like [[washing]], as a water supply, keeping crops watered and other jobs. 
 
 [[Pyramid]]s were built close to the Nile because they needed the granite stones from [[Aswan]] to be transported by barges down the Nile. 
 
 == History of the word Nile == 
 [[File:Iteru.png|thumb|left]] 
 
 The word  " Nile "  comes from Greek ''Neilos'' ({{lang|grc|ὁ Νεῖλος}}). < ref > Spelling of Greek taken from the ''Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary'', 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-19-860512-6}}, p. 362 < /ref >  Neilos came from the word  " river valley " . In the ancient [[Egyptian language]], the Nile is called ''Ḥ'pī'' or ''iteru'', meaning  " great river " , represented by the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] shown above (literally ''itrw'', and '[[N-water ripple (n hieroglyph)|waters]]' [[determinative]]). < ref > [http://www.glyphdoctors.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=802 What did the ancient Egyptians call the Nile river?] Open Egyptology. (Accessed 17 October 2006) < /ref >  In [[Coptic language|Coptic]], the words ''piaro'' (Sahidic) or ''phiaro'' (Bohairic) meaning  " the river "  (lit. p(h).iar-o  " the.canal-great " ) come from the same ancient name.
