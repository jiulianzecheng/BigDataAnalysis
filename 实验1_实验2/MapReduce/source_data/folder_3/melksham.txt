 Melksham has very very poor transport infrastructure, with less than one train every 2 hours to nearby towns. The bus services are also as infrequent. 
 
 The main attraction in Melksham is it’s array of supermarkets, including [[Asda]], [[Aldi|Aldi,]] [[Lidl|Lidl,]] [[Waitrose]], [[Sainsburys]] and [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]]. It has the highest supermarket density in mainland Britain. There isn’t, however, a [[Tesco]] (except a small Tesco Metro) or [[Morrisons]].
