The '''Casentino''' is the valley in which the first tract of the [[Arno River]] flows till [[Subbiano]], in the Italian region [[Tuscany]]. It is one of the four valleys in which the [[Province of Arezzo]] is divided. The valley's biggest ''comuni'' are all in the Arno valley: among these the biggest are [[Bibbiena]] and [[Poppi]], while [[Capolona]], [[Castel Focognano]], [[Castel San Niccol√≤]], [[Pratovecchio]], [[Stia]], [[Subbiano]] are more or less smaller. The villages on the neighbouring hills and mountains are much smaller. These are [[Chitignano]], [[Chiusi della Verna]], [[Montemignaio]], [[Ortignano-Raggiolo]] and [[Talla]]. The Casentino is mentioned in the song  " Ich hab in Penna einen Liebsten wohnen " , from the ''Italieniches Liederbuch'' by [[Hugo Wolf]].
