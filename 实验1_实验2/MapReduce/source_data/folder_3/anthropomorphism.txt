 '''Anthropomorphism''' is the addition of [[human]] [[trait]]s to something that is not a human. For example, the non-human might have human [[emotion|feeling]]s, needs, and wants. < ref name= " oed " > Oxford English Dictionary.  " Anthropomorphism, n.

 Anthropomorphism is often used in stories and art. The story of the  " [[Three Little Pigs]] "  has a [[wolf]] and three [[pig]]s who talk and act like humans. Disney's [[Mickey Mouse]] also talks and acts like a human. An anthropomorphized animal is called a  " [[furry]] " . 
 
 The novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' also uses anthropomorphism. The main character is a [[dog]] named Buck. Many other characters are dogs and wolves. In the story, the animals think and act more like humans than dogs. 
 
 ==Reasons for anthropomorphism== 
 Humans can usually explain why humans do things. Humans are not as good at explaining why non-human things do things. This can lead to people assuming non-human things will do things like humans. 
 
 Humans learn about other humans early in life. They know more about humans than about things that are not humans, and they can remember it better. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|title = On seeing human: A three-factor theory of anthropomorphism|url = https://archive.org/details/sim_psychological-review_2007-10_114_4/page/864|journal = Psychological Review|pages = 864–886|volume = 114|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.114.4.864|pmid = 17907867|first1 = Nicholas|last1 = Epley|first2 = Adam|last2 = Waytz|first3 = John T.|last3 = Cacioppo|year = 2007|citeseerx = 10.1.1.457.4031}} < /ref >
