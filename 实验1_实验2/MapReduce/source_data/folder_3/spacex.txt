 [[File:SpaceX crew 7 crew portrait.jpg|thumb|The astronauts on the Crew-7 mission]] 
 '''Space Exploration Technologies Corp.''' ('''SpaceX''') is an American aerospace [[company]] in [[Hawthorne, California]]. The company makes and launches [[Launch vehicle|space rockets]] and [[communications satellite]]s (some of which one can use to have a [[connection]] to the [[internet]]). SpaceX was founded in 2002 by [[Elon Musk]]. SpaceX makes the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] rockets, some rocket engines, [[SpaceX Dragon 2|Dragon]] spacecraft and [[Starlink]] satellites. 
 
 SpaceX < !-- has achieved many things. It-- >  was the first private company to make a rocket that use liquid [[propellant]] that reach [[orbit]] ([[Falcon 1]] in 2008). SpaceX was also the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft ([[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] in 2010). SpaceX also first landed a [[:en:Multistage_rocket|multistage rocket]]  [[Astronaut|astronauts]] to the [[International Space Station]] ([[Crew Dragon Demo-2]] in 2020). SpaceX has launched Falcon 9 rockets over a hundred times. 
 
 SpaceX has put a [[network]] of Starlink satellites into space. It gives internet service. In 2020, the network (or satellite constellation) became the largest in (the world) or [[Earth orbit]]. 
 
 As of 2023's fourth quarter, there are [[astronaut]]s in space, that were taken there by SpaceX,

 == Launch vehicles, spacecraft, and rocket engines == 
 < !-- One of SpaceX's recent inventions are the Falcon rockets, which are built to be reusable. The standard in the rocket industry is to either leave these rockets in space or destroy them on their return to Earth, because sufficient technology wasn't available. SpaceX is recognized in the industry for creating that technology. This allows manufacturers to spend less money and materials creating materials, so the cost of space flight becomes significantly cheaper. SpaceX's current version of the rockets are the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]]. These rockets can be used by themselves, or they can be used as boosters, which are rockets that are attached to a larger one. An example of this is the Falcon Heavy, which is a rocket that uses three Falcon 9 boosters that are placed next to each other. Its first flight was on 6 February, 2018, when it used two Falcon 9 boosters that had previously flown. 
 
 SpaceX designs, builds, and tests its components inside SpaceX itself, not other companies. Because they don't need to pay other companies, SpaceX spends less money when they create their rockets. Some things SpaceX has made by itself, for example, the Merlin, Kestrel and Draco rocket engines used on the Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon spacecraft.

 === Current rockets === 
 {{Main|Falcon 9|Falcon Heavy}} 
 [[File:GRACE-FO Launch (NHQ201805220013).jpg|thumb|Falcon 9 on the GRACE-FO Mission]] 
 The Falcon 9 is a working, reusable two-part rocket that is launched using its nine Merlin engines in its first part and a special Merlin engine that was made for places where there is no air. It is powered by liquid oxygen and fuel made for rockets called RP-1. It can hold up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 pounds), and can also support SpaceX's Dragon vehicle. It is the first rocket able to get into orbit that can get its first part back to earth. 
 
 Falcon Heavy is another working, reuseable rocket similar to Falcon 9. However, the Falcon Heavy has a three-core system for its first part instead of the single-core design of the Falcon 9. With the three cores, the rocket's 1st part has 27 Merlin engines. The second part still only has 1 Merlin(Vacuum Version) engine. Currently, Falcon Heavy is the world's most powerful operating rocket and the 4th most powerful rocket in the world. This added power allows the rocket to be able to put 63,800 & nbsp;kg (140,660 lb) into low earth orbit, and 26,700 & nbsp;kg (58,860 lb) into [[geosynchronous orbit]]. 
 
 On February 6, 2018, the Falcon Heavy took off for the first time at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, from Pad 39A. 
 
 ==== Dragon 2 ==== 
 [[File:SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-1 Docks to Station (1).jpg|thumb|A Crew Dragon making a connection with the [[International Space Station]], during the Demo-1 Mission]] 
 {{main|SpaceX Dragon 2}} 
 The Dragon spacecraft is a cargo capsule that has taken equipment and supplies for the astronauts on the ISS; On other flights it has taken astronauts to ISS. The capsule is put on the Falcon 9 rocket (because the Dragon does not have big enough rockets to fly to space on its own) and flown into orbit. From orbit it separates from the [[booster]]s, then the capsule uses its own smaller rockets to get to the ISS. Then the capsule is filled up with old equipment, the results of scientific experiments, and garbage. It then reenters the Earth's atmosphere and parachutes into the ocean. The first flight of Dragon was in June 2010.  
 
 In May 2014, a [[prototype]] version of Dragon V2 was shown to the public. It could hold both cargo and astronauts. Another feature that this upgraded version of Dragon, to protect the life of crew in the event of a failure of Falcon 9, it was fitted with SuperDraco thrusters, which would push the capsule away from the rocket. < !-- Cargo Dragon, a variant of V2, will replace the current version of dragon that can only hold cargo.-- > 
 
 ==== No longer in use ==== 
 The Falcon 1 was SpaceX's first launch vehicle. It launched a total of 5 times, however only the 4th and final flights were successful. Falcon 1, as the name implies, ran on 1 Kestrel engine and could take a maximum of 670 kilograms to orbit. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20030726095110/http://www.spacex.com/ Web archive of Spacex.com], ''July 4, 2004'' < /ref > 
 
 Another early vehicle was the canceled Falcon 5, which has 5 Merlin engines on its first stage, and 2 Kestrel on its second stage. It was canceled in 2007 when it was removed from the company's user guide. < ref > [http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/falcon9.html SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Sheet]''Space Launch Report'' < /ref >

SpaceX is currently [[New product development|working on]] two further rocket engines: [[SuperDraco (rocket engine)|SuperDraco]] and [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]]. Merlin is a family of rocket engines made by SpaceX for use on their rockets. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse. Kestrel is a Liquid Oxygen/Rocket fuel pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. Both names for the [[Merlin (rocket engine)|Merlin]] and [[Kestrel (rocket engine)|Kestrel]] engines come from species of North American falcons: the kestrel and the merlin. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/35774-elon-musk-names-spacex|title=Tesla, Falcon 9, Heart of Gold: How Elon Musk Names His Inventions|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|website=Inverse|access-date=February 2, 2019}} < /ref >

 === Reusability === 
 [[File:Es & #039;hail-2 Mission (31180979107).jpg|thumb|Es & #039;hail-2 Mission first stage on the ''Of Course I Still Love You'' droneship]] 
 SpaceX's secondary mission is to reuse rockets, similarly to a plane. It first began to test reusability with a prototype called Grasshopper in 2012, as well as controlled soft landings into the water during Falcon 9 launches. In 2014, Grasshopper was replaced by F9R, which was an upgraded version of grasshopper included retractable landing gear and 3 engines, compared to Grasshopper's single engine. Falcon 9 was landed in December on a ground pad, followed by a landing on a drone ship the next year. Currently,{{when}} SpaceX has landed successfully 48 boosters. Dragon capsules, as well as farings, are also being reused. Reusing parts of rockets greatly reduce costs.
