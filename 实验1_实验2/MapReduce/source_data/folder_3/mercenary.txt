 Mercenaries are a very old phenomenon. They are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], and [[King David]] had a [[bodyguard]] of [[Cretan]] and [[Philistine]] mercenaries. They are also mentioned in the [[Iliad]], specifically the Myrmidons who fought in the [[Trojan War]] (12th century BC). 
 
 The [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] often used mercenaries. The so-called Free Companies in the [[Middle Ages]] were mercenary companies of rogue [[knight|knights]] and [[archery|archers]]. The Japanese ''ronin'' were mercenary [[samurai]].  
 
 For many years in the [[Middle Ages]], soldiers from [[Switzerland]] fought battles for whoever paid them. The [[popes]] would hire soldiers from Switzerland to fight for them.  The [[Swiss Guard]] is all that is left of Switzerland's mercenary tradition, but it is no longer a mercenary force because all its members are [[Catholic]], and they are prepared to fight not for their country but for their beliefs.  
 
 Soldiers of professional volunteer armies, like the [[US Army]], are not considered as mercenaries since they fight for their country and fatherland. Likewise, foreign volunteers in standing armies, such as [[French Foreign Legion]], are not considered as mercenaries since they are loyal to the country that they serve. However, various [[private military contractor]]s are considered as mercenaries.
