A '''cyst''' is a closed sac, having a distinct [[membrane]] and [[cell division|division]] compared with the nearby [[Biological tissue|tissue]].  
 
 It is a cluster of [[cells]] that has grouped together to form a sac however an aspect of a cyst is that the cells forming the  " shell "  of such a sac are distinctly abnormal when compared with all surrounding cells for that given location.  
 
 It may contain air, fluids, or semi-solid material. A collection of [[pus]] is called an [[abscess]], not a cyst. Once formed, sometimes a cyst may resolve on its own. When a cyst fails to resolve, it may need to be removed surgically, but that would depend upon its type and location.
