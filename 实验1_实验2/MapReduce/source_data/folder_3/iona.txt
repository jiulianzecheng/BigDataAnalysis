 '''Iona''' ({{lang-gd|Ì Chaluim Chille}}) is a small [[island]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] off the western [[:wikt:coast|coast]] of [[Scotland]]. When [[Columba]] arrived with twelve [[monk]]s in 563 he founded a great [[monastery]]. From that time Iona was known as a holy place. It was the center of [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Christianity]] for many centuries. Today it is a popular [[tourist]] attraction and a place for [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]]. Its modern [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name means  " Iona of (Saint) Columba "  (formerly anglicised  " Icolmkill " ). 
 
 == The village == 
 
 The main [[Village|settlement]], located at St. Ronan's Bay on the eastern side of the island, is called ''Baile Mòr''. < ref name=Maxwell22 > W. Maxwell, ''Iona and the Ionians'' (Glasgow, 1857), p. 22 < /ref >  It is known locally as  " The Village " . The [[primary school]], [[post office]], the island's two [[hotel]]s, the [[Bishop's House Iona|Bishop's House]] and the ruins of the Iona [[nunnery]] are here. The [[monastery|abbey]] and MacLeod Centre are a short walk to the north. < ref > Norbert Brockman, ''Encyclopedia of Sacred Places'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2011), p. 240 < /ref >  There are a number of offshore Islands nearby. Eilean Annraidh (island of storm) and Eilean Chalbha (calf island) are larger islands to the north. Rèidh Eilean and Stac MhicMhurchaidh Islands lay to the west of Iona. Eilean Mùsimul (mouse holm island) and [[Soa Island]] are to the south. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 ===Dál Riata=== 
   [[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|right|upright|{{center|The [[Book of Kells]] - Gospel of John}}]] 
 At the start, Iona was a part of the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[kingdom]] of [[Dál Riata]]. < ref > Alfred P. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), p. 116 < /ref >   The island was the site of a highly important [[monastery]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. According to tradition the monastery was founded in 563 by the monk Columba, also known as Colm Cille, who had been exiled from his native [[Ireland]]. < ref > Adomnan of Iona, ''The Life of St. Columba, Founder of Hy'' ed. William Reeves (University Press for the Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society, 1857), pp. 248-50 < /ref >  Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. < ref name=Adamnanxxxvii > Saint Adamnan, ''The Life of Saint Columba: Founder of Hy'', Vol. 6 (Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1874), p. xxxvii < /ref >  The monastery was very successful, and played a large part in the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] of the [[Picts]] to Christianity. < ref name=Adamnanxxxvii/ >  It also had an [[influence]] on the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. Many other monasteries were founded in Scotland and Iona became the center of a great monastic system. The [[scriptorium]] produced many very important [[:wikt:documents|documents]]. 
 
 === Christian center === 
 
 The monastery itself became the center of [[Celtic Christianity]]. Iona was a major supporter of the  " Celtic "  system for [[Celtic Christianity#Easter calculation|calculating the date of Easter]]. The [[missionaries]] and [[bishop]]s who came to Britain from Rome used a [[Catholicism|Roman]] calculation for the date of Easter. This issue was settled when they adopted the Roman system at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664. Pictland adopted the Roman system in the early [[8th century]]. Iona changed systems in 716, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian [[Bede]]. < ref > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin, 1990), p. 328 < /ref >  Iona's prominence was reduced over the next centuries as a result of [[Viking]] raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the [[Abbey of Kells]]. The [[Book of Kells]] was created on Iona about the year 800. < ref > Andrew Forbes; David Henley,  ''Pages from the Book of Kells'' (Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books, 2012), introduction < /ref >  At about the same time the island's high [[cross]]es were erected. They had a ring around the top part that became the symbol called a  " [[Celtic cross]] " . < ref > John Thomas Koch; Antone Minard, ''The Celts: History, Life, and Culture'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 300 < /ref >  The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba's relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned. 
 
 ===Kingdom of the Isles=== 
 
 As the Viking control of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. [[Amlaíb Cuarán]], King of Northumbria and Dublin, died in 981 while on Iona. < ref > ''Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society'', Volume 5 (Leeds: Edward Baines  &  Co., 1869–70), page. 212 < /ref >  Still, the island was sacked twice by his successors. On Christmas night 986 and again in 987. The ruling dynasty of Alba traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important religious icon of the [[New Kingdom|new kingdom]]. Many of its early kings are buried there. The kings of the Isles were at times vassals of the King of [[Norway]], High King of [[Ireland]], or the King of Scotland. By the 11th century they were nominally attached to the Kingdom of Norway, but in reality they were independent. < ref name=Power72 > Rosemary Power, ''The Story of Iona: An illustrated history and guide'' (London: Canterbury Press Norwich, 2013), p. 72 < /ref > 
 
 A [[convent]] for [[Benedictine]] nuns was established in about 1208, with [[Bethóc, Prioress of Iona|Bethóc]], daughter of [[Somerled]], as first prioress. The present Benedictine [[abbey]], [[Iona Abbey]], was built in about 1203. The monastery itself flourished until the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed. < ref > [http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/Isle_of_Iona Travel Scotland] < /ref > 
 
 ===Kingdom of Scotland=== 
 
 According to tradition, the first  " King of Scots "  was [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] (Cináed mac Ailpín). He founded the beginnings of what we know as Scotland in 843. < ref name=Ring351/ >  The [[Reilig Cemetery]] on Iona was from that time until the [[11th century]] the place where Scottish kings were buried. In total there are about forty-eight Scottish kings buried at Iona. In addition, eight kings of Norway and four kings of Ireland are buried on Iona. < ref name=Ring351 > ''International Dictionary of Historic Places'', Vol II: Northern Europe, eds. Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 1995), p. 351 < /ref > 
 
 Following the 1266 [[Treaty of Perth]] the Isles (Hebrides) were restored to Scottish rule. < ref > Hunter (2000) pp. 110–111 < /ref >  An Augustine nunnery survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and [[cloister]]. The nunnery continued to be active until the Reformation. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] nunnery in Scotland. 
 
 In the 19th century green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive.
