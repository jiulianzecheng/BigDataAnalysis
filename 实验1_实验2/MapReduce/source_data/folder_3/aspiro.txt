 On January 30, 2015, it was told that Aspiro had received a $56 million takeover bid from Project Panther Bidco Ltd. That was indirectly owned and controlled by entertainment mogul [[Jay-Z]]. Even though some minority shareholders opposed the takeover and argued that Project Panther undervalued the growth potential in their bid, the acquisition was announced finalized on March 13. That was after being accepted by over 90% of the shareholders. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.schibsted.com/en/ir/Regulatory--and-pressreleases/Regulatory-and-Press-Releases-Archive1/2015/Schibsted-ASA-SCH---Schibsted-accepts-an-offer-from-Project-Panther-Bidco-to-acquire-Aspiro/ |title=Schibsted ASA (SCH) - Schibsted accepts an offer from Project Panther Bidco to acquire Aspiro |publisher=Schibsted |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2015-03-14}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6480435/jay-zs-56-million-bid-for-aspiro-undervalues-company |title=Jay Z's $56 Million Bid for Aspiro Undervalues Company, Say Shareholders |publisher=Billboard |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2015-03-14}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/business/media/jay-z-buys-the-music-streaming-firm-aspiro.html?_r=0 |title=Jay Z Buys the Music Streaming Firm, Aspiro |publisher=NY Times |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2015-03-14}} < /ref >
