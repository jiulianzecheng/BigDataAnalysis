 '''Boston''' is the [[capital (city)|largest]] city of [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]]. It was [[wikt:found|found]]ed in [[1630]]. Boston is one of the [[old]]est, [[Wealthy|richest]] and most [[culture|culturally]] important cities in the United States. 
 
 == History == 
 Boston was founded on September 7, 1630, by [[Puritan]] [[colony|colonists]] from [[England]]. Boston's early [[Europe]]an [[settler]]s called the area ''Trimountaine'' (Three Mountains). They renamed the town for [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], [[England]], in [[Lincolnshire]] because many important  " [[Pilgrims|Pilgrim]] "  colonists came from there. 
 
 Most of Boston's early [[citizen]]s were Puritans. Shortly after Boston's settlement, Puritans created America's first [[public school]] and America's first [[university]], [[Harvard University]] (1636). Harvard is in the city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], which is across the [[Charles River]] from Boston. Until the [[1760s]], Boston was America's largest city. 
 
 During the early [[1770s]], the [[British Empire|British]] tried to control the [[thirteen colonies]] with [[tax]]es. This made people from Boston start the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Boston Massacre]], the [[Boston Tea Party]], and several early [[battle]]s happened in or near the city. It held its first town meeting in [[Faneuil Hall]] in [[1743]]. < ref > {{Citation

 Boston continued to grow and attract [[immigrant]]s from around the world. Many immigrants came from [[Ireland]], and gave Boston a very Irish [[culture]] that remains today. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was a member of an Irish-American family that lived in Boston. Many immigrants also came from [[Italy]], and lived in Boston's [[North End (Boston)|North End]], where Italian culture remains, with various Italian stores, restaurants, bakeries, and homes.

 == Geography == 
 
 Boston is located on the Shawmut [[Peninsula]]. The city covers {{convert|43.7|sqmi}}. [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is located east of the city. A much larger [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] surrounds Boston. 
 
 The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill, at {{convert|330|ft|m}} above sea level. The lowest point is at [[sea level]]. < ref > {{cite peakbagger 
 | pid = 6759 
 | name = Bellevue Hill, Massachusetts}} < /ref >  Boston is the only state capital in the [[contiguous United States]] with an ocean coastline. < ref > {{cite web|last=Univ. of Alabama geography dept.|title=US Map and State Capitals|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/usamapstcap.html|publisher=CSGNetwork.com|access-date=2012-07-06}} < /ref > 
 
 === Climate === 
 
 Boston has a [[continental climate]] with some ocean effects. Summers are normally warm to hot, rainy, and [[Humidity|humid]], while winters alternate between periods of cold [[rain]] and [[snow]], with cold [[temperature]]s. Spring and fall are usually mild. Existing wind patterns that blow offshore lower the effect of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/arts/film/weather.asp|title=Weather|year=2013|publisher=City of Boston|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041025044602/http://www.cityofboston.gov/arts/film/weather.asp|archive-date=25 October 2004|access-date=2013-02-13}} < /ref > 
 
 The hottest month is July, with an average temperature of {{cvt|73.4|°F|C}}. The coldest month is January, with an average of {{cvt|29.0|°F|C}}. Extremes have ranged from {{cvt|−18|°F|C}} on February 9, 1934, up to {{cvt|104|°F|C}} on July 4, 1911. 
 
 Boston's location on the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] moderates its temperature, but makes the city very likely to suffer from [[Nor'easter]] storm systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city [[average]]s {{convert|43.7|in|mm}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] a year, with {{convert|45.1|in|mm}} of snowfall per year. 
 
 == Towers == 
 The tallest towers in Boston are the [[Prudential Tower]] and the [[John Hancock Tower]]. 
 
 == Culture == 
 [[File:Boston Symphony Hall from the south.jpg|thumb|right|[[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]], home of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]]]] 
 Boston has a culture that is quite similar to [[New England]], such as a New England [[accent]] and foods that are mostly seafood, salt, and [[dairy]] products. [[Irish people|Irish]]-Americans are very important in Boston's [[politics]] and [[Religion|religious]] activities. Boston people also have a style of talking which is called Boston [[slang]]. < ref > {{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/05/25/my_word/ |title=Wicked good Bostonisms come, and mostly go |access-date=2009-05-02 |last=Baker |first=Billy |date=2008-05-25 |work=The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com}} < /ref > 
 
 It is often thought that Bostonians have a strong sense of culture. Perhaps this is because Boston is famous for being a very [[intelligence|intellectual]] place, with much of its culture coming from its [[university|universities]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/16/culture/North-America/Boston.html|title=Boston Culture|publisher=Columbus Travel Media Ltd.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821114118/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/16/culture/North-America/Boston.html|archive-date=21 August 2008|access-date=2010-02-02}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|author=Phelan, Joseph|date=November 2004|title=Boston Marathon|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2004-11.html|journal=Artcyclopedia}} < /ref >  The city has many complex theatres, including the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Boston Opera House, Citi Performing Arts Center, the Colonial Theater, and the Orpheum Theatre. The headquarters of [[Unitarian Universalism]] (UU) is located in Boston. The [[Christian Science]] movement has also made its home in the Boston area. 
 
 Boston has many historic places and Bostonians take pride in their city's history. The [[American Revolution]] began in Boston, and many of its leaders, such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and [[Paul Revere]] were from the city. Many of the sites from the Revolution are preserved in the city, including [[Faneuil Hall]], the Old State House, Park Street Church, and others. These form the  " [[Freedom Trail]] " , a walk that takes visitors past many historic places in the city. 
 
 == Boston today == 
 
 Boston is one of the [[United States]]' most important cities in education and health care. Boston and the towns around it contain many of the country's leading [[university|universities]]. [[Harvard]], [[MIT]], and [[Boston University]] are some of the most famous. 
 
 Professional [[sports]] are an important part of life in Boston. The [[Red Sox]] play [[baseball]] at [[Fenway Park]], the oldest stadium in [[Major League Baseball]] (1912). The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]], a [[basketball]] team, and the [[Boston Bruins|Bruins]], a [[hockey]] team, both play at the TD Garden. Boston's football team, the [[New England Patriots]], play in Foxborough, a town 22 miles south of the city.
