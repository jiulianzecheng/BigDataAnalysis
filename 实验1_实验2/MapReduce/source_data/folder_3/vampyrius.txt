 == Taxonomy == 
 The first specimen was discovered in 2008 by [[Jodi Rowley]] of the [[Australian Museum]] at [[Sydney]], Australia, and her student Le Thi Thuy Duong from [[Ho Chi Minh City University of Science]]. They found more in 2009 and 2010, and their team wrote the first paper about the species in the journal ''[[Zootaxa]]'' in 2010. They called it ''Rhacophorus vampyrus''. < ref name= " Stephen Luntz-2011 " > {{cite web|author= Stephen Luntz|title= Flying Vampire Frog Alert|date= March 2011|url= http://www.australasianscience.com.au/article/issue-march-2011/flying-vampire-frog-alert.html|work= Australasian Science|publisher= Control Publications|access-date= 20 November 2013|archive-date= 5 September 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140905214803/http://www.australasianscience.com.au/article/issue-march-2011/flying-vampire-frog-alert.html|url-status= dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " Aaron Smith-2011 " > {{cite web |author= Aaron Smith |title= Vampire flying frog discovered |date= 13 January 2011 |url= http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/vampire-flying-frog-discovered.htm |work= Australian Geographic |access-date= 20 November 2013 |archive-date= 14 December 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131214130216/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/vampire-flying-frog-discovered.htm |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  In 2012, scientists said this species should be called ''Rhacophorus calcaneus'' because of the shapes of the adult frogs' bodies; < ref name= " Kropachev-2022 " > {{Cite journal |last1=Kropachev |first1=Ivan I. |last2=Evsyunin |first2=Alexey A. |last3=Orlov |first3=Nikolai L. |last4=Nguyen |first4=Tao Thien |date=2022-03-22 |title=A New Species of  & lt;i & gt;Rhacophorus & lt;/i & gt; Genus (Anura: Rhacophoridae: Rhacophorinae) from Lang Son Province, Northern Vietnam |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.30906/1026-2296-2022-29-1-35-46 |journal=Russian Journal of Herpetology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=35–46 |doi=10.30906/1026-2296-2022-29-1-35-46 |s2cid=247612765 |issn=1026-2296}} < /ref >  however, in 2014 the species was reclassified as ''R. vampyrus'' through phylogenic research. < ref name= " Kropachev-2022 " / >  In 2021, a phylogenetic study found the species to fall far outside ''[[Rhacophorus]]'', and instead be the sister genus to ''[[Gracixalus]]'', so scientists gave it its own genus, ''Vampyrius''. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Vampyrius Dubois, Ohler, and Pyron, 2021 {{!}} Amphibian Species of the World |url=https://amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org/Amphibia/Anura/Rhacophoridae/Rhacophorinae/Vampyrius |access-date=2022-09-12 |website=amphibiansoftheworld.amnh.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Dubois |first1=Alain |last2=Ohler |first2=Annemarie |last3=Pyron |first3=R.

 ==Appearance== 
 ''R. vampyrus'' can grow to 4.5 & nbsp;cm. < ref name= " age "  / >  There is webbed skin between the toes, so it can glide between trees. < ref name= " Aaron Smith-2011 "  / > < ref name= " Kropachev-2022 "  / >  The skin of the frog's back is copper-brown in color with fainter, dark-brown [[Mottle|mottlin]] < nowiki/ > g.  The chest and belly are white, with a some black marks at the edge of the chest.  The upper surfaces of the arms and legs are copper brown with some dark brown marks.  The upper surfaces of the front and back feet are copper brown in color which fades to pinkish-cream or grey at the toes.  The lower surfaces of the front and back feet are a pale grey color.  The upper surface of webbing of the hands and feet is dark grey to black in color.  The lower surfaces of the species are grey.  ''R. vampyrus'' has pale yellow/gold [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] with a small rim of blue. < ref name= " Rowley "  / >  There is also a pointed piece sticking out at tibiotarsal articulation. < ref name= " Rowley "  / >  Tadpoles have black hooks on their mouths made of [[keratin]], which is the same thing fingernails are made of. < ref > {{Cite web |title=AmphibiaWeb - Rhacophorus vampyrus |url=https://amphibiaweb.org/species/7611 |access-date=2022-09-21 |website=amphibiaweb.org}} < /ref >  The tadpoles have long bodies and long tails.  They are dark brown in color, but sometimes the tail fins have no color. < ref name= " Nikolay A. Poyarkov Jr.-2013 "  / >  The tadpoles' eyes are black. The iris of the eye has gold specks. < ref name= " Nikolay A. Poyarkov Jr.-2013 "  / > 
 
 ==Home== 
 So far, people have only found ''R. vampyrus'' in southern Vietnam. < ref name= " iucn status 20 November 2021 "  / >  The first specimens were found in [[Bidoup Núi Bà National Park]], but scientists think they may also live in many parts of the [[Langbian Plateau]] (specifically in [[Chư Yang Sin National Park]] and [[Phước Bình National Park]]). < ref name=Rowley/ >  Later, scientists found them in Ta Dung Nature reserve, [[Dak Glong District]]. < ref name=Rowley2012/ >  The area that ''R. vampyrus'' extends is approximately 2,082 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup > . < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / >   The two places where ''R. vampyrus'' lives are far apart. The space in between has low elevation, which would make it hard for the frog to live there or travel. < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / >  Scientists think it used to live in more places, but [[habitat loss|human beings changed the places where it lives]]. < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / > < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / > 
 
 == Life cycle == 
 ''R. vampyrus'' lays its eggs in small, water-filled holes in trees during the rainy seasons, generally 0.3–1.2 m above the ground. It lays eggs mostly from July to May, producing [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] of 250 eggs or fewer. < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / >  The eggs are laid in foam nests on the wall of the tree hole, where nests are usually about 30–120 & nbsp;cm above the ground. The [[larva]]e fall into a hollow basin filled with water. < ref name= " IUCN Red List of Threatened Species-2014 "  / >  Tadpoles develop from the colorless eggs, but fertilized and unfertilized eggs are the same size. < ref name= " Nikolay A. Poyarkov Jr.-2013 "  / >  The eggs are white in color, with a thin transparent covering on the outside shell of each egg, with diameters between 0.70 and 1.29 & nbsp;mm. < ref name= " Nikolay A. Poyarkov Jr.-2013 "  / >  The tadpoles are long and dark-brown in color. Their tails are about three times as long as their bodies. Younger tadpoles are pale white or gray in color and they become darker over time. < ref name= " Nikolay A. Poyarkov Jr.-2013 "  / >   The tadpoles have dark hooks on their lower [[jaw]]s that look like fanged teeth.  This is the only frog or toad that has fangs like these.  There is also a hard arch on the upper jaw. The two hooks go forward. < ref name=Rowley/ >  The species is named after these  " fangs. " < ref name=geographic/ > [[File:Rhacophorus arboreus Eggｓ in Mount Ryu 2011-09-29.jpg|thumb|Example of Rhacophorus Frog Eggs]] 
 
 === Food === 
 The hooks on the tadpoles' mouths show that they [[oophagy|eat eggs and only eggs]]. The mother frog lays extra unfertilized eggs ([[trophic egg|to feed them]]). This is an example of advanced [[Parental investment|parental care]]. < ref name= " Rowley2012 " > {{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/00222933.2012.732622 |title= The strangest tadpole: The oophagous, tree-hole dwelling tadpole of ''Rhacophorus vampyrus'' (Anura: Rhacophoridae) from Vietnam |year= 2012 |last1= Rowley |first1= J.J.L. |last2= Tran |first2= D.T.A. |last3= Le |first3= D.T.T. |last4= Hoang |first4= H.D. |last5= Altig |first5= R. |journal= Journal of Natural History |volume= 46 |issue= 47–48 |pages= 2969–2978|s2cid= 84414631 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Nikolay A.
