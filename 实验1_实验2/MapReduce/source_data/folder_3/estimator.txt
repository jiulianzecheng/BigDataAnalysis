 In [[statistics]], an '''estimator''' is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given amount based on [[Sample (statistics)|observed data]]: thus the rule (the estimator), the amount that is being measured (the [[estimand]]) and its result (the estimate) are different. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Mosteller |first1=F. |last2=Tukey |first2=J.

 An estimator of a parameter  < math > \theta < /math >  is often written as  < math > \hat\theta < /math > . < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-04-26|title=List of Probability and Statistics Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/probability-statistics-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-12|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the parameter, then the estimator is called unbiased. Otherwise, it is called biased. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Taylor|first=Courtney|date=January 13, 2019|title=Unbiased and Biased Estimators|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-an-unbiased-estimator-3126502|access-date=2020-09-12|website=ThoughtCo|language=en}} < /ref >
