'''Cleanliness''' means that there is no [[Waste|dirt]], no [[dust]], no [[stain]]s, no bad [[odor|smells]]. The goals of cleanliness are [[health]], [[beauty]], no offensive [[odor]] and to avoid the spreading of [[Waste|dirt]] and [[contaminant]]s to oneself and others. In the case of glass objects such as [[window]]s or [[Windshield|windshields]], the purpose can also be [[transparency]]. [[Washing]] is one way of achieving cleanliness, usually with [[water]] < ref > {{Cite news|title=5 Things You Can Pressure Wash This Summer|url=https://www.beyondmaids.com/blog-detail?slug=5-Things-You-Can-Pressure-Wash-This-Summer}} < /ref >  and often some kind of [[soap]] or [[detergent]].

In industry, certain processes need conditions of exceptional cleanliness which are achieved by working in ''cleanrooms''. A very new idea is that ‘dirt’ may play a useful role in our [[immune system]]s. It is estimated that washing hands with soap and water could reduce diarrheal disease-associated deaths by up to 50%.
