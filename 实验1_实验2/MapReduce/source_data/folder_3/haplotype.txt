A '''haplotype''' is a term in [[genetics]]. It is short for [[haploid]] [[genotype]]. A haplotype is a collection of specific [[allele]]s (particular [[DNA]] sequences) in a cluster of tightly-[[linkage|linked]] [[genes]] on a [[chromosome]]. A cluster is usually inherited together. < ref > [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/Haplotypes.html Kimball's Biology Pages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213052054/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/Haplotypes.html |date=2015-02-13 }} (Creative Commons Attribution 3.0) < /ref >  Put simply, haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent. < ref name=SciTable > SciTable: haplotype / haplotypes [http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/haplotype-haplotypes-142] < /ref > 
 
 A second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) usually found together on a single [[chromatid]] (of a [[chromosome]] pair). So, finding a few [[alleles]] of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region. Such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common [[diseases]]. < ref > {{cite journal|author=The International HapMap Consortium|title=The International HapMap Project|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=426|pages=789–796|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v426/n6968/pdf/nature02168.pdf|doi=10.1038/nature02168|pmid=14685227|issue=6968|bibcode=2003Natur.426..789G|hdl=2027.42/62838|s2cid=4387110}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|author=The International HapMap Consortium|title=A haplotype map of the human genome|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=437|pages=1299–1320|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7063/pdf/nature04226.pdf|doi=10.1038/nature04226|pmid=16255080|issue=7063|pmc=1880871|bibcode=2005Natur.437.1299T}} < /ref > 
 
 Comparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines. It is done in genetic genealogy projects. < ref > [http://www.kerchner.com/haplotypevshaplogroup.htm Haplotype versus haplogroup]  & mdash; the difference between [[haplogroup]]  &  haplotype explained. < /ref >
