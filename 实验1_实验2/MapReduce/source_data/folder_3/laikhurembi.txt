 == History and Origin == 
 According to the [[Poireiton Khunthok]], Laikhurembi ({{lang-omp|Laikhulempi}}) was the chief queen of [[Thongaren]] ({{lang-omp|[[Thongalen]]}}). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. < ref > {{Cite web|title=WIDE-MOUTH English Definition and Meaning {{!}} Lexico.com|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/wide-mouth|access-date=2022-02-24|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|archive-date=2022-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220405095737/https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/wide-mouth|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of BOSOM|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bosom|access-date=2022-02-24|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >  They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of OBLIQUE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oblique|access-date=2022-02-24|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Scholars think this queen may have had [[Asian]] ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both ''Lai'' and ''Khu'' people in it. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n233/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=233}} < /ref >  Other scholars think  " Laikhurembi "  is just her title and not her name. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n234/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=234}} < /ref > 
 
 Laikhurembi ({{lang-omp|Laikhulempi}}) is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba ({{lang-omp|Lai Len Hum Choupa}}, [[:en:Shan language|Shan]]: Hoom Chao Hpa). In [[Meitei language]] ([[Manipuri language]]),  " Lai-ren "  means  " Chief of Lai " . < ref name= " :3 "  / >  In [[Meitei language]], the word [[#Etymology| " Lai "  has many meanings]]. 
 
 Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King [[Thongaren]] ({{lang-omp|[[Thongalen]]}}). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, [[Poireiton]], instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to ''[[Ancient Kangleipak|Tai Pang Pan]]'' and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n245/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=245}} < /ref >  However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King [[Thongalel]] sent his second wife [[Leinaotabi]] to accompany her brother in law [[Poireiton]] as a wife. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n246/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=246}} < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was ''Yungyatnaba'' (lit. ''erect and sharp'') which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her [[verdict|decision]] wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (''things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement''). < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Cult == 
 There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Laikhurembi in [[Uripok]] town in [[Imphal West|Imphal West district]] of [[Manipur]]. During the [[Lai Haraoba]] festival of Uripok, a [[carnival]] like atmosphere subdues the sacred traditional ritualistic ceremonies. During the noisy possession of the festive occasions, the [[maibi]]s dance in the gentle melodies of [[Pena (musical instrument)|pena]]. The [[maibi]]s became possessed by the spirits when the music stopped and they delivered [[oracle]]s. During this, the audiences listen to them very attentively. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismintradit0000chak/page/122/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi|title=Feminism in a Traditional Society: Women of the Manipur Valley - Manjusri Chaki-Sircar · 1984|pages=122|website=archive.org|year=1984|isbn=9780706919677|last1=Chaki-Sircar|first1=Manjusri}} < /ref >
