 '''Metapterygota''' is a clade of [[insects]]. It has both the order [[Odonata]] and the infraclass [[Neoptera]]. These two clades share similar looks by having both a [[larva]] form, and a [[imago]] form later on in its life, and having [[wings]]. Some though, do not have wings despite being capable of having them.
