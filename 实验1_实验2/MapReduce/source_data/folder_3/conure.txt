 A '''conure''' is a term in aviculture referring to 2 genuses of [[parrot]], ''[[Pyrrhura]]'' and ''[[Aratinga]]''. In [[Ornithology|science]], they are known as parakeets, because 'conure' is not a scientific name.

 Conures are in the [[Psittacidae]] family ([[neotropical parrot]]s). Their range goes from upper [[Brazil]] to southern [[Argentina]]. Conures are often kept as pets, and can be very friendly with people. 
 
 Conures are small birds. Many can grow up to 10 inches long, but some species can grow up to 20 inches long. Different types of conures have different colours, but the most common colour is green. Conures can eat many foods, including nuts, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Conures kept as pets must never be fed chocolate, avocado, salty foods, or caffeine.
