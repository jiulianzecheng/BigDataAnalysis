 When egg whites are beaten, some of the [[hydrogen bond]]s in the [[protein]] break. This makes the stiff texture needed for meringues. < /ref >  Some meringue recipes also ask for [[cream of tartar]] or [[cornstarch]] to hold it together. Meringues are often [[flavour]]ed with [[vanilla]] and a small amount of [[almond]] or [[coconut]] extract. They are light, airy and sweet. 
 
 == History == 
 
 People do not agree whether meringue was invented in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] town of [[Meiringen]] < ref > The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' states that the French word is of unknown origin. < /ref >  by an [[Italy|Italian]] chef named Gasparini. They are more sure that the name ''meringue'' was first seen in 1692, in a cookbook by Fran√ßois Massialot. < ref > Massialot, ''Nouvelle instruction pour les confitures, les liqueurs et les fruits'', (Paris, Charles de Sercy), 1692, noted by Muster (ref.). < /ref >  The word ''meringue'' was first used in English in 1706 in an English [[translation]] of Massialot's book. There are two English recipe books that have a recipe for meringue, but it is called  " white biskit bread "  in the book of recipes started in 1604 by Lady Elinor Fettiplace, < ref > John Spurling produced a three-volume, typescript transcription of Lady Fettiplace‚Äôs book (Bristol:Stuart Press) 1994, noted by Muster (ref.). < /ref >  or called  " pets "  in the manuscript of collected recipes written by Lady Rachel Fane. < ref > Cited in Michael Barry, ''Old English Recipes'', (Jarrod) 1995:64f from the manuscript archived at the Centre for Kentish Studies, Maidstone, Kent. < /ref > 
 
 ==Type of meringue == 
 There are many types of meringue. The usual type is dry and crisp. 
 
 One type is the half-cooked type on [[queen of puddings]], [[key lime pie]], and [[lemon meringue pie]]. There are also uncooked meringues, and other types of meringues cooked in different ways.
