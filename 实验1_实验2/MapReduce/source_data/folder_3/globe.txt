 A '''globe''' is a [[scale model]] with the shape of a [[sphere]]. Globes can be scale models of the [[Earth]] (''terrestrial globes'') or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the [[celestial sphere]] (''celestial globes''). The English word  " globe "  comes from the {{Lang-la|globus}}, meaning [[round]] mass or [[sphere]].  
 
 Most globes are [[map]]s of the [[Earth]]. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat [[map projection]] < nowiki/ > s. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show [[landscape]] like [[mountain]]s and [[river]]s. Some globes are [[star chart]] < nowiki/ > s and some are maps of distant worlds. 
 
 '''Global''' as an [[adjective]] is used to mean the entire [[world]] rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like [[computer]]s to mean dealing with a whole larger [[system]], rather than its individual little parts.

 That the Earth is a [[sphere]] was established by [[Hipparchus|Hellenistic astronomy]] in the 3rd century [[BC]]. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the [[Middle Ages]] in existence. < ref name= " Encarta " > Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2003. < /ref >  The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Crates of Mallus]] made in the middle of the 2nd [[century]] BC. < ref name= " :0 " > [http://www.1worldglobes.com/earthglobe.htm Earth Globe] < /ref >  The Greek [[geographer]] [[Strabo]] wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the [[Roman Empire]]. 
 
 A celestial globe from [[Classical Antiquity]] is in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], [[Italy]]. The globe is part of a [[sculpture]] – the globe is held up by a [[statue]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] from [[Greek mythology]]. The [[ancient Romans]] made the globe and statue in the 2nd [[century]] [[AD]]. They may have copied the sculpture from [[Hellenistic art]] (art of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] type) from the [[Hellenistic period]] (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ''[[Farnese Atlas]]''. < ref name= " Encarta "  / > 
 
 Early globes of the Earth that show all of the [[Old World]] were constructed in the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by [[Muslim]] [[geography|geographers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]] working under the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]], [[al-Ma'mun]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Meri| first = Josef W.| title = Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia| year = 2006| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC & pg=PA138| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-96690-0| pages = 138–139 }} < /ref > < ref > {{citation|first=Richard|last=Covington|title=The Third Dimension|journal=Saudi Aramco World, May-June 2007|year=2007|pages=17–21|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|accessdate=2008-07-06|archive-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225234826/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Another example was the globe introduced to [[Beijing]] by the Persian astronomer, [[Jamal ad-Din (astronomer)|Jamal ad-Din]], in 1267. < ref > {{citation|title=The Image of the Spherical Earth|author=David Woodward|journal=[[Perspecta (journal)|Perspecta]]|volume=25|year=1989|pages=3–15 [9]|publisher=MIT Press|doi=10.2307/1567135|jstor=1567135|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1567135|accessdate=2010-02-22}} < /ref > [[File:Van_Deuren_Astronomer.jpg|thumb|Olivier van Deuren: ''A Young Astronomer'']] 
 
 [[Martin Behaim]] designed a globe in 1492, in [[Nuremberg]], [[Bavaria]] ([[Germany]]). [[Georg Glockendon]] was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. < ref name= " Ravenstein " >  Ravenstein, Ernst G. 1908.

George Philip  &  Son. < /ref >  This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. < ref name= " Encarta "  / >  A copy of the globe showing America was made by [[Martin Waldseemueller]] in 1507. Another early globe, the [[Hunt-Lenox Globe]], ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase  " [[Here be dragons]] " . Another  " remarkably modern-looking "  globe of the Earth was made in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) by [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] at his [[Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din|Constantinople Observatory]] during the 1570s. < ref name= " Soucek " > {{citation|first=Svat|last=Soucek|title=Piri Reis and Ottoman Discovery of the Great Discoveries|journal=Studia Islamica|volume=79|year=1994|issue=79|pages=121–142 [123  &  134–6]|doi=10.2307/1595839|jstor=1595839}} < /ref >

 Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin [[Gore (segment)|gores]] (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]]. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere.  
 
 From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point. 
 
 A globe that represents the Earth is usually mounted at a 23.5° angle on [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s.  This mounting represents the [[axial tilt]] of the spinning planet, in relation to the [[Sun]].  This makes it easy to visualize how [[day]]s and [[season]]s change.
