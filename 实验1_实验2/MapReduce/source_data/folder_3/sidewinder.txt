 The '''Sidewinder rattlesnake''' (''Crotalus cerastes''), also known as the  " Horned Rattlesnake " , is a species of [[Venom (poison)|venomous]] [[pit viper]]. There are three subspecies. It is called a sidewinder because it uses [[sidewinding]] to move across sand. 
 
 == Description== 
 The Sidewinder rattlesnake is a small species of [[snake]], with adults measuring to about {{convert|43|to|76|cm|abbr=off}} long. The females are larger than the males, which is unusual for most snakes. The color of this snake is usually cream or yellowish-brown, and the belly is white colored. 
 
 == Where it lives== 
 In the southwestern [[United States of America]] it can be found in [[desert]] regions of eastern [[California]], southern [[Nevada]], southwestern [[Utah]] and western [[Arizona]]. In northwestern [[Mexico]], it can be found in western [[Sonora]] and eastern [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]]. 
 
 == Behavior== 
 The Sidewinder is [[nocturnal]] in hot months and [[diurnal]] in cooler months. The Sidewinder uses its tail to attract [[lizard]]s which it eats, but when it becomes an adult it stops eating lizards and starts eating desert [[rodent]]s.   
 
 == Reproduction== 
 A female Sidewinder Rattlesnake gives birth to around 5 to 18 young at a time. For 7–10 days the young stay with their mother in a burrow, they then shed for the first time and then leave the burrow. Sidewinders mature at the age of 2 or 3, then mate in April and May and sometimes in the [[Autumn|fall]]. The female then has its 5-18 babies in the late [[summer]]. These babies are born 6-8 inches long. Males live a little bit longer than females, males live to about 13 years old and females about 11 years old.  
 
 == Subspecies== 
 There are three [[subspecies]]: < ref name= " ITIS " > {{ITIS |ID=174311 |taxon=''Crotalus cerastes'' |accessdate=5 February 2007}} < /ref > 
 * [[Mojave Desert Sidewinder]], ''C. c. cerastes'' 
 * [[Sonoran Desert Sidewinder]], ''C. c. cercobombus'' 
 * [[Colorado Desert Sidewinder]], ''C. c. laterorepens''
