 '''Malabo''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It is on the northern coast of [[Bioko Island]]. The number of people living there has grown quickly over the past ten years to about 100,000. 
 
 Notable [[building]]s in Malabo include [[Malabo Cathedral]] and the [[Malabo Court Building]].  The city is served by [[Malabo International Airport]], while [[ferry|ferries]] sail from its [[Harbor|port]] to [[Douala]] and [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The city was first [[:wikt:found|founded]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[1827]]. They paid [[Spain]] for use of the [[island]] during [[colony|colonial]] times. The British named the city '''Port Clarence'''. It was used as a [[Royal Navy|naval station]] help stop the [[slave trade]]. Many newly freed slaves [[Settler|settled]] there before the creation of [[Sierra Leone]] as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later moved to Sierra Leone. 
 
 When the island returned to Spanish control, Malabo was renamed '''Santa Isabel'''. It replaced the town of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] as the capital of the country in [[1969]]. The city was renamed Malabo in [[1973]] because [[President]] [[Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema]] wanted to replace [[Europe]]an place names with  " authentic "  [[Africa]]n ones.
