 '''Girth''' is the [[circumference]] of a [[Cylinder|cylindrical]] object, such as a [[Trunk (botany)|tree trunk]]. 
 
 '''Girth''' is sometimes used by postal services and delivery companies as basis for pricing. For example, (for at least one delivery company), if one has a box to ship, it has three sides: length (the longest side) and height and width. The girth in this case is 2 * (height + width).
