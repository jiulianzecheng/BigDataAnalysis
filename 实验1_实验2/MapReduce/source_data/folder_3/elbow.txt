 The '''elbow''' is a [[hinge-joint]] between the [[bone]]s of the upper and lower [[arm]]. It joins the [[humerus]] of the upper arm and the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] of the [[forearm]] together. Everyone has 2 elbows. It allows the lower arm to be extended or retracted (moved in). The elbow also allows the arm to turn. It moves by using three [[ligament]]s: the ''anterior, posterior, ulnar collateral'' and ''radial collateral'' ligaments.
