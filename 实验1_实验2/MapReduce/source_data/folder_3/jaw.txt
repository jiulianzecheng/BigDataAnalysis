 The '''jaw''' is the part of an animal's body that it uses to grab and chew food.  In humans, the jaws are two [[bone]]s in the [[mouth]], the mandible (lower jaw) and maxilla (upper jaw), that let the [[teeth]] move up and down in order to [[chew]]. The mandible is joined to the [[skull]]. 
 
 However, in [[insects]], the jaws may open left and right instead, and they are usually outside the mouth instead of inside it. [[Sea urchin]]s have five jaws with one tooth each. < ref name= " PinkTeeth " > {{cite news|publisher=Phys.org|title=These pink sea urchins have teeth that sharpen themselves|date=September 19, 2019|accessdate=May 27, 2020|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-09-pink-sea-urchins-teeth-sharpen.html|author=Cell Press}} < /ref > < ref name= " Espinosa " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.matt.2019.08.015|journal=Matter|title=In situ Wear Study Reveals Role of Microstructure on Self-Sharpening Mechanism in Sea Urchin Teeth|url=https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(19)30173-0|author1=Horatio D.

 A body part is called a jaw based on what it does, not what it is made of or how it grows.  In different animals, it can be made of different kinds of cells and [[tissue]].  In the [[embryo]] < nowiki/ > s of different animals, it may come from different original places.  Even within [[arthropods]], the group that contains insects and lobsters and trilobites and spiders, the jaws of different animals may grow from different original tissues, even though they look similar in adult animals.  A pair of appendages that become jaws in one species may become [[antenna]]e in a different species or [[leg]]s in another. < ref name= " NatureArth " > {{cite journal|title=Origin of the arthropod mandible|journal=Nature|accessdate=May 27, 2020|date=April 4, 1996|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/380395a0.pdf?proof=true|page=395|volume=380|author1=Aleksandar Popadlc|author2=Douglas Rusch|author3= Michael Peterson|author4=Bryan T.

 [[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s are born before their jaws have grown enough for them to drink their mothers' milk the way other baby [[mammal]]s do.  Scientists from Kings' College London found that opossums and other marsupials use tissue from their inner ear to make a temporary jaw so they can feed and grow.  They found that baby [[echidna]]s also form a temporary jaw using the bones of their inner ear so they can feed and grow. < ref name= " Ev " > {{cite press release|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/e-haj063020.php|title=Hints at jaw evolution found in marsupials and monotremes |date=June 30, 2020|accessdate=July 1, 2020|author=eLife|publisher=Eurekalert.org}} < /ref > < ref name= " Anthwal " > {{cite journal|author1=Neal Anthwal|title=Transient role of the middle ear as a lower jaw support across mammals|date=June 30, 2020|journal=eLife|author2= Jane Catherine Fenelon|author3=Stephen D Johnston|author4=Marilyn B Renfree|author5=Abigail S Tucker|volume=9 |doi=10.7554/eLife.57860 |pmid=32600529 |pmc=7363448 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >
