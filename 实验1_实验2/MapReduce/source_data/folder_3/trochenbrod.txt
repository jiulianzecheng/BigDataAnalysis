'''Trochenbrod''' ({{lang-ru|Трохимброд|translit=Trohimbrod}}; {{lang-uk|Трохимбрід|translit=Trochymbrid}}) was a Jewish [[shtetl]] (village) with an area 1,728 acres once in what is now western [[Ukraine]], about 30 kilometers northeast of [[Lutsk]]. It used to be a part of [[Poland]]. It was also known as '''Sofievka''' or '''Zofiówka''' in Polish, named after Sofia, a Russian princess who donated land for the Jewish settlement. < ref name=Barco > Barco, Eleazar.

 ==History== 
 Trochenbrod was founded in 1835, at first a farming colony which grew into a small town. The population grew from around 1,200 (235 families) in 1889 to 1,580 in 1897. < ref name=Barco / > 
 
 During the [[Polish-Soviet War]], the town was captured by Poland. By 1938 the town's population, which was only Jewish, had grown to at least 3,000. < ref name=Barco / >   Most of the people worked in farming, dairy farming, or [[tanning]].  
 
 There were seven [[synagogue]]s in Trochenbrod. In 1940, the town, along with the rest of [[Western Ukraine]], became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]). The [[rabbi]] at this time was Rabbi Gershon Weissmann. The Communists exiled him to [[Siberia]] after accusing him of being involved in underground salt trading. < ref name=Barco / > 
 
 When the [[Nazi]]s later occupied Ukraine, they created a [[ghetto]] at Trochenbrod, bringing in Jews from nearby villages and towns. The Jews in the Trochenbrod ghetto were killed by the Nazis in August and September 1942. < ref name=Katchanovski > Katchanovski, Ivan.[http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/1007/opin1.php/ ''Everything Is Illuminated'', Not!] in  ''The Prague Post'' (October 7, 2004) < /ref >  Most of the Jews of Trochenbrod as well as of the neighbouring village [[Lozisht]] were killed, as were the other Jews of [[Volhynia]]. < ref name=Barco / >  The local Ukrainian police force helped to round up the Jews. < ref name=Katchanovski / >  Fewer than 200 Jews from the Trochenbrod ghetto and nearby areas lived through this killing. < ref name=Katchanovski / >  The village itself was burned. < ref name=Barco / >  Now only fields and a forest can be found there. 
 
 A few of the people escaped the execution and destruction. At the end of the war, the number of people left was between 33 < ref name=Barco / >  and 40; < ref name=Katchanovski / >  most were found in the area near Lutzk. < ref name=Barco / > 
 
 ==Trochenbrod in fiction== 
 A fictional version of the shtetl, ''Trachimbrod'', was featured in the 2002 novel ''[[Everything Is Illuminated]]'' by [[Jonathan Safran Foer]] as well as in the [[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|2005 film]] based on the novel. 
 
 Safran Foer's story describes fictional events in the village between 1791, the year in which the shtetl was first named, and 1941, when it was destroyed in the war. The main character of the book (who goes by the author's name and also by the name  " The Hero " ) comes to Ukraine to look for a woman named Augustine, who saved his grandfather in the war.
