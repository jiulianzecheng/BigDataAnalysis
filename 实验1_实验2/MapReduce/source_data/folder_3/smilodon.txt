 '''''Smilodon''''' was a genus of [[saber-toothed cat]]. There were three species. < ref name= " Turner " > Turner A. 1997. ''The big cats and their fossil relatives''. Columbia N.Y.{{ISBN|0-231-10229-1}} < /ref >  ''Smilodon gracilis'' (or ''S. fragilis'') was the ancestral, smaller, species (2.5 to 0.5 million years ago). 
 
 ''Smilodon populator'' (1 mya to 10 kya) was a large, heavy species from eastern [[South America]]. It was 1.2 m high at the shoulder, 2.1 m (83 & nbsp;in) long on average. With an estimated weight of 220 to 400 & nbsp;kg, it was among the heaviest known felids. < ref name= " Body " > Christiansen P. and Harris J.M. 2005. Body size of ''Smilodon'' (Mammalia: Felidae). ''J. Morphology'' '''266''', 369–384. [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112126332/PDFSTART online]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Its upper canines reached 28 & nbsp;cm (11 & nbsp;in) and protruded up to 17 & nbsp;cm (6.7 & nbsp;in) out of the upper jaw. 
 
 ''Smilodon fatalis'' (or ''S. californicus''; 1.6 mya to 10,000 years ago) was the famous cat known from the Rancho [[La Brea tar pits]] in [[Los Angeles]]. < ref > The Rancho La Brea tar pits are in Hancock Park in the heart of Los Angeles. The specimens are displayed in the George C. Page Museum in the park. < /ref >  The tar, a bit like [[asphalt]], has yielded about a million bones of late [[Pleistocene]] [[mammal]]s, of which 162,000 bones are from ''Smilodon'', representing perhaps 1200 individuals. The cat was about the size of a female lion, but weighed more, perhaps 200 & nbsp;kg. < ref > African female lions average weight: 120kg. < /ref >  It was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders. 
 
 ==Teeth and jaws==

 ''Smilodon'' is most famous for its relatively long [[canine tooth|canines]], which are the longest  found in the saber-toothed cats, at about {{Convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} long in the largest species ''Smilodon populator''. < ref name= " Turner " / >  Those of ''S. fatalis'' reached their full size in 18 months at a growth rate of 7 & nbsp;mm/month. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Feranec, R. C. |year=2004 |title=Isotopic evidence of saber-tooth development, growth rate, and diet from the adult canine of ''Smilodon fatalis'' from Rancho La Brea |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=206|issue=3–4 |pages=303–310 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2004.01.009|bibcode=2004PPP...206..303F }} < /ref >  These canine teeth were slender and had fine serrations. < ref name=Slater > Slater, G.J.  &  Valkenburgh B.V. 2008. Long in the tooth: evolution of sabertooth cat cranial shape. ''Paleobiology'' '''34''' (3): 403–419. < /ref >  They were fragile and could not have bitten into bone. Therefore, the cats did not use their long teeth to take down prey. Only when their prey was subdued did they use their teeth. < ref name=forelimbs > Meachen-Samuels, J.A.  &  Van Valkenburgh B. 2010. Radiographs reveal exceptional forelimb strength in the sabertooth cat, ''Smilodon fatalis''.

 == Method of attack == 
 The front limbs on these cats were longer and stronger than modern cats, and from that, and its teeth, its method of attack must have been different. An educated guess would be: they were ambush predators, which clung on round the neck of their prey, and slashed at the underside of the throat. < ref name= " Turner " / >  This contrasts with the method of the modern [[lion]], which brings down its prey by weight of numbers, and clamps its jaws over the prey's nose and mouth. The prey dies of [[suffocation]]. 
 
 ''Smilodon'' & apos;s gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, < ref > {{cite journal|author=Andersson K; Norman D.  &  Werdelin L. 2011 |title=Sabretoothed carnivores and the killing of large prey |journal=PLOS ONE |year=2011 |volume=6|issue=10|page=e24971|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024971|pmid=22039403 |pmc=3198467 |bibcode=2011PLoSO...624971A |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Martin L.D. 1980 |title=Functional morphology and the evolution of cats |journal=Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=141–54 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1286 & context=tnas & sei-redir=1}} < /ref >  This makes the gape wide enough to allow ''Smilodon'' to slash the throats of their victims without closing their jaws in a bite. 
 
 ''Smilodon'''s [[niche]] was closer to a [[leopard]]'s, which is also an ambush predator. They both need cover to get close to prey. 
 ''Smilodon'' had relatively short legs and a short, bobbed tail. Its front [[leg]]s were especially powerful. Its body was adapted for springing onto prey, but it was not a very fast runner. 
 
 == Fauna and flora in the Smilodon's environment == 
 [[File:Smilodon fatalis life-restoration '08.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Smilodon fatalis'' shown to scale to show its build]] 
 
 During the last [[ice age]], there were many possible prey species from the La Brea location: [[Columbian mammoth|mammoth]]s, [[Bison antiquus|bison]], [[Western horse|horse]], [[Titanotylopus|camel]], [[Paramylodon|ground sloth]], [[pronghorn]], [[tapir]], [[deer]],([[elk]] and others). Most of these were extinct by 5 to 10,000 years ago. The pressures of a major [[climate change]] and human [[hunting]] were thought to be the main causes. 
   
 There was more plant cover at that time. [[Juniper]], [[oak]]s, [[ragweed]]s, [[cedar]]s, [[redwood]]s, [[sagebrush]], [[sycamore]], [[thistle]] and [[walnut]] grew in the environs. ''Smilodon'' survived so long as its prey had vegetation.
