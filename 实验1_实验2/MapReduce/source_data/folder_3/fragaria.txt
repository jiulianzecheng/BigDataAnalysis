 '''''{{lang|la|Fragaria}}''''' is the [[Latin]] name [[scientific name|used in science]] for the [[genus]] of about 20 [[species]] of '''strawberries''', [[plants]] in the [[rosaceae|rose family]] that grow small [[sweet (taste)|sweet]] red [[fruit]]. The most well-known and most grown of these species is the [[strawberry]] ''Fragaria''{{nbsp}}× ananassa''. The other species are informally known as the '''wild{{nbsp}}strawberries'''. 
 
 ==Name== 
 ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:en:Fragaria|Fragaria]]}}'' is a [[Latin]] word for the group of  " [[strawberry]]-like "  [[plant]]s, formed by putting ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:en:fragrum|fragrum]]}}'' ( " [[strawberry]] " ) together with the [[suffix|ending]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:en:-aria|-aria]]}}'', which here means something close to the [[English language|English]]  " [[:wikt:en:-like|-like]] " . 
 
 ==History== 
 People have eaten different kinds of wild strawberries for thousands of years. In [[Europe]], people usually grew the [[woodland strawberry]]. [[Dutch people]] learned how to eat them through most of the [[year]] by planting their seeds at different times, letting them [[harvest]] for nine [[month]]s of the year. The [[Alpine strawberry]] became popular around the 1650s because it was a little bigger and could grow in places with less strong [[sunlight]], like the [[British Isles|British islands]] in the late [[autumn|fall]]. Today's bigger [[strawberry| " garden "  strawberry]] was first made around [[Brest (France)|Brest]] in [[Brittany]] (northwest [[France]]) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the [[Virginia strawberry]] from eastern [[North America]] to the [[Europe]]an [[Hautbois]] and the [[Chilean strawberry]] from western [[South America]]. < ref > {{citation |last=Welsh |first=Martin |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802231801/http://www.nvsuk.org.uk/growing_show_vegetables_1/strawberry.php |contribution=Strawberries |url=http://www.nvsuk.org.uk |title=''Official website'' |publisher=National Vegetable Society |location=Aylesford |date=2006 }}. < /ref >

 [[File:Camarosa strawberry.jpg|thumb|left|A strawberry (''Camarosa'')]] 
 The real [[fruit]] of the strawberries are the [[achene]]s, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/~kenr/grocery/achenes.html |title=achenes |publisher=Inhs.uiuc.edu |accessdate=2012-01-19 |archive-date=2012-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826132101/http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/~kenr/grocery/achenes.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  which people usually think of as the little [[seed]]s around the outside of the larger red  " fruit " . What people think is the  " fruit "  is really the [[swelling|swollen]] [[stem]]s between these fruit. This kind of fruit, where different [[ovary|ovaries]] grow into a single larger fruit, is called an  " [[aggregate fruit]] " . < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/~kenr/grocery/Aggfrts.html |title=Aggretage Fruits |publisher=Inhs.uiuc.edu |accessdate=2012-01-19 |archive-date=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123053311/http://www.inhs.uiuc.edu/~kenr/grocery/Aggfrts.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1997/mayjun/dept4.htm |title=The Strawberry: A Multiple Fruit |publisher=Carnegiemuseums.org |accessdate=2012-01-19 |archive-date=2011-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228231648/http://www.carnegiemuseums.org/cmag/bk_issue/1997/mayjun/dept4.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
