 The '''blues''' is a form of [[music]] that started in the [[United States]] during the start of the [[20th century]]. It was started by former African [[slavery|slaves]] from [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], praise songs, and [[chant]]s. The first blues songs were called [[Delta blues]]. These songs came from the area near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]]. Many African Americans were taken to the north esp. in the northwest of the United States, to find work. They took the blues with them and developed it into new styles. The most important is the Chicago Blues, which is played with electric amplified instruments. But other cities and states have their own form of Blues developed from the Delta Blues (f. e. Texas Blues, West Coast Blues and others). 
 
 == Chord pattern == 
 
 Blues  is based on a simple pattern. ''“Blues is easy to play, but hard to feel”''-[[Jimi Hendrix]]. A common form for the blues is a repeating 12 bar form (each bar has 4 beats). This is put together as 3 phrases or sections, each being 4 bars long. The basic blues only needs 3 [[chord]]s, one based on the first note of the [[scale (music)|scale]] - the [[tonic]] chord, one based on the fourth note of the scale - the [[subdominant]] chord, and one based on the fifth note of the scale - the [[dominant]] chord. The first section or phrase of 4 bars only uses the tonic chord. A common  variation is to use the subdominant chord in the second bar. The second phrase has 2 bars (8 beats) of subdominant chord then 2 bars of tonic chord. The third phrase has 1 bar (4 beats) of dominant chord, 1 bar of subdominant chord and finishes with 2 bars of tonic chord. 
 
 In a scale based on the note C (C is the 1st or tonic, F is the 4th or subdominant, and G is the 5th or dominant), the chord pattern of a 12 bar blues would be like this: 
 
 C C C C |C C C C or F F F F |C C C C |C C C C | < br / > 
 F F F F |F F F F |C C C C |C C C C | < br / > 
 G G G G |F F F F |C C C C |C C C C | 
 
 == Melodic pattern == 
 
 The melody of the simplest blues [[scale (music)|scales]] are based on the [[Pentatonic scale|minor pentatonic scale]] for example C Eflat G A Bflat C, with extra notes (called  " blue notes " ) added like this C Eflat G flat G A Bflat C. Blue notes do not normally fit a scale, but they give the music a special feeling.

 == Lyric pattern == 
 
 The lyrics (words) are usually about life, more specifically, the bad things in life. They are simple blues songs that are also based around the form of 3 phrases. The first phrase is set over the first 4 bars of music. The second phrase words are a repetition of the first phrase, this always happens and emphasises the message. The third phrase completes the  " story "  and [[rhyme]]s (ends with the same sound) as the first line. This verse from  [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s '' " Crossroad Blues " '' shows how these phrases work in a song: 
 
 ''I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees < br / > '' 
 ''I went to the crossroads, fell down on my knees < br / > '' 
 ''Asked the Lord above, have mercy now, save poor Bob if you please'' 
 
 == Blues influenced music == 
 The blues have made a difference in newer American and Western [[popular music]], such as [[jazz]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[hip-hop]], and [[country music]], as well as common [[pop song]]s.
