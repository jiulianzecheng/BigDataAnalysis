The name ''Heimskringla'' was first used in the 17th century, it comes from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (''kringla heimsins'' - ''the circle of the world''). 
 
 Heimskringla is a collection of tales about the Norwegian kings, beginning with the legendary Swedish dynasty of the Ynglingas, followed by accounts of historical Norwegian rulers from [[Harald I of Norway|Harald Fairhair]] of the [[9th century]] up to [[1177]].
