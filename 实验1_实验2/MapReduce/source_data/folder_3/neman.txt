 '''Neman''' or '''Niemen''' or '''Nemunas''' is a major [[Eastern Europe]]an [[river]].  It starts in [[Belarus]] and flows through [[Lithuania]] before draining into the [[Curonian Lagoon]] and then into the [[Baltic Sea]] at [[Klaipėda]]. It is the northern border between Lithuania and [[Russia]]'s [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] in its lower reaches.  It also very briefly forms part of the border between Lithuania and Belarus.  It is the largest river in Lithuania and the 3rd largest in Belarus. People are able to travel on it for most of its 900-kilometer length. Its depth varies from one meter to five meters.
