 The '''placoderms''' (''Placodermi'': [[Greek language|Greek]] = ''plated skin'') were a [[Class (biology)|class]] of armoured [[prehistoric]] [[fish]], which lived from the mid [[Silurian]] to the end of the [[Devonian]] period. Their [[head]] and [[thorax]] were covered by armoured plates; the rest of the body was [[scale (zoology)|scaled]] or naked, depending on the species. Placoderms were among the first [[jaw]]ed fish, the [[Gnathostomata]]. A 380 million year old fossil of one species is the oldest-known example of live birth. < ref name= " BBC " > {{cite web | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7424281.stm | title =  Fossil reveals oldest live birth | date = 28 May 2008 |accessdate = 30 May 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 The placoderms were hugely successful in the Devonian period, which is sometimes called the 'Age of Fish'. In the Upper Devonian, a series of [[List of extinction events|extinction events]] devastated the [[Ocean|marine]] [[fauna]]. As the placoderms were [[predator]]s, this caused a swift decline in their numbers, and the class was entirely extinct by the end of the Devonian. < ref name= " Long " > Long J.A. 1995.

 The main source of placoderm fossils is the [[Old Red Sandstone]] continent. This, in the Devonian, was a united [[North America]] and western [[Europe]] and the [[continental shelf]] areas around it. Fossils from these strata in [[Scotland]] were collected since the 18th century, and [[Louis Agassiz]] wrote the first survey of fossil fish. < ref > Agassiz L. 1833–1843. ''Recherches sur les poissons fossiles'', 5 vols. < /ref >  A century later, Eric Stensiö showed that placoderms were genuine jawed fish. < ref > Stensiö E.A. 1963.

 Remarkable fossils have more recently been found in the Gogo formation of northern [[Western Australia]]. This is a former Upper Devonian [[reef]] system, where well-preserved fossils of 25 species have been found. < ref name= " Long " / >  The relationship between the placoderm and other jawed fish is still not clear. Most placoderms were [[benthic]] predators, near the bottom of the water column. The largest types, such as ''Dunkleosteus'' and ''Gorgonichthys'' were 6 metre-long top predators in the middle and upper [[pelagic zone]]s.
