 A '''hammer''' is a [[tool]] for putting [[nail]]s into objects such as [[wood]]. It has a long handle, and a tip with a flat end for hitting nails. The most common type of hammer (sometimes called a ''claw hammer'') has a curved end (on the other side of the hitting end) for pulling nails out. 
 
 A '''sledgehammer''' is a hammer that has a longer shaft, and a more massive head. The user can swing it with two hands and apply more force.
