An '''audiophile''' is a person who cares about how good music sounds on a [[stereo]] or other [[high fidelity]] sound system. An audiophile is interested in how to improve the sound quality of [[sound recording]]s, such as [[vinyl record]]s and [[Compact Disc]]s, as well as the equipment used to listen to recordings such as [[CD player]]s, [[amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s. 
 
 Audiophiles are always looking for ways to improve their sound system. There are discussion forums, magazines and clubs for audiophiles to share their ideas.  
 
 Some audiophiles believe that differences should be able to be measured in a [[science|scientific]] way. This type of audiophile is called an  " objectivist " . 
 
 Other audiophiles believe that  " what sounds better "  or  " more musical "  may not be measurable. They rely mostly on their own ears and preferences. This type of audiophile is called a  " subjectivist " . 
 
 '''Audiophile''' is also used as an adjective in descriptions of audio equipment and recorded music, where it is intended to imply high quality.
