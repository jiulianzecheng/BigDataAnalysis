 A '''meteor''' is what you see when a space rock falls to [[Earth]]. It is often known as a '''shooting star''' or '''falling star''' and can be a bright light in the [[wikt:night|night]] [[sky]], though most are faint. A few survive long enough to hit the ground. That is called a '''meteorite''', and a large one sometimes leaves a hole in the ground called a [[crater]].  
 
 A rock that has not yet hit the [[atmosphere]] is called a '''meteoroid'''. Meteoroids may range in size from large pieces of rock to tiny dust particles floating in space that did not form [[planet]]s. When the meteoroids enter Earth's [[atmosphere]] they are usually going faster than the Earth's [[escape velocity]] of 13 & nbsp;km/sec or [[Mach number|Mach 40]]. This makes them heat up and usually break apart. When the heat makes them glow, they are known as meteors. 
 
 Meteors are distinct from [[comet]]s or [[asteroid]]s, but some, especially those associated with [[meteor shower]]s, are dust particles that came out of comets. 
 
 There are several types of meteorites including: stony, carbonaceous chondrites, and iron-nickel. Stony meteorites are named because they are largely made up of stone-like mineral material. Carbonaceous chondrites have a high carbon content. Iron-nickel meteorites are mostly iron often with significant nickel as well. 
 
 Meteorites happened often during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]. Nowadays they sometimes hurt people and property. The [[2013 Russian meteor event]] did the most damage. Large meteorite strikes may have played a part in several of the mass [[extinction]]s, and so indirectly on the course of [[evolution]]. (see [[K/T extinction event]]; [[List of extinction events]]; [[Chicxulub crater]]) 
 
 == Meteorite types == 
 === Chondrites ===

 Chondrites are stony (non-metallic) [[meteorite]]s that are as old as the [[Solar System]]: 4.55 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] years. < ref > The use of the term non-metallic does not imply the total absence of metals. < /ref >  They sometimes contain [[amino acids]] and other organic molecules. 
 
 They have not been modified due to [[melting]] or other disturbances. They are formed when various types of dust and small grains that were present in the early solar system accreted to form primitive [[asteroid]]s. They are the most common type of meteorite that falls to Earth: they are about 85 or 86 percent of all meteorites. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Meteorites for the Sahara: find locations, shock classification, degree of weathering and pairing |journal=Meteoritics |issn=0026-1114 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=113–122 |bibcode=1995Metic..30..113B |last1=Bischoff |first1=A. |last2=Geiger |first2=T. |year=1995 |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1995.tb01219.x}} < /ref >   
 
 Their study gives clues about the origin and age of the [[Solar System]], the synthesis of [[organic compound]]s, the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] or the presence of water on [[Earth]]. Chondrites can be differentiated from iron meteorites by their low [[iron]] and [[nickel]] content.

 ==== Carbonaceous chondrites ==== 
 In 2021, a meteorite crashed on the [[Gloucestershire]] town of [[Winchcombe]]. It contained water that was a near-perfect match for that on Earth. The meteorite was picked up soon after it landed. < ref > Amos, Jonathan 2022. Winchcombe meteorite bolsters Earth water theory. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63631563] < /ref >  This is a suggested source for the water on Earth. 
 
 === Achondrites === 
 About 8 percent of meteorites show signs of melting and recrystallizing. They look rather like [[basalt]] or [[granite]]. 
 
 === Iron meteorites ===

 Iron meteorites are meteorites made of an [[iron]]–[[nickel]] [[alloy]]. They are about 6 percent of all meteorites. This comes from the inner cores of early small proto-planets. < ref name= " Weisberg 2006 " > {{cite book|editor=D.S. Lauretta  &  H.Y. McSween, Jr.|title=Meteorites and the early Solar System II|year=2006|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=978-0816525621|url=http://haroldconnolly.com/EES%20716%20Fall%2009%20Reading/Lecture%201/Background%20reading/Weisberg_etal_MESSII.pdf|author=M.K. Weisberg|author2=T. J. McCoy  &  A.N. Krot|accessdate= 2012-01-01|pages=19–52|chapter=Systematics and evaluation of meteorite classification}} < /ref >  The iron found in iron meteorites was one of the earliest sources of usable iron,  before [[human]]s invented [[smelting]]. That signalled the beginning of the [[iron age]]. Iron meteorites are easily found, because native iron is rare. 
 
 === Siderolites === 
 Siderolites are stony-iron meteorites that have almost equal parts of iron and [[silicate]]s. They are quite rare: only about 1 percent of all meteorites are siderolites.
