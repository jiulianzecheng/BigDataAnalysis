 '''Thalassaemia''' (or '''thalassemia''') is a [[genetic disorder]] of the blood which originated in the [[Mediterranean region]].  
 
 This disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of [[red blood cell]]s. This is caused by [[mutation|mutant]] [[genes]] which affect how the body makes [[haemoglobin]]. Haemoglobin is the [[protein]] in red blood cells which carries [[oxygen]]. People with thalassaemia make less haemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe [[anemia]]. 
 
 Thalassaemia can cause significant complications, including [[pneumonia]], iron overload, bone deformities and [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]] illness. However, this inherited disease of red blood cells gives a degree of protection against [[malaria]], which is or was common in the regions where the [[trait]] is common.  This selective survival advantage for carriers (known as [[heterozygous advantage]]) is responsible for keeping the mutation in populations way above its mutation rate. Carriers are [[heterozygous]] for the thalassaemia [[allele]], meaning only one of their two alleles is mutant (abnormal). There are a number of different versions of thalassaemia. Each one is caused by a mutation in a different position in the [[genome]]. 
 
 In that respect, thalassaemia resembles another [[genetic disorder]] affecting haemoglobin, [[sickle-cell disease]]. < ref > Weatherall David J, Chapter 47.

 It is possible to cure patients with thalassaemia with [[bone marrow]] [[transplant]]s from compatible [[Blood donation|donors]]. < ref > [http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/117/5/1745.abstract HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplantation for Î²-thalassemia major], Blood Journal, 3 February 2011 < /ref >  However, this method requires an HLA-matched compatible donor. < ref > HLA = Human [[leukocyte]] [[antigen]], a key part of the [[immune system]]. < /ref >
