 '''Shavuot''', or Shavuos in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] usage, is a [[holiday]] celebrated by [[Jewish]] people. They celebrate it to remember the day [[God]] gave the [[Torah]] to the entire nation of [[Israel]] assembled at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The holiday association between the giving of the Torah (''[[Matan Torah]]'') and Shavuot is not [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] in the Biblical text.  
 
 Shavuot is celebrated on the sixth day of the Hebrew month of [[Sivan]], which may occur in May or June. It falls 49 days after [[Passover]](Pesach), which comes before Shavuot. It marks the end of the Counting of the Omer (Sefirat HaOmer). [[Pentecost]] falls around the time of Shavuot.  
 
 In [[Secular]] [[Jew]]s of the [[Diaspora]], Shavuot is one of the Jewish holidays known to not be celebrated as much, while the people in Israel celebrate it every year. < ref name= " forward " > {{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/127963/ |title=Shavuot: The Zeppo Marx of Jewish Holidays |last=Goldberg |first=J.J. |publisher=The Forward |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2013}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.rabbiwein.com/Jerusalem-Post/2010/05/517.html |title=Shavuot Thoughts |last=Wein |first=Rabbi Berel |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=21 May 2010 |access-date=17 February 2013 |archive-date=14 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314013329/http://www.rabbiwein.com/Jerusalem-Post/2010/05/517.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Shavuot is celebrated by all types of Orthodox Jewry, ranging from Modern to ultra-Orthodox. It is one of the three pilgrimage holidays celebrated by Jews. (The other two being Passover, and Sukkot, or 'Festival of the Tabernacle'.) 
 
 According to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], Shavuot is celebrated in [[Israel]] for one day and in the Diaspora (outside of Israel) for two days. [[Reform Jews]] celebrate only one day. < ref > [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Shavuot/TO_Shavuot_Community.htm My Jewish Learning on Shavuot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609104529/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Shavuot/TO_Shavuot_Community.htm |date=2008-06-09 }} - see 7th paragraph < /ref >
