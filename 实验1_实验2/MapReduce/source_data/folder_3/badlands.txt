 '''Badlands''' are a type of dry [[terrain]] which is extremely difficult to move across. < ref > Jackson, Julia A. (ed) 1997.  " Badlands "  in ''Glossary of geology'' 4th ed. Alexandria, Viriginia: American Geological Institute. ISBN 0922152349 < /ref > 
 
 It happens when softer rock is [[Erosion|eroded]] by wind and water, leaving harder rock sticking up. [[Canyon]]s, [[ravine]]s, [[gully|gullies]] and other such [[geological]] forms are common in badlands. They are very difficult to cross by foot, or even on horse, and impossible by car. Dry badlands may have spectacular colour displays that range from dark black/blue [[coal]] [[strata]] to bright [[clay]]s and [[sandstone]]. 
 
 ==Features== 
 The term 'badlands' is apt: badlands have steep slopes, loose dry soil, slick clay, and deep sand, all of which act against travel and other uses. They form in dry regions with infrequent but intense rain-showers, little [[vegetation]], and soft [[sediment]]s which get massive [[erosion]]. 
 
 Some of the most famous [[fossil]] beds are found in badlands, where erosion rapidly exposes the [[sedimentary]] layers and the scant cover of [[vegetation]] makes [[surveying]] and fossil hunting relatively easy. 
 
 Coal seams get exposed in some badlands, so some coal mining districts have developed in badlands areas. An example of this is the [[Drumheller]] district of the [[Red Deer River]] in [[Alberta]], where the [[Atlas Coal Mine]] historical site shows the last of 139 mines which operated in the badlands. 
 
 ==Locations== 
 Some of the best-known badland formations can be found in [[North America]]. In the U.S., the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]] have parts which are true badlands. There it is possible to move in one compass direction, but not at 90 < sup > o < /sup >  to that direction. [[Makoshika State Park]] in [[Montana]], [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]] in [[North Dakota]] and [[Badlands National Park]] in [[South Dakota]] together form a series of extensive badland formations. < ref > Currie P.J; Koppelhus E.B. eds (2005). ''Dinosaur Provincial Park : a spectacular ancient ecosystem revealed''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. ISBN 9780253345950 < /ref >  [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in Colorado and [[Utah]] are also badlands settings. 
 
 The [[Big Muddy Badlands]] in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada, gained notoriety as a hideout for [[outlaw]]s. There is a large badland area in [[Alberta]], Canada, particularly in the valley of the [[Red Deer River]] (where [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] is) and in [[Drumheller]], Alberta where the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] is. 
 
 A well-known badlands formation in [[New Zealand]] is the [[The Pinnacles (New Zealand)|Putangirua Pinnacles]] – formed by the erosion of the [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] of an old [[river delta]]. It is at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the [[North Island]].
