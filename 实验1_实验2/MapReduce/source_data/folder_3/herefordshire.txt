 '''Herefordshire''' (known as '''County of Herefordshire''') is a [[county]]  in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[Regions of England|region]] of [[England]]. It borders the English counties of [[Shropshire]] to the north, [[Worcestershire]] to the east, [[Gloucestershire]] to the south east and the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Preserved counties of Wales|counties]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] to the south west and [[Powys]] to the west. It is not to be confused with [[Hertfordshire]], a county north of [[London]]. 
 
 It is pronounced {{IPA|['herəfədʃə]}} (i.e. first syllable as in  " herring " , and -e- a separate syllable). 
 
 The [[county town]] of Herefordshire is the [[cathedral]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] of [[Hereford]]. 
 
 ==Waterways== 
 Historically, the Rivers [[River Wye|Wye]] and [[River Lugg|Lugg]] were [[navigable]] but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than [[canoes]] and [[coracles]] are now used.  There are canoe centres at [http://www.wyevalleycanoes.co.uk The Boat House], [[Glasbury-on-Wye]], [http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/youthservice/22702.asp the Hereford Youth Service] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119124701/http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/youthservice/22702.asp |date=2005-11-19 }} and [http://www.wye-pursuits.co.uk Kerne Bridge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308100434/http://www.wye-pursuits.co.uk/ |date=2021-03-08 }} Ross-on-Wye, as well as a rowing club in Hereford. 
 
 The early [[nineteenth century]] saw the [[construction]] of two [[canals]], The [http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/post-medieval/canals/hereford_gloucester.htm Hereford  &  Gloucester Canal] and The [http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/post-medieval/canals/leominster_stourport.htm Leominster  &   Stourport Canal] but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen.
