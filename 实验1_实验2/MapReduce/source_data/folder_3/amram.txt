[[Amram]] was the oldest son of [[Kehath]] who was a son of [[Levi]]. Amram married [[Jochebed|Yocheved]], the [[daughter]] of [[Levi]]. She gave birth to a [[daughter]] named [[Miriam]] and a son named [[Aaron]]. Then [[Pharaoh]] said that every newborn [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[baby]] would be thrown in the [[Nile]]. So when they had another son, Amram and Yocheved hid him for three months but then couldn’t anymore so Yocheved put the baby in a basket in the river. Then Pharaoh’s daughter found the boy and named him [[Moses]]. 
 
 == The Midrash == 
 According to a [[Midrash]], when Amram found out Pharaoh would kill every boy, he decided to [[divorce]] Yocheved because he didn’t want a son who would just be killed and the other Israelite men decided to do the same thing. Then Amram’s daughter Miriam told him not to do that because it also meant that no girls would be born, not just boys. Amram then re-married Yocheved so all the other Israelite men remarried their wives.
