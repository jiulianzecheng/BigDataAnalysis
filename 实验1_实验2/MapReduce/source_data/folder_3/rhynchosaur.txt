 '''Rhynchosaurs''' were a group of [[Triassic]] [[diapsid]] [[reptile]]s related to the [[Archosauria|archosaurs]].  They were herbivores, and at times abundant (in some fossil [[wikt:locality|localities]] accounting for 40 to 60% of specimens found), with stocky bodies and a powerful beak. 
 
 They became [[extinct]] at the [[End-Triassic extinction event]].
