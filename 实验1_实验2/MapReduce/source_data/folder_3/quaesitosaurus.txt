 '''''Quaesitosaurus''''' (meaning  " abnormal or extraordinary [[lizard]] " ) was a huge, long-necked, whip-tailed, plant-eating [[dinosaur]] that was found in the [[Gobi Desert]] in [[Mongolia]]. ''Quaesitosaurus'' may have been about 75 feet (23 & nbsp;m) long. This [[sauropod]] dinosaur lived during the late [[Cretaceous]] Period, roughly 85-80 million years ago. ''Quaesitosaurus'' may be the same as ''[[Nemegtosaurus]]''. This environment was semi-[[arid]] during the [[Mesozoic]] Era.
