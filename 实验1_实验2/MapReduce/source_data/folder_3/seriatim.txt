 In law, '''''seriatim''''' ([[Latin]] for  " in series " < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1923 |title=seriatim |publisher=Law.com |access-date=15 March 2016}} < /ref > ) indicates that a [[court]] is addressing multiple issues in a certain order, such as the order that the issues were originally presented to the court. 
 
 == Legal usage == 
 A '''seriatim opinion''' describes an opinion delivered by a court with multiple [[judge]]s, in which each [[judge]] reads his or her own [[legal opinion|opinion]] rather than a single judge writing an opinion on behalf of the entire court. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/seriatim-opinions/ |title=Seriatim Opinions Law  &  Legal Definition |publisher=USLegal, Inc |access-date=15 March 2016}} < /ref >  This is a practice generally used when a [[legal case]] does not have a [[majority opinion]]. 
 
 Use of the word, and other Latin [[phrase]]s, has become less frequent in legal [[communication]]s as a result of, among other factors, efforts by groups such as the [[Plain Language Movement]] to promote the use of  " [[plain English]] "  in legal [[wikt:discourse|discourse]]. 
 
 === In the United Kingdom === 
 In modern use [[pleading]]s is used for  " one by one in sequence " .  For example, in [[English law|English]] [[civil case]]s, [[Statement of case|defence statements]] generally used to conclude with the phrase  " save as expressly admitted herein, each allegation of the plaintiffs is denied as if set out in full and traversed herein ''seriatim''. "  This formulation is now discouraged under the English [[Civil Procedure Rules]], especially rule 16.5 (3)-(5). < ref > {{cite web|title=Content of defence 16.5 (3)-(5)|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part16#16.5|work=Statements Of Case - Civil Procedure Rules|publisher=Ministry of Justice UK|date=10 September 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 It is sometimes seen in older [[deed]]s and [[contract]]s as a more traditional way of using terms of reference.  For example  " the railway [[by-law]]s shall apply to the contract as if set out herein ''seriatim''. "  It is sometimes found as part of the longer phrase ''brevatim et seriatim'', meaning  " briefly and in series " . 
 
 The term is also used when replying to a communication that contains a number of points, issues or questions to show that the responses are in the same order in which they were raised in the original document:  " To deal with your queries seriatim... " 
 
 === In the United States === 
 During the [[Marshall Court|Supreme Court under Chief Justice Marshall]], 1801 to 1835, the practice of judicial opinions being delivered in [[Supreme Court of the United States#Earliest beginnings to Marshall|seriatim was discontinued]].
