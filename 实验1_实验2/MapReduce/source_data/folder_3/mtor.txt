 It has been given various names. It was originally called the 'mammalian target of [[rapamycin]]', but is also known as the 'mechanistic target of rapamycin' and 'FK506-binding protein 12-rapamycin-associated protein 1' (FRAP1). 
 
 The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of mammalian [[metabolism]] and [[physiology]], with important roles in the function of [[tissues]] including [[liver]], [[muscle]], white and brown [[adipose tissue]], and the [[brain]]. < ref name= " pmid24385483 " > {{cite journal | title = Where is mTOR and what is it doing there? | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | year = 2013 | volume = 203 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–74 | pmid = 24385483 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201306041 | pmc = 3840941 | last1 = Betz | first1 = Charles | last2 = Hall | first2 = Michael N. }} < /ref >
