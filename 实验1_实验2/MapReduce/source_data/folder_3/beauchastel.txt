 '''Beauchastel''' is a [[town]] and [[Communes of France|commune]] of the [[Ardèche]] ''[[Departments of France|département]]'', in the southern part of [[France]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The name of the village comes from the  " Bel Castrum "  castle, built in the 12th century by the Lords Retourtour and Briand. It was ruined during the [[French Wars of Religion]], and today only the tower remains.  
 In the 17th and 18th centuries, Beauchastel was one of the last salt stores (''grenier à sel'') of the country.
