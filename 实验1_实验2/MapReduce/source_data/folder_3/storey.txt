 Both British and American English have different floor numbering systems. In British English, the level above the ground floor is the  " first floor " , whereas in American English, it is the  "  second floor " .  
 
 [[Basement]]s may be considered storeys, especially if they're partly above ground, as in a [[walkout basement]]. In which cases, it's typically called the  " lower floor " ,  "  lower ground floor  " ,  "  terrace level  " , etc. In some buildings, the top storey is a finished [[attic]] or [[garret]]. 
 
 Storeys can be used to classify [[building]]s as low-rise, mid-rise or high-rise. 
 
 Low-rise buildings have one to four storeys. 
 
 A mid-rise building is typically 5-9 storeys. 
 
 And a high-rise building is typically 10 or more storeys.
