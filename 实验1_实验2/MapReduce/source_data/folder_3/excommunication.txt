'''Excommunication''' is a [[Religion|religious]] act used to take off or [[:wikt:suspend|suspend]] membership in a religious community. 
 
 The word literally means ''out of [[full communion|communion]]'', or ''no longer in communion''.  In some churches, excommunication includes the belief that the person who was exocommunicated is going to [[Hell]]. Sometimes punishment  ''follow'' excommunication; these include being banned, [[shunning]], and [[shaming]], depending on the group's religion or religious community.
