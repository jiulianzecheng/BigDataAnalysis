 '''''Dimetrodon''''' was a [[pelycosaur]] (early [[Synapsida]]) from the first part of the [[Permian period]] (about 295–272 [[million]] years ago).  
 
 ''Dimetrodon'' walked on four legs and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the southwestern [[United States]], from [[red beds]] in [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. The largest known species of ''Dimetrodon'' is ''D. & nbsp;angelensis'' at {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} and the smallest is ''D. & nbsp;teutonis'' at {{convert|60|cm|in}}. < ref name=Palaeos > {{cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/paleozoic/permian/kungurian.htm |title=The Kungurian Age |work=Palaeos |accessdate=29 September 2013 |archive-date=12 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112090513/http://palaeos.com/paleozoic/permian/kungurian.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " FSMSS11 " > {{cite journal|last=Fröbisch J.

 ''Dimetrodon'' was a [[carnivore]], probably the top [[predator]] in its environment. Its main feature is the large sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending upwards from the vertebrae. The spines would be joined by [[epidermis|skin]]. The general opinion of [[palaeontologist]]s is that it was a [[homoiotherm|temperature-regulating]] device. < ref > Florides G.A. ''et al'' 2001. Natural environment and thermal behaviour of Dimetrodon limbatus. ''Journal of Thermal Biology'' '''26''' (1): 15–20. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030645650000019X] < /ref >  The idea is that the animal could warm up in the early morning by placing itself broadside to the Sun, and later could cool off in the shade, or arrange for its body to get less sunlight. At this stage in [[evolution]], no land animals were [[homoiotherm]]s. Very likely the sail was also used for sexual or territorial [[signal (biology)|signalling]]. In which case, the skin would be coloured. This, of course, is supposition, but it does make sense of the animal's most extraordinary feature. 
 
 In evolutionary terms, ''Dimetrodon'' was a synapsid, a line of land animals which eventually gave rise to the [[mammals]]. It was not on the direct line of descent, < ref > Benson R.J. 2012. Interrelationships of basal synapsids: cranial and postcranial morphological partitions suggest different topologies. ''Journal of Systematic Paleontology'' '''10''' (2). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14772019.2011.631042#.Va3sw9trWHM] < /ref >  but a good example of the [[evolutionary grade]] typical of [[Permian]] synapsids.
