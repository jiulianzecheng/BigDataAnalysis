 '''Caramel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ær|ə|m|ɛ|l}}} < ref > {{cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/newoxfordamerica0000unse_l5h7|edition=3rd|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/newoxfordamerica0000unse_l5h7/page/260 260]}} < /ref > 
 ) is a [[beige]] to dark-brown sweet food. It is made by heating [[sugar]]s. It is used to add flavour to [[pudding]]s and [[dessert]]s. It can also be as a filling, like is done in bonbons, and as a topping for [[ice cream]], [[custard]] and [[coffee]]. 
 
 Simple sugar ([[Sucrose]]) starts to melt at about  {{convert|135|°C|-1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, without changing its color. The process called caramelisation starts when sugar  is heated to at least  {{convert|150|°C|-1|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and more often to around {{convert|170|°C|-1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. As the sugar heats, the [[molecule]]s break down and turn into [[Chemical compound|compound]]s with the colour and flavour of caramel. 
 
 Many [[candy|candies]] and [[dessert]]s are made with caramel. Some of these are [[caramel apples]], [[praline]]s, nougats, brittles, ''crème caramel'', and ''[[crème brûlée]]''. 
 
 ==Caramel candy==  
 Caramel candy is a soft, [[density|dense]], chewy candy. It is made by boiling a mixture of [[milk]] or [[cream]], [[sugar]](s), [[butter]], and vanilla flavouring.  The sugar(s) are heated separately to reach {{convert|170|°C|-1}}. This turns them to caramel before the other ingredients are added. < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=3fkAazdFhL8C & pg=PA265 & dq=caramels+recipe+smoke Ready for Dessert: My Best Recipes] < /ref >  Another way of doing this is to cook all ingredients together. This way, the milk turns to caramel but the sugars do not. This type of candy is often called  " milk caramel "  or  " cream caramel " . 
 
 ==Caramel coloring== 
 Caramel coloring is a dark bitter-tasting liquid. It is what is made after near-total caramelisation. It is then bottled to be used for other things. It is used as [[food coloring]] and in [[beverage]]s like [[cola]]. 
 
 ==Caramel sauce== 
 [[File:Kolasås sjudandes på spisen.jpg|thumb|right|Caramel sauce]] 
 Caramel sauce is made from heating [[water]] and [[caster sugar]] at a low to medium temperature. This is done until the sugar [[Solvation|dissolves]] and  " caramelises " . This changes its colour to golden brown.
