 '''Toast''' is [[bread]] which has been grilled until hot and crispy. A [[toaster]], [[grill]] or open fire is used. Toasted bread is both darker in [[color]] and crunchier than normal bread. Toast can be eaten with a range of [[condiment]]s spread on the surface, such as [[butter]], [[jam]], [[honey]], and cheese to make [[cheese on toast]], though these are optional as some people prefer their toast without condiments (dry toast). 
 
 Toast can also be used to make 'toasties', where a filling is compressed and heated between two slices of buttered bread in a toastie maker. Popular fillings include [[cheese]], [[jam]], [[peanut butter]] and [[chocolate]] spread. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.oola.com/life-in-flavor/2476217/15-delicious-toast-spreads-that-arent-butter/ | title=15 Delicious Toast Spreads That Aren't Butter | date=10 July 2019 }} < /ref >
