 '''Badfinger''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[rock music|rock]] [[band|group]]. They were first called '''The Iveys''', but renamed themselves after a song title,  " Badfinger Boogie " , the original title of  " With a Little Help From My Friends " . The band's members were [[Peter Ham]], [[Tom Evans]], [[Mike Gibbins]] and [[Joey Molland]]. Badfinger recorded for [[Apple Records]], which was a [[record label]] started by [[The Beatles]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Elektra Records]], and [[Radio Records]]. 
 
 Their first [[hit record]] was  " Come And Get It " , which was written by [[Paul McCartney]]. It appeared in a movie, ''The Magic Christian''. The band followed McCartney's [[demo (music)|demo]] closely to make the record. The finished record sounded like a Beatles song. Later they made records that sounded different, and showed the band's own style. [[Todd Rundgren]] was the [[record producer|producer]] of some of their recordings. 
 
 Badfinger's other hit records included  " No Matter What " ,  " Day After Day " , and  " Baby Blue " . Later they left Apple Records and recorded for [[Warner Bros.]] Ham and Evans were the band's main [[songwriter]]s. One of their songs,  " [[Without You]] " , was recorded by the band, but was not a hit. A later [[cover version]] by singer [[Harry Nilsson]] became an [[:wikt:international|international]] hit, and was the first of many such versions. Many recording artists have sung  " Without You " , including [[Mariah Carey]]. < ref > {{cite web|last=Webb|first=Robert|title=Back to where they once belonged|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/back-to-where-they-once-belonged-625998.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=16 November 2000}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1970 Badfinger made an agreement with an American businessman called Stan Polley who promised to help them earn more money. But instead of helping them, Polley kept their money ''away'' from them in an account and refused to tell them how to get it out. He also behaved dishonestly toward Warner Bros. Because of his dishonesty, the band's sixth album was removed from shops after being available for only seven weeks, and Warner Bros. refused to release their seventh album. As a result, the band did not earn any money for their hard work, which made Pete Ham feel very [[depression (illness)|depressed]]. Feeling that he could not be a good husband or father without any money, Ham committed [[suicide]] by hanging himself in 1975. 
 
 Evans and Molland decided they still wanted to work together. Mike Gibbins, the drummer, wanted to as well, but could not. They found two more musicians to take the place of Ham and Gibbins, and recorded a new album called  " Airwaves " . They had only one very small hit, but continued to tour. They released another record called  " Say No More " . This record had cover art by artist [[Peter Max]]. 
 
 Tom Evans had problems like Ham's, and killed himself (eight years after Ham) in the same way.
