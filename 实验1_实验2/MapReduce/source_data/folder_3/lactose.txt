 '''Lactose''' is a [[disaccharide]] that is made up of [[galactose]] and [[glucose]] molecules. Lactose makes up around 2-8% of the [[solid]]s in [[milk]]. The name comes from the [[Latin]] word for milk, plus the -ose ending used to name [[sugar]]s. Lactose is found in some milk products. 
 
 == Digestion of lactose == 
 Infant [[mammal]]s are fed on by milk from their mothers. To digest it, an [[enzyme]] called [[lactase]] cleaves the lactose into its two subunits [[glucose]] and [[galactose]] for absorption.
