 A '''dagger''' is a knife which is used to stab people.  It has a double-edged blade, so it cannot be used for normal cutting like a knife. 
 
 Daggers are small, so they can often be hidden under the attacker's clothing and then suddenly produced. 
 
 They were also used in the [[Middle Ages]] for the infantry armies to defend or attack their opponents. 
 
 Some people like [[Julius Caesar]] were [[assassinate]]d with a dagger.
