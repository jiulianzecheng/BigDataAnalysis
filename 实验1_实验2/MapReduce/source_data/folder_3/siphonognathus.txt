 '''''Siphonognathus''''' is a genus of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[weed whitings]] in the family [[Odacidae]] which are endemic to [[Southern Australia|Southern Australian]] coastal waters. They are sometimes called '''tube-finned fish''', thanks to their tubular appearance. These fish are characterized by their extremely elongate bodies and live primarily in seagrass beds. 
 
 == Species == 
 There are currently six recognized species in this genus: 
 
 * ''[[Tubemouth|Siphonognathus argyrophanes]]''  < small > J. Richardson, 1858 < /small >  (Tubemouth) 
 * ''[[Slender weed whiting|Siphonognathus attenuatus]]''  < small > J. D. Ogilby, 1897 < /small >  (Slender weed whiting) 
 * ''[[Siphonognathus beddomei]]''  < small > R. M. Johnston, 1885 < /small >  (Pencil weed whiting) 
 * ''[[Siphonognathus caninis]]''  < small > J. K. Scott, 1976 < /small >  (Sharpnose weed whiting) 
 * ''[[Siphonognathus radiatus]]''  < small > (Quoy  &  Gaimard, 1834) < /small >  (Long-rayed weed whiting) 
 * ''[[Longtail weed whiting|Siphonognathus tanyourus]]''  < small > M. F. Gomon  &  Paxton, 1986 < /small >  (Longtail weed whiting) 
 
 They were formerly placed in separate genera. They placed ''[[Slender weed whiting|S. attentuatus]]'', ''[[Siphonognathus beddomei|S. beddomei]]'', ''[[Siphonognathus radiatus|S. radiatus]]'' and ''[[Longtail weed whiting|S. tanyourus]]'' in the separate genus ''[[Sheardichthys]]'' and ''[[Siphonognathus caninis|S. caninis]]'' on the monospecific genus ''[[Parodax]]'', leaving ''Siphonognathus'' as a monospecific genus containing only the [[tubemouth]] (''S. argyrophanes'').
