 A '''walrus''' is a [[marine mammal]], < ref > {{cite book| title = Mammal species of the world| author = Wozencraft W.C.| pages = | edition = 3rd | editor = Wilson D.E. and Reeder D.M.| date = 2005| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| isbn=0-8018-8221-4| url = http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3}} < /ref >  the only species of the family '''Odobenidae''', which is one of the three [[pinniped]] families. They live in the cold northern [[sea]]s of the [[Arctic Ocean]] around [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. 
 
 ==Description== 
 Walruses have lots of things similar to true seals and [[Eared seal|eared seals]]. Like true seals, they just have a hole for an [[ear]] - not ear flaps. Like eared seals, they can rotate their back flippers forward to [[walk]] on land. Like both true seals and eared seals, they are very good [[swim]]mers and divers. However, walruses do have some [[wikt:feature|features]] that neither true seals nor eared seals have. 
 
 The most famous thing about walruses are their ''[[tusk]]s''. Even though they are called tusks, they are actually teeth growing out of their mouth, a bit like the [[narwhal]]. The tusks grow for about 15 years before they reach their full [[wikt:length|length]], which is about {{convert|40|in|cm|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} for males and {{convert|30|in|cm|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} for females. 
 
 Both the male and female walrus grow tusks. They can use them to protect themselves from [[polar bear]]s and [[orca|killer whales]] and use them when they eat. When they eat bigger preys such as [[Pinniped|seals]] and small [[whale]]s, they first tear them apart with their tusks to make them easier to eat. Another important use of a walrus's tusks is to pull itself out onto the ice. Pushing its tusks into the [[ice]], the walrus gets extra help hauling its huge body out of the [[sea]]. This is probably how walruses got their family name ''Odobenidae'', which comes from [[Greece|Greek]] words meaning  " one that walks with [[teeth]] " . They do not walk with their teeth, but it can look as if they do when they pull themselves out of the water. Their tusks can also be used to cut holes in the [[ice]]. < ref > {{cite book|author = Berta A. and Sumich J.L. |year = 1999|title = Marine mammals: evolutionary biology|publisher = Academic Press|location = San Diego, CA|pages = 494 pp}} < /ref >  Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice. < ref name= " Fay82 " > {{cite journal|author = Fay F.H.|year = 1982|title = Ecology and biology of the Pacific walrus, ''Odobenus rosmarus divergens''|journal = United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}} < /ref > 
 
 Walruses are very big, even compared to big male [[sea lion]]s. When they are all grown up, they can weigh more than {{convert|1,400|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The walruses that live in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are a little smaller than the ones in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Both kinds like to stay in the cold north. With all their [[blubber]], which can be as much as {{convert|6|in|cm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} thick, they are very comfortable in [[ice|icy]] [[water]]. 
 
 == Features == 
 Walruses are usually brown, but walruses can change colour [[wikt:depend|depending]] on how warm they are. They are usually different kinds of brown, but as they get warmer, their skin can turn [[pink]]. This is because as they get warmer, blood rushes to the skin to try to cool it. 
 
 The walrus has an air sac under its [[throat]] which acts like a flotation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water while sleeping.  
 
 The males have a large [[penis]] bone, up to {{convert|63|cm|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size. < ref name= " Fay85 " > {{cite journal|author = Fay F.H.|title = Odobenus rosmarus|year = 1985|url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html|journal = Odobenus Rosmarus.
