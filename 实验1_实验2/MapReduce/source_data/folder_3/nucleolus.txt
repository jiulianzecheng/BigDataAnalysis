 A '''nucleolus''' (plural: nucleoli) is the part of a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell]] where [[ribosomes]] are made. Seen under a [[microscope]], the nucleolus is a dark spot inside the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. It is made up of dense [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells also have ribosomes, but they don't make as many as eukaryotes do, and there is no visible nucleotatius. There is usually more than one nucleolus in a eukaryote cell. The nucleolus is not bounded by a membrane.   
 
 The nucleolus is made at a nucleolus organizer region (NOR), which is a [[chromosome]] region around which the nucleolus forms. Inside the nucleolus ribosomes are made. Ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesizes proteins. The ribosomes are exported through the [[nuclear membrane|nuclear envelope]] to the [[cytoplasm]], where they do their work. < ref name= " geoffrey " > {{cite book |first1=Geoffrey M. |last1=Cooper |first2=Robert E. |last2=Hausman |title=The Cell: a molecular approach |url=https://archive.org/details/cellmolecularapp00coop_518 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |year=2007 |isbn=978-0878932207 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cellmolecularapp00coop_518/page/n394 371]–9 |edition=4th}} < /ref > 
 
 Nucleoli play a role in the cell's response to [[stress (biology)|stress]]. They also help in the assembly of [[signal recognition particle]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal|url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0005975.html|title = Nucleolus: structure and function|last = Olsen|first = Mark OJ|date = 2010|journal = eLS|accessdate = October 17, 2014|doi = 10.1002/9780470015902.a0005975.pub2|pmid = |isbn = 9780470016176|archive-date = March 7, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210307065300/http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0005975.html|url-status = dead}} < /ref >   Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause of several human diseases. < ref >  Woods SJ, Hannan KM, Pearson RB, Hannan RD  2015.
