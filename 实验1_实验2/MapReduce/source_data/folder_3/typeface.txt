 In [[typography]], a '''typeface''' is a family of [[font]]s. Every [[glyph]] in a typeface shares certain [[design]] features. Typefaces have names, such as ''Times New Roman'', ''Garamond'', ''Baskerville''. 
 
 Every font of a typeface has specific details (such as [[size]] and weight) and is used in a particular way. The reason for having different fonts is to give the [[designer]] or printer choices which suit various needs. The most basic of all needs is to have the text [[legibility|legible]] and [[Readability|readable]]. < ref > Williamson, Hugh 1956. ''Methods of book design''. Oxford University Press, chapter 9, Principles of text design. < /ref > < ref > Aldrich-Ruenzel, Nancy  &  Fennell, John 1991. ''Designer's guide to typography''. Oxford: Phaidon, p18 Readability and legibility in text. {{ISBN|0-7148-2706-1}} < /ref > 
 
 There are many versions of typefaces which are out of [[copyright]].  " ITC Garamond "  is a different typeface from  " Adobe Garamond "  or  " Monotype Garamond " . These are all versions of the typeface [[Garamond]], originally created in the [[16th century]]. There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly. 
 
 The art and craft of designing typefaces is called ''type design''. In digital typography, type designers are sometimes also called ''font developers'' or ''font designers''. 
 
 Every typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual [[letter]], [[number]], [[Punctuation|punctuation mark]], or other [[symbol]]. There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as [[cartography|map-making]] or [[astrology]] and [[mathematics]]. 
 
 A very widely used typeface is ''Times New Roman''. This is a [[serif]] typeface commissioned by the British [[newspaper]] ''[[The Times]]'' in [[1931]]. < ref > Loxley, Simon 2006.
