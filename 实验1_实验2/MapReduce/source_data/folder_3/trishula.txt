 '''Trishula''' ([[Sanskrit]]: त्रिशूल, [[IAST]]: triśūla) or '''Trishul''' is a [[trident]], a divine symbol, commonly used as one of the principal symbols in [[Hinduism]]. The name  " Trishula "  ultimately derives from the Sanskrit word त्रिशूल (triśūla), from त्रि (trí), meaning  " three " , and शूल (śū́la), meaning  " a sharp iron pin or stake " , referring in this case to the weapon's three prongs.
