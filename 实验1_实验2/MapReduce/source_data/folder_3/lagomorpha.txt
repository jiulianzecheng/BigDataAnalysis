 '''Lagomorpha''' is a [[mammal]] order. It includes [[pika]]s, [[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s. Although lagomorphs look like [[rodent]]s, they are not rodents, but are closely related to them. They have four [[incisor]]s on the upper [[jaw]], not two as with rodents. Also, they only eat [[plant]] material, not meat as rodents do to some extent. 
 
 Rabbits were classified under rodents until the 20th century. < ref > Gregory W.K. 1019. ''The orders of mammals''. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History. '''27'''. < /ref > < ref > Wood A.E 1957. What, if anything, is a rabbit? ''Evolution'' '''11''', 417{{ndash}}425. < /ref >   They are divided into two families: [[Leporidae]], which are hares and rabbits, and [[Ochotonidae]], the pikas. 
 
 It has been known for some time that Lagomorpha is an unusual group, and there have been many guesses about its [[evolution]]. Darren Naish explains this. < ref > Naish, Darren 2010.
