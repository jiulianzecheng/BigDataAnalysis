 '''Bushwhacking''' was a kind of [[guerrilla warfare]]. It happened a lot during the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[American Civil War]] and other wars in which there were big areas of disagreeable land and few governmental resources to control them. This was very common in [[rural area]]s during the Civil War where there were disagreements between those who liked the [[Union (Civil War)|Union]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the war. The [[perpetrator]]s of the attacks were called '''bushwhackers'''. The term  " bushwhacking "  is still in use today to describe ambushes done with the goal of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/bushwhack |title=Oxford Dictionary |access-date=2019-10-07 |archive-date=2013-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023001603/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/bushwhack |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.civilwarmo.org/educators/resources/info-sheets/life-guerrilla-missouri Life of a Guerilla in Missouri] < /ref >
