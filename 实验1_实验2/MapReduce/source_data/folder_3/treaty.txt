 A '''treaty''' is a written [[agreement]] between two or more parties. International treaties are covered by [[international law]]. The parties may be [[country|countries]] or other important groups. A treaty may be about any subject. 
 
 Two countries might agree to stop a [[war]], or declare war on a common [[enemy]]. Very common are treaties where a country promises to come to the aid of another country if the other country is attacked. Treaties about [[trade]] are also common. They may allow allow each other's [[citizen]]s or merchandise to cross [[border]]s freely. For example, the [[European Union]] is set up by treaties between most of the European nations.
