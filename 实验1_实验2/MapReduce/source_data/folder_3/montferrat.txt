 '''Montferrat''' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]: ''Monfr√†''; {{lang-it|Monferrato}}; {{lang-la|Mons ferratus}}) is part of the region of [[Piedmont]] in Northern [[Italy]]. It is both a historical and geographic area. It includes either a part of the [[Province of Alessandria]], or a part of the [[Province of Asti]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was a small [[marquisate]] (meaning a  " small reign " ), inside the Kingdom of Italy. Montferrat is famous worldwide for its soft and green hills. It produces award-winning wines, including [[Asti wine]], [[Barbera]] and [[Moscato d'Asti]]. In June 2014, Montferrat, along with [[Langhe]] was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique characteristics.  
 
 Montferrat has three areas: 
 
 * Basso Monferrato (low Montferrat), which is the area surrounding the town of [[Casale Monferrato]] 
 * Monferrato Astigiano (Astesan Montferrat), which is the area of almost the whole Province of [[Asti]] (except Astesan Langhe). Its highest point, {{convert|549|m|abbr=off}} above sea level, has been identified as the village of [[Albugnano]]. 
 * Alto Monferrato (High Montferrat), which is the area that orbits around the town of [[Acqui terme]] 
 
 Montferrat has a strong culinary culture. It is one of the most important producers in the world of [[cheese]], white [[truffle]] and other products of nature, such as vegetables, cereals and fruits. One of the best-known dishes of Monferrato is [[Agnolotti]], which are a special type of filled pasta.
