 A '''website''' is a set of [[webpage]]s that are joined. People look at websites with a [[computer]] of some kind, sometimes including the computer inside [[mobile phone]]s and [[television]]s. The websites are kept on computers called [[server|web servers]]. 
 
 == Overview == 
 There is almost always a single [[homepage]] which has [[link]]s to other pages that are part of that  " site " . Sometimes it has links to pages that are part of other  " sites "  as well. (Note that [[net jargon]] uses the word [[site]], which also means a physical place in the real world, to mean a [[World Wide Web|web]] [[URL]]). A home page serves as the [[wikt:introduction|introduction]] page of a website. 
   
 Websites can be used to [[advertise]] or sell things. They can also be used to talk to other people. A [[blog]] is a website where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it, and which is more focused on dialogue. Very often the people who use blogs dislike the word  " site "  since it implies a controlled place. Sites are good for looking up [[information]] on the computer. 
 
 == Types == 
 There are many different types of website based on their purpose and the type of organisation they are created for. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-01-08|title=13 Types of Websites SMEs Can Use to Grow Their Business|url=https://emerge360.co/website-types/|access-date=2022-02-25|website=emerge360.co|language=en-GB}} < /ref >

 == Access == 
 Users can access any website by using a [[URL]]. This is the website address which is shown near the top of the [[web browser]]. The homepage and the rest of the site usually have the same words at the start of the URL â€” for example, pages at the Simple English Wikipedia always start  " http://simple.wikipedia.org/... "  but are different after that. However, if a person does not buy a [[domain name]], the website could be an [[IP Address]]. An example of an IP address is [http://172.217.13.228 172.217.13.228]{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Web sites are usually shown in [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Markup Language) but are not always written or kept that way - some use WAP and others use [[XML]]. 
 
 Website builder [[software]] is usually a collection of software tools that allow the construction of websites without manual code editing. < ref name=Peri251 > Peri Pakroo; Marcia Stewart, ''Small Business Start-Up Kit, The: A Step-by-Step Legal Guide'' (Berkeley, CA: Nolo, 2014), p. 251 < /ref >  Several hosted website services have website builder software built-in. < ref name=Peri251/ >
