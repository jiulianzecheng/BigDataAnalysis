 In 1998 the population of Mingora was about 175,000. The city was once a major tourist destination and was described by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] as the  " [[Switzerland]] "  of the [[British Empire|former British Empire]]. < ref name= " Times " > [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5974726.ece Pakistani region where the brutal Taleban have taken control] < /ref > 
 
 However because of the [[Taliban]], tourism has suffered due to fighting between the Taliban and the government. In March 2009 the city came under Taliban rule due to a peace agreement with the government. But the agreement was soon broken and in May 2009 the government were fighting with the Taliban to end their occupation of the city.
