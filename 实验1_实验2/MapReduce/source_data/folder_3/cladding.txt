'''Cladding''' is placing one type of thing on top of another in a layer to make something like a skin. This can protect whatever is underneath the cladding from the weather, or it may [[aesthetic|make it look beautiful]]. < ref > Fleming, et al., ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture'', p.76 (1980) < /ref > 
 
 For example, [[Rainscreen#Rainscreen cladding|Rainscreen]] cladding is one form of weather cladding. It protects things from rainwater and keeps it from getting too hot or cold. The cladding does not need to be [[waterproof]].  Some cladding only makes the rainwater or wind flow another way to control [[Surface runoff|run-off]]. For example, rainscreen cladding can make water on a rooftop flow away from some parts of the building so the water does not come inside. Cladding may also stop noise.
