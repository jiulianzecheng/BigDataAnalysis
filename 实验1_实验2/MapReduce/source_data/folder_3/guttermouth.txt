 '''Guttermouth '''is an American [[punk rock]] [[band]]. They formed in 1988 in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. They are signed to [[Hopeless Records]]. They have released nine full-length [[Studio album|albums]] and two [[live album]]s. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and deliberately explicit behavior. This behavior has resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in [[Canada]] for eighteen months and leaving Warped Tour in 2004 due to conflicting political views and attitudes towards other musicians.
