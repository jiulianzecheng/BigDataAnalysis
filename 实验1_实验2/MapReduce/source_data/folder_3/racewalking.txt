 [[File:Wang Hao 6358.jpg|thumb|105px|20 km race walk.]]'''Racewalking''', or '''Walking race''', is a long-distance [[Track and field athletics|athletic]] event. It is different from [[running]]: in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times. Stride [[length]] is reduced, so to achieve competitive [[speed]]s, race walkers must walk at speeds close to those that [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] 400-meter runners use. They must walk at those speeds for hours at a time since the Olympic events are the 20 km race walk and 50 km race walk. < ref > [http://www.thewalkingsite.com The Walking Site] < /ref >
