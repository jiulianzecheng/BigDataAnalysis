 == Plot == 
 
 The Simpsons family is watching a [[murder]] show on TV. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] sees [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] trying to get their [[wikt:attention|attention]] so she changes the channel to a show that teaches babies [[sign language]]. Maggie was trying to tell them that [[Hans Moleman]] is stuck under a tree that fell, but the family does not notice. In the morning, they keep watching the show and Hans is taken to an [[ambulance]]. 
 
 The show is cancelled because the [[government]] stopped [[funding]] the show, so Marge tries teaching Maggie sign language herself. Marge tries to tell the family about Maggie's development, but the family is too busy on their [[wikt:devices|devices]]. Marge decides to limit everyone's screen time to half an hour a week.  
 
 Marge catches [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] having their screen time changed by a [[technician]], so she puts away the devices completely. Homer is bored at work, so he starts playing [[word game|word puzzles]] in a [[newspaper]]. Marge sees how strong devices are [[wikt:affect|affecting]] [[Patty and Selma]]. Bart uses his [[imagination]] at school when he gets a [[toy]] rocket down from the school roof. Lisa gets the feeling of [[wikt:joy|joy]] when she finds books from the [[library]] without using devices. 
 
 Marge can not find the recipe she is looking for, so when the family comes back home, they find her in the [[closet]] with her [[phone]] and [[laptop]]. Marge [[wikt:admit|admits]] that she is the one who is [[wikt:addicted|addicted]] to devices. She signs the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center, a place to treat screen addictions. 
 
 The next day, they get in to the center and find out it is a [[wikt:pleasant|pleasant]] place. The owner, Dr. Lund, shows them around the place and what you can do. The family starts to [[wikt:recover|recover]], but they can not hold back for long. They find the workers all using computers and sending [[email spam|spam mail]] after stealing the [[wikt:patient#Noun|patients']] accounts. The family can not leave because they signed a [[non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure contract]] which does not let them leave the center. 
 
 At night, the family uses sign language to [[wikt:communicate|communicate]] with each other and escape the center. The next day, Dr. Lund is [[arrest|arrested]] for [[scam|scamming]].
