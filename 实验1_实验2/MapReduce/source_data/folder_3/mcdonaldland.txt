'''McDonaldland''' is a [[fictional universe]] made by [[McDonald's]]. The first character [[Ronald McDonald]] was made in 1963, and they created McDonaldland as a place for him and his friends to live. Ronald's usual friends are Grimace, The Hamburgler, and Birdie the Early Bird. Other people in McDonaldland include Mayor McCheese, Officer Big Mac, the McNugget Buddies, and the Happy Meal Gang. 
 
 In the 1970s and 1980s McDonald's had to change Mayor McCheese and Officer Big Mac, because they were too similar to another fictional world called ''H.R. Pufnstuf''. People thought that McDonaldland got cancelled, but McDonald's was just trying to fix it by bringing in creative people from studios like [[SEGA]] and [[Klasky Csupo]]. The McDonaldland characters have slowly returned, and were even featured as Funko Pop figures in 2019 and 2021.
