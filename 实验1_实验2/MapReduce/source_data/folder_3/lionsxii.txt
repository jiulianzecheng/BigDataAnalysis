 '''LionsXII''' is a Singapore football team based at [[Jalan Besar Stadium]]. Managed by the [[Football Association of Singapore]], the squad marks the return of Singapore to the Malaysia football scene after leaving the Malaysia Cup in 1994. The name  " LionsXII "  is a special tribute to the fans, who is generally recognised as football's  " 12th Man " . 
 
 ==History== 
 In 2011, the [[Football Association of Singapore]] and the [[Football Association of Malaysia]] reached an agreement that would see greater cooperation between the two nations. One of the intended avenues would see the Under-23s play in the [[Malaysian Super League]] and [[Malaysia Cup]] from 2012 onwards, the first time a Singaporean team would be participating in Malaysian domestic football since 1994, when Singapore won the M-League and Malaysia Cup double. < ref > [http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20110712-288801.html Singapore Lions to participate in 2012 Malaysia Cup] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110131100/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20110712-288801.html |date=2012-01-10 }} - Asia One, 7 December 2011 < /ref >  Although the new Singapore team would have the existing Under-23s forming its core, senior players were also called upon to guide the younger players. No foreign players were allowed to be part of the Singapore team as this project served as being developmental.

 LionsXII were set a target of finishing in the top five for the [[2013 Malaysia Super League]] when a press conference was held before the start of the season. The five overage players included key members from the previous campaign such as [[Shahril Ishak]], [[Isa Halim]], and [[Baihakki Khaizan]], but other key players such as [[Shahdan Sulaiman]] and [[Shaiful Esah]] no longer featured. The main aim was to develop the U-23 players and prepare them for the upcoming [[2013 Southeast Asian Games]] that would be held at the end of the year, with the five seniors players serving to guide them throughout the campaign. < ref > [http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/sports/story/lionsxii-aim-top-5-finish-2013-20130106 LIONSXII aim top-five finish] - Straits Times < /ref >  As at the start of the campaign, 13 players were also undergoing National Service. 
 
 LionsXII began their campaign by defeating [[ATM FA]] 1–0 away. In their first home match, they successfully edged out traditional rivals [[Selangor FA]] for the first time since joining the MSL. However, LionsXII stumbled to two losses against lowly [[T-Team FC]] and [[PKNS FC]] away. They also crashed out against in the first round of the [[2013 Malaysia FA Cup]] against PKNS. Despite this, LionsXII went on a long unbeaten streak, securing important wins over [[Pahang FA]] (3–0), [[Kelantan FA]] (1–0), and ATM FA (3–1) at home. The opposing coaches even conceded the title to the LionsXII leading up to the end of the season, < ref > [http://www.todayonline.com/sports/football/giving-chase Malaysian coaches concede MSL title is Singapore's] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130629190924/http://www.todayonline.com/sports/football/giving-chase |date=2013-06-29 }} - TODAYonline, 27 June 2013 < /ref >  as the team chalked up the best home record in the league, winning 10 and drawing one (with the draw coming in Round 19 against title-contender [[Johor Darul Takzim FC]].
