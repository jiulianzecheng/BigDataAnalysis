 '''Scrubber''' systems are used to make [[coal]] a  " cleaner "  [[fuel]].  Scrubbers remove [[sulfur]] from a [[Power station|power plant's]] [[exhaust]].  Scrubbers are of two types, wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers. Wet scrubbers use liquid [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] to remove [[Pollution|pollutants]]. Dry scrubbers typically use [[fabric]] [[filter]]s. In many cases both are used together. < ref > ''Air Pollution Control Engineering'', eds. Lawrence K Wang; Norman C Pereira; Yung-Tse Hung (Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 2004), p. 202 < /ref >  As polluted air passes through a wet scrubber, chemicals in the scrubber [[Chemical reaction|react]] with the [[air pollution]] causing it to [[Precipitation|precipitate]] out.  Modern scrubbers can remove up to 98% of the sulfur and 99% of the precipitate matter from within the [[smokestack]]s. The sulfur and [[Metal|metals]] that are removed from the scrubbers can be sold as a marketable products.  Sludge from lime scrubbers can be sold to [[wallboard]] [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], and fly [[ash]] from [[chimney]] flues can be sold to make lightweight [[concrete]] that can substitute for wood. The use of coal in the [[United States]] about [[wikt:double|double]]d during the last quarter (25 years) of the [[20th century]]. < ref name=Schobert267 > Harold H. Schobert, ''Energy and Society: An Introduction'', Second Edition (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2014), p. 267 < /ref >  However, sulfur in the air was reduced by 30% during that same period. < ref name=Schobert267/ >  This shows that scrubbers work. < ref name=Schobert267/ >
