 '''Lemurs''' are [[primate]]s and [[prosimian]]s (not [[monkey]]s). The word  " lemur "  comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''lemures'', which means  " [[ghosts]] " . Lemur are divided into eight [[family (biology)|families]], with 15 [[genera]] and about 100 living [[species]]. However, lemur  [[taxonomy (biology)|classification]] is controversial: it depends on which species concept is used. ''Lemur'' is also a [[genus]] in one of the families. < ref > Garbutt N. 2007. ''Mammals of Madagascar: a complete guide''. A & C Black Publishers. ISBN 978-0-300-12550-4 < /ref >   
 
 Lemurs are native ''only'' to the [[island]] of [[Madagascar]]. From there a few species got to smaller islands nearby, for example the [[Comoros]]. Madagascar, like [[Africa]] and [[India]], was part of the ancient southern continent of [[Gondwana]]. < ref > Goodman S.M.  &  Benstead, J.P. (eds) 2003. ''The Natural History of Madagascar''. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-30306-2 < /ref >    
 
 Lemurs [[weight|weigh]] from 30[[gram|g]] to the 10[[kilogram|kg]]. Larger species have all become [[extinction|extinct]] since [[human]] groups moved to Madagascar. Usually, the smaller lemurs are active at night ([[nocturnal]]), and the larger ones were active during the day ([[diurnal]]). 
 
 Lemurs are [[endangered species]] because people destroy their [[habitat]] and used to hunt them, and perhaps still do so. 
 
 == Physical description == 
 [[Ring-tailed lemur]], the most studied, are white and black with a ring tail < ref > {{cite web | url=https://lemur.duke.edu/discover/meet-the-lemurs/ring-tailed-lemur/ | title=Ring-tailed Lemur }} < /ref >  The larger species are about 1.5 meters tall and weigh about 2 to 3.5 kilograms. They move quietly, usually at night, sometimes letting out eerie wailing cries, which some people think is the reason why they got their names. 
 
 == Feeding habits and life == 
 Lemurs mostly eat fruit, leaves, and other plant parts. They live in family groups of 5 to 42 members which is called a troop. Females are [[dominant]] and remain in the same troop for life. Males move between troops. The female's [[gestation]] period lasts four to five months, and they usually have one or two babies. Lemur mothers nurse their babies until they are about four months old. Then they begin to feed the babies solid food such as fruit. Lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Some are great leapers, flinging themselves from tree to tree. < ref > Mittermeier R.A. ''et al'' 1994. ''Lemurs of Madagascar''. Illustrated by S.D. Nash. Conservation International. ISBN 1-881173-08-9 < /ref > 
 
 == Communication == 
 Lemurs communicate with a variety of hoots. They will also send messages with [[scents]] (smells). When a male lemur wants to scare another male away, he first rubs its tail on the smelly glands under its arms and then waves the tail in the other male's face. These are called  " stink fights " .
