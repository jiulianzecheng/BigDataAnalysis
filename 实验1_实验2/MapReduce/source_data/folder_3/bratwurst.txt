 There are many different kinds of these sausages. All are special in their own way: 
 * '''Coburger Bratwurst''': A Bratwurst originating in the city of [[Coburg]] in [[Bavaria]]. It is made from a minimum of 15% veal or beef, and its seasonings include only salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon zest. It is coarse in texture and measures about 10 inches in length. Traditionally it is grilled over pinecones and served in a bread roll (Brötchen). 
 * '''Fränkische Bratwurst''': A relatively long (4-8 inches), thick, coarse sausage, originating from the [[Franconia]] (Franken) region in Bavaria. It dates back to 1573. The Fränkische Bratwurst is traditionally served with sauerkraut or potato salad, but with no mustard.

 * '''Rote Wurst''': The Rote Wurst is a favorite Bratwurst of the Swabian region. It is similar to the Bockwurst, and is made from finely ground pork and bacon. Its taste is spicy. To prevent splitting during grilling or pan frying, an X is cut into the ends of the sausage.

 == How the sausage is prepared == 
 Today, most kinds of Bratwurst are prepared by roasting them. Depending on the kind of Bratwurst, it may have been cooked beforehand. Sausages that use raw meat, and that are not roasted or cooked before they are eaten are usually not called Bratwurst.  
 
 ==How people eat the sausage== 
 The sausage is usually eaten with a hot or sweet German [[Culinary mustard|mustard]] or sliced and eaten as [[Currywurst]]. Sometimes, some hot [[France|French]] mustard is served as well. Bratwurst is almost always served with a hard German roll and usually accompanied by a [[beer]]. It is a popular [[snack]] in German-speaking countries, where it is sold at various [[fast food]] outlets and is often consumed while standing. 
 
 ==Bratwurst in the US== 
 In the United States, bratwurst are usually eaten with bread (a [[hot dog]] [[bun]] or a hardroll, for example) and topped with mustard and/or many of the other [[condiment]]s often eaten with [[hot dog]]s, including onions (grilled and/or raw), relish, sauerkraut, etc. The bratwurst is occasionally eaten with a pair of brat links nestled in a buttered hardroll with these same toppings, which is called a 'double brat'. 
 
 Within the US, bratwurst is strongly identified with [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], and other areas in a band stretching from the north side of [[Chicago]] up through [[Minnesota]] and scattered pockets elsewhere in the [[Midwest]].  
 
 They are especially popular in areas of the US where [[German-Americans]] settled in large numbers, like [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], which is informally known as the ''Bratwurst Capital of the World'' because of the city and county's very strong German roots and connections to bratwurst. [[Johnsonville Foods]], the nation's largest bratwurst maker, is based in the nearby unincorporated village of [[Johnsonville, Wisconsin|Johnsonville]]. The city also celebrates Sheboygan Bratwurst Days, a community festival held on the first Thursday-Saturday of [[August]] each year that celebrates the bratwurst.  Other traditional Wisconsin brat manufacturers include [[Klement's Sausage Company]] and Usinger's, both of which are based in Milwaukee. 
 
 The city of [[Madison, Wisconsin]], holds an annual festival billed as the World's Largest Brat Fest. The four-day charity event sees tens of thousands of brats sold by  " celebrity "  cashiers, usually local television, radio, and government personalities. Brat Fest's self-proclaimed world record is 189,432 brats consumed during the 2004 event. 
 
 Another town with German-American roots associated with bratwurst is [[Bucyrus, Ohio]], which is known for its unique recipe incorporating [[fennel]]. It holds a bratwurst festival annually in mid-August attracting over 100,000 visitors annually. [http://www.bratfest.org/]
