 The term '''wigger''' means a person (generally a white person) who by act does things that [[stereotype|stereotypically]] are related to [[urban]] [[African Americans]], [[Black British]] and [[Caribbean]] culture, especially in relation to [[hip hop culture]] and British [[Grime (music)|Grime]]/[[UK Garage|Garage]] scene. < ref > Bernstein, Nell:  " Goin' Gangsta, Choosin' Cholita " , ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'', 5th ed. 605 < /ref >   The word can also be spelled as '''wigga''', '''whigger''' or '''whigga''', also known as '''acting black'''. Other words for  " wigger "  include '''wankster''' and '''wangsta'''. 
 The term originates from a blend of the word ''white'' and the insulting term ''[[nigger]]''. The word is considered offensive by some because of its sameness to ''nigger''.  Also known to be offensive due to stereotypical ideas about urban [[Black people|blacks]]. 
 
 The act of white people using stereotypical black actions, [[slang]], and clothing has appeared in many generations since slavery was removed in the [[western world]]. The concept has been documented in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[Swing (genre)|swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as seen in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay, [[The White Negro (essay)| " The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster " ]]. "  It was later seen in the [[Zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s; the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s; and the [[beatnik]] and [[rock and roll]]er of the 1950s.
