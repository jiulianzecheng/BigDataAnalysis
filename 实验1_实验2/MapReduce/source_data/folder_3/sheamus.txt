 ==Professional wrestling career== 
 ===Training and character development (2002–2004)=== 
 Farrelly's inspiration into a professional wrestling career came from watching both British wrestling from [[ITV]]'s ''[[World of Sport]]'' and American wrestling from the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] on [[Sky1|Sky One]]. < ref name= " ExpressNightOut " > {{cite web|url=http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2009/12/sheamus-wwe-tlc-celtic-warrior.php|title=Tables, Ladders  &  Sheamus: The WWE's Celtic Warrior|last=Porter|first=Christopher|date=2009-12-10|accessdate=2012-01-26|work=Express Night Out|publisher=[[Express (newspaper)|Express]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212338/http://www.expressnightout.com/content/2009/12/sheamus-wwe-tlc-celtic-warrior.php|archivedate=2009-12-15}} < /ref >  On the advice of [[Bret Hart]], < ref name= " fsm " > {{cite web|url=http://www.sosofficial.com/fightingspirit.shtml|title=Fighting Spirit Magazine Interview|last=Denton|first=James|date=November 2006|work=[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]]|publisher=SOS Official|accessdate=2010-01-24}} < /ref >  Farrelly began training in [[Larry Sharpe (wrestler)|Larry Sharpe]]'s Monster Factory wrestling school in April 2002. < ref name= " slam " / >  Six weeks later he officially debuted as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] under the name Sheamus O'Shaunessy against [[Robert Pigeon]].

 Farrelly developed his wrestling character by drawing on [[Celtic mythology]]. He wanted to portray an [[Fianna|Irish warrior]]. < ref name= " fsm " / >  Going to a [[Gaelscoil]], Farelly grew up aware of [[Irish mythology|the four cycles of Irish mythology]] and  incorporated the sword and axe-wielding imagery into his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]]. < ref name= " ExpressNightOut " / > < ref name= " fsm " / >  This included the design of his own pendant, the crossos, which combines the [[Celtic cross]] with a [[Iron Age sword#Celtic swords|Celtic War sword]] to illustrate his character's  " indigenous origins with a hybrid of warrior strength matched with a strong ethical centre.

 ===Irish Whip Wrestling (2004–2006)=== 
 [[File:Sheamus O'Shaunessy Victory.jpg|thumb|left|Sheamus O'Shaunessy after retaining the IwW International Heavyweight Championship on November 14, 2005.]] 
 In May 2004, still using the ring name Sheamus O'Shaunessy, Farrelly returned to wrestling at the newly opened [[Irish Whip Wrestling]] (IWW) school in [[Dublin]]. He then made his debut match for the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] at their [[Mount Temple, County Westmeath|Mount Temple]] show on 9 July against Mark Burns, who he easily defeated. < ref name= " OfficialBio " > {{cite web|url=http://www.sosofficial.com/bio.shtml|title=The Celtic Wrestler's Biography|publisher=SOS Official|accessdate=2010-01-27}} < /ref >  He went on to win a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] the following month. 
 
 O'Shaunessy spent the rest of the year engaged in a rivalry with [[Vid Vain]] after losing to his tag team partner Joey Cabray the same night as winning the battle royal. He earned a place against [[Alex Shane]] in a guest match for the [[British Heavyweight Championship (XWA)|Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) British Heavyweight Championship]]. < ref name= " iww212 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result021204.html|title=Sarsfield, Lucan, County Dublin 02/12/04|publisher=[[Irish Whip Wrestling]]|accessdate=2010-01-24|archivedate=2008-04-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415111331/http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result021204.html}} < /ref >  Despite putting on a strong showing and being close to winning, his friend [[Red Vinny]] interfered in the match and cost him the championship. < ref name= " OfficialBio " / > 
 
 In March 2005 he avenged this loss by teaming with [[Scott Levy|Raven]] to defeat Shane and Vinny. This victory was part of a winning streak over the end of March where O'Shaunessy wrestled twice a day on 24, 25, 26 & nbsp;– including an 11 man Rumble win & nbsp;– and 27 March with a standard tag match and a ten-man tag team match. This series of victories, aside from one loss by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] to Vain, put him good stead for the one-day tournament held in [[County Kildare]] to crown the inaugural [[Irish Whip Wrestling International Heavyweight Championship|IWW International Heavyweight Champion]]. On March 28, O'Shaunessy put an end to his main rivalries when he defeated Vinny and then Vain in the quarter and semi finals, respectively. He met [[Darren Burridge]] in the final match and won to become IWW's first champion. < ref name= " abroad " > {{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/article230414.ece|title=Brits Abroad|last=Sibley|first=Adam|date=2007-05-24|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom))|The Sun]]|accessdate=2009-12-09}} < /ref >    
 
 O'Shaunessy's first successful title defence came against Burridge the following month but Burridge would not let his grudge rest, continuing to attack O'Shaunessy and finally costing him the title during a match against [[D'Lo Brown]] on 29 May. < ref name= " OfficialBio "  / >  O'Shaunessy earned revenge in July by defeating Burridge in a grudge match, < ref name= " iww2307 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result230705.html|title=The Moat Theatre, Naas, County Kildare 23/07/05|publisher=[[Irish Whip Wrestling]]|accessdate=2010-01-24|archivedate=2008-04-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415111407/http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result230705.html}} < /ref >  though lost to him in an [[arm wrestling]] contest the following day.

 After defending his title against [[Vampiro]] O'Shaunessy found himself embroiled in a new feud with rising [[Scotland|Scottish]] wrestling star  " Thee "  [[Drew Galloway]], whom he later admitted was his toughest opponent. < ref name= " ASW " / >  On 28 January 2006, he had his first championship match. < ref name= " iww2801 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result280106.html|title=Stillorgan, Dublin 28/01/06|publisher=[[Irish Whip Wrestling]]|accessdate=2009-12-10|archivedate=2007-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228131454/http://www.irishwhipwrestling.com/images/results/result280106.html}} < /ref >  The rivalry quickly took on a patriotic flavour, with Galloway's blue colours of Scotland clashing O'Shaunnesy's green colours of Ireland. < ref name= " ramblings " > {{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlersramblings.com/index.php/who-is-drew-mcintyre/|title=IwW promoter on WWE Superstar Drew McIntyre|last=Bullgod|first=The|publisher=Wrestler Ramblings|accessdate=2009-12-09|archive-date=2008-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204132613/http://www.wrestlersramblings.com/index.php/who-is-drew-mcintyre|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 ===British promotions (2005–2007)=== 
 O'Shaunessy travelled to [[Great Britain]] to make appearances on the [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|British independent circuit]].
