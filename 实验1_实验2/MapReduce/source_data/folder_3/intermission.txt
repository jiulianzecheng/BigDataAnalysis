An '''intermission''' or '''interval''' is a break in a performance of [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[opera]]. An intermission may be twenty minutes or longer: time for people to have a drink and time for the performers to relax.  Plays and operas are usually divided into [[act]]s.  The intermission will come where there is a suitable break between the acts.  There are a few operas (e.g. those by [[Richard Wagner]]) which are so long that there may be two intermissions.
