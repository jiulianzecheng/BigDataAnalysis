 A '''flame''' is the visible part of a [[fire]]. It gives light and heat. It is the result of an [[exothermic]] reaction. The [[color]] and [[temperature]] of a flame depend on the type of [[fuel]] that is used to make the fire. A blue or white flame is often very hot, while a red, orange, or yellow flame is less hot.
