 '''Acanthodii''' (sometimes called '''spiny sharks''') is a class of extinct [[fish]]es, having features of both bony fish ([[Osteichthyes]]) and cartilaginous fish ([[Chondrichthyes]]). They appeared in the early [[Silurian]] (430 mya) and lasted until the late [[Permian]] (250 mya). The earliest ancanthodians were marine, but during the [[Devonian]], freshwater species became predominant. They are distinguished in two respects: they were the first known jawed [[vertebrate]]s, and they had stout spines supporting their fins, fixed in place and non-movable (like a [[shark]]'s dorsal fin).
