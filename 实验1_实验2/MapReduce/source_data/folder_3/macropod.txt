 '''Macropods''' are [[marsupial]]s belonging to the family '''Macropodidae'''. That family includes [[kangaroo]]s, [[Wallaby|wallabies]], [[tree-kangaroo]]s, [[pademelon]]s, [[quokka]]s and others. They are [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] to [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and their surrounding islands. Before European settlement, there were about 65 species of macropods. Six species have since become [[extinct]]. Another 11 species have been greatly reduced in numbers. 
 
 ==Physical description== 
 
 Modern macropods are [[herbivores]]. They have specialized [[teeth]] made for grinding up fibrous plants. Macropods usually have a row of broad, straight front teeth, no canines, and a gap before their large molars.  
 
 The stomachs of the macropods contain lots of [[bacteria]] that help them to digest their food by breaking it down for them. Macropods have a certain blend of bacteria in their stomachs that lowers the amount of [[methane]] produced. 
 
 Macropods come in all different sizes. Almost all have a powerful tail and large back legs. The word 'macropod' comes from the Greek for 'large foot'. Their long legs allow macropods to move quickly, and for long distances. 
 
 [[Gestation]] lasts about one month. In larger species, it lasts a little longer. Usually a single [[offspring]] is born. It attaches itself to a teat inside the mother's pouch. The offspring is able to leave the pouch after 5-11 months. It is sexually mature at 1-3 years old, depending on the species. 
 
 ==Fossil record== 
 
 Marsupials evolved about 160 million years ago during the [[Jurassic period]]. They reached Australia in the [[Palaeocene]] about 50 million years ago. The oldest macropod fossil found is about 12 million years old.
