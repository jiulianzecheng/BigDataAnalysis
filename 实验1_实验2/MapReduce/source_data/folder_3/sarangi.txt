 The sarangi is named after the bow of Lord [[Vishnu]]. The word ''sarangi'' is a combination of two words: ''seh'' ('three' in Persian) and ''rangi'' ('coloured' in Persian) or Persian ''sad-rangi'', ''sad'' for 'hundred' in Persian ('hundred coloured) corrupted as ''sarangi''. The term ''seh-rangi'' represents the three melody strings. However, the most common folk etymology is that ''sarangi'' is derived from ''sol rang'' (means 'a hundred colours'). The name Solrong indicating its adaptability to many styles of vocal music, its flexible tunability, and its ability to produce a large palette of tonal colour and emotional nuance.
