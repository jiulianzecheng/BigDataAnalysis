 '''Miami''' is a [[city]] located on the [[southeast]]ern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. It is a known tourist stop and it is well known for its [[Cuban]], [[Puerto Rican]] and [[Haitian]] culture. Miami has one of the largest Hispanic communities in the United States, with over 70% of the population being of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] [[descent]]. Miami is also the [[county seat]] (and largest city) of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. 
 
 Miami is nicknamed  " The Magic City "  because of its rapid growth.  
 
 == History == 
 The [[Tequesta]] tribe lived in what is now Miami before Spain claimed it. In 1566, [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], Florida's first governor, claimed the area from the Tequesta for [[Spain]]. Spain ruled Florida until Spain gave it to the United States in 1821. [[Florida]] became a state in 1845. On July 28, 1896, Miami officially became a city. It was named after the [[Mayaimi]] tribe. 
 
 Miami experienced rapid growth during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. However, this land boom was affected by the [[1926 Miami hurricane]]. Many Cubans migrated to Miami after [[Fidel Castro]] rose to power in [[Cuba]] following the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 Cuban Revolution]], and the population rapidly increased. The majority of these Cuban immigrants now live in [[Little Havana]]. 
 
 During the 1980s, Miami was a primary location for [[drug trafficking]] from [[South America]], mainly [[Colombia]]. This brought in millions of dollars into the city's economy, and it allowed the construction of luxury hotels, [[skyscraper]]s, [[nightclub]]s and car dealerships. < ref > {{Cite web|title=City of Miami History|url=http://archive.miamigov.com/home/history.html#:~:text=The%20City%20was%20incorporated%20in,systems%20and%20a%20resort%20hotel. & text=Several%20years%20later%20John%20Collins,became%20promoters%20of%20Miami%20living.|url-status=live|access-date=March 30, 2021|website=archive.miamigov.com|archive-date=July 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210729013238/http://archive.miamigov.com/home/history.html#:~:text=The%20City%20was%20incorporated%20in,systems%20and%20a%20resort%20hotel. & text=Several%20years%20later%20John%20Collins,became%20promoters%20of%20Miami%20living.}} < /ref >
