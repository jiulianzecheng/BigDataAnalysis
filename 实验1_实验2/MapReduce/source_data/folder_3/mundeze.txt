 == Grammar (how to use the language) == 
 Each word in Mundeze comes from a smaller word called a ''root word''. A root word has a root and an ending.  
 
 Here are some of the endings: 
 * ''-e'' : single noun (objects and things). 
 * ''-y'' : plural noun (more than one object). 
 * ''-a'' : adjective (words that describe objects). 
 * ''-o'' : adverb (words that describe how to do an action). 
 * ''-i'' : verb (action word), infinitive (like to go, to see, to find). 
 
 * Conjugation is optional and it is done with adverbs: 
 ** ''pretempo'' or ''preo'': for the past 
 ** ''nutempo'' or ''nuo'': for the present 
 ** ''postempo'' or ''poso'': for the future 
 
 To indicate the aspect, there are three adverbs, which are added before the verb: 
 * ''jo'' for a finished action 
 * ''so'' for an action that is happening at the same moment the person is speaking 
 * ''vo'' for an action that will happen in the future
