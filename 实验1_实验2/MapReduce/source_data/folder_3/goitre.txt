 A '''goitre''' or '''goiter''' ([[Latin]]: ''struma''), also called a '''bronchocele''', is a [[inflammation|swelling]] in the [[neck]] (just below [[Adam's apple]] or [[larynx]]).  It happens when the thyroid gland gets larger (usually because [[Iodine deficiency|the body is not getting enough iodine]]). Goitre and associated [[Deaf-mute|deaf-muteism]] was widespread in [[Health in Switzerland|Switzerland]] until the 1920s, when [[iodised salt]] was introduced. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Goodman|first=Jonah|date=2023-11-30|title=A National Evil|language=en|volume=45|work=London Review of Books|issue=23|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n23/jonah-goodman/a-national-evil|access-date=2023-11-28|issn=0260-9592}} < /ref >

 == Classification == 
 Goitres are [[classification|classified]] in different ways (put into different categories):  
 
 * A ''diffuse goitre'' is a goitre that has spread through all of the thyroid.  A diffuse goitre can be a  " simple goitre "  or a  " multi nodular goitre. " 
 * ''Toxic goiter'' is a goitre with [[hyperthyroidism]].  These most commonly caused by [[Graves disease]], but they can also be caused by inflammation or a multinodular goitre. 
 * Any other type of goitre is called a ''non-toxic goitre''.  These may be caused by [[lithium]], some kinds of [[autoimmune]] diseases, or other problems.  People with non-toxic goiters have low thyroid levels ([[hypothyroidism]]) or normal thyroid levels. 
 
 == Causes == 
 
 Some of the causes of goitre include: 
 * [[Thyroid cancer]] 
 * [[Iodine]] deficiency (not having enough iodine in the body) 
 * [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] 
 * [[Graves-Basedow disease]] 
 * [[Congenital defect|Congenital]] hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism that babies have when they are born, caused by errors in the way the body makes thyroid [[hormone]]) 
 * [[Thyroiditis]] (inflammation of the thyroid gland) 
 * [[Side Effects|Side effects]] of certain medications 
 
 New research says that some people may be more vulnerable to goitre (more likely to have goiters) because they [[heredity|inherited]] that vulnerability (it was passed down to them from their parents). 
 
 == Famous goitre sufferers == 
 * Within two years of each other, [[President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and his wife [[Barbara Bush (First Lady)|Barbara Bush]] both were diagnosed with [[Graves disease]] and larger-than-normal thyroid glands.  President Bush's disease caused [[hyperthyroidism]] and cardiac dysrhythmia (irregular heart rate). < ref > [http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/t41.htm The Health and Medical History of President George Bush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209204013/http://www.doctorzebra.com/Prez/t41.htm |date=2007-12-09 }} DoctorZebra.com.
