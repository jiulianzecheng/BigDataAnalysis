'''Folate''' is a [[Vitamin B|B vitamin]], also called Bg or folacin. The man-made '''folic acid''' is a diet supplement which the body converts to folate. 
 
 Folate is essential for the body to make [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], and use the [[amino acids]] needed for [[cell division]]. So this particular chemical is truly essential for life. 
 
 Folate is got by eating leafy green vegetables, [[legume]]s and organ meats. < ref name=Cent2019 > {{cite journal |last1=Centeno Tablante |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Pachón |first2=Helena |last3=Guetterman |first3=Heather M |last4=Finkelstein |first4=Julia L |title=Fortification of wheat and maize flour with folic acid for population health outcomes |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=2019 |pages=CD012150 |date=1 July 2019 |issue=7 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012150.pub2|pmid=31257574 |pmc=6599881 }} < /ref >  When cooking, the advice is to use [[steaming]] or a [[microwave oven]].
