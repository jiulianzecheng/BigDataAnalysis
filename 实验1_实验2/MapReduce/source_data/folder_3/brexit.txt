 '''Brexit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|t|,_|ˈ|b|r|ɛ|g|z|ɪ|t}}) was a movement that promoted that the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) leave the [[European Union]] (EU). The name  " Brexit "  is a [[portmanteau]] (merging two words together) of  " British "  and  " exit " . 
 
 On 23 June 2016, the UK made a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum that asked whether the UK should leave the EU]]. The result was that 51.9% of the [[Electoral roll#United Kingdom|UK electorate]] (the main region of the UK) voted that the UK should leave the EU. The rest wanted the UK to stay in the EU. On 29 March 2017, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] said that they will definitely be leaving the EU.  This started the procedure of Article 50 of the [[Treaty on European Union]], a law that deals with countries that leave the EU.  The UK was expected to fully leave the EU on 29 March 2019 at 11{{nbsp}}p.m. [[UTC]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Brexit preparedness |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/brexit/brexit-preparedness_en|publisher=European Commission |access-date=24 April 2018}} < /ref >  The deadline to leave was later changed to 31 October 2019. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Tusk |first1=Donald |title=EU27/UK have agreed a flexible extension until 31 October.
