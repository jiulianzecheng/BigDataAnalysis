 '''Catfish''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[teleost]] [[fish]], the '''Siluriformes'''. There are about 40 [[Family (biology)|families]] in the order. 
 
 They are called catfish because their [[barbel]]s look like the [[whisker]]s of a [[cat]]. They are very diverse. The heaviest is the [[Mekong giant catfish]], up to  350 & nbsp;kg (770 & nbsp;lb). The longest is the [[wels catfish]], up to 4 & nbsp;m (13 & nbsp;ft). There are also [[detrivore]]s in the group. There are some tiny [[parasite|parasitic]] catfish called [[candiru]]. Some catfish are grown for food, in [[fish farm]]s. Some catfish can be kept in [[aquarium|aquaria]]. 
 
 == Special lifestyles == 
 Most catfish do not harm people, but some of them can cause problems. It is said that the candiru can enter the human [[urethra]], where they stay as [[parasites]]. In normal life they are parasites on fish [[gill]]s. 
 
 The Malapteruridae are a family of [[electric fish|electric catfish]]. Several species of the family can produce an [[electric shock]] of up to 350 [[volt]]s using electroplaques of an [[electric organ]]. < ref > [http://animaldiversity.org/site/accounts/information/Malapterurus_electricus.html Ng, Heok Hee 2000.
