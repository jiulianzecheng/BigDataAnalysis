 '''''Gryphaea''''' (the '''Devil's toenail''') is a [[genus]] of [[extinct]] [[oyster]]s which were once very common. Their fossils are common on the [[Jurassic Coast]] in southern England, and in the margins of the old [[Sundance Sea]] in the United States. It is a [[Marine biology|marine]] [[bivalve]] [[mollusc]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Gryphaeidae]].  
 
 These bivalves were at their peak in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods, when they sat in huge [[mud]]dy oyster beds in shallow tropical seas. The [[genus]] survived a long time, but went extinct about 34 million years ago (mya).  
 
 The oyster shell has two 'valves': a larger gnarly-shaped shell (the 'toenail') and a smaller, flattened shell, the 'lid'. < ref > Natural History Museum Picture Library.

The shells have prominent growth bands. The large curved shell sat in the mud on the sea floor.  
 
 == Where to find it == 
 In England at the coasts of [[Redcar]] and [[Weymouth]] in the [[Kimmeridgian clay]]; in the U.S.A in riverbanks and cliffs of [[Texas]] and [[Kansas]]. They are often washed out of the clay onto the [[beach]] or river banksides.
