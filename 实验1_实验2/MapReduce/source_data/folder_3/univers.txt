 '''Univers''' is the name of a [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] family designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]] and released in 1957. < ref > Meggs, Philip B. 1998. ''Meggs' history of graphic design''.  4th ed, John Wiley  &  Sons, p.361. ISBN|0-471-69902-0 < /ref >  It is sans-serif in a geometrical style. It was made in a huge range of weights and widths. < ref > {{cite book|title=Univers specimen book|date=1968|publisher=American Type Founders|url=https://archive.org/details/ATFFoundryUniversDebernyPeignotIP1968|access-date=18 September 2015}} < /ref >  Univers was based on a much earlier design of about 1898, called [[Akzidenz-Grotesk]]. 
 
 Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. By creating a matched range of styles and weights, Univers allowed documents to be created in one consistent typeface for all text documents. This matched the desire among practitioners of the [[International Typographic Style| " Swiss style "  of typography]] for neutral sans-serif typefaces avoiding artistic excesses. By  " excesses "  might be meant [[blackletter]], which had been used earlier in [[German language]] publications. But Univers also leaves out all the styling of the classical [[Latin script|Roman lettering]], including the use of [[serif]]s at the end of letter strokes. 
 
 One important influence was the coming of [[modernism]], with its rejection of [[tradition]] in favour of plain function. That is mentioned by most of the people who promoted Univers and other [[sans serif]] [[font]]s. < ref > Tschicold, Jan (1928) 2006. ''The new typography''. Berkeley: University of California Press. < /ref >  Critics of Univers critics point to its lack of character, and monotony when used (as it is) on a huge variety of printed forms.   
 
 Historian [[James Mosley]] has described it as  " probably the last major "  release of a large family as metal type. < ref name= " The Nymph and the Grot p9 " > {{cite book|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=The Nymph and the Grot|date=1999|location=London|page=9}} < /ref >  The font is available for photo[[typesetting]] and computer typesetting. It is marketed under licence by almost all outlets serving the print industry.
