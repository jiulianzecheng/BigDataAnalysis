 A '''hardback''', '''hardcover''', or '''hardbound''' [[book]] is one with stiff covers.  
 
 The covers are of rigid [[cardboard]]. They are usually covered with [[cloth]] or heavy [[paper]]. A heavy cloth like [[buckram]], or a [[leather]] is sometimes chosen.  
 
 It should have a flexible, [[sewing|sewn]] spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened. Less good is a [[glue]]d spine, because the glue gets worse with time.  
 
 Hardback books may be printed on [[acid-free paper]]. They are much more durable than [[paperback]]s. Paperbacks are often printed on cheap [[recycling|recycled]] paper, and have flexible, easily damaged paper covers. Hardback books are only slightly more costly to make, but are often much more expensive to buy.   
 
 Hardbacks may have artistic [[dust jacket]]s, or designs printed right on the board binding. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2009/06/in-praise-of-paper-over-board/ |title=In praise of paper-over-board |publisher=Publishing Perspectives |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2013-05-07}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |url=http://www.observer.com/2009/08/the-new-thing-books-without-jackets/ |title=The new thing: books without jackets |publisher=Observer |date= |accessdate=2013-05-07}} < /ref >
