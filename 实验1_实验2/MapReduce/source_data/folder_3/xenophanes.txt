 Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry, surviving as quotations by later Greek writers. To judge from these, his poetry criticized and [[satire|satirized]] a wide range of ideas. < ref > Barnes, Jonathan ''Early Greek philosophy''. p40 {{ISBN|0140444610}} < /ref >  This included [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], the belief in the [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[anthropomorphic]] [[deity|gods]] and the Greeks' love of [[Sport|athletics]] and athleticism. He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating  " fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives " . < ref > See {{Citation | surname=Dalby | given=Andrew | title=Rediscovering Homer | publisher=Norton | place=New York, London | year=2006 | isbn=0-393-05788-7 }} p123 < /ref > 
 
 == Philosophy == 
 Xenophanes' surviving writings display a [[skepticism]] that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC. He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries.  " Homer and Hesiod "  one fragment states,  " have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deception " . Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists. < ref > Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', I.289, and IX.192f. < /ref >   Xenophanes is quoted, memorably, in Clement of Alexandria, < ref > Clement, ''Miscellanies'' V.110 and VII.22. < /ref >  arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic: 
 < blockquote > But if cattle and horses and lions had hands < br / > or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do, < br / > horses like horses and cattle like cattle < br / > also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies < br / > of such a sort as the form they themselves have. < br / > ... < br / > [[Ethiopia]]ns say that their gods are snubnosed and black < br / > [[Thracians]] that they are pale and red-haired. < ref > Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16. < /ref > < /blockquote > 
 
 == Monotheist? == 
 His remark  " God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind " . < ref > Fairbanks, Arthur 1898. ''The first philosophers of Greece''. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, London. #57, p67. < /ref >  led some to claim he was the first [[monotheist]]. Others pointed out that he still referred to other gods.
