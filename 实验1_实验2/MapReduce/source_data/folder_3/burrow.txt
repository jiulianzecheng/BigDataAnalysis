 A '''burrow''' is a [[hole]] or [[tunnel]] in the [[ground]] made by an [[animal]]. Animals dig burrows to live in. Sometimes animals only use burrows for a short time. Many animals dig burrows. 
 
 There are many different kinds of burrows. Different kinds of animals make different kinds of burrows. Lots of [[mammal]]s make burrows. Some mammals that make burrows are [[mole]]s, [[Pocket gopher|gophers]], [[groundhog]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[meerkat]]s, and [[kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]]. The biggest mammal that makes a burrow is the [[polar bear]]. 
 
 Other kinds of animals that make burrows are: mammals, [[amphibian]]s, [[fish]] ([[lungfish]] < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Dubiel|first1=Russel|last2=Blodgett|last3=Bown|first3=Robert|last4=M|first4=Thomas|date=May 1987|title=Lungfish Burrows in the Upper Triassic Chinle and Dolores Formations , Colorado Plateau|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-sedimentary-petrology_1987-05_57_3/page/512|journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology|volume=57|pages=512–521}} < /ref > ), [[crustacean]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, small [[dinosaur]]s, < ref name= " VMK07 " > {{cite journal|last1=Varricchio|first1=David J.|last2=Martin|last3=J|first3=Anthony|last4=Katsura|first4=Yoshihiro|year=2007|title=First trace and body fossil evidence of a burrowing, denning dinosaur|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2006.0443|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=274|issue=1616|pages=1361–1368|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0443|pmc=2176205|pmid=17374596|accessdate=2007-03-22}} < /ref >  [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[worm]]s. 
 
 Burrows can be made in different [[material]]s. [[Kangaroo mouse|Kangaroo mice]] make burrows in [[sand]]. [[Termite]]s make burrows in [[wood]]. Some [[sea urchin]]s and [[clam]]s make burrows in [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Burrows can also be make in different shapes and sizes. Some burrows are simple [[tube]]s a few [[centimeter]]s long. Others are many tunnels and rooms that connect to each other. 
 
 Sometimes a burrow has a special name when it is made by a certain kind of animal. For example, a [[rabbit]]'s burrow is called a ''warren''.
