'''Procopius of Caesarea''' ({{lang-el|'''Προκόπιος ο Καισαρεύς'''}}, c. 500 – c. 565) was a prominent [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] scholar. He took part in the wars of the Emperor [[Justinian I]], and was the major historian of the 6th & nbsp;century & nbsp;AD, writing the ''Wars of Justinian'', the ''Buildings of Justinian'' and the celebrated ''Secret History''. He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient world. 
 
 == Writings == 
 The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the Roman emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]]. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books of the wars fought by [[Justinian I]], with information on Justinian's public works throughout the empire, and a book known as the ''Secret History'' (Greek: ''Anekdota'') that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his published history. 
 
 A number of historical novels based on Procopius' works (along with other sources) have been written, of which the best, ''Count Belisarius'', was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938.
