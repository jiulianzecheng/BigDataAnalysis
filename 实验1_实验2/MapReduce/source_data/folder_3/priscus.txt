 ==Biography== 
 Priscus was born between 410 and 420 AD in Panium (or Panion), [[Thrace]]. < ref name=ODB/ > < ref name=Chisholm/ >  He joined in 448/449 AD the Roman [[embassy]], led by Maximinus and speaking on behalf of Emperor Theodosius II, on a [[diplomacy|diplomatic mission]] to the court of [[Attila the Hun]]. < ref name=ODB/ > < ref name=Chisholm/ > < ref > {{harvnb|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=209}}. < /ref >  While he was there, Priscus met and spoke with a Greek [[trader]] dressed in Hunnic clothes who was captured in around 441–442 AD when the [[Huns]] [[Looting|pillaged]] the city of Viminacium in modern [[Serbia]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Halsall|1996}}; {{harvnb|Kelly|2004|p=176}}; {{harvnb|Toynbee|Myers|1948|p=14}}. < /ref > < ref name=Jones > {{harvnb|Jones|1964|p=866}}. < /ref >  The trader then told Priscus that he was a slave of a Hunnic [[Nobility|nobleman]] named Onegesius, but got his freedom and chose to live among the Huns. < ref name=Jones/ > < ref > {{harvnb|Halsall|1996}}. < /ref >  Priscus finally had a [[debate]] with the Greek defector about [[life]] and [[justice]] in both the Roman Empire and in [[barbarians|barbarian kingdoms]]. < ref name=ODB/ > 
 
 Priscus traveled to [[Rome]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Egypt]]. < ref name=ODB/ > < ref name=Chisholm/ >  In around 456 AD, he was with the staff of Euphemios as the ''magister officiorum'' of Emperor [[Marcian]]. < ref name=ODB/ >  Priscus died after 472 AD. < ref name=ODB/ > 
 
 ===Writings=== 
 Priscus wrote in the [[Greek language]] a history of the Byzantine Empire in eight books. < ref name=ODB/ > < ref name=Chisholm/ >  The books probably covered the time from the rise of Attila the Hun to the rise of Emperor Zeno, or from 433 up until 474 AD. < ref name=Chisholm/ >  Priscus was very influential in the empire and his books were used by different writers: Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (''Excerpta de Legationibus''), Evagrius Scholasticus, Cassiodorus, Jordanes, and [[author]] of the [[Suda]]. < ref name=ODB/ >  The style of Priscus's writing is direct and his work is considered a trustworthy account of Attila the Hun, his court, and the admission of the Roman ambassadors. < ref name=Chisholm/ >  Priscus relied on a style of [[historiography]] that was part of an ancient Greek tradition dating back to the 5th century BC. < ref > {{harvnb|Given|2014|p=xvii}}. < /ref >
