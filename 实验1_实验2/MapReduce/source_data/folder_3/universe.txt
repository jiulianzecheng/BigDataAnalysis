 [[Astronomer]]s use [[telescope]]s to look at very distant [[galaxies]]. This is how they see what the universe looked like a long time ago. The past tense is because the light from distant parts of the Universe takes a very long time to reach us. From these observations, it seems the [[physical law]]s and [[constant]]s of the universe have not changed. 
 
 Physicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the [[Big Bang]]. The size of the universe is not known. 
 
 == History == 
 {{Nature timeline}} 
 People have long had ideas about the universe. Most early ideas had the [[Earth]] at the centre of the universe. This is known as [[geocentrism]].  
 
 Some [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] thought that the universe has infinite space and has existed forever. They thought it had a set of [[celestial sphere]]s which corresponded to the fixed stars, the [[Sun]] and various [[planet]]s. The spheres circled about a round but unmoving [[Earth]]. 
 
 Over hundreds of years, better observations led to [[Copernicus]]'s [[Sun]]-centred model, known as [[heliocentrism]]. This was very controversial at the time, and was fought by religious authorities, most famously by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Christian church]] (see [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Galileo]]). 
 
 The invention of the [[telescope]] in the [[Netherlands]], 1608, was a very important moment in astronomy. By the middle of the 1800s, telescopes were good enough for other galaxies to be seen. The modern optical (uses visible light) telescope is still more advanced. Meanwhile, [[Isaac Newton]] improved the ideas of gravity and [[dynamics]] ([[equation]]s) and showed how the [[Solar System]] worked. 
 
 In the 1900s, better telescopes showed astronomers more about the universe. The Solar System is in a [[galaxy]] made of billions of stars, which we call the [[Milky Way]]. Other galaxies exist outside it, as far as we can see. This started a new kind of astronomy called [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], in which astronomers study what these galaxies are made of and how they are spread out. By measuring the [[redshift]] of galaxies, cosmologists soon discovered that the Universe is expanding (see: [[Hubble]]). 
 
 [[File:HubbleUltraDeepFieldwithScaleComparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|High-resolution image of the [[Hubble]] ultra deep field. It shows a variety of [[Galaxy|galaxies]], each made of [[wikt:billion|billion]]s of [[star]]s. The equivalent area of sky that the picture occupies is shown in the lower left corner (red box). The smallest, reddest galaxies, about 100, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been photographed. They formed shortly after the Big Bang.]] 
 
 === Big Bang === 
 The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the [[Big Bang]] theory, which says the Universe [[wikt:expanded|expanded]] from a [[Gravitational singularity|single point]] that held all the matter and energy of the Universe. There are many kinds of scientific evidence that support the Big Bang idea. Astronomers think that the Big Bang happened about 13.73 billion years ago. < ref > {{cite news|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=2008-03-09|title=Gauging Age of Universe Becomes More Precise|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/science/space/09cosmos.html|accessdate=2008-09-24}} < /ref >  this would make the universe 13.73 billion years old. Since then, the universe has expanded to be at least 93 billion [[light year]]s, or 8.80 {{E|26}} [[metre]]s, in [[diameter]]. It is still expanding right now, and the expansion is getting faster. 
 
 Astronomers are not sure what is causing the universe to expand. Because of this, they call the mysterious energy causing the expansion [[dark energy]]. By studying the expansion of the Universe, astronomers have also realized most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be observed by any scientific equipment we have. This matter has been named [[dark matter]]. Just to be clear, dark matter and energy have not been observed directly (that is why they are called 'dark'). However, many astronomers think they must exist: many astronomical observations would be hard to explain if they didn't. 
 
 Some parts of the universe are expanding even faster than the speed of light. This means the light will never be able to reach us here on Earth, so we will never be able to see these parts of the universe. We call the part of the universe we can see the [[observable universe]]. 
 
 == Myths == 
 The word ''universe'' comes from the [[Old French]] word ''univers'', which comes from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''. < ref > ''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p.3518. < /ref >  The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used. 
 
 A different theory is an early Greek model of the universe. In that model, all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth; according to [[Aristotle]], the rotation of the outermost sphere was [[wikt:responsible|responsible]] for the motion and change of everything within. It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the [[Earth]], because careful [[astronomy|astronomical]] and physical measurements are needed to prove otherwise. 
 
 The most common term for  " universe "  among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was ''το παν'' (The All), defined as all matter (''το ολον'') and all space (''το κενον''). < ref > Liddell and Scott, pp.1345–1346. < /ref > 
 
 === Broadest meaning === 
 The broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in ''De divisione naturae'' by the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[philosopher]] Johannes Scotus Eriugena, who defined it as simply everything: everything that exists and everything that does not exist. 
 
 === Definition as reality === 
 {{See also|Reality|Physics}} 
 
 Usually the universe is thought to be everything that exists, has existed, and will exist. < ref > {{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to cosmology|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000lidd|authors=Andrew Liddle, Jon Loveday|date=9 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-956084-4}} < /ref >  This definition says that the universe is made of two elements: [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]], together known as [[space-time]] or the [[vacuum]]; and [[matter]] and different forms of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] [[wikt:occupying|occupying]] [[space-time]]. The two kinds of elements behave according to [[physical law]]s, in which we describe how the elements interact. 
 
 A similar definition of the term ''universe'' is everything that exists at a single moment of time, such as the present or the beginning of time. 
 
 In [[Aristotle]]'s book ''The Physics'', Aristotle divided το ''παν'' (everything) into three roughly analogous elements: ''matter'' (the stuff of which the universe is made), ''form'' (the arrangement of that matter in space) and ''change'' (how matter is created, destroyed or altered in its properties, and similarly, how form is altered). [[Physical law]]s were the rules governing the properties of matter, form and their changes. Later philosophers such as [[Lucretius]], [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] altered or refined these divisions. For example, Averroes and Spinoza have ''active'' principles governing the universe which act on ''passive'' elements. 
 
 === Space-time definitions === 
 It is possible to form [[space-time]]s, each existing but not able to touch, move, or change ([[wikt:interact|interact]] with each other. The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the [[multiverse]]. < ref name= " EllisKS03 " > {{cite journal |last= Ellis G.F.R; Kirchner U.  &  Stoeger W.R. 2004 |title= Multiverses and physical cosmology |journal= Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |year= 2004 |volume= 347 |issue= 3 |pages= 921–936 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07261.x |arxiv= astro-ph/0305292 |bibcode= 2004MNRAS.347..921E |s2cid= 119028830 }} < /ref >  In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different [[dimension]]alities and [[topology|topologies]] of [[space-time]], different forms of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and different [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant]]s, although such possibilities are [[speculation]]s. 
 
 === Observable reality === 
 According to a still-more-restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected [[space-time]] that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa. 
 
 According to the [[general relativity|general idea of relativity]], some regions of [[Outer space|space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe, due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe would exist forever; space may expand faster than light can traverse it. 
 
 It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are; yet we can never interact with them, even in principle. Even with most of the visible universe, we cannot interact with it in practice. A relatively simple task, so it might seem, would be to communicate within our galaxy. Even if we knew how to send a message successfully, it would be well over 200,000 years before a reply could come back from the far end of the Milky Way, whose diameter is 100,000 [[light year]]s. galaxy. The spatial region which we can see is called the ''[[observable universe]]''.

 [[File:Cosmological composition.jpg|thumb|300px|The Universe is thought to be mostly made of [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]], neither of which are well understood right now. ''Less than 5% of the Universe is ordinary matter''.]] 
 [[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[elementary particle]]s from which the Universe is constructed. Six [[lepton]]s and six [[quark]]s comprise most of the [[matter]]; for example, the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are composed of quarks, and the ubiquitous [[electron]] is a lepton. These particles interact via the [[gauge boson]]s shown in the middle row, each corresponding to a particular type of gauge [[symmetry]]. The [[Higgs boson]] is believed to confer [[mass]] on the particles with which it is connected. The [[graviton]], a supposed gauge boson for [[gravity]], is not shown.]]

 The Universe has not been the same at all times in its history. Its getting bigger accounts for how Earth-bound people can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light-years away, even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey. The rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating, based on studies of Type Ia [[supernova]]e and other data.

 [[Special relativity]] holds in all the universe in local space and time. Otherwise, [[general relativity]] holds.

 == Theoretical models == 
 === General theory of relativity === 
 {{Main|General relativity|}} 
 
 Accurate predictions of the universe's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation. The best theory available is [[Albert Einstein]]'s general theory of relativity, which has passed all experimental tests so far. However, since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on ''cosmological'' length scales, general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate. Nevertheless, its predictions appear to be consistent with observations, so there is no reason to adopt another theory. 
 
 General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear [[partial differential equations]] for the spacetime metric ([[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]]) that must be solved from the distribution of [[mass-energy]] and [[momentum]] throughout the universe. Since these are unknown in exact detail, cosmological models have been based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density. The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales. 
 
 Einstein's field equations include a [[cosmological constant]] (Lamda: ''Λ''), < ref name= " einstein_1917 " > Einstein A. (1917).  " Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie " . ''Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Sitzungsberichte'' 1917 (part 1): 142–152.

 === Big Bang model === 
 {{Main|Big Bang|Nucleosynthesis}} 
 
 The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above, such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the universal ratio of hydrogen:helium atoms, and the ubiquitous, isotropic microwave radiation background. As noted above, the redshift arises from the [[metric expansion of space]]; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a [[photon]] traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental [[physical cosmology]]. 
 
 Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with [[nuclear physics]] and [[atomic physics]]. As the Universe expands, the energy density of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]], since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. Thus, although the energy density of the Universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was [[light]]. As the Universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the [[elementary particle]]s of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated era, stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s formed, which then associated into [[atomic nuclei]]. At this stage, the matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negative [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. [[Nuclear reaction]]s among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei, particularly [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], and [[helium]]. Eventually, the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation; at this point, the radiation decoupled from the matter, forming the ubiquitous, isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today. 
 [[File:Primordial nucleosynthesis.svg |thumb |250px |Chief nuclear reactions responsible for the relative amounts of light [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] observed in the Universe.]] 
 
 Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics. According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] was present in the universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter. Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing [[photon]]s, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated universe. 
 
 Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid [[cosmic inflation]] of the universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10 < sup > −35 < /sup >  seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the [[cosmological constant]] (''Λ'') is not zero, and that the net [[mass-energy]] content of the universe is dominated by a [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe's expansion. 
 
 === Multiverse hypothesis === 
 {{main|Multiverse}} 
 Some people think that there is more than one universe. They think that there is a set of universes called the multiverse.  
 
 By definition, there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another. The multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it. An idea that cannot be tested or is not based on logic is not science. It is not known if the multiverse is a scientific idea. 
 
 == Future == 
 This is a scientific topic called  " the ultimate fate of the universe " . It is a topic in [[cosmology]]. There are possible scenarios for its evolution. The basic issue is whether its existence is finite or infinite. 
 
 The future of the universe is a mystery. However, there are a couple of theories based on the possible shapes of the universe: < ref > {{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-will-universe-end|title=A big freeze, rip or crunch: how will the universe end? |last=Woollaston|first=Victoria|date=2016-10-10|magazine=Wired UK|access-date=2019-03-15|issn=1357-0978}} < /ref > 
 * If the universe is a closed sphere, it will stop expanding. The universe will do the opposite of that and become a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] for another [[Big Bang]]. This is the Big Crunch or Big Bounce theory. 
 * If the universe is an open sphere, it will speed up the expansion. After 22,000,000,000 (22 billion) years, the universe will [[wikt:Rip|rip]] [[Wikt:Apart|apart]] with the [[wikt:Force|force]]. This is the Big Rip theory. 
 * If the universe is flat, it will expand forever. All stars will lose their [[energy]].  
 *After a [[googol]] years, the [[black hole]]s will also be gone. This is the [[heat death of the universe]], or Big Freeze theory.   
 There is a consensus among [[cosmology|cosmologists]] that the [[shape of the universe]] is considered  " flat "  ([[parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]] stay parallel) and will continue to expand forever. < ref name= " Will the Universe expand forever " > {{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html|title=WMAP- Shape of the Universe|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}} < /ref > < ref name= " map.gsfc.nasa.gov " > {{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|title=WMAP- Fate of the Universe|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}} < /ref >
