 '''Madrid''' (pronounced: “mah-drid or /məˈdrɪd/) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city of [[Spain]]. Madrid is in the middle of Spain, in the [[Community of Madrid]]. The Community is a large area that includes the city as well as small towns and villages outside the city. 7 million people live in the Community. More than 3 million live in the city itself. It is the largest city of Spain and, at 655 m (2,100 & nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]], the second highest capital in [[Europe]] (after the [[Andorra]]n capital [[Andorra la Vella]]).  It is the second largest city in the European Union.  As it is the capital city, Madrid is where the [[monarch]] lives and also where the [[government]] meets. Madrid is the [[finance|financial]] centre of [[Spain]]. Many large [[business]]es have their main offices there. It has four important footballs teams, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Atlético Madrid]], Getafe, and Rayo Vallecano. People who live in Madrid are called madrileños.  
 
 Madrid was ruled by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s from the [[2nd century]]. After AD 711 it was occupied by the [[Moor]]s. In [[1083]] Spain was ruled again by Spaniards. [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] kings ruled the country. By the mid-[[16th century]] it had become the capital of a very large [[empire]]. Spain was ruled by monarchs from the [[House of Habsburg]], then the [[House of Bourbon]]. After the [[Spanish Civil War]] it was ruled by a dictator until the mid-[[1970]]s when it became a [[democracy]]. 
 
 Although it is a modern city, a lot of its history can be seen and felt as one walks along the streets and in the large [[town square|squares]] of the city. There are beautiful [[park]]s, famous buildings, [[art gallery|art galleries]] and [[concert hall]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Puerta_de_Alcal%C3%A1_2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Puerta de Alcalá]] 
 During the history of [[Spain]] many different people have lived there. The [[Phoenician]]s came in 1100 BC, followed by [[Carthaginian]]s, [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s, [[Vandals]], [[Visigoth]]s and [[Moor]]s. It was not until [[1492]], when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] got power, that Spain became a united country. [[Jew]]s and Moors, who had lived happily there for many years, were driven away. Spain became very rich because it conquered many overseas countries, especially in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. However, Spain fought many wars and lost much of its [[treasure]]. It was very poor in [[1936]] when the [[Civil War]] was fought. General Franco became a harsh [[dictator]] until [[1975]] when [[Juan Carlos I]] was brought back to Spain and made king. There is now a democratic government. 
 
 In [[prehistoric]] times people lived in the area which is now Madrid. The Romans lived there for several centuries. The origin of today’s city really starts in the [[9th century]] when Muhammad I had a small [[palace]] built where the Palacio Real stands today. The Moors built strong forts in Madrid in [[865]] and put a wall round the city. These walls stood until [[1476]] when they were knocked down. In [[1561]] [[Felipe I]] moved the royal court from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to Madrid. Madrid had now become the capital of a very large [[empire]]. Over the next years and [[decade]]s the [[Plaza Mayor]] was built and many great buildings and monuments, many of which still stand. 
 
 When [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella of Castile]] came to Madrid, Spain had become a very rich country. The [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th centuries]] are now known as the “Golden Century”. Their grandson was the famous [[Charles I of Spain]] (also known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]). He liked his court to be in [[Sevilla|Seville]]. His son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1527–1598) moved the [[court]] to Madrid in 1561.  
    
 In the late 1800s there was a revolt, known as the [[First Spanish Republic]]. Later the monarchy was restored, but then there was a [[Second Spanish Republic]] followed by the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The Second Spanish Republic started on 14 April 1931 and was celebrated in La puerta del Sol which is the center of the city. Madrid suffered a lot in this war. It was bombed by airplanes. 
 
 During the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], especially during the [[1960]]s, south Madrid became very industrialized, and many people from the [[rural]] areas moved to Madrid especially to the south east of the city. 
 
 When General Franco died and democracy was restored, Madrid became more prosperous. During the [[1980]]s and [[1990]]s many new buildings were put up. 
 
 Madrid has been attacked many times by [[terrorist]]s. This includes the [[bomb]]ing of [[El Descanso bombing|a restaurant]] in 1985, killing 18 people and the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|of trains]] in 2004, killing over 190 people. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Madrid has a borderline cold semi-arid climate (''BSk'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) and a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Most rain falls in [[autumn]] and [[spring]]. The [[winter]]s are cool because it is high up, and occasionally it [[snow]]s. The [[summer]]s are hot and dry. Often the temperature is above 30 & nbsp;°C (86 & nbsp;°F) in July and August and can often reach 40 & nbsp;°C (104 & nbsp;°F). At night it is much cooler. This is why many [[office]]s and [[business]]es are closed and people have a sleep ([[siesta]]) in the [[afternoon]] when it is hot. Then they come out again in late afternoon and often eat dinner late at night. 
 
 == Buildings in Madrid == 
 [[File:Palacio Real (Madrid) 07.jpg|thumb|Madrid Royal Palace]] 
 [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Spain's Royal Palace is in Madrid]]. It is one of the largest palaces in all of [[Western Europe]]. But the [[king]] and his family do not live there anymore; they live in a smaller palace, and only use the Royal Palace for important events, like meeting other kings and other official ceremonies. One can go inside the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] and learn about the history of Spanish monarchy. 
 
 Other famous buildings are: The [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]], the [[Temple of Debod]], the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabeú Stadium]] and the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area]]. 
 
 == Art galleries == 
 There are a lot of very big and important [[art]] [[museum]]s in Madrid. The most famous ones are the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Queen Sofia Museum]], and the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza museum]]. These show off paintings, [[sculpture]]s, and other works of art from some of the most famous artists in the world. 
 
 Many famous, important, and valuable works of art are in these museums. For example, the Queen Sofia museum has a famous painting by [[Pablo Picasso]], called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. Picasso painted this painting to show how sad and angry it made him when the [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi]]s destroyed a town in Spain called [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] in 1937. Picasso had said that the painting should never return to Spain until it was a [[democracy]] again. Once that happened, they built the Queen Sofia museum just to have a good place to put it. 
 
 == Other sights == 
 
 There are many other sights to see in Madrid. Many people go to see the [[Plaza Mayor]] which was a market place. The [[Plaza de la Villa]] was another famous market place. There are a lot of shops along the [[Gran Via]]. Real Madrid football fans celebrate at the Plaza de [[Cibeles]]. Two famous gates to see are the [[Puerta del Sol]] and the [[Puerta de Alcalá]]. A more recent landmark is the [[Almudena Cathedral]]. 
 
 Madrid has some lovely parks. The [[Retiro Park]] is the most famous. The [[Cristal Palace]] can be found in this park. 
 
 The [[Plaza de Toros]] is visited by many tourists. [[bullfighting|Bullfights]] take place there.
