 The word '''dictator''' or '''[[despot]]''' in modern times is used to describe the absolute ruler (other than a [[king]]) of a [[country]], who uses [[force]] and [[fear]] to keep himself and his friends in [[authority]], and can effectively make [[law]]s all by himself.  A country that is ruled by a dictator is called a ''[[dictatorship]]''.    
 
 The word  " dictator "  is from the [[Roman Republic]] where a man would be given absolute power for half a year or one year to handle an [[emergency]]. [[Julius Caesar]] was the last Roman Dictator.  
 
 Some dictators gained political power in a [[revolution]]. Some won an [[election]] and cancelled new elections once they took power. 
 
 It is not always clear whether a leader is a dictator or not. Some leaders got into power by elections, but sometimes they gave false election results. 
 [[File:Pol Pot.jpg|alt= < nowiki > [[Pol Pot]] served as the [[totalitarian]] leader of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] between 1976 and 1979, during which his [[communist]] regime killed an estimated 1.5 to 2 million Cambodians. < /nowiki > |thumb|[[Pol Pot]]]] 
 [[King]]s and [[emperor]]s often use force and fear too, but usually they are not called dictators.  This is because those [[monarch]]s have some reason for being in power (usually their father was king or emperor), but a dictator gained power himself. Also, when someone is king or emperor of a country, usually there were several kings or emperors before them. A dictator often creates the job of dictator by gaining power. The most brutal dictators in modern times were perhaps [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Hideki Tōjō|Hideki Tojo]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Kim Il-Sung]] and [[Pol Pot]].
