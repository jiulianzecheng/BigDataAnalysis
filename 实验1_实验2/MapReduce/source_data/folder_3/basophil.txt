 '''Basophils''', or '''basophil granulocytes''', are rare [[granulocyte]]s. < ref > Hoffbrand A.V. Pettit J.E. and Moss P.A.H. 2005. ''Essential haematology''. 4th ed, Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-632-05153-1}} < /ref >   If you had 10,000 white blood cells, only 1–30 of them would be basophils. 
 
 Basophils contain large [[cytoplasm]]ic granules. When stained, the granules hide the [[cell nucleus]] from sight. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two [[wiktionary:Lobe|lobe]]s. 
 
 The [[mast cell]], another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store [[histamine]], a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they come from different cell lines. Mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead stay in [[connective tissue]]. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils go from the [[blood]] into a tissue when needed. 
 
 The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are [[staining|stained]] by [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[dye]]s, as shown in the illustrations. 
 
 How they work is not well understood. Basophils have protein receptors on their [[cell membrane]] which binds IgE, an [[immunoglobulin]] involved in macro[[parasite]] defence and [[allergy]]. They are found in unusually high numbers at sites of [[ectoparasite]] infection, for example, by [[ticks]].
