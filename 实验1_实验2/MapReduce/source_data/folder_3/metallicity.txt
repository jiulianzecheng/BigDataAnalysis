 '''Metallicity''' is a term in [[astronomy]]. It means the amount of elements that are heavier than [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].  
 
 Most of the normal physical matter in the [[Universe]] is either hydrogen or helium. [[Astronomer]]s use the word '' " metals " '' as a convenient short term for '' " all elements except hydrogen and helium " ''. This is different from the usual chemical or physical definition of a [[metal]] as an electrically conducting solid.  
 
 [[Star]]s and [[nebula]]e with plenty of heavier elements are called  " metal-rich " , even though many of those elements are non-metals in [[chemistry]]. 
 
 The heavier elements come from [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Most elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the Universe ( " metals " ) are formed in the cores of stars. Over time, [[stellar wind]]s and [[supernova]]e put the metals into the surrounding environment, enriching the [[interstellar medium]]. There it is material for the [[Protostar|birth of new stars]]. Older generations of stars, which formed in the metal-poor early Universe, generally have lower metallicities than those of younger generations, which formed in a more metal-rich Universe.
