 '''Metabolism''' is the [[chemical reaction]]s which keep us alive. It happens in the cells of living [[organisms]]. 
 
 The chemical reactions are [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[enzyme]]s. Metabolism allows organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘metabolism’ can also refer to [[digestion]] and the transport of substances into and between different cells. 
 
 Metabolism is usually divided into two categories: 
 * [[Catabolism]] breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of [[cellular respiration]]. 
 * [[Anabolism]] uses energy to build [[molecules]] such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s. 
 
 The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like the [[Krebs cycle]]. One chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes. 
 
 The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds [[nutrition|nutritious]] and which [[poison]]ous. For example, some [[prokaryote]]s use [[hydrogen sulfide]] as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. < ref name= " Physiology1 " > {{cite journal |author=Friedrich C. |title=Physiology and genetics of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=39 |issue= |pages=235–89 |year=1998 |pmid=9328649 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60018-1 |series=Advances in Microbial Physiology |isbn=9780120277391}} < /ref >  The speed of metabolism, called the [[metabolic rate]], influences how much food an organism will need, and how it is able to get that food.  
 
 A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Pace N.R. |title=The universal nature of biochemistry |journal=Proc.
