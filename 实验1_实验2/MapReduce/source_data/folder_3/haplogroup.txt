This is haplogroup A, defined by mutation A.  < br/ > Later, a new mutation, mutation B, occurred in a person carrying haplogroup A. Mutation B defined haplogroup B. Haplogroup B is a subgroup of haplogroup A. Both haplogroups A and B are subgroups of the ancestral haplogroup]] 
 
 A '''haplogroup''' is a group of single [[chromosomes]], or single [[DNA]] strands, which share a [[common ancestor]]. They have the same [[mutation]] in all versions. < ref > The technical way of saying this is: they have the same [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) [[mutation]] in all [[haplotype]]s. < /ref >   
 
 Haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years. < ref > The International Society of Genetic Genealogy see Haplogroup definition in DNA--NEWBIE GLOSSARY [http://www.isogg.org/] < /ref > 
 
 In [[human genetics]], the haplogroups usually studied are [[Y-chromosome]] (Y-DNA) haplogroups and [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) haplogroups. Both can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed only from father to son, while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children. Neither [[recombination|recombines]], and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.
