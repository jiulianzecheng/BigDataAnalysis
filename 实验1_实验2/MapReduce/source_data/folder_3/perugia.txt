 '''Perugia''' (said  " Pah-ru-zha "  {{pronunciation|It-Perugia.ogg}}) is the capital [[city]] of the region of [[Umbria]] in central [[Italy]], near the [[Tiber]] River, and the capital of the [[province of Perugia]]. The city is about 100 miles (160 [[kilometre]]s) north of [[Rome]]. It covers a high hilltop and part of the [[valley]]s around the area.

 The history of Perugia goes back to the [[Roman Empire]]. However, major parts of the city have been destroyed, and rebuilt, because of many wars, and of [[earthquake]]s in the mid-19th century. In recent [[decade]]s, the city has been known as a [[university]] town, with the University of Perugia (about 34,000 students), the University for Foreigners (5,000 students), and some smaller colleges, also. There are annual festivals and events: the Eurochocolate Festival (October), the Umbria Jazz Festival, and the International Journalism Festival (in April). 
 
 Perugia is a well-known artistic center of Italy. The famous painter Pietro Vannucci, nicknamed [[Perugino]], came from Città della Pieve near Perugia. He decorated the local ''Sala del Cambio'' with a beautiful series of [[fresco]]es; eight of his pictures can also be seen in the National Gallery of Umbria. < ref > cf. ''Perugia'', Raffaele Rossi, Pietro Scarpellini, 1993 (Vol. 1, pg. 337, 344) < /ref >  Perugino was the teacher of [[Raphael]], < ref > " ...it appears most probable that he did not enter Perugino's studio till the end of 1499, as during the four or five years before that Perugino was mostly absent from his native city. The so-called Sketch Book of Raphael in the academy of Venice contains studies apparently from the cartoons of some of Perugino's Sistine frescoes, possibly done as practice in drawing.

Columbia University Press., 2003 < /ref >  the great [[Renaissance]] artist who produced five paintings in Perugia (today no longer in the city) < ref > The precise role of Raphael in Perugino's works, executed during his apprenticeship, is disputed by scholars. The independent works depicted in Perugia are: the ''Ansidei Madonna ''(taken by the French under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino in 1798), the Deposition by Raphael (''Pala Baglioni'', this masterpiece was expropriated by Scipione Borghese in 1608, cf. [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1330380,00.html ''The Guardian'', October 19, 2004]), the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints, by [[Raphael]] (formerly in the convent of St Anthony of Padua cf.[http://arthistory.about.com/od/special_exhibitions/l/bl_raphael_colonna_rev.htm The Colonna Altarpiece review at Art History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219111241/http://arthistory.about.com/od/special_exhibitions/l/bl_raphael_colonna_rev.htm |date=2007-12-19 }}), the ''Connestabile Madonna'' (this picture left Perugia in 1871, when Count Connestabile sold it to the emperor of Russia for £13,200, cf. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''), the Oddi altar by Raphael (requisitioned by the French in 1798) < /ref >  and one fresco. < ref name =  " severo " / >  Another famous painter, [[Pinturicchio]], lived in Perugia. [[Galeazzo Alessi]] is the most famous architect from Perugia. The city symbol is the [[griffin]], which can be seen in the form of [[commemorative plaque|plaques]] and [[statue]]s on buildings around the city. 
 
 == History == 
 Perugia was an [[Umbria]]n settlement < ref name= " Britannica " > " Perugia "  (2007). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved May 21, 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9059376 Encyclopædia Britannica Online] < /ref >  but first appears in written history as ''Perusia'', one of the twelve confederate cities of [[Etruria]]. < ref name= " Britannica " / >  It was first mentioned in [[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Q. Fabius Pictor's]] account, used by [[Livy]], of the expedition carried out against the Etruscans by [[Fabius Maximus Rullianus]] < ref > " How much of his glory is due to his kinsman, Fabius Pictor, the first historian of Rome, or to the family legends, which found in Etruria the most fitting scene for the exploits of the [[Fabius|great Fabian house]], we cannot tell "  (Walter W. How and Henry Devenish Leigh, ''A History of Rome to the Death of Caesar'' London:Longmans, Green 1898:112). < /ref >  in 310 or 309 & nbsp;BC. At that time, a thirty-year ''indutiae'' ([[truce]]) was agreed upon; < ref > Livy ix.37.12 < /ref >  however, in 295 & nbsp;BC, Perusia took part in the [[Samnite Wars|Third Samnite War]] and was reduced, with Volsinii and Arretium ([[Arezzo]]), to seek for peace in the following year. < ref > Livy ix.30.1-2, 31.1-3; ''indutiae'' with Volsinii, Perusia and Arretium, ix.37.4-5. < /ref > 
 [[File:Perugia panoramic.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Another view of central '''Perugia'''.]] 
 
 In 216 and 205 BC, Perugia assisted Rome in the [[Second Punic War]]. Little else is known until 41-40 BC, when Lucius Antonius (brother of [[Mark Antony]]) took refuge there, in the Roman civil war between Mark Antony and [[Octavian]]. Much of ancient Perugia was destroyed by Octavian (later became Emperor [[Augustus]]) after a long siege, and its senators were sent to their death. A number of lead [[bullet]]s used by slingers have been found in and around the city. < ref > cf. ''Corpus Inscr. Lat.'' xi. 1212 < /ref >  The city was burnt, we are told, with the exception of the temples of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] and [[Hera|Juno]]. The [[big|huge]] Etruscan terrace-walls, < ref > [http://www.perugiaonline.com/perugia_arcoetrusco.html Etruscan town walls]. < /ref >  naturally, can hardly have suffered at all. Afterward, the town, with the territory for a mile round, was allowed to be occupied by whoever came. It must have been rebuilt almost at once, for several bases of statues exist, inscribed with the [[word]]s '' " Augusto sacr(um) Perusia restituta " ''. However, the town did not become a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', until 251-253 AD, when it was resettled as ''Colonia Vibia Augusta Perusia'', under the emperor [[Trebonianus Gallus|C. Vibius Trebonianus Gallus]]. < ref > [[Latin]] inscriptions at two of the preserved Etruscan [[gate]]s. < /ref > 
 
 Perugia is hardly mentioned, except by the [[geographer]]s, until it was the only city in Umbria to resist [[Totila]], who captured it and laid the city waste in 547, after a long siege, apparently after the city's Byzantine garrison evacuated. Negotiations with the besieging forces fell to the city's [[bishop]], [[Herculanus of Perugia|Herculanus]], as representative of the townspeople. < ref > Patrick Amory, ''People and Identity in Ostrogothic Italy, 489-554'' pp185-86, referring to Perugia in passing, notes the increasingly localized role assumed since the mid-fifth century by the bishops. < /ref >  Totila is said to have ordered the bishop to be [[flayed]] and beheaded. St. Herculanus (Sant'Ercolano) later became the city's [[patron saint]]. < ref > Procopius, ''Bellum Gothicum'', 3 (7).2.35.2, characteristically does not mention the incident, reported in [[Gregory the Great]], [http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/gregory_03_dialogues_book3.htm#C13 ''Dialogues'', 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917040820/http://www.ccel.org/p/pearse/morefathers/gregory_03_dialogues_book3.htm#C13 |date=2009-09-17 }}, who imagines a seven-year siege (i.e. since 540, before the accession of [[Totila|Baduila]]) and dramatically reports Herculanus' grotesque murder. < /ref > 
 [[File:Umbria panorama.jpg|right|thumb|View of other hills around Perugia.]] 
 
 In the [[Lombards|Lombard]] period, Perugia is spoken of as one of the principal cities of Tuscia. < ref > Procopius of Caesarea, ''Gothic Wars'' I,16 and III,35. < /ref >  In the 9th century, with the consent of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], it passed under the popes; but by the 11th century its [[Medieval commune|commune]] was asserting itself, and for many centuries the city continued to maintain an independent life, warring against many of the neighbouring lands and cities: [[Foligno]], [[Assisi]], [[Spoleto]], [[Todi]], [[Siena]], [[Arezzo]], etc. In 1186, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], ''rex romanorum'' and future emperor, granted diplomatic recognition to the [[Roman consul|consular]] government of the city; afterward [[Pope Innocent III]], whose major aim was to give state dignity to the dominions having been constituting the [[Patrimonium Sancti Petri|patrimony of St. Peter]], acknowledged the validity of the imperial statement and recognized the established civic practices having the force of law. < ref name= " commune " > cf. ''Perugia'', Raffaele Rossi, Attilio Bartoli Angeli, Roberta Sottani 1993 (Vol. 1, pp. 120-140) < /ref > 
 [[File:Perugia-acquedotto01.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval aqueduct]] 
 
 On various occasions, the popes found [[Political asylum|asylum]], from the conflicts in Rome, within its walls, and it was the meeting-place of five [[Papal conclave|conclaves]] ([[Perugia Papacy]]), including those which elected [[Pope Honorius III|Honorius III]] (1216), [[Pope Clement IV|Clement IV]] (1285), [[Pope Celestine V|Celestine V]] (1294), and [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] (1305); the papal presence was characterized by a peace-time rule between the internal rivalries. < ref name= " commune " / >  But Perugia had no mind simply to serve the papal interests and never accepted papal sovereignty: the city used to exercise a jurisdiction over the members of the clergy. Also, in 1282, Perugia was [[excommunicate]]d due to a new military conflict against the Ghibellines regardless of a papal prohibition. In the other hand, side by side with the 13th-century bronze griffin of Perugia, above the door of the ''Palazzo dei Priori'' stands, as a Guelphic emblem, the [[lion]]: Perugia remained loyal for the most part to the Guelph party in the struggles of [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. However this dominant tendency was rather an anti-Germanic and Italian political [[strategy]]. < ref name= " commune " / >  The [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] presence in Italy appeared offer a counterpoise to papal powers: in 1319 Perugia declared the Angevin Saint Louis of Toulouse  " Protector of the city's sovereignty and of the Palazzo of its Priors " < ref > " Avvocato della Signoria cittadina e del Palazzo dei suoi Priori " < /ref >  and set his figure among the other patron saints above the rich doorway of the Palazzo dei Priori. At the half of the 14th century, Bartholus of Sassoferrato, who was a renowned [[jurist]], asserted that Perugia was dependent upon neither imperial nor papal support. < ref name= " commune " / >  In 1347, at the time of [[Cola di Rienzi|Rienzi's]] unfortunate enterprise in reviving the Roman Republic, Perugia sent ten [[ambassador]]s to pay him honour; and, when papal messengers sought to force it by foreign soldiers, or to exact contributions, they met with vigorous resistance, which broke into open warfare with [[Pope Urban V]] in 1369; in 1370 the noble party reached an agreement signing the [[treaty]] of [[Bologna]] and Perugia was forced to accept a papal legate; however the vicar-general of the Papal States, Gérard du Puy, Abbot of Marmoutier and nephew of [[Pope Gregory IX]], < ref > Made a cardinal by his uncle, 20 December 1375 ([http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/consistories-xiv.htm Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: XIV century]) < /ref >  was expelled by a popular uprising in 1375, and his fortification of Porta Sole was razed to the ground. < ref name =  " touring " / > 
 
 [[File:Palazzo-Priori-Perugia.jpg|thumb|Palazzo dei Priori: the center of communal government]] 
 Civic peace was constantly disturbed in the 14th century by struggles between the party representing the people (''Raspanti'') and the nobles (''Beccherini''). After the assassination in 1398 of [[Biordo Michelotti]], who had made himself lord of Perugia, the city became a pawn in the [[Italian Wars]], passing to [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] (1400), to [[Pope Boniface IX]] (1403), and to [[Ladislas of Naples]] (1408–14) before it settled into a period of sound governance under the ''[[Signoria]]'' of the [[condottiero]] [[Braccio da Montone]] (1416–24), who reached a concordance with the Papacy. Following mutual atrocities of the Oddi and the Baglioni families, power was at last concentrated in the Baglioni, who, though they had no legal position, defied all other authority, though their bloody internal squabbles culminated in a massacre, 14 July 1500. < ref name =  " touring " / >  [[Gian Paolo Baglioni]] was lured to Rome in 1520 and beheaded by [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]; and in 1540 Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was defeated by [[Pier Luigi Farnese]], and the city, captured and plundered by his soldiery, was deprived of its privileges. A citadel known as the ''Rocca Paolina'', after the name of [[Pope Paul III]] (Italian: Paolo), was built, to the designs of [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]]  " ''ad coercendam Perusinorum audaciam''. " < ref > " in order to bring to heel the audacious Perugini " . < /ref > 
 [[File:Rocca Paolina.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In the ''Rocca Paolina''.]] 
 In 1797, the city was conquered by French troops. On 4 February 1798, the ''Tiberina Republic'' was formed, with Perugia as the capital, and the French [[Flag of France|tricolour]] as flag. In 1799, the Tiberina Republic merged to the [[Roman Republic]]. 
 
 In 1832, 1838 and 1854, Perugia was hit by [[earthquake]]s. Following the collapse of the Roman republic of 1848-49, when the Rocca was in part demolished, < ref name= " touring " > cf. Touring Club Italiano, ''Guida d'Italia: Umbria'' (1966) < /ref >  it was seized in May 1849 by the Austrians. In June 1859, the people rebelled against the temporal authority of the Pope and established a provisional government, but the insurrection was quashed bloodily by [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] troops. < ref > cf.

 Perugia has become famous for [[chocolate]], mostly because of a single firm, [[Perugina]], whose [[Baci]] (kisses) are widely exported. < ref > Nestlè-Perugina produced in 2005 about 1.5 million Baci a day. Each October, Perugia has an annual chocolate festival called [[Eurochocolate]].
