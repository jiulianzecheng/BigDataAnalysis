A '''wing''' is the part of an [[animal]] or [[airplane]] that allows it to [[Flight|fly]]. 
 
 ==Animal wings== 
 A ''wing'' is the part of an [[animal]] that allows it to fly. By moving its wings, the animal can produce [[Lift (force)|lift]] and get off the ground. 
 
 Animals that have wings are [[insects]], [[bird]]s and [[bat]]s. Birds' wings are made of [[feather]]s. The wings of bats are made of [[skin]], which is stretched between the [[bone]]s of the bat's [[arm]]s and [[finger]]s. Not all insects and birds can fly, even if they have wings.

 *Airplanes also have wings. Those wings cannot be moved; they are stable, but the wings also produce lift, so the airplane will get off the ground if you move it fast enough. 
 
 *People also talk about wings of [[building]]s. What they mean is usually a part of the building that is separated from the rest (for example: the west wing of a building).
