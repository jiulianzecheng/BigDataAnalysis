 '''Sloths''' are Xenarthran [[mammal]]s from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. They are part of the order [[Pilosa]]. There are two families of sloths: [[two-toed sloth]] and [[three-toed sloth]]. Most scientists call these two families the '''Folivora''', while some call them the '''Phyllophaga'''. < ref > These names mean 'leaf-eater' in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] respectively. < /ref >  They live in trees, but in the past there were giant [[ground sloth]]s. 
 
 The [[Biogeography|biogeographic origins]] of the Pilosa is still unclear, but they can be traced back in [[South America]] as far as the early [[Tertiary]], about 60 million years ago. The presence of these animals in [[Central America]] is explained by the [[Great American Interchange]]. < ref > Gardner, Alfred 2005. Sloths.

 == Physical description == 
 Sloths are active at night and sleep curled up with their head placed between the arms and the feet drawn close together, or hanging upside down with the help of their hook- like claws. < ref name= " sloth " > Buskey, Theresa K. ''LIFEPAC History and Geography''. Alpha Omega Publications < /ref >  This disguises them as part of a tree so that its enemies like the [[jaguar]] do not see them. Sloths rarely climb down from the trees, and when they are on the ground they can only crawl awkwardly. < ref name= " sloth "  / >  However, when there is a forest flood, they are very good swimmers. < ref name= " sloth "  / >  Sloths can live for up to 30 years. They mostly just eat leaves and flowers, which take a very long time to digest. Sloths move slowly; their name comes from the word  " slow " .
