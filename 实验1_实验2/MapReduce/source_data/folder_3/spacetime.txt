 '''Spacetime''' or  '''space–time''' is a [[mathematical model]] that joins [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]] into a single idea called a '''continuum'''. This four-dimensional continuum is known as [[Minkowski spacetime|Minkowski space]].  
 
 Combining these two ideas helped [[cosmology]] to understand how the universe works on the big level (e.g. [[galaxies]]) and small level (e.g. [[atom]]s). 
 
 In non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], the use of [[Euclidean space]] instead of space–time is good, because time is treated as universal with a constant rate of passage which is independent of the state of motion of an observer.  
 
 But in a [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] universe, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space. This is because the observed rate at which time passes depends on an object's [[velocity]] relative to the observer. Also, the strength of any [[gravitational field]] slows the passage of time for an object ''as seen by an observer outside the field''.

 Wherever [[matter]] exists, it bends the [[geometry]] of spacetime. This results in a curved shape of space-time which can be understood as [[gravity]]. The white lines on the picture on the right represent the effect of [[mass]] on space-time. 
 
 In [[classical mechanics]], the use of spacetime is optional, as time is independent of motion in the three dimensions of Euclidean space. However, when a body is moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]] ([[theory of relativity|relativistic speeds]]), time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space. Time, from the point of view of a stationary observer, < ref > Einstein, Albert and Infeld, Leopold 1938. ''The evolution of physics: from early concept to relativity and quanta''. Cambridge University Press. < /ref >  depends on how close to the speed of light the object is moving. < ref name=Einstein26/ > 
 
 == Historical origin == 
 Many people link space-time with [[Albert Einstein]], who proposed [[special relativity]] in 1905. However, it was Einstein's teacher, [[Hermann Minkowski]], who suggested space-time, in a 1908 essay. < ref > [[Hermann Minkowski]], [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Raum_und_Zeit_(Minkowski)  " Raum und Zeit " ], 80. Versammlung 
 Deutscher Naturforscher (Köln, 1908). ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' '''10''' 104-111 (1909) and ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''18''' 75-88 (1909).  For an English translation, see Lorentz et al. (1952). < /ref >   
 His concept of [[Minkowski space]] is the earliest treatment of space and time as two aspects of a unified whole, which is the essence of [[special relativity]]. He hoped this new idea would clarify the theory of special relativity.  
 
 Minkowski spacetime is only accurate at describing [[constant velocity]]. It was Einstein, though, who discovered the curvature of space-time ([[gravity]]) in [[general relativity]]. In general relativity, Einstein generalized Minkowski space-time to include the effects of [[acceleration]]. Einstein discovered that the curvature in his [[4D|4-dimensional]] space-time representation was actually the cause of gravity.  
 
 The 1926 thirteenth edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]'' included an article by Einstein titled  " space–time " . < ref name=Einstein26 > [[Albert Einstein|Einstein, Albert]], 1926,  " [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1987141/Albert-Einstein-on-Space-Time Space-Time,] "  ''Encyclopedia Britannica'', 13th ed. < /ref > 
 
 === Literary background === 
 [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote an essay on cosmology titled ''[[:en:Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem|Eureka]]'' (1848) which said that  " space and duration are one " .  This is the first known instance of suggesting space and time to be different perceptions of one thing.  Poe arrived at this conclusion after approximately 90 pages of reasoning but employed no [[mathematics]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Poe| first = Edgar A.| authorlink= Edgar Allan Poe| title = Eureka: an essay on the material and spiritual universe | publisher = Hesperus Press Limited| date = 1848| location = | pages =| url =| doi =| isbn=1-84391-009-8 }} < /ref >    
 
 In 1895, [[H.G. Wells]] in his novel, ''The [[Time Machine]]'', wrote, “There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it”. He added, “Scientific people…know very well that Time is only a kind of Space”. < ref > {{cite book| last = Wells| first = H.G.| authorlink = H.G.

 == Spacetime in quantum mechanics == 
 In [[general relativity]], spacetime is thought of as smooth and continuous. However, in the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], spacetime is not always continuous.
