 '''Illyria''' (Ancient Greek: Ἰλλυρία, Illyría or Ἰλλυρίς, Illyrís) was an ancient region in the western part of today's Balkan Peninsula in modern-day Epirus, [[Greece]]. The people who lived there were called Illyrians and spoke the [[Illyrian languages]]. 
 
 The Illyrians settled in the Balkans approximately around 2500 BC along with other Indo Europeans. 
 
 The [[Illyrians]] became heavily romanised and a portion of them evolved into modern Albanians.
