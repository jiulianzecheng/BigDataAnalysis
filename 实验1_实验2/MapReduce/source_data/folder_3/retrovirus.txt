A '''retrovirus''' is any [[virus]] which copies itself as part of the cell's [[DNA]] by [[transcription (genetics)|reverse transcribing]] its [[RNA]].  Since the cell cannot proofread the step in which RNA is converted back to DNA, errors often go unnoticed.  This changes the exact sequence of a retrovirus' RNA frequently.  This makes it harder for retroviruses to be attacked by drugs. 
 
 [[HIV]] is a retrovirus, which makes it very difficult to overcome using drugs.
