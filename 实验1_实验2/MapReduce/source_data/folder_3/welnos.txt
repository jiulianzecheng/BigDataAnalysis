 '''Welnos''' is an [[Indo European god|Indo European deity]] linked to cattle, and there are similar gods in many mythologies such as Slavic, Lithuanian, Latvian, Norse, and Old English. This deity was reconstructed from the Slavic god [[Veles (god)|Veles]], Lithuanian god [[Veles (god)|Velnias]], and Latvian god [[Veles (god)|Velns]], who all protected flocks. The name of this god is also similar to Old Norse [[Ullr]] and Old English [[Ull|Wuldor]]. < ref name= " :0 " > [[Jaan Puhvel]], ''Analecta Indoeuropaea,'' (a collection of articles), publ. by Innsbrucker Beitrage zur Sprachwissenschaft, Innsbruck, 1981 < /ref > 
 
 Scholar Jaan Puhvel thought Welnos is also connected to the Elysian fields in [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] and ritual. 
 
 Some scholars, such as Max Muller, believed that Welnos, was related to Sanskrit Varuna and Greek [[Uranos|Ouranos]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/books/ComparativeMythology_10621627|title=Comparative Mythology|last=Müller|first=Max|pages=84|language=en}} < /ref >  However, this theory has been rejected because of language reasons, and the origin of the word is no longer accepted.. < ref > The Journal of Indo-European Studies, publ. by JIES, Washington, DC., 1973 and continuing < /ref > 
 
 Welnos may have been a kind [[sky father]] who represented the night while [[Dyēus]] represented the day and danger. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Marcílio Diniz da|date=2021-01-01|title=Notes on Proto-Celtic  & quot;Pantheon & quot; version 1.0|url=https://www.academia.edu/46084030}} < /ref >  He might have had a competition with [[Perkwunos]] like [[Perun]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]]. < ref > https://www.bib.irb.hr/988715/download/988715.Belaj_J_V.pdf < /ref >
