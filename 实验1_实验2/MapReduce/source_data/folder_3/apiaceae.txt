 '''Umbellifers''' ('''Umbelliferae'''/'''Apiaceae''') are [[angiosperm]]s including [[cumin]], [[parsley]], [[carrot]], [[coriander]]/[[cilantro]], [[dill]], [[caraway]], [[fennel]], [[parsnip]], [[celery]], [[anise]], and other relatives. It is a large family with about 300 [[genera]] and more than 3,000 [[species]]. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,700 [[species]] in 434 [[genus|genera]]. < ref name=Stevens > Stevens P.F. (2001 onwards). [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/ Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]. Version 9, June 2008. < /ref >  There are a small number of poisonous plants.  [[Hemlock]] has a [[paralysis|paralysing]] effect. There are a lot of phototoxic species. Light causes changes which produce toxic chemicals. Phototoxicity causes a chemically induced skin irritation. It needs light, and does not involve the [[immune system]]. It is a type of photosensitivity. 
 
 == Flower format == 
 The defining characteristic of the family is the [[inflorescence]]. The flowers usually grouped in terminal umbels, as shown in the photograph. They are usually compound, and called umbelliform cymes. They are groups of groups.
