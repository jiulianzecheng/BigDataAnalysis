 '''Terraforming''' is changing a [[planet]] or large [[natural satellite]] that we cannot live on at present without [[spacesuit]]s and similar technology. The idea is to change it so some life from Earth could exist there. It would need a suitable [[atmosphere]] (air), heat, and water.  " Paraterraforming "  or  " worldhousing "  is a variant of terraforming that would involve building domes over the majority of a planet or moon. 
 
 Some think it is possible to terraform [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]], our [[Moon]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Callisto]]. < ref > Oberg, James Edward 1981. ''New Earths: restructuring Earth and other planets''. Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, PA. < /ref > 
 
 It is arguable that we have already succeeded in terraforming right here on [[Earth]]. Thanks to modern technology, humans can now thrive in places that should be impossible to live in such as [[deserts]] and the [[Arctic]]. 
 
 
 A related concept is '''paraterraforming''' or '''worldhousing''' which would involve constructing [[greenhouse]]-style [[geodesic dome]]s and similar structures to cover most of, if not the entire surface of the planet or moon.
