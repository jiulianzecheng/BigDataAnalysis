 A '''rail train''', otherwise referred to as simply a '''train''', is a set of [[Railway track|railway]]{{efn|A railway is often call a railroad and is a path (track) with usually two [[steel]] [[Railroad rail|rails]] with one or two meters between them. Other types of track are possible, for example a [[monorail]] that one single track only.}} cars (also called vehicles) that are tied together with or without a [[locomotive]].{{efn|A [[locomotive]] (sometimes called a ''prime mover'' or an ''engine'') is a special vehicle that can move itself or other vehicles but does not carry things or people other than the people needed to drive it.}} < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of train (1a)|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/train|access-date=2022-10-27|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|quote=a connected line of railroad cars with or without a locomotive}} < /ref >  Trains are used to carry people, and also things like [[raw material]], [[finished goods]], [[cargo]], and [[waste]]. The vehicles that carry freight are called ''cars'' (in the [[United States]]) or ''wagons'' (in the [[United Kingdom]]). The ones that carry passengers are often called coaches or carriages. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a [[train station]] or [[railway station]]. 
 
 Trains have their roots in [[wagonway]]s, which used railway tracks and were [[Horsecar|powered by horses]] or [[Cable railway|pulled by cables]]. Following the invention of the [[steam locomotive]] in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. [[Rapid transit]] and [[tram]]s were first built in the late [[19th century]] to transport large numbers of people in and around cities. Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following [[World War II]], [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[electric locomotive]]s replaced steam as the means of motive power. Following the development of [[car]]s (coachwork types: [[coupe]], [[convertible]], [[fastback]], [[hatchback]], [[limousine]], [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan car]], [[station wagon]], [[minivan]], [[van]], and [[pickup truck]]), [[truck]]s (all types: [[box truck]], [[fire engine|fire engine truck]], [[Concrete mixer|concrete mixer truck]], [[cutaway van chassis]], [[tanker truck]], [[tow truck]], [[garbage truck]], [[sprinkler truck]], [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-truck]], and [[dump truck]]), and extensive networks of [[highway]]s which offered greater mobility, as well as faster [[fixed-wing aircraft]]s, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of [[bus]]es (all types: [[Coach bus]], [[Offroad bus]], [[Training bus]], [[Gyrobus]], [[High-floor bus]], [[Bi-articulated bus]], [[Police bus]], [[Guided bus]], [[Hybrid bus]], [[Type A School bus]], [[Type B School bus]], [[Type C School bus]], [[Type D School bus]], [[Shuttle bus]], [[Neighborhood bus]], [[Single-decker bus]], [[Articulated bus]], [[Minibus]], [[Minicoach]], [[Double-decker bus]], [[Single-decker bus]], and [[Low-floor bus]]) led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Austrian_horse_railway1.jpg|thumb|Historic tram pulled by a horse]] 
 Before steam trains there were ''wagonways'' where horses and people pulled cars over tracks made of stone and wood. < ref name= " Herring-p8 " > {{Cite Q|Q114992388|page=8}} < /ref > 
 
 A steam train made its first journey on 21 February 1804 at the Penydarren Iron Works in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, UK. < ref > {{Cite web|title=BBC - A History of the World - Object : Replica of Trevithick's steam locomotive|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/z2jlzH9gT0eDaubNNfiXIA|access-date=2022-03-18|website=www.bbc.co.uk}} < /ref > < ref name= " Nock-1975p4-7 " > {{Cite Q|Q114260807|pages=4-7}} < /ref >   The  locomotive ''Coalbrookdale'' was built by ''[[Richard Trevithick]]'' helped by the owner of the ironworks Samual Homfray. < ref name= " Nock-1975p4-7 " / > 
 
 The Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 showed how a train could be run. < ref name= " Ross2003-p6 > {{Cite Q|Q115184543|pages=6}} < /ref >  The Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830 was the first to run passenger trains and freight trains in the way that trains run on most railways today. < ref name= " Marshall975-p14 " > {{Cite Q|Q114966495|pages=14}} < /ref >  The use of trains were then to go from country to country over the world, and it was more easy for people and things to get from one place to another place. < ref name= " Ross2003-p6/ > 
 
 Soon after 1830 nearly all trains were pulled by steam locomotives. The steam engine was be the main way to run trains until the 1960s when many countries stopped using them, for example the United States of America had 38,853 steam engines in 1945 but by 1961 that was only 110. < ref name= " Marshall975-pp149-152 " > Marshall (1975). pp. 149, 152 < /ref > 
 
 As the [[internal combustion engine]] that used [[petroleum]] oil and [[diesel]] oil got better people tried to use those those, but they were not very successful at first. < ref name= " Flanagan2003 " > {{Cite Q|Q115119562|pages=7}} < /ref >  The year 1913 in Sweden was when the first successful in the world ran, and it was able to keep going until 1939. < ref name= " Marshall975-p150 " > Marshall (1975). p. 150 < /ref >   The 1920s saw diesel trains get better and by the 1930s diesel trains were going very fast, including the a German train going from Berlin to Hamburg at over {{Cvt|100|mph|kph}} and a train going from [[Denver]] to [[Chicago]], {{convert|1015|mi|km}} without stopping at an end-to-end speed of {{Convert|77|mph|kph}}. < ref name= " Marshall975-p150-2 " > Marshall (1975). pp. 150–152 < /ref > 
 
 While the first small railway run by electricity was in 1835 it was about after the 1890s when more electric railways and trains started across the world. < ref name= " Marshall975-p155-61 " > Marshall (1975). pp. 155–161 < /ref > 
 
 After [[World War 1]] there improvements in road cars and buses and people began to use them more than trains. < ref name= " Ross2003-p7 " > Ross (2003). p. 7 < /ref >   The same was true for how things were moved. < ref name= " Ross2003-p7 " / >   From the 1950s the aeroplane became a better way for people to go to some places that were further away. < ref name= " Ross2003-p7 " / >   Trains and railways had to get better to stop losing people and things to cars and aeroplanes but many have had to close. < ref name= " Ross2003-p7 " / > 
 
 == Types of train == 
 === Freight === 
 [[File:BNSF 5350 20040808 Prairie du Chien WI.jpg|thumb|right|Freight train hauled by diesel locomotives.]] 
 Freight trains have freight cars (US) or goods' wagons (UK) to carry goods from one place to another. Some are [[Boxcar|boxcars]] (closed and roofed cars for [[cargo]]); others are special so they can carry special cargo. There are hopper cars for sand, coal, ore and other granulous (sand-like) materials, flatbed cars for vehicles and machinery, [[tank car]]s for liquids, container cars for [[container]]s and even bottle cars for [[Iron|molten iron]]. Almost anything which is not too large to fit under tunnels and bridges can be transported on special freight cars.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 
 === Passenger === 
 Passenger trains have passenger cars (US) or coaches (UK), made so people can ride them from one [[train station]] to another.  Passenger trains are usually a very comfortable way of traveling.  Many trains have electrical outlets and [[Wi-Fi]] [[Hotspot (computers)|hotspots]] for computers and [[mobile device]]s. 
 
 Most passenger cars are single-deckers: there are also double-decker passenger cars, < ref name= " West2015-pp16-17 " > {{Cite Q|Q114970195|pages=16–17}} < /ref >  such as the Finnish Inter-City cars. 
 
 [[File:Railbus near Coleraine - geograph.org.uk - 2594126.jpg|thumb|Some trains look like a special [[bus]] that can only drive on rails.]] 
 
 The world's longest passenger train was {{Convert|1.9|km|mi}} long and had 100 cars.  It was a special train that ran in October 2022 in Switzerland. < ref > {{Cite news|title=World's longest passenger train rolls through Alps|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-63442530|access-date=2022-11-01}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Trains in the city ==== 
 [[File:Hope of a child.jpg|thumb|Busy train in Egypt (2019)]] 
 To get to a city and to move around it trains may need to carry many people and they can get very busy. There are many names for this type of train including ''rapid transit''. < ref name= " West2015-pp14-15 " > West (2015) pp. 14-15 < /ref >   The railway for these trains may go underground or be above the road. < ref name= " West2015-pp14-15 " / >   Trains which go along city roads are called ''[[Tram]]s''. < ref name= " West2015-pp18-19 " > West (2015) pp. 18-19 < /ref >  A new word for trams that also use tracks used by other trains outside the city is  < nowiki > ''' < /nowiki > tram-trains < nowiki > ''' < /nowiki > . < ref > {{Cite magazine|last=Nast|first=Condé|date=2019-11-24|title=The UK is on the verge of a radical tram-train revolution|language=en-GB|magazine=Wired UK|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tram-train-uk-sheffield-transport|access-date=2022-11-09|issn=1357-0978}} < /ref > 
 
 ====Trains that go far==== 
 There are few long-distance passenger trains in the [[United States]], but more in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 
 They may have a special car where you can eat. Sometimes there are also sleeping cars (passenger cars with [[bed]]s) for long overnight voyages. 
 
 ====Very fast trains==== 
 [[High-speed rail]] uses special, fast passenger trains on special tracks. < ref name= " West2015-p11-12 " > West (2015) pp. 11-12 < /ref >  A few of the fast ones are [[maglev train]]s, using magnets to hover slightly off the tracks to have less [[friction]]. < ref name= " West2015-pp22-23 " > West (2015) p. 22-23 < /ref > 
 
 == Crew == 
 * The '''driver''' or '''engineer''' makes sure the train works right, and speeds it up or slows it down. Usually a train needs a driver to make it run well, but a few are run by computer.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 * The '''guard''' or '''conductor''' makes sure the train goes the right way and tells the driver if he makes a mistake.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 * Only steam trains have a ''fireman''. He makes sure the fire that powers the steam locomotive is burning properly by putting [[coal]] into the fire.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 
 == Propulsion == 
 [[File:FEMRR Lima 2-8-0 No. 607.jpg|thumb|right|A steam locomotive.]] 
 Most trains are pulled by [[locomotive]]s.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} Before 1900, almost all were [[steam locomotive]]s. As this kind of [[steam engine]] uses very much [[fuel]] for the work it does,{{Fact|date=September 2022}} steam began to give way to [[diesel]] locomotives and [[electric locomotive]]s during the 1930s.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} Today, most locomotives are [[diesel-electric]] locomotives.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 
 Sometimes a train has no separate locomotive, but the prime mover (diesel engine or [[electric motor]]) is located on the first car of the train itself, and the car has engineer's cabin. The car is called a  " motor unit " .   Some trains have motors in many or all of the cars. This is called a [[diesel multiple unit]] or [[electric multiple unit]].  Usually, both ends of the train have engineer's cabins. These trains are especially popular in [[commuter]] traffic in large towns and cities. Electric trains get their power from a [[third rail]] or from overhead wires.{{Fact|date=September 2022}} 
 
 The [[fastest train]] in the world is a special type of train using [[maglev train|maglev]] propulsion, and it can reach {{Convert|600|kph|mph}}. < ref name= " JonesCNN " > {{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Ben|date=10 December 2021|title=Flying without wings: The World's fastest trains|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-fastest-trains-cmd|website=CNN|url-status=live|access-date=22 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221022160029/https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-fastest-trains-cmd/|archive-date=22 October 2022}} < /ref >
