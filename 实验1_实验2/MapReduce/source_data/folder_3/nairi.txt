 {{Cquote|The Nairi, when first attacked by the [[Assyria]]ns, had twenty-three cities, and as many kings; they were rich in horses and [[mule]]s and had so large a [[chariot]] force that we hear of a hundred and twenty chariots being taken from them in a single [[battle]]. < ref > Ancient Egypt - Page 167 by George Rawlinson, Arthur Gilman < /ref > }}
