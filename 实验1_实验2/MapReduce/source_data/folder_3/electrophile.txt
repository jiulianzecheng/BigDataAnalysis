[[File:Electrophilic addition of Br2.png|thumb|right|300px|In this addition reaction, [[bromine]] (Br < sub > 2 < /sub > ) is the electrophile]] 
 In [[chemistry]], an '''electrophile''' is a [[molecule]] or an [[atom]] that is happy to take [[electron]]s from another one. Many electrophiles have a positive charge. They are also called [[Lewis acid]]s. Some examples of electrophiles are molecules where the atoms have a big difference in [[electronegativity]], like [[HCl]] or a [[carbonyl]], or also [[oxidizing agent]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|title=electrophile {{!}} chemistry {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/electrophile|access-date=2021-11-30|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Electrophiles get attacked by a [[nucleophile]], which is the opposite kind of molecule. This happens for example in [[addition reaction]]s.
