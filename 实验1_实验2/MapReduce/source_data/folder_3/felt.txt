 '''Felt''' is a type of [[cloth]] or [[textile]]. It is a complex network of [[thread]]s or [[yarn]]s. They are pressed together usually when wet. This is ''matting'' [[wool]] [[fur|fibers]], with [[water]] and [[soap]]. It may also be made by [[Needle felting|poking the fibers]] with barbed [[needle]]s. Felt can be made by hand, or by [[machine]]. < ref > Tellier-Loumagne, Fran√ßoise 2008. ''The art of felt : inspirational designs, textures and surfaces''. London: Thames  &  Hudson.

 People have been making felt longer than any other kind of [[cloth|fabric]]. < ref > Barber E.J.W. 1991. ''Prehistoric Textiles: the development of cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, with special reference to the Aegean''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. < /ref >  Felt can be of any [[color]], and made into any [[shape]] or [[size]]. Felt is used to make many things like [[clothing]], [[hats]], and [[rug]]s. [[Nomadic people]] in many [[country|countries]] live in [[tent]]s made of felt. 
 
 Felt is used for many different things. Today  people use felt for [[hat]]-making, insulating (making warm), sound-proofing, and [[cushion]]ing. 
 
 ==Felt versus fabric==

 The difference between felt and most fabrics, like [[denim]], is that most fabrics have a regular criss-cross, in-and-out [[weaving]] pattern, but felt is a messy [[jumble]] of [[fiber]]s.  
 
 Most fabrics are woven for strength and smoothness: they need carding to straighten the fibers, spinning to turn fibers into long threads and weaving to make fabric.  
 
 Felt only needs a carding [[comb]]. Because of this, felt was often used by nomadic people.
