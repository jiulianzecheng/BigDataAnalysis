 '''QWOP''' is a [[Browser game|Flash game]] created by Bennett Foddy and released on the [[Internet]] in 2008 to his website called  " Foddy.net " . Players play as an athlete named  " Qwop " , who is participating in a 100-meter sprint event at the [[Olympic Games]]. Using only the Q, W, O and P keys, players must control the movement of the legs to make the character move forward. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/11/browser_game_pick_qwop_olympic.html|title=Browser Game Pick: QWOP (Benzido)|date=2008-11-07|accessdate=2010-12-25|archive-date=2010-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211101406/http://www.indiegames.com/blog/2008/11/browser_game_pick_qwop_olympic.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  When the player has successfully reached 50 meters they must jump a hurdle, and at 100 meters the player is encouraged to perform a [[long jump]], although simply passing the finish line is sufficient to complete the game.  
 
 The game has been criticized for being too hard to get good at. < ref > {{cite news | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideLifestyle.htm?f=2010/december/14/lifestyle2.isx & d=2010/december/14 | title=What's so hard about QWOP? | accessdate=2010-12-25 | author=Biado, Ed | date=2010-12-14 | publisher=Manila Standard Today }}{{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  In early December 2010, the game had a viral popularity outbreak after video blogger Ray William Johnson reviewed < ref > {{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ray William|title=GOOFY RUN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i2zaDSXhFM|work=3: RayWilliamJohnson's Channel|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=28 December 2010}} < /ref >  a YouTube video < ref > {{cite web|last=Cr1TiKaL (penguinz0)|title=The Most Difficult Game Ever Created Gameplay and Commentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmcMG4uxiHk|work=Cr1TiKaL's Channel|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=28 December 2010}} < /ref >  that annotates the game, becoming the subject of an [[Internet meme]]. < ref name =  " Web Search Interest: qwop " > {{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=qwop & date=today%201-m & cmpt=q|title=Web Search Interest: qwop|work=Google Insights for Search|accessdate=2010-12-25}} < /ref > < ref name= " Independent " > {{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/current-google-insights-trends-elizabeth-edwards-qwop-and-chrome-os-2159209.html | title=Current Google Insights trends: Elizabeth Edwards, QWOP and Chrome OS | accessdate=2011-08-14 | work=[[The Independent]] | archive-date=2011-10-26 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026233434/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/current-google-insights-trends-elizabeth-edwards-qwop-and-chrome-os-2159209.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name =  " Know Your Meme " > {{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/qwop-flash-game|title=QWOP Flash Game|publisher=Know Your Meme|accessdate=2011-08-14}} < /ref >  Despite this, the game helped Foddyâ€™s site reach 30 million views. < ref name =  " https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain " > {{cite magazine|last=Benenson|first=Fred|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain|title=Meet Bennett Foddy: The man behind QWOP and GIRP|magazine=Wired UK |publisher = Wired Magazine|accessdate=2011-08-14}} < /ref >  After the success of the game, Foddy created another flash game called  " GIRP " , which was released on his site in 2011. < ref name =  " https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain " > {{cite magazine|last=Benenson|first=Fred|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain|title=Meet Bennett Foddy: The man behind QWOP and GIRP|magazine=Wired UK |publisher = Wired Magazine|accessdate=2011-08-14}} < /ref >
