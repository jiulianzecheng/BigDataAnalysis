 '''Kickboxing''' is a descriptive [[term]] for [[martial arts]] that, while similar to [[boxing]], use the [[feet]] just like the [[hand]]s to hit. Kickboxing can be practiced for [[general health]], or as the [[fight]] [[sport]]. The word '''kickboxing''' represents a set of disciplines or [[sport]]s of combat that use the feet and the fists. Especially, kickboxing is one of the disciplines of ''[[Boxe pieds-poings]]'' which was developed at first by the [[Japan]]eses and afterwards by the North Americans. There are different kinds of kick boxing, most popular form is one where kicks are allowed towards head  &  torso only. 
 
 In the middle of the years 1960, the Japanese Kurosaki, who trained in [[Kyokushinkai]] Karate, travelled to [[Thailand]] discovering [[Thai boxing]]. In his returning to the [[Japan]] decided to combine his techniques of [[karate]] with that of Thai boxing, removing [[elbow strike]]s (the Americans also removed [[knee strike]]s), so a new sport called  " kickboxing "  was born.  
 
 Among the non-Japaneses that gained more successes, a special consideration should be given to Frenchman [[Christian Guillaume]] who in [[1969]] gained four victories and two draws; and American [[Benny Urquidez|Benny  " The Jet "  Urquidez]] who in [[1977]] defeated [[Tatsuyuki Suzuki]] in four rounds. [[Andrew Tate]] is also well known for Kickboxing in the I.S.K.A  
 
 In [[1973]] Urquidez and Howard Hanson created the W.K.A. (World Karate Association), changing years after the  " K "  de karate for that of Kick-Boxing.  
 
 The more known [[champion]]s are [[Rob Kaman]], [[Benny Urquidez]], [[Dennis Alexio]], [[Ernesto Hoost]], and [[Marek Piotrowski]].  
 
 == Rules == 
 The [[punch]]es and [[kick]]s are permitted for above the waist, the [[sweeping]]s and the ''[[low kick]]s'' (kicks to the [[thigh]]) also are permitted.  
 
 The  " amateur "  combats take place in three rounds, and the professional ones last five rounds; 10 in [[championship]]s of [[Europe]] and 12 in the [[championship]]s of the world, with a one-minute [[half-time]] (break) between rounds.  
 
 The kicks to the thigh (''low kick'') usually decide about the difference in the combats.  
 
 == Equipment == 
 Pants (long or short), [[boxing glove]]s and protectors for the teeth and for the [[genitals]]; in the female combats, women should also wear protector of chest and boots (not required in the professional combats).
