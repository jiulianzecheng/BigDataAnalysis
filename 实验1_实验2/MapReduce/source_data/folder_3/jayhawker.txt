 Another [[historian]] of the time described the jayhawkers as bands of men that were willing to fight, kill, and rob for a variety of motives that included defense against pro-slavery. They fought  " Border Ruffians "  raiding into Kansas. < ref > G.

 In 1890, the football team of the University of Kansas called themselves the  " Jayhawkers " . Later it was shortened to  " Jayhawk " .
