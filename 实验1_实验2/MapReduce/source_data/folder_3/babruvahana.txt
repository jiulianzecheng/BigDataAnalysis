 '''''Babruvahana''''' (also known as '''''Babhruvahana''''' or '''''Babhnu Vahana''''') is a character in Veda Vyasa's epic, the [[Mahabharata]]. He is one of the sons of [[Arjuna]], a Pandava. [[Chitrāngadā|Chitrangada]], the princess of [[Manipur]] was his mother. She bore him during the period of his (Arjuna's) exile at [[Manipur]]a (refer [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01217.htm Arjuna Vanavasa Parva of Mahabharata]). [[Arjuna]] leaves Chitrangada bercause  Arjuna's wife [[Uloopi]] from the [[Naga Kingdom|Naga Clan]] betrays him.  Uloopi was envious of Arjuna's marriage to Chitrangada. Babruvahana was adopted as the son of his maternal grandfather and reigned at [[Manipur]] as his successor. He dwelt there in a palace of great splendour, surrounded with wealth and signs of power. Later he came to know [[Arjuna]] was his father, and when he came to see his father, Arjuna did not recognise him and said he was a wanderer. He had a wife,Kimveka,from whom he had a son named Aarusha and a daughter named Aarushi.{{stub}}
