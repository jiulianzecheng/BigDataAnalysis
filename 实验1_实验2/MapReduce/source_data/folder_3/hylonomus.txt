 The lack of skull openings behind the eyes makes it difficult to decide whether or not it is a [[sauropsid]]. ''[[Westlothiana]]'' is older, but may have been an [[amphibian]], and ''[[Casineria]]'' is rather fragmentary.  
 
 ''Hylonomus'' was {{convert|20|cm|in|sigfig=1}} long (including the tail) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern [[lizard]]s. It had small sharp teeth and likely ate small invertebrates such as [[millipede]]s or early [[insect]]s. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 62|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 
 Fossils of ''Hylonomus'' have been found in the remains of fossilized [[club moss]] stumps in [[Joggins Fossil Cliffs]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada. The theory is that, after harsh weather, the club mosses would crash down. The stumps eventually hollow out. Small animals such as ''Hylonomus'', seeking shelter, might enter and become trapped, starving to death. Fossils of the basal [[pelycosaur]] ''[[Archaeothyris]]'' and the basal [[diapsid]] ''[[Petrolacosaurus]]'' are also found in the same region of Nova Scotia, higher up, dated about 6 million years later. < ref name= " TuninenHadly2004 " / > 
 
 Some fossilized footprints, from about 315 mya, have been found in [[New Brunswick]]. They are attributed to ''Hylonomus''. < ref > Falcon-Lang H.J., Benton M.J.  &  Stimson M. 2007.
