 '''''Salmonella''''' < ref > Salmonella is typically pronounced /ˌsælməˈnɛlə/ voicing the initial letter  " L, "  since it is named for pathologist Daniel Elmer Salmon. < /ref >  is a [[genus]] of [[bacteria]]. It is a major cause of illness throughout the world. The bacteria are generally passed on to humans by eating or drinking food of [[animal]] origin which has the bacteria in it, mainly [[meat]], [[poultry]], [[egg (food)|egg]]s and [[milk]]. Bacteria from the genus ''Salmonella'' can cause diseases, such as [[diarrhea]], [[cholera]] and [[typhus]]. These bacteria are [[zoonosis|zoonotic]], meaning they can infect both animals and humans.  
 
 ''Salmonella'' is closely related to the ''[[Escherichia]]'' genus and are found worldwide in cold- and warm-blooded animals (including humans), and in the environment. They cause illnesses like typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and [[foodborne illness]]. < ref name= " Sherris " > {{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi00kjry/page/n379 362]–8}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Salmonella'' is also extremely dangerous, and like most diseases, weaker humans like the old and young could easily die from it. ''Salmonella'' can only be killed in food by cooking at high [[temperatures]]. This is called denaturation.
