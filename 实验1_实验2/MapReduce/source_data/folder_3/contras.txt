The '''contras''' is the name given to the rebel groups that were active from 1979 through to the early 1990s. They were against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] government in [[Nicaragua]]. Among the separate contra groups, the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]] (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]]. 
 
 From an early stage, the rebels received financial and military support from the [[United States|U.S. government]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] supported the group. After the U.S. support was banned by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the Reagan administration secretly gave them money from profit they gained after selling weapons to [[Iran]]. These secret activities soon became known as the [[Iran–Contra affair]].
