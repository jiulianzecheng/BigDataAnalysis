 '''''Smosh''''' is a [[Internet|web-based]] [[comedy]] duo. The members are '''Ian Hecox''' and '''Anthony Padilla''' who have been on YouTube since 2005. Today they have over 5 different channels, over 300 videos on their main channel and over 10 million subscribers. 
 
 ==History== 
 Smosh started as early as 2001 when Anthony created a website named smosh.com and started adding flash videos. Shortly after Ian joined him. 
 
 They both started their famous YouTube channel Smosh in November 2005 uploading the Pokemon Theme Song which eventually gained 25 million views which was, at the time, the most viewed video on YouTube, however six months later into the fame the video was removed for copyright reasons. 
 
 Later on in March 2007 though, a user named Andi2000 re-uploaded the video and today, it has 15 million views. Smosh also re-made the video in November 2010 changing the lyrics a little bit so it wouldn't be removed again. 
 
 In 2009 smosh.com had a major redesign. Adding a games section and an extras and bloopers for their skit. 2010 also a new iSHUT UP app available on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] and three new web-series': Ask Charlie, Lunchtime with Smosh and Ian is Bored. 
 
 In January 2013 Smosh became the most subscribed channel on the internet beating Ray William Johnson. 
 
 Nowadays, their skits are more general and advanced.
