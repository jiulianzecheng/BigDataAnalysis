[[File:Saccharose.svg|thumb|right|250px|Sucrose, a common disaccharide]] 
 A '''disaccharide''' is a [[sugar]] (a [[carbohydrate]]) composed of two [[monosaccharide]]s, such as glucose and fructose that make up the disaccharide sucrose. It is formed when two sugars are joined together and a molecule of water is removed. Due to this, disaccharides cannot hydrolyse, meaning their molecules are unable to be broken down through a reaction with water. For example, milk sugar ([[lactose]]) is made from [[glucose]] and [[galactose]] whereas cane sugar ([[sucrose]]) is made from [[glucose]] and [[fructose]].

 Maltose and cellobiose are [[hydrolysis]] products of the [[polysaccharide]]s, [[starch]] and [[cellulose]], respectively. 
 Some common Disaccharides are:  [[Maltose]], [[Lactose]] and [[Sucrose]].
