 '''Rhinovirus''' is the most common [[virus]] in humans, and the main cause of the [[common cold]]. It is called 'rhinovirus' because it infects the nose. < ref > " rhino- "  from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for  " nose " < /ref >  The symptoms are very well known, and affect the whole of the upper [[respiratory system|respiratory tract]], that is, the nose down to the [[throat]]. Children may get six to twelve colds a year. < ref > Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia.  " rhinovirus " . Encyclopedia Britannica, Invalid Date, https://www.britannica.com/science/rhinovirus. Accessed 25 December 2021. < /ref > 
 
 The temperature most suitable for its survival is between 33 ℃ to 35 ℃. This may explain why it is found in the nose, because the nasal cavity is be open to the outside air. < ref > Ellen F. Foxmana ''et al'' 2014. Temperature-dependent innate defense against the common cold virus limits viral replication at warm temperature in mouse airway cells. ''PNAS'' ID 112 (3): 827–832.

 There are 99 types of rhinovirus, according to their surface proteins. The rhinovirus particles are only 30[[nanometre|nm]] in [[diameter]]. This is much smaller than other viruses: many are ten times larger.
