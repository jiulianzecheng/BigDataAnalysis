 '''Uriel''' ({{lang-he-n|'''אוּרִיאֵל'''}}, {{lang-el|'''Ουριήλ'''}}, {{lang-cop|'''ⲟⲩⲣⲓⲏⲗ'''}}, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://marcion.sourceforge.net/nag-hammadi-library/apocryphon-of-john-nh2-en.html |title=The Apocryphon of John |date=1 April 2011 |website=marcion.sourceforge.net |access-date=12 December 2017 }} < /ref >  meaning “God is my light” or “fire of God”) is an [[archangel]] in [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions. The [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Anglicans]] call him “Saint Uriel the Archangel” or simply “Saint Uriel”. 
 
 == In Judaism and Christianity == 
 The [[Roman Catholic Church]] only recognizes three archangels which are mentioned in the [[Bible]]: [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Gabriel]] and [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]]. But according to the certain rabbinic and Christian traditions, there are four or even seven archangels, Uriel is generally the fourth. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14606-uriel |title=URIEL |author=Isidore Singer, Ludwig Blau |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |access-date=11 December 2017}} < /ref >  In the Deuterocanonical book [[2 Esdras]], Uriel is sent by God to answer the questions which are asked by [[Ezra]]. 
 
 The role of Uriel in Christian [[Apocrypha|apocryphal]] traditions is different from answering Ezra's questions. He is said to have rescued [[John the Baptist]] from the Massacre of the Innocents(the murder of all boys under the age of two in the area of Bethlehem) as a child and reunited him and his mother Saint Elizabeth with John's cousin, Jesus. This is shown in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting ''Virgin of the Rocks.'' 
 
 Uriel is often described as a cherub and the angel of repentance < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2019-06-02|title=Books of Adam|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Books_of_Adam & oldid=899907361|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}} < /ref >   and is the angel at the Gate of Eden. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Teaching of the Catholic Church|last=Vonier|first=Anscar|year=1964}} < /ref >  In ''The Apocalypse of Peter'', Uriel is shown to be as cruel as any demon when enforcing repentance. He is also supposed to be one of the angels that buried Adam and Abel in Eden.
