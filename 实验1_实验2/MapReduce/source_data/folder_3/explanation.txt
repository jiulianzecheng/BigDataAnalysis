An '''explanation''' is an attempt to [[wikt:answer|answer]] the [[question]]  " why " . Asked of a person, it is a question about [[motivation|motive]]:  " why did you do this? " . Asked of a natural event, it is a question about natural causes ([[causality|causation]]). 
 
 In science, an explanation is the link between an [[event]] which is a [[wikt:cause|cause]], and a second event, which is an [[wikt:effect|effect]]. The phrase  " [[cause and effect]] "  refers to this. The relationship between the two events is known as [[causality]]. The philosopher Mario Bunge said,  " We do not rest content with finding facts but wish to know why they should occur rather than not " . < ref > Bunge, Mario 1967. ''Scientific research II: the search for truth''. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. Chapter 9: Explanation. < /ref > 
 
 As a general rule, explanations move from what we know to what we do not know. This is important because it explains why different kinds of people may need different explanations.  " A child, a lay person and an expert may need different explanations of the same thing, since what is already familiar to them will differ " . < ref > Lacey A.R. 1970. ''A dictionary of philosophy''. London: Routledge  &  Kegan Paul, p64. {{ISBN|0-7100-8362-9}} < /ref > 
 
 The asking of questions depends on [[language]], and is peculiar to humans. It starts very soon after a child learns how to speak. A kind of game which young children play with adults is the 'why game'. Every parent gets the experience of their child asking a never-ending stream of why questions, until at last the adult says  " Well, it just '''''is!''''' " 
 
 There can be plenty of argument about whether or not an explanation is appropriate, and if so, whether it is correct. If one asks why the sun gives out heat and light, to say  " because it is daytime "  is not appropriate, even if it might indeed be daytime. The real answer was not known until the 20th century. < ref > [[Nuclear fusion]] in the Sun turns [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]], resulting in the production of energy in the form of [[radiation]]. < /ref >  Before then peoples like the [[ancient Egypt]]ians thought it was caused by a god ([[Aten]]). 
 
 == Types == 
 Different kinds of why questions need different kinds of explanations.  including: 
 
 === General explanations === 
 These add something to human [[knowledge]]. 
 * explanations which are based on a principle or theory. < ref > Achinstein, Peter 1971. ''Law and explanation: an essay in the philosophy of science''. Oxford University Press, chapter IV Explanation, p61. {{ISBN|0-19-858208-0}} < /ref > 
 :: " It is often said that a key difference between historians and political scientists is that historians tend to construct narrative-based explanations while political scientists ... tend to construct theory-based explanations " . < ref name= " Elman71 " > Elman, Colin. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1q8Frx25Y4wC & pg=PA71 & dq= ''Bridges and boundaries: historians, political scientists, and the study of international relations.'' p71] < /ref > 
 
 === Personal explanations === 
 A personal question like  " Why did you do that? "  clearly asks for an explanation. What that explanation might be depends on [[context]]: it all depends on [[wikt:Circumstance|circumstance]]. < ref name=Keil > Keil, Frank C. and  Wilson, Robert Andrew. 2000. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k703lFAZby8C & pg=PA6 & dq=  ''Explanation and cognition.'' p6] < /ref >  This type of question about motives only applies to the people concerned. 
 * explanations which relate to [[goal]]s or [[wikt:purpose|purposes]].  
 ::''Why are you doing that?'' Explanation: ''Because I'm going to build a boat''. 
 
 Many kinds of explanations are made up of more than one type. An explanation can be [[wikt:valid|valid]] or [[wikt:invalid|invalid]] or a [[wikt:combination|combination]] of both. Some explanations may appear reasonable, but turn out to be misleading or wrong. < ref > Blakesley, David and Hoogeveen, Jeffrey L. 2007. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qavqk92uRGYC & pg=PA209 & dq=  ''The Thomson Handbook'']. Blackwell, Oxford, p209. {{ISBN|9781428205031}} < /ref >
