 '''Mustelids''' are a family of [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]]s. They are the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Mustelidae''', in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. 
 
 They are the largest family of mammals. They are diverse, from [[weasel]]s who eat [[mouse|mice]] to [[wolverine]]s that can kill prey much larger than themselves. Mustelids live in many [[habitats]]: [[otter]]s for example, live mostly in the water, while one species of weasel lives in the [[Arctic]]. 
 
 One kind of mustelid, the [[ferret]], has been tamed and used for hunting for a long time. These days it is mostly kept as a [[pet]]. Because the ferret looks a bit like a [[rat]] that has been stretched out in the middle, it is sometimes called a tube rat. 
 
 These are other well-known animals from the mustelid family.
