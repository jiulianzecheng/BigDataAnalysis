 The '''Peppermint''' is a [[hybrid]] [[plant]] of the [[Mentha|mint]] family. It is originally from [[Europe]], but grown and sold all over the world. It is a hybrid of [[watermint]] and [[spearmint]]. [[Carolus Linnaeus]] first described the plant in 1753, from samples that had been collected in England. He treated it as a [[species]], < ref name=cl > Linnaeus, C. (1753). ''Species Plantarum'' 2: 576–577. < /ref >   but [[wikt:modern|modern]] [[biology]] mostly treats it as a hybrid. < ref name=harley > Harley, R. M. (1975). ''Mentha'' L. In: Stace, C. A., ed. ''Hybridization and the flora of the British Isles'' page 387. < /ref > 
 
 The peppermint is found in some [[medication]]s, in particular [[Victor Skumin#Skumin’s mixture|Skumin’s mixture]].
