 Singapore had its international airport at [[Kallang Airport|Kallang]] and [[Paya Lebar Airport|Paya Lebar]]. But it expanded so rapidly that the Singapore government worried about having not enough space for airport to grow bigger. There were many proposals for a new location and the Singapore government chose Changi in the end.
