 == Early life == 
 Avicenna was born near [[Bukhara]], < ref name= " britannica "  / >  which at the time was ruled by [[Samanid dynasty]]. His father was a government official and his home served as a meeting place for men of learning. Avicenna had educated teachers while growing up. By age 14, he had mastered many subjects and had already memorized the [[Quran]]. From the age of 14 to 18, he taught himself because he could not find a tutor to provide more information than he already knew. He began to practice and learn about [[medicine]] at 16. He also learned about [[law]] and [[natural sciences]]. He was good at all subjects but decided medicine was easier for him than [[mathematics]] or [[metaphysics]]. Sometime before he turned 18 years old, he cured a Samanid [[emir]]. Because of his he was allowed into the royal libraries of the [[Samanid dynasty]]. By the age of 18, he had become a master of the most important works of science in his time. Also, his reputation as a doctor had grown. < ref > Sizgorich, Tom.  " Avicenna. "  World History: Ancient and Medieval Eras. ABC-CLIO, 2013. Web. 27 Feb. 2013. < /ref >  At 20, he was regarded as one of the wisest people of his time. < ref > Ramsey, Matthew.  " Avicenna.

 == Writings == 
 Besides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's works includes writings on [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]], [[geography]] and [[geology]], [[psychology]], [[Islamic theology]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[poetry]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-index |title=Avicenna " , in Encyclopædia Iranica, Online Version 2006 |publisher=Iranica.com |access-date=2010-01-19}} < /ref > < ref > Charles F.

 {{quote| " Avicenna (973-1037) was a sort of ''universal genius'', known first as a physician. To his works on medicine he afterward added religious tracts, poems, works on philosophy, on logic, as physics, on mathematics, and on astronomy.}} < /ref > 
 
 == Later life == 
 From 1015 to 1022, Avicenna was a high official and doctor to the ruler of [[Hamedan]] in western [[Iran]]. After the ruler of Hamedan died Avicenna was put in [[prison]]. He was released four months later when Hamadan was captured by Alā al-Dawla, the ruler of [[Isfahan]]. Alā al-Dawla only captured Hamadan for a short period of time.  Avicenna escaped, disguised as a [[dervish]], to Isfahan to work for Alā al-Dawla as a doctor.  In 1030, the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] attacked Isfahan and some of Avicenna's work was lost and possibly stolen. He died during an attack on the city of Hamedan. < ref > Marmura, Michael.
