 '''Riyadh''' (/rɨˈjɑːd/; {{lang-ar|الرياض}} ''ar-Riyāḍ''  < small > [[Najdi Arabic|Najdi]] pronunciation: < /small >  {{IPA-ar|er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ|}}) is the capital and most populous city of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is also the capital of [[Riyadh Province]], and belongs to the historical regions of Nejd and Al-Yamama. It is in the center of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] on a large plateau, and is home to 6.5 million people. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.arriyadh.com/eng/|title=About arriyadh|last=|first=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=|archive-date=2009-01-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061805/http://arriyadh.com/eng/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, managed by Riyadh Municipality headed by the mayor of Riyadh, and the Riyadh Development Authority, chaired by the governor of Riyadh Province, Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud. The current mayor of Riyadh is Ibrahim Mohammed Al Sultan. He was appointed mayor in 2015. It has been designated a [[global city]]. 
 
 ==History==  
 ===Early history=== 
 
 During the Pre-Islamic era the city at the site was called ''Hajr'' ({{lang-ar|حجر}}), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa.{{sfn|Sonbol|2012|p=99}} Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern [[Arabia]] during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the [[Abbasid Empire]] in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as  " the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr " . Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to [[Mecca]] to perform the [[Hajj]].

 [[File:KING FAHD ROAD FEB1.JPG|180px|thumb|left|King Fahad Road]]

Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, [[Irqah]], Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal ( " the North " ).

The [[Kingdom Center]], [[Al Faisaliyah Center|Al Faisalyah]] and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The centre of the city, [[Al-Bathaa]] and Al-Dir'iyyah, is also its oldest part.
