In [[geography]], the term '''location''' or '''geographical location''' is the place or location used to identify a point on the [[Earth#Surface|surface of the Earth]] or any other place in relation to the countries and bodies of water adjacent to this place. It can also be determined by the 360-degree longitude lines separated by the Greenwich line to 180 degrees east and 180 degrees west; a [[coordinate system]]. The 180 degrees latitude are divided by the equator into 90 degrees north and 90 degrees south.
