 '''Neurodiversity''' is a word for differences in people's brains. It is a type of [[biodiversity]] (diversity in living creatures). 
 
 Examples of neurodiverse conditions include [[autism]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[ADHD]], and [[dyslexia]]. 
 
 == Movement == 
 The neurodiversity movement is an approach to [[Mental illness|mental disability]] in which some neurological conditions are variations of the human brain. The term was first used in the late 1990s as a challenge to the idea that neurological differences are disorders instead of features. The movement believes that these variations should be recognised as a social category along with [[gender]], [[human race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. 
 
 Some people claim that neurodiversity would not be good for individuals with severe disabilities, such as low-functioning autism.  They state that the difficulties are far greater than any potential strengths. < ref name= " Controversy " > {{cite web |last1=Robison |first1=John |title=The Controversy Around Autism and Neurodiversity |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/my-life-aspergers/201704/the-controversy-around-autism-and-neurodiversity |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=4 July 2020}} < /ref >
