''Not to be confused with [[Snake mackerel]].''[[File:Lepidocybium flavobrunneum.jpg|thumb|''Lepidocybium flavobrunneum'']] 
 The '''escolar''' (''Lepidocybium flavobrunneum'') is a species of [[fish]] in the family [[Gempylidae]]. It is also known as the '''[[snake mackerel]]'''. It is the only species in the genus '''''Lepidocybium'''''. 
 
 == Description == 
 The escolar is dark [[brown]], growing darker with age until it is quite [[black]]. They can't metabolize the wax esters (gempylotoxin) naturally found in its diet. This gives the escolar an oil content of 14â€“25% in its flesh.

 [[Restaurant|Restaurants]] can sometimes confuse escolar for other fish.  In 2009,  " [[tuna]] "  samples from [[sushi]] restaurants in [[New York City]] and [[Denver]] were DNA-tested. Five of nine restaurants serving fish labeled  " white tuna " ,  " white tuna (albacore) "  or  " super white tuna "  were serving escolar.
