 '''Queens''' is a borough of [[New York City]] and a [[county]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] State. It was named for [[Catherine of Braganza]], the Queen of England and wife of King [[Charles II of England]].[[File:Unisphere-cc.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Unisphere, a symbol of the Borough of Queens]] 
 
 Queens is in western [[Long Island]].  The [[East River]] separates it from [[Manhattan]] in the east and [[The Bronx]] in the north.  Queens' only land boundary with another New York City borough is with [[Brooklyn]] in the south and west.  Jamaica Bay separates most of Queens from its Rockaway Peninsula in the south.  [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] lies to the east. Until 1899, Nassau County was part of Queens County.  
 
 About 2.4 million people live in Queens and it is the largest borough of New York City in size and second in population (after [[Brooklyn]]). According to the United States [[census]], Queens is the most ethnically diverse county in the USA. That means that it has the most people from different kinds of places, religions, and ethnic groups of any place in the USA. Large parts of Queens are [[urban]] and an equal part is [[suburb]]an. 
 
 == Transportation == 
 Queens is home to both of New York City's airports, [[LaGuardia Airport]] (LGA) and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] (JFK). Queens is connected to the Bronx by three bridges: the [[Bronx Whitestone Bridge]], the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]] and the [[Triborough Bridge]]. It is connected to Manhattan by two bridges and one tunnel: the [[Triborough Bridge]], the [[Queensboro Bridge]], and the [[Queens Midtown Tunnel]]. 
 
 Many [[controlled-access highway]]s cross Queens, including I-495 (the Long Island Expressway), I-278 (the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway), and I-678 (the Van Wyck Expressway, pronounced Van Wike). Important state highways in Queens include the [[Grand Central Parkway]], which becomes the Northern State Parkway when it crosses the Queens border into [[Nassau County]]. 
 
 Many [[New York City Subway]] lines go through Queens.  The most famous is the [[Flushing]] Line, the [[7 Train]], which has the nickname  " International Express "  because it goes through many neighborhoods where many immigrants live.  Other subway lines in Queens include the [[A Train]], [[C Train]], [[E Train]], [[F Train]], [[G Train]], [[J Train]], [[M Train]], [[N Train]], [[R Train]], [[V Train]], [[W Train]], and [[Z Train]]. 
 
 Queens has a very large [[bus]] system that goes to all parts of the borough. Some bus routes go to [[Brooklyn]], Manhattan, or [[the Bronx]]. 
 
 The [[Long Island Rail Road]] also has many stations in Queens. The [[Port Washington Line]] crosses northern Queens. There are busy stations at [[Woodside, Queens]], [[Forest Hills]], and [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]. The central depot and main station for the railroad is in the neighborhood of [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]]. 
 
 == Sport  &  Recreation == 
 [[File:SheaStadium_Exterior.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Shea Stadium, former home of the Mets]] 
 The [[New York Mets]] of the [[National League]] of [[Major League Baseball]] play in [[Citi Field]] in Queens. The [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], a famous and important [[tennis]] tournament, is played in Arthur Ashe Stadium in [[Flushing Meadows Park]] south of the baseball stadium.
