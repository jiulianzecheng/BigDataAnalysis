 '''Magnesium''' ( /mæɡˈniːziəm/ mag-NEE-zee-əm) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol ''Mg'', [[atomic number]] 12 and common [[oxidation state]] +2. It is an [[alkaline earth metal]] and the eighth most abundant element in the [[Earth]]'s crust, where it constitutes about 2% by mass, and ninth in the known [[universe]] as a whole. < ref > {{cite book|last = Ash|first = Russell|title = The Top 10 of Everything 2006: The Ultimate Book of Lists|publisher = Dk Pub|year = 2005|url = http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm|isbn = 0756613213|access-date = 2011-09-26|archive-date = 2010-02-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100210170504/http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm|url-status = dead}}. < /ref >  This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in [[supernova]] stars from a sequential addition of three [[helium]] [[nucleus (physics)|nuclei]] to [[carbon]] (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium [[ion]]'s high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in [[seawater]]. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm#composition|title=The chemical composition of seawater|author=Anthoni, J Floor|year=2006}} < /ref > 
 
 Magnesium is the 11th most abundant element by mass in the [[human body]]. Its ions are essential to all living cells. The ions play a major role in manipulating important biological [[polyphosphate]] compounds like [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[DNA]], and [[RNA]]. Hundreds of [[enzyme]]s thus require magnesium ions to function. Magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of [[chlorophyll]], and is thus a common additive to [[fertilizer]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mg12.info|title=Magnesium in health}} < /ref >   Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters. 
 
 The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] (though once produced, is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. 
 ==Uses== 
 Commercially, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make [[aluminium]]-magnesium alloys, sometimes called  " magnalium "  or  " magnelium " . Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength. 
 
 Magnesium is used in fireworks to make a brilliant bright light. Another use is to mix it with other metals to make it strong, lightweight alloys such as those used to make bicycle frames. 
 
 Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common [[laxative]]s, antacids (i.e., milk of magnesia), and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and [[blood vessel]] spasm is required (that is, to treat [[eclampsia]]). 
 
 Magnesium is used in electronic devices, including: [[mobile phone]]s, [[laptop computer]]s, [[camera]]s, and other electronic components. Magnesium's low weight, good mechanical and electrical properties are good for these uses. 
 
 Magnesium reacted with an [[alkyl halide]] gives a [[Gringard reagent]], which is a very useful tool for preparing [[alcohol]]s. 
 
 Magnesium is also used in incendiary bombs, which are bombs that blow up and spread fire everywhere.
