 '''Cargo''' or '''freight''' means [[Good (economics)|goods]] which people transport, often using a [[vehicle]] made for that purpose rather than for [[passenger]] service. The vehicle is usually a [[truck]] or [[freighter]] or [[cargo aircraft]] or freight [[train]]. 
 
 Prefabricated cargo is a type of cargo for transportation in prefabricated batches, which are completed at the expense of piece units and container volumes.   
 
 The noun is used as not [[Noun#Countability|countable]]; people will talk about ''some'' freight.  Today, goods other than [[bulk cargo]] are usually packed in [[Containerization|shipping container]]s, which are carried.  A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a ''cargo terminal''.
