The '''cloaca''' is a common rear opening in land [[vertebrate]]s. Through this opening, the animals expel [[urine]] and [[faeces]], and carry out [[reproduction]]. 
 
 The cloaca is a primitive or 'basal' feature of [[tetrapod]]s. All [[amphibia]], all [[sauropsid]]s ([[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s) and even [[monotreme]] [[mammal]]s have a cloaca.  
 
 A different method is used by [[theria]]n mammals, such as [[marsupial]]s and [[placental]]s. They have an [[anus]] for [[defecation]], and another opening for urine and sexual reproduction.
