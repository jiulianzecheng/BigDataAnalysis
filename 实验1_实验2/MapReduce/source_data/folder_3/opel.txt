 '''Opel''', full name '''Adam Opel AG''', is an [[car|automobile]] maker from [[Germany]], founded in 1862. From 1929 to 2017, Opel is the German brand of the American automaker [[General Motors]]. Opel has about 35,000 workers. The company headquarters are in [[Rüsselsheim]], [[Germany]]. Other German plants are in [[Eisenach]] and [[Kaiserslautern]]. In Great Britain, Opel cars are called [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]]. Opel would later engineer cars for [[Daewoo Motors|GMDAT]] and GM Korea until the Opel brand was bought by PSA. From 2007 to 2009 three Opel models (the Antara, the Astra and the Vectra) were sold in the United States under the Saturn marque. Upon the discontinuation of the Saturn marque, [[Buick]] became responsible for importing the Opel models. The only Buick cars to not be Opels are the [[Buick Enclave|Enclave]] CUV and the full sized LaCrosse sedan. In March 2017, Opel and its parent brand [[Vauxhall]] were bought by PSA, the company who owns [[Peugeot]] and [[Citroën]].
