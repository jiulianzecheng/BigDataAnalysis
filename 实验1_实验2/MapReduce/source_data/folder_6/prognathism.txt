 '''Prognathism''' describes when part or all of the face sticks out more than normal. [[Human]]s have ''orthognathic'' faces. That means the faces is more or less vertical. Most other [[primate]]s have prognathic faces: their jaws stick out in front of the top part of the head. < ref > Matt Cartmill, Fred H. Smith:. ''The human lineage''. Wiley p.251 < /ref >

 *Nasal prognathism: is when the portion of the face around and including the nose sticks out. Also called upper facial projection. 
 
 *Alveolar prognathism:  is when the alveolar (dental) part of the upper jaw (maxilla) sticks out. Also called mid-facial projection. Often causes what is called an  " overbite " . 
 
 *Mandibular prognathism: is when the mandible (lower jaw) sticks out. Often called an  " underbite " .
