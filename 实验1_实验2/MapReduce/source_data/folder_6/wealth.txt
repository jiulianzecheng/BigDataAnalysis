{{Wiktionary|wealth}} 
 [[File:Gold bullion bars.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gold]] can count as a type of wealth or [[money]] due to its status as a [[precious metal]]]] 
 '''Wealth''' often means that much [[money]] is available. But there are several other aspects that can be more important. If one thinks of single persons one will look at their personal [[property]] or [[asset]]s like land and [[livestock]]. Looking at countries one thinks of [[GDP per capita]] and of [[natural capital]].  
 
 The original meaning of the old English word for  " weal " , where wealth comes from, was  " well-being "  or [[:wikt:welfare|welfare]]. (It was an adjective.)
