 An '''autotroph''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''autos'' = self and ''trophe'' = nutrition) is an [[organism]] that makes [[organic compound]]s from simple [[molecule]]s. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Autotrophs are needed in every [[food chain]] in all [[ecosystem]]s. They take [[energy]] from the [[environment]] (sun light or inorganic sources) and use it to make other organic molecules that are used to carry out various biological functions such as [[cell]] growth or repairing broken [[biological tissue|tissue]]. 
 
 == Types == 
 [[Plant]]s and other organisms that carry out [[photosynthesis]] are [[phototroph]]s (or photoautotrophs). [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] that use inorganic compounds like [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[phosphorus]] or [[iron]] are called [[chemoautotroph]]s. Other organisms, called [[heterotroph]]s, eat autotrophs.  
 
 There are some [[species]] that need [[organic compound]]s as a source of food, but are able to use light as a source of energy. These are not autotrophic, but heterotrophic. A [[mixotroph]] is a (micro)organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon.
