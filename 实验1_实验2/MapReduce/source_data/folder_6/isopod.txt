 '''Isopods '''are animals that belong to an order of [[Peracarida|peracarid]] [[crustacean]]s. This order is called ''Isopoda. ''The name Isopoda derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek roots]] (''iso-'', meaning  " same " ) and (''podos'', meaning  " foot " ). Some isopod species live in water, like the [[tongue louse]]. Others live on land, like [[woodlice]] and [[pill bug]]s. 
 
 == Description == 
 Isopods can be half an inch long. They are usually gray, brown or black, with an oval-shaped body. They have seven armor plates, called  " pereonites, "  which protect them. They also have seven pairs of short legs. Isopods have two pairs of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]; one pair feels along the ground. 
 
 Isopods have [[Gill's Pinnacle|gills]] and need water to breathe. Because of this, the isopod species which live on land must stay in moist places.
