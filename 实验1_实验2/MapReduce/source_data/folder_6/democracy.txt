'''Democracy''' means ''rule by the people''. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A805952|title=BBC - h2g2 - Demokratia - the Athenian Democracy|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2010}} < /ref >  There are different ways this can be done: 
 # People meet to decide about new [[laws]], and changes to existing ones. This is usually called '''[[direct democracy]]'''. It is never used except in small countries, or perhaps in towns. Modern populations are usually too large to do this. 
 # The people [[Election|elect]] their leaders. These leaders take decisions about laws. This is commonly called '''[[representative democracy]]'''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=250 & Itemid=198 |title=Democracy Conference |publisher=Innertemple.org.uk |accessdate=2010-08-22}} < /ref >  Elections are either held periodically, or when an officeholder dies.   
 # Sometimes people can propose new laws or changes to existing laws. Usually, this is done using a [[referendum]], a [[vote]]. 
 # Sometimes, people are chosen more or less at random. This is common, for example, when choosing a [[jury]] for a [[trial]]. In Europe, trials with a jury are usually used for serious crimes. However, many legal cases are not about crimes. They are about commercial issues. They are usually held without a jury, and decisions are made by the judge or judicial panel. 
 
 The type of government where power is in the hands of a single person is called a [[dictatorship]]. Democracy is the opposite of a [[dictatorship]]. The [[Soviet Union]] almost always was a dictatorship, as Russia is today. Dictatorships often act against [[freedom of expression]].  
 
 An important source of information is the [[Democracy Index]] published by the ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' periodical. 
 
 == Types of government == 
 Elections are simple: The candidate with the most votes gets elected. Very often, the [[politician]]s being elected belongs to a [[political party]]. Instead of choosing a person, people vote for a party. The party with the most votes then picks the candidates. 
 
 Usually, the people being elected need to meet certain conditions: They need to have a certain [[Ageing|age]] or a government body needs to determine that they are suitably qualified to perform the job. 
 
 Not everyone can vote in an election. [[Suffrage]] is only given to people who are citizens. The young are usually excluded, and some other groups such as [[prisoner]]s. 
 
 For some elections, a country makes voting [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]]. Someone who does not vote and who does not give a good reason, usually has to pay a [[fine]].

 == Kinds of democracy == 
 Democracy may be direct or indirect. 
 
 In a [[direct democracy]], every adult has the right to vote on individual laws. A modern example of direct democracy is a [[referendum]], which is the [[name]] for deciding a law where everyone in the community votes on it. Direct democracies are not usually used to run countries. It is not practical to have everyone voting on everything. 
 
 In an [[Indirect democracy|indirect]], or representative democracy, people choose representatives to make laws for them. These people can be mayors, councilmen, members of Parliament, or other government officials. This is the usual kind of democracy. Large communities like cities and countries use this method, but it may not be needed for a small group. 
 
 === Pseudo-democracy === 
 A term for democracies which are not actually democracies. For example, a constitution of a country may be democratic, but ways are found to interfere with elections. The classic case is [[Russia]], where opposition candidates are not allowed to state their case on any of the state-controlled media. Elections for President are fixed, but the state can claim democratic legitimacy, because in principle other candidates may stand for election. Opposition candidates have no access to the media, and may be harassed in various ways. This is the way all the former parts of the [[Soviet Union]] are governed. This does not mean the governments are always bad governments. It does mean that holding  " fixed "  elections deprives the people of a fair vote. Not surprisingly, these countries have Presidents who are never beaten in an election. They may serve for eight years or longer before retiring. The next leaders are pre-chosen by discussion between the leading families. 
 
 The [[European Parliament]] says Russia functions as a unitary state despite officially being a federation. < ref > Russel, Martin (20 October 2015).

 == History == 
 === Ancient origins === 
 Democracy was developed long ago by the Greeks in classical Athens.  There, everyone who was a citizen (not slaves, women, foreigners, and children) got together in one area.  The assembly would talk about what kinds of laws they wanted and voted on them. The council would suggest the laws. All citizens were allowed in the assembly. 
 
 The council were picked by draws (lottery). The participants in the council would change every year, and the number of people in the council was at the most 500. For some offices, the Athenian citizens would pick a leader by writing the name of their favorite candidate on a piece of stone or wood. The person with the most votes became the leader. 
 
 === Middle Ages === 
 In the Middle Ages, there were many systems, although only a few people could join in at this time. The [[Parliament of England]] began from the [[Magna Carta]], a document which said that the King's power was limited, and protected certain rights of the people. The first elected parliament was [[Simon de Montfort|De Montfort]]'s Parliament in England in [[1265]]. 
 
 However, only a few people could actually join in. Parliament was chosen by only a few percent of the people (in 1780, fewer than 3% of people joined in). < ref name =  " nationalarchives " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Exhibitions  &  Learning online  & #124; Citizenship  & #124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2010-08-22}} < /ref >  The ruler also had the power to call parliaments. After a long time, the power of Parliament began to grow. After the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] made Parliament more powerful. < ref name =  " nationalarchives " / >  Later, the king or queen became a [[symbol]] instead of having real power. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions  &  Learning online  & #124; Citizenship  & #124; Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2010-08-22}} < /ref > 
 
 == Democratic consolidation == 
 '''Democratic consolidation''' means how a new democracy matures. Once mature, it is unlikely to revert to [[dictatorship]] rule without an external shock. 
 
 The idea is that unconsolidated democracies suffer from intermittent elections which are not free and fair. In other words, powerful groups are able to prevent the system working fairly. < ref > O'Donnell 1996 ''Illusions about consolidation'' < /ref >
