 '''Boraginaceae''' is a family of around 2000 species, occurring mainly in Europe and Asia, especially in the Mediterranean region. Most of them are herbs, although there are some woody [[plant]]s. Most of them are grown as ornamental plants, although some are a source of dye or have medicinal uses. The most well-known members of the Family include [[Forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis''), [[Heliotropium|Heliotrope]] (''Heliotropium''), the [[Comfreys]] (''Symphytum''), [[Borage]] (''Borago''), and [[Hound's Tongue]] (''Cynoglossum'').
