 ==Origin== 
 The term ''Padmashali'' is derived from two words ''Padma'' and ''Shali'', The Padma means [[Nelumbo|lotus]] and Shali means weaver. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAb2jb5redYC|title=The Indian Textile Journal|last=|first=|date=1984|publisher=Business Press|isbn=|location=|page=63|language=en}} < /ref >  They support their Sanskrit origin with various myths and ''Puranas'' such as ''Kulapurana'' and ''Markandeya Purana''. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5XlI91kP3YC|title=The World of the Weaver in Northern Coromandel, C.1750-c.1850|last=Swarnalatha|first=P.|date=2005|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125028680|location=|pages=31–41|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The Padmashalis claim to be descendants from ''Bhrigu Rishi'' and ''Markandeya Rishi'', Markandeya's son ''Bhavana Rishi'' who were born one hundred and one son; they took to weaving and the first clothes they wore was out of the fibres of the lotus stem so they came to be known as ''Padmashalis''. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SqLrAAAAMAAJ|title=Journal of Indian Textile History|last=|first=|date=1955|publisher=Calico Museum of Textiles.|isbn=|location=|page=56|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Padmashalis Today== 
 The Padmashalis divided into two groups based on ''Sampradaya'', being the [[Shaivism|Shaivas]] and the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]] and they worship both [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]]. < ref name= " :2 "  / >
