 '''Takbir''' is the name for the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase '''Allahu Akbar''' which is a [[Muslim]] saying. The exact words in Arabic mean   " [[God]] is greater " , but people know that saying  " God is great "  in the right time and place means the same as  " ''God is Greater''. "   " ''Allahu Akbar'' "  is the first part of the [[Adhan]], which people hear 5 times a day where Muslim people live together. Saying  " God is Great "  tells people in a few words what [[Islam]] believes and teaches.  
 
 This [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase was added to the [[Iraq]]i flag, in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s handwriting, in 2001. Muslims say it before changing positions during their prayers. Allahu Akbar was the anthem of [[Libya]] during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]].
