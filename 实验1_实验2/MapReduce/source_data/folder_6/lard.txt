 '''Lard''' is rendered [[pig]] [[fat]] that is used in [[cooking]]. Before, many [[cuisine]]s used it as a [[cooking fat]] or [[shortening]], or as a [[Spread (food)|spread]] similar to [[butter]]. It is not used as much as before. Many cooks and bakers still like it better than other fats for some things. It also has a high [[smoke point]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2014-04-28|title=10 Reasons You Should Be Cooking With Lard|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cooking-with-lard-baking_n_5212804|access-date=2021-06-05|website=HuffPost|language=en}} < /ref >
