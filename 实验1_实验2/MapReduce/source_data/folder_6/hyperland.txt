 '''''Hyperland''''' is a 50-minute long [[documentary]] movie about [[hypertext]] and surrounding technologies. It was written by [[Douglas Adams]] and produced and directed by [[Max Whitby]]. < ref > [[Ted Nelson]]: ''Possiplex''. 2010, page 272f. < /ref >  It ran on [[BBC Two]] in 1990. It stars Douglas Adams as a computer user and [[Tom Baker]] as a [[personification]] of a [[software agent]]. 
 
 In the show Adams has a dream where he is browsing through various media. While Adams is browsing, many people and projects related to the general theme of hypertext and [[multimedia]] are presented: 
 
 * [[Vannevar Bush]] and his [[Memex]] < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush|title=As We May Think|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=July 1945|author=[[Vannevar Bush]]}} < /ref >  concept 
 * [[Ted Nelson]] explains [[hypertext]] and [[Project Xanadu]]. 
 * [[Hans Peter Br√∏ndmo]] talks about the idea of animated icons. 
 * [[Robert Winter]] talks about an interactive version of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 9th Symphony]]. 
 * An idea from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s book [[Palm Sunday (book)|''Palm Sunday'']] is presented: stories and narrative structures have shapes that can be represented mathematically as graphs. 
 * [[Robert Abel (animator)|Robert Abel]] shows his multimedia version of [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-29/entertainment/ca-245_1_future-tense|title='Future Tense': The New Link Between Arts and Technology|author=Robert Epstein|date=29 January 1991|accessdate=1 May 2012|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}} < /ref > 
 * [[Apple Multimedia Lab]] employees Steve Gano, Kristee Kreitman, Kristina Hooper, [[Michael Naimark]] and Fabrice Florin talk about a multimedia version of [[Life Story (TV film)|Life Story]], a [[BBC]] TV movie dramatisation of the 1953 discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]. 
 * Amanda Goodenough presents ''Inigo Gets Out'', an interactive story for children using [[Hypercard]]. 
 * [[Brad deGraf]] and [[Michael Wahrman]] talk about their [[Digital puppetry|digital puppet]] ''Mike Normal''. 
 * A [[NASA Ames Research Center]] scientist presents a prototype [[Virtual Reality]] helmet  called ''Cyberiad''. 
 * [[Marc Canter]] makes a cameo  (non-)appearance as an animated icon that is not  " clicked "  by Adams; the audience never gets to see his interview. 
 
 The dream (and the documentary) ends with a vision of how information might be accessed in 2005. ''Hyperland'' does describe a number of features of the modern web. This is especially noteworthy because it predates the public release of the [[WorldWideWeb|first Web browser]] by about a year.
