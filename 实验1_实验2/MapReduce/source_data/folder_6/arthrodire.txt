 The '''Arthrodires''' (Arthrodira) are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of extinct armoured, jawed fishes of the class [[Placodermi]]. They flourished in the [[Devonian]] period before their sudden [[extinction]], surviving for about 50 million years and living in most marine [[ecological niche]]s. 
 
 Greek for  " jointed neck " , the arthrodires had movable joints between [[armour]] plates surrounding the head and body. The mouth is interesting. As the lower jaw moved down, the head shield moved, allowing a large opening. Lacking distinct [[teeth]], like all placoderms, they used the sharpened edges of a bony plate as a biting surface. The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some [[ichthyosaurs]].  
 
 Early arthrodires, such as the genus ''[[Arctolepis]]'', were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, ''[[Dunkleosteus]]'', was a true superpredator of the latest Devonian period, from 3 to 9 m in length. In contrast, the long-nosed ''[[Rolfosteus]]'' measured just 15 & nbsp;cm.

 A common misconception is the arthrodires were sluggish bottom-dwellers that were outcompeted by more advanced fish. But during their reign, the arthrodires were one of the most diverse and numerically successful vertebrate orders of the Devonian. They occupied a vast spectrum of roles from [[apex predator]] to [[detritus]]-nibbling bottom dweller. The arthrodires were one of many groups eliminated by the [[mass extinction]]s of the late Devonian. This let other fish such as [[shark]]s diversify into the vacant ecological niches during the [[Carboniferous]] period.
