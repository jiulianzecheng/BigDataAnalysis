 '''Tetrapodomorpha''' is a [[clade]] of [[vertebrate]]s. It is a [[subclass (biology)|subclass]] of the [[Sarcopterygii]] which includes [[tetrapod]]s (four-limbed vertebrates) and their closest relatives.  
 
 Advanced [[transitional fossil]]s between fish and the early [[labyrinthodont]]s, like ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', are [[wikt:informal|informally]] called '[[fishapod]]s' by their discoverers. They are half-fish half-[[tetrapod]]s, in appearance and limb morphology.  
 
 Tetrapodomorpha contains  
 # the [[stem group]] tetrapoda, [[extinct]] [[fossil]] relatives of the crown group. This is a [[paraphyletic]] unit covering the fish to tetrapod transition. Tetrapodomorpha contains several groups of related [[lobe-finned fish]]es, collectively known as the [[osteolepiform]]s.  
 # the [[crown group]] tetrapods, the last common ancestor of living tetrapods and all of its [[descendant]]s.    
 
 Among the characters defining tetrapodomorphs are modifications to the fins, notably a [[humerus]] with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the [[shoulder]] joint). 
 
 Tetrapodomorph fossils are known from the early [[Devonian]] onwards, and include ''[[Eusthenopteron]]'', ''[[Osteolepis]]'', ''[[Panderichthys]]'', ''[[Tiktaalik]]'', ''[[Ventastega]]'' and ''[[Kenichthys]]''. 
 
 The fossils of the early [[Mississippian]], ''[[Pederpes]]'' and ''[[Whatcheeria]]'' are regarded as early [[tetrapod]]s whose relationships are not yet clear.
