 '''Spruce''' are [[tree]]s of the [[genus]] '''''Picea''''', a [[genus]] of about 35 [[species]] of [[conifer]]ous [[evergreen]] trees in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Pinaceae]]. They live in the northern [[temperate]] and [[taiga]] regions of the Earth. 
 
 Spruce are large trees, from 20 to 60 (–95) m tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their [[cone|conical]] form and their needles, that are attached singly to the [[branch]]es in a spiral fashion. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old. 
 
 == Growth == 
 More than half of spruce seedling mortality occurs during the first growing season and is very high during the first winter. < ref name= " alex " > Alexander R.R. 1987. Ecology, silviculture, and management of the Engelmann spruce–subalpine fir type in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. USDA, For. Serv., Washington DC, Agric. Handb. 659. < /ref >  Seedlings get freezing damage, frost heaving and erosion, and smothered by litter and snow-pressed vegetation.  
 
 Losses often remain high for some years.  " Establishment "  is a subjective concept based on the idea that once a seedling has successfully reached a certain size, not much is likely to prevent its further development. < ref name= " nob " > Noble D.L.; Ronco F. 1978.

 == Classification == 
 There are 35 species alive in the world. [[The Plant List]] has 59 accepted spruce names. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Picea|title=Search results – The Plant List|website=www.theplantlist.org|access-date=2022-03-20|archive-date=2019-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015922/http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=picea|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The other list is [[World Flora Online]].
