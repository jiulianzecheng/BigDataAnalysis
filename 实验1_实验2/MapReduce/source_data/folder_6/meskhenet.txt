'''Meskhenet''' is the [[ancient Egypt]]ian goddess of [[childbirth]]. She is also the creator of Ka, a part of the [[soul]] of man to which Meskhenet will breathe into each person at the moment of his or her birth. She is one of the very few deities that have been worshipped since the earliest of times in Egypt.
