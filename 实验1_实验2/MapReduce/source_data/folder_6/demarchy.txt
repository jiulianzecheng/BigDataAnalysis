'''Demarchy''' is a [[Politics|political]] system based on many [[decision-making]] groups that deal with specific functions in a given area (transport, parks, land use, etc.) The members that make up each group are chosen randomly every year. [[Democracy in Athens]] used this method to appoint officials. 
 
 This system is advantageous because it can not be influenced by pressure groups, media and others. In demarchy  " political machines "  or special preparation of candidates are not important because nobody can predict who will be in government next.
