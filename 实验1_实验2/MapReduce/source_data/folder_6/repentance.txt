{{About|repentance in Christanity}} 
 
 In [[Christianity]], '''Repentance''' means to renounce a [[sin|sinful life]] that the person lived and turns to Jesus to receive his forgiveness. Repenting can also bring healing. ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+7%3A14 & version=ESV 2 Chronicles 7:14]) However, to those who never repented, they will all perish. ([https://biblehub.com/luke/13-5.htm Luke 13:5]) 
 
 To you repent you must- Admit to God that you are a sinner. Believe that God sent his one and only son to die for all of our sins. Commit yourself to a life of following Jesus and serving others.
