 '''Grottaglie''' is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Taranto]], [[Apulia]], in southern [[Italy]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Scalinata Grottaglie.jpg|thumb|left|Paesaggio caratteristico del centro storico grottagliese]] 
 Grottaglie is in the [[Salento]] peninsula, a whole rock of [[Limestone]] dividing [[Adriatic Sea]] from [[Ionian Sea]]. The countryside around the city has many large and deep [[ravine]]s. 
 
 == History == 
 The name Grottaglie comes from the Latin '''''Cryptae Aliae''''', meaning  " many ravines " . People lived here since the [[paleolithic]] Age. The [[fief]] of Grottaglie was given by the [[Norman]] overlords to the [[Archdiocese of Taranto]] in the 11th century. In the 14th century the church gave the fief a walls and a castle. 
 
 Since the 15th-17th centuries the jurisdiction over Grottaglie fief was split between the ecclesiastic administration (civil law) and the lay feudal lords (criminal law, Cicinelli-Caracciolo family). Fights between these two competing authorities and revolts by the heavily-taxed population were common until the end of [[feudalism]] (1806).  
 
 == Main sights == 
 * The massive ''Castello Episcopio'' (13th century) castle. 
 * The main church, also known as ''Chiesa Matrice'', dating back to 1379. 
 * The city's oratory, known as Purgatory Oratory. 
 * ''Palazzo Cicinelli'', a massive building on the main square later redecoreted to the current fashion during the Baroque period. The palazzo was the seat of the [[wikipedia:Duke|Duke]] of Grottaglie also [[wikipedia:Prince|Prince]] of [[wikipedia:Cursi|Cursi]] and [[wikipedia:Princes_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire|Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]], hence the residence of the feudal lords of the town on the grant of [[wikipedia:Bohemond_I_of_Antioch|Bohemo]]. 
 * ''Palazzo Urselli'', which maintains the original Renaissance (pre-Baroque) façade, with a massive 15th century gate and a decorated internal courtyard. 
 * ''Palazzo Maggiulli-Cometa'', whose structure is similar to Palazzo Urselli’s. 
 * [[wikipedia:Palazzo_de_Félice,_Grottaglie|Palazzo De Felice]], an 18th Century palace, and ancestral home of the De Felice's family. 
 * Monastero di [[wikipedia:Francis_of_Paola|Francesco di Paola]], representing the greatest Baroque monument in the city. It has a splendid cloistered-court inside. 
 * ''Chiesa del Carmine'', housing a 1530 stone crib scene made by Stefano da Putignano.

 Folkloristic and religious events include the commemoration-day of [[:it:Ciro_di_Alessandria|Ciro di Alessandria d'Egitto]] and Easter-period when the Medieval-rooted confraternal religious orders perform their processions during the days of the [[wikipedia:Holy_Week|Holy Week]] ([[wikipedia:Easter|Easter]] rituals include [[wikipedia:Procession|Procession]] and pilgrimage of confrères called “Bubble-Bubble” through the streets of town).
