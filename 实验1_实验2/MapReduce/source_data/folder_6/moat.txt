 A '''moat''' is a body of [[water]] around a [[castle]] or [[town]] to keep people out. The moat was introduced between 1154 and 1485. At first, moats were simple and used only for protection. Later on, moats became more complicated and were used for show. 
 
 Moats are deep, wide [[ditch]]es filled with water. They were usually built near sources of water that flowed into the moats, filling them with water. The moats were filled with water for a few reasons. It made enemies swimming across the moat easy targets. It also made it impossible for enemies to dig underneath the castle walls, which was a common method of attack. It also prevented [[fire]]s from destroying the castle. < ref name=alchin > {{citation|last=Alchin|first=Linda|title=Castle Moats|url=http://www.castles.me.uk/castle-moats.htm|year=2005|accessdate=18 January 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 == Origin == 
 The word ''moat'' comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''motte'', which means [[hill]]. Moats were first used in the [[Middle ages|Medieval period]], from 1016 to 1164. Castles were built on the top of high hills. The area at the bottom of the hill was eventually called the moat. < ref name=alchin/ > 
 
 == Usage == 
 Castle moats were usually between 5 and 40 feet deep, and they were not always filled with water. Not all moats contained water, as a simple dry, wide ditch could prove an obstacle. These were called dry moats. 
 
 In many stories, moats are filled with [[alligator]]s or [[crocodiles]]. This is a [[myth]]. < ref name=castledefense > {{citation|last=Hull|title=Castle Defenses|first=Marvin|year=2008|url=http://www.castles-of-britain.com/castleso.htm|work=Castles of Britain|accessdate=18 January 2010|archive-date=2007-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110014020/http://www.castles-of-britain.com/castleso.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  However, moats were sometimes filled with [[fish]] or [[eels]] for food.
