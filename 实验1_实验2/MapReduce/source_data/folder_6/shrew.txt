 '''Shrews''' are small [[mammal]]s which look rather like [[mice]]. They were classified in the old [[Insectivora]], but that is no longer used. Now they are classified in the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Soricidae''', [[suborder]] [[Soricomorpha]]. < ref name= " msw3 " > {{MSW3 Hutterer | pages = 223–300}} < /ref > 
 
 True shrews are not to be confused with [[West Indies shrews]], [[treeshrew]]s, [[otter shrew]]s, or [[elephant shrew]]s, which belong to different families or orders. 
 
 Although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse, a shrew is ''not'' a [[rodent]], as mice are. In fact it is related to [[mole]]s. Shrews have sharp, spike-like teeth, not the familiar gnawing front [[incisor]] teeth of [[rodents]]. 
 
 Shrews are [[cosmopolitan distribution|distributed almost worldwide]]. Of the major tropical and temperate land masses, only [[New Guinea]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] do not have any native shrews. In [[South America]], shrews are [[Great American Interchange|relatively recent immigrants]] and are present only in the northern [[Andes]]. In terms of species diversity, the shrew family is the fourth most successful mammal family. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The old order [[Insectivora]] was not a natural ([[monophyletic]]) group. < ref name=Rocaetal04 > {{cite journal | author = Roca A.L. | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Mesozoic origin for West Indian insectivores | journal = Nature | volume = 429 | issue = 6992| pages = 649–651 | url = | doi = 10.1038/nature02597 | pmid = 15190349| bibcode = 2004Natur.429..649R | s2cid = 915633 }} < /ref >  New terms are used to classify its former groups. < ref name=Beck > {{cite journal | author = Beck R.M.D. | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = A higher level MRP supertree of placental mammals | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 6 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-6-93 | pmid = 17101039 | pages = 93 | pmc = 1654192 | doi-access = free }} < /ref >  That explains the little-known terms in the taxobox. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 All shrews are small, most no larger than a mouse. The largest is the [[Asian house shrew]] (''Suncus murinus''), which is about 15 & nbsp;cm long and weighs around 100 & nbsp;grams. < ref > Louch C.D.; Ghosh A.K.  &  Pal B.C. 1966. Seasonal changes in weight and reproductive activity of ''Suncus murinus'' in West Bengal, India. ''Journal of Mammalogy'' '''47''' (1): 73–78. < /ref >  Several are very small: the [[Etruscan shrew]] (''Suncus etruscus''), is about 3.5 & nbsp;cm and 2 & nbsp;grams. It is the smallest living terrestrial mammal and the smallest type of shrew. 
 
 In general, shrews live in and on the ground. They search for [[seeds]], [[insects]], [[nuts]], and [[worms]]. Some climb trees, some live underground, some live under [[snow]], and some hunt in water. They have small eyes, and generally poor [[Visual perception|vision]], but have excellent senses of [[hearing]] and [[olfaction|smell]]. < ref name=EoM > {{cite book |editor=Macdonald D.|author= Barnard, Christopher J.|year=1984 |title= The encyclopedia of mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 758–763|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}} < /ref >  They are very active animals, with big appetites. Shrews have an unusually high [[metabolic rate]]. < ref > William J.  &  Platt W.J. 1974. Metabolic rates of Short-tailed shrews. ''Physiological Zoology''. '''47''': 2, 75–90. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30155625 JStore] < /ref >  Shrews usually eat 80–90% of their own body weight in food daily. 
 
 They do not [[Hibernation|hibernate]], but can enter [[torpor]]. Shrews can lose between 30% and 50% of their body weight in winter, shrinking the size of bones, skull and internal organs. < ref > {{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z-XJ-UzdwIgC & dq=seasonal+weight+changes+overwintering & pg=PA44 | title = The natural history of shrews | isbn = 978-0-8014-2595-0 | last1 = Churchfield | first1 = Sara | date = 1990| publisher = Cornell University Press }} < /ref > 
 
 Unlike rodents, which have [[wikt:gnaw|gnawing]] [[incisor]]s that grow continually, the teeth of shrews wear down throughout life, and they lose their milk teeth before birth. Therefore, they have only one set of teeth for their lifetime. Apart from the first pair of incisors, which are long and sharp, and the chewing [[molar]]s at the back of the mouth, the teeth of shrews are small and peg-like, and may be reduced in number. The [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] of shrews is: upper=3.1.1-3.3; lower=1-2.0-1.1.3. 
 
 === Fiercely territorial === 
 Shrews are fiercely territorial. They drive off rivals, and come together only to mate. Many species dig burrows to store food and hide from predators, but this is not universal. < ref name=EoM/ >  Some of them echolocate by squeaking, some are venomous, some have teeth strengthened by iron on the tips, they make ultrasonic squeaks, and two [[genera]] echolocate by clicks. 
 
 They eat plenty and often. They are very active animals, with voracious appetites. Shrews have unusually high [[metabolic rate]]s, above that expected in small mammals. < ref > {{cite journal|vauthors=William J, Platt WJ|date=1974|title=Metabolic rates of short-tailed shrews |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=75–90 |doi=10.1086/physzool.47.2.30155625|jstor=30155625|s2cid=87675441}} < /ref >  For this reason, they need to eat almost constantly. Probably the aquatic nymphs of insects (for example, mosquito larvae) are on the menu even though many of these are themselves hungry eaters.
