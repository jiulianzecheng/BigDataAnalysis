Cirit (in English: jereed) is a traditional [[Turkish]] [[Horse]] [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport in which the aim is to score points by throwing a blunt wooden spear at the opposing team's riders. It was played by the [[Turkic peoples]] of [[Central Asia]] as the main sport and ceremonial game, and was brought to [[Anatolia]] during the westward migration in the early 11th century. Today, cirit is mainly practiced in eastern [[Turkey]] and much liked by the [[Turkish people]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.turkishculture.org/lifestyles/turkish-culture-portal/cirit/the-traditional-game-329.htm | title=The Traditional Game of Cirit }} < /ref >
