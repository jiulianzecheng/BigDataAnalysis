Anastrophe (from the Greek: ἀναστροφή, anastrophē,  " a turning back or about " ) is a [[figure of speech]] in which the normal word order of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], the [[verb]], and the object is changed. For example, subject–verb–object ( " I like potatoes " ) might be changed to object–subject–verb ( " potatoes I like " ). 
 
 One of the most well-known characters who speaks in anastrophe is [[Yoda]] from the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. When he wants to state that failure is the best teacher, he says “The greatest teacher, failure is.”
