 A '''casserole''' is a [[baking|bake]]d dish for many different types of [[food]], mixed together in a fluid based on [[liquid]]. The start [[ingredient]] is often a [[roux]]. Often, one of the ingredients is a can of soup. The whole point of a casserole is that it cooks material ''slowly''. That means it can use ingredients which would not be edible if [[fried]] or [[roasted]].  
 The casserole needs to simmer below boiling point for hours, depending on the ingredients. That way tough meat and vegetables become soft and edible. 
 
 It is a simple way to cook a nutritional meal. < ref > {{Cite web|last=admin|date=2021-09-20|title=Casserole history: origins  &  the American evolution|url=https://foodicles.com/casserole-history/|access-date=2021-11-11|website=FOODICLES|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Casserole is from a French word meaning  " sauce-pan " ; a large, deep dish used either to cook something in an oven or to serve the food cooked in it. The French word   " casserole "   had been derived from the old Provençal word,  " cassa "  and the Medieval Latin word,  " cattia " , both of these words meaning  " ladle " . 
 
 Casseroles are usually cooked slowly in the oven, usually covered. They may be served as a main course or a side dish, and may be served in the vessel in which they were cooked. Types of casserole include [[ragout]], [[hotpot]], [[cassoulet]], [[tajine]], [[moussaka]], [[lasagne]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[gratin]], rice or macaroni [[timballo]], and [[carbonnade]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Team|first=Unify Health|date=2021-11-03|title=How to make loaded casseroles healthier|url=https://unifyhealthlabs.com/keto-cauliflower-casserole/|url-status=dead|access-date=2021-11-11|website=Unify Health Labs|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211111082511/https://unifyhealthlabs.com/keto-cauliflower-casserole/}} < /ref > 
 
 A popular type of casserole is [[green bean casserole]], which has green beans, milk or cream, and fried onions. It was first cooked in [[Berlin, New Hampshire]] in 1866 by, Elmire Jolicoeur. 
 
 The second illustration proves how old the idea is. That casserole dish has a lid, and a spout for steam to escape. The heat is applied from below as it is with a [[stew]]. 
 
 Early casserole dishes were rice-based that were pounded and pressed and then filled with meat. The first popular meals included [[Cassoulet|French cassoulet]], [[Pot pie|British pot pies]], [[Lasagna|Italian lasagna]], and Greek moussaka. Macaroni and cheese is the oldest written casserole [[recipe]] found in 1250.
