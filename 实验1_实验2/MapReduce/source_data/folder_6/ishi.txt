 '''Ishi''' (c. 1861  & ndash; March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the Native American [[Yana people#Yahi|Yahi people]] from [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the [[Yana people|Yana]]) were killed in the [[California genocide]] in the 19th century. Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he came out near the foothills of [[Lassen Peak]] in [[Northern California]]. 
 
 ''Ishi'', which means  " man "  in the [[Yana language]], is an adopted name. The [[anthropologist]] [[Alfred Kroeber]] gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. < ref > {{cite web|title=ISHI: A Real-Life The Last Of The Mohicans|url=https://www.mohicanpress.com/mo08019.html|website=ISHI: A Real-Life The Last Of The Mohicans|access-date=February 1, 2015}} < /ref >  When asked his name, he said:  " I have none, because there were no people to name me, "  meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name for him. 
 
 Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in [[San Francisco]]. His life was shown and discussed in many films and books. A popular biography was ''[[Ishi in Two Worlds]]'' published by [[Theodora Kroeber]] in 1961. < ref name= " Fleras " > {{cite journal |last1=Fleras |first1=Augie |title=Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development |date=2006 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=265–268 |doi=10.1080/01434630608668780|s2cid=216112743 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Japenga " > {{cite news |last1=Japenga |first1=Ann |title=Revisiting Ishi |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/aug/29/entertainment/et-japenga29 |access-date=January 31, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 29, 2003}} < /ref > < ref name=nytimes > {{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=John J.|title=TV: 'Ishi,' a Chronicle Of the Yahi Indian Tribe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/20/archives/tv-ishi-a-chronicle-of-the-yahi-indian-tribe.html|access-date=January 30, 2019|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 20, 1978}} < /ref > < ref name=LAT > {{cite web|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-20/news/vw-4294_1_american-indian-college-fund|title=Makers of HBO's 'Tribe' Given a Warm Reception|date=March 20, 1992|first=Bill|last=Higgins}} < /ref >

 In 1865, < ref > {{cite web|url=https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21391|title=Butte}} < /ref >  Ishi and his family were attacked in the [[California Indian Wars|Three Knolls Massacre]], in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was believed to be extinct. < ref name= " mpress_ishi " > [https://www.mohicanpress.com/mo08019.html ''Ishi: A Real-Life Last Of The Mohicans''], Mohican Press < /ref >  Prior to the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997. < ref name= " UCSF " > Rockafellar, Nancy (date unknown).  " The story of Ishi: A Chronology " . Retrieved on 2011-01-14 from https://history.library.ucsf.edu/ishi.html. < /ref > 
 
 The gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining polluted the water and killed fish. Deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]]. < ref > " [https://biography.yourdictionary.com/ishi Ishi Biography] " < /ref >  The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of [[Redding Rancheria]]) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, who set bounties of 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head on the natives. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep.{{fact|date=September 2018}} 
 
 Since then more has been learned. It is estimated that with this massacre, Ishi's entire cultural group, the Yana/Yahi, may have been reduced to about sixty people. From 1859 to 1911, Ishi's remote band became more and more mixed with non-Yahi Indian representatives, such as [[Wintun]], [[Nomlaki]], and [[Pit River Tribe|Pit River]] members. 
 
 In 1879, the federal government started [[American Indian boarding schools|Indian boarding schools]] in California. Some men from the reservations became renegades in the hills. Volunteers among the settlers and military troops carried out more campaigns against the northern California Indian tribes during that period. < ref name= " burrill " > Burrill, Richard (2001).

 In late 1908, a group of surveyors found the camp with two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother. Three ran away while the old woman hid herself in blankets because she was sick and unable to run away. The surveyors stole from the camp, and Ishi's mother died soon after he came back. His sister and uncle never returned.{{fact|date=September 2018}} 
 
 ===Walking into the modern world=== 
 After the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving on August 29, 1911, Ishi was captured trying to get meat near [[Oroville, California]], after forest fires in the area. < ref name=NYT961911 > {{cite news|title=FIND A RARE ABORIGINE.; Scientists Obtain Valuable Tribal Lore from Southern Yahi Indian.|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E17FB355A15738DDDAE0894D1405B818DF1D3|access-date=2012-09-02|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1911|location=San Francisco}} < /ref > 
 
 The local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The  " wild man "  caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Museum of Anthropology—now the [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology]] (PAHMA)—read about him and brought him to the university. < ref name=NYT961911 / >  Studied by the university, Ishi also worked as a janitor and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he lived in Berkeley with the [[anthropologist]] [[Thomas Talbot Waterman]] and his family. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271470|title=Ishi in Two Worlds, 50th Anniversary Edition|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|access-date=2012-08-28}} < /ref > 
 
 [[File:ishi.jpg|thumb|Ishi (right) with Alfred L. Kroeber in 1911]] 
 Waterman and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years. They talked with him for a long time. They wanted to understand Yahi culture. He described families, Yahi names, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older people in his group. Ishi taught his native [[Yana language]]. It was recorded and studied by the [[linguist]] [[Edward Sapir]], who had previously done work on the northern dialects. 
 
 Ishi died of [[tuberculosis]] on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were  " You stay. I go. " < ref name= " Starr2002 " > {{cite book|author=Kevin Starr|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HnIh_auw9MC & pg=PA330|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515797-0|page=330}} < /ref >  His friends at the university tried to prevent an [[autopsy]] on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition kept the body in one piece. But the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could stop them.

He sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. August 10, 2000, the Smithsonian returned it to the descendants of the [[Redding Rancheria]] and [[Pit River]] tribes.
