 The Jongmyo Shrine holds [[spirit tablets]], each dedicated to a specific king or queen from the Joseon Dynasty.  The Confucian way of life includes [[ancestor worship]].  During the Joseon Dynasty, the king of Korea would go to Jongmyo to pray to earlier kings and queens.  There were also larger [[rite]]s, with more people.  Some of them involved singing and dancing.  Some of these rites are still performed in modern times. < ref name= " UNESCO "  / > 
 
 The layout of the shrine was planned very carefully to complement and work with the hills and other natural structures around it.   
 
 Jongmyo has a main shrine, called Jeongjeon.  It has a smaller shrine called Yeongnyeongjeon, or  " the Hall of Eternal Peace "  in English.  It also has a place specifically for the king, a storage building for ritual items, and a waiting area.  There is also a specific shrine to King Kongmin from the earlier [[Koryo Dynasty]].  That shrine was built by the Joseon-era King Taejo. < ref name= " UNESCO "  / >

 The Jongmyo-Daejae, or  " Royal Shrine Ritual "  in English, was the most important rite performed at the shrine.  During the Joseon Dynasty, it was performed five times each year.  During the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] (1910-1945), it was not performed because the Japanese did not allow it.  Since 1969, the Royal Family Association has performed the Jongmyo-Daejae once each year.  The Jongmyo-Daejae itself and the music used in the Jongmyo-Daejae were both declared [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2001. < ref name= " Icon "  / > 
 
 Jongmyo was named a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1995. < ref name= " UNESCO "  / >
