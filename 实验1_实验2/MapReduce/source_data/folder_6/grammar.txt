'''Grammar''' is the study of words, how they are used in sentences, and how they change in different situations. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grammar|title=Definition of GRAMMAR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-06-15}} < /ref >  The [[Ancient Greek]]s used to call it ''grammatikē tékhnē'', the [[craft]] of letters. It can have any of these meanings: 
 # The study of a [[language]]: how it works, and everything about it. This is ''background research on language''. 
 # The study of [[sentence]] structure.  Rules and examples show how the language should be used.  This is a ''correct usage grammar'', as in a [[textbook]] or manual/guide. 
 # The system which people learn as they grow up. This is the ''native-speaker's grammar''. < ref name= " McA " > McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press, page 446 < /ref > < ref name= " Crystal " > Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press, page 453. < /ref > 
 
 When we speak, we use the native person's grammar, or as near as we can. When we write, we try to write with correct grammar. So, speaking and writing a language each have their own style.   
 
 == Different languages == 
 All languages have their own grammar. Most [[Europe]]an languages are rather similar. 
 
 English makes few changes to its word endings ('[[suffix]]es'). In the [[Italic]] or 'Romance' languages (such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), word endings carry a lot of meaning. In English we have just a few: plurals and possessives (''John's'') are the most common. In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one: I love, you love, but ''she love'''s'''''. That final ''''s'''' comes from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]], which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in [[Grammatical tense|tense]]: walk'''ed''', walk'''ing'''. 
 
 [[Word order]] is the other big difference. Romance languages normally put [[adjective]]s after the [[noun]]s to which they refer. For example, in English, a person may say ''I like fast cars'', but in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is ''Me gustan los coches rápidos''. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In [[German language|German]], verbs often come near the end of sentences (as: ''Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen''), whereas in English we usually put them between [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]], as: ''the cat has eaten the food''. 
 
 == Changing language == 
 Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more [[fluid]]. Sentences which English speakers find normal today, might have seemed strange 100 years ago. And they might not, because many of our favourite sayings come from the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], and from [[Shakespeare]]. 
 
 Different people speak with grammar that differs from that of other people.  For example, people who use the dialects called General [[American English]] and [[Received Pronunciation|BBC English]] might say, ''I didn't do anything'', while someone who speaks what is called [[African American Vernacular English]] or AAVE might say, ''I didn't do nothing''. [[London]] [[working class]] version: ''I ain't done nuffink!''  These are called ''double negatives'', and are found almost entirely in spoken English, and seldom written. 
 
 These differences are called [[dialect]]s. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using 'proper English', they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. < ref name= " Nash " > Nash, Walter 1986. ''English usage: a guide to first principles''. Routledge  &  Kegan Paul, London. Contains a list of sources. < /ref >  The models for ''spoken'' English in Britain are often called [[Received Pronunciation]] or BBC English. 
 
 == Parts of speech == 
 Grammar studies [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[conjunction]]s, [[sentence]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[interjection]]s. 
 
 === Nouns === 
 Nouns are 'thing' words like 'table and 'chair'.  They are [[wikt:object|objects]], things you see in everyday life.  Proper nouns are names of specific places, people, or other things like days of the week.  The name 'James' is a proper noun, as is 'Wednesday' and 'London'. Nouns can also be [[abstract]] things, such as 'suffering' or 'happiness'. 
 
 === Verbs === 
 Verbs are words that describe [[wikt:action|actions]]:  " Ryan threw the ball " . State:  " I am worried " . The basic verb form is called the [[infinitive]].  The infinitive for existence is  " to be " .  A famous example is the speech of [[Hamlet]]: ''To be or not to be, that is the question''. 
 
 Variations of the infinitive create [[Verb#Tense|verb tenses]].  
 {{col-begin}} 
 {{col-3}} 
 : < big >  [[Past tense]] = ''was'' < /big > 
 {{col-3}} 
 : < big > [[Present tense]] = ''is'' < /big > 
 {{col-3}} 
 : < big > [[Future tense]] = ''will/shall'' < /big > 
 {{col-end}} 
 
 === Adjectives ===  
 Adjectives describe nouns. For example, the pretty in  " pretty bicycle "  says that the bicycle is pretty. In other words, the  " pretty "  is describing the bicycle. This can also happen with a place. For example, the tall in  " that's a tall building "  is describing the building. 
 
 == Syntax == 
 Grammar studies [[syntax]] which is how the  " parts of speech "  fit together according to rules and create [[sentence]]s.  Sentences fit together and create [[paragraph]]s.
