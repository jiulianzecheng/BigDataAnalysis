 A '''mixotroph''' is an organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon. Usually this means that it may be either [[autotroph]] or [[heterotroph]] at different times in its life. Also possible are alternations between photo- and chemotrophy, or between litho- and organotrophy. Mixotrophs can be either [[eukaryote]]s or [[prokaryote]]s. < ref > Eiler, Alexander 2006.
