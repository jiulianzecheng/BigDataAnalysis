 '''Kaleva''' or '''Kalevi''' and his sons are people or creatures in [[Finland|Finnish]], [[Karelia]]n and [[Estonia]]n [[mythology|stories]]. However many things about them are forgotten.  
 
 == History == 
 === Estonian history === 
 The name of Estonian national Epos [[Kalevipoeg]] means  " Sons of Kalevi "  and the name of Finnish national epos [[Kalevala]] means  " Land of Kaleva " . 
 
 In Estonian stories sons of Kaleva are sons of [[King]].  
 
 === Finnish history === 
 Finnish people called [[Sirius]] ''Kalevant√§hti'' which means  " Star of Kaleva " . Belt of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] was called Kalevas [[sword]]. 
 
 
 In Finnish stories they are more often [[giant]]s. People told that some things in nature, like big or weird stones, are made by Kalevas sons. Stories tells that while people became Christians, they started to hate Kaleva's sons who remained pagans. Soon Kaleva's sons had to go away. All the time Christian people took more land, Kaleva's sons had to go farther away. At one island they staid and did not want to leave. [[Priest]]s came and they cursed Kaleva's sons until they took a big stone and sailed with it away. They have not been seen since that, but sometimes they come at night and hits crop or even forest down. 
 
 == Other creatures == 
 Almost the same thing happened to [[Hiisi]] people who resembles [[troll]]s. Christian humans made them to flee also.
