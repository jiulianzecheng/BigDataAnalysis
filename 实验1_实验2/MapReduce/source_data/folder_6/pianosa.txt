 '''Pianosa''' is a small (about 10 [[Square kilometre|km < sup > 2 < /sup > ]]) island in [[Italy]]'s [[Tuscan Archipelago]]. The name is derived from the latin word  " planasia "  (plain) because its highest point is some 22 [[metre|meters]] over sea level. Pianosa has no permanent residents. It is known in Italy for a maximum-security prison, where especially dangerous [[Mafia]] criminals are held. For administration, Pianosa is part of the [[Elba]] island municipality. On clear days, it can be seen from that island as a dark blue line over the lighter blue sea. 
 
 In the [[novel]] ''[[Catch-22]]'', a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Army Air Corps]] bomber squadron is based on the island during [[World War II]], 
 
 There is another, even smaller island called ''Pianosa'' off the [[Adriatic]] coast of Italy.
