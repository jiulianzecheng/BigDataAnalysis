 '''Francesco Petrarca ''' (20 July 1304 – 19 July 1374), known in [[English language|English]] as '''Petrarch''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] scholar, [[poet]], and one of the earliest [[Renaissance]] humanists.  
 
 Petrarch is often called the  " father of [[humanism]] " . < ref > There are many popular examples, for a recent one [http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=15299 this review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025064803/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=15299 |date=2012-10-25 }} of  Carol Quillen's ''Rereading the Renaissance'' < /ref >  Based on Petrarch's works, and to a lesser extent those of [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Pietro Bembo]] in the 16th century created the model for the modern [[Italian language]]. Petrarch is credited with developing the [[sonnet]] with his ''[[Il Canzoniere|Canzoniere]]'' to a level of perfection that would be unsurpassed to this day and spreading its use to other European languages. His sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. Petrarch was also known for being one of the first people to call the [[Middle Ages]] the [[Dark Ages]], although the negative myth as we know it today is largely the legacy of romantic literature.
