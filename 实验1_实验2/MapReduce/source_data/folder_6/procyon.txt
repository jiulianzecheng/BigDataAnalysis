 '''Procyon''' (α CMi, α Canis Minoris, [[Alpha]] Canis Minoris) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Canis Minor]]. < ref > " Procyon " . Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford University Press. 2nd ed, 1989. < /ref >  To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the [[list of brightest stars|eighth brightest]] in the night sky with a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.34. < ref > Kervella P. ''et al'' 2004. " The diameter and evolutionary state of Procyon A. Multi-technique modeling using asteroseismic and interferometric constraints.

 It is actually a [[binary star]] system of a white [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] F5 & nbsp;IV–V, named '''Procyon & nbsp;A''', and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DQZ, < ref > Provencal J.L. ''et al'' 2002. Procyon B: outside the iron box. ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''568''' (1): 324–334. [http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/568/1/324/] < /ref >  named '''Procyon & nbsp;B'''. 
 
 The reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic [[luminosity]] but its relative closeness to the [[Sun]]. Its distance was worked out by the [[European Space Agency]] [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite. < ref > Perryman M.A.C. ''et al'' 1997. The Hipparcos Catalogue.

Its closest neighbour is [[Luyten's Star]], about {{Convert|1.12|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off}} away. 
 
 Procyon forms one of the three [[Vertex figure|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]], along with [[Sirius]] and [[Betelgeuse]]. < ref name=Schaaf/ >  Its colour index is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it. < ref name=Schaaf > Schaaf, Fred 2008.
