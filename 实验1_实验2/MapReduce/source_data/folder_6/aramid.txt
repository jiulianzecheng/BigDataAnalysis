'''Aramids''' are [[polymer]]s. The name stands for ''aromatic polyamide''. Structurally aramids are similar to [[protein]]s. 
 
 == Overview == 
 [[Stephanie Kwolek]] developed aramids at [[DuPont]] in 1965. DuPont uses the trade name ''Kevlar'' for them..  
 
 Aramids are very present in security [[helmet]]s, in splinter-resistant glass, in [[Ballistic vest]]s, but also in other domains. They are used as a replacement for [[asbestos]] as a building material, for [[gasket]]s and other [[sealing]]s, but also as helpers to make [[sail]]s, [[parachute]]s and similar tools.
