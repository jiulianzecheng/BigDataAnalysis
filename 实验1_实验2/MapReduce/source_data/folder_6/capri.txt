 '''Capri''' < ref > pronounced 'Capree' in English < /ref >  is an island in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. It is on the north side of the [[Gulf of Naples]], [[Italy]]. The main town on the island shares the name. It has been a resort since the time of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Emperor [[Tiberius]] lived here from 26 & ndash;31 AD. 
 
 Features of the island are the Belvedere of Tragara (a high panoramic promenade lined with villas), the [[limestone]] crags called sea stacks that project above the sea (the ''Faraglioni''), the town of Anacapri, the Blue Grotto (''Grotta Azzurra''), and the ruins of the Imperial Roman [[villa]]s. 
 
 Capri is part of the region of [[Campania]], [[Province of Naples]]. Most people on the island live in the town of Capri. The island has two harbours, Marina Piccola and Marina Grande (the main port of the island). The separate ''[[comune]]'' of Anacapri is high on the hills to the west. 
 
 The etymology of the name 'Capri' is unclear. < ref > {{Cite book|first=Dana|last=Facaros|first2=Michael|last2=Pauls|title=Italy: Bay of Naples|url=https://archive.org/details/italybayofnaples00dana|isbn=1-86011-906-9|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/italybayofnaples00dana/page/244 244]}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|first=Arvid|last=Andr√©n|title=Capri: from the stone age to the tourist age|year=1980|isbn=91-85058-98-X|page=250}} < /ref >
