A '''macromolecule''' is a [[molecule]] with a large number of [[atom]]s. The word is usually used only when describing [[polymer]]s, molecules which are made up of smaller molecules called [[monomer]]s. All [[Organic chemistry|organic]] monomers are based on [[carbon]], usually with [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. There are [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] macromolecules based on other monomers. 
 
 ==Examples== 
 * [[Protein]]s, composed of [[amino acids]]. 
 * [[Nucleic acid]]s. 
 ** [[DNA]], composed of [[nucleotide]]s. 
 ** [[RNA]], similarly composed, differently structured 
 * [[Carbohydrate]]s, composed of [[monosaccharide]] [[sugar]]s. 
 * [[Lipid]]s or [[fat]]s  composed of [[fatty acids]] and [[triglycerides]]. 
 * [[Nylon]], composed of [[polyamide]]s. 
 * [[Polythiazyl]], composed of polymeric [[sulphur]] nitride (SN) < sub > x < /sub > .
