 An '''allemande''' ({{lang-it|allemanda}}) is a [[dance]] that was popular in [[Baroque music]] of the [[17th century|17th]] and early [[18th century|18th centuries]].  The word comes from the [[French language|French]] word for  " German " . 
 
 Composers of the Baroque period often wrote a group of dances called a [[suite (music)|suite]].  There was usually an allemande, a [[courante]], a [[sarabande]] and a [[gigue]], in that order. Sometimes there were one or two other dances as well.  Sometimes a suite started with a [[prelude]] (an introductory [[movement (music)|movement]]) before the allemande. 
 
 The allemande was played at a moderate speed - not very fast, nor very slow.  There were usually 4 beats in a [[bar (music)|bar]] (4/4 time) but also sometimes in 2/2 time, and it started with an [[anacrusis]] (an upbeat, i.e. one, or possibly a small group of notes which were not on the first beat of a bar).
