 '''''Cryptosporidium''''' is a [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]] which causes  outbreaks of [[diarrhea]].  
 
 A number of species of ''Cryptosporidium'' can infect [[mammals]]. The most common species to infect man is ''Cryptosporidium parvum''. The diarrhea can become severe in children, and in people whose [[immune system]] is weakened. It is often found in [[HIV]] patients who have diarrhea. In healthy adults, the infection is usually brief. 
 
 It is difficult to identify in the [[laboratory]]. The oocytes can be seen under a microscope, but they may be confused. < ref name=Lab_Dx > {{cite journal |last1=Casemore D.P; Armstrong M.  &  Sands R.L 1985. |title=Laboratory diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis |journal=Journal of Clinical Pathology |year=1985 |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1337–41 |pmid=2416782 |pmc=499488 |doi=10.1136/jcp.38.12.1337 }} < /ref >  Most cryptosporidia are 3-6 μm in size, but some reports have described larger cells. < ref name=Lab_Dx / >  New real-time monitoring can detect ''Cryptosporidium'' better than the older spot testing and batch testing methods. 
 
 If ''Cryptosporidium'' is suspected in the water, the safest option is to boil water used for drinking. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2008-09-02|title=Boil water warning 'precaution'|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7589839.stm|access-date=2022-09-06}} < /ref >
