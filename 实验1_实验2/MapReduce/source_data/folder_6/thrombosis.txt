'''Thrombosis''' (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a [[blood clot]] ('''thrombus'''; Greek: θρόμβος) inside a [[blood vessel]], blocking the flow of [[blood]] through the [[circulatory system]]. When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses [[platelets]] (thrombocytes) and [[fibrin]] to form a [[blood clot]] to prevent blood loss.
