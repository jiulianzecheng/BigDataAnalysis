 '''Groping''' is intentionally touching someone else, in a sexual way, without that person's [[consent]]. Generally, the term has a negative [[connotation]]. In some countries, certain forms of groping count as [[sexual assault]]. < ref > The Age, 12 June 2019, [https://www.theage.com.au/national/nsw/disgusting-man-sentenced-for-groping-female-runner-on-sydney-s-bay-run-20190612-p51x1t.html 'Disgusting': man sentenced for groping female runner on Sydney's Bay Run] < /ref >  Most countries consider it unacceptable behaviour.  
 
 Note that if the other person [[Consent|wants to be touched]], for example for a [[massage]], or other sexual activity, this is not groping.  A doctor touching the body as part of a medical examination is also not groping. Areas of the body most frequently groped include the [[buttocks]], [[Breast|breasts]], [[vulva]] and [[Thigh|thighs]] on a woman, and the [[penis]], [[Testicle|testicles]] and buttocks on a man. Gropers might use their hands, but pressing any part of their body against another person can be considered groping. 
 
 The practice that customs officials touch other people in a search, for example at airports, is controversial. Usually, there are rules of how a person is to be searched. Very often, people are searched by officials of the same sex.  
 
 Groping is often shown in [[Pornography|pornographic]] [[movies]].
