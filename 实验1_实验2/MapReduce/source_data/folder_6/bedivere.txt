He and Arthur fought the [[Giant]] of [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. < ref name=KA/ >  He lost one hand in a battle. Only he and Arthur survived the  " Battle of Camlan " . But Arthur received a [[wound]] in the battle and was dying. Arthur commanded Bedivere to throw his magical sword Excalibur back into the Lake.
