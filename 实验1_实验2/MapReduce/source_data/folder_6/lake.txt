 A '''lake''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''lacus'') is a large body of water (larger and deeper than a [[pond]]) within a body of land. As a lake is separated from the [[ocean]], it is not a [[sea]]. Some lakes are very big, and people in the past sometimes called them seas. Lakes do not [[Flux|flow]] like [[river]]s, but many have rivers flowing into and out of them. 
 
 Most lakes on the surface of the [[Earth]] are [[fresh water]] and most are in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. More than 60% of the lakes of the world are in [[Canada]]. [[Finland]] is known as ''The Land of the Thousand Lakes'' (there are 187,888 lakes in Finland, of which 60,000 are large). < ref > [http://www.stat.fi/index_en.html Statistics Finland] < /ref > 
 
 Many lakes are man-made [[reservoir]]s built to produce [[electricity]], for [[recreation]], or to use the water for [[irrigation]] or [[industry]], or in [[house]]s. 
 
 If there are not rivers flowing out of the lake (see [[Endorheic basin]]), or they are few and small, the lake loses water only by [[evaporation]] or because the water flows through the [[soil]] [[pore]]s. Where the water evaporates rapidly and the soil around the lake has a high [[salt]] level, as in very dry places, the water of the lake has a high [[concentration]] of salt and the lake is called a '''[[salt lake]]'''. Examples of salt lakes are the [[Great Salt Lake]], the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Aral Sea]], and the [[Dead Sea]]. 
 
 == Largest lakes by continent == 
 
 * '''Africa''' - [[Lake Victoria]], also the second largest freshwater lake on Earth. It is one of the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes of Africa]]. 
 * '''Antarctica''' - [[Lake Vostok]]. 
 * '''Asia''' - [[Lake Baikal]] is the largest lake that is completely in Asia. The [[Caspian Sea]], the largest lake on Earth, is on the Europe-Asia border (an artificial border) and so both continents share this lake. 
 * '''Australia''' - [[Lake Eyre]], that most of the time is without water; it takes water when it rains a lot. 
 * '''Europe''' - [[Lake Ladoga]], followed by [[Lake Onega]], both in northwestern [[Russia]]. 
 * '''North America''' - [[Lake Superior]]. 
 * '''South America''' - [[Lake Maracaibo]] but it is like a bay because it has a wide opening to sea. The largest freshwater lake of [[South America]] is [[Lake Titicaca]], which is also the highest body of water on Earth at 3,821 m (12,507 ft) above sea level where [[boat]]s can travel. 
 
 == Notable lakes == 
 * The '''largest''' lake in the world by area is the [[Caspian Sea]], with 394,299 km². The '''largest freshwater''' lake by area is [[Lake Superior]] (82,414 km²), part of the [[Great Lakes]]. 
 * The '''longest''' freshwater lake is [[Lake Tanganyika]], with a length of about 660 km. [[Lake Baikal]] is the second longest (about 630 km from tip to tip). 
 * The '''deepest''' lake is [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Siberia]], with a bottom at 1,637 m (5,371 ft). [[Lake Tanganyika]] (1,470 m) is the second deepest lake. 
 * The '''highest''' lake of the world is a small lake ([[pond]]) without a name on Ojos del Salado at 6,390 m (20,965 ft). < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.andes.org.uk/peak-info-6000/ojos-info.htm |title=Information about Ojos del Salado volcano |access-date=2008-02-16 |archive-date=2007-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427082230/http://www.andes.org.uk/peak-info-6000/ojos-info.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  But the highest navigable lake is [[Lake Titicaca]] in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] at 3,812 m (12,507 ft). 
 * The '''lowest''' lake of the world is the [[Dead Sea]], bordering [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] at 418 m (1,371 ft) below sea level. It is also one of the lakes with highest [[salt]] concentration. 
 * [[Lake Enriquillo]] in [[Dominican Republic]] is the only saltwater lake in the world where [[crocodile]]s live.
