 '''Equilibrioception''' is the [[sense]] of [[balance]]. This is what prevents a person or animal from falling over while walking or doing other physical activity. 
 
 ==In humans== 
 In humans, equilibrioception is mainly sensed by the detection of acceleration, which occurs in the [[vestibular system]]. Other senses play roles as well, e.g. the [[visual system]] and [[proprioception]]. The importance of visual input for balance is illustrated by its being harder to stand on one foot with eyes closed than with eyes open. < ref > {{cite web|title=Equilibrioception|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/e/equilibrioception.htm|website=ScienceDaily|access-date=15 January 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518202058/http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/e/equilibrioception.htm|archive-date=18 May 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 The sense of balance often gets worse as a person [[ageing|ages]]. After a [[stroke]], it may be improved with the help of special training. < ref name= " Hammer et al.
