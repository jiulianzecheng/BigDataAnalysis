A '''stromule''' is a [[microscopy|microscopic]] structure found in [[plant cell]]s. Stromules (stroma-filled tubules) are highly dynamic structures extending from the surface of all [[plastid]]s, including [[chloroplast]]s.    
 
 Protrusions from and interconnections between plastids were seen in 1888  and 1908, and have been described from time to time in the literature since then. < ref > Haberlandt, Gottlieb 1888.
