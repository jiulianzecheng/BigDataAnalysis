 '''''Palaeoscincus''''' (meaning  " ancient [[skink]] "  in Greek) is a [[genus]] of [[ankylosauria]]n [[dinosaur]] based on [[teeth]] discovered in [[Montana]]. < ref name = " JL56 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Leidy | first1 = J. | year = 1856 | title = Notice of remains of extinct reptiles and fishes, discovered by Dr. F. V. Hayden in the Bad Lands of the Judith River, Nebraska Territories | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 72â€“73 }} < /ref >  Like several other dinosaur genera named by [[Joseph Leidy]] (''[[Deinodon]]'', ''[[Thespesius]]'', and ''[[Trachodon]]''), it is an historically important genus with a convoluted taxonomy that has been all but abandoned by modern dinosaur [[paleontologist]]s. Because of its wide use in the early 20th century, ''Palaeoscincus'' is often shown with the [[Armour (zoology)|armor]] of ''[[Edmontonia]]'' and the tail [[club (zoology)|club]] of an [[ankylosaurid]].
