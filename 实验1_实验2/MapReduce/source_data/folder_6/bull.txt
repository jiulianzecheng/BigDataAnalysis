 A '''bull''' is an intact (i.e., not [[Neutering|castrated]]) adult [[male]] of the species ''[[Cattle|Bos taurus]]''. They are more muscular and aggressive than the female of the species, the [[cow]]. The bull has long been an important symbol in many cultures, and plays a large role in [[beef]] [[ranching]], [[dairy farming]]. They are also important in other cultural activities, including [[bull fighting]] and [[bull riding]]. The management of livestock animals in hot climates is a challenge. The physiological and behavioral changes induced in these animals compromise their welfare, breeding, health, and zootechnical performance, resulting in final products (eggs, milk, and meat) with unsatisfactory characteristics. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=de Castro Júnior |first1=Sérgio Luis |title=The specific enthalpy of air as an indicator of heat stress in livestock animals |journal=International Journal of Biometeorology |year=2021 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=149–161 |doi=10.1007/s00484-020-02022-8|pmid=32968875 |s2cid=221861063 }} < /ref >

 ==Life== 
 The bull semen market is very lucrative. Animal agriculture forcefully breeds animals to have what it considers the best traits for food production. In 2011, the U.S. exported $124.7 million worth of bull semen to other nations, representing 32 percent of the global market. In February 2019, an Angus bull named SAV America 8018 sold for the record-breaking price of $1.5 million due to “superior genetics.” 
 A bull can live up to 18 - 22 years.
