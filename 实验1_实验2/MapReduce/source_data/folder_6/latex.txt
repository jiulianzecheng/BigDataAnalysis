 }}'''LaTeX''' is a [[computer program]] used for making articles, books and math [[formula]]s look good. LaTeX is well-suited for expressing mathematical formulas on electronic devices in a more human readable format, by showing them in a way similar to how they would be written by hand.  
 
 LaTeX is used for making mathematical formulas for some articles on [[Wikipedia]], in addition to being used within academic circles. 
 
 The writer types their article into a plain text document. A plain text document cannot have [[formatted text|styled text]], like [[bold]] or [[italic]]. When the writer wants to write styled text, they use special LaTeX commands that start with a backslash ( < code > \ < /code > ). For example, the command for bold text is  < code > \textbf{This text is bold} < /code > . 
 
 After the writer is finished writing the article, they tell LaTeX to [[Interpreter (computing)|read]] the document. After LaTeX is done, LaTeX makes a file that can be printed. The command  < code > \textbf{This text is bold} < /code >  would print as '''This text is bold'''. 
   
 LaTeX was first made in the early 1980s by [[Leslie Lamport]] at [[SRI International]], who published its first manual in 1986. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#latex | title=The Writings of Leslie Lamport: LaTeX: A Document Preparation System | author=Leslie Lamport | date=April 23, 2007 | work=Leslie Lamport's Home Page | access-date=2011-08-17}} < /ref >  The current version is LaTeX2e (styled [[File:LaTeX2e logo.svg|middle|x20px|\LaTeXe]]), which has been active since 1994. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/#Introducing_LaTeX_and_its_Strengths|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2019-07-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2020-08-07}} < /ref >

 \begin{document} 
   \maketitle 
   \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{} 
   typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop publishing 
   features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of 
   typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and 
   cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, 
   and much more. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by Leslie 
   Lamport and has become the dominant method for using \TeX; few 
   people write in plain \TeX{} anymore. The current version  is 
   \LaTeXe. 
 
   % This is a comment; it will not be shown in the final output. 
   % The following shows a little of the typesetting power of LaTeX: 
   \begin{align} 
     E  & = mc^2                              \\ 
     m  & = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} 
   \end{align} 
 \end{document}

 ==Academic contributions to LaTeX== 
 In order to support mathematical typesetting, the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) has made the '''AMS-LaTeX''' package. < ref > Grätzer, G. (2013). Math into LATEX: An introduction to LATEX and AMS-LATEX. Springer Science  &  Business Media. < /ref >  AMS also founded '''MathJax''', a [[JavaScript|Javascript]] extension to display mathematical formulas on [[web browsers]], with the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.mathjax.org/#about|title=MathJax: About Us|date=2020-08-07|website=MathJax|language=en|access-date=2020-08-07}} < /ref >
