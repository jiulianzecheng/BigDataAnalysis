 '''Cytochromes''' are [[haemoprotein]]s (or [[proteins]] containing [[haem]] groups). They make [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by [[electron transport]]. 
 
 They are found either as single (monomeric) proteins (e.g., [[cytochrome c]]) or as part of bigger [[enzyme]] complexes which [[catalysis|catalyze]] [[redox]] reactions. 
 
 The haem group does the redox reactions. These include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their [[oxidation]] state changed. In general, redox reactions involve the transfer of [[electrons]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Cytochromes were described in 1884 as [[respiratory pigment]]s. They include ([[haemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]], [[haemocyanin]], [[haemoerythrin]] and  [[chlorocruorin]]. < ref > A respiratory pigment increases the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood. < /ref > < ref name=MacMunn > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1886.0007 | jstor = 109482 | pages = 267–298 | author1 = MacMunn C.A. | title = Researches on myohaematin and the histohaematins | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 177 | publisher = The Royal Society | year = 1886| s2cid = 110335335 }} < /ref >  In the 1920s, [[David Keilin|Keilin]] rediscovered these respiratory pigments. He called them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”, and classified them as haem proteins. 
 
 == Types == 
 Several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by [[spectroscopy]]. Three types of cytochrome are distinguished by their prosthetic groups. < ref > Prosthetic group  = add-on bit which makes it work < /ref > 
 In [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, these cytochromes are often combined in electron transport and related [[metabolism|metabolic pathways]].
