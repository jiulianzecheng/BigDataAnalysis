 The '''Sphenodontia''' is a diverse group of reptile. It includes only one living genus, the [[tuatara]] (''Sphenodon''). An alternative name for the order is the '''Rhynchocephalia'''.  
 
 They are an offshoot from the  [[evolution]]ary  line leading to the [[lizard]]s and [[snake]]s. They had many families during the late  [[Triassic]] and  [[Jurassic]] periods but then declined. They are now are the least successful of the lepidosaurs. < ref > Evans S.E.  &  Jones M.E.H. 2010. The origin, early history and diversification of lepidosauromorph reptiles. In Bandyopadhyay S.

 The only surviving member today is the [[New Zealand]] [[tuatara]].
