 == History == 
 In old times Shakargarh was used as a route for the [[Mughal]]s to enter Gurdaspur and going to [[Delhi]]. During [[British Raj|British rule]] (before the independence of Pakistan), Shakargarh became the [[capital (city)|capital]] of Shakargarh Tehsil. 
 
 In 1947 when the British were leaving, they divided [[British India]] between Pakistan and the modern republic of India. The border between the two countries was known as the [[Radcliffe Line]] (this was named after Cyril John Radcliffe who drew the borders). The line divided Shakargarh from the rest of [[Gurdaspur district]] (which then became part of India). Shakargarh then became part of [[Sialkot District]], however when Narowal District was created in 1991, Shakargarh became part of that district.
