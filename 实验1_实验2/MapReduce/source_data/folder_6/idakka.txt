The '''''idakka''''' ([[Malayalam]]: ഇടയ്ക്ക, literally'', in the middle''), also spelt '''edaykka'''/'''edakka''', is an hourglass-shaped drum from [[Kerala]] in south [[India]]. This handy percussion instrument is very similar to the pan-Indian damaru. < sup > [''citation needed''] < /sup >  While the damaru is played by rattling knotted cords against the resonators, the idakka is played with a stick. Like the damaru, the idakka's pitch may be bent by squeezing the lacing in the middle. The idakka is slung over the left shoulder and the right side of the instrument is gently beaten with a thin curve-ended stick.
