{{distinguish|monarchy{{!}}Monarchism}} 
 
 '''Royalism''' is the political [[ideology]] that supports a specific [[monarch]] ([[king]], [[queen]], or [[pretender]]) as [[head of state]] for a country. Royalism is not to the same as [[monarchism]], which supports a monarchical system of government, but not always a specific monarch. For example, in 19th-century France, a royalist might be either a [[House of Bourbon|Legitimist]], [[House of Bonaparte|Bonapartist]], or an [[House of Orléans|Orléanist]].
