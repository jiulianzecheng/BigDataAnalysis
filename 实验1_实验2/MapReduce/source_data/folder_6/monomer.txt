A '''monomer''' is a single [[atom]] or [[molecule]] which is able to join with other monomers to make new substances called [[polymer]]s. < ref name= " mwm " > {{cite web |url=http://www.materialsworldmodules.org/resources/polimarization/2-polymers+monomers.html#Part1 |title=Polymers and Monomers |first= |last= |work=materialsworldmodules.org |year=2002 |accessdate=15 March 2012 |archive-date=7 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307165338/http://www.materialsworldmodules.org/resources/polimarization/2-polymers+monomers.html#Part1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The words come from the Greek language where ''mono'' means  " one " , ''poly'' means  " many " , and ''meros'' means  " a part " . A feature of monomers is that they have two [[carbon]] atoms which are joined, called a carbon [[double bond]]. < ref name= " mwm " / >  The double bond allows the monomer to make the long chains of polymers. < ref name= " mwm " / >  There are thousands of different monomers. Examples of monomers include [[monosaccharide]] which is simple sugar, [[glycerol]], [[amino acid]] and [[nucleotide]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20101/bio%20101%20lectures/biochemistry/biochemi.htm |title=Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry |first= |last= |work=faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu |year=2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The most made monomer is [[ethylene]].
