 A '''stone''' is a piece of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It is a mass of hard, [[wikt:compact|compacted]] [[mineral]]. The word is often used to mean a small piece of rock. 
 
 The word  " stone "  also refers to natural rock as a [[material]], especially a [[building material]]. Natural stones used as building material include [[granite]], [[marble]] and [[sandstone]]. Manufactured, [[artificial]] products, such as [[concrete]] or [[clay]] [[brick]]s, are not stone. 
 
 Stone takes a while to heat up, and stays hot for a while. It does not conduct electricity well 
 
 Stone was one of the first materials used to make [[tool]]s and buildings. It is a very sturdy material. It is less affected by [[weather]] than [[wood]] or [[brick]]. Depending on the type of rock, stone [[weathering|weathers]] away much more slowly. A stone in the river is reshaped by the water and [[sediment]] flowing around it. 
 
 Stones can be used as primitive weapons. A person can throw it at an enemy or animal, or use it to cause more damage in hand-to-hand combat. 
 
 A stone is larger than a grain of [[sand]], [[gravel]] or [[pebble]]s. A [[boulder]] is a large rock or stone.
