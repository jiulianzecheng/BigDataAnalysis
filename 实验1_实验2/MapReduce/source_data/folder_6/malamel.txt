 '''Malamel''' is a village in Pathanapuram Taluk in [[Kollam district]], [[Kerala]], [[India]]. This village is situated between [[Anchal]] and Valakom bypass road. In [[Malayalam]], Malamel means  " Top of the hill " . 
 
 ==Rock Temples== 
 At Malamel, there is a huge rock on which there is a famous Shiva Temple. A temple festival is held on 3 December. The temple has 5 doors and is considered to be divine and ancient because of the close proximity of ''Jadayupara'' ([[Chadayamangalam]]) (the rock that ''Jadayu'' carried on his wings).  It has also a cave at extreme left of the temple, which a British Adventurer in the year 1946, tried in vain to venture into, and which leads to the [[Kulathupuzha|Kulathupuzha Forest]].  This cave is believed to be a haven for very venomous [[Snake|snakes]]. 
 Famous temples like ''Arackal Devi Temple'' and ''Perumannur Devi Temple'' are nearby.  [[Kottarakara Sree Mahaganapathy Kshethram]] is 12 & nbsp;km away. 
 
 [[Kottarakara]] and [[Punalur]] are the towns nearest to the village.
