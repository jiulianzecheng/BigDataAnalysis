However, I don't think it was a finished album. I was smoking hella weed. I was high all the fucking time and it wasn't even helping me perceive what was going on musically.

" I had no idea what was going on 90 percent of the time, "  she admits.  " I was young and partying every day and I was enjoying myself a little too much. I was also doing nothing a lot, so that whole era was really a blur for me. " }} < /ref >
