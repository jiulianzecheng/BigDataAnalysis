'''Aether''' was the God of [[light]] in [[Greek mythology]]. He was the son of Erebus and Nyx. Aether is one of the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial deities]], the first-born [[elemental]]s. 
 
 Damascius says that Aether, [[Erebus]] and [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] were siblings, and the offspring of [[Chronos]] (Father Time). According to Epiphanius, the world began as a [[cosmic egg]], encircled by Time and Inevitability (most likely Chronos and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]]) in serpent fashion. Together they constricted the egg, squeezing its matter with great force, until the world divided into two hemispheres. After that, the atoms sorted themselves out. The lighter and finer ones floated above and became the Bright Air (Aether and/or Ouranos) and the rarefied Wind (Chaos), while the heavier and dirtier atoms sank and became the Earth ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]) and the Ocean ([[Pontos]] and/or [[Oceanus]]). < ref name= " Theoi " / >  See also Plato's [[Myth of Er]].
