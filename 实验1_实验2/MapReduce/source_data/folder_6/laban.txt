[[Laban]] was a [[person]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] whose [[name]] is [[Hebrew]] for [[white]].  
 
 Laban’s [[father]] [[Bethuel]] was the [[son]] of Nahor, who was a [[brother]] of [[Abraham]]. Laban and his father [[Bethuel]] arranged for Laban’s [[sister]] [[Rebecca]] to marry [[Isaac]]. Laban had two [[daughter]]s [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]].  
 
 When [[Jacob]] asked Laban to let him marry Rachel, Laban had Jacob work for him as a [[shepherd]] for seven years and then tricked him into marrying Leah instead because Leah was the older [[sister]]. Laban then made Jacob work another seven years to marry [[Rachel]].  
 
 After that Laban hired Jacob as a [[shepherd]] and cheated him for the next six years. Then Jacob decided that he couldn’t continue working for Laban so he left Laban’s [[country]] with his [[wives]] [[Rachel]], [[Leah]], [[Bilhah]] and [[Zilpah]] and all their children and [[sheep]] but Jacob made sure not to take anything that belonged to Laban. But Rachel stole Laban’s [[idol]]s and took them with her without telling Jacob.  
 
 So Laban left to [[kill]] Jacob but then the Lord appeared to Laban in a [[dream]] and told him not to hurt Jacob. So Laban didn’t. To convince Laban that he didn’t do it, Jacob [[curse]]d the [[person]] who stole Laban’s [[idol]]s to [[die]].  Then Laban looked in Rachel’s [[tent]] but she hid the [[idol]]s so Laban and Jacob made [[peace]].
