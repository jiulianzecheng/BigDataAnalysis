 '''Ornithischia''' is an extinct clade of mainly herbivorous dinosaurs characterized by a pelvic structure superficially similar to that of birds. 
 
 The name Ornithischia, or  " bird-hipped " , reflects this similarity and is derived from the Greek stem ornith- (ὀρνιθ-), meaning  " of a bird " , and ischion (ἴσχιον), plural ischia, meaning  " hip joint " . However, birds are only distantly related to this group as birds are [[theropod]] dinosaurs. 
 == Overview == 
 
 Ornithischians with well known anatomical adaptations include the [[ceratopsia]]ns or  " horn-faced "  dinosaurs, the [[pachycephalosaur]]s or  " thick-headed "  dinosaurs, the armored dinosaurs (Thyreophora) such as [[stegosaur]]s and [[ankylosaur]]s, and the [[ornithopod]]s. 
 
 There is strong evidence that certain groups of ornithischians lived in herds, often segregated by age group, with juveniles forming their own flocks separate from adults. 
 
 Some were at least partially covered in filamentous pelts, and there is much debate over whether these filaments found in specimens of Tianyulong, Psittacosaurus, and Kulindadromeus may have been primitive feathers.

 They are known as the 'bird-hipped' dinosaurs because of their hip structure. However, [[Origin of birds|birds]] actually descended from the 'lizard-hipped' dinosaurs, the [[Saurischia]]. The name  " Ornithischia "  means  " bird-hipped, "  and birds also have pelvises in which the pubis points backwards.  
 
 An alternative name for the order is the '''Predentata''', because all of them are [[beak]]ed [[herbivorous]] dinosaurs. The beak is in front of the jaw-bone, the [[dentary]], so it is a 'predentary'. The upper half of the beak is the 'premaxilla' on the end of the upper jaw. The beak is a key [[adaptation]] for cropping plants for their food. 
 
 Their original ([[basal]]) form of locomotion was [[bipedal]]. However, from early in their evolutionary history, they were capable of both bipedal and [[quadrupedal]] locomotion. < ref > Wilson J.A; Marsicano C.A.  &  Smith R.M.H. 2009.

 The ornithischia has two sub-orders: 
 *[[Thyreophora]]: the armoured dinosaurs: [[Ankylosaur]]s and [[Stegosaur]]s. 
 *[[Cerapoda]]: the duck-billed and horned dinosaurs. 
 
 == Plants == 
 Their vegetarian diet included: 
 *[[Seed fern]]s: [[Pteridospermatophyta]]. [[Upper Triassic]], [[Jurassic]].  
 *[[Cycads]] and other woody [[seed plants]], common during [[Mesozoic]] period. 
 *[[Gymnosperms]] ([[Conifer|conifers]]): [[Jurassic]], [[Cretaceous]]. 
 *[[Angiosperms]] (flowering plants): [[Cretaceous]] 
 *[[Algae]] in the form of [[seaweed]]: no direct evidence, but likely. 
 
 This group of dinosaurs would not be able to reach the taller conifers. The other main group of vegetarian dinosaurs, the [[sauropodomorph]]s, were specialists able to reach [[vegetation]] on the tall trees.
