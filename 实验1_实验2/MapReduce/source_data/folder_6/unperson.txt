 In the [[George Orwell]] book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]], an '''Unperson''' in [[Newspeak]] is someone who has been vaporized. Vaporization is when a person is secretly [[murder]]ed and [[:en:Forced disappearance|erased]] from society, the present, the [[universe]], and existence. Such a person would be taken out of [[book]]s, [[photograph]]s, and articles so that no trace of them is found in the present anywhere – no record of them would be found. This was so that a person who defied the Party would be gone from all citizens' memories, even friends and family. There is no [[Newspeak]] word for what happened to unpeople, therefore it is [[thoughtcrime]] to say an unperson's name or think of unpeople.  
 
 This is similar to the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] [[USSR|Soviet]] Party erasing people from photographs after death; this is an example of  " real "  unpeople. 
 
 The Stalin-era Soviet Union also provided real-world examples of unpersons in its treatment of [[Leon Trotsky]] and other members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] who became politically inconvenient. In his 1960 magazine article  " Pravda means 'Truth' " , reprinted in ''Expanded Universe'', [[Robert A. Heinlein]] argued that John Paul Jones and a mysterious May 15, 1960 [[cosmonaut]] had also received this treatment.
