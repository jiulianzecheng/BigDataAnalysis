'''Shahmukhi''' is a set of letters used to write the [[Punjabi language]] by Punjabi speakers in [[Pakistan]]. It is written from right to left.  
 
 The Shahmukhi script is based on the Perso-Arabic script which is used to write [[Urdu]]. Shahmukhi cannot be called an alphabet; it is really an ''[[abjad]]''. An abjad is a script that has letters to represent [[consonant]]s but not [[vowel]]s. Of course, Shahmukhi, and other scripts relating to it, are impure abjads. This means that there are ways to represent vowels in the writing but they are used in a very bare method.  
 
 There are 38 letters in the Shahmukhi abjad. This may seem like a lot to learn, but the letters are really not too difficult to remember.
