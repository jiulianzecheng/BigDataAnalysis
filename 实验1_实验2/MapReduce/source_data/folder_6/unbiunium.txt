{{Infobox unbiunium}}'''''Unbiunium''''' is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the [[periodic table]]. It is also known as eka-actinium. 
 Its [[atomic number]] should be 121 and it has the symbol '''''Ubu'''''. The name Unbiunium and the symbol Ubu are temporary [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names (meaning  " one-two-one "  in Latin). This name and symbol exist until a permanent name is decided and the element is created. It is expected to be a F-block element and in a group call the super[[actinides]]. It is the third element in the eighth period of the periodic table. 
 
 == Creation attempts == 
 The synthesis of unbiunium was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of [[uranium]]-238 with [[copper]]-65 ions at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]:
