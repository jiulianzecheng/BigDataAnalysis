'''Ecumenism''' (or '''Oecumenism''') is the idea that the different [[Christian denomination]]s should work together more than they currently do. This idea is different from [[religious toleration]]. Over the years, [[Christianity]] has been split into many different movements. These separations are based on [[doctrine]], on history, and what people do in everyday life.  
 
 The term '''ecumenical''' comes from the Latin ''oecumenicus'', a phrase referring to  " the whole world " , meaning literally  " inhabited "  (lived in). < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ecumenical?r=75 & src=ref & ch=dic ecumenical on dictionary.com] < /ref >  In Christianity the qualification ecumenical is originally (and still) used in terms such as [[Ecumenical council]] and [[Ecumenical patriarch]]. The meaning pertains to the totality of the larger Church (such as the Catholic Church or the Orthodox Church). It is not restricted to one of its local churches or dioceses.
