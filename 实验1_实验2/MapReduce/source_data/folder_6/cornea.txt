 The '''cornea''' is the front part of the [[eye]]. It is the clear [[transparency|transparent]] section of the [[eye]]. The cornea covers the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], [[pupil]], and the eye chamber. It is a special form of tissue. The cornea is clear and has no blood vessels. It has nerves, but with no [[myelin]] sheaths on them. 
 
 The cornea, with the [[Lens (eye)|lens]], [[Refraction|refracts]] light. The cornea and the lens bend light so the image strikes the [[retina]]. The cornea does about two-thirds of this refraction. < ref name= " Cassin " > {{cite book |last1=Cassin B.  &  Solomon S. 1990 |title=Dictionary of eye terminology |location=Gainsville, Florida |publisher=Triad Publishing Company }} < /ref > < ref name= " Goldstein " > {{cite book |last=Goldstein, E.
