A '''raion''' (or '''rayon''') is the name of a way several former [[Soviet]] [[republic]]s are divided. The word is from French ''rayon'' which means '[[:wikt:honeycomb|honeycomb]], [[department]]'. < ref > [[Merriam-Webster]]'s ''Third New International Dictionary'' (1961, repr. 1981), s.v. ''raion''. < /ref >  It describes both a type of a [[Administrative division|subnational entity]] and a division of a city. It is commonly written in English as  " [[district]] " . Raion also can be used simply as a second division without anything to do with ethnicity or nationality. A raion is usually two steps below the national level. In smaller countries it could be the first level. 
 
 After the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], some of the republics kept the ''raion'' (e.g. [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Regions of Belarus|Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Federal subjects of Russia|Russia]], [[Moldova]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]) while others dropped it (e.g. [[Georgia]], [[Uzbekistan]],  [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Administrative divisions of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]).
