It belonged to the Vinča culture which inhabited all of today's Serbia with over 150 Vinča sites and minor parts of Western Romania, northwestern Bulgaria, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Southeastern Hungary.

 The Prince cautiously did not proclaiming independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war.

Its ruler gradually freed himself from Ottoman control and Bucharest became the capital. The abolition of [[serfdom]] led to a [[coup d'état]] against the Prince staged by peasants who overthrew the regime.

When the Allies eventually won the war, the [[Austria-Hungarian Empire]] was dissolved and an independent Hungarian republic was proclaimed.

 The [[Great Depression]] meant social unrest, high unemployment, strikes and riots, especially a miners' strike in 1929 in Valea Jiului and a strike in Griviţas maintenance workshops. By the mid-1930s, with a recovering Romanian economy, industry grew, although about 80% of Romanians still were engaged in agriculture. 
 
 ==== Iron Guard ==== 
 In end of [[1930s]], Romania's liberal democracy was slowly being replaced by the [[Fascism|fascist dictatorship]]. The Archangel Michael Legion, known as the [[Iron Guard]] organization, was led by [[Corneliu Codreanu Zelea]]. In 1937 elections the party supported [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] and got 15.5% of the votes and became the third biggest party. In 1938 king [[Carol II of Romania]] seized power over Romania.

 [[Carol II of Romania]] declared the country as neutral when [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, but included since the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina an alliance with [[Nazi Germany|Hitler's Germany]]. This occurred after field marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] forced the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] Carol II of Romania to abdicate. Antonescu appointed himself  " conducator " , Romania's dictator, and signed at the [[Tripartite Pact|November 23 of 1940]] three-powers pact with Nazi Germany. Hitler's Germany was dependent on a continuous importation of [[fuel]] and crude [[oil]] from the Romanian oil fields of [[Ploesti]]. In 1940, yjr [[Kingdom of Hungary]] took over the legitimate domination in Northern [[Transylvania]] to the end of the [[World War II]]. 
 
 The country's troops fought together with the German Wehrmacht against the Soviet Union. 
 In summer of 1941, Romania join Hitler's war against the Soviet Union in combination also [[Finland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]] join Hitlers war. Romania built [[concentration camp]]s and began conducting a [[Pogrom|massive persecution of Jews]], of which became very extreme in the city of Iasi. 
 
 ===Holocaust in Romania=== 
 Romania participated in the Holocaust. The author of the book  " The Destruction of the European Jews "  Raul Hilberg writes follow:  " There was / ... / moment when the Germans actually had to intervene and slow the speed with which the Romanian measures were taken. "  The hunt for Jews in eastern Romania (including Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transnistria and the city of Iasi) had more the character of pogroms than the German, well-organized camps and transport. 
 
 There were pogroms in the city of Iasi. The homes for the Jewish minority in Iasi were marked with crosses. On June 27, 1941, Ion Antonescu make a phone call with the city's mayor and Antonescu said into the phone:  " clean the city [[Iasi]] from the Jews. "  And the Holocaust in Romania has began. Police officers and many civilians went to every Jewish home marked with a cross in the town and murdered thousands of Jews on the same day. 
 
 In June 1941, the Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu gave an  " illegal secret order "  to the special police force. He ordered the police in cooperation with the Romanian Army and the German SS troops to kill all Jews in east Romania within the next coming years. The Jews living on the countryside was being killed right on the spot. The Jews in the cities were first collected in the ghettos and later deported away. 
 
 On October 22, 1941 the Soviet union with bombs blow up the Romanian military headquarters in Odessa, and killed 66 Romanian soldiers. As revenge Ion Antonescu decided that for every dead Romanian officer, 200 Soviet communists must be killed and for each dead soldier, 100 communists must be killed. All other Communists were imprisoned and Jewish families were taken hostage in the hope that the partisan movement would cease its operations. < ref name= " levandehistoria.se " > http://www.levandehistoria.se/book/export/html/2661 < /ref > < ref name= " romania.bloggsida.se " > {{Cite web |title=Allt om Rumänien fakta – bättre än Wikipedia|url=http://romania.bloggsida.se/okategoriserade/allt-om-rumanien-fakta-battre-an-wikipedia |access-date=2012-01-05 |archive-date=2012-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408080406/http://romania.bloggsida.se/okategoriserade/allt-om-rumanien-fakta-battre-an-wikipedia |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The day after in Bucharest, on October 23, 1941, around 5 000 people and the majority were Jews was arrested who later executed by [[hanging]]. In the Soviet village [[Dalnik]], almost 20,000 Jews were incarcerated in to several locked buildings and burned alive. < ref name= " levandehistoria.se " / > < ref name= " romania.bloggsida.se " / > 
 
 After the massacre, many of the Jews who remained in [[Odessa]] were sent to various concentration camps. Nearby [[Odessa]] on October 25, 1941, approximately 40,000 Jews, was gathering together on a special closed military secured area, and the Jews had to stay outdoors for more than ten days without food or supply. Many died of cold and starvation. The survivors were murdered one month later. < ref name= " levandehistoria.se " / > 
 < ref name= " romania.bloggsida.se " / > 
 
 Totally approximately 469,000 Jews had been murdered by the military and police in Romania between 1941 and 1944, including the 325,000 murdered Jews in [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina]]. 
 
 ===End of war=== 
 At the end of 1943, the Red Army liberated most of Soviet territory and started advancing westward from its borders to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies. It was in this context that the Soviet forces crossed Romania. If the Soviet Union could hit Romania, Nazi Germany's last hope is gone, said the military leadership of the Red Army. Russians deposited the entire 1.5 million soldiers in the attack against Romania and Romania last reserves consisting only of 138 000 soldiers. During the summer of 1944 it began the attack on Bessarabia (Moldova) and the Romanian army fled the area. On 2 August, the whole Bessarabia (Moldova) is captured by the Red Army. The Russians then went a long way in Romania and on 23 August they reached into the Romanian capital Bucharest. The public opinion turned in the country against Antonescu and of summer 1944 he was deposed and imprisoned. The new government signed a ceasefire and extradited itself to the [[Soviet Union]]. The Red Army killed the members from the old fascist regime (including [[Ion Antonescu]]) on June 1, 1946. 
 
 At the end of the war, Romania was allowed to keep the whole of [[Transylvania]] in west and [[Dobruja]] from south, but lost [[Bessarabia]]/[[Transnistria]] and [[Odessa Oblast]] in the east (with rich oil reserves) which became parts of the Soviet Union. [[Bukovina]] was split in half because in the north part the majority ethnic group was Ukrainian and in the south part Romanian. 
 
 The Soviet Union replaced the royal [[monarchy]] with a communist regime in 1947. The Soviet Union took the country's resources, which led to increased [[poverty]] in Romania.

 In 1989, the National Salvation Front came into power. It was led by [[Ion Iliescu]]. When they came into power, several other [[wikt:party|parties]] from before World War II were remade. These included the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] and the [[Romanian Social Democrat Party]]. In April 1990, as a result of several [[wikt:rally|rallies]], [[wikt:protest|protests]] started. The people who protested did not [[:wikt:recognize|recognize]] the results of the [[wikt:election|election]]. This was because they thought that members of the National Salvation Front were communists. More and more people protested, and it became a demonstration – a very big protest. This was called the [[Golaniad]], and it became very violent. 
 
 When the National Salvation Front lost power, several other parties were made. These were the [[Partidul Social Democrat|Social Democratic Party]], the Democratic Party, and a couple of other parties from before the war. The Social Democratic Party ruled Romania from 1990 until 1996. Ion Iliescu was the head of state, or person in charge. After 1996, several other parties came into power and lost it. In 2004, [[Traian Băsescu]] became the president. 
 
 After the [[Cold War]], Romania became closer friends with [[Western Europe]]. In 2004, Romania joined [[NATO]] and hosted the 2008 summit. < ref > {{Cite news|title =NATO update: NATO welcomes seven new members|url =http://www.nato.int/docu/update/2004/04-april/e0402a.htm|publisher=NATO|accessdate=2008-08-31}} < /ref >  The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the [[European Union]] and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007. < ref > {{Cite news|title=EU approves Bulgaria and Romania|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5380024.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-08-31}} < /ref >

 [[File:Physical map of Romania.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[Map|physical map]] of Romania.]] 
 
 Romania is a part of southeastern Europe. It borders the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Danube|Danube River]]. The [[Carpathian Mountains]] lie in the center. 
 
 Romania is the biggest country in southeast [[Europe]] by population. It has an [[area]] of {{convert|238391|km2|mi2|0|lk=on}}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.status-invest.com/en/site/press/investorbg-02-04-2007/ |title=ROMANIA, SERBIA |accessdate=2008-07-24 }} < /ref >  It is the [[List of European countries in order of geographical area|twelfth-largest]] country in Europe. Most of Romania's border with [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]] is made by the Danube. The Danube joins the [[Prut River]]. The Prut River makes the [[Moldova]]n–Romanian border. The Danube then flows into the area of the [[Black Sea]] inside Romania. This makes the [[Danube Delta]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Informații despre Delta Dunării|url=https://www.twinkl.ro/teaching-wiki/informatii-despre-delta-dunarii|access-date=18 September 2023|publisher=Twinkl Educational}} < /ref >  The [[river delta|delta]] is a [[biosphere]] [[wikt:reserve|reserve]] and a [[biodiversity]] [[World Heritage Site]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/588|title=Danube Delta|publisher=UNESCO's World Heritage Center|accessdate=2008-01-09}} < /ref >  Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the [[Siret River|Siret]], the [[Olt River|Olt]], and the [[Mureş River|Mureş]]. The Siret River runs from the north to the south of [[Moldavia]]. The Olt River runs from the Carpathian Mountains to [[Oltenia]]. The Mureş runs through Transylvania from the east to the west. 
 
 ===Landscape=== 
 The land in Romania is made up of equal parts of mountains, hills, and low-lying areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. [[List of mountain peaks in Romania|Fourteen of its mountain ranges]] are taller than {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The tallest mountain in Romania is [[Moldoveanu Peak]], with a peak altitude of {{convert|2544|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/geo_tal_mou_mou-geography-tallest-mountains-mountain |title=Geography Statistics  >  Tallest mountains  >  Mountain |accessdate=2008-07-24 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Rivers=== 
 The Danube is the longest [[river]] in Romania. Its [[length]] inside Romania is about {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|lk=on}}. That is almost half of the length of the entire Danube. Almost all of the rivers in Romania are either [[wikt:direct|direct]] or [[wikt:indirect|indirect]] [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Danube. 
 
 ===Weather=== 
 Romania has a [[climate]] that changes between [[temperate climate|temperate]] and [[continental climate|continental]] climates. The reason for the climate changes is because Romania is near the coast. Romania has four different seasons. The average temperature during the year is {{convert|11|°C|°F|1|lk=on}} in southern Romania and {{convert|8|°C|°F|1|lk=on}} in the northern part. < ref name=climate > {{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/34.htm|title=Romania: Climate|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=2008-01-10}} < /ref > 
 
 Lots of rain and snow falls on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as [[snow]]. In the southern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow that falls is around {{convert|60|cm|in|1|lk=on}}. < ref > {{in lang|ro}}{{citation|url=http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap1.pdf|title= The 2004 Yearbook|publisher=Romanian National Institute of Statistics|accessdate=2008-08-19}} < /ref >

 Romania joined the [[European Union]] on January 1, 2007. Romania's [[economy]] is healthy. Currently, Romania makes around $350 billion in [[Gross domestic product]] and a [[GDP per capita]] of $16,540. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2006 & ey=2013 & scsm=1 & ssd=1 & sort=country & ds=. & br=1 & c=968 & s=PPPGDP,PPPPC & grp=0 & a= & pr.x=13 & pr.y=7|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Long into the 1900s, Romania was still a largely agricultural country. During Communism 1947-1989, the country had planned economy. The transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the 1990s, the reasons was that more money was printed, expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies, which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment. The reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in Romania. When it was going well for industry in the Latin countries such as [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], they began to trade with Romania. Foreign companies have expanded in Romania since then, and spurs the market. 
 
 Romania has the highest percentage of homeowners in Europe.  The fall of communism prompted many Romanians to purchase the flats they lived in cheaply while the country underwent a wave of [[Privatization|privatisation]] and devaluation of the currency. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Quinio|first=Akila|last2=Smith|first2=Alan|date=2023-08-22|title=Extreme renting: how rising rates turned the screws on tenants across Europe|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2748d160-03ee-433c-b822-6c07918d1797|access-date=2023-08-22}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Education== 
 In Romania school is compulsory for 10 years. Children have the opportunity to be part of a voluntary [[Preschool|pre-school]] for age 3–6 years. After school, students can voluntarily take the entrance exam to high school, which has a range of practical and theoretical lines. There are over 40 higher educational institutions, including five [[University|universities]] and five [[Technical college|technical colleges]]. Tuition is free and is a hot political commitment even at the university. The country's minorities can have instruction in their native language. Since 1989, education has been reformed. But it has been slow and the standard of education varies greatly in different parts of the country, Education has improved the standard of urban compared to rural areas where quality can be very low. Romania participates fully in the EU's education program. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.manskligarattigheter.se/php/rapporter/documents/Europa+och+Centralasien/Rum%25E4nien,+MR-rapport+2010.pdf|title=Regeringens webbplats om mänskliga rättigheter|website=www.manskligarattigheter.se}}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >

 Living standards were very low at the end of the Communist era, but the situation improved a little bit during the 1990s. The large privatization  resulted in high unemployment and rising prices.

The State social insurance system has relatively broad coverage but resources are extremely small. 
 
 Reforms have been initiated and in 1999 the health insurance became privatized and paid by the employers and the employees. Several thousand local [[trade unions]] were founded after the revolution, which were later combined into federations. These unions and federations have helped organise students, pensioners and the unemployed; because these groups of people all have similar needs, concerns and goals. 
 
 By the first quarter of 2011 the average monthly household income is 2,318 [[Romanian leu]] (equivalent to approximately £862 USD). Income is 36% higher in the urban area than in the countryside. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.ro/images/romania/pdf/Romanian_households_September_2011.pdf|title=Read @Kearney: Romania}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >

 The most worrying thing is the fact that there are more pensioners than the number of working people. because many who dismissed during the privatizations had per-retirement. Romanian Pensioners average pension at the month is at about 190 euros (equivalent to approximately £250-300 USD). The current low average retirement age (55 years for men and 57 years for women) will be gradually increased until 2014, when it gets to 60 years for women and 65 years for men. 
 
 Many of the country's Gypsies have no identity cards and are therefore are excluded from the social benefit systems, schools and health care. The State-run health care is free, but the care system is neglected and has deteriorated in recent years due to lack of resources and underpaid staff. In many cases, the patients pay  " under the table "  to get treatment. There is evidence to suggest that a patient's wealth plays an important role in how they receive medical treatment. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.manskligarattigheter.se/php/rapporter/documents/Europa+och+Centralasien/Rum%25E4nien,+MR-rapport+2010.pdf|title=Regeringens webbplats om mänskliga rättigheter|website=www.manskligarattigheter.se}}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Science and technology== 
 [[File:Traian Vuia aircraft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Traian Vuia]], early flight pioneer]] 
 
 Historically, Romanian researches and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields, such as: [[aeronautics]], medicine, mathematics, computer science/engineering, physics, biophysics, chemistry, [[biochemistry]] and biology. In the history of flight, [[Traian Vuia]] and [[Aurel Vlaicu]] built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, while [[Henri Coandă]] discovered the [[Coandă effect]] of [[fluidics]]. Preceding him, [[Elie Carafoli]] was a pioneering contributor to the field of aerodynamics in the world. 
 
 [[Victor Babeş]] discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, [[babesiosis]]; biologist [[Nicolae Paulescu]] discovered [[insulin]]. Another biologist, [[Emil Palade]], received the [[Nobel Prize]] for his contributions to [[cell biology]]. [[George Constantinescu]] created the [[theory of sonics]], while [[Lazăr Edeleanu]] was the first chemist to synthesize [[amphetamine]] and also invented the modern method of [[Oil refinery|refining]] [[crude oil]]. [[Costin Neniţescu]] found new methods for the synthesis of [[pirilium]] salts, of [[carbene]]s, [[tryptamine]], [[serotonin]], two new syntheses for the indole nucleus, and a new method of [[polymerisation]] of [[ethylene]]. 
 
 Several [[mathematics|mathematicians]] distinguished themselves as well, among them: [[Gheorghe Ţiţeica]], [[Spiru Haret]], [[Grigore Moisil]], [[Miron Nicolescu]], [[Nicolae Popescu]] and [[Ştefan Odobleja]]; the latter is also regarded as the ideological father behind [[cybernetics]]. 
 
 Notable physicists and inventors also include: [[Horia Hulubei]] in atomic physics, [[Șerban Țițeica]] in theoretical physics, [[Mihai Gavrilă]] specialized in quantum theory and discoverer of the [[atom|atomic dichotomy]] phenomenon, [[Alexandru Proca]] (known for the first meson theory of [[nuclear forces]] and [[Proca's equations]] of the vectorial mesonic field), [[Ştefan Procopiu]] known for the first theory of the [[magnetic moment]] of the electron in 1911 (now known as the [[Bohr-Procopiu magneton]]), [[Theodor V.
