 A '''chlorofluorocarbon''' (CFC) is a [[gas]] used for various purposes including solvents, [[refrigerant]]s, and [[aerosol spray]]s. They are [[organic chemical]]s and contain [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[chlorine]], and [[fluorine]]. They were much used in the middle of the 20th century, replacing chemicals that were [[toxicity|toxic]] or [[flammability|flammable]] or had other problems.  
 
 In 1978, Sweden became the first country that [[banned]] CFC products. Later, the US and Canada did the same. Now, CFC products are not allowed in most countries, because they cause [[ozone depletion]]. CFCs are [[greenhouse gas]]es. An alternative to chlorofluorocarbons is [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs). These do not destroy the [[ozone layer]] or increase [[global warming]]. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/science/earth/09montreal.html?ref=earth |title=A novel tactic in climate fight|author=John M.
