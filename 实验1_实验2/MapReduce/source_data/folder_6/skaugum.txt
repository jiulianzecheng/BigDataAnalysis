 == History == 
 The estate belonged to a church in the [[Middle Ages]]. Many people owned it over the years, but in 1909 [[Fritz Wedel Jarlsberg]] bought it. Then, when Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha got married in 1929, Wedel-Jarlsberg sold it to them. In 1937, Prince Harald was born there. 
 
 The house that Wedel-Jarlsberg had, which looked like a [[Swiss chalet]], burned down in 1930. < ref > {{Citation|last=Torvanger|first=Åse Moe|title=Herman Backer|date=2023-01-27|url=https://nbl.snl.no/Herman_Backer|work=Norsk biografisk leksikon|language=no|access-date=2023-10-23}} < /ref >  An architect named Arnstein Arneberg built a new one on the same spot, using the old foundations. They used stone to build it, so it wouldn't catch fire again. 
 
 === Second World War === 
 During [[World War II]], Nazi soldiers stayed at Skaugum. Then, the estate became the official home of a man named Reichskommissar Josef Terboven in June 1940. After [[Hitler]] died, Terboven lost his job and [[suicide|killed himself]] there in 1945. < ref > {{citation |first1=Christian |last1=Goeschel |title=Suicide in Nazi Germany | page=152 |publisher=OUP Oxford |year=2009 |isbn=978-0191567568 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIjccRg7_UYC & pg=PA152 |access-date=23 October 2023}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2015-05-08|title=Mens hele Norge feiret freden, reiste Hitlers forhatte rikskommisær til Skaugum og sprengte seg|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/mens-hele-norge-feiret-freden-reiste-hitlers-forhatte-rikskommisaer-til-skaugum-og-sprengte-seg/60668426|access-date=2023-10-23|website=[[Dagbladet]]|language=no}} < /ref > 
 
 === Residence of the [[heir apparent]] === 
 In 1968, [[King Olav V]] gave the estate as a wedding gift to his son, [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]], and his wife, [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Crown Princess Sonja]]. The King moved to the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] in Oslo. King Harald did the same thing, giving the estate to his son, Crown Prince Haakon, and his wife, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, when they got married in 2001. 
 
 Skaugum is different from the Royal Palace because it's privately owned by the royal family. It's not open to the public. Like other royal homes in Norway, there are Royal Guards there to protect it.
