 '''Juventas''', also known as '''Iuventus''' or '''Juventus''' ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]] equivalent: [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]), was an [[List of Roman deities|ancient Roman goddess]]. She represented youth and rejuvenation.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=857}} She was mostly the goddess of young men  " new to wearing the [[toga]] "  ''(dea novorum togatorum)'' or, men who had [[wikt:just|just]] [[Adult|come of age]]. < ref > [[Tertullian]], ''Ad nationes'' 2.11 < /ref > < ref > [[Augustine of Hippo]], ''De civitate Dei'' 4.11 < /ref > {{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=858}} 
 
 Many [[Association|associations]] ''([[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]])'' were made for Juventas in the Italian [[Municipium|municipalities]]. They are known because of [[wikt:inscription|inscriptions]].{{sfnp|Madigan|2013|p=99}} 
 
 == Temple and early cult == 
 Juventas owned a [[shrine]] in the cella of [[Minerva]] on the [[Capitoline]], that most likely was made at about 218 BC. At this time, she was compared with the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe.]] Dionysius < ref > [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 3.69.5. < /ref >  and [[Livy]] < ref > [[Livy]] 5.54.7. < /ref >  thought that she and the god [[Terminus]]  " refused "  to do the [[ceremony]] of reversal ''(exauguratio)'' when [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin]] desired to rebuild the temple district on the Capitoline. Even though other gods were moved, these two were part of the new structure.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=848}} Dionysius also thought that the semi-legendary [[king]] Servius Tullius made a temple fund for Juventas, and each family had to contribute to it. < ref > Dionysius 4.15.5 < /ref > {{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=848}} The thought that she was a part of ancient Roman religion depends mainly on these two aetiological legends, as she is not seen in the early history of [[Roman festivals]].{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=846}}{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=848}} 
 
 On the advice of the [[Sibylline Books|Sibylline books]], which were read during [[Anxiety|anxieties]] about the [[Second Punic War]], Juventas was part of [[Sacrifice|sacrifices]] in 218 BC relating to a [[lectisternium]], a public [[feast]] at which images of gods were displayed as if the gods were part of it. < ref > [[Livy]] 21.62.9 and 36.36.5 < /ref > {{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=835, 848  &  851–852|ps=; citing also [[Kurt Latte]] for the date}} Like other deities whose cult was ordained by the Sibylline books, Juventas was called ''ritu graeco'', following   " Greek "  rite.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=858}} Also at the lectisternium of 218 BC, a supplication was performed at the Temple of [[Hercules]]. In [[Greek myth]], the divinized Hercules had Hebe as his wife. The cultivation of both deities at the time of the Second Punic War seems intended to reinvigorate men of fighting age: Juventas  " was regarded as a powerful divine force rendering a vital gift of strength at a critical moment. " {{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=858}} This is also the first time the ''Genius Publicus'' ( " Genius of the People " ) is written. After the [[wikt:disastrous|disastrous]] Battle of Lake Trasimene in April 217 BC, Juventas, Hercules, and the Genius Publicus were excluded for a time from divine honors, as they were not thought to have been effective.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=858}} Marcus Livius Salinator vowed a temple to her during the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], when he faced Hasdrubal in 207 BC—an indication that Juventas was still felt to have power.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=858}} 
 
 A procession ''(supplicia canum)'' in which Romans carried crucified dogs passed between the Temple of Juventas and that of [[Summanus]]. A late source dates the  " punishment of the dogs "  to August 3.{{sfnp|Scullard|1981|p=170}} 
 
 == Imperial era == 
 On Imperial coins, Juventas and [[Spes]] ( " Hope " ) are often associated with the reigning [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]. A prayer to Juventas and Spes marked the anniversary of [[Augustus]]'s coming of age.{{sfnp|Fears|1981|pp=862, 899}} Juventas was among the many ''Virtutes'' ( " Virtues " ) to appear on the coinage of [[Antoninus Pius]].{{sfnp|Fears|1981|p=903}}
