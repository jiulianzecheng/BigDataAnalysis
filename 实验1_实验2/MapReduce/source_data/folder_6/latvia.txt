 '''Latvia''' ([[Latvian]]: ''Latvija''), officially the '''Republic of Latvia''' ([[Latvian]]: ''Latvijas Republika''), is a country in [[Northern Europe]]. The capital is [[Riga]]. It is one of the [[Baltic States]], together with [[Estonia]] in the north and [[Lithuania]] in the south. Latvia's neighbours to the east are the countries [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]. Latvia is split into four parts called [[Kurzeme]], [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]], and [[Latgale]]. 
 
 People from Latvia are called '''Latvians'''. They speak the [[Latvian language]], which is a little like the [[Lithuanian language]], though not close enough to be understood. 
 
 == History == 
 Latvia was settled by the [[Baltic]] tribes thousands of years ago. They mainly fished, hunted, and traded. 
 
 German traders and crusaders came to Latvia at the end of the 12th century. Latvians lost control of their homeland. Over the next 800 years, Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles, and Russians all invaded Latvia. Latvia finally became independent in 1918. 
 
 During the 13-15th centuries there was the [[Teutonic Order]] state occupied Latvian territory. 
 
 Before  World War I the aristocracy were mainly  German. 
 
 During the [[Great Northern War|Great Northern war]] (1700-1721) modern-day Latvia became the part of the [[Russian Empire|Russian empire]]. There were organized Courland and Livonia. 
 
 Latvian workers took part in the revolutionary struggle in 1905.  
 
 In 1940 Latvia became the Soviet republic was incorporated in Soviet Union. 
 It was under Nazi occupation during [[World War II]] in 1941-1944.  
 
 After the war a lot of factories were opened. Latvia became one of the successful Soviet republics. 
 
 In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed and the independent Latvian republic was restored. 
 
 == Politics  == 
 In [[Copenhagen]] on 13 December 2002, Latvia and nine other countries were invited to join the [[European Union]]. On 20 September 2003, Latvians held an election to vote on joining. Two thirds of Latvians voted to join, and on 1 May 2004, Latvia became a member of the EU. 
 
 Latvia has been a NATO member since 29 March 2004. 
 
 There are 43 local government units, set up in 2020.  36 are [[municipalities]] (Latvian: ''novadi'') and 7 state cities. Before 2020 there were 110 municipalities and nine republic cities. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Saeima finally approves major regional reforms|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/saeima/saeima-finally-approves-major-regional-reforms.a363362/|access-date=2023-09-10|website=eng.lsm.lv|language=en}} < /ref >
