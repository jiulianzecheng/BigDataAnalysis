 '''''Albertosaurus''''' was a relative of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. It was smaller than ''T. rex'' and lived a few million years earlier. ''Albertosaurus'' walked on two legs and had a large head with sharp, saw-toothed [[teeth]]. It had two-fingered hands on short [[arm]]s. Its long tail provided balance and quick turning. It had powerful back legs with clawed, three-toed feet. 
 
 ''Albertosaurus'' was about 30 feet (9 m) long, about 11 feet (3.4 m) tall at the hips, and up to 3 tons in weight (averaging roughly 2500 kg). Its lower [[jaw]] had 14 to 16 teeth; the upper jaw had 17-19 teeth. It had one row of teeth in each jaw and had at least one replacement tooth growing up under each working tooth. 
 
 ''Albertosaurus'' was more lightly built than ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Most ''Albertosaurus'' specimens were found in a single place. < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Currie | first2 = Philip J. | last3 = Inouye | first3 = Brian D. | last4 = Winn | first4 = Alice A. | year = 2010 | title = A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_canadian-journal-of-earth-sciences_2010-09_47_9/page/1269 | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1269–1275 | doi = 10.1139/e10-051 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1269E }} < /ref >   
 
 Compared with the robust tyrannosaurines (such as ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' and ''Tyrannosaurus''), albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg ([[tibia]]) and feet ([[metatarsal]]s and [[phalanges]]). < ref > Currie, Philip J. 2003. Cranial anatomy of tyrannosaurids from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta (PDF). ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'' '''48''' (2): 191–226. < /ref >  That suggests they were taking smaller or younger prey than ''Tyrannosaurus'', and were able to run faster to do so.
