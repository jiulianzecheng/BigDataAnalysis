 The '''Dicynodontia''' are a sub-group of the extinct animals called [[therapsid]]s. They were small to large [[herbivorous]] (plant-eating) animals with two tusks; 'dicynodont' means 'two dog tooth'. They are also the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 [[genera]] (types) known. 
 
 All of them had the same basic body plan. They were built like small tanks, with sturdy legs at each corner. They were not fast movers, but were obviously strong and lived in groups rather as many plant-eaters do today. < ref > This is suggested by the discovery of a fossil toilet area used by ''Dinodontosaurus''.

 Fossils discovered in [[Poland]] indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until about 200 million years ago (the [[Upper Triassic]] period. < ref name= " DSN08 " > {{cite journal |author=Dzik, Jerzy; Sulej, Tomasz  &  Niedźwiedzki, Grzegorz 2008.

 The dicynodonts were a group of [[therapsid]]s, but were not ancestors to the [[mammals]]. The group which evolved into mammals was the [[cynodont]]s.
