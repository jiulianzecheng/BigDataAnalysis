 A '''pencil''' is a kind of writing equipment that is also used to draw, usually on [[paper]]. Most pencil cores are made of [[graphite]] powder mixed with a [[clay]] binder. So, a pencil is usually made with a piece of [[graphite]] mixed with [[clay]] that has a [[wood]] case around it. The shape is usually a hexagonal [[prism]] but some pencils are square or [[cylinder]]. 
 
 Colored pencils are a kind that do not use greyish silver graphite. Instead, the core is colorful. Colored pencils or crayons are usually meant for [[drawing]] rather than writing. 
 
 == The difference between pens and pencils == 
 The important difference between [[pen]]s and pencils is that the tip of a pencil is made of solid [[graphite]] (or other material) which is rubbed off onto the paper.  A [[pen]] has a tip, usually made of metal, with liquid ink coming out and onto the paper.  Writing with a pen can smudge when it is still wet.  Writing from a pencil can be erased, but writing from a pen usually cannot, unless it uses a special type of ink and eraser. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Soviet made Iskusstvo pencils.jpg|thumb|Old Soviet colour pencils with box (circa 1959)]] An early writing tool was the [[Reed (plant)|reed]] [[pen]] used by [[ancient Egypt]]ians, who wrote with [[ink]] on sheets of [[papyrus]] paper.  
 
 Another early writing instrument was the [[stylus]], which was a thin stick of wood or metal, often [[lead]]. It was used for scratching onto black wax that covered white wood, a method used by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. The word ''pencil'' comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|pencillus}} which means  " little tail " . It is an invention of the 16th century in England. 
 
 === Discovery of graphite deposits === 
 Some time before 1565 (it may have been as early as 1500), a large deposit of [[graphite]] was found in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumbria]]. < ref name= " norgate " > {{cite web |url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/lgaz/lk00976.htm |title=Old Cumbria Gazetteer, black lead mine, Seathwaite |year=2008 |author=Martin and Jean Norgate, Geography Department, Portsmouth University |accessdate=2008-05-19

This deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. This is still the only large scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.cumbria-industries.org.uk/wad.htm  |title= Lakeland's Mining Heritage |publisher=www.cumbria-industries.org.uk |accessdate=2008-03-27 
 }} < /ref >  [[Chemistry]] was in its early stages and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called ''plumbago'' (Latin for  " lead ore " ). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/plumbago |title=Definition of Plumbago |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2007-04-21}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/plumbago |title=Definition of Plumbago |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2007-04-21}} < /ref >  The black core of pencils is still  referred to as ''lead'', even though it never had the [[Chemical element|element]] [[lead]].  
 
 The value of graphite was soon realized, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for [[cannonball]]s. The mines were taken over by the [[government|Crown]] and guarded. When enough stocks of graphite had been added up, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was needed. Graphite had to be sneakily moved out for use in pencils. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of holder. Graphite sticks were at first wrapped in string or in [[Leather|sheepskin]] for stability. The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide, attracting the attention of artists all over the known world.  
 
 England continued to have a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found. The distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], near the original findings of block graphite, has a pencil museum. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.pencilmuseum.co.uk/ |title=Keswick Pencil Museum |publisher=Pencilmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2009-07-23}} < /ref > 
 
 The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, [[sulfur|sulphur]], and [[antimony]].  
 
 Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC33124 |title=Graphite - Identification, toxicity, use, water pollution potential, ecological toxicity, and regulatory information|publisher=Pesticideinfo.org |accessdate=2009-07-23}} < /ref > 
 
 === Wood holders added === 
 The Italians first thought of wooden holders. In 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti created the first blueprints for the modern [[carpentry]] pencil to mark their carpentry pieces. < ref > {{cite web|title=Who invented the pencil?|url=http://www.rocketcityspacepioneers.com/space/who-invented-the-pencil|accessdate=9 May 2013|archive-date=22 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222072659/http://www.rocketcityspacepioneers.com/space/who-invented-the-pencil|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Their version was instead a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. They did this at first by hollowing out a stick of [[juniper]] wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the two halves then glued together–essentially the same method in use to this day. < ref > {{cite web|title=Origin of the pencil|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1586|accessdate=9 May 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 English and German pencils were not available to the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. France was under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain and could not import the pure graphite sticks from the British [[Grey Knotts]] mines – the only known source in the world for solid graphite. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s army to change this. In 1795, [[Nicholas Jacques Conté]] discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with [[clay]] and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a [[kiln]]. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian [[Joseph Hardtmuth]] of [[Koh-I-Noor (company)|Koh-I-Noor]] in 1790, remains in use. < ref > {{cite web|title=Invention of Modern Pencil Lead|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1588|accessdate=9 May 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. [[Henry Bessemer]]'s first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused. < ref > Bessemer, Henry.  " Sir Henry Bessemer, F.R.S: An Autobiography. Chapter 3. " < /ref >   
 [[File:Pencil manufacture.svg|thumb|right|200px|Pencil manufacturing. The top sequence shows the old method that required pieces of graphite to be cut to size; the lower sequence is the new, current method using rods of graphite and clay]] 
 
 American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the [[American Revolution]]. [[Benjamin Franklin]] advertised pencils for sale in his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' in 1729, and [[George Washington]] used a three-inch pencil when he surveyed the [[Ohio Territory]] in 1762.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It is said that [[William Munroe (pencil maker)|William Munroe]], a [[Cabinet making|cabinetmaker]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], made the first American [[wood]] pencils in 1812. This was not the only pencil-making occurring in Concord.  [[Henry David Thoreau]] discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the [[Binder (material)|binder]]; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in [[New Hampshire]] in 1821 by Charles Dunbar. 
 
 === Eraser attached === 
 [[File:LipmanPencilEraserPatent.jpg|thumb|220px|Drawing of pencil with an attached eraser from its patent application]]On 30 March 1858, [[Hymen Lipman]] received the first [[patent]] for attaching an [[eraser]] to the end of a pencil. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=19783 |title=US Patent 19783 Combination of Lead-Pencil and Eraser by L.

 The metal band used to mate the eraser with pencil is called a [[ferrule]]. 
 
 == Other attempts == 
 The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg, Germany in 1662. They used a mixture of graphite, sulfur and antimony. Though usable, they were not as good as the English pencils. 
 
 English and German pencils were not available to the French during the [[Napoleon]]ic wars. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon's army to change this. In [[1795]] Nicholas Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods which were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied (the more clay, the harder the pencil, and the lighter the color of the mark). This method of making pencils is still used today. 
 
 == Modern day pencils == 
 Today, pencils are made industrially by mixing finely ground graphite and [[clay]] [[powder]]s, adding [[water]], forming long [[spaghetti]]-like [[string]]s, and firing them in a [[kiln]]. The resulting strings are dipped in [[oil]] or molten [[wax]] which seeps into the tiny holes of the material, resulting in smoother writing. A [[juniper]] or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to make something called a slate, and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is [[glue]]d on top, and the whole thing is then cut into individual pencils, which are then [[varnish]]ed or [[paint]]ed. 
 
 A few common brands of colored pencils (among other items) are Crayola, RoseArt, Derwent, Faber Castell, Caran d'ache, and Cra-Z-Art.
