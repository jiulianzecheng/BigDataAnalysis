 '''Stabiae''' was a [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] settlement, about {{convert|4.5|km}} southwest of [[Pompeii]]. Like Pompeii,  this [[seaside resort]] was largely buried by [[tephra]] ash in the 79 AD [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD|eruption of Mount Vesuvius]], in this case at a smaller depth of up to five metres. < ref > Giovanna Bonifacio; Anna Maria Sodo, Gina Carla Ascione, In Stabiano - Cultura e archeologia da Stabiae , Castellammare di Stabia, Longobardi Editore, 2006. {{ISBN|88-8090-126-5}} p. 117-118 < /ref >  It is only  {{cvt|16|km|mi}} from [[Mount Vesuvius]]. 
 
 Stabiae is most famous for the Roman villas found near the ancient. They are some of the most stunning architectural and artistic remains from any Roman villas. < ref > Stabiae: Master Plan 2006, the Archaeological Superintendancy of Pompeii, School of Architecture of the University of Maryland, The Committee of Stabiae Reborn < /ref >  They are the largest concentration of well-preserved, enormous, elite seaside villas found from the entire Roman world. The villas were on a 50 & nbsp;m high headland overlooking the [[Gulf of Naples]]. < ref > [http://www.sdmart.org/exhibition-stabiano.html San Diego Museum of Art exhibition on Stabiae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095848/http://www.sdmart.org/exhibition-stabiano.html|date=10 February 2006}} < /ref > < ref name= " restoring " > [http://www.stabiae.org/foundation/en/ Restoring Stabiae website] < /ref >  Although it was discovered before Pompeii in 1749, unlike Pompeii and [[Herculaneum]], Stabiae was reburied by 1782 and so failed to establish itself as a destination for travellers on the [[Grand Tour]]. 
 
 Many of the objects and frescoes taken from these villas are now in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples]]. 
 
 There had already been a settlement there, before the Romans. The port of Stabiae already existed in the 6th century BC, but was much smaller than that of Pompeii. In 89 BC, [[Sulla]] descroyed much of Stabiae.[[Pliny the Elder]] rep√ºorted that the city was rebuilt soon afterwards. According to him, it was a popular destination for wealthy Romans.
