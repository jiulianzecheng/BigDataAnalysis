 The '''Odonatoptera''' are a [[superorder]] (sometimes treated as an [[order (biology)|order]]) of ancient flying [[insect]]s. 
 
 It includes all kinds of [[dragonflies]], and is placed in the [[Palaeoptera]].  
 
 The [[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]] are the only living members of this group. It was far more diverse in the late [[Paleozoic]] and contained gigantic species, including the griffinflies (or  " giant dragonflies " ) of the order [[Protodonata]]. This lineage dates back at least to the [[Pennsylvanian]], not quite 320 million years ago. & nbsp; < ref > Trueman, John W.H.  &  Rowe, Richard J. 2008: Tree of Life Web Project – Odonata.
