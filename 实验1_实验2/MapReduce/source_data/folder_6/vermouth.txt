 '''Vermouth''' is a sweet [[wine]], that has been converted to a [[Liquor|spirit]]. It usually has between 15 and 18 percent of [[alcohol]]. Also, certain [[herb]]s are added to flavour the wine. Its name is derived from a plant called [[Artemisia absinthium]], which makes it taste slightly bitter. It is often used for [[cocktail]]s. In its current form, Vermouth was first made in [[Turin]], in 1757. In the 19th century, it was also produced in [[France]]. Vermouth is also popular in parts of Spain. Vermouth is sometimes used as a [[substitute]] for [[white wine]] in [[cooking]].  
 
 Vermouth is not the same as the spirit called [[Absinthe]]. Absinthe is also based on Artemisia absinthium, but it has 45-50 percent alcohol per volume.
