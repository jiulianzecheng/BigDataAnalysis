 ==History== 
 
 The city of Temirtau, which was originally called the village of Samarkant, was founded by settlers of the [[Stolypin reform]] ([[:en:Stolypin reform|en]]) in 1905. 
 
 The construction of the city and its industrial buildings began because of the development of the Karaganda [[coal]] [[basin (geology)|basin]]. 
 
 During the [[Great Patriotic War]] (the Russian name for [[World War II]]), it was decided to build a [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] [[factory|plant]] in the Samarkant. The plant was built in the shortest possible time and already produced the first [[steel]] at the end of 1944. 
 
 On October 1, 1945, the workers' settlement of Samarkant officially received the status of a city with the name Temirtau. About 29,000 people lived in the city at that time. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-10-01|title=Как это было. 75 лет назад Темиртау получил статус города|trans-title=How it was. 75 years ago Temirtau received city status|url=https://ekaraganda.kz/?mod=news_read & id=100376|url-status=live|access-date=2023-11-20|website=eKaraganda.kz}} < /ref >
