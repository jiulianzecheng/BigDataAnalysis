 '''''Saltasaurus''''' was a large plant-eating [[dinosaur]] with an elongated neck and bony armored [[plate]]s on its [[body]]. It was a [[titanosaur]]id [[sauropod]] which lived during the late [[Cretaceous]] period, about 83 to 79 million years ago. Fossils have been found in [[Argentina]]. 
 
 It was the first [[genus]] of sauropod known to have [[armour]] of bony plates embedded in its skin. The small bony plates (called [[osteoderm]]s, a feature of modern [[crocodiles]]) have since been found on other titanosaurs.  
 
 == Description == 
 ''Saltasaurus'' was named by [[paleontologist]]s [[Jos√© Bonaparte]] and Jamie Powell in 1980. [[Salta Province|Salta]] is the name of the Northwestern Argentinian Province where fossils were found. They include: a few oval and circular armored plates, hundreds of bumps which covered its back (roughly 1/4 inch = 6-7 mm in diameter), and several incomplete skeletons, including some [[vertebrae]], limb [[bone]]s, and [[jaw]]s.
