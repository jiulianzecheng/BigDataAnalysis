 '''''Miacis''''' is a small [[extinct]] [[carnivore]] of the family [[Miacidae]]. They were small mammals which lived in forests and climbed trees, and ate small prey. They had the ancestral mammalian number of 44 [[teeth]]. In later members the number of teeth began to be reduced.  
 
 ''Miacis''  had brains that were relatively larger than those of the [[creodont]]s. The larger brain size compared to body size suggests their [[behaviour]] was becoming more flexible, and possibly more intelligent. 
 
 Miacids are either early members of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]] or in a larger group called the [[Carnivoramorpha]]. They may not be [[monophyletic]]. One professional opinion is that most ''Miacis'' species belong to the ancestors of the modern order, the [[crown group|crown-group]] Carnivora. < ref > Wesley-Hunt G.D.  &  Flynn J.J. 2005.

 The miacids lived 50 to 60 million years ago and were small omnivorous predators. According to one source, it preyed on smaller animals, such as small mammals, reptiles, and birds, and might have also have eaten eggs and fruits. < ref > Palmer D. (ed) 1999.

 Some experts think it is a [[paraphyletic]] [[taxon]]. < ref > P.D. Gingerich 1983. ''Systematics of Early Eocene Miacidae (Mammalia, Carnivora) in the Clark's Fork Basin, Wyoming''. Contributions from the Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan 26(10):197-225 < /ref >  In other words, they think the name ''Miacis'' covers a number of different species.
