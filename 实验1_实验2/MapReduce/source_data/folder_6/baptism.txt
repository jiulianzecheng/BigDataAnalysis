'''Baptism''' is a [[Ritual|rite]] or [[ceremony]] performed by [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] and [[Christianity|Christians.]] It is done as a cleansing [[symbol]]. For Christians it shows that the person being baptized has become a follower of [[Jesus]], and it can represent the joining of the Christian family. For Sikhs, taking Baptism or Amrit Sanskar is most important and it represent followers of Sikhism. 
 
 ==Methods== 
 [[Roman Catholicism]] baptize [[infant]]s to mark their becoming members of the church. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The Sacrament of Baptism}} < /ref >  It is a [[sacrament]] usually performed by a [[priest]]. In most other churches, it is when the person is old enough to decide that they are ready. 
 
 Some religious groups practice baptism by sprinkling a small amount of water on the person, usually their head. Other groups put the person inside the water.

 ==Bible times== 
 In the [[Old Testament]], a similar washing ceremony was done when priests were ordained. < ref > {{bibleverse||Leviticus|8:6,7}} < /ref >  Jesus was baptized by [[John the Baptist]] before he began his [[ministry]]. < ref > {{bibleverse||Matthew|3:13–17}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9–11}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21–23}} < /ref >  The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the person to be immersed totally or partially. But sprinkling, or pouring, was also practiced at an early day with sick and dying persons when total or partial immersion was not practical. < ref name=ABF > {{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=978-1603207782|pages=246, 247}} < /ref >
