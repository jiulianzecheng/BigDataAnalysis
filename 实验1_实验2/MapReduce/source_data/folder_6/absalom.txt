'''Absalom''' is a [[biblical]] name that means  " father of peace "  or  " my father is peace "  in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew.]] It has been used for centuries despite its association with a tragic figure in the Bible, Absalom, who rebelled against his father, King David. However, the name itself has a positive meaning as it combines two Hebrew words,  " ab "  and  " shalom, "  meaning  " father "  and  " peace "  respectively. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Absalom name Meaning and Origin|url=https://babys.name/detail-Absalom-Meaning-Origin-Famous-Similar-Sibling.html|access-date=2023-04-13|website=babys.name}} < /ref >
