[[Haran]] was a [[son]] of [[Terah]] and [[brother]] of [[Abraham]] who [[die]]d when Terah was still alive. According to a [[Midrash]] in the [[Talmud]], [[King]] [[Nimrod]] tried to [[burn]] [[Abraham]] but Abraham survived so Haran said that he believed in the [[God]] of [[Abraham]] and that the Lord would save him with a [[miracle]] like how He saved Abraham. So Nimrod threw Haran in the [[fire]] and Haran died.
