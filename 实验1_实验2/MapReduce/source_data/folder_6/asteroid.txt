 An '''asteroid''' is a [[minor planet]] that orbits within the inner [[Solar System|solar system]]. It is a small object in the [[Solar System]] that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]] but smaller. They range from very small (smaller than a [[car]]) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have [[asteroid moon]]. 
 
 The name  " asteroid "  means  " like a star "  in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]]. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think  " asteroids "  is not a good name, and think that the name  " planetoid "  ( " like a planet " ) would be a better name. 
 
 Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. He called it [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], and it is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Others, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] were found later. In the 1850s, so many had been found that they were numbered by a [[Minor planet designation]] starting with [[1 Ceres]]. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month. [[Asteroid impact prediction]] is one of their purposes.   
 
 Asteroids are the leftover [[rock (geology)|rock]] and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to come together to make a planet. Some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various [[asteroid spectral types]] including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon). 
 
 Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. < ref name= " Hogg1948 " > {{cite journal |last=Hogg |first=Helen Sawyer |title=The Titius-Bode Law and the Discovery of Ceres |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=242 |pages=241â€“246 |year=1948 |bibcode=1948JRASC..42..241S |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1948JRASC..42..241S/0000244.000.html |access-date=18 July 2021 |archive-date=18 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210718191659/http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1948JRASC..42..241S/0000244.000.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s. Some scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.
