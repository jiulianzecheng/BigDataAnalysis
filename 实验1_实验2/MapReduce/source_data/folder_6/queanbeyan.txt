 '''Queanbeyan''' is a  city in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is also the local government area called [[Queanbeyan City Council]]. It is very close to the [[Australia]]n federal capital city of [[Canberra]]. It is really now a part of the capital city as it is on the [[Australian Capital Territory]] border and is only {{convert|10|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from Canberra's [[Central business district|CBD]]. The border itself is marked by a [[railway]] line. The [[Queanbeyan River]] flows through Queanbeyan, near the centre of the city. 
 
 == History == 
 The town grew from a farm owned by ex-[[convict]] [[hotel|inn]] keeper, [[Timothy Beard]]. It was on the banks of the [[Molonglo River]]. The original name was ''Quinbean'' which means '' " clear waters " ''. 
 
 Queanbeyan became a township in [[1838]]. There were about 50 people living there. Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days. Traces of [[gold]] were found in [[1851]]. There were also some lead and silver mines. Settlers were often [[wikt:rob|robbed]] by [[bushranger]]s including [[John Tennant]], [[Jacky Jacky]], [[Frank Gardiner]] and [[Ben Hall]]. In 1836, the government built a Post Office at Queanbeyan.  < ref > [http://ndpbeta.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2203354?searchTerm=queanbeyan The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser Tuesday 22 March 1836]{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 The first bank was opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September, 1859. This was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited which is now part of the [[National Australia Bank]]. ''The Golden Age'' now called ''[[The Queanbeyan Age]]'' was Queanbeyan's first [[newspaper]] started in [[1860]] by [[John Gale (journalist)|John Gale]]. In 1880 John James Wright, the first [[mayor]] of Queanbeyan, built a house on the banks of the Queanbeyan River. In 1982 house became the Queanbeyan Art Centre. 
 
 The [[railway]] reached [[Queanbeyan railway station, New South Wales|Queanbeyan railway station]] in [[1887]] and it became the junction for the lines going to [[Canberra]] and [[Bombala]]. There are now two trains a day, the [[Countrylink]] Xplorer service between Canberra and [[Sydney]]. 
 
 Queanbeyan became an important country town, with 16 hotels and six [[flour]] mills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. Canberra was started as the national capital in 1911. There were no hotels, so people crossed the border to get a drink at Queanbeyan's hotels. When the Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1926, Canberra got it's first hotel. 
 
 Queanbeyan became a city on [[7 July]], [[1972]].  From 1982 to 1989, the [[Canberra Raiders]] [[rugby league]] team played their home games in Queanbeyan, at [[Seiffert Oval]].
