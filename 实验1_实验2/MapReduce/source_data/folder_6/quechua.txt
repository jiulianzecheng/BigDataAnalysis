'''Quechua''', sometimes written '''Quichua''' or '''Ketchua''', is a [[language]] spoken by 8 million people in the [[South America]]n nations of [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Argentina]] and [[Colombia]]. It was also the language of the ancient [[Inca|Inca Empire]]. It's part of the Quechuan languages family. 
 
 It is the most-spoken [[Native American]] language in South America. It is also the most widely-spoken [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] language. A quarter of people in Peru speak Quechua. People who speak Quechua as their first language are called Quechua Indians by Spanish-speakers. However, the Quechua refer to themselves as ''Runa'' ( " the people " ) and call their language ''Runa Simi''. 
 
 Quechua has only three vowel sounds: ''a'', ''i'', and ''u''. 
 
 Quechua has given names to many places in Peru, including the [[Ancash Region]]. ''{{lang|qu|Anqash}}'' is the Quechua word for ''blue'', and it is thought that the name refers to the region's blue skies.
