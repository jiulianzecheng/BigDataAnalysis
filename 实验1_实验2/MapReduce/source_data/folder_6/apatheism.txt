'''Apatheism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|θ|iː|ɪ|z|əm}}; a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[apathy]]'' and ''[[theism]]'') is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of [[God]](s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system. < ref name= " nooga.com " > {{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|title=Apatheism: Should we care whether God exists?|publisher=nooga.com|author=Sean Phillips|date=November 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805185445/http://nooga.com/164154/apatheism-should-we-care-whether-god-exists/|archive-date=August 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 30, 2018}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-apatheist-247851 |author=Austin Cline |title=What Is an Apatheist? |website=ThoughtCo. |date=July 16, 2017 |access-date=October 14, 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of God(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant. < ref name= " Von Hegner " > {{cite journal |last=Von Hegner |first=Ian |date=July 29, 2016 |title=Gods and Dictatorships: A Defence of Heroical Apatheism |url=http://researcherslinks.com/current-issues/Gods-and-Dictatorships-A-Defence-of-Heroical-Apatheism/9/5/237/html |journal=Science, Religion  &  Culture |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=31–48 |doi=10.17582/journal.src/2016/3.1.31.48 |s2cid=55902977 |access-date=October 14, 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 Scientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as [[theism]], [[atheism]], and [[agnosticism]], with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions. < ref name= " Von Hegner " / >  Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism  " uncharted territory in the [[philosophy of religion]].
