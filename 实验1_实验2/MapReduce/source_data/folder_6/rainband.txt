 A '''rainband''' is an area of rainfall where all the [[cloud]]s and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are stretched out in a long line or band. < ref > Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

(2011). In Encyclopædia Britannica. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/606551/tropical-cyclone] Retrieved on 2011-05-15. < /ref >  Tropical cyclone rainbands include rain showers and [[thunderstorm]]s. When this includes an [[eyewall]] and the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], they make a [[tropical cyclone|hurricane or tropical storm]]. The size of rainbands around a tropical cyclone helps to measure the cyclone's intensity. 
 
 Rainbands that form near and ahead of [[cold front]]s can be [[squall line]]s which can produce [[tornado]]es. The shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains. The mountains block the winds which can then form a low-level [[barrier jet]]. Bands of thunderstorms can form when [[sea breeze]] and [[land breeze]]s meet, if enough moisture is present. Sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front, can hide the location of the cold front itself. Rainbands in an [[extratropical cyclone]] can cause large amounts of [[rain]] or [[snow]]. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of large, warmer bodies of water such as the [[Great Lakes]]. If the air is cold enough, these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls.
