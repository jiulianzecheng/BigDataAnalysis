 '''Incest''' means [[sexual intercourse]] between people who are closely [[wikt:relation|related]]. Usually, this means members of the same family. In many societies, it is [[wikt:forbidden|forbidden]] by [[law]] and [[religion]]. Which relatives it is forbidden to have sex with depends on the law, religion and culture. 
 
 Incest is now regarded as bad for the [[Genetics|genetic]] health of the offspring, and it is often forbidden by present-day religions and laws. < ref > Levesque, Roger J.R. 1999. ''Sexual abuse of children: a human rights perspective''. Indiana University Press. pp. 1, 5–6, 176–180. ISBN 9780253334718 < /ref > < ref > United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 1989. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. < /ref >  The fundamental reason has to do with [[genetics]]. Incestual societies will have a high rate of [[birth defect]]s, significant enough for it to be noticed even when little was known about the cause. To some extent this is a surmise, because ancient societies had no knowledge of genetics as such. But they must have noticed some connection between birth defects and the relationship between parents. We think this because widespread bans on closely related persons marrying came long before the understanding of modern genetics. 
 
 In history (as far as we know it) there were societies which allowed incestual marriages and individual acts of incest. Famously, the [[ancient Egyptian]] royal family practised incest, though not exclusively. It is thought that the frequency of early non-trauma deaths (such as [[Tutankhamun]]) was due to the effect of incest. We do know that incest was practised in their royal family. [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] was married to her brothers, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV. Roman records show that marriages between close siblings were common in Ancient Egypt. < ref name= " Shaw 1992 " > Brent D. Shaw: ''Explaining Incest: Brother-Sister Marriage in Graeco-Roman Egypt.''

 So, if pregnancy is a risk, there is a reason based on health. Children that result from incest between blood relatives are more likely to have [[birth defect]]s. 
 
 == Terminology and scope == 
 The exact definition of the incest relationship varies. In some societies it is immediate relations, such as parents and their children; or brothers and sisters of the same parents. It sometimes includes extended family like aunts, nephews, nieces and uncles. That way, intercourse between [[cousin]]s is legally permitted in the large majority of the world, but is disliked in many countries. In some U.S. states, such as [[Texas]], the legal definition of incest includes first cousins, but not second cousins. A person who engages in incest may be called an ''incestophile'' or ''incestualist''. 
 
 Other societies define it much more widely, to include all  " blood relatives " , or all who live in the same [[household]], or belong to the same [[clan]]. < ref > Claude Lévi-Strauss. ''Elementary structures Of kinship''. (tr. 1971) < /ref >  Some religions say that sex between people related by marriage is incest. For example, the [[Old Testament]] forbids sex between siblings-in-law. In [[South Africa]], sex between a parent-in-law and child-in-law is illegal. 
 
 == Types == 
 There are different types of incest: 
 * ''Between an adult family member, and a child.'' This is usually a form of [[child sexual abuse]]. < ref name= " Wolf170 " > {{cite book|title=Inbreeding, incest, and the incest taboo: the state of knowledge at the turn of the century|last=Wolf|first=Arthur P.|author2=William H. Durham|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8047-5141-2|pages=170–172}} < /ref >  It often involves a form of threat, or the adult abuses his or her position of power. The most commonly-reported form in the Western world is father-daughter incest. < ref name= " Herman " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fatherdaughterin00herm_0|title=Father-daughter incest|last=Herman|first=Judith|date=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-29506-4|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/fatherdaughterin00herm_0/page/282 282]}} < /ref >  This form has been shown to cause one of the worst forms of childhood [[trauma]], a trauma that often causes serious and long-term psychological damage, especially in the case of parental incest. < ref name= " Courtois " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/healingincestwou00cour|title=Healing the incest wound: adult survivors in therapy|last=Courtois|first=Christine A.|publisher=Norton|year=1988|isbn=0-393-31356-5|pages=208}} < /ref >  Stepparents are more likely to abuse stepchildren than biological parents are to abuse their children, < ref > [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3427237 59 incestuous stepfathers] < /ref >  because people typically care about their own children more than they care about their stepchildren {{ndash}} the [[Cinderella effect]]. < ref > [http://www.examiner.com/article/the-cinderella-effect The Cinderella Effect] < /ref >  It is suggested that the [[Westermarck effect]] prevents a person being attracted to anyone whom he lived in the same house as during his childhood. For this reason, most people are never sexually attracted to their [[sibling]]s or parents. < ref > The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction.

 * ''Between children who are related.'' It is thought, that incest between siblings is widespread, but that it is rarely reported. < ref name= " Turner2 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000turn/page/92|title=Encyclopedia of Relationships Across the Lifespan|last=Turner|first=Jeffrey S.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1996|isbn=978-0-313-29576-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000turn/page/92 92]}} < /ref >  If one sibling forces the other, or there is no [[Age of consent|consent]], this is likely the same case as sexual abuse of children. 
 * ''Between [[Age of consent|consenting]] adults.''Incest between consenting adults is very rare, or rarely reported. < ref name= " Wolf170 "  / >  Willing incest between adults is a crime in most countries. It is seen by some as a [[victimless crime]]. < ref name= " spiegel " > {{cite magazine|author=Hipp, Dietmar|date=2008-03-11|title=German High Court takes a look at incest|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540831,00.html|magazine=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2008-04-12}} < /ref >  A reason why it is prohibited is because severely handicapped children are often born to parents who are blood-related. Other reasons for it being illegal are religion and to try to prevent sexual predation. 
 
 The term is often used to apply to less serious sexual relationships between related people. It is difficult to say how frequent incest is, but researchers have estimated that between 10% and 15% of people have at least one  " incest experience "  (this means some kind of sexual relationship falling short of actual incest). Less than 2% of these involve [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] or attempted intercourse. < ref > {{cite book |author=Nemeroff, Charles B.; Craighead, W.

In the same study, 2.5% (1 in 40) of the women said that they had been sexually abused by their father. < ref > [http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0145213484900450 Prevalence and seriousness of incestuous abuse] < /ref > 
 
 == Summary == 
 Most societies have some form of incest avoidance. < ref > Brown, Donald E., ''Human Universals''.

 The incest [[taboo]] is and has been one of the most common of all cultural taboos, both in current nations and many past societies, < ref > ''Incest: the nature and origin of the taboo,'' by Emile Durkheim (tr.1963) < /ref >  with legal penalties imposed in some jurisdictions. Most modern societies have legal or social restrictions on closely consanguineous marriages. < ref > ''Kinship, incest, and the dictates of law,'' by Henry A. Kelly, 14 Am. J. Juris. 69 < /ref >  However, in some societies, such as that of [[Ancient Egypt]], brother–sister, father–daughter, and mother–son relations were practiced among royalty. < ref > Maurice Godelier, Métamorphoses de la parenté, 2004 < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2592 |title=New Left Review – Jack Goody: The Labyrinth of Kinship |accessdate=2007-07-24}} < /ref > 
 
 == Inbreeding == 
 Many royal houses have suffered inbreeding. This is caused in most cases by apparently natural marriages between persons who are actually closely related. Cases have appeared which are explained, and sometimes even proved, as being dues to [[inbreeding]]. The classic examples are the European royal houses (see [[Hapsburg]]) and the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s.
