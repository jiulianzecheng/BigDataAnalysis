 :''See also [[Street (town)]]'' 
 A '''street''' is a piece of land, made flat and often with [[pavement]], so that people can travel on it better.  " Street "  and  " [[road]] "  may mean the same thing, but  " street "  is more often used only in a town. 
 
 Many streets are the center of local culture or of a specialized activity. [[New Orleans]]’ [[Bourbon Street]], for example, is famous for its active nightlife and also for its role as the center of the city’s [[French Quarter]]. The [[Bowery]] in [[Manhattan]] was, at different times, a main highway, a center of underground [[punk]] culture, and a specialized shopping district for light fixtures.
