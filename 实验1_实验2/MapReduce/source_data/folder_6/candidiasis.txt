 '''Candidiasis''', often called '''yeast infection''' or '''thrush''', is a type of [[infection|infectious]] [[disease]]. It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is caused by any of the ''Candida'' [[species]] of [[yeast]]. ''[[Candida albicans]]'' is the most common species. < ref name= " Baron " > {{Citation|last1=Walsh|first1=Thomas J.|title=Spectrum of Mycoses|date=1996|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7902/|work=Medical Microbiology|editor-last=Baron|editor-first=Samuel|edition=4th|place=Galveston (TX)|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston|isbn=978-0-9631172-1-2|pmid=21413276|access-date=2022-04-12|last2=Dixon|first2=Dennis M.}} < /ref > < ref name= " Medline Plus " > {{Cite web|title=Medline Plus at the U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=http://www.candida-society.org/ncs/digestv1i3.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uDTpHGPW?url=http://www.candida-society.org/ncs/digestv1i3.htm|archive-date=2010-11-13|access-date=2007-10-29}} < /ref > 
 
 == Causes == 
 ''Candida'' yeasts are common in most people. The yeast is usually controlled in the body.  When the yeast grows without control, an [[infection]] happens. 
 
 A weakened, unhealthy, or young [[immune system]] may allow candidiasis to develop. < ref name= " Odds " > {{cite journal|author=Odds FC|year= 1987|title=Candida infections: an overview|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol.|volume=15|issue= 1|pages=1–5|doi= 10.3109/10408418709104444|pmid= 3319417}} < /ref >   [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[cancer]] treatments, [[steroids]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and not enough [[nutrients]] may cause candidiasis. 
 
 [[Antibiotic]] and [[steroid]] use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.candida-society.org/ncs/digestv1i3.htm |title=National Candida Society Article |access-date=2007-10-29 |archive-date=2010-11-13 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uDTpHGPW?url=http://www.candida-society.org/ncs/digestv1i3.htm |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref >  [[Antibiotic]] kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply. 
 
 == Candidiasis in the throat and mouth == 
 === Throat === 
 Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the [[esophagus]] by ''[[Candida albicans]]''. The disease happens in unhealthy people.  Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with [[chemotherapy]]. People with [[AIDS]] can also get this infection more often. 
 
 One sign of esophageal candidiasis is [[pain]]ful swallowing. Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time. 
 
 === Mouth === 
 '''Oral candidiasis''' is a [[yeast]] infection of the mouth. < ref > {{Citation 
 | title = Medline Plus 
 | url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000626.htm 
 }} < /ref >   It is located on the [[mucous]] [[membranes]] of the [[mouth]]. It is caused by ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''Candida glabrata'' or ''Candida tropicalis''. 
 
 === Signs === 
 Candida may appear as thick white or cream-coloured areas on mucosal membranes. The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed. In babies the condition is called thrush. For babies, it is usually painless and causes no [[pain]]. Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation. 
 
 == Body parts == 
 In healthy persons, candidiasis is usually a very small infection of the [[skin]] or mucous membranes. < ref name=Baron/ >  These areas include: 
 * the [[mouth]] (oral candidiasis) 
 * the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]] (vaginal candidiasis or thrush) 
 * folds of skin in the [[diaper]] area ([[diaper rash]]) 
 * the [[nipple]]s while [[breastfeeding]] 
 * the [[penis]] or [[foreskin]] < ref name= " Wong2008 " > {{Citation

 Candidiasis is a very common cause of [[vagina]]l irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the [[penis]] or [[scrotum]]. In unhealthy [[patient]]s, the ''Candida'' infection can affect the [[esophageal candidiasis|esophagus]]. It could get everywhere in the body. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a state called [[candidemia]]. < ref name= " Pappas " > {{cite journal|author=Pappas PG|year= 2007|title=Invasive candidiasis|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_infectious-disease-clinics-of-north-america_2007-06_21_2/page/485|journal=Infect Dis Clin North Am.|volume=20|issue= 3|pages=485–506|doi= 10.1016/j.idc.2006.07.004|pmid= 16984866}} < /ref >
