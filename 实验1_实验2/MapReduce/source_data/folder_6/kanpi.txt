 '''Kaṉpi''' (sometimes spelled '''Kanypi''') is an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] community in the [[Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara|Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands]] in [[South Australia]]. It is located about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} south of the [[Northern Territory]] border at the base of the [[Mann Ranges]]. The nearby town of [[Nyapaṟi, South Australia|Nyapaṟi]] is {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} to the east. 
 
 Kaṉpi is part of the Murputja Homelands, which also includes the family [[Outstation movement|outstations]] Angatja and Umpukulu. The residents are mostly [[Pitjantjatjara]] people with their [[Homeland|traditional country]] nearby. The settlement started as an outstation for the [[Jimmy Baker < !--link to original patriarch-- > |Baker family]], who moved here from other parts on the APY lands to be closer to the country of their [[ancestor]]s. 
 
 Because both Kaṉpi and nearby Nyapaṟi are small communities, there are only basic services and most of them are shared between the two towns. In Kaṉpi there is a work shop, a garage, a day care centre and an art centre. It also has a community store, built in 1996, which has a pump for [[petrol]]. Food and supplies are delivered once every two weeks. The store services both Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi, as well as nearby outstations. Local health services are based at the clinic in Nyapaṟi. < ref > {{cite web|title=Kanpi|url=http://www.waru.org/communities/kanpi/|work=Waru|publisher=PY Media|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=14 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014075920/http://waru.org/communities/kanpi/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Both Kaṉpi and Nyapaṟi had their own schools from 1987, but these joined together in 1993. The new school, Murputja Education Centre, was built between the two communities, {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} east of Kaṉpi and 6 & nbsp;km west of Nyapaṟi. < ref > {{cite web|title=Murputja School|url=http://www.waru.org/communities/murputja/|work=Waru|publisher=PY Media|accessdate=28 October 2012|archive-date=14 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014075916/http://waru.org/communities/murputja/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
