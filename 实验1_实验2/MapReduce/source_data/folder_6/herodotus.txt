 '''Herodotus''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ᵻ|ˈ|r|ɒ|d|ə|t|ə|s}} {{respell|hirr|OD|ə|təs}}; {{lang-grc|Ἡρόδοτος|Hēródotos}}, {{IPA-el|hɛːródotos|att-pron}}; {{circa|484|425}} {{sc|BC}}) was an [[Ancient Greek]] [[historian]]. < ref name=wb > {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=World Book Encyclopedia|title=Herodotus|date=1978|volume=9|page=199|publisher=World Book-Childcraft International|author=Welles, C. Bradford}} < /ref >  He was born in [[Halicarnassus]], a town in south-west [[Asia Minor]] (now [[Bodrum]], [[Turkey]]) 
 
 Herodotus was called the  " Father of History "  by [[Cicero]]. < ref name=wb / > < ref name=tfh > {{cite book|editor1=G. S. Farnell|editor2=M. Goff|title=Tales from Herodotus|publisher=Bristol Classic Press|date=1992|edition=2nd |page=x|isbn=978-0-86292-091-3}} < /ref >  He wrote about the ancient empires of [[Babylon]], [[Egypt]], and [[Persia]], and about the Ancient Greeks. 
 
 During his life, Herodotus probably told his stories in front of large numbers of people in Greek cities. Some men at the time did this for pay. He is now most famous for his writings about the wars between the [[Persian Empire]] and the Greek [[city-state]]s. He told the story from the Greek side, although the war was mostly finished when he was still a child. 
 
 In his books, Herodotus tells us that he travelled a lot. He says that he went to what is now [[Italy]] (including [[Sicily]]), [[Ukraine]], [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]]. He may also have travelled to [[Babylon]] in today's [[Iraq]]. He often used stories from people he met to write about other places and happenings. 
 
 Some people think that Herodotus wrote about things that were not true. That is possible, because he would have relied on information from various sources. His [[Histories (Herodotus)|work]] is important because there is very little writing on these subjects before his works. 
 
 The works of Herodotus are available today in translations.
