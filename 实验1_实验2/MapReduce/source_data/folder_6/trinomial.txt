'''Trinomials''' are [[Polynomial|polynomials]] that contain three parts called [[Term (mathematics)|terms]], which are separated by plus and minus symbols. Here is a visual example of a trinomial: 
 
 < math > ax+by+c < /math > 
 
 This is a linear expression, a component that makes up [[Linear equation|linear equations]]. 
 
 == Examples == 
 
 *  < math > ax^2+bx+c < /math > , a [[Quadratic equation|quadratic expression]] in its standard (normal) form, which happens to be a trinomial. 
 * Perfect square trinomials,  < math > a^2 \pm 2ab + b^2 < /math > .
