 '''Mutiny''' is a when a group of people get together to openly oppose, change, or remove the people or person in authority. It usually means a group of [[soldier]]s trying to remove their [[officer]]s, or a group of [[sailor]]s on a [[ship]] trying to remove the [[captain]]. The group of people that mutiny are called mutineers. 
 
 During the [[Age of Discovery]], mutiny meant open [[rebellion]] against a ship’s [[captain]]. This happened during [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan’s]] journey and one mutineer was killed. Another mutineer was [[Capital punishment|executed]] and 2 others were put on land and left there. After a mutiny on [[Henry Hudson]]’s ''Discovery'', Hudson and several others were left in the ocean in a small boat. 
 
 ==Penalty== 
 Mutiny is still treated as a very bad crime. Mutineers are [[punishment|punished]] and may even get the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].
