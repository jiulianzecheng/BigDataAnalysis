 '''Catbells''' is a [[fell]] in the [[England|English]] [[Lake District]] in the [[List of counties of the United Kingdom|county]] of [[Cumbria]]. It has a modest height of {{convert|451|m|ft|0}}. < ref > Rick Steves, ''Rick Steves' Great Britain'' (Pgw, 2014), p. 550 < /ref >  It is one of the most popular fells in the area. It is on the [[west|western]] [[shore]] of [[Derwent Water]] within {{convert|3|mi|0}} of the busy tourist town of [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]]. < ref > Mountford John Byrde Baddeley, ''The English Lake District'' (London: Dulau  &  Co., 1902), p. 242 < /ref >  Its distinctive shape catches the attention of many visitors to the Lakes who like to climb to the top. There is a view of this mountain from Friars Crag on the opposite side of Derwent Water. The fell's unusual name may have come from a distortion of  " Cat Bields "  meaning shelter of the [[wildcat]]. But this is not certain. The fell's name is sometimes written as  " Cat Bells " .
