 A '''mirror''' or '''looking-glass''' is something that reflects [[light]]. One common ''plane mirror'' is a piece of special flat [[glass]] that a person can look into to see a [[reflection]] of themselves or what is behind them.

 Sometimes, a flat piece of [[metal]] or the [[surface]] of [[water]] can act like a mirror. 
 
 You can see yourself in a mirror because light comes in and is [[Reflection|reflected]].  
 
 Curved mirrors can have magnification properties, making images appear smaller or larger than their actual size, like a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] does..  They can be concave (curved inward) or convex (curved outward), making the reflected angle and view to be smaller or larger, respectively.  Special mirrors can make a person's appearance look quite strange.  
 
 Also, in a mirror, writing appears backwards, as a  " mirror image "  of the original writing. 
 
 Mirrors are usually made out of glass with metal on the back, called  " silvering "  even if the metal is not [[silver]]. Modern mirrors use aluminum. The aluminum is applied via vacuum, and will bond directly to cooled glass.
