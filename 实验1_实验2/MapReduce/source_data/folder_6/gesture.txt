 A '''gesture''' is a form of [[nonverbal communication]]. Unlike verbal communication, which uses words, gestures use movements of the body.  
 
 Gestures are ''deliberate acts with a [[wikt:purpose|purpose]]'', not just any movements. They are handled in the human [[brain]] by the same centres which handle language. In the [[neocortex]], [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s, are used by [[speech]] and [[sign language]]. < ref name= " Xu " > Xu J, ''et al'' 2009. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779203/pdf/pnas.0909197106.pdf Symbolic gestures and spoken language are processed by a common neural system.] Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.

 Other movements of the body have [[wikt:meaning|meaning]], but are not gestures. They may be done by actors deliberately, but normally they are automatic, unconscious signals which express various feelings or states of mind. < ref > Darwin, Charles 1872. ''The expression of the emotions in man and animals''. London: John Murray. < /ref >  Many animals communicate extensively using such behaviours. The [[dog]], a companion to humans for a long time, is good at reading both gestures and behaviours. [[Multi-touch]] computers have been made to read gestures.  
 
 Gestures have a [[culture|cultural]] significance (meaning). The same gesture can mean different things in different cultures and different parts of the world. 
 
 == Examples == 
 * [[High five]] – a greeting or sign of happiness 
 * [[Facepalm]] – showing frustration 
 * [[Sign of the cross]] – religious gesture 
 * [[V sign]] – victory or peace sign 
 
 == Anti-examples == 
 These are not gestures, because they are not voluntary, deliberate actions. They are inherited automatic reactions or reflexes. 
 *Screaming out in great [[pain]] or [[terror]]. 
 *Baring our teeth in anger 
 *Cowering, turning the face away and running in terror. 
 *Many behaviours of babies, such as suckling on nipples. 
 Humans can modify these reactions to some extent with training and practice, but they are fundamentally caused by [[hormone]]s and brain centres which are very ancient.
