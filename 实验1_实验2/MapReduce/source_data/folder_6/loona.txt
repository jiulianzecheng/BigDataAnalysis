 '''Loona''' (written as '''LOOΠΔ''', {{ko-hhrm|이달의 소녀|Idarui Sonyeo}}; {{literal translation| " Girl of the Month " }}) is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed by [[Blockberry Creative]]. The group was first shown to the public through a project which began in October 2016, where each of the twelve members were revealed one after another by releasing a single over the next eighteen months. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://star.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/OhmyStar/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0002260168|title='이달의 소녀' 앞으로 기대되는 이유|publisher=Oh My Star|language=ko|date=November 13, 2016}} < /ref >  The members formed three sub-units: '''[[Loona 1/3]]''', '''Loona Odd Eye Circle''' and '''Loona [[yyxy]]'''. They started as a full group with the extended play, ''[[+ + (EP)|[+ +]]]'' (2018), supported by the lead single  " [[Favorite (Loona song)|favOriTe]] "  and the title track  " [[Hi High]]. " 
 
 ==Name== 
 Loona's English name came from the Hangul letters ㅇㄷㅇㅅㄴ, each an [[Hangul#Letter placement within a block|initial consonant]] in the [[Syllable|syllabic]] blocks that make {{lang|ko|이달의 소녀}} (''Idarui Sonyeo''). When changed to ㄴㅇㅇㄷㅅ, it looks like LOONA in the Latin alphabet. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://studio-xxx.com/LOONA-The-Debut-Project|title=LOONA: The Debut Project|last=Lee|first=Jiyoon|website=Studio XXX|language=en|access-date=August 27, 2018}} < /ref >
