 '''Gin''' is a type of [[alcohol]]ic drink with a high amount of alcohol in it, usually about 35-50% alcohol by volume. It was invented in the [[Netherlands]] in the 17th century, and soon became very popular in England. This became a problem when many people drank themselves to death, because gin was cheap to make and contained so much alcohol. 
 
 Gin is flavored with [[juniper]] berries. Today, gin is usually a dry liquor, which means that it is not very sweet. Gin is also very popular in [[cocktail]]s - two of the most common of these are the Gin  &  Tonic (gin mixed with tonic water) and the martini (gin mixed with [[vermouth]], usually with an [[Olive (fruit)|olive]] added). Gin is still one of the most popular liquors to this day.
