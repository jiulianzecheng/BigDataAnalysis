 '''Bishop''' is a type of [[clergy]] in some [[Christian church|Christian churches]]. The bishop is the leader of the [[Christians]] and the Christian [[priests]] in each [[diocese]]. The diocese which a bishop governs is called a '''bishopric'''. '''Episcopal''' is the [[adjective]] for bishops. A [[cathedral]] is the [[church (building)|church building]] where the bishop has an episcopal [[throne]]. The cathedral is the main church of the diocese and the bishop's [[See (church)|see]]. A bishop may be given the rank of [[archbishop]] in an [[archdiocese]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/hierarchy/bishops.asp |title=Bishops |author= |website= |publisher=Catholic-Pages.com |accessdate=18 June 2015 |archive-date=26 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180104/http://www.catholic-pages.com/hierarchy/bishops.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 Christian [[priest]]s in some [[Christian denomination|denominations]] must be made priests by bishops. In these denominations, bishops are above [[parish]] priests in the [[hierarchy]] of the church's organization. However, some [[Protestant]] denominations have no bishops or archbishops. The [[Presbyterianism]] is an example. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.opc.org/qa.html?question_id=274 |title=Question and Answer OPC Church Government |author= |website= |publisher=The Orthodox Presbyterian Church |accessdate=18 June 2015}} < /ref >  The leader of the [[Church of Scotland]] is the Moderator.

 In the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] church, the [[Pope]] is chosen by all the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] from amongst their number. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/about/leadership/holy-see/francis/how-is-a-new-pope-chosen.cfm |title=How Is A New Pope Chosen? |author= |website= |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |accessdate=18 June 2015}} < /ref >  According to church law, this does not have to be the case: any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was [[Urban VI]] (elected in 1378). 
 
 The pope is also 'the Bishop of [[Rome]]'.  In fact he rules an [[independent]] state within Rome, called the [[Vatican]].  All Roman Catholic bishops answer to the pope (or to [[patriarch]]s in some [[Eastern Orthodoxy|orthodox]] churches).  In the [[Anglican]] church, bishops are governed by [[Archbishop]]s. 
 
 Usually a bishop can be identified by a special [[hat]], called a [[mitre]].
