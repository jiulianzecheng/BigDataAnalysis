 '''''Tanycolagreus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[coelurosaur]] [[theropod]] from the [[Upper Jurassic]] of [[North America]].

 The fossil [[holotype]]  was donated to science by an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] benefactor. It is part of the collection of Thanksgiving Point Institute, and displayed in the North American Museum of Ancient Life at Lehi, [[Utah]]. It includes an incomplete skull and mandible (lower jaws) and much of the postcranial skeleton, i.e. the parts behind the head. The size of this specimen suggests a size in life of about 3.3 meters (11 feet) long. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 The fossil was found in the [[Morrison Formation]], where originally there was a great variety of life. This environment  a [[savannah]] with many rivers. Along the rivers were [[conifer]] forests, with  [[ginkgo]]s, [[cycad]]s, [[tree fern]]s, and [[horsetail]]s rushes.  
 
 [[Insect]]s were very similar to modern [[species]], with [[termite]]s building 30 & nbsp;m (100 & nbsp;ft.) tall nests. Along the rivers, there were [[fish]], [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[crayfish]], [[clam]]s, and [[monotreme]]s ([[prototheria]]n [[mammal]]s, the largest of which was about the size of a [[rat]]). The [[dinosaur]]s were most likely along the rivers as well. Hundreds of dinosaur fossils have been discovered. 
 
 According to [[radiometric dating]], the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3 & nbsp;± & nbsp;2 & nbsp;million years old (mya) at its base, < ref name= " TCR06 " > {{cite journal|last1=Trujillo K.C|last2=Chamberlain K.R.|last3=Strickland A.|title=Oxfordian U/Pb ages from SHRIMP analysis for the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of southeastern Wyoming with implications for biostratigraphic correlations|journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=38|issue=6|pages=7}} < /ref >  to 146.8 & nbsp;± & nbsp;1 & nbsp;mya at the top, < ref name= " SAB98 " > {{cite book|title=The Morrison Formation: an interdisciplinary study|last=Bilbey S.A. 1998|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group|editor=Carpenter K|series=Modern Geology '''22'''|pages=87–120|chapter=Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry: age, stratigraphy and depositional environments|issn=0026-7775|editor-last2=Chure D.|editor-last3=Kirkland J.I.}} < /ref >  so it lasted just under 10 million years.

 Carpenter and his co-workers said that this genus most closely resembles ''[[Coelurus]]'', though it has some more  " [[primitive]] "  features. < ref >  Carpenter K; Miles C. and Cloward K. 2005.
