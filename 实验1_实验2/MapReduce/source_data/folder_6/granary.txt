 A '''granary''' is a [[building]] or room (usually in a [[barn]]) that holds grain.  It keeps the grain dry so it does not spoil, and keeps it away from animals that would eat it.  They are an important part of a farm.  If the grain is lost, eaten by pests, or ruined, the farmers might starve or lose much money. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Granaries have been around as long as humans have had [[agriculture]] and in some cases even before we planted crops.  The earliest ones are over 11,000 years old and stored grains that grew in the wild and were collected by hand. < ref > {{cite web|title=Evidence for food storage in Jordan valley|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10966.long|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=14 September 2013|archive-date=23 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923135716/https://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10966.long|url-status=dead}} < /ref >    
 
 == Structure == 
 
 Granaries usually have few, if any, windows.  They are often built off the ground, to keep out water and mice. They will have a door near the bottom to get the grain out, and usually have an opening up high to put the grain in.  < ref > {{cite web|title=Outbuilding types|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/outbuildings/21198/granary/1272662|publisher=State of Pennsylvania|accessdate=14 September 2013|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010236/http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/outbuildings/21198/granary/1272662|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
