 '''Dietzenbach''' is a city in the [[Offenbach Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. The town is also the capital of the Offenbach Rural District (''Landkreis Offenbach'') 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Dietzenbach is in the ''[[Rhine-Main area]]'' {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} southeast of [[Frankfurt]]. The whole area of the town is {{convert|21.67|km2|abbr=off}} large and it is {{convert|135|m|abbr=off}} above sea level. < ref > [http://www.dietzenbach.de/ Homepage of the city of Dietzenbach], looked up on 17 January 2010, German. < /ref >  It is a plain area with nearly no hills. 
 
 About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of [[tertiary]] the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]]s sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor. 
 
 The city consists out of the urban districts ''Neue Stadtmitte'', ''Spessartviertel'', ''Altstadt'', ''Steinberg'', ''Hexenberg'' and ''Wingertsberg''. 
 
 The neighbours of Dietzenbach are:  
 * [[Heusenstamm]] (north) 
 * [[Rodgau]] (east) 
 * [[Rödermark]] (south) 
 * [[Dreieich]] (west) 
 
 Dietzenbach has 33,067 [[inhabitant]]s (2008). < ref > [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html Official statistics of the state of Hesse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173109/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html |date=2016-05-13 }}, looked up on 17 January 2010, German. < /ref >  About 30% of the people living here are from foreign countries. They come from many different nations. 
 
 The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 Some local people are speaking a regional type ([[dialect]]) of the German [[language]] with a certain tone and special words. It is a [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] (German: ''Hessisch'') and is spoken in the south of Hesse. This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a [[minority]] and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain [[pronunciation]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In the 13th century the name of Dietzenbach was written down in a document for the first time. 
 
 Formerly the people in the Dietzenbach area were mostly [[farmer]]s and [[craft]]smen but not [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. With the [[industrial revolution]] the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for [[metal]] working, [[leather]] [[manufacturing]] and chemical processing. Many men became [[work]]men and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
