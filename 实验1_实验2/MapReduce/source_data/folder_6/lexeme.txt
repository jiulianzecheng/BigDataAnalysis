'''Lexeme''' is a term in [[linguistics]]. They are units of [[meaning]], independent of any [[inflection]]al endings, or whether it is one [[word]] or several.  " Come in "  is a lexeme; so is  " raining cats and dogs " . The largest English [[dictionary|dictionaries]] have about half a million lexemes.  " The true figure is undoubtedly a great deal higher " . < ref > Crystal, David (1995). ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''. Cambridge. p. 119. < /ref >   
 
 In the English language, ''run'', ''runs'', ''ran'' and ''running'' are forms of the same lexeme, conventionally written as  < span style= " font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase " > RUN < /span > . 
 
 A similar concept is the [[lemma (linguistics)|lemma]] (or citation form). It is the form of a lexeme which is chosen to represent the lexeme, for example,  < span style= " font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase " > RUN < /span >  instead of the other forms. Lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords. Other forms of a lexeme are usually listed later in the entry. So all headwords in a dictionary are lexemes. 
 
 A ''lexicon'' is made of lexemes.
