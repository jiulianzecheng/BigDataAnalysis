The existence of a [[Roma people]] (Romniti)-inhabited land called Gyppe ('''Little Egypt''') near the town of Modon in the [[Peloponnese]] in 1384, once a port of transit for pilgrims en route to the holy sites, in the [[Middle Ages]] is the origin of the name Gypsy. It is not known as to why people from Indian [[Punjab]] moved to the [[Balkans]], there are many  theories of speculative nature. One of the theories is that the people of Indian origins settled in [[Egypt]], then resettle to the Peloponnese, Greece. They have been colloquially known as »Gypsies«. < ref > [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305298773_Roma_Culture_Problems_and_Challenges Roma Culture: Problems and Challenges] < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291178 | jstor=1291178 | title=The Gypsies in the Byzantine Empire and the Balkans in the Late Middle Ages | last1=Soulis | first1=George C. | journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers | year=1961 | volume=15 | pages=141–165 | doi=10.2307/1291178 }} < /ref >
