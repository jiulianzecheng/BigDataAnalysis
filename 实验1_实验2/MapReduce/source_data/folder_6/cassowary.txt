 '''Cassowaries ''' (''Casuarius'') are a kind of large bird which cannot fly. They are in a group of [[flightless birds]] called the [[ratite]]s. The [[ostrich]], [[emu]], [[moa]] (now [[extinct]]) and small [[kiwi]] are other ratites. 
 
 The cassowary lives in the [[tropical]] [[rainforest]]s of [[New Guinea]] and north eastern [[Australia]]. They are shy birds living deep in the forest. They may become aggressive, and they may attack people. This makes it hard to learn about them. < ref name=wt > {{cite web |url=http://www.wettropics.gov.au/pa/pa_casso.html |title=The Cassowary |accessdate=2009-01-18 |format=html |work=Plants and animals in the wet tropics |archive-date=2008-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223072427/http://www.wettropics.gov.au/pa/pa_casso.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 A group of cassowaries is called a  " shock " . 
 
 == Species of cassowary == 
 There are three living [[species]] of cassowary: 
 * [[Southern cassowary]], ''Casuarius casuarius'', which lives in [[Australia]] , [[Maluku Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] 
 * Northern cassowary, ''Casuarius unappendiculatus'', which lives in New Guinea and [[New Britain]]. This is also called the Single-wattled cassowary, (Golden)-(necked) cassowary or Blyth's cassowary. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Casuarius_unappendiculatus |title=AnAge entry for Casuarius unappendiculatus |accessdate=2009-02-05 |work=AnAge }} < /ref > 
 * Dwarf cassowary, ''Casuarius bennetti'', which lives in New Guinea. It weighs up to {{convert|25|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} and can grow to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} tall. It is also called Bennett's cassowary, Mountain cassowary or Mooruk. 
 
 ==Description== 
 The southern cassowary is the largest forest bird in the world, < ref name=ng/ >  and the second heaviest bird in the world after the ostrich. It is third tallest after the ostrich and emu. < ref name= " www.buzzle.com "   / >  Females are bigger and more brightly coloured. Adult southern cassowaries are between {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} tall. Some females may get as big as {{convert|2|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, and weigh about {{convert|70|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " www.buzzle.com " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/7-18-2006-102736.asp |title=The Cassowary Bird |access-date=2008-07-23 |archive-date=2009-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315223855/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/7-18-2006-102736.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They do not have feathers on their necks. The necks are brightly colored in [[red]], [[blue]], [[purple]] and [[yellow]]. < ref name=sonoma/ >  The southern cassowary has two wattles, loose [[skin]], which hangs down from their neck. The northern cassowary has one wattle. The dwarf cassowary has no wattles. 
 
 Cassowaries have three [[toe]]s on each foot. Each has a sharp [[claw]]. The middle toe has a claw like a [[Knife|dagger]], which is {{convert|120|mm|in|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} long. Because a cassowary can kick, this claw is very dangerous and can hurt or kill enemies.  Scientists believe they can run up to {{convert|50|km/h|mph|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{Cite web

 ==Breeding== 
 [[Image:Casuarius casuarius, egg.JPG|thumb|220px|A cassowary egg.]] 
 [[Image:Casuarius casuarius -Emmagen Creek, Queensland, Australia -chick-8.jpg|thumb|220px|Cassowary chick]] 
 
 Females lay between three and eight large, pale green-blue eggs at a time. These large eggs are about {{convert|90|mm|in|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} by {{convert|140|mm|in|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} and weigh about 600 [[gram]]s. [[Ostrich]] and [[emu]] eggs are bigger. The male sits on the eggs for two months until they hatch. He then looks after the brown-striped chicks for nine months. The female mates with two or three males each year. A cassowary at the [[Healesville Sanctuary]] lived for 61 years. < ref name=sonoma/ > 
 
 ==The casque== 
 All three types of cassowary have a horn-like helmet called a ''casque'' < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/casque |title= casque|accessdate=2009-02-04 |work=The Free Dictionary}} < /ref >  on the top of their head. The casque is a [[keratin]]ous skin (like a finger nail) over an inside made of firm, but foam like material. < ref name= " Crome " > Crome, F., and L. Moore. 1988. The cassowary’s casque. ''Emu'' 88:123–124.[http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file & file_id=MU9880123.pdf] < /ref >  This material can be bent and squeezed but it goes back to its proper shape. < ref name= " Crome " / >  The name ''cassowary'' comes from two [[Papua]]n words meaning  " horned head " . < ref name=sonoma / >  The reason for the casque is unknown. There are a number of different ideas, such as: 
 * It may have a [[Sexual reproduction|sexual purpose]] as the females casque is larger < ref name= " Crome " / > 
 * It might be used to push through the thick forest, 
 * It might be a weapon for fighting other cassowaries 
 * It might be an extension of the hearing instruments capable of picking up specific lower vibrations that Cassowaries make when they boom in the dense forest, making long distance communication possible despite thick bush. 
 * It might keep the cassowary's [[skull]] safe if they crash into trees. < ref name= " Crome " / > 
 
 [[Biologist]] Andrew Mack has watched cassowaries and disagreed with many of these ideas. < ref name= " Crome " / > < ref name= " Mack " > * Mack AL, Jones J. 2003. Low-frequency vocalizations by cassowaries (Casuarius spp.). ''The Auk'' 120(4):1062–1068 [http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document & issn=0004-8038 & volume=120 & issue=04 & page=1062] < /ref >  He thinks that the casques play a part in the way cassowaries hear sounds or the way that they make sounds. He discovered that the dwarf Cassowary and southern cassowary make a very low sound. It is the lowest known bird call, like a  " boom " , which people can only just hear. < ref name=ng > {{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1104_031104_cassowary.html |title=Does rain forest bird  " boom "  Like a inosaur? |accessdate=2008-12-29 |work= National Geographic News}} < /ref >  The southern cassowary sound was measured at 32 [[hertz]], and the dwarf cassowary was even lower at only 23 hertz. < ref name=ng/ >  The birds live by themselves, they do not live in groups so the  " booming sound "  might be a way for the birds to communicate (talk) over a long distance in thick rainforest. < ref name= " Mack " / >  Some scientists think that this may be how [[dinosaur]]s communicated with each other. < ref name=ng/ > 
 
 ==Diet== 
 [[File:Kasuar fg1.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Cassowary scat ([[feces]]) showing all the seeds]] 
 Their main food is fruit, but they eat other things such as [[snail]]s, [[fungi]], [[fern]]s and [[flower]]s. They are important because they spread plant and fruit seeds through the forest. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.daintreerainforest.com/fauna.html |title=Cassowary |accessdate=2008-07-24 |format=html |work=Fauna of the Daintree Rainforest |archive-date=2008-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054445/http://www.daintreerainforest.com/fauna.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Each cassowary is known to live in an area of up to {{convert|700|ha|acre|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, so they carry seeds a long way. At least 70 rainforest trees need the cassowary to spread their seeds. Their seeds are too big for other rainforest animals to carry. < ref name=wt/ >  Seeds from 21 plants have to be eaten and pass through the cassowary or they will not grow. < ref name=sonoma > {{cite web|url= http://www.cassowary.com/workshop.html|title= Cassowary Husbandry|accessdate= 2008-07-24|format= html|work= Sonoma Bird Farm|archive-date= 2008-09-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915055701/http://www.cassowary.com/workshop.html|url-status= dead}} < /ref >  Some seeds are [[poison]]ous to all other animals; only the cassowary can eat them. < ref name=wt/ >  Scientists have worked out that about 150 rainforest plants need the cassowary. < ref name=wt/ > 
 
 == Endangered species == 
 The southern cassowary is now listed as [[Endangered species|endangered]] in Australia. < ref name=sonoma / >  The CSIRO states that approximately 4,400 cassowaries live in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.  < ref > {{Cite web|last=Authority|first=Wet Tropics Management|title=Cassowary numbers are in|url=https://www.wettropics.gov.au/cassowary-numbers-are-in.html|access-date=2021-01-13|website=Wet Tropics Management Authority}} < /ref >  Many of the forest places that they like to live in have been cleared for farming and other development.

 The northern cassowary in New Guinea is listed as vulnerable. They could easily become an endangered animal unless things are done to protect them. Scientists do not know how many birds there are, but they think there may be anywhere from 2,500 to 9,999 northern cassowaries left. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp & sid=6 |title=Northern cassowary birdlife data fact sheet |accessdate=2009-01-19 |work=BirdLife Data |archive-date=2020-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622181826/http://datazone.birdlife.org/home |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Saving the cassowary == 
 [[File:Cassowary road sign.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Road sign to protect cassowaries.]] 
 The [[CSIRO]] are studying cassowary faeces to see if they can use their [[DNA]] to count how many birds are left. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/science/Cassowary-management.html |title=Cassowary Management |accessdate=2009-01-18 |format=htm |work=CSIRO Profile Project |archive-date=2010-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221042027/http://www.csiro.au/science/Cassowary-management.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In 2008, the Australian Government stopped rainforest land being used to build houses at Mission Beach. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/garrett/2008/pubs/mr20080728a.pdf |title= Decisive action to protect Mission Beach cassowaries |accessdate=2009-01-18 |work=Media release, Peter Garrat MP }} < /ref >  They are going to try and keep corridors (narrow forest areas) so the birds can move between rainforest areas safely. People will be asked to replant forest trees and plants on their land to help make these corridors. The government is looking at buying land for more corridors. Scientists are finding out when and where cassowaries cross roads. < ref name=jcu/ >  This will mean strict limits on motor car speeds to protect cassowaries that might try to cross some roads. Plans are being looked at to build raised roads so the birds can pass underneath. < ref name=jcu/ > 
 
 Many [[zoo]]s, such as the Australian Reptile Park in [[Gosford, New South Wales|Gosford]], the [[Airlie Beach, Queensland|Airlie Beach]] Wildlife Park and the [[Denver]] Zoo are trying to breed cassowaries. < ref name=sonoma / >  Cassowaries in zoos have lived for up to 60 years. The first cassowary kept in a zoo was in [[Amsterdam]] in 1597. It had been brought back as a present for the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]]. < ref name=sonoma / > 
 
 == Cassowaries in art and music == 
 In 2007, Australian singer [[Christine Anu]], made an [[album]] called ''Chrissy's Island Family''. This is a collection of songs for children. One of the songs is called ''Cassowary''. It is about Samu, the Wakka Woo cassowary. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.creativespirits.info/resources/music/christine-anu.html |title=Christine Anu - Discography |accessdate=2009-01-18 |work=Creative Spirits |archive-date=2008-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094620/http://www.creativespirits.info/resources/music/christine-anu.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  There is picture book for children, called ''Sisi and the Cassowary'', by Arone Raymond Meeks.

 [[England|English]] [[natural history]] writer and artist, [[John Gould]], had drawings of the cassowary in his set of seven books called ''The Birds of Australia''. These were printed in [[London]] between 1851 and 1869. The cassowary drawings were completed by Henry Richter. Richter's [[watercolor]] painting of the cassowary is in the museum in [[Melbourne]], Victoria. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/treasures/image.aspx?img=4 & Simg=1 & path=1 & PID=4 |title=John Gould |accessdate=2009-02-04 |work=Treasures: Melbourne Museum celebrates 150 years |archive-date=2008-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809125240/http://museumvictoria.com.au/treasures/image.aspx?img=4 & Simg=1 & path=1 & PID=4 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
