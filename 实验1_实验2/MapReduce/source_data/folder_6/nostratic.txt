 '''Nostratic''' is a [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] [[language family]] which includes many of the present-day language families of [[Eurasia]]. The idea is that Nostratic was spoken after the [[ice age|ice sheets]] melted but before people spread out throughout Europe and Asia. 
 
 Many of today's languages are descendants of Nostratic, so it is thought. These include the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] and [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] languages. The [[Afroasiatic languages]], native to [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and the [[Near East]], as well as the [[Dravidian languages]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]], are usually included as well. 
 
 The name  " Nostratic "  is derived from the Latin ''nostrates'', meaning  " us "  (in other words, fellow countrymen). The idea was expanded in the 1960s by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] linguists, called the  " Moscovite school "  by Bomhard. < ref > Bomhard, Allan R. and John C. Kerns 1994.

 The hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide. Some linguists are unsure. < ref > For instance Philip Baldi:  " No particular side on the issue is taken in this book "  (Baldi 2002:18). < /ref > 
 
 The hypothetical ancestral language of the Nostratic family is called '''Proto-Nostratic'''. It would have been spoken between 15,000 and 12,000 BC, in the [[Epipalaeolithic]] period, near the end of the last glacial period.
