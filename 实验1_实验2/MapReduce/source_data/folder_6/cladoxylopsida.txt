 The '''cladoxylopsids''' are a group of [[plant]]s known only as [[fossil]]s that may be ancestors of [[fern]]s and [[horsetail]]s. 
 
 They had a central trunk, from the top of which several lateral branches were attached. Fossils of these plants start in the middle [[Devonian]] to early [[Carboniferous]] periods, mostly just as stems. 
 
 Cladoxylopsida contains two orders. The order Hyeniales is now included in [[Pseudosporochnales]]. < ref > Thomas N. Taylor, Edith L. Taylor, Michael Krings 2009.

 Intact fossils of the Middle [[Devonian]] cladoxylopsid ''[[Wattieza]]'' show it was a tree, the earliest known in the fossil record as of 2007.  In 2019, experts discovered more fossils of Cladoxylopsida and ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' in a quarry in [[Cairo, New York]]. < ref > {{cite news |last=Foster |first=Laura |date=Dec 19, 2019 |title=World's oldest fossil trees uncovered in New York |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50840134 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |access-date=Dec 19, 2019}} < /ref >
