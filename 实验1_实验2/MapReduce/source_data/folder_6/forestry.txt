 '''Forestry''' means working to take care of [[forest]]s.  Someone who has a job looking after forests is called a '''forester'''. 
   
 Forests are very important for the [[world]] today. Much of the [[water cycle]] and [[carbon cycle]] goes through forests. Many of them are disappearing because people destroy them for [[firewood]] or [[agriculture|to make farms]]. A forester makes sure the forest and all the [[wildlife|animals]] that live there are healthy.  Foresters also make sure the forest is in good condition for people to use.  They makes sure that forests are not destroyed by wildfires before they are ready to use for [[timber]] production (cutting down trees to use the wood).  
 
 Forests are important for [[recreation]] (letting people enjoy them).  They are very important today because humans produce a lot of [[carbon dioxide]] and the trees in forests help to turn this back into [[oxygen]], which we breathe to live. Foresters also help the government figure out what to do about artificial forestry. Many universities offer forestry courses. Forestry students also study [[zoology]], [[botany]] and [[ecology]].
