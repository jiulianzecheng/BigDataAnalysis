 A '''businessperson''' (also '''businessman''' or '''businesswoman''') is someone who works at a [[Employment|job]] that focuses on making money. Very broadly it can mean anyone who works in [[industry]] or [[commerce]]. More narrowly, it is someone who works in the [[management]] (at high level, when the term is used even more narrowly) of a [[company]]. Sometimes the word means an [[entrepreneur]] or a [[merchant]]. 
 
 Many businessmen wear standard [[dress code|business clothes]]: a [[suit (clothing)|suit]] with [[collar]], [[shirt]], and [[necktie]]. However, this depends on the company, the local [[culture]], and the [[country]]. In more [[wikt:informal|informal]] places, neckties need not be worn.
