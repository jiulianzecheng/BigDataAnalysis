 '''Pomerania''' (''Pommern'' in [[German language|German]], ''Pomorze'' in [[Polish language|Polish]]) is a region on the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is now part of two countries, [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]. 
 
 == Prehistoric tribes == 
 
 20,000 years ago the territory of present-day Pomerania was covered with ice, which did not start to recede until the late period of the [[Old Stone Age]] or [[Paleolithic]] some 10,000 years BC, when the [[Scandinavia]]n [[glacier]] receded to the north. Various archaeological cultures developed in the [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]]. 
 
 Since around 500BC and before 500 AD Pomerania was dominated by [[East Germanic]] tribes including several tribes of [[Goths]], who according to [[Wielbark culture|archeological evidence]] and their own tradition have come from [[Scandinavia]]. Goths and [[Rugians]] are recorded by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians in the areas of Pomerania in 98 AD. The [[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]], non-Germanic tribe, which later assimilated with [[Slavs]], are recorded by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] around Vistula in first century AD. By the [[7th century]] Slavic tribes ([[Wends]]) such as the [[Pomeranians]] settled the area.

 == Conquest and rule == 
 Pomerania was first conquered by the Polish duke [[Mieszko I]] in the second half of the [[10th century]]. Pagan uprisings in 1005 and 1038 resulted in independence for Western Pomerania and Pomerelia, respectively. Regained by Poland in 1116/1121, the Polish could not hold the Pomeranian duchy longer than 1135, whereas Pomerelia after the 1138 [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland]] among the sons of [[Boleslaus Wrymouth]] became a part of the Polish [[seniorat]], < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~koby/political/chapter_02/0214poland1138.jpg |title=Map of Poland before the fragmentation period. |access-date=2008-01-14 |archive-date=2007-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202105830/http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~koby/political/chapter_02/0214poland1138.jpg |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  which was declared fief of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in [[1156]].  
 
 The Western part, the Duchy of Pomerania, was declared part of the Holy Roman Empire (1181). After a brief period of Danish rule (1168/1186-1227), it remained part of [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] until [[1806]].
