[[File:Macaca arctoides.png|thumb|A monkey chewing plant matter - masticating - so it is easier to digest]] 
 '''Chewing''', or '''mastication''', is the first part of the [[digestive system]]. It is when the [[teeth]] chew the food and the [[tongue]] mixes it with [[saliva]] to make it mushy in the mouth. A group of animals, called the [[Ruminant|ruminants]], masticate more than once. Most [[cattle]] are in this group.
