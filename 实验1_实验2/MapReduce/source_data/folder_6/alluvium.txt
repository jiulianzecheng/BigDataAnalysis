 '''Alluvium''' is loose earth which sits on top of consolidated [[sediment]] (~ rock). It usually consists of  loose [[gravel]] and [[clay]]. 
 
 Where people live, it is usually covered with  " made ground " . That is what we call [[pavement]]s, buildings, and [[Road|roads]]. They are the most obvious examples of made ground.
