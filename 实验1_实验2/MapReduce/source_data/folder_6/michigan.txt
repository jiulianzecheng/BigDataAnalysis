 '''Michigan''' is one of the fifty states in the United States of America. It is the 11th largest [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]].  It is made up of two [[peninsula]]s (connected by the [[Mackinac Bridge]]), the only state to be so. It borders the U.S. states of [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Illinois]]. Its borders with Minnesota and Illinois are only by water.  It also borders [[Canada]] by water.  It was the 26th state to join the union on January 26, 1837.  In 1847, Michigan became the first U.S. state to abolish the [[death penalty]]. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/event2/history.html | publisher = Amnesty International | accessdate = 2009-09-03 | title = The Abolition Movement: A Brief History | archive-date = 2010-03-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100306203103/http://www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/event2/history.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Native American]] tribes first settled in Michigan before the arrival of Europeans. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 Michigan is noted as the place where many [[automobile]]s were made, and it still shows today. Michigan is 50% forest, which makes it very useful to the lumber industry. It also borders four of the [[Great Lakes]], which are some of the largest reservoirs of fresh water in the world.  [[Lake Superior]] is the largest body of freshwater in the world. 
 
 ==Culture and weather== 
 The state [[experience]]s four [[season]]s, with the winter being predominant and severe in the north, while the south has more mild, equally long seasons. The northern areas are very popular for skiing in the winter. The National Ski Hall of Fame can be found in [[Ishpeming, Michigan|Ishpeming]] in the [[Upper Peninsula]]. It is surrounded by four of the five Great Lakes. It is also home to the largest mosque in North America, the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn. 
 
 Due to the large amount of water surrounding the state, boating is very popular in the warmer months. There are more private boats registered in Michigan than in any other state. 
 
 ==Famous Michiganders== 
 Many famous people have come from Michigan.  They include the singer [[Madonna Ciccone|Madonna]], the comedian [[Andy Richter]], singer [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Anthony Kiedis]], former president [[Gerald Ford]], singer [[Kid Rock]], rapper [[Eminem]], the former Reverend [[Jim Bakker]], basketball legend [[Magic Johnson]],  [[Diana Ross]], and [[Aretha Franklin]], as well as being the home of [[Henry Ford]], the founder of [[Ford Motor Company]]. 
 
 ==Cities== 
 The [[capital (city)|capital city]] of Michigan is [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], and large [[city|cities]] include [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], and [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]]. [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] is the largest city in the Upper Peninsula. 
 
 ==Education== 
 Michigan has several state universities including [[Michigan State University]], [[University of Michigan]], Saginaw Valley State University, [[Grand Valley State University]], [[Northern Michigan University]] and [[Western Michigan University]]. < ref name= " MSP " > {{cite web|url=http://mich.info/michigan/education/pubcollege.htm|title=Michigan Public Colleges and Universities|publisher=Michigan Start Pages|accessdate=20 April 2011}} < /ref >  The state also has many private colleges. 
 
 ==Politics== 
 The current governor is Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who took office in January 2019, and its two national senators are [[Debbie Stabenow]] and [[Gary Peters]], both Democrats. Out of its 14 congressmen, 7 are Democrats, 6 are Republicans and Justin Amash is a Libertarian. In any event, Michigan had once been reliably blue in presidential elections, having voted for the Democrat in presidential elections since 1988, but then in 2016 it swung red to support Donald Trump. It will be regarded in future as a Swing State. 
 
 === In comparison to the Midwest === 
 In general, Michigan is more [[Liberals in the United States|liberal]] than the states of Indiana, Wisconsin and Ohio, about as liberal as Pennsylvania and Iowa, and less liberal than Illinois and Minnesota.{{fact|date=November 2020}} In the State Legislature, Democrats control both houses by a slim majority.
