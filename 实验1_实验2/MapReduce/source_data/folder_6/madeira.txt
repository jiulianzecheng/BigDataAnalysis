 '''Madeira''' is a Portuguese [[archipelago]] that lies between {{Coord|32|22.3|N|16|16.5|W}} and {{Coord|33|7.8|N|17|16.65|W}}, just under {{convert|400|km}} north of [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]], in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]] and an [[Special Member State territories and the European Union|outermost region of the European Union]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/outermost_regions_en.htm |title=EUROPA - Glossary - Outermost regions |publisher=Europa.eu |accessdate=7 August 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 The archipelago comprises the major part of one of the two [[Autonomous area|autonomous regions]] of [[Portugal]] (the other being the [[Azores]] located to the northwest), that includes the islands of Madeira, [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]], and the [[Desertas Islands|Desertas]], administered together with the separate archipelago of the [[Savage Islands]]. 
 
 The name '''Madeira''' could be used for the autonomous region, the [[Geography|geographical]] group of islands or just the island of Madeira. These islands are part of the [[Macaronesia]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Discovery=== 
 Madeira's official written [[history]] began in 1418, when two [[captain]]s under service to [[Prince]] [[Henry the Navigator]], [[João Gonçalves Zarco]] and [[Tristão Vaz Teixeira]], were pushed by a storm to an island which they named [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]] (English: ''holy harbour''). The following year, an organised expedition was sent to this new land to take possession of the island on behalf of the Portuguese [[crown]]. Later, the new [[settler]]s saw an island to the southwest, and so the larger island of Madeira was discovered. 
 
 ===Settlement=== 
 The islands were found to be completely uninhabited, and their colonization by the Portuguese began around 1420 or 1425. To get the minimum conditions for the development of [[agriculture]], they had to cut part of the dense forest and to construct a large number of [[canal]]s (''levadas'') to carry water, since in some parts of the island there was excess water, while in others water was scarce. During this period, [[fish]] constituted about half of the settlers' diet, together with [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s cultivated from small pieces of land. Initially, these [[Colony|colonists]] produced [[wheat]] for their own subsistence, but later the quantity cultivated was sufficient to begin sending wheat to continental Portugal. 
 
 On the 23 September 1433, the name ''Ilha da Madeira'' (English: ''Madeira Island'', or literally ''island of wood'') began to appear in the first documents and maps. The name given to the islands corresponded to the large dense forests of native trees that covered the island. 
 
 However, when wheat production began to fall, the crisis forced to plant other commercial [[crop]]s. They brought from [[Sicily]] plants of [[sugarcane]] to produce [[sugar]]. After the 17th century, as sugar production went to [[Brazil]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and elsewhere, Madeira's most important product became its [[wine]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 As other islands of the [[Macaronesia]], the Madeira islands are of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin and with a [[Subtropics|subtropical]] [[climate]]. 
 
 ===Location=== 
 The archipelago is in the [[Plate tectonics|African plate]], in the Atlantic Ocean between the [[latitude]]s 30° and 33° north, {{Convert|978|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Lisbon and, about {{Convert|700|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the African coast, almost at the same [[latitude]] as [[Casablanca]]. 
 
 ====Islands and islets==== 
 The Madeira islands have a total area of {{convert|801|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Their individual areas vary between {{convert|740.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the largest island (Madeira) to {{convert|3.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the [[Savage Islands]].

 Of the eight islands, only the two largest (Madeira and Porto Santo) are inhabited, having as main accesses, the Madeira Airport in Funchal and the one in Porto Santo. By sea, Funchal has a [[port]] that receives different ships, especially [[cruise ship]]s. The remaining islands are nature reserves. 
 
 [[File:Pico Ruivo.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pico Ruivo]], the highest peak in Madeira.]] 
 ===Territory=== 
 The territory of the archipelago contains two main islands: the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo; besides these, there are two groups of uninhabited islands, the Desertas and Savages. 
 
 The island of Madeira has a  very irregular and uneven [[terrain]], being the highest points the [[Mountain|peak]]s ''[[Pico Ruivo]]'' (1862 m), ''Pico das Torres'' (1851 m), ''Pico do Ariero'' (1818 m) and ''Pico do Juncal'' (1800 m). The northern coast is dominated by high [[cliff]]s. 
 
 The island of Porto Santo, on the other hand, has a completely different [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] formation of the island of Madeira. It is very flat where only small plants grow and the soils are poor and not very good for agriculture. This island has some peaks, particularly in the north, and the '' Pico do Facho'' (517 m) is the highest point of elevation in the island, followed by ''Pico Branco'' (450 m). 
 
 The highest point of Desertas Islands is ''Pedregal'' (442 m) in Deserta Grande, and of Selvagens Islands is ''Pico da Atalaia'' (153 m), in Selvagem Grande. < ref name= " mad_geo1 " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Madeira Geography: Highest altitudes of Madeira islands|url=http://www.madeirahelp.com/highest_altitudes_madeira_islands#axzz2bQdZ3NjC|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208094427/http://www.madeirahelp.com/highest_altitudes_madeira_islands|archive-date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=9 August 2013|work=Madeira and Porto Santo Islands|publisher=|language=}} < /ref >

 ==Nature== 
 [[File:Lizard, Madeira - Mar 2012.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Madeiran wall lizard]], endemic to the island]] 
 [[File:Pieris wollastoni-PD.png|thumb|right|170px|[[Madeiran Large White]] (female)]] 
 The region of Madeira is home to a great and important [[biodiversity]], with an estimated 7,571 [[terrestrial]] [[species]] for the whole archipelago. The total number of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and [[subspecies]] is about 1,419 (1,286 species and 182 sub-species), which represents 19% of the overall species diversity. 
 
 The most known [[environment]] of the archipelago is its [[Laurel]] forest ([[laurisilva]]) which still extends over 15,000 hectares or 20% of the archipelago. These forests, very rich in biodiversity, are the largest and best-preserved Laurel forests in the entire [[Macaronesia]] region. They are home to unique plant and animal species, including the famous [[Trocaz Pigeon]] or Madeira Laurel Pigeon (''Columba trocaz''), and the [[Madeira Kinglet]] (''Regulus madeirensis''). The most [[Endangered species|threatened]] bird of Europe, the Madeiran or Zino’s Petrel (''Pterodroma madeira'') inhabits the highest cliffs in the Central Mountainous Massif of the Madeira island. 
 
 In the sea around Madeira there are numerous species of [[Sea|marine]] [[mammal]]s, including 28 species of [[cetacea]]ns and the critically endangered [[Mediterranean Monk Seal]] (''Monachus monachus''). < ref name= " iucn " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=About IUCN: Madeira|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/europe/activities/overseas/overseas_list/overseas_madeira.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224151334/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/europe/activities/overseas/overseas_list/overseas_madeira.cfm|archive-date=December 24, 2011|accessdate=9 August 2013|website=|publisher=UICN|language=}} < /ref > 
 
 There are 6 protected areas in the Madeira Archipelago, including the Madeira Natural Park. This park, which covers over 2/3 of Madeira Island and includes the entire Laurel forest, is a European Council Biogenetic Reserve since 1992, and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Natural Heritage Site]] since 1999. < ref name= " iucn2 " > {{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/934 | title=Laurisilva of Madeira |publisher=UNESCO |work=World Heritage List |language= |accessdate=9 August 2013}} < /ref >  Additionally, 11 [[site]]s in the whole archipelago are part of the [[Natura 2000]] [[network]] and 11 other sites are designated [[Important Bird Areas]]. < ref name= " iucn "  / > 
 
 ==Economy== 
 The local economy is based mainly on [[agriculture]] and [[tourism]], the main resource. Agriculture produces [[banana]]s, [[flower]]s, and Madeira [[wine]] which is [[export]]ed. The [[Industry|industrial]] area is not very diverse and they are relationated with food, [[Drink|beverage]]s, [[tobacco]] and [[construction]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/pt3_eco.htm | title=Madeira - Economy | work=Portrait of the Regions | publisher= | language= | accessdate=9 August 2013 | archive-date=15 November 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115211504/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/pt3_eco.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
