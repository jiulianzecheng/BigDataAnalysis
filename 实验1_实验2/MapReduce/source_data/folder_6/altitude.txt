''Altitude'' means height above the [[ground]] or above the [[sea level]]. Common uses include [[aviation]] (flying, parachuting, gliding), and [[geography]]/[[surveying]]. In [[geometry]] it is also used as the height of the object itself.  Generally, altitude is the [[distance]] one thing is above another thing.  This is in the [[vertical]] or  " up "  direction.  For the height of the ground (such as for hills and mountains), the word [[elevation]] is also used and might be a better choice. (Mountain climbers usually use the word altitude, especially when talking about how it affects the body). Buildings and other things on the ground usually just use the word [[height]]. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/n43 34]}} < /ref > 
 
 Vertical distance measurements in the  " down "  direction are commonly referred to as [[:wikt:depth|depth]]. 
 
 == Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight == 
 [[Image:vertical distances.svg|thumb|300px|Vertical Distance Comparison]] 
 In aviation, the altitude can be measured and shown in several different ways.  The height is either from the average sea level  (also called ''Mean Sea Level'' or MSL), or from the ground (also called ''Above Ground Level'', or AGL). 
 
 [[Airplanes]] can find their altitude by using [[air pressure]].  The air gets thinner the higher it is (and it has less pressure, because there's less air pushing down on it from above).  This pressure can be measured and this can be converted into a height above sea level.  The [[gauge|instrument]] for measuring altitude is the [[altimeter]] (from ''altitude'' and ''meter''). The common pressure altimeter is a type of [[barometer#Aneroid barometers|barometer]] with a dial showing distance ([[feet]] or [[metre]]s) instead of [[atmospheric pressure]]. 
 
 There are several types of aviation altitude. 
 
 In simple terms, these types of altitude can be explained as ways of measuring the altitude: 
 *'''Indicated altitude''' -- What the [[altimeter]] indicates (shows) for the height above sea level.  It is usually pretty good, but can be fooled a bit sometimes, it needs to be adjusted to use the local [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]]. 
 *'''True altitude''' -- Altitude as the distance above sea level. 
 *'''Absolute altitude''' -- Altitude as the distance above the terrain (the ground) directly below it (Above Ground Level). 
 *'''Height''' -- Altitude in terms of the distance above some point.  This can also be called the ''terrain elevation''. Radio altimeters measure this height. 
 *'''Pressure altitude''' -- Altitude measured using air pressure.  The air pressure at sea level is normally 1013.25 [[millibar]]s or 29.92 "  [[Mercury (element)|Hg]], when the air [[temperature]] is {{convert|15|C|F}}. ''Pressure altitude'' and ''indicated altitude'' are the same when the altimeter is adjusted to use this standard level. 
 *'''Density altitude''' -- Altitude measured using the [[density]] of the air.  This depends on  [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions (mainly heat and humidity).  There is an ''International Standard Atmosphere'' chart that converts density to altitude. 
 
 The density of the air also affects how well an aircraft works. Density altitude is affected by [[barometric pressure]], [[humidity]] and [[temperature]]. On a very hot day, density altitude at an [[airport]] (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high that aircraft can not [[take-off]]. This most often affects [[helicopter]]s or an aircraft that is carrying a large amount of [[cargo]]. 
 
 == Regions in the atmosphere== 
 The [[Earth's atmosphere]] is divided into several [[region]]s, based on altitude.  The regions have different temperatures and winds and what things are in it. < ref > {{cite web | title=Layers of the Atmosphere | work=JetStream, the National Weather Service Online Weather School | publisher=National Weather Service | url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm | access-date=22 December 2005 | archive-date=19 December 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219190158/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/jetstream/atmos/layers.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The regions are:

 * [[Stratosphere]]  & mdash; Troposphere to {{convert|50|km|mi}} 
 * [[Mesosphere]]  & mdash; Stratosphere to {{convert|85|km|mi}} 
 * [[Thermosphere]]  & mdash; Mesosphere to {{convert|675|km|mi}} 
 * [[Exosphere]]  & mdash; Thermosphere to {{convert|10000|km|mi}} 
 
 == High altitude and low air pressure== 
 Regions on the surface of the [[Earth]] or in its [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that are high above [[mean sea level]] are said to be '''high altitude'''. High altitude is often said to begin at {{convert|8000|ft|m|disp=flip}} above sea level. < ref name=websterMed > {{cite book|title=Webster's New World Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8578|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-18928-3|year=2008|access-date=2012-01-25|archive-date=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208154830/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8578|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm|title=An Altitude Tutorial|publisher=International Society for Mountain Medicine|access-date=2011-06-22|archive-date=2012-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103205616/http://www.ismmed.org/np_altitude_tutorial.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name=MedicalProblems/ > 
 
 At high altitude, [[atmospheric pressure]] is lower than that at sea level. This is because of two effects. These effects are [[gravity]] and the [[heat]] in the air. Gravity makes the air to be as close as possible to the ground. The amount of heat in the air makes the [[molecule]]s move quickly and push against each other. This makes the air expand.  So most of the air will be in the lower atmosphere, closer to sea level, and all the air pushing against each other is called air pressure.  So air pressure is less the higher you go.  < ref name=nova > {{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/everest/exposure/pressure.html|title=Atmospheric pressure|work=NOVA Online Everest|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|access-date=January 23, 2009}} < /ref > 
 
 As the air expands from heat, it rises to where the air pressure is less. As it rises, it can expand and it begins to cool. < ref > {{cite book|author=Mark Zachary Jacobson|title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modelling|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2nd|year=2005|isbn=0-521-83970-X}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|author=C. Donald Ahrens|title=Meteorology Today|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing|edition=8th|year=2006|isbn=0-495-01162-2}} < /ref >   Because of this, high altitude air is cold. This causes an [[alpine climate]]. This climate affects the [[ecology]] at high altitude.

 The human body can deal with high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher [[heart]] rate, and changing the [[blood]] itself to have more [[red blood cell]]s that can carry oxygen. < ref name=BordenHuman > {{cite book |author=Young, Andrew J. and Reeves, John T. |title=Human Adaptation to High Terrestrial Altitude.

This works for people who live in the high mountains, and [[mountain climber]]s.  For climbers, this is called ''acclimatization''. Pilots and other people who go quickly to high altitudes need to be in a space suit, pressure suit, or inside a pressurized airplane, so the air is still the same as at the ground.  Above {{convert|8000|m|ft|-3}}, the human body cannot make the needed changes and will eventually die.  Several of the world's tallest mountains are this high, the climbers usually take oxygen tanks with them, and only stay for a few hours at the highest levels. < ref name= " PBS " > {{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2506everest.html
