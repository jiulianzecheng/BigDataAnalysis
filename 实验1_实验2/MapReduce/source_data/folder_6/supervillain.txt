'''Supervillains''', sometimes called '''supercriminals''', are [[fictional characters]] generally appearing in [[comic books]] and in [[superhero movie]]s as [[antagonist]]s of [[superhero]]es. A Supervillain normally has [[powers]] that make him or her a [[threat]] that only a [[superhero]] can stop.  A lot of Supervillains are [[enemies]] of specific [[superheroes]]. For example, the Supervillain [[Lex Luthor]] is an [[enemy]] of [[Superman]], The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] is an enemy of [[Batman]], and the [[Green Goblin]] is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].
