 == History of Accra == 
 
 [[File:Central accra-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Central Accra]] 
 
 Accra was [[:wikt:found|founded]] by the [[Ga (people)|Ga]] people in the late 1600s. The word Accra comes from the word ''Nkran'' meaning [[ant]]s. This is because of the many anthills seen in the countryside around Accra. During part of its history, Accra was a very important place for [[trade]] with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. The Portuguese built a [[fort]] in the town. Many other countries also built forts at Accra during the [[17th century]]. These countries included [[Sweden]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]] and [[Denmark]]. 
 
 The location that is Accra today grew into a large town around the original Ga town. As the city grew, the [[Great Britain|British]], [[Denmark|Danish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] forts and the small [[community|communities]] that formed around the forts were made added to the city. 
 
 In 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Ashanti_wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony. After a [[railroad]] was built between Accra and the inland locations of [[mining|mines]] and [[farm]]s, Accra became the economic center of Ghana.  Large areas of the city were destroyed by [[earthquake]]s in [[1862]] and [[1939]], but the city rebuilt around a [[seaport]] and later a [[brewery]]. Each time it rebuilt, the city was made larger. 
 
 The [[1948_Accra_riots|Accra Riots]] in [[1948]] started people in Ghana fighting for [[independence]]. This led to the [[Ghana]]'s independence from the United Kingdom and it becoming a country in [[1957]]. 
 
 Today, Accra is  one of the richest and most modern cities in the [[Africa]]n [[continent]]. It has a high quality of living by African standards.
