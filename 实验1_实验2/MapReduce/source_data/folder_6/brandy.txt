 == Labelling of grades == 
 Brandy has a traditional age grading system, although its use is unregulated outside of [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]]. These indicators can usually be found on the label near the brand name: 
 
 * '''V.S.''' ( " very special " ) or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask. < ref name= " BNIC etiquette " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette|title=Website of the BNIC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223223212/http://www.bnic.fr/cognac/_en/2_cognac/index.aspx?page=etiquette|archive-date=23 December 2016|access-date=9 March 2015|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 * '''V.S.O.P.''' ( " very superior old pale " ), '''Reserve''' or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask. < ref name= " BNIC etiquette "  / > 
 * '''XO''' ( " extra old " ) or '''Napoléon''' designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years. < ref name= " BNIC etiquette "  / > 
 * '''Hors d'âge''' ( " beyond age " ) is a designation which is formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.
