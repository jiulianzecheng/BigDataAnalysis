 '''Rye''' is a type of [[grass]], usually grown as a [[grain]] or forage crop (meaning that it is fed to animals). It is a member of the wheat family of plants and is similar to [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. It is used to make [[flour]], [[food]] for animals, and many types of [[alcohol]]ic drinks. 
 
 ==History== 
 Rye has not always been a plant humans can use. It was originally a wild [[plant]]. There are several wild plants in [[Turkey]] that are similar to rye.

 Since the [[Middle Ages]], rye has been used widely in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. In these parts of the world, it is still one of the main [[ingredient]]s in making [[bread]]. However, the number of people and businesses using rye is becoming lower. Rye is usually sold to buyers near to where it is grown. 
 
 ==Science== 
 Rye can be planted to feed animals or can be [[harvest]]ed for [[hay]] (dry grass). Rye is a strong plant that can survive in soil with a high or low [[pH]]. This means it can survive even if the [[soil]] is very [[acid]]ic or [[alkaline]]. Other plants may struggle to survive in these pH levels. 
 
 ==Uses for humans== 
 Rye has been used to make many foods for humans. It includes [[rye bread]]s, like [[pumpernickel]], a popular bread in north and east [[Europe]]. It has also been used to make some alcoholic drinks, such as [[rye whiskey]].
