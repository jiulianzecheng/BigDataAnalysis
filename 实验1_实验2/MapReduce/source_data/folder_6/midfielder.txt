 A '''midfielder''' in football is a player who usually plays in the centre of the field. There are usually a number of midfielders in each team of football, and are normally split into three: attacking; central; and defending. 
 
 The midfielders are always the middle parts of the formation numbers, for example: 
 
 An '''attacking midfielder''' is a midfielder who is often positioned between the central midfielders and the [[Striker|forward]]s. They often have a primarily offensive role. < ref name= " Talk " > {{cite web |url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/positions_in_football.html |title=Positions in football |publisher=talkfootball.co.uk |access-date=21 June 2008}} < /ref >  '''Playmakers''' are a type of attacking midfielders. Some famous Attacking Midfielders include [[Kaká]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]], and [[Zinedine Zidane]].
