 '''Aethelthryth''' (sometimes called '''Æthelthryth''', '''Æðelþryð''', '''Æþelðryþe''', or '''Etheldreda''' (about 636 AD – June 23, 679 AD) was an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[saint]].  She was also an  [[East Anglia]]n princess and Abbess of Ely. 
 
 == Life == 
 Aethelthryth was born in East Anglia (now [[Suffolk]]). She was one of the four daughters of Anna of [[East Anglia]].  All of these women became nuns and founded [[abbey]]s. < ref > N. J. Higham, ''An English Empire: Bede and the Early Anglo-Saxon Kings'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), p. 236 < /ref > 
 
 She was a beautiful young girl who wanted to devote herself to the Church and took a vow to remain a virgin. < ref name=Fairweather17 > ''Liber Eliensis; a History of the Isle of Ely from the Seventh to Twelfth Century'', ed. Janet Fairweather (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2004), p. 17 < /ref >  When the ''[[:en:wikt:princeps|princips]]'' Tondberht of the [[Gyrwas|South Gyrwas]]. < ref name= " J. Higham, 1995 p. 124 " > N. J. Higham, ''An English Empire: Bede and the Early Anglo-Saxon Kings'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), p. 124 < /ref >  asked for her hand in marriage her parents said yes, but Aethelthryth refused. < ref name=Fairweather17/ >  Though she was married she resolved to keep her solomn vow. < ref name=Fairweather17/ > < ref name= " J. Higham, 1995 p. 124 " / >  Upon his death in 655, she retired to the [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Isle of Ely]], which she had received from her husband as a gift. 
 
 Aethelthryth was then married to [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]] in 660. Ecgfrith was a younger son of King [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] and his wife Enfleda. < ref name=Ashley284 > Mike Ashley, ''The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens'' (New York: Carroll  &  Graf, 1999), p. 284 < /ref >  Shortly after Ecgfrith became king, Aethelthryth asked her husband if she could become a nun. < ref > N. J. Higham, ''An English Empire: Bede and the Early Anglo-Saxon Kings'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), p. 236-237 < /ref >  She was encouraged by [[Bishop]] [[Wilfrid]] to remain [[:en:wikt:celibate|celibate]]. < ref name=Stenton135 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 135 < /ref >  This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid.  One story tells that Ecgfrith first agreed that she should continue to remain a virgin but in about 672 he wished to have an [[heir]].  He tried to bribe Wilfrid to convince the queen to give him an heir. This failed and the king tried to take his queen from her [[convent]]. She fled back to Ely with two [[nun]]s and managed to evade capture.  The [[legend]] says that she escaped due to the miraculous rising of the tide. Another version of the legend stated that she stopped on the journey at 'Stow' and hid under an ash tree which suddenly came from her staff after she planted it in the ground. This came to be known as 'St Aethelthryth 's Stow', when a church was built to commemorate this event. < ref > Virginia Blanton, ''Signs of Devotion: The Cult of St. Æthelthryth in Medieval England, 695-1615'' 
  (University Park, PA:Pennsylvania State University Press, 2007), p. 154 < /ref >  Stow Minster contains a [[stained glass]] window that portrays the legend.  Ecgfrith later married Eormenburg and expelled Wilfrid from his kingdom in 678. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', Aethelthryth founded a double [[monastery]] at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in 673, which was later destroyed in the [[Viking|Danish]] invasion of 870. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.stowminster.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=8 & Itemid=8|title=Stow Minster: History|publisher=Stow Minster|access-date=27 November 2010|location=Stow-in-Lindsey, Lincs., UK|archive-date=17 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617185515/http://www.stowminster.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=8 & Itemid=8|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   She lived at St. Ely for the remainder of her life in pious devotion.  She died of the [[plague]]. < ref > Alban Butler; Paul Burns, ''Lives of the Saints " " , (Collegeville, Minnesota:  Liturgical Press 2003), p. 228 < /ref >   There is a [[hymn]] that was written in her honor. < ref > N.

 Aethelthryth's niece and her great-niece, both of whom were royal princesses, succeeded her as abbess of Ely.

 [[Bede]] and The ''Liber Eliensis'' describe how in 695, Aethelthryth's body was dug up by her sister Seaxburth, to be transferred from a common grave to the new church at Ely. She had been dead sixteen years.  When her body was exhumed it was said to have been just as it was when she was alive.  She was reburied in a white, marble [[coffin]]. < ref > Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', p. 53. < /ref > < ref > Fairweather, ''Liber Eliensis'', pp. 56-61. < /ref >  Aethelthryth's uncorrupted body and clothes were said to have [[miracle|miraculous]] powers. A burial chamber made of white marble was taken from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for Aethelthryth.  Seaxburh supervised the preparation of her sister's body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied. < ref > Ridyard, ''The Royal Saints'', p. 179. < /ref >  Seaxburgh apparently oversaw the transference of her sister's remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge gained from her family's links. < ref > Yorke, '' Nunneries'', p. 50. < /ref > 
 
 St Etheldreda's Church is dedicated to the saint. It was originally part of the palace of the Bishops of Ely. In later years the palace was used by the Spanish Ambassadors, enabling Roman Catholic worship to continue in the church.  It is now a Roman Catholic parish church in Ely, [[Cambridgeshire]]. It is part of the Diocese of East Anglia within the Province of [[Westminster]]. The church contains the shrine and relics of Aethelthryth. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.stetheldreda.com/index.php/history-of-st-etheldredas/#1 |title=St. Etheldreda's Church |access-date=2014-01-16 |archive-date=2013-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715075343/http://www.stetheldreda.com/index.php/history-of-st-etheldredas/#1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
