 '''''Carcharodontosaurus''''' was a giant [[carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]] of the [[Cretaceous]] period, 100 - 94 million years ago. < ref > The name means 'sharp toothed [[lizard]]'. < /ref >  It was about 12 [[metre|meters]] long and had a weight of about 8.2 [[ton]]s, and a height of 5 metres tall. [[Fossil]]s of ''Carcharodontosaurus'' were found in [[Africa]] by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Ernst stromer|Ernst Stromer]].  
 
 ''Carcharodontosaurus'' was closely related to the slightly larger than ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', its cousin from [[Argentina]]; they are both carcharodontosaurid carnosaurs. Recent discoveries of ''Carcharodontosaurus'' put its adult length at 39 - 49 feet, making it the largest carnivorous dinosaur in Africa, after ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. 
 
 Only two ''Carcharodontosaurus'' [[fossil]]s have been found. Two teeth were found in the 1920s. Other parts were found in [[Egypt]] in the 1930s. They were destroyed in bombing raids on [[Munich]] in [[World War II]] while they were on display. < ref name=Helen/ > 
 
 A skull was uncovered in 1996: its length estimates were larger than the older ones and so was its skull, which measured 5.2 feet or 1.6 [[metres]]. < ref name=Helen > {{cite web  | last = Briggs  | first = Helen   | title = New meat-eating dinosaur unveiled  | work = Carcharodontosaurus iguidensis was one of the largest meat-eaters that ever lived  | publisher = BBC NEWS  | date = 2007-12-12  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7138782.stm   | format =  | doi =  | accessdate=December 15, 2007}}
