 It flows through the areas of [[Puthimari]], [[Medhikuchi]], [[Pathsala]], [[Dhumarkur]], [[Bhawanipur]], [[Kayakuchi]] and the Barpeta district. 
 
 Frequent rains in [[monsoon]] season often make the Pahumara river [[flood]] in many places, such as [[paddy field]]s (underwater fields for growing rice) and roads in the [[Bahari]] sub-division of the Barpeta district. During this time the river is quite dangerous. < ref name =  " BBWR "  / >  Sometimes the river floods when the Kurichhu [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in Bhutan opens its [[dam]]. < ref > Parasher, Utpal (25 July 2019).
