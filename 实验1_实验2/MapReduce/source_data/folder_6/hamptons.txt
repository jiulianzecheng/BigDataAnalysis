The '''Hamptons''' is a posh [[beach]]front area in [[Long Island]], [[New York State]]. The area is primarily occupied during the [[summer]] as [[multimillionaire]] and [[billionaire]] homeowners use their [[mansion]]s and luxury [[condominium]]s as [[vacation home]]s. Most houses in the Hamptons are the same style, so much so that the area has its own [[architectural style]]. 
 
 Historically, the Hamptons were full of [[fishing]] [[village]]s, then during the [[Gilded Age]], the ultra wealthy began to move in.
