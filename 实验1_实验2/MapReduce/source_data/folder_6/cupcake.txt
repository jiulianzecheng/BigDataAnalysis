 The first cupcake could be traced back to 1796. A [[recipe]] for  " a cake to be baked in small cups "  was written in ''[[American Cookery]]'' by Amelia Simmons. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Food Timeline|publisher=Lynne Olver|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#cupcakes}} < /ref >  The earliest use of the term ''cupcake'' was in “Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats” in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's ''Recipes'' cookbook. < ref name= " first " > {{cite web |url=http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history |title=Food Timeline |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-date=2 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202125111/http://www.crazyaboutcupcakes.com/learning.htm#history |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In the early [[19th century]], there were two different uses for the name ''cup cake'' or ''cupcake''. Before [[muffin tin]]s were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual [[pottery]] cups, [[ramekin]]s, or molds. They got their name from the cups they were baked in. The name  " fairy cake "  is a description of its size. It would be appropriate for a party of small [[fairies]] to share a fairy cake. [[England|English]] ''fairy cakes'' vary in size more than [[United States|American]] cupcakes. They are normally smaller and are rarely topped with much icing. 
 
 The other kind of  " cup cake "  referred to a cake whose [[ingredient]]s were measured by [[volume]]. They were measured using a standard-sized cup instead of being weighed. Recipes with ingredients that were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups. They were more commonly baked in tins. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was more used in home kitchens, these recipes became known as ''1234 cakes'' or ''quarter cakes''. They were called this because they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs. < ref name= " Food Timeline " > {{cite web |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#1234cake |title=The Food Timeline: cake history notes |accessdate=14 March 2008 }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcakes.html#cupcakes Cupcakes] - Food Timeline < /ref >  They are plain yellow cakes that are less rich and less expensive than [[pound cake]]. This is because they use about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were to tell the baker whether to measure by volume or weight. < ref name= " Food Timeline " / >
