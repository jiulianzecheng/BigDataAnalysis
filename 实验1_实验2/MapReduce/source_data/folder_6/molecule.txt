 A '''molecule''' is the smallest amount of a [[chemical substance]] that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different [[substance]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/|title=The IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology: The Gold Book|date=2019|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)|editor-last=Gold|editor-first=Victor|edition=4|location=Research Triangle Park, NC|language=en|doi=10.1351/goldbook.m04002}} < /ref > 
 
 Molecules are made up of [[atom]]s that are stuck together in a particular shape or [[form]]. Not all combinations of atoms are equally possible; atoms make certain shapes in preference to others.  Also, they have different [[valency]].  For example, [[oxygen]] atoms always have two bonds with other atoms, [[carbon]] atoms always have four bonds with other atoms, and [[nitrogen]] atoms always have three bonds with other atoms. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47953855|title=Chemistry : the central science.|date=2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|others=Theodore L.

 In the [[w:Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are in fact monoatomic molecules. < ref > {{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[gas]]es like [[air]], the molecules are just flying around. In [[liquid]]s like [[water]], the molecules are stuck together but they can still move. In [[solid]]s like [[sugar]], the molecules can only [[vibrate]].  In the fourth [[state of matter]] known as [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], the atoms are [[Ionization|ionized]] and cannot form molecules. 
 
 With a [[molecular formula]], you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula of [[glucose]] is C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub > . That means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/711906521|title=Chemistry|last=Chang|first=Raymond|date=1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-115221-0|edition=6th|location=Boston, Mass.|oclc=711906521}} < /ref > 
 
 == Bonding == 
 
 For a molecule to exist, [[atoms]] have to stick together. This happens when two atoms share [[electron]]s. Instead of circling just one atom, the electron now circles around two. This is called a [[covalent bond]].  Sometimes, more than one electron is shared. The more [[electron]] < nowiki/ > s are shared, the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20570258|title=Chemical structure and bonding|last=DeKock|first=Roger L.|date=1989|publisher=University Science Books|others=Harry B. Gray|isbn=0-935702-61-X|edition=2nd|location=Mill Valley, Calif.|oclc=20570258}} < /ref > 
 
 Bonds can also be broken apart. Since most bonds require energy to form, they also give off [[energy]] when they are broken. But before most bonds break, the molecule has to be heated. Then the atoms start to move, and when they move too much, the bond breaks. Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called [[Fuel|fuels]]. For example, a candle will just sit there and nothing happens. But when you use a match to light it, it will burn for a long time. The match brings the energy to break the first bonds, which release enough energy to break the bonds below them, until the candle has burned down. There are also [[ionic bond]]s. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/75299209|title=Biology : exploring life|last=Campbell|first=Neil A.|date=2006|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|others=Brad Williamson, Robin J.
