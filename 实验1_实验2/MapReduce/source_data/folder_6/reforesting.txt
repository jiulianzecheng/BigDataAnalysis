 '''Reforesting''' is the [[wikt:process|process]] of replacing [[plant]]s in an area where they have been cut down or destroyed. It usually refers to [[tree]]s, but could include other types of plant life.  
 
 Reforestation is often needed after [[deforestation]], when trees are cut down to make [[lumber]]. 
 
 Reforestation also regains back [[habitat|the homes]] of animals.
