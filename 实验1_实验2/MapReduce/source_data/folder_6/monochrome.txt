'''Monochrome''' comes from the two [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''mono'' (meaning  " one " ) and ''chroma'' (meaning  " surface "  or  " the [[colour]] of the [[skin]] " ). If something is '''monochromatic''', it only has a single color.  
 
 In [[physics]], the word is used when talking about [[electromagnetic radiation]] of a single [[wavelength]].  
 
 For an [[image]], the term monochrome usually means the same as [[black]]-and-[[white]] or [[grayscale]]. It may also be used when talking about other [[combination]]s that only have two colors, for example, [[green]]-and-white or green-and-black. In [[computer|computing]], monochrome has two meanings: 
 
 *It may mean having only one color which is either on or off.  If it also has shades of that color, then it is called grayscale. 
 *A monochrome [[computer]] [[computer monitor|monitor]] can only show a single color, often [[green]], [[yellow|amber]], [[red]] or [[white]]. It can often also show shades of that color.
