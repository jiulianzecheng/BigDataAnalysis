 '''Agranulocytosis''' is a [[medicine|medical]] condition where there are very few [[granulocyte]]s (a kind of [[white blood cell]]) in the [[blood]]. It is a type of severe and dangerous [[leukopenia]] (a condition of very low number of white blood cells). If the agranulocytosis is because of a lack of [[neutrophil]]s (called [[neutropenia]]), it is especially bad. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/asp/dictionary.asp?keyword=agranulocytosis|title=eMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/204821-overview|title=Neutropenia: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology|date=4 February 2019|publisher=|via=eMedicine}} < /ref >
