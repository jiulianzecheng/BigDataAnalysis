 The '''Linaceae''' is a family of [[flowering plant]]s. The family is cosmopolitan, and includes exactly 250 species. There are 14 genera, [[classification|classified]] into two subfamilies: Linoideae and Hugonioideae (often recognized as a distinct family, the Hugoniaceae). Leaves of Linaceae are always simple. Their arrangement varies from alternate (most species) to opposite (in ''Sclerolinon'' and some ''[[Linum]]'') or whorled (in some ''Hesperolinon'' and ''Linum'').
