 '''Profanity''', also known as swearing, are words which are considered to be rude, inappropriate or offensive. The [[adjective]] is ''profane''. Profanities can also be called [[curse]] ( " cuss " ) words, [[swear words]], dirty words, bad words, foul language, strong language, [[obscenity]], obscene language, or expletives. It can be called swearing, although this also has a normal meaning of making a  " solemn promise " . A profanity usually refers to [[religion]], [[sex]], or bodily functions. These are things that people feel very strongly about. In some languages, such as [[French language|French]], there is more profanity about religion than most other topics. This is the original meaning, from a Latin word meaning  " before the temple " .   
 
 Religious profanity is called [[blasphemy]]. The [[verb]] is to blaspheme and the [[adjective]] is 'blasphemous'. Saying “God!” or “Jesus Christ!” as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many to be blasphemy, mostly because one of the [[Ten Commandments]] says not to use God's name  " in vain "  (without substance or without relevance). Swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow Jesus' teaching against swearing oaths in the [[Gospel]]s (such as Matthew 5:34). 
 
 A profanity can be a word or [[gesture]] or some other form of behavior. < ref > " [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/profane Definition of Profane] " , emphasis on original, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved on June 5, 2007. < /ref > 
 
 Different words can be profane to different people, and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time. 
 
 Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think. Some people will be offended by something, while others will not be. Words which should not be used are [[taboo]] words. Using such words is thought by some people to be a [[sin]]. For example, some [[Christianity|Christians]] and some [[Islam|Muslims]] believe that swearing is a sin. < ref name=swearingisbad > {{cite web|url=http://www.openbible.info/topics/bad_words|title=Bad Words [in the Bible]|publisher=OpenBible.info|access-date=30 April 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 == Opinions on profanity == 
 Some people call profanity  " crude, "  but some say that it is no cruder to say  " damn "  or  " crap "  than it is to use  " [[Hatred|hate]] "  (a word that is about a very strong [[Emotions|emotion]], but not a swear word). People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad, and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely, from person to person. Most often, using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings (usually unpleasant ones), that might otherwise cause a physical reaction. At other times, some people may use profanity as [[humor]]. 
 
 == Coprolalia == 
 [[Coprolalia]] is a mental condition that makes people use profanity constantly. It is different from [[Tourette syndrome]]. Tourette syndrome is actually a group of [[symptom|symptoms]] that only includes coprolalia 15% of the time. The condition can be made worse by stress. 
 
 == Examples of profanity == 
 Several of these words come from [[Anglo-Saxon]] or old [[Norse]] names for body parts, and bodily functions. They came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the [[Normandy|Norman]]s brought [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]] words for them to England.
