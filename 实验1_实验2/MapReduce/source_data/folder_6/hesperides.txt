The '''Hesperides''' ({{lang-grc|Ἑσπερίδες}}) are [[nymph]]s in [[Greek mythology]]. They look after a peaceful [[garden]] in the far west of the world. The garden is located near [[Cyrene]] (or [[Benghazi]]) in [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] or the [[Atlas Mountains]] further west. In the Ancient Greek view of the world, this is at the edge of [[Oceanus]], the world-ocean. The nymphs are said to be the daughters of [[Hesperus]].
