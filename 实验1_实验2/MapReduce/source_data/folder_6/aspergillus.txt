 '''''Aspergillus''''' is a large [[genus]] of [[fungi]] in the [[phylum]] [[Ascomycota]]. There are several hundred [[species]] or types, some of which are important to medicine, science and industry. < ref name= Bennettjw > {{cite book |author= Bennett JW|year=2010|chapter=An overview of the genus ''Aspergillus''|chapter-url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf|title=''Aspergillus'': molecular biology and genomics|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-53-0}} < /ref >  It grows as a [[mould]], often on plants. The fungi make [[asexual]] [[spore]]s in a structure called an ''aspergillum''. About one third of types also have [[sexual reproduction]]. < ref > Geiser D. 2009. Sexual structures in ''Aspergillus'': morphology, importance and genomics. ''Medical Mycology'' '''47''' Suppl 1: S21–S26. [http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13693780802139859] < /ref > 
 
 ''Aspergillus'' species are highly [[aerobic]] and are found in almost all oxygen-rich environments. They are common contaminants of starchy foods (such as bread and potatoes), and grow in or on many plants and trees. 
 
 Species of ''Aspergillus'' are important medically and commercially. Some species can cause [[infection]] in humans and other animals. More than 60 ''Aspergillus'' species are medically relevant pathogens. < ref name=thom > Thom C.  &  Church M. 1926. ''The Aspergilli''. Baltimore: Williams  &  Wilkins. < /ref >  For humans there is a range of diseases such as infection to the external ear, skin lesions, and ulcers classed as [[Eumycetoma|mycetomas]].
