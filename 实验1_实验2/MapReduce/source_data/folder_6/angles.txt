{{Distinguish|Angle}} 
 The '''Angles''' were [[Germanic peoples]] from Northern Germany and Denmark who invaded Britain from around 410 CE.  Their name seems to be connected with [[Angeln]], a modern district in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]].  The Angles, together with the [[Jutes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Frisians]], were among the [[tribe]]s who sailed across the [[North Sea]] in the 5th century to [[invasion|invade]] [[Britain]]. < ref > Peter Hunter Blair; Simon Keynes, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 10 < /ref >   The various tribes were later called  " [[Anglo-Saxon]] " . < ref > Mark Harrison. They came to rule Britain and became known as ''Anglo-Saxon Thegn AD 449-1066'' (London: Osprey, 1993), p. 3 < /ref > .
