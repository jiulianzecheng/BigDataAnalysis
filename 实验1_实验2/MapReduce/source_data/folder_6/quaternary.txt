The '''Quaternary''' is the current [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]]. It is the most recent of the three periods of the [[Cainozoic]] [[era]]. The Quaternary follows the [[Neogene]], which is the second period of the Cainozoic.

 The Quaternary began about 2.6 million years ago, and continues today. A great deal of information is considered when geologists discuss the timing of periods. < ref > Gibbard P.L. ''et al'' 2007.

Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England. < /ref >  The status of the Quaternary as a period is confirmed by the ''International Commission on Stratigraphy'' (ICS).  
 
 In the Quarternary were the [[glaciation]]s known as the [[Ice Age]]. Also, [[Homo sapiens|anatomically modern humans]] [[evolved]]. During the Quaternary,  many large [[mammal]]ian [[species]] became [[extinct]]. This was due to [[climate change]] and [[hunting]] by humans. < ref > Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. eds 1984.

 The Quaternary includes two geologic [[Epoch (geology)|epochs]]:  
 *[[Pleistocene]]  
 *[[Holocene]]
