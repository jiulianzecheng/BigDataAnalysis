 '''Sveagruva''' (sometimes called '''Svea''', translates to 'mine of the Swedes') was a mining settlement on [[Spitsbergen]]. It was used to get [[coal]] from the Svea Nord mine, the biggest [[mine]] on Spitsbergen. It is the southernomst settlement on Spitsbergen, not counting the Polish research station at Hornsund. The mine was closed in 2016. Only few people permanently lived in Sveagruva. Most poeple lived in [[Longyearbyen]] with their families, and commuted to work. 
 
 There are no [[Road|roads]] to connect Sveagruva to other settlements. There is an [[airport]], and there is a [[port]], about {{Convert|5|km}} away. The coal was transported by [[ship]], the people used [[airplanes]].  Since 2020, there have not been permanent residents in Sveagruva. It is a [[ghost town]].
