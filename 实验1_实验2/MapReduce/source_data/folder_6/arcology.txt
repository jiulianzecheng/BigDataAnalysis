An '''arcology''' ([[portmanteau]] of ''[[architecture]]'' and ''[[ecology]]'') is a completely self sufficient [[building]] or [[complex]] which not only would provide the basic facilities of a [[city]] or [[town]], but would also produce its own [[electricity]] and [[food]] as well as [[recycle]] its own waste. The building or compound would thus be akin to a self-contained [[ecosystem]]. 
 
 Many designs for arcologies have been proposed over the years. These include [[Broadacre City]] by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Mile-high Chicago]]. The design for Mile-high Chicago was  a {{Cvt|5200|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall building with 527 floor levels. Other examples include [[Tokyo SkyCity]], [[SpaceCity 6000]], [[Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid]] and [[Freedom Ship]].
