 '''Finches''' are [[passerine]] [[songbird]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Fringillidae'''. < ref > Though the word 'finch' is sometimes used for birds from other families. < /ref >  They are mostly [[seed]]-eaters. The [[scientific name]] Fringillidae comes from the [[Latin]] word ''fringilla'' for the [[Chaffinch]] (''Fringilla coelebs''), which is common in [[Europe]]. 
 
 Most [[species]] are native to the [[Southern Hemisphere]], but one [[subfamily]] is [[endemism|endemic]] to the Neo[[tropics]], one to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one [[genus]] is found only in the Palaearctic (Eurasia and north Africa). 
 
 Many birds in other families are also commonly called  " finches "  They include  
 :• some [[species]] in the very similar-looking [[waxbill]]s (family [[Passeridae]], of the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]; 
 :• several groups of the bunting and American sparrow family ([[Emberizidae]]); 
 :• [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s 'finches' of the [[Galapagos Islands]], which provided evidence of [[natural selection]]. They are now recognized to be peculiar [[tanager]]s (Thraupidae). < ref name = nc7393 > Newton, Ian 1973. ''Finches'' (New Naturalist series).
