[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Parmenides]] was among the first to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of reality]] 
 
 '''Ontology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of the nature of ''[[being]], ''becoming'', [[existence]]'', or ''[[reality]]''. It is part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]].  
 
 Ontology deals with questions about what things exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences.  
 
 == Overview == 
 Ontology asks whether  " categories of being "  are fundamental.  
 
 Some philosophers, of the [[Platonism|Platonic school]], say that all nouns (including [[abstract noun]]s) refer to actual [[entity|entities]]. Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities. They think some are a kind of shorthand for a collection of either [[object]]s or [[event]]s.  
 
 In this view, ''[[mind]]'', instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of ''mental events'' experienced by a ''[[person]]''. ''[[Society]]'' refers to a collection of ''persons'' with some shared characteristics, and ''[[geometry]]'' refers to a collection of a specific kind of intellectual activity. < ref > {{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XU5atV1nfukC & q=platonic+writings+griswold |title=Platonic writings/Platonic readings |first=Charles L. |last=Griswold |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2001 |page=237 |isbn=9780271021379}} < /ref >   
 
 Between these poles, called [[Platonic realism|realism]] and [[nominalism]], are other positions. Any ontology must give an account of which words refer to entities, which do not, why, and what categories result.
