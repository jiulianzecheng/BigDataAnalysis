'''Dord''' is a [[ghost word]], a [[word]] that was never used, but accidentally added to a dictionary. In 1934, the New International [[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] printed the word, ''dord'', [[definition|defining]] it as 'density'. [[Philip Babcock Gove]] was an editor at Merriam-Webster and became editor-in-chief of Webster's Third New International Dictionary. Gove wrote a letter to the journal [[American Speech]] fifteen years after the error was caught. He explained why  " Dord "  was printed in the second edition of the New International Dictionary. It got through when a slip was sent saying ''D or d''. Because the [[letters]] were typed with [[space (punctuation)|space]]s between, it looked like it said  " Dord " . 
 
 In 1939, five years after the dictionary was [[publish]]ed, an editor found out that ''dord'' was not a word, but the word was not fully removed from the dictionary until 1947. Dord is the only known ghost word in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary's history.
