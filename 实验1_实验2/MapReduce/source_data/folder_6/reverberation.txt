'''Reverberation''' is  when [[sound|sound waves]] continue to [[vibrate]] after the original source of the sound has stopped emitting sound. Reverberation can cause [[echo|echoes]]. 
 
 '''Reverberation time''' is a period when the sound is gone in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped. In the end of 19th century [[Wallace Clement Sabine]] experimented with reverberation time. He determined the relationship between the quality of acoustics, the size of the chamber, and the amount of absorption surfaces present. < ref > {{Cite web|title=NIHF Inductee Wallace Clement Sabine Invented Architectural Acoustics|url=https://www.invent.org/inductees/wallace-clement-sabine|access-date=2021-10-02|website=www.invent.org|language=en}} < /ref >
