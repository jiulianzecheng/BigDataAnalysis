 '''Holland''' is the name of a region in the western part of the [[Netherlands]]. Holland was a [[county]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and later the leading [[province]] of the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (1581–1795). 
 
 Today, there is no [[country]] called  " Holland " . There are two provinces called  " Holland "  in the Netherlands: [[North Holland]] ({{lang-nl|Noord-Holland}}) and [[South Holland]] ({{lang-nl|Zuid-Holland}}). Those provinces were created in 1840. The earlier country and province of Holland used to be bigger, but some parts of that province were given to other provinces during the [[France|French]] occupation (1795-1813). For example, [[Willemstad]] became part of [[North Brabant]], the islands of [[Vlieland]] and [[Terschelling]] were given to [[Friesland]], and the island of [[Urk]] to [[Overijssel]]. But for a short time during that period (1806–1810), there ''was'' a country called  " Holland " , the [[Kingdom of Holland]], which was in the central and northern Netherlands and [[East Friesland]] in [[Germany]]. 
 
 Many people use the name  " Holland "  to refer to all of the Netherlands, including the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|other ten provinces]]. That is not correct and is like calling the [[United Kingdom]],  " [[England]] "  or  " [[Great Britain]] " . Some [[Dutch people]] who live outside  " Holland "  find it unacceptable to refer to the entire country Holland. But acceptable when you refer  " Holland "  to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].
