[[File:Gray1229.png|thumb|right|A schematic drawing of a hymen]] 
 The '''hymen''' (also called '''maidenhead''') is [[tissue]] that surrounds or partially covers the external [[vagina]]l opening. The hymen has no known use. People used to believe that the hymen always tears after having [[sexual intercourse]] for the first time, and that you could tell if a woman was a [[virgin]] by looking at her hymen and seeing if it was torn. However, it turns out that it is impossible to tell if someone is a virgin by looking at their hymen. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Medical/texts/Evaluation%20of%20the%20Sexually%20Abused%20Child%202nd%20ed%20-%20A.%20Heger%2C%20et%20al.%2C%20%28Oxford%2C%202000%29%20WW.pdf|title=Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195074253|editor-last=Heger|editor-first=Astrid H.|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=122|language=English|editor-last2=Emans|editor-first2=S.

 == Types == 
 There are several different types of hymen. In about 1 in 2,000 females, the hymen does not develop at all. < ref > {{cite book |editor=Kurman, Robert J. |title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract |edition=5th |year=2002 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |pages=160}} < /ref >  The hymen may also not have a hole in it; this is called an  " imperforate hymen " . In this case a hole will need to be [[Surgery|surgically]] cut into it to allow [[Menstruation|menstrual fluid]] (period blood) out. < ref > Chang, Lisbeth and Muram, David. (2002)  " Pediatric  &  Adolescent Gynecology "  in DeCherney, Alan H. and Nathan, Lauren. ''Current Obstetric  &  Gynecological Diagnosis  &  Treatment'', 9th edition, McGraw-Hill, 598-602. < /ref > 
 
 Other types are: 
 
 * [[crescent]]-shaped 
 * forming a ring around the vagina 
 * folding in on itself 
 * has one or more bands going across the opening 
 * has several holes 
 
 == What might damage the hymen == 
 When a girl reaches [[puberty]], the hymen becomes [[elastic|stretchy]]. The hymen may be damaged by girls fall directly onto sharp objects . < ref name= " Emans64-5 " > Emans, S. Jean.  " Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent "  (2000) in ''Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas'', Second edition, Oxford University Press. 64-5 < /ref >  Sexual intercourse is another easy way to damage the hymen along with horseback riding and biking. A woman's hymen can also break while playing some sports

 |} 
 There are many more animals which have hymens, but not all are listed here. 
 
 == The stages of growth == 
 When a [[fetus]] is developing, there is no vaginal opening. The hymen comes from the [[skin]] covering the vagina at that time. < ref > 1918 Gray's Anatomy < /ref > 
 
 In [[wikt:young|young]] babies, the hymen is thick and pink. This is because the mother is giving the baby [[hormone]]s through [[breast feeding]] which keeps it thick. In [[puberty|adolescent]] girls, the hymen becomes thin, smooth and delicate because she has stopped taking in hormones. The hymen becomes very [[nerve|sensitive]] and can easily cause [[pain]] if touched. From puberty, the hymen gets thicker again and becomes pale pink. This is because of the hormone [[estrogen]].
