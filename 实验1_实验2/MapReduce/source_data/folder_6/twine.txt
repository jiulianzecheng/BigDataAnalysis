 [[Archaeologists]] discovered flax fiber cords in a [[west]]ern [[Asia]]n [[cave]] that date from 32,000 to 26,000 years ago. < ref name=DN/ >  In a cave at [[Lascaux, France]] [[fossilized]] remains of a “two-ply laid rope of about 7 mm diameter” were dated to about 15,000 [[BCE]]. [[Hemp]] twine was used from about 8,000 BCE. By 1,000 BCE hemp rope and twine was used by most [[civilization]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.hemp-sisters.com/Information/history.htm |title=Hemp History |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Hemp Sisters |accessdate=20 June 2015 |archive-date=13 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213012910/http://www.hemp-sisters.com/Information/history.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  From 500 BCE to 1900 [[AD]] almost all rope and twine used in sailing ships was made from hemp.
