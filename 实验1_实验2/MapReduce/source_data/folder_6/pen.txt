 A '''pen''' ([[Latin]]: ''pinna'', feather) is a tool used for [[writing]] or [[drawing]]. The ink of the pen is pressed onto paper and dries very fast. 
 
 ''Reed pens'' are the oldest known type of pen. They were made from reeds growing in the delta of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians invented them, and also invented black ink, using soot and gum arabic. Their pens had split [[nib]]s to regulated the flow of ink to the writing tip. This simple design is still used in [[calligraphy]] today. < ref > Gaur, Albertine 1992. ''A history of writing''. Revised edition. The British Library.

 ''Quill pens'' are one of the oldest type of pens.  A quill pen is the [[feather]] of a [[bird]], usually a [[goose]].  The end of the feather (the quill) was kept very sharp and had to be dipped into ink after every few [[words]]. 
 
 Reed and quill pens are ''dip pens'' because they have to be dipped in ink many times during writing or [[drawing]]. Modern dip pens have nibs made of [[metal]]. 
 
 ''Fountain pens'' are like dip pens, but can hold enough ink inside to write several pages before being refilled. Inside, the ink is held in a [[sac]] or [[cartridge]].  
 
 A ''[[ballpoint pen]]'' is generally [[cylinder|cylindrical]] [[plastic]] shaft that holds ink and is smaller than a fountain pen. It has a small hard ball on the writing end that rolls the ink onto the paper. 
 
 A ''stylus'' is a pen that cannot write on paper, but can write on [[clay]] or [[wax]]. Styli of wood or metal have been used for thousands of years, for example in [[cuneiform]] writing. A modern computer stylus is usually made of plastic and may have [[electronics]] inside. It is used with a [[touchscreen]]. 
 
 The coming of the [[personal computer]] much reduced the need to write on paper. All the same, a personally written letter  [[non-verbal communication|suggests]]  " I think so much of you that I took the effort to write a ''real'' letter. "
