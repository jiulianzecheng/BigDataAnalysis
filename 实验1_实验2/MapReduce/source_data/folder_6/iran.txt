 == History == 
 {{main|History of Iran}} 
 In the past, Iran was called  " Persia "  by people outside of the [[country]]. The people that lived there called the country  " Iran " . The official name was Persia, The name Persia was used when dealing with other countries and in [[government]] papers. 
 
 In 1935, [[Reza Shāh Pahlavi]] was [[Shah]] of Iran. He officially asked foreigners to call the country  " Iran " . This was done to show that Iran belongs to all the non-Persian Iranians as well as to Persian Iranians. The name Iran means ''land of the [[Aryan]]s''. It is used in the ancient book of the [[Zoroastrian]]s, the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]]. In the 19th and early 20th century, the name ''Aryan'' was used by [[Europe]]ans to mean ''all [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]]s''.  The  " Aryan Race "  was a term that [[Adolph Hitler|Hitler]] used to describe his  " Superior "  or  " perfect "  race, but it first meant Iranians. < ref > Norton, 2002 < /ref >   " Aryan "  means  " noble "  in Iranian languages.

 After the Parthians, the Sassanian dynasty (224-651) took over. Other people took Persia by [[war|conquest]], like the [[Arab]]s (7th century), [[Turkic peoples|Turk]]s (10th century) and [[Mongols]] (13th century).  However, Iran has always had a different and distinct native Iranian [[culture]] which has continued to survive. 
 
 After the Muslim Arabs conquered the Iranians, Persian women were enslaved as domestic servants while Persian men were forced to build and farm and engage in hard labour. < ref > {{cite book |editor1-last=Fisher |editor1-first=William Bayne |editor2-last=Frye |editor2-first=Richard Nelson |editor3-last=Avery |editor3-first=Peter |editor4-last=Gershevitch |editor4-first=Ilya |editor5-last=Boyle |editor5-first=John Andrew |editor6-last=Yarshater |editor6-first=Ehsan |editor7-last=Jackson |editor7-first=Peter |title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4 |volume=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs |date=1975 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521200938 |page=29 |edition=illustrated, reprint, reissue |chapter=CHAPTER I THE ARAB CONQUEST OF IRAN AND ITS AFTERMATH |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC & dq=%22farming+and+building+and+the+women+for+domestic+service%22 & pg=PA29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221218025313/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC & dq=%22farming+and+building+and+the+women+for+domestic+service%22 & pg=PA29 |archive-date=2022-12-18 |access-date=2022-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref >  The Arab Abbasid Harun caliph had [[Persians|Persian]] concubines like Marajil al-Badghisiyya whom the later Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun descended from in the maternal line.  < ref > {{cite book |editor1-last=Fisher |editor1-first=William Bayne |editor2-last=Frye |editor2-first=Richard Nelson |editor3-last=Avery |editor3-first=Peter |editor4-last=Gershevitch |editor4-first=Ilya |editor5-last=Boyle |editor5-first=John Andrew |editor6-last=Yarshater |editor6-first=Ehsan |editor7-last=Jackson |editor7-first=Peter |title=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4 |volume=The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 4: From the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs |date=1975 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521200938 |page=94 |edition=illustrated, reprint, reissue |chapter=CHAPTER I THE ARAB CONQUEST OF IRAN AND ITS AFTERMATH |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC & dq=%22Persian+concubines%2C+and+his+known%22 & pg=PA94 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221218025251/https://books.google.com/books?id=hvx9jq_2L3EC & dq=%22Persian+concubines%2C+and+his+known%22 & pg=PA94 |archive-date=2022-12-18 |access-date=2022-02-22 |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news |title=Al-Ma'mun vs. Al-Amin Clash and Crumbling Power of Abbasids |url=https://saednews.com/en/post/al-mamun-vs-al-amin-clash-and-crumbling-power-of-abbasids |agency=SAED News |date=February 27, 2021 |access-date=June 17, 2021 |archive-date=June 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617013613/https://saednews.com/en/post/al-mamun-vs-al-amin-clash-and-crumbling-power-of-abbasids |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 === After World War II === 
 {{further|Islamic Revolution}} 
 The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) worked in Iran to create 1953 [[riot]]s which led to the removal of [[Prime Minister]] Mosaddegh. The [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] then made the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] the most powerful person in Iran, again. The Shah left Iran in 1979 in the face of a revolt. The Iranian [[government]] was changed to an [[Islamic Republic]] by [[Islamic Revolution]].  Soon afterwards, the [[Iranian Students Movement]] (Tahkim Vahdat), with the backing of the new [[government]], took over the [[U.S.]] [[Embassy]] in [[Tehran]]. They held most of the [[diplomat]]s [[hostage]] for 444 days. 
 
 Relations between the two countries have not been good since. For example, the [[United States]] claims that [[Iran]] supports [[terrorist]] [[group]]s against [[Israel]]. [[Iran]] does not see Israel as a country. Iran, along with many [[Arab League]] countries, believes that [[Israel]] does not have the [[Rights|right]] to co-exist. However, [[Iran]] has collaborated with the [[United Nations]] at times. These deals have been about energy or about fighting terrorism. 
 
 Iran fought the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the  1990s-1980s.  Many foreign countries supported [[Iraqi|Iraqi]] people’s regime. 
 
 Now, the [[Western world|West]] and [[United Nations]] is trying to prevent [[Iran]] from  becoming [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear technology]] country, even though Iran is a member of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA)’s has reported many times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in [[secret]]. 
 
 A December 2007 [[CIA]] report on nuclear activity in [[Iran]] said that Iran's [[secret]] program to get nuclear [[weapon]]s [[technology]] was stopped in 2003. It said that Iran will probably not be able to build a nuclear [[weapon]] soon. The [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] is a political strategy to deal with this issue. 
 
 == Economy == 
 Iran has the [[natural resource]] of [[Petroleum|oil]]. It is a member of OPEC. Oil is one of its main exports. [[Rice]], handicrafts, [[carpet]]s and [[crocus]] are important local products. Iran is the world's largest exporter and producer of [[caviar]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.russiran.com/en/iranian-products/foods/caviar.html|title=Caviar|publisher=Russia-Iran.com|accessdate=September 21, 2014|archive-date=April 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401114103/http://www.russiran.com/en/iranian-products/foods/caviar.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Iran is also one of the world's biggest exporters of pistachio nuts. 
 
 Iran has factories that produce industrial products. Iran is also involved in the field of biomedical sciences. 
 
 [[Rial]] is the [[money]] used in Iran. 
 
 == Religion in Iran == 
 
 About 90% of Iranian people are [[Muslim]]. The [[state religion]] is [[Shia Islam]].  It has been the state religion since the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century. < ref > {{cite book|author=Mark W. Janis, Carolyn Maree Evans|title=Religion and International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CxMFjU12OUC & pg=PA381|page=381|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1999|isbn=9789041111746|access-date=2022-02-22|archive-date=2022-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221218025316/https://books.google.com/books?id=8CxMFjU12OUC & pg=PA381|url-status=live}} < /ref >  This is the religion of about 75% of Iranians. < ref name= " cia " > {{cite web

The 9% of Iranians who are not Muslim are [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Mandaeism|Mandeans]], [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Christian]]s and [[Judaism|Jews]]. < ref name= " cia " / >  It is thought that there are between 300,000 and 310,000 Persian (Iranian) Jews.
