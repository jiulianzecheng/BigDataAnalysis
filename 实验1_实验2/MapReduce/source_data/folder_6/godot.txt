 == Scripting == 
 The default [[programming language]] in Godot is GDScript (which is Godot's own [[scripting language]]), but there is also a Mono edition with which [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] can be used. [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] can also be used with official GDNative bindings, but there are also third-party bindings available. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is GDNative?|url=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdnative/what_is_gdnative.html|access-date=2022-03-13|website=Godot Engine documentation|language=en|archive-date=2022-03-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324204429/https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdnative/what_is_gdnative.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  There are third-party bindings for [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], and [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], and some other programming languages.
