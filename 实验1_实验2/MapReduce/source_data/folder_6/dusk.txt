'''Dusk''' occurs at the darkest stage of [[twilight]], or at the very end of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] twilight after [[sunset]] and just before [[Night|nightfall]]. At [[predusk]], during early to intermediate stages of twilight, there is enough [[Unidentified flying object|light in the sky]] under clear conditions  to read outdoors without artificial [[Lighting|illumination]]; however, at the end of civil twilight (when [[Rotation of Earth|Earth rotates]] to a point at which the center of the [[Sun|Sun's]] disk is 6Â° below the local [[horizon]]), lighting is required to read outside.
