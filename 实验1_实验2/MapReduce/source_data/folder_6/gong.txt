 A '''gong''' is an East and Southeast [[Asian]] musical [[percussion instrument]]. It is a [[bowl]]-shaped, circular [[metal]] disc which a person hits with a [[mallet]] or thick padded stick.  
 
 Gongs produce two distinct types of sound. A gong with a flat surface gives a  " crash "  rather than a tuned note. In [[Indonesian]] [[gamelan]] ensembles, some gongs are made to give a beat note in the range from about 1 to 5 [[Hz]]. The use of the term  " gong "  for both these types of instrument is common.
