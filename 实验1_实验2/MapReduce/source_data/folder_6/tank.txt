 A '''tank''' is an armored fighting vehicle, typically armed with a large [[cannon]] mounted on a turret and a few machine guns. 
 
 A tank is covered in thick [[armour]] to protect it from enemy weapons. Tanks have tracks that wrap around its wheels to spread out its weight and let it cross rough terrain. Most tanks have a powerful gun and one or more [[machine gun]]s.  
 
 A tank normally has 3-5 [[crew]] members with at least a driver, commander and gunner.  There may also be a loader, who handles the [[ammunition]] for the main gun (so the gunner doesn't have to take eyes off the target).  Some [[World War II|WWII]] tanks also had a separate soldier responsible for the [[radio]].  Since then, tank crews have evolved to have each person do one of these things, but in their early stages, the commander was often the loader and radio operator, and in a few tanks was also the driver.

 The first tanks were made by the British [[Royal Navy]] and French car manufacturers during [[World War I]] as a way of attacking enemy [[trench]]es. They were called '''tanks''' to trick the Germans into thinking they were water carriers for the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]]. Their use in a surprise attack in the [[Battle of the Somme]] caused fear among the German soldiers but their small numbers and poor reliability prevented them from making much difference. 
 
 Tanks became a main weapon during [[World War II]], when the German Army introduced a way of using them called [[Blitzkrieg]].  Battles between great numbers of tanks were fought, especially between the Germans and the Soviet Union. The Battle of [[Kursk]] was the biggest. Well-known World War II tanks were the German [[Panzer]] IV, Panther and [[Tiger I]], Soviet T-34 (made in the largest numbers of any tank of the war and second most ever), the British Matilda, Churchill and Cromwell, and the American [[M4 sherman]] (second most produced tank of the war) and Stuart tanks.  There were plans for much larger and more heavily armoured tanks such as the [[Maus]] but they were determined to be of little use.  Their huge weight would have made moving them very difficult, and their huge size would have made them easy targets for heavy [[artillery]]. 
 
 Old tanks are often modified for other uses like carrying soldiers or equipment. [[Military engineering|Combat engineers]] use special tank-based vehicles, for example minesweeper tanks or bridge-layer tanks. 
 
 The tank is a major part of all large armies today. Tanks have replaced the [[cavalry]] everywhere and do the things that soldiers on horseback did in the past. Most modern tanks are of the heavy or [[Main Battle Tank]] type, able to fight other tanks. Compared to older types MBTs are very heavy (Russian MBTS being about 40 tons and Western around 60 tons) with a 120 & nbsp;mm (Western) and 125 & nbsp;mm (Russian) calibre cannon and 2-3 machine guns. [[Marine (military)|Marines]] and other specialized forces also use some light tanks.
