 A '''clock''' is a [[machine|device]] that tells the [[time]]. Some clocks can only show the time. Other clocks can show other things. For example, some clocks can show the [[date]] as well as the time, or show other information, like the [[timer]] 
 [[temperature]] or the [[weather]], some have stopwatch and some have alarm. 
 
 == Keeping time == 
 Clocks use different ways to measure time. Clocks need some sort of steady beat or [[motion]] to track the change in time. Ancient [[water clock]]s worked by the steady movement of [[water]] from a [[container]] with a hole in the bottom to another container without a hole. Other clocks use [[pendulum]]s, springs and gears to track the change in time correctly. 
 
 Digital clocks work by measuring the [[vibration]]s of [[quartz]] [[crystal]]s when [[Electric charge|charge]]d with [[electricity]]. The vibration [[frequency]] of the crystal does not change.  
 
 [[Atomic clock]]s use the [[electromagnetic wave]]s absorbed and emitted by atoms such as [[caesium]] to measure time. They are the most precise clocks in the world.watch image 
 
 == Clock displays == 
 The two most common types of [[display]]s on clocks are  " [[analog signal|analog]] "  and  " [[digital]] " .  
 
 === Analog clocks === 
 Analog clocks use [[angle]]s to tell time. They have ''hands'' that [[rotation|rotate]] around the clock's ''face'' (the front of the clock). The position of the hands shows the time. The face of the clock is a flat [[disk]]. It will often have the numbers one through twelve on the face to make it easier to read. Analog clocks commonly have two or three hands. If it has two, there is a large hand or ''[[minute]] hand'' and a smaller hand, the ''[[hour]] hand''. Clocks with three hands also have a ''[[second (time)|second]] hand''. This hand is usually about as long as the minute hand, but much thinner.  
 
 Each hand shows the time it is named for and moves around the face of the clock one complete rotation for each movement to the next larger hand. For example, the second hand moves around the face of the clock in 60 seconds. It moves once each second. When it moves all the way around the clock, the minute hand moves forward one space. When the minute hand moves all the way around the face of the clock (which takes 60 minutes), the hour hand moves forward one section. The second and minute hands take 60 movements to move all around the face of the clock. The hour hand only needs 12 movements to do the same. 
 
 === Digital clocks ===

 Digital clocks use [[number]]s to show the time. [[Liquid crystal display|LCDs]] and [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] are common for digital clocks. Unlike analog clocks which are based on 12 hours, digital clocks can use either a [[12-hour clock]] (often with ''am'' for morning and ''pm'' for afternoon/night) or a [[24-hour clock]]. Digital clocks are usually smaller and easier to both use and read than analog clocks but they can also be made much larger. New digital clocks can even correct themselves using the [[internet]] or [[radio]] [[signal]]s. 
 
 === Sounds === 
 There are also clocks that use sound, usually along with a dial or some other means, to show the time. The sound could be as simple as a [[bell]] or so complex that it sounds the same as a person. Many clocks that do this are old and are driven by [[Spring (device)|springs]] or [[weight]]s rather than [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] or other forms of [[electric power]]. Some special clocks are often used by people who are [[blind]] or cannot see well enough to read an analog or digital clock. They can also be used by people with [[mind|mental]] problems that cause them to be unable to read other clocks.

 == Types of clocks == 
 There are many different types of clocks and watches. They are different in what they are used for, what they can do or how they are made. Examples include: 
 
 * A [[wristwatch]], also called a watch, is worn on the wrist. It is held in place by two straps connected to the watch, and then wrapped around the wrist and connected to each other. 
 * A [[pocket watch]] is kept in a pocket. It usually has a small [[chain]]or a chain like cloth which is connected to the person's [[clothing]]. This helps people to not lose the watch. 
 * A [[sundial]] is an old form of a clock which uses the [[Sun]] to tell time. 
 * An [[alarm clock]] is a clock that makes a [[sound]] (often a ''buzzing'' or a [[bell]]-like sound) or plays [[music]] at a certain time. It is used by people to wake up from [[sleep]] at a time they choose. 
 * A [[grandfather clock]] is a tall clock that stands on a floor. It uses a [[pendulum]] to tell time. 
 * A [[cuckoo clock]] is a pendulum based clock which makes a sound each hour on the hour. They often also have a small door. When the clock makes the sound, the door opens and a small [[toy]] [[bird]] or other item usually comes out of the door. 
 * An [[hourglass]], also called a sandglass or sand timer, uses [[sand]] trickling slowly to measure time.
