A '''stapler''' is an [[office]] [[tool]] that is used to place thin [[item]]s such as [[paper]] together. It uses a small piece of wire (a [[staple (fastener)|staple]]) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the [[paper]]. There is also a [[chain store|chain]] of stores called ''Staples'', which sell office [[supply|supplies]]. 
 
 When you press the stapler down, it will release a staple. The staple is pressed into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together.
