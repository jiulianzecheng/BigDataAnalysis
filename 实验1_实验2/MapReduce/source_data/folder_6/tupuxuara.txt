 '''''Tupuxuara''''' was a [[pterosaur]] that lived 112 [[million]] [[year]]s ago. It was found in the [[Santana Formation]], the remains of an inland sea.  
 
 Some species were quite small, but the largest skull (length 130 cms) suggests a wingspan of 5.5 metres. It was an Azdarchid pterosaur, the same group as  ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]''.
