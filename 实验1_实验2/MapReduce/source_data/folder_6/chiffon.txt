 '''Chiffon''' is a lightweight, plain-woven sheer [[fabric]]. The fabric is woven of S and Z twist crepe [[yarn]]s. The twist in the crepe yarns puckers the fabric in both directions.  
 
 Chiffon is made from [[cotton]], [[silk]] or synthetic fibers. 
 
 [[Gown]]s, [[lingerie]], [[scarf|scarves]] and other clothing can be made of chiffon.
