[[File:Wing profile nomenclature.svg|thumb|400px|Wing profile vocabulary]] 
 An '''airfoil''' (in [[American English]], or '''aerofoil''' in [[British English]]) is the shape of a [[wing]], or blade of a [[propeller]], the blade of a ship's [[screw]] or the shape of a [[sail]] as seen in cross-section. When moving through a [[fluid]] it will provide [[lift (force)|lift]] and drag. Lift is not only up, it may be in other directions depending on what it is used for. The airfoil has a rounded leading edge (front edge of the wing) to make the airfoil more insensitive to the angle of attack.
