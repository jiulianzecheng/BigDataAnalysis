 == History == 
 The Rottweiler is one of the oldest of herding breeds. < ref > Manfred Schanzle, ''Studies in The Breed History of The Rottweiler''. DVM thesis, University of Munich, 1969. < /ref >  With a history possibly dating back to the [[Roman Empire]], < ref name='AKC Book' > {{cite book | last1 = American Kennel Club | title = The Complete Dog Book | volume = 3 | edition = 20 | publisher = Ballantine Books | year = 2006 | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NqXaduT6Ak0C & dq=rottweiler+roman & pg=PT15 | accessdate = 2012-03-13 | isbn = 978-0-307-41699-5 | quote = The origin of the Rottweiler is not a documented record. Once this is recognized, actual history tempered by reasonable supposition indicates the likelihood he is descended from one of the drover dogs indigenous to ancient Rome.}} < /ref >  the Rottweiler may be a descendant of ancient Roman drover dogs; a mastiff-type dog that was a dependable, rugged dog with great intelligence and guarding instincts. 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 Dogs are [[Pack hunter|pack animal]]s. When they feel [[wikt:threaten|threaten]]ed, they will [[wikt:defend|defend]] themselves. They will also [[wikt:protect|protect]] other members of the [[wikt:pack|pack]] to a certain extent. How they defend themselves, and how close they feel to the rest of the pack (their owners) depends on the dog's [[wikt:nature|nature]]. It also depends on how they were [[wikt:raise|raise]]d. Since dogs judge [[wikt:dangerous|dangerous]] [[wikt:situation|situation]]s differently, they should not be left unattended near a place where people are arguing. They may also judge ''un[[wikt:attend|attend]]ed'' moves of a child as an attack. Therefore, dogs should not be left alone near children. 
 
 == Size == 
 There is no specific weight for a Rottweiler to qualify to be judged in dog shows. The dog must be neither too thin or too fat for its size. Both males and females must be  " medium-large "  in size for the American Kennel Club. < ref name=akc > {{cite web|title=Rottweiler Official Breed Standard|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/rottweiler/breed_standard.cfm|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=15 November 2014|archive-date=12 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112210348/http://www.akc.org/breeds/rottweiler/breed_standard.cfm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The General German Rottweiler Club (ADRK) lists 50 kilograms (110 pounds) for males and 42 kilograms (93 pounds) for females . < ref name=adrk > {{cite web|title=Rottweiler - Breed standard|url=http://www.adrk.de/5_standard_e.htm|publisher=ADRK: General German Rottweiler Club|accessdate=15 November 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 == Considerations == 
 When the Rottweilers' owners are not experienced, problems arise. Sometimes humans, mostly children, are attacked by these dogs. The attacks are often a result of irresponsible owners. Rottweilers are very intelligent and need equally smart handlers to raise them. 
 
 In some areas, breeding certain dogs has been restricted or forbidden. < ref > {{cite news
