 '''Housecleaning''' is what people do to remove mess, trash, and [[dirt]] from where they live and put things where they belong so the house looks neat. < ref name= " Gove P. B. and others. 1961 " > Gove P.B. and others. 1961. < /ref > 
 
 Housecleaning makes it easier to see the floor and [[furniture]] without clutter in the way. It also leaves fewer places for [[spider]]s and [[insect]]s to live and removes [[dust]] so that people in the house can [[breathe]] more easily. Housecleaning may be [[broom|sweep]]ing the floor with a broom, cleaning rugs with a [[vacuum cleaner]], [[laundry|cleaning clothes]] and putting them away, and washing [[window]]s. Washing a [[sponge]], squeezing out the water, and placing it on a dish rack to dry is also part of housecleaning. < ref > Bredenberg, Jeff, cover  &  pp. xv – xvi. < /ref > 
 
 == Clutter == 
 Clutter is things that either should not be in the house at all or have been put in the wrong place.  A teacup in the middle of the floor is clutter.  A teacup on its shelf is not clutter.  Places people put things away on shelves, in drawers, and on hangers. < ref > Bredenberg, Jeff, pp. 21 – 27 < /ref > 
 
 == Health == 
 Cleaning the house removes [[germ]]s, dust and other things that can harm health. < ref > Bredenberg, Jeff, pp. 28 – 33 < /ref >  Dust can make people sneeze, cough, and get watery eyes. Dust can give people rashes and trouble breathing. Dust can come from smoke, cotton, small bits of soap, pollen, mold spores, dried cat saliva, pieces of spider web, skin flakes, cloth fibers, insect fibers, or tiny bits of food. < ref > Bredenberg, Jeff, pp. 36 – 39 < /ref > 
 
 == Cleaning chemicals == 
 There are five main kinds of chemicals that people use for housecleaning: < ref > Bredenberg, Jeff, pp. 443 – 450 < /ref > 
 # Surfactants help water get things wet faster.  
 # [[Alkaline]] chemicals like soap and baking soda can make mud and grease easier to wash away. 
 # [[Acidic]] chemicals like vinegar, lemon juice and orange juice can make mustard, wine, tea, coffee, rust, dry soap suds, and [[limescale]] easier to wash away. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Joa|first=Kate|title=Ultimate Home Cleaning Guide 2023: Tips  &  Tricks|url=https://cleaningsage.com/posts/ultimate-home-cleaning-guide/|access-date=2023-12-01|website=cleaningsage.com|language=en}} < /ref >
