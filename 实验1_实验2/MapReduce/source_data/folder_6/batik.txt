 [[File:Batik Trusmi Cirebon (23).jpg|thumb|300px|Batik — Indonesian textile originated from [[Java island|Java]]]] ''' Batik ''' is an [[Indonesia]]n method of [[dye]]ing [[cloth]] and making it resistant using [[wax]]. Such [[fabric]]s originally come from the island of [[Java island|Java]]. Nowadays, batik also can be found worldwide, mainly in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. 
 
 == History of batik == 
 [[File:Dewi Sri Java Bronze.jpg|175px|thumb]][[File:Batik pattern - kawung.jpg|175px|thumb|The ancient bronze statue of ''Dewi Sri Jawa'' — the goddesses of fertility in Javanese culture depicted wearing batik sarong with the ''kawung'' motif (one of the ancient batik motifs)]] 
 Batik is an ancient fabric wax-resist dyeing tradition of [[Java island]] (nowadays part of modern [[Indonesia]]). < ref > {{cite web | title=What is Batik? | url=https://www.batikguild.org.uk/batik/what-is-batik | publisher=The Batik Guild | access-date=27 November 2020}} < /ref >  In the [[Ramayana]]—ancient [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] epics dated 500 [[BC]]—, the island of [[Java island|Java]] is recorded as the island that already had seven kingdoms long before the story of Ramayana created, and Batik is one of the regarded clothes that have glorious value that originally made by the manufacturers within the kingdoms' environment itself. < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ic4BjWFmNIC & dq=Yawadvipa+is+mentioned+in+India%27s+earliest+epic%2C+the+Ramayana & pg=PA465 History of Ancient India Kapur, Kamlesh] < /ref >  Batik is a part of an ancient [[Javanese]] tradition and has been taught for centuries, the art of batik is most highly developed in Java and some of the best batiks in the world still made there until today. < ref name= " BGJava " > {{cite web | title=Batik in Java | url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyJava.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild | access-date=29 April 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 Due to the [[colonialism]], batik also became popular in the Western countries,   especially since the Dutch colonial era. < ref > Raffles, Thomas E.:  "  The History of Java " < /ref >

 ==Technique== 
 [[File:Batik 1.jpg|thumb|This picture shows the person is drawing a batik with tjanting.]] 
 To make a batik, they use the cloth as the [[paper]], and they just start drawing hot wax over the cloth. And they said if we repeated the process, it will be more colorful. For the first step, make sure the cloth is washed. Batik < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.dharmatrading.com/techniques/batik-instructions.html|title=Batik Technique|publisher=Dharma Trading|access-date=2016-06-01}} < /ref >  patterns are drawn with [[pencil]] and later drawn again using a hot wax. The very common thing that people use is the pen-like instrument called a tjanting. After the cloth is dry, the areas keep their original color, and it also shows the pattern between the areas that have the [[color]] and do not have the color. It gives them a [[pattern]]. Then the artist repeats the process once for each color. A very [[traditional]] type of batik, called written batik, is drawn using only a tjanting. The cloth needs to be drawn on both sides and put in a color [[bath]] three or four times. The process may take up to a year.
