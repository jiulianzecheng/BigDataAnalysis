 The '''dugong''' (''Dugong dugon'') is a large [[mammal]] that lives its whole life in the sea. < ref name= " ehwa " > {{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/dugongs/index.html|title=Dugongs|work=Department of Environment, Heritage, Water and the Arts|publisher=Australian Government|access-date=2010-02-07}} < /ref >   
 
 They are sometimes called  " sea cows "  as they eat large amounts of sea grass. They live in warm, [[wikt:shallow|shallow]] areas where the sea grass grows. This area includes the north coast of [[Australia]], and in other countries in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. < ref name=ehwa/ >   
 
 Dugongs are more closely related to [[elephant]]s than to other sea creatures. < ref name=bio/ >  Their closest aquatic relative is the [[manatee]], a fresh water species found in America and West Africa. < ref name= " am " > {{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Dugong|title=Dugong|publisher=Australian Museum|language=en|access-date=2010-02-07}} < /ref > < ref name=bio/ > 
 
 The dugong can grow to about {{convert|3|m|ft|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} long and weigh as much as {{convert|400|kg|lb|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref name=ehwa/ >  They only come to the surface to breathe, and unlike seals, they never come up on the land. < ref name=ehwa/ >  A baby dugong is called a calf. It drinks milk from its mother until about two years old. A dugong reaches its adult size between the ages of 9 and 17 years. < ref name=ehwa/ >  The dugong can live for up to 70 years of age. < ref name= " bio " > {{cite web|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/dugongs/dugong_biology_and_life_history|title=Dugong Biology and Life History|work=Dugong|publisher=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|language=en|access-date=2010-02-07|archive-date=2010-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501010933/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/dugongs/dugong_biology_and_life_history|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They are [[grey ]]to [[brown]] in color. They have a tail with [[fluke]]s, like a whale, and flippers. They do not have a [[dorsal]] fin like a shark. They have a wide flat nose, small eyes, and small ears. < ref name=am/ > 
 
 The dugong is a [[migration|migratory]] animal, but very slow moving. Studies by [[James Cook University]] showed that while many dugongs traveled less than {{convert|15|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}, some went as far as {{convert|560|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " dm " > {{cite web|url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/dugongs/dugong_movements|title=Dugong Movements|publisher=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority|language=en|access-date=2010-02-07|archive-date=2010-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501011500/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/corp_site/key_issues/conservation/natural_values/dugongs/dugong_movements|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Scientists believe that dugongs move long distances for several reasons. They may be looking for food, as cyclones or floods can affect the seagrass. Males may be following females, or looking for their own territory. If the water gets cold, less than 17 degrees Centigrade, they will travel to warmer areas. < ref name=dm/ >   
 
 Because of their size, the only other species to attack dugongs are [[shark]]s, the [[Saltwater Crocodile]] and [[killer whale]]s.
