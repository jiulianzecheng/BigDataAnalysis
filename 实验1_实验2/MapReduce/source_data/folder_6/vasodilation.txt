 '''Vasodilation''' is where [[blood vessels]] widen. < ref > {{cite web| title = Definition of Vasodilation| publisher = MedicineNet.com| date = 27 April 2011| url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5965| accessdate = 13 January 2012| archive-date = 5 January 2012| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120105174629/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=5965| url-status = dead}} < /ref >  It results from relaxation of [[muscle]] cells within blood vessel walls. The process is essentially the opposite of [[vasoconstriction]], which is  the narrowing of blood vessels.  
 
 When vessels widen, blood flow is increased. This in turn decreases [[blood pressure]]. Drugs that cause vasodilation are called '''vasodilators'''.
