 An '''emerald''' is a [[mineral]] [[gemstone]] and a variety of [[beryl]]. It is the birthstone of someone whose birthday is in the month of [[May]]. It is a [[green]] crystal. The emerald is one of the most valuable [[gem]]s, along with the [[ruby]], the [[opal]], [[topaz]], the [[diamond]], and a [[sapphire]]. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 The word ''emerald'' comes from [[Vulgar Latin]]. The word was Esmaralda/Esmaraldus, a different way of saying the Latin word ''Smaragdus'', which came from the [[Greek language|Greek]], {{lang|el|σμάραγδος}} (''smaragdos'';  " green gem " ). < ref name=Fernie/ > < ref name=etymology > {{Cite web

 }} < /ref >  It first came from a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word, ''izmargad'' ({{lang|he|אזמרגד}}). This meant  " emerald "  or  " green " . < ref name=Fernie > {{cite book | last = Fernie M.D.  | first = W.T. | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | publisher = John Wright.  &  Co. | year = 1906}} < /ref >  The name could also be related to the Semitic word baraq (בָּרָק ;البُراق;  " lightning "  or  " shine " ) (c.f. {{lang-he|ברקת}} ''bareqeth'' and {{lang-ar|برق}}, ''barq'',  " lightning " ). It is where the [[Persian language|Persian]] ({{lang|fa|زمرّد}} ''zomorrod''), [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ({{lang|tr|zümrüt}}), Sanskrit ({{lang|sa|मरग्दम्}} ''maragdam'') and [[Russian language|Russian]] ({{lang|ru|изумруд}}; ''izumrúd'') words came from. < ref name=etymology/ >
