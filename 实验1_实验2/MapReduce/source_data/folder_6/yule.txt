 '''Yuletide''' is a [[pagan]] [[holiday]] also known as the [[Winter solstice]]. Generally celebrated by [[Wicca]]ns and [[North]]ern [[Europe]]an [[Christian]]s.  " Yuletide "  celebrates the birth of the [[Sun]] and also celebrates the  " Mother "  at the height of her  " Greatness " .   
 [[Pagans]] celebrate Yuletide in many ways, most will decorate a  " Yuletide "  tree, keep it in their homes until most of the leaves fall off then burn the Yule log. Many [[Wiccans]] will decorate their alters with Yule colours and items and generally just honour the [[Goddess]].

 The Christian holiday, [[Christmas]], was created by the Christian [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] based around the [[polytheist]]ic (many Gods) [[Sun]] [[God]] [[festival]] (Sol Invictis) on the winter solstice, and people in northern Europe combined it with their Yule festival.  Yule is celebrated on the 25th of [[December]] by most Northern Europeans and the 21st of December, by Wiccans and many [[secularism|non religious]] groups. For them, Yule is celebrated as the longest night of the year. It is the night when the [[sunset|sun set]]s earliest and rises latest the next day. The Wiccan [[ritual]] includes thanking the [[Goddess]] for the past year and asking for a happiness in the year to come.
