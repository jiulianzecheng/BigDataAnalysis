 An '''autogyro''', also known as a '''gyroplane''', is a type of [[rotorcraft]] that uses an unpowered rotor to fly. The autogyro's rotor must have air flowing across the rotor disc to create rotation, and the air flows upwards through the rotor disc and not down. Only one or two people can be on an autogyro. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/147 147]}} < /ref > 
 
 The autogyro was invented by Spanish engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds. He first flew one on 9 & nbsp;January 1923 in [[Madrid]]. < ref name= " greg " > {{cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avheli_1.html#m4 |title=European Helicopter Pioneers|work=Air Vectors |last=Goebel |first=Greg |date=1 Jun 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205181430/http://www.vectorsite.net/avheli_1.html#m4 |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=usurped}} < /ref >  Cierva's autogyro is thought to be the predecessor of the modern [[helicopter]]. < ref > {{cite book|author=George Galdorisi|title=Leave No Man Behind: The Saga of Combat Search and Rescue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3HGfuFILuoC|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-2392-2|year=2008}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|author=Trevor Homer|title=The Book of Origins: The first of everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-eTGAAACAAJ|publisher=Hachette Digital|isbn=978-1-405-51610-5|year=2007}} < /ref >
