 '''Carthage''' was an ancient [[city-state]] in what is now [[Tunisia]].  It began as a [[Phoenicia]]n [[colony]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=ddl |title=History of Carthage |author= |website= |publisher=HistoryWorld |accessdate=8 January 2016 |archive-date=1 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101030758/http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=ddl |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  At the height of its power, Carthage was the most important power in the [[Mediterranean]] and controlled parts of Spain, as well as [[Sicily]], [[North Africa]], and [[Sardinia]].  
 
 The [[Roman Republic]] destroyed Carthage during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. In later centuries, Rome started a [[colony]] in the same place that became an important city of [[Africa Province]]. Eventually, the [[Vandals]] conquered the city and used it to attack [[Rome]].

 Carthage was a rival in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] for the [[Roman Republic]], < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/carthage.html |title=Carthage |author= |website= |publisher=Roman-empire.net |accessdate=8 January 2016 |archive-date=22 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822201345/http://www.roman-empire.net/republic/carthage.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  which wanted to take over the whole region. Carthage was a large obstacle and so in 264 BC, the Romans responded to a plea for help by some rebels in [[Messina]] and landed an army in [[Sicily]]. That started the [[First Punic War]]. The Romans then invaded the Carthaginian areas in Sicily, and the Carthaginian generals could not stop them. Even at sea, the Romans copied the Carthaginian bireme ships, with two oars on each side, and won several major victories on the sea. However, the Romans had not been a sea power, which the Carthaginians had been.   
 
 Finally, a general, [[Hamilcar Barca]], took up to defend the Carthaginians and replaced of the older and less energetic Hanno. Hamilcar immediately realized the futility of meeting the superior [[Roman army]] in open battle and so he decided to use hit-and-run raids to wear down the Romans. That tactic was slightly more effective against the slow heavily-armored roman troops. Eventually, however, the Romans took Lilybaeum, the Carthaginians' main stronghold in Sicily. That ended Carthage's power in Sicily and ended the First Punic War. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/carthage/ |title=Carthage |author= |website= |publisher=Livius.org |accessdate=8 January 2016}} < /ref >   
 
 During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Hannibal Barca]] led the Carthaginian Army through Spain, southern [[Gaul]] and across the [[Alps]] into [[Italy]] in 218 BC. < ref name=HistAE > {{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/punic-wars |title=Punic Wars |author= |website= |publisher=History/A & E Television Networks, LLC |accessdate=8 January 2016}} < /ref >  There, he clashed with and stunningly defeated the Romans in three major battles: the Battle of the River Trebia, the Battle of Lake Trasmine, and the [[Battle of Cannae]]. < ref name=HistAE/ >  He failed, however, to take Rome and eventually had to [[retreat]] to Carthage, where he was defeated by Scipio Africanis at the Battle of Zama. < ref name=HistAE/ > 
 
 The [[Roman Republic|Romans]] destroyed Carthage in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. The Carthaginians who survived, numbering about 50,000, were mostly sold into [[slavery]]. < ref name= " HistAE "  / >
