 A Battalion is a Military Unit. It is composed of around 500-1500 men. It is often made up of two to seven companies and is under the command of a Lieutenant Colonel or another officer. More than one Battalion often makes up a regiment or a brigade. In the United States Army,Battalions are made up of a Headquarters Company (Or Headquarters Troops for Cavalry Squadrons and Headquarters Batteries for Artillery Battalions) and several support Companies (Or Support Troops/Support Batteries). In a United States Marine Corps Battalion there is a Headquarters and Service Company and several Support Companies assigned to it.
