 A paragraph is a collection of words strung together to make a longer unit than a [[sentence]]. Several sentences often make a paragraph. There are normally three to eight sentences in a paragraph. Paragraphs can start with a five-space indentation or by skipping a line and then starting over. This makes it simpler to tell when one paragraph ends and the next starts simply it has 3-9 lines. 
 
 A topic phrase appears in most ordered types of writing, such as [[Essay|essays]]. This paragraph's topic sentence informs the reader about the topic of the paragraph. In most essays, numerous paragraphs make statements to support a thesis statement, which is the essay's fundamental point. 
 
 Paragraphs may signal when the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may have a number of sentences, depending on the topic. 
 
 A [[pilcrow]] mark (Â¶) is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins.
