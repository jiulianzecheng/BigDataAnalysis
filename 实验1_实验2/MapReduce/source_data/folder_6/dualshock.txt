 The '''DualShock''' is a [[video game]] controller made by [[Sony]] for the [[PlayStation]] line of game consoles. It was first released in [[Japan]] in 1997, and was later released in [[North America]] in 1998. It is a vibration-feedback controller, meaning that it shakes in appropriate situations during a game. The name comes from the fact that it has two vibration motors. The motors are in the handles of the controller.
