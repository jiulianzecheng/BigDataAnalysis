A '''dome''' is a [[building]] or [[roof]] that usually looks like the upper half of a [[sphere]]. 
 
 As a roof feature, domes make many [[religion|religious]] and [[government]] buildings stand out, because if someone is speaking to others inside or under a dome, the voice sounds louder. Also a dome makes it easier to [[identify]] an important building, for example a [[temple]] or a [[palace]].  
 
 
 A large [[stadium]] with a roof over the playing field is often called a  " dome " . One example of that usage is the [[Metrodome]].
