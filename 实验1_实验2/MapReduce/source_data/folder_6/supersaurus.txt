 '''''Supersaurus''''' was a [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]], a relative of ''[[Diplodocus]]''. It was found in the [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] of [[Colorado]] in 1972. < ref name= " foster-appendix " > Foster J. 2007.

 In most respects, ''Supersaurus'' is similar in to ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', but it is less robustly built. It has elongated [[cervical vertebra]]e, resulting in one of the longest known sauropod necks. < ref > ''[[Amphicoelias]]'' was longer. < /ref >  It was up to 33 to 34 & nbsp;meters (108 to 112 & nbsp;ft) in length, and a weight of 35 to 40 & nbsp;tons. < ref >  Lovelace, David M; Hartman, Scott A.  &  Wahl, William R. 2007.

 A new and much more complete specimen of ''Supersaurus'', nicknamed 'Jimbo', WDC DMJ-021, was found in Converse County, [[Wyoming]] in 1996. It is currently being prepared and was described in 2007. Its bones are held at the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]].
