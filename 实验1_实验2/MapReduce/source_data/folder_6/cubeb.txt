 In [[Europe]], cubeb was one of the [[wikt:valuable|valuable]] [[spice]]s during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was used in [[sauce]]s. An old recipe includes cubeb in making ''[[sauce]] sarcenes'', which consists of [[almond]] [[milk]] and a few [[spice]]s. < ref name= " Hieatt_1 " > {{Harv|Hieatt|1988}}  " Make a thykke mylke of almondys, do hit in a pot with floure of rys, safron, gynger, macys, '''''quibibis''''', canel, sygure: and rynse the bottom of the disch with fat broth. Boyle the sewe byfore, and messe hit forth. " < /ref >  As a good-[[Odor|smelling]] [[snack]], cubeb was often [[candy|candied]] and eaten. < ref > Candied cubeb is mentioned in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', set in the 1940s:  " Under its tamarind glaze, the [[Mills bomb]] turns out to be luscious pepsin-flavored nougat, chock-full of tangy candied cubeb berries, and a chewy camphor-gum center. It is unspeakably awful. Slothrop's head begins to reel with camphor fumes, his eyes are running, his tongue's a hopeless holocaust. Cubeb? He used to ''smoke'' that stuff. "  {{Harv|Pynchon|1973|p=118}} < /ref >
