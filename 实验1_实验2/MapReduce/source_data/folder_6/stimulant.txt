A '''stimulant''' is any of a group of [[drug]]s that can increase alertness and awareness, usually for a short time only. Most stimulants have more [[side-effect]]s than other drugs. Some are classified as [[illegal drugs]], most can cause [[addiction]]. For this reason, most legal stimulants are only available on [[prescription]]. Stimulants act on the [[nerve]]s: Stimulants cause more [[neurotransmitters]] to the synapse (this is the gap between different nerves) 
 
 Most stimulants fall into one of the following groups: 
 * [[Amphetamine]] and its derivates: [[Methylphenidate]], [[Methamphetamine]], [[Pseudoephedrine]] [[Ephedrine]], [[MDMA|Ecstasy]] 
 * [[Xanthine]]s: [[Caffeine]], [[Theophylline]], [[Theobromine]] 
 * [[Piperazine]] and its derivates: [[Benzylpiperazine]], [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine]] 
 * Various others: [[Cocaine]], [[Nicotine]], [[Modafinil]] 
 
 Some of the substances mentioned above can be used to treat certain diseases. Some are mostly used as illegal drugs.
