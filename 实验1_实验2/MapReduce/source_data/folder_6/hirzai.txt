 The '''Hirzai''' or '''Nukra horse''' is a rare breed of riding horse originating from Pakistan. These horses are of Arab origin, during the Umayyad Caliphate Dynasty; and have ample resemblance to Balochis. Home tract lies in [[Balochistan]] province. Their size is intermediate between those of a horse and a pony. Thoroughbred stallions provided by the [[Government of Balochistan|Balochistan Government]] at important centres such as [[Quetta]] and [[Sibi]] are instrumental in large scale crossbreeding with native mares. The objective is to improve the native stock, however, this policy has led to the deterioration of native breeds purity. Good specimens of Balochi and '''Hirzai breeds''' are available at Sibi and Nasirabad Horse shows. Certain measures are currently being taken by the [[Pakistan|Pakistani state]] to protect and propagate this rare horse breed. They are a light riding horse developed by the Department of [[Agriculture in Pakistan]]. Offspring of the original two were then crossed with lighter desert breeds. 
 
 Currently measures are being taken by the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]] to protect and further this rare horse breed. The majority of the animals that exist today are kept at the royal stables of Khan of Kalat.
