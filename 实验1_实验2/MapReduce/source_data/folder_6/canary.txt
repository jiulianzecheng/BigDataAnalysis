 The '''canary''' (''Serinus canaria''), also called the '''island canary''', '''Atlantic canary''' or '''common canary''', is a small [[passerine]] [[bird]]. It belongs to the genus ''[[Serinus]]'' in the [[finch]] family. It is native to the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Azores]], and [[Madeira]]. Wild birds are mostly yellow-green, with brownish streaking on the back. The species is common in captivity. Different colour varieties have been bred. Canaries are domestic birds. They are popular pets.  
 
 Nesting 
 Canary nests are small and cup-shaped, and the birds build them several feet off the ground in a shrub or a tree. Both members of the pair build the nest, usually with a variety of twigs, sticks, grasses, and more. Females lay an average of three or four eggs per [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]].
