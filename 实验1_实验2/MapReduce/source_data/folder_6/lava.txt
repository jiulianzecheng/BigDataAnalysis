 {{wiktionary}} 
 '''Lava''' is [[magma]], hot molten rock that [[flow]]s through holes in the [[Earth's crust]] and onto the [[surface]]. Like [[magma]], lava can be either [[viscosity|viscous]] (~thick) or fluid (~thin). < ref name=camilla > {{cite book | title = Earth Science| url = https://archive.org/details/holtsciencetechn00na_0| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Austin, Texas| date = 2001| isbn = 0-03-055667-8}} < /ref >  Blocky lava is so thick and slow that it barely moves along the ground. Other types of lava, like ''pahoehoe'', ''aa'', and ''pillow lava'', are thinner and flow faster. < ref name=camilla/ >  Lava sometimes sets things on fire. Sometimes it even destroys towns. 
 
 == Types of lava == 
 === Blocky lava === 
 ''Blocky lava'' is cool, stiff lava that cannot travel far from where it was erupted. Blocky lava usually [[wikt:ooze|oozes]] out from a [[volcano]] only after an explosion has let out lots of the gas pressure from the place where there is magma. Blocky lava makes [[wikt:jumble|jumbled]] piles of sharp chunks. 
 
 === Pahoehoe === 
 Pronounced ''pah HOY HOY'', < ref name=camilla/ >  ''pahoehoe'' gets its name from the Hawaiian word for  " ropy "  because its surface looks like [[wikt:coil|coils]] of rope. Pahoehoe lava flows slowly, like wax dripping down from a [[candle]], making a glassy surface with round wrinkles. < ref name=camilla/ > 
 
 === Aa === 
 ''Aa'' is a [[Hawaii]]an word that is pronounced ''AH-AH''. This lava that has a sharp, [[wikt:jagged|jagged]] surface. < ref name=camilla/ >  This stiff lava pours out quickly and makes a crust that breaks easily. The crust is torn into sharp pieces as the hot lava underneath still moves. 
 
 === Pillow lava === 
 Pillow lava is made when lava erupts underwater. It makes round lumps that are the size and shape of [[pillow]]s. < ref name=camilla/ >  Pillow lava has a round shape because the lava cools very quickly when it touches water. < ref name=camilla/ > 
 
 They occur wherever [[mafic]] or intermediate lavas push out under water. This happens along marine [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] [[volcano]] chains and the [[Divergent boundary|constructive plate boundaries]] of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. Pillow lavas occur in the oldest preserved volcanic sequences on earth, the [[Isua greenstone belt|Isua]] and [[Barberton belt|Barberton]] [[greenstone belt]]s. This shows that large bodies of water were on the Earth's surface early in the [[Archaean]]. Pillow lavas are used generally to show volcanism occurred underwater in [[metamorphism|metamorphic]] belts. Pillow lavas are also found where [[volcano]]es were under [[ice]] early before an eruption. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www2.norvol.hi.is/Apps/WebObjects/HI.woa/1/swdocument/1006551/Introduction+to+Geology+and+geodynamics+of+Iceland+-+Reidar+Tr%C5%A1nnes.pdf |title=Introduction to geology and geodynamics of Iceland, R.G.

 == Lava tube == 
 A lava tube is a natural channel formed in flowing lava. The lava continues flowing under the tube's upper surface. Later, when the lava is cooled and solid, the tube remains as a feature in the [[landscape]].
