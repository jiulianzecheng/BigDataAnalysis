 It was first discovered in 2000 by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia. Its name was originally  " Ununhexium "  (Uuh) as a placeholder name meaning  "  one-one-six-ium "  in Latin, but it changed on May 30st, 2012, when the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] changed it. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Element 114 is Named Flerovium and Element 116 is Named Livermorium |url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/element-114-is-named-flerovium-and-element-116-is-named-livermorium.html |access-date=2012-06-07 |archive-date=2012-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602010328/http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/element-114-is-named-flerovium-and-element-116-is-named-livermorium.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
