 Notostracans, or '''tadpole shrimps''', are [[omnivore]]s living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes. They live in pools of [[water]] on every [[continent]] except [[Antarctica]]. They grow very quickly, and can reach adulthood in a week. ''Triops'' only live for a short time; a record-breaking female only lived to be 100 ''days''. When their pools dry up,adult tadpole shrimp die. Their [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], however, stop developing for a time. When they are in water again, they come to life, and new ''Triops'' are hatched. This is because of a state known as diapause, where eggs can lie dormant for up to twenty years before hatching again. 
 
 ==Evolution and fossil record== 
 The [[fossil]] record of Notostraca is extensive. They occur in a wide range of geological deposits, reaching back to the [[Carboniferous]]. < ref > {{cite book |author=Atte Korhola  &  Milla Rautio |year=2001 |chapter=Cladocera and other branchiopod crustaceans |pages=5–41 |editor=John P.

 The Notostraca abandoned [[filter feeder|filter feeding]] in open water, and took up a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters, taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals. < ref name= " Ax " > {{cite book |author=Peter Ax |year=2000 |title=Multicellular animals.

 Notostracans keep the ancient condition of having two separate [[compound eye]]s. These touch but do not become united, as does happens in other groups of Branchiopods. < ref name= " Ax " / >
