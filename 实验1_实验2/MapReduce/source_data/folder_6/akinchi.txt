 '''''Akinchi''''', also written as '''''Ekinchi''''' ({{lang-az|Əkinçi}} / اکينچي) was an [[Azerbaijan]] newspaper.  It was made in [[Baku]] It was the first [[newspaper]] fully printed in the [[Azerbaijani language]]. It was also the first newspaper in [[Russia]] printed in a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]].  The name means  " The [[wikt:plough|Plough]]man " . 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Hasan bey Zardabi]] started the newspaper.  He was a [[journalist]], teacher and scientist. ''Akinchi'' was thought to be almost [[revolutionary]] because of the language it was made in and that so many people could read it. Zardabi used a simpler form of the Azeri language so more people could read the paper. 
 
 The Russian [[governor]] of the [[Caucasus]] [[Dmitry Staroselsky]] liked Zardabi's plans. Staroselsky supported him in starting ''Akinchi''. He was also the one to name the newspaper.  He thought the name would make the authorities think that ''Akinchi'' was non-political and about [[agriculture]]. In addition to agriculture articles Zardabi wrote about [[medicine]] and [[biology]].  There were also stories about the social and cultural state of [[Muslims]] in the Caucasus. < ref > [http://www.geocities.com/evan_j_siegel/Akinji/Akinji.html ''Äkinjý'' and Azerbaijani Self-Definition]by [[Evan Siegel]].

 Partly because Staroselsky left, the paper ended on 29 September 1877. There was also little money and few readers. There were only 300 constant readers. < ref name= " nashvek " > {{in lang|ru}} [http://nashvek.media-az.com/322/lider.html Everything Began with ''Akinchi''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011741/http://nashvek.media-az.com/322/lider.html |date=2007-09-28 }} by Nigar Jafarova.
