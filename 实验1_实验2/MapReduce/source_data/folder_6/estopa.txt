 José Muñoz, the younger brother, was born in 1978. He plays [[guitar]] for Estopa. David Muñoz, the older brother, was born in 1976. He is the [[singer]] and also plays some guitar. They are brothers born in [[Extremadura]]. The brothers grew up listening to such bands as [[Los Chichos]], [[Los Chunguitos]], and [[Bordón]] on their trips with their parents from Cornellà to Zarza Capilla, where their parents were from. 
 
 As they grew up, José and David attended college for some time before deciding that it was not right for them. After quitting their studies, they worked for a [[factory]] [[manufacturing]] car parts for the company SEAT. It was in that factory where they began composing their earliest songs and they began to play in local bars. 
 
 After playing a song for the bosses at BMG Music España, Estopa was given a [[Record label|record deal]].
