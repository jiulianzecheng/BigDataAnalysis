 A '''pixel''' (short for '''pic'''ture '''el'''ement) is a single point in a [[picture]]. On the [[computer monitor|monitor]] of a [[computer]], a pixel is usually a [[square (geometry)|square]]. Every pixel has a [[color]] and all the pixels together are the picture. The color of a pixel can be stored by using a combination of [[red]], [[green]] and [[blue]] ([[RGB]]) but other combinations are also possible, such as [[cyan]], [[magenta]], [[yellow]] and [[black]] ([[CMYK]]). 
 
 == The word  " pixel "  == 
 The word  " pixel "  was first used in a paper by [[Frederic C. Billingsley]] in [[1965]]. He did not create the word himself. He got it from Keith E. McFarland but Keith does not know where he got it from. Keith said that the word was in use in those days. 
 
 The word  " pixel "  uses  " pix "  as a shorter word (an [[abbreviation]]) for  " picture " . The word pix was first used in [[1932]] in [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], a [[magazine]]. It was an abbreviation for  " pictures "  or [[movie]]s. By [[1938]] the word  " pix "  was also used for pictures that did not move (still pictures). 
 
 The word  " picture element "  is even older. For example, the [[German language|German]] word ''Bildpunkt'' (which means  " picture point " ) was used in a [[1888]] [[patent]] of [[Paul Gottlieb Nipkow]].
