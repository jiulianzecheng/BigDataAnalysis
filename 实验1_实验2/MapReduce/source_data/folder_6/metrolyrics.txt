'''MetroLyrics''' is a [[lyric]]s-dedicated website. It was founded in 2002. The database has over a million songs. These were created by more than 16,000 artists. 
 ==History== 
 It was the first lyrics-dedicated site to license licensing aggregator [[Gracenote]] Inc.'s lyrics catalogue in April 2008. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://metroleap.com/releases.php |title=Metroleap.com |access-date=2022-11-24 |archive-date=2011-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106053011/http://metroleap.com/releases.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Through this lyrics licensing model, lyrics copyright holders accrue royalty revenue when their work is displayed on MetroLyrics.com. Royalties are paid on all displayed lyrics. They are also handled via Gracenote.  
 
 In January 2013, LyricFind acquired Gracenote's lyrics licensing business. They merged it in with their own. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.lyricfind.com/gracenote-larry-marcus/ |title=Welcoming Gracenote and Larry Marcus! |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2014 |archive-date=December 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226085348/https://www.lyricfind.com/gracenote-larry-marcus/%20 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  MetroLyrics' licensing model is distinct. This is because lots of lyric websites still offer content that is unlicensed and [[Copyright infringement|copyright infringing]]. < ref > {{cite web|last=Plambeck|first=Joseph|title=Lyrics Sites at Center of Fight Over Royalties|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 9, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/business/media/10lyrics.html?_r=1 & scp=1 & sq=lyrics%20royalty & st=cse|accessdate=May 9, 2010}} < /ref >
