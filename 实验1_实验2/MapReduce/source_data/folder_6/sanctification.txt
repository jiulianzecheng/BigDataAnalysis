The word '''sanctification''' refers to the act of making [[holy]] or setting apart as special. The word is used five times in the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] of the [[New Testament]] ([http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/1-30.htm 1 Corinthians 1:30], [http://scripturetext.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm 1 Thessalonians 4:3],[http://scripturetext.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm 1 Thessalonians 4:4], [http://scripturetext.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm 2 Thessalonians 2:13], and [http://scripturetext.com/1_peter/1-2.htm 1 Peter 1:2]). 
 
 To '''sanctify''' means “to set apart for special use or purpose,” and “to make holy or sacred,” and [[Etymology|etymologically]] from the [[Latin]] [[verb]] 'sanctificare' which in turn is from ''[[sanctus]]'' “[[holy]]” and ''facere'' “to make.” 
 
 When an object or place is made holy, usually a ceremony is performed. Then people see that it is a special object or place and treat it with respect.  A person may also be  " set apart for special purpose " , as when a priest or pastor is [[Consecration|ordained]].   
 
 Sanctification can also refer to how a person becomes a good moral person, or  someone with a close relationship to God.  This may not include any ceremony.  Persons who achieve this holiness are sometimes called [[Saint]]s.  Some churches have a list of saints who have been recognized as having been especially holy persons.    
 
 Generally in [[Protestant]] teaching, all [[Christians]] are considered saints.  All are expected to become people who are close to God and who live a life like that which Jesus taught.  Reading the Bible, prayer, worshiping God and Jesus and telling others about their faith are important in becoming sanctified.
