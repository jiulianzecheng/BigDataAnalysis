 '''Trousers''' (or '''pants''' in [[Canada]], [[South Africa]] and [[the United States]]), < ref > sometimes called '''slacks''' or '''breeches''' {{pronounced|ˈbrɪtʃɨz}} < /ref >  are a kind of [[clothing]]. They are worn on the lower part of the body, to cover both [[legs]] apart (instead of cloth stretching across both as in [[skirt]]s and [[dress]]es).   
 
 Historically, in the [[Western world|West]], trousers have been the lower-body clothing item for men since the 16th century; by the late 20th century, they were used sometimes by women as well. Trousers are worn at the [[hip]]s or [[waist]], and may be held up by their own by a [[belt]], or [[braces]] (suspenders).
