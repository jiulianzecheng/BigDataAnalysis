 A '''blazar'''  is a very compact [[quasar]] (quasi-stellar radio source). They have a presumed [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of an active, giant [[elliptical galaxy]]. Blazars are among the most energetic [[phenomena]] in the [[universe]] and are an important topic in [[astronomy]]. 
 
 Blazars are one of a group of active galaxies that host [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN). An AGN is a region at the centre of a galaxy which has a much higher than normal [[luminosity]] over some or all of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  
 
 The name  " blazar "  was originally coined in 1978 by astronomer [[Edward Spiegel]]. Blazars are AGN with a relativistic jet < ref > relativistic = moving at or close to the [[speed of light]] < /ref >  which is pointing in the general direction of the [[Earth]]. We observe  " down "  the jet, or nearly so. Many blazars have apparent [[superluminal motion|superluminal features]] < ref > superluminal features = look like they move faster than light < /ref >  within the first few parsecs of their jets, probably due to relativistic shock fronts. < ref > relativistic shock: shock velocity is close to the speed of light. Expected in [[gamma ray burst]]s, active galactic nucleus jets and in some types of [[supernova]] explosions. < /ref > < ref name= Biretta > {{cite web | title=HUBBLE detects faster-than-light motion in galaxy M87 | author=Biretta, John | publisher=Space Telecsope Science Institute | location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] | url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/m87/press.txt | date=1999 }} < /ref > 
 
 The blazar at the centre of galaxy [[M87]] is fuelled by a black hole with a mass of about three [[billion]] solar masses within ten light years of the galaxy centre. < ref name=Biretta/ >
