 '''''Abelisaurus''''' is a genus of [[theropod]] dinosaur. They lived in [[List of South American dinosaurs|South America]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. There is one species in the genus ''Abelisaurus comahuensis''.  
 
 ''Abelisaurus'' was the first abelisaurid that people found. The family, the [[Abelisauridae]], is named after ''Abelisaurus'''. ''Abelisaurus'' is the [[type genus]]. Despite this, scientists do not know much about how the dinosaur lived.  
 
 The only fossils found so far are several skull bones.  People found them in [[Argentina]]. Scientists put them back together in a lab to create a skull. The skull is similar to that of other members of its family. Like most abelisaurs, it is blunt and short in length, but tall from top to bottom. ''Abelisaurus'' probably ate large [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, such as ''[[Amargasaurus]]''. Scientists think ''Abelisaurus'' hunted in packs. It may also have hunted smaller plant-eating dinosaurs, such as the small ornithopod ''[[Gasparinisaura]]''.
