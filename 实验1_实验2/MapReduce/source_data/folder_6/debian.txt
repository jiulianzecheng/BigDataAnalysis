 '''Debian''' is a free [[operating system]]. It is a distribution of an operating system known as the [[GNU|GNU operating system]], which can be used with various kernels, including [[Linux kernel|Linux]], [[FreeBSD|kFreeBSD]], and [[GNU Hurd|Hurd]]. In combination with these kernels, the operating system can be referred to as Debian GNU/Linux, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, and Debian GNU/Hurd, respectively. Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most complete and popular [[Linux|GNU/Linux distributions]], on which many others, like [[Ubuntu]], are based. 
 
 == Brief history == 
 The Debian Project officially started on August 16th, 1993, led by [[Ian Murdock]]. He was a [[computer programmer]]. Today, in this project, Debian is developed by more than 1,000 computer specialists all over the world. 
 
 The name  " Debian "  was taken after Ian Murdock and his wife Debra. Some people say or pronounce 'deb-ee-n' but others also say 'de-bi-an' or 'de-bai-an' and in Japan 'de-bi-a-n' and so on. 
 
 == Development steps == 
 Software packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named ''unstable'' (also known as ''sid''), or to the ''experimental'' repository. Software packages uploaded to ''unstable'' are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original [[upstream (software development)|upstream]] developer, but with the added Debian-specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers. These additions may be new and untested. Software not ready yet for the ''unstable'' distribution is typically placed in the ''experimental'' repository. < ref name= " ftparchive " > {{cite web

 | url-status = dead 
 }} < /ref > 
 
 After a version of a software package has remained in ''unstable'' for a certain length of time (depending on how urgent the changes are), that package is automatically moved to the ''testing'' distribution. The package's move to testing happens only if no serious (''release-critical'') bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in ''testing''. < ref name= " ftparchive "  / > 
 
 Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features, some choose to use the ''testing'' and ''unstable'' distributions for their newer packages. However, these distributions are less tested than ''stable'', and ''unstable'' does not receive timely security updates.  In particular, incautious upgrades to working ''unstable'' packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality. < ref name= " securityfaq " >

 After the packages in ''testing'' have matured and the goals for the next release are met, the ''testing'' distribution becomes the next stable release. The latest stable release of Debian (''Buster'') is 10.0, released on July 6, 2019. The next release is codenamed  " ''Bullseye'' " . < ref name= " ftparchive "  / >
