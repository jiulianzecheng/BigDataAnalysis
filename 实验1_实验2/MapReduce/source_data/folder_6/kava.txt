 '''Kava''' is a plant of the pepper family. It comes from [[Polynesia]] and other lands in the [[Pacific Islands]]. 
 
 The roots of the plant are used to make a drink with [[sedative]] and [[anesthetic]] properties. Kava is used in many [[culture]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]], besides its native [[Polynesia]]. These include [[Hawaii]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Melanesia]] and some parts of [[Micronesia]].  
 
 Kava can relieve pain and make people calm. It is usually taken as a [[drug]] to relax without losing mental clarity in thinking and remembering. [[Evidence]] collected in studies show Kava is likely more effective than a [[placebo]] at helping calm some mild [[anxiety]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Pittler MH, Ernst E |title=Kava extract for treating anxiety |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD003383 |year=2003 |pmid=12535473 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003383 |url=|editor1-last=Pittler|editor1-first=Max H}} < /ref >
