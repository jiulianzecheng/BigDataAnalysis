 '''Gluconeogenesis''' (GNG) is a chemical process in [[organism|living bodies]].  In gluconeogenesis, the body turns [[fat]]s and [[protein]]s ([[glucogenic amino acid]]s) into [[sugar]]s called [[glucose]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/lehningerprincip01lehn|title=Lehninger principles of biochemistry.|last1=Lehninger|first1=Albert L.|last2=Nelson|first2=David L.

Not eating and not eating starch can cause [[ketosis]], which is when some cells cannot use [[ketone]]s for fuel. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Rui|first=Liangyou|date=January 2014|title=Energy Metabolism in the Liver|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|volume=4|issue=1|pages=177–197|doi=10.1002/cphy.c130024|isbn=9780470650714|issn=2040-4603|pmc=4050641|pmid=24692138}} < /ref >

 In humans, the main gluconeogenic compounds are [[lactic acid|lactate]], [[glycerol]] (a part of the [[triglyceride]] molecule), [[alanine]] and [[glutamine]]. They are mostly involved in over 90% of the overall process. < ref name= " pmid11213896 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Gerich JE, Meyer C, Woerle HJ, Stumvoll M | title = Renal gluconeogenesis: its importance in human glucose homeostasis | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–91 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11213896 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.24.2.382 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12117257 | doi-access = free }} < /ref > 
 
 Lactate comes back to the liver where it is converted into [[pyruvate]] by the [[Cori cycle]] using the enzyme [[lactate dehydrogenase]]. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to make glucose. < ref name= " Garrett " > {{cite book |title=Principles of Biochemistry with a Human Focus |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofbioc0000garr |last1=Garrett |first1=Reginald H. | first2 = Charles M. | last2 = Grisham | name-list-style = vanc |year=2002 |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Thomson Learning |location=USA |isbn=978-0-03-097369-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofbioc0000garr/page/578 578], 585 }} < /ref > 
 
 Fat is mostly broken down, but if there is no fat to break down, or the body cannot access the fat stores, then proteins found in the muscle can break down, resulting in muscle loss. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Manninen|first=Anssi H|date=2006-01-31|title=Very-low-carbohydrate diets and preservation of muscle mass|journal=Nutrition  &  Metabolism|volume=3|pages=9|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-3-9|issn=1743-7075|pmc=1373635|pmid=16448570}} < /ref >
