Frumentius was a [[Bishop]] known as the person who started the Ethiopian [[Orthodox Church]] and who brought [[Christianity]] to [[Ethiopia]]. 
 
 ==Life== 
 Frumentius was born in the 4th Century in Tyre which is now [[Lebanon]]. Frumentius and his [[brother]] Edesius were [[shipwreck]]ed in [[Eritrea]]. Everyone else on the ship was [[kill]]ed by the [[people]] there but Frumentius and Edesius were captured and sold into [[slavery]]. They became [[slave]]s of Ousanas, the [[King]] of the [[tribe]] of Axum. Ousanas freed them before his [[death]] and his [[widow]] hired them to [[tutor]] her son [[Ezana]], King of Axum.  
 
 While teaching Ezana, Frumentius tried to convince as many [[people]] as he could to become [[Christian]].  Once Ezana was an [[adult]] both Frumentius and his brother Edesius left [[Ethiopia]]. Edesius went back [[home]] to [[Tyre]] but Frumentius went to [[Egypt]] to convince  [[Athanasias]] the creator of the [[Athanasian Creed]] to appoint [[missionaries]] to Axum. So Athanasius appointed Frumentius as a [[bishop]]. Frumentius went back to [[Ethiopia]] this time with [[Christian]] [[priest]]s to start [[Church]]es and to convince people there to become [[Christians]]. Frumentius even managed to get King Ezana to convert to [[Christianity]]. When the [[Roman Empire]] told [[Ezana]] to replace Frumentius with another [[bishop]], because Frumentius didnâ€™t believe in the [[Nicene Creed]], Ezana said no. 
 
 ==Sainthood== 
 In [[Ethiopia]], the [[Orthodox Church]] says that Frumentius is a Saint and they call him Saint Frumentius.
