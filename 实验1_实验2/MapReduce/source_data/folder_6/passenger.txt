 A '''passenger''' is a term that is used for a person who travels in a [[vehicle]], but not the driver or a person working in the [[vehicle]].  
 
 There are two common ways in which the term is used: 
 
 * The first is for persons who ride in [[automobile|car]]s or [[van]]s. The term is used for these type of passengers if they have or have not paid for the ride. 
 * The second is for persons who pay to ride in [[public transport]] vehicles such as [[bus]]es, [[train]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[ship]]s. People who work on the vehicle are [[crew]], not passengers.  
 
 In most places the company who owns the vehicles and the people who work on them have [[law|legal]] [[wikt:obligation|obligations]] to the passengers riding with them.
