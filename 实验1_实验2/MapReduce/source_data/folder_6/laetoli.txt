 '''Laetoli''' is a site in [[Tanzania]], dated to the [[Pliocene|Plio]]{{ndash}}[[Pleistocene]]. It is famous for its [[hominin]] footprints, preserved in [[volcanic ash]]. The site of the '''Laetoli footprints''' is 45 & nbsp;km south of [[Olduvai gorge]]. It was excavated by [[archaeologists]] [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]] in 1978. “The Laetoli Footprints” got a lot of attention from the public because they are convincing evidence of [[bipedal]]ism in [[Pliocene]] hominins. 
 
 Dated to 3.6 million years ag,o they were the oldest known evidence of hominin bipedalism. Now older evidence has been found, such as the ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' fossils. < ref > Bipedalism can be deduced from the leg-bones and pelvis if these are known. < /ref >  The footprints and skeletal structure excavated at Laetoli were clear evidence that bipedalism [[evolved]] before enlarged brains in hominids. Although it is debated, it is believed the three individuals who made these footprints belonged to the species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''. Together with footprints were other hominin and animal skeletal remains and [[Acheulean]] artifacts ([[hand-axes]]).

 After debate, it was decided that  ''Australopithecus afarensis'' is the species of the three hominins who made the footprints at Laetoli. This is based on the reconstruction of the foot skeleton of a female ''A. afrarensis'' hominin. < ref > White T.D.  &  Suwa G. 1987. Hominid footprints at Laetoli: facts and interpretations. ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology''. '''72''' (4). pp. 485–514. < /ref >  Detailed footprint analysis compared both [[human]] and bipedal [[animal]]s such as [[bears]] and [[primate]]s. Gaits (stride pattern), and foot structure were analysed. Step length, stride length, stride width and foot angle showed that ''A. afarensis'' was more human-like in gait than ape-like. < ref > Tuttle R.H; Webb D.M.,  &  Baksh M. 1991. Laetoli toes and ''Australopithecus afarensis''. ''Human Evolution''. '''6''' (3) pp. 193–200. < /ref > < ref > Tuttle,' R.H. 2008. Footprint clues in hominid evolution and forensics: lessons andlLimitations. ''Ichnos''. '''15''' (3-4), pp. 158–165. < /ref > 
 
 ''A. afarensis'', then, is an obligate bipedal hominid. < ref > 'Obligate' means it only walks using its legs, never with the hands on the ground. < /ref >  Its brain size was very similar to that of modern [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s. So, in one important respect it was like the genus ''[[Homo]]'' since it was bipedal. That means it was adapted to living in open [[woodland]] and [[savannah]], not [[tropical]] [[rain forest]]. On the other hand, it had a brain about the size of an ape. This situation, where different [[Trait (biology)|traits]] of an animal evolve at different rates, is known as [[mosaic evolution]].

 The oldest hominin footprints in Europe are in Britain. They are about 800,000 years to a million years old. < ref > Ghosh, Pallab 2014. Earliest footprints outside Africa discovered in Norfolk. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Technology. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26025763] < /ref > < ref name= " Nick " > Ashton, Nick ''et al'' 2014. Hominin footprints from early Pleistocene deposits at Happisburgh, UK. PLoS One.[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0088329] < /ref >  They were found on [[Happisburgh]] beach, [[East Anglia]]. 
 
 The archaeologists describe them as  " the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago " . The site in known for its preservation of sediments with early [[Pleistocene]] [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. Since 2005 [[flint]] tools have been found. This means humans occupied northern Europe at least 350,000 years earlier than was thought before.
