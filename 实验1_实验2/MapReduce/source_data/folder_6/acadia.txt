 '''Acadia''' is the name of a territory in northeastern North America. Today, the area is mostly part of [[Canada]]. At the time, [[England]] and [[France]] fought over the territory. France said it had a legitimate claim, because [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] and [[Jacques Cartier]] had done expeditions in the area. The British claim was founded on an expedition of [[John Cabot|Giovanni Caboto]]. The borders of the territory had never been defined clearly. Fights about where these borders were, were common. Historically, Acadia covered the territories of  [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and the southern part of the [[Gasp√© Peninsula]], in [[Quebec]]. The northeastern part of [[Maine]] was also part of Acadia.
