 A '''watch''' is a small [[clock]] carried or worn by a person. It makes it easy to see the time. It is also a [[fashion accessory]] for men and women, and expensive watches are designed for this purpose. A watch may be one of the few accessories worn by a person. 
 
 A '''wristwatch''' is designed to be worn on a [[wrist]], attached by a [[strap]] or other type of [[bracelet]]. A [[pocket watch]] is to be carried in a pocket. There are other variations. [[Nurse]]s often wear a watch attached to the front of their [[uniform]]. It hangs down from a short strap: when lifted by the user it is right side up.  
 
 A wrist watch has the advantage of being portable in comparison to traditional watches.  
 
 Watches evolved in the 17th & nbsp;century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th & nbsp;century. In 1524, [[Peter Henlein]] created the first pocket watch.  
 The first watches were strictly mechanical, driven by [[clockwork]].  
 
 As technology developed, mechanical watches were largely replaced by [[Quartz clock#Mechanism|vibrating quartz crystals]], producing accurately timed electronic pulses. < ref name= " The history of watches " > {{cite web|url=http://steelwatch.co/history-of-watches.php|title=The History of Watches|publisher=SteelWatch.co|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707053557/http://steelwatch.co/history-of-watches.php|archivedate=2011-07-07}} < /ref >  Some watches use [[radio]] technology to correct the time and date. < ref > Common with modern car clocks < /ref >  The first digital electronic watch was developed in 1970. < ref > Pulsar LED [http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/quartz/coolwatches/pulsar.html Smithsonian] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323064128/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/quartz/coolwatches/pulsar.html |date=2011-03-23 }} < /ref >

 Electronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so it works as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a stable frequency, which paces a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily [[electronic]] but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to give a traditional analog display of the time. Most consumers prefer this. 
 
 Some watches are [[smartwatch]]es, [[mobile device]]s similar to [[smartphone]]s but smaller.
