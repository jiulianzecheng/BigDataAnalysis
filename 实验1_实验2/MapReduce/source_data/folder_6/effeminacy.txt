When boys or men show traits or take roles that are associated with the image of being a girl or woman this is known as '''effeminacy'''. Throughout history, such men have been faced with [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]]. [[Gay]] men are often seen as showing effeminacy. However, [[femininity]], [[masculinity]], and other forms of [[gender expression]] are independent of [[sexual orientation]]. 
 
 Other words for effeminacy include: ''pansy'', ''nelly'', ''pretty boy'', ''nancy boy'', ''girly boy'', ''molly'', ''[[sissy]]'', ''[[pussy]]'', ''tomgirl'', ''femboy'', < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite web|title=What Does femboy Mean? {{!}} Gender  &  Sexuality by Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/gender-sexuality/femboy/|access-date=2020-03-11|website=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  ''roseboy'', ''baby'', and ''[[girl]]'' (when applied to a boy or, especially, adult man). The word ''effete'' similarly implies effeminacy or over-refinement, but comes from the Latin term ''effetus'' meaning 'having given birth; exhausted', from ''ex-'' and ''fetus'' 'offspring'. The term ''tomgirl'', meaning a girlish boy, comes from an inversion of ''[[tomboy]]'', meaning a boyish girl. The term ''girly boy'' comes from a gender-inversion of ''[[girly girl]]''.
