 '''Yaoshang''' (originally, '' " Yaawol Shang " '') is a [[spring]] time festival celebrated by the [[Meitei ethnicity]] for five consecutive days starting from the full moon day of the lunar month of '' " Lamta " '' of the [[Meitei calendar]] ([[Manipuri calendar]]). Historically, it was a religious festival but in present days, it has lost its religious tones during celebration. It is the most important and the most popular festival in [[Manipur]] as well as among the [[Meitei ethnicity]]. Imitating the ways of [[Holi]], people use [[color]]s to [[smear]] or [[spray]] among each other during the celebration. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.tourmyindia.com/states/manipur/yaoshang-festival.html | title=Yaoshang Festival Manipur  & #124; Popular Festival of Manipur }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://easternmirrornagaland.com/five-day-yaoshang-festival-begins-in-manipur-2/ | title=Five-day Yaoshang festival begins in Manipur - Eastern Mirror | date=6 March 2015 }} < /ref > < ref > http://manipur.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/general_holiday_2016.pdf < /ref >
