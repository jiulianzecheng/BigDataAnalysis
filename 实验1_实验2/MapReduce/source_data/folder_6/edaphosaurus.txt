 '''''Edaphosaurus''''' was a [[pelycosaur]] (early [[Synapsida]]) that lived during the later [[Carboniferous]] and early [[Permian]]. It was a [[herbivore|herbivorous]] relative of the well-known ''[[Dimetrodon]]''. Both had a large, thermal regulating sail on the back. Fossils of 
 ''Edaphosaurus'' have been found in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  
 
 ''Edaphosaurus'' species measured from {{convert|0.5|m|ft|1}} to almost {{convert|3.5|m|ft|1}} in length and weighed over 300 kilograms (660 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]). < ref name=Palaeos > {{cite web|title=Edaphosaurus|url=http://palaeos.com/vertebrates/synapsida/edaphosauridae2.html#Edaphosaurus|website=Palaeos|accessdate=22 May 2015}} < /ref >  It was slightly taller and stockier than ''Dimetrodon'', but like its pelycosaur relatives had a small head and a long tail. 
 
 == Skull == 
 The head of ''Edaphosaurus'' was rather small for its body size. The deep lower jaw likely had powerful muscles and the teeth along the front and sides of its jaws could crop bite-sized pieces from tough plants.  
 
 The roof of the mouth and the inside of the lower jaw had batteries of peglike teeth. They were a crushing and grinding surface. Early descriptions suggested that ''Edaphosaurus'' fed on [[molluscs]], which it crushed with its teeth plates. However, paleontologists now think that ''Edaphosaurus'' ate plants. Lack of wear on the teeth suggests  " limited processing of food " . < ref name= " RRR06 " > {{cite journal |last= Reisz R.R. 2006. |title= Origin of dental occlusion in tetrapods: signal for terrestrial vertebrate evolution? |journal= Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B |year= 2006 |volume= 306B |issue= 3 |pages= 261–277 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21115|pmid= 16683226 }} < /ref >  Earlier members of the [[Edaphosauridae]]  lacked tooth plates, and ate [[insects]].
