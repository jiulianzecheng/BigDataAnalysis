 '''Chromate''' is an [[ion]] that contains one [[chromium]] atom (in its +6 [[oxidation state]]) and four [[oxide]] atoms. Its formula is CrO < sub > 4 < /sub > . Its overall charge is -2. '''Dichromate''' is similar, but it contains two chromium atoms and seven oxide atoms (therefore, Cr < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 7 < /sub > ). 
 
 Chromate and dichromate are strongly [[oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] in [[acid]]ic conditions, but weakly oxidizing in [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions. Chromates are generally bright yellow, while dichromates are generally orange or red. They can be made by reaction of [[chromium(III) oxide]] and a metal oxide in a basic environment. They can be destroyed by reaction with [[reducing agent]]s. The [[oxygen]] in the air boosts the chromium atom's oxidation state from +3 to +6.  
 
 Chromates and dichromates are harmful when powdered because the dust is [[carcinogen]]ic (it can cause [[cancer]]). This can be avoided by [[reduction (chemistry)|reducing]] chromate with something like [[iron(II) sulfate]].
