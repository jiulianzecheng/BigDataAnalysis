'''Interdisciplinarity''' is when two or more [[subject]]s ([[academic]] disciplines) join up. This happens when a problem overlaps traditional academic boundaries. < ref > Klein, Julie Thompson. 1990. ''Interdisciplinarity: history, theory, and practice''. Detroit: Wayne State University. < /ref >  Other terms which mean almost the same thing are '''multidisciplinarity''' and '''crossdisciplinarity'''. < ref > Frodeman R; Klein J.T.  &  Mitcham C. 2010.

 An examples makes clear what is meant: 
 
 *In order to investigate living [[cells]], these subjects joined together: [[genetics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[cytology]]. 
 
 :When they joined up, the field they formed was called [[cell biology]] at the level of cells, or [[molecular biology]] at the level of [[macromolecule]]s. 
 
 Other examples include [[artificial intelligence]], [[cultural studies]],  [[cybernetics]], [[computational linguistics]], [[biomedical engineering]], and so on. [[Physical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[astrophysics]]  must have been some of the first. 
 
 In many universities, traditional departments (e.g. [[botany]], [[zoology]]) were scrapped, and new broader departments like 'School of biological sciences' were formed. Inside this umbrella, research and teaching teams were based on interdisciplinary problems, such as [[ecology]] or [[cell division]] or [[Earth history]]. There are some necessary specialities which do not fit easily into the new system. Examples are [[taxonomy]] (you still need people to identify animals) and areas like [[parasitology]] and agricultural [[botany]].  
 
 A system which works in some universities is to appoint staff to the Schools (usually [[Humanities]], [[Science]]. [[Social sciences]] and [[Technology]]) and let the staff join those groups which best fit their expertise.
