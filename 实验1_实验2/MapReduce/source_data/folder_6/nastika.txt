'''Astika''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|आस्तिक}}:  " orthodox " )  and '''Nastika''': ( " heterodox " ) are technical terms in [[Hinduism]] used to classify [[Hindu philosophy|philosophical schools]] and persons, according to whether they accept the authority of the [[Vedas]] as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. < ref > pp. 82, 224-49. {{cite book | last = Flood | first = Gavin | year = 1996 | title = An Introduction to Hinduism| url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontohi0000floo | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge}} < /ref >  By this definition, [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]]  are classified as ''astika'' schools; while [[Charvaka]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are considered ''nastika'' schools. < ref > For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan, Sarvepalli;  and Moore, Charles A. ''A Source Book in Indian Philosophy''.  Princeton University Press; 1957. Princeton paperback 12th edition, 1989. {{ISBN|0-691-01958-4}}. < /ref > 
 
 In non-technical usage, the term ''astika'' is sometimes loosely translated as  " [[theist]] "  while ''nastika'' is translated as  " [[atheist]] " . < ref > For [http://www.iheu.org/node/185 instance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105244/http://www.iheu.org/node/185 |date=2007-04-18 }}, the  " Atheist Society of India "  produces a monthly publications ''Nasthika Yugam'' which it translates as  " The Age of Atheism " . < /ref >    However this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in Hindu philosophy. Notably even among the ''astika'' schools, ''samkhya'' < ref > " By Sāṃkhya reasoning, the material principle itself simply evolves into complex forms, and there is no need to hold that some spiritual power governs the material principle or its ultimate source. "   Francis Clooney, CJ,  " ''Restoring 'Hindu Theology' as a category in Indian intellectual discourse " , in   " ''Blackwell companion to Hinduism " '', Flood, Gavin (Ed.) [[Blackwell Publishing]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}} < /ref >  and the early ''mimamsa'' school do not accept a [[Ishvara|God]] (see [[Atheism in Hinduism]]) while accepting the authority of the Vedas; they thus are  " atheistic ''astika'' schools " . 
 
 The three main heterodox schools of Indian philosophy do not base their beliefs on [[Vedas|Vedic]] authority: 
 
 * [[Buddhism]] 
 * [[Jainism]] 
 * [[Charvaka]] 
 
 The use of the term ''nastika'' to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows: 
 < blockquote > 
 At an early period, during the formation of the [[Upanishad|Upanişads]] and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions.... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism. < ref > Flood, op. cit., p. 82. < /ref >

 The [[Tantra|Tantric traditions]] in Hinduism, have both ''astika'' and ''nastika'' lines; as   Banerji writes in  " ''Tantra in Bengal'' " : 
 
 < blockquote > 
 Tantras are ... also divided as ''āstika'' or Vedic and ''nāstika'' or non-Vedic.  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava. < ref > Banerji, S. C. ''Tantra in Bengal''.
