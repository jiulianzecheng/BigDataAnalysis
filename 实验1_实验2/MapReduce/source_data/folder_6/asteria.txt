 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Asteria''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀστερία -  " of the stars "  or  " [the] starry one " ) was the Titan goddess of falling stars and nocturnal divination, such as [[astrology]]. Asteria was apart of the second generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the daughter of [[Coeus|Koios]] and [[Phoebe]], and sister of [[Leto]]. She is the wife of the Titan [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]], by whom she is the mother of [[Hecate]], goddess of magic and witchcraft. When [[Zeus]] began to lust for her, Asteria escaped his advances by leaping into the sea and becoming the floating island [[Delos]], upon which her sister Leto eventually gave birth to the twins [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]]. As such, she is often labelled  " Delos "  on Athenian vase-painting. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisAsteria.html|title=ASTERIA - Greek Titan Goddess of Falling Stars  &  Nighttime Divination|website=www.theoi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}} < /ref >
