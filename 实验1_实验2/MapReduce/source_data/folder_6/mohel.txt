 ==Procedure== 
 A knife is traditionally used for this, but a clamp is now sometimes used instead. In [[Orthodox Judaism]] the mohel is male. However, some more progressive types of Judaism allow women to serve as a mohel.  
 
 ==Event== 
 The event of the circumcision is called a ''[[Brit milah]]'', sometimes pronounced ''bris'' especially by Jews of European heritage whose ancestors spoke [[Yiddish]]. The mohel says prayers with the infant's family and guests, to welcome the baby boy into the Jewish religion.
