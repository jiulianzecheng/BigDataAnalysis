[[File: Insulin chain A and B linked by disulfide bridges.gif|frame|right|Insulin is a peptide hormone containing two chains cross-linked by [[disulfide]] [[Bicyclic molecule|bridges (chemical)]].]] 
 
 '''Insulin''' is a [[hormone]] made by the [[pancreas]] in the [[body]] that controls the [[glucose]] level in the blood. 
 
 Insulin promotes the absorption of [[sugar]] from the blood. The sugar is stored as [[adipose tissue|fat cells]]. People who cannot make insulin in their bodies, or enough for their needs, have the disease [[diabetes]]. 
 
 When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the human body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through [[glycogenolysis]]. This process breaks down the [[glycogen]] stored in the [[liver]] and [[muscle]]s into glucose which can then be used as an energy source. Insulin is a central metabolic control mechanism. Insulin is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as [[amino acid]] uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other [[anabolism|anabolic]] effects throughout the body. 
 
 Human insulin is a [[peptide hormone]] composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s and has a [[molecule|molecular weight]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. The [[islets of Langerhans]] in the [[pancreas]] produces insulin. The name comes from the [[Latin]] ''insula'' for  " island " . Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. [[pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version. So, people with [[diabetes]] can take in insulin got from pigs instead of producing their own insulin. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Nicolae Paulescu]], a [[Romanians|Romanian]] professor of physiology was the first to isolate insulin. He did that in 1916. He called it pancrein. He isolated it by developing a [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] extract which, when injected into a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] dog, proved to have a normalizing effect on [[blood sugar]] levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of [[World War I]]. In early 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in [[Bucharest]] and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he [[publishing|published]] an extensive paper on the effect of the pancreatic extract injected into a diabetic animal. The title was:  " Research on the Role of the [[Pancreas]] in Food Assimilation " , published 22 June 1921 by the  " Archives Internationales de Physiologie " , < ref name= " nrjs " > {{citation|last= Paulesco |first= N.C.| journal= Archives Internationales de Physiologie | title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive.|volume= 17|issue=|pages= 85–103| date=August 31, 1921}} < /ref > < ref name= " nrps " > {{citation|last= Lestradet |first= H.|journal= Diabetes  &  Metabolism|title= Le 75e anniversaire de la découverte de l'insuline.|volume= 23|issue= 1|pages= 112|year=1997| url= http://www.em-consulte.com/en/article/79613}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Frederick Banting]] did similar experiments while trying to find a cure for [[diabetes]]. In these experiments he also used [[dog]]s.  He first knew insulin would control [[diabetes]] in a person when he injected some insulin into a 14-year-old boy named Leonard Thompson, who was dying of [[diabetes]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dlife.com/dLife/do/ShowContent/inspiration_expert_advice/famous_people/leonard_thompson.html |title=Leonard Thompson Biography |accessdate=2009-10-06 |last= |first= |format= |publisher=dLife |pages= |quote= |archive-date=2009-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210030429/http://www.dlife.com/dLife/do/ShowContent/inspiration_expert_advice/famous_people/leonard_thompson.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  After the injection he survived. Banting won the 1923 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], with [[John Macleod]], for the discovery of insulin. 
 
 The first genetically engineered, synthetic  " human "  insulin was produced in a laboratory in 1977 by [[Herbert Boyer]] using [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]. < ref name= " urlGenentech " > {{cite web | url = http://www.gene.com/gene/news/press-releases/display.do?method=detail & id=4160 | title = First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced | author = | authorlink = | date = 1978-09-06 | format = | work = News Release | publisher = Genentech | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-11-03 }} < /ref > < ref name= " urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin " > {{cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I | authorlink = | year = 1994 | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-11-03 }} < /ref >
