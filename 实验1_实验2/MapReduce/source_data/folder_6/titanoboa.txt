 '''''Titanoboa cerrejonensis''''' is the largest known [[snake]]. < ref name=Nature/ > < ref > Previous record-holder was ''[[Gigantophis]]''. < /ref >   Now extinct, the snake was a relative of the ''[[anaconda]]'' and the ''[[boa constrictor]]''.  It was about 43 feet long (13 & nbsp;m), and weighed over a [[ton]] (about 1135 & nbsp;kg or 2,500 pounds).  The snake lived in the [[Palaeocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], about 58 million years ago. < ref name= " head " > {{cite journal|last=Head, Jason J. |display-authors = etal

 The fossil was found in an open-cast [[coal]] [[Mining|mine]] in [[Colombia]], in 2009. Plant fossils at the site proved the [[climate]] at the time was a [[tropical]] [[rainforest]]. The site was in the [[Cerrejón Formation]] in [[La Guajira]], Colombia. Other large reptile fossils have been found at this site. < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal | title = Scientists find world's biggest snake | url = http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090204/full/news.2009.80.html | date = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-02-04 | first = Roberta | last = Kwok | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/news.2009.80 }} < /ref > < ref name= " head "  / > < ref name= " sciencedaily " > {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090204112217.htm |title=''Science Daily'': At 2,500 pounds and 43 feet, prehistoric snake is largest on record. |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2009-02-06}} < /ref > 
 
 Researchers found three skulls of the snake in 2002. A life-size replica is on view at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington D.C.]] It was sent on a world tour to be shown at various museums. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://sitesarchives.si.edu/titanoboa/index.htm|title=Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service - Titanoboa: Monster Snake|website=sitesarchives.si.edu|access-date=2019-05-22}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 == Habitat == 
 ''Titanoboa'' lived in the first recorded tropical forest in [[South America]]. It shared the [[ecosystem]] with large [[Crocodylomorpha]] and large [[turtles]]. The paleogeography of the late Paleocene was a sheltered paralic (coastal) swamp, with an open connection to the proto-Caribbean in the north. In this environment tropical aquatic ferns like ''[[Salvinia]]'' flourished. The ferns were found as fossils in the [[Bogotá Formation]] and the [[Palermo Formation, Colombia|Palermo Formation]]. < ref > Pérez Consuegra, Nicolás; Aura Cuervo Gómez; Camila Martínez; Camilo Montes; Fabiany Herrera; Santiago Madriñán, and Carlos Jaramillo 2017.
