 '''Migration''' is when [[animal]]s move on a regular cycle. For example, [[caribou]] in the [[Arctic]] go south in winter and return in [[summer]] when it is warmer. Many [[bird]]s migrate, such as [[geese]] and [[stork]]s. 
 
 Migration is the travelling of long distances in search of a new [[habitat]]. The [[wikt:trigger|trigger]] for the migration may be local [[climate]], local availability of food, or the [[season]] of the year. To be counted as a true migration, and not just a local dispersal, the movement should be an annual or seasonal event. 
 
 Many birds fly to warmer places for the winter, as do some [[insect]]s such as the [[migratory locust]]. Young Atlantic [[salmon]] leave the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches (cm) in size. < ref name=Att > {{cite book|title=The trials of life|url=https://archive.org/details/trialsoflifenatu0000atte_a3v0|author=David Attenborough|year=1990|isbn=0002199408|publisher=Collins / BBC Books|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/trialsoflifenatu0000atte_a3v0/page/123 123]}} < /ref > 
 
 Many species in the sea have a daily migration. [[Plankton]] go up for the day where there is light, and down at night, where they are less easy to find. The many species which feed on them follow them up and down. 
 
 Migration is an [[evolution]]ary force. This is because it is a major source of [[natural selection]]. The success of migratory animals to make the journey is usually needed for them to reproduce. 
 
 Many parts of the world have a strongly seasonal [[climate]]. In order to survive, many species need to breed in one place and, later, eat in another place. The simplest example is the African [[herbivore]]s, who follow the growth of [[grass]] in [[East Africa]]. This region has seasonal [[rainfall]], and so it has seasonal growth of grass. Their [[predator]]s follow them. < ref name=Att/ >

 Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, usually north and south along a 'flyway', between [[breeding]] and [[winter]]ing grounds. Many species of [[bird]] migrate. Many birds die when they are migrating, and is mainly to get food. It occurs mostly in the [[northern hemisphere]], where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]]. 
 
 === Distances === 
 The [[Arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds. It flies between [[Arctic]] breeding grounds and the [[Antarctic]] each year. [[Albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the [[Southern Ocean|southern oceans]]. The [[Manx shearwater]] migrates {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between its northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including [[altitude|altitudinal]] migrations up and down mountains like the [[Andes]] and [[Himalayas]]. 
 
 
 Since the distance that some birds travel on migration can be enormous, < ref > Gill, Frank 1995. ''Ornithology''. New York: WH Freeman. ISBN 0-7167-2415-4 < /ref >  why such huge distances? Migration is useful for the birds, because the seasonal differences are to the birds' advantage. So far as is known, migration instincts are inherited: the birds cannot make a personal choice in the matter. All the same, in some species not all migrate. There is a cost to migration in the number of birds which die ''en route''. There is an advantage only if the birds which migrate have a better chance of leaving descendants. Studies of migration have been done since the 18th century. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Greenwood |first=Jeremy J.

 Historically, bird migration would have started when the continents were close together. It might have started in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] or the [[Palaeocene]]. Then. as the continents drifted apart, the bird migrations got longer and longer. That makes sense, and probably is what happened. There is no direct evidence. 
 
 ==== How do they do it? ==== 
 [[Biomagnetism]] is part of the answer. There are crystals of [[magnetite]] which occur in many birds (and some other organisms). < ref name=Magnetite-based_magnetoreception > {{ cite journal |last1 = Kirschvink |first1 = J L |last2 = Walker |first2 = M.M |last3 = Diebel |first3 = C.E |title = Magnetite-based magnetoreception. |journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology |pmid = 11502393 |pages = 462–7 |issue = 4 |volume = 11 |year = 2001 |doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(00)00235-x|s2cid = 16073105 }} < /ref >  There is also a chemical basis for cellular sensitivity to electric and magnetic fields ([[galvanotaxis]]). < ref name=galvanotaxis > {{ cite journal |last1 = Nakajima |first1 = Ken-ichi |last2 = Zhu |first2 = Kan |last3 = Sun |first3 = Yao-Hui |last4 = Hegyi |first4 = Bence |last5 = Zeng |first5 = Qunli |last6 = Murphy |first6 = Christopher J |last7 = Small |first7 = J Victor |last8 = Chen-Izu |first8 = Ye |last9 = Izumiya |first9 = Yoshihiro |last10 = Penninger |first10 = Josef M |last11 = Zhao |first11 = Min |year = 2015 |title = KCNJ15/Kir4.2 couples with polyamines to sense weak extracellular electric fields in galvanotaxis |journal = Nature Communications. |quote = Taken together these data suggest a previously unknown two-molecule sensing mechanism in which KCNJ15/Kir4.2 couples with polyamines in sensing weak electric fields. |doi = 10.1038/ncomms9532|pmid = 26449415 |pages = 8532 |volume = 6 |pmc=4603535|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6.8532N }} < /ref >
