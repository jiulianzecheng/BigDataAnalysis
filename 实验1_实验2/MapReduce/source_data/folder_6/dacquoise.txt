 A '''''dacquoise''''' is a [[dessert]] cake. It is made with layers of [[almond]] and [[hazelnut]] [[meringue]] and [[whipped cream]] or [[buttercream]]. The name comes from the French word ''{{lang|fr|dacquois}}'', meaning  " of Dax " . (Dax is a town in southwestern [[France]].) It is usually served chilled with [[fruit]]. One form of dacquoise is ''[[marjolaine]]''. ''Marjolaine'' is long and rectangular and combines almond and hazelnut meringue layers with chocolate buttercream. 
 
 A classic ''dacquoise'' is made of two layers of a meringue filled with an [[egg yolk|egg-yolk]]-based buttercream. Often, the layers are of a meringue ''japonais''. (Meringue ''japonais'' means there are ground nuts added.) The nuts can be blanched almonds or hazelnuts. While this ''dacquoise'' is based on layers of meringue ''japonais'', it is held together with a mix of sour cream and milk and dark chocolates.
