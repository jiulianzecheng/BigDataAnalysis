 '''Crete''' is the largest of the [[Greece|Greek]] islands. It separates the [[Aegean Sea]] from the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. 
 
 Like the [[Fertile Crescent]], Crete had rich [[soil]], a warm [[climate]], and plenty of [[water]]. < ref name= " berry " > {{cite book|url=|title=History and Geography 603 The Civilizations of Greece and Rome|last=Hofflund, M.A.|first=Ethel|date=|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|isbn=|location=Rock Rapids|pages=|doi=|id=|authorlink=}} < /ref >  With less time spent fighting to live, the Cretans began to make complicated things. From the wild [[crocus]] flowers which covered their island, the Cretans collected [[saffron]] used in [[yellow]] dye, in food, and in medicine. From the [[Egypt]]ians, they received rich cloth and [[jewel]]s. From the Hittites, they learned how to use [[iron]]. From the wealthy Lydians, they learned to use money. From Phoneicia, the Cretans received the alphabet which is used today. 
 
 In various later centuries the island was ruled in turn by ancient Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Venetians, Turks, and modern Greeks.  
 
 == Cretan capital == 
 [[File:Crete location map.png|thumb|left|Greece and Crete]] 
 Cretans chose kings to rule over them for seven years each. The king was known as ''Minos'', and the people ''Minoans''. The capital of Crete was Knossos (nos' us). < ref name=berry/ >  Beautiful friezes (decorating bands) were on the walls. The [[symbol]] of the double-ax was used, and is thought to represent the power of a king. The throne was only a seat with a high back, and the nobles had only benches to sit on. However, the benches were covered with red and white [[plaster]]. On the walls were painted [[fish]], [[dolphin]]s, and [[seaweed]]. The queen had her own private staircase so she could go upstairs without bothering the men. < ref name=berry/ >  Several rooms in the palace had jars which were six feet tall, and were used to keep wheat, oil, dye and other things. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 == Cretan life ==

 === Religion === 
 
 On Crete the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Culture]] started 4700 years ago. < ref > {{Cite web |title= " Ancient Crete "  in Oxford Bibliographies Online: Classics, offers a scholarly guide to the academic literature on this topic. |url=http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 |access-date=2014-09-15 |archive-date=2020-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530225110/https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The palace of Knossos is well-known and is a [[labyrinth]]. Visitors were lost in the labyrinth unless they used a string behind them to find their way back. In this place, it was said that a Minotaur, half bull and half man, lived. Every year seven young men and seven girls were sacrificed to the Minotaur. Many scholars think sacrifices to a bull were made because the Cretans thought the sound of an [[earthquake]] was an angry [[cattle|bull]]. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 The Cretans also worshiped the Great Mother Cybele, or Snake Goddess. < ref name=berry/ >  Often, her picture was carved in statues with gold decorations and with snakes curled around the arms. Snakes were thought to protect houses, so each home had a special room for snakes. < ref name=berry/ >  Sometimes a little table with [[wikt:groove|grooves]] cut into it was put in a comfortable place so snakes could sip some [[milk]] from a cup. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 === Games and art === 
 
 The Cretans loved games, food, athletics, music, and beautiful clothes. They were the first people to build stone theaters where many people were amused by parades and music. Girls could even help bullfighters. In bullfighting, the Minoans did not kill the bull, but the male fighter had to grab the horns of an attacking bull, throw himself on the back of the animal, and then land on the ground; the girl helped the bullfighter keep his balance. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 === Clothes === 
 
 Women wore long, full skirts with very tiny waists, complicated hairstyles, and lots of [[jewelry]]. The men wore small belts around their waists. < ref name=berry/ >  They shaved with stones, rubbed their teeth with [[pumice]] stone, and had their body hair burnt by a barber. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 === Food === 
 
 The Cretans ate [[fish]], [[bird]]s, and [[beef]]. They had barley cooked in many ways and ate lots of cheese, nuts, and honey. They thought only [[wikt:civilized|uncivilized]] people drank [[cattle|cow]]'s [[milk]], so they drank goat's milk instead. < ref name=berry/ >  The Cretans sang, played games, and guessed riddles. Even though they ate with their fingers, they had the food cut into tiny pieces before it was served. < ref name=berry/ > 
 
 == Cretan conquest == 
 
 The Cretans were peaceful people without [[fortification]] < nowiki/ > s to protect them from an attack. In about 1450 B.C., the [[Mycenaean culture|Greek Mycenaeans]] captured Crete, after [[Knossos]], Crete's capital, had been shaken by an [[earthquake]].
