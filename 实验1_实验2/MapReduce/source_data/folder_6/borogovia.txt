'''Borogovia''' (meaning borogove, which is a fictional creature from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s  " [[Jabberwocky]] " ) is a Troodontid from [[late Cretaceous]] [[Mongolia]]. It lived from 70 to 65 million years ago. It was about 6.6 feet (2 meters) long and weighed about as much as a [[beaver]]. Â It is known from hind-limb material, and thought by some to be a species of [[Saurornithoides]]. It had a similar appearance to that of the Dromaeosauridaes.
