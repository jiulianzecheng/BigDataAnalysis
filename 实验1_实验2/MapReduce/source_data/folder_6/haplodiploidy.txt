 '''Haplodiploidy''' is a [[sex determination]] system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are [[haploid]], and females develop from fertilized eggs and are [[diploid]]. < ref > King R.C; Stansfield W.D. and Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p194. {{ISBN|0-19-530761-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Haplodiploidy determines the sex in ''all'' members of the insect order [[Hymenoptera]] ([[bee]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[wasp]]s), and the [[Thysanoptera]] ('thrips'). < ref name=Grimaldi > Grimaldi D. and Engel M.S. 2005. ''The evolution of the insects''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-82149-5}} < /ref > < sup > p408 < /sup > < ref name=White84/ >  The system also occurs sporadically in some spider [[mite]]s, [[coleoptera]]ns (bark [[beetle]]s) and [[rotifer]]s. 
 
 In this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of [[chromosome]]s an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a [[sperm]] and an [[egg (biology)|egg]] develops as a '''female''', and an unfertilized egg develops as a '''male'''. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are [[haploid]]. 
 
 The haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. Most importantly, the [[relatedness]] between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. This means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems. < ref > The relatedness of siblings in most other systems is 0.5. < /ref >  It is this point which drives the [[kin selection]] theory of how [[eusociality]] evolved. < ref name=Grimaldi/ > < sup > p465 < /sup > < ref name=Hamilton > Hamilton W.D. 1964.

 The thing to remember is that in normal [[sexual reproduction]], the father has two sets of chromosomes, and [[crossing over]] takes place between the [[chromatid]]s of each pair during the [[meiosis]] which produces the [[sperm]]. Therefore, ''the sperms are not identical'', because in each chromosome of a pair there will be different [[allele]]s at many of the [[loci]]. But when the father is haploid ''all the sperm will be identical'' (except for a small number where [[gene]] [[mutation]]s have taken place in the [[germline]]). So, ''as long as all the female queen mates only with one male'', all the female offspring will inherit the male's chromosome 100% intact. In fact in Hymenoptera, the males almost all produce enough sperm to last the female for a whole lifetime. < ref name=Hamilton/ > 
 
 Another feature of the haplodiploidy system is that [[Mutation#Deleterious mutations|lethal and deleterious alleles]] will be removed from the population rapidly because they will automatically be expressed in the males. < ref name= " White84 " > {{Cite journal|last=White|first=Michael J.D.|date=January 1984|title=Chromosomal Mechanisms in Animal Reproduction|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11250008409439455|journal=Bolletino di Zoologia|language=en|volume=51|issue=1–2|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/11250008409439455|issn=0373-4137}} < /ref >
