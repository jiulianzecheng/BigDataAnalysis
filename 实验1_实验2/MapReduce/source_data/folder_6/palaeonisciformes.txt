The '''Palaeonisciformes''' (Palaeoniscida) are an extinct order of early [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]]. Palaeonisciformes ''sensu lato'' first appeared in the fossil record in the Late Silurian and last appeared in the Late Cretaceous. The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words παλαιός (''palaiós'', ancient) and ὀνίσκος (''oniskos'', 'cod-fish' or woodlouse), probably pertaining to the organization of the fishes' scales, similar to the exoskeletal plating of [[Sow bug|woodlice]].
