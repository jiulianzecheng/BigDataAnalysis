 A '''grazer''' is an animal, usually a [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]], which eats [[grass]].  It is contrasted with [[browser]]s, which eat trees  &  shrubs.  
 
 The life-style, [[dentition]] (teeth), and [[digestive system]] of grazers is different from browsers, to handle the problems of eating and digesting grass. This is well illustrated in the [[evolution]] of such groups as [[horse]]s. [[Ruminant]]s are the largest group of grazers, though many other animals such as [[giant panda]] < nowiki/ > s also graze. 
 
 When grazers keep eating grass in an area without giving the plants time to grow back, that is called overgrazing.
