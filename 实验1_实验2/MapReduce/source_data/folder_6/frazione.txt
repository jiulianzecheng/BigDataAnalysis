 In [[Italian language|Italian]], '''frazione''' ''(plural'' frazioni) is the name for a [[village]] or [[hamlet]], which is part of a bigger [[commune]]. Very often, frazioni have some [[infrastructure]], such as a [[school]], a [[post office]], or a [[church]]. Many frazioni used to be independent communes in the past, but over time, several have merged to bigger ones.  
 The name is also used in the Swiss canton [[Ticino]], which is Italian-speaking. 
 In [[San Marino]] frazioni are called '''curazie'''.
