 == History == 
 [[File:Nintendo 1889.jpg|thumb|Nintendo's building in 1889]] 
 Nintendo was formed on September 23, 1889. Originally, they were a company that made [[playing cards]]. Then it went on to making [[toy|toys.]] In the 1960s, they started doing other things, such as owning [[hotel]]s. They began making [[video games]] only in the [[1970s]]. In 1980, they came out with a hand-held game device called [[Game and Watch]]. Nintendo's first video game console was the Color TV Game.   
 
 Famicom, Nintendo's second console, was first only released in Japan. It was later released in some other areas, such as North America and Europe. When they released it in there, its name was changed to  " Nintendo Entertainment System " , or NES for short. They also released some popular stand-alone video games, with names like the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', and NES games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Duck Hunt]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. Later, the company made hand-held game consoles such as the [[Game Boy]], [[Nintendo DS|''DS'']], and ''[[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]]'' and home consoles such as [[Nintendo 64]], [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]]. Nintendo later sold newer consoles, and a changing point happened with the Nintendo 64, or N64, which made the first Nintendo 3D games. One of its biggest games is [[Super Mario 64]].

 == Today (current history) == 
 Today, Nintendo has many popular [[fictional character|characters]] and [[series]]. ''[[Super Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' are examples of these. 
 
 Nintendo currently sells the 3DS and the Nintendo Switch. In March 2011 of February 26 2012, Nintendo released their new handheld system in Japan, the United States, and Europe, the Nintendo 3DS. It was the first system to have 3D without special 3D glasses. On the date of July 28 2012, Nintendo released a bigger update called the 3DS XL. The 3DS XL had a new anti-glare screen, a top screen that was 90% bigger than the old 3DS, and had a matte plastic finish instead of a glossy metal one. This meant that scratches and fingerprints could not be seen as easily, but it can be broken more easily and it is not as durable. The successor to the Wii U, the Nintendo Switch, released on March 3, 2017 in Japan, the United States, and Europe. The Nintendo Switch is unique in the sense that it can be played on both a TV and on the go. The Switch can be played on the TV by sliding the tablet into its dock and removing the two controllers on the side of the tablet to create a more traditional controller.
