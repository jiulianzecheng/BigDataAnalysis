 Countryliner was a bus company in Uckfield in England. It was a big bus company driving more than fifty bus services and with buses mostly in Sussex. The company closed on the 18th of January 2013 under a new bus operating licence called SwiftBus Limited that was before that known as the RJB (UK) Limited licence. The main Countryliner company closed on the 8th of October 2012  < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.countryliner-coaches.co.uk/buses.html | title=Countryliner-coaches, UK Surrey }} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite web | url=https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/05080490 | title=RJB (UK) LIMITED overview - Find and update company information - GOV.UK }} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite web | url=https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08089456 | title=SWIFTBUS LIMITED overview - Find and update company information - GOV.UK }} < /ref > 
 ==Closure== 
 The Countryliner company got involved in a Surrey County Council public inquiry which wanted to ask people what they thought about Countryliner. Countryliner was in quite a lot of debt, so they paid it off to try and fix the company and stop it from closing. But sadly, the company got closed anyway because of high MOT fails with most of their buses. 
 ==Sunray Travel== 
 Countryliner still existed through Sunray Travel when Sunray Travel started to drive service 479 Guildford-Epsom commercially (without county support with money) using old Countryliner buses without Countryliner stickers. 
 ==Fleet== 
 Countryliner used a mixture of Plaxton Pointer Dennis Darts, MAN 12.220 MCV Evolutions, Optare Excels, Plaxton Premieres and more for their bus and school services.
