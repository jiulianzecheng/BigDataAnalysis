 '''Emigration''' is leaving one's [[country]] or area to go live in another. Emigration (leaving) from one country is usually followed by [[Immigration]] (coming into) into another. The difference between the two is the [[wikt:perspective|perspective]] (or point of view) of which country a person is leaving and which country they are going to. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.diffen.com/difference/Emigrate_vs_Immigrate |title=Emigrate vs. Immigrate |author= |website= |publisher= Diffen.com|accessdate=28 April 2015}} < /ref >

 == Reasons == 
 Emigration happens for different reasons: 
 * People think that they benefit from moving elsewhere, because they have a better job, or they have a better chance of economic success, or they are economically better off. This kind of migration is generally called [[economic migration]]. < ref > Joel P. Trachtman, ''The International Law of Economic Migration: Toward the Fourth Freedom'' (Kalamazoo, MI: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, 2009), pp. 4–5 < /ref > 
 * The [[climate]], or climatic events force people to move. Climatic events include [[flood|floods]], [[drought|droughts]], [[earthquake|earthquakes]] and [[Volcanic eruption|volcanic eruptions]].  This kind of migration is generally known as [[environmental migration]]. < ref > Étienne Piguet; Antoine Pécoud, ''Migration and Climate Change'' (Paris: UNESCO Pub.; Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 2 < /ref >  As an example, people left [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]], on the Island of [[Montserrat]], after a series of volcanic eruptions in 1995. 
 * People have disadvantages where they live, often because they have special views or opinions, or they disagree with the majority or those in power.  Often they face [[persecution]], for example because of special [[Religion|religious]] views or because they belong to an [[ethnic group]]. Many people emigrated from Europe to what was the  " [[New World]] "  because they had [[Religion|religious]] beliefs that were different from the majority. < ref > Michael H. Crawford, Benjamin C. Campbell, ''Causes and Consequences of Human Migration: An Evolutionary Perspective'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 299 < /ref > 
 * People who emigrate (or flee) from one country to another, for reasons including armed conflicts or [[war|wars]] are usually called [[refugee|refugees]], once they arrive in another country. < ref > Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ''The State of the World's Refugees, 2000: Fifty Years of Humanitarian Action'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 1–2 < /ref > 
 * Very often people move to where the rest of their family lives. < ref > Steven J. Gold; Stephanie J. Nawyn, ''Handbook of International Migration'' (London; New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 283 < /ref > 
 [[International law]] handles the different groups of migrants differently.
