'''Precocial''' in biology is a [[development]]al [[strategy]]. It refers to [[species]] in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of [[birth]] or [[wikt:hatch|hatching]]. It applies mainly to [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s.  
 
 The opposite developmental strategy is called [[altricial]], where the young are born or hatched helpless. These two categories are at ends of a continuum. All degrees exist in birds and mammals. With the tiny eggs of [[invertebrate]]s, different strategies have evolved. Many use some kind of [[metamorphosis]], in which different stages of growth occupy different environmental [[niche]]s. 
 
 == Checklist == 
 A checklist is used to score a species between precocial and altricial. In each case, 'yes' means precocial: 
 #[[Down]] or [[fur]] present? 
 #Eyes open? 
 #Mobile? 
 #Feed themselves? 
 #Parents present? 
 
 == Birds == 
 The contrast between the two extremes is seen most clearly in birds. Precocial species leave the [[nest]] shortly after birth or hatching. [[Megapode]]s are a family of birds found in [[Australasia]]. Their eggs are not [[incubate]]d by the parents. They are buried in [[compost]], covered with sand and left, though the males test the [[temperature]] of the heap and make small adjustments. The eggs, which have a large yolk, hatch with full wing feathers. The hatchlings can run and purse prey, and many species can fly on their first day. < ref > Starck J.M.  &  Sutter E. 2000. Patterns of growth and heterochrony in moundbuilders (Megapodiidae) and fowl (Phasianidae). ''J. Avian Biol''. '''31''', 527-547. < /ref >  These birds are super-precocial. 
 
 At the other extreme are the most intelligent birds: the [[passerine]]s (the dominant group of birds, including [[crow]]s) and [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[parrot]]s. 
 
 == Mammals == 
 Mammals never feed themselves at first. Mother's milk is part of the 'contract' a mammal inherits. But there is a big difference between some new-born [[deer]] and [[antelope]]s, which can run within an hour or so of birth, and a baby [[marsupial]] which is in the [[pouch]] for days or weeks. 
 
 Of advanced mammals, human beings have a long period before they are independent. This is partly because their [[brain]]s have to grow and mature after birth, and partly because humans depend more on [[learning]] and less on inherited behaviour compared to other mammals. Mammalian [[carnivores]] take a long time to perfect their  [[prey]]-catching skills, and some herd species like [[elephant]]s also have to do a lot of learning. 
 
 == Trade-offs ==  
 Most accounts of the altricial/precocial differences point out that it is a trade-off. < ref name=Ehrlich > Ehrlich, Paul R; Dobkin, David S.  &  Wheye, Darryl 1988. ''Precocial and altricial young''. [http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Precocial_and_Altricial.html] < /ref >  Altricial young require a great investment of parental time and care, and are in constant danger of [[predation]]. However, that system permits a long period of supervised learning. Also, their brains grow more after birth, fueled by rich food provided by parents. 
 
 Precocial young require more pre-birth preparation for larger eggs, but they are less open to predation and take less parental care after birth. Their brains are ready-to-go, but end up smaller in relation to body size. 
 
 : " Why have these different modes of development evolved? They are obviously tied into two important aspects of the bird's environment: food availability and predation pressure... 
 
 : " a complex evolutionary problem of balancing the need to provide nourishment to the young and to protect them from predation has been 'solved' by each group of birdsâ€“and the solutions are the different avian developmental patterns we now observe. Similar problems have been solved, also in diverse ways, in the course of mammalian evolution. But many more groups of mammals than birds have managed to become big-brained as both young and adults " . < ref name=Ehrlich/ > 
 
 === Humans === 
 Humans are rather a special case, for a baby makes great demands on the parent both before and after birth. A human baby looks precocial. But few of the bits are working, and a baby is completely helpless on its own. The key fact is that the [[cerebral cortex]] is not yet working properly. [[Nerve]] growth is still going on. During the first 18 months the cortex is getting larger and getting into working order. Then, after about 18 months to two years, the infant starts to learn [[language]] and from then on there's no stopping them. 
 
 There is an interesting reason why the brain is not more advanced at birth. It is that the baby's head (during natural [[birth]]) has to get through the female birth canal, which is a space between the bones of the female [[pelvis]]. Any larger, and the baby's head would not get through. 
 
 There is a cost to the human method. It greatly reduces the average number of offspring that any couple can raise. < ref name=Paul > Ehrlich, Paul R; Dobkin, David S.  &  Wheye, Darryl 1988. ''Parental care''. [http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Parental_Care.html] < /ref >
