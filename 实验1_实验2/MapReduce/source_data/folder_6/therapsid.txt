 '''Therapsids''', previously known as the [[mammal-like reptile]]s, < ref > They are '''''not''''' reptiles. < /ref >  are a group of [[synapsid]]s.  
 
 The [[clade]] includes the [[mammal]]s, which are descended from the [[cynodont]] therapsids. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The jaws of therapsids had frontal [[incisor]]s for nipping, large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing, and [[molar]]s for shearing and tearing, and molars for shearing and chopping food.  
 
 Therapsid legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of [[Sauropsid]]s and [[Pelycosaur]]s. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 The therapsids were seriously affected by the [[P/Tr extinction event]]. The successful [[gorgonopsia]]ns died out, and the remaining groups were much reduced.  
 
 The [[dicynodont]]s were now a single family of large stocky herbivores, the Kannemeyeridae. The medium-sized cynodonts (including carnivorous and herbivorous forms), flourished worldwide in the early to middle [[Triassic]]. They died out across much of [[Pangea]] before the end of the Upper Triassic. Some survived for a while in the wet equatorial band and in the South. 
 
 At least three groups of eucynodonts survived. They appeared in the [[Upper Triassic]]. The extremely mammal-like family, the [[Tritylodont]]s, survived into the [[Lower Cretaceous]]. Another group, ''[[Morganucodon]]'' and its relatives, were [[mammaliaformes]]. That is, their descendants became the mammals.
