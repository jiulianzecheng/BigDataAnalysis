 '''Nucleoplasm''' is the contents of the [[cell nucleus]]. It is the [[protoplasm]] inside the [[nuclear membrane]]. 
 
 It includes  
 *many smaller molecules, and water 
 *large molecules such as [[enzymes]] of many types, and [[nucleotides]] 
 *larger [[organelle]]s such as the [[chromosomes]] and the [[nucleoli]] 
 *A network of nucleolar channels makes a continuous chain between the nucleoplasm and the inner parts of the nucleolus. [[Ribosomes]] made in the nucleolus get sent to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] in the cytoplasm. 
 
 The main role of the nucleoplasm is to keep the chromosomes  separate from the cell cytoplasm, and support the [[translation (genetics)|translating]] of [[DNA]] to [[RNA]]
