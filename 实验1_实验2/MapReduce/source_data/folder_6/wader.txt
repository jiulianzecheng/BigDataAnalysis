 '''Wader''' is a common term in [[ornithology]] for birds which walk about in [[wikt:shallow|shallow]] water. Sometimes they are called [[shore-birds]]. They are members of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Charadriiformes]], which are water birds. The Charadriiformes also includes [[Marine biology|marine]]-going [[seabird]]s with [[webbed feet]]. The [[evolution]]ary relationships of these birds are very complicated. < ref > Ericson P.G.P. ''et al'' 2003.

 Most waders live in [[wetland]] or [[coast]]al [[environments]].  Many species of [[Arctic]] and [[temperate]] regions are strongly [[migration|migratory]], but [[tropical]] birds are often resident. Some of the Arctic species, such as [[little stint]], are amongst the longest distance migrants, spending the non-[[breeding season]] in the [[southern hemisphere]]. 
 
 Most species eat small [[invertebrate]]s picked out of [[mud]] or exposed [[soil]]. Different lengths of bills allow different species to feed in the same habitat without direct competition for food. Many waders have sensitive nerve endings at the end of their bills which let them detect prey hidden in mud or soft soil. Some larger species, especially those adapted to drier habitats, take larger prey like [[insect]]s and small [[reptiles]]. 
 
 Many of the smaller species found in coastal habitats are often called  " [[sandpiper]]s " . The smallest member of this group is the [[least sandpiper]], small adults of which can weigh as little as 15.5 grams and measure just over 13 & nbsp;cm (5 & nbsp;inches). The largest species is believed to be the [[Far Eastern curlew]], at about 63 & nbsp;cm (25 & nbsp;inches) and 860 grams (1.9 & nbsp;lb), although the [[beach thick-knee]], is the heaviest at about 1 & nbsp;kg (2.2 & nbsp;lb).
