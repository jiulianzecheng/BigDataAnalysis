A Brigade is a military unit in an army. Currently in most armies, a Brigade is made up of several thousand soldiers in several Battalions plus a Brigade Headquarters. This is common in the United States Army. Before [[World War II]], a brigade had several regiments. The United States Army has several types of brigades. These brigades have usually a Headquarters Company and usually several battalions.   
 
 An artillery brigade in the United States Army has a Headquarters Battery and several battalions from different Artillery regiments. Each battalion in a United States Army Artillery Brigade may have High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and/or Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) Units assigned to it.  
 
 Depending on the country an army brigade is under the command of a Brigadier General, Brigadier or Colonel.
