There are some materials which offer some [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] to the current flow; they are not good [[Electrical conductor]] < nowiki/ > s or good [[Electrical insulator]] < nowiki/ > s. They are resistive materials, for example graphite, iron, and certain synthetic materials. 
 
 The magnitude that represents this characteristic is the resistance, and it is measured in ohms. An '''ohm''' (referred to by the Greek letter  & #937; ([[Omega (letter)|Omega]])) is the [[SI]] unit of resistance (R). It can be defined by [[Ohm's Law|Ohm's law]] and the equation:  
 : < math > R= V/I < /math > 
 where  < math display= " inline " > R < /math >  is [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] in ohms,  < math display= " inline " > V < /math >  is voltage in [[volt]]s, and  < math display= " inline " > I < /math >  the current in [[ampere]]s. 
 
 The ohm was named after [[Georg Ohm]].
