 '''Blackletter''' or '''Gothic script''' is an old way to write. Blackletter in [[writing]] or [[printing|print]] was used in [[Western Europe]] from about 1150 to the 17th century. It was used for printing in [[Germany]] until the 20th century. 
 
 Letter shapes in printing were copied from letter shapes in a style of [[handwriting]]. So, the Gothic script of northern Europe and the Latin script used in Italy were both copied into print [[typography]]. 
 
 == The name ''Gothic'' script == 
 Some people call blackletter [[Old English]]. This is not right, because Old English is a language, not a script, and many centuries older. Also ''Gothic'' script has nothing to do with the [[Goths]]. They lived in central Europe from the 3rd to 6th century and wrote in [[rune]]s. Blackletter must not be confused either with the ancient Gothic alphabet or with the [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]]s that are also sometimes called ''Gothic''. 
 
 The term ''Gothic'' was first used to describe this script in fifteenth century [[Italy]], in the midst of the [[Renaissance]]. Scholars thought it was a [[barbarian|barbaric]] script: ''Gothic'' was a synonym for ''barbaric''.  
 
 Not only were blackletter forms called ''Gothic script'', but any other seemingly barbarian script was also labeled  " Gothic " . In contrast, the humanists preferred the [[Carolingian minuscule]], a highly [[legibility|legible]] script. They called it ''littera antiqua'',  " the ancient letter " , believing that it was the script used by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. But actually it was invented in the reign of [[Charlemagne]]. 
 
 ==Origins== 
 [[Carolingian minuscule]] was the direct and linear ancestor of blackletter. Blackletter came from Carolingian when Europe in the twelfth century needed new books in many different subjects when more and more people learned to read. New [[university|universities]] were founded, each writing books for [[business]], [[law]], [[grammar]], [[history]], and other topics, not only religious books, where earlier scripts were used. 
 
 These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand. Carolingian, though legible, was time-consuming and labour-intensive to produce. It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a [[manuscript]] in a time when writing materials were very costly. As early as the eleventh century, different forms of Carolingian were already being used, and by the mid-twelfth century, a clearly distinguishable form, able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books, was being used in north-eastern [[France]] and the [[Low Countries]].
