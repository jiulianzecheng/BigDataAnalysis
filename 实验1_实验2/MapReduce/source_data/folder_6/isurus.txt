 '''''Isurus''''', commonly known as the '''mako sharks''', is a [[genus]] of fast-swimming sharks in the family [[Lamnidae]]. They are in fact the fastest-swimming shark. < ref > ''Shark'': BBC tv, first instalment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02n7s0d] < /ref >  This is in the same [[family (biology)|family]] as the [[great white shark]]. ''Isurus'' ranges in length from {{convert|2.5|to|4.5|m|ft|0}}, and can grow to about {{convert|800|kg|-1}}. The genus has a long fossil history. < ref > {{cite journal| last = Sepkoski| first = Jack| title = A compendium of fossil marine animal genera (Chondrichthyes entry)| journal = Bulletins of American Paleontology| volume = 364| page = 560| date = 2002| url = http://strata.ummp.lsa.umich.edu/jack/showgenera.php?taxon=575 & rank=class| accessdate = 2008-01-09| archive-date = 2012-05-10| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120510170834/http://strata.ummp.lsa.umich.edu/jack/showgenera.php?taxon=575 & rank=class| url-status = dead}} < /ref > 
 
 There are two living [[species]] in this genus: the common shortfin mako shark and the rare longfin mako shark.  
 
 == Species == 
 
 === Shortfin mako shark === 
 The shortfin mako shark, as the name suggests, has smaller [[pectoral fin]]s to the Longfin mako shark. The shortfin mako shark also has smaller [[eye]]s. It is smaller than the Longfin mako shark, reaching a maximum length of 3.8 metres, but weighs more, with the heaviest shortfin mako shark found weighing 506 kg (1116 pounds).  < ref name= " FLMNH " / >   
 
 The shortfin mako has a wide distribution, being found in [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] waters throughout the world's [[ocean]]s. It is a true [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[species]], but it inhabits the cooler, deeper water of tropical regions. The shortfin mako shark has been recorded at depths of up to 740 metres.  < ref name= " FLMNH " / >   
 
 The shortfin mako is the fastest species of shark known, reaching speeds of up to 32 km/h (20 mph),  < ref name= " FLMNH " >  {{Cite web|title=FLMNH Ichthyology Department|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/|work=flmnh.ufl.edu|accessdate=11 July 2013}}  < /ref >  and with bursts of up to {{convert|74|km/h|mph}}. < ref name=Martin > {{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/shark_profiles/i_oxyrinchus.htm|title=Biology of the Shortfin Mako|publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research|accessdate=2006-08-12|author=R. Aidan Martin}} < /ref >  Its great speed helps it to capture other fast swimming [[animal]]s on which it preys. The shortfin mako shark feeds on pelagic fish such as [[swordfish]], [[tuna]]s, and other [[shark]]s, as well as [[squid]].  < ref name= " FLMNH " / >   The shortfin mako holds the record for the longest distance travel: about {{convert|2130|km}} in 37 days. This is an average of about {{convert|58|km}} per day. < ref name= " FLMNH " / >   
 
 Shortfin mako often leap in sets of three. The third leap is usually the highest. It can reach as high as {{convert|5|-|6|m}} above the surface. < ref name=Martin/ >  This high-leaping fish is a highly sought-after [[game fish]] worldwide. There are cases when an angry shortfin jumped into a boat after it was hooked. < ref > {{Cite web|title=A Pattern of Islands {{!}} NZETC|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-GriPatt.html|access-date=2021-06-04|website=nzetc.victoria.ac.nz}} < /ref > 
 
 === Longfin mako shark === 
 The longfin mako shark has longer [[pectoral fin]]s and larger [[eye]]s than the shortfin shark. It is longer than the shortfin, reaching a maximum length of 4.2 metres. However, it weighs less than the shortfin, weighing up to only 70 kg (154 pounds). 
 
 The longfin mako is a [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] [[species]], and is found in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is common in the western Atlantic and central Pacific, but elsewhere it is rare. It is thought to be a bottom-dwelling [[shark]], living in [[tropical]] and warm [[temperate]] waters, but this is uncertain. 
 
 Not a lot is known about the Longfin mako shark's feeding habits, but it is thought to feed on schooling [[fish]] and pelagic [[cephalopod]]s.  < ref name= " FLMNH " / >
