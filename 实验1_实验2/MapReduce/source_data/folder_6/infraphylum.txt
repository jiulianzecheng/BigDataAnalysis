An '''infraphylum''' is a rank in the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] of biological groups. Normally the ranks go [[phylum]]  >  [[class (biology)|class]]  >  [[order (biology)|order]] etc. However, sometimes extra steps are needed. If so, an infraphylum ranks immediately below a [[subphylum]], and above a class.
