 '''''Montanoceratops''''' (meaning  " Montana horned face " ) was a [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]], walked on four legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a [[parrot]]-like [[beak]], a small nose horn, [[cheek]] teeth, and a small frill on its head. Males may have had larger frills than females, indicating that the frill may have been used in courtship and mating.
