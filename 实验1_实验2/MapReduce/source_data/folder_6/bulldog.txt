 The '''bulldog''', known as the '''British Bulldog''' or '''English Bulldog''', is a medium-size [[breed]] of [[dog]] from [[England]]. 
 
 ==Description== 
 Bulldogs are medium in size, and they are wide and compact with large, thick heads. Their muzzle (nose and mouth) is short, like a pug's. They have stocky legs at each corner of their muscular body, so when they walk, they take short steps and swing their body from side to side.  
 
 Their [[fur]] comes in many colors, including light brown, white, black or mixed ([[brindle]]). Black is not a desired color at dog shows, but black bulldogs can compete. The bulldog is recognized by the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC).  
 
 Bulldogs are good family [[pet]]s. They are also brave and are good [[guard dog]] < nowiki/ > s. Bulldogs need a lot of human attention to be happy. They do not need much exercise or grooming except for the face, which should be wiped daily in the face folds with a damp cloth. They weigh {{convert|53|-|55|lb|kg}}. They are {{convert|12|-|16|in|cm}} tall at the shoulders. 
 
 The bulldog was originally [[Breed|bred]] to fight [[bull]]s during the [[1600s]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.ranker.com/list/history-of-the-name-bulldog/nicky-benson|title=The History of the Name  " Bulldog "  is Far More Horrifying Than You Can Even Imagine|publisher=Ranker|accessdate=June 26, 2020}} < /ref >  The dog's mouth is made to bite a [[bull]]'s nose and not let go.
