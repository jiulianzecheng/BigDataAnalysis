'''Electrolysis''' is a [[science|scientific]] way of 'splitting'  [[substance]]s. It means 'electric-splitting'  and involves the separation of substances through an [[electric current]].  
 
 [[Metals]] above [[carbon]] in the [[reactivity series]] ([[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[lithium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]) are extracted by electrolysis. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Electrolysis is used in the [[mining]] industry to split reactive [[metal]]s from their [[ore]]s after they are taken from the ground. [[Electroplating]] is also used to plate (cover) things with metal because it costs less than using, for example, solid gold to make [[jewellery]]. 
 
 Many [[beauty shop]]s use electrolysis or [[electrology]] to remove [[hair]]. This is done by  " electrocuting "  the hair so it splits along its [[root]]. 
 
 Electrolysis makes the [[anion]]s (negative [[ion]] < nowiki/ > s) go to the [[anode]] (positive [[electrode]]) and the [[cation]]s (positive [[ion]]s) go to the [[cathode]] (negative electrode). So, for example, [[oxygen]] would go to the anode and iron would go to the cathode.
