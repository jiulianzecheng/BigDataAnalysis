 '''''Seymouria''''' was an [[amphibian]] [[tetrapod]] from the early [[Permian]] of [[North America]] and [[Europe]], about 280 to 270 million years ago (mya). It was small, only 2 & nbsp;ft (60 & nbsp;cm) long.  
 
 As an adult animal, ''Seymouria'' was well [[adapted]] to life on land, with many [[reptile|reptilian]] features. It was for quite a long time thought to be a primitive reptile. It is now known that its early life stages were in water. Apparently, it is an ''amphibian'' whose adult stage was adapted for life in a dry climate. 
 
 The discovery of its amphibian nature was a considerable surprise. 
 : " ... the discovery of larval stages... demonstrated conclusively that the seymouriamorphs were not biologically [[amniote]]s " . < ref name=Carroll > Carroll, Robert 2009. ''The rise of amphibians: 365 million years of evolution''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, p163 (left-hand column). < /ref >  Fossil larvae have been found of three related [[genera]], from the [[Upper Carboniferous]] and Lower [[Permian]] of five [[Europe]]an countries. < ref name=Carroll/ > 
 : " It has been shown conclusively that seymouriamorphs had an amphibian-type life history, with aquatic young stages that lost their external [[gills]] after [[metamorphosis]].... Seymouriamorphs were definitely not [[amniote]]s themselves " . < ref > Clack, Jennifer 2012. ''Gaining ground: the origin and evolution of tetrapods''. 2nd ed, Indiana University Press. Seymouriamorphs p353/6; quote: p356. < /ref >  This means they were ''not'' reptiles. 
 
 The adult skeletons were first found in the [[red beds]] of [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. These beds were laid down in the huge [[delta]] complex of a large river flowing towards a [[coast]], much like the [[Mississippi]] of today. < ref name=Carroll/ >  The species found in [[Germany]] and [[New Mexico]], ''Seymouria sanjuanensis'', had massive legs and held its body well off the ground. This shows an  " effective adaptation to terrestrial locomotion " . < ref name=Carroll/ > 
 
 A simplified [[life cycle]] might be: eggs laid in water, larval stages in water, young animal with limbs climbs out and instinctively moves to higher ground. All its life lived as a carnivore on dry land, returning to water occasionally to drink and to breed. The adults would be able to operate in a fairly dry climate.
