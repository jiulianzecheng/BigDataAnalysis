This text was widely used by Uyghur Manichaeans and has been preserved in many manuscripts and fragments.

 == Language == 
 The book is written in Turkic using the {{ill|Old Uyghur alphabet|en}}. It is easy to understand because the language is clear and pure. The author or translator didn't use many special Manichaean words, and the sentences are simple. Anyone who can read could understand the text. The writer of the book may have known Buddhist texts with similar content and structure, < ref > Так называемые «Книги для покаяния» — «Kšanti qïlγuluq nom» < /ref >  which were read aloud during special ceremonies to get rid of sins. There are also [[Iranic languages|Iranic]] structures in the book. For example,  " manastar hïrz-a "  is used to complete each section, which means  " let go of my sin. " 
 
 == Content == 
 The text has 15 parts and an ending. Each part is a request to God with a formal confession and a plea for forgiveness for a specific sin. 
 
 # In the first part of the text, it tells a story about a [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] battle between good and evil forces. {{ill|Qormusta Tengri|en|lt=Hormuzta}}, < ref > В других манихейских текстах — Первый человек (Mardohm hasenag. Через посредство буддийской литературы отождествлялся с [[Индра|Индрой]]. < /ref >  along with five other deities ([[aether]], wind, light, water, and fire), his sons, < ref > В иранских текстах отождествляются с [[Зороастризм#Амешаспенты|Амэша-Спэнта]] < /ref >  led the forces of light against Shimnu ({{ill|Angra Mainyu|en}}), who represented darkness. Due to the mixing of light and darkness, people forgot the difference between them and started believing that God gives both life and death or that Hormuzta and Shimnu are brothers, which is not true. This is the first sin confessed in the text. 
 # The second sin is disrespect towards the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]], also known as the  " Two Bright Palaces " . In Manichaeism, these luminaries were believed to be divine, eternal, and pure, moving according to God's will and made up of a pure soul. After death, the souls of the righteous were thought to pass through the Moon, which was like a  " small ship " , < ref > Наполнение Луны частицами светлых душ вызывает лунные фазы по манихейским представлениям. < /ref >  and then to the Sun, which was like a  " Big ship " . From there, they would return to the immaterial Kingdom of Light. To view the luminaries as just part of the material world or natural occurrences that lack a will is the second confessed sin. 
 # The third wrongdoing confessed is harming the five deities, which includes harming any living creatures, dry and damp earth, grass, and trees. The Manicheans believed in two sets of five gods. The first set consists of the sons of the First Man: Ether, wind, light, water, and fire. The second set consists of the five sons of the Holy Spirit, who was sent by God to save particles of light from the kingdom of darkness. The Holy Spirit's work resulted in the formation of the material world -  " eight lands and ten heavens " . The five sons of the Holy Spirit are Light holder, Great King of Honor, Adamant of Light, King of Glory, and Omophorus. They protect the world from decay. It is unclear from the text if the author differentiates between these two sets of gods. 
 # The fourth sin is about going against the Burkhans, which is a term used by the Buddhist Uyghurs to refer to [[Buddha]], and by the Manicheans to refer to the heads of the Manichaean church. The confession also includes a sin against the  " Elect " , who were the hierarchs of the church that took special vows. This sin is about not believing, rejecting, contradicting, or withholding their preaching. 
 # The fifth sin is about harming living beings, which is separate from the third sin that is against the gods. It includes causing harm to all types of creatures: those with two legs, four legs, wings, those that live in water, and those that crawl on their belly. The Manichaean asks for forgiveness for causing their death, fear, beating, scourging, torment, and pain. 
 # The sixth sin is related to human communication. It encompasses spreading lies, making false oaths, committing perjury, persecuting the innocent, spreading gossip, engaging in slander, witchcraft, being deceitful, using cunning, causing delusion, making mistakes, and any other actions that are disapproved by the deities. 
 # The seventh sin is related to following false teachings and worshipping unclean forces. This involves practicing human and animal sacrifices, as well as engaging in other impure rituals. 
 # The eighth sin is a departure from the qualities of a devoted Manichean: love is the sign of the god {{ill|Zurvan|de}}, < ref > Ezrua Tngri Уйгурские манихеи отождествляли Зервана c [[Брахма (буддизм)|Брахмой]], известного им через буддийские сутры < /ref >  faith is the sign of the Sun and Moon, fear is the sign of the five deities, wisdom is the sign of the Burkhans. Departure from these virtues - signs of deities was confessed. 
 # The ninth sin is the breaking of the ten commandments that the regular Manichaeans followed. They are called hearers. The actual text of the commandments hasn't been found in any known Manichaean text, but an-Nadim lists them as follows: 1. Rejecting [[idolatry]], 2. Refraining from lying, 3. Not being greedy, 4. Refraining from murder, 5. Refraining from adultery, 6. Not stealing, 7. Not cheating, 8. Not practicing or learning magic, 9. Do not be doublefaced{{Efn|Do not have two opinions}}, 10. Not being lazy in work. 
 # The tenth sin involves the Manichaean prayer. [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] instructed his followers to pray to God four times a day. Forgetting to pray, being distracted during prayer, and making other mistakes while praying are considered sins. 
 # The eleventh sin is related to the unwillingness to donate to the Manichaean church. According to the teachings, Manichaean believers receive the  " light "  of the five deities and the gods [[Xroshtag and Padvaxtag]]. < ref > Эти боги по сути олицетворение «Призыва»-Хрёштаг Живого духа к Первому человеку и Ответа или Услышанья-Падвахтаг Первого человека. Они примыкают к пятёркам богов. < /ref >  Being stingy in donations was considered equivalent to stealing the light of the Manichaean teachings. 
 # The twelfth sin is when a Manichaean breaks the fasts called vusanti. < ref > Скорее всего от буддийского uposatha < /ref >  These fasts occur for 50 days every year and were mandatory for Manichaean hearers. 
 # The thirteenth sin involves failing to participate in the Manichaean confession held in the community every Monday. The confession involved the Manichaean priest reading a text, and the laity responding in unison. 
 # The fourteenth sin was about Manichaeans not participating in the celebration of the  " yemki "  holidays in honor of the seven heads of the Manichaean church, < ref > У западных манихеев этот праздник неизвестен и считается относительно поздним. < /ref >  as well as the main Manichaean holiday called  " čaydanta "  or  " Bema "  in Greek. The latter was celebrated in [[March]] to commemorate the execution of Mani, and involved a communal meal and a collective confession of sins committed over the past year. 
 # The fifteenth sin was committing actions, words, or thoughts that pleased the demons. These sinful deeds caused the  " light "  of the Manichaean teachings to flow from the believer to the evil spirits. Confession was necessary for this sin. 
 
 Lines 143 to 160 contain a short list of sins and a request for forgiveness.
