 '''Ungdomshuset''' (in English:  " the Youth House " ) was the popular name of the building formally named '''Folkets Hus''' ( " House of the People " ) on Jagtvej 69 in [[Nørrebro]], [[Copenhagen]]. The Ungdomshuset was a meeting point for many [[anarchist]]s, for the music in the [[underground scene]] and [[leftist]] groups from 1982 until 2007, when after a long [[conflict]] between the municipal government of Copenhagen and the people living there, was smashed. Police started to clear the building early on Thursday, [[1 March]] [[2007]]. Demolition began on [[5 March]] [[2007]] and was completed two days later. Ever since the [[eviction]] in March 2007, former users and supporters have held weekly demonstrations for a [[new Ungdomshuset]], the demonstrations starting from nearby square 'Blågårds Plads' every Thursday at 5 p.m. and going to various places in Copenhagen. The starting point has recently been changed to Gammel Torv in response to the demonstraters saying they are getting closer to the politicians concerning a solution for a new Ungdomshus at an old school.In the summer of 2007, an initiative known as G13 wanted to squat an old public [[waterwork]] on Grøndalsvænge Allé 13 in northwestern Copenhagen to be used as a [[new Ungdomshuset]], the squat was non-violent, but was met with heavy opposition from the police who arrested 436 people and threw large amounts of [[tear gas]] 
 
 == History == 
 The building was completed on [[12 November]] [[1897]], with the name  " Folkets Hus "  (''The People's House''). The house functioned as one of the resorts for the then-incipient [[labour movement]] of Copenhagen. Since labour organisations were unpopular in the eyes of the authorities. Years later the place helped poor people and was used for others uses. In 1918 when workers stormed the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange|Danish Stock Exchange]] (''Børsen''). In 1910, The [[Second International]] held an International Women's conference at the house, during which [[Clara Zetkin]] launched the idea of an [[International Women's Day]]. [[Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] visited the centre. During the 1950s it was still primarily used by the different sections, associations and unions of the labour movement. All kinds of different activities took place: for example, boxing matches and end-of-season dances. Several years later [[Brugsen]], a Danish chain of [[co-operative]] [[supermarket]]s, bought Folkets Hus, for making a cheap supermarket. However, as this was prohibited by authorities for the historic importance of the place, so Brugsen sold the ground to the folk music [[ensemble]] [[Tingluti]] in [[1978]]. The Tingluti sold the ground to the municipality of Copenhagen after few time.The price at the time was [[DKK]] 700,000. In 1982 Folkets Hus was assigned to a group of young people — the original founders of Ungdomshuset — however the municipality of Copenhagen still owned the building. It was at this time that the building was given its current name: Ungdomshuset. [[Nick Cave]] and [[Björk]] played there. In January 1996 Ungdomshuset was ravaged by a fire. It also had [[fungus]] and [[rot]]. The municipality of Copenhagen made plans to renovate the building for safety reasons, but encountered resistance from the occupants. In 1999 the building was put on sale to the highest [[bidder]] by the municipality, but at the same time occupants opposed to the thing, and for jokingly put over the building a large [[banner]] with the message '' " For sale along with 500 [[Autonomism|autonome]], stone throwing, violent psychopaths from hell. " ''. After that a company called [[Human A/S]] bought the building in December 2000 (although ownership did not actually change hands until 2001), after which Human A/S was sold to the independent Christian sect  " [[Faderhuset]]. However, the squatters refused to leave the house. Until [[1 March]] [[2007]] the young squatters used the house as if the change of ownership had not happened and the new owners were not allowed inside at any time. The ''Ungdomshuset'' received more than 500 visitors a week.

 A women's demonstration took place on 8 March, comprising more than 3 000 people. The police carried out systematic [[identity controls]]. In total, more than 750 people were arrested during the events (among them, about 140 foreigners). On [[March 16|16 March]], [[2007]], Danish police admitted to having mistakenly used a potentially lethal form of teargas. The gas, known as [[Ferret 40]], was used against crowds during the riots following the demolition, although it is designed to penetrate doors and walls. < ref name= " ferret40 " > [http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/03/16/194616.htm?nyheder Politiet brugte livsfarlig tåregas], ''dr.dk'' 16 March 2007 {{in lang|da}}. < /ref > 
 
 According to professor Lars Dencik, from the [[University of Roskilde]], the Danish state used the opportunity of this evacuation to test its [[anti-terrorist]] security forces (as any other opportunity, or real danger, was non-existent).
