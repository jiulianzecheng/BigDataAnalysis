 '''Pirelli  &  C. SpA''' is a diverse (it does many things) company based in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. It operates in many countries. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Pirelli was founded 1872 in [[Milan]] by Giovanni Battista Pirelli. Pirelli initially worked in [[rubber]] and related processes. The company used to make scuba diving rebreathers (a special type of underwater breathing machine). < ref name=rebreather > {{cite journal |author=Coates, JK; Kincaid, TC; Lanphier, EH |title=Evaluation of the Pirelli Underwater Oxygen Breathing Equipment for Use in the Naval Service. |journal=Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-RR-2-52 |year=1952 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3393 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |archive-date=2014-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008071454/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/3393 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Pirelli's activities are still focused on the building of [[tire|tyre]]s and [[cable]]s (for [[energy]] and [[telecommunications]]). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to [[Goldman Sachs]], which changed the new group's name to ''Prysmian''. 
 
 In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli had the famous Milanese [[skyscraper]] built. It is in the same area as the first Pirelli factory in the 19th century. < ref > Skyscrapers, Antonino Terranova, White Star Publishers, 2003 ({{ISBN|8880952307}}) < /ref > 
 
 In 1974, Pirelli invented the ''wide radial tyre''. This was at the request from the [[Lancia]] rally racing team. They needed a tyre strong enough for their new Stratos. 
 
 Later, Porsche started using the same tyres with the Porsche 911 Turbo. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.enzociliberto.it/aisastoryauto/fascicoli/mono68/68mezzanotte.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-24 |archive-date=2008-02-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229032657/http://www.enzociliberto.it/aisastoryauto/fascicoli/mono68/68mezzanotte.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Today, the wide tyres are still the standard in sport  &  racing cars.

 To test the new F1 tyre, Pirelli signed [[Nick Heidfeld]]. A 2009 version of a [[Toyota Racing]] chassis is being used to test the tyres. The testing is taking place during the second half of the {{F1|2010}} season. < ref > {{cite web|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=Heidfeld released by Mercedes GP|publisher=Haymarket Publications|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/85989|date=2010-08-17|accessdate=2010-08-17}} < /ref >  In September 2010, Heidfeld was signed by [[Sauber]] to race the remainder of the season. Pirelli then hired former [[GP2]] and [[Renault F1]] driver [[Romain Grosjean]] to test for them.
