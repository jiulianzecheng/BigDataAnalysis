[[File:Spacetime curvature.png|thumbnail|300px|right|A [[curve]] in [[Space (physics)|space]] predicted by [[general relativity]]]]A '''graviton''' is a [[hypothetical]] [[particle]] that 'transfers' gravitation's force (particles like this are known as [[gauge bosons]]) from its [[field (field theory)|field]]. Gravitons have never been observed, directly or indirectly, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=535|title=What is a graviton?|last=Wei|first=Lisa|date=2003|work=Curious about Astronomy|accessdate=2009-11-01}} < /ref >  however, there have been several theories that use gravitons to explain certain phenomena. For example, a theory that describes [[black holes]] by combining [[quantum mechanics]] and [[gravity]], has been advanced by Georgi Dvali and Cesar Gomez, which suggests a black hole is  " an overpacked bucket of gravitons " . There are some theories that suggest that gravitons would make up a new group of particles,  " attraction particles " . CERN is currently using the Large Hadron Collider to try to find this particle. 
 The graviton applies a tiny force as it impacts the nuclei of atoms. 
 All atoms themselves have these graviton particles in orbit around them. If you gather a lot of atoms together the population of orbiting gravitons increases proportionately. As a result, a large asteroid for example will have more gravity than a small one. 
 Because the graviton is a particle that has [[force (physics)|force]] (gravity), it is classed as a [[gauge boson]]. Other gauge bosons include the [[photon]], the [[gluon]], and the [[W and Z bosons|W and Z particles]]. 
 
 If someone found one, it could lead to a theory which would join the four main physical forces: [[electromagnetism]], [[gravity]], [[strong force]] and [[weak force]].
