 '''eSTREAM''' is a project to identify  " new [[stream cipher]]s that might become suitable for widespread adoption " ,  organized by the [[European Union|EU]] [[ECRYPT]] network. It was set up because of the failure of all six stream ciphers submitted to the [[NESSIE]] project.  The call for primitives was first issued in November [[2004]]. The project was completed in April [[2008]]. The project was divided into separate phases and the project goal was to find [[algorithm]]s suitable for different kinds of application.
