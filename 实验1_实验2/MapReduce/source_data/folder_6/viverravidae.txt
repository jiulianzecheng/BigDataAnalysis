 The '''Viverravidae''' are an extinct  [[family (biology)|family]] of early mammalian [[carnivores]]. They are in the superfamily [[Miacoidea]], and lived from the early [[Palaeocene]] to the [[Eocene]]. They first appeared in the Paleocene of [[North America]] about 60 million years ago. 
 
 Viverravidae is a [[monophyletic]] family. In viverravids, the number of [[molar|molars]] is reduced to two and the [[skull]] is long.  
 
 They are probably not related to any living carnivorans. < ref > Wesley-Hunt G.D.  &  Flynn J.J. 2005.

''Journal of Systematic Paleontology'', '''3''': 1-28. < /ref >  The viverravids were previously thought to be the earliest carnivorans. A recent study of their skull [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] puts them outside the order [[Carnivora]]. < ref name=Polly > {{cite journal | author = Polly, David | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = Earliest known carnivoran auditory bulla and support for a recent origin of crown-clade carnivora (Eutheria, Mammalia) | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 49 | issue = 5 | pages = 1019–1027 | url = http://mypage.iu.edu/~pdpolly/Papers/Polly%20et%20al,%202006,%20Viverravus.pdf | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00586.x | s2cid = 27819519 | access-date = 2014-05-31 | archive-date = 2011-05-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524193602/http://mypage.iu.edu/~pdpolly/Papers/Polly%20et%20al,%202006,%20Viverravus.pdf | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
