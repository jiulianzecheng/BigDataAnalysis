 '''Tanganyika''' is the mainland part of [[Tanzania]]. From 9 December 1961 to 26 April 1964 it was an independent state. 
 
 It was an [[East Africa]]n territory lying between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the African Great Lakes: [[Lake Victoria]], [[Lake Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. < ref > ''Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia''. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}. Page 206 < /ref > 
 
 Once part of the larger colony of [[German East Africa]] ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Ostafrika}}), it comprised today's [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and [[Tanzania]], but not [[Zanzibar]]. < ref > Farwell, Byron. 1989. ''The Great War in Africa, 1914–1918''. New York: Norton. {{ISBN|0393305643}} < /ref > 
 
 After [[World War I]] the parts that are today's [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] became a [[League of Nations]] mandate governed by [[Belgium]]. The major part, however, came under [[British]] rule and was transferred to Britain under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. This was confirmed by a [[League of Nations]] Mandate in 1922, later becoming a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory. Britain changed the name to the ''Tanganyika Territory''. 
 
 On 9 December 1961 Tanganyika became independent as a [[Commonwealth Realm]], and on 9 December 1962 it became the '''Republic of Tanganyika''' within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In 1964, it joined with the islands of [[Zanzibar]] to form the '''United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar''', later in the year changed to the ''[[Tanzania|United Republic of Tanzania]]''. 
 
 Although Tanganyika still exists within Tanzania, the name is no longer used formally for the territory. It is, however, a convenient way to refer to the mainland, which is so different geographically and culturally from Zanzibar. The name ''Tanganyika'' is also used to refer to [[Lake Tanganyika]].
