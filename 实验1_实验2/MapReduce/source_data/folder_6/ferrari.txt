 Ferrari has a rich racing history and is a well known premium automobile brand. The fastest street Ferrari is the [[Ferrari F50|F50]] GT1, which can go over 370 kph (about 222 & nbsp;mph). 
 The most powerful Ferrari is the [[Ferrari FXX|FXX]], which has about 800 [[horsepower]]. The FXX is a lighter, improved version of the [[Ferrari F60 Enzo|F60 Enzo]]; it is Ferrari's most exclusive model. It is basically a race car that you can buy from Ferrari. The automobile is so extreme (completely flat tires, low ride height, and no roadcar safety features such as [[Airbag]]s) that it cannot be driven on roads legally. Ferrari will keep it for you at their Factory in Maranello in Italy. You can go to Italy and drive it on their private [[race track]], or have it transported to another race track around the world, the same as if you were driving for a racing team. Thirty have been built and all but two were sold to customers for $2,500,000 each. Ferrari gave one to seven-time [[Formula 1]] World Champion Michael Schumacher, who had driven for Ferrari for ten years when he retired in 2006, having brought Ferrari much success. Ferrari made his FXX different by painting it [[black]]. The other twenty-nine are either [[red]] or [[white]], with stripes painted in the other colour.
