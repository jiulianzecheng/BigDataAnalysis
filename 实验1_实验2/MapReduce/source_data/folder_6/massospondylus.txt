 '''''Massospondylus''''' was a [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Triassic]] to the [[Lower Jurassic]] periods. It was described by [[Richard Owen]] in 1854. It is one of the first dinosaurs to have been named. The remains were found in South Africa.  
 
 The dinosaur was bipedal. It was probably a plant eater (herbivore). < ref > Bonnan, Matthew F.  &  Phil Senter 2007.
