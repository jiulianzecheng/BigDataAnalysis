 '''Petra''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: البتراء, ''Al-Batrāʾ''; [[Ancient Greek]]: Πέτρα) is a historical and archaeological city in southern [[Jordan]].  
 
 It is in a [[basin (geology)|basin]] among the mountains that run from the [[Dead Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Aqaba]]. < ref > Glueck, Nelson 1959. Rivers in the desert: a history of the Negev. New York: Farrar, Straus  &  Cudahy/London: Weidenfeld  &  Nicolson < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 & nbsp;[[BC]]. It became the capital city of the [[Nabataean Kingdom]]. The Nabataeans were [[nomadic]] [[Arabs]] who used Petra because it was near the [[spice trade]] routes. < ref > {{cite book|last=Seeger|first=Josh|title=Retrieving the past: essays on archaeological research and methodology |year=1996 |publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1575060125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PWC98JLn7QC & pg=PA56 |author2=Gus W. van Beek|page=56}} < /ref > 
 
 The Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the [[Roman Empire]] in the first century BC. In 106 [[AD]]  they lost their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes developed. Also, an [[earthquake]] in 363 AD destroyed many structures.  
 
 The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Era]] led to the construction of several Christian churches, but the city continued to decline. By the early Islamic era only a handful of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/arts/art-review-rose-red-city-carved-from-the-rock.html|title=ART REVIEW; Rose-Red City Carved From the Rock|first=Grace|last=Glueck|date=17 October 2003|via=NYTimes.com}} < /ref > < ref > McKenzie, Judith (1990).
