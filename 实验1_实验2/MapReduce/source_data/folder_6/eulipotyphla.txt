 The term '''insectivorous''' (insect eating) can still be used to describe [[mode of life|lifestyle]]. It explains the food habits of this and some other groups of mammals, They are more closely related to [[Carnivora]] ([[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[bear]]s), [[Pholidota]] ([[pangolin]]s), [[Chiroptera]] ([[bat]]s), and [[Perissodactyla]] ([[equid]]s). As part of the superorder [[Laurasiatheria]]. 
 
 ==Lifestyles== 
 Although [[mole]]s and [[shrew]]s are not all strictly insectivorous, [[insect]]s and other small animal life make up the main food of most members of the group. Some kinds, the otter shrews of [[Africa]] and the [[star-nosed mole]] of [[North America]], for example, feed also upon [[fish]]. The Townsend mole of the Pacific Northwest often is a nuisance to bulb growers because of its fondness for the bulbs of many kinds of plants. 
 
 [[Mole]]s, as a group, are subterranean in habit. They spend most of their lives in the darkness of underground tunnels which they dig for themselves. The [[eyes]] of all moles are very small, in some species actually not opening to the outside, and of little value to them: [[vestigial organ]]s. On the other hand, their senses of [[touch]] and [[Olfaction|smell]] are highly developed.
