 The '''schists''' are a group of [[metamorphic rock]]s which have lamellar (plate-like) [[mineral]]s, such as [[mica]]s, [[chlorite (mineral)|chlorite]], [[talc]], [[hornblende]], [[graphite]], and others. [[Quartz]] often occurs in drawn-out grains so that a form called quartz schist is produced. By definition, schist contains more than 50% platy and elongated minerals, often finely interleaved with quartz and [[feldspar]]. Schist often contains [[garnet]]s. 
 
 The individual [[mineral]] grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen by the naked eye. Schist is characteristically ''foliated'', (~leaf-like) meaning the mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word ''schist'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σχίζειν schíxein'' meaning  " to split " . This refers to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie. 
 
 Most schists have been derived from [[clay]]s and [[mud]]s which have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of [[shale]]s, [[slate]]s and [[phyllite]]s as intermediate steps. Certain schists have been derived from fine-grained [[igneous rock]]s such as [[basalt]]s and [[tuff]]s. Most schists are mica schists, but [[graphite]] and chlorite schists are also common.  
 
 Schists are named after their mineral constituents, such as [[garnet]] schist, [[tourmaline]] schist, [[glaucophane]] schist, etc.  
 
 Schists are frequently used as [[dimension stone]]. Dimension stone is stone that has been selected and cut to specific shapes or sizes.
