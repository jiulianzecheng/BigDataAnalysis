 '''''Microvenator''''' (meaning  " small hunter " ) was a small, fast-moving, long-legged, meat-eating, bipedal [[dinosaur]] about 4 ft. (1.2 m) long, weighing perhaps 6.5-14 pounds (3-6.4 kg). This [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]-sized predator was an advanced [[theropod]] that lived during the early [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]], about 119 million to 113 million years ago, in what is now [[Montana]] ([[United States|USA]]).
