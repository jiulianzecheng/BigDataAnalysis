'''Powerlifting''' is a strength sport that consists of three main lifts: the [[squat]], the [[bench press]], and the [[deadlift]]. It is a competitive sport in which athletes attempt to lift the heaviest weights possible in each of these three lifts. Powerlifting is often confused with [[weightlifting]], another strength sport that involves the [[snatch]] and the [[clean and jerk]]. However, powerlifting focuses solely on the three lifts mentioned above.
