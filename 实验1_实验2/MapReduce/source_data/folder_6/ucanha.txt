'''Ucanha''' is a place in northern [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Mexico]], where scientists dig up [[Mayan]] [[archaeology|ruins]].  It used to be a town where Mayans lived.  People lived in Ucanha during the Late Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C. —  ca. A.D. 250).  It was about 2.2 square kilometers in size. There were about 400 households. It was connected  to a larger town, [[Uci]], by a wide stone causeway.  Uci is 13 km to the west of Ucanha. < ref > Hutson, Scott R., and Jacob A.

 A large brightly colored stucco mask was discovered in Ucanha in 2017. It is about two meters tall and was found in a building near the center of Ucanha.  Although masks like this one have been found in other Maya sites, this is the only one known for this part of Mexico. < ref > {{cite web|author1=Alejandra Alonso Olvera|title= Proyecto de Estudio y Conservación del Mascarón de Estuco de la Estructura 92 del Sitio Arqueológico Ucanha |url=https://conservacion.inah.gob.mx/index.php/portfolio-items/estudio-y-conservacion-del-mascaron-de-estuco-de-la-estructura-92-del-sitio-arqueologico-ucanha/}} < /ref > 
 The mask has been repaired so it looks the way it did when it was new.  The archaeologists buried the mask again to preserve it and  because the site is not legally protected. < ref > {{cite news|title=''Novedades Yucatán''|date= January 15, 2021|url= https://sipse.com/novedades-yucatan/noticias-noticias-de-hoy-yucatan-mascaron-maya-ucanha-cansahcab-motul-inah-mayas-cultura-arqueologia-389398.html}} < /ref >
