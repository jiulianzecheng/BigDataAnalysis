 '''Stromatolites'''  < ref > from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''strōma'', mattress, bed, stratum, and ''lithos'', rock < /ref >  are special [[Rock (geology)|rock]]-like structures. They usually form in shallow water. 
 
 They are formed by [[bacteria]] such as [[cyanobacteria]]. There may also be other types of bacteria and single-celled [[algae]]. 
 
 The [[mucus]] [[Secretion|secreted]] by the bacteria collects grains of [[sediment]], and they are stuck together with [[calcium carbonate]], also from the bacteria. This builds up into the structures seen in certain sea-shore bays. Cyanobacteria use water, [[carbon dioxide]], and sunlight to create their food, and expel [[oxygen]] as a by-product. 
 
 The real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest [[fossil]] evidence of [[life]] on Earth. The oldest known stromatolites have been dated between 3,710 million years and 3,695 million years old, and were discovered from an exposed outcrop of metacarbonate rocks in the Isua supracrustal belt (ISB) in Southwest [[Greenland]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Nutman|first1=Allen P.|last2=Bennett|first2=Vickie C.|last3=Friend|first3=Clark R.

 The ISB stromatolites predate by over 215 million years the previous evidence for oldest life remains: stromatolites in the 3,480 million year old Dresser Formation of the [[Pilbara]] [[craton]] in Western Australia. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1= Vankranedonk |first1=M|last2=Philippot|first2=P|last3=Lepot|first3=K|last4=Bodorkos|first4=S|last5=Pirajno|first5=F|title=Geological setting of Earth's oldest fossils in the ca. 3.5Ga Dresser Formation, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2008.07.003|journal=Precambrian Research|year=2008|volume=167|issue=1–2|pages=93–124|doi=10.1016/j.precamres.2008.07.003|bibcode=2008PreR..167...93V}} < /ref > 
 At one time, the oldest known stromatolites were dated to 3,450 million years ago, during the [[Archaean]] [[eon]]. < ref name= " Knoll " > Knoll, Andrew H. 2004. ''Life on a young planet: the first three billion years of evolution on Earth''. Princeton N.J. {{ISBN|0-691-12029-3}} < /ref > < ref > For a description of the method used to establish this date, see J. William Schopf 1999. ''Cradle of Life: the discovery of Earth's earliest fossils''. Princeton U. Press (pages 87-89 and figure 3.9). The remarkable precision was possible because the fossils were sandwiched between [[lava]] flows that could be precisely dated from embedded [[Zircon#Long lasting zircons|zircon]] [[crystal]]s. < /ref >  Recent discoveries of older stromatolites shows evidence in accord with genetic [[molecular clock]] studies. These have placed the [[origin of life]] in the [[Hadean|Hadean eon]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Hedges|first=S.

 The ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic [[photosynthesis]] is highly significant. Early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval Earth's [[atmosphere]] through their continuing [[photosynthesis]]. < ref name= " Knoll "  / >  They were the first known organisms to photosynthesize and produce free [[oxygen]]. After about a [[billion]] years, the effect of this photosynthesis began to make a huge change in the atmosphere. The process, called the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], actually took a long time. Eventually, it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen. It led to the kinds of environment we know today, where most organisms use and need oxygen. < ref > Frei R.
