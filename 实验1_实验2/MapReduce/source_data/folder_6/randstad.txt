The term Randstad was first used by [[Albert Plesman]], the founder of [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines|KLM]]. When he looked at it from the air, he saw that cities nearly form a circle. The Randstad covers about 20% of the area of the Netherlands. More than 40% of the population of the Netherlands live there. The cities in the Randstad are between {{convert|26|km}} (Den Haag - Rotterdam) and {{convert|77|km}} (Amsterdam - Rotterdam) apart. In the center is an area known as [[Groene Hart]]. Relatively few people live there.
