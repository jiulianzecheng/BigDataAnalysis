 A '''pulse''' (or '''heartbeat''') is a throbbing of [[blood vessel]]s as [[blood]] goes through them. You can feel someone's pulse in their [[wrist]], [[thumb]] or [[neck]], where vessels are closer to the [[skin]]. A normal pulse is below 100 beats per minute. Our pulse quickens when we exercise because the muscles being used need more oxygen. Unusually fast or slow or irregular pulse might mean sickness. 
 
 There are normally four heart sounds. Two of them, S1 and S2, can be heard with a [[stethoscope]]. Two other sounds, S3 and S4, can not be heard, but they can be seen using a machine called a [[phonocardiograph]].  
 
 [[Pulse (legume)|Pulses]] is a term for [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s and [[lentil]]s.
