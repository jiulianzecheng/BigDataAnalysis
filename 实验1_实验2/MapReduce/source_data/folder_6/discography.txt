'''Discography''' is the study and listing of [[sound recording]]s. The word comes from the word  " disc " , which is the most commonly used term for describing the format used most for sound recordings in the [[20th century]], and the ''-graph'' [[suffix]] meaning something written. < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discography discography].

 A listing of all recordings of a [[musician]] or [[singer]] is usually called their  " discography " . Discographies may also be created based on a particular [[musical genre]] or [[record label]], for example, so that all artists in a genre, or that have contracts with a certain label, are listed together. 
 
 The term  " discography "  became popular in the 1930s by collectors of [[jazz]] records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on/with the records at that time.
