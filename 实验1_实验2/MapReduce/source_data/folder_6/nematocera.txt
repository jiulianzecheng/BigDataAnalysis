 The '''Nematocera''' are a large [[suborder]] of [[flies]] which include the [[mosquito]]es and [[midges]]. They usually have long thin bodies, with segmented [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Usually their [[larva]]e are aquatic, but there are many exceptions to this. 
 
 Examples of the Nematocera include the [[mosquito]]es ([[Culicidae]]), [[crane fly|crane flies]] ([[Tipulidae]]) and [[black fly|black flies]] ([[Simuliidae]]). Many of the other families are called [[gnat]]s, and others are called [[midges]]. 
 
 Many species form mating swarms of males, and in some of these, competition for females is extreme. Although many species (as larvae) have a strong association with water, even within a single family there may be a trend toward semiaquatic and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitats]].
