 '''Zinc''', sometimes called '''spelter''', < ref > {{Citation|url=http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/spelter|title=Spelter|year=1916|publisher=Encyclo|accessdate=2009-08-01|isbn=0665822448}} < /ref >  is a [[chemical element]]. It is in the group of [[metal]]s called the [[transition metal]]s. It is sometimes considered a [[post-transition metal]]. Its symbol on the [[periodic table]] is  " '''Zn''' " . Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an [[atomic number]] of 30. Zinc has a [[mass number]] of 65.38. It contains 30 [[proton]]s and 30 [[electron]]s. In total, 29 [[isotope]]s of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. Their [[half-life (element)|half-lives]] are between 40 [[millisecond]]s for  < sup > 57 < /sup > Zn and 5x10 < sup > 18 < /sup >  years for  < sup > 70 < /sup > Zn. 
 
 Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for [[galvanizing]] and [[battery|batteries]]. It is the fourth most common metal used by people. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal. When it has just been cut, zinc has a whitish-grey color. If it is exposed to [[air]], it will not stay shiny for long. Its melting point is ({{convert|419.58|C|F}}), and its boiling point is ({{convert|907.0|C|F}}). This temperature is lower than most [[transition metal]]s but higher than [[tin]] or [[lead]]. It can be melted on a cooking stove. It boils at a low temperature for a metal. < ref name=ZincMetalProps > {{Citation|url=http://www.galvanizeit.org/aga/designing-fabricating/design-considerations/zinc-metal-properties|title=Zinc Metal Properties|publisher=American Galvanizers Association|year=2008|accessdate=2009-02-15|archive-date=2009-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221111748/http://galvanizeit.org/aga/designing-fabricating/design-considerations/zinc-metal-properties|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It is not magnetic.

If it is heated more, it becomes very [[wikt:brittle|brittle]]. < ref > {{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSkKAAAAIAAJ|title=The Useful Metals and Their Alloys|first=John|last=Scoffern|publisher=Houlston and Wright|year=1861|pages=591–603|accessdate=2009-04-06}} < /ref >  It forms [[alloy]]s easily with other metals. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 Zinc is a [[reactive]] metal. It is about as reactive as [[aluminium]] and more reactive than most of the more common metals, such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], and [[chromium]]. It is less reactive than [[magnesium]]. Zinc can react with [[acid]]s, [[base (chemistry)|bases]], and [[nonmetal]]s. < ref > {{Citation|last=Hinds|first=John Iredelle Dillard|title=Inorganic Chemistry: With the Elements of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons|location=New York|year=1908|edition=2nd|pages=506–508|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xMUMAAAAYAAJ}} < /ref >  It does not [[rust]] in air, though. A coating of [[zinc oxide]] and [[zinc carbonate]] forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air. < ref > {{Citation|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|page=121|isbn=0824792130|title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys| first=Frank C.|last=Porter}} < /ref >  This coating stops corrosion.

 [[File:Zinc burning.JPG|thumb|Zinc burning]] 
 Zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide, a white powder. The flame is bright blue-green. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.scorecard.org/chemical-profiles/html/zinc.html |title=Zinc--overview |author= |publisher=chemistryexplained.com |accessdate=2010-11-07 |archive-date=2010-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112092006/http://www.scorecard.org/chemical-profiles/html/zinc.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 Zinc oxide can [[Solvation|dissolve]] in strong bases. This reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them. 
 
 : ZnO + H < sub > 2 < /sub > O + 2 OH < sup > - < /sup >  → Zn(OH) < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > . 
 
 Zinc is a [[chalcophile]]. This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen. That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc [[ore]], not zinc oxide. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 {{See also|:Category:Zinc compounds}} 
 Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements. These chemical compounds are only in one [[oxidation state]]: +2. A +1 compound has been found but it is hard to make. There are no other oxidation states other than +1 or +2. < ref > {{Citation|last1=Brady|first1=James E.|title=General Chemistry: Principles and Structure|year=1983|last2=Humiston|last3=Heikkinen|first2=Gerard E.|first3=Henry|page=671|edition=3rd|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons|isbn=047186739X}} < /ref >  Most of these compounds have no color. If they have a color, it is not the zinc that is making the color. 
 
 [[Zinc chloride]] is one of the most common zinc compounds. They are quite unreactive. They are a little acidic when dissolved in water. They make a green flame when heated in a fire.{{cn}} 
 
 Other zinc compounds are:

 [[File:Sphalerite.jpg|thumb|Sphalerite, a common zinc ore]] 
 Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. [[Sphalerite]], a [[mineral]] that is made of [[zinc sulfide]], is a main [[ore]] of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores. 
 
 There are some other zinc ores, such as [[smithsonite]] (zinc carbonate) and a zinc [[silicate]] mineral. They are less common. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 The zinc sulfide is concentrated by [[flotation]]. There is a [[detergent]] that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and [[sulfur dioxide]]. < ref name= " Zinchand " > {{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laACw9i0D_wC|title=Zinc Handbook|first=Frank C.|last=Porter|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=9780824783402}} < /ref > 
 
 :2 ZnS + 3 O < sub > 2 < /sub >  → 2 ZnO + 2 SO < sub > 2 < /sub > 
 
 The sulfur dioxide is [[oxidation|oxidized]] to [[sulfur trioxide]]. 
 
 :2 SO < sub > 2 < /sub >  + O < sub > 2 < /sub >  → 2 SO < sub > 3 < /sub > 
 
 The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate. < ref > {{Citation|last1=Gupta|first1=C. K.|title=Hydrometallurgy in Extraction Processes|year=1990|last2=Mukherjee|first2=T. K.|page=62|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849368049}} < /ref >  This makes a [[Solubility|soluble]] form of zinc which can be processed more. 
 :SO < sub > 3 < /sub >  + ZnO → ZnSO < sub > 4 < /sub > 
 
 The zinc sulfate is purified and [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]]. < ref name= " Zinchand " / >  This electrolysis makes [[oxygen]], zinc, and [[sulfuric acid]]. This makes a pure zinc that is known as  " SHG "  or special high grade. < ref > {{Citation|title=Special High Grade Zinc (SHG) 99.995%|url=http://nyrstar.com/nyrstar/en/products/zinccongalvanising/techdownloads/shg_budel.pdf| accessdate=2008-12-01|year=2008|publisher=Nyrstar}} < /ref >

 The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide. 
 
 Zinc oxide can also be [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] by [[carbon]] to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. < ref > {{Citation|last=Bodsworth|first=Colin|title=The Extraction and Refining of Metals|page=148|year=1994|isbn=0849344336|publisher=CRC Press}} < /ref >  This is a [[blast furnace]] process similar to how [[iron]] is made.

It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow [[rust]]ing. < ref > {{Citation|title=A comparative study of the electrochemical behaviour of Algerian zinc and a zinc from a commercial sacrificial anode|first=M. |others= Salhi, E.; Benzine, K.; Ghali E.; Dalard F.|last=Bounoughaz|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume =38|page=1139|doi=10.1023/A:1022824813564|year=2003|issue=6 |s2cid=135744939 }} < /ref >  The motor of a motorboat often has a  " bullet "  of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free. 
 
 Zinc is used in alloys. [[Brass]] is an alloy of [[copper]] and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. [[Zinc aluminium]] is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good [[bearing]]s. [[wikt:commercial|Commercial]] [[bronze]] has zinc in it. Sometimes [[cadmium telluride]] is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a [[semiconductor]]. [[Nickel silver]] is another zinc alloy.
