 An '''observatory''' is a place for making [[observation]]s. The term is most used for [[Astronomy|astronomical]] observatories, which are places for looking at the [[sky]]. A modern astronomical observatory has a large [[telescope]], or several. It is usually high up on [[mountain]]s or [[hill]]s, because higher places have cleaner, clearer, dryer air. Observatories also have to be away from places that have lots of [[light pollution]], like cities. Too much light can make it so that the [[astronomer]] < nowiki/ > s cannot see out of the telescope very well.
