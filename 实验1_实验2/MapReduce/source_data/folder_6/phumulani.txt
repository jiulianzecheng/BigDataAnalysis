 Phumulani is a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to preventing [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual abuse]] in communities of color throughout [[Minnesota]] and globally. 
 
 == History == 
 Phumulani was founded by Comfort Dondo, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence.{{fact|date=January 2021}} Born and raised in [[Zimbabwe]] and now residing in Minnesota, Comfort’s struggle with domestic violence was compounded by the inability of women’s shelters in America to provide the language, cultural and societal resources she and her children needed to feel safe and supported.{{fact|date=January 2021}} Often, she found herself back in her abuser’s home with no alternative. {{fact|date=January 2021}} 
 
 Now free from the dangerous situation, Comfort wants to make sure women and children of African descent have the cultural resources they need to feel comfortable in sharing their stories and recovering from their experiences. She understands firsthand that individuals who have fled African countries to save their lives often have lasting trauma that needs to be acknowledged and treated holistically to ensure long-term progress.  < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-04-30|title=Zimbabweans stranded in Cape receive food donations|url=https://www.cajnews.co.zw/zimbabweans-stranded-in-cape-receive-food-donations/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=CajNews Zimbabwe|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121215244/https://www.cajnews.co.zw/zimbabweans-stranded-in-cape-receive-food-donations/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
