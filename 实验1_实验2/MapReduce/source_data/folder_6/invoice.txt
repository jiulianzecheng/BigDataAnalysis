 An '''invoice''' is a [[document]] used in [[commerce]], particularly in [[retail]]. It is made by a person or company who is [[Sales|selling]] something to a [[wikt:customer|customer]] (or  " [[buy]]er " ). The invoice is given to the customer as a request for [[payment]]. It lists the [[goods]] or [[service]] provided to the customer, along with the [[price]] being charged for each of them. 
 
 Once the customer has paid for the goods or services, they may be given a [[receipt]]. The receipt is the customer's proof that they have paid for the products. A receipt is not the same thing as an invoice. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-invoice-receipt-21275.html |title=The Difference Between an Invoice and a Receipt |author=Heidi Cardenas |author2= Demand Media |work= Houston Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Newspapers, LLC|accessdate=20 February 2014}} < /ref >
