 '''Hernán Enrique Jiménez Pino''' (born May 7, 1983 < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.musica.com/letras.asp?biografia=24233 |title=Musica.com |author= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 September 2012}} < /ref > ) is a [[Panama]]nian singer. He is better known by his stage name '''Makano'''. Makano in Panama means  " strong like a tree " . At the age of 12, Jiménez was part of a [[reggaeton]] group called  " Los Makanos " . The members of the group made a promise that the first of them to record a full disc would carry on the group's name. 
 
 When he was 16, Jiménez was writing quality music. His father discouraged him from music, saying he needed to get a real job. After several years of trying, Jimenez appeared on the CD ''La Alianza'' in 2004. Afterward, he was given the chance to record several songs which later became number one hits in Panama. In 2007, Jimenez signed with Panama Music. He recorded his first album as a solo singer, ''Te Amo'', which features the songs  " Yo Quisiera Vivir " ,  " Te Va a Doler " ,  " Te Amo "  and  " Déjame Entrar " .
