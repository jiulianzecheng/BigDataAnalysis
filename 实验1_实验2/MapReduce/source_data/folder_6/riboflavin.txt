'''Riboflavin''' is one of the B vitamins ('''vitamin B < sub > 2 < /sub > ''').  The B and C vitamins are the [[vitamin]]s that [[solution|dissolve]] in water.  A healthy person's [[gut]] can easily take riboflavin from food and pass it on to the blood for the body to use. The body needs the B vitamins to get [[energy]] from food. Without riboflavin and the other B vitamins people's bodies cannot use [[fats]], [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[proteins]]. [[Light]] can break down riboflavin [[molecule]]s into other molecules that the body cannot use.

If there is much riboflavin in the urine, the urine becomes bright,  yellow. Vitamin pills, or a meal with a lot of liver or egg white turns the urine yellow because these foods put so much riboflavin into the blood. 
 
 People may get very sick when their food does not have enough riboflavin. Adding extra riboflavin help. [[Baby food]]s, [[breakfast]] [[cereal]]s, [[pasta]], [[sauce]]s, fruit drinks, and foods such as cheese that are made from milk may have extra riboflavin added.  This is called fortification. To make Vitamin B2 for vitamin pills or to add to foods, industrial companies grow special [[yeast]]s, other [[fungus|fungi]], or [[bacteria]] that make a lot of riboflavin. < ref name= " Stahmann " > {{cite journal|author=Stahmann KP, Revuelta JL and Seulberger H.|date=2000|title=Three biotechnical processes using ''Ashbya gossypii'', ''Candida famata'', or ''Bacillus subtilis'' compete with chemical riboflavin production|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_applied-microbiology-and-biotechnology_2000-05_53_5/page/509|journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol|volume=53|issue=5|pages=509–516|doi=10.1007/s002530051649|pmid=10855708|s2cid=2471994}} < /ref >
