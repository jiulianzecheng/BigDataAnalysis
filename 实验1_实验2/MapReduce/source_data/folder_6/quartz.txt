 '''Quartz''' is a [[silicate mineral|tectosilicate mineral]] that is the second most common [[mineral]] in [[Earth]]'s [[continental crust]]. < ref > The most common mineral is [[feldspar]]. < /ref >  Its [[crystal structure]] is a framework of SiO < sub > 4 < /sub >  [[silicon]]–[[oxygen]] [[tetrahedra]]. Each shares an oxygen atom with another [[tetrahedron]], so the overall [[chemical formula]] is [[Silicon dioxide|SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ]] or [[silica]]. 
 
 Its name is derived from the German ''quarz,'' which sounds the same but is spelled without a t. 
 
 There are many different varieties of quartz, some of which are semi-precious [[gemstone]]s.  They have been used for a long time to make [[Jewellery|jewelry]] and hardstone carvings.  [[Agate]], [[amethyst]], [[rose quartz]] are all forms of quartz. 
 
 Quartz crystals are used in [[oscillator]]s, for example in [[quartz clock]]s. People also extract the [[silicon]] to make [[semiconductor]]s. 
 The majority of [[sand]] is small quartz bits. Quartz has a mineral hardness of 7. ([[mohs scale]]). 
 
 The word  " quartz "  comes from the [[German language|German]] word  " quarz " . < ref > http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=quartz etymonline.com < /ref > 
 
 'Fused quartz' is [[glass]] made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] in non-[[crystal]]line form. It does not contain other ingredients that are added to other glass to lower the [[melting point]]. Fused silica has high working and melting temperatures. For some purposes, fused quartz is better than other types of glass due to its purity. The glass is used in a number of high-tech products. < ref > {{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a12_365 |chapter=Glass |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry  |last1=De Jong, Bernard; Beerkens, Ruud  &  Van Nijnatten, Peter 2000. |year=2000 |isbn=3-527-30673-0}} < /ref > 
 
 Quartz comes in many different types such as clear quartz, smoky quartz, tiger's eye, lemon quartz and many more. There are many microcrystalline types of quartz, like Jasper, [[Onyx]], [[Agate]] and [[Carnelian]].

 '''Shocked quartz''' is a form of quartz that has a microscopic structure different from normal quartz. Under intense pressure (but limited temperature), the crystalline structure of quartz is deformed along planes inside the crystal. These planes show up as lines under a microscope. 
 
 Shocked quartz is found worldwide, especially in [[impact crater]] < nowiki/ > s and in the thin [[Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene]] boundary layer. This is at the contact between [[Cretaceous]] and [[Paleogene]] rocks. It is further evidence (in addition to [[iridium]] enrichment) that the transition between the two geologic periods was caused by a large impact. [[Eugene Shoemaker]] discovered it in building stones in the [[Bavaria]]n town of [[Nördlingen]]. The stones were from shocked [[metamorphic]] rocks, such as [[breccia]], of a meteor crater. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sortingoutscience.net/2008/02/05/the-scientific-tourist-6-nothing-but-rim/|title=The scientific tourist #6 — nothing but rim!|author=Sam Wise|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2017-10-19|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112014704/http://sortingoutscience.net/2008/02/05/the-scientific-tourist-6-nothing-but-rim/|archivedate=2017-01-12}} < /ref >
