'''Selenide''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is Se < sup > 2â€“ < /sup > . Selenides are similar to [[sulfide]]s. Selenides are [[reducing agent]]s when pure. They are stronger reducing agents than sulfides. Selenide ores are the source of selenium. Selenides are normally mixed with sulfides. The selenide ion is unstable except in very [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions. Normally [[hydroselenide]] is made, which is HSe < sup > - < /sup > . In [[acid]]ic conditions, [[hydrogen selenide]] gas is made.
