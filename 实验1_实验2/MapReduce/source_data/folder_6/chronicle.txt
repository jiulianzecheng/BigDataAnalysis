 A '''chronicle''' ({{lang-la|chronica}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χρονικά}}, from {{lang|grc|χρόνος}}, ''chronos'',  " time " ) is an account of historical events, arranged in order from earliest to latest. A chronicle is different from a [[narrative]] or history, as events which are not believed to be important may be excluded from the latter; a chronicler is more concerned with documenting events in [[sequential]] order. 
 
 The [[Nuremberg Chronicle]], [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]],'' are the most famous chronicles.
