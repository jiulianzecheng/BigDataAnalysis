 A '''''hachimaki''''' (鉢巻,  " helmet scarf " ) is a [[headband]] with styles that came from [[Japan]]. They are usually made from red and white [[cloth]]. People wear them to show hard work, or to keep [[sweat]] from the eyes. 
 
 == History == 
 Nobody is sure how hachimaki started. Most people say that [[Samurai]] wore them under their [[helmet]]s for comfort. 
 
 [[Kamikaze]] pilots wore them before flying to their deaths. 
 
 == Styles == 
 Hachimaki are normally decorated with words, such as  " ''Nippon Ichi'' "  (日本一,  " the best of Japan " ), and with the rising sun between the [[kanji]] characters.
