 Cyberattacks can be part of [[cyberwarfare]] or [[cyberterrorism]]. A cyberattack can be done by [[sovereign state]]s, individuals, groups, society, or organizations. It may start from an anonymous source. A product that helps a cyberattack is sometimes called a [[cyberweapon]]. 
 
 A cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by [[hacking]] into a susceptible system. Cyberattacks can range from installing [[spyware]] on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations.
