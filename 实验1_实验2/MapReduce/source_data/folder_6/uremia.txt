'''Uremia''' is a [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word used in English to describe the condition of a person's [[blood]]. Uremia is caused by [[urine]] products building up in the blood. If those come over the normal filtration system of the [[kidney]]s then the condition is called uremia. People with [[chronic renal disease]] or [[acute renal failure]] are usually affected by uremia.
