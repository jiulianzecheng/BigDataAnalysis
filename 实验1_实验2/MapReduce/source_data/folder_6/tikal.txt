 '''Tikal''' (or '''Tik’al''', according to modern [[orthography]]) is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the [[Maya civilization]]. It is in modern day [[Guatemala]] at {{coor at dms |17|13|19|N|89|37|22|W|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}. Now it is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], < ref > {{Cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/64 | title = Tikal National Park| accessdate=2009-09-05| publisher = UNESCO}} < /ref >  and a popular tourist spot.   
   
 Tikal was one of the major cultural and population centers of the Maya civilization. The oldest [[monument]]al [[architecture]] at the site dates to the 4th century BC.  The best time of Tikal was during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]], from 200 AD to [[900]] AD. In this period, Tikal was in charge of the Maya region [[politics|politically]], [[economy|economically]], and [[military|militarily]].  This is because it was linked with areas throughout [[Mesoamerica]], such as central [[Mexico|Mexican]], the center of [[Teotihuacan]].  After the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built.  Some [[palace]]s were burned and the population [[:wikt:decline|declined]]. The site was [[wikt:abandon|abandon]]ed by the end of the [[10th century]]. 
 
 == Site characteristics == 
 
 The ruins are on lowland [[rainforest]], but Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored underground.  [[Archaeologist]]s working in Tikal during the last century used the underground [[wikt:facility|facilities]] to store water for their own use.  The [[wikt:absent|absence]] of springs, rivers, and lakes nearby is unusual for a major city.  However, Tikal did well with [[wikt:intense|intensive]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[wikt:technique|techniques]].  These were more advanced than the [[slash  &  burn]] methods originally [[wikt:theory|theorized]] by archeologists.  The [[wikt:reliance|reliance]] on [[season]]al [[rainfall]] made Tikal open to [[drought]].  This is now thought to play a major part in the ''Classic Maya Collapse''. 
 
 === Rulers === 
 
 The known [[ruler]]s of Tikal, with general or specific dates attributed to them, include the following: 
 
 [[File:TempleIIILintelMaudslay.jpg|thumb|right|King of Tikal from wooden lintel in Temple III. Depicting either  " Yax Nuun Ayin II "  or  " Dark Sun " ]] 
 
 ==== Late Preclassic ==== 
 * Yax Ehb' Xook – ca. A.D. 60, dynastic founder 
 * Siyaj Chan K'awil Chak Ich'aak ( " Stormy Sky I " ) – ca. [[2nd century]] 
 * Yax Ch’aktel Xok – ca. 200 
 
 ==== Early Classic ==== 
 * Balam Ajaw ( " Decorated Jaguar " ) – A.D. 292 
 * K'inich Ehb' – ca. A.D. 300 
 * Ix Une' B'alam ( " Queen Jaguar " ) – A.D. 317

 * K'inich Muwaan Jol – died A.D. 359 
 * Chak Tok Ich'aak I ( " Jaguar Paw I " ) – c.a. 360-378.  His palace, unusually, was never built over by later rulers, and was kept in repair for centuries as an apparent revered monument. He died on the same day that Siyah K'ak' arrived in Tikal, probably executed by the Teotihuacano conquerors.  
 * Nun Yax Ayin – A.D. 370-411.  Nun Yax Ayin was a noble from [[Teotihuacan]] who was installed on Tikal's [[throne]] in [[379]] by Siyaj K'ak'.   
 * Siyaj Chan K'awiil II ( " Stormy Sky II " ) – A.D. 411-456. 
 * K'an-Ak ( " Kan Boar " ) – A.D. 458-486. 
 * Ma'Kin-na Chan – ca. late [[5th century]]. 
 * Chak Tok Ich'aak (Bahlum Paw Skull) – A.D. 486-508.  Married to  " Lady Hand " 
 * Ix Kalo'mte' Ix Yo K'in ( " Lady of Tikal " ) – A.D. 511-527.  Co-ruled with Kaloomte' B'alam, possibly as consort. 
 * Kaloomte' B'alam ( " Curl-Head "  and  " 19th Lord " ) – A.D. 511-527.  Co-ruled with Ix Kalo'mte' Ix Yo K'in ( " Lady of Tikal " ), as [[regent]]. 
 *  " Bird Claw "  ( " Animal Skull I " ,  " Ete I " ) – ca. A.D. 527–537. 
 * Wak Chan K'awiil ( " Double-Bird " ) – A.D. 537-562.  Capture and possible sacrifice by Caracol. 
 *  " Lizard Head II "  – Unknown, lost a battle with Caracol in A.D. 562.

 [[File:Tikal map vector.svg|thumb|right|Map of the centre of Tikal]] 
 * K'inich Waaw – A.D. 593-628.  
 * K'inich Wayaan – ca. early/mid [[7th century]]. 
 * K'inich Muwaan Jol II – ca. early/mid [[7th century]]. 
 
 ==== Late Classic ==== 
 * Jasaw Chan K'awiil I (a.k.a. Ruler A or Ah Cacao) – A.D. 682-734.  Entombed in Temple I.  His queen Lady Twelve Macaw (died A.D. 704) is entombed in Temple II. Triumphed in war with Calakmul in A.D. 711. 
 * Yik'in Chan K'awiil (a.k.a. Ruler B) – A.D. 734-766.  His wife was Shana'Kin Yaxchel Pacal  " Green Jay on the Wall "  of Lakamha.  It is unknown exactly where is [[tomb]] lies, but strong archaeological parallels between Burial 116 (the resting place of his father) and Burial 196, located in the diminutive pyramid immediately south of Temple II and referred to as Str. 5D-73, suggest the latter may be the tomb of Yik’in Chan Kawil (Sharer 1994:169).  Other possible locations, and likely candidates as mortuary shrines, include Temples IV and VI.   
 *  " Temple VI Ruler "  – A.D. 766-768 
 * Yax Nuun Ayiin II ( " Chitam " ) – A.D. 768-790 
 * Chitam II ( " Dark Sun " ) – Buried ca. A.D. 810 Buried in Temple III 
 *  " Jewel K'awil "  – A.D. 849  
 * Jasaw Chan K'awiil II – A.D. 869-889
