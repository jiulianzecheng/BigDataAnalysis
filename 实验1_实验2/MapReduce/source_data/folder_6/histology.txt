 '''Histology''' is the study of the microscopic [[anatomy]] of [[cells]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, particularly the tissues. It is a part of [[cytology]], and an essential tool of [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. 
 
 Histology is usually done by looking at cells and tissues under a [[light microscope]] or [[electron microscope]]. The tissue has to be specially prepared beforehand. 
 
 == The process == 
 The stages below are only described in outline. Laboratories which do histology work from schedules which are much more detailed. 
 
 === Fixing === 
 Chemical fixatives are used to preserve tissue from [[decay]]. This preserves the structure of the cell and of sub-cellular components such as [[cell organelles]] (e.g., nucleus, [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[mitochondria]]). The most common fixative for light microscopy is [[formalin]] (4% [[formaldehyde]] in [[saline]]). 
 
 === Embedding === 
 After fixing, the block of tissue is embedded in [[paraffin wax]]. This holds and preserves the tissue as a block. 
 
 === Sectioning === 
 The section is cut into a series of wafer-thin slices, each of which is put on a glass [[microscope slide]]. The machine which cuts the block is a mechanical guillotine which can be set to cut at a suitable depth for the tissue in question. 
 
 === Staining === 
 [[Staining|Stains]] are [[dyes]], chemicals used to make cells and tissues easy to see under a microscope. There are many tissue stains, and each of them has advantages and disadvantages. 
 
 ==== Haematoxylin and eosin  (H & E) ==== 
 This is the most widely used stain in biology and medicine. [[Haematoxylin]] colours [[cell nuclei]] and [[eosin]] colours cell [[cytoplasm]]. 
 
 ==== Silver nitrate ==== 
 [[Camillo Golgi]] developed a [[silver nitrate]] stain for [[nerve cells]]. His idea was used by [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] in his famous work on the structure of brain tissue. 
 
 == Modern techniques == 
 [[Electron microscopy]] is used often as well as light microscopy. This has its own procedures. Its advantage is that it resolves things which light cannot resolve. For example, [[viruses]] were first seen by electron microscopy.. 
 
 Specialised selective stains using [[immunology]] or [[radioactive]] labelling are now routine. The advantage of using antibodies or radioactive labels is that they stick to ''specific kinds of molecules''.  
 Increasingly popular is tagging with a [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] stain, which shows up even if a tiny part of a cell is stained. Immunoinfluorescence is the name of this particular technique.
