'''Synecdoche'''  is a [[figure of speech]]. < ref > [http://rhetoric.byu.edu  " Synecdoche "  at Rhetoric.byu.edu]; retrieved 2012-1-14. < /ref > < ref > Welsh, Alfred Hux and James Mickleborough Greenwood. (1893). [https://books.google.com/books?id=-1YXAAAAIAAJ & dq=metonymy+lessons+in+English+grammar & pg=PA220   " Metonymy, " ] ''Studies in English Grammar: A Comprehensive Course for Grammar Schools, High Schools, and Academies,'' pp. 222-223. < /ref >   It uses a part for the whole thing, or the whole for one of its parts. Examples: 
 * " Boots "  meaning [[soldiers]] 
 * " America "  for the [[United States]] 
 * " Number 10 "  for the Office of the [[Prime Minister]] 
 These three examples, and most other cases, use the part for the whole. But an expression like  " The West "  might just mean the U.S.A. It depends on context. 
 * " The Government made a statement on the issue yesterday " . 
 The Government did not actually make the statement: a spokesperson did. 
 
 Synecdoche is a type of [[metonymy]], because it refers to its target by using a related term. It is similar to [[metaphor]] in its use in prose.
