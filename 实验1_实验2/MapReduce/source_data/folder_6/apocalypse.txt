 An '''apocalypse'''  is a [[revelation]]: seeing something which has been hidden. It comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word, ''Apokálypsis'', which means  " lifting of the veil " , or finding out something secret. Often this secret is discovered in a dream or a vision. 
 
 In religion, the word describes [[Armageddon]] or the end of the world. This might have come from the words, ''apokalupsis eschaton'', meaning all the secrets will be discovered  " at the end of the æon, or age " . In [[Christianity]] ''The Apocalypse of John'' is the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book of the [[Bible]]. It describes the end of the world, and the [[second coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]].
