 '''Crimea''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Крым, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian:]] Крим) is a [[peninsula]] in the [[Black Sea]] that separates it from the [[Sea of Azov]]. Crimea has a surface of {{convert|26081|km2}}. It is about {{Convert|200|km||abbr=}} by {{Convert|320|km||abbr=}}. About 2.4 million people live there. On the Crimean peninsula live [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Crimean Tatars]], Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks and [[Xoraxane Roma]]. 
 
 In 2014 Russia took control of the peninsula and annexed it. Most countries still say it is part of Ukraine. In 2018 Russia built the Kerch Bridge to connect it to Russia. 
 
 In 2022, the government of Ukraine recognized the [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] indigenous people of Ukraine on the territory of the Crimean peninsula. 
 
 ==History== 
 The Crimean Khanate ruled Crimea from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Late in the 18th century, the [[Russian Empire]] won a war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and took control. The [[Crimean War]] was fought here in the 19th century.  
 
 Crimea was part of Russia until the [[Soviet Union]] gave it to [[Ukraine]] in 1954. Ukraine gave it a limited self-rule as an ''[[autonomous republic|autonomous —]]'' [[:en:Autonomous_Republic_of_Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]]. The seat of the government is [[Simferopol]], which is also the biggest city. Other major cities are [[Sevastopol]] and [[Kerch]]. 
 
 In March 2014, after [[Euromaidan|a series of protests]] in Ukraine the month before, Russian troops took control of Crimea. A [[referendum]] in Crimea by Russia was held in which over 95% of voters voted to join the [[Russian Federation]]. The Crimean Parliament quickly proclaimed independence from Ukraine as a result. The area became the [[Republic of Crimea]], a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of Russia.    
 
 The referendum is not recognized by Ukraine or the international community. They still consider Crimea [[de jure]] Ukrainian territory. On March 24, Russia was expelled from the [[G8]] (which became the G7), and on March 27, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]], which states that the referendum was invalid and Crimea still belongs to Ukraine. In later months, the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], and other places started economic sanctions to prevent Russian people and goods from entering those countries.
