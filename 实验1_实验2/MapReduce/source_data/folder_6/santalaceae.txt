 '''Santalaceae''' is a family of [[flowering plant]]s in the order [[Santalales]], put in the [[Eudicots]].  
 
 Modern treatments of the Santalaceae include the family Viscaceae (mistletoes), previously considered distinct.  
 You can see that the example shows a dark fruit, while the term 'mistletoe' usually means the fruit is white. 
 
 There are many species which grow on standing trees. See [[Liana|lianas]] on another page.
