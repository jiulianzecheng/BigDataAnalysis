[[File:Photosynthesis en.svg|thumb| Energy from sunlight, water absorbed by roots, [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere. These make [[glucose]] and [[oxygen]] by [[photosynthesis]]]] 
 
 '''Photosynthesis''' is how [[plant]]s and some [[microorganisms]] make  [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]. It is an [[Endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (takes in heat) [[chemical]] process which uses sunlight to turn [[carbon dioxide]] into sugars. The sugars are used by the cell as energy, and to build other kinds of molecules. Fundamentally, photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy. < ref > Schopf J. William 1999. ''Cradle of life: the discovery of Earth's earliest fossils''. p148 et seq. < /ref >   
 
 Photosynthesis is vital for life on [[Earth]]. Before photosynthesis, Earth had no free oxygen in its atmosphere. < ref > Zahnle K.; Schaefer L.  &  Fegley B. 2010. Earth's earliest atmospheres. ''Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology''. '''2''' (10): a004895. doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a004895. PMC 2944365. PMID 20573713 < /ref >    
 
 Green plants build themselves using photosynthesis. [[Algae]], [[protist]]s and some [[bacteria]] also use it. Some exceptions are organisms that directly get their energy from chemical reactions; these organisms are called [[chemoautotroph]]s. 
 
 == Origin of photosynthesis == 
 [[Photosynthesis]] is not an accident. It happens because its building blocks occur naturally in space, and get included when planets form. We have no idea as to how common or rare this process is. We do know that higher elements are formed in [[Supernova|supernovae]], and that is the origin of all elements higher than [[helium]]. < ref name= " bryantfrigaard " > Bryant D.A.  &  Frigaard N.U. 2006.

 Before photosynthesis, the [[Earth's atmosphere]] had almost no oxygen. Even without oxygen, some simple life-forms could have existed. But the key event for life as we know it was the [[Great Oxygenation Event]]. < ref > Cloud, Preston E. 1968. Atmospheric and hydrospheric evolution on the primitive Earth.

 === Ways it is done === 
 Photosynthesis can happen in different ways, but there are some parts that are common. < ref > {{cite book| last=Walker |first=J.C.G. |date=1980|title=The oxygen cycle in the natural environment and the biogeochemical cycles|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin}} < /ref >

 :[[carbon dioxide]] + [[water]] + light energy → [[glucose]] + [[oxygen]] 
 :Carbon dioxide enters the leaf through the [[stomata]] by [[diffusion]] from the atmosphere. 
 :Water is absorbed from the soil by [[root hair]] cells, which have an increased surface area [[adapted]] for their uptake of water. 
 
 Photosynthesis occurs in the [[chloroplast]]s in leaves (or other green tissues). They contain [[chlorophyll]], the green pigment that absorbs light energy. In [[leaves]], [[palisade cell]]s have chloroplasts to capture light. 
 
 [[Oxygen]] is produced as a result of photosynthesis and released into the atmosphere through [[respiration]]. ''All the oxygen in the [[atmosphere]] has its origin in plants'' (including those microorganisms which do photosynthesis). 
 
 [[Glucose]] is used in respiration (to release energy in cells). It is stored in the form of [[starch]] (which is converted back to glucose for respiration in the dark). Glucose can also be converted into other compounds for growth and reproduction e.g. cellulose, nectar, fructose, amino acids and fats. 
 
 == The process == 
 [[File:Chloroplast-new.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a chloroplast]] 
 Photosynthesis has two main sets of reactions (phases). Light-dependent reactions which need light to do work; and light-independent reactions which do not need light to do work. 
 
 === Light-dependent phase === 
 Light energy from the [[sun]] is used to split water molecules ([[photolysis]]). The sunlight hits chloroplasts in the plant. This causes an [[enzyme]] to split the water. Water, when split, gives [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], and [[electron]]s. < ref > Dolai U. 2017. Chemical scheme of water-splitting process during photosynthesis by the way of experimental analysis. ''IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences'' '''12'''(6): 65-67. doi:10.9790/3008-1206026567. ISSN 2319-767 < /ref > 
 
 Hydrogen, along with electrons energized by light, converts NADP into [[NADPH]] which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen gas [[diffusion|diffuses]] out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis, and ATP is synthesized from [[ADP]] and [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[phosphate]]. This all happens in the [[grana]] of [[chloroplasts]]. 
 
 === Dark phase === 
 During this reaction, sugars are built up using carbon dioxide and the products of the light-dependent reactions (ATP and NADPH) and various other chemicals found in the plant in the [[Calvin Cycle]]. Therefore, the light-independent reaction cannot happen without the light-dependent reaction. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the plant and along with chemicals in the chloroplast, ATP, and NADPH, glucose is made and finally, transported around the plant by [[Translocation (botany)|translocation]]. 
 
 == Factors affecting photosynthesis == 
 {{Life timeline}} 
 There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis: 
 * Light [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] 
 * [[Carbon dioxide]] [[concentration]] 
 * [[Temperature]] 
 
 === Light intensity === 
 If there is little light shining on a plant, the light-dependent reactions will not work efficiently. This means that photolysis (breakdown of water by light) will not happen quickly, and therefore little NADPH and ATP will be made. This shortage of NADPH and ATP will lead to the light-independent reactions not working as NADPH and ATP are needed for the light-independent reactions to work. 
 
 The light intensity required is easily investigated in an aquatic plant such as [[pondweed]]. The oxygen bubbles given off can be counted or the volume measured. By changing the distance between light and plant, the light intensity is made to vary. Change in light intensity will affect the change in rate of photosynthesis. Artificial lighting can be used in the dark to maximise the photosynthetic rate. 
 
 === Carbon dioxide levels === 
 Carbon dioxide is used in the light-independent reactions. It combines with NADPH and ATP and various other chemicals to form glucose. Therefore, if there is not enough carbon dioxide, then there will be a build-up of NADPH and ATP and not enough glucose will be formed. 
 
 === Temperature === 
 There are many [[enzyme]]s working in photosynthetic [[chemical reaction|reactions]] – such as the enzyme in [[photolysis]]. All enzymes work best at their optimum temperature. All light-dependent and light-independent reactions will occur normally at average or optimum temperatures. Tropical plants have a higher temperature optimum than the plants adapted to temperate climates. 
 
 When the temperatures are too low, there is little kinetic energy, so the reaction rate decreases. If the temperatures are too high, the enzymes become ''denatured'' and the catalysis of photosynthesis reaction stops. 
 
 Greenhouses must keep an optimum temperature for normal functioning of plants. 
 
 == Early evolution == 
 The first photosynthetic organisms probably [[evolution|evolved]] early in the history of life. They may have used [[reducing agent]]s such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]] as sources of electrons, rather than water. < ref name=pmid16453059 > {{cite journal | author = Olson J.M. | title = Photosynthesis in the Archean era | journal = Photosyn.

 === Differences === 
 The photosystems of [[green sulfur bacteria]] and those of [[cyanobacteria]], [[algae]], and [[higher plants]] are not the same. That shows photosynthesis occurred not once, but several times over. < ref name= " Lockau " > {{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1993.tb05512.x |last1=Lockau |first1=Wolfgang |first2 = Wolfgang|last2= Nitschke | name-list-style = vanc |title=Photosystem I and its bacterial counterparts |journal=Physiologia Plantarum |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=372–381 |year=1993 }} < /ref >
