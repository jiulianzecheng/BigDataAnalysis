 '''''Thescelosaurus''''' was a medium-sized < ref >  2.5 and 4.0 meters (8.2 to 13.1 ft) in length on average. < /ref >  plant-eating [[dinosaur]]. It lived in forests during the late [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]] in [[North America]], about 68 to 65 million years ago.   
 
 One complete specimen and eight incomplete ''Thescelosaurus'' skeletons, including skin impressions, are known. They have been found in [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], and [[South Dakota]] in the [[United States|USA]], and in [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in [[Canada]]. 
 
 True ''Thescelosaurus'' remains are known definitely only from late [[Maastrichtian]]-age rocks, from  [[Canada]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]] ([[Hell Creek Formation|Hell Creek]]), and [[Colorado]] ([[Laramie Formation]]), USA.  
 
 With the exception of birds, it was one of the last genera of dinosaurs. Its remains were found three meters from the boundary clay containing the [[iridium]] layer that marks the end of the Cretaceous. < ref name= " KB86 " > {{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Kenneth|author2=Breithaupt, Brent H.|year=1986|title=Latest Cretaceous occurrences of nodosaurid ankylosaurs (Dinosauria, Ornithischia) in Western North America and the gradual extinction of the dinosaurs|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=6|issue=3|pages=251â€“257|doi=10.1080/02724634.1986.10011619}} < /ref >
