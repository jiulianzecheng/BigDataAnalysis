'''Cirrhosis''' is a [[disease]] of the [[liver]].  Normal liver tissue is replaced by [[scar]] [[tissue]]. The liver does not work so well.  
 
 Cirrhosis is caused mostly by [[alcoholism]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]] or [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]. Ascites (retention of fluid in the [[abdomen]]) is the most common complication for cirrhosis. The patient's skin develops a yellowish hue ([[jaundice]]) as the disease gets worse. Liver damage by cirrhosis cannot be repaired. It leads to a poor quality of life, and can cause death.
