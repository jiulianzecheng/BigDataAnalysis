 A mikoshi is a special type of portable shrine that is considered sacred in the Shinto religion in Japan. It is used to carry a deity during festivals or when moving to a new shrine. It looks like a small building with walls, pillars, a roof, a [[Verandah|veranda]], and a railing. 
 
 In Japanese,  " o- "  (お) is often added to the front to make the word  " omikoshi "  (お神輿). This prefix is used to show respect or politeness, and is commonly added to words that are considered important or sacred. 
 
 
 Moving a kami with one in a festival is called [[Shinko-shiki]]. Omikoshi are common in parades alongside [[Matsuri float|Matsuri floats]]
