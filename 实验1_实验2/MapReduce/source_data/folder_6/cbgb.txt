 '''CBGB''' was a [[New York City]] [[music]] [[nightclub]]. The letters  " CBGB "  stand for ''[[country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[blues]]''. The club was opened in 1973 by Hilly Kristal. CBGB, soon afterward, became a place where [[new wave]] and [[punk rock]] bands played. These included [[Patti Smith|Patti Smith Group]], [[Blondie]], [[Ramones]] and [[Talking Heads]]. From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for [[hardcore punk]]. 
 
 One store next to CBGB became the  " CBGB Record Canteen " , a record shop and caf√©. In the late 1980s, CBGB Record Canteen was changed into an [[art gallery]] and second performance space. The name was  " CB's 313 Gallery. "  CB's Gallery was played by artists of milder sounds, such as [[acoustic rock]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]] or [[experimental music]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=What's Playing|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/24/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-993069.html?pagewanted=3|access-date=Feb 18, 2016}} < /ref >  On the other side, CBGB had a small cafe and bar in the mid 1990s. The cafe served classic [[New York]] [[pizza]].
