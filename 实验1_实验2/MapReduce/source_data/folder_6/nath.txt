 '''Nath Sect''' (Nath Sampradaya in [[Hindi]]) is a religious sect under the  " [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] sect "  of Hinduism. Believed to be started with the origin of mythical god  &  incarnation of God [[Shiva]]  " Dattatrey " . Dattatrey is believed to be the founder or the  " Aadi Guru "  (first teacher) of the Nath sect. The Nath sect is a tradition which indulges and practices many types of magical traditions like [[Tantra|Tantras]] (sorcery), [[Mantra|Mantras]] (spells), [[Siddha]] (yoga) etc. It is believed that  [[Gorakhnath]] was also a saint from this clan. He added many new traditions into this tradition like Siddha Yoga. Naths are also associated with  " Naga Sadhus "  believed to be the saints of highest ranks. Naths have the highest prominence in the Saints hierarchy. [[Gorakhnath]] (believed to be the last in Nath sect) himself was a incarnation of Shiva with many powers and the knowledge of wide ranges of bewitchment, [[mesmerism]], spells, spellbinding, and [[Wizard|sorcery]]. Presently these types of practices are common mainly in [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. Someone who masters this type of practices can also be called a  " Tantrik " .
