A '''marina'''  is a [[dock]]  with places for [[Yacht|yachts]] and small boats. A marina differs from a port in that a marina does not handle large passenger ships or [[cargo]].  Most marinas are by the sea or on lakes, but there are some inland on [[Canal|canals]] and rivers. They only started in the twentieth century when boating for pleasure became popular. There are usually shops selling supplies for the boats.
