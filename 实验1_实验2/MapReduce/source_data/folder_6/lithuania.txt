It borders [[Latvia]] to the [[north]], [[Belarus]] to the [[southeast]], [[Poland]] to the [[south]] and [[Russia]] to the [[southwest]]. It is one of the [[Baltic states]]. The country's [[area]] is 65,300 km² and there are about 2.8 million people who live in Lithuania. The [[national language]] is the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] language, which is spoken by around 3 million people. [[Vilnius]] is the [[capital (city)|capital]] and largest city.

 The colors of the [[Flag of Lithuania|Lithuanian flag]] are yellow (at the top), for the sun, green (in the middle), for the fields, and red (at the bottom), for the blood of Lithuanians fighting for its independence. 
 
 == History == 
 Lithuania began to turn into a country in the [[7th century|7th]]–[[9th century|9th]] [[centuries]] from [[Baltic countries|Baltic nations group]]. The Balts, the [[ancestor]]s of Lithuanians and [[Latvia]]ns, came to the area between [[Nemunas]], [[Daugava]] [[rivers]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], from a supposed original homeland of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]s. Many [[scientist]]s think they came there sometime in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. 
 
 The traditional date of the beginning of the country is 1236 when the Lithuanians won the [[Battle of Šiauliai]] (Battle of Sun). 
 
 Lithuania (at that time - The [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) made a Treaty with [[Poland]] in 1569. The country was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1795, ending the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It got back its [[independence]] on February 16, 1918.  
 In 1940 the country became a Soviet republic and joined to the [[Soviet Union]]. 
 On June 22, 1941, after German invasion, the republic was occupied. It continued until 1944.  
 Lithuania re-declared its independence on March 11, 1990. Currently, Lithuania is an [[independent]], semi-[[president]]ial, [[democratic]] [[republic]]. 
 
 == Politics == 
 [[File:Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and Vice President Dick Cheney in Vilnius, Lithuania.jpg|thumb|left|Valdas Adamkus, a former president and US vice-president Dick Cheney in Vilnius]] 
 
 Lithuania has been a member of NATO and the European Union since 2004. 
 
 Lithuania is a semi presidential republic, that restored its independence and democracy in 1990. Since then, very important reforms were made and Lithuania is now declared as a democratic state that grants the human rights. 
 
 The Constitution that was adopted in 1992 declares that the leader of the country is the President, who must be elected to take office. The elections are held every 5 years. If the President breaks their oath, they can be forced to resign by the Parliament. The President also represents Lithuania abroad and is the commander-in-chief. 
 
 The legislative power of Lithuania is called the Seimas, or Parliament. There are 141 members of Seimas who are elected for 4-year-terms. Seimas passes the laws that must be executed by the government, that is formed in Seimas, and it must be accepted by the President. The Prime Minister is set and fired by the President. 
 
 The justice is under the power of the courts. The supreme court in Lithuania is the Constitutional Court. 
 
 == Administrative subdivisions ==

 == Education == 
 [[File:Vilnius University in 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Vilnius University Great Yard in 2006]] 
 
 The nursery schools and the kindergartens are the first-level education forms. However, they are not compulsory. The children start attending the primary school at age 7, where educational programs last for 4 years; then they must start attending secondary school (5th to 10th grades). After finishing 8th or 10th grade, the student can continue learning at the high school or choose courses at the vocational college. The students who finish the high school can join colleges and universities. Higher education is free for the students whose annual median of grades is 8 or higher.
