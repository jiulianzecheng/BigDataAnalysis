Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable. People who have eaten [[food]] usually will feel less hungry, or not hungry at all. People can live longer without food than without [[water]]. 
 
 '''Hunger''' is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat, and are therefore often hungry. This can lead to [[starvation]].
