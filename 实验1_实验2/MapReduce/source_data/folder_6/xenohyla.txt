 '''''Xenohyla''''' is a genus of [[Tree frog|tree frogs]] in the family [[Hylidae]]. They [[endemic|live in]] [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|deserts and other dry]] [[habitat|places]] in the middle of [[Brazil]], not far from the Atlantic Ocean.

 ''[[Xenohyla truncata]]'' is the only known [[amphibian]] [[Frugivore|that eats fruit]]. It finds the fruit and swallows it whole. The seeds from the fruit come out of its body in its [[feces|waste]], which helps the plant spread. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=8 August 1989|title=Frugivory and Seed Dispersal by Hyla truncata, a Neotropical Treefrog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220033856|journal=Copeia|via=ResearchGrade}} < /ref >  This frog also eats insects and other [[arthropod|animals without bones]].  How much depends on the time of year.

 The genus name comes from [[Ancient Greek]] xeno (ξένος meaning  " strange "  or  " alien " ) and hyla (ὕλη meaning  " wood "  or  " forest " ) which is used for [[Tree frog|tree frogs]], so the genus name means  " strange tree frog. "  ''Xenohyla truncata'' means  " strange truncated tree frog "  after the short shape of its body. ''Xenohyla eugenioi'' is named after [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[Herpetology|amphibian scientist]] [[Eugênio Izecksohn]] who wrote the first formal paper about the genus and type species. The name means  " Eugênio's strange tree frog. "
