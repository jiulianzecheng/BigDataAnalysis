 '''Overburden''' is the [[material]] that sits on top of an area where [[Mining|miners]] or [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] want to dig. In mining, it is usually the [[soil]] or [[rock (geology)|rock]] that sits on top of a [[coal]] or [[ore]] deposit. The soil needs to be removed to get to the minerals or objects below.
