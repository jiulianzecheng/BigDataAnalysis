 '''Trechnotheria''' is a group of [[mammal]]s that includes the [[theria]]ns and some [[fossil]] mammals from the [[Mesozoic]] Era. In the [[Jurassic]] through [[Cretaceous]] periods, the group was only found in the area which is  now modern [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. < ref name =  " PBDB " / > 
 
 When the group Trechnotheria was first defined, it was said to be a  " superlegion " . Since then it has been given many different ranks. < ref name =  " McKenna  &  Bell 1997 " / >  Later, a definnition based on nodes was created for Trechnotheria. This [[clade]] was imcluded the last common [[ancestor]] of ''[[Zhangheotherium]]'' and living [[theria]]n mammals and all of its [[wikt:descentant|descentants]]. < ref name =  " Kielan-Jaworowska et al. 2004 " / > 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Like most mammal groups from the Mesozoic Era, early trechnotherians are known mainly from their [[Tooth|teeth]]. One of the features of this group which is the most noticable is their large teeth.  The features of the [[Scapula|shoulder blade]], [[tibia]], [[humerus]], and [[ankle |ankle joint]] are also used to define which animals are in this clade. < ref name =  " Luo et al. 2002 " / >
