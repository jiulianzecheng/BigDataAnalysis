[[File:Touchet-formation-2.JPG|thumb|250px|alt= This photo shows a canyon cut into the surrounding flat soil with 32 distinct horizontal layers of soil, each clearly demarked from the layer below. Above the canyon a farm house can be seen n the distance - the farm house provide the perspective that helps the viewer establish that the cut is over 40 deep. The bottom of the cut is filled with tumble weeds. | " Little Grand Canyon "  of [[Touchet River]] near Lowden in the [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] valley. Note distinct layers]]

 A '''rhythmite''' is layers of [[sediment]] or [[sedimentary rock]] laid down in a repeated pattern. This pattern may be [[varve]]s, which are an annual pattern, or shorter or longer-term rhymites. [[Tide]]s in some places have left rhythmites. < ref name= " Flemming " > Flemming B.W.  &  Bartholoma A. 1995 ''Tidal signatures in modern and ancient sediments''.

 == Longer-term rhythmites == 
 Rhythmites can show long-term prehistoric events, such as periodic floods, [[sea level]] changes, [[glaciation]] changes, earth's [[Orbital forcing|orbital variation]]s, and other periodic [[climate change]]s. 
 
 Many rock formations show repeating patterns of [[strata]]. For example, [[clay]] layers may alternate with [[sandstone]] layers; or [[carbonate]] layers alternate with [[shale]]s. This is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate. In warmer times the sea rises, and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow [[subtropical]] seas. Later, [[ice]] builds up at the poles and the [[sea level]] drops. Then the same area is close to [[shore]], and gets [[sand]] and [[mud]] washed down by [[river]]s. 
 
 Deposits on land show patterns for similar reasons. A low-lying area will be a [[lake]] or a [[swamp]] during hot, wet periods, and maybe a [[desert]] or a [[mudflat]] during dry periods. [[Erosion]] takes place during the dry periods, and [[sediment|deposition]] takes place during the wet periods. 
 
 However, temperature and sea-level changes are not the only causes of rhythmites. In [[volcanic]] areas a pattern of deposition in [[lake]]s may be regularly interrupted by [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]] of [[volcanic ash]], so that in the record of the rocks [[shale]]s and [[mudstone]] alternates with [[tuff]].
