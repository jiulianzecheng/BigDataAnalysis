 In [[stratigraphy]], '''bedrock''' is the common term for solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]] under the surface of the [[Earth]]. Above the bedrock is usually an area of broken and weathered rock, [[soil]], [[sand]], [[pebbles]], [[etc]]. 
 
 The top of the bedrock is known as the '''rockhead''' and identifying this, via excavations, drilling or [[Geophysics|geophysical]] methods, is an important task in most [[civil engineering]] projects. Loose material on top (known as '''drift''') can be extremely thick, so that the bedrock lies hundreds of meters below the surface. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/newsletter/2004No.1.pdf |title=Swinford,E.Mac What the glaciers left behind - drift thickness map of Ohio, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey, newsletter 2004, No.1. |format=PDF |access-date=2012-09-12 |archive-date=2012-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002225931/http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/10/pdf/newsletter/2004No.1.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 A 'solid' [[geologic map]] of an area will usually show the rock that would be exposed at the surface if all [[soil]] or other superficial deposits were removed. < ref name= " BGS " > {{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/digitalmaps/digmapgb_solid.html|title=Digital Geology - Bedrock geology theme|last=BGS|access-date=2009-11-12| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091213185511/http://www.bgs.ac.uk/products/digitalmaps/digmapgb_solid.html| archive-date= 13 December 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref >
