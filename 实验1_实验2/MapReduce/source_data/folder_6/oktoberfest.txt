 The '''Oktoberfest''' (also called '''Wiesn''') is a [[Germany|German]] [[festival]] that takes place on the [[Theresienwiese]], a public place in the center of [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]]. It is every year, in late September and early October. It is a big [[social]] event. There is lots of eating and drinking. It is on for sixteen days ending on the first Sunday in October. If this is the first or the second the festival is extended to the end on 3 October, the [[Day of German Unity]]. This is the day when [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]] [[German reunification|joined into one country again]] in 1990. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first Oktoberfest was on 12 October 1810. The feast was for the [[wedding]] of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Sachsen-Hildburghausen. The feast lasted for ''5 days''. There was music, eating and drinking. At the end of it there was a big horse-race. The next years they had this horse-race and the feast again, because the people had liked it so much. 
 
 On 26 September 1980, a [[right-wing]] [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] [[terrorist]] [[Oktoberfest bombing|killed]] 12 people and himself using a [[improvised explosive device|bomb]]. 
 
 ==Today== 
 Today the Oktoberfest is the world's largest fair, and it has become very famous and popular. About six million people visit it every year. Many people and [[tourist]]s from all over the world come to Munich for Oktoberfest. Other cities have copied the Oktoberfest, and now they also hold feasts that are similar to the Oktoberfest. 
 
 One of the famous attractions is a [[big dipper]] called the  " Wilde Maus "  which means  " Wild mouse "  in English.
