 '''''Kinderszenen''''' (original spelling ''Kinderscenen'', ({{lang-en|Scenes from Childhood}}), [[Opus number|Opus]] & nbsp;15, is a set of 13 pieces for solo [[piano]] by [[Robert Schumann]]. It was [[publish]]ed in 1838. Schumann was looking back on his childhood when composing these pieces. He had originally written 30 movements for '''Scenes from Childhood'''. He chose only 13 for the final set. The unused movements were published years later in ''Bunte Blätter'', Opus & nbsp;99, and ''Albumblätter'' ({{lang-en|Album Leaves, Opus & nbsp;124}}).  
 
 Schumann originally titled the work ''Leichte Stücke'' ({{lang-en|Easy Pieces}}). The titles for the individual pieces were only added after the music was complete. Schumann described the titles as  " nothing more than delicate hints for execution and interpretation " . < ref > {{cite journal | last1=Thorpe | first1=Day | title=Music Reviews: ''Kinderszenen'', Op. & nbsp;15; ''Album für die Jugend'', Op. & nbsp;68 (Urtext) | journal=Notes (2nd Ser.) | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=605–606 |date=December 1990 | doi=10.2307/893060 | last2=Schumann | first2=Robert | last3=Von Irmer | first3=Otto | last4=Lampe | first4=Walther | jstor=837021}} < /ref >  Timothy Taylor has discussed Schumann's choice of titles for this work in the context of the changing situation of music in 19th century culture and economics. < ref > {{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Timothy D. | title=Aesthetic and Cultural Issues in Schumann's  " Kinderszenen "  | journal=International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=161–178|date=December 1990 | doi=10.2307/837021 | jstor=837021}} < /ref >  In 1974, Eric Sams noted that there is no known complete manuscript of ''Kinderszenen''. < ref > {{cite journal | last1=Sams | first1=Eric | authorlink=Eric Sams|title=Schuman scenes | journal=[[The Musical Times]] | volume=115 | issue=1572 | pages=146 | year=1974| doi=10.2307/955016 | last2=Schumann | last3=Goebels | first3=Franzpeter | jstor=955016}} < /ref >
