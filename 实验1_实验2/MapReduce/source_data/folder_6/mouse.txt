 A '''mouse''' ([[plural]] ''mice'') is a small [[rodent]], which is a kind of [[mammal]].   
 It has a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. Most belong to the mus genus. The best known mouse species is the common [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''). Usually, house mice are brownish-gray. It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are also common. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter. 
 
 These small [[animal]]s are often used in [[science]] [[experiment]]s, or sometimes kept as [[pet]]s. < ref > http://animal.discovery.com/mammals/mouse-info.htm < /ref >  Some mice carry [[disease]]s. In some places they damage [[crops]]. This causes some people to think of mice as [[vermin]] or [[pest (biology)|pest]]s. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Leirs H |title=The Year of the Rat ends: time to fight hunger! |journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=65 |issue=4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1002/ps.1718 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121686000/abstract |pmid=19206089 |pages=351–2 |access-date=2013-10-28 |archive-date=2012-12-17 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121217192631/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121686000/abstract |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A|title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|url=http://www.informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408410902989837 |pmid=19548807 |pages=221–70|s2cid=205694138}} < /ref >  Many other people think mice are cute and fun animals.  
 
 Mice are rodents, therefore they are related to [[squirrel]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[beaver]]s. Mice eat [[weed]]s, [[seed]]s, [[berries]], and more. They are eaten by [[owl]]s, [[foxes]], snakes, weasels, and [[cat]]s, amongst others. 
 
 == Types of mice == 
 The word  " mouse "  should only be used for small [[Murinae|murines]], but does get used for other distantly-related small rodents. The murines are the largest subfamily of mammals. In fact, it is larger than almost all mammal [[order (biology)|orders]]. 
 
 === House mouse === 
 {{main|House mouse}} 
 The common house mouse is thought of as a pest.  They are found in the homes of humans. 
 
 === Vole === 
 {{Main|Vole}} 
 Voles are ''not'' mice, they are in a different family of rodents.  
 
 === Deer mouse === 
 These are not mice either, or only distantly related. These mice live in forests. They can run and jump better than mice, and they get their common name from this. 
 
 The aggressive ''grasshopper mouse'' rarely eats other mice, but it does like grasshoppers and insects. It is also only a distant relative. 
 
 == Mice in media == 
 [[Anthropomorphism]] makes cartoon mice look and act more like people than like real mice.  For example, the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] characters [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] walk, talk, and act like people.  Jerry, the mouse star of [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoons, is similarly humanized.
