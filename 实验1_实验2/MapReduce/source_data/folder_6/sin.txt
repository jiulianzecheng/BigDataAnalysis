 A '''sin''' is a [[evil|bad]] act. Particularly, it is a bad act against another [[person]](s), an [[animal]], a [[spirit]], or a [[god]].  
 
 In [[Abrahamic religions]], such as [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], it is an act that goes against what [[God]] wants. It turns people away from God and true happiness. In [[Exodus]] chapter 20, [[Moses]] was given the [[Ten Commandments]] by God, explaining important sins like [[murder]] and [[idol]]atry. This is not believed by all people, and not all societies have the same idea of sin. 
 
 There is a difference between sins and prohibitions. For example, [[Muslim]]s and Jews say that it is wrong to eat [[pork]], and [[Hindu]]s do not eat [[beef]]. That is for them, but for others it is not wrong to eat these things.
