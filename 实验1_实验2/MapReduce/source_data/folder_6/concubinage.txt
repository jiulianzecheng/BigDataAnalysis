 '''Concubinage''' is the state of a [[woman]] in a [[relationship]] with a man of higher [[social status]] that gives her less rights than a [[marriage]]. In most of the cases the [[man]] has an official [[wife]] and one or more concubines. Concubines have only limited rights of support from the man, and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives; these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. 
 
 Historically, the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with a mighty man, as it brought economic security.  But concubinage could also mean [[sexual slavery]]. 
 
 
 In the [[Western world]] there is no legal status of concubines, as only [[monogamous]] [[marriage]]s are recognized. Any other relationship does not enjoy [[legal]] protection; the woman is necessarily a mistress.
