 '''''Timema''''' is a [[genus]] of short-bodied, somewhat thicker [[stick insect]]s.

 Compared to other stick insects ([[Order (biology)|order]] [[Phasmatodea]]), the genus ''Timema'' is [[basal]]. It is the earliest living branch to diverge from the [[phylogenetic]] tree of the Phasmatodea. To emphasize this, all other stick insects  are sometimes described as  " Euphasmatodea. " 
 
 Five of the 21 [[species]] of ''Timema'' are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], including two species that have done sexual reproduction for a million years. This is the longest known asexual period for any [[insect]]. < ref name=bbc > Davies, Ella. Sticks insects survive one million years without sex. ''BBC'' Nature News.

 ''Timema'' sticks are night-feeders: they spend daytime resting on the leaves or bark of the plants they feed on. They are [[camouflage]]d. ''Timema'' species have colours (green, gray, or brown) and patterns (stripes or dots) which match their background. < ref name=coloration > Sandoval, Cristina P.  &  Crespi, Bernard J. 2008.
