 '''Pediatrics''' is the [[Medical Specialty|specialty]] of medicine that cares for infants, children, and adolescents. The ages can vary from the early months until 18-21. A person who works in pediatrics is called a '''pediatrician'''.  
 
 Pediatricians can be primary care [[Medical doctor|doctors]] or they can be specialists. 
 
 Pediatricians take care of [[disease]]s that children get. They also make sure that children develop normally and try to prevent illness. One of the most important ways that children's diseases can be prevented is by [[immunization]]. Immunization is also called [[vaccination]]. 
 
 In the nineteenth century, one in five children died before the age of five. Most of these deaths were from [[infection|infectious diseases]]. Today ''some'' of these deaths are prevented by treating disease when it happens. Most of it is from preventing disease with immunizations. 
 
 Pediatricians also try to prevent other diseases and injury before they happen. They teach [[parent]]s about safety and nutrition. They may teach older children or ''adolescents'' about avoiding injury or [[addiction]] to [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]. Because childhood is such a time of change, prevention is a major part of pediatrics.
