 '''Dogana''' is a town and a civil parish (curazia), whose name means 'Customs House'. It is found in the north-eastern corner of [[San Marino]] in the [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]] municipality ('castello'). The town is the most populated settlement in the republic. < ref name=a > {{in lang|it}} [http://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/ Serravalle and Dogana at sanmarinosite.com] < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 The town is found at the northernmost point of San Marino after [[Falciano]], close to the border with [[Italy]], in the [[province of Rimini]]. 
 
 == History == 
 It has a population of roughly 7,000. Because of its size, in 2006 it asked to split away from Serravalle and become its own ''castello'', but in 2007 the proposal was refused. < ref name=a/ >  Partial autonomy is seen in Dogana's having its own postal code (47891), while the rest of Serravalle carries 47899. 
 
 == Economy == 
 Dogana is the main entry point for travellers arriving into San Marino from [[Italy]] (by freeway no. 72 from [[Rimini]]). Although ''Dogana'' means ''[[Custom House|customs house]]'' in Italian, there are no border formalities anywhere on the border between [[Italy]] and San Marino. 
 
 == Sport == 
 The local football team is the [[A.C. Juvenes/Dogana|Juvenes]].
