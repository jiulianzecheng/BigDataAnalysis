 The '''Ghats''' are two [[mountain range]]s at the eastern and western edges of the [[Deccan Plateau]] in southern [[India]]. The Ghats are separated from the coasts of the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]] by fairly level coastal land.  
 
 The [[Eastern Ghats]] are broken into several hill masses that are unlike each other and have a northeast-southwest trend along the Bay of Bengal. The [[Western Ghats]] are steep on the seaward side but gently sloping on the side of the Deccan plateau.
