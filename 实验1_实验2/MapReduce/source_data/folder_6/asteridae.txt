 '''Asteridae''' is a [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] term with the rank of [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]]. By definition it always includes the family [[Asteraceae]] (Compositae). However, in the modern [[APG III system]] of classification, < ref > Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009.

Their member families are similar to those of the Asteridae. 
 
 One of the better-known systems that recognized subclass Asteridae was the [[Cronquist system]], which included the [[order (biology)|orders]]: 
 
 * [[Gentianales]] 
 * [[Solanales]] 
 * [[Lamiales]] 
 * [[Callitrichales]] 
 * [[Plantaginales]] 
 * [[Scrophulariales]] 
 * [[Campanulales]] 
 * [[Rubiales]] 
 * [[Dipsacales]] 
 * [[Calycerales]] 
 * [[Asterales]] 
 
 Most of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent [[sequence analysis|molecular systematic studies]].
