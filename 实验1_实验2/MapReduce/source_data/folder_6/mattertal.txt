 '''Mattertal''' is a valley in the [[European Alps|Alps]] of [[Switzerland]] which begins on the side of the [[Matterhorn]]. The ''Matterhorn'' is one of the most famous mountains in the world because of its beauty, and because it is hard to climb.  
 
 The ''Mattertal'' is a valley that was made by a [[glacier]] (a slowly-moving river of ice) moving down from the mountain. This can be seen from the deep U shape of the valley. (Valleys made by a fast-running stream are V-shaped). Because the sides of the valley are very steep, there are often landslides. One can be seen in the photo taken near Randa village. Many houses in the villages are called [[chalet]]s. These can be seen in the picture of Täsch village. 
 
 In the Mattertal are villages which include [[Zermatt]], [[Täsch]], [[Randa, Switzerland|Randa]], [[Grächen]], and [[St. Niklaus, Switzerland|St. Niklaus]]. Many tourists like to stay in the villages to see the view, to go [[walking]], [[skiing]] or [[mountaineering|mountain climbing]]. The traditional work of the people is [[dairy]] farming, but many people work in the [[tourism|tourist industry]].
