 '''Polyurethane''' is a [[polymer]]. Its name is often shortened to ''PU'' or ''PUR''. Polyurethane is made of organic units, which are joined by [[urethane]]. Polyurethane polymers are formed through [[step-growth polymerization]]. In this process, a [[monomer]] containing at least two [[isocyanate]] [[functional group]]s reacts with another monomer containing at least two [[hydroxyl]] ([[alcohol]]) groups in the presence of a [[catalyst]]. 
 
 Polyurethane is available with different levels of stiffness, hardness or [[Density|densities]]. Examples for such materials are: 
 * Low-density flexible [[foam]] used in [[upholstery]] 
 * Low-density rigid foam used for [[thermal insulation]] and [[Transfer molding|RTM]] cores 
 * Soft solid [[elastomers]] used for gel pads and print rollers 
 * Low density [[elastomers]] used in [[footwear]] 
 * Hard solid plastics used as electronic instrument [[Bezel|bezels]] and structural parts 
 
 Polyurethanes are widely used in high resiliency flexible foam seating, rigid foam insulation panels, microcellular foam [[seal (mechanical)|seal]]s and [[gasket]]s, durable elastomeric wheels and tires, automotive suspension [[bushing]]s, electrical potting compounds, high performance [[adhesive]]s and sealants, [[Spandex]] [[Synthetic fiber|fibers]], seals, gaskets, [[carpet]] underlay, and hard plastic parts. 
 
 Polyurethane products are often called  " urethanes " . They should not be confused with the specific substance [[urethane]], also known as [[ethyl carbamate]]. Polyurethanes are neither produced from ethyl carbamate, nor do they contain it.
