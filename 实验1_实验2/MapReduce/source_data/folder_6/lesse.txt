 The '''Lesse''' ({{lang-wa|Aiwe di Lesse}}) is a [[river]] in the [[Ardennes (forest)|Ardennes]], in the [[Wallonia|Walloon region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is a right tributary to the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. 
 
 ==Geography==

 The Lesse is {{Convert|89|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long. It flows roughly in a northwestern direction. Its [[source (river or stream)|source]] is near [[Libramont-Chevigny]], in the Belgian province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]]. The mean [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] for Anseremme between 1995 and 2004 was 19.0 m < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref name= " debit " > Région Wallonne de Belgique: ''[http://environnement.wallonie.be/directive_eau/edl_ssb/le/Le22.pdf État des lieux du sous-bassin hydrographique de la Lesse] (PDF; 5,9 & nbsp;MB)'', 2005, S. 8 < /ref > 
 
 The [[watershed]] of the Lesse Basin, with an area of {{Convert|1343.4|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, has about {{Convert|1920|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. With only 62,500 people living there, it is the least densely populated of all small watersheds of Walloon region. 
 
 Part of the [[watershed]] of the Lesse is on [[limestone]] where there are some [[karst]]ic [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]. Near [[Han-sur-Lesse]] (commune of [[Rochefort]]), by the ''Gouffre de Belvaux'', the entire river goes underground, flowing through [[limestone]] [[cave]]s. 
 
 The Lesse flows into the river [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] in the town of Anseremme, [[commune]] of [[Dinant]], [[Namur (province)|Namur]] province. 
 
 ===Tributaries=== 
 From its source to its mouth, the main [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the Lesse are: 
 * Our, left tributary; it joins the Lesse near [[Redu]]. 
 * Almache, left tributary; it joins the Lesse in [[Daverdisse]]. 
 * Lomme, right tributary; it joins the Lesse in [[Éprave]]. 
 * Wimbe, left tributary; it joins the Lesse in [[Villers-sur-Lesse]]. 
 * Vachaux, right tributary; it joins the Lesse in [[Ciergnon]].

 ==Attractions== 
 The valley of the Lesse and this part of the Ardennes are covered with [[forest]]s. The area surrounding the caves is the National Park Lesse et Lomme. On the [[mountain]]s along the lower part of the river there are several [[castle]]s. The route of the former [[railway]] line from Houyet to Rochefort is used as a [[hiking]] and [[cycling]] [[trail]]. 
 
 Many of the caves along the banks of the Lesse are important [[archaeological site]]s - these include the Trou de Chaleux (by the Cirque de Chaleux), and the Trou des Nutons and Trou du Frontal at Furfooz. 
 
 It is possible to go down the Lesse in [[kayak]] or [[canoe]] from Houyet to Anseremme.
