 == Geography == 
 
 === Location === 
 This state-recognized [[resort]] (''staatlich anerkannter Erholungsort'') is between [[Würzburg]] and [[Aschaffenburg]], in the middle of the [[Spessart]] Nature Park (''Naturpark Spessart''). 
 
 The municipal territory borders on the state of [[Hesse]] in places and is not continuous: Habichsthal is separated from Frammersbach proper by the wooded [[unincorporated area]] of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Frammersbacher Forst|de}}. On all other sides, the village is surrounded by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinrichsthaler Forst|de}} (placed in the neighbouring [[Aschaffenburg (district)|Aschaffenburg district]]). 
 
 Frammersbach is in the valley of the [[Lohr (river)|Lohr river]], while Habichsthal is in a side valley of the [[Aubach (Lohr)|Aubach]], which flows into the Lohr at [[Partenstein]]. Out of a total municipal area of around 2,000 hectares, about 700 hectares are covered by communally-owned forest.
