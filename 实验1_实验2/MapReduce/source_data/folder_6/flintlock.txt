 A '''flintlock''' is a general term for [[firearm]]s that use the flintlock firing [[mechanism]]. It can also refer just to the firing mechanism itself. < ref name=derpvault > {{cite web |url=http://derpwell.weebly.com/history-on-flintlock--guns.html |title=A Brief History on Flintlocks and Guns |publisher=Derpwell's Vault |access-date=2 August 2016}} < /ref >  A flintlock uses a piece of [[flint]] held in a locking jaw. When the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] is pulled, a hammer with the flint attached falls, striking a piece of steel called a  " frizzen " . This causes a [[spark]] which causes the [[gunpowder]] in the pan (directly below the flint) to [[Combustion|ignite]]. Through a small hole, this ignites the main powder charge in the [[wikt:breech|breech]] of the gun causing it to fire the round ball, [[wikt:shot|shot]] or [[bullet]]. The flintlock was a very popular type of [[musket]] for over 200 years. < ref name=milfact > {{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/flintlock-guns.asp |title=Flintlock Guns |publisher=Military Factory |access-date=2 August 2016}} < /ref >  Flintlocks were available with [[smoothbore]] and later [[Rifling|rifled]] [[gun barrel]]s. < ref name=Tucker220 > ''The Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Early American Republic, 1783–1812'', ed.

 == History == 
 The first form of flintlock appeared in 1570 and was called a '''snaphaunce'''. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.sca-isles.org/Articles/firearm/snap.html |title=Snaphaunce |website=Shire of Isles |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |access-date=2 August 2016 |archive-date=21 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921185635/http://www.sca-isles.org/Articles/firearm/snap.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  About 1630, [[France|Frenchman]] [[Marin le Bourgeoys]] created the first  " true "  flintlock, also called the  " French lock " . < ref name=Kinard24 > Jeff Kinard, ''Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'' (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2004), p. 24 < /ref >  Bourgeoys was in the service of [[King]] [[Louis XIII of France]] for whom he created the flintlock [[mechanism]]. < ref name=Kinard24/ >  The French lock simplified the Snaphaunce design by creating a one-piece, L-shaped frizzen. This is the style seen on most flintlocks today. 
 
 Like earlier designs such as the [[matchlock]], the flintlock design was used for smoothbore long guns or [[musket]]s. < ref name=firearmsguide > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearms.guide/guns/early-firearm-history |title=Early Firearms History |publisher=The Firearms Guide |access-date=2 August 2016 |archive-date=1 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701114942/http://www.thefirearms.guide/guns/early-firearm-history |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  But soon it was used for  [[shotgun]]s and [[pistol]]s. [[Officer]]s on sailing [[ship]]s and army officers used flintlock pistols as well. < ref name=firearmsguide/ > 
 
 == Famous flintlocks == 
 === Long guns === 
 
 * Popularly called the  " [[Brown Bess]] " , The British Land Pattern Musket - was produced between 1725 and 1838, the Land Pattern and its [[wikt:version|version]]s were all .75 [[caliber]] smoothbore muskets. They were the standard guns for all land forces in the [[British Empire]]. < ref name=milfact/ >  They were replaced after 1838 by smoothbore [[percussion cap]] muskets. < ref name=milfact/ >  Its effective range was about {{convert|100|yds}} but in most battle situations the distance between forces was only about {{convert|50|yds}}. < ref name=Hickman > {{cite web |url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/smallarms/p/brownbess.htm |title=American Revolution:  " Brown Bess "  Musket |author=Kennedy Hickman |date=21 May 2015 |website=About Education |publisher=About.com |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-date=2 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602141809/http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/smallarms/p/brownbess.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Even at that range the gun was not particularly accurate. The British tactic was to fire in [[wikt:volley|vollies]] followed by a [[bayonet]] attack. < ref name=Hickman/ > 
 
 * [[Pennsylvania rifle]], after the early 1880s called the  " Kentucky rifle "  - The Pennsylvania rifle developed from earlier and much heavier Jaeger rifle which were brought to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] by German [[gunsmith]]s. < ref name=explorePAHIST > {{cite web |url=http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-333 |title=Pennsylvania Rifle Historical Marker |publisher=Explore PA History |access-date=29 July 2016}} < /ref >  During the [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Company (military unit)|companies]] of Pennsylvania riflemen created [[wikt:disrupt|disrupt]]ion behind the [[British]] lines. < ref name=Klein102 > Philip S. Klein; Ari Arthur Hoogenboom, ''History of Pennsylvania'' (University Park; London: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1980), p. 102 < /ref >  Well out of range of the British Brown Bess muskets, [[militia]]men and [[sniper]]s with rifled Pennsylvania rifles could target individual [[soldier]]s and officers from a long distance. < ref name=Klein102/ > 
 
 * [[Springfield Model 1795 Musket]] - patterned after the French [[Charleville musket]], was the first U.S. flintlock musket to be produced at the [[Springfield Armory]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nramuseum.org/guns/the-galleries/a-prospering-new-republic-1780-to-1860/case-7-early-american-military-arms/us-springfield-model-1795-flintlock-musket-type-i.aspx |title=U.S. Springfield Model 1795 Flintlock Musket Type I |publisher=NRA National Firearms Museum |access-date=2 August 2016}} < /ref >  Designed by [[Eli Whitney]] it was the first gun to use [[interchangeable parts]]. < ref name=StottJSW > {{cite web |url=http://johnniestott.weebly.com/events/the-us-musket-model-1795 |title=The U.S Musket Model 1795 |author=John Stott |date=17 April 2014 |publisher=johnniestott.weebly.com/ |access-date=2 August 2016}} < /ref >   Also produced at the [[Harpers Ferry Armory]], about 10,000 were delivered to the [[US Army]] for use in the War of 1812. < ref name=StottJSW/ > 
 
 * [[Fusil de chasse]] (French, meaning  " hunting gun " ) - by the mid-[[18th century]] a light flintlock musket carried by an officer was called a fusil (corruption of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''fucile'' meaning flint). < ref name=Troiani36 > Don Troiani; James L. Kochan; et al., ''Don Troiani's Soldiers in America, 1754-1865'' (Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1998), p. 36 < /ref >   Both the French and the British had versions of the officer's fusil.  From this name came the term [[fusilier]]. British officers of foot were originally armed with a [[spontoon]], but later the pole weapon was replaced by the officer's fusil. < ref name=Troiani36/ >  A very similar but cheaper version was the '' " fusil de traite " '' (trade gun). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://frenchinwisconsin.com/2012/02/a-fusil-by-any-other-name-french-era-guns/ |title=A Fusil by any other name – French era guns |publisher=The French in Wisconsin |access-date=2 August 2016 |archive-date=14 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814215617/http://frenchinwisconsin.com/2012/02/a-fusil-by-any-other-name-french-era-guns/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The officer's fusil is fitted for a sling and the stock is {{convert|4|in}} shorter than the barrel to fit a [[bayonet]]. The officer's fusil was much better made. At 20 gauge (.62 caliber) the fusil was also considered a fowling gun (early predecessor of the [[shotgun]]). < ref name=Troiani36/ >  Some American officers in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] also carried fusils.{{efn|[[wikt:reverend|Reverend]] [[John Rosbrugh]], the first American [[chaplain]] killed in battle, carried a French fusil. < ref > John Cunningham Clyde, ''Rosbrugh, a Tale of the Revolution'' (Easton PA, 1880), p. 55 < /ref > }}

 * Kentucky pistol - Introduced about the turn of the [[17th century]] it has remained basically unchanged. It is a somewhat [[wikt:awkward|awkward]] piece to load for inexperienced users. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/top-shot/videos/weapons-rundown-kentucky-flintlock-pistol |title=Weapons Rundown: Kentucky Flintlock Pistol |website=History; Top Shot |publisher=A & E Television Networks, LLC |access-date=3 August 2016}} < /ref >  The Kentucky had a tendency to [[hang fire]] (also called a [[wikt:misfire|misfire]]). The flint strikes the frizzen and ignites the powder in the pan but will at times burn slowly like a fuse. When this happens it is critical to keep it pointed at the target until it fires. The gun was typically .50 caliber and had an [[octagon]]al barrel. < ref name=Smithsonian > {{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_438594 |title=Pennsylvania/Kentucky Pistol |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History |access-date=3 August 2016}} < /ref >  The stock was typically [[curly maple]] and usually had a wood ramrod with a [[brass]] tip. < ref name=Smithsonian/ > 
 
 * [[Duelling pistol]]s - While not a specific gun it was a type of flintlock weapon. Duelling pistols were made in [[wikt:match|match]]ed [[wikt:pair|pair]]s and usually were in a case. They were often an ornate and highly decorated gun intended to be used in a [[duel]].{{efn|A cased set of flintlock dueling pistols was presented to [[George Washington]] in 1778 by Thomas Turner. < ref name=ACMHS > {{cite web |url=http://allencountymuseum.org/ACM2/F.html |title=F is for Flintlock |publisher=Allen County Museum  &  Historical Society |access-date=3 August 2016 |archive-date=17 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010433/http://allencountymuseum.org/ACM2/F.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Washington was opposed to dueling but accepted the finely crafted pistols. < ref name=ACMHS/ >  The set is in the [[U.S. Army]] [[Museum]] at [[United States Military Academy at West Point|West Point]]. < ref name=ACMHS/ > }} Until the [[19th century]] most were single-shot flintlock pistols. Like other flintlock pistols, there is a noticeable [[wikt:delay|delay]] between pulling the trigger and the gun firing.
