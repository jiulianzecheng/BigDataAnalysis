Its scientific name is ''Homo neanderthalensis'' or ''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis''. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Tattersall I, Schwartz JH |title=Hominids and hybrids: the place of Neanderthals in human evolution |journal=Proc.

 Neanderthal [[fossil]]s were only found in Europe, [[Asia Minor]] and up to [[central Asia]]. The first fossil was found in a [[limestone]] [[quarry]] near [[Düsseldorf]]: One of the workers found part of a [[skeleton]], in a valley called Neanderthal. Experts Johann Carl Fuhlrott and Hermann Schaaffhausen said the bones belonged to an older form of modern humans. These bones are known as [[Neanderthal 1]] today. 
 
 Recent research suggests Neanderthals became extinct about 40,000 years ago. < ref name= " BBC " > Amos, Jonathan 2013. Last-stand Neanderthals queried. ''BBC News Science/Environment''. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21330194] < /ref >  Earlier research had suggested a later date; the problem is the dating of the [[archaeological site]]s where their remains have been found. 
 
 Neanderthals perhaps evolved from ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and split off (last common ancestor) from modern humans between 700,000 and 300,000 years ago. < ref name=Than > Ker Than 2006. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15732243/ Scientists decode Neanderthal genes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103091513/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15732243/ |date=2007-01-03 }} < /ref > 
 
 Neanderthals used to be classified as a subspecies of modern humans (''Homo sapiens neanderthalensis''). Now, they are usually classified as a separate human species (''Homo neanderthalensis''). 
 
 Neanderthal remains have been found in most of Europe south of land covered by ice including the south coast of Great Britain. Finds have also been made outside of Europe in the Zagros Mountains and in the Levant. 
 
 == Mental capacity == 
 The size of the Neanderthal brain shows that Neanderthals were probably intelligent. On average, they had larger brains than modern humans. < ref > Stringer, Chris and Gamble, Clive 1993.''In search of the Neanderthals: solving the puzzle of human origins''. Thames  &  Hudson, London, p81{{ndash}}83. {{ISBN|0-500-27807-5}} < /ref >  Large brains have their disadvantages. That is because they use lots of energy, < ref > The human brain is about 2% of body weight, but uses about 20% of body energy. < /ref >  make the skull more likely to be damaged, and cause difficulties during birth. These disadvantages may be less than the advantages, for example, better problem-solving, better social co-operation, language and tool-making. 
 
 Neanderthal [[flint]] tools (for example, [[hand axe]]s) were more finely made than those of early man. They were much less varied and finely made than the [[neolithic]] tools of modern man. Known Neanderthal art is much less complex than contemporary art from ''H. sapiens''. < ref > Rodriguez-Vidal, Joaquin ''et al''. 2014.

[[Archaeologist]]s ask two key questions: 
 
 Is it a flute? This has been discussed at length. < ref > Morley, Iain 2006. Mousterian musicianship? The case of the Divje babe I bone. ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' '''25''' (4): 317–333.

 If it is a flute, was it made by Neanderthals? Again, this is not decided. It is on public display as a flute in the [[National Museum of Slovenia]] (Narodni Muzej Slovenije) in [[Ljubljana]].

 === Capacity for speech === 
 For a long time, people have wondered whether Neanderthals could [[speech|talk]]. Many people believe they could, because the large brain size would be hard to understand if they could not. When an undamaged Neanderthal [[hyoid]] bone was discovered, it made people think Neanderthals could talk. That is because, in humans, the hyoid is a support for the [[larynx|voice box]]. Computer analysis has shown that the Neanderthal hyoid was very similar to human hyoids. < ref > Hogenboom, Melissa 2013.  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25465102 Neanderthals could speak like modern humans, study suggests.] ''BBC News Science  &  Environment''. < /ref >  Researchers say  " our findings are consistent with a capacity for speech in the Neanderthals " . < ref > D'Anastasio R.

 == History of discoveries == 
 In August 1856 the specimen that was to become known as Neanderthal 1 was discovered in the Neander Valley, [[Germany]]. The material was found in a limestone quarry near [[Düsseldorf]]. A [[skull]] cap was first discovered, followed by two [[femur]]s, five arm bones, part of the left [[pelvis]], and fragments of a [[Scapula|shoulder blade]] and [[Rib cage|ribs]]. 
 
 Actually, some remains had been found earlier, but not recognised as a separate species from us. The Engis child from [[Belgium]] was the first Neanderthal discovered, in 1829. The second discovered was the Forbes Quarry find from Gibralter in 1848. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 [[File:Neanderthal profile.png|thumb|right|230px|The Neanderthal skull differs from our skulls in a number of ways]] 
 [[File:Sapiens neanderthal comparison.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Direct comparison]] 
 
 Neanderthal men were about 164–168 & nbsp;cm (5.3 & nbsp;ft) tall  and averaged 77.6 & nbsp;kg (171 & nbsp;lbs) in weight. Neanderthal women stood about 154 & nbsp;cm (5 & nbsp;ft)  tall and averaged 66.4 & nbsp;kg (146 & nbsp;lbs) in weight. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Froehle |first1=Andrew W |last2=Chruchill |first2=Steven E |year=2009 |title=Energetic competition between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans |journal=PaleoAnthropology |pages=96–116|url=http://www.paleoanthro.org/journal/content/PA20090096.pdf |accessdate=31 October 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 Neanderthals had stronger (more robust) build and distinctive [[Comparative anatomy|morphological]] features, especially of the [[skull]]. They were much stronger than modern humans; < ref > {{Cite web |title=Neanderthal |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/459.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 May 2009 |archive-date=31 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531233656/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/459.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  especially in the upper body. 
 
 Neanderthal long bones and joints are thicker than ours, and some long bones have a slight curve. Both the thickness and the curve suggest the need for more strength than our species. 
 
 === Young Neanderthals === 
 Since 2007, tooth age can be directly calculated using the noninvasive imaging of growth patterns in tooth enamel by means of [[x-ray]] synchrotron [[microtomography]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Tafforeau P, Smith TM |title=Nondestructive imaging of hominoid dental microstructure using phase contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=272–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18045654 |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.09.018 |url= }} < /ref > 
 
 This research suggests much more rapid physical development in Neanderthals than in modern human children. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Smith T.M. | display-authors = etal|title=Rapid dental development in a Middle Paleolithic Belgian Neanderthal |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=51 |pages=20220–5 |year=2007 |pmid=18077342 |pmc=2154412 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707051104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10420220S|url= | doi-access = free}} < /ref >  The x-ray synchrotron microtomography study of early ''H. sapiens'' argues that this difference existed between the two species as far back as 160,000 years before present. < ref > {{Cite journal|author=Smith T.M. | display-authors = etal |title=Earliest evidence of modern human life history in North African early Homo sapiens |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=15 |pages=6128–33 |year=2007 |pmid=17372199 |pmc=1828706 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700747104 |url= | doi-access = free }} < /ref > 
 
 ====Fractures==== 
 Neanderthals seemed to suffer a high frequency of fractures. These fractures are often healed and show little or no sign of infection, suggesting that injured individuals were cared for during times of incapacitation. 
 
 Neanderthals showed a frequency of such injuries comparable to that of modern [[rodeo]] professionals, showing frequent contact with large, combative mammals. The fractures suggest they may have hunted by leaping onto their prey and stabbing or even wrestling it to the ground. < ref > {{Cite journal|author = T.D. Berger and E.

 == Life style == 
 They lived in [[Eurasia]] during the [[ice age]]s of the [[Pleistocene]], and hunted large [[mammal]]s, such as [[bison]], [[auroch]] (an ancestor of living cattle), [[deer]], [[reindeer]], [[musk ox]] and [[mammoth]]. 
 
 The skulls are slightly larger than ''Homo sapiens'', and this implies intelligence and probably the use of language. The skeleton, on the other hand, suggests they tended to solve their problems (such as hunting) more by force than we do. 
 
 Neanderthal stone tools are called [[Mousterian]], and are an advance on the [[Acheulean]] tools made by earlier species of Man. ''Homo sapiens'' stone tools are far more varied still, and suggest that our species relied more on tools than the Neanderthals. 
 
 Neanderthals were almost exclusively meat eaters although their diet did include cooked vegetables. They made good tools and lived in complex social groups. Research on their remains has shown that it is possible that they had a spoken language but the nature of any such language is unknown. 
 
 There are a number of theories that try to explain why the Neanderthals died out. It has been suggested that they may have been unable to adapt to the changing climate. Alternatively it has been suggested that they were unable to successfully compete with the ancestors of modern humans.
