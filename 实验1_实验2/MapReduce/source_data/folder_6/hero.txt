 A '''hero''' is a real person or fictional character who, in the face of [[danger]], combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or strength. 
 
 In [[Greek mythology]], a hero is a [[demigod]], a half-god/half-human being. [[Herakles]], for example, was the son of the god [[Zeus]] and the mortal woman [[Alkmene]]. Heroes performed extraordinary feats and were worshipped in hero cults. 
 
 The word hero comes from the Greek ἥρως (hērōs),  " hero "  (literally  " protector "  or  " defender " ), particularly one such as Heracles with divine ancestry or later given divine honors. < ref > {{Cite web|title=hero {{!}} Origin and meaning of hero by Online Etymology Dictionary|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/hero|access-date=2021-05-12|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In the modern world, hero has lost its ancient meaning.  It now means someone who is [[courage]]ous ( " The firefighter who saved my baby is a hero. " ).  Heroes are  " heroic " , they have  " heroism " . They help in saving people or a society from bad people, villains, or natural disasters.  A hero can also be someone who is helpful, polite, or helping people who need it.  The word is used in the sports world to mean an extraordinary player or athlete ( " football hero " ,  " Olympic hero " , etc.).  The female equivalent of the male hero is the  " heroine " . 
 
 Sometimes, the [[protagonist]] (or main character) of a story is called the  " hero "  of the story.  Some fictional characters are [[superhero]]es.  
 
 The opposite of a hero is a [[villain]]. A female hero like [[Joan of Arc]] is called a '''heroine'''.
