 A '''hechsher''' ({{lang-he-n|הֶכְשֵׁר}}  " prior approval " ; plural: ''hechsherim'') is a symbol placed on [[food]] bought at a grocery store that is considered [[kosher]] by a professional kosher checker. 
 
 There are multiple hechschers given by different companies. One popular company is the [[OU]], which has a symbol of a  " U "  with a surrounding circle. Another popular company is the [[OK Kosher Certification|OK]], which has a symbol of a  " K "  with a surrounding circle.
