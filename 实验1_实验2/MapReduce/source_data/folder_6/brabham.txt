'''Motor Racing Developments Ltd.''', commonly known as '''Brabham''' ({{IPAEng|ˈbræbəm}}), was a [[United Kingdom|British]] company that built racing cars. It also ran a racing team in [[Formula One]]. It was founded in 1960 by two Australians, driver [[Jack Brabham]] and designer [[Ron Tauranac]]. The team won four [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|drivers']] and two [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|constructors']] world championships in its 30-year [[Formula One]] history. As of 2008, Jack Brabham's 1966 drivers' championship remains the only victory by a car bearing the driver's own name. 
 
 Brabham was the world's largest manufacturer of customer [[open wheel car|open wheel]] racing cars in the 1960s, and had built more than 500 cars by 1970. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in [[Formula Two]] and [[Formula Three]] and competed in the [[Indianapolis 500]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced innovations such as the controversial but successful 'fan car', in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and [[hydropneumatic suspension]]. The team won two more Formula One drivers' championships in the 1980s with Brazilian [[Nelson Piquet]], and became the first to win a drivers' championship with a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] car. 
 
 British businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]] owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later become responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the [[1992 Formula One season|1992 season]], the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the UK [[Serious Fraud Office (UK)|Serious Fraud Office]].
