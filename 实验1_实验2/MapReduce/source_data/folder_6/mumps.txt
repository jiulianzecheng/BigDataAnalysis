 '''Mumps''' is a [[viral]] [[disease]]. Only humans get it. Some of the most commons [[symptom]]s are [[fever]], [[headache]]s, swelling of the [[parotoid gland]]s, sore throat, and [[orchitis]] (which means swelling of the testicles).  
 
 Mumps can be diagnosed by the increase in alpha amylase isoenzymes in blood plasma. 
 
 The [[MMR vaccine]] stops [[measles]], mumps and [[rubella]]. Hence we can say that mumps can be prevented by MMR vaccination.
