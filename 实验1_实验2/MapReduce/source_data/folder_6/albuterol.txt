 == Other names for albuterol ==

 == What albuterol treats == 
 Sometimes, [[disease]]s like [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) make the bronchi get narrower.  This makes it harder for oxygen to get to the lungs.  This can cause [[dyspnea|trouble breathing]] or even [[respiratory failure]], which means the body is [[ischaemia|not getting enough oxygen]] to survive. < ref name= " Medline "  / > < ref name= " NHS "  / > 
 
 Every part of the body needs oxygen to live.  Without enough oxygen, parts of the body - like the [[brain]] - will start to die.  Finally, a person's [[cardiac arrest|heart can stop]] if they do not get enough oxygen for a long enough time. 
 
 Albuterol can often keep these things from happening.  Often, people with diseases like asthma or COPD are [[prescription|prescribed]] albuterol [[inhaler]]s. < ref name= " NHS "  / >     As soon as they start having trouble breathing, they can use the inhaler to breathe albuterol right into their lungs.  The albuterol will stop the bronchi from getting narrower, and will make them wider again.  This makes it possible for normal amounts of oxygen to get to the lungs. < ref name= " Medline "  / > < ref name= " NHS "  / >
