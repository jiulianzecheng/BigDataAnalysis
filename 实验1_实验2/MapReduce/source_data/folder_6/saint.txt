 A '''saint''' is a holy person. < ref name= " Wycliffe " > ''Wycliffe Bible Encyclopedia'',  " saint " , {{ISBN|0-8024-9697-0}},  " Christians in general are 'saints' in NT usage, and the term is common in reference to the inclusive membership of a local church . . . Other references in the NT equate Christians in general with 'saints' . . . All these are identified as saints because they are in Christ Jesus. " < /ref >  In many [[religions]], saints are people who are believed to be [[holy]]. 
 
 In [[Christianity]], the word  " saint "  refers to any person who is  " in Christ " , and in whom Christ dwells, whether in [[Heaven]] or in earth. < ref name= " Wycliffe "  / >  [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Catholicism|Catholics]] teach that all Christians in Heaven are saints, but some are worthy of more honor than others. < ref name=bebis > Bebis G ''[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith8044 The Saints of the Orthodox Church] at Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, New York < /ref > < ref name=cat2 > {{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p123a9p5.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - PART 1 SECTION 2 CHAPTER 3 ARTICLE 9 PARAGRAPH 5|website=www.scborromeo.org}} < /ref > 
 
 In the Christian [[Bible]], not only one person is actually called a saint:  " They envied Moses also in the camp, and [[Aaron]] the saint of the LORD. "  ({{bibleref|Psalms|106:16-18|9}}) The [[wikt:apostle|apostle]] [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] called himself  " less than the least of all saints "  in {{bibleref|Ephesians|3:8|9}}. 
 Paul's 2nd letter to the Corinthian Church speaks of ...all the saints in Achaia  
 {{bibleref|2 cor|1:1}}.

 ==General characteristics== 
 Many religions use the  " saint "  idea to honor people, like [[Hindu saint]]s. If a person is considered a saint, no matter what religion they belong to, they are usually: < ref > [[John A.

 == Christianity == 
 === Anglicanism === 
 In the [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[Continuing Anglicanism|Continuing Anglican]] movement, a Saint is a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be followed, and as a 'cloud of witnesses' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey ({{bibleverse||Hebrews|12:1|KJV}}). Official Anglican policy recognizes the existence of the saints in heaven. 
 
 === Eastern Orthodoxy === 
 In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church a saint is defined as anyone who is in [[Heaven]], whether recognized here on earth, or not. < ref name=bebis/ >  This means [[Adam and Eve]], [[Moses]], and the various [[prophet]]s (except for the [[angels]] and [[archangel]]s) are all given the title of  " Saint " . In the Orthodox Church, sainthood refers to closeness to God. 
 
 === Lutheranism === 
 In the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints.  However, the church still recognizes and honors certain saints, including some saints honored by the Catholic Church. 
 
 === Methodism === 
 While [[Methodism|Methodists]] as a whole do not practice the [[patronage]] or [[veneration]] of saints, they do honor and admire them.  Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mostly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and [[martyr]]s of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the [[Twelve Apostles]], [[John Wesley]], etc. 
 
 === Mormons (Latter-day Saints) === 
 The beliefs within [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) with regard to saints are close to the beliefs of the Protestant faith. In the [[New Testament]] the saints are all those who have been [[baptism|baptized]].  " Latter-day "  refers to the doctrine that members are living in the  " latter days " , before the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. < ref > {{Cite web |last= Smith |first= Joseph Jr |authorlink= Joseph Smith, Jr. |title= Pearl Of Great Price |url= http://lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html |access-date= 2012-04-03 |archive-date= 2018-12-25 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181225140950/https://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,106-1-2-1,FF.html |url-status= dead }} < /ref >   Therefore members are often referred to as  " [[Latter-day Saints]] "  or  " LDS " , and among themselves as  " Saints " . < ref > M.

 === Oriental Orthodox === 
 The [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], [[Meqabyan|Ethiopian Orthodox]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Eritrean Orthodox]], [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] do accept the existence of saints, but officially recognize them in their own ways.  For example, the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] canonizes saints, through the approval of that church's Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a saint's death to his canonization, and the Coptic Orthodox Pope must follow that rule. 
 
 === Other Christian groups === 
 There are some groups who do not accept the idea of the [[Communion of Saints]]. Some believe all of the departed are in [[soul sleep]] until the final [[resurrection]] on [[Judgment Day]]. Others believe that the departed go to either [[Paradise]] or [[Tartarus]], to await the day in which the living and the dead are judged. Certain groups do not believe that the departed have any connection with the living. 
 
 === Protestantism === 
 In many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, the word  " saint "  is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a [[Christian]]. This is similar to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. < ref > [http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1 & locale=0 & sourceId=bcfb12ca67c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ & vgnextoid=32c41b08f338c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD  " Beloved of God, Called to Be Saints " ], ''New Testament Gospel Doctrine Teacher's Manual''. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah. p. 150. lds.org. Retrieved on November 21, 2009. < /ref >  In this way, anyone who is within the [[Body of Christ]] (any Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider [[Intercession of saints|prayers to the saints]] to be [[idolatry]] because they believe prayers should be given only to God himself. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p38.htm|title=The Sin of Idolatry and the Catholic Concept of Iconic Participation|website=www.philvaz.com|access-date=2012-04-03|archive-date=2012-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413190535/http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p38.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 The Catholic Church teaches that it does not make anyone into a saint. Instead, it recognizes a saint. < ref > [http://www.kofc.org/un/catechism/getsection.action?part=1 & sec=2 & chap=3 & art=9 & parasec=3 & subsec=2 & hdr=0 & par=828 & paratype=a The Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812112425/http://www.kofc.org/un/catechism/getsection.action?part=1 & sec=2 & chap=3 & art=9 & parasec=3 & subsec=2 & hdr=0 & par=828 & paratype=a |date=2011-08-12 }} From the Knights of Columbus website < /ref >  In the [[Catholic Church|Church]], the title of Saint refers to a person who has been [[canonization|canonized]] (officially recognized) by the Catholic Church, and is therefore believed to be in [[Heaven]]. 
 
 Because the Church believes all people in Heaven are saints, there are many people believed to be in [[Heaven]] who have not been officially declared as saints. < ref > [http://www.catholic-pages.com/saints/explained.asp What is a saint?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919194942/http://www.catholic-pages.com/saints/explained.asp |date=2012-09-19 }} Vatican Information Service, 29 July 1997 < /ref >  Sometimes the word  " saint "  is used to refer to Christians still living here on earth. < ref name=cat2/ > 
 
 The [[veneration]] of saints, in [[Latin]], ''cultus'', or the  " cult of the saints " , describes devotion to a particular saint or saints.  Sometimes this is called  " [[worship]] " , but only in the old-sense meaning  " to honor or give respect " . According to the Catholic Church, Divine Worship is properly reserved only for God and never to the saints. < ref > Scully, Teresita '' [http://www.americancatholic.org/features/customs/rosary/mary_worship.asp Do Catholics Worship Mary?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401155859/http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Customs/rosary/mary_worship.asp |date=2012-04-01 }}'' on American Catholic.org < /ref >  Saints can be asked for help, < ref > [http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp The Intercession of the Saints] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619002648/http://www.catholic.com/library/Intercession_of_the_Saints.asp |date=2009-06-19 }} on Catholic.com < /ref >  just as one can ask someone on earth to pray for them. 
 
 A saint may be a [[patron saint]] of a cause or profession, or invoked against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official statements of the [[Magisterium]]. < ref > [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Patron Saints|Patron Saints]] from Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) on Wikisource.org < /ref >  Saints are not thought to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. 
 
 ====Becoming a Saint==== 
 A person who is seen as very holy can be declared a saint by a formal process, called [[canonization]].  Formal canonization is a lengthy process often taking many years, even centuries. < ref > [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/index_saints_en.html Table of the Canonizations during the Pontificate of His Holiness John Paul II] on Vatican.va < /ref >  The first step in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life, undertaken by an expert. After this, the report on the candidate is given to the bishop of the area and more studying is done. It is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. < ref name=how6191 / > 
 
 If the application is approved, the person may be granted the title of  " Venerable " . < ref name=how6191 > {{cite web|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/question619.htm|title=How does someone become a saint?|date=20 April 2001|website=HowStuffWorks}} < /ref >  Further investigations may lead to the candidate's [[beatification]] and given title of  " Blessed " . < ref name=how6191 / >  At least two important miracles are required to be formally declared a saint.  These miracles must have happened after the candidate died. < ref name=how6191 / >  Finally, when all of this is done the [[Pope]] canonizes the saint. < ref name=how6191 / > 
 
 Once a person has been declared a saint, the body of the saint is considered holy. < ref name=newadv > [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12734a.htm Relics] Catholic Encyclopedia on NewAdvent.org < /ref >  The remains of saints are called holy [[relics]] and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. < ref name=newadv / >  Some of the saints have a [[saint symbology|symbol]] that represents their life. 
 
 == Other religions == 
 The word  " saint "  is not only used by Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized as having reached the highest goals of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many [[world religions]]. 
 
 === African Diaspora === 
 Cuban [[Santería]], [[Haitian Vodou]], Brazilian [[Umbanda]] and [[Candomblé]], and other similar [[syncretism|syncretist]] religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them.  They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the [[deity|deities]].  The name ''santería'' was originally a negative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms. 
 
 === Buddhism === 
 {{Main|Buddha|Bodhisattva}} 
 Buddhists hold the [[Arhat]]s{{fact|date=November 2012}} and [[Arahant]]s {{fact|date=November 2012}} in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.{{fact|date=November 2012}} 
 
 === Discordianism === 
 {{Main|Discordianism}} 
 In Discordianism, anyone, living or dead, or even anything can be named a saint. Anyone may canonize anything or anyone else as everyone, whether they are aware of it or not, is a [[pope]] in the [[POEE]]. This is because  " moral perfection isn't necessary for Discordian Sainthood. You just have to suffer a lot. " 
 
 === Hinduism === 
 There are people who have been described as being Hindu saints, most of whom have also been more specifically identified by the terms [[Sant]], [[Mahatma]], [[Paramahamsa]], or [[Swami]], or with the titles ''[[Sri]]'' or ''Srila''. 
 
 === Islam === 
 The Arabic word ''wali'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is usually translated into English as  " Saint " . However, the ''wali'' should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. An important early scholar of Sunni Islamic beliefs, [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi]], mentioned in his book  " Al-Aqidah At-Tahawiya " : 
 
 ''We do not prefer any of the '''saintly men''' among the Ummah over any of the Prophets but rather we say that any one of the Prophets is better than all the awliya' put together. We believe in what we know of Karamat, the marvels of the awliya' and in authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://masud.co.uk/ISLAM/misc/tahawi.htm|title=Aqidah Tahawiyya|website=masud.co.uk}} < /ref > 
 
 Unlike Prophets and Messengers, the ''awliya'' can be either male and female. One of the best known female saints is [[Rabia Basri|Rabi`a al-Adawiyya]]. 
 
 It is widely regarded{{fact|date=April 2018}} in [[Islam]] that the saints of saints is [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] the cousin of Muhammad all Sufi orders originate through his teachings. In addition all saints regard him as their champion 'The Saints of Saints' 
 
 In [[Sufism]], the major ''wali'' are considered to have been masters in the art of spiritual purification.  Some groups within [[Islam]] hold the [[Hadrat]] (literally, Presence, a title of [[Sufi]] saints) in esteem. 
 
 === Judaism === 
 The word ''Tzadik''  " righteous " , and its associated meanings, developed in [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic thought]] from its Talmudic contrast with ''[[Hasidim|Hasid]]'' ( " Pious "  honorific), to its exploration in [[Musar literature|Ethical literature]], and its spiritualisation in [[Kabbalah]]. In [[Hasidic Judaism]], the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance. 
 
 === Sikhism === 
 The concept of [[Sant Mat|sant]] or [[bhagat]] is found in North Indian religious thought including [[Sikhism]]. Figures such as [[Kabir]], [[Guru Ravidass|Ravidas]], [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]], and others are widely regarded as belonging to the Sant tradition. Some of their mystical compositions are incorporated in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. The term  " Sant "  is still sometimes loosely applied to living individuals in the Sikh and related communities.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
