 The '''markhor''' (''Capra falconeri'') is a large goat. It is found in [[woodland]] in [[Central Asia]], [[Karakoram]] and the Western [[Himalayas]], this is the '''National Animal of Pakistan'''.  
 
 Markhor are 65 to 115 centimetres tall at the shoulder.  They usually weigh from 40 to 110 kilograms. Females are a tan colour with a white underbelly and a pattern of black and white on the legs. Males are a lighter tan colour with the same white underbelly and pattern on the legs.  Males also have a black face and lots of long white fur on their neck and chest which can grow down to their knees. Both males and females have [[corkscrew]]-shaped [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] which can grow up to 160 & nbsp;cm / 64 & nbsp;inches long in males, and up to 25 & nbsp;cm / 10 & nbsp;inches in females. 
 
 Markhor live in places 500 to 3500 metres (1,500 to 11,000 feet) high, where they eat grass, leaves. < ref name=NatGeo > {{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/photo-ark/animal/capra-falconeri/|title=Endangered Bukharan Markhor|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=July 28, 2021}} < /ref >   Markhor often stand on their back legs to reach the top leaves of trees. Markhor are active (move around more) in the early morning and late afternoon. Females gather in [[herd]]s (groups) of up to nine animals.  Males usually live alone. 
 
 The markhor is the National animal of Pakistan. The word  " Markhor "  is Persian for  " Snake Eater " .  They live in [[Pakistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and Indian Kashmir Valley. In Pakistan, they live in the Chitral, Ghizar and Hunza regions.  There are fewer markhor left because human beings take [[livestock]] to eat grass in the [[habitat|places where the markhor lives]].  Other people have killed the markhor for its horns.  As of 2012, the [[IUCN]] said there were probably 2,500 markhor left in the wild. < ref name=SciAm > {{cite web|publisher=Scientific American Blogs|accessdate=July 27, 2012|date=May 16, 2021|title=Sanctuaries Established to Help Save Spectacular Kashmiri Goat|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/sanctuaries-save-spectacular-kashmiri-goat/|author= John R.
