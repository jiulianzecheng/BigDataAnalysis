 A '''xenolith''' (foreign rock) is a [[rock (geology)|rock]] fragment which another rock surrounds. 
 
 It happens most in [[igneous rock]] when [[magma]] is fluid enough to flow round more solid rock. Xenoliths may be covered in the margins of a [[magma]] chamber, torn loose from the walls of a flow of [[lava]]  or picked up along the ground by flowing lava on Earth's surface. A '''xenocryst''' is an individual foreign [[crystal]] included within an [[igneous]] body. Examples of xenocrysts are [[quartz]] crystals in a low-[[silica]] lava and [[diamond]]s in [[kimberlite]] [[diatreme]]s. < ref > Blatt, Harvey, and Robert J. Tracy 1996. ''Petrology''. 2nd ed, W.H.

 Although the term xenolith is most commonly associated with igneous inclusions, a broad definition could include rock fragments which have become encased in [[sedimentary rock]]. Xenoliths are sometimes found in [[meteorites]]. 
 
 Xenoliths and xenocrysts provide important information about the composition of the otherwise inaccessible [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. [[Basalt]]s, kimberlites, [[lamproite]]s and [[lamprophyre]]s, which have their source in the upper mantle, often contain fragments and crystals assumed to be a part of the lower mantle [[mineralogy]].
