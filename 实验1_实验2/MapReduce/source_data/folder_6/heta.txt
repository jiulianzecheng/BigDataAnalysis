 '''Heta''' (uppercase/lowercase '''{{lang|grc|Ⱶ ⱶ|}}''') is another name for the letter [[Eta (letter)|Eta]] (Η), a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], and also for some other variant forms of it. This name is used to show that this letter at first was pronounced as  " h " , just like in Latin. Later, in the Ionian dialect of Greek, people stopped pronouncing the sound  " h " , and therefore they gave the letter a new meaning and used it for a long  " e "  sound instead. Some other dialects then took over this new letter  " Eta " , and so they had to find a new form for the letter for  " h " . In some dialects they invented a new letter  " [[File:Greek Eta tack.svg|x16px]] "  to stand for  " h " . Today, the name  " Heta "  is also used for this letter.
