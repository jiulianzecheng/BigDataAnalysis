 '''Kapilavastu''' (''Kapilavatthu'') is the name of the place where [[Gautama Buddha]] grew up, and where his family home was located. It was located in the ancient [[Shakya]] kingdom, which is today part of [[Nepal]]. The exact location of Kapilavastu is not known; it is assumed to be about 10 & nbsp;kilometers to the west of [[Lumbini]], where Buddha was born. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666|title=Lumbini, the Birthplace of the Lord Buddha|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 March 2011}} < /ref >
