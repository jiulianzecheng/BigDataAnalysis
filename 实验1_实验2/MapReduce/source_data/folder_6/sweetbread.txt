 '''Sweetbreads''' or '''ris''' are [[culinary name]]s for the [[thymus]] or the [[pancreas]] glands especially of the [[veal|calf]] (''ris de veau'') and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] (''ris d'agneau'') (although [[beef]] and [[pork]] sweetbreads are also eaten). < ref > [[Oxford Companion to Food]], [[Oxford English Dictionary]] < /ref > 
 
 Various other [[gland]]s used as food have also been called 'sweetbreads', including the [[parotid gland]], the [[sublingual gland]]s, and [[testicle]]s (''cf.'' [[Rocky Mountain oyster]]). < ref > W. A. Newman Dorland, ''The american illustrated medical dictionary'', 1922 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Di6AAAAIAAJ & pg=PA1030 full text] < /ref > < ref > ''The Medical Age'', quoting the ''British Medical Journal'', '''11''':702, 1893 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hg8TAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA702 full text] < /ref >  The  " heart "  sweetbreads are more spherical in shape, and surrounded symmetrically by the  " throat "  sweetbreads, which are more cylindrical in shape. 
 
 One common preparation of sweetbreads involves [[brining|soaking in salt water]], then [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]] in [[milk]], after which the outer membrane is removed.  Once dried and chilled, they are often [[breading|breaded]] and [[frying|fried]].  They are also used for stuffing or in [[pâté]]s. They are grilled in many [[Latin American cuisine]]s, such as in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[asado]], and served in bread < !--what does this mean?-- >  in [[Turkish cuisine]]. 
 
 The word  " sweetbread "  is first known in the 16th century, but the logic behind the name is unclear. < ref > [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition, 1989 < /ref >   " [[Sweet (taste)|Sweet]] "  is perhaps used since the thymus is sweet and rich tasting, as opposed to [[Umami|savoury]] tasting [[muscle]] [[flesh]]. < ref > [http://www.takeourword.com/TOW176/page2.html  " Take Our Word For It "  Issue 176, page 2] < /ref >   " Bread "  may come from ''brede'' 'roasted meat'. < ref > [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition, 1989, ''s.v.'' 'brede' < /ref >
