 '''Flavius Galerius Valerius Licinianus Licinius''' (c. [[250]] - 325) was [[Roman Emperor|Roman emperor]] from 308 AD to 324 AD. 
 
 Licinius went with his close friend the Emperor [[Galerius]] on the [[Iran|Persian]] expedition in 297.  After the death of [[Flavius Valerius Severus]], Galerius declared Licinius emperor honorific in the West in 308.  
 
 On the death of Galerius, in May [[311]], Licinius shared the entire empire with [[Maximinus]] Daia. The [[Hellespont]] and the [[Bosporus]] were the dividing line. 
 
 In [[313]] he married Flavia Julia Constantia, half-sister of [[Constantine I|Constantine]], at Mediolanum (now [[Milan]]). Together with Constantine he issued the  " [[Edict of Milan]] "  that allowed [[Christianity]] to be [[wikt:affirm|professed]] in the empire.  
 On [[April 30]],  Licinius won against [[Maximinus]] at the Battle of Tzirallum. So he became master of the East, while his brother-in-law, Constantine, was master in the West. 
 
 In [[314]], a civil war began between Licinius and Constantine. Constantine won at Cibalae in [[Pannonia]] and again 2 years later in [[Thrace]]. Then followed a period during which they worked together. But in [[324]] Constantine attacked him again and Licinius had to give up. Because his wife, Constantine's sister, asked for his survival he was not killed immediately. In [[325]] Constantine accused him of starting a [[conspiracy]] with the [[barbarian]]s and had him killed.
