'''Beriberi''' (also called '''[[Thiamine|vitamin B1]] deficiency''') is a [[disease]] of the [[nervous system]]. It happens when a person does not get enough thiamine (vitamin B1) in their [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]].  
 
 Thiamine helps the body turn food into [[energy]].  People need thiamine for good [[brain]] function and a healthy [[liver]], [[skin]], [[hair]], and [[Eye|eyes]]. It also helps the [[nervous system]] work properly. < ref > {{cite web | url= https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/vitamin-b1-thiamine# | title=Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) | publisher=Mount Sinai Health System | access-date=20 January 2022}} < /ref > 
 
 Without enough thiamine, a personâ€™s body cannot [[Aerobic respiration|create all the energy]] the person needs.  As a result, people with beriberi have severe [[lethargy]] and feel [[Fatigue|exhausted]]. Beriberi can also cause [[Muscle|muscles]] to get weaker. These [[Symptom|symptoms]] can make it hard for a person to do simple things. < ref name= " wosd "  / >   
 
 Some people with beriberi have [[heart]] problems or even die. < ref name= " wosd "  / >  Beriberi can also cause problems with the [[gastrointestinal system]].  
 
 Most people get enough vitamin B1 in their regular diet. However, some groups are more likely to get beriberi. These include people who drink a lot of alcohol < ref name= " wosd "  / >  and people who eat an unhealthy or unbalanced diet, like a diet of mostly [[white rice]].  < ref name= " wosd " > " Beriberi.

 There are two kinds of beriberi: wet and dry. Wet beriberi mainly affects the [[cardiovascular system]]. < ref name= " bb "  / >  Dry beriberi affects the nervous system. < ref name= " bb "  / >  There is also a rare type of [[genetics|genetic]] beriberi. < ref name= " bb "  / >   
 
 Most of the time, dry beriberi and wet beriberi happen at the same time in the same person. When this takes place, the victim is likely to only get the symptoms of one beriberi. < ref > " Beriberi.
