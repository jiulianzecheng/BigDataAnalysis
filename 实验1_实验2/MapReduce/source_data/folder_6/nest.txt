 A '''nest''' is a place where [[animal]]s build to hold their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] or provide a place to raise their babies. They are most typical of [[bird]]s, but many other [[vertebrate]]s do make nests. 
 
 Nests can be made of [[Organic matter|organic materials]] such as [[Twig|twigs]], [[grass]], and [[Leaf|leaves]]. They may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[tree]], or building. Nests can be found in all types of [[habitat]].
