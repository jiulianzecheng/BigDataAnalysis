 '''Galagos''', also known as '''bushbabies''' or '''{{lang|af|nagapies}}''' (meaning  " little night monkeys "  in [[Afrikaans]]), are small, nocturnal [[primate]]s native to continental [[Africa]]. There are 21 [[species]], and they form the family '''Galagidae'''.

 There are many kinds of bush babies. Bush babies are the most successful [[prosimian]] primates in Africa. < ref name= " African Wildlife Foundation " > {{cite web|title=Bushbaby. African Wildlife Foundation.  |url=http://www.awf.org/content/wildlife/detail/980/|accessdate=2012-07-26}} < /ref > 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Galagos are all [[arboreal]] and are able to jump far between branches. They also flock to savahhn areas of Africa. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Galagos are omnivorous but mainly [[insectivorous|eat insects]]. Their favorite food is [[grasshopper]]s, but they also eat small birds, eggs, fruits, seeds and [[flower]]s. Euoticus has specialized front teeth for removing tree bark so it can eat tree gum.
