 '''Neocolonialism''' is a system where [[Empire|empires]] pretend to let their [[Colony|colonies]] be free, but they continue to run them secretly. The term  " neo "  means  " new " , so it means that the system is a new version of [[colonialism]]. The word neocolonialism was carefully explained by [[socialists]] in the 1960s, who were afraid their countries wouldn't really be [[Independence|independent]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmqoMQEACAAJ|title=Divided World Divided Class: Global Political Economy and the Stratification of Labour Under Capitalism|last=Cope|first=Zak|date=2012|publisher=Kersplebedeb|isbn=978-1-894946-41-4|location=|pages=117â€“118|language=en}} < /ref >  The socialists mostly talked about the old empires controlling the politics and economy of their countries, but some people also talk about neocolonialism as a way to control [[culture]] too. 
 
 [[Kwame Nkrumah]], the first president of [[Ghana]] after it became independent from the [[British Empire]], wrote a well-known book about neocolonialism. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of imperialism by Kwame Nkrumah|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/neo-colonialism/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.marxists.org}} < /ref >  Many people have heard of the idea because of his book. [[Che Guevara]] is another famous opponent of neocolonialism. 
 
 Most people who use the word neocolonialism and believe it describes the world today are socialists, [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]], and other types of [[Left-wing|leftists]]. [[Liberalism|Liberals]] and [[right-wing]] people tend to disagree with the idea of neocolonialism.
