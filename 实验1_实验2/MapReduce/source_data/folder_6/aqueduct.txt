 An '''aqueduct''' is a man-made channel that carries [[water]] from one place to another. Usually, they are used to supply water to cities and towns. They may also carry water for [[irrigation]], or for [[hydroelectricity]]. Pipes, canals, tunnels, and bridges that serve this purpose are all called aqueducts. Some aqueducts carry a [[canal]] for [[boat]]s and [[ship]]s. The word “aqueduct” comes from the [[Latin]] words “aqua” (water) and “ducere” (to lead). Aqueducts have been used since ancient times. < ref > " aqueduct " , Britannica CD 2000 < /ref >
