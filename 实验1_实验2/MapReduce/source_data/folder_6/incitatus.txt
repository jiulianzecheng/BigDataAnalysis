 '''Incitatus''' was Emperor [[Caligula]]'s favorite [[horse]].  He lived in [[Ancient Rome]] around 40 [[Common Era|CE]].  His name means  " fast-moving "  in [[Latin language|Latin]]. 
 
 There is a story that Caligula made his horse a [[Roman Senate|senator]], but it is probably not true.  According to historian Mary Beard, no ancient historian who was alive at the same time as Caligula ever said Caligula really made Incitatus a senator, and it is likely that he only told a joke about doing it. < ref name= " Guardian " > {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/caligula-with-mary-beard-review|access-date=June 30, 2020|date=June 30, 2013|title=Caligula with Mary Beard – TV review|author=Tom Meltzner}} < /ref > 
 
 Ancient historians do say Caligula gave his horse many gifts.  In 121 c.e., < ref name= " Tufts " > {{cite web|publisher=Tufts University|access-date=June 29, 2020|title=C. Suetonius Tranquillus, The Lives of the Caesars|editor=Alexander Thomson|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0132}} < /ref >  in his book ''The Twelve Caesars'', the historian [[Suetonius]] says of Incitatus:  " Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, he even gave this horse a house, a troop of slaves and furniture, for the more elegant entertainment of the guests invited in his name; and it is also said that he planned to make him consul.

 ==In fiction== 
 
 In Robert Graves' 1934 book ''I, Claudius'', the fictional Caligula does make the fictional Incitatus a senator and gives him an ivory trough to eat out of. < ref name= " Graves " > {{cite book|title=I, Claudius|url=https://archive.org/details/iclaudius0000robe_x7w8|author=Robert Graves|year=1934|publisher=Random House|edition=Vintage International 1989|isbn=0-679-72477-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/iclaudius0000robe_x7w8/page/408 408]}} < /ref >   This is one of the ways Graves shows that Caligula has become mentally unstable.  After Caligula dies, Claudius treats Incitatus like a normal horse again. < ref name= " Graves2 " > {{cite book|title=Claudius the God|author=Robert Graves|year=1935|publisher=Random House|edition=Vintage International 1989|isbn=0-679-72573-3|page=101}} < /ref > 
 
 A talking version of Incitatus appears as a villain in [[Rick Riordan]]'s 2018 young adult novel ''The Burning Maze''.
