 To '''sponsor''' something is to support an event, activity, person, or organization. The support can be with money or giving something else useful, such as [[advertising]], or time. A sponsor is the individual or group that gives the support, similar to a [[benefactor]]. A sponsor may also be a personal sponsor, a [[political]] sponsor or a [[state]] sponsor. There are many different kinds of sponsors. 
 
 == Commercial sponsor == 
 A sponsor is one (usually a company) who gives [[cash]], [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] in return for [[Promotion|promoting]] the sponsor's company. < ref > Deborah Philips; Garry Whannel, ''The Trojan Horse: The Growth of Commercial Sponsorship'' (New York, NY: Bloomsbury Academic, 2013), p. 12 < /ref >  There is a distinct [[wikt:difference|difference]] between sponsorship and [[philanthropy]]. < ref name=Larson98 > James F. Larson; Heung-Soo Park, ''Global Television and the Politics of the Seoul Olympics'' (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1993), p. 98 < /ref >  A sponsor expects a [[return on  investment]] (ROI), usually in the form of advertising. A philanthropist [[Donation|donates]] something as a [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] contribution. In sports, sponsors compete to advertise in the most popular [[sport]]s. In [[India]], sponsors all want to be associated with [[Cricket]]. It is much harder to find sponsors for other sports. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/media/sponsors-search-beyond-indian-cricket |title=Sponsors search beyond Indian cricket |author=Rebecca Bundhun |date=26 July 2014 |website= |publisher=The National/Abu Dhabi Media |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >

 == Legislative sponsor == 
 A sponsor or [[wikt:patron|patron]], usually a [[legislator]], is someone who presents a [[law|bill]] or [[wikt:resolution|resolution]] for consideration. Others who join the sponsor are known as cosponsors or copatrons. In the [[United States Congress]] a sponsor is the first person listed among the [[Legislator|lawmakers]] who introduce a bill to either the [[United States Senate|Senate]] or the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The process is very similar to sponsoring a bill in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/legislative-process-taking-a-bill-through-parliament |title=Legislative process: taking a Bill through Parliament |author= |website= |publisher=UK.gov |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 == Personal sponsor == 
 This is someone who agrees to help another [[person]] or persons, and be responsible for them. For example, an [[employer]] may sponsor a [[foreign national]] to become a [[Permanent residency|permanent resident]] of the [[United States]] by [[wikt:guarantee|guarantee]]ing that person a [[job]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/E2en.pdf |title=I am an employer, How do I sponsor an employee for U.S. permanent resident status? |author= |website= |publisher=U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >  Sponsorship can also mean an individual who helps an organization. Many [[charitable organization]]s offer personal sponsorship of a [[boy]] or [[girl]] to help them. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.worldvision.org.uk/child-sponsorship/sponsor-girl/ |title=Sponsor a Girl Today and Change a Life of a Child for Good |author= |website= |publisher=World Vision UK |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >  Many [[Public broadcasting|public radio]] and [[Public broadcasting|television stations]] ask for sponsors to provide [[money|funds]] for them to operate. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/support/business/sponsor.shtml |title=Become a Sponsor |author= |website= |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >  At a [[Ceremonial ship launching]] the person breaking the [[champagne]] bottle over the ship's bow is called the sponsor of that ship. In many religions, [[godparent]]s are the [[baptized]] child's sponsors. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://stannsw.org/baptism-sponsor-also-known-as-godparent/ |title=Baptism Sponsor (also known as Godparent) |author= |website= |publisher=Saint Ann's Episcopal Church, Woodstock, IL |accessdate=7 May 2015 |archive-date=16 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516052802/http://stannsw.org/baptism-sponsor-also-known-as-godparent/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == State sponsorship == 
 Sponsorship is not always for the purposes of doing good. A state (or [[government]]) may sponsor [[terrorism]] for their own purposes. While not engaging in activities against another country (or countries) themselves, they may sponsor other groups to do it for them. The [[United States]] currently lists four countries who sponsor terrorism. They are: [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Sudan]], and [[Syria]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm |title=State Sponsors of Terrorism |author= |website= |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >  State sponsors may also be called [[wikt:affiliate|affiliate]]s and/or [[wikt:supporter|supporter]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-the-uk-against-terrorism |title=Policy, Counter-terrorism |author= |website= |publisher=Gov.UK |accessdate=7 May 2015}} < /ref >
