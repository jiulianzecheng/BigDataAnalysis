 [[File:Incubus.jpg|thumb|right|An incubus]] 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], people in [[Europe]] believed that '''Incubi''' (one '''Incubus''', several '''Incubi''') were [[male]] [[demon]]s. There were also [[female]] demons, called [[succubus|succubi]]. They lay on sleeping people, to have [[sexual intercourse]] with them. They would also do this to make other incubi. While they had sex with their victim, they drained its energy to sustain themselves. Sometimes, having sex with an incubus may result in a child, as in the legend of [[Merlin]]. < ref > Merlin's father was said to be an incubus in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' and many later tales.

 == Origins of the legends == 
 People have come up with different explanations for the incubus legends. In the [[Middle Ages]], people worried a lot about [[sin]], especially sexual sins of women. Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or [[sleep paralysis]]. Also, nocturnal arousal, [[orgasm]] or [[nocturnal emission]] could be explained by the idea of creatures causing an otherwise guilt-producing and self-conscious behavior. < ref name= " AZ " > {{cite book| last1 = Lewis| first1 = James R.| last2 = Oliver| first2 = Evelyn Dorothy| last3 = Sisung| first3 = Kelle S.| title = Angels, A to Z| year = 1996| publisher = Visible Ink Press| isbn = 978-0-7876-0652-7| page = 218 }} < /ref >  The influence of incubi could also have been used to explain how [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] happen outside [[marriage]]; such pregnancies were often  " unexplainable " .and unnoticed  
 
 Victims who claimed to have fallen prey to the influence of incubi, could in reality have been victims of [[sexual assault]] by a real person. Rapists may have attributed the [[rape]]s of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. A friend or relative may have assaulted the victim in her sleep. The victims and, in some cases the [[clergy]], < ref name= " Masello " > {{cite book| last = Masello| first = Robert| title = Fallen Angels: And Spirits of the Dark| year = 1994| publisher = Perigee Trade| isbn = 978-0-399-51889-8| page = 66 }} < /ref >  may have found it easier to explain the attack as [[supernatural]] in origin rather than confront the idea that the attack came from a trusted person. 
 
 === Ancient and religious descriptions === 
 One of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian kings' list, ca. 2400, where the hero [[Gilgamesh]]'s father is listed as Lilu (Lila). < ref name= " Patai 1990 221 " > {{cite book| last = Patai| first = Raphael| title = The Hebrew Goddess| url = https://archive.org/details/hebrewgoddessrde00pata| year = 1990| publisher = Wayne State University Press| isbn = 978-0-8143-2271-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/hebrewgoddessrde00pata/page/n252 221] }} < /ref >  It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while [[Lilitu]], a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams. < ref > {{cite book| last = Hurwitz| first = Siegmund| title = Lilith, the First Eve: Historical and Psychological Aspects of the Dark Feminine| url = https://archive.org/details/lilithfirstevehi0000hurw| year = 1992| publisher = Daimon| isbn = 978-3-85630-522-2 }} < /ref >  Two other demons appear as well: Ardat lili visits men by night and bears ghostly children from them. Irdu lili, is the male counterpart to Ardat lili. He visits women by night. These demons were originally storm demons. Because the [[etymology]] was interpreted wrongly, they were later seen as night demons. < ref name= " Patai 1990 221 " / >  Also considered to be vampires which is another form of a demon that is said to drink blood from its victims. 
 
 Incubi and succubi were said by some not to be different sexes, but the same demon able to change its sex. < ref > Carus, Paul (1900), ''The History of The Devil and The Idea of Evil From The Earliest Times to The Present Day'', [http://www.sacred-texts.com/evil/hod/hod15.htm  " The Devil's Prime, " ] at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com] < /ref >  A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his [[sperm]], and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Their offspring were thought to be supernatural in many cases, even if the actual [[genetics|genetic]] material originally came from humans. < ref name= " AZ " / > 
 
 Many tales claim that the incubus is [[bisexual]], < ref name= " wima " > {{cite book| last = Russell| first = Jeffrey Burton| title = Witchcraft in the Middle Ages| url = https://archive.org/details/witchcraftinmidd0000russ_c5b1| year = 1972| publisher = Ithaca, N.Y : Cornell University Press| isbn = 978-0-8014-0697-3| page = [https://archive.org/details/witchcraftinmidd0000russ_c5b1/page/145 145] }} < /ref >  but some indicate that it is strictly [[heterosexual]] and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental. < ref > {{cite book| last = Stephens| first = Walter| title = Demon Lovers: Witchcraft, Sex, and the Crisis of Belief| year = 2003| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-77262-2| page = 54 }} < /ref >  There are also many stories involving the attempted [[exorcism]] of incubi or succubi who have taken refuge in the bodies of men or women. 
 
 Incubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a [[cambion]]. The most famous legend of such a case includes that of [[Merlin]], the famous wizard from [[Arthurian legend]]. < ref name= " Masello " / > 
 
 According to the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', [[exorcism]] is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of Incubi, the others being [[Sacrament]]al [[Confession]], the [[Sign of the Cross]] (or recital of the [[Hail Mary|Angelic Salutation]]), moving the afflicted to another location, and by [[excommunication]] of the attacking entity,  " which is perhaps the same as exorcism. "   < ref > Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator - 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum'', Part2, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/mm02b01a.htm Chapter 1],  " The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and Succubus Devils, "  at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com] < /ref >  On the other hand, the [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[Ludovico Maria Sinistrari]] stated that incubi  " do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed.
