[[File:Histogram example.svg|thumbnail|right|Example of a histogram of 100 [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random]] values]]A '''histogram''' is a [[concept]] from [[statistics]]. It is a [[graph|graphical display]] that tells us about the [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of the samples involved. They are commonly a picture made from a [[Table (information)|table]] with many categories. The table tells how many samples there are in each category. 
 The word ''histogram'' is derived from ''histos'' and ''gramma'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. ''Histos'' means ''web'' or ''mast''. ''Gramma'' means ''drawing'', ''record'' or ''writing''. A histogram of something is therefore, [[etymology|etymologically]] speaking, a drawing of the web of this something.  
 
 A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is a type of bar chart that shows the frequency or number of observations within different numerical ranges, called bins. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of the data, showing the number of observations that fall within each bin. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Histogram maker|url=https://histogrammaker.co/}} < /ref >
