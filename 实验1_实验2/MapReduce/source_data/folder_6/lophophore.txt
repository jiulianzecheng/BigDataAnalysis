 The '''lophophore''' is the characteristic feeding organ of four major groups of animals: the [[Brachiopoda]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Entoprocta]], and [[Phoronida]]. < ref name=ucmp > [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/phyla/lophotrochozoa.html Introduction to the Lophotrochozoa] - accessed 03 May 2010 < /ref >  All lophophores are found in aquatic organisms. 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 It can most easily be described as a ring of [[cilia]]ted tentacles surrounding the mouth. It is often horseshoe-shaped or coiled. [[Phoronid]]s have their lophophores in plain view, but the valves of [[brachiopod]]s must be opened wide to get a good view of their lophophore. 
 
 The lophophore surrounds the mouth and is an upstream collecting system for suspension feeding. The gut is U-shaped with the anterior mouth at the center of the lophophore. The [[anus]], where present, is also anterior, and is above the mouth. In the Bryozoa it is outside the ring of the lophophore; in the Entoprocta the anus is within the ring of the lophophore. Some brachiopods do not have an anus.
