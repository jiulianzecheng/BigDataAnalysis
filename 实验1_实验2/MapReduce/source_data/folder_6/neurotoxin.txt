A '''neurotoxin''' is a [[toxin]] that acts specifically on nerve cells – [[neuron]]s – usually by interacting with [[membrane protein]]s and [[ion channel]]s.  
 
 Many of the [[Venom (poison)|venoms]] and other toxins that organisms use in defense against [[vertebrate]]s are neurotoxins. A common effect is [[paralysis]], which sets in extremely rapidly. The venom of [[bee]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[spider]]s and [[snake]]s can contain many different toxins. Many neurotoxins act by affecting voltage-dependent ion channels. 
 
 
 A man named [[Clairvius Narcisse]] was dead and came back to life again because the locals used neurotoxin on him to bring him back to life{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. He was buried in Haiti in 1964.
