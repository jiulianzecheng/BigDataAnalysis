 '''Tektites''' (from Greek {{lang|grc|τηκτός}} {{transl|grc|tēktós}},  " molten " ) are [[gravel]]-sized bodies of natural [[glass]]. They come in green or brown (usually). They are formed from terrestrial debris ejected during [[meteorite]] impacts. The term was coined by Austrian geologist [[Franz Eduard Suess]] (1867–1941). They generally range in size from millimeters to centimeters. Millimeter-scale tektites are known as '''microtektites'''. < ref name= " French1998a " > French B.M. 1998.

 Tektites are characterized by: 
 # a fairly homogeneous composition 
 # an extremely low content of water and other [[volatiles]] 
 # an abundance of [[lechatelierite]] (silica glass, amorphous SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) 
 # a general lack of microscopic crystals known as [[microlite]]s and chemical relation to the local [[bedrock]] or local [[sediment]]s 
 # their distribution in widespread [[strewn field]]s
