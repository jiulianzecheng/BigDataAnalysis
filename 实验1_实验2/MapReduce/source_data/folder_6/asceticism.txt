 '''Asceticism''' (Greek: ''askÄ“sis'') is a word that describes a certain way of living. In this kind of life, a person gets rid of worldly pleasures for [[religion]] or [[spirituality]]. A person might not have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] or drink [[alcohol]]. One might spend much of their time in [[prayer]] or [[meditation]]. Often, the reason is to follow goals of [[Christianity]] and the [[Indian religions]] (including [[yoga]]). These teach that [[salvation]] and freedom involve a process of changing one's mind and body. This is done by limiting speech, what one thinks and does with the body.  
 
 The earliest people who [[practice]]d [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and the Christian hermits, lived very simply and without luxury. They rejected sensual pleasures and keeping money. This did not mean that life could not be enjoyed. But spiritual and religious goals are [[:wikt:hinder|hindered]] by such [[:wikt:indulgence|indulgence]].
