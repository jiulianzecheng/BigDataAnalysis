An '''eon''' (or '''aeon''') is a term in [[Earth science]] for the longest periods of time. It describes a part of the [[Earth]]'s [[existence]] lasting hundreds of [[million]]s to [[1,000,000,000|billions]] of [[year]]s. 
 
 A [[geology|geologic]] eon is part of Earth's existence, made up of a number of [[era]]s of different lengths. A geologic [[era]] is made up of two or more shorter times called geologic [[Period (geology)|periods]]. A geologic period is, in turn made up of yet shorter times called [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]s. < ref > Levin, Harold. 2006. ''The Earth though time''. 8th ed, Wiley N.Y. < /ref >   
 
 [[Geologist]]s have given names to all of the eons, eras, periods and epochs that they have found by looking at [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. The names given to each eon describe something about that time, or the rocks that were made at that time. 
 
 For example, we are now in the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, which comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for ''life that we can see'', that is, there were animals and plants big enough to see without a lens. This era started about 545 million years ago.
