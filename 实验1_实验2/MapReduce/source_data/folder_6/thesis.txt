 == History == 
 Originally, the words  " dissertation "  and  " thesis "  had separate meanings.  When, at ancient universities, the professor had completed his lecture, there would be a disputation. During this, students could take up certain points and argue them.  The position that one took during a disputation was the ''thesis'', while the ''dissertation'' was the line of reasoning with which one supported it. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The word  " thesis "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|θέσις}}, meaning  " position " , and refers to an [[intellectual]] [[proposition]].  " Dissertation "  comes from the [[Latin]] ''dissertātiō'', meaning  " discourse " .
