 '''Zygomycota''', or '''zygote fungi''', is a large [[phylum|group]] of 1600 [[species]] of [[fungi]].  
 
 Fungi are put into groups by the way they [[sexual reproduction|reproduce]]. The name ''Zygomycota'' comes from zygosporangia, where strong and tough round shaped [[spore]]s are formed during sexual reproduction. < ref name=clinton/ >   
 
 They are mostly found living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Some are [[parasite]]s of plants, [[insect]]s, and small animals. Others form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with plants, where the plant and the fungi need each other to grow.  
 
 Zygomycete [[hyphae]] may be a [[syncytium]], that is, having a mass of nuclei not divided into separate cells. < ref name=clinton > {{cite web |url=http://faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu/faculty/michael.gregory/files/bio%20102/bio%20102%20lectures/fungi/fungi.htm |title=Fungi |work=faculty.clintoncc.suny.edu |year=2011 |accessdate=7 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  On occasion these can be divided into separate parts by a cell wall called a septum. < ref name=clinton/ >  This only happens where [[gamete]]s are formed, or to wall off dead hyphae.
