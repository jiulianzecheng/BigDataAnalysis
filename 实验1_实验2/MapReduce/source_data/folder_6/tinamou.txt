 A '''tinamou''' is one of an [[Family (biology)|family]] of birds called the '''Tinamidae'''. They are the only [[species]] within the family. There are 47 species of tinamou in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. They are one of the most ancient living groups of [[bird]], and are related to the [[ratite]]s. Generally ground dwelling, they are found in a range of [[habitat]]s. 
 
 == Taxonomy and evolution == 
 Of [[Gondwana]]n origin, tinamous are related to the [[ratite]]s. Although the [[fossil]] record in [[South America]] is poor, the known tinamiform fossil record goes back 10 million years. Together with the ratites, they make up [[Palaeognathae]] ( " old jaws " ), while all other living birds are members of [[Neognathae]] ( " new jaws " ). Unlike the other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled [[sternum]]. Like the other palaeognaths, they also have a distinctive [[palate]] (thin bony plate at top of mouth). < ref name=Davies > Davies S.J.J.F. 2003.

 Recent [[phylogenetic]] studies place tinamids as the sister group of [[Australasia]]n/[[Oceania]]n ratites. Those are the ([[cassowary|cassowaries]], [[emu]]s, and [[kiwi]]). [[South America]]n ratites ([[Rhea (bird)|rheas]]) and [[Africa]]n ratites ([[ostrich]]es) are also related, but more distantly. < ref > {{cite journal|last = Hackett, Shannon J. |display-authors = etal
