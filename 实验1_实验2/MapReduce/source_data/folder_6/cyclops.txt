 A '''Cyclops''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Κύκλωψ, ''Kyklōps''; plural Κύκλωπες, ''Kyklōpes'') is a member of a race of giants in [[Greek mythology]], each with a single eye in the center of his forehead.  
 
 The most famous of these beings is the cyclops [[Polyphemos|Polyphemus]], featured in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.  
 
 ==Hesiod== 
 ===Elder Cyclopes=== 
 In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', the Elder Cyclopes – Brontes (Greek: Βρόντης -  " thunderer " ), Steropes (Greek: Στερόπης -  " lightning " ) and Arges (Greek: Ἄργης -  " bright " ) – were one of three races of beings born to Gaia (Earth) and Ouranos (Sky).   
 
 ==Homer== 
 The Elder Cyclopes are not featured in either of Homer's works. In the [[Odyssey]], Homer describes another race of cyclopes as being the sons of [[Poseidon]], god of the sea. They feature as herdsmen and shepherds with a taste for human flesh. The account is in Book 9 of Homer's Odyssey.
