 [[File:NarranderaSturtMemorial.JPG|thumb|left|[[Charles Sturt]] memorial on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]]] 
 Narrandera is a river town with a long history. Captain [[Charles Sturt]], the famous explorer, was the first European to see the area that later became known as Narrandera. However Sturt, who passed through on 12 December 1829, was not the first explorer to see the Murrumbidgee River. The upper Murrumbidgee, the  " Big Water " , was first discovered in April 1821, by [[Charles Throsby]]. The name ''Narrandera'' probably comes from [[Wiradjuri, New South Wales|Wiradjuri]] word ''nharrang'', meaning  " [[frill-necked lizard]] " . < ref > {{cite book |last1=McNicol |first1=Sally |last2=Hosking |first2=Dianne |year=1994 |chapter=Wiradjuri |title=Macquarie Aboriginal Words |location=Sydney |publisher=Macquarie Library |page=98}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Narrungderra]] were the local [[Indigenous Australian|indigenous people]]. They were all but destroyed by settlement, disease brought by European settlers, and clashes with the settlers. The last major battle between the indigenous people and European settlers took place near Massacre Island, and is said to have left only one survivor. < ref name= " NarranderaShireCouncilHistory " > {{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.narrandera.nsw.gov.au/about/1012/1033.html | title = History of Narrandera | publisher = [[Narrandera Shire|Narrandera Shire Council]] | accessdate = 2007-01-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821142049/http://www.narrandera.nsw.gov.au/about/1012/1033.html  |archivedate = 2006-08-21}} < /ref > < !--when-- > 
 
 Narrandera is first recorded as a pastoral station or  " run "  (Narrandera Run) in 1848. The property was owned by Mr Edward Flood covered about {{convert|76800|acres|ha|0}}. 
 
 The township developed in the early 1860s. Gillinbah Post Office opened nearby on 1 & nbsp;March 1859 and was replaced by the Narrandera office in 1861. A Gillenbah office was open from 1881 to 1892 and from 1906 to 1941. < ref name =  " PostOffice " > {{Citation

 The Borough of Narrandera began on 17 March 1885. The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985. 
 
 ==Narrandera today== 
 The town of Narrandera is at the centre of a productive farming region.  Its attractive tree-lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it. 
 
 The Narrandera Memorial Gardens include the unusual Hankinson [[Fountain]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/monument_display.php?id=22467 & image=0|title=Monument Australia website|accessdate=21 September 2011}} < /ref >  Manufactured by the [[Royal Doulton]] Company of England, the [[ceramic]] fountain is one of only two known in the world, the other in India. It was given to the people of Narrandera by Alderman and Mrs Hankinson in 1922 in honour of locals who served in [[World War I]]. The Hankinson Fountain was smashed by an act of [[vandalism]] in 1971 and was restored by Charles Pearce. 
 
 To the east of Narrandera farmers grow cereal crops, sheep and wool. To the west, is the [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]] (MIA) fed by water from the [[Burrinjuck Dam]]. The MIA is a region where farmer grow rice and other cereals with [[irrigation]], as well as [[citrus]], [[wine]] grapes and [[potato]]es. 
 
 The town also has number of historic attractions, such as a [[fig tree]] on the corner of King and Cadell Streets, which is thought to be 150 years old; and the Mon Repos, a residence built in a Queen Anne-style, which was built in the 1890s. < ref > {{cite web |title = History of Narrandera |url = http://www.narrandera.nsw.gov.au/about/1012/1033.html |publisher  = Narrandera Shire Council |accessdate = 2008-03-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200634/http://www.narrandera.nsw.gov.au/about/1012/1033.html  |archivedate = 2007-09-27}} < /ref > 
 
 Narrandera's Irrigation Canal which carries water to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area flows through the town.  It begins {{convert|34|km|mi}} west at Berembed Weir where water is taken from the Murrumbidgee River.  The canal follows the natural bed of Bundidgerry Creek and in places is very wide and has no [[levee]] banks. Lake Talbot was formed in 1924 when the bank of the Irrigation Canal gave way, flooding the river flat between the canal and Bundidgerry Hill. The shallow lake was allowed to remain and became an important recreational feature of the town. The eastern end of the lake is used by water skiiers. The western end is a [[wetland]] habitat for native fauna. A wetland has been made near Lizard Drive, only {{convert|300|m|ft}} from the Murrumbidgee River.  The Narrandera Wetland is a collection point for storm water run-off from the town.
