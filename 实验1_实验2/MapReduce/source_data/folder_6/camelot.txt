 In the [[legend]]s of [[King Arthur]], '''Camelot''' is Arthur's [[castle]]. In [[fiction]] about the [[Middle Ages]], Arthur rules [[Scotland]] from Camelot and holds [[Meal|feasts]] at his [[round table]]. The round table, which has no legs or head, [[symbol]]ized the idea of a good king because every [[knight]] who sat at it had an equal place. Since Camelot's original place is still uncertain, the truth about it, if it ever existed, is still unknown. Camelot once held many great things such as The Holy Grail, The Holy Sword Excalibur and The Round Table which brought Arthur's best knights together.  
 
 The end of Camelot was caused by Sir Lancelot's and Queen Guinevere's love affair, which forced Camelot to plunge into civil-war.
