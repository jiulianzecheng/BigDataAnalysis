 A '''macron''' ( ¯ ), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|μακρόν}} (''makrón''), meaning  " long " , is a [[diacritic]] mark commonly placed above a single character or symbol (particularly [[vowel|vowels]]). < ref > Greve, Susan M.

 ==Usage== 
 In the [[romanization]] of [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a letter with macron represents a long vowel. < ref > Nakao, Seigo. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWLOFf1MGZQC & dq=macron+Hepburn & pg=PR10  ''Random House Japanese-English English-Japanese Dictionary,'' p. x.] < /ref >

 ** ''kōtsū'' ({{lang|ja|交通}}) means  " traffic "   
 ** ''kotsu'' ({{lang|ja|骨}}) means  " bone "  or  " knack " 
 
 In the written [[Hawaiian language]], the ''kahakō'' is shown by a macron. < ref > United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, Twenty-third Session Vienna, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/ungegn/docs/23-gegn/wp/gegn23wp82.pdf  " Working Paper No. 82,  " US Board on Geographic Names: Collection and Dissemination of Indigenous Names, " ] p. 3; excerpt,  " An example of this has been the addition of the glottal stop (''okina'') and macron (''kahako'') to placenames of Hawaiian origin, which prior to 1995 had always been omitted. The BGN ([[United States Board on Geographic Names|'''B'''oard on '''G'''eographic '''N'''ames]]) staff, under the direction and guidance of the Hawaii State Geographic Names Authority, has been restoring systemically these marks to each Hawaiian name listed in [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=132:1:1387889669750318 GNIS] ([[Geographic Names Information System|'''G'''eographic '''N'''ames '''I'''nformation '''S'''ystem]]) " ; retrieved 2012-6-16. < /ref >
