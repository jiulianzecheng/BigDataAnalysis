 The '''Yokosuka MXY-7 ''Ohka''''' (櫻花  " [[cherry blossom]] " ) was a type of [[airplane]] [[rocket]], used for [[suicide]] attacks by the [[Empire of Japan]] in the last months of [[World War II]]. The [[United States]] gave the aircraft the name ''Baka'' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for  " stupid " ). 
 
 It was carried by a [[bomber]] that dropped it when close enough to an enemy ship. The pilot guided it to crash with the target. When dropping down, it could go so fast that it was almost impossible to stop it. The operational record of Ohkas used in action includes three ships sunk and three other ships with great damage.
