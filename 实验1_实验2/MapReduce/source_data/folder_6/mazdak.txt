 Some people have argued, his teachings show influences from [[Manichaeism]] as well. < ref name=ya56/ >  Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion of Sassanid Persia. Mazdak was a Zoroastrian priest. Most of the Zoroastrian clergy regarded his teaching as a [[heresy]]. 
 
 There is very little information about Mazdakism. The teaching of [[Khurramites|Khurramism]] developed from Mazdakism and can be used to tell certain details about Mazdakism. < ref > Yarshater, Ehsan. The Cambridge history of Iran, volume 2. < /ref >
