An '''award''' is something given to a person or group of people to recognize that they have done something very good. Usual awards are [[medal]], [[trophy]], [[ribbon]], [[certificate]], or [[plaque]] for example. Sometimes awards are called [[prize]]s, such as the [[Nobel Prize]]. 
 
 Awards can be given by any person or institution. [[Government]]s and [[Military|militaries]] often give awards to their citizens for contributions they have made to the nation. This recognition can be given during the person's lifetime or even after they have died. In the United States if a military member receives a [[wikt:posthumous|posthumous]] award it is generally presented to their family members or next of kin. < ref > {{Cite web|access-date=January 1, 2013|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r600_8_22/main.asp|title=Army Regulation 600-8-22:Military awards|date=8 July 2007|publisher=[[United States Army]]|archive-date=20 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220222041/http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r600_8_22/main.asp|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This can include medals like the [[Medal of Honor]]; promotions to the next higher grade or naming a building or ship after them.
