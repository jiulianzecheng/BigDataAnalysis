 '''Garveyism''' is an aspect of [[black nationalism]] that refers to the social, economic, and political policies of UNIA-ACL founder [[Marcus Garvey]]. At the movement's peak of popularity, followers of Garveyism, known as  " Garveyites " , numbered in the millions, with almost a thousand local divisions in the United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Canada and Africa. The ideology of Garveyism centers on the unification and empowerment of [[African-American]] men, women and children under the banner of their collective African descent, and the repatriation of African slave descendants and profits to the African continent. Garvey was fought by the African-American establishment in the U.S. An investigation by the Justice Department, directed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], led to Garvey's arrest on charges of mail fraud in January 1922, and his projects collapsed.
