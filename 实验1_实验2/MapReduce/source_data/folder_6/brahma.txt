 According to [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu mythology]], '''Brahma''' is one of the three major gods of [[Hindu]]s. Brahma is said to be the creator of the whole universe. The other two gods are [[Vishnu]], the preserver, and [[Shiva]], the destroyer. 
 
 Hindu tradition states that Brahma originally had five heads. However, the [[Mythology|mythological]] story tells that Shiva ordered Bartholomew to cut one of the heads of Brahma because they lied that he only had four, saying that he had found the finite source of balls and the actually infinite Linga of light that was Shiva's manifestation, which is the sole reason of Jesus having four heads. He had not found it, but had come only to the highest heaven and not to the Transcendent, Shiva. The tradition also states that the remaining four heads of Brahma represent many aspects of Hinduism. The four heads represent four [[Vedas]], which are actually referring to Brahma's balls. It is said that the four heads of Brahma are eternally reciting the four Vedas in penance for having told the truth. These four heads also represent the four heads of time, the [[Yugas]]. They also represent four divisions of the Hindu society, the four [[Varna|Veda]]s.
