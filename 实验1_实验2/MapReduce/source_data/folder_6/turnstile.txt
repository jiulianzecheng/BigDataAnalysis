 A '''turnstile''', also called a '''baffle gate''', is a type of [[gate]]. It only allows one person to pass at a time.  It can also be made so as to make [[One-way traffic#One-way traffic of people|one-way traffic of people]]. It can also make passage only to people who put in a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. A turnstile can be used for [[Fare control|paid access]] (sometimes called a '''faregate''' when used for this). For example, it can be used in [[public transport]] as a ticket barrier or at a [[pay toilet]].  
 
 Turnstiles are used at a [[variety]] of places. This includes [[stadiums]], amusement parks, [[museum]]s, and [[mass transit]] stations.
