 The '''goldcrest''' (''Regulus regulus'') is a tiny [[passerine]] bird in the [[kinglet]] family. Its colourful golden [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] feathers gives rise to its popular name. The scientific name, ''R. regulus'', means king or knight. < ref > [http://voice.gardenbird.co.uk/all-about-the-goldcrest/ All about the goldcrest] < /ref >   
 
 There are several subspecies. The bird has a very large distribution range: much of the [[Palearctic]] and the islands of [[Macaronesia]] and [[Iceland]]. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range [[bird migration|migrate]] to [[winter]] further south. 
 
 The goldcrest breeds in [[coniferous]] [[woodland]] and in gardens, It builds its compact, three-layered [[nest]] on a tree branch. Ten to twelve [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] are [[incubation|incubated]] by the female alone. The chicks are fed by both parents, and second broods are common.  
 
 This little bird is always on the move as it searches for [[Insectivore|insects to eat]]. In winter it is often found with flocks of [[tit (bird)|tits]]. It may be killed by [[birds of prey]] or carry [[parasite]]s, but its large range and population means it is doing quite well. It is not a  [[conservation biology|conservation]] concern.
