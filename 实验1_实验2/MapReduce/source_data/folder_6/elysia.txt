 '''''Elysia''''' is a [[genus]] of [[sea slug]]s, They are [[Marine biology|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Plakobranchidae]]. These animals are very colorful. They can look like [[nudibranch]]s, but are not very closely related to them. They are [[sacoglossa]]ns, commonly known as sap-sucking slugs. < ref name= " WoRMS " > Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S. (2010). Elysia Risso, 1818. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G.

 ''Elysia'' sea slugs eat [[algae]]. Some species such as ''[[Elysia viridis|E. viridis]]'' and ''[[Elysia chlorotica|E. chlorotica]]'' use the [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] in the algae for themselves. The chloroplasts line the slug’s [[digestive tract]]. It lets the slugs live by [[photosynthesis]] for several months at a time. Exactly how the slugs use the chloroplasts is unclear. Many of the [[Protein|proteins]] used by chloroplasts are encoded in the [[genome]] of their [[cell]]s. There are hunreds of these proteins. They are made in the [[Cell nucleus|cell’s nucleus]]. They are then moved into the chloroplast. This lets the slug. < ref > [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120906-will-humans-ever-photosynthesise BBC News item] < /ref > 
 
 This genus was said to be in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Stiligeridae]]. It has also been placed in the family [[Elysiidae]].
