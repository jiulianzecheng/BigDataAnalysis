 == History == 
 In the ''Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology'', Michael Gaenzle writes:  " The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation. One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in [[Switzerland]], but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the [[Fertile Crescent]] several thousand years earlier ... Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years.

 Bread made from 100% [[rye]] [[flour]] is popular in the northern half of [[Europe]]. It  is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a [[leavening agent]] for rye bread, because rye does not contain enough [[gluten]]. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the [[starch]] in the flour, as well as other [[carbohydrates]] known as pentosans. however, rye [[amylase]] is active at much higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during cooking. The lowered [[pH]] of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. < ref name= " d.wing " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VA6y1EMnkpYC & pg=PA34|title=The Bread Builders: Hearth Loaves and Masonry Ovens|last1=Scott, Alan|last2=Daniel Wing|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing Company|year=1999|isbn=978-1-890132-05-7|location=White River Junction (VT)|pages=34–230|access-date=June 28, 2010}} < /ref >  In the southern part of Europe, where panettone was originally made with sourdough, < ref name= " Gobbetti6 " / >  sourdough has become less common in recent times.

 === Starter === 
 The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the  " starter "  or  " leaven " , also known as the  " chief " ,  " chef " ,  " head " ,  " mother "  or  " sponge " ), a [[fermented]] mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of [[microorganism]]s including wild [[yeast]] and [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]]. < ref name= " HamelmanBread " > {{Cite book|title=Bread: a baker's book of techniques and recipes|url=https://archive.org/details/breadbakersbooko0000hame|last=Jeffrey Hamelman|publisher=John Wiley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-471-16857-7|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/breadbakersbooko0000hame/page/6 6]–362}} < /ref >  The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters. 
 
 Flour already contains different kinds of yeast and bacteria spores. When flour comes in contact with water, the enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into different sugars. The yeast which is part of sourdough, can use these sugars. The mixture will develop into a stable bacteria culture, which will use fermentation. The yeast will produce [[carbon dioxide]] as a by-product of fermentation, which will leaven the dough. 
 
 Obtaining a satisfactory rise from sourdough takes longer than a dough leavened with baker's yeast because the yeast in a sourdough is less vigorous. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWSVpBheCnYC & pg=PT197|title=Glorious French food: a fresh approach to the classics|last=Peterson, James A.|publisher=J.

 === Refreshment of the starter === 
 [[File:Sourdough.jpg|thumb|Recently refreshed sourdough]]

 The ratio of fermented starter to fresh flour and water is critical in the development and maintenance of a starter.

 A drier and cooler starter has less bacterial activity and more yeast growth, which results in the bacterial production of more [[acetic acid]] relative to lactic acid. Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid.

 === Intervals between refreshments === 
 A stable culture in which ''L. sanfranciscensis'' is the dominant bacterium requires a temperature between {{Convert|25|-|30|C|F}} and refreshments every 24 hours for about two weeks. Refreshment intervals of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem. < ref name= " daniel.wing.michael.ganzle.correspondence " > {{Cite web|url=http://samartha.net/SD/docs/DW-post1-4.html|title=Dan Woods long posts 1–4|last=Wing, Gänzle|access-date=Dec 15, 2011|archive-date=November 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120071611/http://samartha.net/SD/docs/DW-post1-4.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The intervals between refreshments of the starter may be reduced in order to increase the rate of gas (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) production, a process described as  " acceleration.

 === Baking === 
 The starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. < ref name= " pain au levain " / > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Thiele, C.|last2=Gänzle, M.

A number of 'no knead' methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread. 
 
 Because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.{{Reflist|group=note}}
