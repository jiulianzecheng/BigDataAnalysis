Roti is a type of Indian flatbread made using different flours. It is a [[staple food]] in many parts of [[India]] and other South Asian countries. Roti can be made from wheat flour, rice flour, millet flour, corn flour, or a combination of these. The dough is kneaded with water and sometimes salt, oil, or ghee. Then it is rolled into thin circles and cooked on a hot griddle or tawa. Roti can be eaten plain or with various accompaniments such as curries, dal, pickles, chutneys, or yogurt. Roti is also known by different names in different regions, such as chapati, phulka, paratha, naan, kulcha, or bhakri.
