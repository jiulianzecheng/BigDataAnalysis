 '''Quechuas''' is the term used for several ethnic groups in [[South America]] that use a [[Quechua]] language ([[Southern Quechua]] mainly). They belong to several ethnic groups in [[South America]], above all in [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]]. 
 
 The Quechuas of [[Ecuador]] call themselves - as well as their language [[Kichwa]] - ''Kichwas'' or ''Quichuas''. The Kichwa-speaking group of Colombia are the [[Ingas]]. 
 
 Some (historic) Quechua peoples: 
 * [[Inca]] 
 * [[Chancas]] (in Huancavelica, Ayacucho y Apurímac) 
 * [[Huancas]] (in Junín; spoke Quechua before the Incas did) 
 * [[Cañaris]] (in [[Ecuador]]; adopted the Quechua language from the Incas)
