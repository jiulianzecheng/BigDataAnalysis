 '''Obertshausen''' is a city in the [[Offenbach Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Obertshausen is in the ''Rhine Main area''. The town is about 15 & nbsp;km southeast of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]. The whole area of the town is 13.62 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  large and it is 113 m above sea level. < ref > [http://www.obertshausen.de/ Homepage of the City of Obertshausen], looked up on 21 January 2010, German. < /ref >  It is a plain area with no hills. 
 
 About 35 to 20 million years ago in the Age of [[Tertiary]] the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]]s sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor. 
 
 The city consists out of the two former independent villages ''Obertshausen'' and ''Hausen'', which are now the two urban districts of Obertshausen. On 1 January 1977 they were united. 
 
 The neighbours of Obertshausen are:  
 * [[Offenbach]] (Northwest) 
 * [[Mühlheim (Main)|Mühlheim]] (North) 
 * [[Hanau]] (Northeast) ([[Main-Kinzig-Kreis Rural District]]) 
 * [[Hainburg]] (East) 
 * [[Rodgau]] (Southeast) 
 * [[Heusenstamm]] (Southwest) 
 
 Obertshausen has 24,141 inhabitants (2008). < ref > [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html Official statistiks of the state of Hesse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173109/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html |date=2016-05-13 }}, looked up on 21 January 2010, German. < /ref >  The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 Some local people are speaking a regional type ([[dialect]]) of the German [[language]] with a certain tone and special words. It is a [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] (German: ''Hessisch''). This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a [[minority]] and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain [[pronunciation]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In the year 865 the name of the village ''Obertshausen'' was written down in a document for the first time. It was a kind of farm of the [[monastery]] of [[Seligenstadt]] to produce food for the [[monk]]s. 
 
 In 1979 the city got the [[town privileges]]. 
 
 In former times the people in the Obertshausen area were mostly [[farmer]]s, [[craft]]smen, but not [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. 
 
 In the time period of the [[industrial revolution]] the Rhine Main area got many factories and developed to a center for [[metal]] working and [[leather]] [[manufacturing]], also [[chemical engineering]]. Many men got [[work]]men and found a job in the factories and earned money. This made living conditions partly better.
