 '''''Cryolophosaurus''''' is a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Jurassic]] period. It is the only theropod to be found in [[Antarctica]]. ''Cryolophosaurus'' was discovered in the [[Jurassic]] Hanson Formation in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. The find of this dinosaur was significant because it proves that the dinosaurs lived on all  continents and that high latitude climates were tolerated by dinosaurs at that time. 
 
 ''Cryolophosaurus'' is also significant because it is the oldest known [[tetanuran]] from any continent: it is the only one from the early Jurassic. 
 
 ''Cryolophosaurus'' had a large [[crest]] on the top of the skull, above the eyes. It extends upwards from the skull. 
 
 ''Cryolophosaurus'' was found about {{convert|650|km|mi}} from the [[South Pole]] but then it was about {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}} or so farther north. < ref name=Ham99 > Hammer W.R.  &  Hickerson W.J. 1999.
