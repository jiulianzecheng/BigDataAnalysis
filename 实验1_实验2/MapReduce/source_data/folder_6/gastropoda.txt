 '''Gastropods''', or ''univalves'', are the largest and most successful [[class (biology)|class]] of [[mollusc]]s. 60,000–75,000 known living [[species]] belong to it. Most of are [[Ocean|marine]], but many live in [[freshwater]] or on land. Their fossil record goes back to the later [[Cambrian]]. 
 
 [[Slug]]s and [[snail]]s, [[abalone]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[cowry|cowries]], [[conch]]es, [[top shell]]s, [[whelk]]s, and [[sea slug]]s are all gastropods.  
 The gastropods are in origin sea-floor [[predator]]s, though they did [[evolve]] into many other [[habitat]]s.  
 
 Many lines living today evolved in the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]], taking advantage of the huge supply of food on the sea floor's [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. < ref > Such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] or various [[mangrove]] and [[Sea grass|seagrass]] meadows < /ref >

 They have a well-defined [[head]] with two or four sensory [[tentacle]]s. They also have a head-foot, which it moves on. The eyes at the tip of the tentacles range from simple to more complex eyes. < ref > {{cite book | last=Götting | first=Klaus-Jürgen | title= Lexikon der Biologie | chapter=Schnecken | editor=Becker U.

 Most members have a [[animal shell|shell]], which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled; it usually opens on the right hand side (viewed with the shell apex pointing up). Some species have an [[operculum]], a lid or trapdoor to close the shell. In some, the slugs, the shell is absent, and the body is streamlined. The best-known gastropods are land slugs and snails, but more than half of all species live in a [[Ocean|marine]] environment. Marine gastropods include [[herbivore]]s, [[detritus]] feeders, [[carnivore]]s and a few [[cilia]]ry feeders, in which the [[radula]] is reduced or absent. The radula is usually adapted to the food that a species eats. 
 
 The simplest gastropods are the [[limpet]]s and [[abalone]]s, both herbivores that use their hard radulas to rasp at [[seaweed]]s on rocks. Many marine gastropods are [[burrow]]ers and have siphons or tubes that extend from the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] and sometimes the shell. These act as snorkels, enabling the animal to continue to draw in a water current containing [[oxygen]] and food into their bodies. The siphons are also used to detect prey from a distance. These gastropods breathe with [[gill]]s. Some freshwater species and almost all terrestric species have developed [[lung]]s. 
 
 Gastropods from several different families are called [[sea slug]]s. They are often flamboyantly coloured. This may be either as a [[Warning colouration|warning]] if they are [[poison]]ous or to [[camouflage]] them on the [[coral]]s and [[seaweed]]s where many of them live. Their gills are often [[feather]]y plumes on their backs. This is what gives the name to the [[nudibranch]]s. Nudibranchs with smooth or warty backs have no visible gill mechanisms and respiration may take place directly through the skin. A few of the sea slugs are herbivores and some are carnivores. Many have distinct dietary preferences and regularly occur in association with certain species. 
 
 == Classification == 
 The [[taxonomy]] of the Gastropoda is under constant revision: two major revisions have been published in the last twenty years. < ref > Ponder W.F.  &  Lindberg D.R. 1996. Gastropod phylogeny—challenges for the 90s. p135–154. In: Taylor J. (ed) ''Origin and evolutionary radiation of the Mollusca''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. < /ref > < ref > Ponder W.  &  Lindberg D.R. 1997. Towards a phylogeny of gastropod molluscs: an analysis using morphological characters. ''Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''119''': 83–265. < /ref > < ref > Bouchet P.  &  Rocroi J-P. (eds) 2005. Classification and nomenclator of gastropod families. ''Malacologia: International Journal of Malacology'', '''47''' (1–2). ConchBooks: Hackenheim, Germany. {{ISBN|3-925919-72-4}} [http://www.vliz.be/Vmdcdata/imis2/ref.php?refid=78278] < /ref >  There will certainly be other revisions using the [[data]] from [[DNA]] sequencing. At present, the taxonomy of the Gastropoda may differ from author to author. 
 
 According to modern [[cladism]], the taxonomy of the Gastropoda should be written in terms of strictly [[monophyletic]] groups. That means only one lineage of gastropods in each group. It will be difficult to do this, and still have a practical [[taxonomy]] for working biologists. Classifying animals in practice means using [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] (what they look like). But there are differences between the older groupings got from morphology, and those based on [[genome]] sequences. < ref > Jeffery, Paul 2001. ''Suprageneric classification of class GASTROPODA''. The Natural History Museum, London. < /ref >  [[Convergent evolution]], which has occurred often in gastropods, may account for this. 
 
 This was the traditional classification into four subclasses: 
 * [[Prosobranchia]]: (gills in front of the [[heart]]). 
 * [[Opisthobranchia]]: (gills to the right and behind the heart). 
 * [[Gymnomorpha]]: (no shell) 
 * [[Pulmonata]]: (with lungs instead of gills) 
 
 ==Geological history== 
 [[File:Helix.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Helix aspersa / Cornu aspersum'':  < br/ > the [[garden snail]]]] 
 
 The first gastropods were exclusively marine. The first of the group appeared in the Upper [[Cambrian]] (''Chippewaella'', ''Strepsodiscus''). By the [[Ordovician]] period the gastropods were a varied group present in a few aquatic habitats. Commonly, [[fossil]] gastropods from the rocks of the early [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]] are too poorly preserved for accurate identification. Still, the [[Silurian]] genus ''Poleumita'' contains fifteen identified species. Fossil gastropods are less common during the Palaeozoic era than [[bivalve]]s. 
 
 Most of the gastropods of that era belong to primitive groups. A few of these groups still survive today. By the [[Carboniferous]] period many of the shapes seen in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record. Despite these similarities in appearance, the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms. It was during the [[Mesozoic]] era that the [[ancestor]]s of many of the living gastropods [[evolution|evolved]]. One of the earliest known terrestrial (land-dwelling) gastropods is ''Maturipupa'' which is found in the [[Coal]] measures of the Carboniferous period in [[Europe]]. In the case of the common fossil ''Bellerophon'', from Carboniferous limestones in Europe, it is not known whether it is a gastropod or not. 
 
 Relatives of the modern land snails are rare before the [[Cretaceous]] period. The familiar ''[[Helix (gastropod)|Helix]]'' first appeared in that period. 
 
 [[File:Slimaczek.jpg|thumb|250px|''Cepaea nemoralis'', the [[grove snail]]]] 
 
 In rocks of the Mesozoic era gastropods are more common as fossils and their shell is often well preserved. Their fossils occur in beds of both freshwater and marine environments. The [[Purbeck Marble]] of the [[Jurassic]] period and the Sussex Marble of the early Cretaceous, which both occur in southern [[England]], are [[limestone]]s containing the tightly packed remains of the pond snail ''Viviparus''. 
 
 Rocks of the [[Cainozoic]] era have very large numbers of gastropod fossils in them. Many of these fossils are closely related to modern living forms. The diversity of the gastropods increased markedly at the beginning of this era, along with that of the bivalves. 
 
 Gastropods are one of the groups that record the changes in fauna caused by the advance and retreat of the ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.
