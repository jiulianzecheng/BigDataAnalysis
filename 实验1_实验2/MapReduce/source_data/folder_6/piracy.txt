 '''Piracy''' can mean different things; it can be a [[crime]] that is committed. A human on a [[ship]] at [[sea]] is called a '''pirate''' and usually has small, fast [[boats]]. Pirates use such boats to attack other ships, which are usually large cargo [[ships]]. < ref name= " newinternationalweekly.com " > {{Cite news|url=https://newinternationalweekly.com/2017/11/19/the-dynamics-of-modern-global-sea-piracy/|title=The Dynamics of Modern Global Sea |date=2017-11-19|newspaper=New International Weekly|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-US|archive-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206140239/https://newinternationalweekly.com/2017/11/19/the-dynamics-of-modern-global-sea-piracy/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  [[File:Pirate Flag of Rack Rackham.svg|thumb|right|The Jolly Roger flag is a well known symbol of pirates]] 
 For as long as ships have sailed the sea, there have been pirates. Piracy still happens often in the [[Gulf of Aden]], mostly by [[Somalia|Somali]] pirates. < ref name= " newinternationalweekly.com "  / >  [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Middle Ages|Medieval kings]], and the [[British Empire]] dealt with pirates. Fighting pirates has sometimes been one of the most important roles of a [[navy]]. 
 
 == Modern == 
 Modern pirates usually climb onto ships to get [[money]]. In the process, they may kill the [[crew]] or hold it for [[ransom]]. In a very few cases, they may also take over the ship and sell its [[cargo]]. 
 
 The cargo ships that travel the [[oceans]] are huge, but they usually have very few [[crew]] members working on them. Their size often makes the ships carry a lot of money in the [[safe (container)|safe]]. The money is used to pay the crew, to pay for the taxes to stay at a [[port]], or to pass through a [[canal|channel]].
