 '''Coinbase''' is a company that lets people buy and sell cryptocurrency such as [[Bitcoin]]. It's a big company in the US and was started by two people in 2012. The company doesn't have a physical headquarters and all the employees work from home. In 2020, Coinbase decided to close its San Francisco office and operate entirely remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was a trend seen in many other tech companies at the time. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Leising|first=Matthew|date=2021-03-01|title=Coinbase mafia shows how tight a circle holds sway over Bitcoin|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/01/business/tech/coinbase-bitcoin-control/|access-date=2023-03-27|website=The Japan Times|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|date=2020-05-27|title=Coinbase Expands Institutional Services With Tagomi Purchase|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-27/coinbase-expands-institutional-services-with-tagomi-purchase|access-date=2023-03-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Coinbase aims to support inclusion with a remote-first workforce|url=https://www.hrdive.com/news/coinbase-aims-to-support-inclusion-with-a-remote-first-workforce/596884/|access-date=2023-03-27|website=HR Dive|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=2022-05-23|title=TaskRabbit to close all office locations, including S.F. headquarters, as it moves to remote work model|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/taskrabbit-sf-remote-17188335.php|access-date=2023-03-27|website=San Francisco Chronicle|language=en-US}} < /ref >
