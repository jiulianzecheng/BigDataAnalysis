 '''Hyaenas''' (sometimes '''''Hyenas''''') are [[mammal]]s. They are the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Hyaenidae''', in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. They live in [[Africa]], and in west and south [[Asia]]. In the past they had a much wider distribution. Now there are two subfamilies with four [[species]]. 
 
 With only four species, it is the fourth-smallest family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class [[Mammalia]]. < ref name=Rose > Rosevear D.R. 1974. ''The carnivores of West Africa''. London: British Museum (Natural History), p341{{ndash}}4. {{ISBN|0565007238}} < /ref >  Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components to most [[Africa]]n and some [[Asia]]n ecosystems. < ref name=Mills > Mills, Gus  &  Hofer, Heribert 1998. ''Hyaenas: status survey and conservation action plan''. IUCN/SSC Hyena Specialist Group. {{ISBN|2-8317-0442-1}} < /ref > 
 
 Hyaena walk much like [[bears]] because their front legs are longer than their back. Hyaenas are known to have one of the world's strongest bites. Its function is to crush bone. 
 
 == Relationships == 
 Hyaenas look much like [[canids]], but they are actually in the [[Feliformia]], with [[Felidae|cats]] and [[mongoose]]s. Although [[phylogeny|related]] to [[felidae|felines]] and [[viverrid]]s, their [[life style]] is similar to [[canidae|canids]].  
 
 [[Convergent evolution]] has taken place. Both hyaenas and canids are non-[[arboreal|climbing]], [[running]] hunters which catch prey with their teeth rather than claws. Both eat food quickly and may store it. Their calloused feet have large, blunt, nonretractable nails, good for running and making sharp turns. However, the hyaenas' grooming, scent marking, defecating habits, mating, and parental behaviour are similar to the behaviour of other feliforms. < ref name= " k274 " > Kruuk, Hans 1972. ''The spotted hyena: a study of predation and social behavior''. University of California Press, p274. < /ref >  Hyenas are matriarchal. This means that females dominate and males are inferior. < ref > Holekamp, Kay E., and Laura Smale.  " Dispersal status influences hormones and behavior in the male spotted hyena. "  Hormones and Behavior 33.3 (1998): 205-216 < /ref > 
 
 == Hunting == 
 Hyaenas were long said to be cowardly [[scavenger]]s, but they kill as much as 95% of the food they eat (especially spotted hyaenas). < ref > http://www.hyaenidae.org/the-hyaenidae/spotted-hyaena-crocuta-crocuta/crocuta-diet-and-foraging.html{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  They can drive off [[leopard]]s or [[lion]]esses from their kills. Hyenas are mostly [[nocturnal]] animals, but may leave their lairs in the early morning. Except for the very social spotted hyaena, hyenas are generally not [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] animals, though they may live in family groups and come together at kills. < ref name=Rose/ > 
 
 Hyaenas are intelligent creatures. They work together well and are cooperative. They have strategic hunting methods and work to steal and protect food it from other predators. Hyaenas' main targets are [[zebra]] and [[wildebeest]]. Their main rival is the lion. Whether hyaenas do or do not chase lions off their kills is mostly a matter of numbers.
