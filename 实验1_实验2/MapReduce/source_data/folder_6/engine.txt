 An '''engine''', or '''motor''', is a [[machine]] used to change [[energy]] into movement that can be used. The energy can be in any form. Common forms of energy used in engines are [[electricity]], [[chemical]] (such as petrol or diesel) or [[heat]]. When a chemical is used to produce energy it is known as ''[[fuel]]''.  
 
 == Terminology == 
 In past centuries ''[[motor]]'' and  " engine "  meant very different things. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/whats-the-difference-between-a-motor-and-an-engine/|title=MIT School of Engineering {{!}} » What's the difference between a motor and an engine?|website=Mit Engineering|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}} < /ref >  A motor was made to move something such as a [[vehicle]]. This meaning is still often used. Sometimes a thing is called an engine if it creates mechanical energy from heat, and a motor if it creates mechanical energy from other kinds of energy, like electricity. Typical ''engines'' in this meaning are [[steam engine]] and [[internal combustion engine]], while typical ''motors'' are [[electric motor]] and hydraulic motor. And sometimes the two words mean the same thing. 
 
 " Engine "  was originally a term for any mechanical device that converts force into motion. Hence, pre-industrial weapons such as [[catapult]]s, trebuchets and [[battering ram]]s were called  " siege engines " . The word  " gin, "  as in  " cotton gin " , is short for  " engine. "  The word derives from Old French ''engine'', from the Latin ''ingenium'', which is also the root of the word ''ingenious''. Most mechanical devices invented during the industrial revolution were described as engines—the [[steam engine]] being a notable example. 
 
 ==Piston engines==

 Early kinds of engine used heat that was outside of the engine itself to heat up a gas to a high pressure. This was usually steam and the engines are called [[steam engine]]s. The steam was piped to the engine where it pushed on [[piston]]s to bring about motion. These engines were commonly used in old factories, boats and trains. 
 
 Most cars use a chemical engine that burns fuel inside it. This is called an [[internal combustion engine]].  There are many different types of internal combustion engine. They can be grouped by fuel, cycle and configuration. Common fuel types for internal combustion engines are petrol, diesel, auto gas and alcohol. There are many other types of fuels. 
 
 There are 3 different types of cycle. 2-stroke engines produce power once every turn of the engine. [[Four-stroke engine|4-stroke engines]] cylinders make power once every two turns of the engine. 6-stroke engines cylinders make power twice in every six turns of the engine.  
 
 There are lots of different configurations of piston engines. Their cylinders have [[piston]]s in them and a [[crankshaft]]. Any number of cylinders can be used but 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 are common. The [[cylinder]]s can be arranged in many ways, in a straight line, at an angle to each other or in a circle. 
 
 A [[Wankel engine]] has no cylinders and uses a triangle shaped rotor spinning in an oval housing which mimics the movement of a piston. 
 
 ==Turbine engines==

 Hot [[gas]] can also be made to push a [[turbine]] around rather like the way the wind turns a [[windmill]]. Most electric [[power station]]s use big [[steam turbine]]s. Others use [[water]] or [[wind]] turbines. Smaller turbines called [[gas turbine]]s are used for [[internal combustion engine]]s, such as the [[jet engine]]s used in [[aircraft]]. 
 
 ==Rocket engines==

 A [[rocket]] causes movement by shooting jets of gas very fast out of a nozzle. The gas may have been stored under pressure or be a chemical fuel that burns to make a very hot gas. Although they are very simple, rockets are the most powerful engines we know how to make. They will work in space where there is nothing to push against. 
 
 ==Electric motors==

 [[Electric motor]]s do not use a fuel. The energy is supplied to them by electricity carried along [[wire]]s.  The energy may come from a fuel being burnt somewhere else a long way off. The electricity is used to make powerful [[magnet]]s inside the motor switch on and off at the right time to turn the shaft of the motor. 
 
 ''Electric engine'' is not a motor, but a railway [[locomotive]] which runs on electricity.
