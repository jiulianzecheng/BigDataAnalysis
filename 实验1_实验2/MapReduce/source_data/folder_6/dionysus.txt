 '''Dionysus''' ({{respell|die|oh|NIS|ee|us}}, also spelt '''Dionysos''', '''Dionysius''') is the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god of frenzies, festivities, spiritual ecstasy, wine, and alcohol in general. 
 Amongst the Orphists (who are a select group of followers of the Ancient Greek Religion) Dionysus is considered a saviour. 
 
 ==Mythology== 
 There are two stories on how Dionysus was born. One describes that he was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Semele]], and the other describes that he was the son of Zeus and [[Persephone]], queen of the [[Underworld]]. Either way, in both stories Dionysus is sent to the Underworld by Zeus' jealous wife Hera and then saved and brought to life afterwards. He was the God of celebrations. 
 Dionysus was also the god of wine. According to a myth, the [[Titans]] lured Dionysus with toys and wanted to eat him. When [[Zeus]] found out it was too late and they had eaten everything except his heart. With that [[Zeus]] put the heart in the womb of [[Semele]] and he was born again.
