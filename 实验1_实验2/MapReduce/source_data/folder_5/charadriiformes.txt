 '''Charadriiformes''' is a diverse order of small to medium-large [[bird]]s. It includes about 350 [[species]]. It has members in all parts of the world. Most charadriiformes live near [[water]] and eat [[invertebrate]]s or other small animals. However, some are pelagic ([[sea bird]]s), some occupy deserts, and a few are found in thick forest.
