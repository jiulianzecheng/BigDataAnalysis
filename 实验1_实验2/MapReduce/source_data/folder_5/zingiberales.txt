 '''Zingiberales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s. The order has been widely recognised by the taxonomists, at least for the past few decades. This order includes many familiar plants like [[ginger]], [[cardamom]], [[turmeric]], [[galangal]] and [[myoga]] of the [[Zingiberaceae]] or ginger family, and [[banana]]s and plantains of the [[Musaceae]] or banana family, along with [[arrowroot]] of the [[Marantaceae]] or arrowroot family.
