 '''Banksy''' is a [[Britain|British]] street and graffiti [[artist]]. He likes to remain [[wikt:anonymous|anonymous]] and not let people know his true identity. He often draws in high visibility public places such as on [[building]]s or [[train station]]s. His paintings are often about [[politics]], [[war]] and other important topics. 
 
 His [[satirical]] [[street art]] and mind-hurting pictures combine dark [[humour]] with [[graffiti]]. The graffiti is done with a [[wikt:stencil|stencilling]] technique. Such works have been done on streets, walls, and bridges of cities throughout the world. < ref > [http://weburbanist.com/2007/07/19/banksy-paradox-unofficial-guide-to-the-worlds-most-infamous-urban-guerilla-street-artist/  " The Banksy Paradox: seven sides to the world's most infamous street artist] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402080538/http://weburbanist.com/2007/07/19/banksy-paradox-unofficial-guide-to-the-worlds-most-infamous-urban-guerilla-street-artist/ |date=2011-04-02 }}, 2007 < /ref >

 There have been numerous rumours as to Banksy's identity. Names often suggested include Robert Banks and Robin Gunningham. < ref name= " MailUnmasked " > {{cite news|first=Claudia|last=Joseph|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1034538/Graffiti-artist-Banksy-unmasked---public-schoolboy-middle-class-suburbia.html|title=Graffiti artist Banksy unmasked|work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=13 July 2008|access-date=26 January 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204124256/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1034538/Graffiti-artist-Banksy-unmasked---public-schoolboy-middle-class-suburbia.html| archive-date= 4 February 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm|title=Real name: Robert Banks, 32 years old in 2006 (BBC)|work=BBC News |date=15 September 2006|access-date=26 January 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090111180057/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5346822.stm| archive-date= 11 January 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2004 an alleged photograph of him in [[Jamaica]] surfaced. In October 2007 the BBC website featured a photo allegedly taken by a passer-by in [[Bethnal Green]], London, purporting to show Banksy at work with an assistant, scaffolding and a truck. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7069870.stm BBC News Website – Artist Banksy 'captured in photo'] BBC News 30 October 2007 < /ref >  From the pictures, Banksy's identity was thought to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in [[Bristol]] on 28 July 1973. Gunningham was educated at Bristol Cathedral Choir School and Leicester Polytechnic, now De Montfort University, and according to a former friend, was  " extremely talented at art " . 
 
 Lived with artist Luke Egan. Around 2000, when Banksy moved from Bristol to London, Gunningham is known to have moved from Bristol to a London flat in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], and a number of Banksy's most famous works appeared nearby. At that time, Gunningham lived with Jamie Eastman, who worked for a record label that used illustrations by Banksy. < ref name= " MailUnmasked " / > < ref > {{cite news|first=Lee |last=Taylor |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/banksy-art-appears-on-londons-princess-of-wales-pub/story-e6frfq80-1225879898665 |title=Banksy art appears on London's Princess of Wales pub |publisher=[[News Limited]] |date=16 June 2010 |access-date=16 June 2010 | location=London| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100617195346/http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/banksy-art-appears-on-londons-princess-of-wales-pub/story-e6frfq80-1225879898665| archive-date= 17 June 2010 | url-status= live}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article2774359.ece |title=Banksy, the celebrated graffiti artist, is caught in the act for first time |first=Patrick |last=Foster |work=The Times |location=UK |date=31 October 2007 |access-date=26 January 2009 }} < /ref > 
 
 In May 2009, the ''Mail on Sunday'' once again speculated about Gunningham being Banksy. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1180361/Banksy-revealed-Graffiti-artist-paints-self-portrait-London-office-block.html |title=Banksy revealed?

 In response to reports that Banksy was Robin Gunningham, Banksy's agent refused to either confirm or deny the reports. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7504132.stm|title=Paper 'reveals Banksy's identity'|work=BBC News |date=13 July 2008|access-date=26 January 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122071616/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7504132.stm| archive-date= 22 January 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref > 
 
 Simon Hattenstone from ''[[The Guardian]]'' is one of the very few people to have interviewed him face to face. Hattenstone describes him as  " a cross of [[Jimmy Nail]] and British rapper Mike Skinner "  and  " a 28-year old male who showed up wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a silver tooth, silver chain, and one silver earring.

 Banksy himself states on his website: {{Blockquote|I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.html |title=Banksy's own website |publisher=Banksy |access-date=26 January 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130094335/http://banksy.co.uk/menu.html| archive-date= 30 January 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref > }}
