 '''Humidity''' means [[water vapor]] in the [[air]], but not to liquid droplets in [[fog]], [[clouds]], or [[rain]].  [[Desert]]s usually have low humidity, and [[tropical]] regions have high humidity. The [[word]]  " humid "  often means that the humidity is high, which gives the feeling of being very damp (wet air), stuffy, or even sweltering when the [[temperature]] is also high. When the humidity is low, the air can be said to be  " not humid "  or  " dry. " 
 
 Higher humidity reduces the effectiveness of [[sweat]]ing in cooling the body by reducing the rate of evaporation of moisture from the skin. 
 
 The term  " [[relative humidity]] "  is used to note the [[amount]] of humidity as a [[percent]], from 0-100%. [[Meteorologist]]s use  [[hygrometer]]s to [[measurement|measure]] the humidity in the air. 
 
 Humidity affects the rate of [[evaporation]]. With a higher humidity, the rate of evaporation is less.
