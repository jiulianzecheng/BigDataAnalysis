 The '''axolotl''' (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') is the best known of the Mexican mole [[salamander]]s: it belongs to the Tiger Salamander complex. The '''Axolotl''' shows [[paedomorphosis]]: the [[larvae]] do not undergo [[metamorphosis]], so the adults stay aquatic, with external [[gills]].  
 
 == Natural history == 
 The species evolved in the lake underlying [[Mexico City]]'''. Axolotls''' are used a lot in scientific research because they can [[Regeneration|regenerate]] most body parts, are easy to breed, and have large [[embryo]]s.

 '''Axolotls''' are closely related to [[Tiger Salamander|waterdogs]], the larval stage of the closely related Tiger salamanders ''[[Tiger salamander|Ambystoma tigrinum]]'' and ''Ambystoma mavortium''. These are common in much of [[North America]] and also sometimes become neotenic. The [[mudpuppy|mudpuppies]], ''Necturus'', are fully-aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the '''axolotl,''' but look like it. 
 
 Wild '''axolotls''' are now near extinction  < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8220000/8220636.stm BBC - Earth News - Axolotl verges on wild extinction] < /ref >  due to population growth in Mexico City, and the polluted waters of the lake. Non-native fish, such as [[African]] [[tilapia]] and [[Asian]] [[carp]], have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the '''axolotls'''' young, as well as its primary source of food. < ref name= " nickbaker " > {{cite video

 == Genetics and development == 
 Compared with land-dwelling salamanders, the sexually mature adult '''Axolotl''' is a [[wikt:chimera|chimera]] (mixture) of larval and adult [[Tissue (biological)|tissues]]. A [[mutation]] in [[hormone]] production slows the development of the non-sexual tissues compared to the [[gonad]]s. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press, p203. < /ref >  So, it ends up as an adult which looks like a larva, except that it is sexually mature. This is an example of [[neoteny]], a type of [[heterochrony]]. '''Axolotls''' in the lab have reduced pigmentation and end up being a lighter pink color, while '''axolotls''' that live in nature are a darker, brown to black color.
