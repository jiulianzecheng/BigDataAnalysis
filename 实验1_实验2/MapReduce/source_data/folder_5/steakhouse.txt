 A '''steakhouse''', '''steak house''', or '''chophouse''' refers to a [[restaurant]] that specializes in [[steak]]s and chops. They are found mainly in [[North America]]. Modern steakhouses may also carry other cuts of meat including [[poultry]], [[Standing rib roast|roast prime rib]], and [[veal]], as well as [[fish]] and other [[seafood]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Chophouses started in [[London]] in the 1690s and served individual portions of meat, known as [[meat chop|chops]]. < ref > {{cite news|author=Davidson, Alan|work=[[Oxford Companion to Food]]|title=Chop}} < /ref >  The traditional nature of the food served was maintained through the later 19th century despite the new cooking styles from the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], which were becoming fashionable. The houses were normally only open for men. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.danddlondon.com/article/the-chop-house-tradition/616 |title=The chop house tradition |website=danddlondon.com|publisher=The Artful Diner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111230947/http://www.danddlondon.com/article/the-chop-house-tradition/616 |archive-date=November 11, 2013 }} < /ref > 
 
 The steakhouse started in the United States in the mid-19th century as a development from traditional inns and bars. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/raisingsteakslif00fuss |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/raisingsteakslif00fuss/page/287 287] |title=Raising steaks: the life and times of American beef |year=2008 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |author=Fussell, Betty|isbn=9780151012022 }} < /ref >  Steakhouses can be casual or formal fine dining restaurants. 
 
 The oldest chophouse in London Simpson's Tavern is regarded as an institution of London and retains its 19th century decor. The oldest continuously operating steakhouse in the United States is the [[Old Homestead Steakhouse]] in [[New York City]], established in 1868. Prior to that there were chophouses in New York City such as Cobweb Hall, owned by David Pattullo, which was known for their [[mutton]] chops and offered additional menu options such as [[beefsteak]]s, lamb kidneys, [[bacon]], and [[potato]]es. < ref name= " hist_ARar " > {{Cite web| title = A Rare History of the Steakhouse| author = Butler, Stephanie| website= HISTORY| date = October 24, 2014| access-date = 27 November 2018| url = https://www.history.com/news/a-rare-history-of-the-steakhouse}} < /ref >
