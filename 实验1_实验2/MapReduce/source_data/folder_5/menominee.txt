 The '''Menominee''' or  '''Menomini''' or '''''Mamaceqtaw''''' are a federally recognized group of [[Native American]] tribes. They live in [[Wisconsin]]. Their territory used to be much larger. It was about 10 million acres. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Brief History - About Us|url=https://www.menominee-nsn.gov/CulturePages/BriefHistory.aspx|access-date=2022-08-04|website=www.menominee-nsn.gov}} < /ref >  They are part of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]. Their large language group is the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-language. They speak the Menominee language. The five clans include the [[Bear]], the [[Eagle]], the [[Wolf]], the [[Crane (bird)|Crane]], and the [[Moose]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin|url=https://www.menominee-nsn.gov/|access-date=2022-08-04|website=www.menominee-nsn.gov}} < /ref >  An important food was [[wild rice]]. The [[Ojibwe people]] called them  " wild rice people "  or ''manoominii''. The tribes were usually peaceful. Descent and inheritance were through the father (patrilineal). < ref > " Menominee Clans depicted at UWSP " , ''Pointer Alumnus'', University of Wisconsin – Steven Point, Spring 2003, pp. 1 and 5 < /ref >  The tribes had similar cultures to the [[Ojibwa|Chippewa]]. The tribe had early contact with French colonists. In the 19th century, the Menominee sold much of their land to the [[United States]]. This included parts of [[Michigan]] and Wisconsin. In ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]'' (1968), the Supreme Court decided that the Menominee could keep their right to hunting and fishing. < ref > {{Cite web|title=MENOMINEE TRIBE OF INDIANS, Petitioner, v.
