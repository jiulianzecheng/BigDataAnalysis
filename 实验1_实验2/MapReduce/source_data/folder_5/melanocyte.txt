 '''Melanocytes''' are [[melanin]]-producing [[cells]]. They are most obvious in the [[skin]], [[hair]] and [[eyes]]. They are in the bottom layer of the [[skin]]'s [[epidermis]], in hairs, and in the [[iris (eye)|iris]] of the [[eye]], and some places inside the body. < ref name=pmid6616275 >

 Melanin is the [[pigment]] mostly responsible for skin and hair colour. It protects the skin against damage by [[UV radiation]] from the [[Sun]]. UV radiation causes damage to cell [[DNA]], which makes [[skin cancer]] more likely.  
 
 Melanocyte-stimulating [[hormones]] (MSH) from the [[pituitary gland]] causes melanocytes to produce more melanin. They stimulate the production and release of melanin by melanocytes in skin and hair. MSH signals to the [[brain]] have effects on [[appetite]] and [[sexual arousal]].
