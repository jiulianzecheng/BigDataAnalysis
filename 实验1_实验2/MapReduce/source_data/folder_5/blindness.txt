 '''Blindness''' is to not [[sight|see]] anything. Some people are called blind, even though they can see a little bit. This is because they cannot see clearly, but only see unfocused shapes or [[color|colors]].  
 
 In modern countries, few young people are blind. In all the world, blindness is mostly caused by [[malnutrition]] and [[disease]]s of old people, like [[cataract]]s and trachoma. People can become blind because of diseases or [[accident]]s, but sometimes people are born blind. 
 
 Legal blindness is defined as a level of [[visual acuity]] low enough to qualify for [[disability benefits]] and\or special accommodations. Legal blindness is also defined as being unable to be completely corrected by prescription [[Eyeglasses|glasses]] or [[contact lens]]es. 
 
 Some people are ''[[color blindness|color blind]]'', which means they can see, but cannot tell certain colors apart.  
 
 When people are blind they use such things as the alphabet in ''[[braille script|braille]]'' and ''[[guide dog]]s'' to do every day life things.  
 
 Famous blind people have included [[Louis Braille]], the inventor of the [[braille]] alphabet, [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Helen Keller]].
