 The '''Creodonta''' are, traditionally, an [[extinct]] [[order (biology)|order]] of [[mammal]]s which lived from the [[Palaeocene]] to the [[Miocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. They are distant relatives of the [[Carnivora]]. However, the [[carnassial]] teeth of modern carnivores and both groups of creodonts are not formed from the same teeth. This [[convergent evolution|evolutionary convergence]] suggests the creodonts are ''not'' the ancestors of modern carnivores.  
 
 Also, they are perhaps not a natural group. However, a phylogenetic analysis of Paleocene mammals published in 2015 supported the monophyly of Creodonta, and put the group as relatives of [[pangolin]]s. < ref name= " HallidayUpchurch2015 " > {{cite journal |last1=Halliday |first1=Thomas J.D. |last2=Upchurch |first2=Paul |last3=Goswami |first3=Anjali |title=Resolving the relationships of Paleocene placental mammals |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=92 |issue=1 |year=2015 |pages=521–550 |issn=1464-7931 |doi=10.1111/brv.12242 |pmid=28075073 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1473028/1/Halliday_et_al-Biological_Reviews.pdf |pmc=6849585}} < /ref >  There is an extensive literature on the subject. < ref > Janis, Christine M; Scott, Kathleen M.  &  Jacobs, Louis L.

 Creodonts were the dominant group of carnivorous mammals from 55 to 35 million years ago (mya) in the ecosystems of [[Africa]], [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. They competed with the [[Mesonychid]]s and the [[Entelodont]]s and ultimately outlasted them. In [[Oligocene]] Africa, they were the dominant [[predator]]y group.   
 
 At last, they lost ground to the [[Carnivora]]. The Carnivora are the only group to survive today. The last creodont [[genus]] went extinct eight million years ago, and modern carnivores now occupy their [[ecological niche]]s. 
 
 The first creodont [[fossil]]s were in the [[Palaeocene]], about 60 million years ago (mya), and the last ''[[Dissopsalis]]'', perhaps eight mya. So, the creodonts lasted for at least 50 million years. 
 
 == Adaptations == 
 Creodonts show various [[adaptation]]s to their carnivorous life-style, and show convergent evolution with modern carnivores. They share, for example, the [[carnassial]] shear, a modification of teeth that sliced meat like scissors. 
 
 The Carnivora also developed larger brains and more efficient running. Once [[forest]] and [[woodland]] was partly replaced by [[grassland]], in the [[Miocene]], the true carnivores had the advantage, and the creodonts lost ground and eventually became extinct.
