 '''The Carolinas''' are the U.S. states of [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. They were both part of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]], which gained independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1783. During the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]], the southern portion of the Carolinas was primarily a support for the British [[West Indies]]; where thousands upon thousands of slaves were brought in to feed the growing trade. The same could not be said about the northern part of the region, which was a sparsely populated area, mostly inhabited by decommissioned servants from the [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] area, many of whom set up small tobacco farms.
