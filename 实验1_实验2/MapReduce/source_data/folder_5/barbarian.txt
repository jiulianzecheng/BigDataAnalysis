 In [[Ancient Greece]], the name ''βάρβαρος'', ''bárbaros'', was given to all those who did not speak the [[Greek language]]. Later, the term '''Barbarian''' came to mean 'Anyone who is not Greek'. Later again, it meant 'anyone who is outside the [[Roman Empire]]'. 
 
 In modern use, the word is used to refer to an [[civilization|uncivilized]] or [[culture|uncultured]] person.  
 
 It is used for a member of a [[nation]] or [[ethnic group]] which is seen as having a lower level of civilization, or for an individual person which is seen as a brutal, cruel and insensitive or whose behavior is unacceptable in the civilized society of the speaker. When used for a person the word is always pejorative, when used for a nation not always.
