 '''Algae''' (singular: alga, plural: algae) are [[plant]]-like living things. They  make food from sunlight by [[photosynthesis]]. The study of algae is called [[phycology]] or [[algology]]. 
 
 The term covers different groups, and they are not all closely related. They are a [[polyphyletic]] group. The term lumps together different kinds of organisms. They are very ancient, and existed long before other types of plants. They date back to the [[Mesoproterozoic]], over a thousand million years ago. < ref >  T.M. Gibson 2018. Precise age of ''Bangiomorpha pubescens'' dates the origin of [[eukaryotic]] [[photosynthesis]].

 They have in common that they are [[autotroph]]ic: they use natural sources of energy and simple inorganic materials. As [[non-vascular plant]]s they do not have the structure of [[land plants]]. The name  " algae "  is convenient but a loose term. Recently, it has become clear how different the types of algae are. < ref >  Fritsch F.E. 1935. ''The structure and reproduction of the algae''.

 Algae are a large and diverse group of simple, typically [[autotroph]]ic organisms. Some have [[unicellular|one cell]] and others have [[multicellular|many cells]]. The largest and most complex marine algae are called [[seaweed]]s. They are like [[plant]]s, and  " simple "  because they lack the many distinct organs found in land plants.

 Algae do not have the same structures that land plants do, such as [[leaf|leaves]], [[root]]s, and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].  Nearly all algae have parts that do photosynthesis the same way as cyanobacteria. They make [[oxygen]], unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as ''purple'' and ''green'' bacteria. Some unicellular [[species]] use only external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic parts.

 === Types of algae === 
 Below are some important kinds of algae. 
 *[[Green algae]]: they are regarded as plants because they use the same type of chlorophyll as green plants do. An evolutionary relationship between green algae and green plants is assumed. 
 *[[Red algae]]: use a red pigment to capture the energy of sunlight, and so thought to have evolved separately from green plants. 
 *[[Brown algae]]: use chlorophyll a, but have several other biochemical differences. Also not considered a green plant. 
 *[[Yellow-green algae]]: the Xanthophyceae. 
 *[[Golden algae]]: the Chrysophyceae.

 === Ecology === 
 Algae are usually found in damp places or water, and are common on land and water. However, algae on land are usually inconspicuous and are far more common in moist, [[tropical]] [[region]]s than dry ones. Algae do not have vascular tissues and other adaptations to live on land, but they can endure dryness and other conditions in [[symbiosis]] with a [[fungus]] as [[lichen]]. 
 
 The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic [[ecology]]. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column are called [[phytoplankton]]. They provide the food base for most [[ocean|marine]] [[food chain]]s. Kelp grows mostly in shallow marine waters. Some are used as human food or harvested for [[agar]] or [[fertilizer]]. Kelp can grow in large stands called kelp forests. These forests prevent some of the damage from waves. Many different [[species]] live in them, including [[sea urchin]]s, sea [[otter]]s, and [[abalone]]. 
 
 Some algae may harm other species. Some algae may reproduce a lot, and make an [[algal bloom]].  These algae may make protective [[toxin]]s which kill fish in the water.  [[Dinoflagellate]]s make a compound that turns the flesh of fish into slime. Then the algae eats this nutritious liquid. 
 
 === Symbiosis === 
 [[File:Pteraeolidia ianthina Nick Hobgoood.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nudibranch]] ''Pteraeolidia ianthina'' contains algae which photosynthesize, and provide food for the mollusc]]  
 Algae have evolved a number of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] partnerships with other organisms. The most famous is the plant-like [[lichen]], which are each formed by a [[fungus]] with an alga. It is a highly successful life-form, and twenty thousand 'species' are known. In all cases the lichen are quite different in appearance and life-style from either constituent; it is possibly the most complete symbiosis known. Both constituents gain from their access to [[niche]]s with low nutrient value, which is where lichen are found. 
 
 Less well known are the algal relationships with animals. [[Reef]]-building [[coral]]s are basically social [[Cnidaria]]n [[polyp]]s. Corals are dependent on light, because the algae are important partners, and they require light. Corals have evolved structures, often tree-like, which offer the algae maximum access to light. The coral weakens the algal cell walls, and digests about 80% of the food synthesised by the algae. The corals' waste-products provide [[nutrient]]s for the algae so, as with lichen, both partners gain from the association. The algae are golden-brown [[Flagellum|flagellate]] algae, often of the genus ''Symbiodinium''. A curious feature of the partnership is that the coral may eject the algae in hard times, and regain them later. The ejection of the algal partner is called ''bleaching'', because the coral loses its colour. < ref name= " Att " / > < sup > p200 < /sup > 
 
 Other types of Cnideria, such as [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]], also contain algae. Jellyfish with algae behave so that their partners get the best light during the day, and descend to depths at night, where the water is rich in nitrates and brown with decay. [[Sea slug]]s and [[clam]]s are also well known for harbouring algae. Both groups are [[molluscs]]. The sea slugs graze on coral, and are the same colour as the coral they graze. They are able to separate the algae from the polyp tissues they digest. The algal cells are moved to its tentacles, where they continue to live. The otherwise defenceless slug gains both [[camouflage]] and nutrition. < ref name= " Att " > Attenborough, David. 1995. ''The private life of plants''. BBC, London. Chapter 5 Living together. < /ref > < sup > p204 < /sup >  The giant clam keeps algae in its mantle, which is revealed when the clam is open. The coloured mantle has places where the skin is transparent, and acts like a lens to concentrate light on the algae beneath. When the algae get too numerous, the clam digests them. < ref name= " Att " / > < sup > p203 < /sup > 
 
 Various other marine [[invertebrate]] groups have members which symbiose with algae. [[Flatworm]]s (Platyhelminths) and [[Polychaete]] worms (Annelids) are two such groups.
