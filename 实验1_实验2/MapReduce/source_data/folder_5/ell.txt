{{otheruses|ELL}} 
 The English [[unit of length]] '''ell''' < ref > from Proto-Indo-European *el-  " elbow, forearm < /ref >  is usually 45 [[inch]]es. That means 1.143 m (for the international inch). It came from the length of the arm from the shoulder (or the elbow) to the [[wrist]], although the exact length was never defined in English law. 
 
 Several different national forms existed, with different lengths: the Scottish ell (about 37 inches), the Flemish ell (about 27 inches) and the [[Poland|Polish]] ell (0.78 metres, about 31 inches). 
 
 This unit has mostly fallen out of use, as have others based on the human arm:  
 *[[digit (unit)|digit]] (1/60 ell) 
 *[[finger (unit)|finger]] (7/360 ell)  
 *[[palm (unit)|palm]] (1/15 ell) 
 *[[hand (unit)|hand]] (4/45 ell) 
 *[[shaftment]] (2/15 ell) 
 *[[Span (unit of length)|span]] (1/5 ell)  
 *[[cubit]] (2/5 ell) 
 
 Sometimes ''ell'' is used as an other word for the [[cubit]]. 
 
 An '''ell-wand''' or '''ellwand''' was a rod of length one ell used for official measurement.   [[Edward I of England]] ordered that every town should have one.
