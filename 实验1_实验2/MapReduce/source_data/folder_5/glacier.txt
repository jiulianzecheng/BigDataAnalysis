 A '''glacier''' is a large body of [[ice]] and [[snow]]. It forms because the snow in an area does not all melt in [[summer]]. Each [[winter]], more snow is added. The [[weight]] of all the snow creates [[pressure]]. This pressure turns the lower parts of the snow into ice. After this happens for many years, the glacier will start growing large. It becomes so heavy that [[gravity]] causes the ice to move. It flows downwards like water but very slowly. A glacier only moves about {{convert|50|m|ft}} per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away. < ref > {{cite book |first= Michael |last= Hambrey |author2= Alean, Jürg |title= Glaciers |url= https://archive.org/details/glaciers0002hamb |edition= 2nd |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-521-82808-2 |oclc= 54371738}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |first= Douglas I. |last= Benn |author2= Evans, David J.A. |title= Glaciers and glaciation |publisher= Arnold |year= 1999 |isbn= 0470236515 |oclc= 38329570 }} < /ref > 
 
 Glaciers are the largest sources of [[freshwater|fresh water]] on Earth. The largest bodies of [[salt water]] are the [[Ocean|oceans]]. 
 
 == Creation ==

 Glaciers will only form in places that are cold enough and get enough [[snow]] over time. This can take a long time. It often takes tens or hundreds of years for a glacier to form. There are two kinds of glaciers: ''continental glaciers'' and ''alpine glaciers''. Alpine glaciers are also called ''mountain glaciers''. 
 * Continental glaciers are glaciers that spread out over a large area of land.  They were created mostly during the [[Ice Age]]s a long time ago. There are still some continental glaciers in [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]]. They often flow downwards into the [[sea]] and break up. The broken parts that float in the sea are called [[iceberg]]s. 
 * Alpine glaciers form in [[mountain]] areas. They are smaller than continental glaciers. Alpine glaciers usually flow until they reach a point where the [[temperature]] is warm enough that the ice melts completely during the [[summer]]. 
 
 ==Effects== 
 Glaciers are very important. They have a large effect on the [[environment]]. They do this because they are very large and heavy. When they move, they [[erosion|erode]] mountains and land. Also, since they froze long ago, snow [[crystal]]s and air bubbles inside are kept in good condition. These can provide a large amount of information for [[scientist]]s. Recently glaciers have been melting more than they did in the past. Many scientists think this is happening because [[global warming]] is changing the [[climate]]{{needs proof|date=February 2012}}. < ref > * {{cite book

 == Appearance == 
 Glaciers are blue in color. This is because water is very good at absorbing [[light]]. Only the strongest light, with the most energy, is able to escape. Blue is the color of light that has the most energy. Because of this, blue is the only color of light that can escape without being absorbed. The thicker the glacier is, the more blue it appears.
