 The '''Bundesgerichtshof''' (''Federal Court of Justice'') (BGH) is the highest German court for civil and criminal law. It is one of the five Supreme Courts in [[Germany]]. 
 * The [[Bundesarbeitsgericht]] (Federal Labour Court), 
 * the [[Bundesfinanzhof]] (Federal Finance Court), 
 * the [[Bundessozialgericht]] (Federal Social Court) and 
 * the [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] (Federal Administrative Court) 
 
 are the other supreme courts. They only hear cases about their areas of law. There is no appeal from any of the supreme courts, unless someone's [[human rights]] are affected which is a matter for the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht]] - the Federal Constitutional Court to decide. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Palais-Bundesgerichtshof-Karlsruhe-Germany.jpg|thumb|Courthouse]] 
 [[File:Karlsruhe bundesgerichthof neu.jpg|thumb|New headquarters building]] 
 The Bundesgerichtshof was founded in 1950. Its headquarters were in the old Palace of the  " Hereditary Grand Duke "  (the ''[[heir apparent]]'') of Hesse in [[Karlsruhe]]. 
 
 Another part, the 5th criminal division is based in the ''Villa Sack'' in [[Leipzig]]. The idea was to move all of the court there after the [[German Reunification|reunification]]. The judges did not want to move so instead only the 5th criminal division was moved from Berlin to Leipzig. 
 
 The 5th division used to meet in West Berlin so that appeal cases could be heard in the city without having to take criminals across the [[DDR]]. The [[Federal Administrative Court]] moved into the Villa sack as well on August 22nd, 2002. 
 
 == Organisation == 
 The BGH is divided into  " senates " . Each Senate has a judges as chairman and four assessors. 
 
 There are 
 * twelve civil courts of appeal; 
 * five criminal courts of appeal (including the one based in Leipzig); and 
 * eight specialised senates . These deal with 
 ** Farming matters; 
 ** Advocates affairs (attorneys and lawyers); 
 ** Notary affairs; 
 ** Patent agent affairs; 
 ** Accountant affairs; 
 ** Tax consultant disputes, but not tax disputes, which are handled by the [[Federal Finance Court]] in [[Munich]]; 
 ** Cartel senate; 
 ** Matters about working for the federal government, except military service which is handled by the [[Federal Administrative Court]].
