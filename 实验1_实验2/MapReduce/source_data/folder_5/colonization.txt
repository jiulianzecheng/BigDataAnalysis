'''Colonization''' is the act of one [[country]] settling another place, in order to become the new rulers of the new country, and to live in the new country. An early example is the settlers who went from the cities of [[Ancient Greece]] to start new cities. 
 
 In [[1492]], [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in the [[Americas]]. This is how the [[Europe]]ans learned that [[North America]] and [[South America]] were there.  The Europeans colonized the Americas. Because of this, and the killing of many [[Native American]]s, most people now living in North America are the [[descendant]]s of Europeans. 
 
 Sometimes, [[science fiction]] [[story|stories]] talk about [[space colonization]] on [[space station]]s or [[planet]]s other than [[Earth]]. Some science fiction stories like [[The Matrix]] speak of the robots the human beings made, taking over, and colonizing Earth.
