 '''Silicones''' ({{IPA|/'sIlIkən/}}) are [[polymer]]s that include any inert, synthetic compound made up of repeating units of [[siloxane]]. This is a functional group of two [[silicon]] atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom frequently combined with [[carbon]] and/ or [[hydrogen]].  They are typically heat-resistant and [[rubber]]-like. Silicones are used in sealants, adhesives, lubricants, medicine, cooking utensils, and thermal and electrical insulation. Some common forms include [[silicone oil]], [[silicone grease]], [[silicone rubber]], [[silicone resin]], and [[silicone caulk]]. < ref name=Ullmann > Hans-Heinrich Moretto, Manfred Schulze, Gebhard Wagner (2005)  " Silicones "  in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'',  Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a24_057}} < /ref >  Silicone is also used for cosmetics. Silicone has very little to do with the [[element]] [[silicon]] ({{IPA|/'sIlIkən/}}). < ref > James L.
