'''Acritarchs''' are early micro[[fossil]]s, the remains, probably, of [[eukaryote]] cells. It is the resistant single-layered cell walls, or perhaps a cover secreted by cell walls, that we see in early [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] of the [[Proterozoic]] [[era]]. These structures are [[Organic chemistry|organic]] in their chemical composition, not [[calcium carbonate]]. Their precise nature is not known, but they look like the resting stages of modern [[dinoflagellate]]s (the 'red tide' organisms).

 Acritarchs appear in quantity in organic-rich [[shale]]s and [[silt]]stone [[strata]] 1.4 to 1.6 billion years old. < ref > Clarkson E.N.K. 1998. ''Invertbrate palaeontology and evolution''. Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p57 < /sup >  They include a wide range of forms, so it is not clear whether or not they are [[monophyletic]]. At about 1 billion years ago they started to increase in abundance, diversity, and especially size and number of spines. Their populations crashed during the [[Cryogenian]] period 860 million years ago (the [[Snowball Earth]] episodes). They proliferated in the [[Cambrian explosion]] and reached their highest diversity in the [[Palaeozoic]]. They survived at least until the [[Ordovician]] period. < ref name= " Levin " > Levin, Harold. 2006. ''The Earth through time''. Wiley, Hoboken N.J. < /ref > < sup > p256 < /sup > 
 
 The increased spininess possibly resulted from the need for defence against [[predator]]s large enough to swallow them or tear them apart. Other groups of small organisms from the Neo[[proterozoic]] era also show signs of [[anti-predator defences]]. < ref name= " Bengtson2002OriginsOfPredation " > {{ Citation

 == Recent discovery == 
 A recent discovery has greatly extended our knowledge of acritarchs. Large (50μm) < ref > 50 millionths of a metre < /ref >  acritarchs have been found in [[silica]]-based [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] of [[Archaean]] age in [[South Africa]]. These rocks date to 3,200 million years ago, which makes them the second oldest life to be found as [[fossil]]s. < ref > Buick R. 2010. Early life: ancient acritarchs.

PMID 20139963. < /ref >  The earliest are [[cyanobacteria]] found in [[stromatolite]]s. 
 
 The significance of this is that acritarchs are [[eukaryote]]s. This means that eukaryotes were present at least 1.5 billion years earlier than had been supposed.
