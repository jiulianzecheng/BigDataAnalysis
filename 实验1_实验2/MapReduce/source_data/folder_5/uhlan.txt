 '''Uhlan''' is the name for a type of Polish soldier of light [[cavalry]], armed with [[lance]] (a kind of spear). The respect for such Polish [[troop]]s caused that in the beginning of the 19th century great part of European armies created similar military units. In most European armies, the units of that kind took the name of lancers. In the Russian, Austrian, and German armies, the units of Polish lancers had kept the original name of Uhlans.
