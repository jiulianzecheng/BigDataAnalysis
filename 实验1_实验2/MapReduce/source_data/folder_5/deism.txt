 [[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Paine]] was a famous deist who wrote ''[[The Age of Reason]]'']] 
 '''Deism''' is the belief that a higher being (like [[God]]) exists, but that the only [[revelation]] of God is in nature and [[reason]], not in [[sacred]] books or [[prophet]]s. Deism says that people should rely on logic and reason, and not traditions of a [[religion]] that is based on a holy book. People who follow deism are called deists. 
 
 Deists believe that a Higher Power created the world. They do not believe that the creation of the universe happened because of a spontaneous event. They usually reject [[supernatural]] events like [[miracle]] < nowiki/ > s, and believe that God has set up [[natural laws]], which govern how the universe works and how people should act, and does not interfere with these laws. Most deists also see holy books, such as the [[Bible]] and [[Qur'an]], as writings made by people, rather than the writings of God. 
 
 Famous deists from history include American political leader and inventor [[Benjamin Franklin]], French conqueror [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], French philosopher [[Voltaire]], < ref name=TIME/ >  British philosopher [[Thomas Paine]], and French revolutionary leader [[Maximilien de Robespierre]]. Many historians think [[Thomas Jefferson]] was a deist, though he didn't say so.  < ref name=TIME > {{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter |agency=Time-Life Books |title=Age of Enlightenment|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofenlightenme00gayp|year=1966|publisher=Time|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ageofenlightenme00gayp/page/36 36]|chapter=A Religion of Rationality}} < /ref >
