'''Education''' is about learning [[skill]]s and [[knowledge]]. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better. < ref > Anderson, Garry  &  Arsenault, Nancy 1998.

 Through education, the knowledge of [[society]], [[country]], and of the [[world]] is passed on from [[generation]] to generation. This may include education in [[morality]], for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective [[citizen]].

 Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another.  Educated people and groups can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.

 == Types of education == 
 There are different ways to categorize education: for example, by age or subject. One way is to divide it into ''formal education'', ''non-[[formal]] education'', and ''informal education''. 
 
 '''Formal education''' is usually in [[school]], where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a [[nursery]] or [[kindergarten]] but often formal education begins in [[elementary school]] and continues with [[secondary school]]. Post-secondary education (or [[higher education]]) is usually at a [[college]] or [[university]] which may grant an [[academic degree]]. Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be [[plumber]]s, [[electricians]], [[builder]]s and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. [[Apprenticeship]] was the older way to do this, 
 
 '''Non-formal education''' includes adult basic education, adult [[literacy]] education or school equivalency preparation. In non-formal education, someone who is not in school can learn to read, write, and other basic life or job skills. [[Home education]], [[individualized instruction]] (such as [[programmed learning]]), [[distance learning]] and [[computer-assisted instruction]] are other possibilities. < ref > U.S. Department of Education, Evaluation of evidence-based practices in online learning: a meta-analysis and review of online learning studies, 2010. [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf] < /ref > 
 
 '''Informal education''' is less organized. < ref > Rogoff, Barbara; Callanan, Maureen; Gutiérrez, Kris D.; Erickson, Frederick 2016. The organization of informal learning. ''Review of Research in Education'' '''40''': 356–401. [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0091732X16680994] < /ref >  It may be a parent (like a dad or mom) teaching a child how to make a [[meal]] or ride a [[bicycle]]. People can also get an informal education by reading many [[books]] from a [[library]] or educational [[website]]s. This may also be called [[self-education]]. Some famous people have been largely self-educated, like [[Alfred Russell Wallace]]. 
 
 [[Unschooling]] is when kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings. Instead, they go on websites, play games, or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way. The experience of children with  " unstructured "  lives is that they get into trouble. < ref > {{Cite web|last=msnbc.com|date=2006-10-31|title=Readers share heated opinions on 'unschooling'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15148804/ns/health-childrens_health/t/readers-share-heated-opinions-unschooling/|access-date=2020-09-05|website=msnbc.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Deschooling]] is a more drastic approach. It advocates abolishing schools. It was put forward in the [[USA]] of the 1960s and 1970s. It is no longer an active movement. 
 
 == Schooling == 
 Many [[public school]]s (U.S. terminology) provide a free education through the [[government]]. Parents may send their own children to a [[private school]], but they must pay for it.  In some [[Poverty|poor]] places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do not make education available, or because their families do not have enough money, or because the children have to [[child labour|work for money]], or because the society has [[prejudice]] against education for [[girl]]s. 
 
 There are [[primary school]]s and [[secondary school]]s.  In many places they are government funded.  Colleges and universities usually charge [[fee]]s ([[tuition payments]]) which may be different in different countries.
