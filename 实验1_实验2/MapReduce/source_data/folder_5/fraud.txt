'''Fraud''' (or '''defrauding''' or '''scamming''') is a [[crime]] in which someone tricks somebody else to get unfair or unlawful gain. Frauds are almost always about money, either directly or indirectly.  
 
 A ''fraudster'' or a ''fraud'' is the person who commits the fraud. ''Fraudulence'' is the adjective, as in ''He tried to pass a fraudulent [[cheque]].'' To ''defraud'' someone is to commit a fraud against them.  
 
 Fraudsters may find people to defraud by phone calls, emails, or websites. Fraud often starts by saying there is a free or low price item. The fraudster then asks for personal information, such as a home [[address]] and [[bank]] account numbers. Instead of giving an item, the fraudster takes their money. Fraudsters often target [[senior citizens]]. 
 
 Fraud is a [[criminal law|criminal]] wrong: a fraudster may be prosecuted and imprisoned. It is also a [[civil law|civil]] wrong: a fraud victim may sue the fraudster to get compensation. 
 
 All societies have laws against fraud, but the details differ in each [[jurisdiction]]. In [[England]] an [[Act of Parliament]] defines three kinds of fraud. 
 #fraud by false representation,  
 #fraud by failing to disclose information, and  
 #fraud by abuse of position.  
 Lesser cases are heard in a [[Magistrates' Court]]; more serious offences are tried in the [[High Court]] ([[jury]] proceedings).
