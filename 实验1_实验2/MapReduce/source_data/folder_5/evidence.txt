 '''Evidence''' is something that is used to support an [[argument]].  It gives examples of why something is [[truth|true]].  
 
 '''Evidence''' is defined by Merriam-Webster dictionary as:  
 1a : an outward sign : [[INDICATION]] 
 1b : something that furnishes proof : [[TESTIMONY]] 
 specifically: something legally submitted to a tribunal to ascertain the truth of a matter 
 2 : one who bears witness 
 especially: one who voluntarily confesses a crime and testifies for the prosecution against one's accomplices 
 
 Choo states “Evidence is the information with which the matters requiring proof in a trial are proved.” The study of evidence, therefore, is the study of the process by which such matters are proved in court.” (Choo, 42).  
 
 Peter Achinstein defines evidence as “information that increases probability of a hypothesis” or “information on the basis of which a hypothesis has high probability.” (Achinstein, 44). 
 
 The Division of Extension Research and Training at the University of Arkansas defines evidence as “the outward sign, the indication, the proof” (University of Arkansas, 1). 
 
 For example, if someone come across a [[cup]] of spilled [[milk]], that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If [[hair]]s of a [[cat]] and paw [[wikt:print|prints]] were found on the [[ground]], they could be evidence that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk. If a [[witness]] saw the cat spilling the milk, her [[testimony]] would also be evidence.
