'''Biosynthesis''' is the production of complex [[molecule]]s within living organisms or cells. Biosynthesis takes simple molecules and turns them into bigger molecules. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Biosynthesis happens because of [[chemical reaction]]s. Biosynthesis needs these things to happen: < ref name= " isbn0-8153-3218-1 " > {{cite book | author = Alberts, Bruce | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0815341055|edition=5th}} < /ref > 
 *[[Reagent|Precursor molecules]]: Precursor molecules are the starting molecules in biosynthesis. 
 *[[Chemical energy]]: Energy is needed to turn the precursor molecules into the result. 
 *Catalytic [[enzymes]]: Enzymes help the reactions go faster. Enzymes also lower the energy needed. 
 *[[Coenzymes]]: Coenzymes help the chemical reactions.
