 '''Mozzarella''' is a kind of  fresh [[cheese]]. Originally, it was [[Italy|Italian]] but now it can be found all over the world. Its made of the milk of [[cows]] or [[water buffalo]]s. A cheese produced in a similar way, but with [[sheep]]'s milk is common in [[Sardinia]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Lazio]]. It is sometimes called [[mozzapecora]]. Mozzarella made with [[Domestic goat|goats]] milk can also be found. Its development is more recent, though. The main reason it is produced is that goats' milk is easier to [[Digestion|digest]] than that of cows or buffalos. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/food/dettaglio/ecco-il-fior-di-latte-di-capra/2221355.html?refresh_ce |title=article in 'L'Espresso' |access-date=2018-05-20 |archive-date=2018-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614095442/http://espresso.repubblica.it/food/dettaglio/ecco-il-fior-di-latte-di-capra/2221355.html?refresh_ce |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
