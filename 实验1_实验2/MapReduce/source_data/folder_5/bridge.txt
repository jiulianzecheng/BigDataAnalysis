 A '''bridge''' is a [[structure]] to cross an open space or gap.  Bridges are mostly made for crossing [[river]]s, [[valley]]s, or [[road]]s.  Nowadays most big bridges are made to carry [[vehicle]]s but people have also walked across bridges for thousands of years.  Bridges called [[highway]] overpasses carry a road over another road.  
 
 [[Military]] bridges are [[portable]], so that they may be easily moved to where they are needed.  This makes them much more [[complex]] than most [[civilian]] bridges.  
 
 The first man-made bridges were probably made from cut wood or stones. Some stone bridges have lasted thousands of years. In recent centuries large bridges are made mostly of [[steel]]. They do not last as long. Many bridges are in a state of disrepair. < ref > https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-11-22-bridges22_ST_N.htm < /ref >
