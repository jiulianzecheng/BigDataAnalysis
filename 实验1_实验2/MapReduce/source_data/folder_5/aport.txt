'''Aport''' is a variety of [[apple]] that is grown in Russia and some other countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].  It is over 150 years old.  After being brought to the Alatau Mountain area of [[Kazakhstan]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century, it was modified to its current state due to the different soil and altitude. The apples weigh between 200 and 500 grams. The skin is a light green and red color. The meat has a crisp, medium density. The apples are sweet. The aport is a fall-ripening fruit.
