 '''Phencyclidine''' (a shortened version of the chemical name ''phenylcyclohexylpiperidine''), usually called '''PCP''', is an [[illegal drug]]. PCP is called a [[hallucinogen]]ic drug: it causes people to [[hallucination|hallucinate]], and see, hear, and sense things that are not real. PCP is [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]]. It causes changes to the [[brain]] that can leave [[Brain damage|permanent damage]]. Before people started using PCP as an illegal drug, it was used as an [[anesthesia|anesthetic]]. < ref > Malenka R.C; Nestler E.J.  &  Hyman S.E. 2009.

 PCP is a white powder, made of tiny [[crystal]]s. It dissolves easily in water or [[alcohol]]. PCP has many [[slang]] or 'street names'; the most common is  " angel dust " . Other slang names for PCP are angel hair, angel mist, aurora borealis, black whack, crystal, cyclones, devil dust, dummy dust, embalming fluid, hallucinogen, horse tranquilizer, jet fuel, magic dust, rocket fuel, or star dust. PCP is sometimes mixed with [[marijuana]] and called love boat or killer weed. PCP can also be mixed with [[crack]]; this is called  " space basing " . [[Cigarette]]s can also be dipped in PCP; this is called a sherm. 
 
 == History == 
 PCP was created after [[World War II]] as a [[surgery|surgical]] anesthetic. It worked well, but there were serious side effects: hallucinations, jumbled speech, and [[delirium]]. Around the mid-to-late 1960s, the drug sprang up on the streets of [[San Francisco]] as a  " Peace Pill. "  People soon realized that it was a very dangerous drug. In the San Francisco area, the use of PCP died out before the 1970s. At the same time, the drug was becoming more common in [[New York (state)|New York]], and it spread quickly there. However, its use in this area died out, like in San Francisco. The United States made it illegal to use PCP for any reason, or to make the drug, because of its serious effects. 
 
 == Effects == 
 People can have many different effects from using PCP. The drug can affect the [[central nervous system]] (the brain and major [[nerve]]s).  This can cause many changes in the brain and body. 
 
 === Changes in feeling and thinking === 
 * [[Euphoria]] (feeling very happy) 
 * Loss of inhibitions which normally keep people from doing things that are dangerous or inappropriate 
 * [[Anxiety]] or [[paranoia]] (feeling very worried or scared) 
 * Feeling disoriented: a person is [[Mental confusion|confused]] and may not know who they are, where they are, or what is happening 
 * Thinking problems: the person is not able to think clearly, and when they talk they may not make sense 
 * Feeling dissociated: disconnected with the people and things going on around them 
 
 === Changes in senses === 
 PCP often causes major changes in what a person [[Sensory system|senses]] (what he feels, sees, hears, smells, or tastes).  For example: 
 * Feeling weightless (the person feels like he [[Weight|weighs]] nothing and is floating) 
 * Auditory hallucinations (hearing things that are not there) 
 * Visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there) 
 
 === Changes in the body === 
 * Feeling restless 
 * [[Fatigue|Feeling tired]] 
 * [[Tachycardia]] (high [[heart rate]]) 
 * [[Hypertension]] (high [[blood pressure]]) 
 * Excess [[Salivary gland|salivation]] (where the body makes more [[saliva]], or spit, than usual) 
 * [[Sweat]]ing 
 * [[Paresthesia|Numbness]] 
 * Staggering (not being able to walk straight) 
 * Being unable to speak clearly 
 * [[Fever]] 
 * [[Muscular system|Muscle]] rigidity (where the muscles become very stiff).  
 PCP can also cause people to have a lot of energy, feel and act stronger than usual, and not feel pain. 
 
 == How the drug is used == 
 PCP can be eaten, snorted, [[Injection|injected]] (shot into the body using a needle), or smoked. A person can take a low, medium, or high dose of PCP, and he will have different effects depending on which dose he takes. Low doses can cause a person to feel euphoric (very happy), relaxed, numb, detached from his own body, anxious, or confused. At low doses, people can also have sensory distortions (changes in how they hear, see, taste, smell, or feel things); [[amnesia]] (where the person cannot remember things normally); speech which does not make sense; blurred vision; or a blank stare. Medium doses can cause confusion, agitation, analgesia (not feeling pain), fever, excessive salivation, and  " [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]-type "  behavior. High doses can cause [[seizure]]s, respiratory failure (where the breathing systems in the body stop working), [[coma]], [[fever]], [[stroke]], or death. 
 
 == Addiction == 
 People who use PCP can get physically or psychologically (mentally) [[addiction|addicted]] to the drug. If an addicted person suddenly stops taking PCP, he will get withdrawal symptoms, like [[diarrhea]], chills, and tremors (uncontrollable shaking in part of the body). In the brain, PCP affects multiple [[neurotransmitter]] systems. (Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain.) For example, it keeps the brain from getting rid of extra [[dopamine]], norepinephrine, and [[serotonin]]. These are all very important neurotransmitters in the brain. PCP can also affect some types of [[opioid]] receptors in the brain. It also inhibits (or blocks) the action of [[glutamate]] by blocking NMDA (N-methyl d-aspartate) receptors. Prescription drugs like [[diazepam]] (Valium), haloperidol (Haldol), and phentolamine may be used to help manage some of PCP's effects.
