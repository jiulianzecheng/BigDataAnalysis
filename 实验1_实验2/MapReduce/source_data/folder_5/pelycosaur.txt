 '''Pelycosaurs''' (meaning  " basin lizards " ) were the earliest [[synapsid]]s. They were not [[dinosaurs]] or [[reptile]]s. They are an informal group which were once called the  " mammal-like reptiles " .  
 The term is only used informally, if at all, in the modern scientific literature. 
 
 These [[tetrapod]]s appeared during the [[Pennsylvanian]] and went extinct at the end of the [[Permian]] period. They were the dominant land animals for some 40 million years, and were almost wiped out by the [[P/Tr extinction event]]. A few survived until the lower [[Triassic]] to form the [[therapsid]]s. The therapsids led to the [[mammal]]s.  
 
 Because the term  " Pelycosaur "  does not include their descendants, it is not used much now. < ref >  Botha-Brink J. and Modesto S.P. 2007. A mixed-age classed 'pelycosaur' aggregation from South Africa: earliest evidence of parental care in amniotes? ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'', '''274'''(1627): 2829–2834.

 The most notable of these land animals was ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', the top predator of its time. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Pelycosaur fossils have been found mainly in [[Europe]] and [[North America]], although some small, late-surviving forms are known from [[Russia]] and [[South Africa]]. 
 
 At least two pelycosaur [[clade]]s independently evolved a tall sail of elongated vertebral spines. In life, this would have been covered by skin, and possibly was a [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] device and/or a mating display.  
 Unlike [[lepidosauria]]n reptiles, pelycosaurs lacked epidermal [[Scale (zoology)|scale]]s.  
 
 In 1940 the group was reviewed in detail and every species known at the time described (and many illustrated) in an important monograph. Well-known pelycosaurs include the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', ''[[Sphenacodon]]'', ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'', and ''[[Ophiacodon]]''.
