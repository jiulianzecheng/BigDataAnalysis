 The term 'metic' was especially used in ancient [[Athens]] in the 4th and 5th centuries BC. A notable metic was [[Aristotle]], who was born in [[Stageira]] but lived in Athens for a long time. 
 
 Regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in [[Attica]], whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption. 
 
 Metics shared the burdens of [[citizenship]] without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform [[military service]] and, if rich enough, were subject to special [[tax]] contributions. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of  " equal rights "  (''isoteleia'') under which they were freed from the usual liabilities. 
 
 The system came to an end in [[Hellenistic Athens]], when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves in Attica. 
 
 In the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a [[polis]] were called  " paroikoi "   (see etymology of [[:wiktionary:parish|parish]]), in Asia Minor  " katoikoi " . < ref > Wilson, Nigel Guy 2006.
