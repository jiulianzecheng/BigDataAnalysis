'''Syncytium''' is a living [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] where there are no  complete [[cell wall]]s (plants) or [[cell membrane]]s (animals). Syncytia have [[cytoplasm]] and many [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], but are not divided into separate [[cells]]. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006.

 == Examples == 
 *[[Fungus|Fungal hyphae]] are often syncytia. 
 *[[Lichen]] tissue may be syncytia with enclosed [[alga]]l or [[bacteria]]l cells. 
 *Many [[insect]] eggs develop by [[mitosis|nuclear division]] without cell membranes. 
 *Skeletal [[muscles]] in [[vertebrate]]s are syncytia: it allows rapid coordinated contraction of muscles along their entire length. 
 *The [[placenta]] of [[mammal]]s is a syncytium.
