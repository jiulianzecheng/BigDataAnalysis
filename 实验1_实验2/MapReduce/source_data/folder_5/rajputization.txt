The rajputs are a [[caste]] in the Indian caste system.  They consisted of a mix of various different social groups and different varnas (in the [[Dharma]] system, the (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishya and Shudras) including and tribes.  '''Rajputization''' explains how such diverse communities merged into the Rajput community. < ref name= " Chandra2008 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XYMAQAAMAAJ|title=Social Change and Development in Medieval Indian History|author=Satish Chandra|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=2008|page=44|isbn=9788124113868 |quote=Modern historians are more or less agreed that the Rajputs consisted of miscellaneous groups including shudras and tribals}} < /ref > < ref name= " BhatnagarDube2012 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK6_l2_TCfgC|title=Female Infanticide in India: A Feminist Cultural History|author1=Rashmi Dube Bhatnagar|author2=Reena Dube|date=1 February 2012|publisher=State University of New York(SUNY) Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8385-5|pages=59,62,63,257|quote=(62,63)We have culled from the sociological literature, particularly from Srivinas's analysis of Sanskritization, the key differences between the two modes of upward mobility, Sanskritization and Rajputization. Despite the excellent fieldwork on Rajputization by Sinha (1962) and Kulke(1976), there is no clear theoretical definition of the key features of Rajputization, and its differences and similarities to Sanskritization. We argue that theorizing is as important as fieldwork, principally because of the colonial misreading of the term Rajput and its relation to Rajput history and to Rajputization. As a corrective we demarcate the distinction between Sanskritization and Rajputization in terms of attributional criteria - which denotes a code of living, dietary prohibition, modes of worship-and social interactional criteria, which signify the rules of marriage, rules pertaining to women, and modes of power. The attributional criteria for Sanskritization are vegetarianism, prohibition against beef eating, teetotalism, and wearing the sacred thread; the attributional criteria for Rajputized men consists of meat-eating, imbibing alcohol and opium, and the wearing of the sword; the attributional criteria for Rajputized women are seclusion through purdah or the veil and elaborate rules for women's mobility within the village. The religious code for Sanskritization is a belief in the doctrine of karma, dharma, rebirth and moksha and the Sradda ceremony for male ancestors. Conversely, the religious code for Rajputization consists of the worship of Mahadeo and Sakto and the Patronage of Brahmins through personal family priests(historically the Rajputized rulers gave land grants to Brahmins) and the priestly supervision of rites of passage. The social interactional criteria for Sanskritization is claiming the right to all priestly intellectual and cultural vocations, patronage from the dominant political power, and prohibition against widow remarriage. The interactional criteria for Rajputization consists of claiming the right to all military and political occupations, the right to govern, the right to aggrandize lands through wars, sanctioned aggressive behavior, the adoption of the code for violence, compiling clan genealogies and the right to coercively police the interactions between castes.}} < /ref >

 ==Rajputization of Chandelas, Gaharwars, Bundelas and Rathors== 
 The [[Rajput|Chandel Rajputs]] were originally Hinduised [[Bhar|Bhars]] or [[Gond|Gonds]] or both. When they became politically powerful, they became  [[Kshatriya|Kshatriyas]] or [[Rajput|Rajputs]].
