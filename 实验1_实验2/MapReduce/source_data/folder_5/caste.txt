[[File:Indian Caste System.jpg|thumb|349x349px]] 
 The caste system is a system in [[India]] that was once mainly used by [[Hindu|Hindus]]. This system has been generally accepted for about 3000 years. There are four castes in this system, and one outcast group regarded as  " untouchables " . There are also castes in countries other than India as the system spread to South Asia about 2000 years ago. For centuries, this system has dictated one's marriages, geographical location, and occupation. People must not marry someone from another caste, and they must not do things that another caste does. The Indian government today works to decrease this discrimination with the quotas set in government jobs in 1950.
