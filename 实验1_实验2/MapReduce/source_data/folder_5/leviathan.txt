 '''Leviathan''' ({{lang-he|לִוְיָתָן}},  " twisted, coiled " ), is a [[monster]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. In [[Satanism]] Leviathan is believed to be one of the princes of [[Hell]]. The word has become synonymous with any large sea monster or creature. In classical literature (such as the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'') it refers to great whales, and in Modern Hebrew, it means simply  " [[whale]]. "
