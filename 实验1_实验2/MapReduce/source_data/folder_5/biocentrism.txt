'''Biocentrism''' is a [[theory]] given by the [[Americans|American]] [[biologist]] Robert Lanza which states that nothing is [[absolute]] in the [[universe]]. It says that the universe exists relative to us and can't exist without [[living beings]]. It says that [[space]] and [[time]] are just our perceptions. There is no real existence of anything outside us. This theory can be considered a [[theory of everything]]. [[Young's double-slit experiment]] supports this theory.
