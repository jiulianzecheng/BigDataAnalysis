 '''Vestmannaeyjar''' (sometimes called the '''Westman Islands''') is a town and [[archipelago]] off the south coast of [[Iceland]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.icelandtouristboard.com/index.php?page=westman-islands |title=Westman Islands |publisher=Icelandic Tourist Board |access-date=13 April 2014 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032537/http://www.icelandtouristboard.com/index.php?page=westman-islands |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The largest island, Heimaey, has a population of 4,135. The other islands are uninhabited. 
 
 The town was evacuated in 1973 because of the [[Eldfell]] eruption. The eruption destroyed one fifth of the town before the lava flow was stopped by putting 1.5 billion gallons (6.8 billion litres) of cold water on it. < ref name=kate > {{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29136747|title=How do you stop the flow of lava?|author=Taylor Kate Brown|work=BBC news|date=11 September 2014|access-date=14 September 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 == History and name == 
 [[File:Oluf Eigilsson Murat Reis 1627-1628.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of Ólafur Egilsson's book.]] 
 The islands are named after the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] slaves who had been captured by the [[Norsemen]]. The [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] word, ''Vestmenn'' (meaning Westmen), was applied to the slaves and was retained in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. 
 
 After [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] first arrived in Iceland, his brother [[Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson]] was murdered by the Gaelic slaves. In response, he tracked the slaves down to the islands are murdered all of them, hence the name Vestmannaeyjar (the islands of the west men). 
 
 On 16 July 1627, the islands were captured by a group of [[North Africa]]n [[pirates]] who stayed there until 19 July. They were under control of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The pirates captured 234 people from the islands and took them on a 27-day voyage to [[Algiers]], where most of them spent their life under bondage. < ref > [http://visindavefur.is/?id=5743 „Hvað gerðist í Tyrkjaráninu? " . Vísindavefurinn, retrieved on 26 February 2012.] (In Icelandic.) < /ref >  One of the prisoners, minister Ólafur Egilsson, returned in 1628 to the islands and wrote a book about his experience. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://reisubok.net/Foreword/default.aspx |title=The Travels of Reverend Ólafur Egilsson |publisher=Reisubok.net |access-date=13 April 2014 |archive-date=6 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106021203/http://reisubok.net/Foreword/default.aspx |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In 1636, a ransom was paid for 34 of the captives, and most of them returned to Iceland. After this, a fort was built on the [[Helgafell (volcano)|Helgafell]] volcano to keep watch for ships. 
 
 For centuries, the people who lived on the islands survived from [[fishing]] and eating birds and their eggs. At the end of the 19th century, the lifestyle of the islanders greatly improved. In 1904, the first motorised boat was purchased, and more followed soon afterwards. By 1930, the population had risen from 600 in 1900 to 3,470. The islands have since been known for being a great fishing and sea processing developer. 
 
 In 2000, the [[Norway|Norwegian government]] gifted Iceland with the Heimaey stave church. This was to celebrate the conversion of Iceland to [[Christianity]] a thousand years earlier. < ref > Paul Torvik Nilsen, 'Colourful Middle Ages', ''Tell'us: Science in Norway'' (December 2001), 6-9. < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 The Vestmannaeyjar archipelago is geologically young. They have been formed by eruptions over the past 10,000–12,000 years. The volcanic system is made up of 70–80 volcanoes. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/volc_westman_islands.htm |title=VESTMANNAEYJAR: Volcanic Activity |publisher=Nordic Adventure Travel |access-date=21 January 2014 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200034/http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/volc_westman_islands.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 *the islands Hani, Hæna, Hrauney and Grasleysa are called ''Smáeyjar'' (small islands). 
 
 Total: 16.3 square kilometres (6.3 sq mi) 
 
 There are a total of 15 islands, and about 30 rock stacks and [[Skerry|skerries]]. All islands were formed from underwater eruptions and are made up of [[palagonite]] [[tuff]] and [[lava]]. The oldest island is Heimaey ( " Home Island " ). [[Basalt|Basalt columns]] can be seen in many places, along with [[cove]]s caused by soft rock [[erosion]]. 
 
 The Eldfell eruption caused Heimaey to grow by about 2.1 square kilometres (0.81 sq mi). The highest point in Vestmannaeyjar is at around 900 feet on the Heimaey island. 
 
 == Biodiversity == 
 [[File:Papageitaucher Fratercula arctica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The puffin.]] 
 There is little snow in Vestmannaeyjar, but plenty of rain. Because of this, migrating birds are often seen in spring and leave during autumn. All of Iceland's seabirds can be found in Vestmannaeyjar: the [[guillemot]], [[gannet]], [[kittiwake]], [[Iceland gull]], and [[puffin]]. The puffin is the Vestmannaeyjar emblem, and can be seen all around the island. 
 
 There are about 150 [[plant]] species on the island, along with 80 types of [[insect]]s. The waters around the island have some of the North Atlantic's richest fishing grounds. The two main commercially used fish in Iceland, the [[cod]] and [[haddock]], are found in great amounts near the island. Other types of fish near the islands include [[flatfish]], [[herring]], [[capelin]], [[lobsters]] and ocean [[perch]]. [[Pinniped|Seals]], small types of [[whale]]s and other marine species are also present in large numbers around the islands. 
 
 == Climate == 
 
 The islands receive a lot of rain considering its latitude. Vestmannaeyjar has a [[tundra]] climate (closely bordering the subpolar [[oceanic climate]]) under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. There is a lot of wind on the islands. The highest wind speed recorded in Iceland (61 metres per second;140 & nbsp;mph) was recorded at the southern point of the Heimaey island. However, the island enjoys the highest annual temperature in Iceland.
