 {{wiktionary}} 
 A '''spoon''' is a tool for eating. It is usually used for eating foods that are like [[liquid]]s (like [[soup]] and [[yogurt]]), and it can also be used for [[wikt:stir|stirring]]. Humans use spoons every day. Some solids (like [[cereal]] and [[ice cream]]) are also usually eaten with spoons. A ladle is a bigger type of serving spoon used for [[soup]], [[stew]], or other foods. 
 
 There are many different types of spoons. There are dessert spoons, soup spoons, baby spoons, teaspoons, tablespoons and others. There are also spoons that are collector items and are worth a lot of [[money]]. Some musicians even use two spoons as a [[musical instrument]] like a [[castanet]]. 
 
 Spoons have been used as tools for eating since [[Paleolithic]] times. Prehistoric peoples probably used shells, or small pieces of wood as spoons. Both the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] words for spoon come from the word ''cochlea'', which is a spiral-shaped  snail shell. The [[Anglo-Saxon]] word ''spoon'', means a chip or splinter of wood. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalityguild.com/History/history_of_the_spoon.htm|title=The History of the Spoons|language=English|accessdate=2009-11-14|archive-date=2014-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111191440/http://www.hospitalityguild.com/History/history_of_the_spoon.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
