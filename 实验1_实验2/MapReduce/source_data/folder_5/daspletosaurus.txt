 '''''Daspletosaurus''''' ( " frightful lizard " ) was a [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurid]] [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that was 26-33 feet (8-10 m) long and weighed perhaps 2-3 tons (3000 kg).  
 
 It had tiny horns behind its eyes and its arms were a bit longer than those of ''[[T. rex]]''. It may have been an ancestor of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. This bipedal [[meat]]-eater lived in [[marsh]]es by [[stream]]s in what is now [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period, 76-72 million years ago. It may have preyed upon [[Triceratops]]. It was named by D.A. Russell in 1970. The type species is ''D. torosus''.
