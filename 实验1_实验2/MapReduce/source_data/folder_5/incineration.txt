 '''Incineration''' is a form of [[waste disposal]] in which waste is burnt. Incineration converts the waste into [[ash]], [[flue gas]], and [[heat]]. The heat can be used to generate [[electricity]] with a [[steam turbine]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first incinerators for waste disposal were built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott  &  Co. Ltd.]] in 1874. They were originally known as '''destructors'''. < ref > {{cite web | title = Centenary History of Waste and Waste Managers in London and South East England | first = Lewis | last = Herbert | publisher = Chartered Institution of Wastes Management | year = 2007 | url = http://ciwm.activedition.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=1094 & sID=469 | format = PDF }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The first incinerator in the US was built in 1885 on [[Governors Island]] in New York, NY. < ref > {{cite web|title=Energy Recovery - Basic Information|publisher=US EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/wte/basic.htm}} < /ref >
