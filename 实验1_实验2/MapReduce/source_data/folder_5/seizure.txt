 A '''convulsion''' or '''seizure''' happens when the body [[muscles]] contract and relax rapidly and repeatedly, resulting in uncontrolled shaking. < ref name= " MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200 " > {{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003200|Seizures}} < /ref >  Because [[epileptic seizure]]s typically include convulsions, the term ''convulsion'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''seizure''. < ref name= " MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200 "  / >  However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions, and not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. < ref name= " MedlinePlusEncyclopedia003200 "  / >   
 
 A seizure happens when the [[Neuron|nerves]] in a person's [[brain]] act strangely.  [[Nerve]]s send [[information]], partly through electrical signals.  Usually, nerves in the brain (called [[neuron]]s) do not fire at the same time.  During a seizure, groups of nerves start firing together, too fast. < ref > {{cite book|last=Somjen|first=George G.|title=Ions in the Brain Normal Function, Seizures, and Stroke.|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780198034599|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjSoQVt-taYC & pg=PA167}} < /ref >   This causes there to be too much disorganized electrical activity in the brain. 
 
 Most people think a person with a seizure will shake and twitch.  Some will, but there are also other kinds of seizures. < ref name= " WHO2012 " > {{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs999/en/ | title = Epilepsy | series = Fact Sheets |date =October 2012 | accessdate = January 24, 2013 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]]}} < /ref > 
 
 == Types of Seizures == 
 There are many different types of seizures. They are named by how much of the [[brain]] they affect and what happens to the person when they are having that type of seizure. 
 
 === Partial seizures === 
 In partial seizures, only a small part of the brain is involved in the seizure. These seizures can be more specifically called: 
 *Simple partial: The person stays awake the whole time the seizure is happening.  They may twitch (especially in just one part of their body), feel dizzy, or [[Aura (symptom)|smell and taste things that are not there]]. 
 *Complex partial: The person  " zones out "  during the seizure and may seem [[Mental confusion|confused]], experience [[deja vu]], laugh, feel afraid, see things that are not there, or smell something bad.  The person may also do something over and over again, like button and rebutton a shirt. 
 
 === Generalized seizures === 
 In generalized seizures, a larger part of the brain is involved in the seizure.  Often, parts of both [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres]] (halves of the brain) are affected. These seizures can be more specifically called: 
 *Tonic-clonic - The person [[Syncope|faints]], and starts having involuntary jerking motions. They may bite their tongue, scream, drool, [[urinate]] or [[defecate]]. Many people with this kind of seizures have a  " strange feeling "  before the seizure. This feeling is called ''[[Aura (symptom)|aura]]''. Tonic-clonic seizures can last up to 20 minutes. 
 *Absence - People having absence seizures often look like they are just  " spaced out. "   They do not fall to the ground or have jerking movements, but they do not seem to hear or notice anything around them.  Other people may not notice that the person is having a seizure at all. The person may simply freeze in place and pick up where they left off when the seizure is over. The person having the seizure usually does not remember it afterward. This kind of seizure only lasts up to 10 seconds. 
 *Myoclonic - A myoclonic jerk is a sudden jerking motion, usually on both sides of the body. This kind of seizure is most common in children under 5.   Myoclonic seizures can be seen in adults, who tend of have myoclonic jerks when they are falling asleep or already asleep.  Children can have these myoclonic jerks while awake. 
 
 ==== Status epilepticus: A medical emergency ==== 
 {{Main|Status epilepticus}} 
 
 ''Status epilepticus'' is a [[medical emergency]].  A person is  " in status "  when: < ref name= " Status " > {{cite web|last1=Schachter, MD|first1=Steven C.|last2=Shafer|first2=Patricia O.|last3=Sirven|first3=Joseph I.|date=August 2013|title=Status epilepticus|url=http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/impact/seizure-emergencies/status-epilepticus|website=www.epilepsy.com|publisher=|quote=|accessdate=December 26, 2015}} < /ref > 
 * They have a seizure that lasts more than five minutes; OR 
 * They have more than one seizure without recovering in between. 
 Status epilepticus is a medical emergency because the brain will not get enough [[oxygen]] during a long seizure.  This can cause [[brain damage]] or [[death]]. < ref name= " Status "  / > 
 
 == What Causes Seizures? == 
 Certain types of seizures point to a disorder called [[epilepsy]], where the nerves do not work as they should. They carry the wrong messages to the brain so that the person moves uncontrollably or sees, hears, smells, feels, or tastes things that are not there. Medicine can be taken to prevent this from happening. 
 
 Other than epilepsy, many other things can cause seizures. 
 
 ===Illnesses=== 
 [[Disease]]s that can cause seizures include: < ref name= " Medline " > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm |title=Seizures |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=February 3, 2015 |website=www.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 *[[Infection]]s in the brain, like [[meningitis]] (infection of the brain's lining) or [[encephalitis]] 
 *[[Fever]] 
 **This usually only causes seizures in children from 3 months to 6 years old. < ref name= " febrile " > {{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/sick/febrile.html |title=Febrile Seizures |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=September 2015 |website=KidsHealth.org |publisher= |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |quote=}} < /ref >   Seizures that are caused by fever are called ''febrile seizures''.  Children usually grow out of them. < ref name= " febrile "  / >   However, an adult can have a seizure from a very high fever. 
 *[[Brain tumor]] 
 *Very [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] 
 *[[Stroke]] < ref name= " NINDS " > {{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anoxia/anoxia.htm |title=NINDS Cerebral Hypoxia Information Page |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=September 10, 2015 |website=www.ninds.nih.gov |publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health |accessdate=December 25, 2015 |quote= |archive-date=May 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505220610/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anoxia/anoxia.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 *Very low blood [[glucose|sugar]] levels ([[hypoglycemia]]) 
 
 ===Drugs and alcohol=== 
 Drugs and alcohol can cause seizures: < ref name= " Triggers " > {{cite web|last1=Schachter|first1=Steven C.|last2=Shafer|first2=Patricia O.|date=August 2013|title=Triggers of Seizures|url=http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/triggers-seizures|website=www.epilepsy.com|publisher=The Epilepsy Foundation|quote=|accessdate=December 25, 2015}} < /ref > 
 *Certain types of medicines or [[Illegal drugs|drugs]], or [[drug withdrawal]] (suddenly not taking a medicine or drug any more) < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-12-17|title=What to Do If You Have a Seizure During Detox|url=https://www.addictionhelper.com/treatment-rehab/detox-withdrawal/what-to-do-if-you-have-a-seizure-during-detox/|access-date=2021-01-30|website=Addiction Helper|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 **This includes suddenly not taking [[Anticonvulsant|anti-seizure medicines]] (medicines that are supposed to prevent seizures) 
 *Drinking too much [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] 
 *[[Overdose|Overdosing]] on [[stimulant]] drugs like [[methamphetamine]] or [[cocaine]] 
 *[[Alcohol withdrawal]] (when a person who normally drinks a lot suddenly stops drinking) < ref name= " DT " > {{cite journal |last=Schuckit, M.D |first=Marc A. |date=November 27, 2014 |title=Recognition and Management of Withdrawal Delirium (Delirium Tremens) |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1407298 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=371 |issue= 22|pages=2109â€“2113 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1407298 |pmid=25427113 |s2cid=205116954 |accessdate=December 13, 2015}} < /ref > 
 **In the worst cases, this can cause a medical emergency called [[delirium tremens]], which can cause status epilepticus < ref name= " DT "  / > 
 
 ===Other causes=== 
 Other things that can cause seizures include: < ref name= " Medline "  / > 
 *[[Injury|Injuries]] to the head or brain 
 *Anything that causes the brain to [[Hypoxia|not get enough oxygen]], like [[drowning]], being [[Strangling|strangled]], having a very bad [[asthma]] attack, [[Cardiac arrest|having the heart stop]], or [[smoke]] inhalation (breathing in too much smoke from a [[fire]]) < ref name= " NINDS "  / > 
 *[[Heat stroke]] (a medical emergency that happens when the body and brain get very hot) 
 
 == Possible first aid == 
 Most seizures only last a short time. The best thing to do is to prevent the person with the seizure from hurting themselves. During a seizure, [[Reflex|reflexes]] do not work, and the people with the seizure do not have control over their muscles.
