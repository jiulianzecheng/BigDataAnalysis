 '''Microapartment''' is the name for a small [[Apartment|apartment]]. Usually, it is between {{Convert|14|m2}} and {{Convert|32|m2}} in size. Usually, there is one room, with a [[bathroom]], and a small [[kitchen]]. Unlike a [[studio flat|studio]] appartment, where the kitchen, and bathroom are in  the apartment, there are also cases where several microapartments share a kitchen or a bathroom.  
 
 Microapartments are popular in large [[Urban area|urban]] centers, where rent is high. They developed from [[Apartment hotel|apartment hotels]], which were for business trips, at the start.
