 '''''Sauroposeidon''''' is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] found in [[Oklahoma]]. It is one of the biggest dinosaur yet found. 
 
 == Habit and diet == 
 Sauroposeidon lived in what was then a [[river delta]] flowing into a bay rather the [[Bay of Mexico]] is today. It was a [[plant]]-eater that probably ate from the tops of trees, probably mainly [[Conifer|conifers]], and [[Arecaceae|palms]]. 
 
 == Estimations == 
 Estimates of ''Sauroposeidon'''s size are based on a comparison between the four ''Sauroposeidon'' vertebrae and the vertebrae of the HM SII specimen of ''[[Giraffatitan]]'' in the [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Humboldt Museum]] in [[Berlin]]. The HM SII is the most complete [[brachiosaur]] known. Comparisons to the other relatives of ''Sauroposeidon'' are difficult due to limited remains. < ref name=Wedeletal2000b >  Wedel, Mathew J; Cifelli R.L. and Sanders R..K. 2000. Osteology, paleobiology, and relationships of the sauropod dinosaur Sauroposeidon. ''Acta Palaeontologica Polonica'' '''45''': 343–3888. < /ref > 
 
 The neck length of ''Sauroposeidon'' is estimated at {{convert|11.25|-|12|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, compared to a neck length of {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} for the HM SII ''Giraffatitan''. This is based on the assumption that the rest of the neck has the same proportions as ''Giraffatitan'', which is a reasonably good conjecture. < ref name=Wedeletal2000b/ > 
 
 ''Sauroposeidon'' was probably able to raise its head {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground, which is as high as a six-story building. In comparison, ''[[Giraffatitan]]'' could probably raise its head {{convert|13.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} into the air. < ref name=Wedeletal2000b/ > 
 
 ''Sauroposeidon's'' shoulder height has been estimated at {{convert|6|-|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} based on an interpretation of the animal as a [[brachiosaur|brachiosaurid]]. Estimates of its total possible length have ranged from {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}}. < ref > Wedel, Mathew J  &  Cifelli, Richard L. 2005.

 == Timing == 
 The fossils were found in rocks dating from near the end of the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian–early Albian), from about 113 to 110 million years ago.  ''Sauroposeidon'' was the last known North American sauropod before an absence on the continent of about 40 million years. The absence of sauropods ended with the appearance of ''[[Alamosaurus]]'' during the last (Maastrichtian) stage at the end of the Cretaceous.
