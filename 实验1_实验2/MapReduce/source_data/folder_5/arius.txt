 '''Arius''' (born around 260, died 336 in [[Constantinople]]) was an early [[Christianity|Christian]] thinker. He lived in [[Alexandria]], but was probably born in [[Ancient Libya|Libya]].  He did not agree with his [[bishop]] [[Bishop Alexander|Alexander]] who said that [[Jesus]] and [[God]] were the same. Arius said [[Jesus]] and [[God]] were not the same since there was a time when Jesus did not exist.  
 
 At the [[First Council of Nicea]], most bishops did not vote with Arius; the official document says that God the Father and Jesus the Son were of the same essence, and therefore the same being.  They voted that Jesus and God had existed together for all time.
