'''Pseudorandomness''' is a process which has a result that seems to be random. Even if the result seems to be random, the process can be predicted. < ref name= " RandomArticle_Phys.NYT2001 " > {{Cite news|last=George Johnson|date=June 12, 2001|title=Connoisseurs of Chaos Offer A Valuable Product: Randomness|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/science/connoisseurs-of-chaos-offer-a-valuable-product-randomness.html}} < /ref >

 == History == 
 The creation of random numbers has many uses, mostly in [[statistics]], and [[Simulation|simulations]]. Before computers, researchers that needed random numbers would get them from [[dice]], [[Playing card|cards]], [[Roulette|roulette wheels]], < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|last=|first=|first2=|date=January 2001|title=A Million Random Digits|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1418/index2.html|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-03-30|website=|publisher=RAND Corporation}} < /ref >   etc, or by [[random number tables]]. 
 
 The first attempt to crate a large amount of random numbers was in 1927. This was when [[Cambridge University Press]] put out a list of 41,600 numbers made by [[L.H.C. Tippett]]. In 1947, the [[RAND Corporation]] created random numbers by simulating a roulette wheel using a computer. < ref name= " :0 " / >  The results were published in 1955 with the title of, '' " [[A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]] " .'' 
 
 == Unpredictability as  " near random "  == 
 By using radioactive substances with [[radioactive decay]],  or by tuning a [[radio]] between stations, near random numbers can be created for short amounts of time. < ref name= " RandomArticle_Phys.NYT2001 " / >  The time needed to get these numbers led to a change. This was using these generated numbers as a  " seed "  instead of a result.  The less numbers created by this process, the more random the result would seem. Another compromise is to combine the timings between keystrokes of multiple people. < ref name= " RandomArticle.SS1998 " > {{Cite magazine|last=Jonathan Knudson|date=January 1998|title=Javatalk: Horseshoes, hand grenades and random numbers|magazine=Sun Server|pages=16–17}} < /ref > 
 
 People's actions have been proven to be useful for [[Multi-factor Authentication|Multi-factor authentication]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Eze Vidra|date=November 6, 2007|title=Science Fiction? ClassifEye's Biometric Authentication for Cell Phones|url=https://www.vccafe.com/2007/11/06/science-fiction-classifeyes-biometric-authentication-for-cell-phones}} < /ref >  Also, studies have shown that pseudo random numbers can sometimes be predicted. This becomes more difficult when in small amounts. 
 
 == In computational complexity == 
 In [[theoretical computer science]], a [[distribution]] (set of numbers) is considered to be '''pseudorandom''' if it is similar enough to other sets. This idea of pseudorandomness is studied and has importance in [[cryptography]].
