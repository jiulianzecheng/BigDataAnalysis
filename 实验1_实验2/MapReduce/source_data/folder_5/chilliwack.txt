Over 40,000 gold miners had traveled to the goldfields and many of them traveled through the Chilliwack area. Chilliwack was incorporated as a town in 1873 and was the third municipality in British Columbia. < ref name=ChillHis > {{cite web|url=http://www.gov.chilliwack.bc.ca/main/page.cfm?id=167|access-date=8 December 2012|title=City of Chilliwack - History of Chilliwack|publisher=City of Chilliwack}} < /ref >
