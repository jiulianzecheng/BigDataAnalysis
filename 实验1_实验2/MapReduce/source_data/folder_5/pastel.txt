A '''pastel''' is an [[art]] color in the form of a stick. It is made of pure powdered [[pigment]] and a 'binder' which holds it together. Pastels have been used by artists since the [[Renaissance]]. 
 
 The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all kinds of colored art. The effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process. < ref > Mayer, Ralph. 1991. ''The Artist's Handbook of materials and techniques''.
