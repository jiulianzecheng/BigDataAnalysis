 '''BonziBuddy''' (styled as BonziBUDDY) was a [[freeware]] [[computer program|program]] from BONZI Software. The [[software]] was available from 1999 to 2004. It is based on the [[Microsoft Agent|Microsoft Agent technology]]. The program is no longer available because it contained a lot of [[adware]], [[malware]], and [[spyware]]. Most [[antivirus software]] picked up the software as Adware. The user would right click on the character and a menu would come up with different things that the character could do. It could tell jokes, facts, sing songs, download files and keep people on schedule with a calendar. Most things required the [[purchase]] of add-ons which would add extra jokes, facts and songs. There were also game add-ons and a [[speech recognition]] add-on which was called the 'Talking Add-on Module'. The program itself was advertised as an Internet Companion. The official website stayed open until 2008 and then it was no longer working. BonziBUDDY can still be [[download]]ed by [[upload]]s from fans.

In later versions, they changed Bonzi's entrance from a surf board to a jungle vine.
