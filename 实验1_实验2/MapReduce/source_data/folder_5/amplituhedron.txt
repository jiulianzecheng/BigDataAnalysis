 An '''amplituhedron''' is a [[geometric]] shape that makes it easier to calculate particle interactions in quantum field theories. 
 
 Currently, the limits of the ''N'' = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, which is used to calculate the amplituhedron, cause it to be a toy theory. Therefore, the application of the amplituhedron is limited in the real world.
