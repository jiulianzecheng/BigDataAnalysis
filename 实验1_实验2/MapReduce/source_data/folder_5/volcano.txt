 A '''volcano''' is a [[mountain]] that has [[lava]] (hot, liquid rock) coming out from a [[magma]] chamber under the ground, or did have in the past. Volcanoes < ref > The plural of volcano can be ''either'' volcanos or volcanoes. Both are correct and it is not a matter of British vs US spelling. ''Oxford English Dictionary''. < /ref >  are formed by the movement of [[tectonic plates]]. 
 
 The Earth's crust has 17 major, rigid [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. These float on a hotter, softer layer in its [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://enviroliteracy.org/nsfmod/NaturesFury.pdf |title=Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Tsunamis |work=Resources for Environmental Literacy |author=NSTA Press / Archive.Org |date=2007 |access-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913041924/http://www.enviroliteracy.org/nsfmod/NaturesFury.pdf |archive-date=September 13, 2012 }} < /ref >  Volcanoes are often found where tectonic plates are  [[Convergent boundary|coming together]]. 
     
 Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the [[East African Rift]]. < ref name=Foulger > {{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: a geological controversy |last1=Foulger|first1= Gillian R. |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}} < /ref >  Volcanoes are usually not found where two tectonic plates slide past one another. 
 
 Volcanism away from plate boundaries is caused by [[mantle plume]]s. These so-called  " [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] " , for example [[Hawaii]], are thought to arise from upwelling magma from the [[structure of the Earth|core–mantle boundary]], 3,000 & nbsp;km deep in the Earth.   
 
 Most volcanoes have a [[volcanic crater]] at the top. When a volcano is [[active volcano|active]], materials come out of it. The materials include lava, [[steam]], gaseous [[sulfur compounds]], [[Volcanic ash|ash]] and broken [[Rock (geology)|rock]] pieces. 
 
 When there is enough pressure, the volcano erupts. Some [[volcanic eruption]]s blow off the top of the volcano. Sometimes, the magma comes out quickly and sometimes it comes slowly. Some eruptions come out at a side instead of the top. 
 
 Volcanoes are found on planets other than [[Earth]]. An example is [[Olympus Mons]] on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]]. 
 
 Volcanologists are scientists who study volcanoes using methods from geology, chemistry, geography, mineralogy, physics and sociology. 
 
 The world's biggest volcano is named [[Mauna Loa]] in Hawaii. Mauna Loa is part of the five volcanoes on Hawaii's 'Big Island'. The most recent time this volcano erupted was in 1984. It erupted 33 times in the last 170 years. Like all the other Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa was created by the movement of the [[Pacific tectonic plate]] which moved over the Hawaii [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the Earth's mantle. Mauna Loa is 4,196 & nbsp;meters tall. It is a [[shield volcano]]. The largest recent eruption from Mauna Loa left a lava trail {{convert|51|km|abbr=off}} long. 
 
 == Types of volcanoes == 
 The [[lava]] and pyroclastic [[material]] (clouds of ash, lava fragments and vapor) that comes out from volcanoes can make many different kinds of land shapes. There are two basic kinds of volcanoes. 
 
 === Shield volcanoes === 
 These volcanoes are formed by fluid low-[[silica]] [[mafic]] lava. 
 
 [[Shield volcano]]es are built out of layers of [[lava]] from continual eruptions (without explosions). Because the lava is so fluid, it spreads out, often over a wide area. Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height, and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently [[wikt:slope|sloping sides]]. Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of [[basalt]], which is usually what lava is when cooled. 
 
 The base of the volcano increases in size over successive eruptions where solidified lava spreads out and accumulates. Some of the world's largest volcanoes are shield volcanoes. 
 
 Even though their sides are not very ''steep'', shield volcanoes can be huge. [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]] is the biggest mountain on Earth if it is measured from its base on the floor of the sea. < ref name=camilla > {{cite book | title = Earth Science| url = https://archive.org/details/holtsciencetechn00na_0| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = Austin, [[Texas]] | isbn = 0-03-055667-8}} < /ref > 
 
 === Stratovolcanoes ===

 [[File:Tavurvur volcano edit.jpg|thumb|[[Tavurvur]], an active stratovolcano near [[Rabaul]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]]] 
 
 A [[stratovolcano]], also known as a '''composite volcano''', < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/types.html |title=Principal types of volcanoes. USGS |access-date=2013-07-02 |archive-date=2013-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509172417/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/types.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  is a tall, [[cone|conical]] volcano. It is built up of many layers of hardened [[lava]], [[tephra]], [[pumice]], and [[volcanic ash]]. 
 
 Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes have a steep profile and periodic eruptions. The lava that flows from stratovolcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far. It is sticky, that is, it has high [[viscosity]]. The [[magma]] forming this [[lava]] is often [[felsic]], with high-to-intermediate levels of [[silica]], and less [[mafic]] magma. Big felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}. < ref name=camilla/ > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php|title=Garibaldi volcanic belt: Garibaldi Lake volcanic field|work=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|publisher=Geological Survey of Canada|date=2009-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626082839/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/volcanoes/cat/feature_garibaldi_e.php |access-date=2010-06-27|archive-date=2009-06-26 }} < /ref > 
 
 Two famous stratovolcanoes are [[Japan]]'s [[Mount Fuji]], and [[Vesuvius]]. Both have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top. Vesuvius is famous for its destruction of the towns [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] in 79 & nbsp;AD, killing thousands. 
 
 ==== Caldera ==== 
 {{main|Caldera}} 
 A [[caldera]] is a basin-like feature formed by collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This happens after a huge stratovolcano blows its top off. The base of the crater then sinks, leaving a caldera where the top of the volcano was before. [[Krakatoa]], best known for its catastrophic eruption in 1883, is much smaller now. < ref name=camilla/ >

 There are two main processes. 
 
 Volcanoes are made when two [[tectonic plate]]s come together. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the oceanic plate) goes under the continental plate. This is the process of [[subduction]]. Afterwards, it melts and makes [[magma]] (inside the magma chamber), and the [[pressure]] builds up until the magma bursts through the [[Earth's crust]]. 
 
 The second way is when a tectonic plate moves over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] in the Earth's crust. The hot spot works its way through the crust until it breaks through. The [[caldera]] of [[Yellowstone Park]] was formed in that way; so were the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. 
 
 == Classification == 
 [[File:Braun  &  Hogenberg 'Castrum Puellarum' (Edinburgh Castle) c.1581.jpg|thumb|right|Edinburgh Castle on the site of an extinct volcano, c. 1581]] 
 
 A [[wikt:traditional|traditional]] way to [[wikt:classify|classify]] or [[wikt:identify|identify]] volcanoes is by its pattern of [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]]. Those volcanoes which may erupt again at any time are called [[active volcano|active]]. Those that are now quiet are called [[dormant volcano|dormant]] (inactive). Those volcanoes which have not erupted in historical times are called [[extinct volcano|extinct]]. 
 
 === Active === 
 {{main|List of active volcanoes}} 
 An active volcano is currently erupting, or it has erupted in the last 10,000 years. An example of an active volcano is [[Mount St. Helens]] in the [[United States]] (US). < ref name= " ball " > {{cite web |url=http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/voices-dead-or-alive-or-neither-why-dormant-volcano-not-dead-one |title=Voices: Dead or alive ... or neither? Why a dormant volcano is not a dead one |first=Jessica |last=Ball |work=Earth Magazine |date=September 8, 2010 |access-date=14 August 2012 |archive-date=28 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128081248/http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/voices-dead-or-alive-or-neither-why-dormant-volcano-not-dead-one |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 === Dormant (inactive) === 
 A dormant volcano is  " sleeping, "  but it could awaken in the future. [[Mount Rainier]] in the [[United States]] is considered dormant. < ref name= " ball " / > 
 
 === Extinct (dead volcano) === 
 {{main|List of extinct volcanoes}} 
 An extinct volcano has not erupted in the past 10,000 years. < ref name= " ball " / >  [[Edinburgh Castle]] in Scotland sits on top of an extinct volcano. < ref > University of Edinburgh, [http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html  " Holyrood Park Geology " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830203351/http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html |date=2007-08-30 }}; retrieved 2012-8-2. < /ref > 
 
 == Largest volcano on Earth == 
 The Earth's largest volcano has been discovered. < ref name=Bigvol/ > < ref > Witze, Alexandra 2013. Underwater volcano is Earth's biggest: [[Tamu Massif]] rivals the size of Olympus Mons on Mars. [http://www.nature.com/news/underwater-volcano-is-earth-s-biggest-1.13680] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706031645/http://www.nature.com/news/underwater-volcano-is-earth-s-biggest-1.13680|date=2014-07-06}} < /ref >  It is 2 & nbsp;km below the sea on an underwater [[plateau]] known as the [[Shatsky Rise]]. This is about 1,600 & nbsp;km east of [[Japan]]. The previous record-holder, [[Mauna Loa]] in [[Hawaii]], is still the largest volcano on land. 
 
 The 310,000 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  (119,000 & nbsp;sq mi) volcano, [[Tamu Massif]], is comparable in size to [[Mars]]' vast [[Olympus Mons]] volcano, which is the largest known volcano in the [[Solar System]]. It was formed about 145 million years ago when massive lava flows erupted from the centre of the volcano to form a broad, shield-like feature. That suggests the volcano produced a [[flood basalt]] eruption. 
 
 The Tamu Massif extends some 30 & nbsp;km (18 & nbsp;miles) into the [[Earth's crust]]. The researchers doubted the submerged volcano's peak ever rose above sea level during its lifetime and say it is unlikely to erupt again. 
 : " The bottom line is that we think that Tamu Massif was built in a short (geologically speaking) time of one to several million years and it has been extinct since " , co-author William Sager of the [[University of Houston]] told the AFP [[news agency]]. 
 : " There were lots of oceanic plateaus (that) erupted during the [[Cretaceous]] period (145-65 million years ago) but we don't see them since. Scientists would like to know why... The biggest oceanic plateau is [[Ontong Java Plateau]], near the equator in the [[Pacific]], east of the [[Solomon Islands]]. It is much bigger than Tamu {{ndash}} it's the size of France " . < ref name= " Bigvol " > World's largest volcano discovered beneath Pacific. ''BBC Science  &  Environment''.
