 '''Fermium''' (symbol '''Fm''') is a [[chemical element]]. It has an [[atomic number]] of 100, which makes it at position 100 at the [[periodic table]]. Fermium cannot be found in nature; it has to be made.  Scientists can create it by combining [[plutonium]] with [[neutron|neutrons]] at very high speeds and temperatures.  It is named after [[Enrico Fermi]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Albert Ghiorso]] and other scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] first discovered fermium.  They found the element in the [[fallout]] from the explosion of the first successful [[hydrogen bomb]] test.  This test was on November 1, [[1952]].  In the fallout, scientists also discovered another new [[Chemical element|element]], [[Einsteinium]].  Because of the [[Cold War]], the US military did not allow the scientists to publish their results in a [[scientific journal]].  However, they conducted other studies and published their research in 1954.  The studies of nuclear fallout were [[classified information|declassified]] and published in 1955. 
 
 A group in the Nobel Institute for Physics in [[Stockholm]] also discovered [[isotopes]] of this element before the research of the Berkeley scientists was published.  However, most agree that the Berkeley scientists were the first to discover fermium.
