 Eleaticism was a way of thinking about the world that some ancient Greek people had. They lived in a place called Elea, which is now in Italy. They thought that everything that exists is really one thing, and that thing is called Being. Being does not change or move or have parts. It is always the same and always whole. They also thought that we can know Being by using our reason, not by looking at things or feeling them. They said that what we see and feel is not real, but only an illusion. Some of the most famous Eleatic thinkers were Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus. They wrote poems and arguments to explain their ideas. 
 
 == History == 
 Eleaticism was a way of thinking that started in the 5th century BC in ancient Greece. It was named after a place called Elea, where some of the thinkers lived. Elea was a town in southern Italy, near the sea. The first and most famous Eleatic thinker was Parmenides. He wrote a poem about his ideas. He had two students, Zeno and Melissus, who also wrote about Eleaticism. They tried to support Parmenidesâ€™ ideas with different arguments. Eleaticism was different from other ways of thinking at that time. It challenged the ideas of people like Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Pythagoras. Eleaticism also influenced later thinkers like Plato and Aristotle. 
 
 == Key principles == 
 Eleaticism was based on the idea that there is only one thing that is real and true, and that is Being. Being is something that does not change, move, or have parts. It is always the same and always whole. Everything else that we see or feel is not real, but only an illusion. Eleaticism also said that we can know Being by using our reason, not by using our senses. Reason tells us what is true and clear, while senses tell us what is false and confusing. Eleaticism also said that Being, thought, and expression are the same thing. This means that what we think and say must be about Being, and nothing else.
