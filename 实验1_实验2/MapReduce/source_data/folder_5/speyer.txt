 '''Speyer''' (English formerly ''Spires'') is a [[city]] in  the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] with about 50,000 inhabitants on the [[Rhine]] river. It lies {{convert|25|km|mi|1|lk=on|abbr=off}} south of [[Ludwigshafen]] and [[Mannheim]]. Around the year 500 the town gets the name ''Spira'', named after the stream ''Speyerbach'' which flows into the [[Rhine]] river here. 
 
 The center of Speyer is dominated by the [[Speyer Cathedral]]. Here are the [[tomb]]s of several of the [[Salian Dynasty|Salian emperors]]: the bodies, however, are believed to have gone missing during one of the French invasions during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
