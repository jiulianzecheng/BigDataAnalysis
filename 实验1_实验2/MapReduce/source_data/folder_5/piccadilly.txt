 '''Piccadilly''' is a major street in [[central London]], running from [[Hyde Park Corner]] in the west to [[Piccadilly Circus]] in the east. It is completely within the [[City of Westminster]]. [[St. James's]] lies to the south of the eastern section of the street, while the western section overlooks [[Green Park]]. The area to the north is [[Mayfair]]. 
 
 It is the location of [[Fortnum  &  Mason]], the [[Royal Academy]], [[The Ritz Hotel]], the [[Royal Air Force Club|RAF Club]] and [[Hatchards]] book shop. [[Simpsons of Piccadilly|Simpsons]], once amongst the [[United Kingdom]]'s leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s.

 ==History==

 The name Piccadilly may come from a tailor named Robert Baker, in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling ''piccadills'' â€“ stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border, which were then in fashion. With his great fortune he bought a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London. 
 
 After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the [[England|English]] monarchy in 1660, Piccadilly and the area to the north (Mayfair) began to be systematically developed as a fashionable residential locality. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of Piccadilly: [[Clarendon House]], Berkeley House (later [[Devonshire House]]), and Sir John Denham's house (later [[Burlington House]]) were built in the 17th century. Later mansions included Melbourne House (now [[The Albany]]), [[Apsley House]], Bath House  and [[Cambridge House]]. Several members of the [[Rothschild banking family of England|Rothschild family]] had mansions at the western end of the street, and that part was colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row.  
 
 By the 1920s most of these buildings had been demolished or were in institutional use.  The enlargement of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] and the formation of [[Hyde Park Corner]] as a major [[traffic]] gyratory system has cut off the western stretch of Piccadilly, with the result that [[Apsley House]] has become detached from it. 
 
 21st century Piccadilly is not one of London's principal shopping streets, despite the presence of several famous shops. The [[Ritz Hotel]] is in the street, along with some other luxury hotels. There are also some offices and some very expensive flats. Piccadilly is one of the widest and straightest streets in central London.
