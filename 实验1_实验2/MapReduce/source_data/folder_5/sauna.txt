 A '''sauna''' is a small room or building that is made hot. The heat of a sauna is calming and makes the person using it [[sweat]]. This is believed to help people be more [[health]]y though it causes stress on the body by overheating. Today many [[country|countries]] and groups of people have different ways of heating and using a sauna. The temperature is often 80°[[Celsius|C]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] saunas. The heat can be more than 100°C. Finnish and Swedish saunas have lower [[humidity]] (the air is less [[wet]]) to make this high heat comfortable. 
 
 The [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[hammam]] has a high humidity (the air is more wet) and a lower temperature. 
 
 Today saunas can often be found at [[hotel]]s and places for [[sport]]s and [[exercise]]. In Finland, they are more common and are also often in [[Private property|private]] [[apartment]]s and [[office]]  
 [[building]]s. 
 
 In almost every house in Finland they have a sauna. 
 
 ==Common rules for public saunas== 
 In some [[culture]]s, [[swimsuit]]s must be worn in a sauna. In other cultures swimsuits are not be worn. Swimsuits are more often worn when [[men]] and [[women]] use a sauna together. Some saunas are only for men, or only for women. Some places have fixed times when each [[gender]] can use a sauna. Private saunas may have their own rules.
