 '''Libera''' is an all-boy singing group from [[England]]. It is directed by [[Robert Prizeman]]. There are roughly 40 members aged 7 to 16. They go to different schools in [[South London]]. Most members come from the [[parish]] [[choir]] of St. Philip's, [[Norbury]], in South London. < ref name= " TheBridge " > {{cite web|author=Harris, Bryan|date=May 2006|title=St. Philips, Norbury ... and the phenomenon that is Libera|url=http://www.southwark.anglican.org/thebridge/0605/0605p06_07.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607061513/http://www.southwark.anglican.org/thebridge/0605/0605p06_07.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-07|accessdate=2013-12-21}} < /ref >  Libera record albums and goes on tour around the world.

 Most boys have unchanged [[boy soprano]] (also known as treble) voices. The boys in their early teens sing the lowest parts. Libera's songs are either new compositions by Robert Prizeman or new arrangements of classical and contemporary tunes. Prizeman often composes and arranges pieces with individual soloists in mind. He does this to emphasize the variety of characteristics and qualities in the boys' voices.
