'''Oscillation''' is when something  " [[vibrate]]s " , or repeats the same pattern. Many things in nature move back-and-forth or up-and down when pushed or struck. In time, natural oscillators slow down and stop because of [[friction]]. 
 
 == Examples == 
 *The [[pendulum]] of a  " grandfather [[clock]] " , for example, is a very slow oscillator.  
 *The strings of [[piano]]s and string [[musical instrument|instrument]]s  " oscillate "  when struck by a hammer.  
 *An [[ocean surface wave]] is the result of water moving up and down. 
 *[[Electrical circuit|Circuit]]s powered by electricity can  " oscillate " . Such circuits can be used to make [[sound]]s or [[radio wave]]s. 
 *Different [[chemical]]s, when you mix them together in the right order, can make some new things.  But then these things change back to the original ones, making this repeating pattern.  These are called [[chemical oscillators]].
