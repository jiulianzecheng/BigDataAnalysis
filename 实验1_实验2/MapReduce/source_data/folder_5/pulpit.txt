 A '''pulpit''' (from [[Latin]] ''pulpitum''  " scaffold " ,  " platform " ,  " stage " ) is a [[small]] lifted platform where a [[member]] of the [[clergy]] stands to [[read]] a [[Gospel]] [[lesson]], or give a [[sermon]]. In some [[Protestant]] [[church]]es, the ''pulpit'' is thought to be the most important piece of [[furniture]] in the [[sanctuary]].
