 '''Bones''' are parts of the [[skeleton]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They also protect [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] inside our body. < ref name=firstbody > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weyXAAAACAAJ|title=My First Book on the Human Body|publisher=Robert Frederick|location= Bath|date=2004|isbn=0-7554-3506-0|accessdate=13 July 2010|language=}} < /ref > 
 
 The bones are the [[framework]] of the [[body]]. Without them we would be a pile of organs and [[skin]] on the ground and would not be able to move. 
 
 Bones also protect us. The [[skull]] protects the [[brain]] and the [[rib cage|rib]]s protect the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s.  The [[jaw]] and [[skull]] support the facial muscles, which help us eat and move our mouth.  The [[pelvis]] protects the reproductive organs, and [[vertebrae]] protect the [[spinal cord]].   
 
 Bone is living tissue, and must be maintained by taking regular [[exercise]] and by having [[calcium]] from foods like [[milk]], and dark leafy greens such as [[spinach]].  The [[bone marrow]] in the middle of the bigger bones makes our [[red blood cell]]s. 
 
 == Structure == 
 === Bone marrow === 
 Long bones are hollow, with a central core which is not strong like the rest of the bone. It contains the [[bone marrow]], one of the most important [[tissues]] in the vertebrate body. It produces [[blood cells]] for the blood system, and [[lymphocytes]] for the [[immune system]]. {{-}}

 === Osteons ===

 Osteons are the small units of which the hardest parts of human bones are made. They are roughly cylindrical, and about 0.2mm wide and a few millimeters long. They are found in the bone in most [[mammals]], and many [[reptiles]], [[birds]] and [[amphibians]]. < ref > Martiniakov√°, Monika 2003. Differences among species in microstructure of mammalian skeleton. Dissertation, Nitra < /ref >  Inside the osteons are bone cells called [[osteocyte]]s, each living in its own small space. Osteocytes make contact with each other by [[cytoplasmic]] processes through a network of tiny canals. This allows the exchange of nutrients and metabolic waste.  [[Collagen]] fibers in each ring of cells ('lamellae') give them structure. < ref > Cooper, Reginald R.; Milgram, James W.; and Robinson, Robert A. 1966.

 Osteons have a hole down the middle, called the haversian canal. This canal contains the bone's [[blood]] supply. It also contains [[capillaries]], and [[nerve fibres]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/haversian|title = Haversian|first =|last =|website = The Free Dictionary|publisher =|accessdate = 2016-03-10}} < /ref > 
 
 The details of osteon structure varies between bones and parts of bones, from species to species,  between sexes, and by age and environmental factors. < ref > Klevezal G. 1996.
