'''{{lang|el|Νεολεξία}}''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: a  " new word " , or the act of creating a new word) is a synonym for it. The term ''neologism'' was first used in English in 1772, borrowed from French ''néologisme'' (1734). < ref > ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', draft revision Dec. 2009, [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00322941 ''s.v.''] < /ref > 
 
 Using an existing word or phrase in a new context is also called ''neologism''. < ref > Sally Barr Ebest ''Writing from A to Z: the easy-to-use reference handbook'' 1999– Page 449   " A neologism is a newly coined word or phrase or a new usage of an existing word or phrase. " < /ref > < ref > Lynne Bowker, Jennifer Pearson ''Working With Specialized Language'' 2002 Page 214  " Neologisms can also be formed in another way, however, by assigning a new meaning to an existing word. " < /ref >  The process of using a word in such a new context is sometimes called a semantic extension. < ref > Ole Nedergaard Thomsen ''Competing models of linguistic change: evolution and beyond'' 2006 – Page 68  " Extensions, by contrast, are applications of extant means in new usage. Note that since individual speakers differ in their command of their shared tradition of speaking, one person's Extension may be experienced by another as a Neologism " < /ref > < ref > Michael D. Picone ''Anglicisms, Neologisms and Dynamic French'' 1996 – Page 3  " Proceeding now to the task of defining terms, I will begin with the more general term 'neologism'. ...A neologism is any new word, morpheme or locution and any new meaning for a preexistent word, morpheme or locution that appears in a language. ... Likewise, any semantic extension of a preexistent word, morpheme or locution.. but is also, by accepted definition, a neologism.

 ==Use in psychiatry== 
 In [[psychiatry]], the term ''neologism'' is used to describe the use of words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. < ref > G E Berrios (2009) Neologisms. ''History of Psychiatry'' 20: 480–496 < /ref >  This tendency is considered normal in children. In adults, it can be a symptom of [[psychopathy]] < ref > " Most of us are able to combine ideas so that they are consistent with some underlying theme, but psychopaths seem to have difficulty doing so. This helps to explain the wild inconsistencies and contradictions that frequently characterize their speech. It may also account for their use of neologisms (combining the basic components of words – syllables – in ways that seem logical to them but inappropriate to others). "  [[Robert D. Hare]] (1999), ''Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us''. Guildford Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xfIEVtzj52YC & q=neologism & pg=PA137 p. 137] < /ref >   or a [[thought disorder]], such as a [[Psychosis|psychotic]] [[mental illness]], for example [[schizophrenia]]. < ref > P. J. McKenna, Schizophrenia and Related Syndromes. Page 363. < /ref >   People with [[autism]] may also create neologisms. < ref > [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1864825 Neologisms and idiosyncratic language in autistic speakers]. J Autism Dev Disord. 1991 Jun;21(2):109-30. < /ref >  Additionally, use of neologisms may be related to [[aphasia]] acquired after [[brain damage]] resulting from a [[stroke]] or [[Traumatic brain injury|head injury]]. < ref > B Butterworth, Hesitation and the production of verbal paraphasias and neologisms in jargon aphasia.

 ==Use in theology== 
 In [[theology]], a neologism is a relatively new [[doctrine]] (for example, [[Transcendentalism]]). In this sense, a neologist is one who proposes either a new doctrine or a new interpretation of source material such as religious texts. < ref > Wood, J.,  " The Nuttall Encyclopædia: Being a Concise and Comprehensive Dictionary of General Knowledge "  (1907), [http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Wood-NuttallEncyclopaedia/n/neology.html] < /ref >
