In [[law]], '''affinity''' is the [[kinship]] relationship that exists between two or more people as a result of somebody's [[marriage]]. < ref name=Summa > Saint Raymond of Peñafort; Pierre J. Payer, ''Summa on Marriage'' (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 61 < /ref >  It is different from [[consanguinity]] (blood relationship). < ref name=Summa/ >  Affinity is the [[relationship]] which each party to a marriage has to the [[Family|relatives]] of the other partner to the marriage. But affinity does not cover the [[marital relationship]] of the parties to the marriage themselves.  
 
 ==Affinity laws== 
 Under the law, such relatives by marriage are known as '''affines'''. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://mylawdictionary.org/affines/ |title=What is AFFINES? |publisher=My Law Dictionary |access-date=27 August 2016 |archive-date=5 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235610/https://mylawdictionary.org/affines/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  More commonly, they are known as {{nowrap| " '''in-laws''' " }}, as affinity is usually signified by adding {{nowrap| " [[In-law (disambiguation)|-in-law]] " }} to a degree of kinship.{{refn|group=n|This is standard for the closest degrees of kinship—{{nowrap|''father-in-law'',}} {{nowrap|''daughter-in-law'',}}  & c.—but is frequently omitted in the case of more extended relations. As ''uncle'' and ''aunt'' are frequently used to refer to friends of the family. The terms may be used without specifying whether the person is a [[wikt:cognate|cognate]] (blood relative) or affine (related by marriage). A [[spouse]] of a [[cousin]] may not be called a relation at all or may be called a  " cousin by marriage " .}} 
 
 In law, affinity may be used to [[wikt:prohibit|prohibit]] [[incest|incestuous sexual relations]]. It may also be [[wikt:relevant|relevant]] in preventing some couples from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited varys from country to country, and from time to time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws.  In earlier laws, affinity was used in the same degrees as consanguinity in prohibiting marriages. < ref > ''American Family Laws'', Volume I (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1931), p. 183 < /ref > 
 
 Though laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced. It does not always end with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage,  " affinity "  can sometimes also include kinship by [[adoption]] and [[Stepfamily|step relationship]].
