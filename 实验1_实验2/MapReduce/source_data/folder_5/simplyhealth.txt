'''Simplyhealth''' is a [[health insurance]] company based in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]]. 
 
 It started in 1872 as the Manchester  &  Salford Hospital Saturday Fund. This was a [[nonprofit organization]].  The members paid every week.  They could then go to a [[voluntary hospital]] without paying. When they were sick the fund paid them. The fund gave more than ten million pounds to hospitals in London before 1944. < ref > {{cite news|date=1944-02-04|title=H.S.A.

 When the [[National Health Service]] started in 1948 it continued. Members pay every month and get money when they are ill. Most of them do this through their employer.   It changed its name in 2009 to Simplyhealth.
