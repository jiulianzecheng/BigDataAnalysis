 '''''Hypacrosaurus''''' (meaning  " almost the largest lizard " ) was a large, plant-eating, hollow-crested [[Hadrosaurid|duck-billed dinosaur]] similar to ''[[Corythosaurus]]''.  
 
 The adults were about 30 feet (9 m) long. Their teeth were continually replacing, and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth. Only a relative handful of teeth were in use at any one time. They had a short toothless beak.  
 
 A row of long spines from their [[vertebrae]] formed a high fin along the back. The fossils are dated as 75 to 67 million years ago.  
 
 Remains have been found of two species in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and [[Montana]], [[United States]]. It is the latest hollow-crested duckbill known from good remains in [[North America]]. In the 1990s nests, eggs, and hatchlings of one of the species was found. < ref name= " HC94 " > {{cite book|title=Dinosaur Eggs and Babies|last=Horner|first=John R.|author2=Currie, Phillip J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-56723-8|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|location=Cambridge|pages=312â€“336|chapter=Embryonic and neonatal morphology and ontogeny of a new species of ''Hypacrosaurus'' (Ornithischia, Lambeosauridae) from Montana and Alberta|authorlink=Jack Horner (paleontologist)|editor2=Hirsch, Karl F.|editor3=Horner John R.}} < /ref >
