'''Verismo''' is a word which refers to a type of [[literature]] and a type of [[opera]] that was popular towards the end of the [[19th century]] and the beginning of the [[20th century]]. The [[Italian language|Italian]] word  " verismo "  means  " [[realism]] " . 
 In literature the main verismo writers were the [[France|Frenchman]] [[Ã‰mile Zola]], the [[Norway|Norwegian]] dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the Italian writer [[Giovanni Verga]]. The [[composer]] [[Pietro Mascagni]] used a story by Verga for his opera [[Cavalleria rusticana]]. This was a short, one-act opera which became extremely popular. Several composers were inspired by it and wrote similar works. The only one of these which is still regularly performed is ''[[Pagliacci]]'' by [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]. These two short operas are often performed on the same evening. They are known together as  " Cav and Pag " . 
 
 Verismo operas are generally based on stories about ordinary people from the working classes rather than about [[king]]s or [[god]]s or [[aristocrat]]s. There is often a lot of [[violence]] in the stories as people love one another with great passions, which often leads to [[murder]]. [[Bizet]]'s opera ''[[Carmen]]'' is typical of that kind of story, although it was composed before the verismo tradition was really popular.
