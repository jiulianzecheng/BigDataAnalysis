{{dablink|For  " consonant "  in a [[music]]al sense see [[Consonance and dissonance]]}} 
 All the letters in the alphabet are either '''consonants or''' [[vowel]]s. A consonant is a [[speech]] sound in which the air is at least partly blocked, and any letter which represents this. < ref > ''Concise Oxford English Dictionary''. < /ref >  Consonants may come singily (by themselves) or in clusters (two or more together), but must be connected to a [[vowel]] to form a [[syllable]]. 
 
 Notice that the consonant (C) and vowel (V) notation does not match the letters of English spelling in a one-to-one relationship (e.g. 'th' is one sound), but rather individual sounds. 
 
 Words with single consonants include: 
 * ''Go'' (CV), which has one consonant and one vowel in that order 
 * ''On'' (VC), which has one vowel and one consonant in that order 
 * ''Ton'' (CVC), which has a consonant, a vowel, and another consonant in that order 
 
 Words with consonant clusters include: 
 * ''Pro'' (CCV), which has two consonants in-a-row and one vowel afterwards 
 * ''Old'' (VCC), which has one vowel and two consonants in-a-row afterwards  
 * ''Spree'' (CCCV), which has three consonants in-a-row and one vowel afterwards 
 * ''Arcs'' (VCCC), which has one vowel and three consonants in-a-row afterwards 
 * ''Strengths'' (CCCVCCCCC), which has three consonants in-a-row, one vowel afterwards, and finally five consonants in a row 
 
 Consonants have [[friction]] when they are spoken, mostly using the position of the [[tongue]] against the [[Lip|lips]], [[Tooth|teeth]] and roof of the [[mouth]]. ''b'' and ''p'' are ''[[Stop consonant|plosives]]'', using the lips to produce a tiny sharp sound. [[Phonetics]] texts give more details, with diagrams. Consonants may be [[Voiced consonant|voiced]] < ref > Sound pronounced with the vibration of the [[vocal cord]]s < /ref >  or [[Voiceless sound|unvoiced]]. < ref > Sound pronounced without the vibration of the [[vocal cord]]s < /ref >  The th in ''the'' is voiced, but in ''breath'' is not. 
 
 *There are 21 consonant letters in English, for 24 consonant sounds in most English accents. < ref name= " Crystal " > Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge. < /ref > < sup > p242 < /sup >  Because of the history of the English language, there is no neat one-to-one relationship between letter and sound. ''th'' and ''ch'' each stand for a single sound, and ''x'' in ''fox'' stands for two sounds (''ks''). All these letters are consonants: 
 :[[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[W]], [[X]], (sometimes [[Y]]), and [[Z]].  " Y "  is often used as a consonant, but it is sometimes used as a vowel. For example, in the word ''yellow'', y is a consonant. But in the word ''happy'', y is a vowel. 
 
 *The rest of the letters of the alphabet are called vowels. Vowels are underdone, for there are about 20 vowel sounds in most English accents. < ref name= " Crystal " / > < sup > p237 < /sup >  The vowels are: 
 :[[A]], [[E]], [[I]], [[O]], [[U]] (and sometimes [[Y]])
