 A '''bridle''' is equipment used to direct and control a [[horse]]. The bridle holds a [[Bit (horse)|bit]] which goes in the mouth of a horse, and has reins which are joined to the bit. 
 
 Bridles are usually made of leather. They are made of different parts which are buckled together. The headpiece, also called a crownpiece, goes behind the horse's ears. The browband is placed across the horse's forehead. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://practicalhorsemanmag.com/tack--apparel/horse-nosebands-11817|title=Become a horse noseband know-it-all |work=Expert how-to for English Riders|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}} < /ref >  Sometimes, a strap called a martingale is attached to the noseband. < ref > Ransford, Sandy. 2006.

 A bridle without a bit uses a noseband to control a horse, and is called a hackamore, or a bitless bridle. Bitless bridles work by pressure and leverage on the horse's nose and chin groove. Bitless bridles can be useful for horses that have problems with their mouths. It is more difficult to turn a horse using a bitless bridle. Bitless bridles can provide tremendous leverage and stopping power. < ref > Draper, Judith. 2004. ''The ultimate encyclopedia of horse breeds and horse care.'' Anness Publishing. < /ref >
