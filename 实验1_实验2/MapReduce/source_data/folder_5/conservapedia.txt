 '''Conservapedia''' is a [[wiki]]-based [[online encyclopedia]] designed for [[Americans]] who are [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Christians]]. It was created by Andrew Schlafly. Conservapedia is a reaction to what its creators see as a  " [[liberal]] [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] "  in [[Wikipedia]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8286084|title=Conservapedia: Data for Birds of a Political Feather?|website=NPR.org}} < /ref >  Conservapedia has articles on many things, but most of the site is about [[politics]] and [[religion]]. It also has [[lecture]]s and other materials for [[student]]s, and classes taught by Mr. Schlafly for free. All articles are written from a conservative point of view dominant in the [[Right-wing]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the [[United States of America]]. Conservapedia has some different ideas on community. They have Administrators who have the most power. Users cannot edit at nighttime in the U.S. (because of [[vandalism]]), upload images, or do other things they could do at most [[wikis]]. Users are granted these rights and can also earn the right to block other users. As of August 2018, Conservapedia owned 47,610 articles. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Statistics|title=Statistics - Conservapedia|website=www.conservapedia.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 Conservapedia was founded by [[lawyer]] Andrew Schlafly because of what he felt was a [[liberal]] [[bias]] in [[Wikipedia]]. He did this with his [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] World History class after one of his students used the [[Common Era]] dating method instead of the [[Anno Domini]] method, which he liked better. 
 
 == Editing == 
 
 Unlike Wikipedia, anonymous people are not allowed to contribute to Conservapedia. They have to create accounts that should be using part of their real names (such as the preferred real first name and last initial setup). Edits should follow the site's conservative, Christian point of view. Administrators control every aspect of the site and have the final say in editorial authority.  Vandals often edit Conservapedia to mess up the pages because they do not agree with the site's point of view.  Some editors are banned for making minor mistakes. 
 
 == Conservative Bible Project == 
 
 In part of Conservapedia, editors edit the Bible to remove what they call  " liberal bias "  from modern versions.  They claim that the [[New International Version]] of the Bible is written at the seventh-grade level and that it has [[political correctness|politically correct]] language.  Critics say that it is not good to rewrite the Bible and say it was bad for them to remove Jesus' prayer in Luke 23:34 and the adulteress story.{{fact|date=July 2023}} 
 
 == Lenski dialogue == 
 Schlafly got into an argument with [[Michigan State University]] researcher Richard Lenski over his twenty-year [[experiment]] with e.coli samples he used to show [[evolution]] happening. Schlafly mailed Lenski asking for the results. Lenski replied by showing Schlafly his paper on the subject. Schlafly (who did not read the paper) asked for the evidence and Lenski refused to hand him the samples since Schlafly is not enough of an expert. Conservapedians got in a campaign criticizing Lenski. 
 
 Critics use this as a way to show how ignorant they think Conservapedia is. 
 
 == Reactions == 
 
 Conservapedia has had some bad reactions from people who think that it is full of statements that are untrue. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/01/afactofonesown1|title=A fact of one's own|first=Conor|last=Clarke|date=1 March 2007|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}} < /ref >  It has also been [[wikt:criticize|criticized]] for supporting some ideas such as [[creationism]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/04/conservapedia-bastion-of-the-realitydenying-right|title=Conservapedia: Bastion of the Reality-Denying Right|first=Barrett|last=Brown|website=The Hive|date=23 April 2009}} < /ref > 
 
 A site called RationalWiki was created mainly to criticize Conservapedia.  Some editors of that site decided that they wanted to vandalize or destroy Conservapedia.  Rational-Wiki now mocks and criticizes other things too. 
 
 Two other sites, A Storehouse of Knowledge and Ameriwiki, were created as alternatives to Conservapedia. 
 
 The Bible Retranslation project has come under criticism by people who feel it is wrong to change God's word. < ref > http://www.riverfronttimes.com/content/printVersion/878131/{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The River Front Times  " Hallowed Be Thy Name: A member of the Schlafly clan figures to do the Lord's work by cleansing the Bible of its  " liberal bias "  Accessed November 13, 2011] < /ref > 
 
 However, there are still some who praise Conservapedia.
