 '''Faust''' or '''Faustus''' is a character from [[Germany|German]] [[legend]]ary stories.  His name comes from a [[Latin]] word meaning  " lucky " .  The legend is about a man called Faust.  Faust wants to have [[knowledge]].  He meets the [[Devil]]. < ref > In Goethe's ''Faust'', the Devil takes the form of Mephistopheles. < /ref >   The Devil tells Faust he can have anything he wants.  In return, the Devil says, Faust must give him his [[soul]].  Faust agrees, and the Devil lets Faust have a wonderful time, but in the end Faust has to go to [[Hell]]. 
 
 The story of Faust became famous all over [[Europe]].  Many writers from different [[country|countries]] wrote their own versions of the Faust story, e.g. [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Thomas Mann]].  Many [[composer]]s wrote music about Faust, e.g. [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Ferrucio Busoni]]. 
 
 The [[adjective]]  " Faustian "  is used to describe a person who wants something so much that it leads them into trouble. 
 
 In the early versions of the Faust story: in [[ballad]]s, [[drama]]s and [[puppet]]-plays, Faust is always damned (meaning he will have to go to Hell).  This is because he prefers human knowledge instead of Godâ€™s knowledge.  This was thought to be very bad at that time. 
 
 Some of the plays and comic puppet theatre from around the [[16th century]] make up their own versions of the story.  They often show Faust as a figure of vulgar fun. The story became popular in England when [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote a play called [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=3274089 & pageno=3 The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. But in [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's]] version of the story two centuries later, Faust is described as a well-educated man who wants more than just  " meat and drink. "
