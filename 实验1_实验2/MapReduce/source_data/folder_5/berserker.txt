'''Berserkers''' (or '''berserks''') were a special kind of [[Norse]] [[warrior]] who were widely feared. < ref > James A. Corrick, ''The Rough, Stormy Age of Vikings'' (Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 2011), p. 12 < /ref >   [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] [[literature]] said they fought in a wild, [[trance]]-like fury. This later gave us the English word ''berserk''.  
 
 Many Old Norse sources say that berserkers were real. Most [[historian]]s believe that berserkers worked themselves into a [[rage]] before [[battle]]. Others think they might have eaten [[drug]]ged foods. The [[Ynglinga saga]] said they charged their enemy without any [[armour]]. < ref name=Chartrand102 > Ren√© Chartrand; et al, ''The Vikings: Voyagers of Discovery and Plunder'' (Oxford; New York: Osprey, 2008), p. 102 < /ref >  Also that they were as mad as [[Grey wolf|wolves]]. They could kill the enemy with a single blow of their [[sword]] while neither fire nor iron could hurt them. < ref name=Chartrand102/ >
