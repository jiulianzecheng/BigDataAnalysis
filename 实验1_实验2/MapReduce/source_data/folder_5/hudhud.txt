Ifugao is known for its terraced rice fields in the mountains. This tradition is practiced during [[rice]] planting, as well as in funerals and funeral rituals. The hudhud probably dates from before the seventh century and consists of over 200 stories of 40 episodes each. The full recitation lasts several days. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists|title=UNESCO - Hudhud chants of the Ifugao|website=ich.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}} < /ref > 
 
 == Cultural importance == 
 As Ifugao has a [[matrilineal]] culture, it is usually the wife who leads in these stories, and her brother occupies a higher position than her husband. Thus, the hudhud has value as an anthropological document. The language of stories, rich in figurative expressions and repetitions, uses [[Metonymy|metonymies]], [[metaphor]]s and [[onomatopoeia]]s, which makes transcription very difficult. There are very few written documents of this tradition. The stories evoke ancient heroes, religious beliefs, traditional practices, and reflect the importance of rice cultivation. The narrators, especially the older women, occupy important positions in the community, as priestesses and as holders of history. The hudhud epics are alternately sung by the first reciter and the choir. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://petitesplanetes.bandcamp.com/album/ifugao-o-hudhud-chants-and-ancient-prayers-from-the-filipino-cordillera|title=IFUGAO • HudHud chants and ancient prayers from the Filipino Cordillera, by Collection Petites Planètes|website=Collection Petites Planètes|access-date=2019-11-17}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/the-good-news/2011/01/02/644254/hudhud-ifugao-enchanting-chanting|title=The hudhud of Ifugao: Enchanting chanting|website=philstar.com|access-date=2019-11-17}} < /ref > 
 
 == Attempts to keep Hudhud alive == 
 Ifugao's conversion to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] weakened his traditional culture. The hudhud has been associated with manual rice harvesting, and this task is now mechanized.The terraced rice fields are inscribed on the World Heritage List under the name  "  Terraced Rice Fields of the Philippine Ranges  " , the number of farmers is constantly falling. The last reciters are already very old and need support in their efforts to transmit their knowledge and sensitize young people. But with support from organizations including the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the hudhud is increasingly being appreciated by the younger Ifugaos today. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57285938|title=Historical dictionary of the Philippines|last=Guillermo, Artemio R.|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|others=May Kyi Win.|isbn=0810854902|edition=2nd|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=57285938}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[2008]] [[UNESCO]] integrated the  " Hudhud, sung accounts of the Ifugao "  into the representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 To encourage the involvement of the community and to ensure the continuous practice of the hudhud in its social-cultural context, the Hudhud Perpetual Award was created and launched in 2006. The annual award encourages the chanting of the stories during harvests, wakes, and bone washing (bogwa) occasions in the participating municipalities. < ref name= " :1 "  / >
