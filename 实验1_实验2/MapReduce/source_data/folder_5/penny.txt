 ==Popular Culture== 
 In British and American culture, finding a penny is often thought to be lucky. A popular expression is  " Find a penny, pick it up, and all the day you'll have good luck. "  If someone asks you  " A penny for your thoughts "  They're wanting to know what you think. The phrase was first written in John Heywood's 1547 Dialogue Conteinying the Nomber in Effect of All the Proverbes in the Englishe Tongue, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1963/whats-the-origin-of-a-penny-for-your-thoughts|title=What's the origin of  " a penny for your thoughts " ?|first=John|last=Carrado|date=11 October 2001|website=The Straight Dope|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2016}} < /ref >  written when the penny was still a sterling silver coin. The possibly related American expression  " my two cents "  (meaning  " my humble opinion " ) uses the low value of the penny to make fun of one's own thoughts in a funny way. In British English, to  " spend a penny "  means to urinate. The phrase does actually imply spending an actual penny: coin-operated public toilets commonly charged a predecimal penny, starting with the Great Exhibition of 1851. Around Decimal Day, British Rail introduced the  " Superloo " , better public toilets that charged 2p (roughly the equivalent of 6d.). < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nationonfilm/topics/railways/background_clip_commentary.shtml|title=THE GOLDEN AGE OF RAILWAY REVISITED|first=|last=|date=24 September 2014|website=BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 May 2016}} < /ref >
