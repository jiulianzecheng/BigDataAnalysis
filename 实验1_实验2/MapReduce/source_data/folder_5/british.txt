It can also be used for some overseas places like [[Gibraltar]] (near [[Spain]]) or the [[Falkland Islands]] (near [[South America]]). 
 
 The term  " British "  is often used to describe something unique to the UK, for example [[British people]], 'the British way of life' or 'the British [[weather]]'. 
 
 A British person can also be called a Briton. A unique symbol of the  " British "  is the Union Jack flag which is recognised globally as a symbol of the United Kingdom. The flag is made up of a combination of the flags of the countries that are part of the United Kingdom. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/history-of-the-british-flag.htm|title=History of the British Flag - Historic Jamestowne Part of Colonial National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|last1=Yorktown|first1=Mailing Address: P.
