 '''Loa''' are the spirits of [[Voodoo]]. They are also referred to as  " mystères "  and  " the invisibles "  and are intermediaries between Bondye (from French Bon Dieu, meaning  " good God " ) and humanity. < ref name=Pinn > Anthony B. Pinn.  " The African American Religious Experience in America "  Greenwood Press, 2005. < /ref >  They have their own personal likes and dislikes, songs, dances, ritual symbols (Veve), and special modes of service. < ref name=Pinn / > 
 
 The word ''Loa'' (''lwa'') comes from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''olúwa'' (meaning  " lord "  or  " God " ). < ref > {{cite book|last= Ramsey|first= Kate|date= 2014|title= The Spirits and the Law: Vodou and Power in Haiti|publisher= University of Chicago Press|page= 19|isbn=9780226703817}} < /ref > 
 
 There are many families of loa: Rada (also Radha), Petro (also Pethro, Petwo), [[Agwé]], Nago, Kongo and [[Ghede Nibo|Ghede]] (also Guede, or Gede) among others. In a ritual the loa are called down by the ''houngan'' (priest) or ''mambo'' (priestess) to take part in the service, receive offerings, and grant requests.
