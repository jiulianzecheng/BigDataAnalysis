In [[theater]], an '''understudy''' is an [[actor]] or [[singer]] who studies the part of one of the main actors or singers in cases when they can't perform. 
 
 If a main performer is unable to perform, the understudy will take their place. The understudy is often a member of the chorus who might have had a small part in the performance anyway.  Sometimes an understudy is called a  " standby " .  A standby is usually not a member of the chorus or ensemble.  They may be required to be present in the theatre during the performance, or part of it, in case of a problem. 
 
 Sometimes an understudy will become famous when they unexpectedly have to perform instead of the usual lead person.
