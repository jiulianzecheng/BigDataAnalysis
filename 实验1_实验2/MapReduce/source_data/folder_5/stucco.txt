 '''Stucco''' is a kind of [[plaster]]work used to decorate [[ceiling]]s and other parts of buildings. It is made of aggregates, binder and water. These days its main constituent is [[Portland cement]], [[sand]], inorganic lime (a [[hydroxide]] mineral, not the fruit) and water. It is applied wet and dries hard. 
 
 The same substance is often called [[plaster]] and sometimes [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].  It has been used for hundreds of years in many cultures round the world.
