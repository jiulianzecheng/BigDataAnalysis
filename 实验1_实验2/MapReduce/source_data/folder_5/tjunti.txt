 '''Tjunti''' is a [[soakage]] site near [[Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory|Kaḻṯukatjara]], in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]. It is where the [[Hull River]] cuts through the [[Petermann Ranges]]. < ref name= " layton " / >  It is about {{convert|36|km}} to the southeast of Kaḻṯukatjara (41 & nbsp;km by road, along the [[Great Central Road|Tjukaruru Road]]). Tjunti is the site where the famous [[gold]] [[Prospecting|prospector]] Harold B. Lasseter took refuge on his fatal search for [[Lasseter's Reef]]. An [[outstation]] was established here in 1977, and belongs to a [[Pitjantjatjara]] family. < ref name= " cane " / > 
 
 The [[Mountain pass|gap]] in the mountains is formed here by the Hull River, a [[sand]]y [[creek]] that is usually dry. It splits the [[Mount Curdie|Curdie Range]] in the south from the [[Mannanana Range]] in the north. There are several soaks and [[wikt:rockhole|rockholes]] in the area. 
 
 The small [[cave]] where Lasseter took refuge is '''{{lang|pjt|Kuḻpi Tjuntinya}}''' (now commonly called '''Lasseter's Cave''' in English). This is an opening in a [[rock formation]] in the Mannanana Range ({{lang-pjt|Tjuntinya}}). Lasseter took shelter here for about 25 days during January 1931. He was trying to find a rich gold deposit that he claimed to have discovered in the area on an earlier [[expedition]]. His [[camel]]s ran away, and he was [[wikt:stranded|stranded]] in the [[desert]] without food. While taking shelter in the cave, Lasseter wrote about his journey in his [[diary]]. He was later found by a local [[Pitjantjatjara]] family, who gave him food and water. After this, Lasseter decided to leave the cave and tried to walk the {{cvt|140|km}} to [[Kata Tjuṯa]]. He was weak from [[dehydration]], [[malnutrition]] and [[wikt:exhaust|exhaustion]], and he died three days later, after walking about {{cvt|55|km}}. < ref name= " layton " / >
