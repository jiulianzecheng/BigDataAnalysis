He was the eldest son of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], Arcadius ruled the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] while his brother [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] ruled the [[Western Roman Empire|West]]. Just like his brother Honorius, He also proved to be a weak emperor as he was dominated by powerful ministers and including his wife [[Aelia Flaccila]]. 
 
 The first crisis Arcadius had to face was the rebellion of the [[Visigoths]] in 395, under the command of [[Alaric I]], who sought to take advantage of the accession of two inexperienced Roman emperors. As Alaric marched towards [[Constantinople]], plundering Macedonia and Thrace, the eastern court could offer no response, as the majority of its army had gone to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] with Theodosius and was now in the hands of Stilicho. Perhaps sensing an opportunity to exercise power in the eastern half of the empire as well, Stilicho declared that Theodosius had made him guardian over both his sons.
