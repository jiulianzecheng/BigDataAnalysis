A '''pseudonym''' (soo-do-nim) or '''alias''' is a fake [[name]] a [[human|person]] uses instead of their real name. Many people use pseudonyms, including authors ([[Pen name|pen names]]) and performers ([[Stage name|stage names]]). People use pseudonyms for several different reasons: to hide [[identity]], [[gender]], and/or [[race (sociology)|race]]. People (such as [[rap|rappers]]) also use pseudonyms to match their stage personality better. Pseudonyms can include [[stage name]]s, [[stage name|screen names]], [[stage name|ring names]], [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, [[wikt:alias|alias]]es, [[superhero]] [[wikt:identity|identities]] and [[code name]]s. 
 
 ''Pseudonym'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|ψευδώνυμον}} (''pseudṓnymon''), which means  " false name " . 
 
 ==Use and examples of pseudonyms== 
 There are three main types of pseudonyms: pen names, stage names and [[Username|user-names]]. Pen names are used by authors, usually to hide identity. Many famous books, such as [[The Outsiders]] and [[A Series of Unfortunate Events]], have been written by authors using a pseudonym. Daniel Handler wrote A Series of Unfortunate Events under the pseudonym [[Lemony Snicket]] both because he wanted to make the author a character in the story and because he wanted to hide his real name. When she published [[The Outsiders]], Susan Eloise Hinton decided to use her initials, S. E., instead of her first and middle names, because she did not want readers to guess her gender. The Brontë sisters ([[Anne Brontë|Anne]], [[Emily Brontë|Emily]] and [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]]) used pseudonyms to hide the fact that they based many of their characters on their [[wikt:neighbor|neighbors]]. 
 
 [[Musicians]], [[Actor|actors]] and [[Performer|performers]] also use pseudonyms, called [[Stage name|stage names]], both to hide their identity and to give themselves a  " cooler "  name. For example, rapper [[Sean Combs]] is currently known by Diddy, but used to call himself P Diddy and Puff Daddy. He says that he changed his name from P Diddy to Diddy because the name  " caused confusion and he wanted to 'simplify things'.

 Many people on the [[Internet]] use pseudonyms. There are many names for these pseudonyms, including user-names, user IDs and handles. These pseudonyms help people stay anonymous on the internet, and they also protect people from [[identity theft]] and [[phishing]]. When people log into an account on sites like [[Wikipedia]], [[MySpace]] or [[Facebook]], their user-name helps identify them without entering their real name. If people used their real name instead of a user-name, it would create confusion for two people with the same name. Usernames make this simple, because people create their own user-names. Also, if someone used their real name, it would make it easier for people to guess their [[wikt:password|passwords]] and for other people to find them in real life. 
 
 Sometimes criminals would use a pseudonym. For example, [[Fraud|com man]] Jefferson R. Smith was also known as [[Soapy Smith]].
