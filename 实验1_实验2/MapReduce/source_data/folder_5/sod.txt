 '''Sod''' is [[grass]] and the part of the [[soil]] beneath it held together by the [[root]]s, or a piece of this material. Some sod is grown agriculturally, and is sold to [[landscaping|landscapers]] who use it to quickly get a [[lawn]]. Sod was used for building of [[fortification]]s in former times.
