 In [[optics]] and [[photography]], an '''aperture''' is a hole where [[light]] can pass through.

 The aperture of a [[photographic lens]] is a hole that can be adjusted to different sizes, using the aperture ring. This ring is behind the lens, but in front of the shutter.  The aperture ring is a flat circle with a small hole in the centre. The small hole is called the ''aperture''. The size of the aperture can be changed. When the aperture is very small only a small amount of light can enter the camera. When the aperture is big, a lot of light can get in. 
 
 This lets the photographer control the amount of [[light]] reaching the [[Photographic film|film]] or [[image sensor]]. The aperture is changed along with the  [[shutter speed]] to control the amount of light that enters the camera.  This amount of light is called the [[exposure (photography)|exposure]].  Typically, a fast shutter speed will not let much light in (meaning the picture could come out too dark), so the photographer will use a larger aperture to correct for this.  A slow shutter speed will need a smaller aperture to stop the picture coming out too bright. 
 
 The size of the aperture is described as an  " f-stop. "   This is a number that describes the size of the hole in relation to the focal length of the lens.  A low number (such as f1.4 or f2.8) means the aperture is wide open, and lets in a lot of light.  A high number (such as f8 or f11) means that the aperture is small, and does not let in as much light.
