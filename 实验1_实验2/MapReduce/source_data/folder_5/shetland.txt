 '''Shetland''' (or the '''Shetland Islands''') is an [[archipelago]], the furthest out part of [[Scotland]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. 
   
 The islands are between the [[Faroe Islands]] and the [[Orkney Islands]]. They are about 50 [[mile]]s to the northeast of the Orkney Islands. They are about 100 islands in the group. People live on 16 of them. 
 
 The islands form part of the boundary between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, and the [[North Sea]] to the east. 
 
 The largest islands of the group are Mainland, Yell, Unst, Fetlar, Whalsay, and Bressay. In general, the [[climate]] of the group is sub[[arctic]], and rather [[bleak]].  
   
 They used to be called '''Hjaltland''' or '''Zetland'''. Today, the islands are part of [[Scotland]]. The administrative centre is [[Lerwick]]. 
 
 The economy of the islands is largely based on [[agriculture]]. The [[sheep]] are known for their fine [[wool]]. Other well-known exports are the [[Shetland pony|Shetland ponies]] and [[Shetland Sheepdog]]. 
 
 In [[1969]] [[crude oil]] was discovered near the islands, leading to an alternative source of income for them. 
 
 == History == 
 ===Scandinavian colonisation=== 
 [[Image:Flateyjarbok Haraldr Halfdan.jpg|thumb|Harald Hårfagre took control of Hjaltland in ca 875.  < br > From an Icelandic manuscript of the 1400s.]] 
 
 By the end of the 9th century the [[Norse]]men shifted from [[Viking|plundering]] to [[invasion]], mainly due to the overpopulation of [[Scandinavia]] in comparison to resources and arable land available there. < ref > James Graham-Campbell 1999. ''Cultural atlas of the Viking world''. p38. {{ISBN|0-8160-3004-9}} < /ref > 
 
 Shetland was colonised by Norsemen in the 9th century. The fate of the native population is unknown. The colonisers established their laws and language. That language evolved into the West Nordic language [[Norn language|Norn]], which survived into the 19th century. 
 
 After [[Harald Finehair]] took control of all Norway, many of his opponents fled, some to Orkney and Shetland. From the [[Northern Isles]] they continued to raid Scotland and Norway, prompting Harald Hårfagre to raise a large fleet which he sailed to the islands. In about 875 he and his forces took control of Shetland and Orkney. [[Ragnvald Eysteinsson|Ragnvald, Earl of Møre]] received Orkney and Shetland as an earldom from the king as reparation for his son's being killed in battle in Scotland. Ragnvald gave the earldom to his brother [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]]. 
 
 Shetland was [[Christianity|Christianised]] in the 10th century. In the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266 the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king surrendered his furthest British islands to Scotland. They included the [[Hebrides]], and the [[Isle of Man]]. In return, the Scots recognised Norwegian sovereignty over [[Orkney]] and Shetland. The islands did not become Scottish until the 15th century, and were  ratified by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1669. 
 
 === Hanseatic League === 
 For three centuries the Shetlanders sold their fish (salted [[cod]]) through the German [[Hanseatic League]], a trading organisation. This arrangement lasted from 1400 to 1700 AD. 
 
 === World War II === 
 In [[WWII]] Shetland was active in covert operations against the Germans in Norway. The 'Shetland Bus' (fishing vessels) sailed in [[wikt:covert|covert]] operations between Norway and Shetland. They carried intelligence agents, refugees, instructors for the resistance, and military supplies. Many people on the run from the Germans, and much important information on German activity in Norway, were brought back to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] this way. 
 
 === Oil === 
 In the early 1970s, [[oil]] and [[gas]] were found off Shetland. The East Shetland Basin is one of the largest [[petroleum]] [[sedimentary]] basins in Europe. Sullom Voe terminal opened in 1978 and is the largest oil export [[harbour]] in the United Kingdom with a volume of 25 million tons per year. 
 
 == Prehistory == 
 Firm [[geology|geological]] evidence shows that at around 6100 BC a [[tsunami]] caused by the [[Storegga Slide]]s hit Shetland, as well as the rest of the east coast of Scotland, and may have washed over some of the Shetland Islands completely. < ref > Smith, David [http://www.fettes.com/shetland/Tsunami%20hazards.htm  " Tsunami hazards " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408071626/http://www.fettes.com/shetland/Tsunami%20hazards.htm |date=2008-04-08 }}. Fettes.com. Retrieved 5 February 2008. < /ref > 
 
 Shetland has been populated since at least 3400 BC. < ref > The Scourd of Brouster site in Walls includes a cluster of six or seven walled fields and three stone circular houses that contains the earliest hoe-blades found so far in Scotland. Clarke P.A. 1995. ''Observations of social change in Prehistoric Orkney and Shetland, based on a study of the types and context of coarse stone artefacts''. M. Litt. thesis. University of Glasgow. < /ref >  The early people subsisted on cattle-farming and agriculture. During the [[Bronze Age]], around 2000 BC, the climate cooled and the population moved to the coast. During the [[Iron Age]], many stone fortresses were erected, some ruins of which remain today. 
 
 Due to the practice of building in stone on the virtually tree-less islands, Shetland is extremely rich in physical remains of all these periods, < ref > Turner (1998) p18 states that there are over 5,000 archaeological sites all told. Turner, Val 1998. Ancient Shetland. London. Batsford/Historic Scotland. {{ISBN|0713480009}} < /ref >  though Shetland is less rich in material remains than [[Orkney]]. 
 
 The artifacts of all the eras of Shetland's past can be studied at the newly built (2007) Shetland Museum in Lerwick. < ref > [http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/media_releases/7220.aspx]  From Chatham to Chester and Lincoln to the Lake District: 38 UK places put themselves forward for World Heritage status.
