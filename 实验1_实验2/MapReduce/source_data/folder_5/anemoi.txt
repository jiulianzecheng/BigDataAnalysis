In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Anemoi''' ({{lang-el| Ἄνεμοι}} –  " winds " ) are the gods of the four winds — Boreas (the north wind), Notus (the south), Eurus (the east), and Zephryus (the west). They were the sons of [[Eos]], goddess of the dawn, and [[Astraeus]]. They were each associated with a particular season and its weather conditions. In the form of horses they drew the chariot of [[Zeus]].
