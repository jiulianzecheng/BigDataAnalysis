 '''Wichsenstein''' is a village in the municipality of [[Gößweinstein]] in the [[Upper Franconia]]n county of [[Landkreis Forchheim|Forchheim]] in [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Wichsenstein is high up in the hills of [[Franconian Switzerland]] between the city of [[Nuremberg]] and the towns of [[Forchheim]] and [[Bayreuth]] about six kilometres southwest of Gößweinstein and fourteen kilometres east of Forchheim. The Wichsenstein Rock (''Wichsensteiner Fels'') towers over the centre of the village. It may be climbed using steps and, at a height of {{Höhe|587.8|DE-NN|link=true}}, offers panoramic views over Franconian Switzerland. 
 
 == History ==  
 The independent parish of Wichsenstein was broken up on 1 May 1978. The majority of its more than 500 residents with the villages of Wichsenstein, Altenthal, Hardt, Sattelmannsburg and Ühleinshof were incorporated into the [[market town]] (''Markt'') of Gößweinstein. The villages of Eberhardstein, Pfaffenloh and Urspring with around 50 residents joined Markt [[Pretzfeld]]. < ref > {{citation
