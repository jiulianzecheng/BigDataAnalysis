 When a lower court judgement is filed, the losing party (appellant) must file a notice of appeal. < ref name=LawCom > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=2412 |title=Appeal |publisher=LawCom|access-date=11 November 2015}} < /ref >  The appellant must give the appeals court legal reasons for reversing the decision of the lower court. < ref name=LawCom/ >  Usually the legal argument includes [[legal precedent]]s that relate to this case. < ref name=LawCom/ >  The other party, called a respondent or appellee files a brief that counters the claims of the appellant. In turn, the appellant may counter the response of the appellee with a final brief. < ref name=LawCom/ >  Then, if the appeals court agrees to hear the case each party argues their case before the court. The appeals court may sustain the original court ruling. They may also reverse the decision sending it back to the lower court.
