 '''Gasoline''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|s|ə|l|iː|n}}, or '''petrol''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|t|r|ə|l}}, is a [[wikt:toxic|toxic]], clear [[liquid]] that is mostly used as a [[fuel]] in [[internal combustion engine]]s. It is made by [[distillation|boiling]] [[petroleum]], a [[fossil fuel]]. In a [[distillation]] process, petroleum is heated to a very high [[temperature]], then it separates into its components, one of them is gasoline. This is an expensive process. It is made mostly of [[octane]] (C < sub > 8 < /sub > H < sub > 18 < /sub > ), a [[hydrocarbon]]. 
 
 Gasoline is sold at [[gas station]]s (petrol stations). In order to burn properly in high-compression internal combustion engines, each brand of gasoline includes [[gasoline additives]].  So, the exact make up of gasoline is different at different stations.  Gasoline is graded by its [[octane rating]] that measures how well it will burn.  Most car engines can burn  " regular "  gasoline which has an octane rating of 87.  Precision-made engines require or prefer  " premium "  gasoline with an octane rating of 93. Most stations offer three different mixtures of gasoline with three separate octane ratings and prices.

 == Uses == 
 Gasoline is most often used in [[vehicle]]s like [[car]]s, [[van]]s, etc. Gasoline can be used in a wide variety of other things that we use every day, such as [[lawnmower]]s, [[leaf blower]]s, and small boat motors. Some larger vehicles like [[truck]]s or [[ship]]s may use [[diesel fuel]] instead of gasoline.  
 
 == Dangers == 
 Gasoline is very dangerous. It can [[explosion|explode]] when an [[electric]] spark lights it. It is also harmful if a [[human]] drinks it or if it gets on the skin. It hurts the [[environment]] and human health by creating poisonous gases such as [[carbon monoxide]]. If a gasoline engine is used indoors or in a closed space, the carbon monoxide can cause death in minutes. Many people die every year from using gasoline-powered [[generator]]s indoors, or leaving vehicles running inside a garage.  
 
 ==Usage and pricing== 
 {{Main|Global warming|Peak oil}} 
 The US accounts for about 44% of the world’s gasoline consumption. < ref > http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013141752/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |date=2013-10-13 }} , http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/international/oilconsumption.html < /ref >  In 2003 The US consumed {{convert|476.474|GL|USgal impgal}}, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/energy-resources/variable-291.html|title=EarthTrends: Energy and Resources - Transportation: Motor gasoline consumption Units: Million liters|access-date=2011-11-25|archive-date=2007-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000755/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/energy-resources/variable-291.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  which equates to 1.3 & nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s of gasoline each day (about 360 million US or 300 million imperial [[gallon]]s). The US used about 510 billion litres (138 billion US gal/115 billion imp gal) of gasoline in 2006, of which 5.6% was mid-grade and 9.5% was premium grade. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_prim_dcu_nus_a.htm|title=U.S. Prime Supplier Sales Volumes of Petroleum Products|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration|accessdate=24 October 2007}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Europe=== 
 Unlike the US,  countries in Europe impose substantial [[fuel tax|tax]]es on fuels such as gasoline.  For example, price for gasoline in Europe is more than twice that in the US.

 ===United States=== 
 Because of the low fuel taxes, the [[retail]] price of gasoline in the US is subject to greater changes (than outside the US) when calculated as a percentage of cost-per-unit. From 1998 to 2004, the price of gasoline was between $1 and $2 [[USD]] per [[U.S. gallon]]. < ref name= " FE.gov " > [http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/gasprices/faq.shtml#History ''Fuel Economy.gov'', FAQ] < /ref >   After 2004, the price increased until the average gas price reached a high of $4.11 per U.S. gallon in mid-2008, then dropped approximately $2.60 per U.S. gallon as of September 2009. < ref name= " FE.gov "  / >  Recently, the U.S. has experienced an upswing in gas prices of 13.51% from Jan 31st to March 7, 2011. < ref name= " taxfoundation.org " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/UserFiles/Image/Fiscal%20Facts/gas-tax-690px.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=2009-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706073258/http://www.taxfoundation.org/UserFiles/Image/Fiscal%20Facts/gas-tax-690px.jpg |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Most consumer goods have posted prices that exclude [[tax]]; taxes are added based on a percentage of the purchase price.  Because of primitive gasoline pumps in the 1920s, United States gasoline prices are posted with taxes included and the taxes are set on cents per gallon.  Taxes are added by federal, state and local governments. (These taxes collect the cost of maintaining the roads.) As of 2009, the federal tax is 18.4¢ per gallon for gasoline and 24.4¢ per gallon for diesel (excluding [[red diesel]]). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/gastax.cfm |title=When did the Federal Government begin collecting the gas tax? - Ask the Rambler - Highway History - FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |accessdate=2010-10-17}} < /ref >   Among states, the highest gasoline tax rates, as of January 2011, are California (47.7¢/gal), New York (47.3¢/gal), Hawaii (45.8¢/gal), and Connecticut (45.2¢/gal). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxdata/show/26079.html|title=State Gasoline Tax Rates, as of January 1, 2011|accessdate=November 25, 2011|publisher=Tax Foundation}} < /ref >   The federal government and many states fail to increase their gasoline taxes over time with inflation. However, some states < ref group= " Note " > California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Virginia [http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/27147.html Rising Gasoline Prices Benefit a Few States]. Retrieved November 25, 2011. < /ref >  also charge a [[sales tax]] as a percentage and vary in amount depending on the cost of the gasoline. 
 
 About 9% of all gasoline sold in the US in May 2009 was premium grade, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]].  Some car manufacturers  " recommend "  premium gasoline but have [[computer]]-controlled engines that adjust the timing to avoid knocking. So, most cars can burn regular grade gasoline but at a slightly reduced performance. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tires-auto-parts/car-maintenance/premium-gas-a-waste-of-money/overview/index.htm|publisher=Consumer Reports|title=Paying for premium gas can be a waste of money|date=March 2011|accessdate=November 25, 2011|archive-date=November 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112103457/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tires-auto-parts/car-maintenance/premium-gas-a-waste-of-money/overview/index.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The [[Associated Press]] said premium gas–which is a higher octane and costs several cents a gallon more than regular unleaded–should be used only if the manufacturer says it is “required”. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/business/personal_finance/081909_premium_gas.html|title=Gassing up with premium probably a waste|first=By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Personal Finance|last=Writer|website=Philadelphia Daily News}} < /ref > 
 
 To reduce the use of imported [[oil]], the US uses Gasohol (10% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures. 
 
 ===Brazil=== 
 {{Main|Ethanol fuel}} 
 [[Brazil]] has the largest national fuel ethanol industry. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least 25% [[anhydrous]] ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new cars sold in the country. Brazilian ethanol is produced from [[sugar cane]] and noted for high [[carbon sequestration]]. < ref name= " WaPo-Brazil " > Reel, M. (August 19, 2006) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/19/AR2006081900842.html  " Brazil's Road to Energy Independence " ], ''[[The Washington Post]]''. < /ref >
