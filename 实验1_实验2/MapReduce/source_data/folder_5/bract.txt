 In [[botany]], a '''bract''' is a modified [[leaf]], especially one associated with a [[flower]] or [[inflorescence]]. < ref > In conifers, bracts are associated with the scales of a cone. < /ref >  Bracts are usually different from normal leaves. They may be smaller, larger, or of a different color, shape, or texture. Usually, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals and/or [[sepal]]s. 
 
 == Variants == 
 Some bracts are brightly colored like petals, and attract pollinators like bees,. Examples of this type of bract include ''[[Euphorbia pulcherrima]]'' ([[poinsettia]]) and ''[[Bougainvillea]]'': both of these have large colorful bracts surrounding much smaller, less colorful flowers.  
 
 In grasses, each floret (flower) is enclosed in a pair of papery bracts, while each spikelet (group of florets) has a further pair of bracts at its base called '''glumes'''.  These bracts are the [[chaff]] removed from [[cereal]] grain during [[threshing]] and [[winnowing]].  
 
 A '''prophyll''' is a leaf-like structure, such as a bracteole, subtending a single flower or pedicel. The term can also mean the lower bract on a peduncle. 
 
 The frequently showy pair of bracts of ''[[Euphorbia]]'' species in subgenus ''Lacanthis'' are the '''cyathophylls'''. 
 
 Bracts subtend the cone scales in the seed cones of many [[conifer]]s, and in some cases, such as ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'', they extend beyond the cone scales. 
 
 
 Bracts that appear in a whorl under an inflorescence are called an '''involucre'''. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many [[Apiaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Dipsacaceae]] and [[Polygonaceae]]. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of bracts.  Many [[Asteraceae|asteraceous]] plants have bracts at the base of each inflorescence. 
 
 The term involucre is also used for a highly conspicuous bract or bract pair at the base of an [[inflorescence]].  
 
 == Epicalyx ==

 An epicalyx, an additional whorl around the [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of a single flower, is a modification of bracteoles. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Nr7W41_P-08C|title=Competition Science Vision|last=Darpan|first=Pratiyogita|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|year=2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Nr7W41_P-08C/page/n105 136]}} < /ref >  In other words, the epicalyx is a ''group of bracts resembling a calyx'' or ''bracteoles forming a whorl outer to the calyx''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.textbookcorp.tn.gov.in/textbook1.php|title=TNTBESC|website=www.textbookcorp.tn.gov.in}} < /ref >  It is a calyx-like extra whorl of floral appendages. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://botanydictionary.org/epicalyx.html |title=epicalyx - Dictionary of botany |publisher=Botanydictionary.org |access-date=2012-04-29}} < /ref >  They are present in family ''[[Malvaceae]]'', the ''Hibiscus'' family. ''[[Fragaria]]'' (strawberries) may or may not have an epicalyx. 
 
 == Spathe ==

 A ''spathe'' is a large bract that forms a sheath to enclose the flower cluster of certain plants such as [[Arecaceae|palm]]s, [[arum]]s, and [[dayflower]]s.  In many arums ([[Araceae]] family), the spathe is petal-like, attracting pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a [[spadix]].
