 '''Torgau''' is a [[town]] on the banks of the [[Elbe]] in northwestern [[Saxony]], [[Germany]]. The town is well known as the place where during the [[Second World War]], [[United States Army]] forces met with forces of the [[Soviet Union]] during the invasion of Germany on April 25, 1945. 
 
 This marked the beginning of the line of contact between Soviet and American forces, but not the occcupation zones. In fact the area surrounding Torgau at first occupied by U.S. forces was later, in July 1945, given over to Soviet forces.
