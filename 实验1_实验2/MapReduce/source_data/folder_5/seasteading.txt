 '''Seasteading''' is the concept of living at [[sea]]. The dwellings called seasteads include [[Cruise ship|cruise ships]], floating [[Island|islands]] etc. No government claims this territory of living. Proposed seasteads could set up [[libertarian]] [[micronation]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2008-04-28|title=Homesteading on the High Seas|url=https://reason.com/2008/04/28/homesteading-on-the-high-seas/|access-date=2021-07-14|website=Reason.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >
