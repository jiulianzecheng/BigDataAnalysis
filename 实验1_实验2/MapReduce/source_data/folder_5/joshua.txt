'''Joshua''' son of Nun is a person in the [[Bible]]. Joshua is used as a [[General officer|general]] against [[Amalek]] after Amalek attacks the [[Israelites]]. When [[Moses]] goes up to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] to get the [[Torah]] from [[God]], Joshua stays at the bottom of the mountain waiting for Moses to come back. He doesn't realise that the people are worshiping a [[Gold]]en [[Calf]] as an [[idol]] until after [[Moses]] tells him.  
 
 When two people named Eldad and Medad become [[prophet]]s, Joshua is annoyed because he thinks only [[Moses]] should be a prophet though Moses tells Joshua that if it were up to him every [[Israelites|Israelite]] would be a [[prophet]].  
 
 Joshua, it turns out was once named Hosea but then [[Moses]] sends him as one of Twelve [[spies]] to [[Canaan]] after first renaming him Joshua. Ten of the spies try to convince the Israelites that it would be better to go back to being [[slaves]] in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] than enter the [[Promised Land]] because if they tried to conquer Canaan they'd get killed. Joshua and Caleb said that if they came to the [[Promised Land]], [[God]] would make sure they would survive against their enemies just like He had saved them from Egypt.  
 
 When Moses dies, he, at the command of [[God in Judaism|God]], appoints Joshua leader of the [[Israelites]]. Joshua mourns Moses for many months after his [[death]] but then [[God in Judaism|God]] commands Joshua to [[Conquest|conquer]] Canaan. Joshua enters the [[Promised Land]] as a [[General officer|general]] kills 39 kings and manages to take over most of the country. He then divides the land among the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] and then dies. There is a book in the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]] named after him called the [[Book of Joshua]].
