 An '''alloy''' is a uniform mixture. It is made up of two or more [[chemical element]]s, of which at least one is a [[metal]]. An alloy has [[property|properties]] different from the metals it is made of. 
 
 Most alloys are made by melting the metals, mixing them while they are liquid to form a [[solution]], then leaving them to cool and turn solid again. 
 
 == Theory == 
 Combining a pure [[metal]] with one or more other metals or [[non-metal]]s often makes it better. For example, [[steel]] is an alloy made from iron but it is stronger than iron. Physical [[Property#Characteristics|properties]] like [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] and [[Electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[Thermal conductivity|thermal]] (heat) [[Thermal conductivity|conductivity]] may not be much different than the [[Chemical element|element]]s (substances) which make the alloy. But, properties like strength can be very much different. 
 
 The first alloy to be [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]] was [[Bronze]]. Bronze is made from [[copper]] and [[tin]]. Bronze was discovered a very long time ago in  the [[prehistoric]] period. Then, bronze was being used for making tools and [[weapons]]. This period was known as [[Bronze Age]]. But, later better alloys were discovered which replaced bronze for making tools and weapons. Now, bronze is used for making ornaments, [[statues]], and bells. Brass is another alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]]. 
 
 [[Melting point]] is the [[temperature]] at which a [[Melting|solid changes to liquid]]. Most alloys do not have a single melting point. They have a melting range in which the alloy is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] stages. The temperature at which melting just starts is called solidus and the temperature at which the melting is just finished is called liquidus. 
 
 == Terms related to alloys == 
 The term alloy means a [[mixture]] of [[atoms]] in which the main substance or the primary constituent is a [[metal]]. This primary metal is called the ''base'' or ''matrix''. 
 
 If an alloy has only two types of atoms, like copper-nickel alloy, then such an alloy is called ''binary alloy''. If an alloy has three types of atoms, like iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ''ternary alloy''. An alloy with four types of atoms is called a ''quaternary alloy'' and an alloy with five types of atoms is called a ''quinary alloy''. 
 
 Different varieties or forms of alloys can be made from the same constituent materials (substances from which the alloy is formed). These different forms or varieties can be formed by using different amounts of the constituents.  
 
 == Some common alloys == 
 There are some common '''alloys''': 
 
 * [[Brass]] is made of 35% [[zinc]] and 65% [[copper]] and is used for [[musical instrument]]s, [[jewellery]], [[faucet]]s and decorative [[Household hardware|hardware]]. 
 * [[Stainless steel]] is mostly iron, plus more than 11% [[chromium]], and various amounts of [[nickel]] and [[carbon]] and is used for [[tableware]], [[cookware]] and [[surgery|surgical]] tools. 
 * [[Steel]] is made of 99% [[iron]] and 1% carbon and is used for tools, car bodies, machinery, [[girder]]s and [[wikt:rail|rails]]. 
 * [[Bronze]] is made of mostly copper and some [[tin]] and is used for boat hardware, screws and grill work. 
 * [[Alnico]] is a mix of [[aluminium]], nickel and [[cobalt]], and it is used to make permanent [[magnets]].
