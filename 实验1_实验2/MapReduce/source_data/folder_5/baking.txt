 '''Baking''' is a [[wikt:skill|skill]] or way of [[cook]]ing food in an [[oven]]. Sometimes, though, baking can also be done in hot [[ash]]es, or hot [[stone]]s. It is used for making [[bread]], [[cake]]s, [[pastry|pastries]], [[pie]]s, [[wikt:tart|tarts]], [[cookie]]s, and much more. Such foods made by baking are called  " baked goods " .  
 
 The ingredients used in baking include [[flour]], [[water]], leavening agents (baker's [[yeast]], [[baking soda]], [[baking powder]]), shortening (fats, oils), [[egg (food)|eggs]], milk, and sugars. These are all mixed together to create [[dough]] or [[batter (cooking)|batter]], which is then put into a pan or a sheet and heated. Leavening agents produce gas that becomes trapped in the dough. This makes it rise. Shortening makes doughs more easily workable and the bread that comes out in the end more soft and tender. Egg whites are used to help make a light, [[air]]y [[wikt:texture|texture]]. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/49594/baking |title=baking (cooking) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |access-date=14 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Baked goods are sold at a [[wikt:bakery|bakery]]. A person who makes baked goods as a [[job]] is called a [[baker]]. It is also used for making [[potato|baked potatoes]], baked [[apple]]s, baked [[bean]]s, some [[wikt:casserole|casseroles]] and [[pasta]] dishes such as [[wikt:lasagna|lasagna]], and various other foods, such as the [[pretzel]].

 [[File:Baecker-1568.png|thumb|[[Baker]] putting [[bread]] into an [[oven]]]] 
 In [[wikt:ancient|ancient]] history, the first baking happened when humans took wild [[grass]] [[grains]], and soaked them in [[water]]. Then they mixed everything together, and also mashed it. After that, this mixture was poured onto a flat, hot rock, and roasted on hot [[wikt:embers|embers]]. This new way of making bread was much easier than the other ways of doing so. This was because bread could be made anytime if there was [[fire]].  
 
 Around 2500 BC [[Egypt]]ians had [[bread]], and may have learned how to make it from the [[Babylon]]ians. Also, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] around 400 B.C. tarts with patterns and [[honey]] was included in Greek food. Dispyrus, another type of baked good, was also made by the Greeks around that time. It was popular. Dispyrus was a donut-like bread made from [[flour]] and honey and shaped in a ring. Soaked in [[wine]], it was eaten when hot. The first [[wikt:proof|proof]] of stone ovens was in Italy, where they made [[pizza]] and [[pasta]]. 
 
 Baking was very popular in the [[Roman Empire]]. < ref name= " crafty " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.get-crafty.co.za/dir_baking.html |title=Craft Directory - Baking |work=get-crafty.co.za |access-date=23 April 2010 |archive-date=11 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511014830/http://www.get-crafty.co.za/dir_baking.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In about 300 B.C., the pastry cook became a special job for Romans (called the ''pastillarium''). Romans loved [[pastry]], which was often cooked for large parties. Baking became so popular during the [[Roman Empire]] that someone who could think of a new kind of pastry was given an [[award]]. Around 1 AD there were more than 300 pastry [[Baker|chefs]] in Rome. < ref > {{cite book|last=Bellefontaine|first=Jacqueline|title=Home baking cookbook|url=https://archive.org/details/homebakingcookbo0000unse|publisher=Parragon Books Ltd|date=2006|series=Love Food|isbn=978-1-4075-5454-9|access-date=14 April 2010|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Eventually, because of Rome, the art of baking became known in [[Europe]]. It later spread to the eastern parts of [[Asia]], too. Bakers sometimes bake goods at home and then [[wikt:sell|sell]] them in the streets. In [[London]], [[cook|chefs]] sold their [[bread|baked goods]] from [[wikt:cart|handcarts]]. In Paris, the first caf√© of baked goods was made. Baking became a real art in the world. Cakes can be actually mixed in just a few minutes, with only a small bit of skill needed, and it can be lifted fresh from the oven in less than 30 minutes. < ref name= " crafty " / >  A basic [[bread|loaf]] of bread may take slightly longer time, but it does not demand a lot of time from the cook. < ref name= " crafty " / >
