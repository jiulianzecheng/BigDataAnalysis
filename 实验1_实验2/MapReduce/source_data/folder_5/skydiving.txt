 '''Skydiving''' is [[parachute|parachuting]] (jumping)  from an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplane]] for fun.  Skydiving can be done individually and with groups of people.  [[Training]] is required.  Unlike most [[paratrooper]]s, skydivers often wait until they are low, before opening the parachute.  The jump can also be made from a [[helicopter]] or a balloon that is high enough in the sky.  Skydiving can be an [[adventure|exciting]] [[sport]]. 
 
 Skydiving includes [[free fall]]ing (usually from an airplane) through the air prior to opening a parachute.   Typically skydives are carried out from around 4,000m (or 12,500ft) offering 40 to 50 seconds of freefall time.  Longer free fall times can be achieved by exiting an aircraft at altitudes much higher than 4,000m, but very high jumps require pressurized air within the aircraft, and bottled [[oxygen]] for the diver.  
 
 During a skydive, total freedom and control of the air can be enjoyed as well as many complex and spectacular maneuvers including flat turns, somersaults and formation skydiving.  Skydiving can be enjoyed either as an individual - doing solo(alone) jumps - or as part of a team carrying out formation skydiving. Usually the term ‘skydive’ refers to the time spent in freefall from exiting an aircraft to deploying a parachute, but skydiving also includes disciplines such as accuracy landings and canopy formation flying, which concentrate on the time spent after a canopy has been deployed
