 '''Suicide''' is when a person chooses to kill themselves. < ref > The word suicide comes from the [[Latin]] words ''sui caedere'', which means  " to kill oneself " . < /ref >  When someone kills themselves, people say that they have  " committed suicide, "   " completed suicide, "  or  " '''died by suicide''' " . When a person seriously considers killing themselves, they are described as '''suicidal'''. 
 
 Suicide is one of the top three causes of death for young people aged 14–35. It is the second most common [[cause of death]] for [[college]] students. Every 3 & nbsp;seconds, a person somewhere in the world tries to kill themselves. Every 40 & nbsp;seconds, someone dies by suicide. For every suicide, at least six other people are seriously affected.(WHO 2000) When people start [[Suicidal ideation|having thoughts about killing themselves]], it may be a [[medical emergency]]. < ref name=EB2011 > {{cite journal | vauthors = Chang B, Gitlin D, Patel R | title = The depressed patient and suicidal patient in the emergency department: evidence-based management and treatment strategies | journal = Emergency Medicine Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 1–23; quiz 23–4 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 22164363 }} < /ref >  They should get a [[suicide risk assessment]] as soon as possible. They should not be left alone. 
 
 There are many reasons why a person might think about suicide. Most people who are suicidal have some type of [[mental disorder]]. They may have a [[chronic]] condition, which has been going on for a long time. But it may be an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] condition, which means the first symptoms of [[mental illness]] happened rather quickly. [[Depression (mental illness)|Depression]] is a mental illness that may affect a person to have suicidal thoughts. Depression may also be a [[Signs and symptoms|symptom]] of other mental or medical disorders. Another mental condition which may lead to [[self-harm]] or suicide is [[schizophrenia]]. The [[Chronic stress|stress]] of life, and its events, like losing a job or getting sick, are less likely to cause suicide. Other causes of suicidal thoughts are extreme cases of bullying and [[social isolation]]. Although depression is the main factor in suicide, it is also [[Treatment|treatable]], and suicide is often preventable. 
 
 ==Risk factors== 
 [[File:Suicide-risk factors-protective factors.PNG|thumb|right|275px|Examples of suicide risk and protective factors. < br > Source: 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention]] 
 
 There are many [[risk factor]]s for suicide. However, it is important to remember that risk factors are not the same as causes. Risk factors do not ''cause'' suicide or suicidal thoughts. They only make it more likely that some people with those risk factors ''may'' become suicidal. If a person has a risk factor, that does not mean they will become suicidal.

 ==Protective factors== 
 Protective factors make it less likely that a person will die by suicide. They help ''protect'' a person from the risk of suicide. They can also help protect a suicidal person from the effects of suicidal thinking. 
 
 Protective factors can be ''internal'', such as a person's personal strengths and beliefs. For example: < ref name= " :2 " > Robert I. Simon: Preventing Patient Suicide: Clinical Assessment and Management American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.; 1 edition (2010) pp.51-57 {{ISBN|1585629340}} < /ref > 
 * Having [[skills]] like good ways of dealing with stress and solving problems 
 * Having [[religious]] or [[cultural]] beliefs that say life is important 
 * Having reasons for living < ref > Malone KM1, Oquendo MA, Haas GL, Ellis SP, | display-authors = etal Protective factors against suicidal acts in major depression: reasons for living. Am J Psychiatry. 2000 Jul;157(7):1084-8. PMID 10873915 < /ref > 
 Protective factors can also be ''external,'' such as a person's [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and life situation. These factors can include: < ref name= " :2 " / > 
 * Having strong connections with family and friends who are supportive 
 * Not being able to get items that are very deadly if used for a suicide attempt (like a [[gun]]) 
 * Having someone who helps the person get the treatment and help they need 
 * Being able to easily get good care and treatment for mental, physical, and substance abuse disorders 
 Protective factors are as important to identify as risk factors. Just as risk factors can be reduced, protective factors can be increased. {{clear}} 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 {{Main|Suicide prevention}} 
 
 Suicide prevention tries to decrease the number of suicides by using protective measures. Some prevention strategies make it harder for people to get the most common things used to commit suicide. This includes taking away guns, [[poison]]s, and drugs. 
 
 Studies have shown that good treatment of depression, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse can decrease the number of suicides. So does follow-up contact with those who have made a suicide attempt. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/|title=WHO & nbsp;— Suicide data|website=WHO}} < /ref > 
 
 In many countries, people at high risk of hurting themselves can check themselves into a hospital [[Emergency medicine|emergency department]]. In some countries or states, a doctor, [[judge]], or [[police officer]] can force a person to go to the hospital if they seem suicidal, even if the person does not want to go.{{fact|date=February 2016}} The person will be watched closely at the hospital to make sure they do not hurt themselves. A doctor or mental health professional will decide whether the person needs to go to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. 
 
 " SOS Signs of Suicide "  is a suicide prevention program used in [[secondary school]]s for students between 13 and 17 years old. The program educates students about suicide and tests them for suicide risk. Students who have done this program make fewer suicide attempts than students who have not done the program. < ref > SAMSHA " S National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. SOS Signs of Suicide [https://www.ammiraticounseling.com/specialities/anxiety/]{{Dead link|date=March 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} < /ref > 
 
 Suicide [[hotline]]s, and crisis intervention centers help students at high risk. They help people who have suicidal thoughts. < ref > Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan.''Abnormal Psychology, 6e.'' McGraw-Hill, 2014. pg. 210. {{ISBN|1308211503}} < /ref > 
 
 A suicide risk assessment looks at how likely a person is to attempt suicide. A good assessment can help prevent suicide. It is also the first step in coming up with a treatment plan. Even though suicide risk assessments are very important, they are usually not done. Many mental health care workers have little or no training in how to do a suicide risk assessment. < ref > {{cite web |author1=Albert R. Roberts |author2=Ianna Monferrari |author3=Kenneth R.

 According to 2007 information, suicides happen twice as often as [[homicide]]s in the United States. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the country, ahead of [[liver disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=2007 Data |work=Suicide Prevention |publisher=Suicidology.org |year=2007 |url=http://www.suicidology.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=232 & name=DLFE-232.pdf |accessdate=2011-01-13 |archive-date=2010-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203222741/http://www.suicidology.org/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=232 & name=DLFE-232.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 ==Methods== 
 [[File:Suicide methods.gif|thumb|120px|Death rates of suicide methods in the United States]] 
 The most common ways of death by suicide are not the same in every country. In different areas, they include hanging, [[pesticide]] poisoning, and [[firearms]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Ajdacic-Gross V |title=Methods of suicide: international suicide patterns derived from the WHO mortality database |journal=Bull.

 * Worldwide, 30% of people who die by suicide use pesticides. This method was most common in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] area, where over half of people who died by suicide used pesticides. It was least common in [[Europe]], where only 4% used this method. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Gunnell D|author2=Eddleston M|author3= Phillips MR|author4= Konradsen F |title=The global distribution of fatal pesticide self-poisoning: systematic review |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=7 |page=357 |year=2007 |pmid=18154668 |pmc=2262093 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-7-357 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >

 * In the United States, [[asphyxiation]] and poisoning are also common. About 40% of suicides in the United States used one of these methods. 
 
 Other people in the world die by suicide by: 
 * [[Blunt force trauma]] (for example, from jumping off a building) 
 * Cutting themselves and [[bleeding to death]] 
 * [[Drowning]] themselves 
 * [[Self-immolation|Setting themselves on fire]] 
 * [[Electrocution|Electrocuting]] themselves 
 * [[Starvation|Starving]] themselves 
 
 Sometimes, suicidal people do something that will make another person kill them. For example, a suicidal person might point a gun at a police officer so the police officer will shoot the person in [[self-defense]]. This is commonly called  " suicide by [[Police officer|cop]]. " 
 
 ==Views of suicide== 
 Modern [[medicine]] treats suicide as a [[Mental illness|mental health]] issue. It is considered a medical emergency when a person starts having many thoughts about killing themselves. 
 
 The [[Abrahamic religions]] (like [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]]) think that life is [[sacred]]. They believe that when a person kills themselves, they are murdering what God has made.{{fact|date=February 2016}} For this reason, many followers of Abrahamic religions think that when a person dies by suicide, they will go to [[Hell]]. 
 
 The Dharmic and [[Taoist]] religions (like [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Shinto]]) believe that someone who does by suicide will be [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] in the next life with a less [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightened]] [[soul]]. However, many people of these religions are more likely to commit suicide because they believe there will be the next life.{{fact|date=April 2010}} They think that by dying by suicide, they may have a better chance in the next life.{{fact|date=April 2010}} 
 
 ==Suicide as a weapon== 
 There are several famous examples of [[suicide attack]]s in history. The [[Kamikaze]]s were one example. They were [[Japan]]ese fighter [[pilot]]s during [[World War II]], who would try to kill American soldiers by crashing their planes into American ships. By crashing their planes, they would kill themselves as well. 
 
 The [[9/11|September 11, 2001]] [[terrorist]] attacks on the United States were also done by suicide attackers. They flew planes into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] buildings and the [[Pentagon Force Protection Agency|Pentagon]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/9-11-attacks|title=9/11 Attacks|website=History com}} < /ref >
