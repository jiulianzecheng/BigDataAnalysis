 '''Parapsychology''' is the study of [[supernatural|psychic]] events. These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment, without the use of the [[Sensory system|five senses]]. They include extrasensory perception (such as [[telepathy]]), influence of [[mind]] on [[matter]] ([[psychokinesis]]), anomalous experiences (such as [[reincarnation|past life experiences]] and [[near death experience]]s) and [[ghosts|apparition]]s.  Such things have been reported for a very long time. < ref > Jane Henry (2005). ''Parapsychology: Research on Exceptional Experiences'', Routledge, pp. 7-8. < /ref > 
 
 In 2005, [[Nobel prize|Nobel Laureate]] [[Brian Josephson]] said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the [[supernatural|paranormal]]. Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as [[telepathy]] and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations. < ref name=thalstorm > [[Michael Thalbourne|Michael A. Thalbourne]] and Lance Storm (2005).

The majority of mainstream scientists disagree with it, calling it a pseudoscience. 
 
 ==Parapsychology terms== 
 * '''Telepathy''': the transfer of information outside of the five senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste) 
 *  
 * '''Precognition''': transfer of information about the future. 
 *  
 * '''Clairvoyance''': transfer of information about far away places. 
 *  
 * '''[[Psychokinesis]]''': the ability of the mind to influence things outside one’s body (matter, time, space or energy) 
 *  
 * '''[[Near death experience]]''': the experiencing of the five senses by someone who has died. 
 *  
 * '''[[Reincarnation]]''': the rebirth of one’s [[soul]] or another aspect of consciousness into another body after death.

 * '''Apparitional Experience''': the attribution of physical events to paranormal. 
 
 ==Why people believe== 
 ===Belief Dependent Realism Theory=== 
 Created by psychologist [[Michael Shermer]]. It states that the brain makes sense of the world by seeing patterns. < ref > Michael Shermer (2011). [http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v305/n1/full/scientificamerican0711-85.html The Believing Brain] ''Scientific American'' < /ref >  Because of this the mind is constantly looking for new patterns to better understand the world. However, sometimes the mind finds patterns where none exist. This is called Paternicity or [[pareidolia]]. It is the tendency to find patterns, even when they aren’t really there. When this happens people often view the world through these false patterns. 
 
 ===Heuristics=== 
 Heuristics are ways of thinking that conserve mental effort that allow quick decisions about a large amount of information. One problem with heuristics is that they are often wrong. 
 
 ====Types of heuristics==== 
 Anchoring and Adjustment is a type of heuristic in which a person makes an educated guess about a question. Then, when that person learns new information they adjust their answer around their original guess. Psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] first discovered this type of heuristic. In one of their first studies on Anchoring and Adjustment they gave divided participants into two groups, gave them one of two problems and asked them to guess the answer. < ref > Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman [http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/teaching/Tversky_Kahneman_1974.pdf Judgement under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528044748/http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/teaching/Tversky_Kahneman_1974.pdf |date=2019-05-28 }} ''Science'', New Series, Vol. 185, No. 4157. (Sep. 27, 1974), pp. 1124-1131. < /ref > 
 
 These two problems were: 
 # 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8 
 # 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 
 1 is the anchor in the first problem and 2 is the anchor in the second problem. The average guess of the group given the first problem (with 1 as the anchor) is much lower than the group given the second problem (with 2 as the anchor). The average guess of the first group was 512 and the average guess of the second group was 2,250. Even though these answers were very different both were very far from the true answer, which was 40,320. 
 
 The Availability Heuristic is used when a person answers a question based on how easily instances of an event come to mind. An example would be living in a neighborhood with a high crime rate and overestimating the amount of robberies that take place in the United States every year.
