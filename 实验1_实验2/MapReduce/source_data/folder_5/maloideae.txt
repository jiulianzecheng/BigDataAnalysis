 The '''Maloideae''' (which is a Latin plural form) is a traditional name for a [[subfamily]] of [[plant]]s in the [[rose]] [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Rosaceae]]). These plants are [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s. The most well known Maloideae are [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s. Recently it has been shown that the Maloideae are a part of the traditional subfamily [[Amygdaloideae]], and most botanists no longer use the name Maloideae.
