'''''Janassa''''' is an extinct genus of [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]]. It lived in marine environments in what is now central [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Europe]] during the Carboniferous and upper [[Permian]]. It is known from teeth and a few poorly preserved body fossils from [[Germany]]. 
 
 It was possibly related to the modern-day [[Chimaera (fish)|ratfish]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 According to the fossils, ''Janassa'' had a body plan very similar to that of the modern [[Skate (fish)|skate]]. However, ''Janassa'' was a [[petalodont]], a kind of ancient [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] related to [[Chimaera (fish)|chimaeras]]. Its teeth suggest it crushed and ate [[shellfish]], such as [[Brachiopod|brachiopods]].
