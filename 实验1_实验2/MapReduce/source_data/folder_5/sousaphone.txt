 The '''sousaphone''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|uː|z|ə|f|oʊ|n}}) is a [[brass instrument]] in the same family as the more widely known [[tuba]].  
 
 It was created around 1893 by [[J.W. Pepper  &  Son|J.W. Pepper]] at the direction of [[United States|American]] [[bandleader]] [[John Philip Sousa]] after whom it was  named. It was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching. It should also carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band. Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or  " buzz "  into a large cupped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player. Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in [[Marching band|marching bands]], as well as various other [[Musical genre|musical genres]]. Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like [[fiberglass]]; today both types are in wide use.
