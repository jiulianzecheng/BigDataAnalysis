'''Arawanna''',Ara-Wanna(I҆rwnt). The [[Hittite]]-[[Luwian]] city-state and historical region of the same name in the south-west of the [[Armenian Highlands]](near modern town of [[Elbistan]], Ablasta in Armenian: Աբլաստա), which existed in the [[Bronze Age]] and was mentioned by king Mursili II in his annals, where he writes that when Šuppiluliuma I was king of the Hittites, the Aravanians invaded the land of Kaskians near «Sammahi». Some translators believe that this may be a Late-Hittite pronunciation of «Samuha», comparing Šuppiluliuma of the mid-14th century BC, who managed to subdue Arawanna and other city-states, which had rebelled against his father, with king Šuppiluliuma of the late 13th century BC. However, in other places of the annals Arawanna and Cascia are not connected with Samuha. King Mursili himself in the fifth year of his reign - c. 1317 & nbsp;BC - moved to the city of Zulila in the vicinity of Sammahi to save the Cascians from invasions near Samuha. < ref > {{cite book| last = Younger| first = K.
