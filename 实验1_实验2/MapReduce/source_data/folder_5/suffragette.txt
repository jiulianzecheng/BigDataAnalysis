 A '''suffragette''' was a woman in the early 20th century who believed they should have the right to vote ([[suffrage]]). This movement happened in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].  
 
 For many years women were not allowed to vote, and so they fought for their rights. In their protests, they ended up getting arrested. In 1913 [[Emily Davison]] died for the cause. In the UK, women over 30 got the right to vote in 1918. This was lowered to 21 in 1928. < ref > {{cite web|last=Myers|first=Rebecca|title=General History of Womenâ€™s Suffrage in Britain|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/general-history-of-women-s-suffrage-in-britain-8631733.html|work=www.independent.co.uk|publisher=Independent Digital News and Media Limited|accessdate=18 September 2016|date=27 May 2013}} < /ref >  Similar struggles went on in all the English-speaking countries.
