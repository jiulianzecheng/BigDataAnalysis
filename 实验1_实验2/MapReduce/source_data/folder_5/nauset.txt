Their neighbors were the [[Wampanoag]]. Natives ate [[seafood]] and the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]] (corn, squash and beans). This was one of the first tribes that European colonists visited. The [[Pilgrims|Pilgrim]]'s [[Mayflower (ship)|''Mayflower'']] ship made contact with the Nauset people.
