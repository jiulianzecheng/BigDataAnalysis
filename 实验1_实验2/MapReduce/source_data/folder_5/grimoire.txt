[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''[[Black Pullet]]'' grimoire.]] 
 '''Grimoire''' is a [[book]] of [[witchcraft]] or paranormal magic. The word is pronounced  " grim-warr " , which rhymes with  " guitar " . 
 
 The word is a mistaken way of saying ''[[grammar]]''. It probably started being used in a time when not many people could read. Then any book might be thought to contain instructions for magic. 
 
 In the religion of [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]], such a book is sometimes called a  " [[Book of Shadows]] " .
