 '''nUbuntu''' or '''Network Ubuntu''' is a project to take the existing [[Ubuntu]] [[operating system]] and remaster it as a [[Live CD]] and Full [[wiktionary:install|install]] with tools needed for [[penetration testing]] servers and [[Computer network|networks]].

Besides usage for network and server testing, nUbuntu will be made to be a desktop distribution for advanced [[Linux]] users.  
 
 == Contents == 
 nUbuntu uses the light [[window manager]] [[Fluxbox]].  
 
 It includes some of the most used security programs for Linux, such as [[Wireshark]], [[nmap]], [[dSniff]], and [[Ettercap (computing)|Ettercap]].
