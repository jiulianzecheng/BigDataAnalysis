 A '''pistol'''  is a [[handgun]]. The word may be used broadly to mean any handgun, or narrowly to mean only a magazine pistol, as distinct from a [[revolver]].  
 
 In a magazine pistol, the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s are in a [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]], which is a metal or plastic box. The magazine is usually inside the handle of the pistol. When the pistol is fired, the empty cartridge pops out, and the next one comes up into position. The magazine is spring-loaded so it pushes the next bullet into place as the empty cartridge is ejected. For that reason pistols are sometimes called  " semi-automatic " . When the magazine runs out of cartridges, it can be reloaded by inserting more cartridges.  
 
 The term has long been variously used. For [[example]], in the [[American Old West]] revolvers were used but were then (and even today by some) called pistols. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/gun-culture/9-misused-gun-terms/ |title=9 Most Misused Gun Terms |author=Kyle Wintersteen |date=22 July 2014 |website= |publisher=Guns & Ammo/Outdoor Sportsman Group |accessdate=29 December 2015}} < /ref >  The word  " pistol "  entered English before 1600, from the French. At that time it usually meant a single-shot handgun.

 One of the most important rules of [[gun safety]] is to keep guns out of the hands of children. < ref name=WP > {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/keeping-guns-out-of-childrens-hands/2015/10/19/ff1fbb14-7686-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html |title=Keeping guns out of children's hands |author=Editorial Board |date=19 October 2015 |website= |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=29 December 2015}} < /ref >  Guns should be locked up and kept away from children and others who do not appreciate how deadly they are. < ref name=WP/ >  Pistols like all guns should always be handled carefully. Always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction. < ref name=GSGH > Grant Cunningham, ''Gun Digest Shooter's Guide to Handguns'' (Cincinnati: F+W Media, 2012), p. 6 < /ref >  A shooter should keep their [[finger]]s away from the trigger until the moment they intend to shoot. < ref name=GSGH/ >  Always respect guns as a [[tool]] that can cause harm if used incorrectly. < ref name=GSGH/ >  Always assume a gun is loaded until you are certain it is not. 
 
 A bullet is not the only part of a gun that can cause injury. [[Hearing|Hearing protection]] will protect the [[eardrum]]s of the shooter and those nearby. < ref name=GSGH/ >  These can be inexpensive foam earplugs or more costly hearing protectors that have a Noise Reduction Rating or NRR. < ref name=GSGH/ >  The higher the NRR number the better. < ref name=GSGH/ >  [[Eye protection]] should be worn at all times while shooting or observing other shooters. Their impact-resistant [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] protect against bullet fragments, stray bits of [[gunpowder]], and other [[debris]]. < ref name=GSGH/ >

 The advantage of pistols over revolvers lies in the somewhat faster reloading of magazines that carry more bullets that a revolver's five or six rounds. This is why most [[police]] and [[military]] organizations use pistols. Also, pistols are often thinner and can be worn concealed better than revolvers. < ref name= " Difference " > {{cite web|author=14 June 2011|date=June 14, 2011|title=Difference Between Revolver and Pistol|url=http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-revolver-and-vs-pistol/|website=|publisher=Difference Between|accessdate=29 December 2015}} < /ref >   
   
 Pistols have a few disadvantages when compared to revolvers. They are more complicated and have more moving parts. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/18/5-advantages-of-the-revolver/|title=5 Advantages of the Revolver |author=Grant Cunningham, Gun Digest |date=18 September 2013 |website= |publisher=The Daily Caller |accessdate=29 December 2015}} < /ref >  A pistol may use heavier springs that younger and elderly shooters may find difficult to use. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2012/10/revolver-vs-auto/#ra_07_phatchfinal-2 |title=Revolver vs. Auto |author= |website= |date=23 October 2012 |publisher=Personal Defense World/Harris Publications, Inc |accessdate=29 December 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Modern]] pistols usually only fire one shot every time you pull the [[trigger]]. Some special pistols, called [[machine pistol]]s, can [[fire]] more than one shot at a time. Some [[famous]] pistols are the [[Colt M1911]] and the [[Beretta 92]].  
 
 Pistols were not often used in the [[West|western]] [[United States]] during the 1800s. They used revolvers. The first  successful pistol being used then was the Borchardt C-93. It was designed in 1893, and became available in 1894.
