 '''Cimabue''', (c.1240 - c.1302), was a painter from [[Florence]] in [[Italy]] who worked in the [[Middle Ages|Late Medieval]] period. His real name was '''Cenni di Peppi'''. He painted large [[icon]]s in the [[Byzantine]] style and was the first great painter in the city of Florence. The only works of art that are known to be definitely by Cimabue are the [[mosaic]] of [[Christ in Majesty]] in [[Pisa Cathedral]] and two very large ruined [[fresco]]s in the Church of St Francis in [[Assisi]]. 
 
 The most famous painting that is believed to be by Cimabue is the  " Madonna of Santa Trinita "  which is an [[altarpiece]] that was done for the Church of the [[Holy Trinity]]. It is now in the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in Florence. He is also believed to have painted two large crucifixes which hung in the Church of St Domenic in [[Arezzo]] and the Church of the Holy Cross ([[Santa Croce, Florence]]). The [[crucifix]] of Santa Croce was ruined in a flood and is now in the church's museum. 
 
 The biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] wrote about Cimabue's life, 250 years after his death. He wrote that one day Cimabue was walking in the country when he saw a little shepherd boy scratching a picture of a sheep onto a rock. The drawing was so good that Cimabue went to the boy's father and begged that he might take the boy as his [[apprentice]] and teach him to paint. The boy was [[Giotto]], who became a very famous painter, and who is thought of as the very first painter of the Italian [[Renaissance]].
