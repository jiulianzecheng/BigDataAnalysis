The term '''Australopithecine''' ('australos' for short) refers to any species in the related [[genus|genera]]  ''[[Australopithecus]]'' or  ''[[Paranthropus]]''. These genera occurred in the [[Pliocene]]â€“[[Pleistocene]] era, and were [[bipedal]]. The arrangement of their teeth, especially the dental arcade, was similar to humans. They did not have the large [[canine teeth]] characteristic of present-day apes. 
 
 They had a brain size not much larger than modern apes, lacking the large brain of the genus ''[[Homo]]''. < ref name=CambridgeDictHumBiol & Evol > {{citation|date=2005 |author=Larry L Mai; Marcus Young Owl; M Patricia Kersting |title=The Cambridge dictionary of human biology and evolution |page=45 |place=Cambridge  &  New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-66486-8}} < /ref >  They were mainly [[bipedal]], but probably capable of climbing and living at least partly in trees. Their arms were longer in proportion to their bodies, and this also suggests their inherited capacity to move above the ground. The efficiency of their walking is difficult to estimate, but they were not so well adapted to bipedalism as humans. The males were much larger than the females, which suggests a family arrangement with a dominant male and several females, as with modern apes. Nothing is known for certain about their use of tools. < ref > Klein R.G.

 They are in the [[hominin]]s,and appeared in the late [[Miocene]]. 
 
 *''[[Australopithecus]]'', about four million years ago (mya) 
 *''[[Paranthropus]]'', about 2.7 mya 
 
 When used alone, the term refers to both genera together. ''Australopithecus'' is sometimes referred to as the  " gracile (slender) australopithecines " , while ''Paranthropus'' are also called the  " robust australopithecines " . < ref name=CambridgeDictHumBiol & Evol/ > 
 
 Other genera: 
 *''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (3.5 to 3.2) mya is either a separate genus of australos, or a species of ''Australopithecus''. 
 *''[[Ardipithecus]]'' (5.6 and 4.4) mya, is a [[Miocene]] hominin. It had a grasping big toe, and therefore could live in trees as well as on the ground. The term  " facultative biped "  is used.  
 *''[[Sahelanthropus]]'', also a Miocene hominin, lived about seven million years ago (mya). The relationships of this species to the australos is unclear. 
 *''[[Orrorin]]'', at 6.1 to 5.7 mya is known from 20 pieces of bone, and its relationships are unclear. ''Orrorin'' is both earlier, by almost 3 million years, and more similar to modern humans than is ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|A. afarensis]]''. The main similarity is that the Orrorin [[femur]] is morphologically closer to that of ''H. sapiens'' than is ''Lucy's''; there is, however, some debate over this point. < ref name= " Pickford-interview-2001 " > Pickford, Martin (December 2001).

 A likely ancestor of the australopithecines is the ''[[Ardipithecus]]'' genus, which lived in East Africa. The genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' ([[human]]s), appears about 2.4 million years ago with ''[[Homo habilis]]''. Australos moved into mixed [[savannah]]/[[woodland]] [[habitats]] as the climate cooled in the later Miocene. This explains their [[adaptations]] to walking or walking plus climbing. It also explains the changes to their [[diet]] and teeth, though not in detail. The great increase in brain size of modern man began with the genus ''Homo'': it did not start with the australos.
