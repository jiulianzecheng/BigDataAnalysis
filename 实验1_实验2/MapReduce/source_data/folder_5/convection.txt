 '''Convection''' is the movement of [[heat]] because of the movement of warm [[matter]]. 
 
 For example, [[atmospheric circulation]] moves warm [[air]] to cool places, causing [[wind]]. Wind, in turn, can enter and cool a room if the window is open. The movement of the [[cloud]]s, the [[ocean current]]s and many types of [[heater]]s are examples of convection. 
 
 == Forced convection and natural convection == 
 Convection can happen naturally ( " '''natural convection''' " ) or because of a moving device ( " '''forced convection''' " ). 
 
 The [[Fan (machine)|fan]] is a device that  produces the movement of the air artificially. The air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan. This is an example of  " forced convection " . 
 
 Natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold, so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part, the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward. For example, if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire, it moves from the bottom to the surface. At the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom. 
 
 == Convection currents == 
 Convection [[current (fluid)|current]]s occur when there are significant differences in [[temperature]] between two parts of a [[fluid]]. < ref name=SC > {{cite web |url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-convection-currents-definition-examples-quiz.html|title=What are Convection Currents? - Definition  &  Examples|author= |website= |publisher=Study.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}} < /ref >  When this happens, hot fluids rise and cold fluids sink. < ref name=SC/ >  This causes movements or currents in the fluid. < ref name=SC/ >  [[Atmospheric circulation]], for example, is made by convection currents.
