'''Barbelo''' is a [[goddess]] in [[Gnosticsm]]. She is also called Thought, Providence, Forethought, or Foreknowledge. She is  believed to be the first [[emanation]] of [[Bythos]]. 
 
 In the [[Apocryphon of John]], a writing in the [[Nag Hammadi|Nag Hammadi Library]], Barbelo is described as  " The first power, the glory, Barbelo, the perfect glory in the aions, the glory of the revelation. " 
 
 The [[Apocryphon of John]] continues:

 " This is the first thought, his image; she became the womb of everything, for it is she who is prior to them all, the Mother-Father, the first man ([[Anthropos]]), the holy Spirit, the thrice-male, the thrice-powerful, the thrice-named androgynous one, and the eternal aeon among the invisible ones, and the first to come forth. "

 ==Relation to other systems of thought== 
 The Gnostic account of Barbelo is quite similar to [[Tantric]] thought. In [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Shakti]] is similarly the second [[Tattva]] or first emanation of [[Shiva]].
