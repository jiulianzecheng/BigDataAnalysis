'''Berkelium''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/bəˈkiːliəm/}}) is a [[synthetic]], [[Radioactive decay|radioactive,]] [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Bk''' and [[atomic number]] 97. It is a [[metal]]lic element and part of the [[actinide]] series. Berkelium was invented by scientists and does not exist in nature. Berkelium was first made by hitting [[americium]] with [[alpha particles]] or [[helium]] [[ion]]s. It is named after [[Berkeley, California]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Its only uses are to create bigger elements and research. < !--== Notable characteristics == 
 Weighable amounts of  < sup > 249 < /sup > Bk (half-life 314 days) make it possible to determine some of its properties using macroscopic quantities.  [[As of 2004]] it had not been isolated in its elemental form, but it is predicted to be a silvery metal that would easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air at elevated temperatures and would be [[solubility|soluble]] in dilute [[mineral acid]]s.-- > 
 < !--[[X-ray diffraction]] techniques have been used to identify various berkelium [[compound (chemistry)|compound]]s such as  berkelium dioxide (BkO < sub > 2 < /sub > ), berkelium fluoride (BkF < sub > 3 < /sub > ), berkelium oxychloride (BkOCl), and berkelium trioxide (BkO < sub > 3 < /sub > ). In [[1962]] visible amounts of berkelium [[chloride]] (BkCl < sub > 3 < /sub > ) were isolated that weighed 3 billionths of a [[gram]]. This was the first time visible amounts of a pure berkelium compound were produced.-- > 
 < !--Like other actinides, berkelium [[bio-accumulate]]s in [[skeleton|skeletal]] tissue.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} This element has no known uses outside of basic research and plays no biological role.-- > 
 < !--==History == 
 Berkelium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first synthesized]] by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Albert Ghiorso]], Stanley G. Thompson, and Kenneth Street, Jr at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in December [[1949]]. The team used a [[cyclotron]] to bombard a [[milligram]]-sized target of  < sup > 241 < /sup > [[americium|Am]] with [[alpha particle]]s to produce  < sup > 243 < /sup > Bk ([[half-life]] 4.5 hours) and two [[free neutron]]s. One of the longest lived [[isotope]]s of the element,  < sup > 249 < /sup > Bk (half-life 330 days), was later synthesized by subjecting a  < sup > 244 < /sup > [[curium|Cm]] target with an intense beam of [[neutron]]s.-- > 
 < !--== Isotopes == 
 19 [[radioisotope]]s of berkelium have been characterized, with the most stable being  < sup > 247 < /sup > Bk with a [[half-life]] of 1380 years,  < sup > 248 < /sup > Bk with a half-life of  > 9 years, and  < sup > 249 < /sup > Bk with a half-life of 330 days.  All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 5 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5 hours. This element also has 2 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being  < sup > 248m < /sup > Bk (t < sub > ½ < /sub >  23.7 hours). The isotopes of berkelium range in [[atomic weight]] from 235.057 [[atomic mass unit|u]] ( < sup > 235 < /sup > Bk) to 254.091 u ( < sup > 254 < /sup > Bk).-- >
