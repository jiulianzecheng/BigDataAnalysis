 A '''regent''' is a [[position]] of [[government]] in a country where there is a [[monarchy]] (like a [[king]] or [[queen]]). As an  " acting monarch "  the regent does the job of a [[monarch]] where the real monarch is either too [[Youth|young]], [[sick]] or cannot do what they are meant to for some other reason.  
 
 A regent may also be [[vote]]d in if there are no heirs in line to the [[throne]], for instance, if the current monarch [[death|dies]] < nowiki/ > with no surviving relatives.
