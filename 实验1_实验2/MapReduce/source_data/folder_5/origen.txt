 '''Origen''' (or '''Origenes''', also '''Origen(es) Adamantius''') was an early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[scholar]]. He lived in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century. He was born in the year 185 or 186, and proably died around the year 254. Today, he is regarded as one of the [[Church Father]]s, but not as a Saint. This is probably because he had some ideas, which were declared to be false later on. These ideas included that the human soul existed before [[conception]], and entered the human body before birth (generally known as [[pre-existence]]). Another idea was that of the souls  [[reincarnation|entering a different human body]] after death. A third idea, called [[Apocatastasis]], is that the reign of god would be restored when the world ends. These ideas were discussed by church fathers, but it was decided that they were [[heresy|false beliefs]]. < ref > Hans Urs von Balthasar, Origen of Alexandria: ''Spirit and Fire: A Thematic Anthology of His Writings'' < /ref >  The [[Ecumenical Council ]] of Constantinople in 453 CE posthumously [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Origen, and the 2nd Council of Constantinople in 553 CE declared ''apocatastasis'' as heresy. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/const2.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}} < /ref >  However, in recent years the idea has found some reconsideration < ref > Mario Baghos, Reconsidering Apokatastasis in St Gregory of Nyssa's ''On the Soul and Resurrection'' and the ''Catechetical Oration'' Phronema, VOL. 27(2), 2012, 125-162. Baghos traces the resurgence of the idea in the twentieth century, and shows that apokatastasis in the Nyssen did not equate unequivocally to universal salvation, a common belief in contemporary scholarship. < /ref >  especially among [[Restorationism|Restorationist]] Christian groups. 
 
 His writings are included in the general collection of early [[Church Father]]s. < ref > For instance, Pope Benedict XVI, in his Wednesday catecheses from March 7, 2007, to June 25, 2008, on the Church Fathers, devoted two talks to him. < /ref > < ref > Benedict XVI, General Audience, St Peter's Square, Wednesday 25 April 2007, ''Origen of Alexandria: life and work''.  [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20070425_en.html] < /ref >  However, unlike many church fathers, Origen was never canonized by the Catholic Church, because some of his teachings (for example, that every man and woman, and even the devil and his demons, would ultimately be saved) directly contradicted the teachings and actions of the apostles. 
 
 Origen wrote about many branches of theology, including [[textual criticism]], [[bible|biblical]] [[exegesis]] and [[hermeneutics]], philosophical [[theology]], preaching, and spirituality. Some of his teachings, however, quickly became [[controversy|controversial]]. Notably, he frequently referred to his hypothesis of the pre-existence of [[soul]]s. In the beginning all intelligent beings were united to [[God]]. In his writingas, Origen also considered the possibility, that in the end all beings, perhaps even the arch-fiend [[Satan]], < ref > {{cite journal|last=Patrides|first=C. & nbsp;A.|date=October–December 1967|title=The salvation of Satan|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=28|issue=4|pages=467–478|doi=10.2307/2708524|jstor=2708524}} reprinted in {{cite book|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708524|title=Premises and motifs in Renaissance literature|last=Patrides|first=C.A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1982|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=|chapter='A principle of infinite love': The salvation of Satan|jstor=2708524|origyear=1967}} < /ref >  would be reconciled with God in what is called the apokatastasis ( " restitution " ).  
 
 Origen saw the [[Son of God]] as subordinate to God the Father. Even though this view of the [[Trinity]] was common at the time, it became controversial during the [[Arian controversy]] of the fourth century. A group who came to be known as Origenists, and who firmly believed in the preexistence of souls and the apokatastasis, were declared [[anathema]] in the 6th century. This condemnation is attributed to the [[Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople]] (553), though it does not appear in the council's official documents. < ref name= " The Anathemas Against Origen " > {{Cite book|editor=Philip Schaff
