 '''Croydon''' is a large [[town]] in [[Greater London]], southern [[England]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is south of [[London]] and is part of the [[London Borough of Croydon]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The town grew up from [[Anglo-Saxon]] times around a palace belonging to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1276 the archbishop allowed a weekly market to take place nearby and this date is taken as the founding of the town. The town grew in the eighteenth century as a [[stage coach]] stop on the way to the popular seaside town of Brighton from London. In the nineteenth century railways put the town only 15 & nbsp;minutes from London by fast train and it grew 23 times in terms of the number of people living there between 1801 and 1901. 
 
 ==Things to do==

 Croydon is well known for having many places to go [[shopping]], which includes two [[shopping centre]]s called Centrale and the Whitgift Centre. A third one called Park Place is planned. Croydon has been rated the 20 < small > th < /small >  best shopping area in the UK. It is also well known for holding a lot of offices for companies to let. The council wants to keep Croydon a big town by building more offices and entertainment facilities so a new place called the Croydon Gateway is planned. Purley Way, just west of Croydon, is a large retail park area which has many shops like [[Comet (shop)|Comet (which went in admin in 2012)]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[McDonald's]], [[IKEA]], Argos, M & S, Boots along with a cinema and bowling alley. 
 
 ==Transport== 
 Croydon is very easy to get to. There is a large [[bus]] station on the edge of Croydon, and three [[railway station]]s called [[East Croydon station|East Croydon]], [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]], and South Croydon. 
 
 Croydon is also served by [[Tramlink]], a [[tram]] system, the only tram system in all of [[Greater London]]. It is the place where all four routes meet. They go to places like Elmers End and [[Beckenham]] in [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] to the east, [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and Mitcham in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] to the west, and [[Addington]] and [[Addiscombe]] to the south.
