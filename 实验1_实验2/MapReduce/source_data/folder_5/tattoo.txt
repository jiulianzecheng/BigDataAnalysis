 A '''tattoo''' is a mark made by putting [[ink]] into the [[skin]]. Tattoos may be made on human or animal skin. Tattoos on humans are a type of [[body modification]] (a way of changing the body), but tattoos on animals are most often used for identification. People sometimes get tattoos to show that they belong to a [[gang]] or [[culture]] group. 
 
 People get tattoos in ''tattoo parlors''.  Getting a tattoo is [[pain]]ful, although some people have more pain than others, < ref > {{cite web

 ==History== 
 Preserved tattoos on ancient [[mummies|mummified]] human remains reveal that tattooing has been practiced throughout the world for many centuries. < ref name= " Oldest Tattoos " > {{cite journal|last1=Deter-Wolf|first1=Aaron|last2=Robitaille|first2=Benoît|last3=Krutak|first3=Lars|last4=Galliot|first4=Sébastien|title=The World's Oldest Tattoos|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science:Reports|date=February 2016|volume=5|pages=19–24|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.11.007|s2cid=162580662 |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01227846/file/OldestTattoos.pdf }} < /ref >  In 2015, scientific re-assessment of the age of the two oldest known tattooed mummies identified [[Ötzi the Iceman]] as the oldest currently known example.

 In some cultures, tattoos have special meaning and importance. < ref > {{cite web|title=Marine Octopus Tattoos Meaning|url=http://tattoo-journal.com/100-marine-octopus-tattoos/|publisher=Tattoo Journal|accessdate=1 May 2015}} < /ref >  For example, [[Polynesia]]n people like the [[Māori people|Māori]] in [[New Zealand]] have a tradition of face tattoos (called ''moko'') which are [[sacred]] and have special meaning related to [[status]] and tribal history. < ref name= " moko "  / > 
 
 In other cultures, tattoos are forbidden. For example, tattoos are forbidden in Jewish law. In the Old Testament of the Bible, the book of Leviticus 19:28 states:  " You shall not make any cuts on your body for the dead or tattoo yourselves. " 
 
 Tattoos started to become popular in the United States and England during the 1860s and 1870s.  At first, tattoos were most often given to soldiers and sailors. The first known professional tattoo artist in the United States was Martin Hildebrandt, a German immigrant who arrived in Boston in 1846. Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the American Civil War. The first known professional tattooist in Britain worked in the port of [[Liverpool]] in the 1870s, tattooing mostly sailors. However, by the 1870s, tattoos had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty. In the United States, tattoos were very popular with sailors. Many cities on the coast had tattoo artists in them. Later, artists such as [[Maud Wagner]] helped make tattoos more popular in the rest of the United States. 
 
 Since the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of Western fashion, common among both men and women, to all [[social class|economic classes]], and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, tattoos have a very different meaning than they did for earlier generations.  In the past, tattoos were viewed as a form of [[deviance]] - a way of breaking social rules and standards. Today, it has become an acceptable form of expression. < ref > {{cite web

 At times during history, people have been forced to get tattoos to mark them as [[Slavery|slaves]], [[criminals]], or [[outsiders.]] The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] tattooed criminals and slaves. In the 19th century, the United States marked convicts with tattoos before releasing them from jail, and the British Army marked [[desertion|deserters]] with tattoos. In the 20th century, prisoners in [[Gulag|Siberian]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[concentration camps]] were tattooed with identification numbers.[[File:MaoriChief1784.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A picture of a Māori chief with traditional tattoos]] 
 
 == Types == 
 
 === Amateur and professional tattoos === 
 Today, people choose to be tattooed for many different reasons. Tattoos may be used to show that a person belongs to a specific group. For example, [[gang]] tattoos may show that a person belongs to a certain criminal gang. Criminal tattoos may also show a person's criminal accomplishments (such as the number of years they spent in prison, or the number of people they have killed). Tattoos, including full-body tattoos, are  < span > popular among the Yakuza ( < /span > [[Japan]]ese [[mafia]] < span > ). < /span > 
 
 {{clear}} 
 
 === Cosmetic tattoos === 
 Tattoos can be used for [[cosmetic]] reasons. Cosmetic tattoos include  " permanent makeup, "  which uses tattooing to make designs that look like [[makeup]].  Cosmetic tattooers can create tattooed [[Eyebrow|eyebrows]] for people who have lost their eyebrows because of old age, diseases that cause hair loss (like [[alopecia]]), or medications that make the hair fall out (like [[chemotherapy]]). Cosmetic tattoos can also cover up moles or hide skin that is discolored because of diseases like [[vitiligo]]. 
 
 Cosmetic tattoos can also be used to cover up surgical scars, like scars from [[mastectomy]] (surgical removal of the breast). The use of artistic tattoos to cover mastectomy scars is becoming more popular in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Cosmetic tattooing is also used to tattoo nipples onto reconstructed breasts after breast reconstruction surgery (where the breast which was removed during mastectomy is re-created using fat from another part of the body). 
 
 === Medical tattoos === 
 [[File:Man with armpit tattoo. Razor Neva, blood type, birth year. Color.jpg|thumb|left|Medical tattoo: [[blood type]].]] 
 
 Tattoos can also be used for medical reasons. For example, a person may get a medical alert tattoo, which warns that they have a certain medical condition (like [[diabetes]] or a severe [[allergy]]). When people get [[radiation therapy]] for [[cancer]], tattoos may be used to mark exactly where the beam of radiation should be pointed. This helps to make sure that the person gets the same treatment, in the right place, every time they have radiation therapy. 
 
 ===Genital=== 
 Genital tattooing is the practice of placing permanent marks under the skin of the genitals in the form of tattoos. Nearly the entire genital region can be tattooed, including the shaft and head of the [[Human penis|penis]], the skin of the [[scrotum]], the pubic region and the outer [[labia]].

 == Health risks == 
 Because it breaks the skin, tattooing carries health risks. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Ultimate Guide to Tattoo Aftercare: Tips for Healing and Preservation – Heart To tattoo|url=https://tatto.tattoo/the-ultimate-guide-to-tattoo-aftercare-tips-for-healing-and-preservation/|access-date=2023-05-14|language=en-US|archive-date=2023-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230514201247/https://tatto.tattoo/the-ultimate-guide-to-tattoo-aftercare-tips-for-healing-and-preservation/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  These risks include [[infection]] and [[allergic reaction]]s to tattoo inks. These problems can often be avoided if the tattooer follows rules of cleanliness, uses certain tools on one person only, and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] their equipment after every use (cleaning it in a special way that will kill [[germs]]). 
 
 In many places, tattooers are required to have training on blood-borne diseases (diseases which can be spread through the blood, like [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis]]). As of 2009 in the United States, there were no reported cases of a person getting HIV from a professional tattoo. 
 
 In amateur tattooing (like tattooing in prisons),  there is a much higher risk of infection.  Unsterilized (unclean) tattoo equipment or contaminated ink could spread infections on the surface of the skin, [[fungal]] infections, some forms of hepatitis, [[Herpes simplex|herpes simplex virus]], HIV, [[Staphylococcal infection|staph]], [[tetanus]], and [[tuberculosis]]. 
 
 Most people are not allergic to tattoo inks. However, there have been cases of allergic reactions to tattoo inks, especially to certain colors. Sometimes this happens because the ink includes nickel, which sets off a common metal allergy. 
 
 Sometimes, if tattooing pierces a [[blood vessel]], a bruise might appear. 
 
 ==Removal== 
 [[File:Scarring-From-Laser-Tattoo-Removal.jpg|thumb|267px|Scarring from laser tattoo removal]] 
 Tattoo removal is mostly done using [[Laser|lasers]] that break down the ink particles in the tattoo into smaller particles. Dermal [[Macrophage|macrophages]] are part of the [[immune system]], tasked with collecting and digesting cellular debris. In the case of tattoo pigments, macrophages collect ink pigments, but have difficulty breaking them down. Instead, they store the ink pigments. If a macrophage is damaged, it releases its captive ink, which is taken up by other macrophages. This can make it particularly difficult to remove tattoos. When treatments break down ink particles into smaller pieces, macrophages can more easily remove them. < ref name= " Removal Method " > {{cite news |last1=Tattoo Removal Methods |first1=Goose Tattoo |title=Tattoo Removal Methods and optional Tips |url=http://goosetattoo.com/the-best-tattoo-removal-methods-and-options/ |accessdate=28 June 2018 |work=Goose Tattoo |date=March 8, 2018 |archive-date=9 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909073951/http://goosetattoo.com/the-best-tattoo-removal-methods-and-options/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Some people who have tattoos wish that they had not gotten them. Tattoos can be taken off with [[laser]] surgery, but this is painful and often requires several visits to a [[dermatologist]] or skin care professional. < ref > {{cite web
