 '''Towcester''', the [[Roman Britain|Roman town]] of ''Lactodorum'', is an affluent market [[town]] in south [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]]. 
 
 The town is about {{convert|9|mi|1}} southwest of [[Northampton]] and about {{convert|11|mi|1}} northwest of [[Milton Keynes]], the nearest main towns. 
 
 The name comes from the [[Latin]] for  " Camp on the (river) [[River Tove|Tove]] " . 
 
 Towcester is famous for its [[racecourse]]. Many important national [[horse racing]] events are held there. [[Greyhound racing]] is also held at the same venue. In 2010 the World [[Hovercraft]] Championship was held on the racecourse. 
   
 Nearby is the [[Silverstone]] motor racing circuit, currently home to the [[British Grand Prix]]. In fiction the  " Saracen's Head Inn "  in Towcester features in [[Charles Dickens]]'s novel ''The Pickwick Papers'' as one of Mr Pickwick's stopping places along what is now the A5 trunk road.  
 
 ==History== 
 
 ===Prehistoric and Roman periods=== 
 Towcester may be the oldest town in Northamptonshire. There are [[Iron Age]] finds in the town, so it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited [[settlement]]s in the country. There is evidence that it was settled by humans since the [[Mesolithic]] era (middle stone age). There is also evidence of Iron Age burials in the area. 
 
 In [[Roman Britain]], [[Watling Street]], now the A5 road, was built through the area. A garrison town called ''Lactodurum'' was built. Two candidate sites for the [[Battle of Watling Street]], fought in 61 [[AD]], are close to the town. < ref > {{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/artsandculture/728896/UK-The-original-Iron-Lady-rides-again.html| location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=UK: The original Iron Lady rides again | first=Byron | last=Rogers | date=2003-10-11}} < /ref >   
 
 ===Saxon period and Medieval age=== 
 When the Romans left in the 5th century, the area was settled by [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]]. In the 9th century, Watling Street became the frontier between the kingdom of [[Wessex]] and the [[Danelaw]], so Towcester became a frontier town. [[Edward the Elder]] fortified Towcester in 917. In the 11th century, the [[Normans]] built a [[motte and bailey]] castle on the site. [[Bury Mount]] are the remains of the fortification and is a scheduled [[ancient monument]]. It was renovated in 2008 with an access ramp added and explanatory plaques added.
