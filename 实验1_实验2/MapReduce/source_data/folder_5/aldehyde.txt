 An '''aldehyde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|d|ᵻ|h|aɪ|d}}) is an [[organic compound]].  It contains a [[formaldehyde|formyl]] group. A formyl group is a part of a [[molecule]] with the structure R-CHO.   It is made of a carbon double bonded to oxygen.  The carbon is also bonded to [[hydrogen]] and an [[side chain|R group]]. < ref > IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00208.html aldehydes] < /ref >  A side chain is the rest of the molecule. 
 The group without the side chain is called the '''aldehyde group''' or '''formyl group'''. Aldehydes are different from [[ketone]]s because the formyl group is at the end of the molecule in an aldehyde.  Ketones have the formyl group in the middle of the molecule. Aldehydes are common in [[organic chemistry]]. Many [[fragrance]]s (smell producing compounds) are aldehydes.

 ==Structure and bonding== 
 Aldehydes have a carbon double bonded to an oxygen.  Because of this, they are slightly [[polar]].  This causes aldehydes to have a number of properties.  One of the most important of these is [[solubility]] in water. 
 
 ==Nomenclature== 
 ===IUPAC names for aldehydes=== 
 The common names for aldehydes are not always the official names.  The [[IUPAC]] names are useful, however. IUPAC recommends the following nomenclature for aldehydes: < ref > [http://www.uwc.edu/dept/chemistry/helpful_files/nomenclature.pdf Short Summary of IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds], web page, University of Wisconsin Colleges, accessed on line August 4, 2007. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_449.htm §R-5.6.1, Aldehydes, thioaldehydes, and their analogues, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_480.htm §R-5.7.1, Carboxylic acids, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993. < /ref > 
 # Aldehydes without rings of carbon are named based on the longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde. Thus, HCHO is named based on methane, and CH < sub > 3 < /sub > CH < sub > 2 < /sub > CH < sub > 2 < /sub > CHO is named based on [[butane]]. The name is formed by changing the ending ''-e'' of the parent [[alkane]] to ''-al''.  HCHO is named ''[[methanal]]''.  CH < sub > 3 < /sub > CH < sub > 2 < /sub > CH < sub > 2 < /sub > CHO is named ''[[butyraldehyde|butanal]]''. 
 # If a -CHO group is attached to a ring, then ''-carbaldehyde'' is added to the end of the name. Because of this, C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 11 < /sub > CHO is known as ''cyclohexanecarbaldehyde''.  If there are other names that need to be added to the end of the word because other [[functional group]]s are present, ''formyl-'' is added to the beginning of the word. ''Methanoyl-''is sometimes added instead, but formyl- is better. 
 
 ===Etymology=== 
 [[File:Formic acid.svg|thumb|[[Formic acid]]]] 
 The word ''aldehyde'' comes from [[Latin]].  It was shortened from '''''al'''cohol '''dehyd'''rogenatus'' (dehydrogenated alcohol).   The word aldehyde was created by Justus von Liebig. < ref > {{Citation|last=Crosland|first=Maurice P.|title=Historical Studies in the Language of Chemistry|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2004|isbn=9780486438023|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwQQaltqByAC & dq=alcohol+dehydrogenatus & pg=PA297}} < /ref >  In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding [[alcohol]]s, for example, ''vinous aldehyde'' for [[acetaldehyde]]. (''Vinous'' is from the Latin word for wine, which is the traditional source of [[ethanol]].) 
 
 The term ''formyl group'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] or [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''formica'' which means ant. 
 
 ==Physical properties and characterization== 
 Aldehydes have many different properties.  These properties change a lot if the rest of the molecule changes.  Smaller aldehydes are more soluble in water. [[Formaldehyde]] and [[acetaldehyde]] are completely soluble in water.  Many aldehydes have strong smells.  Aldehydes will break down in air. 
 
 Two of the most important aldehydes, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, tend to form long chains.  This is called [[polymerization]]. 
 
 ===Naturally occurring aldehydes=== 
 Many aldehydes are found in [[essential oil]]s and are the reason for their smells.  [[Cinnamaldehyde]], [[cilantro]], and [[vanillin]] all get their smells from aldehydes. 
 
 ==Common reactions== 
 Aldehydes are highly reactive and participate in many reactions. < ref name= " March " / > "   In industry, aldehydes are used to prepare [[plasticizers]], [[polyols]], and [[alcohols]]. In biology, aldehydes are used to replace [[amine]] groups and form sugars. < ref name= " March " / > 
 
 == Dialdehydes == 
 A '''dialdehyde''' is a molecule with two aldehydes. The names of dialdehydes have the ending -dial or -dialdehyde. Some dialdehydes are  named after the acid that they are similar to. An example is [[Succindialdehyde|butanedial]], which is also called succinaldehyde (from [[succinic acid]]). 
 
 ==Examples of aldehydes== 
 * [[Methanal]] (formaldehyde) 
 * [[Ethanal]] (acetaldehyde) 
 * [[Propanal]] (propionaldehyde) 
 * [[Butanal]] (butyraldehyde) 
 * [[Benzaldehyde]] 
 * [[Cinnamaldehyde]] 
 * [[Tolualdehyde]] 
 * [[Furfural]] 
 * [[Retinaldehyde]] 
 
 ===Dialdehydes=== 
 * [[Glyoxal]] 
 * [[Malondialdehyde]] 
 * [[Succindialdehyde]] 
 * [[Glutaraldehyde]] 
 * [[Phthalaldehyde]] 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Of all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced the most. About 6 million tons per year are made.  It is mainly used to make [[resin]]s when mixed with [[urea]], [[melamine]], and [[phenol]]. [[Bakelite]] is made like this.   Another commonly made aldehyde is [[butyraldehyde]]. 2 and a half million tons per year are made. A lot of [[acetaldehyde]] once was once made, but much less is made today.  This is because chemicals that used to be made from acetaldehyde are now made in other ways.
