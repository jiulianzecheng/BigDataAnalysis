 '''Weevils''' are [[herbivorous]] [[beetles]]. They have a long 'snout' at the front of their head, called a ''rostrum''. Weevils are a [[Family (biology)|family]], the '''Curculionidae''', which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living [[species]]. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/foltz/eny3005/lab1/Coleoptera/Curculionid.htm | author = John L.

 == Damaging pests == 
 The family has some [[Pest (biology)|pests]] which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the [[boll weevil]], which ruins [[cotton]] crops. 
 
 The ''Ips'' [[genus]], feeding on [[Ponderosa pine]], introduces a [[fungus]] to the tree. The fungus blocks [[resin]] canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for [[forest fire]]s. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires. < ref > David Grimaldi  &  Michael S. Engel 2005. ''Evolution of the insects''.

 The [[maize weevil]], ''Sitophilus zeamais'', is a major pest. It attacks both standing [[crops]] and stored [[cereal]] products, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sorghum]], [[oats]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[buckwheat]], [[peas]], and [[cottonseed]].
