 A '''Koala''' (''Phascolarctos cinereus'') is a [[herbivore|plant-eating]] [[marsupial]]. It lives in the [[eucalyptus]] forests of eastern [[Australia]]. < ref name=natgeog / >   < !-- http://ngkids.co.uk/animals/ten-facts-about-koalas -- > They are the only living [[species]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] Phascolarctidae. < ref > Groves, Colin; Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D M. (eds) 2005. ed. ''Mammal species of the world.'' 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 43. {{ISBN|0-801-88221-4}} < /ref >  They are related to the [[wombats]]. 
 
 Koalas are often called ''koala bears'', because a koala looks like a small [[bear]] or [[teddy bear]]. However, it is not a bear, it is quite a different type of animal. < ref name=natgeog > {{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/koala/|title=Koala|date=11 April 2010 |publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2011-04-16}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.australianfauna.com/koala.php|title=Koala (Phasclarctas Cinereus)|publisher=AustralianFauna.com|accessdate=2011-04-16|archive-date=2011-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231230236/http://www.australianfauna.com/koala.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Koalas have brownish-grey or silver-grey [[fur]], and a big pink, dark red or/and black [[nose]]. They have sharp [[claw]]s which help them to climb. < ref > {{cite web|title=Koala - profile|url=http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/profile.aspx?id=10616|publisher=Department of Environment and Conservation New South Wales|accessdate=2011-04-16|archive-date=2011-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423010221/http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/profile.aspx?id=10616|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Koalas also have finger prints which look the same as human finger prints. < ref name=wighton > Wighton, Dan, Koalas have fingerprints so much like a human they’ve tricked CSIs, 11 September 2015, http://www.techly.com.au/2015/09/11/koalas-fingerprints-much-like-human-theyve-tricked-csis/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912002338/http://www.techly.com.au/2015/09/11/koalas-fingerprints-much-like-human-theyve-tricked-csis/ |date=2015-09-12 }} < /ref >  Finger print experts have had difficulty in being able to tell if the prints are from a human or koala. < ref name=wighton/ >  Finger prints are rare among mammals that climb trees. Scientists do not know why the koala has them, but their best guess is that it helps the koala choose leaves to eat. < ref name=wighton/ > 
 
 == Life == 
 Koalas are mostly active at night. They live in [[tree]]s and are rarely found on the ground. Koalas have two unusual characteristics. 
 They eat [[leaf|leaves]] of  [[eucalyptus]] trees. Koalas do not drink often, they get most of their [[water]] from the eucalyptus leaves they eat. Eucalyptus leaves are [[poisonous]], but koalas do not get poisoned. This is because they have certain [[bacteria]] in their digestive tract that can detoxify the poison in the leaves. Koalas, however, have to sleep long hours because eucalyptus leaves do not produce much energy and also because the digestive process takes a long time. 
 
 Koalas have a peculiar way of cooling themselves. Unlike humans who [[sweat]] and other animals, which either pant or lick their fur to stay cool, koalas reduce their body heat by hugging a tree. The temperature of the trunks of certain trees is up to 9 degrees [[Celsius]] lower than the air temperature. Koalas prefer to stay on these trees on a hot day even if they do not have the tastiest leaves. 
 
 Koalas live alone most of the time, but they have a social [[hierarchy]] with the other koalas who live near. 
 
 After a [[pregnancy]] of 35 days, the newly born koala is about a quarter of an inch long, and is born with no ears, eyes, or hair. It crawls into its mothers pouch on its own. After 12 months the young koala is old enough that it does not go into its mother's pouch or need [[milk]] anymore. The female koala can have another baby then. Young koalas usually leave their mothers when they are 18 months old, but if their mother does not have another baby they sometimes stay for up to three years. Koalas become mature when they are about two years old, but they often have their first baby after another two years. 
 
 == Other information == 
 The koala is not an [[endangered species]], but it is a near [[vulnerable species]]. One reason is the loss of habitat, which means that koalas have less space to live. In some places there are very few koalas left. But there are also places, such as [[French Island (Victoria)]], with too many koalas that eat too much. < ref name=age/ >  Because of this the eucalyptus trees and other animals are in danger. A study looking at koala numbers at 1800 sites for 20 years, shows that the number of koalas is falling. The study, by the Australian Koala Foundation, estimates that there are only about 50,000 koalas left. < ref name= " age " > {{cite news|title=Fewer than 50,000 koalas feared left|last=Morton|first=Adam|date=November 10, 2009|publisher=[[The Age]] |pages=4|language=English|accessdate=2009-12-01|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/fewer-than-50000-koalas-feared-left-20091109-i5dg.html}} < /ref >  there is over 500 types of gum trees in the world, however, koalas only eat 4-6 types that they prefer.  
 
 ==Chlamydia== 
 Many koalas are infected with [[Chlamydia]]. This is affecting the survival of the species. Koalas on French Island do not have the disease, and so groups of them are often moved to the mainland to repopulate some areas. The disease can cause blindness, [[pneumonia]], [[urinary tract]] infections and [[reproductive tract]] infections. < ref name=koala > {{Cite web
