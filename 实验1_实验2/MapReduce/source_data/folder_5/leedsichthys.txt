 '''''Leedsichthys problematicus''''' ( " leeds fish " ) was a giant [[fish]] of the [[Jurassic]] period. Its fossils were first found in England.  
 
 It was a pachycormid, a group of [[Extinction|extinct]] ray-finned fishes ([[Actinopterygii]]). ''Leedsichthys'' is the largest fish known, with an estimated length of up to 16 metres. < ref name= " Liston " / >  The [[blue whale]] is twice as long, at 30 metres, but it is a [[mammal]], not a fish. 
 
 ''Leedsichthys'' [[fossil]]s are incomplete, making it impossible to know the exact length. The fossil is named after its discoverer, Alfred Nicholson Leeds, who discovered it before 1886 near [[Peterborough]], [[England]]. < ref name= " Liston " > Liston J.J. 2004. An overview of the pachycormiform ''Leedsichthys''. In: Arratia G and Tintori A (eds) ''Mesozoic Fishes 3 - Systematics, Paleoenvironments and Biodiversity''. Pfeil, MÃ¼nchen. 379-390 < /ref >  No full fossil is known, mainly because parts of the skeleton were made of [[cartilage]], which does not fossilise. 
 The front of the snout was made of cartilage. 
 
 ''Leedsichthys'' [[fossil]]s have also been found in France, [[Germany]] and [[Chile]]. 
 
 ==Food== 
 Like the world's biggest fish today, the [[whale shark]],  ''Leedsichthys'' was a filter feeder, getting its [[nutrition]] from [[plankton]]. Remains of over 70 individuals have been found. < ref name= " Liston " / >
