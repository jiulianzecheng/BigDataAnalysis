 '''Tanxugueiras'''  {{IPA-pt|tanʃu'ɣejɾa̝s|}} is a Spanish girl group formed by Aida Tarrío and the twin sisters Olaia and Sabela Maneiro. They started working together in 2016 and sing mostly in [[Galician language|Galician]]. 
 
 The name of the group comes from a place name. This is the name of some estates in the parish of Fumaces, in the municipality of Riós  and is related to badgers ('' " teixugos " '' or '' " tanxugos " '' in Galician). 
 
 Despite their repertoire they try to give the pieces a modern sound, which brings it closer to the style of world music or even pop. It also seeks to emphasize issues such as women's empowerment. < ref > {{Cite news|date=27 July 2018|title=Tanxugueiras:  " Somos tres rapazas e somos capaces de levar adiante un proxecto tan ben ou mellor ca os homes " |url=https://praza.gal/cultura/tanxugueiras-somos-tres-rapazas-e-somos-capaces-de-levar-adiante-un-proxecto-tan-ben-ou-mellor-ca-os-homes}} < /ref >
