 A '''cockpit''' is the open space, normally near the front of an [[aircraft]], where a [[pilot]] controls the aircraft. A different name for the cockpit is the flight deck, flight deck can also refer to the [[flight deck]] on an [[aircraft carrier]]. Current cockpits have walls on all sides, this may not be the same for some small aircraft, and cockpits on aircraft with [[passenger|passengers]] have the cockpit separated from the passenger area of the aircraft. [[Motorboat]]s also have cockpits. 
 
 Cockpit as a term for the pilot's space in an [[aircraft]] first appeared in 1914. From about 1935 cockpit also came to be used informally to refer to the driver's seat of a [[automobile|car]], especially a high performance one, and this is official terminology in [[Formula One]]. The term is most likely related to the [[cockpit (sailing)|sailing term]] for the [[coxswain]]'s station in a [[Royal Navy]] ship, and later the location of the ship's rudder controls.
