 ==Summary of the story== 
 
 Miss Polly Harrington is known around town for being a stern, hard woman who is set in her ways. So it is only a sense of duty that causes her to open her home to Pollyanna, her newly orphaned niece. But Pollyanna is a very special little girl, with a very special game that she teaches to the townspeople. Soon, everyone in town is happier, and glad that Pollyanna came into their lives - everyone, that is, but Aunt Polly. But then a terrible accident threatens to ruin Pollyanna's game forever, and everyone wonders who can teach this little girl to be happy again. 
 
 ==Notes== 
 If someone is called  " Pollyanna " , it means they are always happy like Pollyanna is. The  " Pollyanna principle "  means people say yes to positive statements (For example, instead of  " What do you think of green? " , you can say  " Don't you agree that green is a nice colour? " ). 
 
 Pollyanna was an irrepressibly, cheerful child. So cheerful that her name survives in any standard American Dictionary. - 'an excessively or blindly optimistic person.'
