 Wildlife can be found in all [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]]. [[Desert]]s, [[forests]], [[rain forests]], [[plains]], [[grassland]]s, and other areas including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. Most scientists agree that wildlife around is affected by human activities. A [[garden]] is not a natural [[habitat]], but it is full of genuine wildlife.
