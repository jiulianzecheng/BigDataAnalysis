 '''Bonn''' ({{lang-la|Bonna}}) is a [[city]] near [[Cologne]]. It is in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. 
 
 Bonn was founded on an old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Human settlement|settlement]]. In 2021 about 327,000 people lived there. 
 
 Following World War II Bonn was in the [[British occupation zone]]. In 1949 Bonn was chosen as the  [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[West Germany]]. 
 
 Bonn was the choice of [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former [[Cologne]] Mayor and the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of West Germany]] after World War II, who came from that area. [[Frankfurt am Main]] had most of the needed facilities already, so using Bonn meant spending about 95 Million [[DM]] to building new roads and building. However, Frankfurt am Main had been an important city during the war, and choosing Bonn was to symbolise a new start for the new Germany. 
 
 Because of its relatively small size for a capital city, Bonn was sometimes jokingly called the ''Bundesdorf'' (Federal Village). 
 
 Bonn was the capital of [[West Germany]] from 1949 until 1990. The Bundestag voted to move to Berlin on 20 June 1991, after a heated debate. The Federal President had already decided to make [[Schloß Bellevue]] in Berlin his main official residence. The extra building work needed meant it was 1999 before the government's move was completed.

 [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s birthplace is located at Bonngasse. Next to the market place is the Old Town Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It's used for receptions of guests of the town, and as a bureau for the mayor. Close by is the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'', which was built as a residence of the prince-elector, and nowadays is the main building of the [[University of Bonn]]. 
 
 The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'', an alley flanked by [[Chestnut|chestnut trees]], connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''Poppelsdorfer Schloss'', a palace that was built as a resort to prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century. This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Central Station]], a building erected in 1883/84. 
 
 The three highest buildings in the city are the [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] in Bonn-Venusberg (180 & nbsp;m), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' (162.5 & nbsp;m) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' (114.7 & nbsp;m) which nowadays is the new location of the [[United Nations|UN]]-Campus.
