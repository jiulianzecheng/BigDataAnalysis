[[Human]] feces leave the [[human gastrointestinal tract|intestinal tract]] and are removed from the [[body]] through the [[anus]]. Feces are known for their unpleasant [[odor]]. The color, which can range from dark [[green]] through [[brown]] (the most common color) to bright [[yellow]], depends on a lot of different things; for example, different foods can change the color of feces, so can some illnesses, like [[diarrhea]]. The [[consistency]] of feces changes too. In [[human]]s it is measured using the [[Bristol stool scale]], a system for separating feces into 7 different types. It is used for medical diagnosis.
