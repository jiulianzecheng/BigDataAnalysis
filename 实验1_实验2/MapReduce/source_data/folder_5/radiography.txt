 '''Radiography''' is the name for the use of [[X-rays]] to see what is happening to parts of the body. It is an [[imaging technology|imaging technique]] which uses [[electromagnetic radiation]] other than [[visible spectrum|light]], usually [[X-ray]]s.  
 
 To create the image, a beam of X-rays is produced by an [[X-ray machine]] and is projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, which is dependent on the density and composition of that object. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either [[photographic film]] or a [[X-ray detector|digital detector]]). The detector gives a superimposed 2D representation of the object's internal structures.  
 
 == Tomography == 
 Tomography is a more advanced way of using X-rays. In [[tomography]], the machine blurs out structures not in the [[focal plane]]. This gives a series of pictures, like a set of slices through the body. It is called '''CT scanning''', or computer tomography. The computer builds a 3-D picture for the expert to look at. 
 
 Radiography has many medical and industrial uses.
