 '''Arcturus''' (or α & nbsp;Boo, α & nbsp;Boötis, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Boötis) of the [[constellation]] [[Boötes]] is the brightest [[star]] in the northern [[Celestial sphere|celestial hemisphere]]. With an [[apparent magnitude]] of & nbsp; & minus;0.04, it is the [[list of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the night sky, after  & minus;1.46 & nbsp;magnitude [[Sirius]],  & minus;0.86 magnitude [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]], and  & minus;0.27 & nbsp;magnitude [[Alpha Centauri]]. < ref > [http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Arcturus Arcturus (HD 124897).

 It is a relatively close star at only 36.7 [[light-years]] from Earth, and, together with [[Vega]] and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the [[Sun]]'s neighborhood. 
 
 Arcturus is a [[stellar classification|type]] K1.5 & nbsp;IIIpe [[Giant star|red giant]] star, with an [[absolute magnitude]] of −0.30. It has likely exhausted its [[hydrogen]] from the core and is now in its active [[red giant]] phase. It will continue to expand before entering the horizontal branch stage of its life cycle. < ref > For  " horizontal branch " , see [[Hertzsprung{{ndash}}Russell diagram]]. < /ref >  The diameter of Arcturus is around 35 million kilometers.
