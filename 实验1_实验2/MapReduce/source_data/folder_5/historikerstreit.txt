 The '''Historikerstreit''' (Historians' dispute) was an intellectual and political controversy in [[West Germany]] about the way [[the Holocaust]] should be interpreted in [[history]].  It took place between [[1986]]-[[1989]], and pitted [[left-wing]] intellectuals against [[right-wing]] [[intellectual]]s. Its embers flared up again briefly in 2000 < ref > Cohen, ''New York Times'' < /ref >  when one of the leading figures, [[Ernst Nolte]], was awarded a literary prize.  " Die Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will "  proposed by Ernst Nolte, had to be rejected as inadequate due to their lack of sufficient empirical substance. < ref > [http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/dokumente/NeueHerausforderungen_redeNolte1986/ The past that does not want to pass] < /ref >
