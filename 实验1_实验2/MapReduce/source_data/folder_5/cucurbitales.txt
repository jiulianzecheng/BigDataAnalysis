 The '''Cucurbitales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s, included in the [[rosid]] group of [[dicotyledon]]s. This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions. The order includes various shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbing plants. 
 
 One of major characteristics of the Cucurbitales is the presence of unisexual flowers, with thick pointed petals (whenever present). < ref > Matthews M. L. and Endress P. K. (2004). Comparative floral structure and systematics in Cucurbitales (Corynocarpaceae, Coriariaceae, Tetramelaceae, Datiscaceae, Begoniaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Anisophylleaceae). ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''145'''(2), 129-185. (Available online: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00281.x DOI] | [http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00281.x Abstract] | [http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00281.x Full text (HTML)] | [http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00281.x Full text (PDF)]) < /ref >  The [[pollination]] is usually performed by insects, but wind pollination, where flowers use the wind to move pollen from one flower to the next, is also present (in [[Coriariaceae]] and [[Datiscaceae]]). 
 
 The order consists of roughly 2600 species in eight families. The largest families are [[Begoniaceae]] (begonia family) with 1400 species and [[Cucurbitaceae]] (gourd family) with 825 species. 
 
 The large families of Cucurbitales include several economically important plants. Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae are responsible for some food species, such as [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[pumpkin]] (both from ''Cucurbita''), [[watermelon]] (''Citrullus vulgaris''), [[melon]] and [[cucumber]] (both ''Cucumis''). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130.
