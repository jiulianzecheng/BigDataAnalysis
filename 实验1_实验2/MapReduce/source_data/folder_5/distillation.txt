 '''Distillation''' is a process where a [[mixture]] made of two or more [[liquid]]s (called  " components " ) with different [[boiling point]]s can be separated from each other.  The mixture is heated until one of the components [[boiling|boil]]s (turns to a [[vapor]]).  The vapor is then fed into a [[Condenser (laboratory)|condenser]], which cools the vapor and changes it back into a liquid that is called ''distillate''.  What remains in the original [[container]] is called the  " residue " .  This is a physical separation process and not a [[chemical reaction]].   [[Fractional distillation]] (using a distillation column with more than two outlets) can be used to improve the separation.  An [[oil refinery]] uses fractional distillation to purify [[crude oil]], separating several different liquids for different uses.    
 
 This has been used for a long time, to distill [[alcohol]] and produce [[alcoholic drink]]s.  Distillation is a commonly used operation in many industries. 
 
 Distillation can be done anywhere, whether it's in a house or a laboratory, but in most countries it is illegal to distill alcohol without a license. Illegally distilled alcoholic drinks are in some places called ''moonshine''. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10556048| title=Moonshine 'tempts new generation' | work=BBC News | date=18 July 2010 | accessdate=2013-06-23}} < /ref > 
 
 Distillation is also the main way of [[desalination]] of water. In this case the [[salt]] is a [[solid]] that is in [[solution]] with the water. In alcohol distillation or  petroleum distillation, the things to be separated from their solution are two or more distillation liquids.
