 Hachiman is a Shinto god who represents archery and war. He is also known as Yahata and is a syncretic divinity that incorporates elements from both Shinto and Buddhism. Hachiman is said to be [[Emperor Ōjin]] by birth, who reigned in the 3rd-4th century, and was later deified and identified as  " Yahata-no-kami "  which means  " Kami of Eight Banners. "  He is also called Hondawake. The dove is his messenger, and he is associated with samurai banners and symbolizes both the bow and arrow. 
 
 Hachiman has been worshiped by farmers and fishermen since ancient times. Farmers believe he is the god of agriculture, while fishermen pray to him to fill their nets with plenty of fish. 
 
 During the samurai period, Hachiman was worshipped by the descendants of two samurai clans - Seiwa Genji and Kanmu Taira. This tradition spread throughout Japan, and samurai clans began to honor Hachiman as their sacred deity. Hachiman's roles also included determining a samurai's fate in battle, protecting martial arts, and proclaiming the victory of an army. 
 
 Hachiman is a Shinto god who is mainly worshipped as the [[tutelary deity]] of warriors, though he is sometimes referred to as the god of war. < ref name= " scheid " > {{Cite web|last=Scheid|first=Bernhard|title=Hachiman Shreine|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/bauten/bekannteschreine.htm|access-date=17 August 2010|publisher=University of Vienna|language=de}} < cite class= " citation web cs1 cs1-prop-foreign-lang-source "  data-ve-ignore= " true "  id= " CITEREFScheid " > Scheid, Bernhard.
