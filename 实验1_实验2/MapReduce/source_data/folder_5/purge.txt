In [[history]], [[politics]] and [[religion]], a '''[[:wikt:purge|purge]]''' is a removal from a [[job]] or powerful [[:wikt:position|position]] of people who are considered [[:wikt:undesirable|undesirable]] or [[dangerous]] by those in power from a [[government]], another [[organization]], their team [[leader]]s, or [[society]] as a whole. A group undertaking such an action is labeled as '''[[:wikt:purging|purging]]''' itself. Purging is a form of [[:wikt:persecute|persecution]]. 
 
 Purges can be either nonviolent or violent; the nonviolent purges are often done by the simple removal of people from their jobs or a powerful position, and the violent purges are often done by the [[prison|imprisonment]], [[exile]], or [[murder]] (either through [[execution]] through a [[:wikt:show|show]] [[trial]] or through [[extrajudicial killing]] without a trial) of those who have been purged.
