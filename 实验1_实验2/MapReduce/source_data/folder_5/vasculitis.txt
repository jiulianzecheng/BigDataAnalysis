 '''Vasculitis''' (plural: ''vasculitides'') < ref name= " urlVasculitis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary " > {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Vasculitis |title=Vasculitis - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |format= |accessdate=2009-01-08}} < /ref >  is a group of disorders that destroy [[blood vessel]]s by [[inflammation]]. < ref name= " urlGlossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ " > {{cite web |url=http://dermnetnz.org/pathology/pathology-glossary.html |title=Glossary of dermatopathological terms. DermNet NZ |accessdate=2009-01-08}} < /ref >  Both [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s are affected. [[Lymphangitis]] is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis. Vasculitis is primarily caused by [[white blood cell|leukocyte]] migration and resultant damage. 
 
 Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins ([[phlebitis]]) or arteries ([[arteritis]]) on their own are separate entities.
