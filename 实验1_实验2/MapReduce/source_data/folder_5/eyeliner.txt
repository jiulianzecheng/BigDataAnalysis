 An '''eyeliner''' (sometimes written '''eye liner''') is a type of [[makeup]] used for the [[eye]]s. It is applied around the contours of the eyes to create different aesthetic  effects. 
 
 In the 20th and 21st century, the use of eye liner has also been associated with [[goth subculture|Goth]] and Punk fashion.

 [[File:Tomb_of_Nakht.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] women and men wearing [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eye liner, from the tomb of [[Nakht]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (15th century BC).]] 
 Eye liner was first used in [[Ancient India]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun. Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the [[evil eye]]. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including [[copper ore]] and [[antimony]]. Ancient Egyptian [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] contained [[galena]], which was imported from nearby regions in the [[Land of Punt]], [[Qift|Coptos]] and [[Western Asia]]. < ref name= " Stiant " > ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Volume III, (Brill Archive), p.18. < /ref > 
 
 In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like [[Mary Quant]]. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, [[eyeshadow]] and [[mascara]] in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect.
