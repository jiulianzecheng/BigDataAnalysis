 The name Patagonia is from the word ''[[patagon|patagón]]'' < ref name= " Pigafetta " > [[Antonio Pigafetta]], ''[[wikisource:it:Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo|Relazione del primo viaggio intorno al mondo]]'', 1524:  " Il capitano generale nominò questi popoli Patagoni. "  The original word would probably be in [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]'s native Portuguese (''patagão'') or the Spanish of his men (''patagón''). It has been interpreted later as  " big foot "  but the etymology refers to a literary character in a Spanish novel of the early XVI century (see text). < /ref >  used by [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] in 1520.  The word was for the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. Now people think the Patagons were actually [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelches]].  They had an average height of 180 & nbsp;cm (~5′11″) compared to the 155 & nbsp;cm (~5′1″) average for Spaniards of the time. < ref > {{cite book |last= Fondebrider|first= Jorge|title= Versiones de la Patagonia|edition= 1st|year= 2003|publisher= Emecé Editores S.A.|location= Buenos Aires, Argentina|language= es|isbn= 950-04-2498-3|pages= 29|chapter=Chapter 1 – Ámbitos y voces}} < /ref >
