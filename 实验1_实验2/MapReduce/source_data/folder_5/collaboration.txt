 Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined [[role]] in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a [[movie]] a [[writer]], [[Movie director|director]], [[producer]] and [[actor]]s are needed. There may also be a need for a [[costumer]], a [[cameraman]] (if the director cannot do it all), an [[audio engineer]], and a [[film editor]] if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough. 
 
 Not only individuals collaborate; groups also do it. Large construction projects are usually done by collaborations between corporations, wars are often fought between [[alliance]] < nowiki/ > s of countries, and political parties often collaborate in government.
