 '''''Pelecanimimus''''' (meaning  " pelican mimic " ) is a primitive [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from [[Spain]]. It is notable for possessing more teeth than any other member of the [[Ornithomimosauria]] (or any other [[theropod]]), most of which were toothless. < ref > Beaked theropod has most teeth of any theropod - 1994. < /ref >
