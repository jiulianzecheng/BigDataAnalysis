The followers of these movements hold that people should be [[baptized]] after they are believers, denying [[infant baptism]]. This is called [[believer's baptism]]. Infants, by their doctrine, can not be validly baptized, as they cannot decide how they want to achieve [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]].   
 
 They arose as part of the Radical wing of the [[Reformation]] of [[16th century]] [[Europe]]. The best-known Anabaptists today are the [[Mennonites]], the  [[Amish]], and the [[Hutterites]].
