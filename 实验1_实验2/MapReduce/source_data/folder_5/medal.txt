 A '''medal''' is a small [[metal]] object that is given as an [[award]] for doing something important or to commemorate something. There are medals for [[sports]], [[military]], [[academic]]s, etc. Some medals have [[religion|religious]] meaning. The [[Miraculous Medal]] has been distributed worldwide, for example. The [[Nobel Prize]] is a gold medal given to a few people every year.  
 
 [[Military decoration]] < nowiki/ > s, service awards, and medals are often confused with one another. ''Decoration'' is the term for awards which require acts of heroism or achievement (such as the British [[Victoria Cross]] or American [[Silver Star]]). A service award or campaign medal is awarded for serving in a place and time (such as the Iraq Campaign Medal). In either case, an award or decoration may be presented as a medal.
