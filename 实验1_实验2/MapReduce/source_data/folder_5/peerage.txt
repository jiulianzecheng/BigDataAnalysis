A '''peer''' is a member of the [[nobility]].  It is sometimes used instead of 'Lord'. In formal or old [[United Kingdom|British]] [[wikt:document|documents]], the [[House of Lords]] is called the House of Peers. 
 
 ==Ranks == 
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] there are five ranks of the peerage: 
 
 * [[Baron]] is the lowest. In [[Scotland]] this is called a Lord, short for ''Lord in Parliament''. 
 * [[Viscount]] 
 * [[Earl]] - this is an old Saxon word. In [[Continental Europe]] this rank is called 'count', the lord in charge of a [[county]]. An earl's wife is called a ''countess'' 
 * [[Marquess]] - A special rank higher than an earl because a marquess's land was in the Marches, the [[border]] areas that must be defended. A marquess's wife is called a ''marchioness''.  There were not many marquesses in Scotland, and they usually spelled the title 'marquis' like the [[France|French]] 
 * [[Duke]] - the highest rank. 
 
 Informally Barons, Viscounts, Earls and Marquesses are called lords, and instead of their name when speaking to them, the term 'my lord' is used. A Duke is never called a lord. 'Your grace' is used for a Duke. 
 
 Since 2004 a list of peers has been kept by the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]]. This list, called the [http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/resources/roll-of-the-peerage Roll of Peerage] had to be kept to prove who was a peer.  The list of members of the House of Lords used to be the same until the [[wikt:hereditary|hereditary]] peers were excluded. Official documents can only call someone a peer if their name is on the Peerage Roll. 
 
 == Precedence == 
 Sorting out which peer should precede (''come in front of'') in a procession or other event depends on three different things: 
 #The rank.  All dukes come before all marquesses, then earls, then viscounts and finally barons. 
 #Country the peerage was created in.  All Dukes first created by the [[King of England]] come before those created by the [[King of Scotland]].  After this come ''Dukes of [[Great Britain]]'' whose titles were created between 1707 and 1801 (during the existence of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain]]). In 1801, the [[kingdom of Ireland]] joined with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], so ''Dukes of Ireland'' come next, followed by ''Dukes of the United Kingdom''. The other types of peer follow in the same order. 
 ##England 
 ##Scotland 
 ##Great Britain 
 ##Ireland 
 ##United Kingdom 
 #Finally the order is decided on the year the title was created. 
 
 == Exceptions == 
 
 The only exceptions are the [[royal]] dukes, and the [[Duke of Abercorn]]. 
 *The dukes of Gloucester, Kent, Edinburgh, York, Cambridge, and Sussex are the most junior dukes, but because they are [[prince]]s they rank ahead of all other dukes.  In 1952 [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] ordered that her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], would be second only to her. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/archiveViewFrameSetup.asp?webType=0 & PageDuplicate=x0%20%20%20%20%20%20 & issueNumber=39657 & pageNumber=0 & SearchFor=Duke%20of%20Edinburgh & selMedalType= & selHonourType= |title=The London Gazette |access-date=2007-09-03 |author=G.
