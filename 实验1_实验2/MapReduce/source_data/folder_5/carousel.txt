 A '''carousel''', also known as a '''merry-go-round''', is a ride found in an [[amusement park]] or on a [[playground]]. It includes a circle-shaped [[rotate|rotating]] [[wikt:platform|platform]]. A carousel found in an amusement park has seats made to look like objects such as [[automobile]]s, [[train]]s and [[animal]]s. Animals that can be seen on a carousel might be [[horses]], [[elephants]], and [[swan]]s. Carousels are often [[wikt:brightly|brightly]] decorated with lights, paintings, and animals around the outside. A carousel found in an amusement park often moves by [[machine]] [[Power (physics)|power]]. A carousel is also a common toy on a child's [[playground]]s. Playground carousels are not powered by a [[machine]]. The children make the carousel spin by holding on to the [[handle bars]] that are attached to the rotating platform. The child will then run in a [[circle]] while holding on to the handle bars making the merry-go-round spin. The merry-go-round found on a playground will move faster or slower depending on how fast the child runs. In this Wikipedia article, you will be able to find other words for carousel that are commonly used, a brief history about carousels, animals that may found on carousels, and the scientific principles of how machine powered carousels work.

 == History == 
 The earliest types of carousels were most likely created by [[Arabia]]ns. The first carousels were made for adults to ride. Today carousels are made for children to ride. However, the carousel was first recognized as being a carousel in Europe. People most likely made the first carousels in the seventeenth century. However carousels were used in France, to practice a game they enjoyed playing. For this game, [[horsemen]] practiced playing a game on which they would ride [[wooden]] horses, horses that were [[Carving|carved]] out of wood. The wooden horses would be rotated by [[servants]] pulling at the rotating platform. This would be similar to the playground carousels. Or the horsemen would use real horses to rotate the platform. < ref name= " Manns 1986 " > {{cite book |title= Painted Ponies |url= https://archive.org/details/paintedponiesame00mann |last= Manns |first= William |author2= Peggy Shank  &  Marianne Stevens |year= 1986 |publisher= Zon International Inc. |location= Santa Fe, New Mexico |isbn= 0-939549-01-8 }} < /ref >  The carousel emerged as a ride when a [[toy]] dealer in France showed [[wooden]] horses on a rotating platform moved by human power or [[horsepower]] in the beginning of 18th century. Carousels became popular in America between 1880 and 1930. During this time, there were around 5000 carousels built. < ref > {{cite magazine|date=December 24, 1990|title=Rounds|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_the-new-yorker_1990-12-24_66_45/page/28|magazine=The New Yorker|volume=66|issue=45|pages=28–30}} < /ref >    [[Michael Dentzel]], an American who immigrated from German and lived in [[Philadelphia]], moved the rotary platform of his carousel using [[steam]] power or horsepower in [[1814]]. Later, the carousels found in amusement parks had platforms moved by a [[machine]]. This [[concept]] is still being used today. It was invented in [[1898]] in America. Railroads were the first companies in America to purchase carousels for their customers' enjoyment. < ref name= " Manns 1986 " / >

 == The scientific principles == 
 [[File:Elevateur manege nautilus positions extremes.svg|left|thumb|150px|the mechanism used to rise and lower a carousel animal]] 
 [[File:Carousel walk.PNG|right|thumb|150px|The actual path taken from someone trying to cross a carousel in a straight line]]  
 A carousel is set up a little above the [[ground]]. The platform rotates under [[motor]] [[Power (physics)|power]] in the middle and can move up and down. The number of seats resembling horses or other [[animal]]s varies depending on the carousel but there are usually between 16 and 60. The horses on the platform are connected to a pole attached to both the [[floor]] and the [[ceiling]] of the ride. The [[velocity]] of a carousel’s [[rotation]] is about 5 rounds a minute. An average ride [[length]] is 2 to 3 minutes. 
 The [[speed]] of the ride is low in order to keep [[centrifugal force]] low because the faster it turns the more centrifugal force the ride will have. The [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] in the middle has [[centripetal force]], which is the opposite force of centrifugal force.
