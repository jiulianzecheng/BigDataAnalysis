 An '''ophiolite''' is a section of the Earth's [[oceanic crust]] and the underlying [[Earth's mantle|upper mantle]] that has been uplifted and exposed above [[sea level]]. The rocks which make up ophiolites are an altered form of [[basalt]]. < ref > Ben-Avraham Z. ''et al'' 1982. The emplacement of ophiolites by collision. ''Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth (1978-2012)''. '''87''' (B5) 3861-3867. < /ref >  The rocks are often [[green]]. 
 
 They are found in the [[mountain belt]]s such as the [[Alps]] or the [[Himalayas]]. They show where former ocean basins were consumed by [[subduction]]. This was one of the discoveries of [[plate tectonics]]. Ophiolites have always played a central role in plate tectonic theory and the interpretation of ancient mountain belts. < ref > Dilek Y. 2003.

 ==Stratigraphy and definition== 
 [[File:Ofiolite sequence EN.svg|thumb|250px|Idealized stratigraphic sequence of an ophiolite]] 
 
 The [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] sequence seen in ophiolites is caused by [[lithosphere]]-forming processes at [[mid-oceanic ridge]]s: 
 
 * Sediments: muds (black [[shale]]) and [[chert]]s deposited after the crust formed. 
 * Extrusive sequence: [[basalt]]  " pillow [[lava]]s "  show [[magma]]/seawater contact. 
 * Vertical, parallel [[dike (geology)|dikes]] fed lavas above. 
 * [[Gabbro]]s from minerals settling from a [[magma]] chamber. 
 * [[Peridotite]]: [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] rock minerals, heated and pressured in [[orogeny]] (mountain-building). 
 
 ==Notable ophiolites== 
 *In the [[California Coast Ranges]], from Santa Barbara through San Francisco Counties, [[California]]. 
 *In [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], widely considered one of the best exposed ophiolite sequences 
 * [[Macquarie Island]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]] was named a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997, as the only known example of an ophiolite complex in the process of being formed and currently in its original geological setting. 
 * In [[Gros Morne National Park]], [[Newfoundland]], named a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1987 because of its superbly exposed complete ophiolite stratigraphic sequence
