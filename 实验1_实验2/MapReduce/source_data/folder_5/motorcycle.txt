It does not have 4 wheels like a [[car]]. It has 2 wheels like a [[bicycle]], and it has a [[motor]] like a car. A motorcycle is usually driven by one person. A [[passenger]] can also ride on the back of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles have a sidecar that can carry another passenger.''' < /big > < /u > '' 
 
 ''''' < big > On-road bikes (ones that are allowed on public roads) require the rider to have a special type of driver's [[license]] to be ridden legally. Off-road bikes are not allowed to be driven on public roads. < /big > '''''

 < u > < big > Since motorcycles are lighter than almost all cars, they can [[accelerate]] more quickly. But it also makes them not as safe as cars, because they do not have a protecting chassis around them like cars. Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in [[accident]]s. Motorcycle riders should wear a [[helmet]] and other protective clothing like shoes and gloves, of which some have [[armor]]. This special clothing may reduce the rider's injuries in an accident. Motorcycles also do not protect riders against wind and rain. That makes it difficult to drive in winter or during bad weather. < /big > < /u > ''''' 
 
 ''''' < u > < big > In poor countries, motorcycles are used by many as a cheap method of transportation. Many people who do not have the money to buy a car can afford a small motorcycle. In rich countries, large powerful motorcycles are used more as a [[hobby]] or [[Motor sports|sport]]. < /big > < /u > '''''
