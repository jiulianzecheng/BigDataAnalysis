 '''Musette''' is the [[French language|French]] word for small bellows played [[bagpipes]]. Some [[composer]]s liked to use a drone (especially one in fifths) to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Fran√ßois Couperin]] and other [[Baroque]] composers often called such pieces  " Musette " . Sometimes they did this in orchestral music: [[Joseph Haydn]] used a drone in the last part of his Symphony No. 104 to accompany a folk tune.
