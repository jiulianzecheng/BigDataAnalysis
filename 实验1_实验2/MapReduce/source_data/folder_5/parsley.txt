 '''Parsley''' is a fresh [[flavor]]ed bright [[green]] [[herb]]. It used on [[food]] as a [[garnish]] and as a [[seasoning]] in [[soup]]s,sauces and [[salad]]s. Some people eat parsley to get their breath to smell better. Parsley can be easily grown in gardens, as well as inside the home, wherever there is plenty of indirect sunlight. Parsley needs good, light [[soil]], good drainage and frequent watering to thrive indoors. To [[harvest]] parsely, cut the most mature stalks near the base that are still bright green. New shoots will grow for some time from the base of an established plant. Parsley is extraordinarily rich in [[Vitamin C|vitamins C]] and A,  [[minerals]] (especially potassium),[[beta-carotene]], folate and [[dietary fiber]].
