'''Oestradiol''', E2, is an [[oestrogen]], a [[steroid]]al [[hormone]] secreted by the [[Ovary|ovaries]]. It is a main female hormone. Oestradiol regulates  female characteristics, the maturation of female sex [[organ]]s and the  [[oestrus]] and [[menstrual cycle]]. It stimulates the production of [[mammary gland]]s. 
 
 The [[Serum (blood)|serum]] concentrations of oestradiol and other female hormones change during the menstrual cycle. During [[gestation]] there is a high serum concentrations of oestradiol, E3. During [[menopause]], oestrone has the higher concentration. 
 
 Oestradiol and [[oestrone]] can interchange. Oestradiol has a big effect on [[bone]] formation. Women past menopause have an accelerated loss of bone because they have less oestrogen. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Albright, Fuller; Smith, Patricia H.  &  Richardson Anna M. 1941. |title=Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: Its Clinical Features|journal=JAMA |date=31 May 1941 |volume=116|issue=22|pages=2465â€“2474|doi=10.1001/jama.1941.02820220007002|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=249029|access-date=20 November 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 Oestradiol also has some functions in males. Its serum concentration in men is  <  35 pg/mL, level equivalent to that seen in post-menopausal women.
