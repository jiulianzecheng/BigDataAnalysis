 == Primary care == 
 A [[primary care doctor]] ('''PCD''') or '''primary care physician''' ('''PCP''') is a [[Medical doctor|doctor]] who provides general medical care. These doctors can answer health concerns and medical conditions a patient may have. They also can prescribe [[medicine]] for their patients, based on information gathered. 
 
 == Hospitals == 
 In most countries most of the money goes on hospital services. 
 
 == Mental health == 
 [[Mental illness]] is in most places treated separately from physical illness.  It was, and in some places still is, given a religious explanation.  People were sent to [[workhouse]] < nowiki/ > s or [[asylum]] < nowiki/ > s if they were thought to be dangerous to themselves or other people.  By the 19th century many of them were very large. There was very little involvement by doctors until  the 20th century when [[psychiatry]] developed. The [[classification of mental disorders]] has been, and still is, [[controversial]].  Mental health services generally get less attention and money than those for physical illness. Abuse of patients is not uncommon. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Townsend|first=Emily|date=2022-10-11|title=Mental Health Matters: Edenfield and Essex scandals are not one-offs|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/mental-health/mental-health-matters-edenfield-and-essex-scandals-are-not-one-offs/7033408.article|access-date=2023-02-11|website=Health Service Journal|language=en}} < /ref >   People are often sent a long way from home. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|date=2022-11-04|title=Daily Insight: A long way from home|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/daily-insight/daily-insight-a-long-way-from-home/7033589.article|access-date=2023-02-11|website=Health Service Journal|language=en}} < /ref >  People may have to wait a lot longer for help in the [[community]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Townsend|first=Emily|date=2022-11-08|title=Mental Health Matters: Ministersâ€™ big call on a public inquiry|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/mental-health/mental-health-matters-ministers-big-call-on-a-public-inquiry/7033602.article|access-date=2023-02-11|website=Health Service Journal|language=en}} < /ref >
