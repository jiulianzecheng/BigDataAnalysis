'''Trndez''', also known as '''Tyarnndarach''' and '''Candlemas Day''', is a special event in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and [[Armenian Catholic Churche]]s. It takes place 40 days after the birth of [[Jesus]]. The two churches celebrate Trndez on different days, either on the 13th of February (with celebrations on the eve of the 14th) or on the 2nd of February. 
 
 Trndez has its roots in Zoroastrian traditions and was originally associated with sun and fire worship in [[ancient Armenia]] before the arrival of [[Christianity]]. It symbolized the arrival of spring and fertility. After the adoption of Christianity, the holiday took on a new meaning, representing eternal and strong love. It is believed that if a couple jumps over a bonfire while holding hands, their love and bond will last forever. Another belief is that jumping over the bonfire can cure illnesses and purify sinners. Some also think that an infertile woman can become fertile by jumping over the bonfire. 
 
 Although Trndez has its origins in Hellenistic culture, it has evolved into a Christian holiday over time. The alternative name, Tyarnndarach, translates to  " towards the God "  in Armenian. Even today, Trndez is widely celebrated by Armenians and the Armenian Apostolic Church.
