 Kelp plays an important role as food and [[habitat]] for fish and other forms. It may be eaten as a [[vegetable]]. 
 
 Kelp is found in many places. People put it in aquariums. In the Monterey Aquarium there is a large forest of kelp. 
 
 In some parts of the [[Pacific Ocean]], sea urchins have eaten so much kelp that the kelp forests become [[urchin barren]]s. < ref name= " NHMag " > {{cite magazine|title=Underwater Barrens: Monitoring the fate of Southern Californian kelp requires a long view.|date=February 2017|author=Doug Simpson|url=https://naturalhistorymag.com/features/153361/underwater-barrens|accessdate=May 22, 2020|publisher=Natural History Magazine}} < /ref >
