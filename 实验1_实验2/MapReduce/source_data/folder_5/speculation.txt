 {{Wiktionary|speculation}} 
 '''Speculation''' has a special meaning when talking about money. The person who speculates is called a '''speculator'''. A speculator does not buy [[Goodsprings, Nevada|goods]] to own them, but to sell them later. The reason is that he wants to make a [[profit]] from the change in [[price]].  
 
 One tries to buy the goods when they are cheap and to sell them when they are expensive. There is a good chance to profit as long as the market price of a good changes often in different directions. 
 
 Speculation includes the [[trade|buying, holding, selling, and short-selling]] of [[stock]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], [[commodity|commodities]], [[currency|currencies]], [[collectible]]s, [[real estate]], [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] or any valuable [[financial instrument]]. It is the opposite of buying because one wants to use them for daily life or to get [[income]] from them (as [[dividend]]s or [[interest]]).  
 
 Speculation is one of the biggest [[market]] roles in western [[financial markets]]. The others are [[hedging]], long term [[investing]] and [[arbitrage]].  Speculators do not plan to keep an [[asset]] for a long time. < ref > Macquarie Bank.
