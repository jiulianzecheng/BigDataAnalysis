 The '''Aztecs''' were [[Native American]] people who lived in [[Mesoamerica]]. They ruled the [[Aztec Empire]] from the [[14th century]] to the [[16th century]]. < ref > Berdan, Frances (1982).

 The name  " Aztec "  comes from the phrase  " people from Aztlan " . [[Legend]]s say that Aztlan was the first place the Aztecs ever lived.   " Aztlan "  means  " place of the [[heron]]s "  in the [[Nahuatl language]]. < ref name=somervill > Somervill, Barbara A. (2009). ''Great Empires of the Past: Empire of the Aztecs.''

 Often the term  " Aztec "  refers just to the people of [[Tenochtitlan]]. This was a city on an [[island]] in [[Lake Texcoco]]. These people called themselves the [[Mexica]] which is why the country is called [[Mexico]], or the [[Nahua]] which is why their [[language]] is called Nahuatl. < ref > Hansen, Valerie;  &  Curtis, Kenneth R.

 == History == 
 Before the Aztec Empire conquered them, the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous (native) people]]  lived in many separate [[city-state]]s.  These were small [[city|cities]] with [[farm]]land around them.  Each state had its own ruler.  Around [[1100]] AD, these city-states started to fight each other for power and control of the area's resources. < ref name= " ancientcities " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46918564|title=Mesoamerica's ancient cities : aerial views of pre-Columbian ruins in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras|last=Ferguson|first=William M.|date=2001|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=0-8263-2800-8|edition=Rev.|location=Albuquerque|oclc=46918564}} < /ref > 
 
 Historians think the Aztecs came to central Mesoamerica around 1200. < ref name=lt > Trumbauer, Lisa (2005). ''The Aztec World.'' Benchmark Education Company. p. 20. {{ISBN|978-1410846181}}. < /ref >   They came from what is now northwest [[Mexico]].  According to historian Lisa Marty: 
 
 {{cquote|''When the  " Mexica "  arrived sometime in the 1200s A.D. in Central [Mesoamerica], they were [seen] as [[wikt:crude|crude]] [[barbarian]]s.  Wearing animal skins and living as [[hunter-gatherer]]s[,] their lifestyle clashed with the settled agrarian [farm-based] communities of the area.  At first, they lived as wanderers eating [[snake]]s and [[vermin]] ... For about 100 years, the Aztecs lived like outcasts wandering in the Central Valley.  Thrown out of one [[territory]] after another, they were forced to eke out an existence in a place where no one else wanted to live: on a group of small, [[swamp]]y [[island]]s in the middle of ... Lake Texcoco[.]  < ref name=lm > Marty, Lisa (2006). Ancient Aztecs. Lorenz Educational Press. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0787783259}}. < /ref > ''}} 
 
 By [[1325]], the Aztecs had built Tenochtitlan on an island in Lake Texcoco.  Tenochtitlan became a city-state that gradually became more and more powerful. < ref name=lm/ > 
 
 By about [[1400]], three city-states had grown into small empires.  In [[1428]], these two empires fought the [[Tepanec War]] for control of the area.  The Texcoco empire made an [[alliance]] with some other powerful city-states, including Tenochtitlan, and won the war.  These [[ally|allies]] were supposed to share power equally as they started to gain control of more land.  However, by [[1430]], Tenochtitlan became the most powerful member of the alliance.  It became the [[capital city]] of the Aztec Empire, and its ruler became the 'high [[king]]' of the Empire. < ref > {{cite book |author=Chazan, Michael |date=October 5, 2015 |title=World Prehistory and Archaeology: Pathways Through Time |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=363 |isbn=978-1317347514}} < /ref >

 {{Main|Aztec Empire}} 
 
 The Aztec Empire existed between about [[1438]] [[AD]] and [[1521]] AD. < ref name=lt/ >   When the Empire was largest, it spread across most of [[Mesoamerica]] and controlled about 11,000,000 people. < ref name=soc/ > 
 
 === Tenochtitlan === 
 {{Main|Tenochtitlan}} 
 Tenochtitlan was the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of the Aztec Empire. Tenochtitlan was one of the greatest cities of the world in that time.  By the early [[16th century|1500s]], at least 200,000 people lived in the city.  This made Tenochtitlan the largest city in the [[Americas]] before [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived. < ref name=prehx/ > 
 
 [[Mexico City]] now covers the whole area where Tenochtitlan used to be. < ref > Evans, Susan Toby (2005).  " The Aztec Palace Under Spanish Rule.

 == Religion == 
 The Aztecs believed in [[polytheism|many gods]]. Two of the most important gods they [[worship]]ped were ''[[Huitzilopochtli]]'', the god of [[war]] and the [[sun]], and ''[[Tlaloc]]'', the [[rain]] god. < ref name=civ > {{cite web |url=http://www.ancient.eu/Aztec_Civilization/ |title=Aztec Civilization |author=Cartwright, Mark |date=February 26, 2014 |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >  Another important god was ''[[Quetzalcoatl]]'' (feathered [[snake]]), the god of learning and [[civilization]]. < ref name=ind > {{cite web |url=http://www.indians.org/welker/aztec.htm |title=The Aztecs/Mexicas |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2015 |website= |publisher=The American Indian Heritage Foundation |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 The Aztecs did many things to keep the gods happy. These things included [[human sacrifice]]s. < ref > Carrasco, David 1999. ''City of Sacrifice: The Aztec Empire and the Role of Violence in Civilization''. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4642-6}} < /ref >   They believed this helped keep the world from ending. < ref name=civ/ >   The Aztecs believed that the gods had created them, and that human sacrifice was the most powerful way of giving back the gift of [[life]]. The Aztecs also believed that the gods were in an almost never-ending struggle. The [[heart]]s and [[blood]] from the sacrifice fed the good gods to give them strength to fight the [[evil]] gods. The human sacrifices often took place on the [[Templo Mayor]], the Aztecs' great [[pyramid]] [[temple]]. < ref name=civ/ > < ref name= " marder " > {{cite book|url=|title=Indians in the Americas|author=Marder, William|date=2005|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1585091041|editor=Paul Tice|location=|page=16-17}} < /ref >

 == Food == 
 The Aztecs ate [[plant]]s and [[vegetable]]s that could grow easily in Mesoamerica. The main foods in the Aztec diet were [[maize]], beans, and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. They often used [[tomato]]es and [[chili pepper|chili]] as [[spice]]s. < ref > Ortiz de Montellano, Bernard R. (1990). ''Aztec Medicine, Health and Nutrition.'' [[New Brunswick]]: Rutgers University Press. p. 100. {{ISBN|0-8135-1562-9}}. < /ref >   Aztec [[market]]s sold [[fruit]], vegetables, [[spice]]s, [[flower]]s, [[dog]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[cocoa]] beans. They also created [[chocolate]]. However, they did not have [[sugar]], so their chocolate was a strong liquid with [[Chili pepper|chili]] in it. < ref name=dwyer/ >  They also made an [[alcoholic drink]] called chocolatl. < ref > Szogyi, Alex (1997).

 == Social structure == 
 In Aztec [[society]], there were different [[social class]]es with different [[social status]]es.  The most important people were the rulers. < ref name=soc/ >   The Aztecs' first king was Acamapichtli. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/aztecs|title=Ask History: What Happened to the Aztecs?|first=|last=|date=2009|website=The History Channel|publisher=A & E Television Networks, LLC|accessdate=May 18, 2016}} < /ref >   Their last king was [[Cuauhtemoc]].

 Next were [[nobleman|nobles]].  These were the Empire's powerful members of the government; great [[warrior]]s; [[judge]]s; and [[priest]]s. < ref name=soc > {{cite web |url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/845/ |title=Aztec Society |author=Cartwright, Mark |date=November 23, 2015 |website=Ancient History Encyclopedia |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia Limited |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   These people enjoyed a high social status. < ref name=td > {{cite web |url=http://tribaldirectory.com/information/aztec-indians.html |title=Aztec Indians |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website= |publisher=Tribal Directory |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 The next social class was the commoners (common people).  These were the Empire's everyday workers.  Most of them [[farmer|farmed]], ran stores, or traded.  Other workers included [[artisan]]s, regular [[soldier]]s, and [[fisherman|fishers]].  Commoners were allowed to own land as a group or a family.  However, a single person was not allowed to own land. < ref name=td/ > 
 
 The lowest social classes in Aztec society were [[serfdom|serfs]] and then slaves.  Slaves had no [[rights]] at all.  They were bought and sold at Aztec markets. < ref name= " prehx " > {{cite book|url=|title=People of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory|author=Fagan, Brian|last2=Durrani, Nadia|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317346821|location=|page=443-447}} < /ref >   The Aztecs also [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] some prisoners of war to their gods. < ref name=vt > {{cite book |author=van Teurenhout, Dirk R. |date=2005 |title=The Aztecs: New Perspectives |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=157 |isbn=978-1576079218}} < /ref >   However, if they had the money, they could buy their own freedom and become commoners. < ref name=td > {{cite web |url=http://tribaldirectory.com/information/aztec-indians.html |title=Aztec Indians |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website= |publisher=Tribal Directory |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 For most of the Aztec Empire's existence, it was very difficult to move between social classes.  Usually, if a person was born in a social class, they would stay in that class for the rest of their life. < ref name=soc/ > 
 
 Aztecs had harsh [[punishment]]s for [[crime]]s that seem simple to us now. For example, a person could get the [[death penalty]] for [[adultery]]; cutting down a living [[tree]]; moving the [[Border|boundary]] of a field to make their land bigger and someone else's smaller; major [[theft]]; [[treason]]; disorderly conduct (causing trouble in public), [[drunkenness]]; and [[promiscuity]]. Under Aztec sumptuary law, a commoner could also get the death penalty for wearing [[cotton]]. < ref name=somervill/ > < ref name=td/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;88 < /sup >

 ==Education== 
 {{Main|Aztec Empire#Society#Education}} 
 The Aztecs studied [[astrology]] and used the movements of the [[planet]]s and the [[star]]s to create different [[calendar]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mesolore.org/tutorials/learn/13/Keeping-Time |title=Keeping Time |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=Explore Mesolore |publisher=Prolarti Enterprise, LLC and [[Brown University]] |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   They had an accurate [[calendar]] which consisted of 365 days, based on the movements of the sun.

 The Aztecs also studied and taught many complex subjects, including [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[debate]], [[law]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[architecture]], and [[agriculture]]. < ref > {{cite book |author=Seaman, Rebecca M. |date=August 27, 2013 |title=Conflict in the Early Americas: An Encyclopedia of the Spanish Empire's Aztec, Incan, and Mayan Conquests |url= |location= |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=127-128 |isbn=978-1598847772}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Sports== 
 {{Main|Mesoamerican ball game}} 
 
 The most popular Aztec [[sport]] was [[Tlachtili]]. They played this game using [[rubber]] balls and vertical hoops on opposite walls in the middle of the court. The game's goal was to shoot the ball into the hoop using their [[knee]]s. The first team to score won the game. < ref name= " mb1 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22765562|title=The Mesoamerican ballgame|last1=Vernon L. Scarborough|last2=David R.

 ==End of the Aztec Empire==

 Between [[1519]] and [[1521]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]], [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Alliance|allied]] with [[Tlaxcala]] and other [[enemies]] of the Aztecs.  The conquistadors defeated the Aztecs, took their empire, and made it into a Spanish [[colony]]. Some Aztecs did not want to fight against the soldiers of Cortés, because they thought they were gods. < ref > Lockhart, James;  &  Schwartz, Stuart (1983).
