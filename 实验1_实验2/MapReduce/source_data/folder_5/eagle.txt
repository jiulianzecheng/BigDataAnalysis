 '''Eagle''' is a general term for many large [[bird of prey|birds of prey]]. Over 60 species have been described, and they live in many parts of the world. Most species of eagle are found in [[Eurasia]] and in [[Africa]]. < ref > del Hoyo J; Elliot A.  &  Sargatal J. (editors). 1994.

 Eagles are not a natural [[monophyletic]] group. The name describes a bird of prey big enough to hunt larger vertebrates. Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight. Eagles are generally put in the family [[Accipitridae]]. They belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. 
 
 The largest eagle that has ever lived is [[Haast's eagle]]. It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its [[ecosystem]]. Though it is now [[extinct]], it lived in [[New Zealand]]. Before man got there, it preyed on [[moa]]s. 
 
 Eagles are carnivores. This means that they eat meat from other animals. Eagles are [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], and so are [[vulture]]s, [[falcon]]s and [[owl]]s. Eagles use their strong [[talons]] to catch and grab their food, and they use their sharp beaks to help them tear into the meat of their prey.
