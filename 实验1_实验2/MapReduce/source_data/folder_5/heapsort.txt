'''Heap sort''' or '''heapsort''' is a [[sorting algorithm]]. It was presented in 1964, and helped make a [[data structure]] known as [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] popular. Heapsort divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It then takes the largest element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the sorted region. The unsorted region is kept as a heap, which allows finding the largest element quickly. Heapsort is not [[stable sorting algorithm|stable]]. It has a worst-case [[Big O notation|complexity]] of O(n*log(n)).
