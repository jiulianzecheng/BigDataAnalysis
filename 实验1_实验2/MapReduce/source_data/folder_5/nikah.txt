 [[Islamic Law|Islamic law]] has the concept of [[marriage]] called '''Nikah''' (نكاح).  Normal marriages do not end, unless they are [[Divorce|divorced]]. In addition, there is a marriage for a given time, called '''Nikah Mut'a'''. [[Sunni Islam]] does not recognize Nikah Mut'a; they say it is a legitimisation of [[prostitution]]. Despite this, some Sunni schools of law have developed similar concepts.  
 
 In Nikah, both [[husband]] and [[wife]] are asked three times for consent to intercourse with witnesses so later on no one can claim [[rape]].
