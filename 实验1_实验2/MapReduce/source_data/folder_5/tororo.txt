 '''Tororo''' ({{lang-ja|とろろ}}) is a sticky food made from grating a [[yam]]. Tororo is mixed with other food that typically includes [[dashi]], [[wasabi]], and [[green onions]], and the amount of these ingredients can be adjusted to suit one's taste. In Japan, tororo is eaten as a side dish, or added to noodles ([[udon]] or [[soba]]). Tororo has a lot of vitamin B1, vitamin C, calcium, potassium, and other vitamins and minerals.
