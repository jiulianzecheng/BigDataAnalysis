It may include the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner. Diplomacy often involves [[country|countries]] making an agreement with each other, such as a [[treaty]]. Diplomacy is the talk between the representatives of [[state]]s, such as their [[heads of state]]. Sometimes, these talks are about [[trade]] or [[business]], and sometimes they are about [[war]] and [[peace]]. Diplomacy happens a lot when two or more countries fight. 
 
 Diplomats are people that are sent from their home [[country]], to meet with and talk to diplomats and leaders of foreign countries. An important type of diplomat is called an [[ambassador]]. An ambassador lives in a foreign country and works in an [[embassy]] to be available for meetings with the government of that country.
