 '''''Elasmotherium''''' is an [[extinct]] giant [[rhinoceros]]. 
 
 It lived from 2.6 million years ago (mya) to about 50,000 years ago. Fossils have been found in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. < ref > {{Cite book | editor-first=V.V. | editor-last=Titov | editor2-first=A.S. | editor2-last=Tesakov | title=Quaternary stratigraphy and paleontology of the Southern Russia: connections between Europe, Africa and Asia: Abstracts of the International INQUA-SEQS Conference (Rostov-on-Don, June 21–26, 2010) | year=2010 | location=Rostov-on-Don | publisher=Russian Academy of Science | first1=Piruza | last1=Tleuberdina | first2=Gulzhan | last2=Nazymbetova | contribution=Distribution of Elasmotherium in Kazakhstan | pages=171–173 | url=http://seqs2010-rostov.narod.ru/absractsrostov.pdf | access-date=2013-06-08 | archive-date=2010-09-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928234643/http://seqs2010-rostov.narod.ru/absractsrostov.pdf | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This giant lived and grazed on the [[Eurasian]] [[steppe]]s ([[grassland]]s). 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Elasmotherium'' was a heavily-built quadruped that walked on four [[hoof]]ed legs.  Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were adapted for [[gallop]]ing, giving it a horse-like gait. 
 
 It probably had a large horn on its forehead, but fossils of the horn have not been found. The teeth were tall-crowned and were covered with cement and wrinkled enamel. Its mouth at the front was a beak; there are no teeth in front of the [[molar]]s. 
 
 ===Morphology=== 
 The specimens of ''E. sibiricum'' are up to {{convert|4.5|m|abbr=on}} in body length with shoulder heights over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. ''E. caucasicum'' was at least {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} in body length with an estimated mass of {{convert|3.6|-|4.5|t|ST|0}}. This is based on isolated molars which are larger than those of the Siberian species. < ref name=Zhegallo20-21 > Zhegallo V. ''et al'' 2005.

 Both species were among the largest in the family Rhinocerotidae, comparable in size to the [[woolly mammoth]] and larger than the [[woolly rhinoceros]]. < ref > {{cite journal | first1=Esperanza | last1=Cerdeño | first2=Manuel | last2=Nieto | title=Changes in Western European Rhinocerotidae related to climatic variations | journal=Palaeo | issue=114 | year=1995 | page=328 | url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/ref_files/1291418848.pdf }} < /ref > < ref > Cerdeño, Esperenza 1998.
