 '''Construction''' is the process of erection or assembly of any [[building]] or [[infrastructure]] on a site. In general, there are three types of construction:[[Image:Prefabricated house construction.gif|thumb|220px|Construction of a pre-fabricated [[house]].]]

 Building construction is the process of adding structure to [[real property]]. Industrial construction, though a relatively small part of the entire construction industry, is a very important component. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first buildings were huts and [[shelter]]s, constructed by hand or with simple tools. As [[cities]] grew during the [[Bronze Age]], a class of professional craftsmen appeared. Occasionally, [[slaves]] were used for construction work. In the [[Middle Ages]], these were organized into guilds. In the 19th century, steam-powered [[machinery]] appeared, and later [[diesel]]- and [[electric]] powered [[vehicle]]s such as [[Crane (machine)|cranes]], excavators and bulldozers. 
 
 Modern construction is consistently made of materials such as [[glass]], [[steel]], [[concrete]] and bricks. So it is easy to build simple forms like simple cubic forms. The new style of [[architecture]] is based on the economic basic principle: 
 * Social economics: The need to build houses results in having  too many houses to build and to create fewer special houses. Decorations and ornaments were not important. 
 * Constructive economics: The reduction of needing points and areas allows new possibilities. That results in more free forms with the same work. 
 * Stylistic economics: The houses represent universality and objectivity and they are a product of [[art]].
