 With the [[Industrial Revolution]], companies started to produce more goods that they would be able to sell. [[Overproduction]] occurs when there is more [[supply]] of a good than there is [[demand]] for it. Manufacturers use concepts such a  [[planned obsolescence]] and [[advertising]] to manipulate [[consumer spending]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Czarnecka|first1=Barbara|last2=Schivinski|first2=Bruno|date=17 June 2019|title=Do Consumers Acculturated to Global Consumer Culture Buy More Impulsively?

 In 1899, [[Thorstein Veblen]] published  a book on consumerism, called ''The Theory of the Leisure Class''. In the book, Veblen looked at the widespread values and economic institutions which started with the widespread  " leisure time "  in the beginning of the 20th century. He also introduces the concepts of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste. All are related to display of status, and not on how useful or functional something is. Today, these kinds of goods are known as [[Veblen good|Veblen goods]].  
 
 In economics, consumerism is used for economic policies that say that consumption is important. Consumers can [[Free choice|choose freely]] what products they buy. Manufacturers should focus on the goods people want (and buy). Society should be organized accordingly.  
 
 People who prefer a [[Simple living|simple life]] (sometimes called a slow life) and people who look at the effects of [[capitalism]] have criticized the concept of consumerism. Experts often say that there are physical limits to consumerism. An economy cannot grow without bounds; [[overconsumption]] is also a problem. Both have a direct impact on the environment, such as [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resources]], or the increase in [[waste]]. Larger effects include [[climate change]]. Some research that criticizes the concept, says that consumerism also has an effect on society as a whole: it makes class barriers stronger, and increases inequalities.
