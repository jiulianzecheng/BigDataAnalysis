 '''''Xiphactinus''''' (from [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] for  " [[sword]]-ray " ) was a large, 4.5 to 5 m (15 to 20 feet) long predatory bony fish that lived in the [[Western Interior Sea]], over what is now the middle of [[North America]], during the Late [[Cretaceous]]. Skeletal remains of ''Xiphactinus'' have come from [[Kansas]], [[Alabama]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the United States, as well as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]]. 
 == Description == 
 Above all else, ''Xiphactinus'' was a great swimmer, able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time. It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin. It was not however immune from attack. If injured, its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for [[shark]]s, [[Mosasaur|mosasaurs]], and other Xiphactinuses.
