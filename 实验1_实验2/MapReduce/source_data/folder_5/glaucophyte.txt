 The '''glaucophytes''' are a small group of [[freshwater]] microscopic [[algae]]. < ref name= " keeling " > {{cite journal | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

 The glaucophytes are of interest because they may be similar to the original algal type that led to green plants and red algae. < ref name= " keeling "  / > < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002621 | year = 2008 | author= Kim, Eunsoo  &  Graham, Linda E. | title = EEF2 analysis challenges the monophyly of Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e2621 | pmid = 18612431 | pmc = 2440802 | journal = PLOS ONE | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2621K | doi-access = free }} < /ref >  The relationships between these groups are not yet clear, < ref name= " palmer " > {{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1437 | title = The plant tree of life: an overview and some points of view | author = Palme J.D; Soltis D.E.  &  Chase M.W. | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1437–1445 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1437 | issue = 10 | pmid = 21652302 | access-date = 2014-07-03 | archive-date = 2010-10-09 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009220630/http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1437 | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  and the glaucophytes in particular need more study. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The [[chloroplast]]s of glaucophytes are known as 'cyanelles'. Unlike the chloroplasts in other organisms, they have a [[peptidoglycan]] layer, like [[bacteria]]l cell walls. This is thought to be a relic of the [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] origin of plastids from [[cyanobacteria]]. < ref name= " keeling "  / > 
 
 Glaucophytes have the photosynthetic pigment [[Chlorophyll|chlorophyll a]]. < ref name= " keeling "  / >  They harvest light with the same type of pigment molecules as do cyanobacteria and red algae. < ref name= " keeling "  / >  Green algae and land plants have lost that pigment, which is known as [[phycobiliprotein]]. < ref name=Skuja > Skuja A. 1948. Taxonomie des Phytoplanktons einiger Seen in Uppland, Schweden. ''Symbolae Botanicae Upsalienses'' '''9''' (3): 1-399. < /ref > 
 
 Glaucophyte [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[flagella]] (if present) are  similar to forms found in some green algae. < ref name=Skuja/ > 
 
 == Classification == 
 Only 13 species of glaucophytes are known, none of which is particularly common in nature. < ref name= " keeling "  / >  There are three [[genus|genera]]. 
 
 The glaucophytes were previously placed in the order [[Chlorococcales]]. < ref > [http://cfb.unh.edu/phycokey/Choices/Glaucophyceae/GLAUCOCYSTIS/Glaucocystis_key.html Glaucocystis] < /ref >
