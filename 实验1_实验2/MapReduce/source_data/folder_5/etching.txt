 '''Etching''' is done by drawing lines through a protective coating on a [[copper]] or [[zinc]] plate. The plate is then placed into acid. The acid cuts into the unprotected parts of the surface to create a design in the metal. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etching |title=Etching  & #124; Definition of etching by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |access-date=2015-08-11}} < /ref > 
 
 The printing is done by rolling an [[ink]] pad across the surface. The ink sinks into the [[intaglio]] (cut) surface, and rolls off the [[wax]]ed surface off the plate. The metal plate is then pressed onto paper. < ref name=met > {{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/etch/hd_etch.htm |title=The Printed Image in the West: Etching |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=1 August 2016}} < /ref >
