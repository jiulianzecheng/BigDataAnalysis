'''Regulation''' is the management of [[complex systems]]. It is based on a set of rules and trends. In [[systems theory]], these types of rules exist in many parts of [[biology]] and [[society]], but the term has slightly different meanings. For example: 
 * in biology, [[gene regulation]] and [[metabolic regulation]] allow living organisms to [[adapt]] to their environment and keep [[homeostasis]]; 
 * in [[government]], typically regulation means [[delegated legislation]] which is created by an expert < ref > Levi-Faur, David, Regulation and Regulatory Governance, Jerusalem Papers in Regulation and Governance, No.1, 2010 < /ref > 
 * in business,  [[industry self-regulation]] happens through [[self-regulatory organization]]s and [[trade association]]s which allow industries to set and enforce rules with less government involvement; and, 
 * in psychology, [[self-regulation theory]] is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals. 
 
 The opposite of regulation is [[deregulation]].
