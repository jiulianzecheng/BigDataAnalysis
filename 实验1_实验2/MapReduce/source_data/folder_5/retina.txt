 The '''retina''' is the thin neural tissue that contains light sensitive neurons called photoreceptors (rods and cones) that interact with secondary and tertiary neurons inside the [[eye]]ball in humans and in many animals. Its  role is to [[Image sensor|sense the light]] which gets into the eye and send information about it to the [[brain]]. 
 
 Most information about light images that leaves the retina travels through the [[optic nerve]], and is used by the brain to create visual sensations.  Information about light which travels through the ''retino-hypothamalic tract'' is for adjusting [[circadian rhythm]]s to the 24-hour [[day]].  
 
 The center of the human retina, called the ''fovea centralis'', or just ''fovea'', has the most [cone cells] for sensing bright colors and fine detail of a viewed object. Even though the fovea takes up only 1.5 square millimeters, it plays the most important role in [[vision]].  It is only around 1% of the human retina, but the fovea sends about as much information to the [[visual cortex]] as the rest of the retina combined.
