 '''Magnox''' is a type of [[nuclear reactor]] designed to run on natural [[uranium]]. It uses  [[graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] and [[carbon dioxide]] gas as a [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]] coolant. The name '''Magnox''' comes from the [[magnesium]]-[[aluminium]] [[alloy]] used to clad the fuel rods inside the reactor. The Magnox was designed for producing both [[electric power]] and [[plutonium]]-239 for use in [[nuclear weapon]]s.
