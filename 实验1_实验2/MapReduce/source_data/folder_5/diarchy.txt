 '''Diarchy''' (or '''dyarchy''') is a form of government where two people are usually the [[head of state|heads of state]]. The word comes from the Greek ''δι-''  " two elements "  and ''ἀρχή'',  " rule "  (from ἄρχω; -αρχία is a derived suffix). The term '''duumvirate''' is a [[hyponym]] (from Latin duumvirātus,  " male diarchy " ) but some people use it erroneously for [[woman|women]].  
 
 Historical examples Diarchies are [[Sparta]], [[Roman Republic|The Roman Republic]] and at one point [[India]]
