 The '''Zaniskari''' is a small [[Horse|mountain horse]] or [[pony]] from [[Ladakh]], named after the [[Zanskar Range|Zanskar region]] in [[Kargil district|Kargil]]. It shares characteristics with Tibetan breeds from neighboring [[Tibet]] and [[Baltistan]]. The Zaniskari is of medium size and often has a grey coat. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2018-06-01|title=INDIAN HORSE SOCIETY OF INDIA|url=http://www.horseindian.com/Zanskari.htm|access-date=2023-11-27|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2018-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180601000940/http://www.horseindian.com/Zanskari.htm|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  The breed is [[Endangered species|endangered]], with only a few hundred remaining. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2017-08-05|title=National Research Centre on Equines|url=http://nrce.nic.in/breeds.php|access-date=2023-11-27|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2017-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805003553/http://nrce.nic.in/breeds.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 This horse is well adapted to serve as a pack animal in the challenging conditions of its native region, situated between 3000 and 5000 meters above [[sea level]], where temperatures can drop to −40 & nbsp;°C. It is strong, sure-footed, and has good stamina. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=A.K.|last2=Tandon|first2=S.N.|last3=Pal|first3=Y.|last4=Bhardwaj|first4=A.|last5=Chauhan|first5=M.|date=June 2012|title=Phenotypic characterization of Indian equine breeds: a comparative study|url=http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S2078633612000094|journal=Animal Genetic Resources/Ressources génétiques animales/Recursos genéticos animales|language=en|volume=50|pages=49–58|doi=10.1017/S2078633612000094|issn=2078-6336}} < /ref > 
 
 == Population == 
 In 1977, there were about 15,000–20,000 Zaniskari horses. At that time, they were considered not at risk. However, due to [[Breeding|cross-breeding]] with other [[horse]]s, only a few hundred pure-bred Zaniskari horses are left today, mostly in the valleys of [[Ladakh]], including the [[Zanskar Gorge]]. To protect and preserve the breed, the Animal Husbandry Department of Jammu and Kashmir runs a farm in Padum, [[Zanskar]]. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture|date=2007|isbn=978-92-5-105762-9|editor-last=FAO|location=Rome}} < /ref > 
 
 The population has decreased because of machines and more roads in their native area. Despite this, as of 2006, there were no significant signs of genetic issues. In 2013, there were around 9,700 Zaniskari horses, but by 2022, their conservation status was marked as  " [[Endangered species|at risk/critical maintained]], "  with a reported population of 346 animals. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://dadis-breed-datasheet-ext-ws.firebaseapp.com/?country=IND & specie=Horse & breed=Zaniskari%20Pony & lang=en|access-date=2023-11-27|website=dadis-breed-datasheet-ext-ws.firebaseapp.com}} < /ref >
