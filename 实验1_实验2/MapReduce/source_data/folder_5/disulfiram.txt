'''Disulfiram''' is a [[medication]] used to treat [[chronic]] [[alcoholism]].  It is sold under the brand names '''Antabuse''' and '''Antabus'''. < ref name=label > {{cite web |url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=12850de3-c97c-42c1-b8d3-55dc6fd05750 |title=Drug Label Information: Antabuse – Disulfiram Tablet |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=April 18, 2012 |website=DailyMed |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine, [[National Institutes of Health]] |access-date=February 25, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 Disulfiram works by making people feel very sick if they [[alcoholic drink|drink alcohol]].  It is not a [[wikt:cure|cure]] for alcoholism.  Usually, alcoholics who take disulfiram also need to get [[psychotherapy|counseling]] and support. 
 
 ==Effects== 
 When a person gets [[treatment]] for alcoholism, disulfiram may be part of their treatment plan.  However, the person has to go through [[alcohol withdrawal]] first.  It is not safe to take disulfiram if a person has had any alcohol in the past 12 hours. < ref name=label/ > 
 
 When a person takes disulfiram, they get very sick if they drink any alcohol.  They will start feeling sick 5 to 30 minutes after they drink. < !-- < ref name=ch/ > -- >   Usually, the more a person drank, the sicker they will feel. < !-- < ref name=ch/ > -- >   Their [[symptom]]s may include: < ref name=ch > {{cite book |author=Strain, Eric C.; Gordon, Adam J.; Johnson, Bankole A. | display-authors = etal |title=Incorporating Alcohol Pharmacotherapies Into Medical Practice |chapter=Disulfiram |publisher=United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |date=2009 }} < /ref >

 ==Problems== 
 
 ===Cravings=== 
 One of the symptoms of alcoholism is wanting alcohol very, very badly.  This is called [[craving]].  An alcoholic feels like they need alcohol to live. < ref name=icd > {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/ICD10ClinicalDiagnosis.pdf?ua=1 |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=World Health Organization Programmes: Management of Substance Abuse |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |access-date=February 21, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 One problem with disulfiram is that it does not stop alcohol cravings.  If an alcoholic takes disulfiram, they will keep craving alcohol, but will get very sick if they do drink.  Many alcoholics solve this problem by just not taking disulfiram.  One year-long study done in 1986 found that disulfiram did not seem to work.  However, the researchers found that only 20% of the alcoholics actually took their disulfiram.  The other 80% stopped taking disulfiram so they could drink alcohol without getting sick. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03380110055026 |title=Disulfiram Treatment of Alcoholism: A Veterans Administration Cooperative Study |author=Fuller RK; Branchey L | display-authors = etal |date=1986 |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=256 |issue=11 |pages=1449–55 |pmid=3528541}} < /ref >

 However, later studies found that when disulfiram is [[wikt:supervise|supervised]] - when someone watches an alcoholic take their disulfiram - the medication works. < ref name=relapse > {{cite journal |author=Brewer C; Meyers RJ | display-authors = etal|date= 2000 |title=Does Disulfiram Help to Prevent Relapse in Alcohol Abuse? |journal=CNS Drugs |publisher=Springer International Publishing |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=329–341 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200014050-00001| s2cid = 45557811}} < /ref >   Alcoholics getting supervised disulfiram drink less, go longer periods of time without drinking, and participate more in other treatments than alcoholics getting un-supervised disulfiram. < ref name=relapse/ >   Family members, friends, [[clinic]]s, or [[court]]s can make sure that alcoholics take their disulfiram. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Meyers RJ; Villanueva M | display-authors = etal |date=2005 |title=The Community Reinforcement Approach: History and New Directions |journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=247–260 |doi=10.1891/jcop.2005.19.3.247 | s2cid = 219201248 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Martin B; Clapp L | display-authors = etal|date= 2003 |title=Compliance to Supervised Disulfiram Therapy: A Comparison of Voluntary and Court-Ordered Patients |journal=The American Journal on Addictions |publisher=American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=137–143 |doi=10.1111/j.1521-0391.2003.tb00611.x | pmid = 12746088}} < /ref > 
 
 Disulfiram [[wikt:tablet|tablets]] can also be placed under the skin by a [[surgeon]].  These tablets release disulfiram continuously for up to 12 weeks. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Sezgin B; Sibar S | display-authors = etal|date= 2014 |title=Disulfiram Implantation for the Treatment of Alcoholism: Clinical Experiences from the Plastic Surgeon's Point of View |journal=Archives of Plastic Surgery |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=571–575 |doi=10.5999/aps.2014.41.5.571 | pmid = 25276651| pmc = 4179363}} < /ref >   This makes it impossible for an alcoholic to decide not to take their disulfiram so they can drink. 
 
 Also, a [[medical doctor|doctor]] can [[prescription|prescribe]] a newer drug, like [[naltrexone]], along with disulfiram.  Naltrexone does block alcohol cravings.  The two drugs can work together to make it easier for the alcoholic not to drink. 
 
 ===Not a cure=== 
 The [[United States]] [[National Institutes of Health]] says: 
 < blockquote > ''Disulfiram is not a cure for alcoholism. When [disulfiram is] used alone, without proper [[motivation]] and supportive therapy, it is unlikely that it will have any [real] effect on the drinking pattern of the chronic alcoholic.'' < ref name=label/ > < /blockquote > 
 
 Just taking disulfiram is usually not enough to keep an alcoholic from drinking.  Disulfiram works best when an alcoholic also: < ref name=label/ > < ref name=relapse/ > < ref name=tx > {{Cite report |author=Raistrick, Duncan; Heather, Nick; Godfrey, Christine |title=Review of the Effectiveness of Treatment for Alcohol Problems |url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/nta_review_of_the_effectiveness_of_treatment_for_alcohol_problems_fullreport_2006_alcohol2.pdf |publisher=National Health System of the United Kingdom |access-date=February 21, 2016 |archive-date=December 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203115017/http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/nta_review_of_the_effectiveness_of_treatment_for_alcohol_problems_fullreport_2006_alcohol2.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;130–144 < /sup >
