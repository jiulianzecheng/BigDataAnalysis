However, 28.6% was much higher than other people thought, such as [[The New York Times]] and [[The Economist]]. 
 
 FiveThirtyEight has also analyzed at the [[calibration]] of their forecasts. If a forecast with good calibration says that many things each have a 40% chance of happening, then about 40% will. Their forecasts are fairly accurate. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Wezerek|first=Jay Boice, Gus|date=2019-04-04|title=How Good Are FiveThirtyEight Forecasts?|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/|access-date=2020-09-16|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en}} < /ref >
