 The '''acorn''' is the [[fruit]] of the [[oak]] tree. < ref > (genera ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' and ''[[Cyclobalanopsis]]'', in the family [[Fagaceae]]) < /ref >  It is a [[Nut (fruit)|nut]], and has a single [[seed]] (rarely two seeds), enclosed in a tough, [[leather]]y shell. Acorns vary from 1 – 6 & nbsp;cm long and 0.8 – 4 & nbsp;cm broad. Acorns take between about 6 or 24 months (depending on the [[species]]) to mature. 
 
 Acorns are one of the most important wildlife foods in areas where oaks grow. < ref > Janzen, Daniel H. 1971 Seed predation by animals. In  Richard F. Johnson, Peter W. Frank and Charles Michner (eds) ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics''. < /ref >  Creatures that make acorns an important part of their diet include [[bird]]s, such as [[jay]]s, [[pigeon]]s, some [[duck]]s and several species of [[woodpecker]]s. Small [[mammal]]s that feed on acorns include [[mouse|mice]], [[squirrel]]s and several other [[rodent]]s. Such large mammals as [[pig]]s, [[bear]]s, and [[deer]] also eat large amounts of acorns: they may constitute up to 25% of the diet of deer in the autumn. < ref > Brown, Leland R. 1979. Insects feeding on California oak trees. In Timothy Plum and Norman Pillsbury (eds) ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Multiple-use management of California's hardwood resources'',  Gen. Tech. Rep. PSW-44, USDA, Forest Service, Pac. S.W. Forest and Range Experiment Station, [[Berkeley, California]], pp. & nbsp;184–194. < /ref >  In some of the large oak forests in southwest [[Europe]], traditionally called  " dehesas " , pigs are still turned loose in [[oak grove]]s in the autumn, to fill and fatten themselves on acorns.  
 
 Acorns contain [[tannin]]s, which are toxic to some animals such as [[horse]]s. The tannins can be soaked out, using water.
