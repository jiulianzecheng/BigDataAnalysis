 '''Dysthymia''' (also called '''dysthymic disorder''' or '''neurotic depression''') is a type of [[mental illness]] called a [[mood disorder]].  People with dysthymia have [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]] that is mild to moderate and lasts for a long time, sometimes years. A person must have symptoms for at least two years to qualify for a [[diagnosis]] of dysthymia. 
 
 The [[symptom]]s of dysthymia and [[major depressive disorder]] are similar. Both disorders can have serious effects on the body, mind, and [[emotion]]s.  Physical symptoms can include changes in appetite, low energy, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping. Mental symptoms include difficulty making decisions or [[Concentration|concentrating]]. Emotionally, people with either disorder often feel hopeless and have low [[self-esteem]].  These symptoms are usually less severe with dysthymia. 
 
 In comparison to people with major depressive disorder, people with dysthymia may think about [[suicide]] and try to kill themselves. Dysthymia does not involve [[mania]], hypomania (mild forms of mania), or mixed episodes (where a person has symptoms of both depression and mania). 
 
 Sometimes, people with dysthymia have  " double depression. "   This happens when a person with dysthymia has episodes of major depression (where their depression gets much worse) on top of their existing dysthymia. 
 
 Dysthymia usually affects adults, though it can affect [[teenager]]s. People who are diagnosed early (before age 22) usually have more severe relapses (where they return to being dysthymic after having been healthy), and are more likely to have other mental illnesses along with their dysthymia.
