 '''Milk''' is a [[white]] [[liquid]] made by [[mammal]]s, like [[cow]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[human]]s. It is made in the [[mammary gland]]s (breasts, udders, or teats) of [[female]] [[mammal]]s. Newborn babies must be given milk before they can eat solid [[food]]. Milk has many [[nutrient]]s to help babies grow and be healthy. It is also a rich source of calcium which is good for their bones and teeth. 
 
 == Storing milk == 
 [[File:AL QASUS VENDOR IN DAR.jpg|thumb|Milk vendor in [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]).]] 
 If milk is not kept cold in a [[refrigerator]], it will become [[wikt:sour|sour]] after some time. When milk is warmed, it turns sour. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://imqh.com/sour-milk-recipes/ |title=Sour Milk Recipes |work=imqh.com |accessdate=29 April 2010 |archive-date=27 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327193207/http://imqh.com/sour-milk-recipes/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Fermentation]] makes this happen. [[Pediococcus|Lactic acid bacteria]] change the milk [[sugar]] into [[lactic acid]]. Fermentation is used when making [[dairy product]]s.  
 
 Milk is often [[pasteurisation|pasteurised]] before humans drink it. It is made into dairy products like [[cream]], [[butter]], [[yogurt]], [[ice cream]], or [[cheese]]. Pasteurised cows' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a [[refrigerator]]. Milk should be stored between 1° and 4° [[Celsius]]. If milk is treated with very high temperatures, it will last longer before spoiling. This means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened. 
 
 == Goat milk == 
 Goat's milk is the milk from a [[Domestic goat|goat]]. It can be drunk, both by humans or baby goats, or cheese can be made from it. This cheese is called [[goat's milk cheese]]. < ref > {{Cite web

 == Coconut milk == 
 [[Coconut milk]] is not real milk because it comes from a plant instead of an animal. However, it looks similar to real milk because it is white. It also does not have as many nutrients as real milk. It is made by removing the white  " [[meat]] "  from a [[coconut]], pressing or squeezing the  " meat " , then adding water. It is sometimes used in [[cooking]], for example, in [[Thai food|Thai]] [[curry]]. 
 Coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar. 
 
 == Almond milk ==

 [[Almond milk]] is produced by grinding almonds and processing that liquid for drinking. 
 
 ==Cow milk== 
 Cow milk is the milk from a cow. Whole cow’s milk contains about 87% water. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cow milk colostrum: Ingredients and nutrition facts|url=https://thanhhuongshop.com/sua-non-alpha-lipid-lifeline.html}} < /ref >  The remaining 13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.  
 
 == Nutrients == 
 Milk forms an important part of a person's daily balanced diet. It contains a lot of [[calcium]] that helps bones and teeth to grow stronger. Also, milk provides the body with high quality [[protein]]s, and helps in meeting the body's requirement for vitamins. One glass of milk gives about 44% to the recommended daily vitamins intake. Some kind of milks, though, do not have good calcium. These kind of milk products include [[cream]], [[cottage]] [[cheese]], ricotta cheese, and [[cream cheese]]. < ref > {{Cite web

 == Lactose == 
 Milk contains a chemical called [[lactose]]. Babies make an [[enzyme]] called [[lactase]] inside their bodies. Adults make less lactase. If they do not have enough, they may not be able to digest lactose anymore. This problem is called [[lactose intolerance]] and it affects many adults. There are many medicines that help adults digest lactose. Many lactose-intolerant people drink [[soy milk]] instead of animal milk, because it does not contain lactose. Soy milk tastes similar to animal milk, but it is chemically very different and is made from [[soy bean|soybeans]]. 
 
 == Ability to drink milk == 
 Most mammals shut off the ability to digest milk early in life. Then they turn to a diet without milk. Humans were like that originally. We don't know all the details, but it seems what happened was this. They learnt that at least some milk from cattle was good for humans. They bred the cattle until the cattle produced milk regularly, not just for their young.  
 
 The few people who could digest milk gradually increased in number. They had the advantage of a ready supply of food (milk). 
 
 At that point, it was an advantage for humans to have a regular supply of milk, which they could now digest. So began a process which eventually swept up all humans except a very few. We now think it is natural to drink milk throughout life ( " lactose tolerance " ), but we are one of the few species which does so. < ref name= " Swallow 2003 " > {{cite journal |last1=Swallow |first1=Dallas M. |title=Genetics of Lactase Persistence and Lactose Intolerance |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |date=December 2003 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=197–219 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.143820 |pmid=14616060 }} < /ref >  In some human populations, though, lactase persistence has quite recently [[Evolution|evolved]]. < ref name= " Bersaglieri et al. 2004 " > {{cite journal |last1=Bersaglieri |first1=Todd |last2=Sabeti |first2=Pardis C.  |last3=Patterson |first3=Nick |last4=Vanderploeg |first4=Trisha |last5=Schaffner |first5=Steve F. |last6=Drake |first6=Jared A. |last7=Rhodes |first7=Matthew |last8=Reich |first8=David E. |last9=Hirschhorn |first9=Joel N. |title=Genetic signatures of strong recent positive selection at the lactase gene |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |date=June 2004 |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1111–1120 |doi=10.1086/421051 |pmid=15114531 |pmc=1182075 }} < /ref >
