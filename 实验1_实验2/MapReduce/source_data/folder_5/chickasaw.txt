 The '''Chickasaw''' are a [[Native Americans|Native American]] people. They are from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]] of [[North America]]. Before Europeans came to America, they lived in the area of [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. They speak the [[Chickasaw language]]. This language is in the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]] [[language family]]. The Chickasaw are [[Federally recognized tribe|federally recognized]] as the [[Chickasaw Nation]]. 
 
 The Chickasaw first lived in western North America. Before the first [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]], they moved to east of the [[Mississippi River]]. They settled mostly in what is now northeast Mississippi. They were living here when European explorers and traders came. They had relationships with the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[British Empire|English]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] during the colonial years. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. The tribe had advanced social structures and did many things that European Americans did. The US forced them to sell their land in 1832. They also forced them to move to the [[Indian Territory]] ([[Oklahoma]]) during the 1830s. 
 
 Most Chickasaw now live in Oklahoma. The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Its members are related to the [[Choctaw]] and share a common history with them. The Chickasaw are divided into two groups: the ''Impsaktea'' and the ''Intcutwalipa''. They traditionally followed a system of [[matrilineality|matrilineal descent]]. Some property was controlled by women. Leadership in the tribe passed from a mother to her children.

 ==History== 
 
 The origin of the Chickasaw is not known for certain. Twentieth-century scholars, such as the [[archeologist]] Patricia Galloway, think that the Chickasaw and Choctaw came from the [[Plaquemine culture]] and other groups whose ancestors had lived in the Lower Mississippi Valley for thousands of years. The Chickasaw and Choctaw then became distinct peoples in the 17th century. < ref name=GALLOWAY > {{Cite book|last=Galloway|first=Patricia |title=Choctaw Genesis, 1500–1700|series=Indians of the Southeast|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln, NE|page=49–54|isbn=9780803270701|oclc=32012964|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HVOImebydMC & dq=Plaquemine & pg=PA49|access-date=August 31, 2013}} < /ref >  When Europeans first encountered them, the Chickasaw were living in villages in present-day [[South Carolina]] and northeastern [[Mississippi]].

 Another version of the Chickasaw creation story is that they came out of the ground at ''[[Nanih Waiya]],'' a great [[mound]] [[Mound builders|built]] about 300 CE by [[Woodland]] peoples. 
 [[File:DeSoto Map Leg 2 HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The second leg of the de Soto Expedition, from [[Apalachee]] to the Chicaza]] 
 In 1540 the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[explorer]] [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando De Soto]] encountered the ancestors of the Chickasaw and stayed in one of their towns. After various disagreements, the American Indians attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying it. The Spanish moved on quickly. < ref > {{cite book|author=Hudson, Charles M.|title=Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun|url=https://archive.org/details/knightsofspainwa0000huds|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820318882|author-link=Charles M.

 The Chickasaw began to buy guns from the [[United Kingdom|British]] after the [[Province of Carolina|colony of Carolina]] was founded in 1670. They used these weapons to raid the Choctaw. They captured some members and sold them into [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian slavery]] to the British. When the Choctaw started buying guns from the French, the slave raids stopped. 
 
 Allied with the British, the Chickasaw had battles with the [[France|French]] and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the [[Battle of Ackia]] on May 26, 1736. They continued until France was defeated by the British in the [[Seven Years' War]] (called the [[French and Indian War]] in North America). 
 
 After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Chickasaw were allies of the new United States and fought against the Indians of the old [[Northwest Territory]]. The [[Shawnee]] and other Northwest Indians were defeated in the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] on August 20, 1794.
