 '''INDO''' stands for '''Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap'''. It is a [[semi-empirical quantum chemistry method]] that is a development of the [[CNDO/2|complete neglect of differential overlap]] (CNDO/2) method  developed by [[John Pople]]. Like CNDO/2 it uses [[zero-differential overlap]] for the two-[[electron]] [[integral]]s. Integrals for over orbitals centered on the same [[atom]] are included in the INDO method. < ref > J.

 The method is now rarely used in its original form. But it is the basis for several other methods, such as [[MINDO]], [[ZINDO]] and [[SINDO]].
