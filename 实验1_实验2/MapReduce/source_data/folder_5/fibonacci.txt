 == Fibonacci number sequence == 
 
 Fibonacci is best known for the list of numbers called the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci Sequence]]. The list never stops, but it starts this way: 
  1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8,  13,  21,  34,  55,  89, 144,  233,   
  377,  610,  987,  1597,  2584... 
 
 In this list, a person can find the next number by adding the last two numbers together. 
  1 + 1 = 2 
      1 + 2 = 3 
          2 + 3 = 5 
              3 + 5 = 8 
                  5 + 8 = 13 
                      8 + 13 = 21 
                          13 + 21 = 34 
                               21 + 34 = 55 
                                    34 + 55 = 89 
                                         55 + 89 = 144 
                                              89 + 144 = 233 
                                                   144 + 233 = 377 
                                                         233 + 377 = 610 
                                                               377 + 610 = 987 
                                                                     610 + 987 = 1597 
                                                                           987 + 1597 = 2584 
                                                                           etc... 
 
 This series is also interesting because the ratio of two adjacent numbers in the series approaches the [[golden ratio]]. < ref > Livio, Mario. (2003).
