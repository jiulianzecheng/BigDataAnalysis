 '''Stonehenge''' is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[World Heritage Site]] of [[megalith]]s. It is eight miles (13 kilometers) north of [[Salisbury]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. < ref > UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373  " Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites " ]; retrieved 2012-4-19. < /ref >  the site was built between 3100 BC and 1550 BC. It was used until the [[Bronze Age]]. The monument is made of a [[henge]], < ref > Remains of a former ring bank and ditch < /ref >  with [[standing stone]]s in [[circle]]s. It is likely the most important prehistoric [[monument]] in Britain. The site has attracted visitors from very early times.   
 
 == Building Stonehenge == 
 Stonehenge was built in three stages. Most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 BC. < ref > {{cite news|author=Marc Kaufman|date=January 31, 2007|title=An ancient settlement is unearthed near Stonehenge|newspaper=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013000661.html|accessdate=2008-05-23}} < /ref >    
 
 The first stage started around 3100 BC.  During this stage, people dug a circular ditch and a ring of 56 pits, known as Aubrey Holes.  The second stage started around 2100 BC. During this stage, the Stonehenge builders brought huge [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/pillar pillars] of rocks from Southwestern [[Wales]] and erected them into [[concentric]] circles around the centre of the site. This double circle was never completed, and it was dismantled during the third period of construction. The final stage probably ended before 1500 BC.  During this period, the monument was remodeled. Its builders erected a circle of 30 upright stones, weighing up to 50 [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ton tons] each, capped by ring of stone [[mwod:lintel|lintels]]. These enclosed a [[horseshoe]]-shaped formation of five pairs of upright stones, each pair capped with a stone lintel. 
 
 Using [[Sequence analysis|DNA analysis]], scientists have discovered that the Stonehenge builders originally came from what is now [[Turkey]]. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Rincon|first=Paul|date=2019-04-16|title=DNA reveals origin of Stonehenge builders|language=en-GB|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47938188|accessdate=2019-04-20}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-04-16/stonehenge-builders-came-from-as-far-as-modern-day-turkey-dna-suggests/|title=Stonehenge builders came from as far as modern-day Turkey, DNA suggests|website=ITV News|date=16 April 2019|language=en|accessdate=2019-04-20}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 === Bluestones === 
 The first [[stone circle]] was a set of 'bluestones'. These stones are made of [[dolerite]], an [[igneous rock]].   
 
 The Stonehenge builders dug holes that held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan). Only 43 of these can be traced today.   
 
 There are several [[Theory|theories]] about how these bluestones arrived at Stonehenge. The ''long-distance human transport theory'' says the Stonehenge builders brought the bluestones from the [[Preseli Hills]] in modern-day [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]] - 160 miles (260 km) away from Stonehenge. < ref name= " Antiquity " > {{cite journal |last1=Parker Pearson |first1=Michael |display-authors=etal |date=December 2015 |title=Craig Rhos-y-felin: a Welsh bluestone megalith quarry for Stonehenge |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6 & fid=10057092 & jid=AQY & volumeId=89 & issueId=348 & aid=10057091 & bodyId= & membershipNumber= & societyETOCSession= & fulltextType=RA & fileId=S0003598X15001775 |journal=Antiquity |publisher= Antiquity Publications Ltd |volume=89 |issue=348 |pages=1331–1352 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.177 |s2cid=162776591 |accessdate=15 December 2015}} < /ref >  In 2011, a megalithic bluestone [[quarry]] was discovered at [[Craig Rhos-y-felin]], near [[Crymych]] in Pembrokeshire. This supported the long-distance human transport theory. < ref name= " Antiquity "  / >   
 
 Another theory is that the [[Irish Sea Glacier]] brought the stones close to Stonehenge. < ref > John, Brian 2007: ''[http://www.brianjohn.f2s.com/enigma1.html The Stonehenge Bluestones—glacial transport back in favour] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901221137/http://www.brianjohn.f2s.com/enigma1.html |date=2010-09-01 }}'' < /ref >  However, there is no evidence of glacial deposition within southern central England. For that reason, this theory has less support than the long-distance human transport theory. 
 
 === Sarsen stones === 
 Later, around 2400 BC, the Stonehenge builders brought thirty huge grey [[sarsen]] stones ([[sandstone]] blocks) to the site. They 'dressed' (worked on) the stones and gave them [[mortice and tenon]] joints. They erected these stones in a circle 33 metres (108 ft) in [[diameter]], with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top. They fitted the lintels together using another [[woodworking]] method: the [[tongue and groove joint]]. These stones serve as reminders of the lengths ancient civilizations went to, transporting them vast distances, in their quest to commune with the cosmos. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Nare|first=Alexa|title=Stonehenge Tours|url=https://www.visitstonehengelondon.com/|access-date=2023-09-21|website=|language=en}} < /ref >  They arranged the remaining bluestones in an inner circle. Each standing stone was about 4.1 metres (13 ft) high by 2.1 metres (6 ft 11 in) wide, and weighed about 25 tons.  
 
 The stones may have come from a quarry about 25 miles (40 km) north of Stonehenge on the [[Marlborough|Marlborough Downs]]. It is also possible that they were collected from a  " litter "  of sarsens on the [[chalk downs]], which are closer. The modern Stonehenge consists entirely of original stones (some of which have been replaced in upright position). 
 
 === Neighbouring sites === 
 There are also several [[passage tomb]]s and many [[Tumulus|tumuli]] nearby. 
 
 Stonehenge has a number of satellite structures which are part of the 'ritual landscape': 
 *[[Bluehenge]]/Bluestonehenge: a new discovery, one mile to the southeast. 
 *[[Durrington Walls]]: a [[Neolithic]] settlement two miles northeast of Stonehenge. 
 *[[Normanton Down Barrows]]: a Neolithic and Bronze Age [[barrow]] [[cemetery]]. 
 *[[Stonehenge Avenue]]: leads two miles from Stonehenge to [[Bluehenge]] on the River [[River Avon|Avon]]. 
 *[[Stonehenge Cursus]]: the largest monument in the area, not easily visible on the ground. 
 *[[Woodhenge]]: found in 1925 by an aerial survey. It had a henge and a wooden circle. 
 
 == Function == 
 No one knows who built Stonehenge or why they built it. During the [[summer|summer solstice]], the [[sunrise]] lines up with some of the stones in a particular way. This suggests that the arrangement of stones may work as a [[calendar]]. In [[Egypt]] and [[South America]], similar ancient [[building]]s can be found. They also show the time of the [[solstice]]. 
 
 Some scientists believe that early people were able to foretell [[Eclipse|eclipses]] of the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] based on their positions in relation to the stone monument. The site may have served as an [[observatory]] where early [[Ritual|rituals]] or [[Religion|religious]] [[Ceremony|ceremonies]] took place on specific days on the year.  
 
 Stonehenge itself is owned by the [[Monarchy|Crown]] and managed by [[English Heritage]]. The surrounding land is owned by the [[National Trust]]. < ref > {{cite web

 The World Heritage Site includes [[Avebury]] and Stonhenge together, though they are quite distinct.
