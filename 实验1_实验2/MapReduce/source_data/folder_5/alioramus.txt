 '''''Alioramus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurid]] dinosaur. It was about 20 feet long. It lived during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period in what is now [[Mongolia]]. 
 
 The [[type species]], ''A. remotus'', is known from a partial [[skull]] and three foot bones. They were got from [[Mongolia]]n [[sediments]] which were deposited in a [[humid]] [[floodplain]] about 70 & nbsp;million years ago. < ref > Kurzanov, Sergei M. A new carnosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Nogon-Tsav, Mongolia " . The Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition Transactions (in Russian) 3: 93–104. < /ref >   A second species, ''A. altai'', known from a much more complete skeleton, was named and described in 2009. < ref > Brusatte, Stephen L. ''et al'' 2009. A long-snouted, multihorned tyrannosaurid from the late Cretaceous of Mongolia. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America''. online preprint (41): 17261–6. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2765207/] < /ref >  Its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear. Some evidence suggests that ''Alioramus'' is closely related to the [[wikt:contemporary|contemporary]] species ''[[Tarbosaurus]] bataar''. 
 
 == Wetter climate == 
 The Maastrichtian stage in Mongolia had a wetter and more humid climate than the previous stages. Sediments show there were [[floodplain]]s, large [[river]] channels and soil deposits, with periodic [[drought]]s. < ref name=osmolska1997 > {{cite book |last=Osmólska |first=Halszka |year=1997 |chapter=Nemegt Formation |title=The Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075 |editor=Currie, Philip J. |editor2=Kevin Padian |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-226810-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediadino00curr_075/page/n501 471]–472}} < /ref > 
 
 This animal had many teeth, which were smaller than usual in the Tyrannosauridae, and a narrow, lower skull. It may have been a sub-adult (teenager), and must have eaten different prey than ''Tyrannosaurus''. Since the general area was a [[river delta|riverine delta]], the prey may have been fish.
