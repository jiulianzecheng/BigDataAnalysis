 '''Whitewash''', also called '''calcimine''', '''kalsomine''', '''calsomine''', or '''lime paint''', is a type of [[paint]].  
 
 Whitewash is made of slaked lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]) and [[chalk]] ([[calcium carbonate]]). It is used to make surfaces white. It protects and presents a clean surface. Whitewash may be used to paint the outsides and the insides of homes and other buildings. 
 
 Other things may be added to whitewash, such as [[water glass]] (sodium silicate), [[glue]], [[egg white]], [[Portland cement]], [[salt]], [[soap]], [[milk]], [[flour]], and [[soil]]. To change the colour of whitewash, people used different materials. For example, pig's blood was used to make whitewash pink, and blue [[laundry]] [[dye]] was used to make whitewash blue.
