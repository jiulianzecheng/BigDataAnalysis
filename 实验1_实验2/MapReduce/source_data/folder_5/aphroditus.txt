 The worship of '''Aphroditus''' comes from [[Cyprus]], a cult of a [[masculine]] or [[hermaphrodite]] form of [[Aphrodite]]. The divinity was introduced into [[Greece]] and celebrated in [[Athens]] in a cross-dressing [[ritual]]. 
 
 ==Mythology== 
 It is thought that [[Hesiod]]'s myth, explaining the birth of Aphrodite, born when [[Cronus]] cut off the genitals of [[Uranus]] and threw it into the sea, originated from the cult of Aphroditus. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC found at [[w:Perachora|Perachora]] in Greece, representing Aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals, suggests this, as there are two different myths of the creation of Aphrodite. 
 
 ==Cult== 
 According to [[w:Macrobius|Macrobius]], Aphroditus was represented in Cyprus with a [[beard]] and [[phallus]], wearing female clothing and holding a scepter. At sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The cult spread from Cyprus into southern [[Asia Minor]], eventually reaching mainland [[Greece]] around the late 5th century BC. In Athens, the iconography of the god took on the ''anasyromenos'' pose, a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus, a gesture that had [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] qualities, much like the god [[Priapus]]. By the [[Hellenistic]] period, the cult and [[w:votives|votives]] had spread throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. 
 
 ==Evolution== 
 Gradually over time the cult lost popularity, Aphroditus was also being called [[Hermaphroditus]], which originally meant Aphroditus in the form of a [[Herma|herm]] or  " a herm of Aphroditus " . These were marble or bronze sculptures with a head or torso above a plain rectangular pillar, a symbol of [[fertility]]. In later [[Greek mythology]], Hermaphroditus came to be known as the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.
