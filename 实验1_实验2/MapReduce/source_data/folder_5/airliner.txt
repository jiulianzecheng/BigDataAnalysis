An '''airliner''' is a type of [[transport]] aircraft for transporting [[passengers]] and [[air cargo]]. Such [[aircraft]] are most often operated by [[airline]]s, and faster than [[ship]]s or [[railway|trains]]. The largest airliners are [[jet aircraft]] called  " wide-body aircraft " . These aircraft are frequently called ''twin-aisle aircraft'' because they generally have two separate [[wikt:aisle|aisle]]s running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. < ref name=GS > {{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/civil-aircraft-narrowbody.htm|title=Narrow-Body / Single Aisle Aircraft|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|access-date=7 October 2015}} < /ref >  These aircraft are usually used for [[Flight length#long-haul|long-haul flights]] between [[airline hub]]s and major cities with many passengers. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the  " narrow-body aircraft "  or ''single aisle'' aircraft. These smaller airliners are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts. < ref name=GS/ >
