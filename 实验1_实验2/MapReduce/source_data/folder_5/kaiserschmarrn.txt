 ==Overview== 
 Kaiserschmarrn is a light, caramelized [[pancake]].  It is made from a sweet batter using [[flour]], [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, sugar, salt, and [[milk]], baked in [[butter]]. Kaiserschmarrn can be prepared in different ways.  When making Kaiserschmarrn the egg-whites are usually separated from the yolk and beaten until stiff. Then the flour and the yolks are mixed with sugar, and the other ingredients are added.  The pancake is split into pieces while frying, shredded after preparation.  It is usually sprinkled with powdered sugar, then served hot with apple or plum sauce or various fruit compotes. Kaiserschmarrn is eaten like a dessert. 
 
 Traditionally Kaiserschmarrn is served with ''Zwetschkenröster'', a fruit compote made out of Plums.
