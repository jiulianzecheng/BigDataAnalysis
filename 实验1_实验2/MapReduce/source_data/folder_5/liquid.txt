 A '''liquid''' is a form of [[matter]]. It is settled between [[solid]] and [[gas]]. Liquid has an almost-fixed [[volume]], but no set shape. < ref > {{Cite web

 Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by [[Flux|flowing]]. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the [[shape]] of the [[container]]. The [[molecules]] that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves. < ref > {{Cite web

 It is difficult (near impossible) to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a [[solid]].  This temperature is called the [[melting point]] or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid.  If a liquid is heated up it becomes a [[gas]].  The temperature this happens at is called the [[boiling point]].   
 
 Examples of liquid are [[water]], [[oil]]s, [[tar]] and [[blood]]. 
 
 In a liquid, the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath, so at the bottom the [[pressure]], ''p'', is bigger than at the top. The equation for working this out is: 
 
 :''p = ρgz'' 
 
 where ''z'' is the depth of the point below the surface and ''g'' is how strong [[gravity]] is pulling on the liquid. ''ρ'' is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the [[density]] and it is different for all liquids.
