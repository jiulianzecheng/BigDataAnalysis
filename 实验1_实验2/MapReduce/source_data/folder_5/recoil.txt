 == Physics of recoil == 
 Recoil is explained by [[Newton's third law|Newtonâ€™s third law of motion]]. < ref name=Puryear > {{cite web |url=https://www.learnaboutguns.com/2008/04/28/facts-about-recoil-and-guns-for-people-who-are-sensitive-to-recoil/ |title=Facts about Recoil, and Guns for People who are Sensitive to Recoil |author=Eric D. Puryear|date=28 April 2008 |publisher=LearnAboutGuns.com |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >  It is usually [[wikt:paraphrase|paraphrase]]d as:  " to every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction " . < ref name=Hallowell > {{cite web |url=http://www.hallowellco.com/abbrevia.htm#R |title=Illustrated Firearms Dictionary |author=Morris L. Hallowell IV |publisher=Hallowell  &  Co., Inc |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >  In simpler terms, when a [[projectile]] and the hot [[gas]]ses go forward, the firearm goes backwards. < ref name=Puryear/ >  There are a number of factors that determine the amount of backward force. 
 
 * Projectile mass - The bullet, [[wikt:shot|shot]] or [[shell (projectile)|shell]] fired from any size gun has an effect on recoil. The heavier the projectile, the more the recoil. < ref name=Puryear/ > 
 * Gun mass - The heavier the gun, the less the recoil. < ref name=Puryear/ > 
 * Speed of the projectile - The faster the bullet, shot or shell, the more the recoil. < ref name=Puryear/ >  Also, the recoil will happen quicker than with a low mass projectile. This is felt as a  " sharper' recoil by the shooter. < ref name=Puryear/ > 
 
 For [[example]], a [[.22 Long Rifle]] (the designation of the bullet not the gun) has very little recoil. < ref name=Stillwater > {{cite web |url=http://www.stillwaterarmory.com/caliber-confusion.html |title=Caliber Confusion |publisher=Stillwater Armory |access-date=9 August 2016 |archive-date=3 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803125314/http://www.stillwaterarmory.com/caliber-confusion.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  For this reason it is a [[caliber]] recommended for beginning shooters and, because the rounds are cheap, it is good practice [[ammunition]] for more experienced shooters. < ref name=Stillwater/ >  It is a favorite ammunition for [[Shooting sport|target shooting]]. By comparison, the [[.500 S & W Magnum]] handgun round has very heavy recoil. < ref name=Stillwater/ >  Also, the recoil from the .500 magnum round is more sharply felt since the recoil speed is much greater. 
 
 == Recoil anticipation == 
 One of the first things new shooters want to know is if a gun will kick them. < ref name=Gross60 > W.H.  " Chip "  Gross, ''Young Beginner's Guide to Shooting and Archery'' (Minneapolis, MN: Creative Publishing International, 2009), p. 60 < /ref >  New shooters learn to hold the gun firmly to reduce and control recoil. If firing a handgun, use both hands. < ref name=Gross60/ >  If firing a shotgun or rifle, press it firmly against the shoulder and press your cheek on the [[Stock (firearms)|gunstock]]. < ref name=Gross60/ >  But, instructors often tell new students that recoil is 80% [[mental]] and only 20% [[wikt:physical|physical]]. < ref name=Findley > {{cite web |url=http://www.usacarry.com/proper-grip-guidelines-techniques-recoil-control/ |title=Proper Grip: Guidelines  &  Techniques for Recoil Control |author=Ben Findley |date=22 March 2013 |publisher=USA Carry |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >  In other words, no matter how well you hold the weapon, recoil anticipation can ruin every shot. 
 
 Recoil anticipation, or more commonly known as  " [[wikt:flinch|flinch]]ing " , is the unintended (not [[wikt:intend|intend]]ed or [[wikt:plan|plan]]ned mental and physical response to firing a gun. The shooter knows the loud noise and shock of firing the weapon is coming and at the last moment flinches. This often causes an inexperienced shooter to hit low of the intended target. < ref name=HgunSkills > {{cite web |url=http://www.handgunskills.com/drill-of-the-month/eliminating-anticipation-of-recoil/ |title=Eliminating Anticipation of Recoil |date=2016 |publisher=Handgun Skills |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >  Another form of recoil anticipation is when new shooters [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] move the gun forward while pressing the trigger. < ref name=HgunSkills/ >  This is very difficult for instructors to see until the shooter presses the trigger on an empty chamber. Only then can the instructor see the shooter moving the gun forward. < ref name=HgunSkills/ >   
 
 Another problem is [[wikt:jerk|jerk]]ing the trigger. Instead of smoothly pulling the trigger while concentrating on the target, an inexperienced shooter often  " jerks "  the trigger. < ref name=BFindley > {{cite web |url=http://exclusive.multibriefs.com/content/7-trigger-control-errors-and-how-to-fix-them/law-enforcement-defense-security |title=7 trigger control errors and how to fix them |author=Ben Findley |date=16 October 2015 |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >  If shooters are consistently hitting low and to the left ([[Right-handedness|right handed]] shooters) they are usually jerking the trigger. < ref name=BFindley/ >  Shooters probably don't understand that quickly yanking the trigger back ruins the shot. 
 
 All forms of recoil anticipation are eliminated or reduced through practice. < ref name=BFindley/ >  Good instruction in safe firearms practices is also very important. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.agirlandagun.org/hiring-firearms-instructor-important/ |title=Why Hiring a Firearms Instructor is Important |author=Robyn Sandoval; Barb Lucas |publisher=A Girl and A Gun Women's Shooting League, LLC |access-date=9 August 2016}} < /ref >
