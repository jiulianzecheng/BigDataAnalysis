 A '''pebble''' is a piece of [[clastic rock|rock]] with a [[particle size]] of 4 to 64 millimetres. They are often made of [[flint]]. 
 
 Pebbles are larger than granules (2 to 4 millimetres diameter) and smaller than cobbles (64 to 256 millimetres diameter). A rock made predominantly of pebbles is termed a [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]. Pebble tools are among the earliest known man-made [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], dating from the [[Palaeolithic]] period of human history. 
 
 A beach composed chiefly of surface pebbles is commonly termed a [[shingle beach]]. This type of beach resists wave [[erosion]], and has [[ecological niche]]s which can provide [[habitat]] for animals and plants.
