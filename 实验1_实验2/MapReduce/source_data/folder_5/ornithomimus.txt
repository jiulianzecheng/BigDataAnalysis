 '''''Ornithomimus''''' was a lightly built fast-running [[North America]]n feathered [[dinosaur]].  
 
 ''Ornithomimus'' had [[three]] [[toe]]s on each [[foot]], long arms and  neck, but a small head. It also had [[claw]]s on each hand and foot. It had no [[teeth]] and weak [[jaw]]s, which might mean it was [[omnivorous]]. 
 
 ''Ornithomimus edmonticus'' was the largest species, 12 ft (3.5 meters) long, 7 feet (2.10 meters) high and weighed about 100-150 & nbsp;kg. It walked on two legs and looked slightly like an [[ostrich]], except for its long tail.  
 
 There has been trouble with naming. Some speciments are put in other [[genera]], like '''''Dromiceiomimus''''' and ''[[Struthiomimus]]''. < ref > Claessens L; Loewen M. and Lavender Z. 2011.

 == Feathers == 
 In 1995, 2008 and 2009, three ''O. edmontonicus'' specimens with evidence of feathers were found. Two adults had quill knobs on the lower arm, indicating the former presence of bird-like feather shafts. A juvenile had impressions of long fluffy feathers in the form of hair-like filaments covering the rump, legs and neck.  
 
 The feather imprints were found in [[sandstone]], previously thought to not be able to support such impressions. < ref > Zelenitsky D.K. ''et al'' 2012.
