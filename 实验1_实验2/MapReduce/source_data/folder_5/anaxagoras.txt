 '''Anaxagoras''' ({{lang-el|Ἀναξαγόρας}}, fl. < ref > " Flourished " , meaning his exact dates of birth and death are not known. < /ref >  480 [[BC]] – 450 BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]]. Anaxagoras was an [[Ionia]]n Greek. He was born in [[Asia Minor]], in Clazomenae. This was a town in what is now [[Turkey]]. 
 
 Anaxagoras was the first known [[atheist]]. He also introduced the concept of ''νούσ'' (''nous'', or mind), the ordering force behind the [[Universe]]. But he did not take this idea any further. < ref > Thrower J. 1985. ''The alternative tradition: religion and the rejection of religion in the Ancient World''. The Hague: Mouton, p156/7. < /ref > 
 
 He held that the [[Sun]] was not a god, but just material. It was a  " red-hot mass many times larger than the [[Peloponnese]] " . The Moon was a solid body with geographical features, and made of the same substance as the Earth. < ref > Robertson J.M. 1969. ''History of freethought in the West'', volume II. London: Dawsons, p166, 181, 395/6. < /ref > 
 
 Anaxagoras was eventually arrested and prosecuted for freethought. He was banished from [[Athens]] for impiety in 450 BC. However, his works were available in [[Socrates]]' day for a [[drachma]]. < ref > Watson, Peter 2009. ''Ideas: a history: from fire to Freud'', volume II. Chapter 25: The 'Atheist Scare' and the advent of doubt. p120 et seq, London: Folio Society. < /ref >
