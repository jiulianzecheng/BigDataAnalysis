 '''''Ichthyornis''''' (meaning  " fish bird " ) was a [[tern]]-like bird which lived 93-83.5 million years ago in the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. It lived in flocks, nested on shorelines, and hunted for [[fish]] in the [[Western Interior Seaway]], a huge [[inland sea]] in what is now [[North America]].  
 
 == Description == 
 ''Ichthyornis'' was about 8 inches (20 cm) long. It had a large head, toothed jaws, and a long [[beak]]. This powerful flyer is the oldest-known bird that had a keeled breastbone (sternum) similar to that of modern [[bird]]s. 
 
 ''Ichthyornis'' was originally found in 1872 in [[Kansas]] by  [[Benjamin Franklin]] Mudge, a professor from Kansas State Agricultural College. [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Othniel C. Marsh]] of  [[Yale University]] described and named the first fossils. Fossils of the bird have been found in Kansas, [[Texas]] and [[Alberta]].
