'''Encephalitis''' is [[acute (medicine)|sudden]] [[inflammation]] (swelling) in the brain.  It is usually caused by [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], or other [[pathogen]]s.  As the brain swells, it can [[brain damage|get damaged]] when it gets crushed against the [[skull]].  Encephalitis can cause serious [[symptom]]s, like [[seizure]]s and [[stroke]]s, and can be [[fatal]]. < ref name=ninds > {{Cite web |title = Meningitis and Encephalitis Fact Sheet |url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalitis_meningitis/detail_encephalitis_meningitis.htm |website = www.ninds.nih.gov |publisher = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) |accessdate = February 3, 2016 |archive-date = January 4, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212119/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalitis_meningitis/detail_encephalitis_meningitis.htm |url-status = dead }} < /ref >   In 2013, encephalitis killed about 77,000 people in the world. < ref name=GBD204 > {{cite journal| authors=Naghavi M; Wang H; ''et al.'' 2014 |title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=The Lancet |year=2015 |pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 Usually, adults with encephalitis have a [[fever]] that starts suddenly, a [[headache]], [[mental confusion|confusion]], and sometimes seizures.  Younger children or [[infant]]s may be irritable (easily upset), not want to eat, and have a fever.  Usually, patients are either very tired or confused. < ref > {{cite web| title = Symptoms of encephalitis| url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Encephalitis/Pages/Symptoms.aspx| website =NHS Choices| publisher=National Health Service of the United Kingdom| date=December 16, 2014 |accessdate = February 3, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 A stiff neck is a sign that the person has either [[meningitis]] (inflammation of the [[meninges]], which cover the brain) or [[meningoencephalitis]] (swelling of both the meninges and the brain). < ref > {{Cite book|title = Meningitis|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KI5p3pADvSsC & q=meningoencephalitis%2520symptoms%2520stiff%2520neck & pg=PA90|publisher = Infobase Publishing|date = January 1, 2010|isbn = 9781438132167|first1 = Brian|last1 = Shmaefsky|first2 = Hilary|last2 = Babcock}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 
 ===Viruses=== 
 Viral encephalitis can happen when a virus infects the brain.  The most common causes are the [[rabies]] virus, [[herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus (HSV)]], the [[poliomyelitis|polio]] virus, and the [[measles]] virus. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Measles-induced encephalitis |journal=QJM |volume=108 |pmid=24865261 |doi=10.1093/qjmed/hcu113 |author=Fisher DL; Defres S; ''et al.'' 2015 |year=2015 |issue=3 |pages=177–182}} < /ref >   Viral encephalitis can also be caused by a ''latent'' virus - a virus that hides from the body's [[immune system]] the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]].  Two examples of viruses that cause latent infection are the varicella-zoster viruses, which can hide in the brain after causing [[chicken pox]], and the [[herpes simplex]] virus. < ref name= " Rozenberg " > {{Cite journal | last=Rozenberg F; Deback C; ''et al.'' 2011 | title=Herpes simplex encephalitis: From virus to therapy | journal=Infectious Disorders Drug Targets | year=2011 | volume=11 | issue=3 | pages=235–250 | pmid=21488834 | doi=10.2174/187152611795768088 }} < /ref > 
 
 About 100 different viruses can infect the brain. < ref > {{cite journal |author=van den Pol, AN 2009 |title=Viral infection leading to brain dysfunction: More prevalent than appreciated? |journal=Neuron |year=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=17–20 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.09.023 |pmid=19840542 |pmc=2782954 }} < /ref >   Other examples include [[West Nile virus]], [[Chikungunya]] virus, and [[Japanese encephalitis]] virus. < ref > {{Cite journal|title = Viral Encephalitis: Causes, Differential Diagnosis, and Management|url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/75/suppl_1/i10|journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery  &  Psychiatry|issn = 1468-330X|pmc = 1765650|pmid = 14978145|pages = i10–i15|volume = 75|issue = suppl 1|doi = 10.1136/jnnp.2003.034280|author=Kennedy PGE 2004|year = 2004}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Bacteria=== 
 Encephalitis can happen when a person gets a bacterial infection, like bacterial meningitis. < ref > {{Cite book|title = Johns Hopkins Internal Medicine Board Review: Certification and Recertification|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KLBZ85zbTeYC & q=bacterial%2520meningitis%2520inflmation%2520of%2520encepha%2520definition & pg=PA113|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences|date = January 1, 2012|isbn = 978-1455706921|first1 = Bimal H.|last1 = Ashar|first2 = Redonda G.|last2 = Miller|first3 = Stephen D.|last3 = Sisson}} < /ref >   It can also be a [[complication]] of an infectious disease that a person already has, like [[syphilis]].  This is called  " secondary encephalitis. " < ref > {{Cite journal|title = Neurosyphilis with Mesiotemporal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Abnormalities|url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/internalmedicine/47/20/47_20_1813/_article|journal = Internal Medicine|pages = 1813–1817|volume = 47|issue = 20|doi = 10.2169/internalmedicine.47.0983|author=Hama K; Ishiguchi H; ''et al.'' 2008|year = 2008|pmid = 18854635}} < /ref >   
 
 Examples of other bacteria which can cause encephalitis are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', which causes [[toxic shock syndrome]]; ''Bordetella pertussis'', which causes [[pertussis]] (whooping cough); and types of ''Borellia'' bacteria, which cause [[Lyme disease]]. 
 
 ===Parasites=== 
 Some [[parasite]]s can infect the brain, especially in people who have weak immune systems.  Examples include ''[[Toxoplasma|Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which causes [[toxoplasmosis]]; two parasites from the [[species]] ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' ''brucei'', which cause [[African trypanosomiasis]] (African sleeping sickness); and ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites, which cause [[malaria]]. 
 
 ===Autoimmune diseases=== 
 [[Autoimmune disease]]s can cause encephalitis if the body's immune system attacks the brain, the [[spinal cord]], and their [[nerve]]s.  Two examples are [[autoimmune encephalitis]] and [[acute disseminated encephalitis]].   < ref > {{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/791896-overview#a4 |title=Encephalitis: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology |last1=Howes |first1=David S. |date=October 12, 2015 |website=Medscape |publisher=WebMD LLC |accessdate=February 3, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|title = Autoimmune Encephalitis in Children|journal = Journal of Child Neurology|issn = 0883-0738|pmc = 3705178|pmid = 22935553|pages = 1460–1469|volume = 27|issue = 11|doi = 10.1177/0883073812448838|author=Armangue T; Petit-Pedro M; ''et al.'' 2012|year = 2012}} < /ref >

 ==Diagnosis== 
 Encephalitis can be [[medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] in a few different ways: < ref > {{Cite web|title = Encephalitis - Diagnosis|url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Encephalitis/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx| date=December 16, 2014 |website =NHS Choices |publisher=National Health System of the United Kingdom|accessdate = February 3, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 * An [[MRI]] (brain scan) can show brain swelling, and also show whether there are other brain problems causing a patient's symptoms 
 * An [[EEG]] (a picture of the brain's electrical activity) will show signals that are not normal 
 * A [[lumbar puncture]] (spinal tap) will show whether there is an infection in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (which bathes the brain and spinal cord) 
 * [[Blood test]]s or [[urine]] tests may show whether a person has encephalitis, or if they have another illness instead 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 Some treatments for encephalitis depend on the cause: < ref name=tx > {{Cite web|title=Encephalitis|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001415.htm| author=Kaneshiro, Neil |website =MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |date=August 30, 2014 |publisher= United States National Library of Medicine |accessdate =February 3, 2015}} < /ref > 
 * Viral encephalitis is treated with [[anti-viral]] [[medication]]s 
 * Bacterial encephalitis is treated with [[antibiotic]] medications 
 
 Other treatments are  " supportive "  - they treat the symptoms of encephalitis.  For example: < ref name=tx/ > < ref name=ninds/ > 
 * [[Steroid]] medications are used to decrease swelling in the brain 
 * [[Anticonvulsant]] medications can stop seizures 
 * [[Sedative]] medications can help with restlessness and irritability 
 * [[Acetaminophen]] can decrease fever and headache 
 * [[Physical therapy]] and [[speech therapy]] can help if the person has trouble moving or [[speech|speaking]] after their infection is gone 
 
 [[File:Poliodrops.jpg|thumb|A child gets a polio vaccine]] 
 ==Prevention== 
 [[Vaccine]]s have made encephalitis from some diseases much less common.  These diseases include measles, [[mumps]], [[rubella]] (German measles), polio, [[varicella]] (chicken pox), and pertussis (whooping cough). < ref name=tx/ >   There are also vaccines for rabies, bacterial meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and some other diseases that can cause encephalitis. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/default.htm |title=Vaccines and Preventable Diseases |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=September 3, 2015 |website=CDC.gov |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=February 2, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 People can protect themselves from diseases that are spread by [[insect]]s, like Lyme disease and malaria, by avoiding insect bites.  For example, they can use [[bug spray]]; wear long sleeves and long pants; sleep under a [[mosquito net]]; and make sure they have good window and door screens. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html |title=West Nile Virus: Prevention  &  Control |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=November 10, 2015 |website=CDC.gov |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=February 1, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >
