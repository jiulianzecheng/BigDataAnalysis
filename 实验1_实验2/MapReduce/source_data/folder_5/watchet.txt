 '''Watchet''' is a [[harbor]] [[town]] in the [[county]] of [[Somerset]] in [[England]]. It gets its name either from the blue ''wacet'' [[dye]] found in the cliffs, or from British ''gwo coed'' or ''waeced'',  " under the wood " .  
 ==History== 
 It is first recorded in the [[7th century]], when [[Saint Decuman]] crossed over from South [[Wales]] on a raft with a cow to help the people there. Legend says he was killed there by a violent man who cut off his head. There is a spring of water dedicated to him there.  
 
 [[Coins]] were minted here for [[Ethelred II]] and five other [[Saxon]] kings. They have been found as far away as [[Scandinavia]], probably because they were part of the [[Danegeld]] - payments made to the [[Vikings]], who attacked Watchet in [[918]], [[977]], [[988]], and destroyed part of it in [[997]]. [[Harold Godwinson]]'s mother Eleanor fled through this port in [[1066]]. 
 
 Watchet is the only place in England to still have the [[Court leet]] system, but only in name, with people chosen for [[ceremony|ceremonial]] jobs like [[port reeve]] and [[ale taster]].
