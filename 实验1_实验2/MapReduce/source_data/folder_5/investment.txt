In finance, '''Investment''' or '''investing''' means that an [[asset]] is bought, or that money is put into a [[bank]] to get a future [[interest]] from it. Investment is total amount of money spent by a [[shareholder]] in buying [[Share (finance)|shares]] of a company. In economic management sciences, [[Investment bank|investments]] means longer-term savings. 
 
 It is a term used in [[business]] [[management]], [[finance]] and [[economics]], related to saving or deferring [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Literally, the word means the  " action of putting something in to somewhere else "  (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or 'vestment'). 
 
 ==Types of investment== 
 There are two major uses of the term investment between the [[economics]] field and the [[finance]] field. Economists refer to a real investment (such as a machine or a house), while [[Finance|financial]] economists refer to a financial asset, such as money that is put into a bank or the market which may then be used to buy a real asset. Advisors, who tell people how to manage their investments, might say that even when an investment is losing money because of bad times, not to give up and withdraw it.  Instead, wait for the situation to improve. This is a risk for each person to decide. 
 
 == Business management == 
 The investment decision (also known as ''capital budgeting'') is one of the fundamental decisions of [[business]] [[management]].
