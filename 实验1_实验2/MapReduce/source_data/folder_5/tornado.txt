 A '''tornado''' is a tube of violently spinning [[air]] that touches the [[ground]]. [[Wind]] inside the tornado spins fast, but the actual 'circle' of wind around them is huge. This makes tornadoes very dangerous. < ref name= " Glossary of Meteorology " > {{cite web| url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=t & p=34| title = Glossary of Meteorology, 2nd ed| accessdate = 2006-11-17| publisher = American Meteorological Society| year = 2000| archive-date = 2007-04-06| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406051559/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=t & p=34| url-status = dead}} < /ref >  Tornadoes are especially dangerous to people in cars or mobile homes and about 60 people are killed by tornadoes every year. The word  " tornado "  might come from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''tronada'' (thunderstorm), which comes from the word ''tronar'' (to thunder). < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/tornado|first=Douglas|last=Harper|title=Etymology of tornado|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date=2022-04-13}} < /ref > 
 
 Tornadoes destroy things. They can tear houses to pieces and often leave people [[homeless]]. Tornadoes can be caused by winds that have been going opposite directions with [[humidity]]. They are smaller than hurricanes but stronger. Nearly three quarters of the world's tornadoes happen in the [[United States]]. However, they can happen anywhere. 
 
 Tornadoes mostly happen during strong [[storm|thunderstorms]] called [[supercell|super cell]] storms. They cause a lot of damage to anything in their path. Tornadoes are ranked on the Enhanced [[Fujita scale]], from EF0 to EF5. EF0 is used for tornadoes that cause the least amount of damage, and EF5 is used for tornadoes that cause the most amount of damage. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html|title=Fujita Tornado Damage Scale|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=2017-11-01}} < /ref > 
 
 Tornadoes can happen in nearly any part of the world. In the [[United States]], a tornado has happened in every state. The middle part of the United States is nicknamed  " [[Tornado Alley]] "  because of the number of tornadoes there. A tornado can have wind speeds of over 300 miles per hour (480 & nbsp;km/h). Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 & nbsp;km/h), are about 250 feet (80 m) across and travel a few miles before disappearing. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, [[fire whirl]]s, and steam devil; downbursts are frequently confused with tornadoes, though their action is not similar. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 === Condensation funnel === 
 A tornado does not necessarily need to be visible; however, the extremely low pressure caused by the high wind speeds and rapid rotation usually causes [[water vapor]] in the air to condense into a visible ''condensation funnel''. The tornado is the [[vortex]] of [[wind]], not the condensation [[cloud]]. 
 
 === Tornado family === 
 A single storm may produce multiple tornadoes and [[mesocyclone]]s. Tornadoes produced from the same storm are referred to as a ''tornado family''. Sometimes multiple tornadoes from distinct mesocyclones occur at the same time. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php%23t|title=A Comprehensive Glossary of Weather Terms for Storm Spotters|accessdate=2007-02-27|last=Branick|first=Michael|year=2006|publisher=NOAA|archive-date=2003-08-03|archive-url=https://archive.today/20030803230231/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/severewx/glossary4.php%23t|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 Occasionally, several tornadoes are spawned from the same very large storm. If there is no break in their activity, this is considered a ''tornado outbreak'', although there are various definitions. A period of several successive days with tornado outbreaks in the same general area (spawned by multiple weather systems) is a ''tornado outbreak sequence'', occasionally called an extended tornado outbreak''. < ref name= " Glossary of Meteorology " / > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/81933.pdf|title=Tornado Outbreak Day Sequences: Historic Events and Climatology (1875–2003)|accessdate=2007-03-20|author=Dylan J.

 Sometimes, tornadoes happen in groups. < ref name=storm > {{cite book |last= Herman| first = Gail |title= Storm Chasers| publisher = Penguin Group |date= 15 May 2010| location = New York |page= |url= |isbn= 978-0-448-43337-0}} < /ref >  148 tornadoes struck on the same day in April 1974. Many towns in the midwestern [[United States]] and [[Canada]] were destroyed. More than 300 people died. < ref name=storm / >  They were hit by flying wrecks, buried under [[house]]s, and thrown by powerful winds. That day, students in Xenia, Ohio were practicing for a play on the auditorium stage. One girl looked out the window and saw the tornado. The students ran into the hall, covering their heads. A few seconds later, all the school buses flew right onto the stage. < ref name=storm / > 
 
 A man in another town hid under the couch in his [[living room]]. He held onto one couch leg. The tornado struck his house, and winds blew around him. When the tornado left, he was outside. There was no house. The couch had disappeared, and he was only holding onto one couch leg. < ref name=storm / >

 {{Main|Tornado intensity and damage}} 
 {{See also|Enhanced Fujita scale|Fujita scale|TORRO scale}} 
 
 The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by how much damage they cause. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale. The updated scale uses engineered wind estimates and has better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would get the same numerical rating, and was used in the United States since 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not big buildings, whereas an [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|EF5]] tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them destroyed and even damage big [[skyscraper]]s. 
 
 In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. Less than 1% of tornadoes are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). < ref name= " Basic Spotter Guide " > {{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/basicspotterguide.pdf|title=Basic Spotters' Field Guide|accessdate=2006-11-01|author=Edwards, Moller, Purpura|date=1998-03-31|work=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808170431/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/pah/pdf/basicspotterguide.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-08 |display-authors=etal}} < /ref >

 A  " tornado watch "  is given when the [[weather]] conditions look like a tornado could form. A 'PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation)' watch is given when a likely tornado outbreak is to start, many strong tornadoes will form in the area, or an ongoing tornado outbreak is in the works in the area. A  " [[tornado warning]] "  is given if somebody has actually seen a tornado or if a tornado 'signature' (usually the storm has a [[hook echo|'hook' or 'U' echo]]) has shown up on [[weather radar|radar]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/ready/tornado/risk.html |title=Tornado Season, Watches, and Warnings|access-date=2010-08-27 |archive-date=2010-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812090147/http://www.weather.com/ready/tornado/risk.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Tornado emergency|Tornado emergencies]] are issued in Special Weather Statements or Tornado Warnings saying that a powerful tornado is about to hit an area with a lot of people in it (especially cities in Tornado Alley), a tornado has been spotted, and the tornado is expected to cause deaths. 
 
 ==Myths and misconceptions== 
 [[File:1999 Salt Lake City tornado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[1999 Salt Lake City tornado]] disproved several misconceptions, including the idea that tornadoes cannot happen in cities.]] 
 It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by a tornado. While there is a big drop in [[atmospheric pressure]] inside a strong tornado, it is unlikely that the pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the tornado's damage. < ref name= " tornado project myths " / >  A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed. < ref name= " tornado project myths " > {{cite web|url=http://www.tornadoproject.com/safety/myths.htm|title=Myths and Misconceptions about Tornadoes|accessdate=2007-02-28|author=Tim Marshall|publisher=The Tornado Project|date=2005-03-15}} < /ref > < ref name= " tornado myths " > {{cite book|author=Thomas P Grazulis|title=The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm|url=https://archive.org/details/tornadonaturesul0000graz|year=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3258-7|chapter=Tornado Myths}} < /ref > 
 Another common misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. Due to the [[Venturi effect]], tornadic winds are stronger in the small space of an overpass. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadosafety.html|title=Tornado Myths, Facts, and Safety|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|date=2006-08-17|author=Climate Services and Monitoring Division|accessdate=2012-03-27|archive-date=2012-08-05|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805094607/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadosafety.html|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  In the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly hit by tornadoes.

 == Safety tips == 
 To keep safe in a tornado, here are some tips you can follow: < ref name=cream > {{cite book |last=Oard |first= Michael |title= The Weather Book |publisher= Master Books |date=1997 |location= P.O. Box 126, Green Forest, AR 72638 |page= |isbn= 0-89051-211-6}} < /ref > 
 * Go to the lowest [[floor]] of the building. Stay close to the center of the [[building]] and away from [[window]]s, for example, a bathroom with no windows and get into the bathtub. 
 * Find a piece of strong furniture or a mattress to go under or hide in a closet and wait until it is over. 
 * If you are in a school, do ''not'' go to the gymnasium or any other place that has a high ceiling. Squat near the wall, placing your hands on the back of your head. 
 * If you cannot find shelter, find the lowest, most protected ground and cover your head with your hands. 
 * Do not drive in tornadoes. If you are in your car, position your head above the steering wheel, and cover yourself up. 
 * Do not seek shelter underneath an underpass or a bridge, as winds can send debris in your path.
