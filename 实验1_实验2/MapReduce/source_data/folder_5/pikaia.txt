 '''''Pikaia''''' is an extinct genus of prehistoric [[lancelet]]. It is regarded as the earliest known primitive [[chordate]] from the Middle [[Cambrian]] fossil found near Mount Pika in the [[Burgess Shale]] of [[British Columbia]]. It was discovered by [[Charles Walcott]] in [[1911]]. Walcott classified it as a [[polychaete]] worm. 
 It was about 40 & nbsp;mm in length and swam above the sea-floor. ''Pikaia'' may have filtered particles from the water as it swam along. Only 60 specimens have been found to date.
