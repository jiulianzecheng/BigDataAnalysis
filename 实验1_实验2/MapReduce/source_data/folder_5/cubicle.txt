 A '''cubicle''' is a small room. It can be a small work space often seen in [[office]]s. It can also be a place used for changing [[clothes]] in, often found at [[swimming pool]]s and [[gymnasium]]s. 
 ==History== 
 [[Robert Propst]] designed the first cubicle in 1964. He wanted to  " empower "  people, and make them work better. Propst worked for a home furnishings [[company]] called [[Herman Miller]] at the time. In 1968, when the company started selling the cubicle, it did not sell well. Herman Miller later designed a new type of cubicle that was cheaper. The cubicle is now very popular in offices around the world. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/a-brief-history-of-how-the-cubicle-2014-4|title=A Brief History Of How The Cubicle Took Over Offices Everywhere|first=Drake|last=Baer|website=Business Insider}} < /ref >
