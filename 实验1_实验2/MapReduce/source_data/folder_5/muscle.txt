 '''Muscle''' is a [[tissue (biological)|tissue]] in animal [[body|bodies]]. Their main purpose is to help us to move our body parts. They are one of the major systems of human and animal bodies. When a muscle is activated it contracts, making itself shorter and thicker, thereby pulling its ends closer.   
 
 
 == Types of muscles == 
 There are three kinds of muscles: 
 *[[Skeletal muscle]], the muscle attached to [[bone]]s. They pull on [[bone]]s to make movements.  
 *[[Smooth muscle]], for example, the muscle in [[blood vessel]]s and the [[bladder]] 
 *[[Cardiac muscle]], the muscle of the [[heart]] 
 
 Muscle action can be classified as being either ''voluntary'' or ''involuntary''. 
 
 The skeletal muscles move the limbs (arms and legs). They move the [[jaw]] up and down so that food can be [[chew]]ed. Skeletal muscles are the only ''voluntary'' muscles, the only ones that we can choose to move. 
 
 The cardiac muscle is the muscle in the [[heart]]. When this muscle contracts it pushes blood through the [[circulatory system]]. The cardiac muscle is ''not'' voluntary.  
 
 The smooth muscles are the other muscles in the body that are involuntary. Smooth muscles are in many places. They are in: 
 *The [[gastrointestinal system]] – this includes the [[stomach]] and [[intestines]]. This is how food moves through us and we take energy from it. 
 *[[Blood vessel]]s – smooth muscles make blood vessels smaller or bigger. This controls [[blood pressure]]. 
 *Hairs – smooth muscle in hair [[follicle]]s makes your hair ''stand up'' when you are scared or get cold. 
 
 == Muscle structure == 
 Muscles are made of many muscle [[cell]]s. The cells contract together to make the muscle get shorter. The muscle cells know to do this together because many of them get information sent to them by [[nerve]]s. The cells that get the message from nerves tell other cells that are near them. They tell the other cells by sending an [[electricity|electrical]] [[electric current|current]]. 
 
 Muscle cells are filled with [[proteins]] called [[actin]] and [[myosin]]. These are the proteins that make the muscle contract (get shorter.) 
 
 == Muscle contraction == 
 When a nerve tells a muscle to contract, the muscle opens holes in its cell [[membrane]]. These holes are proteins that are called ''[[calcium]] channels''. The calcium ions rush into the cell. Calcium also comes out of a special place in the cell called the ''sarcoplasmic reticulum''. This calcium sticks to the specialized proteins actin and myosin. This [[trigger]]s these proteins to contract the muscle. 
 
 Contraction also needs [[ATP]]. This is the energy that your cells use. It is made from using glucose in the cell. It takes a lot of energy to release contracted muscles. They use most of the energy for building muscles. 
 
 == Exercise == 
 [[Exercise]] makes muscles get bigger (see [[hypertrophy]]). Exercise also makes muscles stronger.  If a person does not exercise, their muscles become smaller and weaker.  This is called [[muscle atrophy]]. 
 
 == Diseases of muscles == 
 There are many different kinds of muscle [[diseases]]. There are three big groups of diseases: 
 #Neuromuscular diseases – these are problems with how the nerves tell the muscles to move. [[Stroke]]s, [[cerebral palsy]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are neuromuscular diseases. 
 #Motor endplate diseases – these are problems with the place where the nerve tells the muscle to move. [[Tetanus]] and [[myasthenia gravis]] are motor endplate diseases. 
 #Myopathies – these are problems with the structure of the muscle. [[Muscular dystrophy]], [[cancer]]s like [[Ewing's sarcoma]], and [[cardiomyopathy]] are myopathies.
