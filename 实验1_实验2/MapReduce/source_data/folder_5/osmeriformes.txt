 The '''Osmeriformes''' [[Help:IPA/English|/ɒsˈmɛrɪfɔːrmiːz/]] are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[ray-finned fish]]. It includes the '''true or freshwater smelts and allies''', such as the [[Galaxiid|galaxiids]] and [[Noodlefish|noodlefishes]]; they are also called '''osmeriforms'''. They belong to the [[teleost]] [[superorder]] [[Protacanthopterygii]], which also includes [[Pike (fish)|pike]] and [[salmon]] etc.  
 ==Naming== 
 The order's name means  " smelt-shaped " , from ''[[Osmerus]]'' (the [[type genus]]) + the standard [[fish]] order [[suffix]]  " -formes " .  
 
 It derives from [[Ancient Greek]] ''osmé'' (ὀσμή,  " pungent smell " ) + [[Latin]] ''forma'' ( " external form " ), the former in reference to the characteristic aroma of the flesh of ''Osmerus''.
