The '''Pliocene''' ('''Pleiocene''' in older texts) was a short [[geology|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] at the end of the [[Neogene]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pliocene.php|title=The Pliocene Epoch|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu}} < /ref >  It is also the fifth and final epoch of the former [[Tertiary]] period and the fifth epoch of the [[Cainozoic]]. It began 5.3 [[million]] years ago and ended 2.6 million years ago. The Pliocene follows the [[Miocene]] and is followed by the [[Pleistocene]].  
 
 The world continued to get cooler and drier in the Pliocene. [[Tropical]] [[rain forest]]s and [[deciduous]] [[forest]]s shrank. [[Grassland]]s grew, and many [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s became [[grazer]]s instead of [[browser]]s. Of this we are certain, because their teeth tell us what kind of food they ate. Browsers eat leaves and small branches, and grazers eat grass. The concept of ''mesowear'' deals with this. Mesowear is a method based on animals' tooth wear fingerprints. Each animal has special feeding habits, which cause unique tooth wear. Rough feeds cause serious tooth abrasion, while smooth one triggers moderate abrasion. So [[Browser|browsers]] have teeth with moderate abrasion and [[Grazer|grazers]] have teeth with rough abrasion. < ref >  Clauss M; Franz-Odendaal T.A; Brasch J; Castell J.C; Kaiser T. 2007.

 A new [[land bridge]] at Panama brought a [[Great American Interchange]]. [[Hominid]] [[evolution]] took a new turn as some [[ape]]s started to live on the [[savannah]] instead of the forests ([[Australopithecine]]s). Late in the Pliocene the Greenland [[ice cap]] grew and became permanent, and the [[ice sheet]] of [[Antarctica]] grew to cover most of Antarctica.
