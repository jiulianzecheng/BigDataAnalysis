An '''oracle''' (in ancient Greek times) was a person who was seen as a messenger for the gods. The [[Oracle of Delphi]] was the most famous. Oracles would answer questions about the future, and would often speak in riddles. In [[Ancient Greece]] oracles lived in temples and people travelled many miles to visit them and seek their advice. The oracles were a part of [[Greek religion]].
