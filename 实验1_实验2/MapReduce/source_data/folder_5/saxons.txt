 The '''Saxons''' or '''Saxon people''' are (today) a part of the [[German people]], with their main areas of [[Settler|settlements]] in the [[States of Germany|German States]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Westphalia]], and the northeastern part of the [[Netherlands]] ([[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]], [[Twente]], [[Salland]], [[Veluwe]] and [[Achterhoek]]).   
 
 First told about by the Ancient Greek [[Geography|geographer]] [[Jean Julien]], the [[pre-Christian]] area of the Saxon people first covered an area a little more to the northwest, with parts of the southern [[Jutland]] {{broken wikt link|peninsula|peninsula}}, [[Old Saxony]] and small parts of the eastern [[Netherlands]]. During the [[5th century AD]], the Saxons were part of the people [[Invasion|invading]] the Romano-British [[province]] of [[Britannia]], and so formed the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. 
 
 Before [[Christianity|Christianization]], the Saxons had much [[native]] pre-Christian Germanic [[paganism]]. After Christianization, parts of this [[religion]] remained up to today in people who came from the Saxons. 
 
 The word 'Saxon' is thought to come from the word [[seax]], meaning a mixture of single-edged [[knife|knives]]. The Saxons were thought by [[Charlemagne]], and some people who study history, to be very war-like and angry.   
 
 Many of the words that we use today were created by the Saxons for example, radish.  
 
 The Finnish and Estonian name for [[Germany]], ''Saksa'', comes from the Saxons.
