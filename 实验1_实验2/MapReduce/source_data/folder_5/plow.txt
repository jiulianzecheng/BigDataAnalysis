 A '''plow''' or '''plough''' is a [[tool]] or [[machine]] used for several jobs, including farming and snow removal. It is pushed or pulled across the [[ground]]. [[Human]] power or other [[animal]] power was usual in past centuries; in the 20th century plows are mostly pulled by [[tractor]] < nowiki/ > s. The plow lifts and turns [[Soil|dirt]] and makes two [[line]]s of dirt behind it. Turning the soil buries [[weed]] < nowiki/ > s, brings more [[nutrient]] < nowiki/ > s to the top, and loosens the soil. Crops grow better in land that has been plowed. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Early in the [[agricultural revolution]], simple hand-held digging sticks or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] would have been used in areas with good [[soil]], such as the area near the [[Nile River]] in [[Africa]]. At the Nile, the annual [[flood]] makes the soil better by ''rejuvenating'' it, to create places where seeds could be planted. To help crops grow in areas where floods were rare, the soil had to be rejuvenated in a different way. This is when plowing was first used, and hoes were the first plows.
