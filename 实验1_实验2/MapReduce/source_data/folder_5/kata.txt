'''Kata''' (型, 形 means:  " the form " ) is a [[Japan|Japanese]] word which is used in some martial arts and theatre (as [[kabuki]]). In [[karate]], this word describes a [[simulation]] of combat—the [[sequence]] of movements—which is given in detail and is trained individually or in group. Before learning it, the martial artist has to try the [[training]] of basic technique called ''[[kihon]]''. 
 
 Such [[simulation]] represents a sequence of movements, the attack and the defence in an imagined combat. Every attack must be made as if there were an opponent in front of the karateka (the karate fighter) in order to reach him, and every defence must be made as if the opponent attacked in a real situation of danger. Every movement has an [[interpretation]]. The karateka has to show the consideration for its [[timing]] and ability to use it. 
 
 The goal of the ''kata'' is help in the development of the qualities and the abilities both [[psychology|psychological]] and of the body. These abilities are necessary for the real combat.
