 A '''Buddha''' is the holiest type of being in [[Buddhism]], a teacher of God's and humans. The word ''Buddha'' means  " enlightened one "  in [[Sanskrit]] or Fully Awakened One in [[Pāli]]. 
 
 It is also a title for [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]]. He was the man who started Buddhism. Sometimes people call him  " the Buddha "  or the  " Shakyamuni Buddha " . Other times, people call any person a Buddha if they have found [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. If a person has not found enlightenment yet, but is very close to reaching it, then he is called [[bodhisattva]]. 
 
 ==Summary== 
 Buddhists believe that there are many Buddhas. The most recent one was [[Gautama Buddha]]. People who will become Buddhas someday are called  " [[bodhisattva]]s. " 
 
 Buddhists believe that the Buddha was enlightened, which means that he knew all about how to live a peaceful life and how to avoid suffering. He is said to have never argued with other people, but only said what was true and useful, out of compassion for others. < ref > Ajahn Jagaro 1995, [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/1?var=0 & l=1 “What was the Buddha’s life really like?”]{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 Some Buddhists pray to Buddhas, but Buddhas are not [[Deity|gods]]. Buddhas are teachers who help the people who will listen. A Buddha is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the world works. This knowledge totally changes the person so that they can have a better life in the present and the future. A Buddha can also help a person achieve enlightenment. 
 
 There are ideas which are said to lead someone to enlightenment. They are called the ''Dharma'' (Sanskrit) or  " Dhamma "  (Pāli), meaning  " the way "  or  " the truth. "  Anyone can become a Buddha, but it is very difficult. He became Buddha under the peepal or  " bodhi "  tree at Bodhgaya in Bihar in what is now India. 
 
 ==Types of Buddhas== 
 
 There is a special type of Buddha called a ''pratyekabuddha'' or  " silent Buddhas " . These Buddhas reached ''enlightenment'' on their own, but they did not teach others. 
 
 Another type of Buddha is a ''samyaksambuddha''. This is the best kind of Buddha because he is able to teach all living beings. 
 
 ==Seven Buddhas of the past== 
 Buddhists believe that there have been many Buddhas in the past. There will also be many Buddhas in the future. Traditionally, seven Buddhas are given names.
