 '''Gangrene''' is a serious medical condition that causes the [[decay]] and [[Necrosis|death of body tissue]], usually in the extremities such as the fingers, hands, toes, and feet. The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene. A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as [[gas gangrene]].  A very rare type which affects the internal [[organ]]s is known as internal gangrene.  
 
 Dry gangrene is usually caused by a [[Ischaemia|loss of blood supply]] to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the [[blood vessel]]s to the affected area. Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes [[infection|infected]] with various types of [[bacteria]]. Gas gangrene is usually  caused by ''[[clostridium]]'' bacteria and mainly affects the [[muscle]]s. Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the [[intestines]], [[gallbladder]], or [[appendix]]. 
 
 There are a number of [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene. These includes advanced blockage of the arteries in medical conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].
