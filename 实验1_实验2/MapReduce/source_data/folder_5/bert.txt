 '''Bert''' is a golden yellow [[Muppet]] created by [[Jim Henson]]. He was on the TV show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He's Ernie's roommate.  
 
 ==Character== 
 Even though Bert is a grumpy, he is still sometimes happy. He's yellow with a single [[eyebrow]] called a unibrow, and had a vertical striped shirt (compared to Ernie's which is horizontal). He looks like a [[banana]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Bert first appeared in the test episodes of Sesame Street in 1969, with his uni brow never moving, and a little more tame. Then later in the years starting in Season 3 of Sesame Street, Bert can move his uni brow up and down. Starting in 1997, he was funnier and nicer but still grumpy. Bert has known to be changed nine times. 
 
 ==Ernie== 
 Ernie is Bert's brother and [[roommate]]. And is the more clumsy and funny guy. He was first seen the same day Bert first was seen. He was voiced by [[Jim Henson]] until his death in 1990.
