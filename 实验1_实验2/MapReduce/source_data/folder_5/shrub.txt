 A '''shrub''' or '''bush''' is a category of [[plant]]s. A [[tree]] usually has one [[Plant stem|stem]], which at some height has [[branch]]es. A ''shrub'' can have multiple stems from the bottom up. Usually, bushes do not grow as tall as trees, very often they are less than 1–2 m tall. 
 
 Very many  plants can be either shrubs or trees, depending on the growing conditions. Small, low shrubs such as [[lavender]], [[periwinkle (plant)|periwinkle]] and [[thyme]] are often termed [[subshrub]]s. Shrubs can be either [[deciduous]] or [[evergreen]]. 
 
 A '''shrubbery''' is a [[garden]] with shrubs as the main feature. 
 
 == Shrubs as a botanical structural form == 
 In botany and [[ecology]] a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical structural or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than 8 meters high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base. 
 
 For example, a descriptive system widely used in [[Australia]] is based on structural characteristics based on life-form, plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant [[species]]. < ref > Costermans, L. F. (1993) ''Native trees and shrubs of South-Eastern Australia''. rev. ed. {{ISBN|0947116761}} < /ref > 
 
 For shrubs 2–8 m high the following structural forms are categorized: 
 * dense foliage cover (70–100%) — '''closed-scrub''' 
 * mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — '''open-scrub''' 
 * sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — '''tall shrubland''' 
 * very sparse foliage cover ( < 10%) — '''tall open shrubland''' 
 
 For shrubs less than 2 m high the following structural forms are categorized: 
 * dense foliage cover (70–100%) — '''closed-heath''' 
 * mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — '''heath''' 
 * sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — '''low shrubland''' 
 * very sparse foliage cover ( < 10%) — '''low open shrubland'''
