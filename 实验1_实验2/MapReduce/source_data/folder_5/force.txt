 In [[physics]], a '''force''' is a push or pull between ''objects''. It is called an [[wikt:interaction|interaction]] because if one object acts on another, its [[action]]  is ''matched'' by a [[reaction]] from the other object. < ref > " Any single force is only one aspect of a mutual interaction between ''two'' bodies. "  {{harv|Halliday|Resnick |Krane|2001|pp=78–79}} < /ref >  This idea is known as [[Newton's third law]], < ref > {{cite journal

 The ''objects'' are just the things the force acts between. Different forces act between different sorts of object. For example, [[gravity]] acts between objects with [[mass]], like the [[sun]] and the [[earth]]. Another example is [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which acts between objects with [[Electric charge|charge]], like an [[electron]] and the [[nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] of an [[atom]]. ''Gravity'' and ''electromagnetic force'' are two examples of forces.  
 
 A force changes the state of an object (some physical quantity changes) or, strictly, the states of two objects, since the force is an interaction. For example, a force causes an affected object to be pushed or pulled in a certain direction. This  changes the object's [[momentum]]. Forces cause objects to [[acceleration|accelerate]], add to the object's overall [[pressure]], [[torque|change direction]], or [[Deformation|change shape]]. Because the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[:en:Body_relative_direction|direction]] of a force are both important, force is a [[vector]] quantity. The strength of a force is measured in newtons ('''N''').  There are four [[fundamental force]]s in [[physics]]. 
 
 A force is always a push, pull, or a twist, and it affects objects by pushing them up, pulling them down, pushing them to a side, or by changing their motion or [[shape]] in some other way. 
 
 == Newton's Second Law == 
 According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the formula for finding force is: 
 : < math > F = ma < /math > 
 where  < math > F < /math >  is the force,  < br / > 
 < math > m < /math >  is the [[mass]] of an object,  < br / > 
 and  < math > a < /math >  is the [[acceleration]] of the object. 
 
 His second law defines '''a force to be equal to change in momentum (mass times velocity) per change in time'''. Momentum is defined to be the mass m of an object times its velocity V.  
 
 === Weight === 
 
 Gravity is an acceleration. Everything that has a mass is being pulled toward the Earth because of that acceleration. This pull is a force called weight.  
 
 One can take the equation above and change  < math > a < /math >  to the standard [[gravity]] ''g'', then a formula about the gravity on earth can be found: 
 
 : < math > W = mg < /math > 
 where  < math > W < /math >  is the [[weight]] of an object,  < br / > 
 < math > m < /math >  is the mass of an object,  < br / > 
 and  < math > g < /math >  is the acceleration due to gravity at [[sea level]]. It is about  < math > 9.8m/s^2 < /math > . 
 
 This formula says that when you know the mass of an object, then you can calculate how much force there is on the object because of gravity. 
 You must be on earth to use this formula. If you are on the moon or another planet, then you can use the formula but ''g'' will be different. 
 
 Force is a [[vector]], so it can be stronger or weaker and it can also point in different [[direction|directions]].  
 [[Gravity]] always points down into the ground (if you are not in space). 
 
 == Gravitational force == 
 
 Another equation that says something about gravity is: 
 
 : < math > {F}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{d^2} < /math > 
 
 < math > F < /math >  is force;  < math > G < /math >  is the [[gravitational constant]], which is used to show how gravity accelerates an object;  < math > m_{1} < /math >  is the mass of one object;  < math > m_{2} < /math >  is the mass of the second object; and  < math > d < /math >  is the distance between the objects. 
 
 This equation is used to calculate how the earth moves around the sun and how the moon moves around the earth. It is also used to calculate how other planets, stars and objects in space move around. 
 
 The equation says that if two objects are very heavy then there is a strong force between them because of gravity. 
 If they are very far apart then the force is weaker. 
 
 == The four forces of the Universe == 
 Objects and particles in the [[Universe]] interact. How the particles and object interact is governed by four forces of nature. They are: 
 *[[Gravity]] 
 *[[Electromagnetism]] 
 *[[Strong force]] 
 *[[Weak force]] 
 
 The [[Fermilab]] in the U.S. is a particle accelerator. They are investigating results which suggest a possible fifth force of nature. < ref > BBC News: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66407099] Scientists at Fermi Lab close in on fifth force of nature. < /ref >
