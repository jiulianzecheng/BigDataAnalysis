 '''Humorism''', or '''humoralism''', was a system of [[medicine]] about the makeup and workings of the [[human body]]. It was a belief that too much or too little of any of four distinct body [[fluid]]s in a person directly influenced their [[temperament]] and [[health]]. The humoralist system of medicine is highly [[wikt:individualistic|individualistic]]. Each individual [[patient]] was made up of their own unique [[wikt:combination|combination]] of humors. < ref name= " Bynum281 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26304287|title=Companion encyclopedia of the history of medicine|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-04771-4|location=London|oclc=26304287}} < /ref > 
 
 It resembled an early [[holistic]] approach to medicine linking [[mental]] and [[wikt:physical|physical]] [[process]]es. < ref name=Bynum281/ >  From [[Hippocrates]] onward, the humoral [[theory]] was adopted by [[Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Republic|Roman]] and [[Avicenna|Persian physicians]]. It became the most commonly held view of the [[human body]] among early [[physician]]s until the coming of modern [[medical]] [[research]] in the [[nineteenth century]]. It has not been used in medicine since then. < ref name= " NYT " > NY Times Book Review [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/books/review/Nuland.html?ex=1341547200 & en=28b87289415e5d35 & ei=5088 Bad Medicine] < /ref > < ref name =  " Webster " > {{cite book| author = WebMD| title = Webster's New World Medical Dictionary, 3rd Edition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t8UfI3BH78wC| year = 2009| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn = 978-0-544-18897-6| page = 204 }} < /ref >
