'''Infanticide''' (or infant homicide) is the [[murder|intentional killing]] of infants. Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrators of [[neonaticide]] and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general. Basically, in earlier ages, women and girls were not considered equal to men. People started killing their daughters when they were born. In the Indian subcontinent pre-natal sex is banned as some people kill their daughters or get an [[abortion]] done because of the want of male children.
