 In [[geometry]], '''bisection''' is the [[Division (mathematics)|division]] of something into two [[Congruent polygons|equal]] parts. This is usually done by a [[Line (geometry)|line]], which we will call the  " bisector " . The most known types are the ''segment bisector'' (a line that passes through the middle of a given [[Line segment|segment]]) and the ''angle bisector'' (a line that passes through the [[Apex (Geometry)|apex]] of an [[angle]], that divides it into two equal angles.  
 
 In [[three-dimensional space]], bisection is usually done by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], which is also called the bisector or bisecting plane.
