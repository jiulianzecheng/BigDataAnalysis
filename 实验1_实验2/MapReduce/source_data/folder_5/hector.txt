 '''Hector''' ({{lang-el|Ἕκτωρ}}, ''Hektōr'') was a [[Trojan]] prince and one of the central figures of the ''[[Iliad]]''. The first-born son of King [[Priam]] and Queen [[Hecuba]], Hector was the [[heir apparent]] to the throne and the greatest of Troy's warriors in the defense of the city. Hector fought against a various number of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] through the course of the [[Trojan War]], including [[Protesilaus]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]. He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had a son, [[Astyanax]], whom the Trojans called Scamandrios.  
 
 Hector is eventually killed by [[Achilles]] (Book XXII of ''The Iliad'').
