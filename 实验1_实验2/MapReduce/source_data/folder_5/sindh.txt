 '''Sindh''' ({{lang-sd|سنڌ}}) ({{lang-ur|صوبہ سندھ}}) is a province in [[Pakistan]]. The provincial capital of Sindh is [[Karachi]]. Sindh has a population of 47.9 million people and an area of 54,407 [[square mile|mi²]] or (140,914 [[square kilometre|km²]]); in terms of area the provincial region of Sindh is greater in area than [[Greece]] but smaller than [[Tajikistan]]. There is a southern boundary with the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].  This is in dispute see: [[Kori Creek]] 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The province of Sindh and the people inhabiting the region are named after the river known as the [[Sindhu|Sindhu River]] before [[Pakistan Movement|Independence]] and now called the [[Indus River]]. In [[Sanskrit]], ''síndhu'' means  " river, stream " , and refers to the Indus river in particular. The [[Greeks]] who conquered Sindh in 325 & nbsp;BC under the command of [[Alexander the Great]] rendered it as ''[[wikt:Ἰνδός#Ancient Greek|Indós]]'', hence the modern ''Indus''. The ancient Iranians referred to everything east of the river Indus as ''hind'' from the word ''Sindh.'' When the British arrived in the 17th century,  they followed that regional example and applied the Greek name for Sindh to the entire [[South Asia]]n region, calling it ''India''. 
 A study said, the Ancient [[Gypsy]] hail from Sindh from the [[Rohri Taluka]] in the [[Sukkur District]] < ref > [https://www.dawn.com/news/211876/hyderabad-gypsies-hail-from-sindh-claims-dr-kazi HYDERABAD: Gypsies hail from Sindh, claims Dr Kazi] < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 Sindh ({{lang-sd|سنڌ}}) is one of the provinces of Pakistan. Sindh was home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] which is 5,500 years old{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. 'Hind' is the corruption of the word for 'Sind'{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. On the 26th of June in 1947 ''Sindh'' joined '''Pakistan''' by a [[Provincial Assembly of Sindh|majority vote of members of the 1947 provincial legislature]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Sindh is located on the western corner of South-central Asia, bordering the [[Iranian plateau]] in the west. Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about 579 & nbsp;km from north to south and 442 & nbsp;km (extreme) or 281 & nbsp;km (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the Kirthar Mountains to the west, and the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. In the centre is a fertile plain around the [[Indus River]].
