 '''Umbridae''' is a family of fish in the order [[Esociformes]], which contains pike, pickerel, and mudminnows. The single living genus, ''[[Umbra (fish)|Umbra]]'', occupies weed-choked freshwater habitats in eastern North America and eastern Europe.  
 ==Studies== 
 While the family contained the genera ''Umbra'', ''[[Novumbra]]'', and ''[[Dallia]]'', recent studies have recovered this grouping as paraphyletic, with ''Novumbra'' and ''Dallia'' being moved to the family [[Esocidae]].
