 '''Celluloid''' is the name of a group of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] made from [[nitrocellulose]] and [[camphor]], plus dyes and other agents. It was the first [[thermoplastic]]. It was first called '''Parkesine''' in 1856,  then '''Xylonite''' in 1869 and then ''Celluloid'' in 1870. Celluloid is easily [[Molding (process)|molded]] and shaped.  
 
 It was first widely used as an [[ivory]] replacement, in [[billiard]] balls for example. In the early 20th century it was used in most [[photographic film]]. Celluloid catches fire very easily and also easily breaks down, and is no longer widely used. Its most common uses today are for making [[table tennis]] balls and [[guitar pick]]s. < ref > http://www.dandreapicks.com/about.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124231926/http://www.dandreapicks.com/about.htm |date=2010-01-24 }} Andrea Picks: The Saga of Cellulose < /ref >
