 In [[law]], '''damages''' are an [[wikt:award|award]], usually of [[money]]. It is to be paid to a person as [[wikt:compensation|compensation]] for loss or [[injury]]. < ref > International principle: [http://www.trans-lex.org/946000 Trans-Lex.org], Garner, p.416 < /ref >   The rules for damages can and frequently do vary based on the type of claim which is presented (e.g., breach of contract versus a tort claim) and the [[jurisdiction]].

 == Categories == 
 In [[common law countries]], damages are usually [[wikt:categorize|categorize]]d into '''compensatory''' (or '''actual''') '''damages''', and '''punitive damages'''. Compensatory damages are further categorized into special damages and general damages. Special damages include [[economic loss]]es such as loss of [[wikt:earning|earning]]s, [[property damage]] and [[medical]] [[expense]]s. General damages are noneconomic damages such as [[pain and suffering]] and [[emotional distress]]. '''Statutory damages''' are those required by [[law|statute]]. 
 
 === Compensatory damages === 
 Compensatory damages are paid to [[wikt:compensate|compensate]] the [[wikt:claimant|claimant]] for loss, [[injury]], or [[harm]] suffered as a result of another's [[negligence]] ([[Tort|tort law]]). [[Expectation damages]] are used in contract law. < ref > [[Robinson v Harman]] (1848) 1 Ex Rep 850 < /ref >  In [[civil law]] [[countries]], these are called  " ordinary damages "  and may be limited to actual loss. < ref > Lusina Ho; Rebecca Lee, ''Trust Law in Asian Civil Law Jurisdictions'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 178 < /ref > 
 
 === Punitive damages === 
 Generally, '''punitive damages''', which are also termed ''exemplary damages'' in the [[United Kingdom]], are not awarded in order to compensate the [[plaintiff]], but in order to [[reform]] or [[wikt:deter|deter]] the [[defendant]]. They are also to intended to be an [[example]] to others not to do the same thing. Punitive damages are awarded when it is determined that compensatory damages are not enough. Punitive damages are awarded over and above the amount of compensatory damages, such as in the event of [[Malice (law)|malice]] or [[intent (law)|intent]]. Great [[judge|judicial]] [[wikt:restraint|restraint]] is expected to be exercised in their use. In the [[United States]] punitive damages awards are subject to the limitations imposed by the [[due process of law]] clauses of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. 
 
 Punitive damages in most civil law countries are not awarded. < ref >  Luis Ernesto Aguirre Villarreal, ''Integration of Punitive Damages Into Countries with a Civil Law System '' (doctor's thesis, Tulane University Law School, 2008), p. 265 < /ref >   
 
 === Statutory damages === 
 Statutory damages are an amount stated within the statute rather than [[wikt:calculate|calculate]]d based on the degree of harm to the plaintiff. [[Legislation|Lawmakers]] will provide for statutory damages for acts in which it is difficult to determine the value of the harm to the victim. Someone breaking the law can [[wikt:entitle|entitle]] the victim to a statutory award. This is even if no actual injury happened.  
 
 For example, United States [[Civil Code]] [[Title 18 of the United States Code|18 USC §§2520]] provides for statutory damages to victims of various [[wiretapping]] [[wikt:offense|offense]]s. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=statutory%20damages & url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002520----000-.html | title = TITLE 18  >  PART I  >  CHAPTER 119  >  § 2520 | access-date = 7 March 2011 | publisher = Cornell University Law School}} < /ref >
