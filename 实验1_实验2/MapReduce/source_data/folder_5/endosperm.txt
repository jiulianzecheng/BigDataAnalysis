 '''Endosperm''' is a food reserve [[tissue]] inside the [[seed]]s of most [[flowering plant]]s. It surrounds the [[embryo]] and provides nutrition in the form of [[starch]]. It may also have [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s and [[protein]]. 
 
 The endosperm of [[cereal]] plants can be a source of energy for humans. [[Wheat]] endosperm is ground into [[flour]] for [[bread]]. With whole wheat bread the [[bran]] (cover of seed) and the [[Cereal germ|germ]] is also in the flour. [[Barley]] endosperm is the main source for [[beer]] production. Other examples of edible endosperms are [[coconut]] 'meat' and coconut 'water', < ref > {{cite web |url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph10.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902214354/http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph10.htm |archive-date=2 September 2017 |title=Edible Palm Fruits |last=Armstrong |first=W.

 ==Origin of endosperm== 
 Primitive ([[basal]]) flowering plants have seeds with small [[embryo]]s and big endosperms. The [[evolution]]ary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with seeds with little or no endosperm. In more [[derived]] flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is not developed or consumed before the seed matures. In these plants, the [[cotyledon]]s contain the food reserve. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.seedbiology.de/dormancy.asp#evolution|title=The Seed Biology Place - Seed Dormancy|website=www.seedbiology.de}} < /ref > < ref name=Friedman1998 > {{citation | author = Friedman, William E. | year = 1998 | title = The evolution of double fertilization and endosperm: an historical perspective | journal = Sexual Plant Reproduction | volume = 11 | pages = 6â€“16 | doi = 10.1007/s004970050114| s2cid = 19785565 }} < /ref > < ref > Stebbins, G.

 ===Double fertilization=== 
 Endosperm is formed when the two [[sperm|sperm nuclei]] inside a [[pollen]] grain reach the inside of an ovule or [[ovule|embryo sac]]. One sperm nucleus fertilizes the [[ovum|egg]], forming a [[zygote]], while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the two polar nuclei at the center of the embryo sac. This makes the first endosperm cell, which develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm is an organism distinct from the embryo (though placed next to it in the seed). 
 
 About 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are [[polyploid]]. < ref name=Olsen2007 > {{cite book|last=Olsen |first=Odd-Arne |year=2007 |title=Endosperm: Developmental and Molecular Biology |url=https://archive.org/details/endospermdevelop08olse |isbn=978-3-540-71234-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/endospermdevelop08olse/page/n10 2] |publisher=Springer}} < /ref >  These are typically [[triploid]] (containing three sets of chromosomes) but can vary widely from [[diploid]] (2n) to 15n. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/|title=Genome Biology|website=Genome Biology}} < /ref >
