 A '''flatbread''' is a [[bread]] made with [[flour]], [[water]], and [[salt]].  The flatbread is then rolled into a flattened [[dough]]. Many flatbreads are made without [[yeast]]: they are [[unleavened bread]].  Some have a very little yeast, such as [[pita]] and [[naan]]. It is also a type that [[pizza]] crusts use. 
 
 There are many other ingredients that flatbreads may have.  Curry powder, diced [[jalape√±o]]s, chili powder, black pepper, [[olive oil]], [[sesame oil]], etc. may be added.  Flatbreads can range from one [[millimeter]] to a few [[centimeter]]s thick.
