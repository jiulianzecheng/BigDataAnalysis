 '''Dadaism''' is an [[avant-garde]] [[intellectual]] movement. It started around [[World War I|World War 1]]. Although not at first an [[art movement]], < ref name=Hughes/ > < sup > p60/61 < /sup >  it did influence art greatly for a time.  
 
 == History == 
 The movement, formed in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], was heavily influenced by the war in Europe. < ref name=Hughes > Hughs, Robert 1991. ''The shock of the new: art and the century of change''. London: Thames  &  Hudson, p60{{ndash}}80. < /ref > < ref > Wilson S.  &  Lack J. 2008. ''The Tate guide to modern art terms'', p60. Tate Publishing. < /ref >  Its artists rejected modern [[capitalism|capitalist society]]. They used [[nonsense]] and [[protest]] in their works. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, [[war]], and [[nationalism]], and were close to the radical [[far-left]]. The whole point behind Dadaism was to prove that anything could be art if the artist declared it to be. This was to prove that if everything could be art, then nothing could be art. This outraged many artists as Dadaism deemed their labour intensive artworks meaningless.  
 
 The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture. < ref > Trachtman, Paul. A brief history of Dada. ''Smithsonian Magazine.'' [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/dada-115169154/] < /ref > 
 
 == Influence == 
 Its peak was 1916 to 1922, and it influenced [[surrealism]], [[pop art]], and [[punk rock]]. It went  against the standards of society. 
 Followers of Dadaism included [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Salvador Dali]]. A later version, called ''Neo-Dada'', arose in the 1960s. 
 
 Dadaism began in central Europe, in [[Berlin]] and [[Zurich]]. Dadaism moved to Paris with [[Tristan Tzara]]. Tzara would go on to 'lead' the dadaists of Paris such as as [[Man Ray]], [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[Marcel Duchamp]].   
 
 Dadaism is also closely associated with the concepts of the grotesque, the absurd, and the macabre. The idea of ridiculing the absurdity of existence has its expression in the dramatic art of [[Samuel Beckett]] and the so called [[school of Paris]], which included [[Arthur Adamov]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Eugene O'Neill]]. 
 
 The word  " Dada "  may be an allusion to an infant's first words, such as  " Mama " . No-one knows who invented the name, but there is some historical evidence which says that Tzara picked it out at random from a German-French dictionary, since  " Dada "  means  " hobbyhorse "  in French. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-01-11|title=Who Is Dada {{!}} What Is Dada|url=https://whohadada.com/|access-date=2021-06-03|website=whohadada.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  A hobbyhorse is a long stick with a toy horse head attached which a child can hold in front of them to pretend they are riding a horse. Still, the source of the name is not widely agreed upon.
