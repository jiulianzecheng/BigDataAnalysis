 '''Stonemasonry''' is the [[craft]] of making things out of [[stone]]. People who do this are called stonemasons. Their crafts have existed since the start of [[civilization]]. They have made important [[building]]s and [[structure]]s out of stone. This stone comes from the [[earth]]. Stone has been used to build many long-lasting things. These could be [[monument]]s, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[cathedral]]s and [[cities]]. These can often be seen in many [[culture]]s. Some monuments made out of stone include, the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Parthenon]]. [[Stonehenge]] is also a famous [[stone]] [[building]].
