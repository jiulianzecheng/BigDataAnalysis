 ==Description== 
 The nature of the archedictyon is an important in the [[taxonomy|taxonomic classification]] of the large, primitive [[Palaeozoic]] insects known as [[Palaeodictyoptera]]. It was used for this purpose as early as 1854. < ref > [http://psyche.entclub.org/77/77-001.html] Jarmila Kukalová.  " Revisional study of the Order Palaeodictyoptera in the [[Upper Carboniferous]] [[shale]]s of [[Commentry]], France "  Part III. ''Psyche'' '''77''':1-44, 1970. < /ref >  A [[National Museum of Natural History]] [[database]] for the study of [[ant]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s and [[termite]]s describes the archedictyon as: 
 < blockquote > ...the primitive original vein network [of] the wings of many of the most ancient insect fossils; the complex network of irregular veinlets between the veins in the outer [three-quarters] of both wings, including the anal lobe. < ref > [http://antbase.org/databases/glossary_files/glossary_A.htm] Museum of Natural History < /ref > < /blockquote > 
 
 According to a 1999 paper on the evolution of flght in [[Palaeoptera]] the cross veins of some Palaeodictyoptera may be an [[adaptive]] feature. < ref > [http://www.famu.org/mayfly/pubs/pub_w/pubwoottonr2000p129.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215055804/http://www.famu.org/mayfly/pubs/pub_w/pubwoottonr2000p129.pdf |date=2012-02-15 }} Cambridge Philosophical Society: Flight adaptations in Palaeozoic Palaeoptera (Insecta) < /ref >

 The archedictyon is believed to have contained between six and eight longitudinal [[veins]], but current understanding of the design is based on a combination of [[fossil]] [[data]] and speculation. < ref > [http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/645] Archedictyon < /ref > 
 
 The  " Comstock-Needham system "  designed by two [[entomology|entomologists]] describes these veins and their branches: < ref name= " cals.ncsu.edu " / > 
 
 :*Costa (C): the leading edge of the wing 
 :*Subcosta (Sc): the second longitudinal vein (behind the costa), typically unbranched 
 :*Radius (R): the third longitudinal vein, one to five branches reach the wing margin 
 :*Media (M): the fourth longitudinal vein, one to four branches reach the wing margin 
 :*Cubitus (Cu): fifth longitudinal vein, one to three branches reach the wing margin 
 :*Anal veins (A1, A2, A3): the unbranched veins behind the cubitus. < ref name= " cals.ncsu.edu " > [http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/external_anatomy/wings.html] North Carolina State University < /ref > 
 
 Crossveins are named based on their relative position to the more prominent longitudinal veins: 
 
 :*C-SC crossveins run between the costa and subcosta 
 :*R crossveins run between adjacent branches of the radius 
 :*R-M crossveins run between the radius and media 
 :*M-CU crossveins run between the media and cubitus. < ref name= " cals.ncsu.edu " / > 
 
 == Living species == 
 In [[Extant taxon|extant]] insects, the term implies a retention of primitive characteristics but ''not necessarily a simplicity of form''.  Modern insects with wings to which the term ''archedictyon'' has been applied include the termite ''[[Mastotermes darwiniensis]]'' from [[Australia]] and the [[praying mantis]] ''[[Orthodera novaezealandiae]]''. < ref > [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Orthodera_novaezealandiae.html] Purkayastha, M. 1999, ''Orthodera novaezealandiae'', [[University of Michigan]] Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 27, 2008 < /ref >  from [[New Zealand]]. 
 
 The term is also used in the discussion of [[phasmid]]s. Then it refers to a network of non-directional veins in the costal region of the wing or in the [[elytron]]. < ref > [http://phasmid-study-group.org/glossary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017135755/http://phasmid-study-group.org/glossary |date=2013-10-17 }} Glossary of terms used to describe phasmids < /ref >
