 ==Television== 
 Many television programs are either anthologies' or a combination of an anthology and a series. While this type of anthology normally has the same group of characters and setting, each [[Episodes (TV series)|episode]] is a separate story. With this type of program, the viewer does not need to watch every episode to understand each one. Some programs use both serial programming, where each episode it part of a bigger story, and anthology episodes. These episodes are not directly part of the larger story but normally use the same characters and setting. These  " semi-anthology "  programs let the writers tell about other parts of the [[fictional universe|world]] they have created. < ref name=:60s > {{cite web |title=Series drama and the  " semi-anthology " : Sixties television in transition - ProQuest |url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/3abc237b466375b9787d85ab6b911ef6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar & cbl=18750 & diss=y |website=www.proquest.com |accessdate=10 April 2022 }} < /ref >  This type of anthology was first seen in the mid to late 1960s and is still being used over half a century later. < ref name= " :60s "  / >
