{{Infobox ununennium}}'''''Ununennium''''', or '''element 119''', is a predicted [[chemical element]]. Its symbol is '''Uue'''. Ununennium and Uue are substitute names made by the [[IUPAC]], (meaning  " one-one-nine-ium "  in Latin) until permanent names are made. Ununennium is the element with the smallest atomic number that has not been created yet. Qualities of Ununennium are unknown, but many are predicted. It is predicted all [[isotope]]s will be [[radioactive]]. It is thought to be an [[alkali metal]]. < ref name= " eb " > {{cite web|title=Transuranium element|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/transuranium-element/Extension-of-the-periodic-table#ref622195|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=19 September 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 Many attempts have been made by American, German, and Russian teams to make ununennium but all have failed. Japanese and Russian failed to produce the element after work in both 2019 and 2020. 
 
 == Predicted chemistry == 
 Ununennium's spot on the periodic table is a sign that it may be similar to lighter elements such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], and [[francium]]; however, some of its properties may be different from what is expected. For example, ununennium might be less reactive than caesium and francium and will behave more like potassium or rubidium. 
 
 == Uses == 
 As of 2023, it has yet to be created and therefore has no use.
