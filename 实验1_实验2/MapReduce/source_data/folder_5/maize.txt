 '''Maize''' or Indian corn < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=corn|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition|quote=Later, in the 17th century, another term for maize appears, Indian cornâ€”the word Indian here meaning  " native to the Americas. "  The American word corn in the specific meaning  " maize "  is simply a shortening of Indian corn.}} < /ref >  (called '''corn''' in some countries) is ''Zea mays'', a member of the [[grass]] [[family (biology)|family]] ''Poaceae''. It is a [[cereal]] [[grain]] which was first grown by people in ancient [[Central America]]. Approximately 1 billion tonnes are harvested every year. However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans. Most is used to make corn [[ethanol]], animal feed and other maize products, such as [[corn starch]] and [[corn syrup]]. 
 
 Maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an [[angiosperm]], which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is has long been a [[staple food]] by many people in [[Mexico]], Central and [[South America]] and parts of [[Africa]]. In [[Europe]] and the rest of [[North America]], maize is grown mostly for use as [[animal]] feed. In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], maize is commonly referred to as  " corn " .   
 
 Centuries of [[plant breeding|cross breeding]] have produced larger plants, and specialized varieties. Corn has become an important ingredient in American foods through the use of [[corn starch]]. People have long eaten [[sweet corn]] and [[popcorn]] with little [[Food processing|processing]], and other kinds after processing into [[flour]] for making [[cornbread]], [[tortilla]]s, and other artificial foods. 
 
 Maize has been a fruitful [[model organism]] for research in [[genetics]] for many years: see [[Barbara McClintock]]. Research has shown that [[artificial selection]] developed maize from a Mexican plant called [[Teosinte]]. < ref > Doebley J. 2004. The genetics of maize evolution.

 == The genus ''Zea'' == 
 There are five [[species]] and many [[subspecies]] in the [[genus]]. They are all plants similar to the cultivated maize, with less developed cobs. The wild ones are sometimes called [[teosinte]]s, and they are all native to [[Mesoamerica]].
