 '''Boules''' is the name for a number of similar hand-[[Game|games]], which are played with heavy [[Ball|balls]]. In most cases, the aim of the game is to throw a ball, and to get it as close as possible to an object ball (small ball). Variants of these games include pétanque, which is popular in [[France]], [[boccia]] from [[Italy]], and [[bowls]] from [[Great Britain]]. 
 
 Today, these games are played with balls made of [[metal]], which weight between {{Convert|800|g}} and {{Convert|1500|g}}. 
 
 ==History== 
 Such games have a long history. In the [[5th century BC]], Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] of Kos recommended the game. It used stone balls at the time. [[Julius Pollux]], a Greek scholar who lived in the 2nd century, described a game where bowls were thrown at a [[brick]]. [[Boule Lyonnaise]], and [[boccia]] (soft pétanque) go back to this game.  
 
 During the [[Middle Ages]], the game was forbidden at various times. In the 17th century, some people wanted to promote games such as [[battledore]] and [[shuttlecock]], and argued against boules which, at the time, was more popular.
