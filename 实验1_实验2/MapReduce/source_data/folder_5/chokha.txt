 There are Four types of Chokha worn among the Georgians: 
 *Kartl-Kakheti chokha (Kartli and Kakheti are eastern Georgian provinces) 
 *Khevsur Chokha (mainly in Mtskheta-mtianeti province of Georgia) 
 *Adjarian chokha (mainly found in western Georgia provinces such as Adjara and Guria and also used to be used in Lazona that is now part of republic of Turkey) 
 *General Caucasian chokha which is like a Kartl-Kakheti chokha but is little longer 
 
 In Georgia, the Black chokha was reserved to the  " Order of Chokhosani " . They represent the elite society of the citizens. These were people with special dedications such as: Great generals, heroes or some of the famous poets and the people who had done some big service to the country. Not even all of Lords were allowed in  " Chokhosani Orden "  and those who did proudly represented this rank in their clothing. 
 
 Chokha is sewn of thick fabric and is tight on the waist and wide on the bottom. In some parts of the Caucasus there are also female chokhas. 
 
 Generally, the chokha outfit includes a [[khanjali]] (the sword), the akhalukhi also know as the [[arkhalig]] (a shirt worn underneath the chokha), the [[gazyr]]s (the bullets), and the [[bashlyk]] (a hood, separate from the robe) or  [[papakha]] (a tall fur hat).
