 '''Suede''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|w|eÉª|d}} {{respell|SWAYD}}) is a kind of [[leather]] with a soft and fuzzy finish. It is often used for making jackets, shoes, fabrics, bags, furniture, and more. The word  " suede "  originally comes from [[French language|French]] and means  " gloves from Sweden.

 Suede leather is crafted from the underside of animal skin, which is smoother and more flexible than the top layer. However, it's not as tough or long-lasting. This material is great for making things feel soft and comfortable. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://explainry.com/difference-between/leather-suede/|title=Difference Between Leather and Suede - Explainry|newspaper=Explainry|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823203757/https://explainry.com/difference-between/leather-suede/ |access-date=2017-02-11|archive-date=2017-08-23 |language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Production == 
 Suede leather is created from the softer underside of animal skin. It's mainly made from lamb skin, although goat, calf, and deerskin are also used. Sometimes, even thick cow and deer hides are turned into suede, but they end up having a more rugged, shaggy texture because of the fibers in them. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Scrivano|first=Sandy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZXZ6f2KNLwC & dq=Suede+leather+is+made+from+the+underside+of+the+skin & pg=PA120|title=Sewing with Leather and Suede: Tips, Techniques and Inspiration|date=2001|publisher=Lark Books|isbn=978-1-57990-273-5|pages=120|language=en}} < /ref >
