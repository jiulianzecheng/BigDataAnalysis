 The '''Yard''' (abbreviation '''yd''', plural sometimes '''yds''')  is a unit of [[length]] in the [[Imperial unit|Imperial System]] and [[United States customary units|United States Customary Units]]. 
 
 The word  " yard "  comes from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] word for a straight rod. 
 
 == History == 
 
 A yard has always been 3 feet, although the length of a foot has changed frequently throughout history. In 1959, the International Yard and Pound Agreement was signed between the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[the United States]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. It was defined as 0.9144 metres. The United States continued to use the old yard under the name 'Survey Yard'
