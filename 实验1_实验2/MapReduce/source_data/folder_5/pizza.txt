 '''Pizza''' is an Italian [[food]] that was created in [[Italy]] (The [[Naples]] area). It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are [[cheese]], [[sausages]], [[pepperoni]], [[vegetable]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[spice]]s and [[herb]]s and [[basil]]. These toppings are added over a piece of [[bread]] covered with [[sauce]]. The sauce is most often [[tomato]]-based, but [[butter]]-based sauces are used, too. The piece of bread is usually called a  " pizza crust " . Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. Pizza comes from [[Italy]] from [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[cuisine]]. However, it has become popular in many parts of the world. < ref name= " Miller " > [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml Hanna Miller] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712030514/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/2/2006_2_30.shtml |date=2009-07-12 }}  " American Pie, "  ''American Heritage'', April/May 2006. < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The origin of the word ''Pizza'' is uncertain. The food was invented in [[Naples]] about 200 years ago. It is the name for a special type of [[flatbread]], made with special [[dough]]. < ref > [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 3rd edition, 2009 ''s.v.'' 'pita' < /ref >  The pizza enjoyed a second birth as it was taken to the United States in the late 19th century. 
 
 Flatbreads, like the [[focaccia]] from [[Liguria]], have been known for a very long time. Pizzas need to be baked at temperatures of 200{{ndash}}250 & nbsp;°C. Hardly any household oven could reach such temperatures at the time. Because of this, the pizza was made at home, and then given to the town [[bakery]] to bake. In June 1889, the Neapolitan chef Raffaele Esposito created the  " Margherita "  in honour of [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], and was the first pizza to include cheese.  < ref > {{Cite web|last=Cohane|first=Ondine|title=How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master|access-date=2020-08-22|website=www.bbc.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century; < ref > {{cite book|last1=Helstosky|first1=Carol|title=Pizza: A Global History|url=https://archive.org/details/pizzaglobalhisto00hels|date=2008|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-630-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/pizzaglobalhisto00hels/page/n49 48]}} < /ref >  and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated.

 == Types == 
 In the 20th century, pizza has become an international food. The toppings may be quite different depending on the local tastes. These pizzas consist of the same basic design. They also include many types of ingredients such as [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[egg (food)|egg]], [[pineapple]], [[banana]], [[coconut]], [[sauerkraut]], [[eggplant]], [[kimchi]], [[lamb]], [[couscous]], [[chicken]], [[fish]], and [[shellfish]]. Sometimes, meats prepared in styles such as [[Greece|Greek]] [[lamb]], [[Gyros (food)|Gyros]] or [[chicken tikka masala]], and non-traditional spices such as [[curry]] and Thai sweet chili are added too. Pizzas can also be made without meat for [[vegetarian]]s, and without cheese, for [[vegan]]s. 
 
 == Styles == 
 [[File:European Margaretha pizza.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Authentic Neapolitan Pizza Margherita, the base for most kinds of pizza.]] 
 [[File:Giordano's Deep Dish Pizza.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Chicago]]'s famous [[deep dish pizza]]]] 
 '''[[Neapolitan pizza]] (''pizza Napoletana'')'''. Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are made with local ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, made with the milk from [[water buffalo]] raised in the marshlands of [[Campania]] and [[Lazio]] in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected by its own European law).  
 
 The genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of Italian [[flour]], natural Neapolitan [[yeast]] or brewer's yeast, salt and water.The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other mechanical [[tool|device]], and may be no more than 3 [[millimeter|mm]] (1/8 [[inch|in]]) thick.  
 
 Pizza is cooked in an [[oven]]. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. Neapolitan pizza has gained the status of  " guaranteed traditional specialty "  in Italy. This admits only three official variants: '''[[Pizza marinara]]''', which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil (although most Neapolitan pizzerias also add basil to the marinara), '''Pizza Margherita''', made with tomato,mozzarella, [[basil]] and extra virgin olive oil, and '''Pizza Margherita DOC''' made with [[tomato]], buffalo mozzarella from [[Campania]] in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil. 
 
 '''Lazio style''': Pizza in [[Lazio]] ([[Rome]]), as well as in many other parts of [[Italy]] is available in 2 different  " flavors " : 1) In take-away shops so-called  " Pizza Rustica "  or  " Pizza a Taglio " . Pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2 & nbsp;cm). The crust similar to that of an [[English muffin]] and mostly cooked in an electric oven. When purchased, it is usually cut with scissors or knife and priced by weight. 2) In Pizza Restaurants (Pizzerias) it is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. 
 
 Other types of Lazio-style pizza include: 
 
 * '''Pizza Romana''' (in [[Naples]]): tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, oregano, oil; 
 * '''Pizza Viennese''': tomato, mozzarella, German [[sausage]], [[oregano]], oil; 
 * '''Pizza Capricciosa''' ( " Capricious Pizza " ): mozzarella, tomato, mushrooms, artichokes, cooked ham, olives, and oil. 
 * '''Pizza Quattro Stagioni''' ( " Four Seasons Pizza " ): same ingredients for the Capricciosa, but ingredients are not mixed; 
 * '''Pizza Quattro Formaggi''' ( " Four Cheese Pizza " ): tomatoes, mozzarella, stracchino, fontina, gorgonzola. 
 
 '''Sicilian-style pizza''' has its toppings baked directly into the crust.  
 
 '''White pizza''' (''pizza bianca'') uses no tomato sauce, often substituting [[pesto]] or [[dairy]] products such as sour cream. Most commonly, especially on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of the [[United States]], the toppings consist only of [[mozzarella]] and [[ricotta]] cheese drizzled with [[olive oil]] and [[basil]] and [[garlic]]. In Rome, the term ''pizza bianca'' refers to a type of bread topped only with olive oil. Some white pizzas use [[Fettuccine Alfredo|Alfredo sauce]] as the pizza sauce for a better flavor. 
 
 == Pizza al taglio == 
 [[File:Pizza al taglio.jpg|thumb|Pizza al Taglio, in a shop in [[Rome]]. ]] 
 Pizza al taglio or pizza al trancio was invented in Rome. It is usually rectangular, and sold by weight. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Parla|first=Katie|date=2011-04-01|title=The Art of Roman Pizza: Learning From Italy's Famous Baker|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/04/the-art-of-roman-pizza-learning-from-italys-famous-baker/73277/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}} < /ref >  The name translates to pizza by the slice. Stands selling pizza al taglio are common in Italy. It is also common in other areas of the world where there are many Italian immigrants.

 [[File:Tk pizza.jpg|thumb|Unpacked frozen pizza.]] 
 Frozen pizza is pizza that has been prepared beforehand, and is then deep-frozen, to be distributed in [[supermarket]]s. It is among the most successful and popular types of [[convenience food]]. It is prepared slightly differently: First the [[dough]] with the tomato sauce is pre-cooked, then the toppings are added. The dough of frozen pizza is different. Its dough also contains [[modified starch]] and [[Leavening agent|leavening agents]]. This makes it possible to cook the pizza directly, without first defrosting it. One main frozen pizza brand is Digiorno.
