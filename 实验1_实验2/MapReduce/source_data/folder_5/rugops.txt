 '''''Rugops''''' was a [[dinosaur]] related to ''[[Carnotaurus]]''. It lived in what is now Africa, about 95 [[million]] years ago. It was a medium-sized carnivorous dinosaur, about 20 feet long as an adult (other estimates put its length at 14 to 17 feet). < ref > Grillo O.N.  &  Delcourt R. 2016.

 ''Rugops'' lived at the same time as ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'', and ''[[Deltadromeus]]'', in the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. 
 
 ''Rugops'' was a [[carnivore]], with weak jaws and small teeth.  It may have been a scavenger, feeding on dead animals.  It also may have preyed on sauropods, such as ''[[Paralititan]]'' and ''[[Aegyptosaurus]]'', and ornithopods, such as ''[[Ouranosaurus]]''.  The name  " Rugops "  means  " wrinkled face " .  The bony wrinkles on its snout may have helped to support a structure, such as horny crest or a wattle, like on a [[rooster]] or a [[turkey]]. < ref > Sereno, Paul C.; Wilson, Jeffrey A.; Conrad, Jack L. 2004.
