 PwC was formed in 1998 when two accounting firms, Coopers  &  Lybrand and Price Waterhouse, joined together. Both of these firms started in the 1800s. In 2010, the company changed its name to PwC. 
 
 There is a main office for PwC in [[London]], [[England]]. This office helps all the PwC firms around the world work together. It makes sure they follow the same rules and plans, but it doesn't work with clients directly.
