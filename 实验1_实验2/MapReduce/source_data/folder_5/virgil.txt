 == Life == 
 Tradition is that Virgil was born in the [[village]] of Andes, near [[Mantua]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. < ref > The [[epitaph]] on his tomb in Posilipo near [[Naples]] was ''Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces'' ( " Mantua gave birth to me, the Calabrians took me, now Naples holds me; I sang of pastures [the Eclogues], country [the Georgics] and leaders [the Aeneid] " ). < /ref > < ref > [http://www.gottwein.de/latine/map/it_cis01.jpg Map of Cisalpine Gaul] < /ref >  Scholars looking at the way he used words think that he may have [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], [[Umbria]]n or even a [[Celt]]ic background. Study of his name has led to beliefs that his family may have been earlier [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlers. These modern beliefs are not supported by evidence from his own writings or from writers of his [[biography|biographies]]. Some scholars have noted that his nickname, ''MARO'', is an [[anagram]] of the two main themes in the Aeneid: ''AMOR'' (love) and ''ROMA'' (Rome).
