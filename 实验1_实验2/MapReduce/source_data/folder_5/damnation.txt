In [[Christianity|Western Christian]] belief, '''damnation''' to [[hell]] is the punishment of [[God]] for persons who were [[sin]]ners. 
 
 In Eastern Christian traditions ([[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), as well as some Western traditions, it is seen as a state of separation from God, a state into which all humans are born but against which [[Christ]] is the  " Mediator "  and  " Great Physician " .
