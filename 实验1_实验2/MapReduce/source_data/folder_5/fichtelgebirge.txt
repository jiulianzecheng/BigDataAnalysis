 The '''Fichtelgebirge''' is a [[mountain range]] in northeastern [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. It extends from the valley of the [[Main|Red Main River]] to the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border, where it is continued by the much higher [[Ore Mountains]]. 
 
 The highest mountain is the '''Schneeberg''' (1051 m). Rivers rising from the Fichtelgebirge are the [[Main|White Main]] (German: Weißer Main), the [[Saale|Saxon Saale]], the [[Ohře]] (German: Eger) and the [[Fichtelnaab]] which later joins the [[Waldnaab]]. Cities on the edge of the mountains include [[Bayreuth]] and [[Hof, Germany|Hof]]. 
 
 The mountains slope gradually away to the north and the south, but there is a steep slope to the west, where the Red Main forms the boundary of the mountains. 
 
 The Fichtelgebirge attracts many tourists both during summer and winter, mainly for [[hiking]] and [[skiing]], but also to see the large rock formations.
