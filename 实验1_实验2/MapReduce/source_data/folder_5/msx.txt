 '''MSX''' was the name of a [[home computer]] in the 1980s. It was [[Microsoft]]'s attempt to create a standard for hardware makers, conceived by [[Microsoft Japan]] executive [[Kazuhiko Nishi]]. Even with Microsoft's involvement, MSX machines were rare in the United States and Britain, but they were popular in other markets. Eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold worldwide.
