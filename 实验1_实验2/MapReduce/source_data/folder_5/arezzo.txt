 '''Arezzo''' is an old [[city]] in central [[Italy]]. It is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of the [[Province]] of [[Arezzo (province)|Arezzo]], in the [[regions of Italy|region]] of [[Tuscany]]. Arezzo is about 80 [[kilometre|km]] (50 [[mile|mi]]) south-east of [[Florence]]. It is at an [[elevation]] of 296 [[metre|m]] above sea level. In 2001 the [[population]] was about 91,600 people. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Arezzo is placed on the [[floodplain]] of the [[Arno river|Arno]]. In the upper part of the town are the [[cathedral]] and the squares. 
 
 == History == 
 Arezzo may have been one of the twelve most important [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cities, that was also called [[Dodecapolis]].  
 Conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in 311 BC, Arretium became a military station on the [[via Cassia]], the road to expansion by republican Rome into the basin of the [[Po River|Po]]. In the 3rd to 4th century, Arezzo became an episcopal place: it is one of the few cities whose succession of bishops are known by name without interruption to the present day, in part because they were the [[feudal]] lords of the city in the [[Middle Ages]]. 
 
 Until 1384, Arezzo was an independent city-state, generally [[Ghibelline]] in tendency, thus opposing [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] Florence. In 1252 the city founded its university, the ''Studium''. Arezzo in 1384 was under  [[Florence|Florentine]] domination. During this period [[Piero della Francesca]] worked in the church of [[San Francesco di Arezzo]] producing the splendid [[frescoes]]. 
 
 In the [[18th century]] the neighbouring marshes of the [[Val di Chiana]], south of Arezzo, were drained and the region became less [[malaria]]l. At the end of the century French troops led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Arezzo, but the city soon turned into the hands of the resistance against the invaders with the movement of  " [[Viva Maria]] " : this gained the city the role of provincial capital. In 1860 Arezzo became part of the [[Regno d'Italia|Kingdom of Italy]].
