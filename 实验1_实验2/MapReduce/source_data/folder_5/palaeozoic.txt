The '''Palaeozoic''' (or '''Paleozoic''') [[era]] is the earliest of the three eras of the [[Phanerozoic]]. Its name means ''early life''. It lasted from about 541 to 252 million years ago (mya), and ended with the greatest [[extinction event]], the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. 
 
 ==Beginning== 
 The Palaeozoic began with an explosion of life forms. The [[Cambrian explosion]] marks the era with thousands of new life forms in the ancient seas. The era saw many important events, including the [[development]] of most [[invertebrate]] groups, life's conquest of land, the [[evolution]] of [[fish]], [[reptile]]s, [[synapsid]]s (the ancestors of [[mammal]]s), [[amphibian]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[plant]]s, the formation of the supercontinent of [[Pangea]], and at least two distinct [[ice age]]s. The earth rotated faster than it does today so days were shorter, and the nearer moon caused stronger tides.

 At the start of the long [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous period]] oxygen was low and carbon dioxide was high. The huge growth of trees and other plants during this time reversed these data. The carbon dioxide level dropped throughout the [[Carboniferous]], and the oxygen level rose continuously until it dropped in the Permian. < ref name=Lane > Lane N. 2002.

 Oxygen reached a peak of about 30% about 280 million years ago. < ref > Lane N. 2002. Chapter 5: The Bolsover Dragonfly: Oxygen and the rise of the Giants < /ref >  That is much higher than today's 21%. 
 
 ==Periods== 
 The six periods of the Palaeozoic are: 
 *[[Permian]] 
 *[[Carboniferous]] 
 **[[Pennsylvanian]] 
 **[[Mississippian]] 
 *[[Devonian]] 
 *[[Silurian]] 
 *[[Ordovician]] 
 *[[Cambrian]]
