 Clokey made ''Gumbasia'' while he was studying at the [[University of Southern California]] and being taught by [[Slavko Vorkapich]]. It was Clokey's first clay animation movie and it was only 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. The movie showed moving lumps of clay set to music in a copy of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''. Gumbasia was made in a style Vorkapich taught called Kinesthetic Film Principles. This style, which uses [[camera]] movements and [[stop-motion]] editing, is used in later Gumby movies. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/profile/index.jsp?essid=14526 |title=Art Clokey, article at KQED |access-date=2009-08-01 |archive-date=2009-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307131243/http://www.kqed.org/arts/profile/index.jsp?essid=14526 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  After watching ''Gumbasia'', [[movie producer]] Sam Engel decided to give Clokey money to make a 15 minute movie that became the first Gumby movie -- ''Gumby Goes to the Moon''.
