 '''Toothpaste''' is a part liquid paste, applied to the [[bristle]]s of a [[toothbrush]] in order to aid oneself with the act of toothbrushing. 
 
 This substance has several purposes, such as removing [[Bacteria|plaque]] from one's teeth, whitening one's teeth and freshening one's [[breath]]. 
 
 Several toothpaste [[wikt:brand|brand]]s specialize in caring for teeth sensitive to certain conditions (for example heat, cold) or flavours (such as sweetness). The majority of these products work by strengthening the tooth enamel, thus easing [[wikt:discomfort|discomfort]] and providing the teeth with a protective outer layer. 
 
 Traditionally, toothpaste has a [[Mentha|minty]] flavour, as this is said to allow a sense of freshness in the mouth. However, [[fruit]] and flavours have been popular in the past. Fruit toothpastes, however, are [[wikt:discourage|discouraged]] by [[dentists]] due to their [[acid]]ic and tooth-eroding properties. 
 
 == Swallowing == 
 Swallowing big amounts of toothpaste can make humans very sick and is [[poisonous]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/oral-care/kids/what-if-child-eats-fluoride-toothpaste.htm | title=What if a Child Eats Fluoride Toothpaste? | date=7 September 2011 }} < /ref >  Due to this, the [[FDA]] started making toothpaste companies to put a notice about swallowing from 1997 to [[present]].
