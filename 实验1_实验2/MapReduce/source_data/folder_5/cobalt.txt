 '''Cobalt''' ([[chemical symbol]] '''Co''') is a [[chemical element]]. It has an [[atomic number]] of 27 and an [[atomic mass]] of about 59. It is a [[metal]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=|title=How many valence electrons does Cobalt (Co) have?|url=https://guide-scientific.com/valence-electrons/how-many-valence-electrons-does-cobalt-have/|access-date=|website=|language=}} < /ref >

 Cobalt is a [[transition metal]]. It is shiny and conducts electricity. It is [[magnet]]ic. It is a hard metal. It is moderately [[chemical reaction|reactive]]. [[Iron]] is more reactive and [[copper]] is less reactive. It dissolves slowly in [[acid]]s. This reaction makes [[hydrogen]] and a [[salt]] of cobalt. Cobalt is normally in its +2 [[oxidation state]] as an [[ion]]. Some [[chemical compound]]s contain cobalt ions in its +4 oxidation state. [[Cobalt(II) chloride]] is one of the most common cobalt compounds. Many cobalt compounds are blue or pink. One of them is black. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 Cobalt comes in two [[oxidation state]]s, +2 and +3. Most soluble cobalt compounds are red. They can also be green, blue, brown, and black. 
 
 ;Cobalt(II) compounds 
 *[[Cobalt(II) chloride]], red solid, most common cobalt compound 
 *[[Cobalt(II) fluoride]], used in dentistry, red solid 
 *[[Cobalt(II) hydroxide]], red or green-blue solid 
 *[[Cobalt(II) oxide]], black solid 
 *[[Cobalt(II) sulfate]], reddish solid, used in pigments 
 
 ;Mixed oxidation state 
 *[[Cobalt(II,III) oxide]], black solid, oxidizing agent 
 
 ;Cobalt(III) compounds 
 *[[Cobalt(III) fluoride]], brown solid, strong oxidizing agent 
 *[[Cobalt(III) oxide]], black solid 
 
 ==Occurrence and preparation== 
 Cobalt is too reactive to occur as a pure element in the earth. It is found in certain [[mineral]]s. It is found with copper and [[nickel]] deposits. Normally the three metals are bonded to [[arsenic]] and [[sulfur]]. The majority of cobalt mining is in central Africa.  
 
 It is found as a byproduct (left over substance) when copper and nickel are produced. It is made by reaction with the sludge from copper and nickel processing. 
 
 ==Uses==

 Cobalt is used in some types of steel. It hardens the steel.  It is also used to make very strong tough alloys.  These alloys are known as superalloys.  Some cobalt compounds are used in the [[lithium-ion battery]].  Cobalt compounds were used as an artificial food coloring until 1971.  It was discovered that it has harmful effects.  It is used to make glass blue.  It is also used as a [[catalyst]], and in some medicines, and for '''i'''nk, pigments, dyes, and varnishes'''.''' 
 
 The human body needs small amounts of cobalt for certain [[vitamin]]s. Cobalt compounds are used to stop [[cyanide]] from poisoning the body. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 People need cobalt compounds in small amounts, but cobalt is toxic in large quantities. Sometimes cobalt compounds were added to [[beer]], and people that drank it were poisoned. It can cause skin irritation when touched.
