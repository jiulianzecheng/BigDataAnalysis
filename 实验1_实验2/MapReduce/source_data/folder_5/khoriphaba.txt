 == Description == 
 God Khoriphaba is a [[Lainingthou]]. In [[Ancient Meitei language]],  " Lai "  means [[God]] or [[Deity]] and  " Ningthou "  means [[King]] or [[Monarch|Ruler]]. However, the term  " Lainingthou "  carries many meanings. It may refer to  " king of gods " ,  " godly king "  or  " kingly god " . Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n205/mode/2up?q=Khoriphaba|title=The History Of Manipur|website=archive.org|pages=205}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n365/mode/2up?q=Khoriphaba|title=The History Of Manipur|website=archive.org|pages=365}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n396/mode/2up?q=Khoriphaba|title=The History Of Manipur|website=archive.org|pages=396}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n440/mode/2up?q=Khoriphaba|title=The History Of Manipur|website=archive.org|pages=440}} < /ref >

 == Mythology == 
 God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God [[Salailen]] (alias [[Soraren]]) and Goddess [[Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi]] at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or ''three years old''), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son ''Khoiriphaba''. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA681|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=681|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him ''Puthiba''. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA681|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=681|language=en}} < /ref >    
 
 One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, '' " Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child. " '' Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA681|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=681|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 God Khoriphaba descended from [[sky]] down to [[earth]] in search for his lost mother [[Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   
 He came to [[Moirang]] near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God [[Thangjing]] and his consort [[Koiren Leima]] came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA681|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=681|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Under the guardianship of God [[Thangjing]], Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling ({{lang-mni|Mukna Kangjei}}), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of [[Thangjing]]. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. [[Thangjing]] noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA682|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=682|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from [[Moirang]]. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named '' " Toubul " '' ({{lang-omp|Toupul}}). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named '' " Ngaikhong " ''. After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6d-IyINtk4C & dq=khoiriphaba & pg=PA682|title=Encyclopaedia Of Manipur (3 Vol.)|last=Lisam|first=Khomdan Singh|date=2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-864-2|pages=682|language=en}} < /ref >    
 
 Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess [[Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi|Tampha]] was not at the place. Due to the fear of [[Salailen]], the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his [[mare]] Ngangrubi. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=khoriphaba & pg=PT101|title=And That Is Why...

 On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=khoriphaba & pg=PT101|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L.

 God Khoriphaba reached [[Koupalu|Koubru]]'s place. God [[Koupalu|Koubru]] offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of [[Loyalakpa]]. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the [[maibi]]s in the [[Lai Haraoba]] festival. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://sevensistersmusic.com/?p=17|title=Maibi's, Kanglei Thokpa / Lai Nupi Thiba.

 " The goddess of the hills, my beloved 
 The jewel, which I am unable to part with 
 On such a day, I follow your footprints 
 I fail to find you...  
 Sweet one, have you gone to another village?  
 Or have you gone to fetch fire from your neighbour?  
 Or have you gone to wash your hair at the riverbank?  
 Or are you combing your beautiful hair in the huge house of your father?  
 Perhaps, you have gone to a kang game and seated between two village brothers as a piece of decoration, radiating...  
 Perhaps, a cloth is tied around your shoulder and slender waist and you are pounding rice.  
 My friend, I have not seen my beloved for a long time.  
 Please tell me where she is? < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqJVDwAAQBAJ & dq=khoriphaba & pg=PT11|title=A Glimpse of Manipuri Literary Works|last=Devi|first=Nunglekpam Premi|date=2018-04-14|publisher=FSP Media Publications|language=en}} < /ref > "
