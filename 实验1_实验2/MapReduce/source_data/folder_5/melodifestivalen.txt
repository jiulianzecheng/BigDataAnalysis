 '''Melodifestivalen''' (translated as the  " '''Melody Festival''' " ) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] annual music competition held to decide Sweden's song and performer at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It is organised by [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) and [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR). 
 
 == History == 
 It has been staged under various formats almost every year since Sweden first participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in [[1958]]. The first year, no TV or radio broadcasted event was held, but in [[1959]], the first public competition was held. The competition is the most popular television programme in Sweden, a title it has held since [[2000]], at times eclipsing even Eurovision itself. In [[2007]], an estimated four million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, while the semifinals averaged around 3.1 million viewers. 
 
 The winner is chosen by a number of regional juries and a national televote. Until [[2001]] the competition was normally limited to between eight and twelve songs (in 1981, only five songs), but since the introduction of semifinals in [[2002]] that number has risen to thirty-two. 
 
 The Melodifestival has produced five Eurovision-winning songs and fifteen placings in the top five for Sweden at the Contest. The event is often seen as being dominated by light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as [[Schlager]]. music—so much so that it is sometimes referred to as  " Schlagerfestivalen "  (the  " Schlager Festival " ) or  " Schlager-SM "  ( " Swedish schlager championship " ) by the Swedish media but other styles of music such as rap, reggae and glam rock have made an appearance since the competition's expansion.  
 
 The competition makes a significant impact on music charts in [[Sweden]]; twenty-three participants reached the domestic singles chart in [[2006]] and twenty-one in [[2007]]. There would have been more people taking part, but [[Agnes Carlsson]] was disqualified because she discussed her song in an interview with the Aftonblad newspaper. 
 
 == Format == 
 Created in 1958, Melodifestivalen has been the competition which all but one of the Swedish Eurovision entries had to go through. There are typically four  " heats "  of around seven entries each. From each heat, the two most voted-for entries go through to the final while the 3rd and 4th placed entries from each heat go to the  " Second Chance Round " . From this round, four more finalists are chosen.  
 
 In 2022, the second-chance round was replaced with a semi-final where the eight winners of the heats were taken down to four finalists. In 2024, the semi-final will be scrapped and a new fifth heat will be added. 
 
 == Winners == 
 There have been fifty-six winners of Melodifestivalen.
