 '''''Borealopelta''''' was a large armoured [[dinosaur]]. It was found in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and is a [[nodosaur]]id [[ankylosaur]].  
 
 The [[osteoderm]]s in its armour were in their life positions, with remains of their [[keratin]] sheaths and overlying skin. It may be the most complete ankylosaur ever found. [[Melanin]] found in its [[epidermis]] remains suggests it was [[camouflage]]d. < ref > Gabbott, Sarah 2017. Armoured tank-like dinosaur used camouflage to hide. ''BBC'' Science  &  Environment.

 The report gives its estimated length as 5.5 metres and its estimated weight as about ~1,300 pbs. < ref > The discovery and work on ''Borealopelta''. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_Jb64fwnjI] < /ref >
