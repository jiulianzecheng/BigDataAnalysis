 '''Anatomy''' is the [[research|study]] of the [[bodies]] of people and other animals. Anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body. Anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as [[Muscle|muscles]], [[Gland|glands]] and [[Bone|bones]]. A person who studies anatomy is an anatomist.  
 
 The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 [[BC]] when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[Kidney|kidneys]], [[heart]] etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the [[lymphatic system]]. 
 
 For long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden, and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming. < ref > Singer, Charles 1925.

 [[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by [[University|universities]], [[Medical school|medical schools]] and teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching and research.  < ref > {{cite journal | last1=Cortese |first1=K| last2=Frascio |first2=M

 == Body systems == 
 There are different [[organ system]] < nowiki/ > s, such as the [[cardiovascular system]], also known as the [[circulatory system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains [[muscle]]s), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s,and the brain) and the [[skeleton]] (the bones). 
 
 Anatomy, [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are similar basic medical sciences.
