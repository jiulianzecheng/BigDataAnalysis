 '''Tteokbokki''' ({{lang-ko|떡볶이}}) is a Korean traditional food which has sticks of rounded rice cake as the main ingredient. ' ''[[tteok]]'' ' is the Korean word for rice cake and 'bokki' is the Korean word for something fried. 
 
 Tteokbokki is divided into gungjung tteokbokki and general tteokbokki as one of Korean street foods. 
 
 ==Types== 
 === Gungjung tteokbokki === 
 '''Gungjung tteokbokki''' ({{lang-ko|궁중떡볶이}}) is made by frying beef and rice cake with [[soy sauce]]. It was developed in ''gungjung'' which means a Korean court. 
 
 General '''tteokbokki''' is cooked with seasoning using [[gochujang]] with starch [[syrup]] or sugar for the sweet [[taste]]. Generally gungjung tteokbokki uses beef and vegetable because it was cooked at court but general tteokbokki uses fish cake, green onions and boiled egg. 
 
 === jja-jang tteokbokki === 
 '''jja-jang tteokbokki''' ({{lang-ko|짜장떡복이}}) is a stir-fried dish with jjajang. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 In a cook book named '[[Siuijeonseo]]' which was written in late 1800s, there is a record of tteokbokki. However, tteokbokki might have existed before the late 1800s because the main ingredient is rice cake and there were rice cakes during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period. 
 Gungjung tteokbokki is different from tteokbokki because there were no red peppers in [[Joseon Dynasty]] so they made gungjung tteokbokki with vegetables and meats. Modern tteokbokki was first made by Mabokrim who has sold tteokbokki with [[gochujang]] since 1953.
