 '''Waziristan''' ([[Pashto]] and {{lang-ur|وزیرستان}}),  " land of the Wazir "  is a mountainous region of northwest [[Pakistan]], bordering [[Afghanistan]] and covering about {{convert|11585|km2|abbr=on}}. It was part of the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], which was not part of any of the country's four provinces. It is now part of the province [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].

 Though declared by the rebels as a  " state "  or  " [[emirate]] " , there are questions whether the region should have that name. Those who support that the region is a state point to the facts that the federal government has little to no power in the region and that the area is ruled mostly by tribal elders. < ref > {{cite news
