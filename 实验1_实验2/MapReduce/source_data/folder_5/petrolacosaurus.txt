 '''''Petrolacosaurus''''' was a small, {{convert|40|cm|in|adj=on}} long animal, the earliest [[diapsid]] known. It lived during the later [[Carboniferous]] period. The strata where it was found in [[Kansas]] are of  [[Pennsylvanian]] age, approximately 302 million years old. < ref > Falcon-Lang H.J; Benton M.J.  &  Stimson M. 2007.

 Its diet was probably small [[insect]]s. ''Petrolacosaurus'' had distinctive canine-like secondary-sized teeth, a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] found mainly in [[therapsids]], and later in [[mammals]]. Its fossils were found in [[Kansas]], USA. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/n319 82]|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Petrolacosaurus'' was too [[derived]] to be the ancestor of all modern forms. In fact, it was already a [[diapsid]], with two openings on each side of its skull to add attachment points for [[jaw]] muscles. Hence, it cannot have been the ancestor of any [[synapsids]], which have only one such opening. Synapsids diverged from the common [[amniote]] tree before the diapsids did. 
 
 [[BBC]] Television in ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' made the mistake of talking about it as an ancestor of both reptiles and mammals.
