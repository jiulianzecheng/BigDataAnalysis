 '''Electrostar''' is the name given to a group of similar [[electric multiple unit]] passenger trains made by [[Bombardier Transportation]], formerly [[Adtranz|ADtranz]]. Since the [[privatisation of British Rail]], it has become the most common new EMU type in [[UK|Britain]], with different variants referred to as [[British Rail Class 357|Class 357]], [[British Rail Class 375|Class 375]], [[British Rail Class 376|Class 376]], [[British Rail Class 377|Class 377]], [[British Rail Class 378|Class 378]], [[British Rail Class 379|Class 379]], [[British Rail Class 387|Class 387]]. They are most common on the high-volume commuter routes in [[South London]] and to the [[Sussex]], [[Kent]]  &  South [[Essex]] coasts.   It shares the same bodyshell and core structure as the [[Turbostar]], which is in turn the most common post-privatisation [[diesel multiple unit]] family. All of the Electrostar fleet were assembled at Bombardier’s [[Derby Carriage and Wagon Works|Derby]] works.
