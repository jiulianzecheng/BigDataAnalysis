A '''syllable''' is a unit of [[pronunciation]] uttered without interruption, < ref > ''The concise Oxford dictionary'' < /ref >  loosely, a single sound. < ref > Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge. p246 < /ref >  All [[word]]s are made from at least one syllable. 
 
 ''Monosyllables'' are words that have only one [[vowel]] sound; ''polysyllables'' have more than one. If a syllable ends with a [[consonant]], it is called a ''closed syllable''. If a syllable ends with a vowel, it is called an ''open syllable''. Patterns of syllables can be shown with C and V (C for 'consonant', V for 'vowel'). Closed syllables are often shown as ''CVC'' (such as ''got''), and open syllables as ''CV'' (such as ''go''). Some languages like [[English language|English]] have many kinds of closed syllables. Other languages, like [[Japanese language|Japanese]], have few kinds of closed syllables. Other languages still, like [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], have no closed syllables.  
 
 Notice that the consonant (C) and vowel (V) notation does NOT match the letters of English spelling in a one-to-one relationship (e.g. 'th' is one sound), but rather individual sounds. 
 
 There are many words in English that have only one syllable.  
 
 IPA has been added in slashes. 
 * He /hi/ (CV) - open 
 * The /ði/ (CV) - open 
 * Like /lɑɪk/ (CVC) - closed 
 * Run /ɹʌn/ (CVC) - closed 
 * Cat /kæt/ (CVC) - closed 
 * House /hoʊs/ (CVC) - closed 
 * It (VC) /ɪt/ - closed 
 * On (VC) /ɑn/ - closed 
 
 However, in several languages, such as English, syllables can have [[Consonant|consonant clusters]] (having multiple consonants next to each other), which easily allow for words to have much more complicated syllables, such as: 
 * Crow /cɹow/ (CCV) - open 
 * Through /θruw/ (CCV) - open 
 * Spray /spɹej/ (CCCV) - open 
 * Ports /pɔɹts/ (CVCCC) - closed 
 * Sports /spɔɹts/ (CCVCCC) - closed 
 * Trip /tɹɪp/ (CCVC) - closed 
 * Dent /dεnt/ (CVCC) - closed 
 * Plant /plænt/ (CCVCC) - closed 
 * Sprint /spɹɪnt/ (CCCVCC) - closed 
 * Splints /splɪnts/ (CCCVCCC) - closed 
 * Strengths /stɹeŋθs/ (CCCVCCC) - closed 
 * Angsts /eɪŋsts/ (VCCCC) - closed 
 There are many more words that have two or more syllables. 
 * Basket /bæs.kεt/ (2 Bas-ket; CVC-CVC) 
 * Doctor /dɔc.tɔr/ (2 Doc-tor; CVC-CVC) 
 * Happy /ha.pi/ (2 Ha-ppy; CV-CV) 
 * Friendly /frεnd.li/ (2 Friend-ly; CCVCC-CV) 
 * Greenland /grin.lænd/ (2 Green-land; CCVC-CVCC) 
 * Computer /cəm.pju.tər/ (3 Com-pu-ter; CVC-CCV-CVC) [-pu- is pronounced  " pyuu' or CCV] 
 * Merciful /mər.ci.fəl/ (3 Mer-ci-ful; CVC-CV-CVC) 
 * Pronunciation /prə.nən.ci.eɪ.ʃən/ (5 Pro-nun-ci-a-tion; CCV-CVC-CV-V-CVC) 
 
 Some languages do not use an [[alphabet]] with letters. Instead, each sign may stand for a syllable. For example: Japanese can be written using [[Kana]]. A writing system based on syllables is called a [[syllabary]]. Since words in languages like English can have many different complex syllables (well over 10,000 can be produced in English), < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/64506/is-there-a-list-of-syllables-contained-in-us-english|title=Is there a list of syllables contained in US English?|website=english.stackexchange.com|accessdate=2017-07-15}} < /ref >  writing such languages using a syllabary would be completely impractical, thus alphabets are much better suited to write languages with complex syllable structures. However, since words in Japanese can be made with just a few simple syllables (around 90), writing such languages are well suited for the type of language.
