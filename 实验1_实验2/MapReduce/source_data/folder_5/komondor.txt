 The '''Komondor''' is a [[breed]] of [[dog]].   
 The Komondors are [[cord]]-coated dogs. They come from [[Hungary]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://komondor.org/html/history.html |title=The Early History of the Komondor |author=Arthur R. Sorkin |date=1998 |website= |publisher=Arthur R. Sorkin |accessdate=17 August 2014 |archive-date=8 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108031545/http://www.komondor.org/html/history.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They are [[livestock]] [[guard dog]]s and should not be confused with [[herd]] dogs. They stay with the animals they guard as a member of their flock. Komondors need a job to do or a [[property]] to guard. 
 
 They should not be kept in [[apartment]]s. They need space, a large [[garden]] or a home in the [[rural area|countryside]]. < ref > [http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/komondors.html Honest advice about dogs -Komondor] < /ref >  They are not lap dogs but working dogs. They may think of their family as their herd to take care of. < ref name=Henley > {{cite web |url=http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/breeds/komondors.html |title=Komondors |author=Richard Heaney; Therese Heaney |date=1995 |website= |publisher= Komondor Club of America |accessdate=19 August 2014 }} < /ref >  The Komondors are {{convert|50|to|60|kg|lbs}} and must be at least {{convert|70|cm|in}}high. But they can be much bigger; this is the [[minimum]] [[height]]. They live 12–14 years; which is a long life for a big dog. < ref > [http://www.kutya-tar.hu/fajtak/Komondor Hungarian Standard with a lot of good pictures] < /ref > 
 
 == Behavior == 
 Komondors are calm, [[intelligent]] and [[independent]]. < ref name=Henley/ >  They do not always need a [[human]] to tell them what to do. This [[trait (biology)|trait]] can make them more difficult to train. They are [[loyalty|loyal]] and will often follow family members around the house. < ref name=Henley/ >  A Komondor is a large [[:en:wikt:territorial|territorial]] dog. < ref name=Henley/ >  To protect a herd or family is [[instinctive]] to this breed. Komondors can be [[aggressive]] with people they meet, if they do not learn how to be friendly and social with people and other [[pet]]s. < ref name=Siegal294.295 > Mordecai Siegal; Matthew Margolis, ''Good Dog, Bad Dog, New and Revised: Dog Training Made Easy'' (New York: Holt, 1991), pp. 294–95 < /ref >  This ability to be friendly must be taught while they are puppies. < ref name=Siegal294.295/ >  Komondors are generally quiet dogs. They do not bark without a good reason. Giving a glaring stare can be a warning to intruders to leave, or the Komondor will attack. < ref > Marilyn Singer, ''A Dog's Gotta Do What a Dog's Gotta Do: Dogs at Work'' (New York: H. Holt, 2000), p. 22 < /ref > 
 
 Komondor dogs should be trained to listen to owners and caregivers. Otherwise they will just go on doing things their own way. This is because that is what they learned to do for hundreds of [[year]]s. The Komondors were often left alone to take care of the herd. The Komondors learned to make [[decision]]s and not wait for directions to tell them what to do if a [[wolf]] or [[bear]] was coming. < ref name=Alderton156/ > 
 
 == Komondors as pets ==

 The Komondor is usually silent and sleeping during the day. But when the night comes the Komondor starts moving around. The Komondor will walk up and down all over the area he is supposed to guard. < ref name=Alderton156 > David Alderton; Helena Stedman, ''Att välja hund: hitta rätt hund för just dig'' (Göteborg (Sweden): Tukan, 2011), p. 156, {{ISBN|978-91-7401-2460}} < /ref >  The dog will take care of any [[thief]], [[burglar]] or bad people who want to make trouble. The Komondor often knows how to tell a friendly person from a burglar. The Komondor just [[knows]] and [[feeling|feel]]s if somebody will come with a bad intention.
