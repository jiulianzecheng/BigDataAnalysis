 '''Peat''', or '''turf''', is an accumulation of partially [[decay]]ed [[vegetation]]. Peat forms in [[wetland]] [[bog]]s, [[Moorland|moors]], [[mire]]s, and [[swamp]]s.  
 
 ==Formation== 
 Peat forms when plant material, usually in [[marsh]]y areas, is inhibited from [[decay]]ing fully by [[acid]]ic and [[anaerobic]] conditions. It is composed mainly of marshland vegetation: [[trees]], [[grass]]es, [[fungi]], as well as other types of organic remains, such as [[insect]]s, and animal remains. Under certain conditions, the decomposition of the latter (in the absence of [[oxygen]]) is inhibited. 
 
 Peat formed in very wet conditions accumulates faster, and is less decomposed, than that in drier places. This allows [[climatology|climatologists]] to use peat as an indicator of climatic change. The composition of peat can also be used to reconstruct ancient [[Ecology|ecologies]] by examining the types and quantities of its organic constituents. 
 
 Under the proper conditions, peat is the earliest stage in the formation of [[coal]]. The coal measures of the [[Pennsylvanian]] period were laid down in a gigantic [[tropical]] river [[Basin (geology)|basin]], and later [[squeeze]]d and heated to form the [[metamorphic rock]] we call 'coal'. 
 
 Most modern peat bogs formed in high latitudes after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last [[ice age]] some 9,000 & nbsp;years ago. They usually grow slowly, at the rate of about a millimetre per year. 
 
 The peat in the world's peatlands has been forming for 360 & nbsp;million years and contains 550 [[Gigatonne]]s of carbon. < ref > A gigatonne is 10 < sup > 9 < /sup >  [[tonne]]s. < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.imcg.net/docum/peatrenewable.pdf |title=Peat should not be treated as a renewable energy source |accessdate=2007-02-12 |author=International Mire Conservation Group |date=2007-01-03 |format=pdf |archive-date=2007-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610155639/http://www.imcg.net/docum/peatrenewable.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 Peat is harvested as an important source of [[fuel]] in certain parts of the world. By volume, there are about 4 & nbsp;trillion m³ of peat in the world covering a total of around 2% of global land area (about 3 & nbsp;million km²), containing about 8 & nbsp;billion [[terajoule]]s of energy. < ref > terajoule = 10 < sup > 12 < /sup >  [[joule]]s. < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2007_executive_summary.pdf |title=Survey of Energy Resources 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |author=World Energy Council |year=2007 |format=pdf |archive-date=2008-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214607/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2007_executive_summary.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Peat is soft and easily compressed. Under pressure, water in the peat is forced out. Upon drying, peat can be used as a [[fossil fuel|fuel]]. It has industrial importance as a fuel in some countries, such as [[Ireland]] and [[Finland]], where it is harvested on an industrial scale. In many countries, including Ireland and [[Scotland]], where trees are often scarce, peat is traditionally used for cooking and domestic heating. Stacks of drying peat dug from the bogs can still be seen in some rural areas. 
 
 Peat's insulating properties make it of use to industry. 
 
 Peat fires are used to dry malted [[barley]] for use in [[Scotch whisky]] distillation. This gives Scotch whisky its distinctive smoky flavour, often called  " peatiness " . 
 
 Although peat has many uses for humans, it also presents problems. When dry, it can be a major [[fire]] [[hazard]], as peat fires can burn almost indefinitely (or at least until the fuel is exhausted). Peat fires can even burn [[underground]], reigniting after the winter, provided there is a source of oxygen. Peat deposits also pose major difficulties to builders of structures, roads, and railways, as they are highly compressible under even small loads. When the [[West Highland Line]] was built across [[Rannoch Moor]] in western [[Scotland]], its builders had to float the tracks on a mattress of tree roots, brushwood and thousands of tons of earth and ashes.
