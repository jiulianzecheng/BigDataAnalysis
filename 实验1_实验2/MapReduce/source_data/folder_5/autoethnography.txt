'''Autoethnography''' is a method of [[Social sciences|social]] [[research]] whose defining characteristic is that the author links personal experience and autobiography with [[Society|social]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Culture|cultural]] concepts. Its difference from [[ethnography]] is the high degree of [[subjectivity]] that is introduced to the study, and the fact that the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant [[observation]] invites. 
 
 == Different definitions of auto-ethnography == 
 Maréchal defines auto-ethnography as “a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing”. < ref > Maréchal, Garance (2010), p. 43 < /ref >  In the 1970s it was more simply defined as “insider ethnography”, referring to the fact that the group of study is the ethnographer’s own. < ref > Hayano(1979) < /ref > 
 
 == Benefits and concerns regarding auto-ethnography == 
 The most significant element that auto-ethnography introduces to the study of culture and society is the shift from a depersonalized, “seen from a vantage point” and neutrally distanced narrative to a storyline with which the audience can engage [[moral]]ly, [[wikt:aesthetically|aesthetically]], and [[intellect]]ually, and, thus, co-participate in the events described. < ref > Ellis and Bochner (2000) < /ref >  Especially for ethnographers who use multiple informants, auto-ethnography introduces an alternative way of writing where “the distinction between ethnographer and ‘others’ is unclear”, < ref > Khosravi (2010, p. 5 < /ref >  thereby challenging “imposed identities and boundaries”. < ref > Pratt (1992) < /ref > 
 
 However, auto-ethnographers should avoid some dangerous pitfalls that could undermine the credibility and usefulness of their work. Chang identifies the following:  " (1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography " . < ref > Chang (2008), p 54 < /ref >
