 An '''engineer''' is a person with a proper education in the field of [[engineering]]. The word ''engineer'' is derived from the [[Latin]] root ''ingenium'', meaning  " cleverness " . < ref > Oxford Concise Dictionary, 1995 < /ref >  Engineers design [[material]]s, [[structure]]s, [[machines]] and [[system]]s while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, [[safety]] and [[Price|cost]]. Much of the work is [[applied science]], using information given by [[scientist|scientists]] to do their work. Apart from working with [[wikt:thing|things]], an engineer must also be good at working with [[people]] and [[money]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.niee.org/nafta.html |title=Principles of Ethical conduct in Engineering Practice Under The North American Free Trade Agreement |access-date=2011-03-04 |archive-date=2010-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730044651/http://www.niee.org/nafta.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Types of engineer== 
 
 * [[aerospace engineering|Aerospace engineers]] design space vehicles or airplanes.  
 * [[biomedical engineering|Biomedical engineers]] design and work with medical equipment. 
 * [[chemical engineering|Chemical engineers]] use chemicals to make products like drugs and medicines or fertilizers for crops. 
 * [[civil engineering|Civil engineers]] work on roads, bridges, buildings and other public structures. 
 * [[computer engineering|Computer engineers]] design and build computers and the parts that computers are made of. 
 * [[electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] work with [[electricity]] and design electrical equipment, from small things like radios and computers to large things like the wires that carry electricity across the country. 
 * [[electronic engineering|Electronic engineers]] work with [[electronics]], which are used to build computer parts and electrical equipment.  
 * [[environment|Environmental engineers]] design and implement solutions to remediate and restore the environment.  
 * [[manufacturing engineering|Manufacturing engineers]] design and improve the machines and assembly lines that make things. They work with robots, hydraulics and air-operated devices to help companies work faster and better with fewer mistakes. 
 * [[mechanical engineering|Mechanical engineers]] design machines or things that move, like cars and trains. A mechanical engineer also might help design electricity generating stations, oil refineries, and factories. 
 * [[mechatronics engineering|Mechatronics engineers]] build robots and things that are like robots, but not exactly. They do things that are robotic-like. 
 *Ocean engineering and Naval Architecture works on construction of ships, submarines and off shore bodies. 
 * [[nanotechnology|Nanotechnology engineers]] study very small things, like strings of atoms and how they are put together. 
 * [[nuclear engineering|Nuclear engineers]] design and build nuclear plants. They also study the characteristic behaviors of certain radioactive or unstable elements. 
 * [[Structural engineering|Structural engineers]] are dealing with [[design]] and [[analysis]] of [[building]]s and large non-building [[structure]]s to withstand both the [[gravity]] and [[wind]] loads as well as [[natural disaster]]s. 
 * [[software engineering|Software engineers]] design and write programs for computers. 
 * [[systems engineering|Systems engineers]] look at how complicated things work and try to make them faster and smarter. They look at the big picture. 
 
 Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. 
 Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other.  As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to   
 build a computer.  The computer needs programs written by software engineers.  The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an  
 [[airplane]].  An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed.
