These include [[broadcasting]], [[automobile]]s, [[cell phone]]s, and others to mean their [[wikt:core|core]] [[Product (business)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/flagship-brand.html |title=flagship brand |author= |work= |publisher=WebFinance, Inc.|archive-date=2015-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226030725/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/flagship-brand.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
