'''Urheimat''' ([[German language|German]]: ''ur-'' [[original]], [[Ancient history|ancient]]; ''Heimat'' [[home]], [[homeland]]) is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] term meaning the original homeland of the speakers of a [[proto-language]]. Since many peoples tend to wander and spread, there is no exact Urheimat, but there is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] Urheimat different from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Romance languages|Romance]] Urheimat. Recent studies say the original home of Indo-Europeans was near the [[Armenian Highland]]s. < ref > Russell D. Grey  &  Quentin D.
