 '''Mucus''' (mucous), or slime, is a slippery liquid. It is made by many living things as a kind of biological [[lubricant]]. It plays the role in living things which [[oil]] plays in machines.  
 
 Mucus is mainly composed of [[polysaccharide]]s, which are [[polymer|long-chain]] [[carbohydrate]]s. These molecules are stiff when dry, and sticky and slippery when wet. They are present in all types of organisms from [[bacteria]] to humans.  
 
 In [[vertebrate]]s mucus is made by [[mucous membrane]]s. Mucus may have [[antiseptic]] [[enzyme]]s (such as [[lysozyme]]s) and [[immunoglobulin]]s ([[antigen]]s). < ref > Singh P.K. ''et al'' 2002. A component of innate immunity prevents bacterial biofilm development. ''Nature'' '''417''' (6888): 552â€“5. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6888/full/417552a.html] < /ref >  A major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]].  
 
 Mucus protects [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] in the [[lung]]s, [[gut]], [[genital]], visual, and [[hearing|auditory]] systems in [[mammal]]s; the [[epidermis]] in [[amphibian]]s; and the [[gill]]s in [[fish]]. [[Snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[hagfish]], and certain [[invertebrate]]s also produce external mucus. As well as a protective function, slime helps movement and plays a role in communication.  
 
 Mucus is produced in many parts of the body. All the [[alimentary canal]], nose, and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces. The surfaces are mostly internal surfaces, though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal. [[Slug]]s are an example of this. Mucus glands are [[exocrine gland]]s, so they pass their mucus to the surface along [[wikt:duct|duct]]s. 
 
 == Alkaline mucus == 
 In the human [[digestive system]], mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over [[membranes]], such as food passing down the [[oesophagus]].   
 
 A layer of mucus along the inner walls of the [[stomach]] is vital to protect the cell linings from the highly [[acid]]ic environment inside the stomach. < ref name=acids > {{cite magazine|last=Purves|first=William|title=Why don't our digestive acids corrode our stomach linings?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-dont-our-digestive-ac|magazine=Scientific American|accessdate=6 December 2012|quote=Second, HCl in the lumen doesn't digest the mucosa because goblet cells in the mucosa secrete large quantities of protective mucus that line the mucosal surface.}} < /ref >   Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract.  
 
 Alkaline mucus is also found in other places, such as [[eyes]],  [[saliva]] and [[cervix]]. < ref > Wang, Ying-Ying ''et al'' 2013. The microstructure and bulk rheology of human cervicovaginal mucus are remarkably resistant to changes in pH. ''Biomacromolecules'' '''14''' (12) 4429-35.
