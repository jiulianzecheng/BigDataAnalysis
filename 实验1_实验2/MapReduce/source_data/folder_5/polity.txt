A '''polity''' is a group of people who are brought together by any form of [[Politics|political agreement]] and who consider themselves as forming an [[Autonomy|autonomous]] unit. The political agreement uniting the group may be of different types: it can be a written [[constitution]] or even the unwritten recognition and respect of a [[hierarchy]] within the group. Depending on the size of the polity, it can be organized by a [[government]] or other, simpler forms of hierarchy. It is important to realize that the term polity can be used to refer to big entities like [[state]]s, [[empire]]s, and [[Kingdom|kingdoms]], but also to smaller units like [[chiefdoms]]. What counts in calling a given group  " a polity "  is not its size nor the form of government it has. To be called  " a polity "  a group must be an organized and autonomous group that has exclusive rights of use of a specific portion of land.
