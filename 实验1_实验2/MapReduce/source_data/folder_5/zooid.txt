A '''zooid''' is a term for a small individual animal, part of a [[Ocean|marine]] [[colony (biology)|colony]]. The zooids in a colony are usually [[clone]]s, and may be [[cytoplasm]]ically connected. Though genetically identical, the zooids in a colony may serve different functions. This is the same as would be the case with a normal [[metazoa]]n animal, but in a zooid colony the members are more like individuals.  
 
 The word is pronounced ''z≈ç-oid'', not like zoo. Some examples: 
 
 *Individual members of a [[bryozoa]]n colony. 
 *Individual members of a living [[coral]]. 
 *Individual members of a [[Portuguese Man o' War]].
