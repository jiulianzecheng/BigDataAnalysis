 A '''Neume''' is a way to write [[music]]. Neumes were mainly in the [[Middle Ages]] before the modern system of [[musical notation]] was developed. Sometimes they are also called '''neum''' in English. < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=eg3HCEqhV-8C Dom Gregory Sunol, Textbook of Gregorian Chant According to the Solesmes Method 2003] {{ISBN|0766172414}}, 9780766172418 < /ref > < ref > [http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/chantsofchurch.pdf Chants of the Church] < /ref > < ref > [http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/liberusualis.pdf Liber Usualis] < /ref >   Neumes are different from modern notation: 
 *There is no exact idea of how high or low tune should be sung; there are only indications. 
 *Neumes do not show [[rhythm]], extra symbols are used to show rhythm or [[intonation]] 
 
 Today, neumes are still used for some chants in Christian Churches, especially [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] ones
