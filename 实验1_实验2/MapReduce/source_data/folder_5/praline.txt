 '''Praline''' is a [[confectionery|confection]] made from [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s and [[sugar syrup]].  They may be in whole pieces or a ground powder.  The powder is called  " pralin " . [[Belgium|Belgian]] pralines are different.  They have a hard chocolate shell with a softer, sometimes liquid, filling. [[France|French]] pralines are a combination of [[almonds]] and caramelized [[sugar]]. [[United States|American]] pralines have [[milk]] or [[cream]].  They are therefore softer and creamier, like [[fudge]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=New York Food Journal Guide to New Orleans Street Food|url=http://nyfoodjournal.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-orleans-street-foods-snacks.html}} < /ref >
