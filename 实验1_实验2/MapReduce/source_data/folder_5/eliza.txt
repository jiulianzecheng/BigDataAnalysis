 '''ELIZA''' is an early [[natural language processing|program able to process natural language]]. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to ''scripts''. The most famous script was called '''DOCTOR'''. It was a simulation of a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian psychotherapist]]. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR sometimes provided [[wikt:conversation|conversation]] like a [[human]]. ELIZA was written at [[MIT]] by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] between 1964 and 1966. 
 
 When the person used words that were not in the very small list, 
 DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to  " My head hurts " ,  " Why do you say your head hurts? "  The response to  " My mother hates me "  might be  " Who else in your family hates you? "  ELIZA was programmed using simple [[pattern matching]] techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first [[chatterbot]]s in existence.
