 '''Do-Aklin''' or '''Gangnihessou''' (Ganye Hessou) or '''Dogbari''' was the first of twelve [[king]]s of [[Dahomey]] in [[Africa]]. Gangnihessou might have been the king around the year 1620. One of his symbols was a [[bird]] called  " gangnihessou "  after his name. His other symbols were a [[drum]], and sticks used for throwing or hunting. He had a younger brother called [[Dakodonou]], who was a king. Some [[historian]]s think Gangnihessou was not actually a king. Instead, Gangnihessou might have led people by giving advice to his brother.
