'''Reform''' means a useful change, or sometimes [[wikt:reversion|reversion]] to a pure original state. 
 
 “Reform” means changes. The [[UK]] government frequently uses the term  " reform "  to describe changes to public services, such as the [[National Health Service]]. But these changes are not accepted by all people as useful. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7366653.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Junior doctors attack NHS reforms < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > 
 
 ==Re-form== 
 A note about [[grammar]]: when used to describe something which is ''physically'' formed again, such as re-casting it in a mold/mould, or a band that gets back together, the proper term is '''re-form''' (with a [[hyphen]]), not  " reform " .
