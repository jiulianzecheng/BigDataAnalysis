 '''Hamas''' ({{lang-ar|حماس}}, [[acronym]] of '''Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''', {{lang-ar| حركة المقاومة الاسلامية}}, literally  " Islamic Resistance Movement " ) is a [[Palestine|Palestinian]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[militant group]]. It was started in [[1987]] during the [[First Intifada]] by [[Ahmed Yassin]] and [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] as the [[Gaza]] branch of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] organization in [[Egypt]]. In the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|2006 Palestinian election]], Hamas got 74 of 132 seats in parliament and controls the [[Gaza Strip]]. The group wants to build a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] based on Sharia law in the area that is now [[Israel]], the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip]]. Hamas does not recognize the State of Israel. < ref name=cfr/ >  Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by many countries due to its attacks, including suicide bombings and rocket attacks against the state of Israel. 
 
 == Name == 
 ''Hamas'' is an [[acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase {{lang-ar|حركة المقاومة الاسلامية}}, or '''Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''' or  " Islamic Resistance Movement " . The Hebrew meaning of the name Hamas (חמס; as used in the Hebrew Bible) is  " violence " . 
 
 == Violence == 
 Hamas is known for its military wing, the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], which plans and carries out attacks on Israel. Because of its policy of [[suicide bombing]]s and rocket attacks on civilians in Israel, < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hamas-1.5598922|title=Hamas|publisher=Haaretz.com|quote= " ...in 1993 Hamas launched its first suicide attack inside Israel, a practice that it would uphold from then on, causing massive Israeli civilian casualties. " |access-date=December 22, 2019}} < /ref >  the [[United States]], [[European Union]] and other countries call it a [[terrorism|terrorist]] organisation. The country of [[Jordan]] has banned the group. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Hirst|first=David|date=22 November 1999|title=Jordan curbs Hamas|language=en-GB|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/22/israel|access-date=8 November 2023|issn=0261-3077}} < /ref >   
 
 Many non-state groups support the use of “terrorist organization” to describe Hamas; [[Zionist]] organizations and other pro-Israel groups in particular support this. These groups also exert pressure on the [[journalism|international press]] to use this language. < ref > {{Cite web|last=AFP and ToI Staff|title=Hundreds protest at BBC headquarters over refusal to refer to Hamas as terror group|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hundreds-protest-at-bbc-headquarters-over-refusal-to-refer-to-hamas-as-terror-group/|access-date=2023-10-17|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  However, many of the international press, including the [[English language|English-language]] edition of the Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' and until 20th October 2023, the [[BBC]], refer to Hamas members by the more neutral term  " militants” instead.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=BBC drops ‘militant’ as default description for Hamas|url=https://www.ft.com/content/20b5466e-d690-4e00-828e-5f364e22f1c5|access-date=2023-10-20|website=www.ft.com|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 == Popularity == 
 In early [[2006]], Hamas won a clear victory in the vote for the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative election]]. Voters saw Hamas as an alternative to exchange the long-ruling [[Fatah]] party, the main part of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]. Fatah had not improved the Palestinian people's conditions and reached statehood, and was thought to be corrupt. 
 
 == Local work == 
 Hamas has shown its organizational ability by building health, education, and social services to help the population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, where there is much [[poverty]]. Such efforts have increased its support. In the first half of [[2007]], Hamas gained political control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah keeps its headquarters in the West Bank. < ref name=cfr > {{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/8968/#6|title=Hamas|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=19 January 2016|archive-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602205041/http://www.cfr.org/publication/8968/#6|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
