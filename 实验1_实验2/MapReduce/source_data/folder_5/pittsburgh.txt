 '''Pittsburgh''' is a [[city]] in the [[United States|American]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. The city was known in the 20th century for its [[steel]] [[industry]]. However, with the collapse of United States steel industry in the 1980s, the [[economy]] of Pittsburgh is now mostly based on [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[technology]], and [[financial services]]. It is also the home of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] [[American football|football]] team, who have won the [[Super Bowl]] six times, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] team, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Pittsburgh is the [[county seat]] for [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]]. The Allegheny and Monongahela rivers meet in Pittsburgh and form the [[Ohio River]]. 
 
 Pittsburgh is in western [[Pennsylvania]]. It has a [[population]] of 312,819 people and a [[metropolitan area|metro]] population of almost 2,400,040 people. Pittsburgh was the most livable city in the United States in 2007. In 2014 Pittsburgh was ranked sixth in the country for polluted cities by the [[American Lung Association]]. 
 
 The [[French and Indian War]] started when [[George Washington]] went to Pittsburgh.  Later it was a center of the [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. 
 
 The city is served by the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].
