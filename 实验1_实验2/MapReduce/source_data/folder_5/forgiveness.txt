 '''Forgiveness''' is the [[choice]] that a person makes not to [[Punishment|punish]] or try to get [[revenge]] against another person for something bad that the other person did or something that is [[illegal]] or [[immoral]]. When someone forgives someone else, they stop hating that person. < ref name= " apa " > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.apa.org/international/resources/forgiveness.pdf | title = American Psychological Association.

 ==Introduction== 
 Forgiveness is a [[mind|mental]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] process. It means no longer feeling [[anger|angry]] at another person, or at yourself. This could be because of a [[crime]], a [[sin]], an offense, an [[insult]], a difference, an error, a [[wikt:mistake|mistake]], or a [[failure]]. 
 
 Forgiveness does not require [[punishment]] or [[wikt:restitution|restitution]]. It is given without any expectation of [[wikt:compensation|compensation]]. Forgiveness may involve offering an [[wikt:apology|apology]]. 
 
 Forgiveness involves the feelings of the person who forgives and their relationship with the person being forgiven. Forgiveness can occur without the person being forgiven ever knowing about it. For example, a person can forgive another person who is dead or who is not seen for a long time. 
 
 Forgiveness means forgetting offenses. It is [[wikt:sincere|sincere]] and [[wikt:genuine|genuine]]. It does not impose [[wikt:humiliation|humiliating]] conditions. It is not [[wikt:motivate|motivate]]d by [[pride]]. True forgiveness is known by [[wikt:deed|deed]]s and not by [[word]]s. 
 
 [[q:Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] said,  " The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong. " 
 
 ==Religious views of forgiveness== 
 
 Most world [[religion]]s include teachings about forgiveness. These teachings form the basis of modern [[tradition]]s and practices of forgiveness. 
 
 ===Judaism=== 
 In [[Judaism]], if a person causes [[harm]], he or she must go to those he or she has harmed and ask for forgiveness. < ref name = YomKippur > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday4.htm | title = ''JewFAQ discussion of forgiveness on Yom Kippur'' | accessdate = 2006-04-26}} < /ref >  If he or she [[wikt:sincere|sincerely]] and [[wikt:honest|honestly]] [[wikt:apologize|apologize]]s to the person who he or she has harmed and tries to [[wikt:rectify|rectify]] the wrong, the wronged person must forgive him or her.

 Each year, Jews observe [[Yom Kippur]], or a Day of [[Atonement]]. < ref name = YomKippur/ >  [[Ten Days of Repentance|Before]] Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the past year (if they have not already done so). < ref name = YomKippur/ >  During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for [[God]]'s forgiveness for the sins they have made against God in the past year. < ref name = YomKippur/ >  God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God. This is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek forgiveness from those people who they have wronged. < ref name = YomKippur/ > 
 
 ===Christianity=== 
 
 In [[Christianity]], [[Jesus]] spoke of the importance of forgiving others, or showing [[mercy]]. In the [[New Testament]], there are several examples.  
 < blockquote > 
 “Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.” —Matthew 5:7 (NIV)  
 < /blockquote > 
 < blockquote > 
 “But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.” —Luke 6:27-29 (NIV)  
 < /blockquote > 
 < blockquote > 
 “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.” —Luke 6:36 (NIV)

 < /blockquote > 
 Jesus used the [[:en:w:Parable of the unforgiving servant|Parable of the Unforgiving Servant]] (Matthew 18:21-35) to say that we should forgive without limits. The [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] < ref > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.comparativereligion.com/prodigal.html | title = The Parable of the Prodigal Son in Christianity and Buddhism | accessdate = 2009-02-03}} < /ref >  is perhaps the best known [[Parables of Jesus|parable]] about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people. 
 
 ===Islam=== 
 [[Islam]] teaches that [[Allah]] is ''Al-Ghaffur'' ( " The Oft-Forgiving " ) and that Allah is the original source of all forgiveness (''ghufran'' غفران). Seeking forgiveness from Allah with [[repentance]] is a [[virtue]]. < ref name=nnjre > Abu‐Nimer  &  Nasser (2013), ''Forgiveness in The Arab and Islamic Contexts'', Journal of Religious Ethics, 41(3), pp 474-494 < /ref > 
 
 There are numerous verses in the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Hadith]]s that recommend forgiveness.  
 < blockquote > 
 " Allah forgives what is past. "  —Qur'an 5:95 
 < /blockquote > 
 Islam recommends forgiveness between believers, because Allah values forgiveness. However, Islam also allows revenge, to the extent of the harm that was done.  
 < blockquote > 
 " The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto: but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for Allah loveth not those who do wrong. "  —Qur'an 42:40 
 < /blockquote > 
 Forgiveness between believers is encouraged, with a promise of reward from Allah. < ref name=mhk > Mohammad Hassan Khalil (2012), ''Islam and the Fate of Others: The Salvation Question'', Oxford University Press, pp 65-94, {{ISBN|978-0199796663}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Bahá'í Faith=== 
 In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[:en:w:Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í literature]] explains how to be forgiving towards others. 
 < blockquote > 
 " Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness. "  —[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace'', p. 92 
 < /blockquote > 
 The writings of [[Shoghi Effendi]], the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, state that you should  " forgive and forget "  a person's actions against you, so that you will be forgiven. < ref > {{cite web | year = 1991 | url = http://bahai-library.com/compilation_living_the_life | title = Living the Life | accessdate = 2015-03-21}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Buddhism=== 
 In [[Buddhism]], forgiveness prevents harmful thoughts from damaging a person’s [[mind|mental]] well-being. < ref > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | title = Psychjourney – Introduction to Buddhism Series | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | archive-date = 2006-04-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060414062806/http://www.psychjourney.com/Buddhism%20Series.htm | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Buddhism recognizes that feelings of [[hatred]] have a lasting effect on [[karma]]. Buddhism encourages thoughts that have a positive effect.  
 < blockquote > 
 " In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing [[mettā]] and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all. " < ref > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Universal Loving Kindness | accessdate = 2009-02-07 | archive-date = 2008-12-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082606/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/universal_loving_kindness/#top | url-status = dead }} < /ref >   
 < /blockquote > 
 When there is resentment, the Buddhist practice is to calmly release them. Buddhism focuses on release from suffering through [[meditation]]. 
 
 Buddhism questions the emotions that make forgiveness necessary. < ref > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://josephsoleary.typepad.com/my_weblog/buddhism/index.html | title = Spirit of Vatican II: Buddhism – Buddhism and Forgiveness | accessdate = 2009-02-07}} < /ref >   
 < blockquote > 
 " If we haven’t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers. " < ref > {{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | title = Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery - Preparing for Death | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | archive-date = 2006-01-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060118231818/http://www.abhayagiri.org/index.php/main/article/preparing_for_death/#top | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 < /blockquote > 
 Buddhism emphasizes ''[[mettā]]'' (loving kindness), ''[[karuṇā]]'' (compassion), ''[[mudita]]'' ([[joy]]), and ''[[upekkhā]]'' ([[equanimity]]), as ways to avoid resentments in the first place. These ideas help to understand suffering in the world, both our own suffering and the suffering of others. 
 
 ===Hinduism=== 
 Forgiveness is one of the six cardinal virtues of [[Hinduism]]. A person who does not forgive carries [[wikt:baggage|baggage]] of bad memories, negative feelings, and unresolved emotions that affect the present as well as the future. In Hinduism, one must forgive others, and one must also seek forgiveness for wronging someone else. < ref name=mpt > Michael E. McCullough, Kenneth I. Pargament, Carl E. Thoresen (2001), Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice, The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, pp 21-39 < /ref > 
 
 Hindu [[Epic poetry|epics]] and [[wikt:ancient|ancient]] [[literature]] also discuss forgiveness. For example: 
 < blockquote > 
 " Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is the Vedas; forgiveness is the Shruti; ... forgiveness is holiness; and by forgiveness ... the universe is held together. "  —[[Mahabharata]], Book 3, Vana Parva, Section XXIX < ref > [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15474/15474-h/15474-h.htm#link2H_4_0322 Vana Parva], see Section XXIX; Gutenberg Archives Mahabharata Vol I (Kisari Mohan Ganguli 1896); Produced by John B. Hare, David King, and David Widger < /ref > 
 < /blockquote > 
 < blockquote > 
 " Righteousness is the one highest good, forgiveness is the one supreme peace, knowledge is one supreme contentment, and benevolence, one sole happiness. "  —[[Mahabharata]], Book 5, Udyoga Parva, Section XXXIII < ref > [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05033.htm Udyoga Parva] see page 61-62, Mahabharata, Translated by Sri Kisari Mohan Ganguli < /ref > 
 < /blockquote > 
 
 In Hinduism, you seek forgiveness from those you have wronged, and from society at large through charity, purification, fasting, rituals, and meditation. Forgiveness in Hinduism does not require that a person make peace with their offender and it does not rule out reconciliation in some situations. Forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. < ref > Temoshok and Chandra, Forgiveness: Theory, Research, and Practice, The Guildford Press, {{ISBN|978-1572307117}}, see Chapter 3 < /ref >  Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from [[wikt:negative|negative]] thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (''dharmic'' life). < ref name=mpt/ >  In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one’s personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (''akrodhi''). < ref > Radhakrishnan (1995), Religion and Society, Indus, Harper Collins India < /ref > < ref > Sinha (1985), Indian psychology, Vol 2, Emotion and Will, Motilal Banarsidas, New Delhi < /ref > 
 
 ===Jainism=== 
 In [[Jainism]], forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be [[wikt:acquire|acquire]]d by the Jains.

 By practicing ''prāyaṣcitta'' (repentance), a soul gets rid of sins, and commits no transgressions; he who correctly practises ''prāyaṣcitta'' gains the road and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.— Māhavīra in ''Uttarādhyayana Sūtra'' 29:17–18

 I ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me. 
 May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.

 In their daily prayers, Jains seek forgiveness from all creatures: < ref > Translated from Prakrit by Nagin J. shah and Madhu Sen (1993) ''Concept of Pratikramana'' Ahmedabad: Gujarat Vidyapith pp.25–26 < /ref > 
 < blockquote > 
 I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.

 Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.'' This phrase means,  " May all the evil that has been done be fruitless. " < ref > Chapple. C.K.
