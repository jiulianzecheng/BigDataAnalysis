 An '''emergency''' is a situation in which a risk to [[health]], [[life]], [[property]] or [[environment]] is about to happen. Most emergencies need quick attention to prevent it from becoming worse. Even though some emergencies are easy to see, like a [[natural disaster]], many smaller incidents need the opinion of someone who is watching in order to decide whether it is really an emergency. The exact definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the rules followed, depend on the [[jurisdiction]], and this is usually set by the [[government]], whose agencies (emergency services) are responsible for emergency planning and handling. < ref > {{cite web|title=UK Government Advice on Definition of an Emergency|url=http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf|accessdate=2007-09-20|archive-date=2007-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606230917/http://www.ukresilience.info/upload/assets/www.ukresilience.info/15mayshortguide.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
