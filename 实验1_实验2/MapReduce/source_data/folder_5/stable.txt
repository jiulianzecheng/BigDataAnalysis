 A '''stable''' is a building for [[livestock]] animals such as [[horse]]s or [[cow]]s to live in. 
 
 A stable often has a loft where [[food]] such as [[hay]] can be kept to feed the animals in the winter.  The stable may be divided into enclosures or stalls to keep the animals separate. 
 
 A stable is most likely to be built near a [[House#Farmhouse|farmhouse]].
