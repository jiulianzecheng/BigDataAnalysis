A '''delusion''' is a false [[belief]] held by a person. When [[Medical doctor|doctors]] talk about delusions, they mean that the false belief is the result of some [[disease]]. This is usually a disease of the [[mind]], such as [[paranoia]], [[schizophrenia]] or [[bipolar disorder]], but not always. Delusions can come in many forms, such as [[Persecution|persecutory]] delusions (a belief that the person is always being attacked), grandiose delusions (a belief that the person is very special), religious delusions (a belief that the person is a [[god]]), and more.  
 
 The psychiatrist [[Karl Jaspers]] created the first [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] for a belief to be considered a delusion: < ref > {{Cite book|title=Allgemeine Psychopathologie. Ein Leitfaden für Studierende, Ärzte und Psychologen.|last=Jaspers|first=Karl|publisher=J. Springer|year=1913|location=Berlin}} < /ref > 
 * The person that has the delusion is completely convinced that it is true.  
 * The delusion does not change even when it is proved to be wrong. 
 * The delusion is improbable or strange. 
 However, these [[wikt:guideline|guidelines]] have been criticized because none of the criteria are necessary to have a delusion. Studies show that delusions can change in intensity and confidence over time. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Myin-Germeys I, Nicolson NA, Delespaul PA|date=April 2001|title=The context of delusional experiences in the daily life of patients with schizophrenia|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_psychological-medicine_2001-04_31_3/page/489|journal=Psychol Med|volume=31|issue=3|pages=489–98|doi=10.1017/s0033291701003646|pmid=11305857|s2cid=25884819}} < /ref >  Delusions also do not need to be false beliefs. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Spitzer M|year=1990|title=On defining delusions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0010-440X(90)90023-L|journal=Compr Psychiatry|volume=31|issue=5|pages=377–97|doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90023-L|pmid=2225797}} < br / > < /ref >  Some religious beliefs cannot be proved false, so they cannot be used for a [[diagnosis]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=Pathologies of belief|author=Young, A.W.|publisher=Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=0-631-22136-0|editor=Coltheart M., Davis M.|location=Oxford|pages=47–74|chapter=Wondrous strange: The neuropsychology of abnormal beliefs}} < /ref >   
 
 A doctor or [[psychiatrist]] may say that a delusion is false because it ''seems'' to be improbable or strange. Because psychiatrists do not always investigate a person's claims completely, they will sometimes wrongly diagnose a patient as delusional. < ref > {{cite book|title=Delusional Beliefs|url=https://archive.org/details/delusionalbelief0000unse|author=Maher B.A.|publisher=Wiley Interscience|year=1988|isbn=0-471-83635-4|editor=Oltmanns T., Maher B.|location=New York|chapter=Anomalous experience and delusional thinking: The logic of explanations}} < /ref >  This is called the [[Martha Mitchell effect]], which was named after the wife of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] in the Nixon administration. Martha Mitchell said that illegal activity was happening in the [[White House]]. At the time, people thought she was mentally ill. However, after the [[Watergate scandal]], she was proved right.  
 
 Treating delusions is hard, but sometimes [[Antipsychotic|antipsychotics]] can be used. If the delusions are dangerous to the person or other people, the person may also be treated against their will.
