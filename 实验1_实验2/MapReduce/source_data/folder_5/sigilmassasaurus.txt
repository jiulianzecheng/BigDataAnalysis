 '''''Sigilmassasaurus''''' was a [[carnivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Late Cretaceous]] of [[Africa]]. Its name means '' < nowiki/ > ' < nowiki/ > '' < nowiki/ > 'Sijilmassa lizard " , referring to the name of the city near the place where its [[fossil]]s were found. Its [[species]] name  " brevicollis "  is [[Latin]] for  " short neck " , because the neck bones of the animal are very short.

 == Discovery == 
 It was found and named by a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[paleontologist]] called Dale Russel in 1996, he found the fossils in [[Morocco]] at a fossil site called the Kem Kem Formation. The rocks the skeleton was found in are as old as the Cenomanian, which is the earliest [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, 100 to 94 & nbsp;million years ago. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite journal|last1=Sereno|first1=PC|last2=Dutheil|first2=DB|last3=Iarochene|first3=M|last4=Larsson|first4=HCE|last5=Lyon|first5=GH|last6=Magwene|first6=PM|last7=Sidor|first7=CA|last8=Varricchio|first8=DJ|last9=Wilson|first9=JA|year=1996|title=Predatory dinosaurs from the Sahara and Late Cretaceous faunal differentiation|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/13893/files/PAL_E831.pdf|journal=Science|volume=272|issue=5264|pages=986â€“991|doi=10.1126/science.272.5264.986|pmid=8662584|bibcode=1996Sci...272..986S|s2cid=39658297}} < /ref > 
 
 == Paleoecology == 
 
 Several large [[Predation|predatory]] dinosaurs weighing more than one [[tonne]] are known from the Late cretaceous of [[Northern Africa|North Africa]], this made paleontologists wonder how so many of them would have lived together. ''Sigilmassasaurus'' existed in the same time and place as other huge meat-eating dinosaurs like ''[[Spinosaurus]], [[Carcharodontosaurus]], [[Deltadromeus]],'' and ''[[Bahariasaurus]].'' The situation is a lot like in the Late [[Jurassic]] [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]], where there were up to five meat-eating dinosaurs weighing more than a tonne, as well as many smaller ones. The difference between their sizes and what they ate could explain why they could live so close to each other, scientists compared this to how predatory animals live alongside each-other in the [[Africa]]n [[savanna]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
