 '''Susanoo''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 須佐之男命, ''Susanoo-no-Mikoto''; also [[romanization|romanized]] as ''Susano'o'', ''Susa-no-O'', and ''Susanowo'') is the [[kami]] of the [[sea]] and storms in [[Shinto]]. 
 
 Susano'o is the brother of [[Amaterasu]], the goddess of the [[sun]], and of [[Tsukuyomi]], the god of the [[moon]]. All three were created from [[Izanagi]], when he washed his face to clean the [[dirt]]iness of [[Yomi]], the [[underworld]]. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susano'o from the washing of the nose. 
 
 The tales tell of great {{broken wikt link|rivalry|rivalry}} between Susano'o and his sister. When he was to leave [[Heaven]] forever because Izanagi ordered him to, he went to say goodbye to his sister. Amaterasu, suspicious, proposed him a [[wikt:challenge|challenge]]: each of them was to turn an object of the other's into people. Amaterasu created three women from Susano'o's sword while he created five men from her [[necklace]]. Amaterasu said the men were hers because they were born of her necklace. Susano'o destroyed her [[rice]] fields, threw a dead [[pony]] into her [[loom]], and killed one of her assistants in [[anger]]. For this, Amaterasu, sad, angry and scared, went to hide inside [[Ama-no-Iwato]], the '' " heavenly rock [[cave]] " '', so the Sun was hidden and the world became dark for a long time. 
 
 Amaterasu later was made to come out of the cave, but Susano'o was [[punishment|punished]] by being banished from Heaven. He came down to the province of [[Izumo]], where he met [[Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi|an old couple]]. Seven of their eight daughters had been eaten by the eight-headed [[serpent]] [[Yamata-no-Orochi]] and it was about to come for the eighth, [[Kushinadahime|Kushi-inada-hime]]. After the couple promised their daughter's hand in [[marriage]] to Susano'o, he agreed to kill Orochi. With the help of eight bowls of ''[[sake]]'' (one for each head), Susano'o cut the head off the monster when it was sleeping. 
 
 From one of Orochi's [[tail]]s, Susano'o took out a sword, which he called ''Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi'' ( " Heaven's Cloud-Gathering Sword " ), later known as the ''[[Kusanagi|Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi]]''. The sword was given to Amaterasu as a {{broken wikt link|reconciliation|reconciliation}} gift and was later given to her [[descendant]] [[Ninigi]] (the great-grandfather of [[Emperor Jimmu]]), with the ''Yata-no-Kagami'' (a mirror) and ''magatama'' (sacred jewels) as [[proof]] of his divine [[Rights|right]] to rule on Earth (the three [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]]). 
 
 == Izumo == 
 Amaterasu's [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] is at [[Ise Shrine]], and Susano'o's is in Izumo, where he came down to Earth when banished from heaven. Izumo is home to the oldest shrines in Japan. 
 == In popular culture == 
 In a [[Meitei language]] play named ''[[Yamata Amasung Keibu Keioiba]]'' ({{lang-en|Yamata-no-Orochi and Keibu Keioiba}}), the role of Susanoo was played by ''Romario Thoudam Paona''. The play interweaves the stories of two legendary creatures, [[Yamata-no-Orochi]] of [[Japanese mythology]] and [[Keibu Keioiba]] of [[Meitei mythology]] ([[Manipuri mythology]]). < ref > {{Cite web|title=YAMATA AMASUNG KEIBU KEIOIBA – 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav 2020|url=https://www.21brm.nsd.gov.in/yamata-amasung-keibu-keioiba/|access-date=|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422224323/https://www.21brm.nsd.gov.in/yamata-amasung-keibu-keioiba/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-02-16|title=Heisnam Tomba's Play: Yamata Amasung Keibu Keioiba|url=https://stagebuzz.in/2020/02/16/heisnam-tombas-play-yamata-amasung-keibu-keioiba/|access-date=|website=StageBuzz|language=en-GB}} < /ref >
