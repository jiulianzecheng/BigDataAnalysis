 The '''pliosaurs''' were a group of large [[Marine biology|marine]] [[plesiosaur]] [[reptile]]s. They lived in the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]] (later [[Jurassic]] period). They had short necks and large heads, with large hind flippers. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres. They were [[Predation|predators]] of large fish and other marine reptiles. < ref > Benson R.B.J; Evans M; Smith A.S. Sassoon J. Moore-Faye S. Ketchum H.F.  &  Forrest R. 2013. Butler, Richard J (ed).

 The first specimen was found by [[Mary Anning]], on the [[Jurassic Coast]] of [[Lyme Regis]], England, in the 1820s. Many of her finds are on display in the [[Natural History Museum]], [[London]]. 
 
 Their body shape suggests they swam and ate under water. < ref > Benton M.J. 2004. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. 3rd ed, Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p29 < /sup >  It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that plesiosaurs fell into two groups. The pliosaurs were large predators which ate large prey in deep water. The other plesiosaurs were long-necked with smaller heads. Their method was as surface swimmers, mostly eating with their head above water, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on [[plankton]]. < ref > Watson D.M.S. 1951.
