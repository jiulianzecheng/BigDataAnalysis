 '''''Negaprion''''' is one of the 12 [[genus|genera]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Carcharhinidae]]. There are currently two known living [[species]] in this genus: the [[Lemon shark]], and the [[Sicklefin lemon shark]]. 
 
 Both species are large and stocky, have a wide, blunt snout, and have two large [[dorsal fin]]s of similar size. They are both yellowish-brown on their dorsal surface, and have a white belly. 
 They also both have a similar diet consisting of [[bony fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[stingray]]s, and smaller [[shark]]s. Also, both species are [[viviparous]]. 
 
 == Lemon shark== 
 The Lemon shark is the smaller of the two species, reaching a maximum length of 3.4 metres, but usually ranges between the lengths of 2.4 to 3 metres long. Pups are around 24 to 26 inches long when born. 
 
 The Lemon shark inhabits [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] shallow waters of [[coastal]] areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is often found in [[coral reef]]s, [[mangrove]]s, enclosed [[bay]]s, and even [[river]] mouths.  
 
 == Sicklefin lemon shark== 
 The Sicklefin lemon shark is the larger of the two species, reaching a maximum length of 3.8 metres. Pups are around 18 to 32 inches long when born. 
 
 The Sicklefin lemon shark inhabits continental and insular shelves, and is common on [[coral reef]]s, as well as in shallow, sandy-bottom [[lagoon]]s, and [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]s.
