 '''Latin''' is an [[Italic languages|Italic language]] that was used in Ancient Rome. Short Latin texts have been found from about the 5th century [[BC]] and longer texts from about the 3rd century BC.

 [[File:Easy spoken Latin for beginners with subtitles.webm|thumb|A woman speaking Latin]] 
 [[Classical Latin]] was used in the 1st century BC and was the [[official language]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. It was widely used in the western part of the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Romance languages]] developed from its spoken informal version, called [[Vulgar Latin]]. 
 
 Latin was very important to [[Christianity]] for many centuries. It is still spoken today during some religious activities. It is an [[official language]] in the [[Vatican]], where the [[Pope]] leads the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Church (building)|Church]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ask4geo.com/vatican_city.php|title=AskGeo - Vatican City|access-date=2009-03-04|archive-date=2009-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225185000/http://ask4geo.com/vatican_city.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  People in the Vatican sometimes speak to one another in Latin if they have different [[mother tongue|first language]]s). The [[mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the Catholic Church is often done entirely in Latin. It is called is the Mass of the Roman [[Rite]] (Extraordinary Form). 
 
 == Current usage == 
 [[File:WIKITONGUES- Titus speaking Latin.webm|thumb|A student speaking Latin]] 
 
 Latin is called a dead language because no one speaks it as a first language anymore. However, it is not an [[extinct language]] because it is still used in daily life by some people. In fact, many people still study it in school. Latin is still useful because it shows how society works. Latin makes it easier to learn the Romance languages. 
 
 People still read Latin [[classic]]s such as the poems of [[Virgil]], the memoirs of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and the speeches of [[Cicero]]. Also, Latin is widely used as an [[international auxiliary language]], notably in the [[Catholic Church]] and by [[biologist]]s when they describe and name new [[species]]. Some terms used in [[medicine]] to name parts of the body (such as bones), and names of some [[disease]]s, are also written in Latin. 
 
 == Varieties == 
 There are three types of Latin: [[Classical Latin]], [[Vulgar Latin]] and [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Classical Latin was used by the educated Romans and is still studied around the world. Vulgar Latin was the more common spoken variety used by the common Romans and was learned by the peoples conquered by them. Ecclesiastical Latin is common in Italian schools and still used by the Roman Catholic Church. 
 
 Latin was once the most important language in most of [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was taught in many European schools, and all [[university|universities]] used it as their teaching language. Latin began to lose its importance in the [[Reformation]], but it was still often used by [[writer]]s of scientific books and [[encyclopedia]]s. Until around [[1900]], many universities accepted [[Thesis|dissertations]] written in Latin. 
 
 As people from other regions of Europe learned Vulgar Latin during Roman [[conquest]]s, each region developed its own language, which was a simplified form of Latin. Those languages are called [[Romance languages]] and are still spoken today. The five Romance languages with the largest number of speakers are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. The Romance languages are very similar to one another, and speakers of one Romance language can understand many words and sentences in both texts and spoken conversations from another Romance language. For example, speakers of Portuguese can often understand Spanish. It can be said that the Romance languages are modern [[dialect]]s of Latin. 
 
 == Grammar == 
 [[File:Latin plaque 7 Jul 1883.jpg|thumb|The Latin on this plaque reads:  " In the year of 1883 after noon within the second and third hours, the Emperor Francis Joseph, with a company of people, deigned to honor this library with his presence. " ]] 
 Latin has a similar [[inflection]] structure to [[Ancient Greek]] but a different [[alphabet]]. 
 
 Latin has seven different [[Case (grammar)|noun cases]]: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Ablative case|ablative]] and [[Locative case|locative]]. The vocative case is almost always the same as the nominative case. The locative usually takes the form of the dative. Only place names and some nouns have the locative case. Latin nouns are declined, or changed, according to how they are used in the sentence. A noun can be declined five different ways. These ways are called [[declension]]s. The declensions are numbered 1 to 5 (first declension, second declension etc.), each having different endings that identify the noun's declension. When a noun is declined, twelve forms are made, two for each of the noun cases (the locative is omitted). 
 
 A similar thing is done to verbs, called conjugation. When a verb is conjugated, six forms are made. There are five factors that can change a verb: person, number, tense, voice and mood. In all, there are 120 possible forms Latin verbs. 
 
 == Writing Latin == 
 [[File:Lapis-niger.jpg|thumb|[[Lapis Niger]] is a [[stele]] from the 6th or 5th century BC. It bears one of the oldest known Latin inscriptions.]] 
 Latin used to be written on plates of [[wax]]. There was little space and so words were run together, with no space between words. Sometimes [[papyrus]] was used, but that was expensive. [[Punctuation]] was an ancient idea but came to Latin later. < ref > The [[Mesha Stele]] or Moabite Stone is a [[stele]] set up around 840 & nbsp;BC by King Mesha of [[Moab]] (a kingdom in modern [[Jordan]]). The stele uses [[Full stop|full stops]]. < /ref >  Lowercase letters (small letters) are relatively-modern inventions. The [[Roman alphabet]] was derived from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] .

 |colspan= " 2 " |This was the Golden Age that, without coercion, without laws, spontaneously nurtured the good and the true. There was no fear or punishment: there were no threatening words to be read, fixed in bronze, no crowd of suppliants fearing the judge’s face they lived safely without protection. No pine tree felled in the mountains had yet reached the flowing waves to travel to other lands: human beings only knew their own shores. There were no steep ditches surrounding towns, no straight war-trumpets, no coiled horns, no swords and helmets. Without the use of armies, people passed their lives in gentle peace and security.

 After the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], many people still used Latin. [[Academia|Scholars]] such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Petrarch]], [[Erasmus]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] wrote in Latin. For example, Hugo Grotius published his ''De jure belli ac pacis'' (On the Law of War and Peace) in Latin as late as 1625, which is one of the bases of [[international law]].
