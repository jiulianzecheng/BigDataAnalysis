 == History == 
 The oldest shield known was a [[tool|device]] used to block hand weapons and arrows. The shield has been constructed differently over time, even [[animal]] hides were used, and the size and weight were largely different as well. 
 
 === Middle Ages === 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Kite shield]]s were commonly used. The Kite shield is a shield in the form of a [[kite]]. Because of the lack of [[mobility]] due of the kite shields' weight, kite shields were given up for more mobility and two handed weapons. The Buckler was a shield with a [[round]] shape. It was commonly used as a replacement for the heavy Kite shields. 
 
 === Modern Shields === 
 
 Shields were used even after [[gunpowder]] weapons. the shield is still used by [[police]] and [[Army|army forces]] today. Many shields now in days are usually made from [[advanced]] [[material]], as well as [[electronics]]. Shields also vary from not only hand helds, but clothing, such as vests and, in a way, boots and gloves. 
 
 == Future == 
 The [[future]] of shields have varied from multiple ideas and fiction, usually [[force field (technology)|force fields]] and energy shields.
