 '''Hesiod''' (''Hesiodos'', {{polytonic|Ἡσίοδος}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[poet]]. He is probably the second Greek poet whose work has survived; like [[Homer]], his dates are not known for certain. As with Homer, there are numerous legends, none of which are supported by hard evidence. He may have lived around 700 BC in Askra in [[Boeotia]], as a [[farmer]]. Today his writings are one of the main sources for [[Greek mythology]], and everyday life in [[Ancient Greece]], such as [[farming]] techniques, [[astronomy]] and ancient [[time]]-keeping. The complete surviving works were published in 1493, and by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1495.
