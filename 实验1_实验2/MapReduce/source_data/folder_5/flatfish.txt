 A '''flatfish''' is a type of [[fish]] which is a member of the order '''Pleuronectiformes'''. There are several different kinds of flatfish. Some of them are fished commercially, like [[flounder]], [[sole]], [[turbot]], [[plaice]], and [[halibut]]. They are part of the [[Percomorpha]]. 
 
 All flatfish are rather flat, and are ray-finned fish. During their evolution, their eyes have moved so that they are on the same side, which the fish keeps uppermost. They swim like this, and can hide in the sand waiting for [[prey]] on the [[ocean floor]]. They have a capacity for dynamic [[camouflage]], which is under nervous control, and can change in 'real time' to match their background. 
 
 It is a group of fish which are all [[adapted]] to the same habitat. They share those features which suit their life-style. They have both eyes on one side of the head: the upper side. This is their main adaptation to living on the [[seabed]] ([[benthos]]). Other distinguishing features are the protrusible eyes: they can stick the eyes up a bit to see round. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 [[File:Amphistium.JPG|thumb|Fossil of ''[[Amphistium]]'' with one eye at the top-center of the head]] 
 
 The flatfish [[life-style]] or 'habit' evolved several times independently, so the group is [[polyphyletic]]. Their young are perfectly [[Bilateral symmetry|symmetrical]], but the head is remodelled during a [[metamorphosis]]. One eye moves to the other side, close to the other eye. Some species have both eyes on the left (turbot), some on the right (halibut, sole). All living and most fossil flatfish show an 'eyed' side and a 'blind' side. < ref name= " Janvier 2008 " > Janvier, Philip 2008. Squint of the fossil flatfish. ''Nature'' '''454''', 169 < /ref > 
 
 [[Charles Darwin]] predicted a gradual migration of the eye in evolution, mirroring the metamorphosis of the living forms. A recent examination of two fossil species from the [[Eocene]] shows  " the assembly of the flatfish bodyplan occurred in a gradual, stepwise fashion " . < ref name=Friedman > Friedman, Matt 2008. The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry. ''Nature'' '''454''', 209–212. < /ref >  The intermediate stages survived for quite a long time: over two geological stages. They are found in sites together with flatfish with the full cranial asymmetry. That shows the intermediate stages were at no particular disadvantage. Eventually, the more complete forms did survive. The evolution of flatfish falls squarely within the evolutionary synthesis. < ref name= " Janvier 2008 " / > 
 
 ''[[Amphistium]]'' is a 50-million-year-old fossil fish which has been identified as an early relative of the flatfish, and as a [[transitional fossil]]. In ''Amphistium'', the transition from the typical symmetrical head of a vertebrate is incomplete, with one eye placed near the top-center of the head. < ref name=Friedman/ >  Paleontologists concluded that  " the change happened gradually, in a way consistent with evolution by [[natural selection]]. 
 
 Today a large number of fish from various groups are flatfish. One report says over 800 species in 16 families of fish are flatfish. < ref > Campbell, Matthew A; Chanet, Bruno; Chen, Jhen‐Nien; Lee, Mao‐Ying; Chen, Wei‐Jen 2019.

 == Characteristics == 
 [[File:Pseudopleuronectes americanus.jpg|thumb|Flatfish are asymmetric, with both eyes lying on the same side of the head]] 
 The most obvious characteristic of flatfish is their [[asymmetry]]. If you see an adult flatfish, you can see the eyes lying on the same side of the head.
