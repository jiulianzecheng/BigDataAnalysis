 '''Squirrels''' are a large [[family (biology)|family]] of small to medium [[rodent]]s. It includes '''tree squirrels''', which are described on this page. 
 
 The other squirrels are: [[ground squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s, [[marmot]]s (including [[groundhog]]s), [[flying squirrel]]s, and [[prairie dog]]s.  
 
 Squirrels are [[native (ecology)|native]] to the [[Americas]], [[Eurasia]], and [[Africa]], and have been introduced to [[Australia]]. The earliest known squirrels date from the [[Eocene]] and are most closely related to the [[mountain beaver]] and to the [[dormouse]] among living rodent families. 
 
 Most squirrels are [[omnivore]]s; they eat anything they find.  Many kinds of squirrels live in trees, so they often find [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. They eat [[Seed|seeds]], [[Berry|berries]], and [[Pine cone|pine cones]] too. Sometimes they eat [[Bird|bird's]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[Insect|insects]]. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels do not store food. They [[hibernation|hibernate]] which means they spend winter in a deep sleep.  
 
 Squirrels have many [[predator]]s or enemies. Their predators are [[Fox|foxes]], [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Coyote|coyotes]], [[Bear|bears]], [[Raccoon|raccoons]], [[lynx|lynxes]], [[Puma|cougars]], [[Weasel|weasels]], [[Cat|cats]], [[Dog|dogs]], [[Badger|badgers]], [[Snake|snakes]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].  
 
 == Tree squirrels == 
 The most common European squirrels are red or brown in color, while common American squirrels are grey or black. Grey squirrels have been introduced from America into Europe (most notably, [[Great Britain]]).  
 
 The greys carry a [[virus]] to which they are [[immune]], but which is deadly to red squirrels. < ref > BBC 3003. Virus threatens UK's red squirrels. BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2829015.stm] < /ref >  They have taken over most of the red squirrels' territory in [[deciduous forest]]. This has greatly reduced the red squirrel's [[population]]. Red squirrels still enjoy dominance in the [[pine]] forests of northern Britain, but they are now rare in southern areas. 
 
 The grey squirrel is regarded as [[vermin]]. It is illegal to release any into the wild, and any caught have to be humanely killed. < ref name= " urlCaptured squirrels live to nibble again | The Times " > {{cite news

 === Life cycle === 
 Squirrels breed in February and March in winter, and in June and July in summer. Females may become pregnant up to twice a year. Usually four to six young are born, after a [[gestation]] period ([[pregnancy]]) of around thirty-nine days. Only the mother looks after the young, which are born completely helpless. Young squirrels are deaf and blind during the first few weeks of their life.  
 
 Most squirrels die in the first year of life. Adult squirrels can have a lifespan of five to ten years in the wild. Some can survive 10 to 20 years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]]. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Thorington|first1=Richard W.|last2=Koprowski|first2=John L.|last3=Steele|first3=Michael A.|last4=Whatton|first4=James F.|year=2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/squirrelsofworld0000unse/page/12 12]|title=Squirrels of the World|url=https://archive.org/details/squirrelsofworld0000unse|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-1421404691}} < /ref >
