A '''saprophyte''' or '''saprotroph''' is an organism which gets its energy from dead and decaying organic matter. This may be decaying pieces of plants or animals. This means that saprophytes are [[heterotroph]]s. They are consumers in the food chain.  
 
 This is the typical life-style of [[fungus|fungi]]. Some fungi are [[parasites]] on living organisms, but most are saprophytes. Many [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] are also saprophytes. Most dead organic matter is eventually broken down and used by bacteria and fungi. [[Slime moulds]] are also saprophytes, as well as consuming bacteria. Examples of saprophytes are cheese mold, and yeast. The term  " saprophyte "  refers specifically to fungal and bacterial saprotrophs; animal saprotrophs are known as saprozoites. 
 
 Other terms, such as 'saprotroph' or 'saprobe' may be used instead of saprophyte. Strictly speaking, -phyte means 'plant'. The problem is that no [[embryophytes]] (land plants) are true saprotrophs, and bacteria and fungi are no longer considered plants. Nevertheless, saprophyte is such a well-known term that most writers continue to use it. 
 
 == Myco-heterotrophy == 
 A [[heterotroph]] is a general term for an organism that needs organic material to get its [[carbon]] for growth and development. Many plants which lack [[chlorophyll]] need fungi to break down organic material for them. Traditionally, they were called saprophytes. Now the process is given a new name: [[myco-heterotrophy]].
