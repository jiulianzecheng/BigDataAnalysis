 ==Lucifer as Devil character of the Bible== 
 Lucifer is the epitome of [[Devil|evil]] in the [[Christian]] religion. Lucifer is believed by some to be Satan's name when he was still an [[angel]], but it is [[Latin]] for 'light bringer' and not originally in the [[Bible]].  
 The word ''Lucifer'' was also used in Latin to mean the  " morningstar " , the planet [[Venus]], and this word was used in the Latin version of Isaiah 14, where the Hebrew version was speaking to a [[king]] of [[Babylonia]].
