 {{Commonscat}} 
 '''Lollipops''', '''pops''', or '''lollies''' are sweet [[Candy|candies]] you can lick or suck on. There are many flavours of lollipops, including [[fruit|fruits]] to soft [[Soft_drink|drinks]]. In [[Europe]], especially the Nordic countries, [[Germany]] and the Netherlands, [[salt]]y-[[liquorice]] or [[salmiak]] ({{lang-fi|salmiakki}}) flavoured lollipops are also available, but these are largely unknown in other parts of the world. With a lot of companies making lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. They range from small ones which can be bought by the hundred and are often given away for free at [[Bank|banks]], [[Barber|barbershops]], etc., to very large ones made out of candy [[Candy_cane|canes]] twisted into a circle. There are also bacon flavored lollipops. 
 
 Some lollipops contain fillings, such as [[bubble gum]] or soft candy.  
 
 Some lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion.
