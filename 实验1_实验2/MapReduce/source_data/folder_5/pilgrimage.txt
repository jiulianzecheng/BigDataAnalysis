The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] this way:{{quote|To go on pilgrimage is not simply to visit a place to admire its treasures of nature, art or history. To go on pilgrimage really means to step out of ourselves in order to encounter God where he has revealed himself, where his grace has shone with particular splendour and produced rich fruits of conversion and holiness among those who believe. Above all, [[Christians]] go on pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]], to the places associated with the Lord’s passion, death and resurrection. They go to Rome, the city of the martyrdom of [[Peter and Paul]], and also to [[Compostela]], which, associated with the memory of Saint James, has welcomed pilgrims from throughout the world who desire to strengthen their spirit with the Apostle’s witness of faith and love. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2010/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20101106_cattedrale-compostela.html|title=Apostolic Journey to Santiago de Compostela and Barcelona: Visit to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (November 6, 2010) - BENEDICT XVI|website=w2.vatican.va}} < /ref > }}
