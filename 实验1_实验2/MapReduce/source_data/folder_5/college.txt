 '''College''' is an educational school where people go to learn and earn an [[academic degree]] upon [[graduation]]. The requirement to enter college is different in different countries, but in most countries, the student must have a [[high school diploma]] or equivalent (in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], a [[General Educational Development|GED]]). 
 
 Most college students begin their academic careers at 18 years old, the same age when most people graduate from high school. Though, colleges and universities have no maximum age so anyone can study or finish their studies at any time they decide they want. 
 
 In some countries, for example the [[United Kingdom]], ''college'' also means a house belonging to a [[university]], where students and teachers live together. 
 
 In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], college students begin as [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate students]] in which they will declare a major in which students specialize in an academic discipline (for example, [[Psychology]], [[Biology]], [[English literature|English]], [[Mathematics]], and [[Economics]]) and they will take classes that will expose them to the skills they need to do their careers. They also take general education classes which includes courses in reading, research, literature, a math course (for example,  College Algebra, Pre-Calculus, or Statistics), a science course, and others (though this will vary by the college). 
 
 Upon successful completion of all required courses, students will earn a [[Bachelor's degree]] which they may either go to work with the degree or continue studying for a higher-level degree. Students who have a bachelor's degree and choose to continue college are considered [[Graduate school|graduate students]], where they take more classes that are more in-depth to the student's academic discipline and qualify them for higher paying careers, earn a promotion, or become college [[professor]]s. Students may also attend [[medical school]] to become [[physician]]s or [[law school]] to become [[lawyer]]s.
