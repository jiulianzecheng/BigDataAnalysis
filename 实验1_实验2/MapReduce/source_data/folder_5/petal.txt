[[File:yellow tulip.JPG|thumb|250px|right|This [[tulip]] has many petals (''yellow'')]] 
 
 A '''petal''' is a coloured part of a [[flower]]. With bright colours and scent, they often bring [[insects]] and [[birds]] to [[pollinate]] the flowers. Petals are made of [[cellulose]] and other organic matter.  
 
 Petals are modified [[leaves]] which surround the reproductive parts of flowers. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a '''corolla'''.  
 
 The role of petals and the evolution of flowers is an important part of botany. It has been studied from the 18th century to the present day. < ref > Darwin, Charles 1877.

 The most common types of [[pollination]] are: 
 #Wind pollination: flowers are small and dull, with little or no scent, and often no petals at all. They produce large amounts of pollen which is [[wikt:scatter|scattered]] by the wind. 
 #Insect pollination: flowers show well in the [[ultraviolet]] range, and often have [[honey guide]]s. These are lines leading from the petal to the [[nectar]]. Use of [[scent]] is also common. 
 #Bird pollination: large, colourful flowers with nectar.
