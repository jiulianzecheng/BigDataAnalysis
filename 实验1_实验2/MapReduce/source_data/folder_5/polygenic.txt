'''Polygenic''' is a common [[adjective]] in [[genetics]]. It means  " many genes " . It is used when a genetic character ([[phenotypic]] [[trait]]) depends on more than one [[gene]].  
 
 It is very common and normal for a person's weight, for example, to depend on many causes, both genetic ([[inherited]]) and non-genetic (e.g. way of life). Here the use of polygenic means that various genes influence the weight of a person, as well as the non-genetic factors ([[life-style]]). The branch of genetics which studies polygenes is called [[quantitative genetics]].
