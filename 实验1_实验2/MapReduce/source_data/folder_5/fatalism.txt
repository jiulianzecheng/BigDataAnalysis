'''Fatalism''' is an idea in [[philosophy]].  It can mean one of two things. First, it can be the idea that people do not have [[free will]] to make their own choices, that everything has already been decided in advance.  This is called [[fate]]. There are a few reasons people think this.  For example, some people think free will can't exist if God knows the future. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Zagzebski |first1=Linda |title=Foreknowledge and Free Will |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=29 October 2021}} < /ref >  and believing in [[determinism]], that certain starting things cause other things later.  For example, [[geographic determinism]] is the idea that the part of the world where a person lives determines certain things about his or her later life. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Rice |first1=Hugh |title=Fatalism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/fatalism/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=18 December 2002 |accessdate=29 October 2021}} < /ref >  The second idea is that people, when faced with something that they don't think they can stop, accept the event rather than try to stop it. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Other Nietzsche|url=https://archive.org/details/othernietzsche0000stam|last=Stambaugh|first=Joan|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1994|isbn=9781438420929|pages=[https://archive.org/details/othernietzsche0000stam/page/81 81], 53}} < /ref >  The first idea is related to [[determinism]] and [[religion]]. The second idea is related to [[psychology]].
