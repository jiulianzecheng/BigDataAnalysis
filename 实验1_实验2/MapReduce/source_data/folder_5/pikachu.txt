 [[Ryan Reynolds]] voiced Pikachu in the 2019 movie ''[[Pokémon: Detective Pikachu]]''. 
 
 == Pichu == 
 Pichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but is not as powerful as Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy, such as loving its trainer. There are special forms of Pichu: a notched-ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pokémon in the ''[[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver]]'' games. Pichu has appeared as an unlockable character in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' where it has a cloned moveset to Pikachu's but takes damage when it uses electric attacks. < ref name=melee/ >  Pichu features in the intro of the third Pokémon movie. 
 
 In the anime episode ''Enter Pikachu'', Ash's Pikachu was born as a Pichu and was raised by Kangaskhan (a Pokémon that looks like a [[kangaroo]]). After he became too big for Kangaskhan to raise, Pichu ran away and evolved into Pikachu. 
 
 ==Raichu== 
 Raichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In Alola, it can evolve into Alolan Raichu by using a Thunderstone in Alola. It is a Psychic/Electric type. In the Pokémon anime, in Kanto, Gym Leader Lt. Surge's Raichu has a battle with Ash's Pikachu. At first, Raichu wins, but Pikachu beats it in a rematch.
