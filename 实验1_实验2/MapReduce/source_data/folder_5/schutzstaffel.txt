 '''The Schutzstaffel''' ( {{Audio|De-Schutzstaffel.ogg|'''''Schutzstaffel''''' }} ('''SS''') or better known as the SS was a large [[wikt:security|security]] and [[military]] [[wikt:organization|organization]] controlled by the [[NSDAP|National Socialist German Workers Party]] ([[Nazi Party]]) in [[Germany]].  " SS "  was sometimes written in [[Runes|Runic]] as [[File:Schutzstaffel SS.png|23px|Runic 'SS']], and this [[symbol]] was put on the SS flag and [[insignia]]. It was formed in 1925 in [[Weimar Germany]] or better known as the [[Weimar Republic]] . In 1934 the SS became powerful after the execution of the head of the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) leader [[Ernst Röhm]] in [[Night of the Long Knives]] . 
 
 The SS played a major part in [[The Holocaust]]. For example, they ran the Nazi [[labor camp]]s and [[death camp]]s, where they killed [[Holocaust victims|millions of people]]. After [[World War II]], [[judge]]s at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] ruled that the SS was an [[illegal]] [[criminal]] organization. The judges also said that the SS was the organization that had done most of the Holocaust. 
 
 ==The SS is created== 
 
 The SS was created in the 1925 to guard Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]]. (''Schutzstaffel'' means  " Protection [[Squadron]] "  in [[German language|German]]). < ref name=sshx > {{cite book | last = Weale | first = Adrian |title = The SS: A New History | year = 2010 | publisher = Little, Brown | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4087-0304-5 }} < /ref > < sup > pp. & nbsp;26–29 < /sup >  From 1929 to 1945, [[Heinrich Himmler]] led the SS. During that time, the SS grew from a small [[paramilitary]] unit to one of the largest and most powerful [[wikt:organization|organizations]] in Nazi Germany. < ref name=sshx/ > < sup > p. & nbsp;47 < /sup > 
 
 The Nazis saw the SS as a special unit, like the [[Praetorian Guard]] (which used to guard [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]]s). < ref > {{cite book | last = Höhne | first = Heinz |title = The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS | publisher = Penguin | location = New York | year = 2001 |pages=136–137 | isbn = 978-0-14139-012-3 }} < /ref >  To be chosen for the SS, a person had to be [[Race (sociology)|racially]]  " [[wikt:pure|pure]] " .

 ==Parts of the SS== 
 
 The SS had two different parts. The ''Allgemeine-SS'' ( " General SS " ) were the Nazis' [[police]]. The ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' ( " Armed SS " ) were special [[Military unit|units]] of [[soldier]]s in [[Wehrmacht|Nazi Germany's military]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Flaherty | first = T. H. | title = The Third Reich: The SS | publisher = Time-Life | year = 2004 | origyear = 1988 | isbn = 1-84447-073-3 | page=156 }} < /ref >  The Waffen-SS became known for fierce fighting and [[wikt:brutality|brutality]] against [[wikt:civilian|civilians]] and [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Its units helped crush the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], where [[Poles|Polish]] [[Jew]]s tried to fight back against the Nazis. < ref > {{cite web | last = Stroop | first = Jürgen | title = The Stroop Report: The Warsaw Ghetto is no more | year = 1943 | work = Jewish Virtual Library | url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nowarsaw.html }} < /ref >  Waffen-SS units also killed many American prisoners of war during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in 1944. < ref > {{cite book | last1 = Murray | first1 = Williamson | last2 = Millett | first2 = Allan R. | title = A War To Be Won: Fighting the Second World War | publisher = Harvard University Press |page=468 | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-67400-680-5 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal  | last = Reynolds | first = Michael | title = Massacre At Malmédy During the Battle of the Bulge | journal = World War II Magazine |date=February 2003 | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | jstor =  | url = http://www.historynet.com/massacre-at-malmedy-during-the-battle-of-the-bulge.htm }} < /ref > 
 
 The SS was [[Militarism|militaristic]] but not military. It had its own [[wikt:rank|rank]] system, [[insignia]], and uniforms. This made the SS different from the German military, the Nazi party, and people who worked in the German [[government]]. < ref > {{cite book | last1= Laqueur | first1=Walter | last2 = Baumel | first2 = Judith Tydor | year = 2001 | title = The Holocaust Encyclopedia | url= https://archive.org/details/holocaustencyclo00baum | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven; London |page=[https://archive.org/details/holocaustencyclo00baum/page/604 604] | isbn = 978-0-30008-432-0 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==The SS gains power== 
 
 As the Nazi party gained more and more power in Germany, it gave control of more important jobs (like [[Police officer|law enforcement]]) to the SS. Many SS organizations became as powerful as parts of the government. The Nazi party decided that to help it keep its power, it needed to give the SS two even more important jobs. One of these was to create and run the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (''SD''), the Nazi security and [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] service. The other was to control the [[Gestapo|''Geheime Staatspolizei'']] (''Gestapo''): the SS [[secret police]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Lumsden | first = Robin | title = A Collector's Guide To: The Allgemeine–SS | year = 2002 | publisher = Ian Allan | location = Shepperton, Surrey |pages=80–84 | isbn = 0-7110-2905-9 }} < /ref >  Because it was in charge of so many important things, the SS could do almost anything it wanted. < ref > {{cite book  | editor1-last = Dear | editor1-first = Ian | editor2-last = Foot | editor2-first = M.R.D. | year = 1995 | title = The Oxford Guide to World War II | publisher = Oxford University Press | place = Oxford; New York |page=815 | isbn = 978-0-19534-096-9 }} < /ref >

 ==Role in the Holocaust== 
 {{See also|The Holocaust|Final Solution}} 
 
 As the SS's leader, [[Heinrich Himmler]] used the SS to put the [[Final Solution]] into action. < ref > {{cite book | last = Rummel | first = Rudolph | title = Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder | publisher = Transaction | location = New Brunswick, NJ | year = 1992 | page=12 |isbn = 1-56000-004-X }} < /ref >  The SS [[Einsatzgruppen]] [[Mass murder|murdered many]] civilians, mostly Jews, in the countries controlled by Nazi Germany during [[World War II]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Bessel | first = Richard | title = Nazism and War | publisher = Modern Library | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-81297-557-4 |pages=118–119 }} < /ref >  The SS was in charge of creating and running [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[death camp]]s (camps where people were sent to be killed). < ref > {{cite book | last = Hilberg | first = Raul | year = 1985 | title = The Destruction of the European Jews | url = https://archive.org/details/destructionofeu00hilb | publisher = Holmes  &  Meier | location = New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/destructionofeu00hilb/page/222 222] | isbn = 0-8419-0910-5 }} < /ref >  In these camps, millions of [[prisoner]]s died from many causes, including murder, [[starvation]], [[disease]], [[Hypothermia|freezing to death]], and being [[experiment]]ed on by Nazi doctors like [[Josef Mengele]]. 
 
 ==After the war== 
 {{See also|Nuremberg Trials}} 
 After the war, the judges at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] decided the SS was a criminal organization (a group that was created only to commit [[crime]]s). They ruled that the SS had committed [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]. They also said that the SS was the organization that had carried out most of the Holocaust. < ref > {{cite book |author=Office of the United States Chief of Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality |date=1946 |title=Nazi Conspiracy  &  Aggression |url=https://archive.org/details/naziconspiracyag05unit|location= |publisher=Government Printing Office |page= |isbn=}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | last = Stein | first = George H. | title = The Waffen SS: Hitler's Elite Guard at War, 1939–1945 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, NY | year = 1984 |pages=258–263 |isbn = 0-8014-9275-0 }} < /ref >

He specialized in building larger gas chambers that killed more people than previous efforts in the extermination program. At the conclusion of Operation Reinhard, Lambert was posted to Trieste, where he continued to participate in genocide by installing cremation facilities at the concentration camp Risiera di San Sabba. After the war, Lambert was arrested on 28 March 1962. At the First Treblinka Trial in 1965, Lambert was tried for the first time and sentenced to four years imprisonment for aiding and abetting the murder of at least 300,000 people. Having already served this time, he was allowed to live as a free man. At the Sobibor Trial in 1966, Lambert was acquitted. At the trials Lambert denied involvement in the killing operation and claimed that he merely suspected that the buildings would be used for killing. Died on 15 October 1976.
