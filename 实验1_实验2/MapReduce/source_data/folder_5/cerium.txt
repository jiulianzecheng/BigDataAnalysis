'''Cerium''' is a chemical [[Chemical element|element]] with an [[atomic number]] of 58. This means that the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] of cerium has 58 [[protons]] in it. The [[atomic mass]] of cerium is 140.12. The [[chemical symbol]] of cerium is '''Ce''' and it is a member of the [[lanthanide]] group. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Cerium is a grey, shiny or [[lustrous]] [[metal]]. At [[room temperature]] cerium is a [[solid]]. It melts and becomes a [[liquid]] at 798 < sup > o < /sup > C and boils and becomes a [[gas]] at 3424 < sup > o < /sup > C. It burns in air to form a compound with one cerium atom and two [[oxygen]] atoms. 0.0046% of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] is cerium which means that it is quite common - more common than [[Tin]] and [[Lead]] and nearly as common as [[zinc]] 
 
 == Discovery == 
 Cerium was first found in Sweden in 1803 by Berzelius and Hisinger and Klaproth in [[Germany]]. Because it is very reactive, it was not purified until 1875 in [[Washington DC]]. Cerium was named after the [[asteroid]] or minor planet [[Ceres_(dwarf_planet)|Ceres]] which was first seen two years earlier in 1801. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Cerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes. Its most common use is as the 'flint' in a lighter, because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal. Cerium is sometimes used in [[alloy]]s because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant. Cerium is also used in special glass, ceramics and self-cleaning ovens. 
 
 == Oxidation == 
 Cerium reacts in two ways to produce '''cerous''' [[Chemical compound|compound]]s or [[salt]]s and '''ceric''' compounds. Cerous salts have an [[oxidation]] number of 3 and ceric salts have an oxidation of 4. 
 
 == Isotopes == 
 Cerium has many [[isotopes]]. Four of them are found in nature instead of having to be made,  
 * Cerium-136 which has 58 protons and 78 neutrons in its nucleus and is [[radioactive]] 
 * Cerium-138 which has 58 protons and 80 neutrons and is stable 
 * Cerium-140 which has 58 protons and 82 neutrons and is stable 
 * Cerium-142 which has 58 protons and 84 neutrons and is radioactive. 
 Cerium-140 (88.5% of all cerium) and Ce-142 (11.1%) are the most common. The average of the weights of each isotope is what give cerium its atomic mass of 140.12.
