 '''Stuxnet''' is [[cyber weapon]] and [[computer worm]]. It was used to sabotage [[Iranâ€™s nuclear program]] with what would seem like a long series of unfortunate accidents. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/stuxnet-was-work-of-us-and-israeli-experts-officials-say/2012/06/01/gJQAlnEy6U_story.html|title=Stuxnet was work of U.S. and Israeli experts, officials say|author=Ellen Nakashima|date=2 June 2012|work=Washington Post}} < /ref >  It was first released in 2006. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-cyberattack-iran-idUSTRE7B10AV20111202 |title=Factbox: Cyber warfare expert's timeline for Iran attack |date=2 December 2011 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=20 October 2015 |archive-date=26 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126042900/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-cyberattack-iran-idUSTRE7B10AV20111202 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It became known only after the release of the second version. < ref name=KelleyBTI > {{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stuxnet-was-far-more-dangerous-than-previous-thought-2013-11 |title=The Stuxnet Attack On Iran's Nuclear Plant Was 'Far More Dangerous' Than Previously Thought |author=Michael B Kelley |date=20 November 2013 |publisher=Business Insider Inc. |access-date=20 October 2015}} < /ref >  In 2010, an error in the [[code]] led the [[virus]] to spread outside the test labs and infect computers [[worldwide|around the world]]. < ref name=SchwartzIWNC/ >

 Stuxnet targets [[Programmable logic controller|PLCs]]. They control [[machinery]] on [[factory]] [[assembly line]]s, [[Theme park|amusement rides]], or [[centrifuge]]s for separating [[Nuclear fuel|nuclear material]]. Stuxnet works by targeting machines using the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system and [[network]]s. It then looks for [[Siemens]] Step7 [[software]]. Stuxnet reportedly compromised [[Iran]]ian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. < ref > {{cite web|last=Kushner|first=David|title=The Real Story of Stuxnet|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-real-story-of-stuxnet/|work=ieee.org|publisher=IEEE Spectrum|access-date=25 March 2014}} < /ref >  Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. < ref name=KelleyBTI/ > 
 
 Stuxnet is typically introduced to the target environment via an infected [[USB flash drive]]. The worm then spreads across the network, scanning for Siemens Step7 software on [[computer]]s controlling a PLC. If it doesn't find a target, Stuxnet becomes [[wikt:dormant|dormant]] inside the computer. 
 
 Stuxnet is special for different reasons: 
 # It used flaws of the operating system Microsoft Windows which were not known to many people at the time. 
 # It used stolen [[digital signature]]s to install the rootkit. 
 # The authors had in-depth knowledge of the process visualization system WinCC, which is used to monitor and control technical processes, using the [[SIMATIC|Simatic]] S7 industrial controller 
 # It uses another rootkit to infect the computers which ruin the control and monitoring software for the industrial board 
 
 Even though it targeted PLCs only very few were infected. The software is written to infect a specific set of PLC, with well-defined modules. In the case of a personal computer, it will infect any computer running the right software.
