 A '''voice''' is used when a person [[Speech|speaks]] or [[singer|sings]]. It describes human communication, rather than that of animals.  
 
 The [[sound]] of the voice is carried by the air, and can be heard. A vocal sound is made when air is passed over the [[vocal cords]], so making a meaningful sound. If a person has no voice, the condition is called [[muteness]].  
 
 The [[music]]al part of a [[song]] that is sung by a person using their voice is called '''vocals'''.  
 
 Many [[terrestrial animal]]s make sounds, especially those that are [[vertebrate]]s. By extension, this might be called their voice, but another term is  " animal sounds " . That includes a wider range of noises which animals may produce.
