 An '''organism''' is an individual [[Life|living]] thing. It is easy to recognize a living thing, but not so easy to define it. [[Animal|Animals]] and [[Plant|plants]] are organisms, obviously. Organisms are a [[biotic]], or living, part of the [[environment]]. Rocks and sunshine are parts of the non-living [[environment]]. 
 
 Organisms usually have six basic needs to continue their [[metabolism]]. They need [[air]], [[water]], [[nutrient]] ([[food]]), [[energy]], a place to live, and [[Homeostasis|homeostatsis]] (being able to maintain itself). However, not all living things need all these at the same time. Some organisms do not need access to air at all. 
 
 The characteristics of living things are if they have cells, take and use energy, grow and develop, share similar chemicals, sense and resond to change (stimulus), and if they reproduce. 
 
 A little thought is needed about [[viruses]]. There is no agreement as to whether they should be regarded as living. They are made of [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]], and they [[Evolution|evolve]], which is a really important fact. However, they exist in two quite different phases. One phase is [[Dormancy|dormant]], not active. The other is inside a living [[cell]] of some other organism. Then the virus is very active reproducing itself. Consider the parallel with a [[computer program]]. When in use it is active; when it is not, it is completely inactive. It is still a program all the same. 
 
 Another example from biology is the [[spore]], which is a distribution phase of a [[bacteria]], [[fungus]] or some plants. They are not active until they get to the right situation. They have all the working parts to build a complete organism, but for the moment it is switched off. 
 
 Some organisms are made up of millions of [[Cell|cells]]. They are [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]]. Many can be seen without using a microscope. 
 
 Most organisms are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. You need a [[microscope]] to see them. They are called [[Microorganism|microorganisms]]. Organisms can be made up of just one cell. They are called ''[[Unicellular organism|unicellular organisms]]'' or ''single celled organisms''. Examples include [[bacteria]], and [[protozoa]] such as the ''[[Amoeba]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''.

 Most organisms are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. You need a [[microscope]] to see them. They are called [[Microorganism|microorganisms]]. Organisms can be made up of just one cell. They are called ''[[Unicellular organism|unicellular organisms]]'' or ''single celled organisms''. Examples include [[bacteria]], and [[protozoa]] such as the ''[[Amoeba]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 The [[Tree of life (biology)|Tree of Life]] project works on the relationships between living things. Identifying a [[LUCA]] (last universal common ancestor) is one of its main aims. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.8 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] years ago (sometime in the [[Palaeoarchaean]] [[era]]). < ref > {{Citation|last=Doolittle|first=W.F.|title=Uprooting the tree of life|url=http://shiva.msu.montana.edu/courses/mb437_537_2005_fall/docs/uprooting.pdf|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=282|issue=6|pages=90–95|year=2000|postscript=.|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5w9oPfm4a?url=http://shiva.msu.montana.edu/courses/mb437_537_2005_fall/docs/uprooting.pdf|bibcode=2000SciAm.282b..90D|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90|pmid=10710791|archive-date=2011-01-31|accessdate=2013-06-06|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Citation|last1=Glansdorff|first1=N.|title=The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner|journal=Biology Direct|volume=3|issue=|pages=29|year=2008|postscript=.|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-3-29|pmc=2478661|pmid=18613974|last2=Xu|first2=Y|last3=Labedan|first3=B. |doi-access=free }} < /ref >

 An '''organism''' is an individual [[Life|living]] thing. It is easy to recognize a living thing, but not so easy to define it. [[Animal|Animals]] and [[Plant|plants]] are organisms, obviously. Organisms are a [[biotic]], or living, part of the [[environment]]. Rocks and sunshine are parts of the non-living [[environment]]. 
 
 Organisms usually have six basic needs to continue their [[metabolism]]. They need [[air]], [[water]], [[nutrient]] ([[food]]), [[energy]], a place to live, and [[Homeostasis|homeostatsis]] (being able to maintain itself). However, not all living things need all these at the same time. Some organisms do not need access to air at all. 
 
 The characteristics of living things are if they have cells, take and use energy, grow and develop, share similar chemicals, sense and resond to change (stimulus), and if they reproduce. 
 
 A little thought is needed about [[viruses]]. There is no agreement as to whether they should be regarded as living. They are made of [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]], and they [[Evolution|evolve]], which is a really important fact. However, they exist in two quite different phases. One phase is [[Dormancy|dormant]], not active. The other is inside a living [[cell]] of some other organism. Then the virus is very active reproducing itself. Consider the parallel with a [[computer program]]. When in use it is active; when it is not, it is completely inactive. It is still a program all the same. 
 
 Another example from biology is the [[spore]], which is a distribution phase of a [[bacteria]], [[fungus]] or some plants. They are not active until they get to the right situation. They have all the working parts to build a complete organism, but for the moment it is switched off. 
 
 Some organisms are made up of millions of [[Cell|cells]]. They are [[Multicellular organism|multicellular organisms]]. Many can be seen without using a microscope.
