 The '''furcula''' ( " little fork "  in [[Latin language|Latin]]) is commonly called the '''wishbone'''. It is a forked bone in birds and 
 some [[extinct]] [[dinosaurs]]. 
 
 It is a [[strut]] between a bird's shoulders, and connects to each of the bird's [[scapula]]e (shoulder blades). A strut is a structure which resists [[compression]] (pushing together) along its length. 
 
 It is formed by the fusion of the two [[clavicle]]s (shoulder blades). In birds, its main function is to strengthen the [[Thorax|thoracic]] [[skeleton]] to withstand the forces of [[flight]]. 
 
 [[X-ray]] films of [[starling]]s in flight have shown that the furcula expands when the wings are pulled downward, and snaps back as they are raised. Acting like a spring, the furcula stores some of the energy generated by contraction of the breast muscles. Then it releases the energy during the upstroke as the furcula snaps back to the normal position. This, in turn, draws the shoulders toward the midline of the body. < ref name= " Manual " > {{cite book| last1 = Proctor | first1 = Noble S. |last2 = Lynch |first2 = Patrick J.| title = Manual of ornithology: avian structure and function | location = | publisher = Yale University Press |date=1998| page = 214| isbn = 0-300-07619-3 }} < /ref > 
 
 Surprisingly, the furcula is not essential for flying, and there are a number of birds which can fly well, but have a reduced furcula, or none at all. 
 
 Several groups of [[theropod]] dinosaurs had furculae. < ref > Currie, Philip J.; Padian, Kevin 1997. ''Encyclopedia of dinosaurs''. Academic Press, pp. 530â€“535. {{ISBN|0-12-226810-5}} < /ref >
