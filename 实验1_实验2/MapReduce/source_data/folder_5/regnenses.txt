 The '''Regnenses''', '''Regni''' or '''Regini''' were a [[British]] [[Celts|Celt]]ic people. They were ruled by a [[king]]. Their their [[territory]] or [[kingdom]] was later a ''[[civitas]]'' of [[Roman Britain]]. Their capital was ''[[Noviomagus Reginorum]]'', known today as [[Chichester]] in modern [[West Sussex]]. < ref name=HistFil > {{cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainRegninses.htm |title=Regninses / Regni |publisher=The History Files |access-date=10 December 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 Before the [[Roman]]s [[Invasion|conquered]] Britain their [[land]] and [[Capital (city)|capital]] appear to have been part of the [[territory]] of the [[Atrebates]]. < ref name=Southern > Patricia Southern, ''The Story of Roman Bath'' (Stroud, UK: Amberley, 2012), pp. xiii–xxiii < /ref >  Possibly they were part of a [[Iron Age tribes in Britain|confederation of tribes]]. < ref name=Southern/ >  The tribe made use of [[hill fort]]s more than other tribes around them. Their location in [[south]]ern [[England]] would have made them a more [[civilized]] people. They would have had contact with Europe through trading exposing them to new ideas. 'Regninses', means  " people of the kingdom " . It is not known how they came by that name. It was recorded by the Romans but it could be a translation or a name the Romans gave them. 
 
 Their ruler was [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus]]. [[Tacitus]] said of him: {{cquote|Certain ''civitates'' were given to King Cogidubnus, who remained most loyal (to Rome) to within our own memory, following the long established custom of the Roman people of using even kings to make others slaves. < ref > Birgitta Hoffmann, ''The Roman Invasion of Britain: Archaeology Versus History'' (Barnsley, UK: Pen  &  Sword Archaeology, 2013), p. 89 < /ref > }} 
 The [[theory]] that Cogidubnus was created ''[[legatus]]'', a rank only ever given to [[Roman Senate|senators]], is based on reconstructing the damaged Chichester inscription. It would read as ''Cogidubni regis legati Augusti in Britannia'' ( " king and imperial legate in Britain " ). < ref > John Allen Moore, ''The Worship of the Roman Emperors in the Province of Britain'' (Chicago, 1903), p. 17 < /ref >  It could also be ''Cogidubni regis magni Britanniae'' ( " great king of Britain " ). < ref > Graham Webster, ''Rome Against Caratacus: The Roman Campaigns in Britain AD 48-58'' (London: Taylor  &  Francis, 2003), pp. 124–125 < /ref >
