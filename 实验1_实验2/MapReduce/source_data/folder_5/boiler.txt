 A '''boiler''' is a device used to [[heat]] [[water]] or other [[fluid]]s until it [[Boiling|boils]] or before [[boiling point]]. < ref > [https://www.vedantu.com/physics/working-of-boiler What is a Boiler?] < /ref >  The heated or [[vapor]]ized fluid is then used for various process applications, such as [[central heating]], [[power generation]], [[cooking]], and [[sanitation]].  
 
 Hot water boilers heat water for the purpose of domestic or commercial heating and hot water supply. 
 
 Steam boilers generate steam in order to power turbines for power generation and various other industrial heating applications. 
 
 ==Fuel== 
 The source of the heat for boiler can be from [[coal]], [[oil]], [[wood]], [[rejected heat]] or [[natural gas]]. 
 
 ==Types== 
 The different types of boilers find their use in different applications. < ref > [https://www.compareboilerquotes.co.uk/boiler-advice/types-of-boilers/ Different types of boilers] < /ref > 
 * [[Fire-tube boiler]] 
 * Flash boiler 
 * Flued boiler 
 * [[Water-tube boiler]] 
 * System boiler 
 * Combi boiler 
 
 ==Steam heating== 
 Where steam is required for space heating, the boiler is often called a ''steam generator''. A niche application was for heating [[railroad]] [[passenger car]]s while [[steam locomotive]]s were being phased out. The steam generator would be oil-fired on [[diesel locomotive]]s or electrically heated on [[electric locomotive]]s.  Steam heating is now uncommon on trains. Modern trains are usually heated by electric heaters.
