Hence, the protein production stops in bacteria terminating the infection. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Heidary |first1=Mohsen |last2=Ebrahimi Samangani |first2=Ahmad |last3=Kargari |first3=Abolfazl |last4=Kiani Nejad |first4=Aliakbar |last5=Yashmi |first5=Ilya |last6=Motahar |first6=Moloudsadat |last7=Taki |first7=Elahe |last8=Khoshnood |first8=Saeed |title=Mechanism of action, resistance, synergism, and clinical implications of azithromycin |journal=Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis |date=June 2022 |volume=36 |issue=6 |doi=10.1002/jcla.24427 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9169196/}} < /ref >  Azithromycin is particularly effective against the microogranisms below: < ref name= " :2 "  / >
