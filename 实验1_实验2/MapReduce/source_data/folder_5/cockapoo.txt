 A '''Cockapoo''' (also called a Spoodle or Cockerpoo) is a [[hybrid]] [[dog]]. It is a mix of an American [[Cocker spaniel|Cocker Spaniel]] and a [[Poodle]]; (in most cases the [[Miniature Poodle]] or [[Toy Poodle]]), or by breeding a Cockapoo with another Cockapoo. 
 
 The Cockapoo has been around since 1950 and the first dictionary reference was a 1960 [[Oxford English Dictionary]] citation. Because it is a mixed breed, it is not recognised by purebred kennel clubs.
