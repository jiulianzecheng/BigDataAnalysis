 The '''placekicker''', also called a '''kicker''', is the [[American football#Players|player]] in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] who is responsible for the kicking duties of [[American_football#Field_goal_.283_points.29|field goal]]s and [[American_football#Extra_point_.281_or_2_points.29|extra points]]. In many cases, the placekicker also serves as the team's [[kickoff specialist]] or, more rarely, [[punter (football)|punter]], as well. A kicker is often called the most valuable player on the [[team]]. < ref name=GilmartinBR > {{cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/41556-the-place-kicker-the-most-important-position-in-the-nfl |title=The Place Kicker: the Most Important Position in the NFL |author=Matthew Gilmartin |date=20 July 2008 |publisher=Bleacher Report, Inc/Turner Sports Network|access-date=25 December 2015}} < /ref >  This is because in many cases, he scores the most points in a game. < ref name=GilmartinBR/ >  Each time his team gets to the 35 yard line or closer, they have a chance to score 3 points. Each time their team makes a [[touchdown]], the kicker comes in to make the extra (1) point. A kicker is a member of the [[American football#Players|special teams]]. 
 
 == Job requirements == 
 To be a kicker in the NFL requires strong [[leg]]s. < ref name=BJD > {{cite web |url=http://www.bestjobdescriptions.com/sports-fitness/nfl-kicker-job-description |title=NFL Kicker Job Description |publisher=BestJobDescriptions.com |access-date=25 December 2015}} < /ref >  The kicker also needs excellent concentration and coordination. A kicker is the only member of a team who can move the ball with their feet. < ref name=BJD/ >  But the kicker is often the smallest member of the team. < ref name=BJD/ >  Probably the most important requirement is  " nerves of steel " . You have to kick the ball perfectly while being rushed by the other team.  
 
 == Hero or ? == 
 The kicker is the only player on a team who has the opportunity to score points each time he goes out on the [[American football#Field|field]]. < ref name=Bass195 > Tom Bass, ''Football Skills  &  Drills "  Second Edition (Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 2012), p. 195 < /ref >  Kickers today often use a [[soccer]]-style kick instead of a straight ahead kick. < ref name=Bass195/ >  If he makes a great kick he is a hero. If he misses he is a [[wikt:loser|chump|]]. < ref name=BJD/ >  An entire game can be won or lost by the kicker. A kicker cannot afford to miss too many field goals or they can find themselves traded off the team.
