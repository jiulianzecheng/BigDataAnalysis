 It also may be a replacement of a name or a word, that could reveal a secret or holy and sacred names to the [[Initiation|uninitiated]]. It may also be used to obscure the identity of the subject of a conversation from potential [[eavesdropper|eavesdroppers]]. A well known example for many is the replacement of ''Lord Voldemort's'' name by  " You-Know-Who "  or  " He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named "  in [[Harry Potter]]. Some euphemisms are intended to be humorous. 
 
 == Usage == 
 When a phrase is used as a euphemism, it often becomes a [[metaphor]] whose literal meaning is dropped. Euphemisms may be used to hide unpleasant or disturbing ideas, even when the literal term for them is not necessarily offensive. This type of euphemism is used in [[politics]].
