 '''Clairet''' is a type of [[France|French]] [[red wine]]. It is also known as '''Bordeaux''' after its region of ''appellation d'origine contrôlée''. This is the French system which certifies where food and drink comes from. 
 
 == History == 
 The wine from [[Bordeaux]] was a dark [[Rosé wine|rosé]] [[spice]]d drink in the [[Middle Ages]]. That's why it was called  " claret " , from the French ''clairet''. < ref > In [[French language|French]] the word ''clairet'' means pale. < /ref >  It changed to the present dry dark red in the 18th century. 
 
 == Crisis == 
 The wine industry in Bordeaux has economic problems. It faces fierce  competition from [[New World wine]]s. Also, the French drink less wine nowadays. 
 
 In 2004, exports to the U.S. dropped 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from [[Australia]] than from [[France]]. [[Chilean]] red wine is also extremely popular now. 
 
 Probably there is no single reason for these changes. Bordeaux wines are almost always blends from two or more types of [[vine]]. Many New World wines are single vine strains such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Syrah]] (Shiraz), and the white wine grapes [[Chardonnay]] and [[Sauvignon blanc]]. Bottles labelled by type of grape (and so by taste) has caught on with the public. Also, the cheaper French wines are much more expensive when exported. All wines and spirits into countries like the [[UK]] are heavily taxed. A cheap French (or Spanish or [[Italy|Italian]]) wine which might sell in at home fore under £1, will sell for £4 or more in the UK. Customers have evidently decided that wine from elsewhere is a better deal. 
 
 The situation is quite different for sophisticated Bordeaux wines. The Waitrose wine list for 2015/16 lists 11 red Bordeaux wines which sell for over £100 a bottle, and the top prices are: 
 *Château Lafite Rothschild 2007 Pauillac Premier Cru Classé: £750 per bottle 
 *Château Mouton Rothschild 2009 Pauillac Premier Grand Cru Classé: £900 per bottle. < ref > Waitrose wine, beer  &  spirits list 20015/16, p88. < /ref >
