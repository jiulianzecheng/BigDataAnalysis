[[File:Tractus intestinalis duodenum.svg|thumb|The Duodenum]] 
 The '''duodenum''' is a short section of the [[small intestine]], and is where most digestion in the small intestine takes place. It receives [[Secretion|secretions]], including [[bile]] and juice, from the [[pancreas]] and the [[liver]] through the pancreatic and common bile [[Duct|ducts]]. These secretions limit, or [[Base (chemistry)|neutralise]], the stomach [[Acid|acidity]]. Also, [[enzymes]] from the [[liver]] help to digest the food.
