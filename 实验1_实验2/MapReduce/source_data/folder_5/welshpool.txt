It is the fourth largest town in Powys, with a population of 6,664. It lies on the banks of the [[River Severn]] and is in the historic county of [[Montgomeryshire]]. It is known for its [[Georgian architecture]]. 
 
 The town is situated around 4 miles (6.4 km) from the border with [[Shropshire]] in [[England]]. Its name in the [[Welsh language]], '''Y Trallwng''', means '' " the marshy or sinking land " ''. In [[English language|English]], it was initially known as '''Pool''' but its name was changed to '''Welshpool''' in [[1835]] to differentiate it from the [[Dorset]] town of [[Poole]].

Assistance from the [[England|English crown]] (the enemies of the Gwynedd prince) restored the Wenwynwyn dynasty to their lands.
