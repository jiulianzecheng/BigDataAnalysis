 Riding '''sidesaddle''' is a type of [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]]. Sidesaddle riding uses a special [[saddle]]. This saddle allows the rider to sit 'aside' rather than 'astride' a horse. Astride means the rider's legs are opened with one leg on each side of the horse. In sidesaddle, the rider's legs are basically closed and both legs are on the same side of the horse.  Girls and women mostly ride sidesaddle. Riding sidesaddle allows them to use a [[modesty|modest]] posture while showing off their nicest [[riding habit]]s. There are two categories for competition, Junior and Senior classes.
