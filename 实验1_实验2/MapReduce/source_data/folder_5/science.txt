 '''Science''' is what we do to find out about the natural world. Natural sciences include [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], and [[physics]]. Science uses [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which are sometimes called  " formal sciences " . Natural science makes [[observation]]s and [[experiment]]s. Science produces accurate [[facts]], scientific laws and [[theories]]. < ref name=wilson > Wilson, Edward O. 1998. Consilience: the unity of knowledge.

 [[Research]] uses the [[scientific method]]. Scientific research uses [[hypotheses]] based on ideas or earlier knowledge, which can be categorized through different topics. Then those hypotheses are tested by [[experiments]]. 
 
 People who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called [[scientist]]s. Scientists [[Research|study]] things by [[sight|looking]] at them very carefully, by [[measure|measuring]] them, and by doing [[experiment]]s and [[test]]s. Scientists try to [[wikt:explain|explain]] why things act the way they do, and [[predict]] what will happen. 
 
 == Scientific method == 
 Today,  " science "  usually refers to a way of pursuing [[knowledge]], not just the knowledge itself. It is mainly about the [[phenomena]] of the material world. The Greek works into Western Europe from the 6th to 7th century B.C. revived  " [[Philosophy]] " . < ref > Oxford English Dictionary < /ref >  In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of ''[[scientific law|laws of nature]]'' such as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. And during the 19th century, the word  " science "  became more and more associated with the [[scientific method]] itself. It was seen as a way to study the natural world, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]] and [[biology]]. 
 
 It was also in the 19th century that the term ''[[scientist]]'' was created by [[William Whewell]]. He meant it to tell the difference between those who looked for knowledge on nature from those who looked for other types of knowledge. < ref > The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word  " scientist "  to 1834. < /ref > 
 
 The [[scientific method]] is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge. The main [[wikt:feature|feature]]s of the scientific method are: 
 # Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are simple, such as  " how many legs do flies have? "  and some are very deep, such as  " why do objects fall to the ground? " 
 # Next, scientists investigate the problem. They work at it, and collect facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully. 
 # Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do [[experiment]]s and collect [[data]]. 
 # Eventually, they find what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it. 
 # Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough. 
 
 === An example === 
 A famous example of science in action was the [[expedition]] led by [[Arthur Eddington]] to [[Principe Island]] in [[Africa]] in 1919. He went there to record where the stars were around the Sun during a [[solar eclipse]]. The observation of where the stars were shown that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed. In effect, the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the Sun by [[gravitation]]. This confirmed predictions of [[gravitational lensing]] made by [[Albert Einstein]] in the [[general theory of relativity]], published in 1915. Eddington's observations were considered to be the first solid proof in favour of Einstein's theory. 
 
 === Practical impacts of scientific research === 
 Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing. For example:

 == Other features of science == 
 Not everyone completely agrees about how theories should be used or updated. Some [[philosopher]]s and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being. They last as long as they are the best explanation. When theories no longer explain the data, they are removed and replaced. Or, sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than remove it, or they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually. 
 
 Science is a way to get [[knowledge]] by getting rid of what is not true. 
 
 Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they [[Observation|observe]] and [[measure]]. They [[compete]] to provide better explanations. An explanation might be [[wikt:interesting|interesting]] or [[wikt:pleasing|pleasing]], but if it does not [[agree]] with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation. 
 
 Before a scientific article is [[wikt:publish|published]], other scientists read the article. They decide whether the explanations make sense from the data. This is called [[peer review]]. After articles are published, other scientists will also check to see if the same experiments, observations or tests produce the same data again. [[Peer review]] and [[:wikt:repeating|repeating]] [[experiment]]s are the only way to be sure the [[knowledge]] is [[wikt:correct|correct]]. 
 
 Science makes [[models of nature]], [[models of our universe]], and [[medicine]]. There are many different sciences with their own names. However it is not right to say  " science says "  any one thing. Science is a process, not just the [[fact]]s and [[rules]] believed at one time.
