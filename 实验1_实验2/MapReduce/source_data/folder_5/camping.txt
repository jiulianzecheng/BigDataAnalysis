 '''Camping''' is a [[leisure]] activity, usually during summer when school children are on holiday, where people leave their homes and spend one or more nights outdoors. They may be [[tourist]]s seeking nature, adventure, or a different [[environment]]. They may sleep in a [[campervan]] or trailer, a [[tent]], or in the open air in good [[weather]]. Winter camping is less common but in some parts of the world, tents are people's homes year around. Rich people began camping for fun in the early 20th century. When more people could afford it, many more did it. 
 
 When camping, people usually prepare food to eat that is easy to make.  If they were [[hunting]] or [[fishing]], they may cook the animal or fish they caught over a campfire.   
 
 Dangers can arise, such as wild animals or illness from drinking unclean water.
