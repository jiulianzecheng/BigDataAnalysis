 '''''Amygdaloideae''''' (often incorrectly called '''Prunoideae''') is a subfamily of [[flowering plant]]s. This subfamily is placed within the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Rosaceae]]. 
 
 Since 2011 there has been a big change in how the name of this subfamily is used. Before 2011, the only plants in this subfamily were the [[stone fruit]]s such as [[plum]]s, [[peach]]es, and [[almond]]s. Now the subfamily includes all of the family [[Rosaceae]] except the subfamilies [[Rosoideae]] and [[Dryadoideae]]. Commercially important members of the Amygdaloideae include [[plum]], [[apple]], [[spiraea]], [[cherries]], [[:medlars]], and many others.
