 '''Sophene''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: ''{{transl|hy|Tsopk}}'') was a province of the [[Armenian Kingdom]] and of the [[Roman Empire]], in the southwest of the kingdom. It is currently in modern-day southeastern [[Turkey]]. < ref > The History of Rome By Theodor Mommsen, William Purdie Dickson < /ref > 
 
 According to [[Anania Shirakatsi]]'s ''Ashkharatsuyts'' ( " World Atlas, "  7th century), Tsopk was the 2nd among the 15 provinces of [[Kingdom of Armenia|Greater Armenia]]. It consisted of 8 cantons (''gavars''): Khordzyan, Hashtyank, Paghnatun, Balahovit, Tsopk (Shahunyats), Andzit, Degiq, and Gavreq (Goreq). < ref > Anania Shirakatsi, Geography < /ref > 
 
 Tsopk was part of the kingdom of [[Urartu]] in the 8th-7th cc BC. After unifying the region with his kingdom in the early 700s BC, king [[Argishtis I of Urartu]] resettled many of its inhabitants to his newly built city of [[Erebuni]] (modern day Armenian capital [[Yerevan]]). Around 600 BC, Tsopk became part of the newly emerged ancient [[Armenian Kingdom]] of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]].

 After [[Alexander the Great]]'s campaigns in 330s BC and the subsequent collapse of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], Tsopk remained part of the newly independent kingdom of Greater Armenia. In the early 200s BC, at the instigation of the Seleucid Empire, which was trying to weaken the Armenian kingdom, Tsopk, along with Commagene, split from Greater Armenia, forming the Hellenistic kingdom of Tsopk-Commagene. The kingdom was ruled by a branch of the Armenian royal dynasty of [[Orontid Dynasty|Orontids]]. Tsopk later split from the Tsopk-Commagene kingdom as well, forming an independent kingdom. 
 
 Around 200 BC, in his attempt to finally subjugate Armenia, Seleucian king Antiochus III conquered both Greater Armenia and [[Tsopk]], installing Armenian generals [[Artaxias I]] and [[Zariadres]] as governors-strategoses respectively in each kingdom. Following Antiochus' defeat by Romans at the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, both Zareh and Artashes declared themselves independent kings. Zareh and his descendants ruled the kingdom of Tsopk until it was reunified with Greater Armenia by [[Tigranes the Great]] in the 80s BC.

 Sophene later become part of the Roman Empire, and was made into a [[Roman province|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. The capital was [[Amida]] (modern [[DiyarbakÄ±r]]). Around [[54]], the province was ruled by [[Gaius Julius Sohaemus]]. < ref > Swain, Simon, ''Hellenism and Empire: Language, Classicism, and Power in the Greek World, Ad 50-250'', Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 304. < /ref >
