'''Genomics''' is the part of [[genetics]] which studies the [[genomes]] of organisms. This includes the entire [[DNA sequence]] of organisms and fine-scale genetic mapping. The field also includes studies of genes working together. < ref name= " Pevsner " > {{cite book| last = Pevsner| first = Jonathan| title = Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics| url = https://archive.org/details/bioinformaticsfu00pevs_0| year = 2009| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-0-470-08585-1 }} < /ref >  Examples are [[heterosis]], [[epistasis]], [[pleiotropy]] and other interactions between [[loci]] and [[allele]]s within the genome. 
 
 Genomics applies [[recombinant DNA]], [[DNA sequencing]] methods, and [[bioinformatics]] to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of [[genome]]s.

 The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has a somewhat broader definition: 
 : " The term  " genomics "  encompasses a broader scope of scientific inquiry associated technologies than when genomics was initially considered. A genome is the sum total of all an individual organism's genes. Thus, genomics is the study of all the genes of a cell, or tissue, at the DNA (genotype), mRNA (transcriptome), or protein (proteome) levels " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://epa.gov/osa/spc/pdfs/genomics.pdf |title=EPA Interim genomics policy |access-date=2012-09-09 |archive-date=2012-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025430/http://epa.gov/osa/spc/pdfs/genomics.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
