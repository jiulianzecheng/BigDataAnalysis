 An '''amphitheatre''' (or '''amphitheater''')  is a type of [[structure]]. It is a flat area, surrounded by an area that ascends gradually. In the ascending area, people can be seated. Today, such structures are used for presentations, but also [[Audience|spectator]] [[sport]]s. 
 
 In [[Ancient Rome]], these structures were used to entertain the population. [[Gladiator]] combats, [[Sport|athletics]] and [[execution]]s were staged there. < ref > {{cite book| last = Bomgardner| first = David Lee| title = The Story of the Roman Amphitheatre| url = https://archive.org/details/storyofromanamph0000bomg| date = October 2000| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-16593-8| page = [https://archive.org/details/storyofromanamph0000bomg/page/37 37] }} < /ref >
