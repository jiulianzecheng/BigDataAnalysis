The word '''Mah훮r훮ja''' is [[Sanskrit]] for  " great king "  or  " high king " . Many languages have borrowed the word 'Maharaja', these languages include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. Its use is mainly for important rulers. A female ruler is known as '''Maharani''' (or '''Mah훮r훮ni''') which means great queen. She can be the wife of a Maharaja or a ruler herself. 
 
 [[British India]] contained more than 600 [[princely state]]s each with its own ruler. Some states called the ruler Thakur (if the ruler were [[Hindu]]) or [[Nawab]] (if he was [[Muslim]]); there were many other titles as well. Many [[Muslim]] rulers also had the title of [[Raja]], one of the most famous being the ''Raja of [[Rajouri District|Rajouri]]'' who was a Muslim raja. Originally only rulers of large empires such as the ancient [[Maurya Empire]] and [[Gupta Empire]] were Maharajas but in later centuries even rulers of small kingdoms used the title. In 1971, the government of [[Indira Gandhi]] abolished the [[title]]s and money for all Indian rulers. However some people still claim such titles.
