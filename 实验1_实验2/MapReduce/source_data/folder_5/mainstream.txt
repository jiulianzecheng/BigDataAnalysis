 '''Mainstream''' is a term that usually refers to the common current of [[thought]] held by the [[majority]], meaning that  " mainstream "  things are those that are currently popular with ''most'' people. It is most often applied in the [[The Arts|arts]] (i.e., music, literature, and performance). This includes: 
 
 * something that is ordinary or usual; 
 * something that is familiar to most people; 
 * something that is available to the general public; 
 * something that has ties to corporate or commercial entities. 
 
 The mainstream includes all [[popular culture]], usually [[wikt:circulation|circulated]] by [[mass media]]. An example of the opposite of the mainstream is [[counterculture]]. The term is sometimes used as a negative term. In the [[United States]], Protestant [[wikt:denomination|denominations]] with a mix of conservative, moderate, and liberal [[Theology|theologies]] are sometimes referred to as  " mainstream.

 == In movies == 
 '''Mainstream movies''' can be defined as [[movie]]s that cost much to make and are created for [[profit]]. To pay the cost and make the profit they are made so very many people will want to pay to see them. They have a wide release to first run theaters. Those are [[movie theater]]s that run mostly new mainstream movies from the major [[movie studio|movie companies]]. After their time in first-run theaters, mainstream movies are sold at popular stores. [[Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]] movies are usually considered mainstream, and may also be [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s. The boundary is vague. An example of the opposite of mainstream movie is [[art film]]s. 
 
 == In literature == 
 In literature,  " mainstream "  refers to traditional realistic [[fiction]], as opposed to [[genre]] fictions such as [[science fiction]] or [[crime fiction|mysteries]]. 
 
 == In music == 
 Mainstream music refers to music that is familiar to and popular with the majority of people in their culture. For example, [[popular music]] or [[pop music]]. However, older generations often dislike the mainstream taste of the youth, and may not agree as to what is or is not mainstream. 
 
 Opposing mainstream music is the music of [[subculture]]s. These opposing subcultures exist in most genres of music and is commonly found in [[punk rock]], [[indie rock]], and [[extreme metal]], among others. In the 1960s, the music of the [[hippie]] [[counterculture]] [[wikt:simple:exemplified|exemplified]] this music. In more recent years, [[alternative rock]], such as the music of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], has managed to maintain popularity in the mainstream [[music market]] even though their music did not [[wikt:simple:conform|conform]] to mainstream standards. < ref > " Nirvana Achieves Chart Perfection! "  ''Billboard'', January 25, 1992. < /ref > 
 
 Punk rock has set itself apart from other non-mainstream genres by self-asserting an active ''anti''-mainstream [[social movement]] that resists [[commercialism]] and [[corporation|corporate control]]. The punk subculture usually does not appreciate major label bands that play punk music that denies the [[do it yourself]] (DIY) punk [[ethics|ethic]], and thinks they are the same as mainstream music. [[Indie (music)|Indie rock]] that surfaced in the early 1990s underground took this same DIY ethic. < ref > " [http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687 Explore music by Genre: Indie Rock] " . allmusic.com.

 ==Mainstream media== 
 Many anti-corporate and [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] forms of alternative [[protest]] have surfaced in the punk underground, for example, self-made publications known as  " zines " , where there is greater freedom to discuss controversial (usually [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|far left]]) political issues such as [[bigotry]], [[LGBT]] community issues, [[feminism]], [[militant atheism]], and [[veganism]]. Although the mainstream media often views this behavior as a youthful expression of rebellion, modern punk embodies a range of age groups who generally disagree with the perceived shared [[countercultur]]al principals. It is not uncommon for middle-aged people to form punk houses (houses where people of the punk subculture live and open to others to stay, including touring bands) and resistance movements against what they see as the widespread, unfair use of [[human rights|human]] and [[animal rights]] for [[profit]]. This modern group is effectively voiced through the [[anarcho-punk]] and [[crust punk]] subcultures, in attempt to fight what is seen by those groups as a general [[wikt:devalue|devaluation]] of, and way to profit from, life. 
 
 ==Mainstreaming in education== 
 Mainstreaming refers to a type of education where children with a [[learning disability]] are mixed into classes with children without learning disabilities to help them learn better and to become comfortable with the  " mainstream "  of student life and life in their [[community]]. This is normally called  " integration " . When their needs cannot be met, they must be moved to special schools.
