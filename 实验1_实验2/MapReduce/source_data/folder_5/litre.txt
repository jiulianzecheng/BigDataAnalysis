 A '''litre''' ([[International System of Units|international spelling]]) or '''liter''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|American spelling]]) is one of the [[metric system|metric units]] of [[volume]]. It is not a basic [[International System of Units|SI unit]], but it is a supplementary unit. 
 
 One litre is the volume of 1000 cubic [[centimetre]]s, that is a [[cube]] of 10 × 10 × 10 [[centimetre]]s (1000 & nbsp;cm < sup > 3 < /sup > ). One litre of [[water]] at {{cvt|4|C|K F}} has the [[mass]] of exactly one [[kilogram]]. This results from the definition given in 1795, where the [[gram]] was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice. < ref name= " decree " >

 Liters are usually utilized to measure the volume of liquids, this is because the density of liquids can vary a lot. However it can be applied to solids as well, for example 1 liter of [[Iron]] is around 7.7 & nbsp;kg. The [[symbol]] for litre is '''l''' or '''L'''. < ref name= SIborchure/ >  The script letter '''ℓ''' is also sometimes used. 
 
 For smaller volumes, the decilitre is used: 10 dl = one litre. 
 
 For smaller volumes, the centilitre is used: 100 cl = one litre. 
 
 For smaller volumes, the millilitre is used: 1000 ml = one litre. 
 
 The capital letter  " L "  is preferred by some people as the small  " l "  can look like the number one  " 1 " .

 In 1795 the kilogram was defined to be exactly one litre of water at 4 & nbsp;°C. In 1799 the kilogram was redefined. The new definition said that the kilogram was the mass of the ''[[kilogram|kilogram des archives]]''. In 1901 scientists measured the volume of one litre of water at 4 & nbsp;°C very carefully. < ref group = Note > Water has its maximum density at 4 & nbsp;°C. < /ref >  They found that it occupied about {{gaps|1.000|028}} & nbsp;dm < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref > {{cite web

 In 1960 the [[International System of Units|SI]] was introduced. The BIPM changed the definition of the litre back to  " one dm < sup > 3 < /sup > " . The litre is not part of SI. The BIPM defined the litre < ref group = Note > The [[hectare|are]] and the [[tonne]] were also defined as   " Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI " . < /ref >  as a  " Non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI " .

 According to SI rules, the symbol for the litre should be  " l " . This is because the litre was not named after somebody whose name was  " Litre " . < ref group = Note > For example, the symbol for watts is  " W "  because watts were named after [[James Watt]]. < /ref >  However the symbol  " l "  and the number  " 1 "  are easily confused.

 In Europe, [[milk]] is sold in one litre cartons. One litre bottle is also a popular package for [[soft drinks]]. Most alcoholic drinks are sold as 1/3 litre (0.33 l), {{frac|1|2}} litre (0.5 l) or 3/4 litre (0.75 l) bottles.
