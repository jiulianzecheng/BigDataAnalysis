 '''Echinoderms'''  < ref > ''Echinodermata'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for ''spiny skin'' < /ref >  are a successful [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of [[Ocean|marine]] [[animal]]s. They include [[starfish|sea stars]], [[brittle star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s and their relatives. 
 
 Echinoderms have these features: < ref name= " Clarkson " > {{cite book| author = Clarkson E.N.K. | title = Invertebrate palaeontology and evolution| url = https://archive.org/details/invertebratepala03edclar_b9l6 | year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-412-47990-8 }} < /ref > 
 # A skeleton of plates. These are formed from [[calcite]], a [[mineral]] made of [[calcium carbonate]]. The plates are usually spiny, and the skeleton is covered outside and in by a layer of skin. 
 # Five-rayed (pentameral) [[symmetry]]. 
 # A water-vascular system. This is an internal system of tubes and bladders filled with water. 
 # Tube feet. These are extensions of the water-vascular system. The tube feet poke out from the skeleton, and are used in walking, [[respiration]] and feeding. The animal handles the world outside by using its tube feet. 
 # Stenohaline. They can't handle big changes in the [[salinity]] of the water. No doubt this is why they are: 
 # Entirely [[Ocean|marine]]. 
 
 Echinoderms live in all parts of the [[ocean]], but mostly on the sea floor. Some are filter feeders, and others (starfish) are important predators of [[mollusc]]s and other shell-fish. They are extremely common near the [[shore]], and on [[reef]]s. 
 
 They have a long and abundant fossil record. This phylum appeared in the early [[Cambrian]] period; it contains about 7,000 living  and 13,000 extinct [[species]]. The four or five main groups are called sub-phyla by some authorities, and [[class (biology)|classes by others]]. 
 
 Echinodermata is the largest animal phylum which is entirely marine: no animals in this group live on land or in fresh or [[brackish water]]. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 === A modern classification === 
 * [[Starfish|Asterozoa]]: about 1,500 species that catch prey for their food. 
 ** [[Asteroidea]]: the starfish. 
 *** Sea daisies, notable for their unusual water vascular system. Only two species, now merged into Asteroidea. 
 ** Ophiuroidea ([[brittle star]]s and [[Brittle star#Basket stars|basket stars]]), the largest echinoderms; about 1,500 species. 
 * [[Crinoidea|Crinozoa]] (crinoids: the feather stars or sea lilies): about 600 species that are suspension feeders. Originally these were stalked echinoderms with long arms, rather plant-like in appearance. In this form they are called 'sea lilies'. The [[P/Tr extinction event]] almost eliminated them. Now they are reduced to a few deep-water species. The free-living 'feather stars' in shallow water are quite successful today. < ref name= " Clarkson " / > 
 * [[Blastozoa]]: the cystoids, an extinct group. They were mostly sessile and lived in shallow waters. Sometimes put together with crinoids in the subphylum Pelmatozoa. 
 * [[Sea urchin|Echinozoa]]: echinoids and sea cucumbers. 
 ** [[Echinoidea]]: [[sea urchin]]s and [[sand dollar]]s, notable for their movable spines. There are about 1,000 species. < ref > A.B. Smith's Echinoid directory (NHM) http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/echinoid-directory/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720060242/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/echinoid-directory/ |date=2013-07-20 }} < /ref > 
 ** [[Sea cucumber|Holothuroidea]] (sea cucumbers). Relatively soft-bodied animals with a [[tube]]-like shape; about 1,500 species. The usual [[calcareous]] elements in the skin are much reduced, but the skin is quite tough, and covered in [[slime]]. They have good defences against [[predator]]s. 
 * Homalozoa: an extinct group of strange early echinoderms. Some put them in the phylum [[Chordata]], and call them calcichordates. < ref > Jefferies R.P.S. 1968. The subphylum Calcichordata, primitive fossil chordates with echinoderm affinities. ''Bulletin of the British Museum Natural History (Geology)'' '''16''', 243-339. < /ref > 
 
 === A simplified classification === 
 For many purposes it is better to use the following classification. It is easier to learn and understand, and is based more on the living forms. < ref name= " Nichols " > {{cite book| author = David Nichols| title = Echinoderms| year = 1969| publisher = Ebury Press| isbn = 978-0-09-065994-4 }} < /ref > < sup > p19 < /sup > 
 
 # [[Asteroidea]]: the starfish. 
 # [[Ophiuroidea]]: the brittle-stars 
 # [[Echinoidea]]: the sea-urchins 
 # [[Holothuroidea]]: the sea-cucumbers 
 # [[Crinoidea]]: the sea-lilies and feather-stars. 
 
 Only with the crinoids is it necessary to deal with the fossil forms, because the stalked crinoids were so important on the [[Palaeozoic]] sea floors. 
 
 == General account == 
 [[File:Echinocardium cordatum (Pennant, 1777) early pluteus width ca.JPEG|thumb|right|200px|Early pluteus larva of ''Echinocardium cordatum'']] 
 All echinoderms have fivefold radial symmetry in their body at some stage of life. The holothurians have [[bilateral symmetry]] as adults, and do not have so much of a skeleton as other groups. 
 
 Echinoderms have a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] water vascular system. This network of fluid-filled canals moves and feeds the animal, and allows gas exchange. There is also a complete digestive tube. They have a simple radial [[nervous system]] that consists of a modified [[nerve]] net. There are nerve rings with radiating nerves around the mouth extending into each arm. The branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the animal. Echinoderms have no [[brain]], although some do have [[Ganglion|ganglia]]. They usually move with their tube feet, but brittle stars use their arms to pull against rocks. Some feather stars and sea cucumbers can swim. 
 
 The sexes are usually separate. [[Sexual reproduction]] typically consists of releasing eggs and sperm into the water, with fertilization taking place externally. Their [[larva]]e are [[plankton]]ic. 
 
 Many echinoderms have remarkable powers of [[regeneration]]. A starfish arm cut off will regenerate. A section as small as a single arm, with some central disk and neural tissue, can regenerate the whole organism. 
 
 === Echinoderm larvae === 
 Most of the adults have radial symmetry. If they are not [[sessile]] or attached, they are at least [[benthic]] (bottom-dwellers). In contrast, echinoderm larvae are [[plankton]]ic, and have [[bilateral symmetry]]. < ref name= " Nichols " / > < sup > p119 < /sup >  Echinoderm larvae are [[cilia]]ted free-swimming organisms that have a bilaterally symmetry rather like embryonic [[chordate]]s. The first stage in all groups except the crinoids is the '''dipleurula''', which has a row of cilia winding round its body. All the groups have second and third stage larvae. The larvae grow, and are carried away from their parents. 
 
 Later, the adult body grows into a radial form, with the body arranged in five parts around a central axis. This means they often have a star-shaped pattern. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 There is no geological evidence about the origin of echinoderms. The first undoubted [[fossil]]s in the Lower [[Cambrian]] are already well developed, and fall into five or six different groups. ''[[Arkarua]]'', from the [[Ediacaran]], is thought to be an echinoderm. ''[[Tribrachidium]]'' is another possible, from the same period. On general biological grounds, it seems that echinoderms, and some related phyla, may have been derived from worm-like ancestors. < ref name= " Clarkson " / > < sup > p311 < /sup > 
 
 Of all invertebrate phyla, the echinoderms are the closest relatives to the [[chordata]], that is, animals who have spinal cord, such as [[vertebrate]]s. With the chordates and [[hemichordate]]s, echinoderms are [[deuterostome]]s, one of the two major divisions of the animal kingdom.
