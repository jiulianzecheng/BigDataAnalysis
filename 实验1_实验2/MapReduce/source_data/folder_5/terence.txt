 '''Publius Terentius Afer''' (  < abbr > c. < /abbr >  195/185 –  < abbr > c. < /abbr >  159? BC), better known in English as '''Terence''', was an African Roman playwright.  Terentius Lucanus, a [[Roman senator]], brought Terence to Rome as a slave, educated him and then, impressed by his abilities, freed him.  He wrote simple conversational [[Latin]]. 
 
 He died, about the age of 25, likely in Greece or on his way back to Rome, 
 
 Terence's six plays are: 
 
 * ''Andria'' (''The Girl from [[Andros]]'') (166 BC) 
 * ''Hecyra'' (''The Mother-in-Law'') (165 BC, but eventually performed in 160 BC) 
 * ''Heauton Timorumenos'' (''The Self-Tormentor'') (163 BC) 
 * ''Eunuchus'' (''The [[Eunuch]]'') (161 BC) 
 * ''Phormio'' (161 BC) 
 * ''Adelphoe'' (''The Brothers'') (160 BC) < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22188|title=The Comedies of TerenceLiterally Translated into English Prose, with Notes|last=Terence|date=2007-07-31|language=English|translator-last=Riley|translator-first=Henry T.
