 A '''migraine''' is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing [[headache]] on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other [[Signs and symptoms (medicine)|symptoms]]. 
 
 Most migraines cause a headache and [[nausea]] and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have  " [[Aura (symptom)|auras]] "  before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other [[senses]] can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 & nbsp;hours. 
 
 Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called ''episodic migraine'' (EM).  If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called ''chronic migraine'' (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get ''chronic migraines'' later. Chronic migraine then may ''revert'' or go back to episodic migraine. 
 
 Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for  " calcitonin gene-related peptide " . CGRP is a [[protein]] that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the [[meninges]], a covering above the brain. 
 
 There are different [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone [[estrogen]] in their body either drops too low or ''fluctuates'' (goes up and down). 
 
 The [[World Health Organization]] says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. < ref > [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs277/en/ World Health Organisation Factsheet No 277].

 ==Types== 
 [[File:Left hemisphere throbbing.gif|thumb|180px|This is what a normal human brain looks like if a you were looking down at the top of a persons head. (''Superior view'') There are two sides called ''hemispheres''. In most migraine headaches the pain is ''unilateral'', which means it is in one hemisphere. In this case, the left hemisphere.]] 
 ===Migraine with aura=== 
 * [[Acephalgic migraine]], also called a ''silent migraine'', is a kind of migraine with aura but without the head pain. This type of migraine usually starts sometime during middle-age, which is after a person is 40 years old, and becomes more common as a person gets older. Unlike other migraines, males have acephalgic migraines more often then females do. 
 * [[Basilar-type migraine]] is a type of migraine with aura that causes headache usually in the occipital region of the brain with neurological symptoms that is believed to come from the brainstem, occipital cortex, and cerebellum and/or affects both hemispheres of the brain at the same time. Most people who have basilar-type migraine also experience migraines with aura without the basilar symptoms. This type of migraine usually more common in people under age 20 and young females. < ref > {{cite book |last= Brodsky |first= Michael C. |title= Pediatric Neuro-Ophthalmology |url= https://archive.org/details/pediatricneuroop0000brod |year= 2010 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-69066-7 |page= [https://archive.org/details/pediatricneuroop0000brod/page/218 218] }} < /ref > 
 * [[Familial hemiplegic migraine]] (FHM) is a type of migraine with aura that also may cause [[paralysis]] on one side of the body.  When the migraine stops, the person can move normally again. 
 * [[Retinal migraine]] has repeated times of vision loss in one eye, that may happen before or during a headache. People who have retinal migraines usually have a history of having one of the other more common types of migraine. < ref > {{cite book |last1= Loder |first1= Elizabeth |last2= Marcus |first2= Dawn A. |title= Migraine in Women |url= https://archive.org/details/migraineinwomen0000unse |year= 2004 |publisher= PMPH-USA |isbn= 978-1-55009-180-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/migraineinwomen0000unse/page/22 22] }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Migraine without aura=== 
 * [[Menstrual migraine]] or ''catamenial migraine'' is a type of migraine that happens ''perimenstrually'', which means around the time of menstruation during a woman's monthly menstrual cycle. Menstrual migraine is  usually a migraine without aura, but sometimes a menstrual migraine with aura happens.  About 7%-14% of women have migraines exclusively at the time of menstruation.  These are considered ''true menstrual migraines''. Most female migraneurs experience migraine attacks at all times during the menstrual cycle, with an increased number perimenstrually.  These are referred to as ''menstrually related'' or ''menstrually triggered migraine''. Both true menstrual migraines and menstrually related migraines are categorized under menstrual migraine. < ref > Robert A. Davidoff.

 ** '''The role of estrogen''' 
 ::Estrogen is a [[hormone]] that is mostly made in a woman's [[ovaries]]. There are three types of estrogen: estrone, estradiol and estriol. < ref > {{cite book |last= Berek |first= Jonathan S. |title= Berek  &  Novak's Gynecology |url= https://archive.org/details/bereknovaksgynec00bere |year= 2007 |publisher= Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins |isbn= 978-0-7817-6805-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/bereknovaksgynec00bere/page/n440 417] }} < /ref >  In women who have migraines it is usually connected with their menstruation cycle. About 60% of women have these ''[[Menstrual migraine|menstrual or menstrually-related migraines]]'' and the main trigger is believed to be reduced circulating estrogen levels, [[id est|i.e.]] the amount of estrogen in the body, specifically estradiol. In some cases, ''fluctuation'' (going up and down) in the amount of circulating estrogen levels may trigger a migraine, [[id est|i.e.]] not only too little but sometimes too much estrogen may trigger a migraine. < ref > {{cite book |author= Linda C.

 ===Childhood periodic syndromes=== 
 [[File:Abdomen-periumbilical_region.png |thumb|120px|right|Abdominal migraine causes severe pain in the ''abdomen,''.]] 
 ''Childhood periodic syndromes'' are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they become adults. 
 
 [[Abdominal migraine]] is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the ''periumbilical area''. Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, < ref > {{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= M.

 [[Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood]] (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes [[vertigo]]. 
 
 [[Cyclic vomiting syndrome]] or '''cyclical vomiting syndrome''' (CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated [[vomit]]ing. CVS happens more often in children, but it can occur at any age.

 ===Chronic vs. episodic migraine=== 
 [[File:Chronic vs episodic migraine.PNG |300px|left]] 
 Episodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine, those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability. < ref > Munakata J, Hazard E, Serrano D, ''et. al.''  " Economic burden of transformed migraine: results from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) Study " . ''Headache''. 2009 Apr; '''49'''(4): 498-508. doi: 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2009.01369.x. Epub 2009 Feb 25. PMID 19245386. < /ref >  Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and [[angina]] and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke. 
 
 About 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)

 '''[[Aura (symptom)|Aura]]''' (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of [[neurology|neurological]] symptoms that may begin before an [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]] or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as ''scotomas'' (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), [[vertigo]], a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking. < ref > Robert A.

 '''Scotoma''' (came from the Greek word for darkness: ''skotos''): a ''blind spot'' or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. [[id est|i.e.]]: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scotoma |title=scotoma |work=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=2012-12-18 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either ''absolute'' where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, ''relative'' with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma. 
 
 Scotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the ''fortification'' scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights. < ref > {{cite book| last = Anthoney| first = Terence R.| title = Neuroanatomy and the Neurologic Exam: A Thesaurus of Synonyms, Similar-Sounding Non-Synonyms, and Terms of Variable Meaning| year = 1993| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-8631-2| pages = 483–484 }} < /ref >

 In medicine a ''[[Factor (medicine)|factor]]'' is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a ''risk factor''. A ''trigger factor'' or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin. < ref > ''factor'':Segen JC. The Dictionary of Modern Medicine.  McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc retrieved December 19, 2012 < /ref > 
 
 ;'''Risk factors''' 
 * Gender: Women are three times more likely to have migraine headaches than men. 
 * Family history: A person has more of a chance of getting migraines if one of their parents has had them. The International Headache Consortium are doctors from a lot of different countries who study headaches and what causes them. They have found four ''genetic variations'' - these are differences in a persons genes - that are [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] for migraine without aura in people who have these differences. Two of these genetic variations had already been shown to play a role in migraine with aura. < ref > Freilinger T, Anttila V, de Vries B, Malik R, ''et. al.'' and International Headache Genetics Consortium.

 * Hormonal changes 
 * Obesity: has shown to be a risk factor for chronic migraine not episodic migraine. 
 ;'''Triggers''' 
 * Dietary habits: fasting, dehydration, or skipping meals. 
 * Diet: Eating certain foods such as those that contain ''tyramine'' which is found in certain foods and is the end result of the natural breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine. Various food contain tyramine such as aged cheeses, smoked fish, some kinds of beer. Tyramine as a trigger for migraine is thought to effect less than 10% of people with migraines. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Fernandez-de-las-Penas| first1 = Cesar| last2 = Chaitow| first2 = Leon| last3 = Schoenen| first3 = Jean| title = Multidisciplinary Management of Migraine| year = 2012| publisher = Jones  &  Bartlett Publishers| isbn = 978-1-4496-0050-1| page = 414 }} < /ref >

 There are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms.

 * At what age did the symptoms first start? 
 * How often do the headaches and/or other symptoms occur? 
 * How long do the symptoms last? 
 * Where is the pain? Unilateral: either left or right side of the head - bilateral: both left and right sides 
 
 ===Differential diagnoses=== 
 ''Differential diagnoses'' are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a ''final diagnosis'', which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differential%20diagnosis |title=Differential diagnosis  |first= |last=|work=Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |year=2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}} < /ref >

 Migraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The number of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older. 
 
 Between 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress. 
 
 About two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.
