 '''Kiwano''' (''Cucumis metuliferus''), also known as '''horned melon''', is a sweet tropical [[fruit]]. It is an [[Annual plant|annual]] vine in the cucumber and melon family, ''[[Cucurbitaceae]]''. It is also called  " horned melon "  since its fruit has horn-like spines. Ripe fruit has orange skin and lime green, jelly-like flesh. Kiwano is native to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. It is now grown in the United States, [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. 
 
 Kiwano is a traditional food plant in Africa. Along with the Gemsbok cucumber (''[[Acanthosicyos naudinianus]]'') and Tsamma (''[[Citron melon]]''), it is one of the few sources of water during the dry season in the [[Kalahari Desert]]. In northern [[Zimbabwe]], it is called ''gaka'' or ''gakachika''. There it is primarily used as a snack or salad, and rarely for decoration.
