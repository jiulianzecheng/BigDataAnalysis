 In [[ancient Greek]] religion, '''Nemesis''' ({{lang-grc|Νέμεσις}}), is the goddess who takes vengeance against those who show [[hubris]] (arrogance before the gods). 
 
 Divine retribution is a major theme in the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] world view. It is the unifying theme of the tragedies of [[Sophocles]] and many other literary works. < ref > Sanders, Karin.  " Nemesis of Mimesis: The Problem of Representation in H. Andersen's  " Psychen " . "  ''Scandinavian Studies'' 64, no. 1 (1992): 1-25. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40919385. < /ref > < ref > {{citation | url = http://literarydevices.net/nemesis/| title = Examples of Nemesis in Literature | date = 19 August 2013 | access-date = October 12, 2013 }} < /ref > 
 
 She carried a measuring rod (a tally stick), a [[bridle]], [[Weighing scale#Symbolism|scales]], a [[sword]], and a [[scourge]] (whip), and she rides in a [[chariot]] drawn by [[griffin]]s. 
 
 Nemesis often is seen with another goddess named [[Aidos]]. Aidos is the goddess of [[shame]]. She is similar to Nemesis. < ref > [[Homer]], [[Illiad]], 13,121f < /ref > 
 
 The Ancient Greek made different meanings for what they called  " justice " : 
 * Nemesis (as a goddess who gives to each what they deserve) 
 * [[Dike (mythology)|Dike]] (to be in charge of what we would call civil law today) 
 * [[Dikaiosyne]] ( " a just state, "  where the word justice comes from, meaning that everything is fair in their country) 
 * [[Nomos]] (a law made by the government) 
 
 In works of [[fiction]] the [[hero]]'s nemesis is usually the [[villain]] and the hardest [[antagonist]] for the [[hero]] to defeat.
