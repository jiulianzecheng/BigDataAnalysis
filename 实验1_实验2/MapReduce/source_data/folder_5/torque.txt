 In [[physics]], '''torque''' is the tendency of a [[Force (physics)|force]] to turn or twist. If a force is used to begin to [[spin (physics)|spin]] an [[object]], or to stop an object from spinning, a torque is made. 
 
 The force applied to a [[lever]], multiplied by the [[distance]] from the lever's [[:en:Fulcrum|fulcrum]], multiplied again by the [[sine]] of the angle created, is described as torque. This is also known as  " r [[cross product|cross]] f, "  or  " force times fulcrum distance times sine theta. " 
 
 == Fulcrum == 
 Fulcrum is the [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] of [[rotation]] or point of support on which a lever turns in raising or moving something. 
 
 == Equation == 
 The [[equation]] for torque is: 
 : < math > \boldsymbol \tau = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}\,\! < /math > 
 where '''F''' is the net force [[vector]] and '''r''' is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting. The [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Tau]] is used to represent torque.  
 
 The units of torque are force multiplied by distance. < ref > {{cite book|first=Steven|last=Holzner|title=Physics Essentials For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsessential0000holz|publisher=Wiley Publishing|date=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/physicsessential0000holz/page/122 122]|isbn=978-0-470-61841-7}} < /ref >  The SI unit of torque is the [[newton-metre]].  The most common English unit is the [[foot-pound]].
