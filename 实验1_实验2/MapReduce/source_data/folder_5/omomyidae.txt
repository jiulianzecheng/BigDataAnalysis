The '''Omomyidae''' are early [[primates]] that radiated during the [[Eocene]] epoch between about 55 to 34 million years ago (mya).  
 
 Fossil omomyids are found in [[North America]], [[Europe]]  &  [[Asia]]. It is one of two groups of [[holarctic]] Eocene primates with a wide distribution. < ref > Amy L. Atwater  &  E. Christopher Kirk 2018. New middle Eocene omomyines (Primates, Haplorhini) from San Diego County, California. ''Journal of Human Evolution''. < /ref >  The other group is the adapids (family [[Adapidae]]). Early representatives of the Omomyidae and Adapidae appear suddenly at the beginning of the Eocene (59 mya) in North America, Europe, and Asia. They are the earliest known crown primates, although obviously their origin was earlier, possibly much earlier.
