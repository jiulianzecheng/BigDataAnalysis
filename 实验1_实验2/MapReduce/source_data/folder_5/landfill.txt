 A '''landfill''' is a place where [[waste]] is kept. Waste is usually [[burial|buried]] in landfills, but it may first be sorted to remove any [[Recycling|recyclable]] materials. 
 
 Landfills have a bad [[odor|smell]] and look bad, therefore are usually located far away from where people live.  
 
 Once the waste is crushed into very small pieces, it is buried, but without oxygen, a dangerous gas called [[methane]] is created. This process is called [[anaerobic digestion]]. In some countries, the methane from landfills is used to generate [[energy]].
