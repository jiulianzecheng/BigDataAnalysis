 A '''skunk''' is a [[mammal]], usually black with a white stripe on its back and a fluffy [[tail]], but some skunks can be brown or gray. Its most special part is that it can shoot out a bad-[[Olfaction|smelling spray]] from under its tail; it does this to scare away things that could hurt it. Some people keep skunks as [[pets]]. 
 
 It can eat both [[plant]]s and small [[animal]]s like [[earthworms]], [[frogs]], [[snakes]], [[birds]] and [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. It usually eats [[berries]], [[leaves]], [[grasses]] and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. In places where humans live, skunks often steal food from garbage or pet bowls. 
 
 The striped skunk is the most well-known kind of skunk. It weighs 2.5 to 14 pounds (1.2–6.3 & nbsp;kg) with a body length (without the tail) of 13 to 18 & nbsp;inches (33–46 & nbsp;cm). The tail is 7 to 10 & nbsp;inches long (18–25 & nbsp;cm), and sometimes has a white tip. 
 
 Most types of skunk live in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but there are also types that live in [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]].
