 '''Tyranni''' is a [[suborder]] of [[passerine]] [[bird]]s. They are also known as the '''suboscines'''. There are about 1,000 [[species]] in this suborder. Most of them live in [[South America]]. 
 
 These birds are different to the [[passeri]] (songbirds) because they have a different syrinx. This is part of the bird's voice box which makes bird song. Scientists have also done studies on [[DNA]] and [[fossil]]s to show that the tyranni suborder is different to the passeri suborder. 
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 The tyranni suborder can be split into three infraorders: Acanthisittides, Eurylaimides, and Tyrannide. < ref > [http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/DNA.html DNA and Passerine Classification] < /ref > 
 
 The first group, the Acanthisittidae, are also known as the New Zealand  " wrens " . At the moment, scientists are unsure whether they should belong to the tyranni or not. Some scientists think they are too different and they should be in their own suborder. 
 
 The Eurylaimides contains two [[superfamily|superfamilies]]: the Eurylaimoidea and the Pittoidea. The Euryaimoidea contains three [[family_(biology)|families]]. They are also known as the [[Old World]] suboscines. Most of them live in [[tropical]] places around the [[Indian Ocean]]. One species, the Broad-billed Sapayoa, lives in the [[Americas]]. The three families are:[[Image:Pitta iris.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rainbow Pitta]] (''Pitta iris''), a dark bird with bright color patches. Most Pittidae have similar colors.]] 
 * Superfamily: Eurylaimoidea 
 ** [[Broadbill|Eurylaimidae]]: broadbills 
 ** [[Asity|Philepittidae]]: asities 
 ** [[Sapayoidae]]: Broad-billed Sapayoa 
 * Superfamily: Pittoidea 
 ** [[Pittidae]]: pittas 
 
 The Tyrannides contain all sub-oscine birds from the [[Americas]], except the Broad-billed Sapayoa: 
 * [[Furnariidae]]: ovenbirds and woodcreepers 
 * [[antbird|Thamnophilidae]]: antbirds 
 * [[Formicariidae]]: antpittas and antthrushes 
 * [[Rhinocryptidae]]: tapaculos 
 * [[Conopophagidae]]: gnateaters and gnatpittas 
 * [[Tyrannidae]]: tyrant-flycatchers 
 * [[Tityridae]]: tityras and allies 
 * [[Cotingidae]]: cotingas 
 * [[Pipridae]]: manakins
