 A '''tambourin''' (pronounced the French way) is a piece of music which was popular in [[France]] in the [[18th century]].  It is based on a folkdance from the [[Provence]].  The music is made to sound like the kind of drum which is called  " tambourin "  in French.  [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] wrote several Tambourins in his operas.  Other composers who wrote Tambourins include [[François-Joseph Gossec]] and [[Maurice Duruflé]]. 
 
 '''Tambourin''' also means a special kind of drum from the Provence.  It has a long, [[cylinder|cylindrical]] shape and is played with one drumstick.  It is found in orchestral music such as [[Georges Bizet|Georges Bizet's]] ''L'Arlésienne Suite no. 2''
