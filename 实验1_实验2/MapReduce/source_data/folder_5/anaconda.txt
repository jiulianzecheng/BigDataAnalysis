 The '''Anaconda''' or '''green anaconda''' (''Eunectes murinus'') is one of the largest [[snake]]s in the world. 
 
 It is a non-[[venomous]] [[boa]] species from [[South America]]. It is the thickest, heaviest, and second longest known living snake (behind the [[reticulated python]]). The term  " anaconda "  usually means this species. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 The anaconda is also called the water boa. It lives in [[Swamp|swampy]] areas of [[tropical]] [[South America]]. The snake spends a lot of time in shallow water. This hides it from unsuspecting [[Predation|prey]]. Anacondas give birth to live young. Twenty to forty baby snakes are born at one time. The largest specimens measured {{Cvt|17.1|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{Cvt|215|lb|kg|abbr=on}} < ref name= " Riv00 " > {{cite thesis |author=Rivas, Jesús Antonio |year=2000 |title=The life history of the green anaconda (''Eunectes murinus''), with emphasis on its reproductive Biology |degree=[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] |publisher=[[University of Tennessee]] |url=http://www.anacondas.org/diss/disser.pdf |access-date=2016-09-26 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202240/http://www.anacondas.org/diss/disser.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Hunting and diet == 
 [[File:Eunectes murinus.jpg|thumb|Green anaconda slithering in the grass]] 
 All snakes are [[Carnivore|carnivores]] (meat-eaters). Anaconda eat 4 to 5 times each year. This is because it takes them 3 to 4 months to digest their food. Anacondas normally hunt at night. Anacondas kill by constricting (squeezing) the prey until it can no longer breathe. They may also drown their prey. Like all snakes, they swallow the prey whole. They swallow it head first. The anaconda's top and bottom jaws are attached to each other with stretchy ligaments/b This lets let the snake swallow animals wider than itself. Snakes do not chew their food. They digest it with strong acids in their stomach. Anacondas eat [[pig]]s, [[deer]], [[caiman]] (a type of [[crocodilia]]), [[bird]]s, [[fish]], [[rodent]]s (like the [[capybara]] and [[agouti]]) and other animals. After eating a large animal, the anaconda does not needs food for a long time/ It will rest for weeks after eating. The young (called neonates) can care for themselves soon after birth. This includes hunting. At this age, they are mostly defenseless against large predators. They eat small rodents (like [[rat]]s and [[mice]]), baby birds, frogs and small fish.
