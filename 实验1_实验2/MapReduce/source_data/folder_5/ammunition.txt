 '''Ammunition''', often called '''ammo''', comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''la munition''. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ammunition |title=Ammunition|work=thefreedictionary.com |year=2012 |access-date=19 February 2012}} < /ref >  At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the [[Latin]] word ''munire'' (to provide). It now is used only for [[bullet]]s and other [[projectile]]s that are thrown at the [[enemy]] by [[gun]]s, and the [[gunpowder]] or other [[propellant]] that throws the projectiles. The group word for all types of ammunition is '''munitions'''. This means any [[explosive]] thing that can be used in [[combat]] and includes [[bomb]]s, [[missile]]s, [[warhead]]s, and mines ([[land mine|landmines]], [[naval mine]]s, and [[claymore mine]]s). These are made in munitions factories.  
 
 Ammunition is mainly used to attack a target. Ammunition can include [[flare]]s and [[incendiary device]]s that start fires.  Since the invention of the [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], ammunition has come to mean the putting of a [[projectile]] - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its [[gunpowder|propellant]] - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package.  
 
 Ammunition is a complex subject.  It includes many different [[weapon]]s used by people, such as [[Explosive material|explosives]] and [[Propellant#Solid_propellant_rockets_and_projectiles|propellants]], cartridges, [[Explosive_material#High_explosives|high explosive]] projectiles (HE), [[warhead]]s, special shells to attack armour and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|aircraft]], carrier projectiles, [[fuse]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] ammunition, small arms ([[revolver]] and [[pistol]]) ammunition, [[hand grenade|grenades]], mines, flares, improved [[Conventional weapon|conventional munitions]], and [[computer]] guided munition.
