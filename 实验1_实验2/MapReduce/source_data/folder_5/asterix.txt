'''''Asterix''''' ({{lang-fr|Astérix le Gaulois}}) is a [[France|French]] comic book. It was created by [[René Goscinny]] (words) and [[Albert Uderzo]] (pictures). Goscinny died in [[1977]] and Uderzo continued to draw and write the series by himself until his death in 2020. The title character Asterix is a [[Gaul]], a member of a [[Celt]]ic tribe that lived in France, in the year of 50 B.C.E. Asterix lives in a small village in northwest [[Gaul]] (Ancient France) during the time of [[Julius Caesar]] in 50 BC. Unlike the rest of Gaul, this village has not been taken over by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], because the people in the village drink a magic potion brewed by their [[druid]] Getafix. Asterix has many adventures with his friend, [[Obelix]], a [[Menhir]] delivery man. The stories have been adapted into movies and video games; there is even an amusement park. There is also a couple of cartoons made after this popular comic, and both the comic and the cartoon can be made into so that the characters speak French.
