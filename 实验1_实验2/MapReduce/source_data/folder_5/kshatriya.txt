'''Kshatriya''' is a division of the [[caste]] system in [[Hinduism]]. A ''kshatriya'' is a warrior, ruler, politician, or administrative worker. 
 
 There are 3 lineages of [[Kshatriya|Kshatriyas]]:- 
 * [[Suryavanshi]] (Solar Dynasty) 
 * [[Chandravanshi]] (Lunar Dynasty) 
 * [[Agnivanshi]] (Fire Dynasty) 
 
 However, there is one more lineage (not mentioned in any Puranas) - Nagavanshi (snake-born), who claims descent from the Nagas.
