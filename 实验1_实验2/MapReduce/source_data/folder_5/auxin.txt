 '''Auxins''' are a class of [[plant hormone]]s (or plant growth substances) with some [[morphogenesis|morphogen]]-like characteristics. Auxins have a main role in coordination of many growth and behavioral processes in the plant's [[life cycle]]. they are essential for plant body development.  
 
 Auxins and their role in plant growth were first described by the Dutch scientist [[Frits Warmolt Went]]. [[Kenneth V. Thimann]] isolated auxin and found its chemical structure to be '''indole-3-acetic acid''' (IAA). Went and Thimann co-authored a book on plant hormones, ''Phytohormones'', in 1937. 
 
 There are synthetic auxins, and in big doses they can be used as [[herbicide]]s. [[Agent Orange]] is a mixture of synthetic auxins.
