Kabaddi is a [[team sport]] from [[South Asia]].  
 Two teams are on opposite halves of a small field.  They take turns sending a  " raider "  into the other half. This is to win points by [[wikt:tackle|tackling]] members of the opposing team. Then the raider tries to return to their own half. They hold their breath and chant the word  " Kabaddi "  during the whole raid. The raider must not cross the lobby unless they touch any of their opponents. If they do not touch anyone then they will be  " out " . There is also a bonus line.  If the raider touches it and returns to their side of the field, they will get extra points. If the raider is not able to get back to their own side, then they are considered  " out " .  RV -4416  
 
 In the international team version of kabaddi, there are two teams of seven members and 4 are in substitution. Each is on opposite halves of a field of 10 & nbsp;m × 13 & nbsp;m in case of men and 8 & nbsp;m × 12 & nbsp;m in case of women. Each has three extra players held in reserve. The game is played with 20-minute halves.  There is a five-minute [[half-time]] break when the teams change sides. 
 
 Teams take turns sending a  " raider "  to the opposite team's half.  The goal is to tag or wrestle ( " confine " ) members of the opposite team. Tagged members are  " out "  and temporarily sent off the field. 
 
 The goal of the defenders is to stop the raider from returning to the home side before taking a breath. If any of the seven players cross the lobby without touching the raider they will be declared  " out " . 
 
 The raider is sent off the field if: 
 * the raider takes a breath before returning or 
 * the raider crosses the boundary line or 
 * a part of the raider's body touches the ground outside the boundary (except during a struggle with an opposing team member). 
 
 Each time when a player is  " out " , the opposing team earns a point. A team scores a bonus of two points called a  " lona " . If the entire opposing team is declared  " out " . At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.
