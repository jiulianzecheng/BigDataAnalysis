 '''Facies''' is a term in [[geology]]. It means the look of a rock. If one looks up at a cliff of rock, the appearances changes from one layer to another. This because the [[ecological]] conditions changed as the rock was laid down. So, the facies reflect the process of [[sediment]]ation.  
 
 Regular changes in the facies usually means regular changes in the ancient [[climate]]. As the climate chaged, so the sea level rose and fell. What was deep water became shallow water, and so on. In the [[Milankovich cycle]], the [[climate]] changes regularly. As it does so, deeper water [[carbonate]]s may alternate with shallow-water [[shale]]s and [[silt]]s. These ''facies'' are seen in the column of rocks.
