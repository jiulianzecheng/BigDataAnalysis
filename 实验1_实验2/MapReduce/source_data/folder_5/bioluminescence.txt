 '''Bioluminescence''' is how living things produce [[light]]. Often this is done by [[symbiosis]]. The larger organism contains, often in a special [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[microorganism]]s which make the light. [[Eukaryote]] [[protist]]s have special [[organelle]]s, and some [[bacteria]] also produce light.  
 Bioluminescence is the result of [[chemiluminescence|chemical processes]], where the energy produced is released as visible light.  
 
 Bioluminescence has appeared many times during [[evolution]]. < ref > Hastings J.W. 1983. Biological diversity, chemical mechanisms, and the evolutionary origins of bioluminescent systems. ''J. Mol. Evol.'' '''19''', p309. < /ref >  The capacity to produce light is an extension of normal [[metabolism]]: all [[chemical reaction]]s produce a few [[photon]]s. Visible light is produced when the photon production increases. In the case of bacteria, the original function of the reaction was probably to detoxify excessive oxygen. 
 
 [[ATP]] (adenosine tri-phosphate), the biological energy source, reacts with '''luciferin''' with the aid of the enzyme '''luciferase''' to yield an intermediate complex. This complex combines with [[oxygen]] to produce a highly chemiluminescent (brightly shining) compound. 
 
 == The oceans == 
 Bioluminescence is mainly a [[Ocean|marine]] phenomenon. 
 : " It is the predominant source of light in the largest fraction of the habitable volume of the earth, the deep ocean. In contrast, bioluminescence is essentially absent (with a few exceptions) in fresh water, even in [[Lake Baikal]] " . < ref > [http://lifesci.ucsb.edu/~biolum/ Steven Haddock's Bioluminescence web page] 
 < /ref > 
 
 Bioluminescence is found in the sea at all levels.: [[plankton]]ic, [[pelagic]] and [[benthos|benthic]] organisms. Some planktonic groups, such as [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[ctenophore]]s (comb jellies) use it in most species. Most [[pelagic zone|deep-sea marine life]] use bioluminescence in one form or another. Usually, marine light-emission belongs in the [[blue]] and [[green]] [[electromagnetic radiation|light spectrum]], the wavelengths that can transmit through seawater most easily. < ref > Haddock S.H.D. Moline M.A. and Case J.F. 2010. Bioluminescence in the sea. ''Ann. Rev. Marine Sci.'' '''2''':293-343 < /ref > 
 
 == Functions of bioluminescence == 
 === Counterillumination [[camouflage]] === 
 In some [[squid]] species bacterial bioluminescence is used for counterillumination so  the animal matches the overhead environmental light seen from below. < ref name= " Young " > Young R.E.  &  Roper C.F. 1976. Bioluminescent countershading in midwater animals: evidence from living squid. ''Science''. '''191''':1046–8. PMID 1251214 < /ref >  In these animals, light organs control the contrast of this illumination to create optiminal matching. < ref name= " Young " / >   Usually these light organs are separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. 
 
 === Attraction ===

 Bioluminescence is used as a lure to attract [[prey]] by several deep sea fish such as the [[anglerfish]]. A dangling lure on the head of the fish attracts small animals to it within striking distance. Some fish, however, use a non-bioluminescent lure. 
 
 The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence for camouflage, but a small patch on its underbelly remains dark and appears as a small fish to large predatory fish like [[tuna]] and [[mackerel]] swimming beneath it. When these fish try to consume the  " small fish " , they are bitten by the shark, which gouges out small circular  " cookie cutter "  shaped chunks of flesh from its hosts. 
 
 [[Dinoflagellate]]s have an interesting twist on this mechanism. When a [[predator]] of [[plankton]] is sensed through motion in the water, the dinoflagellate luminesces. This in turn attracts even larger predators which will consume the would-be predator of the dinoflagellate. 
 
 Attracting mates is an important function of bioluminescence. This is seen in [[firefly|fireflies]], which use periodic flashing in their abdomens to attract mates in the mating season. In the marine environment this has only been well-documented in certain small [[ostracod]] [[crustaceans]], but may be quite common. 
 
 ===Repulsion=== 
 Certain squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescence as many squid use [[ink]]. A cloud of luminescence is expelled, confusing or repelling a potential predator while the squid or crustacean escapes to safety. Every species of firefly has larvae that glow to repel predators. 
 
 ==Biotechnology== 
 [[File:Bioluminescencekils.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Artistic rendering of bioluminescent [[Antarctic krill]]]] 
 
 Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in the field of [[genetic engineering]]. They have also been used in biomedical research, to give some cells visible labels. '''Luciferin''' can be added to molecules and cells to make them visible under the [[microscope]].  " This market is now worth about £20bn. If you go into a hospital and have a blood test which measures [[viral]] [[proteins]], [[cancer]] proteins, [[hormones]], [[vitamins]], [[bacteria]]l proteins, [[drugs]], it will almost certainly use this technique " . < ref name=BBC13 > Rincon, Paul 2013. The light fantastic: harnessing nature's glow. [[BBC News]] Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21144766] < /ref > 
 
 The structure of [[photophore]]s, the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms, are being investigated by industrial designers.
