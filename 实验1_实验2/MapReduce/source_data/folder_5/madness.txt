 '''Madness''' (or '''Insanity''')  is a word that can have different meanings: 
 * Up to about the [[19th century]] someone who acted ''strangely'', or outside the socially accepted norms was called ''mad'' or ''insane''. This could range from having weird  [[idea]]s to someone having [[delusion]]s or [[hallucination]]s, as they are common in some [[mental illness]]es, such as [[psychosis]].  
 * Today, those having delusions or hallucinations (or other mental illnesses) are sometimes called ''mad'' or ''insane'' by people who are not doctors. Doctors say they have  " [[mental disorder]]s " 
 * Certain diseases, such as [[rabies]], lead to a major change in behaviour.  An [[animal]] that suffers from rabies is sometimes called ''rabid'' or ''mad''.  
 
 Being able to tell right from wrong is the base of a working society and of [[law]]; for this reason, the law treats those people differently who are not able to make this distinction. In the law, when people who can’t understand that their [[crime]]s are crimes it’s called the [[insanity defense]].
