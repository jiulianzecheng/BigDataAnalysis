'''Bragi''' is one of the newest gods in the [[mythology]] of the [[Viking]]s.  He is often represented with a harp. He is shown as an old man with long gray hair and a long gray beard. He dies at the tusks of the Dwarven battle-boar at [[Ragnarok]]. His wife is [[IÃ°unn]], keeper of the apples of the Gods. Bragi is also the god of music and the harp. He wakes the world up in the morning with his harp music.
