 '''Hindko''' ({{lang|pa|ہندکو}} {{pronounced|/Hindkoŭ/}}, also '''Hindku or Hinko,''') is an [[Indo-Aryan language]] spoken by about 5 million people in [[Pakistan]]. Most of them are  in [[Hazara]] (a region of the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]), but there are also speakers in other parts of the province (such as [[Kohat]] and [[Peshawar]]). There are also speakers in [[Azad Kashmir]] and in north-western [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].  [[Hazara Hindko]] is the standard variety of Hindko. 
 
 There is no proper, formal generic name for these people because they belong to diverse [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] and tend to identify themselves by the larger families, [[Caste|castes]] and [[Tribe|tribes]]. However the people of the largest group in the districts of [[Haripur]], [[Abbottabad]] and [[Mansehra]] are sometimes recognised collectively as ''Hazarawal'', named after the Hazara Division that comprises these districts. In [[Peshawar]] city they are referred to as  " Kharay "  meaning City-dwellers or [[Hindkowan]]s.
