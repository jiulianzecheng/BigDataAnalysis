 '''Annulment''' is a method under civil or [[canon law]], similar to [[divorce]], to declare that a marriage is not a real marriage.  Though the [[Roman Catholic Church]] forbids divorce, it sometimes grants annulment, saying that the marriage never really happened. 
 
 Reasons include: 
 *At the time of the marriage, at least one was [[minor (law)|too young]]; the [[minimum age]] is set at 16 years for males and 14 for females. There may be higher limits though < ref name= " CIC_1083 " > [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon1083] < /ref > 
 *[[Ligamen]], being already married < ref > 1983 Code of Canon Law, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Y.HTM Can. 1085] < /ref > 
 *The man was [[ordained]], either as a [[priest]], or as a member of a [[monastery]]. 
 *People are closely [[relative|related]]. < ref > [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Y.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1091] < /ref >
