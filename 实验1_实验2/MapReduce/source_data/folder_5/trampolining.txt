 [[File:DmitryUshakov.JPG|thumb|left|Jump by Dmitry Ushakov, [[Russia]].]]'''Trampolining''' is a competitive [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[sport]] in which gymnasts perform airborne [[acrobatics]] while bouncing on a [[trampoline]]. These can include simple [[jump]]s in the ''pike'', ''tuck'' or ''straddle position'' to more complex combinations of forward or backward [[somersault]]s and twists. < ref > {{Cite web|last=robergej|date=2009-02-19|title=Trampoline NEW WORLD RECORD 20.6 DD Jason Burnett|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrrf04QLZo & ab_channel=robergej|access-date=2022-03-21|website=YouTube|format=video}} < /ref > 
 
 There are two related [[competition|competitive]] rebound sports: ''synchronized trampoline'' and ''double mini-trampoline''. 
 The currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three ''routines'', one of which may involve a compulsory set of [[skill]]s. The skills consist of various [[combination]]s of somersaults, shaped bounces, body landings and twists performed in various body positions. < ref > {{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Jack|date=2006|title=Back to Basics|url=http://www.brentwoodtc.org/back_to_basics.htm|publisher=British Gymnastics' GymCraft magazine|accessdate=2007-11-19}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 In the early 1930s, an American [[gymnastics|gymnast]] George Nissen observed ''trapeze'' artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the ''safety net''. He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his [[diving]] and tumbling activities. It was the beginning of a new sport. 
 
 In the [[USA]], trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers. Since trampolining became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport in 2000, many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes.
