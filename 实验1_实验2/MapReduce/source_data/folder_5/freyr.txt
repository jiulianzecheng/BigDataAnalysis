'''Freyr / Frey'''([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “[the] Lord”) is the god of [[prosperity]], fair weather, and [[fertility]] in [[Norse mythology]], associated with sacral kingship, and virility. A member of the [[Vanir]], he is the son of [[Njord|Njörd]] < nowiki/ > and twin brother of [[Freyja|Freya]]. Husband of [[Gerðr]], Freyr rides into battle on the massive shining boar '''Gullinbursti''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “Golden maned” or “bristled”) and possesses the mighty ship '''Skíðblaðnir''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “assembled from thin pieces of wood”), both forged by the drawrven brothers collectively known as the Sons of Ivaldi. Skíðblaðnir is said to always have a favorable breeze and can be folded together and carried in a pouch when not in use. Freyr once wielded the legendary sword '''Sümrbranðr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “Sword of summer”), which was said to be able to fight by itself. 
 
 When Freyr snuck in and sat on [[Odin]]'s throne Hliðskjálf (on which one can see anything, anywhere across the Nine Worlds), instead of seeing Freyja (who was recently lost somewhere), Freyr came across [[Gerd|Gerðr]], a beautiful [[Jötnar|giantess]] native to [[Jotunheim|Jötunheimr]]. He fell in love, and sent his servant Skírnir to woo her for him, but Gerðr refused to marry the god until Skirnir threatened to kill Gerðr with Freyr's sword and damage her lands. Gerðr finally agreed to marry Freyr, who then gave his sword to Skírnir as a reward. 
 
 Frey's realm is [[Álfheimr]], the land of the [[elf|elves]]. He is the patron god of [[Sweden]]. Statues of [[Odin]], [[Thor]], Frey, [[Frigg]], and [[Freyja]] are often found in ancient [[temple]]s.
