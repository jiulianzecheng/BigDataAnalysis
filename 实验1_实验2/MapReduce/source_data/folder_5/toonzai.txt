 '''Toonzai''' was a group of [[cartoon]]s [[broadcast]] on Saturday morning on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]. It was first broadcast on August 14, 2010. It used to be named [[The CW4Kids]]. The [[television programme|programs]] were broadcast on weekday afternoons.  
 
 The block is programmed by [[4Kids Entertainment]]. They also programmed the [[4Kids TV]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] until December 2008. 4Kids also indicated that it will retain ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (2000 TV series)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and ''[[Sonic X]]'' in its lineup, along with adding ''[[List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes|Dragon Ball Z Kai]]'', a redone version of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' from [[Funimation Entertainment]] that is shared with [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]].

 ==Programming== 
 In most markets, most [[affiliate]]s use the [[television network|network's]] current Saturday morning schedule. Some, such as [[Atlanta]]'s [[WUPA-TV]] broadcast the block on Sundays. This is usually done because the [[television station|stations]] were at one time [[UPN]] affiliates and UPN did not have children's television programming on Saturday mornings. Former [[The WB Television Network|WB]] affiliate [[WCCT-TV]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] airs the first three hours of the block on Saturday mornings and the last two hours on Sunday mornings to make room for their own programing. 
 
 [[KMYS]] in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], currently the newest CW affiliate has decided to air the block during early Sunday morning and early Monday morning (split into a two-hour and three-hour block) airing before 5am due to its previous commitment of airing Fox's ''[[Weekend Marketplace]]'' [[infomercial]] block on Saturday mornings (a holdover from its [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliation), along with already existing religious and paid programming on Sunday mornings; this by default will force most younger viewers of the block in that market to record it overnight for later viewing. 
 
 ==Schedule== 
 All times [[Pacific Time Zone (North America)|Pacific]]. Actual times may vary, depending on affiliate.
