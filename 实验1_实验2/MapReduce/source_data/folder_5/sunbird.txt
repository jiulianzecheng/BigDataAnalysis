 '''Sunbirds''' and '''spiderhunters''' make up the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Nectariniidae'''. They are small, slender passerines from the [[Old World]], usually with downward-curved bills. Many are brightly coloured, with iridescent feathers, especially the males. Many species have long tail feathers. They live mainly in equatorial regions. There are 145 species in 16 [[genus|genera]].   
 
 Most sunbirds feed largely on [[nectar]], but will also eat [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s, especially when feeding their young. Long narrow flowers are punctured at the base near the nectaries, where the birds get the nectar. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Geerts|first1=S.|last2=Pauw|first2=A.|date=2009|title=Hyper-specialization for long-billed bird pollination in a guild of South African plants: the Malachite Sunbird pollination syndrome|journal=South African Journal of Botany|volume=75|issue=4|pages=699–706|doi=10.1016/j.sajb.2009.08.001|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  Fruit is also often part of their diet.  
 
 The sunbirds have similarities with two distantly related groups: the [[hummingbird]]s of the [[Americas]] and the [[honeyeater]]s of [[Australia]]. The resemblances are due to [[convergent evolution]]. They all have a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Energy metabolism, respiratory quotient and breathing parameters in two convergent small bird species : the fork-tailed sunbird ''Aethopyga christinae'' (Nectariniidae) and the Chilean Hummingbird ''Sephanoides sephanoides'' (Trochilidae)|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-thermal-biology_1992-03_17_2/page/71|journal=Journal of Thermal Biology |date=March 1992|first= R.|last=Prinzinger |author2=Schafer T.  |author3=Schuchmann K.L.|volume=17|issue=2|pages=71–79|doi=10.1016/0306-4565(92)90001-V }} < /ref >  Some sunbird species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but they usually perch to feed.
