 '''Ophthalmosauridae''' were a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Ichthyosaur]]s which lived from the [[Middle Jurassic]] to the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. 
 
 Within Ophthalmosauridae there are two lineages, one including ''Aegirosaurus'' and ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]'', and the other including ''Brachypterygius'', ''[[Caypullisaurus]]'' and ''[[Platypterygius]]''. < ref name= " Fernández, 2007 " > Fernández M. 2007. Redescription and phylogenetic position of ''Caypullisaurus'' (Ichthyosauria: Ophthalmosauridae). ''Journal of Paleontology'' '''81''' (2): 368-375. < /ref > 
 
 Only three genera survived the end-Jurassic extinction event: ''Caypullisaurus'', ''Maiaspondylus'', and ''Platypterygius''. They did, however, have a worldwide distribution. The last to survive was ''Platypterygius''. This genus became [[extinct]] about 30 million years before the end of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. It happened when there was a [[deep ocean anoxic event]], which wiped out all the animals below [[pelagic]] waters. Ichthyosaurs, being [[reptile]]s, came to the surface to breath, but the [[extinction event]] removed their [[prey]] species.
