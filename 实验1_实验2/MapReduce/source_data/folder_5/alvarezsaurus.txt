 '''''Alvarezsaurus''''' is a small dinosaur from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[Argentina]], about 86{{ndash}}83 million years ago. It measured about two meters in length and weighed 20 kilograms.  
 
 It was named by [[paleontologist]] [[Jose Bonaparte]] in 1991. It walked on two legs, had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. < ref >  Paul, Gregory S. 2010. ''The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs''. Princeton University Press, p126. < /ref >  It may have eaten [[insects]]. It was more [[basal]] than other, better-known, members of its family, such as ''[[Mononykus]]'' and ''[[Shuvuuia]]''. 
 
 == In popular culture == 
 ''Alvarezsaurus'' was featured in the [[Discovery Channel]] television series ''[[Dinosaur Planet]]''. It was shown as a predator of young ''[[Saltasaurus]]'', although these species did not exist at the same time. ''Alvarezsaurus'' lived about five million years before  ''Saltasaurus''.
