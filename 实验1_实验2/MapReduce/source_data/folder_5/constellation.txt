 A '''constellation''' is a group of [[star]]s which make up imaginary outline or pattern in the night sky (the [[celestial sphere]]). Usually they are said to represent an animal, [[mythological]] person or creature in a shape. When seen, the group of stars seem to make a pattern.  
 
 The word constellation comes from Latin: ''con-'', meaning together and ''stella-'' meaning stars. Some examples of constellations are [[Ursa Major|Ursa major]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion,]] [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] etc.  Constellations were used to group stars.  Different places in the world may have different constellations, but today [[astronomy]] has a fixed set of 88 constellations.  This set is based on the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] set and later some southern constellations were added, for example [[Antlia (constellation)|Antlia]] - the [[air]] [[pump]].  Most constellations have names that come from Greek mythology, like Orion or Andromeda. 
 
 There are 12 constellations in the [[Zodiac]]. The [[Sun]] travels through the Zodiac once each year. There is also a thirteenth constellation [[Ophiuchus (constellation)|Ophiuchus]] - the carrier of a [[Serpens|serpent]], which the Sun goes through. However, most people do not think that it is in the Zodiac. 
 
 ==History== 
 *No one knows who first saw the constellations. Ancient civilizations, like the Mayans, drew their own [[star map]]s of the skies with their constellations, very few of which we use today. 
 *[[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations are still recognized by the [[IAU]] today, and the rest of the constellations were added later
