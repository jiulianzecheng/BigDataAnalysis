 A '''claw''' is a sharp object. It is found at the end of a toe or finger in many [[mammals]], birds, and some [[reptiles]]. The word  " claw "  is also used in reference to an [[invertebrate]]. For example, the chelae of [[crab]]s and [[lobsters]] are often called claws or pincers.  
 
 A claw is made of hard protein called keratin. They are used by some meat eating mammals such as cats to catch and hold prey, but they may also be used for other things such as digging, climbing trees, and so on, in those and other species. 
 
 Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead. 
 
 == Arthropods == 
 The correct name for an [[arthropod]]'s 'claw' is '''chela''' (plural ''chelae''). Legs that have a chela are called '''chelipeds'''. Chelae are also called '''pincers'''. 
 
 ==Tetrapods== 
 In [[tetrapod]]s, claws are made of [[keratin]] and have two layers.  The '''unguis''' is the outside hard layer, which has keratin fibers arranged [[perpendicular]] to the direction of growth and in layers at an angle. The '''subunguis''' is the soft, flaky layer, and the grain is parallel to the direction of growth. The claw grows outward from the '''nail matrix''' at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while traveling across the '''nail bed'''. The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to make a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle, making a more or less sharp point. Tetrapods use their claws in many ways, such as grasping or killing prey, digging, climbing, and hanging. 
 
 === Birds === 
 A '''talon''' is the claw of a [[bird of prey]], which it uses to hunt. The talons are very important. If they did not have them, those birds might not be able to catch their food. In any event, birds often need to carry their prey back to the nest. Nests are safe places where prey can be shared with chicks or with their partner. In its nest a bird can tear prey apart and feed pieces to its ever-hungry chicks. 
 
 === Mammals === 
 A [[nail (anatomy)|nail]] is similar to a claw but it is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point. A nail that is big enough to hold weight is called a '[[hoof]]'.

 Every so often, the growth of claws stops and restarts, just like the growth of [[hair]]. In hair, this causes the hair to fall out and it is replaced by a new one. In claws, this results in an old layer, and it breaks off. This takes several months for [[human]] thumbnails. [[Cat]]s are often seen working old layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose. Ungulates' hooves trim themselves when they walk on the ground. Domesticated [[Equus (genus)|equid]]s ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s) usually need regular trimming by a [[farrier]]. In the wild, horses regularly travel much further than do domestic horses.  
 
 Many [[predator]]y mammals have claws that can hide inside the animal's [[paw]], especially animals such as the [[cat]].  
 
 ====Primates==== 
 A [[primate|primate's]] [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] only has the unguis; the subunguis has disappeared. Similar to the [[tail]], the claw in [[apes]] is not needed. However, in some primates, the subunguis has redeveloped to make a claw-like structure. These certain animals do not have actual claws; instead the unguis appears normal along with a thick growth of subunguis.  Some [[lemur]]s have a toilet-claw which they use for scratching and grooming.
