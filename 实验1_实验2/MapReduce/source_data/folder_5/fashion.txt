 '''Fashion''' is the form of [[clothing]], [[accessories]], and [[furniture]]. It includes the way we wear clothes in a particular time and place. < ref > Laver, James 1979. ''The concise history of costume and fashion''. Abrams. < /ref >  Fashion is also one way we can make ourselves look more attractive. 
 
 It is related to [[culture]], but also to weather and to the history of the country we live in. For example, we have warm clothes in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] fashion and we have thin clothes in the [[Africa|African]] fashion. 
 
 Fashion includes clothing, footwear, lifestyle, accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. < ref name= " :9 " > Kaiser, Susan B. 2019. ''Fashion and cultural studies''. Bloomsbury Visual Arts. ISBN 978-1350109605 < /ref > 
 
 The history of modern fashion design is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris.
