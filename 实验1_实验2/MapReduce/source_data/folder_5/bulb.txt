 [[File:Shallots - sliced and whole.jpg|thumb|[[Shallot]]s--a type of bulb that people use for food.]] 
 A '''bulb''' is the part of some [[plant]]s, mostly under the [[Soil|dirt]], that stores [[food]] while the plant is resting from [[grow]]ing (a ''storage organ''). 
 
 Some well-known bulbs people grow to use as food are [[onion]]s and [[garlic]]. Some bulbs grown for the decorative flowers are the [[lily]], [[tulip]], and some [[iris (plant)|irises]]. 
 
 Some plant storage organs that are similar to bulbs, but have different names are, [[tuber]]s, [[corm]]s (swollen stems), [[tuberous root]]s, and [[pseudobulb]]s.
