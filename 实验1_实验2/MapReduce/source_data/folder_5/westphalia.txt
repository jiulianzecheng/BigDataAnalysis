 '''Westphalia''' ({{lang-de|Westfalen}}) is a region in [[Germany]]. The [[city|cities]] of [[Arnsberg]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Bochum]], [[Detmold]], [[Dortmund]], [[Gelsenkirchen]], [[Hagen]], [[Minden]] and [[Münster]] are in  its centre. In 1946, the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was created, which includes part of the historical region. 
 
 Westphalia is roughly the region between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Weser]], north and south of the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] River. During the course of history, different places and regions were called  " Westphalia " , the borders of the region can therefore not be defined exactly, as they depend on the entity and time talked about. For the same reason, there are different specifications of its area and number of people. They range between {{convert|16000|and|22000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|lk=on}} in land area, and between 4.3 million and 8 million people. There is a consensus that Münster, Bielefeld and Dortmund are part of Westphalia. 
 
 A linguistic definition of Westphalia (see [[Westphalian language]]) includes the former Prussian [[Province of Westphalia]] (except [[Siegen-Wittgenstein]]), [[Lippe]], the region around [[Osnabrück]] and the greater area of the [[Emsland]]. Present-day common use, however, often restricts the notion to the present part of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. 
 
 Westphalia is known for the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], as the two treaties were signed in [[Münster]] and [[Osnabrück]].
