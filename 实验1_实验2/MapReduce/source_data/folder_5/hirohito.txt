 '''Hirohito''' (29 April 1901 – 7 January 1989) was the 124th [[emperor of Japan]] according to the [[List of Emperors of Japan|traditional order of succession]], < ref name= " kunaicho " > [[Imperial Household Agency]] (''Kunaichō''), [http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/ryobo/guide/124/index.html 昭和天皇 (124)]; retrieved 2011-10-16. < /ref >  reigning from 25 December 1926, until his death on 7 January 1989. < ref > Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric et al. (2002).   " Traditional order of Tennō "  in ''Japan encyclopedia,'' pp. 962-963. < /ref >  He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Akihito]]. In Japan, reigning emperors are known simply as  " the Emperor "  and he is now referred to primarily by his [[posthumous name]], {{nihongo|'''Emperor Shōwa'''|昭和天皇}}. 
 
 The name  " Shōwa "  was given to Hirohito after he died. Emperors of Japan are normally renamed in this way; and people started using the new name in 1990. < ref name= " nussbaum889 " > Nussbaum,  " Shōwa Tennō "  at p. 889. < /ref >   During his long reign, many people outside Japan call him Emperor Hirohito, < ref > According to Japanese custom, the [[personal name]] of a reigning Emperor is not used during his reign; and instead, he is only described as {{nihongo| " his Majesty the Emperor " |天皇陛下|Tennō Heika}} or {{nihongo| " his current Majesty " |今上陛下|Kinjō Heika}} < /ref >  or just Hirohito. < ref name= " nussbaum318 " > Nussbaum,  " Hirohito "  at p. 318. < /ref > 
 
 ==Events of Shōwa's life== 
 Prince Hirohito was named regent for his father in 1921.  he became emperor after his father's death. < ref name= " nussbaum318 " / > 
 
 ===World War II === 
 Hirohito was the emperor of Japan during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]  which became [[World War 2]] (1931 to 1945). Though he was supposed to be an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] (an emperor who can make all the laws and rules), most of the power in the Japanese Government during this time was held by Japan's Prime Minister [[Hideki Tōjō]] and the military. Hirohito's role in WW2 is controversial. < ref > [https://www.biography.com/political-figure/hirohito WWII, Death  &  Facts] < /ref > 
 
 ===Constitutional monarch=== 
 After Japan's defeat in the war, the role of emperor changed.  The emperor became a symbol of the state. < ref name= " nussbaum318 " / > 
 
 Hirohito was the first emperor to travel outside Japan.  He visited Europe in 1971 and he traveled to the United States in 1975. < ref name= " nussbaum318 " / > 
 
 ===After his death===
