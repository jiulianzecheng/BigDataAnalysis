 A '''shower''' is a place where a [[person]] [[wikt:clean|cleans]] themself by using [[water]]. They stand up when they use a shower and usually do not [[wikt:wear|wear]] [[clothes]] in a shower. Showers have a shower head that squirts out water usually from above. 
 
 There are different kinds of showers. One is a  " power shower "  where there are many jets of water from all around. Another is the one in the picture. Some are in [[bath]]s, and others are on their own. 
 
 
 Showers are mainly used for hygiene.
