 '''Brucamps''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]]. It is in the [[Regions of France|region]] [[Hauts-de-France]] in the [[Somme]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the north of [[France]]. 
 
 There are still many sculpted and decorated farmhouses from the [[19th century]], built of stone and brick (which are no longer in use today). 
 
 Several of these farms had arched gateways. That helped avoid damage from incoming carriages.
