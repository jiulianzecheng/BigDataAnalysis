 '''Ladoo''' is a sweet from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is mainly popular in [[India]]. 
 
 == Preparation == 
 Common flours used for laddu include [[gram flour]] ([[chickpea]] flour), wheat [[semolina]] and ground coconut. These are combined with sugar and other flavourings, cooked in [[ghee]], and moulded into a ball shape. Some laddu recipes are prepared using [[Ayurvedic]] medicinal ingredients, including [[methi]] laddu, multigrain, and [[gum arabic|resin]] laddu. Nuts such as pistachios and almonds are commonly stuffed into laddus.
