'''Irreligion''' (meaning '''not religious''') is a term that describes people who reject religion, or who do not have a particular [[religion]]. 
 
 The term covers all those who answer  " none "  to questionnaires which ask people about their religion. In the social survey world, they are called  " the nones " . The term ''irreligious'' is an umbrella term, for [[atheist]]s, [[agnostic]]s, [[Deism|deists]] and [[Ignosticism|ignostics]]. < ref > Healey, Joseph F. 2012.

 Irreligion takes many forms, ranging from the casual and unaware to full-fledged philosophies such as [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[ignosticism]], [[deism]] and [[irreligious theism]]. All these views can also be alternatively called [[secular humanism]].  
 
 Irreligion may be a purely [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] worldview which denies a belief in anything [[supernatural]]. The broadest and loosest definition, is the lack of religious identification (attendance at church, temple etc.). The broadest definition is not belonging to any religion, which still does not exclude belief in any supernatural forces, which some irreligious people may believe in. The narrowest and strictest is subscribing to  " positive atheism " . That might be described as a willingness to state rejection of a [[deity]] absolutely. Public statements of belief can be, and are, tailored to the various social climates. < ref > Zuckerman, Phil; Galen, Luke W.; Pasquale, Frank L. 2016. Secularity Around the World.
