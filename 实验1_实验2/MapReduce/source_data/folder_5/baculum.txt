The '''baculum''' (also '''penis bone'''),  is a bone found in the penis of many male [[mammals]]. It is absent in the human [[penis]], but present in the penises of our close relatives the [[Ape|apes]], such as the [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]]. 
 The bone is located along the top of the penis and it aids in sex  by keeping it stiff for a long time during the [[sex]] act.  
 
 A bone in the penis allows a male to mate for a much longer time with a female. This can be an advantage as it prevents a rival male from having sex with the female for some time. 
 
 Male animals without a penis bone tend to form close emotional bonds with a female and so ensure they are the father of her offspring.
