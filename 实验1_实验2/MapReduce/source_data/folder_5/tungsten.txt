 '''Tungsten''' (sometimes named '''wolfram''') is a [[chemical element]] on the periodic table. It has the chemical symbol '''W''' and it has the [[atomic number]] 74. It is a steel-gray to white colored [[metal]].  Tungstenâ€™s [[electron shell]] formula is: 2, 8, 18, 32, 12, 2. In chemistry, it is placed in a group of metal elements named the [[transition metal]]s. Tungsten is found in several [[ore]]s, including [[wolframite]] and [[scheelite]]. 
 
 Tungsten has a higher [[melting point]] than any other non-[[alloy]] that exists. The pure form (only tungsten) is mainly used in [[electricity|electrical]] equipment. Its [[chemical compound|compounds]] and alloys are used for many things, the most well known being its use in [[electrical filament]] < nowiki/ > s for [[light bulb]]s.  It is also used in the filament and target in most [[X-ray]] tubes, [[superalloys]], and in glass-to-metal seals. 
 
 Tungsten's density and hardness have many uses. In the military, for example, tungsten has been used in [[Anti-tank gun|armor-piercing artillery]]. It is also used in machine tools. 
 
 Tungsten's density is almost the same as [[gold]]. [[Gold]]-plated tungsten [[ingot]]s have been [[Fraud|fraudulently]] passed off as solid gold.
