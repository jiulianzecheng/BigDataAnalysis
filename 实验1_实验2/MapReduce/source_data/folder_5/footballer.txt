A '''footballer''' is the [[sportsperson|athlete]] who - with amatorial or professional interests - plays [[football]]. 
 
 == Club owning == 
 Footballers sign a contract with clubs, playing for them until their expire date. At this point, a footballer can make another contract or move to another club. 
 
 == Role == 
 During a game, each team uses 11 players with the compulsory presences of a [[goalkeeper]] and a [[Captain (association football)|captain]]. Roles are as follows: [[goalkeeper]], [[Defender (football)|defender]], [[midfielder]] and [[Forward|attacker]]. Each of these have more positions, for example: 
 
 * Full-back, centre-back or sweeper (defenders) 
 * Half-back, central or playmaker (midfielders) 
 * Centre-forward, winger or striker (attackers) 
 
 Despite each role requests different skills and moves, every footballer has a common objective: scoring goals.
