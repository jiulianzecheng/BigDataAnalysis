 The Palaeolithic began when [[Hominidae|hominids]] (early [[Human|humans]]) started to use stones as tools for bashing, cutting, and scraping. All members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]'' made stone tools, starting with relatively [[wikt:crude|crude]] tools made by ''[[Homo habilis]]'' and ''[[Homo erectus]]''. In Europe, the large-brained [[Neanderthal]] Man (''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'') made tools of high quality. Our own [[species]], ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', made even higher-quality tools. These tools are the first [[Culture|cultural]] products which have survived to [[Modern history|modern times]]. < ref name= " Klein " > Klein, Richard G. 2009.

 The Palaeolithic ended around 11,650 years ago, when humans began to make smaller, finer tools. In [[Western Europe]], this was the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] period. In warmer climates like [[Africa]], the [[Epipaleolithic]] period came after the Palaeolithic. < ref > ''[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9052215 Mesolithic Period]''. 2008.

 The [[Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|geological epoch]] (also called the Ice Age) happened at the same time as the Palaeolithic. In some areas, like [[Western Europe]], this [[ice age]] affected the way people lived. In the [[Middle East]], people began to switch from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to [[Farming|agriculture]]. Both the Palaeolithic and the Pliestocene ended around the same time. 
 
 == Cultures == 
 === Oldowan === 
 [[File:Pierre taillée Melka Kunture Éthiopie fond.jpg|thumb|220 px|right|An Oldowan pebble tool, the most basic of human stone tools]] 
 
 Hominids began to make '''Oldowan''' tools around 2.6 million years ago. They continued to make these tools until about 1.7 million years ago. After that, hominids began to make more [[wikt:sophisticated|sophisticated]] tools, which archaeologists call '''Acheulean'''.  
 
 Oldowan tools are named after [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]], where Oldowan tools were first found. The archaeologist Louis Leakey made this discovery in the [[1930s]]. For a long time after that, archaeologists thought that the Oldowan were the earliest tools ever made. Now they know that hominids made stone tools much earlier in history - about 3.3 million years ago. This was before the genus ''[[Homo]]'' had [[Evolution|evolved]]. 
 
 Archaeologists do not know for sure which [[species]] actually created and used Oldowan tools. The use of these tools reached its peak with early species of ''Homo,'' such as ''[[Homo habilis|H. habilis]]'' and ''[[Homo ergaster|H. ergaster]]''. Archaeologists think that early ''[[Homo erectus]]'' inherited Oldowan [[technology]], then refined it into the Acheulean [[industry]] beginning about 1.7 million years ago. < ref name= " Meat " > {{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v56/n12/full/1601646a.html | doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601646 | title=A brief review of the archaeological evidence for Palaeolithic and Neolithic subsistence | year=2002 | last1=Richards | first1=MP | journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume=56 | issue=12 | pages=1270–1278 | pmid=12494313 | s2cid=17082871 }} < /ref >  Oldowan tools are sometimes called ''pebble tools'', because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble, in pebble form, the final product. < ref > Napier, John. 1960. Fossil hand bones from Olduvai Gorge. ''Nature'', December 17th. < /ref >  They are sometimes subdivided into types, such as choppers, scrapers and pounders, based on their main uses. < ref > Vrba E.  &  Y.H.-Selassie 1994. African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia. ''Science'' '''264''': 1907-1909. < /ref > 
 
 === Acheulean === 
 Around 1.7 million years ago, ''Homo habilis'' began to make oval- and pear-shaped [[hand axe]]s. Archaeologists call these tools '''Acheulean'''. They were more sophisticated than Oldowan tools, and had more uses. Early humans made these tools in [[Africa]], western [[Asia]], and [[Europe]] during the Lower Palaeolithic era. They are usually found with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' remains. 
 
 Acheulean tools were the dominant technology for most of human history. More than a million years ago, Acheulean tool users left Africa to colonize [[Eurasia]].{{ref|outofafrica}} Although it developed in Africa, the Acheulean industry is named after the [[type site]] of Saint-Acheul, where archaeologists first found Acheulean tools in the [[19th century]]. This area is now a [[suburb]] of [[Amiens]] in northern [[France]]. 
 
 [[John Frere]] was the first to suggest in writing that hominids started making Acheulean tools during  " a very ancient period. "  In 1797, Frere sent two examples of Acheulean tools to the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]] from [[Hoxne]] in [[Suffolk]]. He had found them in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[lake]] deposits, along with the [[Bone|bones]] of [[Extinction|extinct]] animals. He concluded that they were made by people '' " who had not the use of [[Metal|metals]] " '' and said they belonged to a '' " very ancient period indeed, even beyond the present world " ''. However, other archaeologist still held a pre-[[Darwinism|Darwinian]] view of [[human evolution]], and they ignored Frere's ideas.  
 
 ==== Dating the Acheulean ==== 
 [[Image:Hand axe spanish.gif|left|thumb|200px|An Acheulean handaxe from [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]]]] 
 Based on [[radiometric dating]] (often [[potassium-argon dating]]), hominids began to use Acheulean techniques around 1.65 million years ago,{{ref|young}} and continued to use these tools until about 100,000 years ago.{{ref|youngest}} Archaeologists found the oldest known Acheulean tools in the [[West Turkana]] region of [[Kenya]]{{ref|age}}. These tools are 1.65 million years old. Some archaeologists think that hominids began to use Acheulean techniques earlier, around 1.8 million years ago.{{ref|roche}} 
 
 In individual regions, scientists can use radiometric dating to determine the age of a tool much more precisely. For example, Acheulean methods did not reach Europe until around 400,000 years ago. In smaller study areas, scientists can narrow down a tool's age even more. However, numerical dates can be misleading. It is common to associate examples of this early human tool industry with one or more [[glaciation|glacial]] or [[interglacial]] periods, or with a particular species of early human. The earliest user of Acheulean tools was ''[[Homo ergaster]],'' who first appeared about 1.8 million years ago. Some researchers prefer to call these hominids ''early [[Homo erectus]]''.{{ref|usage}} Later forms of early humans also used Acheulean techniques. These are described below. 
 
 There is considerable time overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries. In some regions, Acheulean tool-using groups were [[wikt:contemporary|contemporary]] with other, less sophisticated industries such as the '''Clactonian'''.{{ref|barnham}} Then, later, Acheulean tools occur at the same time as the more sophisticated '''Mousterian'''. The Acheulean was not a neatly defined period, but a tool-making technique which flourished especially well in early prehistory. It was a basic method for making stone tools which was shared across much of the [[Old World]]. 
 
 === Clactonian === 
 [[File:Clactonian flake.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A huge Clactonian core made of [[quartzite]]. Quite small flakes would be struck off it.]] 
 
 In Europe, early humans began to make [[flint]] tools during the early part of the [[interglacial]] period, around 400,000 years ago. < ref > known as the Hoxnian, the Mindel-Riss or the Holstein stage < /ref >  Archaeologists call these '''Clactonian''' tools. ''Homo erectus'' made Clactonian tools; modern humans did not. Early, [[wikt:crude|crude]] flint tools from other regions, made using similar methods, are either called Clactonian tools or ''core  &  flake'' technology. 
 
 These tools are named after [[Clacton-on-Sea]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Essex]]. There, in 1911, archaeologists found Clactonian [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] along with the remains of a giant [[elephant]] and [[hippopotamus]]. These artifacts included flint chopping tools, flint flakes, and the tip of a worked wooden [[wikt:shaft|shaft]].  Archaeologists have found other Clactonian tools at sites in [[Swanscombe]], [[Kent]], and [[Barnham]] in [[Suffolk]]. [[Evidence]] shows that early humans made this type of tool throughout Northern Europe. 
 
 To make Clactonian tools, early humans struck thick, irregular flakes from a core of flint. They used the flint core as a chopper, and used the flakes as crude [[Knife|knives]] or scrapers. Archaeologists have found Clactonian tools which were notched, implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft. 
 
 The Clactonian and Acheulean industries might have existed at the same time. However, in 2004, archaeologists excavated a [[Butcher|butchered]] Pleistocene elephant near [[Dartford]], [[Kent]]. They found many Clactonian flint tools, but no hand axes. Since hand axes would have been more useful than choppers to dismember an elephant carcass, this is evidence that the Clactonian was a separate industry. Flint of sufficient quality was available in the area, so archaeologists think the people who carved up the elephant did not know how to make hand axes. 
 
 === Mousterian === 
 [[File:Pointe levallois Beuzeville MHNT PRE.2009.0.203.2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mousterian]] tool from France]] 
 
 The '''Mousterian''' is an industry of stone tools associated with Neanderthal Man (''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''). Early humans started making these tools around 300,000 years ago, and continued to make them until about 30,000 years ago. There are up to thirty types of Mousterian tools, compared to about six in the Acheulean style. 
 
 The Mousterian was named after the type site of [[Le Moustier]], a [[rock shelter]] in the [[Dordogne]] region of [[France]]. < ref > [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/tools/middle-tools]  Smithsonian: Middle Stone Age tools. < /ref >  Archaeologists have found similar flintwork all over unglaciated [[Europe]], as well as the [[Near East]] and [[North Africa]]. Mousterian hand axes usually had long blades and points. Overall, these tools are finished more perfectly than any previous style of toolmaking.  
 
 To make Mousterian tools, early humans used the [[Levallois technique]]. This is a prepared-core technique: the toolmaker works on the core of the stone for so that they can strike off a long, fine blade. For this quality of work, early humans had to use a 'soft' [[hammer]] made of something like [[deer]] [[antler]], not a stone hammer. Neanderthals had larger brains than humans; this may have helped them develop Mousterian technology. 
 
 All cultures of modern humans, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', used the Mousterian style''.'' It is characteristic of our species to produce many more tools, all specialised for particular tasks. There are at least 100 types of tools in the Upper Palaeolithic, compared to a maximum of 30 tools in the Mousterian. 
 
 == Chronology of Palaeolithic and following periods == 
 The Palaeolithic is sometimes divided into three (somewhat overlapping) periods which mark technological and cultural advances in different human communities:

 The [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] eras followed the Palaeolithic. The Neolithic ended around 1900 BC. At this time, the Stone Age ended and the [[Bronze Age]] began. Later, when the Bronze Age ended, the [[Iron Age]] began.

 ==== Venus figurines ==== 
 [[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Venus of Willendorf]] is a well-known figurine. It was made about 25.000 years ago]] 
 [[Venus figurines]] may be some of the first pieces of [[art]] ever made. These are very small [[statue]]s of women, mostly [[pregnant]] with visible [[breast]]s. Archaeologists have found them in areas of [[Western Europe]], stretching to [[Siberia]].  
 
 Most of the Venus figurines that archaeologists have found are between 20,000 and 30,000 years old. However, they have found two figurines that are much older. The [[Venus of Tan-Tan]], found in [[Morocco]], is 300,000 to 500,000 years old. The [[Venus of Berekhat Ram]], found on the [[Golan Heights]], is between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. These may be the some of the earliest things that show the human form. 
 
 Early humans used different kinds of stone, bones, and [[ivory]] to make these figurines. They also made Venus figurines out of [[clay]], then hardened the clay by heating it in a [[fire]]. This is one of the earliest known uses of [[ceramics]]. 
 
 Archaeologists do not know what these figurines meant to the people who made them. There are two basic [[theories]]: 
 * They may be representations of human [[fertility]], or they may have been made to help increase fertility. 
 * They may represent (fertility) [[Deity|goddesses]]. 
 Scientists know that these figurines were not linked to the fertility of fields, because [[agriculture]] had not been discovered when the figurines were made. 
 
 The two older Venus figurines may have formed mostly through natural processes. The Venus of Tan-Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of [[paint]]. < ref name= " oldestfigurine " > {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3047383.stm|title='Oldest sculpture' found in Morocco|publisher=BBC News|date=23 May 2003}} < /ref >  The substance contained traces of [[iron]] and [[manganese]]. < ref name= " oldestfigurine "  / >  The figurine of Berekhat Ram has traces of tool marks.

 ==== Cave paintings ==== 
 [[Cave painting]]s have been found in about 350 caves in Europe. Many were done in the Palaeolothic Age, between about 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. Some of the most famous are in the Cave of [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Lascaux]] Cave in [[France]]. < ref name= " Klein " / > < sup > p545 < /sup >  Usually, cave paintings show animals, like [[aurochs]], [[bison]]s or [[horse]]s.  
 
 Nobody knows why these paintings were done. However, archaeologists know that people did not create cave paintings just to decorate their living spaces. Usually, there are no signs that humans ever lived in the caves where people painted. 
 [[File:Lascaux2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A horse, from Lascaux Cave in France, about 16.000 years old]] 
 The oldest known cave paintings are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] Cave in France. There are two groups of paintings in this cave. The first group was painted 33,000 to 30,000 years ago. The second group was done 26,000 to 27,000 years ago. < ref name= " Klein " / > < sup > p546 < /sup >  We know this because scientists did [[radiocarbon dating]] of  " black from drawings, from [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/torch torch] marks and from the floors " . < ref > Quotes from Clottes 2003b p214. < /ref >  By 1999, scientists had dated 31 samples from the cave. The oldest were from 33,390-32,410 years ago. < ref > Archaeologists sometimes use the phrase  " B.P. "  (before the present day) to mean  " years ago " < /ref > < ref > Clottes 2003b p33. The oldest is sample Gifa 99776 from  " zone 10 " . See also Chauvet (1996 p131, for a chronology of dates from various caves. Bahn's foreword and Clottes' epilogue to Chauvet 1996 discuss dating. < /ref > 
 
 Some archaeologists say this timeline is incorrect. Christian Züchner studied the style of the Chauvet paintings and compared it to paintings done at other caves. He thought one group of paintings was done between 28,000 and 23,000 years ago. He said the other group was between 18,000 and 10,000 years old. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/12/chauv.html|title=Grotte Chauvet Archaeologically Dated|accessdate=2007-12-23|last=Züchner|first=Christian|date=September 1998|work=Communication at the International Rock Art Congress IRAC ´98}} < br / > Clottes (2003b), pp. 213-214, has a response by Clottes. < /ref >  Pettitt and Bahn also think the Chauvet painting styles do not match the dates identified through radiocarbon dating. < ref > {{cite journal |last= Pettitt |first=Paul |author2=Paul Bahn |date= March 2003 |title=Current problems in dating Palaeolithic cave art: Candamo and Chauvet |journal=Antiquity |volume=77 |issue=295 |pages=134–141 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00061421 |s2cid=161903280 |url= http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/077/Ant0770134.htm }} < /ref > 
 
 People from the Palaeolithic era drew well. They knew about [[Perspective (graphical) |perspective]], and they knew of different ways to draw. They were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted. Some of the paintings show how the animals behaved. The paintings may have been important for [[ritual]]s.

 In addition, in the Palaeolithic, human populations spread across a wide geographical area. Archaeologists think that during the Lower Paleolithic, [[Ancestor|ancestors]] of modern humans lived only in Africa east of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]]. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching [[ecosystem]]s as diverse as [[New Guinea]] and [[Alaska]].

 [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have different opinions about the proportions of plant and animal foods consumed. Just as with still existing hunters and gatherers, there were many varied  " diets "  - in different groups -of fruit and vegetables. < ref > {{cite journal

 Another view is that until the Upper Paleolithic, humans were [[frugivore]]s (fruit eaters) who supplemented their meals with [[carrion]], eggs, and small prey such as baby birds and [[mussel]]s.
