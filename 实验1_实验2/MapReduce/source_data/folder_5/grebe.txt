 == Description, color and shape == 
 Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the [[Little Grebe]] are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is [[webbed feet]] which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on [[land]] because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water.

 Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in [[danger]], they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do.  
 
 Grebes can have long or short [[bill]]s. If they eat [[insects]] in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat [[crustaceans]] (for example, [[crabs]]) they will have a long, sharp bill.  
 
 Most grebes are [[brown]], [[white]] and [[red]]/[[Orange (color)|orange]]. They have many, [[waterproof]] [[feathers]]. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In [[spring]] and [[summer]], grebes have orange [[Crest (feathers)|crest]]s on their heads. This is so they can attract a [[mate]]. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they  " dance "  in the water. 
 
 Grebes make their [[nest]] from [[plant]]s found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are [[adult]]s. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Grebes live in [[freshwater]] ([[lakes]] or [[rivers]]). Some species of grebe will go to [[saltwater]] ([[sea]]/[[ocean]]) when they are [[migrating]]. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in [[North America]], [[Europe]] or [[Asia]]. Grebes in [[South America]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] do not [[migrate]]. They are found in every [[continent]] on [[earth]].
