 '''Cynognathus''' was a [[cynodont]] (a [[mammal]]-like reptile, not a dinosaur) that was the size of a wolf. This [[therapsid]] lived on open plains during the early to middle [[Triassic]] period, roughly 230-245 million years ago. It was probably warm-blooded and may have given birth to live young. Fossils have been found in [[South Africa]] and [[Argentina]].
