The '''Araneomorphae''' are the kinds of [[spider]]s that humans most often see around their homes and [[garden]]s. They are different from the ''[[Mygalomorphae]]'', the group of spiders that includes the [[tarantula]]s (also called  " bird-eating spider " ). There is a third group of spiders that is extremely ancient and now has few species remaining. It is called the ''Mesothelae''. < ref > {{cite book|last=Foelix|first=Rainer F.|title=Biology of Spiders|year=2011|url=https://archive.org/details/biologyspiders00foel_799|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-973482-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/biologyspiders00foel_799/page/n4 4]â€“5|edition=2nd}} < /ref >
