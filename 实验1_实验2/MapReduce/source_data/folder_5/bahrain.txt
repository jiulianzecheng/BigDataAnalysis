 '''Bahrain''' (officially called '''Kingdom of Bahrain''') is an [[island]] country in the [[Persian Gulf|Arabian Gulf]]. [[Saudi Arabia]] is to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the [[King Fahd Causeway]], and [[Qatar]] is to the south across the [[Persian Gulf]].  The [[Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge]], not yet built, will link Bahrain to Qatar as the longest fixed bridge in the world. Qatar and Bahrain's flag is the same design but not the same colors because Qatar is white and maroon and Bahrain is white and red. 
 
 == History == 
 
 People have lived in Bahrain before there was writing.  It has been ruled and influenced by the [[Assyrian]]s, [[Babylonian]]s, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persians]], and the [[Arabs]], who made the island [[Muslim]]. Bahrain was in old times known as [[Dilmun]], [[Tylos]], [[Awal]] and [[Mishmahig]]. 
 
 The islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word ''Bahrain'',  " Two Seas " , means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea. 
 
 A location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and [[pearl]]s made Bahrain important in history. About [[2300 BC]], Bahrain started trading with [[Mesopotamia]] (now [[Iraq]]) and the [[Indus Valley]] (now near [[India]]). It was then called Delmon, and  was linked to the [[Sumer|Sumerian Civilization]] about [[2000 BC]]. Bahrain also became part of the [[Babylon]]ian empire about [[600 BC]]. Historical records called Bahrain the  " Life of Eternity " ,  " Paradise " , the  " Pearl of the Persian Gulf "  and other names. 
 
 Until [[1521]], Bahrain also ruled [[Al-Hasa]] and [[Qatif]] (both are now the eastern province of [[Saudi Arabia]]) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now [[Kuwait]] to [[Oman]]. This was called ''Iqlim Al-Bahrain'' (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain. 
 
 == Modern history == 
 
 The modern history of Bahrain begins with [[Great Britain]] exploring the area, trying to keep [[Iran]] from taking more land. The British gave support to the [[Al-Khalifa]] family, who made a power base in the island and allied with the British to keep the island from Iran. The British got free passage to the Persian Gulf through this agreement. In November of [[1957]], the [[Iranian parliament]] declared that Bahrain was the Fourteenth Province of Iran. Later the British would become involved in the politics of Bahrain by choosing an Emir of the island. Iran and Britain later agreed that the [[United Nations Secretary General]] would judge the political situation in Bahrain. In a [[Plebiscite]] to decide the country's future, the majority of the people of Bahrain chose to reject Iran's claims, and to define their country and their culture to be Arabic, and not Persian. 
 
 [[Oil]] was found in the early [[20th century]] and brought modern improvements to the country.  Relations with the [[United Kingdom]] also became closer, and the British brought more military bases to the nation.  British influence grew, until [[Charles Belgrave]] became an advisor; Belgrave brought modern education to Bahrain. 
 
 After [[World War II]], anti-British feeling spread through the Arab world and led to riots in Bahrain.  The British left Bahrain in [[1971]], making it an independent country.  The sales of more oil in the [[1980s]] brought money to Bahrain, but even when the sales of oil  decreased in later years, it did not cause as many problems in Bahrain as in other oil countries, because the economy of Bahrain had grown into other areas. 
 
 In 1973 the election of first parliament was done but the government stopped  &  dissociate the parliament in 1975 which result in strong protests by the Bahraini opposition (Moderate Islamic  &  non-Islamist opposition). 
 
 In [[1994]], many highly educated Bahraini people signed a letter to Prince of Bahrain at that time [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa]] to re-establish the parliament life which is strongly refused  &  the leader of the opposition at that time Sheikh [[Abdulamir Aljamri]] was jailed then a huge protest  &  conflicts occurs between Bahraini nation  &  the armed forces. 
 
 In [[1999]], [[Sheikh]] [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] followed his father as [[head of state]] and called for elections for parliament to resolve the congestion that occurred over that last period.  The women were given the right to vote and the new ruler released all political prisoners in 2001. 
 
 In 2002 the King released a new constitution without any voting from the nation  &  canceled 1973 constitution which caused strong refuse from the most of nation parties  &  opposition. 
 The situations became worse later  &  some of political activists were jailed like [[Abdulhadi Al-Khuwajah]], [[Hasan Mushaima]]. 
 
 Many political websites that refused these changes were blocked like Bahrain online forum (the most popular website in Bahrain): www.bahrainonline.org; < ref > {{Cite web|date=2010-09-08|title=Dozens of websites and electronic forums blocked|url=https://ifex.org/dozens-of-websites-and-electronic-forums-blocked/|access-date=|website=IFEX|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Until 2009 there were many [[Riot|riots]]  &  [[Conflict|conflicts]] especially from Shia group which faces a huge organized discrimination according to [[Human Rights Watch]]  &  [[US Congress]]. 
 
 In [[2023 in Bahrain|2023]], Around 700-1000 political detainees in Bahrain begin a [[hunger strike]] demanding an end to [[solitary confinement]], access to medical care and religious freedom (right to pray together in groups). A large number of [[Bahraini people|Bahrainis]] came on streets of [[Manama]] in support of prisoners. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|title=Slow murder: Hundreds of prisoners stage Bahrain’s largest hunger strike|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/28/slow-murder-hundreds-of-prisoners-stage-bahrains-largest-hunger-strike|access-date=|website=www.aljazeera.com|language=en}} < /ref >  The hunger strike was suspended after a week as the Bahraini officials agreed to the demands but many prisoners went back to hunger strike again the next day itself, as they say none of the demands were fulfilled. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The family of a jailed Bahrain activist says he has resumed a hunger strike|url=https://www.npr.org/2023/09/14/1199429472/the-family-of-a-jailed-bahrain-activist-says-he-has-resumed-a-hunger-strike|website=National Public Radio}} < /ref > 
 
 == Politics == 
 
 Bahrain is a [[constitutional monarchy]] ruled by the King, [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. The head of government is the [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|Prime Minister]], which is currently held by Crown Prince [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]]. [[Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa|Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa]] was the country's first prime minister from 1971 until his death in 2020.  The prime minister has a cabinet of 15 members.  
 
 Bahrain has a [[bicameral legislature]] with a lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, elected by all of the people and the upper house, the Shura Council, appointed by the King. Both houses have forty members. The first elections were held in [[2002]], with Members of Parliament serving four year terms. 
 
 Women were given the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in 2002's election, but no women were elected to office that year, and Shia and Sunni Islamists won a majority of seats. Because no women were elected, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes members of the Kingdom’s [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] people. 
 
 The King recently created the Supreme Judicial Council to organise the country's courts and the government offices. 
 
 == Governorates == 
 
 Bahrain is split into five [[governorate]]s. Until [[July 3]] [[2003]], it was divided into twelve municipalities. 
 
 # [[Capital Governorate|Capital]] 
 # [[Central Governorate|Central]] 
 # [[Muharraq Governorate|Muharraq]] 
 # [[Northern Governorate|Northern]] 
 # [[Southern Governorate|Southern]] 
 
 For further information, see: [http://www.capital.gov.bh/pages/pdf/govlawe.pdf Decree-Law establishing governorates] from the Bahrain official website.

 #[[Adliya]] 
 
 Other towns include: [[Awali]], [[Diraz]], [[Al Hidd|Hidd]], [[Sar, Bahrain|Sar]], [[Bani Jamrah]]. 
 
 == Economy == 
 
 In Bahrain, [[petroleum]] (oil product) producing and processing is about 60% of the money from export, 60% of government money, and 30% of [[Gross Domestic Product]]. The economy has changed as the sales of oil have changed since [[1985]], for example, during and after the [[Persian Gulf War]] of [[1990]] - [[1991]]. Bahrain has high quality  communications and transport, and so the country is home to many international companies with business in the Persian Gulf. A large part of the country's income comes from petroleum products made from imported [[crude oil]]. There are several major industrial projects being built. [[Unemployment]], especially among young people, and the decrease of both oil and water resources are major economic problems. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Bahrain is a flat and dry [[archipelago]], with a low desert plain rising gently to a low central hill, in the [[Persian Gulf|Arabian Gulf]], east of [[Saudi Arabia]].  The highest point is the 122 meter [[Jabal ad Dukhan]] ( " Mountain of Smoke " ). 
 
 Bahrain has a total area of 620 [[Square kilometre|km²]], which is a few square kilometres larger than the [[Isle of Man]].  As an archipelago of 33 islands, Bahrain does not share a land border with any other country, but it does have a 161 & nbsp;km coast line and claims a further 12 [[Nautical mile|nm]] of [[territorial sea]] and a 24 & nbsp;nm [[contiguous zone]].  Bahrain enjoys mild winters and has very hot, humid summers. 
 
 Bahrain's natural resources include large amounts of oil [[natural gas]] as well as [[fish]].  Only 1% of the country includes land where crops can be grown.  92% of Bahrain is desert, and [[drought]]s and dust storms are the main natural dangers. 
 
 Environmental problems in Bahrain include [[desertification]], which is causing the land where crops can be grown to decrease, and damage to coast lines, [[coral reef]]s, and sea vegetation caused by [[oil spill]]s from large [[tanker]]s and oil [[refinery|refineries]]. 
 
 == About the people == 
 
 The official religion of Bahrain is [[Islam]]; most of the people are [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], but there are also small [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian]] minorities. Most Bahrainis are Arabs, although some tribes came from [[Persia]].  Today, many of the people in Bahrain are [[guest worker]]s who come from [[Iran]], [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. A ''[[Financial Times]]'' article from [[31 May]] [[1983]] found that  " Bahrain is a polyglot (speaking many languages) state, both religiously and racially. Leaving aside the temporary immigrants of the past 10 years, there are at least eight or nine communities (groups of people) on the island " . 
 
 The present communities may be classified as Al-Khalifa, Arab tribes allied to Al-Khalifa, the [[Baharnah]] (Shia Arabs), the [[Howilla]] (Sunni Arabs from Persia), Sunni Arabs (from the mainland), [[Ajam]] (Persian Shia), [[India]]ns who traded with Bahrain and settled before the age of oil (used to be called Banyan), a tiny Jewish community, and a group which contains everyone else. 
 
 == Culture == 
 
 [[Manama]], Bahrain's [[capital city]], is as modern as other cities in the world.  But life in the island's many villages (and in parts of Manama itself) remains traditional. Where there is tradition in the Persian Gulf area, there is Islamic conservatism: women cover themselves from head to foot and women travellers are expected to wear long skirts and one-piece bathing suits. Bahrain's population is 85% Muslim and Islam is the state religion. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language, but many people speak [[English language|English]]. 
 
 Traditional folk art continues in several places around Bahrain: [[dhow]]s (fishing boats) are built near Manama and [[Muharraq]], cloth is made at [[Bani Jamrah]] and [[pottery]] is made at [[A'ali]]. A few [[goldsmith]]s still work in the Manama [[souk]], though much of the work is now done in other countries. One of the important parts of Bahraini culture is the drinking of traditional Arabian [[coffee]].   Traditional Arabian street food like [[shawarma]] ([[lamb]] or [[chicken]] cut from a large [[spit]] and served in [[pita bread]]) and [[dessert]]s such as [[baklava]] are also found.
