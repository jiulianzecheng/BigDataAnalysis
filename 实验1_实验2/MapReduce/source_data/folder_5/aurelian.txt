 [[Image:Aureliancoin1.jpg|thumb|200px|''Antoninianus'' coin of Aurelian]] 
 '''Aurelian''' (214–275 [[AD]]) was [[Roman emperor]] from 270 to 275. 
 
 Aurelian ({{Lang-la|Lucius Domitius Aurelianus}}) came from the [[Balkans]], part of the [[Roman Empire]]. He was a soldier in the [[Roman army]] when the emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] promoted him to high [[rank]]. When Claudius died, his army chose Aurelian as the next emperor. Aurelian overcame a number of [[rebellions]]. His armies overcame the armies of the [[Gallic Empire]] and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] (two Roman [[states]] that formed during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]). Aurelian joined the Roman Empire into one state again, and this was the beginning of the end of the Crisis of the Third Century.  
 
 While he was emperor, Aurelian overcame the armies of several groups of [[barbarians]] – the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], [[Sarmatians]], and [[Carpi]]. Aurelian increased the importance the god [[Sol Invictus]] in [[Roman religion]] and he built a [[Roman temple|temple]] for the god in the city of [[Rome]]. For the first time in many [[centuries]], Rome needed a [[defensive wall]] to keep out enemies who might attack it. Aurelian's government started to build the [[Aurelian Walls]] around Rome. Aurelian's wife, [[Ulpia Severina]], was his {{Lang-la|[[augusta]]|label=none}} ([[empress]]) after summer 274. Aurelian was [[murdered]] by some of his soldiers in autumn 275. 
 
 == Early life == 
 The ''[[Calendar of Philocalus]]'' and the Greek historian [[John Malalas]] say that Aurelian was born on the 9 September 214. Aurelian was probably not from the [[nobility]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYRorgEACAAJ|title=Römische Kaisertabelle: Grundzüge einer römischen Kaiserchronologie|last1=Kienast|first1=Dietmar|last2=Eck|first2=Werner|last3=Heil|first3=Matthäus|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft (WBG)|year=2017|isbn=978-3-534-26724-8|edition=6th|location=Darmstadt|pages=225–229|language=de|chapter=Aurelian (Sept. 270–Sept./Okt. 275)|orig-year=1990}} < /ref >

 == Emperor == 
 
 === 270–272 === 
 Aurelian became emperor at Sirmium in September 270. Then Aurelian's army overcame [[Quintillus]]'s army in a battle at [[Aquileia]]. (Quintillus was the emperor and the brother of Claudius Gothicus, the previous emperor.) Latin [[Historians|histories]] (the ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' and the work of [[Eutropius]]) say that Aurelian was emperor for five years and six months. This means that Aurelian may have started a [[rebellion]] against Claudius in February or March 270. However, this is not in the Roman histories. The [[Roman calendar]] had a [[festival]] for the [[anniversary]] of Aurelian's [[accession]] as emperor. It was on the day that Claudius Gothicus died. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 For the first winter (270–271) of his [[reign]], Aurelian was in Rome. [[Felicissimus]], a ''[[rationalis]]'' (an official in the [[Mint (money)|mint]]) in Rome started a rebellion in the city, possibly in this first winter. Felicissimus did not have success. In 271 Aurelian was [[Roman consul]] for the first time. That year, he undertook military [[Campaign|campaigns]] against the [[Vandals]], [[Juthungi]], and [[Sarmatians]]. Aurelian got the name {{Lang-la|Germanicus maximus|label=none}} because of his [[Victory|victories]] over [[Germanic peoples]]. He was again in Rome for his second winter (271–272) as emperor. It was at this time that the Romans began to build new [[defensive wall]] < nowiki/ > s around the city: the [[Aurelian Walls]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 The Greek historian [[Zosimus]] wrote that at some time in 271 or 272, Aurelian overcame a rebellion by [[Domitianus II (usurper)|Domitianus]]. Zosimus also wrote that around the same time, Aurelian overcame another rebellion by [[Urbanus (usurper)|Urbanus]]. Both Zosimus and the ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' write that [[Septimius (usurper)|Septimius]] started another rebellion in [[Dalmatia]]. Septimius's own soldiers [[killed]] him. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 === 272–273 === 
 In 272, Aurelian moved to the eastern Roman Empire. He fought against the [[Goths]] in the [[Balkans]]. Aurelian got the name {{Lang-la|Gothicus maximus|label=none}} because of his [[Victory|victories]] over the Goths. Aurelian ordered that [[Roman Dacia]] should be [[evacuated]], and the Romans gave him the unofficial name of {{Lang-la|Dacicus maximus|label=none}}. Then he moved further east and overcame [[Zenobia]] in war. Aurelian took control of [[Palmyra]] in summer 272. Because of his victories in the east – against the Persians, in Arabia, and at Palmyra – Aurelian got the names {{Lang-la|Parthicus maximus|label=none}} (or {{Lang-la|Persicus maximus|label=none}}); {{Lang-la|Arabicus maximus|label=none}}; and {{Lang-la|Palmyrenicus maximus|label=none}}. From 272, Aurelian also had the [[title]] {{Lang-la|Imperator Orientis|lit=the emperor of the East|label=none}}. The writing of the [[Justinianic Code]] makes it possible that Aurelian was in [[Byzantium]] during winter 272–273. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 === 273–275 === 
 In 273 Aurelian fought a war against the [[Carpi]]. His victories meant that Aurelian got the name {{Lang-la|Carpicus maximus|label=none}}. That year, Aurelian also fought a second campaign against the armies of Palmyra. The ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' (a Latin history) says that during 273, [[Firmus (3rd-century usurper)|Firmus]], a rich man from [[Seleucia Pieria]], started a rebellion against Aurelian. Firmus did not say that he was the emperor. His rebellion did not have success. The Greek historian Zosimus writes that Aurelian held a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in [[Rome]] to celebrate his [[Victory|victories]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 In 274, Aurelian was Roman consul for the second time. In the middle of 274, Aurelian overcame the armies of [[Tetricus]]. At this Tetricus's [[Rebellion|rebel]] [[Gallic Empire]] came to its end. The writings of [[Aurelius Victor]] say that in autumn that year Aurelian held another Roman triumph. The Romans called Aurelian {{Lang-la|restitutor orbis|lit=the restorer of the world|label=none}}. That year, probably on the 29 August 274, Aurelian's wife Ulpia Severina became ''augusta'' (empress). In the same year, Aurelian [[Dedication|dedicated]] the new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|Temple of the Sun]] in Rome to the god [[Sol Invictus]], possibly on 25 December, the [[winter solstice]]. Aurelian was Roman consul for the third time in 275. In 275, Aurelian set out through [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] and passed [[Vindelicia]] on his way to the Roman lands around the [[Danube]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Death == 
 On his way east in September 275 (or possibly in October), soldiers in Aurelian's army [[killed]] Aurelian at [[Caenophrurium]]. Caenophrurium was a place between [[Perinthus]] and [[Byzantium]] in Roman [[Thracia]]. There may have been a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Aurelian: his name was removed from some [[inscriptions]]. However, the Romans later [[deified]] Aurelian (making him into a god). He got a new name in {{Lang-la|Divus Aurelianus|lit=the Divine Aurelian}}. Aurelian's wife, the ''augusta'' Ulpia Severina, may have been in control of the government until [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]] became emperor. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Family == 
 Aurelian and [[Ulpia Severina]] married at an unknown date. She was the daughter of a man named Ulpius Crinitus. The ''Historia Augusta'' says that Aurelian and Ulpia Severina had a daughter together. After 29 August 274, Ulpia Severina became ''augusta'' (empress) and had the Latin title: {{Lang-la|mater castrorum et senatus et patriae|lit=mother of the camp and of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and of the fatherland|label=none}}. When Ulpia Severina died is unknown. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Aurelian had a sister. She is in the Latin histories (the ''Historia Augusta'', [[Eutropius]], and the ''Epitome de Caesaribus'') but her name is unknown. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
