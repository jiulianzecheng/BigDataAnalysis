 '''''Colobus''''' are a [[genus]] of [[monkeys]] [[indigenous (ecology)|native]] to [[Africa]]. < ref > Groves C.P. 2005. Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D.M. (eds) ''Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference''. 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 167–168. {{ISBN|0-801-88221-4}} < /ref >  The word  " colobus "  comes from Greek κολοβός which means  " docked " . This refers to their thumbs, which are just stumps. 
 
 Colobus are [[herbivorous]]. They eat [[leaves]], [[fruit]], [[flowers]], and [[twig]]s. Their [[habitats]] include primary and secondary [[forests]], [[river]]ine forests, and wooded [[grasslands]]. Their [[ruminant]]-like [[digestive system]]s help them occupy [[niche]]s which other [[primates]] do not live in. 
 
 Colobus live in territorial groups of about nine individuals, with a single male with a number of females and their offspring. Newborn colobus are completely white. Mothering is shared: other members of the troop the biological mother care for an infant. 
 
 Colobus are eaten regularly by the [[common chimpanzee]]. [[Jane Goodall]] discovered that chimps hunt and eat smaller primates such as ''Colobus'' monkeys. She watched a hunting group isolate a colobus high in a tree, block all possible exits, then a chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. < ref name= " Goodall " > The Jane Goodall Institute: [http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp_central/default.asp  " Chimpanzee Central " ], 2008. < /ref >  The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours. < ref name= " Goodall " / >  The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as ''one-third of the colobus population'' in the park each year. < ref name= " PBS " > {{cite web |publisher=[[PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/jane-goodalls-wild-chimpanzees/introduction/1908/ |title=Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees |year=1996 |access-date=2010-07-28}} < /ref >  This was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior.
