In '''Theocracy''', a form of [[government]], the [[institution]]s and people that govern the [[state]] are very close to the [[leader]]s of the main [[religion]] or are religious leaders themselves. If the religious leaders do not directly run some bodies of the state, they influence them very much. The word theocracy comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words literally meaning [[God]]-[[government]], and meaning the government is run by  " The Church " . 
 
 == Modern-day states that are theocracies == 
 === Andorra === 
 The [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bishop]] of [[Urgell]] as the Co-[[Prince]], is one of the two [[head of state|heads of states]] of [[Andorra]] (the other Co-Prince as head of state is the [[President of France]]). His role is mostly ceremonial, and while Roman Catholicism is the [[official religion]] of the country, it is not a theocracy. 
 
 === Iran === 
 [[Iran]] is a theocratic [[Islamic republic]]. In Iran, two bodies, the [[Supreme Leader]] and [[Guardian Council]] consist of members who are not elected by the people. These two bodies are staffed by [[Shia]] [[cleric]]s. The highest elected official is the [[President of Iran]]. 
 
 [[Mohammad Khatami]], the former president, said that this model is an alternative to democracy, as it brings in religious elements. He called it a [[religious democracy]]. 
 
 === Vatican City === 
 The [[Vatican City]] is a true theocracy, with no [[separation of church and state]]. The head of the [[Catholic Church]] is the leader of the country.  The [[pope]] is elected by the [[Papal conclave|Papal Conclave]].   < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM|title=1917 Code of Canon Law|author=Benedict XV|website=CIC 1917|publisher=|accessdate=30 Dec 2016}} < /ref >  Most popes have stayed for the rest of their lives, but some have resigned.  One who resigned was [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. 
 
 == State religion == 
 Many states have a [[state religion]] (also called official religion). [[Israel]], for example mixes some aspects of [[rabbinical law|Halakha]] and [[civil law]], even though [[Judaism]] is not a state or official religion of the country. Also, the state hires [[rabbi]]s. In some such states, religious leaders also have civil duties, not only religious ones. 
 
 == Some historic theocratic states == 
 
 Some (now extinguished) states throughout history had characteristics of a Theocracy, as for example:  
 
 * In [[Ancient Egypt]] the [[Pharaoh]] was a god. 
 * In the [[Empire of Japan]] (1868 - 1947), [[Shinto]], the [[indigenous]] religion of Japan, was the official [[state religion]] ([[State Shinto]]), besides, the [[Emperor of Japan]] was worshipped, and viewed as, a [[Demigod|living deity]].  
 * [[Bhutan]] was formerly governed as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] theocracy.  
 * Though the [[Byzantine Empire]] was not ''[[de facto]]'' a theocracy, it was [[caesaropapist]], and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and in matters where the Church had a considerable interest, its concerns would have been taken into account and influenced the ruler's decision.
