 A '''disclaimer''' is a denial of liability for possible consequences of the some act. It connects with some risk, involves some uncertainty when you give some kind of statement arguing that it's only your opinion.  It also means warning sign.  
 
 ==Tort law== 
 In law, a disclaimer is a statement denying responsibility intended to prevent civil liability arising for particular acts or omissions. Disclaimers are frequently made to escape the effects of the torts of [[negligence]] and of occupiers' liability towards visitors. The courts may or may not give effect to the disclaimer depending on whether the law permits exclusion of liability in the particular situation and whether the acts or omissions complained of fall within the wording of the disclaimer. 
 
 A disclaimer may take effect as a term of the [[contract]] between the person making the disclaimer and the person who is thereby prevented from suing.  This kind of disclaimer is, for example, invariably found in the 'terms and conditions' that a software user is confronted with when first installing the software. There will often be term(s) excluding any liability for any damage that the software might cause to the rest of the user's software and hardware.  By clicking  " I Agree "  in the dialogue box, users are agreeing to this disclaimer as matter of contract between themselves and the software company.
