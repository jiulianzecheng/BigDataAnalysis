 '''Polecat''' is the common name for several medium-sized [[Mustelid]]s. They do not form a single [[clade]]: the name is given to several similar [[species]].  
 
 The [[European polecat]] is typical, and is the only one native to the British Isles. [[Ferret]]s are the [[domesticated]] form of European polecats. 
 
 In the U.S., the term ''polecat'' is often applied to [[skunk]]s, which are only distantly related to the European polecat. The reason is that polecats give off a [[scent]] which some people think is offensive.  
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The simplest version puts them all in a [[subfamily]] of the [[Mustelidae]]: 
 
 Subfamily '''Mustelinae''' 
 *Genus ''[[Ictonyx]]'' 
 **[[Striped polecat]], ''I. striatus'' 
 **[[Saharan striped polecat]], ''I. libycus'' 
 *Genus ''[[Mustela]]'' 
 **[[Steppe polecat]], ''M. eversmannii'' 
 **[[Black-footed ferret|American polecat]] (Black-footed ferret) ''M. nigripes'' 
 **[[European polecat]], ''M. putorius'' 
 *Genus ''[[Vormela]]'' 
 **[[Marbled polecat]], ''V. peregusna'' 
 
 There is a more recent version which splits them up even more. < ref name= " Koepfli2008 " > {{Cite journal | last = Koepfli | first = Klaus-Peter |display-authors = etal |title = Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 6 | page = 10 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7007-6-10 | pmid = 18275614 | pmc = 2276185 }} < /ref >
