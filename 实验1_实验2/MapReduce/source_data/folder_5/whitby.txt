 '''Whitby''' is a fishing port near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], in northeast [[England]].  13,213 people live there. Its name comes from the [[Old Norse]] Witebi, which means the  " white settlement " . 
 
 Whitby is on the edge of the North Yorkshire Moors.   
 
 Its [[heritage coast]] is around 35 miles (56 km) long, stretching from [[Staithes]] to [[Flamborough]]. At Whitby, [[dinosaur]] [[footprint]]s are visible on the [[beach]]. The black [[mineral]] [[jet (lignite)|jet]] is found in the cliffs and on the [[moors]] and has been used since the [[Bronze Age]] to make [[bead]]s.  In [[Victorian]] times jet was brought to Whitby by pack pony to be made into decorative items. It was most popular in the mid-19th century when it was chosen for mourning jewellery by [[Queen Victoria]] after the death of [[Prince Albert]]. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], Whitby was home to [[whaling]] and [[herring]] [[fishing]] fleets.  Now, [[lobsters]], brown and velvet [[crabs]] are important to the local fishery.  [[Tourists]] first began to visit Whitby in the 1800s.  [[Tourism]] is now the main source of income for Whitby. 
 
 Whitby's East cliff is the home of [[Whitby Abbey]].  On the West Cliff, a whalebone arch commemorates Whitby's fishing heritage. 
 
 Captain [[James Cook]], a British explorer who mapped [[New Zealand]], [[Hawaii]] and [[Newfoundland]], learnt to sail in Whitby.  
 
 Part of [[Bram Stoker]]'s story of [[Dracula]] is set in Whitby.
