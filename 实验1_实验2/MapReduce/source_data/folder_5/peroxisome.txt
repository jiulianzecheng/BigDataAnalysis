 '''Peroxisomes''' or '''microbodies''' are [[Organelle|organelles]] inside [[Eukaryote|eukariotic]] [[Cell|cells]] which are enclosed  with a [[membrane]]. They are involved in various processes, and use up [[oxygen]]. 
 
 Peroxisomes play an important role in  metabolism, reactive oxygen species detoxification, and signaling.  
 
 Peroxisomes derive their name from their use of molecular oxygen for metabolic processes. These organelles are largely associated with lipid (fat) metabolism and the processing of reactive oxygen species. The products are sent to the mitochondria for use as an energy source.
