 '''Gerbils''' are a family of [[rodent]]s. There are about 110 species of gerbils. All gerbils are adapted to [[arid]] [[habitat]]s. At one time, gerbils were known as wild '''rats'''. Most gerbils are [[diurnal]], some are [[crepuscular]]. The gerbil is native to Central Asia, India, the Middle East, and Africa. The average length of a gerbil is usually between six and twelve [[inches]], this includes the tail which makes up one half of the total length. The gerbil is also a common household [[pet]]. 
 
 Species of gerbil include: 
 * [[Fat-tailed gerbil]], whose tail gets bigger when it eats. 
 * [[Great gerbil]], the biggest type of gerbil 
 
 The Mongolian gerbil is one of around 110 species, but it is the most popular to have for a pet. The Mongolian gerbil was discovered in 1800 but was not studied until 1866. All domestic gerbils come from just a few gerbils from 1930. 
 
 A gerbil is smaller than a rat but bigger than a mouse. It depends on the species. From just mice and rats the gerbil has a tail with hair and it ends with a tassel. A gerbil is around 5-6 inches long but with the tail it is around 11-12 inches. There are bigger gerbils too like the Great gerbil who has a 7-8 inches long body and 7-8 inches long tail.
