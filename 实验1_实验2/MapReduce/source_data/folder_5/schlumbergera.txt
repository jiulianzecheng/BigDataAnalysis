 '''Schlumbergera''' is a [[genus]] of [[cactus|cacti]]. The genus includes six [[species]], originally found in south-eastern [[Brazil]]. These cacti, along with a number of [[cultivar]]s are common [[houseplant]]s. They are also known as ''Christmas Cactus'' or ''Thanksgiving Cactus''. This name refers to the time of the year when the cacti flourish, in [[Europe]]. In the wild, the cacti grow on trees as [[epiphyte]]s or rocks, and can form [[shrubs]]s up to {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} high. The cacti do not have leaves, the green stem segments do [[photosynthesis]]. [[Charles Lemaire]] first described them in 1858. It is named after [[Frédéric Schlumberger]] a cactus collector and plant breeder.
