Some [[chemical element]]s are called '''metals'''. Most elements in the [[periodic table]] are metals. These elements usually have the following traits: 
 # They can conduct electricity and heat. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Metals|first=Non Metals|date=2021-09-24|title=Metals and Non Metals|url=https://alljobs.co.in/study-material/metals-and-non-metals-class-10/|access-date=2021-12-06|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 # They can be shaped easily. 
 # They have a shiny appearance. 
 # They have a high melting point. 
 Most metals are solid at room temperature, but this does not have to be the case. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is liquid. [[Alloy]]s are mixtures, where at least one part of the mixture is a metal. Examples of metals are [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[tin]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[silver]], [[titanium]], [[uranium]], and [[zinc]]. Well-known alloys include [[bronze]] and [[steel]]. 
 
 The [[Research|study]] of metals is called [[metallurgy]]. 
 
 == The ways that metals are alike (properties of metals) == 
 Most metals are hard, shiny, they feel heavy and they [[melt]] only when they are heated at very high temperatures . Lumps of metal will make a bell-like sound when they are hit with something heavy (they are sonorous). 
 [[Heat]] and [[electricity]] can easily pass through a metal (it is [[electrical conductivity|conductive]]). A lump of metal can be beaten into a thin sheet (it is [[malleability|malleable]]) or can be pulled into thin wires (it is [[ductility|ductile]]). Metal is hard to pull apart (it has a high [[tensile strength]]) or smash (it has a high [[compressive strength]]). If you push on a long, thin piece of metal, it will bend, not break (it is [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]]). Except for cesium, copper, and gold, metals have a neutral, silvery color. 
 
 Not all metals have these properties. Mercury, for instance, is liquid at room temperature, [[Lead]], is very soft, and heat and electricity do not pass through [[iron]] as well as they do through [[copper]]. 
 
 == Use of metals ==

 Metals are very useful to people. They are used to make [[tool]]s because they can be strong and easy to shape. Iron and steel have been used to make [[bridge]]s, [[building]]s, or [[ship]]s. 
 
 Some metals are used to make items like [[coin]]s because they are hard and will not wear away quickly. For example, [[copper]] (which is shiny and red in color), [[aluminium]] (which is shiny and white), [[gold]] (which is yellow and shiny), and [[silver]] and [[nickel]] (also white and shiny). 
 
 Some metals, like [[steel]], can be made sharp and stay sharp, so they can be used to make [[knife|knives]], [[axe]]s or [[razor]]s. 
 
 Rare metals with high value, like [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[platinum]] are often used to make [[jewellery]]. Metals are also used to make [[fastener]]s and [[screw]]s. [[Pot]]s used for [[cooking]] can be made from [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[steel]] or [[iron]]. [[Lead]] is very [[heavy]] and [[dense]] and can be used as [[ballast]] in [[boat]]s to stop them from turning over, or to protect people from [[ionizing radiation]]. 
 
 == Alloys of metals == 
 Many things that are made of metals may, in fact, be made of mixtures of at least one metal with either other metals, or with non-metals. These mixtures are called [[alloy]]s. Some common alloys are: 
 * [[Steel]] ([[iron]] and [[carbon]]) (Carbon is a non-metal) 
 * [[Brass]] ([[copper]] and [[zinc]]) 
 * [[Bronze]] ([[copper]] and [[tin]]) 
 * [[Duralumin]] ([[aluminum|aluminium]] and [[copper]]) 
 * [[Gunmetal]] ([[copper]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]]) 
 
 People first began making things from metal over 9000 years ago, when they discovered how to get copper from its [[ore]]. They then learned how to make a harder alloy, bronze, by adding tin to the copper. About 3000 years ago, they discovered iron. By adding small amounts of carbon to iron, they found that they could make a particularly useful alloy â€“ steel. 
 
 == Metals in chemistry == 
 In [[chemistry]], metal is a word for a group of chemical [[chemical element|elements]] that have certain [[properties]]. It is easy for the [[atom]]s of a metal to lose an [[electron]] and become positive [[ion]]s, or [[cation]]s. In this way, metals are not like the other two kinds of elements - the [[nonmetal]]s and the [[metalloid]]s. Most [[chemical element|elements]] on the [[periodic table]] are metals. 
 
 On the [[periodic table]], we can draw a zigzag line from the [[chemical element|element]] [[boron]] (symbol B) to the [[chemical element|element]] [[polonium]] (symbol Po). The elements that this line passes through are the [[metalloid]]s. The elements that are above and to the right of this line are the [[nonmetal]]s. The rest of the elements are the metals. 
 
 Most of the properties of metals are due to the fact that the [[atom]]s in the metal do not hold onto their [[electron]]s very tightly. Each atom is separated from the others by a thin [[layer]] of [[valence]] [[electron]]s. 
 
 However, some metals are different. An example is the metal [[sodium]]. It is [[wikt:soft|soft]], melts at a low [[temperature]], and is so [[density|light]], it [[wikt:float|float]]s on [[water]]. People should not try this though, because another property of [[sodium]] is that it [[Explosion|explodes]] when it touches [[water]]. 
 
 Most metals are [[chemical]]ly [[stable]], and do not [[react]] easily but some do [[Chemical reaction|react]]. The reactive ones are the [[alkali]] metals like [[sodium]] (symbol Na) and the [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth metals]] like [[calcium]] (symbol Ca). When metals do react, they often react with [[oxygen]]. The [[oxide]]s of metals are [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The [[oxide]]s of [[nonmetal]]s are [[acid]]ic. 
 
 [[Chemical compound|Compounds]], which have metal [[atom]]s combined with other [[atom]]s to make [[molecules]], are probably the most common substances on Earth. For example, common [[salt]] is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[sodium]]. 
 
 == Metals in history == 
 [[File:Native copper.jpg|thumb|right|A lump of pure copper found as native copper]] 
 The use of metals is said to be one of the things that makes people different from [[animal]]s. Before they used metals, people made [[tool]]s from [[stone]]s, [[wood]], and [[animal]] [[bone]]s. This is now called the [[Stone Age]]. 
 
 No-one knows when the first metal was found and used. It was probably what is called [[native copper]], which is sometimes found in large lumps on the ground. People learned to make this into [[copper]] [[tool]]s and other things, although, for a metal, it is quite soft. They learned [[smelting]] to get copper from common [[ore]]s. When copper was melted over [[fire]], people learned how to make an [[alloy]] called [[bronze]], which is much [[hardness|harder]] and [[wikt:strong|stronger]] than [[copper]]. People made [[knives]] and [[weapon]]s from [[bronze]]. This time in [[human]] [[history]], after about 3300 & nbsp;BC is often called the [[Bronze Age]], that is, the time of bronze tools and weapons. 
 
 Around the year 1200 & nbsp;BC some people learned to make [[iron]] tools and weapons. These were even harder and stronger than bronze and this was an advantage in [[war]]. The time of iron tools and weapons is now called the [[Iron Age]] 
 . 
 Metals have been very important in [[human]] [[history]] and [[civilization]]. Iron and steel were important in the making of [[machine]]s. [[Gold]] and [[silver]] were used as [[money]] in order to allow people to [[trade]], that is, [[exchange]] [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[service]]s over long [[distance]]s. 
 
 == Metals in astronomy == 
 In [[astronomy]], a metal is any [[chemical element|element]] other than [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]]. This is because these two elements (and sometimes [[lithium]]) are the only ones that form outside [[star]]s. In the [[sky]], a [[spectrometer]] can see the signs of metals and show the [[astronomer]] the metals in a [[star]]. 
 
 == Biological role in humans == 
 In [[Human|humans]], some metals are [[Essential nutrient|essential nutrients]] like [[iron]], [[cobalt]], and [[zinc]]. Some metals can be harmless such as [[ruthenium]], [[silver]], and [[indium]]. Some metals can be [[toxic]] in large amounts. Other metals such as [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]], are very [[poisonous]]. Sources of [[Metal toxicity|metal poisoning]] include [[mining]], tailings, [[Industrial waste|industrial wastes]], agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, [[Paint|paints]] and treated timber.
