 '''Ovens''' are closed, heated [[container]]s which are used for heating, baking, and drying. It is used the most often in [[cooking]] and [[pottery]]. They provide even, dry heat to all surfaces of [[food]] inside them. An indoor oven can have an [[electric]] heating element, or be fired by [[natural gas]] or [[coal]]. Outdoor ovens are often made of [[brick]] or [[clay]] and are buried in hot coals. An oven which is used for making [[pottery]] is called a [[kiln]]. An oven used for heating or industrial processes is called a [[furnace]]. They are hot inside, and often things come out of them hot.
