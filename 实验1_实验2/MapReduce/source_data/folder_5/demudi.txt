 '''DeMuDi''' (''Debian Multimedia Distribution'') was a [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Debian]] with improvements for music, sound and video production.  
 
 DeMuDi was developed by the [[AGNULA]] Project, a [[European Union]] funded project to improve access to multimedia software, and was also known as A/DeMuDi, with A standing for Agnula. 
 
 When funding stopped volunteers continued to work on the project for a short time, but now it is part of the [[Debian Multimedia Project]].
