 Mussolini invented fascism in [[Italy]] in the late 1910s, and developed it fully in the 1930s. He came to power in late 1922 and introduced a complete dictatorship in the mid-1920s, by eliminating all other parties and changing the electoral law to make sure his Fascist party got the most seats. < ref > Griffin, Roger. 1995.

He started writing it in 1927, but it was only published in 1932. Most of it was probably written by [[Giovanni Gentile]], an Italian philosopher who joined fascism and became an important influence. 
 
 ==Main ideas== 
 Not all scholars agree on what fascism is. Philosopher Jason Stanley of Yale University says it is  " a cult of the leader who promises national restoration in the face of humiliation brought on by supposed communists, Marxists and minorities and immigrants who are supposedly posing a threat to the character and the history of a nation. "  That is, fascism focuses on one person as leader, fascism says communism is bad, and fascism says that at least one group of people is bad and has caused the nation's problems. This group could be people from other countries or groups of people within the country. < ref name=NPRS > {{cite news|title=Fascism Scholar Says U.S. Is 'Losing Its Democratic Status'|accessdate=October 10, 2020|author1=Silva, Christiana|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/09/06/910320018/fascism-scholar-says-u-s-is-losing-its-democratic-status?utm_source=facebook.com & utm_medium=social & utm_campaign=npr & utm_term=nprnews & utm_content=20200906 & fbclid=IwAR2UG4PHTB3Hou7r5D6mx29oftHwYqg2H3kjdbhsGeCqga99n7NMY71nlCc|journal=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR|date=September 6, 2020|author2=James Doubek}} < /ref >  Under Hitler's fascist Germany, the government blamed [[Jews]], communists, homosexuals, the disabled, [[Roma people|Roma]] and other people for Germany's problems, arrested those people, and [[holocaust|took them to camps to be killed]].

 ==Name== 
 [[File:Fasces2.png|thumb|100px|left|A fasces]] 
 The name fascism comes from the Italian word ''fascio'' for ''bundle''. This word comes from the Latin word ''fasces'' which was an axe surrounded by a bundle of sticks. In [[Ancient Rome]], leaders carried the fasces as a symbol of their power. < ref name=Time / > 
 
 ==Origins== 
 A journalist named Benito Mussolini invented fascism. He started Italy's fascist party in 1919. < ref name=BBCMag > {{cite news|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/benito-mussolini-il-duce-first-20th-century-european-fascist-italian-dictator/|accessdate=October 10, 2020|title=How Italian dictator Benito Mussolini became the first face of fascism|journal=History Extra|publisher=BBC|date=October 6, 2020}} < /ref >  He became Italy's [[prime minister]] in 1922. < ref name=Time / >  He was not elected. His supporters walked into Rome in large numbers, and the king of Italy made him prime minister. Although, officially, the fascist party in Italy was ruled by a  " grand council "  from 1922 until the end of [[World War II]], < ref > {{cite book |url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199295678.001.0001/acref-9780199295678-e-799 |title=Fascist Grand Council |first= |last=|work=Oxford Reference |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929567-8 |accessdate=11 March 2014}} < /ref >  [[Benito Mussolini]] really had almost all the power in the country. 
 
 According to scholar Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Mussolini believed [[democracy]] had failed. He had been a [[Socialism|Socialist]] but left the movement because he thought it was not strong enough, and it had refused to join the [[First World War]]. He believed democracy failed because of [[social class]] and was too weak to stand against [[Communism]]. Under fascism, people would focus on the nation and people would not [[class consciousness|think about social class]] but instead pull together for the national good. < ref name=Time / > 
 
 However, Mussolini also believed that to make fascism work, he and his followers had to remove anything that could distract people from the nation. He also believed he should get to decide who in Italy counted as part of the Italian nation and he should get to throw out or arrest anyone he said did not consider real Italian. He believed it was right to use violence to remove those distractions and those people. Groups of people with weapons would go out into the streets and beat up or even kill people Mussolini did not like. < ref name=Time / > 
 
 Mussolini did not [[free press|allow journalists to write what they wanted]]. < ref name=BBCMag / > 
 
 Mussolini believed that Italy should be made of white people, so he encouraged white women to have more babies and persecuted people who were not white. < ref name=Time / > 
 
 ==Fascism vs other types of totalitarianism== 
 One of the reasons fascism spread in the early 20th century was because the [[Russian Revolution]] had just happened and people were afraid of [[communism]]. Sometimes landowners and business owners would support fascists because they were afraid of what would happen if the country became communist instead. < ref name=Time / > 
 
 In her work, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', published in 1951, [[Hannah Arendt]] compared National Socialism, [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]]. She does not talk about these regimes being fascist; according to her, they are totalitarian. In 1967, German philosoper [[JÃ¼rgen Habermas]] warned about a  " [[left-wing fascism]] "  of a protest movement in Germany of the 1960s, commonly known as [[Ausserparlametarische Opposition]], or APO. 
 
 ==Opposition== 
 There is more than one reason why people living in democratic states oppose fascism, but the main reason is that in a Fascist government the individual citizen doesn't always have the option to vote, nor do they have the option to live a lifestyle which may be seen as immoral, useless, and unproductive towards society. If you are not heterosexual (homosexual, cross-dressing, changing genders, etc.) you can be arrested and put on trial. 
 
 ==20th century== 
 The fascist governments in Italy, Germany, and Japan were removed after they lost [[World War II]], but fascism continued as [[military dictatorships]] under [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] in [[Portugal]], [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in [[Spain]], in some parts of [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]]. 
 
 ==21st century== 
 In the 21st century, fascist political movements exist in many countries. < ref name=Time / >
