 '''KGB'''  < ref > [[transliteration]] of  " КГБ " < /ref >  is the Russian-language abbreviation for '''State Security Committee'''. < ref > [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{Audio|ru-KGB.ogg|'''Комите́т госуда́рственной безопа́сности'''}}; ''Komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti'' < /ref >   It was the main internal security agency for the [[Soviet Union]] from 1954 until its break-up in 1991.  It was formed in 1954 as a successor of earlier agencies, the [[Cheka]], [[NKVD]], and [[MGB]], after the deaths of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] in 1953.  
 
 During the [[Cold War]], the KGB suppressed  " ideological subversion " . This meant suppressing unorthodox political and religious ideas, and the people who held those ideas. It was Soviet policy for the KGB (and the secret services of the [[satellite state]] < nowiki/ > s) to monitor public and private opinion, internal [[subversion]] and possible counter-revolutionary plots in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. 
 
 The KGB was instrumental in crushing the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], and the [[Prague Spring]] of  " [[socialism with a human face|Socialism with a Human Face]] " , in 1968 [[Czechoslovakia]]. A record of some of its doings is contained in the [[Mitrokin Archive]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/andrew-sword.html |title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the secret history of the KGB |author=Christopher Andrew  |work= The New York Times }} < /ref > 
 
 == Different stages == 
 From 13 March 1954 to 6 November 1991, KGB was the main name for the main [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[security agency]], [[intelligence agency]] or spy agency, and the [[secret police|secret police agency]]. 
 
 In March 1953, [[Lavrenty Beria]] merged the [[MVD]] and the [[MGB (USSR)|MGB]] into one agency{{mdash}}the MVD.  In December of that year, Beria and six associates were executed and the MVD split. The re-formed MVD retained its police and law enforcement powers, while the second, new agency, the KGB, did the internal and external security functions, and reported to the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].  
 
 On 5 July 1978 the KGB was renamed as the  " KGB of the [[Soviet Union]] " , with its chairman holding a ministerial council seat.  The KGB ended when its chief, Colonel-General [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], used the KGB's resources to help the August 1991 [[coup]] attempt to overthrow Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. On 23 August 1991 Colonel-General Kryuchkov was arrested, and General [[Vadim Bakatin]] was appointed KGB Chairman{{mdash}}and mandated to dissolve the KGB of the Soviet Union. On 6 November 1991, the KGB officially ceased to exist, although Russia's new national security organisation, the Russian ''[[FSB (Russia)|Federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti]]'' (FSB), works in the same things that the Soviet KGB did. 
 
 [[Belarus]] is the only post-Soviet Union era country where the national security organization is still called  " KGB " . Belarus is where [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] started a group called the [[Cheka]], which was an organization in the [[Soviet Union]] before the MVD or the KGB was started.
