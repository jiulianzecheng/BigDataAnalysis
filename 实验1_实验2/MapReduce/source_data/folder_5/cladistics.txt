 '''Cladistics''' is the method of classifying [[organism]]s into groups called '''clades'''. 
 
 A clade ([[Greek language|Greek]] = branch) is a group of [[organism]]s with a common [[ancestor]] and all its [[wikt:descendant|descendant]]s (and nothing else). Such a clade is [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. < ref name=Hennig > Hennig, Willi 1979. ''Phylogenetic systematics''. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. {{ISBN|0-252-06814-9}}. < /ref >  The term 'clade' was coined by English biologist [[Julian Huxley]]. 
 
 ==Examples== 
 [[Bird]]s, [[dinosaur]]s, [[crocodile]]s, and all other descendants (living or extinct) of their most recent common ancestor form a clade. < ref > [http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary_popup.php?word=clade Glossary entry  " clade " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213233433/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary_popup.php?word=clade |date=2015-02-13 }} Understanding Evolution. 2010. University of California Museum of Paleontology. < /ref >  In the terms of [[systematics|biological systematics]], a clade is a single branch on the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], a [[monophyletic]] group. [[Biological classification]] needs such a natural group of organisms to be put together and given a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] name. 
 
 This brings classification in line with [[phylogeny]] (how living things [[Evolution|evolved]]). In cladistics, clades are the only acceptable units.

 Some versions of cladistics have been the subject of controversy. < ref name=Mayr > Mayr, Ernst 1982. ''The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution and inheritance''.

 ==History of cladistics== 
 The term ''clade'' was introduced in 1958 by [[Julian Huxley]], ''cladistic'' by Cain and Harrison in 1960, and ''cladist'' (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by Mayr in 1965. < ref > Dupuis, Claude 1984. Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought. ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''15''': 1–24. ISSN 0066-4162 < /ref >  Hennig referred to his own approach as ''phylogenetic systematics''. < ref name=Hennig/ >  From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1980s cladistics remained a minority approach to classification. 
 
 In the 1990s it rapidly became the dominant method of classification in [[evolutionary biology]]. [[Computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of [[Information|data]] about organisms and their characteristics ([[Trait (biology)|traits]]). At about the same time the development of effective [[sequence analysis]] techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to [[biochemical]] and [[Molecular biology|molecular]] features of organisms as well as to anatomical ones. < ref > Baron C.  &  Høeg J.T. 2005. Gould, Scharm and the paleontological perspective in evolutionary biology. In Koenemann S.  &  Jenner R.A. ''Crustacea and arthropod relationships''. CRC Press, 3–14. {{ISBN|978-0-8493-3498-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LalmQ4346O0C & q=Nielsen,+C.+2001+%22Animal+evolution%22+Chelicerata] retrieved 2008-10-15 < /ref > 
 
 For some decades in the mid to late twentieth century, a commonly used methodology was [[numerical taxonomy]]. < ref name=Mayr/ > < sup > p221 < /sup >  This made no attempt to resolve [[phylogeny]], only similarities. The weakness of this approach was that it left out the connection between classification and evolution. < ref name=Ridley/ > 
 
 ==Phylogenetic nomenclature== 
 Phylogenetic nomenclature is a way of giving names to the groups (clades) that have been decided on by cladistic methods. It differs in many ways from Linnaean nomenclature. < ref > {{Citation|last=Hennig|first=Willi|title='Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification': a reply to Ernst Mayr|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=244–256|year=1975|postscript=.|doi=10.2307/2412765|jstor=2412765|authorlink=}} The paper to which he was responding is reprinted in Mayr, Ernst 1976.

 ==Monophyly and paraphyly== 
 Monophyly is defined differently in [[evolutionary biology]] and cladistics. In evolutionary biology, the term [[monophyletic]] refers to a group of organisms descended from its most recent common ancestor. < ref > Mayr E.  &  Ashlock P.D. 1991. ''Principles of systematic zoology''. 2nd ed, McGraw-Hill. < /ref >  A monophyletic group may include all or only a part of the descendants of the common ancestor. The ancestor may be a [[taxon]] of various ranks. 
 
 In cladistics, by contrast, a monophyletic group is a group consisting of all the inferred descendants of an ancestral species. < ref name=Hennig/ > < ref > Judd W.S. ''et al'' 2002. ''Plant systematics; a phylogenetic approach''. 2nd ed, Sunderland MA: Sinauer. < /ref > 
 
 In cladistics, a group that includes only some of the descendants of the ancestral species is not monophyletic but [[paraphyletic]]. The objective of cladistics is to block out monophyletic clades. Therefore, the elements of a paraphyletic group must be rearranged so that they do form one or several clades. Degree of similarity is not a criterion in grouping organisms into clades. 
 
 == A distinction == 
 [[Cladogram]]s show who's related to what, and [[evolutionary]] trees show which evolved from whom.
