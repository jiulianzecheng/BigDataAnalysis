 A '''parsec''' is a unit of distance used in [[astronomy]]. It is the distance that light travels in 3.26 years, or just under 31 trillion kilometres (about 19 trillion miles).  
 
 This is from the [[definition]]: a parsec is the distance from the Sun to an object which has a [[parallax]] [[angle]] of one [[arcsecond]]. The technique used in the calculation is [[trigonometry]].  
 
 It takes 3.26 years for the light to come from a parsec away.
