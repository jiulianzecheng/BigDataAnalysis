'''Instantons''' are like shortcuts in the world of [[Subatomic particle|sub atomic particle]] < nowiki/ > s. They're important in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and [[Field (physics)|field theory]] because they represent special solutions to certain [[Equation|equations]] that sub atomic particles can follow to reach their destinations faster than might otherwise be expected. It's as if sub atomic particles can instantly [[Teleportation|teleport]] from one point to another, but magical as they sound , these teleportation-like movements are allowed by the rules of quantum physics. < ref > Instantons in Gauge Theories.
