 '''Wassily  Kandinsky'''  < ref > Pronounce ''''V'''assily', but German spelling was chosen by him. (Russian: Василий Кандинский) < /ref >  ({{OldStyleDate|16 December|1866|4 December}} – 13 December 1944) was a [[Russia]]n [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]] and art [[theory|theorist]]. 
 
 He was one of the most important 20th-century artists. He was a major figure in [[modern art]] and painted some of the first modern [[abstract art|abstract]] works. < ref > [[Manierre Dawson]] may have been the first: Ploog, Randy J., Myra Bairstow and Ani Boyajian 2011. ''Manierre Dawson (1887-1969): a catalogue raisonné''. The Three Graces in association with Hollis Taggart Galleries, New York. < /ref >  His art changed several times during his life. It was [[Fauvism|fauvist]], abstract, [[Expressionism|expressionist]] and [[Constructivism|constructivist]] in turn. 
 
 == Life == 
 Born in [[Moscow]], Kandinsky spent his childhood in [[Odessa]]. He enrolled at the [[University of Moscow]] and chose to study [[law]] and [[economics]]. Quite successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of [[Roman Law]]) at the [[University of Tartu|University of Dorpat]]—he started painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30. 
 
 In 1896 he settled in [[Munich]] and studied first in a private school, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He went back to Moscow in 1914 after [[World War I]] started. He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921. There he taught at the [[Bauhaus]] school of art and architecture from 1922 until the [[Nazism|Nazis]] closed it in 1933. He then moved to [[France]] where he lived the rest of his life, and became a French citizen in 1939.  He died at [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in 1944. 
 
 == Influences == 
 Later in life he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] research group which travelled to the Vologda region north of [[Moscow]]. In ''Looks on the Past'', he tells how the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that, on entering them, he felt he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), can be seen in much of his early work. 
 
 He was interested in geometry in art and philosophy. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares. < ref > Wassily Kandinsky 1910.
