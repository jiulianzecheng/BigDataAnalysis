 A '''ringfort''', '''ring fort''' or '''ring fortress''' is a [[fortification|fortified]] [[Human settlement|settlement]]. Ring forts were made to protect [[village]]s, mostly in the [[Middle Ages]]. In [[Ireland]] where many such forts can be found, they are also known as '''''ráth, caiseal, cathair''''' and '''''dún''''' in the early Irish sources. 
 
 A ''ráth'' (anglicised rath), was made of [[soil|earth]], ''caiseal'' (northwestern Ireland, anglicised cashel) and ''cathair'' (southwestern Ireland) were built of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. A ''dun'' is a more prestigious site, the seat of some kind of ruler, the term is applied to [[promontory fort]]s as well.
