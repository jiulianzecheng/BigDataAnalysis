 '''Rawon''' is a type of [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[beef]] soup from [[East Java]]. This dish has a history of more than 1,000 years and is known as a typical [[East Java|East Javanese]] food. It gets its dark color and nutty taste from the black [[Pangium|keluak nut]], which is the main [[spice]] used. The [[soup]] is made by mixing [[garlic]], [[Shallot|shallots]], keluak, [[ginger]], candlenut, [[turmeric]], red chili, and [[salt]], and cooking them in oil. This mixture is then added to boiled [[beef]] stock with pieces of beef. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yuYEak0oid4C & pg=PT64|title=The Best Soups in the World|last=Wright|first=Clifford A.|date=2011-02-04|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-06055-1|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Ephanov|first=Nikita|date=2023-10-15|title=Rawon Is The Indonesian Beef Soup That Requires A Nutty Special Ingredient|url=https://www.tastingtable.com/1416881/rawon-indonesian-beef-soup-ingredient-keluak-nut/|access-date=2023-12-24|website=Tasting Table|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 To add flavor, [[lemongrass]], galangal, [[bay leaves]], kaffir lime leaves, and [[sugar]] are included. The keluak gives rawon its special dark or black color. The [[soup]] is often topped with [[Onion|green onion]] and fried shallot and is served with [[rice]]. Other toppings can include bean sprouts, preserved salted [[Egg (food)|egg]], krupuk, and fried black-eyed peas. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0jhEAAAQBAJ & dq=Rawon+soup & pg=PA86|title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Language, Linguistics, and Literature (COLALITE 2023)|last1=Muttaqin|first1=Usep|last2=Firmansyah|first2=Dian Bayu|last3=Dhyaningrum|first3=Ambhita|last4=Prasetyoningsih|first4=Tri Wahyu Setiawan|last5=Trisnawati|first5=Ririn Kurnia|date=2023-11-03|publisher=Springer Nature|isbn=978-2-38476-140-1|language=en}} < /ref >
