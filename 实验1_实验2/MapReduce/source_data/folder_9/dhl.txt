 ==History== 
 [[File:DHL-AY06EYR.jpg|thumb|DHL semitrailer truck]] 
 ===Background=== 
 At the beginning of the mass adoption of containers for shipping goods in the 1960s, mail services, mostly monopolies, were inefficient. The cargo documents related with the contents of the containers often also traveled by ship, so they arrived after the cargo, causing the accumulation of containers in the ports. 
 ===Establishment=== 
 Between the three founders, they came up with the idea of delivering shipping papers early, by plane, from [[San Francisco]] to [[Honolulu]]. In this way, customs formalities could begin before the ship reached port. Unloading time was reduced, saving shipowners costs. To make these shipments, the company often gave away airline tickets to travelers willing to carry a suitcase of business documents. The idea was the start of a new industry. This is the international express delivery service that was initially nicknamed  " Smuggling as a service " . 
 ===Foreign offices=== 
 From there, it underwent a great development. In 1970, DHL entered the East Coast of the [[United States]] and expanded into the Pacific in 1971. In 1974, it made its first European office in London. Since 1977, DHL has been present in the Middle East and in 1978 it opened its first office in Germany.
