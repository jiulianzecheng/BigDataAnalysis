 '''Gaborone''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Botswana]]. It has a [[population]] of 231,626 people. Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in [[Africa]]. Gaborone is on the [[Notwane River]] in the southeastern corner of Botswana. It is {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[South Africa]]n border. 
 
 The main campus of the [[University of Botswana]] is in the city. Gaborone's [[airport]], [[Sir Seretse Khama International Airport]], is Botswana's main international airport. 
 
 == History == 
 Before 1969, the city was known as '''Gaberones'''. Gaberones replaced [[Mafeking]] as the capital of the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] in 1965. Mafeking was outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate. It was in an area of [[South Africa]]. When the Protectorate became [[independence|independent]], Botswana needed a capital city that was inside the [[country]]. It had been thought that [[Lobatse]] would be the capital. It was later decided that they would create a new capital next to Gaberones, a small [[colony|colonial]] [[administration|administrative]] [[settler|settlement]]. 
 
 The original name, Gaberones, is from Gaborone's Village. It was named after Chief [[Kgosi Gaborone]] of the [[BaTlokwa]] tribe. His village, now called [[Tlokweng]], was just across a [[river]] from the  " Government Camp "  (colonial [[government]] [[headquarter]]s).  " Gabs "  is still a common [[nickname]] for Gaborone. A newer nickname for Gaborone is G-City. 
 
 The centre of the city was constructed in three years. It includes Assembly [[building]]s, government offices, a [[energy|power]] station, a [[hospital]], [[school]]s, a [[radio|radio station]], a [[telephone|telephone exchange]], [[police]] stations, a [[mail|post office]], and more than 1,000 [[house]]s. Much of the city was in place for Independence Day on [[September 30]] [[1966]], when the county became independent of the [[United Kingdom]]. The first [[mayor]] of Gaborone was Rev [[J. D. Jones]].  The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as  " the Village " .
