 The '''Burgenland''' ([[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]]: ''Burgnlaund'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Gradišće'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Felsőőrvidék'', ''Őrvidék,'' ''Lajtabánság'') is one of the nine federal states of the Federal Republic of [[Austria]]. It is the youngest of the nine states and came to Austria after the First World War in 1921. The name Vierburgenland (Land of Four Castles) was created in 1919. It was derived from the name of the four vármegye of the Kingdom of Hungary (in German Komitate, 'counties') known in Hungarian as Pozsony, Moson, Sopron and Vas, or in German as Pressburg, Wieselburg, Ödenburg and Eisenburg. Because Pressburg was given to Czechoslovakia, the number was dropped. In 1922 the name was adopted by the province assembly.

 *''Mittelburgenland'' (middle Burgenland): Oberpullendorf 
 *''Südburgenland'' (southern Burgenland): Güssing, Jennersdorf and Oberwart 
 Sometimes Mittelburgenland is seen as a part of southern Burgenland.

 ==History== 
 In 1043 a peace treaty between Henry III and King Samuel Aba of [[Hungary]] fixed the western border of the Kingdom of Hungary along the Leitha and Lafnitz rivers, among others. The territory of the present-day Burgenland became the western border-zone of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary until the 16th century. The majority of the population was Germanic. There was also immigration  in the Middle Ages from the neighbouring Austria. During occupation of Hungary by the Ottoman Empire some parts of today's Burgenland stayed within Habsburg rule. After the Austro-Hungarian  empire was formed in 1867 Burgenland was part of the Hungarian part of the monarchy. Because 74% of the inhabitants were of German origin the area came to the new formed Republic of Austria. In the time till the Second World War many people emigrated to the United States. It is said that Chicago is the largest town of the Burgenland. 
 
 During the Nazi occupation the state was part of Styria and Lower [[Danube]]. In addition to the oppression of the Jews, the ethnic groups Roma and Sinti also suffered under the Nazi regime. The  Lackenbach concentration camp for Gypsies was in the area. 
 
 After the Second World War Burgenland was part of the Soviet occupation zone. After the Staatsvertrag it had a long border to the communist area in eastern Europe. The economic development was very slow. After joining the European Union this development became faster. 
 
 ==Politics== 
 Burgenland's provincial assembly (Landtag) has 36 seats.  The provincial government is a combination of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP). The voting age for regional elections in Burgenland was reduced to 16 in 2003.
