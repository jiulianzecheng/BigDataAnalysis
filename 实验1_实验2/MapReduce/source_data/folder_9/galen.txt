 '''Galen of Pergamum''' (129–199/217 AD) was a prominent [[Greek people|Greek]] [[physician]] and [[philosopher]] from Pergamon, a Greek city in western [[Asia Minor]]. < ref name=Aufderheide/ > {{sfn|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=63}}{{sfn|Brain|1986|p=1}} < ref name=Nutton/ >  He was an important [[medical]] [[research]]er in the [[Roman Empire]] and his [[theory|theories]] influenced [[Western culture|Western]] medical science for over a thousand years.{{sfn|Hankinson|2008|pp=1–33}} 
 
 ==Biography== 
 Galen was the son of Aelius Nicon, a Greek architect and builder. < ref name=Nutton > {{harvnb|Nutton|1973|pp=158–171}}. < /ref >  Galen invented the '[[Theory of Opposites]]' based on [[Hippocrates]]' [[Four Humours]]' theory, which helped develop medicine in the Roman age and again in the [[Middle Ages]] to include more natural-based medicine (rather than just religious medicine). < ref name=Aufderheide/ > {{sfn|Nutton|2005|pp=111–121}}{{sfn|Kilgour|1957|pp=105–117}} 
 
 Some of the [[observation]]s he made in his books were wrong as he could only [[dissect]] animals (mostly pigs and apes) and compare them to humans due to the Roman [[ban]] on [[dissect|dissecting]] human corpses. < ref name=Aufderheide > {{harvnb|Aufderheide|2003|loc=p. 5:  " Tragically, the prohibition of human dissection by Rome in 150 BC arrested this progress and few of their findings survived. By the second century AD, Galen, the Greek physician who practiced principally in Rome, popularized the humoral theory of health and disease with the aid of only two human skeletons and animal dissections but without laboratory-based opportunities for human soft (nonskeletal) tissue dissection to guide him. " }} < /ref > {{sfn|Von Staden|1995|pp=47–66}} 
 
 Later in the [[Renaissance]] period, people such as [[Andreas Vesalius]] wrote books showing that some of what Galen said was wrong.{{sfn|O'Malley|1964}} He was most famous for his discovery that proved that [[arteries]] carry blood and his [[dissection]] of a pig proved that the [[larynx nerves]] control the voice.{{sfn|O'Malley|1964}} He also proved that the brain controls the body and not the heart.{{sfn|O'Malley|1964}} 
 
 Galen was vital in the beginnings of natural medicine and is called the  " Father of Anatomy " .{{sfn|Yount|2010}} He is also called the  " Father of Medicine "  second to [[Hippocrates]].{{sfn|Pasipoularides|2014|pp=47–58}}
