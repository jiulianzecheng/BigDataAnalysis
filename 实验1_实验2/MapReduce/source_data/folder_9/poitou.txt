 '''Poitou''' was a [[province]] of France of west-central France whose capital city was [[Poitiers]]. 
 There is a [[marsh]]land called the Poitevin Mar on the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of [[La Rochelle]] and west of [[Niort]]. 
 
 Many of the Acadians who settled in what is now [[Nova Scotia]] beginning in 1604 and later to [[New Brunswick]], came from the region of Poitou. After the Acadians were [[deportation|deported]] by the British beginning in 1755, a number of Acadians eventually took refuge in Poitou and in [[Québec]]. A large portion of these [[refugee]]s also migrated to [[Louisiana]] in 1785 and following years became known as Cajuns.
