 '''Pride''' means having a feeling of being good and worthy. The [[adjective]] is '''proud'''. 
 
 The word ''pride'' can be used in a good sense as well as in a bad sense. 
 
 In a good sense it means having a feeling of [[self-esteem|self-respect]]. People can be satisfied with their achievements. They can be proud of something good that they have done. They can be proud of (or ''take pride in'') their work. They might be proud of their [[son]] or [[daughter]] or [[husband]] or [[wife]] or anyone else who is close to them and who has done something good. People can be proud of their [[country]] ([[patriotism]]). The opposite would be ''to be [[shame|ashamed]]'' of someone or something.  
 
 In a bad sense, ''pride'' can mean that someone has an [[exaggerate]]d sense of feeling good. This might mean that someone has no [[:wikt:respect|respect]] for what other people do, only respect for what he or she does. Someone who is described as ''proud'' may be arrogant. The word is used in this sense in the saying: “Pride comes before a fall” or “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.” Prov.16:18 (meaning that someone is so overconfident that he or she might soon have a disaster).
