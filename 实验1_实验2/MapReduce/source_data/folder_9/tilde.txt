{{Diacritical marks|~}} 
 The '''tilde''' ( ~ ) can be many things, such as a [[diacritic]]. Many languages use tildes. Two of these are [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. 
 
 In Spanish, the tilde, which is only put over the N ( Ñ ), makes it sound like [ɲ] (like 'ny' in ''canyon'') instead of [n]. 
 
 The tilde also appears in Portuguese where it is used to nasalise (meaning to sound them through the nose) the vowels  " a "  (ã) and  " o "  (õ). 
 
 In [[UNIX]] operating systems, a tilde represents the user's  " home "  directory. 
 
 The tilde is also used to denote when something is an [[estimate]], such as ~24 meaning approximately 24. 
 
 On most [[QWERTY]] keyboards, you can type a tilde by holding down the shift key and pressing the  " ` "  (single back quote). This key is in the upper left corner of the keyboard, below the esc (escape) key and to the left of the key that you use to type the number 1 or an [[exclamation mark]] (!).  
 
 Wikipedia [[Help:How_to_change_pages|editors]] sign their comments on [[Wikipedia:Talk_page|Talk]] pages with four tildes ( < nowiki > ~~~~ < /nowiki > ).
