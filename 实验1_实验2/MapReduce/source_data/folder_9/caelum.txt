 '''Caelum''' is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It is hard to see because it is not very bright. It means  " the [[chisel]] "  in [[Latin]]. Before, people called '''Caelum Scalptorium''', which means  " the engraver's chisel " . It was created and named by the French astronomer named Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in the 1750s. < ref name= " Caelum " > {{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |title= Caelum: The Chisel |work=Star Tales |last1=Ridpath |first1=Ian |access-date=27 January 2013}} < /ref >  The brighest star in Caelum has a [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of 4.45. < ref name= " astrostudio " > {{cite web |url=http://www.astrostudio.org/xhip.php?hip=21770 |title=Alpha Caeli (HIP 21770) |publisher=Ashland Astronomy Studio |access-date=27 January 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  This means that all of the stars in Caelum are too dark for people who live in cities to see.
