 All adult insects have six legs; and most have wings. Insects were the first animals capable of [[pterygota|flight]]. 
 As they develop from eggs, insects undergo [[metamorphosis]]. Insects live all over the planet: almost all are terrestrial (live on land). Few insects live in the oceans or in very cold places, such as [[Antarctica]]. The most species live in [[tropical]] areas. 
 
 Some people call all insects  " bugs " , but this is not correct. Only some insects are [[true bug]]s, which is a particular [[Order (biology)|order]] of insects. People who study insects are called [[entomologist]]s.

 Insects have [[exoskeleton]]s ([[skeleton]]s on the outside). Their skeletons are made out of thin, hard pieces or plates, like [[armor|armour]], made of [[chitin]]. All together, these pieces make a hard layer around the insect's body. The exoskeleton protects the insect. 
 
 The body of an insect has three main parts: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen. On the head are an insect's [[compound eye]]s, its two [[antenna]]e (they feel and smell things), and its mouth. 
 
 On the thorax, insects have wings and legs. All insects have six legs (three pairs of jointed legs) and usually four wings (two pairs). 
 
 The abdomen is the back part of the insect. Inside the abdomen is the [[stomach]], the [[heart]], and the [[excretory system]] where body wastes pass out of the insect. [[Bee]]s also have a stinger at the back of the abdomen. 
 
 == Physiology == 
 Just like our muscles connect to our bones to make us walk and stand up, the muscles of an insect connect to the exoskeleton to make it walk and move. Their muscles are on the ''inside'' of their skeleton. 
 
 Insects are [[cold-blooded]], which means that they cannot control their body temperature. < ref > Although most social insects can control the temperature of their hive or nest. < /ref >  This means that insects are not good at surviving the cold, at any rate out in the open. In the winter, many insects go into something called [[diapause]], which is the insect version of [[hibernation]]. Some insects, like [[cockroach]]es, cannot go into diapause and they will die if it gets too cold outside. This is why cockroaches love living in people's warm houses. 
 
 === Respiratory and circulatory systems === 
 [[File:Tracheal system of dissected cockroach.tif|thumb|Tracheal system of a [[cockroach]]. The largest tracheae run across the width of the body and are horizontal in this image. Scale bar: 2 mm]] 
 [[File:Cockroach tracheae supplying crop.tiff|thumb|The tracheal system branches into ever smaller tubes. here they supply the [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]] of the cockroach. Scale bar: 2 mm]] 
 
 [[Respiratory system#Anatomy in invertebrates|Insect respiration]] happens without [[lung]]s. There is a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases [[Diffusion|diffuse]] or are actively [[pump]]ed. Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called [[spiracle]]s. [[Oxygen]] gets to [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] that need it through their [[trachea]] (element 8 in diagram). 
 
 Many insect [[larva]] < nowiki/ > e live in water. Many of those have [[gill]]s that can extract oxygen dissolved in water. Others must rise to the water surface to get air which may be held or trapped in special parts of their body. < ref > {{cite book|author=Merritt R.W; KW Cummins K.W.  &  Berg M.B.|title=An introduction to the aquatic insects of North America|year=2007|publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7575-4128-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Adult insects use oxygen at a high rate when they fly. They need it for the flight muscles, the most active tissue known in biology. < ref name=W/ >  The flight muscles use oxygen at a huge rate: 100 [[cubic centimetre|ccs]] of oxygen for every single cc of tissue per hour. < ref name=Alex > Alexander, R. McNeil 1971. ''Size and shape''. London: Arnold. Institute of Biology's Studies in Biology #29, p21. < /ref >  With this system, the greatest diameter a muscle could have (and still consume oxygen at this rate) is about 0.5 & nbsp;cm. < ref name=W > Weis-Foch T. 1964. Diffusion in insect wing-muscles, the most active tissue known. ''J. Experimental Biology'' '''41''', 229–256. < /ref >  Even with special extra arrangements, insects cannot get larger than about 11 & nbsp;cm long. The largest insect bodies are about as big as a [[mouse]]. < ref name=Alex/ > 
 
 Some insects also use a molecule called [[haemocyanin]], which does the same job as [[haemoglobin]] does in [[vertebrate]]s (but less efficiently). The insect circulatory system has no [[vein]]s or [[artery|arterie]]s. The 'blood' is called [[haemolymph]], and moves around in the space called the [[haemocoel]]. The organs sit in the haemocoel and are bathed in the haemolymph. The 'heart' is little more than a single tube which pulses (squeezes). < ref name= " Gullan and Cranston " > Gullan, P.J.  &  Cranston P.S. 2005.

 === How insects grow === 
 [[File:Mantisnymph.jpg|thumb|A [[mantis]] nymph looks just like a mantis adult but much smaller.]] 
 
 Insects start life as an [[Egg (biology)|egg]]. Usually a female (mother) insect lays eggs, but a few species have live birth (the eggs develop inside the mother). The eggs are small; but they can usually be seen with the naked eye. 
 
 Although the adults are larger, they do need a [[magnifying glass]] or a binocular [[microscope]] to see the details. A professional [[entomologist]] uses a binocular microscope to identify insects, plus a printed reference work. < ref > Either a '''''key''''' (a special book to helps identify insects) such as Richards O.W. 1977. ''Hymenoptera: Introduction and key to families'' (Handbooks for the identification of British insects). Royal Entomological Society, London; or a large reference work, such as Carde, Ring T. and Resh, Vincent H. eds 2003. ''Encyclopedia of Insects''. Academic Press N.Y. {{ISBN|0-12-586990-8}} < /ref >  There are far too many insects for anyone to remember them all, and most entomologists specialise in just one or two [[Order (biology)|orders]]. 
 
 After the eggs hatch, two kinds of development may occur. Some insects have what is called 'incomplete [[metamorphosis]]'. This means that a small insect, called a [[nymph (biology)|nymph]] comes out of the egg, and the nymph looks almost the same as the [[adult]] insect. As the nymph grows, it does not change the way it looks, but only how big it is. It goes through a number of stages, called 'instars'. [[Grasshopper]]s grow in this way. 
 
 Other insects have [[complete metamorphosis]], which means that the small larva which comes out of the egg looks very different from the adult insect. Insects that have complete metamorphosis usually come out of the egg as a [[larva]], which usually looks like a [[worm]]. The larva eats food and gets bigger until it turns into a [[pupa]]. Butterfly pupae ([[plural]] for pupa) are often inside [[cocoon]]s. Inside the cocoon the insect changes the way it looks and often grows [[wing]]s. When the cocoon opens, the adult insect comes out. Many insects have complete metamorphosis, for example beetles, butterflies and moths, and flies. The adult stage of development is called the [[imago]]. 
 
 == Evolutionary history == 
 === Origin of insects === 
 The oldest known insect fossil is the [[Devonian]] ''[[Rhyniognatha]]'', from the 411 million year old [[Rhynie chert]]. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day [[silverfish]] insect. This species already possessed mandibles of a type associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, anatomical records suggest the first insects may have appeared earlier, in the [[Silurian]] period. < ref name= " EngelGrim " > {{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v427/n6975/full/nature02291.html | last=Engel | first=Michael S. |author2=David A.

 If ''Rhyniognatha'' is not an insect, then ''[[Rhyniella]]'' from the same place is the first known insect. Also 411 [[Mya (unit)|mya]]. 
 
 === Origin of wings === 
 In 2008, researchers uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300 million-year-old specimen from the [[Carboniferous]] period. < ref > {{cite web | title=Researchers discover oldest fossil impression of a flying insect | url=http://newswise.com/articles/view/545296/ | publisher=Newswise | accessdate=2008-09-20}} < /ref > 
 
 The origin of insect [[flight]] is unclear, since the earliest known winged insects appear to have been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. It seems the insects were not a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved wings. < ref name=Grim/ > 
 
 [[Pennsylvanian|Upper Carboniferous]] and Lower [[Permian]] insect orders include both [[Extant taxon|living]] groups and a number of [[Palaeozoic]] groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of {{convert|55|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} making them far larger than any living insect. 
 
 This gigantism may have been due to higher [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[oxygen]] levels, which allowed increased [[Respiration|respiratory]] efficiency. The lack of flying [[vertebrate]]s could have been another factor. Many of the early groups became [[extinct]] during the [[Permian{{ndash}}Triassic extinction event]], the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago. < ref name= " History of Insects " > {{cite book|author=Rasnitsyn A.P. and Quicke, D.L.J.|title=History of insects|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=1-4020-0026-X}} < /ref > 
 
 == Kinds of insects == 
 [[File:BIEDRONA.JPG|thumb|A [[beetle]] (ladybird or ladybug). The red part is the hard front pair of wings, or [[elytra]].]] 
 
 Different kinds of insects are put into groups called [[order (biology)|orders]]. There are about 29 insect orders. The biggest insect orders are listed below: 
 * [[Beetle]]s (order Coleoptera) have the front pair of wings changed into a hard shell to protect the back wings. 
 * [[butterfly|Butterflies]] and [[moth]]s (order [[Lepidoptera]]) have large, often colourful wings. 
 * [[fly|Flies]] (order Diptera) have only two wings. 
 * [[Ants]], [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s (order [[Hymenoptera]]) sometimes have stingers and sometimes live in large colonies (like ant hills). 
 * [[True bug]]s (order Hemiptera) have a mouth that is long and narrow, like a drinking straw. This kind of mouth is called a [[beak]]. 
 * [[Grasshopper]]s (order [[Orthoptera]]) can usually jump with their legs. Eat grass and grain plants. 
 * [[Odonata]], [[dragonflies]] and [[damselfly|damselflies]] are top [[predator]]s of other insects. Both [[aquatic]] nymphs and flying adults are [[carnivorous]]. 
 * [[Phasmatodea]], the [[stick insect|stick]] and [[leaf insect]]s, is an order which is entirely based on [[camouflage]]. It includes the world's longest insect, [[Chan's megastick]]. 
 
 All these groups except one (Odonata) are strongly connected with plants as a source of food. < ref > Southwood T.R.E. 1973. The insect-plant relationship {{ndash}} an evolutionary perpective. ''Symposium Royal Entomological Society London''. < /ref > 
 
 [[Spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and similar animals are not insects; they are [[arachnid]]s. Arachnids are [[arthropod]]s that have four pairs of legs. [[Centipede]]s are also arthropods, but not insects: they are in a [[subphylum]] called the [[Myriapoda]].

 == Insects and people == 
 Some insects can be [[Pest (biology)|pests]] to people in different ways. Some are [[parasite]]s, such as [[lice]] and [[bed bug]]s. Some of these parasite insects spread [[disease]]s, for example [[mosquito]]es spread [[malaria]]. 
 
 Many insects eat [[agriculture|agricultural products]] (plants meant for people to eat). [[Locusts]]s are an example of pest insects that eat plants in agriculture. 
 
 Some insects are used by us. Bees make [[honey]]. The [[larva]]e of some moths make [[silk]], which people use to make [[clothing]]. In some parts of the world, people actually eat insects. Eating insects for food is called [[entomophagy]]. 
 
 Many bees and flies [[pollination|pollinate]] plants. This means the insects help the plants make seeds by moving [[pollen]] from one [[flower]] to another. Some good insects eat pest insects, such as [[lady beetle]]s (or ladybirds or ladybugs) eating [[aphid]]s. Many insects eat dead plants and animals. 
 
 === Pesticides === 
 People often use [[poison]]s called [[insecticide]]s to kill pest insects. Insecticides do not always work. Sometimes the pest insects become resistant to the insecticides, which means the insecticides do not hurt them anymore. Both the [[Colorado potato beetle]] and the [[diamondback moth]] are insects that are resistant to many insecticides. 
 
 Insecticides do not only kill pest insects; sometimes many helpful insects are killed too. When helpful insects are killed, such as those that eat pest insects, the pest insects may come back in larger numbers than before because they are not being eaten by helpful insects anymore.
