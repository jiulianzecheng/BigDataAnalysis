 The '''volume''' of an object is a measure of the amount of [[Space (physics)|space]] occupied by that object, and is not to be confused with [[mass]]. The volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock, for instance. 
 
 By convention, the word volume implies a [[3-D|three-dimensional]] context where:  
 * The [[length]] is the longest distance between the object's extremities. 
 * The [[width]] (or breadth) refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length. 
 * The [[height]] (or [[depth]]) stands for the size of that object in the direction perpendicular to both the length and the width. 
 
 For objects at or near the [[Earth]]'s surface, height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical. All physical objects occupy a volume, even if some are so thin that they appear to be [[2D|two-dimensional]], like a sheet of paper. 
 
 == Units of volume == 
 The unit of volume in the [[International System of Units]] is the cubic meter, which is represented by the symbol m < sup > 3 < /sup > . 
 
 In some fields or applications, one often uses different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance: 
 
 * Everyday quantities of [[liquid]]s are often measured in units of a [[litre]], written as L, which is the volume occupied by a cubic decimetre. 
 * Large quantities of liquids, such as [[oil]], and sometimes other materials, may be measured and traded in units of [[barrel]]s. There are many different reference volumes called barrels, depending on the nature of the content. 
 
 Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: [[Imperial unit]]s such as the [[gallon]] or the [[fluid ounce]] were in widespread use within the [[British Empire]]. Some of them are still popular in the [[United States]], which also uses units like the [[bushel]], the [[quart]], the cup and the teaspoon (in cooking recipes, for example). See [[U.S. customary units]] for more examples. 
 
 == Non-conservation of volume == 
 The volume of an object is not a fundamental property of that object: it can change with environmental conditions such as [[pressure]] and [[temperature]], especially if the object is highly compressible. 
 
 The volume of a mixture of [[fluid]]s (liquids, [[gas]]es) may or may not be equal to the sum of their volumes before they were mixed.

 In [[mathematics]], the volume of simple geometric objects, written  < math > V < /math > , < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-25|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  can often be calculated on the basis of their shape and dimensions:

 * The volume of a parallelepiped of sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is ''a''  & times; ''b''  & times; ''c.'' 
 * The volume of a sphere of radius ''r'' is (4/3) Ï€ ''r'' < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 The volume of a gas is typically that of its container, but it could be ill-defined, as in the case of the atmosphere, which has no clear upper limit. The volume of a liquid is often measured by pouring it into a graduated container. The volume of a small [[solid]] can be estimated by immersing it into a graduated container partially filled with a known amount of liquid, provided the solid is not soluble in the liquid.
