 The '''Lyceum''' was originally a public meeting place in classical [[Athens]]. It became the meeting place for the discussion group or  " school "  of [[Aristotle]]. He founded the [[Peripatetic]] school there in 334/335 [[BC]]. The school was called  " peripatetic "  because they used to walk around as they discussed things. It was more like a college for young adults than what we now call a school. 
 
 The word  " Lyceum "  now means a school in most parts of Europe. Usually, it covers the last two or three years and prepares the pupils for [[university]]. 
 
 == Aristotle's school and library == 
 The school started when Athens fell under [[Macedon]]ian rule, and the 50-year old Aristotle returned from Asia. Aristotle had been the tutor of Alexander of Macedonia, [[Alexander the Great]]. < ref name= " lindberg " / >   
 In Athens, he began teaching regularly in the morning in the Lyceum. The group of scholars who took part came to be known as the [[Peripatetics]]. < ref name= " lindberg " > {{cite book |last=Lindberg |first=David C. |title=The beginnings of western science |url=https://archive.org/details/beginningsofwest0000lind_d9a5 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2007 |edition=2nd |chapter=4: Hellenistic natural philosophy |isbn=0-226-48205-7}} < /ref > 
 
 Aristotle encouraged cooperative research. < ref name= " lindberg " / >   His students were given projects as part of their studies. The school was also student run. They elected a new student administrator every ten days, which allowed the students to become involved in turn. < ref name= " NCSU " > {{cite web |url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/aristotle.html |title=Aristotle |date=Fall 2009 |work=Foundations of agricultural and extension education |publisher=NC State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences |accessdate=30 October 2009 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |archive-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125103636/http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/agexed/aee501/aristotle.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >    
 
 During his conquests of Asian regions, Alexander collected plant and animal specimens for Aristotleâ€™s research. Aristotle developed the first zoo and botanical garden in existence. Alexander may also have given money to the Lyceum. < ref name= " NCSU " / >   In 322 BC, Aristotle was forced to flee Athens with his family when the political leaders reacted against the Macedonians. Aristotle's published works supporting Macedonian rule left him a target. He passed on his Lyceum to [[Theophrastus]] and died later that year near his hometown. < ref name= " psu " > [http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/sirrobhitch.suffolk/Portland_State_University_Greek_Civilization_Home_Page_v2/DOCS/11/arischol.htm  " Aristotle's school " ]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at the Portland State University Greek Civilization website, Portland State University, n.d.
