 '''Twilight''' means either '''dawn''' (in the [[morning]]) or '''dusk''' (in the [[evening]]). 
 
 In the morning, dawn is when it is not dark any more, and the light of the sun is just starting to appear, before [[sunrise]]. In the evening, it is the other way around and that phenomenon is called dusk. At [[sunset]], the [[sun]] disappears, and darkness is settling in. Light fades away. 
 
 The following have been defined: 
 *''Civil twilight'' is when the sun is less than 6° below the [[horizon]]. It ends at sunrise in the morning or follows sunset in the evening. 
 *''Nautical twilight'' is when the sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon. 
 *''Astronomical twilight'' is when the sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon. 
 For all these definitions, the horizon is at [[sea level]].
