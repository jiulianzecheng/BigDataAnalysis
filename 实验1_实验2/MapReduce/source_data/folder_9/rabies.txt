 '''Rabies''' is a [[virus|viral]] [[disease]] that can spread to [[human]]s by [[animal]]s. It infects the [[nerve]]s and causes sudden [[encephalitis]] (swelling/pain of the brain). 
 
 The disease is almost always [[fatal]] (people and animals die from it) when the [[symptom]]s start. There is no [[treatment]] and [[:wikt:cure|cure]] for it when the symptoms occur. However, people (and [[pet]]s) who are treated with [[vaccine]]s soon after becoming infected have a very good chance to survive. < ref name= " trends "  / > 
 
 The disease is transmitted through the [[saliva]] and the [[blood]]. The usual form of getting it is a [[bite]] of a rabid [[mammal]]. [[Pet]]s, like [[dog]]s need to be vaccinated against it, in most countries. 
 
 == Spread of rabies == 
 About 99% of human rabies cases come from dogs. In the Americas, it is more common to get rabies from [[bat]]s. People rarely get rabies from other wild mammals. [[Rodent]]s do not spread rabies to people. [[Livestock]] (farm animals) can get rabies, and sometimes spread it to people. < ref name= " globalburden "  / > 
 
 Tens of thousands of people die from rabies every year. About 95% of these deaths are in Asia and Africa. < ref name= " who " > {{Cite web|date=19 January 2023|title=Rabies|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies|access-date=8 June 2023|website=www.who.int}} < /ref >  Some regions have no rabies or almost no rabies, such as Western Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, and Japan. The rates of rabies cases went down from 1990 to 2020. In 2018, the [[World Health Organization]] made a plan to end human rabies deaths by 2030. < ref name= " globalburden " > {{Cite journal|last=Gan|first=Hui|last2=Hou|first2=Xiangqing|last3=Wang|first3=Yiming|last4=Xu|first4=Gaofeng|last5=Huang|first5=Zhifeng|last6=Zhang|first6=Teng|last7=Lin|first7=Runpei|last8=Xue|first8=Mingshan|last9=Hu|first9=Haisheng|last10=Liu|first10=Mingtao|last11=Cheng|first11=Zhangkai J.|date=January 2023|title=Global burden of rabies in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2019: results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019|journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=126|pages=136–144|doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2022.10.046}} < /ref > 
 
 Most of the time, rabies comes from an animal bite or deep [[wikt:scratch|scratch]]. People can also get it if an animal licks their eyes, mouth, or an open [[wound]]. No known person has ever been infected directly by another person. A few people have been infected by [[organ transplant]]s. < ref name= " who "  / > 
 
 When an animal that may have rabies bites a person, a few things can be done. First, the animal may be killed and tested for rabies. Second, the animal may be kept alive and watched. If it does not show signs in the next few days, the person is probably safe. If it does show signs, it will be killed and tested. If the animal had rabies, the person should be treated as soon as possible. < ref name= " globalburden "  / > 
 
 == Signs and symptoms == 
 [[File:Hydrophobia_in_rabies.webm|thumb|Man with rabies showing fear of water]] 
 At first, a person with rabies will have no signs or [[Symptom|symptoms]]. They may start from one week to one year after a bite. The amount of virus and place of the bite can affect this. 
 
 The first [[Symptom|symptoms]] are fever, pain, and feelings of tingling, prickling, or burning at the [[wound]]. After that, two kinds of rabies can form. 
 
 * ''Furious rabies'' causes excited behavior, [[Hallucination|hallucinations]], poor [[wikt:coordination|coordination]], [[seizure]]s, a fear of water, and a fear of blowing air. Furious rabies causes death in 5-7 days. 
 * ''Paralytic rabies'' makes people unable to move their [[Muscle|muscles]]. This is called [[paralysis]]. It later causes a [[coma]], and death in two weeks or less. < ref name= " trends "  / > < ref name= " who "  / > 
 It is not possible to know if an animal has rabies by looking at it. Some rabid animals act [[wikt:aggression|aggressive]]: they will attack or threaten for no reason. Others may act very tame: they allow people to get near to them. Some may drool or  " foam at the mouth " . In later stages, they may have trouble moving, because of paralysis. If an animal has strange behavior, people should be very careful when coming near it. < ref > {{Cite web|date=6 January 2022|title=Animals and Rabies {{!}} Rabies {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/animals/index.html|access-date=9 June 2023|website=www.cdc.gov}} < /ref > 
 
 Fear of water is the most distinctive sign of rabies. People may panic when they see water, and have sudden muscle contractions in their throat. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Murphy|first=Nicole|date=20 October 2022|title=What is Hydrophobia?|url=https://cpdonline.co.uk/knowledge-base/mental-health/what-is-hydrophobia/|access-date=9 June 2023|website=CPD Online College}} < /ref > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 There is no cure for rabies. There is a [[vaccine]] (medicine to try to prevent rabies) against it. The vaccine was first developed by [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux]] in 1885. This vaccine used a live virus grown in [[rabbit]]s, and weakened (through drying it). The first person to be vaccinated was [[Joseph Meister]] (a 9-year-old boy who had been bitten by a dog). Vaccines similar to this are still used today, but other vaccines (growing the virus using [[cell culture]]s) are more used. Some vaccines are made with bird [[embryo]]s. 
 
 There is also a form of treatment that can be done once a person has been bitten. It needs to be done within 6 days of being bitten. There is no way to know whether someone is infected, until it's too late. Treatment starts with washing the wound. This is done to reduce the number of virus particles that enter the body. Often patients are given one dose of [[immunoglobulin]] and a certain number of vaccines, over a determined period of time, usually a month. < ref name= " trends " > {{Cite journal|last=Rupprecht|first=Charles E|last2=Willoughby|first2=Rodney|last3=Slate|first3=Dennis|date=December 2006|title=Current and future trends in the prevention, treatment and control of rabies|journal=Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1021–1038|doi=10.1586/14787210.4.6.1021|issn=1478-7210}} < /ref >  After the signs and symptoms of rabies appear, less than 20 people have survived. Only one person world-wide has survived rabies without vaccine treatment. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/jeanna-giese-rabies-survivor/|title=Medical Mystery: Only One Person Has Survived Rabies without Vaccine--But How?|last=Lite|first=Jordon|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2023-11-10|publisher=Scientific America}} < /ref > 
 
 == Prevention == 
 To prevent (stop) rabies, animals should get vaccines. It is most important to vaccinate dogs and cats. Children should learn how to be safe around animals. Wild animals should be prevented from biting pets and livestock. To stop rabies outbreaks, some countries [[quarantine]] animals that enter the country. < ref name= " trends "  / >
