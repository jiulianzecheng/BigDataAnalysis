 '''Nero''' (''Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''; 15 December 37 CE – 9 June 68 CE) was the fifth and last [[Roman Emperor]] of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. He was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.  
 
 Nero was the [[Adoption|adopted]] son of his grand-uncle [[Claudius]]. He became emperor on 13 October 54, after Claudius died. Claudius was probably [[Assassination|assassinated]] by Nero's mother [[Agrippina the Younger]]. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the [[Order of succession|succession]] of Nero before [[Britannicus]] (Claudius' natural son) could gain power. < ref name= " Levick " > Levick, Barbara. 1990.

 During his reign, Nero focused much of his attention on [[diplomacy]], [[trade]], and improving the [[Culture|cultural]] capital of the empire. He ordered the building of [[Theatre|theatres]] and promoted athletic games. 
 
 His reign included a successful [[war]] and negotiated peace with the [[Parthia]]n Empire; the suppression of a [[Boudicca#Boudica's uprising|revolt in Britain]]; and the beginning of the [[First Roman–Jewish War]]. 
 
 In 64, most of Rome was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Rome]]. In 68, the [[rebellion]] of [[Vindex]] in [[Gaul]] and later the acclamation of [[Galba]] in [[Hispania]] ([[Spain]]) drove Nero from the throne. Facing assassination, he died by [[suicide]] on 9 June 68. < ref > Suetonius states that Nero committed suicide in Suetonius: ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#49 49]; Sulpicius Severus, who possibly used Tacitus' lost fragments as a source, reports that it is uncertain whether Nero committed suicide: Sulpicius Severus, ''Chronica'' II.29, also see T.D. Barnes,  " The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories " , ''Classical Philology'' (1977), p. 228. < /ref > 
 
 Nero's rule is associated with [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/extravagance extravagance]. < ref > Galba, during his rebellion, criticized Nero's ''luxuria'', both his public and private excessive spending: Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.16; Kragelund, Patrick,  " Nero's Luxuria, in Tacitus and in the Octavia " , ''The Classical Quarterly'', 2000, pp. 494–515. < /ref >  He is known for a number of [[Execution|executions]], including those of his mother, < ref > References to Nero's matricide appear in the ''Sibylline Oracles'' 5.49—520, Geoffrey Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' The Monk's Tale, and William Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' 3.ii. < /ref >  wife ([[Claudia Octavia]]) and stepbrother. 
 
 Nero is known as the Emperor who played a [[violin|fiddle]] while [[Rome]] burned. In reality, the violin had not yet been invented, Nero wasn't in Rome at the time, and when he heard of the fire he returned to direct relief efforts.  
 
 He also [[Persecution of Christians|persecuted Christians]]. However, some [[Ancient history|ancient]] sources show that Nero was popular with the common people during and after his reign.
