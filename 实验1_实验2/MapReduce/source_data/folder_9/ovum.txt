An '''ovum''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]:  " [[Egg (biology)|egg]] " , plural: '''ova''') is the name for the [[haploid]] [[female]] [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] [[cell]], or '''''[[gamete]]'''''. Both animals and land [[plant]]s ([[embryophytes]]) produce ova.

 Ova are made and released by a female's [[ovary|ovaries]]. At [[birth]], a female has all of her eggs, and from [[puberty]], she releases an egg once a month until none are left. This is called '''oogenesis'''.  
 
 When the ovum is [[Fertilization|fertilised]] by a [[male]]'s [[sperm]], it becomes a [[zygote]], which [[develop]]s into a new [[organism]]. The ovum is fertilized inside the female body, and the [[embryo]] then develops inside the [[uterus]], being fed by the mother's [[placenta]]. 
 
 The ovum is the largest [[cell]] in the human body. You can see it without a [[microscope]]. The human ovum is between 100 and 200 [[Micrometre|Âµm]] long. They are nevertheless much smaller than the [[cleidoic egg]]s laid externally by [[reptile]]s and [[bird]]s, which is why they need a long period of internal development in the [[womb]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |title=The Ovum, Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body, Yahoo!

 === Other mammals === 
 The sexual cycle is quite different in other mammals, whose females are only receptive during the 'heat' part of their [[estrous cycle]] when eggs are released from the ovary. Sexual activity then continues for a few days, then ceases entirely until the next heat. 
 
 === Plants === 
 In many plants, ova are made inside [[Archegonium|archegonia]] through [[meiosis]]. The archegonium has a long 'neck' with the egg cell inside. When the egg is mature, the neck opens and sperm swims in to fertilize the egg. 
 
 In [[flowering plant]]s, the female gametes are made of only eight cells, called the [[embryo sac]], inside the [[ovule]]. The cell closest to the opening of the embryo sac becomes the egg cell. When [[pollination|pollinated]], [[sperm]] swims into the embryo sac and fertilizes the egg. The zygote then develops into an embryo inside the ovule.
