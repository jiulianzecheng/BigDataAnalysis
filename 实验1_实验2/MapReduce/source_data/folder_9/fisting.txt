 '''Fisting''' is a [[sexual activity]]. The fister puts his or her hand into the [[vagina]] or [[rectum]]. The fingers are then clenched into a fist or kept straight. Fisting may be done with or without a partner.

 Fistees is another form of fisting. It is for the more experienced. It may take two fists. This is called double fisting. Double fisting pleasure depends more on stretching of the [[anus]] or [[vagina]] rather than [[thrust]]ing with an in-and-out movement of the hands. < ref > Herrman 1991, p. 58 < /ref > 
 
 Fisting can cause [[wikt:laceration|lacerations]] to the [[vagina]], [[perineum]], [[rectum]], and/or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]. This may result in serious injury. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > Cohen, C.E., Giles, A., Nelson, M. Sexual trauma associated with fisting and recreational drugs.

 ==Risks== 
 Fisting can cause cutting or tearing or of the [[vagina]], [[perineum]], [[rectum]], and/or [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], resulting in serious injury < ref name= " ReferenceA " / >  and even death. < ref name= " ReferenceB " / > < ref name= " ReferenceC " / > < ref name= " Vaginal fisting as a cause of death "  / > < ref name= " Sexual Abuse and death "  / >  In general, sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot, and the risk is probably even higher during pregnancy. < ref name= " Air Embolism "  / > 
 
 Anal fisting carries risks of colorectal tearing; people doing it should use latex gloves and [[lubricant]], and have a safeword, which they can say when they want it to stop immediately. The practice, along with the insertion of hard objects into the anus or the vagina has been significantly related to the traumatization of the vaginal or rectal mucosa in increasing the likelihood of [[infection]], including [[Hepatitis]] B [[virus]]. < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=wq7fSNgUZKQC  " AIDS and behavior: an integrated approach " ], Judith Auerbach.
