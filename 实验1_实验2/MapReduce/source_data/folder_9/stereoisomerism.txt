'''Stereoisomers''' are chemicals with the same atoms as each other but different shapes.  Stereoisomers have the same [[molecular formula]] as each other but the atoms do not connect to each other in the same order. Stereoisomerism is also called  " spatial isomerism. "  Stereoisomers are so unique because of spatial arrangements of atoms. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-10-02|title=Chirality and Stereoisomers|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Chirality/Chirality_and_Stereoisomers|access-date=2021-04-10|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Stereoisomers|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/sterisom.htm|access-date=2021-04-10|website=www2.chemistry.msu.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 == Enantiomers == 
 '''Enantiomers''', are also called  " optical isomers. "  Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are like mirror images of each other but can't be turned around or moved so that they are the same, the way a right hand and a left hand of the same person are mirror images of each other. Compounds that are enantiomers to each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. Pure enantiomers also have optical activity and can be separated only with the use of a chiral agent. An optically active compound shows two forms:  < small > D < /small > -(+) form and  < small > L < /small > -(âˆ’) form. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Enantiomer - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/enantiomer|access-date=2021-04-10|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-10-03|title=Enantiomers|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Fundamentals/Isomerism_in_Organic_Compounds/Enantiomers|access-date=2021-04-10|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}} < /ref >
