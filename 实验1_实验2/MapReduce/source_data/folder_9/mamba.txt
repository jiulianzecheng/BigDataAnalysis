 A '''mamba''' is a fast-moving [[venomous snake]]s of the genus ''Dendroaspis'' (means  " tree [[Asp (reptile)|asp]] " ). < ref > {{ITIS|id=700211|taxon=''Dendroaspis''|accessdate=30 October 2012}} < /ref >  It belongs to the [[Elapidae]] family. 
 
 They are native to [[Africa]]. The [[black mamba]] is one of the well-known [[species]] and is also the most feared. Other members include the [[eastern green mamba]], [[western green mamba]] and [[Jameson's mamba]]. 
 
 == Behavior == 
 [[File:Dendroaspis polylepis by Bill Love.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A black mamba in a defensive position.]] 
 Most mambas are [[arboreal]], meaning they live in [[tree]]s. The only exception is the black mamba, which lives on land. All mamba species [[Diurnality|hunt during the day]]. They prey on [[bird]]s, [[lizard]]s and small [[mammal]]s. 
 
 There are many stories of mambas chasing humans, but these snakes usually prefer to avoid contact with humans. < ref name=NG > {{cite web|title= National Geographic (Black Mamba, Dendroaspis polylepis)|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/black-mamba.html|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|access-date=5 July 2013|quote= Black mambas are shy and will almost always seek to escape when confronted.}} < /ref > < ref name=VSOTW > {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Mark|title=VENOMOUS SNAKES OF THE WORLD|year=2005|publisher=US and Canada: Princeton University Press; Europe: New Holland (UK) Ltd|location= multiple places|isbn=978-0-691-15023-9|pages=78–79|quote=...in common with other snakes they prefer to avoid contact;...Of the three species of green mambas...;...from 1957 to 1963...including all seven black mamba bites - a 100 per cent fatality rate}} < /ref >  Humans are actually their main [[predator]]s, rather than [[prey]]. < ref name=NG/ > 
 
 Because mambas and [[cobra]]s are in the same family, they share some similarities. Like the cobra, a mamba might display a hood when threatened. However, a mamba's hood is more narrow and is longer. A mamba usually opens its mouth when threatened, so they lean forward unlike the cobra which usually stands erect. 
 
 == Venom == 
 
 All mambas are very [[Venomous snake|venomous]]. Their venom is mostly comprised of [[neurotoxin]]s, which attack the [[nervous system]]. The venom can also contain [[cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxins]] (which damage the [[heart]] muscle) < ref name=NG/ > < ref name=MambaCDTX > {{cite journal |authors=van Aswegen G, van Rooyen JM, Fourie C, Oberholzer G. |title=Putative cardiotoxicity of the venoms of three mamba species. |journal=Journal of Wilderness and Environmental Medicine |volume=7|issue=2 |date=May 1996 |pmid=11990104 |pages=115–21 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(1996)007[0115:PCOTVO]2.3.CO;2}} < /ref >  and [[fasciculin]]s (which cause [[fasciculation|muscle twitches]]). < ref > [http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Fasciculin Fasciculin] < /ref > < ref > [http://cogs.csustan.edu/~tom/bioinfo/groupwork/cobra/cobra-venom.ppt Neurotoxins in Snake Venom]{{Dead link|date=February 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[toxicity]] of the venom varies. Changes in the toxicity can even be caused by the [[weather]] or [[altitude]]. 
 
 All mamba species have similar venom, but the black mamba has the most toxic venom and is more aggressive.  
 
 Untreated black mamba bites are fatal. < ref name=VSOTW/ > < ref name='Davidson' > {{cite web|url=http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/portals/0/snake/dendroa3.htm|title=IMMEDIATE FIRST AID|access-date=2011-09-22|last=Davidson|first=Terence|publisher=University of California, San Diego|archive-date=2012-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102174433/http://drdavidson.ucsd.edu/portals/0/snake/dendroa3.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
