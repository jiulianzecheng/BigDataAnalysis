'''Medeco''' is a manufacturer of high-security [[Lock (security device)|locks]]. The name Medeco is short for '''Me'''chanical '''De'''velopment '''Co'''mpany. It is a [[subsidiary]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Assa Abloy|Assa Abloy Group]]. 
 
 The Medeco cylinder uses a rotating pin and sidebar design with angled cuts on the [[key]]s that rotate the pins, making it more difficult to [[Lock picking|pick]] than most other locks.{{cn|date=February 2012}} However, it is possible to pick a Medeco lock. In 2006, it was discovered that a set of only four [[bump key]]s could open almost any Medeco lock at that time. Newer Medeco locks require a much larger set of bump keys. These keys are referred to as the  " Four Keys to the Kingdom "  among locksmiths. Medeco is owned by the ASSA ABLOY Group, which also owns [[Abloy]] and many other lock manufacturers.
