 The '''Taliban''' is a large [[Sunni]] [[Islam]]ic [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[militant]] group operating in [[Afghanistan]]. The group formed the [[government]] of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and took military control of most of Afghanistan again in August 2021. Since the [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|Fall of Kabul]] on 15 August 2021, the Taliban again has full control of Afghanistan.

 In 1994 Taliban started a [[government]] in southern Afghanistan called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. The first leader of the Taliban was [[Mullah]] [[Mullah Omar|Mohammed Omar]]. 
 
 The Taliban governed Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. During this time, its leaders put in place the strictest forms of [[Sharia law]] ever seen in the [[Muslim world]]. < ref name= " Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=29 " > {{Harvnb |Rashid|2000|p=29}} < /ref >  Much criticism of the Taliban came from important [[Muslim scholar]]s. < ref > dead link: http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/islam-and-the-world/politics-and-economics/166241-taliban-and-al-qaeda-true-sects-of-islam.html < /ref >  For example, if a thief was caught stealing something the Taliban would cut off one of his hands so that he does not use it to steal again, no matter what it was that he stole. Many criminals were put to death quickly and without a [[:wikt:fair|fair]] [[trial]] and were [[execution|executed]] in [[public]]. Anyone who refused to follow the law was considered a [[Kafir|non-Muslim]] enemy. Every male had to go to [[mosque]] for prayer (except Afghan non-Muslims) during praying times, which is five times per day. 
 
 The Taliban became known around the world for their very bad treatment of women and girls, [[women's rights|denying them]] [[human rights]]. < ref name= " Maley " > Dupree Hatch, Nancy.  " Afghan Women under the Taliban "  in Maley, William. ''Fundamentalism Reborn? Afghanistan and the Taliban''. London: Hurst and Company, 2001, pp. 145–166. < /ref >  They also treated the [[Shia]] [[Muslim]] (who they consider [[heresy|heretics]]) and non-Muslim [[minority|minorities]] (who are [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s) very badly. Every form of [[art]], [[music]] and [[entertainment]] was strictly banned under their rule, and [[sculpture]]s, [[painting]]s, [[photo]]s, [[camera]]s, [[television]]s, etc. were destroyed. The Taliban also did [[cultural genocide]] when they destroyed the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] in February and March 2001, because they consider the display of [[human]] and [[animal]] [[figure]]s a [[sin]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.mei.edu/publications/death-buddhas-bamiyan|title=The Death of the Buddhas of Bamiyan|website=Middle East Institute}} < /ref > 
 
 After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[United States]] [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|invaded]] Afghanistan. The Taliban had been giving its ally [[al-Qaeda]] a safe base from which to operate. The [[United States government]] said that [[Osama bin Laden]] and al-Qaeda members did the attacks in the U.S. The Taliban asked the U.S. for proof of this before it would arrest them. The aim of the invasion was to remove the Taliban government from power, destroy al-Qaeda and capture bin Laden. After losing power in 2001, the Taliban had its [[headquarter]]s in Pakistan. < ref > https://www.news18.com/news/india/exclusive-pak-wants-to-control-afghan-army-isi-chief-in-kabul-to-push-for-haqqani-group-4164941.html.

 * Starting at age eight, girls and women must not be in contact with men who are not their direct family, or who they are not married with. 
 * Women must not be seen in public, without wearing a [[burqa]], and without being accompanied by a male member of the family. 
 * They must not wear shoes with high heels, so that no man can hear when they walk and be sexually aroused by the sound{{citation needed|date=September 2021}} 
 * They must not speak loudly in public, so that no stranger can hear their voice. < ref name= " rawa1 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.org/rules.htm|title=some of the restrictions imposed by Taliban in Afghanistan|website=www.rawa.org}} < /ref > 
 * All windows on the ground floor and the first floor of the house must be sealed (or walled in), so that no one can see a woman in her apartment, when he passes by on the street 
 * Taking photographs of women or making movies showing women is forbidden. This also applies to showing pictures of women in magazines, books, newspapers or in shops. This also applies to the own home. 
 * Placenames that contain the word  " woman "  must be changed (That way a  " women's garden "  became a  " spring garden " ) 
 * Women are forbidden from using the balcony or garden of the place where they live 
 * Women must not have access (or be featured in) radio, TV, media. They must not be allowed to attend public assemblies or meetings.

 == Human trafficking == 
 Several Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of [[human trafficking]]. They abducted girls and women from ethnic minorities and sold them into [[sex slavery]] in Afghanistan and Pakistan. < ref name= " Time Magazine " > {{cite magazine|date=10 February 2002|title=Lifting The Veil On Taliban Sex Slavery|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=16 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602140825/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html|archive-date=2 June 2011}} < /ref >  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writes:  " The Taliban often argued that the [[restriction]]s they placed on women were actually a way of [worshipping] and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim. " < ref name= " Time Magazine "  / > 
 
 The targets for human trafficking were mostly women from non-Pashtun ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to [[Suicide|commit suicide]] rather than become slaves.. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped. < ref name= " Time Magazine "  / >  Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants, with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses. < ref name= " Time Magazine "  / >  ''Time'' magazine writes:  " The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps. "  Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to [[brothel]]s or into private households to be kept as slaves. < ref name= " Time Magazine "  / > 
 
 Not all Taliban commanders took part in human trafficking. Many were opposed to the practice. Nuruludah, a Taliban commander, is quoted as saying that in the Shomali Plains, he and ten of his men freed some women who were being abducted by Pakistani members of al-Qaeda. In Jalalabad, local Taliban commanders freed women that were being held by Arab members of al-Qaeda in a camp. < ref name= " Time Magazine "  / > 
 
 == Taliban violence against civilians ==
