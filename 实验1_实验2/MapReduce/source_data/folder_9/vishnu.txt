 '''Vishnu''' is the supreme godhead of [[Vaishnavism]] (Para Brahman or Nirguna Brahman) in [[purana]]s. He is called ''Swambhagwan'' in the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. Vishnu is one of the three main [[Deity|gods]] in [[Hinduism]] and is the supreme being in the Vaishnava tradition and vishnu is a member of the [[Trimurti]] in Hinduism. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vishnu|title=Vishnu {{!}} Hindu deity|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}} < /ref > 
 
 Vishnu is the god of preservation. This means that he protects the universe from being destroyed. It is believed that Vishnu holds the Earth and all living [[Organism|organisms]]. According to the Hindu [[religion]], he has set foot and arrived on the [[Earth]] in nine forms called [[avatar]]s, so far with one incarnation yet to come that is [[Kalki]] at the last to be [[Kali Yuga]], to destroy evil. His most famous incarnations are [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Parashurama]], and [[Narasimha]]! 
 
 Vishnu holds a [[Lotus flower|lotus]], or ''Padma,'' the indestructible mace of Vishnu ([[Kaumodaki]]), a [[conch]] (Shankha), and the unstoppable disc of Vishnu ([[Sudarshana Chakra]]) in each of his four hands. He is known to take many disguises, but the three main forms of Vishnu are Mahavishnu Karanodakshayi Vishnu (Mahavishnu), Garbhodaksayi Vishnu, and [[Kshirodakashayi Vishnu]], the other two are the expansions of Karanodakshayi Vishnu. 
 
 == Avatars == 
 There are 10 [[avatar]]s of Vishnu (in the order they appeared): 
 * [[Matsya]] ([[fish]]) 
 * [[Kurma]] ([[turtle]]) 
 * [[Varaha]] ([[boar]]) 
 * [[Narasimha]] (half [[lion]], half [[man]]) 
 * [[Vamana]] ([[Dwarfism|dwarf]]) 
 * [[Parashurama]] (Fierce man/[[Hunter]]) 
 * [[Rama]] (developed man/fighter) 
 * [[Krishna|Krishna]] 
 
 
 The diverse branches of the Hindu Tradition accept the ninth form of Vishnu as the following: 
 
 * [[Jagannath]] (abstract form) 
 *[[Gautama Buddha|Budhha]] ([[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightened]] man) 
 * [[Kalki]] (future avatar, has not appeared yet)
