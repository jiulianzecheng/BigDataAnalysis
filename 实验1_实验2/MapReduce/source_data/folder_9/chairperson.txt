 A '''chairperson''' is a person who presides over meetings, such as a [[board of directors]] for a corporation, or any other meeting.  The chairman of a corporation is not the [[chief executive officer]], and only conducts the meetings in most companies. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|title=Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|title-link=Robert's Rules of Order|last=Robert|first=Henry M.|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-306-82020-5|edition=11th|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/robertsrulesofor0000robe_u7g7/page/22 22]|display-authors=etal}} < /ref >    
 
 Although  " chairman "  has been used for both men and women, some prefer to use the terms  " chairperson " ,  " madame chairman "  or  " chairwoman.

Rarely the chairperson is called the  " chair, "  though in educational institutions a  " chair "  indicates a specific endowed position on a faculty.
