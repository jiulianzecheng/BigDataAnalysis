A '''right''' is something a person has which people think should not be taken away. It is a rule about what a person is allowed to do or have. < ref > {{cite news

 |quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.

 Rights may be put into [[laws]], so they have [[legal]] protection. But a right can exist where most people think it is good (just).  
 
 ==Examples== 
 *Many think people have a  " right to life " .  That means that if one person kills another, the killer would be taking away the [[victim]]'s  " right to life " . It also means life should be preserved or guarded when it is threatened in other ways. 
 *People may also have a  " right to property " . It means they can own [[property]]. It also means people should not [[steal]] things from each other. 
 *In many [[Country|countries]], people have a  " right to [[free speech]] " , which means other people should not stop them from speaking their opinions. Some countries have laws which allow newspapers and television to give opinions. They can speak against their [[government]] if they wish to. 
 *People can defend themselves if other people attack them. That is called [[Self-defence|self-defense]].
