Musical tones  are different in [[duration]], [[loudness]], and [[timbre]]. < ref > {{cite book | title=Orion's Highway Across the Galaxy |edition= |author=Charles E.

 A simple tone, or [[pure tone]], has a steady noise.  A complex tone is a musical tone that is not steady. Simple tones are added together to make complex tones. < ref >
