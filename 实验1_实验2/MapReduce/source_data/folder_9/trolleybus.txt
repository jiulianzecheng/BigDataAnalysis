 A '''trolleybus''' (also known as '''trolley [[bus]]''', '''trolley coach''', '''trackless trolley''', '''trackless tram''' or simply '''trolley''') is a [[bus]] which runs on [[electricity]]. It gets its power for the [[electric motor]]s that drive the [[wheel]]s from a pair of [[power line]]s above the street. 
 
 On the roof of the bus are two  " [[trolley pole]]s "  from which [[electric current]] flows between the wires and the bus. One wire is for the positive current and the other is for the negative (return) current. 
 
 Because trolleybuses do not usually have [[engine]]s which burn [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or other [[fossil fuel]]s, they are much cleaner and quieter than  " normal "  buses. They also do not use [[Railway track|tracks]], so they are more flexible than [[tram]]s. However, most of these buses can only go where the wires go. Some are made as a [[hybrid vehicle]], or with a battery so they can go a short distance on ordinary roads. 
 
 Trolleybuses cost more money to make than other types of buses, so there are not many companies that build this type of bus. Some of these companies are: 
 *[[VanHool]] 
 *[[MAN]] 
 *[[Hess]] 
 *[[:en:Solaris_Bus_ & _Coach|Solaris]] 
 * [[Škoda Electric]] 
 *[[Neoplan]] 
 *[[Volvo]]
