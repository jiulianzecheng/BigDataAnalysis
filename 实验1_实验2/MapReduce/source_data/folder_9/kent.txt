 '''Kent''' is a [[county]] in [[England]]. It is just to the south-east of [[London]] and is on the coast.  
 
 The sea to the East of Kent is the [[North Sea]]. The sea south of Kent is called the [[English Channel]]. [[France]] is opposite Kent on the other side of The Channel. At the most narrow point, between [[Dover, Kent|Dover]], [[Calais]] and Cape Gris-Nez, The Channel is only 21 miles (34 km) wide. Dover is one of the main ports in Kent. From here many ferries sail to and from France. 
 
 == Ports == 
 Other main ports in Kent include [[Sheerness]] and [[Ramsgate]].  The [[Channel Tunnel]] goes from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Calais]] in France. It was built in the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. It is only for trains, but some of the trains carry cars and [[freight]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Kent is a very ancient county. In the 6th and 7th centuries it was ruled by its own kings. It is often called 'the garden of England' because its countryside is very green and because it produces much fruit. A lot of [[fruit]] such as strawberries are grown in Kent, and the county is famous for growing hops which are used to make [[beer]]. [[Maidstone]] is the county town because the [[local government]] for Kent is based there. 
 
 == Places == 
 Another important town is the city of [[Canterbury]]. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] is the head of the [[Church of England]]. Hundreds of years ago many Christian people would travel to the [[Canterbury Cathedral|Cathedral at Canterbury]] from their homes in other parts of Britain. This was called making a [[pilgrimage]].
