'''Serotiny''' is an [[ecological]] adaptation of some [[seed plant]]s. 
 
 In these plants, seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger. < ref name= " Lamont 1991 277–317 " > {{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=B.|author2=Lemaitre, D. |author3=Cowling, R. |author4=Enright, N. |title=Canopy seed storage in woody-plants|journal=Botanical Review|year=1991|volume=57|issue=4|pages=277–317 |doi=10.1007/bf02858770|s2cid=37245625}} < /ref >  The most common and best studied trigger is [[fire]]. However, the term ''serotiny'' may refer more broadly to plants that release their seeds over a long period of time, irrespective of the trigger or whether release is spontaneous. < ref name= " Lamont 1991 277–317 " / >  In this sense, the term is [[synonymous]] with [[bradyspory]].
