 '''Incubation''' or '''brooding''', is when [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (egg-laying) animals sit on their  [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] to hatch them. It also refers to the development of the [[embryo]] in the egg under good environmental conditions.  
 
 Since birds are [[warm-blooded]], they sit on the eggs to keep them warm. Reptiles and invertebrates are [[cold-blooded]], and so need to keep their eggs in warm places. Sometimes even birds need the help of the Sun. < ref > De Marchi G; Chiozzi G.  &  Fasola M. 2008. Solar incubation cuts down parental care in a burrow nesting tropical shorebird, the crab plover Dromas ardeola. ''Journal of Avian Biology'' '''39''' (5):484â€“486 < /ref > 
 
 Many factors may be vital to the incubation. In some [[reptiles]] for example, no fixed temperature is necessary. However, the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds, by contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but a constant and particular [[temperature]] may be necessary for successful incubation. 
 
 In [[poultry]], the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called 'brooding'. < ref name= " ekarius " / >  The action or tendency to sit on a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of eggs is also called ''broodiness''. < ref name= " ekarius " > {{cite book |title=Storey's illustrated guide to poultry breeds |url=https://archive.org/details/storeysillustrat0000ekar |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |year=2007 |publisher=Storey Publishing |location=210 MAS MoCA Way, North Adams MA 01247  |isbn=978-1-58017-667-5 }} < /ref >
