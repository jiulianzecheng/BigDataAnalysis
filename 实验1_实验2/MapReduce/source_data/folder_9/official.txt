{{wiktionary|official}} 
 An '''official''' (and, or, '''functionary''') is someone who holds an [[office]] (meaning an official position) in an [[organisation]] or [[government]]. This doesn't have to mean an office [[room]]—it can also just mean an important [[wikt:rank|rank]]. An official in government is called a '''government official''' or '''public official''' {{crossreference|(See also: [[Public administration]])}}. Officials may be [[wikt:appoint|appointed]] or [[elect]]ed to their position. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nber.org/digest/may10/w15643.html |title=Elected Versus Appointed Policymakers |author= |website= |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=10 June 2016}} < /ref > < ref > [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/functionary#google_vignette Meaning of functionary in English] Cambridge University Press < /ref >

 The term ''[[officer]]'' is close to having the same meaning as  " official "  (but has more military [[connotation]]s). A ''functionary'' is someone who carries out a particular [[role]] within an organisation—this is quite a close [[synonym]] for an official but with connotations closer to a ''[[bureaucrat]]''. A ''[[civil servant]]'' can also have a similar meaning to an official.
