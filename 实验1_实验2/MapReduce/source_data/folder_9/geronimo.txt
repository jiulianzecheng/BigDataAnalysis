 '''Geronimo''' (''Chiricahua'' '''Goyaałé''' 'One Who Yawns'; often spelled '''Goyathlay''' in English), ([[June 16]], [[1829]]–[[February 17]], [[1909]]) was a well-known [[Native American]] leader, but not chief, of the Chiricahua [[Apache]] tribe, but he was a Bedonkohe Apache. He was born in what is now the state of [[New Mexico]] and was also a respected [[medicine man]]. The name Geronimo was given to him by Mexican soldiers who either called to [[Saint Jerome]] while fighting him or transcribed his name into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] wrong. He led 38 Apache men, women, and children to resist being sent to [[reservation]]s by the United States government or being captured by the Mexican Army. He surrendered in 1886. After that, he was moved to many different forts in the [[United States]]. In [[1904]] during the [[1904 St. Louis World Fair|world fair in St. Louis]], he sold souvenirs and pictures of himself. He died in [[1909]] from [[pneumonia]].
