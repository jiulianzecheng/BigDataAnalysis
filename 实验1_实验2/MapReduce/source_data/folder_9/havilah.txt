'''Havilah''' is a land mentioned a few times in the [[Bible]]. No one is sure where it is located, although some suggestions include southern [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Armenia]], and even as far as [[India]]. 
 
 In the [[Book of Genesis]] (Chapter 2), one of the rivers that flows out of the [[Garden of Eden]], the Pishon river, flows through Havilah, which is described as having [[gold]] and other precious stones. 
 
 It is said to be populated by [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]'s grandson and a son of [[Joktan]], both of whom are named Havilah.
