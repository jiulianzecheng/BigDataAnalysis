 '''Flagellates''' are [[cell (biology)|cell]]s with one or more whip-like [[organelle]]s called [[flagellum|flagella]].  Some cells in [[animal]]s may be flagellate, for instance the [[spermatozoa]] of most [[Phylum|phyla]]. [[Flowering plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]] do not produce flagellate cells, but the closely related [[green algae]] and [[Chytridiomycota|chytrids]] do.  Many [[protist]]s take the form of single-celled flagellates. They are found in most lines of [[eukaryote]]s, and it is likely that all surviving eukaryotes developed from them.
