 '''''Euplocephalus''''' (meaning  " well-armored head " ) was a large armored [[dinosaur]], measuring about 20 feet (6 m) long; it weighed about 2 tons. Its wide head had a horny, toothless beak, small, peg-like cheek [[teeth]], bony [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], and a small [[brain]]. Among its contemporaries were the large meat-eating ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''. 
 
 [[Fossil]]s from more than 40 & nbsp;individuals have been discovered in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and [[Montana]] in the [[United States]], making ''Euoplocephalus'' the best known ankylosaurid. < ref > Arbour V.M.; Currie P.J. 2013.
