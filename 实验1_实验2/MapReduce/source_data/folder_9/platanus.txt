 '''''Platanus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[plant]]s, which mostly occur  on the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. All of them are [[tree]]s, which reach heights between {{convert|30|m}} and {{convert|50|m}}. There are eight to ten recent species of ''Platanus'', and at least three extinct ones.  
 
 In [[English language|English]], these trees are called '''planes''' or '''plane trees'''.  Some North American species are called '''sycamores''', but this name is also used for a species of [[fig]]. 
 == London plane == 
 The London plane, ''Platanus'' Ã— ''acerifolia'', is a [[hybrid]] or a [[cultivar]]. Exactly what the parents were in uncertain. It was extensively planted on [[London]] streets before [[WWII]], but is no longer in favour. The London plane is very tolerant of [[air pollution]] and [[root]] compaction (small space for roots). For these reasons it was a popular urban roadside tree. Now, however, it is indirectly something of a [[pest]]. [[Aphids]] in their millions suck [[sap]] from its leaves, and drop sugary liquid onto cars parked underneath. Older London streets have virtually no off-road parking.
