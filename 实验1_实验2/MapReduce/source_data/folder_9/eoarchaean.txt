The '''Eoarchaean''' ('''Eoarchean''') is the first [[geology|geological]] [[era]] in the [[Archaean]] [[eon]] that began 4 [[billion]] years ago, and ended 3.6 billion years ago. < ref > http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf < /ref >  Before it was the [[Hadean]] It is followed by the [[Palaeoarchaean]].  
 
 The Eoarchaean is the earliest [[Geologic time scale|period of geology]] after the solidification of [[Earth's crust]]. The abiotic origins of life ([[abiogenesis]]) have been dated to a time window from 4 to 3.6 billion years ago when atmospheric pressure values ranged from {{c.}} 100 to 10 & nbsp;bar. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Mulkidjanian |first=A.

 == Chronology == 
 It was formerly officially unnamed and usually referred to as the first part of the ''Early Archaean'' (now an obsolete name) together with the later [[Palaeoarchaean]] Era. It is the first part of the [[Archaean]] Eon, preceded by the [[Hadean]] Eon. 
 
 The Eoarchaean was followed by the Palaeoarchaean Era. 
 
 The name comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: ''eos'' (dawn) and ''archaios'' (ancient). The 1st supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] appeared around the end of this period around 3.6 billion years ago. 
 
 ==Geology== 
 A characteristic of the Eoarchean is that Earth possessed a firm [[Crust (geology)|crust]] for the first time. However, this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface. The beginning of the Eoarchaean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system: the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]. The Eoarchaean is the first phase of our planet from which solid rock formations survived. The largest is the [[Isua greenstone belt]] at the southwest coast of Greenland. It appeared during the Eoarchaean around 3.8 billion years ago. The [[Acasta Gneiss]] within the [[Canadian Shield]] have been dated to be 4.03 Ga and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008 another rock formation was discovered in the [[Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt]] in northern [[Québec]] in Canada which has been dated to be 4.28 Ga. < ref > {{cite journal |authors=O'Neil, J.; Carlson, R.
