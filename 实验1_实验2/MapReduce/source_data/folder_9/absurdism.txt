'''Absurdism''' is a type of [[philosophy]]. People who support and argue for absurdism are known as 'absurdists'. Absurdists think that the [[human condition]] is [[wikt:essential|essentially]] [[wikt:absurd|absurd]] because humans are always looking for [[meaning of life|meaning]], but are completely unable to find meaning because no such meaning exists. In philosophy, this is called ‘the Absurd’. In this case ''absurd'' means that it is not possible to be done by humans. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Pereira|first=Ansel|title=The Philosophy of Absurdism|url=https://owlcation.com/humanities/The-Philosophy-of-Absurdism|access-date=2021-07-09|website=Owlcation|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Absurdists, most notably [[Albert Camus]], believe that when human beings realize this [[wikt:fundamental|fundamental]] absurdity they have different reactions. One reaction is [[suicide]], but this is not generally considered to be a viable solution by Absurdists; suicide is in and of itself the most absurd action possible. Another reaction is to believe in something higher (Camus gave [[religion]] as an example of this, although he went on to criticize its merit as a solution to fundamental absurdity) when they see that there is no meaning they can find in the universe (which is what absurdism says is the basic state of human experience). The final reaction is to accept the absurd, and also to keep trying to [[wikt:overcome|overcome]] it. Camus believed that a human being could become happy by finding meaning in their relationship with the absurdity of their [[existence]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Camus and Absurdity|url=https://www.philosophytalk.org/blog/camus-and-absurdity|access-date=2021-07-09|website=Philosophy Talk|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Perhaps the most notable absurdist philosopher is [[Albert Camus]]. [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ideas contributed to the development of Absurdist philosophy, although he was himself an [[existentialism|existentialist]].
