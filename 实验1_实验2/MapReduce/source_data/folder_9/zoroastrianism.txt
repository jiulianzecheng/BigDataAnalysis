It is the ancestral religion of the [[Persians]]. 
 
 Zoroastrianism is a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion. The Zoroastrian [[Deity|god]] is called [[Ahura Mazda]].   The [[holy book]] of Zoroastrianism is the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Zend Avesta]]. 
 
 Zoroastrianism is also [[dualism|dualist]]. Zoroastrians believe Ahura Mazda created the good [[spirit]]s ([[Spenta Mainyu]]), and [[Angra Mainyu]] the [[Demon|demons]]. Zoroastrians believe people are free to choose between good and bad.  Choosing good will lead to [[happiness]], and choosing bad will lead to unhappiness. So it is the best to choose good. Therefore, the [[:wikt:motto|motto]] of the religion is  " Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds " . 
 
 Zoroastrianism was the [[state religion]] of Persia starting in the 6th century BC, including the [[Sassanid dynasty]]. In the 7th century AD, Persia was conquered by [[Islam]]ic [[Arab]]s, and most [[Persian people|Persians]] became [[Muslim]].

 == Basic beliefs == 
 
 These are the basic beliefs of Zoroastrianism: 
 
 There is one [[God]], called [[Ahura Mazda]].  He is the one Uncreated [[Creator]].  Zoroastrians [[worship]] only him. 
 
 Ahura Mazda created everything. There is a conflict between order (which he created) and chaos (or disorder). Everything in the universe is part of this conflict, including humans. 
 
 To help fight the chaos, people need to:  
 * Lead an active life;  
 * Do good deeds; and  
 * Have good words and good thoughts for others. 
 
 People also need to do these things in order to be happy.  This ''active life'' is the basis of what Zoroastrians call [[free will]].  They do not believe people should live on their own to find God (for example, in [[monastery|monasteries]]). 
 
 The conflict will not last forever. Ahura Mazda will win it in the end. When this happens, everything that Ahura Mazda created will be together with him again -  even the [[soul]]s of people who [[death|died]] or who were [[Banishment|banished]]. 
 
 All bad things in the world are represented as Angra Mainyu, the  " Destructive Principle " . All good things are represented by Spenta Mainyu, the good [[spirit]] which Ahura Mazda created. Through Spenta Maniu, Ahura Mazda is in all humans.  In this way, the Creator interacts with the world. 
 
 When Ahura Mazda created everything, he made seven  " sparks " , called [[Amesha Spenta]]s ( " Bounteous Immortals " ). Each of them represents a part of Ahura Mazda's creation. These seven sparks are helped by many  " lesser principles " ,  the [[Yazata]]s. Each Yazata is  " worthy of worship "  and also stands for a part of the creation. 
 
 Some [[historian]]s believe that the [[Three Wise Men]] (Magi) who visited [[Jesus]] after he was born were Zoroastrian [[priest]]s.
