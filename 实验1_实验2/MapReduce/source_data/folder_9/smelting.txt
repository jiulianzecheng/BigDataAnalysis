'''Smelting''' is the general term for getting a [[metal]] from its natural [[ore]]. Gold is an exception because it is usually found as a pure metal. Other metals, like [[iron]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[silver]], need to be got from their ore. 
 
 The process of smelting always involves heating the ore, and may also use a [[reducing agent]] like [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] or [[charcoal]]. Most ores are [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]] < nowiki/ > s or [[carbonate]] < nowiki/ > s. This process removes the [[nonmetal]] part, leaving behind the metal. Ores are not pure, so a '''flux''' is added to carry away the impurities. [[Limestone]] is the usual flux for this purpose. It removes the impurities as [[slag]]. 
 
 Beyond this, each metal has its own special methods. Producing [[iron]] from its ore is done in a [[blast furnace]]. Producing zinc or [[aluminium]] from their ores requires (in addition to heat) [[electrolysis]]. 
 
 [[Iron]] is smelted from iron ore in large reactors called [[blast furnace]]s. A blast furnace is a tall vertical structure which is fed with coke, iron ore and limestone. When hot air is blown in the blast furnace, the [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] will burn and reduce the oxygen off the ore, producing bare iron and carbon dioxide. The [[limestone]] will bind off any remaining bedrock. The iron melts in the hot temperature and is tapped off in liquid phase at the bottom. It is then worked into steel. The limestone and bedrock form a compound called slag. It can be used for making bricks, concrete or road topping. Earlier methods include [[Bloomery]]. 
 
 [[Aluminum]] is smelted in electric ovens called electric arc furnaces. The aluminum ore is poured on the bottom of the furnace and electric current is led through the ore. The temperature rises so high that the oxygen separates, leaving metallic aluminum. 
 
 [[Copper]] is poured on naked flame which burns off sulfur and other impurities, leaving raw copper. [[Electrolysis]] uses electric current to separate the copper in big pools, which contain water solution called [[electrolyte]]. An electric current is led in the pool, and all copper will gather on the electrode called [[cathode]].

 [[Metallurgy]] and especially smelting is a key to the early civilizations. The earliest evidence of copper smelting dates from between 5500 & nbsp;[[BC]] and 5000 & nbsp;BC.
