 The '''Oryx''' (also called the '''sabre antelope''') is a fast-running hoofed mammal that lives in dry regions of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] (including the Arabian peninsula). They live in [[Grassland|steppes (sparse grasslands)]], semi-deserts, and [[desert]]s. 
 
 
 == Description == 
 These antelopes congregate in herds of 8 to 60 oryx. Newborn calves can run with the herd within minutes of their birth. Oryxes have a life span of about 20 years. 
 Some people think that the [[unicorn]] of legend was based upon the oryx. 
 Many types of oryxes (including the [[Arabian oryx]] and the scimitar-horned oryx) are endangered species, mostly because of overhunting and disease.  
 
 
 == Diet and Water == 
 The Oryx is an herbivore (a plant-eater). It eats [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s and [[root]]s, spending most of its time grazing. Oryx are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. After a while, they regurgitate a partly-digested  " cud "  which they chew and then swallow for the last time. 
 This desert animal can go for weeks without water; it gets much of its water from the plants it eats.
