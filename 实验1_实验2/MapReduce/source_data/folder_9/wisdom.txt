[[File:Wither - Emblem Wisdom.jpg|thumb|250px|''The words of this old print read, in modern English: 'He over all the stars does reign That unto wisdom can attain'. In other words, 'Whoever can become wise will rule over everything.']] 
 
 '''Wisdom''' is knowing things that help a person to live sensibly and make good decisions. Wisdom is defined differently by many [[culture]]s. Some say that wisdom is something a person [[learn]]s as they grow older. Other cultures expect [[people]] to complete certain [[ritual]]s in order to get wisdom. 
 
 If someone has wisdom, they are called '''wise'''. Most cultures from the past have had special people who were supposed to be wise. People asked them for advice when they had problems because they knew things that ordinary people did not know or could not know. They were often called  " sages " . 
 
 There are many stories in Western culture in which the [[owl]] of [[Athena]] or [[Minerva]] is supposed to be a wise [[bird]].
