'''Appendicitis''' is the [[inflammation]] of a person's [[appendix]]. The appendix is a pouch at the start of the [[large intestine]]. Symptoms usually include a sharp pain in the lower right [[abdomen]]. Also, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and decreased [[appetite]] are common. < ref name=Graf1996/ >  However, about 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. < ref name=Graf1996 > {{cite journal|last1=Graffeo|first1=Charles S. |last2=Counselman |first2=Francis L. |title=Appendicitis |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_emergency-medicine-clinics-of-north-america_1996-11_14_4/page/653|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America |date=November 1996 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=653–71 |pmid=8921763 |doi=10.1016/s0733-8627(05)70273-x}} < /ref >  If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful [[peritonitis]], < ref > inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall < /ref >  and [[sepsis]]. Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis. Usually the infected appendix is taken out. 
 
 The function of the appendix in [[apes]] is the [[digestion]] of vegetable matter such as leaves. Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus. Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our [[immune system]] does not serve it well. An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body. 
 
 The causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or [[bacterial]] [[Infection|infections]]. < ref > Plaut, Andrew G.  " Appendicitis. "  World Book Advanced. World Book, 2016.
