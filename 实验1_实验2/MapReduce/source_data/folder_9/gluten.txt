 '''Gluten''' /[[Template:Respell |gloot-en]]/ is a [[composite]] of the [[protein]]s ''[[gliadin]]'' and ''[[glutenin]]''. These proteins are found in the [[endosperm]]s of some grass-like [[cereal|grains]] such as [[wheat]], [[rye]] and [[barley]]. Gliadin and glutenin make up about 80% of the protein contained in wheat [[seed]]. As they are [[solution|insoluble]] in water, they can be got by washing away the [[starch]] in the grain. Worldwide, gluten is an important source of food protein, both in foods prepared directly from grains with gluten in them, and as an [[additive]] to foods that are low in protein. 
 
 ==Gluten and Celiac Disease== 
 Some people are very sensitive to glutens in their food.  When they eat foods which contain gluten, these people may experience [[stomach cramps]], [[bloating]], [[gas]] and [[diarrhoea]] and rashes. This sensitivity is called [[coeliac disease]] (in [[North America]], it is usually spelled  " celiac disease " ).
