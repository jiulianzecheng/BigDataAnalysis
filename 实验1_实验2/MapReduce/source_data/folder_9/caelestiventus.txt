 '''''Caelestiventus''''' is an early [[pterosaur]]. It is important because it is 65 million years older than any other known [[desert]]-dwelling pterosaur. Also, it shows that the earliest pterosaurs were morphologically and ecologically varied. The [[Dimorphodon]]tidae originated in the [[Triassic]] period. < ref > Britt, Brooks B. ''et al'' 2018.
