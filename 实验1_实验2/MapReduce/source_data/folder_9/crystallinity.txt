'''Crystallinity''' is a [[physical property]] of a [[solid]] that acts like a [[crystal]]. The degree of crystallinity of a crystal has a big influence on [[hardness]], [[density]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] and [[diffusion]].  
 
 Crystallinity can be measured using [[x-ray diffraction]], but [[Calorimeter|calorimetric]] techniques are also commonly used.
