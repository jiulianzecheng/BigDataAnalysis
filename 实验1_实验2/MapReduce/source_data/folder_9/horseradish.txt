 '''Horseradish''' (''Armoracia rusticana'') is a [[perennial plant]] of the [[Brassicaceae]] family. The plant is probably native to southeastern [[Europe]] and western [[Asia]].  It grows up to 1.5 & nbsp;metres (5 feet) tall, and is usually grown for its large, white, tapered [[root]]. 
 
 The unbroken horseradish root has very little smell. When cut or grated, however, [[enzyme]]s from the now-broken plant cells causes changes. The enzymes break down [[sinigrin]] to produce [[allyl isothiocyanate]] (mustard oil). This irritates the [[mucous membrane]]s of the [[Paranasal sinuses|sinuses]] and [[eye|eyes.]] Once exposed to air (by grating) or heat, it needs to be mixed with [[vinegar]]. Otherwise it becomes unpleasantly bitter-tasting. 
 
 == History == 
 Horseradish has been cultivated since ancient times. Supposedly, the [[Delphic Oracle]] told [[Apollo]] that the horseradish was worth its weight in gold. < ref name=healingfoods > {{cite book |last=Murray |first=Michael T. |title=The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofhe0000murr |year=2005 |agency=Atria Books |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7434-8052-9 |author2=Lara Pizzorno, Joseph E. Pizzorno}} < /ref >   Horseradish was known in [[Egypt]] in 1500 BC. Both root and leaves were used as a [[medicine]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The root was used as a [[condiment]] on meats in Germany, Scandinavia, and Britain. It was brought to [[North America]] during Colonial times. < ref name= " motherearthnews.com " > {{citation|last=Pleasant|first=Barbara|title=Horseradish|date=October 2003|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2003-10-01/Horseradish.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230321/http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic-Gardening/2003-10-01/Horseradish.aspx|publisher=Mother Earth News|archive-date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2007-07-01|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The word ''horseradish'' is known in English from the 1590's.  The root is similar in shape and size to a horse's [[genitalia]]. < ref name=etymonline > {{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: horseradish |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0 & search=horseradish & searchmode=none |accessdate=18 November 2012}} < /ref >   Despite the name, this plant is poisonous to horses. 
 
 ==Cultivation== 
 Horseradish is a [[perennial plant]] in [[hardiness zones]] 2–9. It can be grown as an [[annual plant|annual]] in other zones. After the first [[frost]] in the autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug out and divided. The main root is harvested for use in the kitchen. One or more large offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year's crop. Horseradish left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots. The plant can become [[invasive species|invasive]]. Older roots left in the ground become woody. They are then no longer useful for cooking. Older plants can be dug out and divided to start new plants. < ref name= " motherearthnews.com "  / > < ref > {{cite web |url= http://horseradishplants.com/cgi-bin/store/grow.html |title= How to Grow Horseradish |accessdate= 2007-07-01 |archive-date= 2007-06-22 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622104240/http://horseradishplants.com/cgi-bin/store/grow.html |url-status= dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Pests and diseases== 
 [[File:Kren Verkauf.jpg|thumb|left|Sections of roots of the horseradish plant]] 
 The larvae of ''[[Pieris rapae]]'' are a common [[caterpillar]] pest in horseradish gardens. They are called cabbageworms. The adults are white [[butterfly|butterflies]] with black spots on the forewings. They are seen flying around the plants during the day. The caterpillars are green with faint yellow stripes running lengthwise down the back and sides. Full grown caterpillars are about {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} in length. They move slowly when poked. They overwinter in green pupal cases. Adults start appearing in gardens after the last frost and are a problem through the remainder of the growing season. There are three to five overlapping generations a year. Mature caterpillars chew large, ragged holes in the leaves leaving the large veins intact. Handpicking is effective for control. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/yardandgarden/ygbriefs/e253caterpillarpestscole.html |title=Caterpillar Pests of Cole Crops in Home Gardens |accessdate=2007-09-30 |author=Suzanne Wold-Burkness and Jeff Hahn |publisher=University of Minnesota }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Culinary uses== 
 [[File:Allyl-isothiocyanate-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|Allyl isothiocyanate is the pungent ingredient in fresh horseradish sauce.]] 
 Cooks use the terms  " horseradish "  or  " prepared horseradish "  to refer to the grated root of the horseradish plant mixed with vinegar. Prepared horseradish is white to creamy-beige in colour. It will keep for months refrigerated but eventually will darken, indicating it is losing flavour and should be replaced. The leaves of the plant, while edible, are not commonly eaten, and are referred to as  " [[horseradish greens]] " . 
 
 ===Horseradish sauce=== 
 Horseradish sauce made from grated horseradish root and vinegar is a popular condiment. In the [[United Kingdom]] it is usually served with roast beef, often as part of a traditional [[Sunday roast]]. It can also be used in a number of other dishes, including [[sandwich]]es or [[salad]]s. A variation of horseradish sauce, which in some cases may substitute the vinegar with other products like lemon juice or [[citric acid]], is known in Germany as ''Tafelmeerrettich''. Also popular in the UK is [[Tewkesbury mustard]], a blend of mustard and grated horseradish originating in medieval times and mentioned by [[Shakespeare]] ([[Falstaff]] says:  " his wit's as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard "  in Henry IV Part II < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=henry4p2 & Act=2 & Scene=4 & Scope=scene & LineHighlight=1521#1521|title=Henry IV, Part II, Scene 4|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=opensourceshakespeare.org}} < /ref > ). A very similar mustard, called ''Krensenf'' or ''Meerrettichsenf'', is popular in [[Austria]] and parts of Eastern Germany. 
 
 In the [[United States]], the term  " horseradish sauce "  refers to grated horseradish combined with [[mayonnaise]] or salad dressing. Prepared horseradish is a common [[ingredient]] in [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]] cocktails and in [[cocktail sauce]], and is used as a sauce or sandwich spread. 
 
 The distinctive pungent [[taste]] of horseradish is from the compound [[allyl isothiocyanate]]. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the [[enzyme]] [[myrosinase]] is released and acts on the [[glucosinolate]]s [[sinigrin]] and [[gluconasturtiin]], which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate.  The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a [[insecticide#Antifeedants|natural defense]] against [[herbivore]]s. Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme.  When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal. < ref name=Cole/ >   Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over the course of days at 37 & nbsp;°C. < ref > Yoshio Ohta, Kenichi Takatani, Shunro Kawakishi  " Decomposition Rate of Allyl Isothiocyanate in Aqueous Solution "  Bioscience Biotechnology and Biochemistry 1995, , volume 59, pp. 102-103. {{doi|10.1271/bbb.59.102}} < /ref >   Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of the freshly crushed roots. 
 
 ===Vegetable=== 
 In Central and Eastern Europe horseradish is called ''khreyn'' (in various spellings like ''kren'') in many Slavic languages, in [[Austria]], in parts of [[Germany]] (where the other German name ''Meerrettich'' is not used), in North-East Italy, and in Yiddish (כריין translitered as ''khreyn''). There are two varieties of [[khreyn]].  " Red "  khreyn is mixed with red [[beet]] (beetroot) and  " white "  khreyn contains no beet. It is popular in [[Ukraine]] (under the name of {{lang|uk|хрін}}, ''khrin''), in [[Poland]] (under the name of {{lang|pl|chrzan}}), in Lithuania (krienai) in the [[Czech Republic]] ({{lang|cs|křen}}), in [[Russia]] ({{lang|ru|хрен}}, ''khren''), in [[Hungary]] ({{lang|hu|torma}}), in [[Romania]] ({{lang|ro|hrean}}), in [[Bulgaria]] ({{lang|bg|хрян}}, ''khryan''), in [[Slovenia]] ({{lang|si|hren}}, ''hren'') and in Slovakia (under the name of {{lang|sk|chren}}). Having this on the table is a part of Christian [[Easter]] and Jewish [[Passover]] tradition in Eastern and Central Europe. A variety with red beet is called {{lang|pl|ćwikła z chrzanem}} or simply [[ćwikła]] in Poland. In [[Ashkenazi]] European Jewish cooking [[chrain|beet horseradish]] is commonly served with [[gefilte fish]]. Red beet with horseradish is also used as a salad served with lamb dishes at Easter called ''sfecla cu hrean'' in Transylvania and other Romanian regions. Horseradish (often grated and mixed with cream, hard-boiled eggs, or apples) is also a traditional [[Easter]] dish in [[Slovenia]] and in the adjacent  [[Italy|Italian]] region of [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]]; it is used also in the other nearby Italian region of [[Veneto]]. In [[Croatia]] freshly grated horseradish(Croatian: Hren) is often eaten with boiled [[ham]] or [[beef]]. In [[Serbia]] ''ren'' is an essential condiment with cooked meat and freshly roasted suckling pig. 
 
 Horseradish is also used as a main ingredient for soups. In the Polish region of [[Silesia]], horseradish soup is a common [[Easter|Easter Day]] dish. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art83.html |title=Horseradish Soup Recipe Updated with Photographs – Polish Easter Food |publisher=Culture.polishsite.us |accessdate=2012-07-08 |archive-date=2011-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930150641/http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art83.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Relation to wasabi=== 
 The Japanese condiment [[wasabi]], although traditionally prepared from the wasabi plant, is now usually made with horseradish because the wasabi plant is rare. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Arnaud |first1=Celia Henry |year=2010 |title= Wasabi:In condiments, horseradish stands in for the real thing|journal= Chemical  &  Engineering News |volume= 88 |issue= 12 |pages= 48 |publisher= American Chemical Society |doi=10.1021/cen-v088n043.p048 |url= http://cen.acs.org/articles/88/i12/Wasabi.html |accessdate=11 November 2012}} < /ref >  The Japanese plant name for horseradish is {{nihongo|''seiyōwasabi''|セイヨウワサビ, 西洋山葵}}, or  " Western wasabi " . Both plants are in the family [[Brassicaceae]]. 
 
 ==Nutritional and biomedical uses== 
 Horseradish has compounds that have health benefits. < ref > Albrecht U., Goos K.-H., Schneider B. " A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a herbal medicinal product containing Tropaeoli majoris herba (Nasturtium) and Armoraciae rusticanae radix (Horseradish) for the prophylactic treatment of patients with chronically recurrent lower urinary tract infections. "  ''Current Medical Research and Opinion.'' 23 (10) (pp 2415-2422), 2007. < /ref >  Horseradish contains volatile oils, notably mustard oil. This oil has antibacterial properties. < ref name=Cole > Rosemary A. Cole  " Isothiocyanates, nitriles and thiocyanates as products of autolysis of glucosinolates in ''Cruciferae'' "  Phytochemutry, 1976. Vol. 15, pp. 759-762. {{doi|10.1016/S0031-9422(00)94437-6}} < /ref >  The fresh plant also contains average 79.31 & nbsp;mg of [[vitamin C]] per 100 g of raw horseradish. < ref > Rinzler, Carol Ann:  " Book of Herbs and Spices " , Wordsworth Editions, Ware, England, 1997 (pages 82–83), {{ISBN|1-85326-390-7}} < /ref >  The [[enzyme]] horseradish peroxidase (HRP), found in the plant, is used extensively in [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]]. < ref > K.
