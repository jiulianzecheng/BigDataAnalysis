 A '''courtesan'''  was often a high-class [[prostitute]] or [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], especially one associated with [[wikt:rich|rich]], powerful, or [[nobility|noble]] men who gave  
 [[:wikt:luxury|luxuries]] and [[status]] in exchange for her services. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], courtesans had an important role in high class [[society]], sometimes taking the place of [[wife|wives]] at social roles requiring diplomacy. Courtesans usually enjoyed more freedom than was typical of women at the time. For example, they did not have money problems, and were more independent. [[Madame de Pompadour]] (1721â€“1764), the famous mistress and favorite of King [[Louis XV of France]], was a courtesan. Courtesans also existed in many countries outside [[Europe]], such as [[India]] and [[Japan]].
