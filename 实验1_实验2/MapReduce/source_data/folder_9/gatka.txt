 '''Gatka''' is a  [[South Asia]]n martial art most commonly practised in the [[Punjab region]]. Though today generally identified with [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]]s, it has traditionally been practiced by other ethno-cultural groups in [[Pakistan]] such as the [[Tanoli|Tanolis]] and [[Hindkowan|Hindkowans]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Noted Hindko language folksinger Lala Sarwar passes away|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/728404-noted-hindko-language-folksinger-lala-sarwar-passes-away|access-date=2023-12-16|website=www.thenews.com.pk|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The word ''gatka'' properly refers to the wooden sticks which were originally used for sparring in this sport although now a range of other weapons are also employed.  
 
 Gatka can be practiced either as a contact sport (''khel'') or ritual/ceremonial demonstration (''rasmi'').
