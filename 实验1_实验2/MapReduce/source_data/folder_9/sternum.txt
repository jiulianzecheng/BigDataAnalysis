The '''sternum''' or '''breastbone''', in [[vertebrate]] [[anatomy]], is a [[flat bone]].  In [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s it is normally shaped like a [[shield]], often made of [[cartilage]].  It is [[wikt:absent|absent]] in both [[turtle]]s and [[snake]]s. In [[bird]]s it is larger, and has large [[flight]] [[muscles]] attached to it. < ref name=VB > {{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |url=https://archive.org/details/vertebratebody0000rome_a5a9|publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|page= [https://archive.org/details/vertebratebody0000rome_a5a9/page/188 188]|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}} < /ref >   Only in [[mammal]]s does the sternum take on the longer form seen in humans.
