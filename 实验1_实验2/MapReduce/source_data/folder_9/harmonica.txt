 ==Types of harmonicas== 
 Another type of harmonica is the chromatic harmonica.  More songs can be played on it than a regular harmonica, because chromatic harmonicas can play more different notes. Chromatic harmonicas have a button which moves a sliding bar. By pressing the button, the player can play a larger range of notes.
