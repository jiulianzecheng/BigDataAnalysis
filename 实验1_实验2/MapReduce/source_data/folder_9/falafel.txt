 == Different ways of serving falafel == 
 Falafel is usually served in a [[pita]]-like bread called [[lafa]], either inside the bread, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flat bread. In many countries falafel is a popular [[street food]] or [[fast food]]. The falafel balls, whole or crushed, may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables and hot sauce, and drizzled with [[tahini|tahini-based sauces]]. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a mezze. During [[Ramadan]], they are sometimes eaten as part of an [[iftar]], the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset. 
 
 == History == 
 Falafel was originally made with [[fava bean]]s. When the dish was used more to the north, [[chickpea]]s were more common, so they were used instead. < ref name=Kantor/ >  The chickpea was used as a food item in [[the Levant]] before 4000 BC. < ref name=both > Brothwell  &  Brothwell pp. 105-7 < /ref > 
 
 According to [[Ynetnews]],  " A common theory suggests falafel was invented some 1000 years ago by the Egyptian [[Copt]]s. They took it with them  when they moved to the rest of the Middle East. Another theory dates the invention of falafel as far as the 6th century AD, or even earlier, placing it on the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent of India]], which is known until today for making various chickpea-based dishes " . < ref > [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3421119,00.html Falafels: Fact Sheet] .

 Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas or a combination of the two. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-07-21|title=Why is falafel green? 3 Falafel Recipes - Everything Important You Need To Know! - Kitchen Kart|url=https://yourkitchenkart.com/edibles/why-is-falafel-green/|access-date=2023-03-15|language=en-US}} < /ref >  In Egypt, fava beans are used exclusively. Other variations may contain only chickpeas. This is the case of [[State of Palestine|Palestinians]], [[Yemenite Jews]] in [[Jerusalem]] as well as in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. In the [[Levant]], Falafel is generally made only with chickpeas. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/food/IsraeliFood/FalafelRecipe.htm |title=About Israel's signature food--plus, a recipe. |access-date=2009-05-14 |archive-date=2008-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024212900/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/food/IsraeliFood/FalafelRecipe.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=Aytop106 > {{cite book|title=The glutton's glossary: a dictionary of food and drink terms|first1=John|last1=Ayto|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|isbn=0415026474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAQOAAAAQAAJ & dq=syria+falafel+chickpeas & pg=PA106}} < /ref >  Unlike many other bean patties, in falafel the beans are not cooked before they are used. Instead they are soaked, possibly skinned, then ground, a small quantity of onions, [[parsley]], spices (including cumin), and bicarbonate of soda are added. It is then [[Deep-frying|deep fried]] at a high temperature. Sesame seeds may be added to the balls before they are fried; this is particularly common when falafel is served as a dish on its own rather than as a sandwich filling. 
 
 Recent culinary trends have seen the chickpea falafel have more success than fava bean falafel. Chickpea falafels are served across the Middle East, and have been popularized by expatriates of those countries living abroad. However, fava-bean falafel continue to predominate in Egypt and Sudan and their respective expatriate communities, and Egyptians are fond of deriding chickpea falafel as inferior.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 
 
 In Israel small 2.5 & nbsp;cm spherical balls are made, while in Egypt and among Palestinians larger patties are shaped with a tablespoon or a special scoop with a lever to release them into the hot oil.

 The kind of bread used for falafel may be different. Outside the Middle East, [[pita]] bread is often used as a pocket and stuffed with the different ingredients; in Arab countries a round [[khubz|khubz bread]], 'eish' in Egypt, is halved, and the two resulting round pieces are used to create a cigar-shaped wrap. There, [[hummus]] (chickpeas pureed with [[tahini]]) is rarely used as a condiment, the usual sauce is tahini (sesame seed paste) thinned with water and lemon. The most common salad ingredients are tomato and parsley. In [[Lebanon]], parsley is mixed with chopped mint leaves. It is also common in Syria and Lebanon to add pickles; the two canonical ones are pickled turnip, colored pink with beetroot, and pickled cucumber. Recently, there has been a new  " filled "  falafel, its center usually consisting of ground meat or minced onions or a boiled egg. These fillings are wrapped by the uncooked falafel mixture, and then deep fried. 
 
 The salads or the pita itself may be seasoned with [[salt]] or [[sumac]], which is very commonly used in Syria; < ref > {{Cite web|title=Fava Bean Falafel|url=https://theepicentre.com/?recipe=fava-bean-falafel|access-date=2023-09-14|website=The Epicentre|language=en-US}} < /ref >  alternatively, these may be sprinkled on top.
