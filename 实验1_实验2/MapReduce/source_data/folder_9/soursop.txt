 The '''soursop''', also known as the '''zuurzak''', is the fruit of the tree ''Annona muricata''. The tree is from warm parts of the [[Americas]]. At first it was only found in the [[Caribbean]] islands, parts of [[Central America]] and parts of [[South America]]. Now it is grown in other warm and wet places, such as the [[Pacific Islands]], [[Florida]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. 
 
 This fruit is large. It has a spiky green skin, which is not eaten. The inside of the fruit is white. It contains a sweet but sharp-tasting juice. The soursop contains black or brown seeds that are not eaten. The fruit can be eaten raw, or it can be made into juice for drinking. The juice is used to make [[candy]] and [[ice cream]]. 
 
 Some people use the soursop fruit or leaves as a medicine. Although the fruit contains [[sugar]]s and a lot of [[vitamin]]s, it may not be good to eat a lot of it. [[Scientist]]s think that the soursop may make some people ill.
