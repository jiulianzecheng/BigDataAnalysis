 '''Gardening''' is the growing of [[plant]]s such as [[flower]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[trees]] as a [[hobby]] or [[recreation]]. Some people also grow [[vegetable]]s or [[fruit]] in their gardens. People do gardening outdoors in the [[soil]] in their backyard, or in pots or containers on their [[balcony]] or on their [[patio]]. Some people do gardening on a [[roof]]. 
 
 People do indoor gardening inside their house or inside a building. Sometimes indoor gardening is done in [[greenhouse]]s, which are special [[building]]s where plants are grown. A greenhouse has a transparent [[glass]] or plastic roof and walls that let [[sun]]light in. Grow tent is also used for indoor plants. Grow tent helps plant to grow in a more spectacular and develop a friendly environment. [[Water]] gardening is growing plants in ornamental  water pools and ponds. People doing water gardening plant [[water lily|water lilies]] and other aquatic plants.  
 
 Gardening can be done outside of the home, in city [[park]]s, [[botanical garden]]s, [[zoo]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[theme park]]s, and around tourist attractions. These types of gardens are cared for by people called [[gardener]]s or [[groundskeeper]]s. 
 
 == Gardening compared with farming == 
 Gardening is related to [[farm]]ing. But farming is done on a much larger scale. A farm may have hundreds of square kilometres of plants and [[crop]]s. A garden in a person's backyard usually only measures a few square meters. As well, farming is done as a [[business]], to sell the [[Crop|crops]], fruit, and vegetables that are produced. Gardening is often done just to produce [[fruit]] or [[vegetable]]s for the gardener's own family. Gardening may be a [[hobby]] or a [[recreation]]. Gardening for sale is called  " market gardening " . 
 
 == Gardening tools == 
 Gardeners use [[tool]]s to dig in the soil and water the crops. These tools include a [[spade]], a [[Garden fork|fork]], a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], a [[basket]], a [[watering can]], a [[hose]], a [[Sprinkler]], a [[bucket]], a [[trowel]]  and a [[wheelbarrow]]. With growing, technology gardeners now have tech like Self-watering containers, Garden sensors, Hydroponic systems and Indoor lighting systems. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-08-19|title=Gardening and Technology|url=https://mygardenplant.com/gardening-and-technology/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-19|website=My Garden Plant|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Gardens as art == 
 In many countries and cultures, designing beautiful gardens is treated as a fine [[art]]. In [[Japan]], for instance, [[Zen]] [[monk]]s created [[Japanese garden]]s. In [[Europe]] in the 1700s, kings and queens had formal gardens built. One example is the gardens at the [[Versailles]] palace in [[Paris]], [[France]]. [[Landscaping]], the making of an artificial [[landscape]], may include gardening and the designer may be a professional landscape [[architect]].
