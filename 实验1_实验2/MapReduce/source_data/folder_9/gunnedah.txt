 ==History== 
 The Gunnedah area was the home of the [[Indigenous Australian|Australian Aborigines]] who spoke the [[Kamilaroi]] (Gamilaraay) language. The area of the town was settled by Europeans in [[1833]] or [[1834]]. 
 
 [[Dorothea Mackellar]] wrote her famous [[poem]] ''[[My Country]]'' (popularly known as ''I Love a Sunburnt Country'') about her family's farm near Gunnedah. Every year the Dorothea Mackellar Poetry Awards for school students are held in Gunnedah. 
 
 Coal was found on Black Jack Hill in 1877. By 1891, 6,000 tons of coal had been dug from shafts. The Gunnedah Colliery Company was registered in May, 1899. One month later a private railway some 5.7 & nbsp;km in length had been completed from the railway station to their mine. In September, 1957, the Government Railway took over the working of the line. < ref > Eardley, Gifford: A Short History of the Gunnedah Colliery Co. Ltd. Railway,  [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], March, 1977 pp58-67 < /ref >
