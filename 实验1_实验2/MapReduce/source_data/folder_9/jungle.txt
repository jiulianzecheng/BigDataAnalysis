 The '''jungle''' is a place in a [[rainforest]] where the forest floor is covered with plants. Like other [[rain]]y places, they have many [[river]]s or [[stream]]s. [[Scientist]]s think that more types of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s live in the jungles than everywhere else. When people talk about jungles, they sometimes mean the whole [[rainforest]]. 
 
 The crowding in a jungle leaves little room to walk.  This may make it dangerous to people.  However, it also has benefits.  The many plants and animals can provide food for [[foraging]].  
 
 The [[Amazon rainforest]] is thick and dark jungle in many places in nine countries.  However, most of this forest is in [[Brazil]], [[South America]].
