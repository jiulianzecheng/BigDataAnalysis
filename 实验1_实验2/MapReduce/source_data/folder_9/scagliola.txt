 '''Scagliola''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''scaglia'', meaning  " chips " ), is an artificial way of imitating [[marble]] and other precious material. It is a decorative building material.  
 
 [[Stucco]] columns, < ref > Stucco is a material used for decoration in buildings. It is made of an aggregate (such as [[sand]]) plus a binder (such as [[lime]]) plus water. Animal or plant [[fibre]]s are often added to give it strength. Modern stucco might add [[acrylic]]s and [[glass fibre]]s to make it last longer. < /ref >  [[sculpture]]s, and other [[architecture|architectural]] elements can be made by scagliola. It came into fashion in 17th-century [[Tuscany]]. 
 
 Scagliola is a [[composite material|composite substance]] made from [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]], < ref > Selenite is a [[crystal]]line form of [[gypsum]], and gypsum is basically a form of [[calcium sulphate]] (CaSO < sub > 4 < /sub > ·2H < sub > 2 < /sub > O) < /ref >  [[glue]] and natural [[pigment]]s, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colours and stuck on to a core, or patterns may be carved into a prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern is then then filled with the coloured, plaster-like composite. Then it is polished with [[flax oil]] for brightness, and wax for protection. The whole thing gives a  richness of colour not easy to get in natural marbles.
