 Spelt was an important [[staple food]] in parts of [[Europe]] from the [[Bronze Age]] to [[Middle Ages|medieval times]]. It is still grown in [[Central Europe]] and northern [[Spain]]. Spelt originated before [[common wheat]] (''Triticum aestivum''), and that bread wheat is derived from spelt.  
 
 Spelt has become more popular as a type of [[bread]] in recent years. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/about/types-of-grain/spelt-grain/|title=Spelt grain|work=dovesfarm.co.uk|access-date=2015-05-07|archive-date=2015-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423062348/http://www.dovesfarm.co.uk/about/types-of-grain/spelt-grain|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Spelt costs more than modern wheats.
