 A '''cheesecake''' is a [[dessert]] [[cake]] made of [[cheese]] (usually [[cream cheese]] but sometimes [[ricotta]]), [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, and [[sugar]]. It often has a [[graham cracker]] [[crumb]] [[crust]], sometimes held together by [[melting|melted]] [[butter]]. The [[filling]] has a very heavy, smooth texture. It sometimes has [[sour cream]] to make it easier to shape and may have fruit flavoring such as [[strawberry]], [[blueberry]], or [[lemon]]. It is often [[topping|topped]] with fresh [[fruit]] or [[chocolate]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Cheesecake is now often thought to be part of [[American cuisine|American cooking]], but it has a long [[history]]. [[Cheese]] making began around [[2nd millennium BC|2000{{nbsp}}{{smallcaps|bc}}]], and [[Archaeology|scientists who study people in the past]] have found cheese [[mold]]s almost as old. 
 
 Cheesecakes are known to go back to at least [[ancient Greece|Greece]]. < ref name= " about " > {{Cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/Cheesecake.htm |title=The History of Cheesecake and Cream Cheese |work=about.com |accessdate=1 May 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  In the [[2nd century|100s]]{{nbsp}}[[Anno Domini|{{smallcaps|ad}}]], the [[Greek literature|writer]] [[Athenaeus]]'s ''[[Deipnosophistae|Dinner-Table Philosophers]]'' mentioned the [[Greek poetry|poet]] [[Callimachus]] (around the [[3rd century BC|200s{{nbsp}}{{smallcaps|bc}}]]) used to have a book by an  " [[Aegimius]] "  about the art of making cheesecakes ({{lang-grc-gre|Πλακουντοπουκόν Σύγγραμμα}}, ''Plakountopoukón Sýngramma''). < ref > Callimachus, ''ap. Athen'', xiv. p. 643, e < /ref >  Cheesecake may have been given to the [[sportsperson|sportspeople]] during the [[Olympic Games]], which started in [[776 BC|776{{nbsp}}{{smallcaps|bc}}]]. 
 
 Even before the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] [[Roman Greece|took over Greece]], they had begun making cheesecakes as well. [[Cato the Elder|M. Porcius Cato]]'s ''[[De Agri Cultura|Book on Farming]]'' (written around [[160 BC|160{{nbsp}}{{smallcaps|bc}}]]) mentions three kinds of cakes{{mdash}}''{{lang|la|libum}}'', ''{{lang|la|savillum}}'', and ''{{lang|la|placenta}}''{{mdash}}for use as [[ancient Roman religion|offerings to the gods]]. < ref > [[Cato the Elder]], ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/E*.html De Agri Cultura]'', §75  &  76. < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/cato_recipes.html | author = | title = Cato's 'De Agricultura': Recipes | publisher = www.novaroma.org | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cato/de_agricultura/e*.html | author = | title = Cato's 'De Agricultura': Recipes | publisher =  | accessdate = }} < /ref >  [[Placenta cake]]s were the closest to today's cheesecakes, since its [[crust]] and [[filling]] are made separately. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.culinaryschools.com/newsletter/July%202007%20CulinarySchools.com%20Newsletter.pdf | title = A Bit of Food History: Cheesecake | publisher = www.culinaryschools.com | accessdate = 2008-10-12 }} < /ref >   
 
 [[Europe]]ans stopped using [[yeast]] and started adding [[egg beater|beaten]] [[Egg (food)|egg]]s to their cheesecakes around the [[18th century|1700s]]. This made it taste more like a [[dessert]] than a [[cheesebread]]. < ref > [https://www.cheesecake.com/History-Of-Cheesecake.asp  " History of Cheesecake " ]. < /ref >   
 
 Cheesecake [[recipe]]s were brought to the [[United States]] as [[immigrants|people moved there]] from Europe. Most of today's kinds of cheesecake ( " [[New York City|New York]]-style cheesecake " ) come from the kind created by William Lawrence of [[Chester, Orange County, New York|Chester, New York]], in [[1872]]. He was trying to make something like the soft [[France|French]] [[Neufchâtel (cheese)|Neufchâtel]] [[cheese]] and ended up with a heavy, creamy  " [[ripening|unripened]] cheese " . < ref > [http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Cakes/Cheesecake.htm Cheesecake History] < /ref >
