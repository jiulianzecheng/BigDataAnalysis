 In [[meteorology]], a '''cyclone''' refers to any [[low pressure area]] with [[wind]]s [[spiral|spiral]]ing inwards. Cyclones rotate [[clockwise]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and anti-clockwise in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. A cyclone is the general term for a variety of low pressure system types, such as [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[extra tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es. 
 
 The largest of these systems are extratropical cyclones and cold-core polar cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale with a horizontal length of 1000 & nbsp;km or more. The [[warm]]-core cyclones are the tropical cyclones, [[mesocyclone]]s, and the polar lows that lie within the smaller mesoscale. [[Subtropical cyclones]] are intermediate in [[size]]. Cyclones have also been on other planets outside of [[Earth]], such as the [[Great Red Spot]] of [[Jupiter]] and the Great Black Spot of [[Neptune]]. 
 
 Cyclones are also referred to as '''hurricanes''' and '''typhoons'''. They consist of the eye, eyewall and rainbands. 
 
 The process of cyclone formation and intensification is described as Cyclogenesis. The formation of Extratropical cyclones comes as waves in large [[regions]] of enhanced [[latitude|midlatitude]] temperature contrasts which are called baroclinic zones. These zones contract to form [[weather front]]s as the circulation of the cyclone closes and gets more intense. Later in their life cycle, cyclones form what is called an occluded front. The cyclone's track is then guided over the course of an 2 to 6 day life cycle by its steering flow of the polar or subtropical jetstream. Cyclones destroy many things when they come into contact with land such as crops, buildings, trees, etc.
