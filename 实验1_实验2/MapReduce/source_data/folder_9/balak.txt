[[Balak]] [[son]] of Tzipor was a [[person]] in the [[Book of Numbers]]. Balak was the [[king]] of [[Moab]] and [[fear]]ed the [[Israelites]] so Balak sent his messengers to [[Midian]] and hired [[Balaam]] to [[curse]] the Israelites “for I know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed”. When Balaam tried to curse the Israelites, he ended up [[blessing]] them instead and Balak was [[angry]] about that. So Balak joined with the [[Midianite]]s in sending [[women]] to the Israelites to [[seduce]] them and make them weak so that they could attack the Israelites.
