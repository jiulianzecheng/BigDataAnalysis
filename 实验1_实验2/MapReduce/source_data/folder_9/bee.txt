 '''Bees''' are flying [[insect]]s of the [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[ant]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[sawflies]]. There are about 20,000 [[species]] of bees. < ref > {{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jMuShwtyem0C & dq=bee+species+20000 & pg=PA145 | title = Bee pollination in agriculture| accessdate = 2009-09-05| first = Rosalind| last = James| date = 9 September 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-971787-3}} < /ref >  Bees collect [[pollen]] from [[flowers]]. Bees can be found on all [[continent]]s except [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 Bees fall into four groups: 
 *[[Honeybee]]s, including the [[Africanized honeybee]], are in the genus ''Apis''. The group is first known from Europe, at the [[Eocene]]{{ndash}}[[Oligocene]] boundary.  
 *[[Bumblebee]]s: 250 species in the Apidae family. 
 *[[Stingless bee]]s: 550 species in the Meliponini. < ref > Grüter, Christoph 2020. ''Stingless bees: their behaviour, ecology and evolution''. Fascinating Life Sciences: Springer, New York.  ISBN 978-3-030-60089-1. < /ref > 
 *Solitary bees: solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and usually lives in a nest she builds herself. There are quite a few of these, for example the carpenter bees, leafcutter bees and mason bees (and there are others). 
 
 The [[European honey bee]] (called ''[[Apis mellifera]]'' by [[biologist]]s), is kept by humans for [[honey]]. Keeping bees to make honey is called [[beekeeping]], or apiculture. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 Flowers were pollinated by insects such as [[beetle]]s long before bees first appeared. Bees are different because they are ''specialized'' as pollination agents. Their body and behaviour  make pollination easier. Bees are generally better at the task than other pollinating insects such as beetles, [[fly|flies]], [[butterfly|butterflies]] and pollen wasps. The appearance of such floral specialists is believed to have driven the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[angiosperm]]s, and, in turn, the bees themselves. 
 
 Bees, like [[ants]], evolved from [[wasp]]s. The ancestors of bees were wasps in a family which preyed on other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have come from the capture of prey insects that were covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. Similar behaviour could be switched to pollen collection. This same [[evolution]]ary scenario has occurred within the [[vespoidea|vespoid]] wasps, where the group known as  " pollen wasps "  also evolved from predatory ancestors.  
 
 A recently reported bee fossil, of the genus ''Melittosphex'', is considered  " an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea, sister-group to the modern bees " , and dates from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] (~100 mya). < ref > {{cite journal |author=Poinar G.O.  &  Danforth B.N. |title=A fossil bee from Early Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5799 |pages=614 |date=October 2006  |pmid=17068254 |doi=10.1126/science.1134103 |s2cid=28047407 |url=}} < /ref >  Features of its [[morphology]]  place it clearly within the bees. It still has two ancestral [[Trait (biology)|traits]] of the legs which betray its origin. < ref name= " Danforthetal2006 " > {{cite journal|author=Danforth BN|last2=Sipes S|last3=Fang J|last4=Brady SG|date=2006|title=The history of early bee diversification based on five genes plus morphology|url=|journal=Proc.

 == Bee bodies == 
 [[File:Bee Squirt.gif|thumb|250px|right|Bee defecating: remarkable shot. Note the contraction of the [[anus]] which creates internal pressure.]] 
 
 Like other insects, the body of a bee can be divided into three parts: the head, [[thorax]] (the middle part), and abdomen (the back part). Also like other insects, bees have three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. Many bees are hairy and have yellow and black or orange and black [[warning colors|warning colours]] 
 
 Many bees have [[wikt:sting|stings]] (like a [[wikt:hollow|hollow]] [[needle]]) on the rear of their bodies. If they get confused, angry, or scared they may sting, and [[injection|inject]] [[toxin|venom]], which hurts. Once a worker bee has stung someone   the bee dies after a short while, but other types of bee and wasp can sting again. Some people are [[allergy|allergic]] to bee stings and may even die from them. 
 
 == Social bees == 
 Some bees are [[eusociality|eusocial]] insects; this means they live in organized groups called [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. Honey bees, the kind of bee used in beekeeping, are eusocial. The home of a bee colony is called a [[beehive|hive]]. One hive has only one queen.  
 
 There are three kinds of bees in a honey bee colony. A [[queen]] bee is the most important bee in the colony because she will lay the eggs. The queen bee only uses her stinger to sting other queen bees. The queen is usually the mother of the worker bees. She ate a special jelly called royal [[jelly]] from when she was young. Worker bees are females too, and they are the bees that collect [[pollen]] from [[flower]]s and will fight to protect the colony. Workers do a [[waggle dance]] to tell the others where they have found nectar; [[Karl von Frisch]] discovered this. 
 
 Drone bees (males) mate with the queen bee so that she can lay eggs.  The only function of the male drone is to mate.  They do no other work in the hive. 
 
 === Haplodiploidy === 
 In [[haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs.  
 
 Because a male has only one copy of each gene, his daughters (which are [[diploid]], with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. < ref name= " Hamilton1964II " > {{cite journal | last=Hamilton | first=W. D. | title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour II | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | date=1964 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=17–52 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6 | pmid=5875340| bibcode=1964JThBi...7...17H }} < /ref > 
 
 It is unclear whether this system is necessary for eusociality. 
 [[Monogamy]] (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far known, so it is likely that [[haplodiploidy]] contributed to the evolution of [[eusociality]] in bees. < ref > Hughes, William O.H.; Oldroyd, Benjamin P.; Beekman, Madeleine; Ratnieks, Francis L.W. 2008. Ancestral monogamy shows kin selection is key to the evolution of eusociality. [[Science (journal)|Science]]. '''320''' (5880): 1213–1216. [[doi: 10.1126/science.1156108]] < /ref >
