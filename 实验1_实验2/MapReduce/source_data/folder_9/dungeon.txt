 A '''dungeon''' is a room or cell in a [[castle]] to keep [[prisoner]]s. Most dungeons are underground, others are high up in towers. 
 
 An '''oubliette''' is a type of dungeon that can be entered by using a [[trapdoor]] in the ceiling. People were thrown into an oubliette from the ceiling and left there to starve or dehydrate to death, making it akin to [[immurement]].
