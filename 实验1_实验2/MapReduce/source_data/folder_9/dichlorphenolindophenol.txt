 '''DCPIP''' (its full name is ''2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol'') is a [[blue]] [[chemical]] used as a [[dye]] because when it is [[oxidized]] it is blue.  Once DCPIP is [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] (by addition of [[electron]]s) it does not have a color anymore. This reaction can be reversed, and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is [[oxidation|oxidized]]. 
 
 == Purpose == 
 DCPIP is often used to measure the electron transport chain in [[plant]]s. It has a higher redox potential (electron affinity) than the [[Iron|Fe]]-[[Sulphur|S]] complex in cytochrome b and will therefore  " steal "  electrons from it. This means that cytochrome c does not  receive them. The process cuts off the electron supply of  photosystem I. A common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of [[vitamin C]] [[solution]]. This reduces the 'jelly' by transforming it to a colourless mass. This experiment can be carried out to illustrate the effect of changing [[cell]] sizes on SA/V (surface area:volume ratio). This is known as [[Titration]].
