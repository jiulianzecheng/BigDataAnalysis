 The '''vagina''' is a part of the [[female]] body. It is between the [[perineum]] and the [[urethra]]. The vaginal opening is much larger than the [[urethra]]l opening. It is a tube leading from the uterus to the outside of the body. Menstrual fluid (red, blood-filled liquid lost during [[menstruation]]) leaves the body through the vagina. During [[sexual intercourse]], the [[penis]] is put into the vagina. During [[birth]], the vagina opens to let the [[baby]] come out from the [[uterus]]. The vagina is reddish-pink in color, though colors may vary. 
 
 == Development == 
 Between the ages of 9-15 years, the vagina and [[uterus]] get bigger. The uterus is the organ in which a baby grows.  The external opening of the vagina leading to the [[vulva]], between the legs. A clear or whitish fluid may start to flow out of the vagina to keep it clean. < ref name= " Marshall 187 " > Marshall, ''Human Growth'', p. 187. < /ref > 
 
 == Location == 
 The opening to the vagina is located behind the urethral opening and in front of the perineum. 
 The vagina is the tube leading from the [[uterus]] to the outside of the body. The opening is between the legs, inside the [[labium]], behind the opening to the [[urethra]], and in front of the [[anus]]. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 The vagina is an [[elastic]], [[muscle|muscular]] [[tube]]. It starts at the [[cervix]] and ends at the [[vulva]]. < ref > [http://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#vagina http://www.womenshealth.gov/glossary/#vagina] ''Womenshealth.gov''  < /ref >  It is about {{convert|6| to| 7.5|cm}} wide, and {{convert|9| cm}} long. < ref > Gray's Anatomy < /ref >  During [[sexual intercourse]] and childbirth, the vagina gets wider and bigger. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.engenderhealth.org/res/onc/sexuality/response/pg2.html | work = EngenderHealth | title = The sexual response cycle | accessdate = 2007-10-13 | archive-date = 2007-10-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071030185517/http://www.engenderhealth.org/res/onc/sexuality/response/pg2.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  It has to be lubricated to stay clean and allow sexual intercourse and childbirth. It is lubricated partially by the [[Bartholin's gland]]s. This lubrication also allows [[sperm]] easier access to [[fertilization|fertilize]] an [[ovum]]. 
 
 == The vaginal biome == 
 {{main|Vaginal flora}} 
 
 [[File:Gray1167.svg|thumb|right|200px|The cervix]] 
 Like many tissues, the vagina has a natural [[biome]], a [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of [[microbiology|microscopic]] organisms. The vagina is an interface between the host and the environment. Its surface is covered by a protective [[epithelium]] where [[bacteria]] and other [[microorganisms]] grow. The ectocervix (that's the vaginal part of the [[cervix]]) is not sterile. < ref > 'sterile' here means having no biome on the surface. < /ref > 
 == Functions == 
 === Release === 
 {{Main|Menstruation}} 
 The vagina releases [[blood]] and [[biological tissue|tissue]] during menstruation. [[Tampon]]s or other products can be used to absorb some of the blood. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/menstruation.html | title =All about Menstruation | accessdate = 2010-05-14 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Sexual activity === 
 {{Main|Sexual intercourse|Orgasm}} 
 When a woman is [[Sexual arousal|aroused]], she has pleasurable feelings in her genital region. The vagina gets up to {{convert|8.5| cm}} wide. It can get bigger with more stimulation. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationships/havingsex/performanceproblems/doessizematter | work = TheSite.org | title = Does size matter | accessdate = 2006-08-12 | archive-date = 2007-02-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221174153/http://www.thesite.org/sexandrelationships/havingsex/performanceproblems/doessizematter | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  During sexual intercourse, the man's [[penis]] is placed in the woman's vagina. The vagina is warm and soft, and it places pressure on the man's penis. That can feel good for both partners and usually makes the man have an [[orgasm]] after repeated thrusts. For orgasm in women, the vagina has significantly fewer [[nerve]] endings than the [[clitoris]], and therefore rubbing or applying other consistent pressure against the clitoris is usually needed to help the woman have an orgasm. < ref name= " Weiten " > {{cite book|authors=Wayne Weiten, Dana S.

The semen contains [[sperm]]. The sperm can move from the vagina into the uterus to fertilize an [[Ovum|egg]] and make a woman pregnant.

 === Childbirth === 
 {{Main|Birth}} 
 During birth, the vagina acts as a pathway for the baby to leave the mother's body. The vagina is very elastic and stretches to many times its normal [[diameter]] during birth. 
 
 === Pregnancy === 
 {{Main|Pregnancy}} 
 Sperm needs to be deposited at the top of the vagina near the [[cervix]] and fertilize the ovum (egg) if pregnancy is to occur. In a normal childbirth, [[baby|babies]] come out through the vagina.
