 '''Diapause''' is a delay in development which has [[Evolution|evolved]] in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions. < ref > R.F. Chapman 1998.

 It is a [[Physiology|physiological]] state with very specific conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavourable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. It is most often observed in [[arthropod]]s, especially [[insect]]s, and in the [[embryo]]s of many of the [[Oviparity|oviparous]] [[species]] of fish in the order [[Cyprinodontiformes]]. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=W.

 Not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions, but once it is started, only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause. This distinguishes diapause from other forms of [[dormancy]] such as [[hibernation]]. 
 
 Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the [[pupa]]e and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult [[Monarch butterfly]], ''Danaus plexippus''. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.
