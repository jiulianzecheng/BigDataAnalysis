 '''Gravel''' is small, loose, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] [[particle]]s. It is any loose rock that is larger than 2 mm (0.079 in) in its smallest [[dimension]] (about 1/12 of an inch) and no more than 64 mm (2.5 in). 
 
 Small gravel is composed of [[granule]]s ( > 2 to 4 mm/0.079 to 0.16 in). Large gravel is called [[pebble]]s ( > 4 to 64 mm/0.16 to 2.5 in).  
 
 Particles smaller than gravel are [[sand]], larger particles are [[cobble]]s. 
 
 Gravel and sand are used for road surfaces, and for [[cement]] and [[Tarmac]]. Mixtures of gravel and sand mixed with various crushed material, are known as ''aggregate'' in the trade. This is used for [[drain]]age in the basement of roads, and other purposes. Mixture of stones and resin is also used to pave footpaths, driveways, etc. This mixture is known as Resin Bonded Gravel. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Resin Bonded Gravel|url=https://resinbondedgravel.uk/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-29|website=Resin Bonded Gravel|language=en-GB}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Resin Bonded Gravel|url=https://www.resinbondedgravel.org.uk/|access-date=2020-11-16|website=www.resinbondedgravel.org.uk}} < /ref > 
 
 == Origin == 
 Natural gravel comes from ancient [[beach]]es which have not consolidated (turned into solid rock). In effect, beaches from (for instance) the [[Jurassic]] are dug up in [[Quarry|quarries]]. The material is then [[wikt:sort|sifted]] into size categories. The gravel and sand is then sold on to [[engineering]] companies. Most natural sand and gravel is [[silica]], SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > , in its [[chemistry]]. This is very hard-wearing. 
 
 However, if the material is originally in hard rock form, then it is first [[wikt:crush|crushed]]. This enables the industry to offer other materials such as [[granite]] or [[limestone]], originally solid rock, as gravel. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2018-09-28|title=The Journey of Sand  &  Gravel: From Rome to the Streets|url=https://nmreadymix.com/the-journey-of-sand-gravel-from-rome-to-the-streets/|access-date=2020-10-29|website=NM Ready Mix|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 The open-cast [[mining]] and processing of gravel, sand and aggregate is a huge world-wide industry, sometimes called  " conglomerates " .
