 '''Cnidaria''' is a [[phylum]] with about 11,000 [[species]] of [[animal]]s. < ref name=Daly > Daly M. ''et al'' 2007. The phylum Cnidaria: a review of phylogenetic patterns and diversity 300 years after Linnaeus. ''Zootaxa'', '''1668''': 127–182, Wellington.   [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p182.pdf] < /ref >  All of them are simple and [[aquatic]], and most of them live in the [[sea]]. Some are [[colony (biology)|colonial]], composed of [[zooid]]s which may be [[clone]]s. Cnidarian zooids may take the form of [[polyp]]s or [[Medusa (biology)|medusae]] at different phases of their life. 
 
 Cnidaria take their name from special cells which have [[organelle]]s that sting: the [[nematocyst]]s. This device is largely responsible for their success: it is their main specialised and distinctive cell type. < ref > Ruppert E.E; Fox R.S.  &  Barnes R.D. 2004. ''Invertebrate Zoology''.

 == Pronunciation == 
 The word Cnidaria is spoken without the initial  " C " , and with a long  " i " . So it sounds like  " Naidaria " . In a similar way, the term [[Ctenophore]] is pronounced as  " Teenophore " . Originally, a Greek [[kappa (letter)|kappa]] was in front of the words, and it was pronounced. The name comes from [[Greek language]] ''knidi'',  " nettle " , thus mening  " nettle-like animals "  as all cnidarians have stinging cells like [[nettle]]s. 
 
 == Subdivisions == 
 There are five classes in the group. < ref name=Daly/ >  [[Jellyfish]] occur in four of the classes.  
 * Subphylum and class [[Anthozoa]]: the [[sea anemone]]s and [[coral]]s. 
 * Subphylum [[Medusozoa]]: the [[jellyfish]]  < ref > Classes in Medusozoa based on {{cite web| url=http://www.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=11582| title=The Taxonomicon - Taxon: Subphylum Medusozoa| accessdate=2009-01-26| publisher=Universal Taxonomic Services| archive-date=2009-03-11| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311093127/http://www.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=11582| url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 ** Class [[Scyphozoa]]: the 'true' jellyfish. 
 ** Class [[Cubozoa]]: the [[Box jelly|box jellies]]. 
 ** Class [[Hydrozoa]]: the hydroids: (''[[Hydra (animal)|Hydra]]''; [[Portuguese man o' war]]). 
 ** Class [[Staurozoa]]: the stalked jellyfish. 
 
 Unranked, but now known to be cnidarians, is the [[parasitic]] group [[Myxozoa]]. 
 
 ===Basic body forms=== 
 Adult cnidarians are usually either free-swimming [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]]e or [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[polyp]]s. Many alternate between the two forms. Both forms are [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]], like a wheel and a tube respectively. 
 
 Most have fringes of tentacles equipped with [[Cnidocyte|cnidocytes]] around their edges. Medusae usually have an inner ring of tentacles around their mouth. Some hydroids may be colonies of [[zooid]]s which serve different purposes: defence, reproduction and catching prey. The [[mesoglea]] of medusae is a thick and springy jelly, so it returns to its original shape after muscles around the edge have contracted. This makes a sort of jet propulsion. 
 
 ===Skeletons=== 
 In medusae the only supporting structure is the jelly inside their cell layers. ''[[hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and most [[sea anemone]]s close their mouths when they are not feeding, and the water in the digestive cavity then acts as a kind of skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as ''[[Tubularia]]'' use columns of water-filled cells for support. [[Sea pen]]s stiffen the mesogleal jelly with [[calcium carbonate]] [[wikt:spicule|spicule]]s and tough fibrous [[protein]]s, rather like [[sponge]]s. 
 
 In some colonial polyps, a [[chitin]]ous [[periderm]] gives support and some protection to the connecting sections and to the lower parts of individual polyps. [[Scleractinia|Stony coral]]s secrete massive calcium carbonate [[exoskeleton]]s. A few polyps collect materials such as sand grains and shell fragments, which they attach to their outsides. Some colonial sea anemones stiffen the mesoglea with [[sediment]] particles. 
 
 == Fossil record == 
 There is a long fossil record for the corals, and soft-bodied forms appear in some exceptional [[strata]]. Some are believed to be among the [[Ediacaran biota]]. < ref > {{cite journal
