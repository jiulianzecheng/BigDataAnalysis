 Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia.Therapies include [[herbal medicine]]s, [[Dieting#Detox|special diets]], [[Meditation#Hinduism|meditation]], [[yoga]], [[massage]], [[Laxative#Historical and health fraud uses|laxatives]], [[Enema#Alternative medicine|enemas]], and medical oils. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ayurvedic medicine {{!}} Complementary and alternative therapy {{!}} Cancer Research UK|url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/ayurvedic-medicine|access-date=2021-03-26|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org}} < /ref >  Medicines are typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of early Indian alchemy or ''[[rasa shastra]]'').

 In Ayurveda, the story is that [[Dhanvantari]], the Hindu god of Ayurveda, made himself into a human king by [[incarnation]]. He was king of [[Varanasi]], and taught Ayurvedic medicine to a group of physicians. One of these physicians, named Sushruta, wrote the ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' (''Sushruta's Compendium''), an Ayurvedic text that has this story in it. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/b24758619_0001#page/n103/mode/2up|title=An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita Based on Original Sanskrit text|last1=Bhishagratna|first1=Kaviraj Kunjalal|date=1907|publisher=K.

 Most Ayurvedic therapies are made from [[chemical compounds]] taken from plants, from [[minerals]], and from [[metals]]. In [[ancient India]], Ayurvedic texts gave explanations for [[surgeries]] and for the [[Stitches|stitching]] of [[wounds]] to help [[wound healing]]. The ancient Indians knew how to take out [[kidney stones]] and how to do [[rhinoplasty]] ([[plastic surgery]] for the nose).{{sfn|Wujastyk|2003a}} < ref name= " mukh-surg2 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924012165522|title=The Surgical Instruments of the Hindus, with a Comparative Study of the Surgical Instruments of the Greek, Roman, Arab, and the Modern European Surgeons|last1=Mukhopadhyaya|first1=Girindranath|date=1913|publisher=Calcutta University|location=Calcutta|access-date=16 October 2015}} < /ref >  People have used many different Ayurvedic [[therapies]] through the [[history of India]].
