 '''Monophysitism''' is an [[idea]] about the nature of [[Jesus Christ]] that Christ has only one nature, the [[divine]] one. 
 
 There are two main [[doctrines]] that can be called '''Monophysite''' ({{IPAEng|məˈnɒfəs < s > ɪ < /s > t}}): 
 
 == Eutychianism == 
 '''Eutychianism''' says that the human and divine natures of Christ were combined into one new single ''mono'') nature, and his human nature was  " dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea " . 
 
 ==Apollinarism == 
 '''Apollinarism''', or '''Apollinarianism''', says that Christ had a human body and human  " living principle "  but that the Divine [[Logos]] had taken the place of the ''[[nous]]'', or  " thinking principle " . That is analogous but not identical to what might be called a [[mind]] today. 
 
 == Opposition == 
 After [[Nestorianism]], which was taught by [[Nestorius]], [[Archbishop of Constantinople]], was refused at the [[First Council of Ephesus]], [[Eutyches]], an [[archimandrite]] at [[Constantinople]] came up with new ideas. Monophysitism and Eutycheism were also refused at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in [[451]].  
 
 Monophysitism is also rejected by the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] but was widely accepted in [[Syria]], the Levant, and [[Egypt]]. That caused many tensions in the early days of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. 
 
 Later, [[Monothelitism]] was developed as an attempt to bridge the gap between the Monophysite and the Chalcedonian position, but it was also rejected by the members of the Chalcedonian synod though it had at times the support of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperors and one of the [[Pope]]s of Rome, [[Pope Honorius I|Honorius I]]. Some thought that [[Monothelitism]] was at one time held by the [[Maronite]]s, but the Maronite community, for the most part, dispute that by stating that it has never been out of communion with the [[Catholic Church]]. 
 
 [[Miaphysitism]], the [[christology]] of the [[Oriental Orthodox church]]es, is sometimes considered a variant of Monophysitism, but those churches view their theology as distinct from Monophysitism and [[anathema]]tize Eutyches.
