 A '''laundromat''', '''laundrette''', '''self-service laundry''', '''coin laundry''', or '''coin-wash''' is a business where people can wash their own [[clothes]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is a Laundry Mat?

 ==Use== 
 While most homes have their own washers and dryers, laundromats are still very popular with people who live in [[Apartment|apartments]] and those who do not have their own machines. They are also used, even by those who have their own machines, for large bedding and other items that normal house washers cannot fit. 
 Some [[United Kingdom|UK]] households have bedding (such as [[Duvet|duvets]] and comforters) that are much too big to fit inside of home washing machines, and UK households may not have dryers, making laundromats the only way available for cleaning them or drying them.
