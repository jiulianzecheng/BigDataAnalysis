 '''Light''' is a form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It is the natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things easy to see. 
 
 It has a [[wavelength]] which can be seen by the [[human]] [[eye]]. < ref > International Commission on Illumination 1987. [http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html ''International Lighting Vocabulary''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227034508/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html |date=2010-02-27 }}. Number 17.4. CIE, 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-3-900734-07-7}}. < br > By the ''International Lighting Vocabulary'', the definition of ''light'' is: “Any radiation capable of causing a visual sensation directly.” < /ref >  Animals can also see light. Light makes up a small part of both the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[radiation]] given off by stars like the [[sun]].  The study of light is known as [[optics]]. When light hits an opaque object, it makes a [[shadow]]. When light hits a transparent object, it passes through it almost completely without making a [[shadow]]. 
 
 Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that shows properties of both [[wave]]s and [[Particle physics|particles]]. It is a form of energy. Light also keeps the Earth warm. Light exists in tiny energy packets called [[photons]].  Each wave has a [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]]. The human eye sees each wavelength as a different [[color]]. [[Rainbow]]s show the entire [[spectrum]] of visible light. The separate colors, moving in from the outer edges, are  [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Other colors can be seen only with special [[camera]]s or [[instrument]]s: Wavelengths below the frequency of red are called [[infrared]], and higher than of violet are called [[ultraviolet]]. 
 
 The other main properties of light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], [[polarization]], [[phase]] and orbital [[angular momentum]]. 
 
 In [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. < ref > {{Citation | title = Camera lenses: from box camera to digital | author = Gregory Hallock Smith | publisher = SPIE Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780819460936 | page = 4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC & pg=PA4 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Citation | title = Comprehensive Physics XII | author = Narinder Kumar | publisher = Laxmi Publications | year = 2008 | isbn = 9788170085928 | page = 1416 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IryMtwHHngIC & pg=PA1416 }} < /ref >  This article is about visible light.

 Light moves in a straight line. The straight line path is often drawn as a ray.  Humans can only see rays of light traveling directly into the eyes.  Ray diagrams are used to illustrate light traveling from one place to another. A beam of light can be thought of as a set of light rays. 
 
 Objects that block rays of light can create shadows. Opaque objects block all light rays and create a darker shadow, [[Transparency|translucent]] objects block some rays and scatter others.  They create a lighter shadow. [[Transparent]] things will allow almost all light rays to pass straight through. They have no or very little shadow. Light can easily move through transparent things. When light is not in a vacuum, it travels slower than the [[speed of light]]. The slowest speed of light ever recorded was 39 [[mph|miles per hour]]. < ref > Hau L.V. ''et al'' 1999. Light  reduction to 17 metres per second in an ultracold atomic gas. ''Nature'' '''397''', p594/8. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v397/n6720/pdf/397594a0.pdf] < /ref > 
 Our eyes react to light. When we see something, we see the light it [[reflection|reflects,]] or the light it gives off. For example, a [[lamp]] gives off light. Everything else in the room the [[lamp]] is in reflects the lamp's light. As the viewer, one cannot directly determine where the ray of light came from prior to reflecting off an object.  
 
 Every [[color]] of light has a different [[wavelength]]. The shorter the wavelength, the more [[energy]] the light has. The speed of light does not depend on its energy. Going through translucent objects can slow light down by a very small amount. 
 
 White light is made up of all the different colors of light added together. When white light shines through a [[prism]], it splits up into different colors, becoming a [[spectrum]]. The spectrum contains all of the wavelengths of light that we can see. [[Red]] light has the longest wavelength, and violet (purple) light has the shortest. 
 
 Light with a wavelength shorter than violet is called [[ultraviolet]] light. [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s are forms of light with even shorter wavelengths than [[ultraviolet]]. Light with a wavelength longer than red is called [[infrared]] light. [[Radio wave]]s are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength longer than infrared light. The [[microwave]]s that are used to heat food in a [[microwave oven]] are also a form of electromagnetic radiation. Our eyes cannot see those kinds of energy, but there are some [[camera]]s that can see them. The various forms of light, both visible and invisible are the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. 
 
 When light is [[Refraction|refracted]] in raindrops, a [[rainbow]] is made. The raindrop acts like a [[prism]] and refracts the light until we can see the [[color]]s of the spectrum.[[File:Rainbow in Budapest.jpg|thumb|Rainbow in Budapest shows the colors of the visible spectrum.]] 
 
 === Color === 
 Light and color are forms of analog information. However, electronic cameras and computer displays work with digital information. Electronic cameras or document scanners make a digital version of a color image by separating out the full color image into separate [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] images. Later, a digital display uses pixels of just those three colors. [[Computer]] [[computer monitor|screens]] use only these three colors in different [[wikt:bright|brightness]] levels. The [[brain]] puts them together to see all of the other colors in the image. 
 
 People think of objects as having color. The color of objects is because the [[molecule]]s that make up the object absorb certain light waves, leaving the other light waves to bounce off. The human eye sees the wavelengths of all of the light that was not absorbed. This gives the brain with the impression of a color.
