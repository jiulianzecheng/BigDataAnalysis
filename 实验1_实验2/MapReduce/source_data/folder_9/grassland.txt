 A '''grassland''' is a [[biome]], an [[area]] of [[land]] that mostly has [[Grass|grasses]]. There are wild grasses, and there may be some trees.  
 
 Several parts of the world have grasslands. Grasslands are found in parts of [[Africa]], [[North America]], < ref > Chapman, Kim Alan, Adelheide Fischer, and Mary Ziegenhagen. 1998.

Grasslands with a few scattered trees are called [[Savanna|savannas]]. Others are called [[Prairie|prairies]] or [[Steppe|steppes]]. 
 
 == Evolutionary history ==  
 The [[graminoid]]s became widespread toward the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The appearance of mountains in the [[western United States]] during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs created a continental climate which was favourable to the evolution of grasslands. Animals which ate branches were replaced by animals which ate grass. Eating grass requires different teeth from eating branches. 
 
 About five million years ago in the Miocene, the grasslands grew. In the New World and Old World, forest [[Biome|biomes]] declined: and grasslands became much more widespread.  
 
 == Vegetation ==

 Grassland vegetation can vary greatly in height. The [[chalk]] grassland of southern England is quite short, often with small, delicate flowers.  
 
 Grass is quite tall in the [[Mississippi]]  " tallgrass [[prairie]] " , < ref > Crosby, Cindy. 2017. ''The tallgrass prairie: an introduction''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2017. ISBN 9780810135475 < /ref >  the [[South America|South American]] grasslands and the [[Africa|African]] [[Savanna|savannas]]. This provides a degree of cover for the smaller animals, and so increases the number of species which can live there. 
 
 Woody plants, shrubs or trees, may occur on some grasslands. < ref name= " autogenerated1 " > [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/grasslands.php University of California Museum of Paleontology Grasslands website]. Ucmp.berkeley.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-01. < /ref >  The root systems of perennial grasses and [[Forb|forbs]] (herbaceous flowering plants) form complex mats that hold the [[soil]] in place. 
 
 === Degradation === 
 When shrubs and bushes can grow more and replace grass, this is called [[woody plant encroachment]]. This change may be harmful. It may make the number of plant species fewer. It allows less water to go into the ground and animals have less to eat. From that perspective, woody encroachment may be a form of land degradation.  
 
 But this is not always the case. Encroachment can lead to good changes in nature. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Eldridge|first1=David J.|last2=Soliveres|first2=Santiago|date=2014|title=Are shrubs really a sign of declining ecosystem function?

 The tallgrass [[prairie]] is a [[Native (ecology)|native]] [[ecosystem]] of the drainage basin of the [[Mississippi]]. Retreating [[glaciers]] dropped [[moraine]] material about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped [[loess]] and organic matter accumulated. This made the soil. The prairie had the deepest level of [[topsoil]] recorded anywhere.  For 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than {{convert|240|e6acre|km2}} of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. < ref > {{cite web|title=Microbes beneath the surface|url=http://www.calacademy.org/sciencetoday/microbes-beneath-the-surface/5512848/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020122939/http://www.calacademy.org/sciencetoday/microbes-beneath-the-surface/5512848/|archive-date=20 October 2014|work=Science Today: California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=26 September 2014}} < /ref >   
 
 Animals such as [[buffalo]], [[elk]], [[deer]], and [[rabbits]] lived there. < ref > Manning, Richard. 1997. ''Grassland: The history, biology, politics, and promise of the American prairie''. London: Penguin Books. ISBN 9780140233889 < /ref >   The animals added [[nitrogen]] to the soil with their [[urine]] and [[faeces]].

 Between 1800 and 1930, most of this natural environment was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they called  " the Great American Desert "  or  " The Inland Sea "  into [[farm]]land. They replaced the old grasses with new ones, mostly [[wheat]] and [[maize]], grasses that are ecologically different from the original cereals. They replaced the bison with cattle, another kind of [[bovine]]. About 40% of the world's [[maize]] grows in the United States, mostly on land that formerly grew grass.  The grazing pattern of European cattle, the near-extermination of [[prairie dog]] < nowiki/ > s, and the plowing and cultivation of the land did the damage. Plowing cut tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Drainage changed the soil's water content, and [[soil erosion]] lost soil.  
 
 Estimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives. Perhaps less than 1% to 4%, mostly in  " scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers " . < ref name= " csa.com " / > 
 
 == Plants and animals == 
 In many other parts of the world, the grasslands have little rain or long dry periods. There are few trees because of the low rainfall. Thorny trees called [[acacia]]s are one of a handful of trees that are able to grow in some African savannas. [[Wildfire]]s are common and destroy trees. The animals also prevent trees from growing as they eat the tender sprouts before they can develop into grown trees. [[Elephant]]s are known to tear down grown-up trees and feed on their leaves, making trees even more scarce. < ref name= " Pous2 " / > 
 
 Grass can still grow because it survives the [[arid]]ity and the trampling of the animals. This is why grasslands can feed vast numbers of animals. < ref name=Pous2/ >   Animals include [[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s that eat mostly seeds.  [[Snake]]s, [[hawk]]s and [[eagle]]s eat mostly small animals.  Big animals, mostly [[grazer]]s, include [[zebra]]s, [[ostrich]]es, [[giraffe]]s, [[rhino]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[antelope]]s.
