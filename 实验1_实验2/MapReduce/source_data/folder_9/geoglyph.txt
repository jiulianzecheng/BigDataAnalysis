 A '''geoglyph''' is a large-scale [[man-made]] feature on the ground. Usually longer than 4 metres, it is made by placing [[rocks]], [[stone]]s, live trees, [[gravel]], or earth.  
 
 A ''positive'' geoglyph is formed by the arrangement and alignment of [[materials]] on the ground, while a ''negative'' geoglyph is formed by removing material to expose bare ground.
