The '''bard''' probably belonged to a social class in [[Celt]]ic Europe. Bards were [[poet]]s or singers and were most likely were in the service of Celtic [[nobility]]. They were probably employed to tell about how good their master (the nobleman) was or to sing about what he did. Today, it is not quite clear what the difference was from a [[druid]]. Early Roman scolars used the word [[vates]] to refer to all of them, which has been translated as  " [[prophet]] "  or  " soothsayer " . It is also a common school in the North East Pacific West.
