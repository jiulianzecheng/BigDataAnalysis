 In [[organic chemistry]], '''torquoselectivity''' describes [[electrocyclic reaction]]s that produce one [[isomer]] more than the other. An official definition is  " the preference for inward or outward [[rotation]] of [[substituent]]s in [[Conrotatory and disrotatory|conrotatory]] 
 or [[Conrotatory and disrotatory|disrotatory]] [[electrocyclic reaction]]s.

Am. Chem.

Torquoselectivity is different from the normal [[diastereoselectivity]] of [[pericyclic reaction]]s. Instead it is more [[selectivity]] beyond the [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules]]. The name comes from the idea that the [[substituent]]s in an electrocyclization appear to rotate during the reaction. The reaction produces a single product because only one direction of rotation was allowed (that is, the direction of rotation on the substituents was favored). The concept was originally developed by [[Kendall N. Houk]]. 
 
 When a chemical reaction [[ring closing reaction|closes a ring]], its torquoselectivity is the same as [[enantioselectivity]]. A single [[enantiomer]] of a cyclization product is formed from the selective ring closure of the starting material. In a typical electrocyclic ring closing, selection for either [[Conrotatory and disrotatory|conrotatory]] or [[Conrotatory and disrotatory|disrotatory]] reactions modes still produces two enantiomers. Torquoselectivity is a [[discrimination]] ''between'' these possible [[enantiomer]]s that requires [[asymmetric induction]].

'''Note:''' in the case shown, there is no reason for the reaction to be torquoselective and both products would be expected for any particular set of conditions.]] 
 
 Torquoselectivity also happens in selective electrocyclic reactions that break open rings. The different directions of rotation produce [[wikt:distinct|distinct]] [[structural isomers]]. In these cases, [[steric strain]] is often the driving force for the selectivity. Studies have shown that the selectivity can also be changed by the presence of [[electron donating group|electron donating]] and [[electron withdrawing group]]s. < ref name= " Houk electronics " > {{citation|title=Stereoselective Substituent Effects on Conrotatory Electrocyclic Reactions of Cyclobutenes|author=Kirmse, W.;Rondan, N.G.; Houk, K.N.|journal=[[J.

 Torquoselectivity can also apply to other mechanisms, including [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Lewis acid]] [[catalyst]]s, induction by [[wikt:neighboring|neighboring]] [[stereocenter]]s (in which case the torquoselectivity is a case of [[diastereoselectivity]]), and axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer. An example of axial-to-tetrahedral chirality transfer is shown below for the torquoselective [[Nazarov cyclization reaction]] of a chiral allenyl vinyl ketone. < ref name= " Frontier " > {{citation|author=Frontier, A.
