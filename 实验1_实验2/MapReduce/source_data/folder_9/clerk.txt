A '''clerk''' is someone who [[writing|writes]]. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''κληρικός'' (''klērikos''), meaning  " of the [[clergy]] " . < ref > [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=clerk & amp;searchmode=none, Clerk], Online Etymology Dictionary < /ref > < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2357871 Klerikos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott,  " A Greek-English Lexicon " , at Perseus < /ref >  Once only religious people could write, so a cleric meant a religious person. 
 
 In early [[mediaeval]] courts, writing was mainly done by clergy because most men, including nobles, could not read. In a medieval context, the word ''clerk'' meant  " [[scholar]] " . Now almost everyone can read and write, but the term 'clerk' still correctly applies to whole professions such as accountants, lawyers and civil servants. There is such a person as the Clerk of the [[House of Commons]], and every [[court]] in [[England]] has a legally qualified clerk. Their job is to keep the records, and run the behind-the-scenes business.
