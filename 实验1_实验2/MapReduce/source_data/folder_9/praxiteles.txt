 '''Praxiteles''' was the most famous of the [[sculptor]]s of the [[4th century BC]]. He was the first to sculpt the [[nude]] [[Woman|female form]] in a life-size statue. While no sculpture by Praxiteles is extant, numerous copies of his works have survived.  Several [[author]]s, including [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote of his works. Coins engraved with [[silhouette]]s of his various famous statuary types from the period still exist. His works include ''[[Hermes and the Infant Dionysus]]''.
