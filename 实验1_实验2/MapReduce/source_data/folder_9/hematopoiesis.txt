'''Hematopoiesis''' (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis)  is the formation of [[blood]] cells. < ref name= " Birbrair n/a–n/a " / >  In a healthy adult person, about 10 < sup > 11 < /sup > –10 < sup > 12 < /sup >  new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation. < ref name=T4 > Semester 4 medical lectures at Uppsala University 2008 by Leif Jansson < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |author1=Parslow,T G. |author2=Stites, DP. |author3=Terr, AI. |author4=Imboden JB. |title=Medical Immunology |year=1997 |publisher=Appleton  &  Lange |edition=1 |isbn=0-8385-6278-7}} < /ref > 
 
 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the [[stem cell]]s that give rise to all the other [[blood cell]]s. The process is called hematopoiesis. < ref name= " Birbrair n/a–n/a " > {{Cite journal|last=Birbrair, Alexander  &  Frenette, Paul S. 2016 |title=Niche heterogeneity in the bone marrow|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2016|volume=1370|issue=1|pages=82–96|doi=10.1111/nyas.13016|pmid=27015419|pmc=4938003|bibcode=2016NYASA1370...82B|issn=1749-6632}} < /ref >  They are in the core ([[bone marrow]]) of most bones.

 As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in [[gene expression]] which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type ([[cellular differentiation]]). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of [[proteins]] on the [[cell membrane|surface of the cell]]. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type. 
 
 HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other [[immune system]] disorders. < ref > Hematopoietic stem cells. 2011. Stem Cell Information.
