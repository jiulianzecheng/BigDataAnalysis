 '''Bryozoans''', also known as the '''Polyzoa''', '''Ectoprocta''' or '''moss animals''', are a [[phylum]] of small [[aquatic]] animals living in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. The colonies usually have a [[skeleton]] of [[calcium carbonate]]. Bryozoans have a long [[fossil]] history, starting in the [[Ordovician]]. In their life-style they resemble the [[polyp]]s which form [[coral]]. They generally like warm, [[tropical]] waters but live all over the world. There are about 5,000 living [[species]], and 15,000 fossil species are known. < ref name= " Clarkson " > Clarkson E.N.K. 1998. ''Invertebrate palaeontology and evolution''. 4th ed, Blackwell, Oxford. Chapter 6 Bryozoans, p143. < /ref >   
 
 The colonies are formed by tiny (~0.2mm) members called '''[[zooid]]s'''. < ref > The word 'zooid' is pronounced z√∂-oid, not like 'zoo'. < /ref >  They [[secretion|secrete]] tubes, usually of [[lime]] (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ), sometimes of [[chitin]], an [[organic chemistry|organic]] compound. The zooids in a colony are all [[clone]]s, produced by [[asexual reproduction]]. Despite this, most species produce different [[polymorphism|morphs]]: zooids with different functions. < ref > Just as in many animals, cells with the same basic genetics can form different tissues which have different functions. This is done by [[epigenetics]], where [[gene]]s are switched on and off differently in different tissues. < /ref >   
 
 All bryozoa have a '''lophophore'''. This is a ring of ten [[tentacle]]s surrounding the mouth, each tentacle covered with [[cilia]]. When feeding, the zooid extends the lophophore outwards; when resting it is withdrawn into the mouth to protect it from [[predator]]s. 
 
 == Anatomy  &  physiology== 
 [[Image:Costazia costazi.jpg|thumb|240px|''Costazia costazi'', a [[coral]]line bryozoan]] 
 Bryozoan [[skeleton]]s grow in a variety of shapes and patterns: mound-shaped, lacy fans, branching twigs, and even corkscrew-shaped. Their [[skeleton]]s have many tiny openings. Each opening is the home of ''zooid''. They have a body with a U-shaped gut, opening at the mouth and at the [[anus]]. They feed with their lophophore. The tentacles of the bryozoans are [[cilia]]ted. The beating of the cilia creates a current of water which drives food (mainly phyto[[plankton]]) towards the mouth. In some groups, notably some ctenostomes, a [[gizzard]] may be formed.   
 
 Bryozoans do not have a respiratory, or a [[blood]] system, because their small size allows diffusion of [[gas]]es and [[nutrient]]s. However, they do have a simple [[nervous system]], and [[muscle]]s, which together can quickly take the zooid down into its shelter. 
 
 One species of bryozoan, ''Bugula neritina'', is of interest as a source of chemicals, [[bryostatin]]s, which are under investigation as anti-cancer agents. 
 
 == Reproduction  &  development ==  
 Bryozoans can reproduce both sexually and asexually. All Bryozoans, as far as is known, are [[hermaphrodite]] (meaning they are both male and female). 
 
 All members of a colony are [[clone]]s: they are [[genetics|genetically]] identical, produced by [[asexual reproduction]]. This occurs by budding off new zooids from the first zooid. So the colony grows; this is the way a colony expands in size. If a piece of a bryozoan colony breaks off, the piece can continue to grow and will form a new colony. 
 
 All zooids in a colony are linked by strands of [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell]]s. The individual members of a colony, the zooids, are in some species generalised: they feed, and they can reproduce on occasion. But in most species the zooids are specialised to diffent functions. In this case the feeding zooids are called ''autozooids'', and the non-feeding members are called ''heterozooids''. Functions done by heterozooids include [[sexual reproduction]], protection, [[locomotion]], [[plumbing]], structural support. The functions of some heterozooids is still unknown. The commonest function is that [[Ovum|eggs]] are developed in brooding chambers (''ovicells'') on female or hermaphrodite heterozooids. There are variations in the details: sometimes a little complex of heterozooids produce larvae in a cooperative effort. < ref name= " McK " / > < sup > p4 < /sup > 
 
 Another way to describe the bryozoa which develop heterozooids is to say they are [[Polymorphism|polymorphic]]. This term is used in biology to describe the way a [[Genetics|genetically]] unified population develops into clearly distinct forms. The polymorphism is usually controlled by genetic [[switch]]ing mechanisms, but in bryozoa there is little knowledge of their genetics. 
 
 == Ecology == 
 [[Image:Freshwater Bryozoan234.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Freshwater bryozoan]] 
 Most species of Bryozoan live in marine environments. There are about 50 species which inhabit freshwater. In their aquatic [[habitat]]s, bryozoans live on all types of hard [[substrate]]s: [[sand]] grains, rocks, shells, [[wood]], blades of [[kelp]], pipes and ships may be heavily encrusted with bryozoans. Some bryozoan colonies, however, do not grow on solid substrates, but form colonies on [[sediment]]. While some species live at depths of 8,200 & nbsp;[[metre|m]], most bryozoans live in much shallower water. Most bryozoans are [[sessile]] and immobile, but a few colonies are able to creep about, and a few species of non-colonial bryozoans live and move about in the spaces between sand grains. One remarkable species makes its living while floating in the [[Southern Ocean]]. Several bryozoan species live in the [[Midwestern United States]], especially in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Kentucky]] which was once a part of a large ocean, the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. 
 
 Their diet consists of small microorganisms, including [[diatom]]s and other unicellular [[algae]]. In turn, bryozoans are preyed on by grazing organisms such as [[sea urchin]]s and [[fish]].  
 
 Bryozoans are almost entirely colony-forming animals. Many millions of individuals can form one colony. The colonies range from millimeters to meters in size, but the individuals that make up the colonies are tiny, usually less than a millimeter long. In each colony, different individuals have different functions. Some individuals gather up the food for the colony (autozooids), others depend on them (heterozooids). Some individuals are devoted to strengthening the colony (kenozooids), and still others to cleaning the colony (vibracula). There is only a single known solitary species, ''Monobryozoon ambulans'', which does not form colonies. 
 
 ==Fossils==

 [[Fossil]] bryozoans first appear in the early [[Ordovician]] and had a huge [[adaptive radiation]]. They were abundant throughout the [[Palaeozoic]] era: they were one of the most dominant groups of Palaeozoic fossils. < ref name=McK/ >  They were major components of seabed communities and, like modern-day bryozoans, played an important role in [[sediment]] stabilization and binding. They were food sources for many other [[benthic]] organisms. During the Lower [[Carboniferous]] ([[Mississippian]]) 354 to 323 million years ago, bryozoans were so common that their broken skeletons form entire [[limestone]] beds.  
 
 After a crash at the [[Permian & ndash;Triassic extinction event|Permian/Triassic boundary]], when almost all species went [[extinct]], bryozoans recovered in the later [[Mesozoic]] to become as successful as before. The bryozoan fossil record has more than 15,000 species. < ref name=McK > McKinney F.K. and Jackson J.B.C. 1989. ''Bryozoan evolution''. Unwin Hyman, Boston. < /ref >   
 
 Most fossil bryozoans have mineralized skeletons. The skeletons of individual zooids vary from tubular to box-shaped and contain a terminal aperture from which the lophophore is protruded to feed. No pores are present in the great majority of Ordovician bryozoans, but skeletal evidence shows that [[epithelium|epithelia]] were continuous from one zooid to the next. 
 
 One of the most important events during bryozoan evolution was the acquisition of a calcareous skeleton and the mechanism of tentacle protrusion. The rigidity of the outer body walls gave protection against predators, a greater degree of zooid connection, and the evolution of massive colony forms.
