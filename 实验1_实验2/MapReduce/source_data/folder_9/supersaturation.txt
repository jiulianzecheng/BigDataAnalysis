'''Supersaturation''' in chemical [[solution]]s is when a solution contains more of a [[solute]] than can be dissolved in it. This usually makes some of the solute separate itself from the solution. 
 
 == Examples == 
 *[[Rain]] happens in a supersaturated solution of water in air. 
 *[[Carbonated water]] is a supersaturated solution of [[carbon dioxide]] gas in [[water]].  It is stored at very high [[pressure]] in a [[bottle]].  This lets the water dissolve more carbon dioxide gas than it can at normal pressure.  When the bottle is opened, the pressure falls to the normal [[atmospheric pressure]], and the carbon dioxide gas escapes slowly.  Certain things such as small bubbles in the bottle can make this process faster.  Such bubbles can be caused by shaking the bottle.  Another solute such as [[sugar]] [[powder]] or a [[Widget (beer)|widget]] can also trigger precipitation. 
 
 * A [[Diet Coke and Mentos eruption]] is an extreme example. Some drinks such as [[ale]]s and [[stout]]s rely on this effect to produce the 'head' on the surface of the poured product.
