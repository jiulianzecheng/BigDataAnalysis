 === Metro === 
 The Yerevan Metro is a [[rapid transit]] system that serves the capital city.

 from the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Independence of the Republic of Armenia.

 Yerevan is Armenia's industrial, transportation, and cultural center. Manufactures include chemicals, primary metals, [[machinery]], [[rubber]] products, plastics, [[textiles]], and processed food.
