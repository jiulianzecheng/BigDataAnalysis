{{Politics of the Isle of Man}} 
 '''Tynwald''' ({{lang-gv|Tinvaal}}), or more formally, the '''High Court of Tynwald''' ({{lang-gv|Ard-whaiyl Tinvaal}}) or '''Tynwald Court''', is claimed to be the oldest [[parliament]] in continuous existence in the world, dating back over 1000 years. 
 
 == Overview == 
 It rules the [[Isle of Man]], and while the island is a [[Crown dependency]], this ancient form of government enjoys a large amount of political power.   
 
 Tynwald is separated into 2 houses (this is called a  " Bicameral "  parliament, meaning it has 2 chambers) - the [[House of Keys]], which is elected by the people of the Isle of Man, and the [[Legislative Council]], which is not directly elected - instead, other members of the Legislative Council elect members of the House of Keys (MHK's) to sit on it. 
 
 Both houses of Tynwald sit at the same time on [[Tynwald day]], at the site of the original parliament - Tynwald Hill - in St. John's, a small village near [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], and once a month at Parliament House in the Island's capital, [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]].   The rest of the time, they sit separately at Parliament House, with the House of Keys making most of the laws, and the Legislative Council doing most of the work of changing and [[Revision|revising]] them.  
 
 [[King Charles III]]  is acknowledged as the [[Lord of Mann]]. 
 
 Tynwald can trace its descent from the [[Viking]] and [[Norse]] that first colonized the Isle of Man.
