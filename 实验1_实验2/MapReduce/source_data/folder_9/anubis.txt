 '''Anubis''' is the protector of the gates to the Underworld, Osiris replaced him as the god of the dead. He looks like a man with the head of a [[Pharaoh Hound]], called Tesem. 
 
 == Anubis's Purpose == 
 [[File:Anubis MK1888.png|thumb|208x208px|Anubis with a human body and a jackal head.]] 
 Anubis, as the god of death and the afterlife, was closely associated with [[mummification]] and burial rites. Egyptian jackals had an association with the dead, as well. They were often found digging up buried bodies and eating them, which may be why Anubis was depicted as part jackal. The priests who mummified the  [[pharaoh]]s wore costumes to make them appear like Tesem (Pharaoh hound). 
 
 The Egyptian people believed that Anubis helped decide the fate of the dead in the afterlife. The heart of the dead was weighed against the feather of truth (representing the goddess [[Ma'at]]), to see if the deceased was worthy of entering the afterlife. If the person had lived an evil life, his or her heart would be heavy with evil, and he or she would be eaten by [[Ammit]] (the Devourer). If a person was kind and good, the heart would be light, he or she could continue on to the afterlife safe and sound to meet Osiris.

 Anubis, in the [[Book of the Dead]]. Is shown giving equality through research of weighing the human heart to a feather. Any honesty will make the feather heavier than the heart on the scale. 
 
 == In Greece and Rome == 
 In later times, during the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, as their functions were similar, Anubis came to be identified as the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Hermes]], becoming [[Hermanubis]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://pantheon.org/|title=Encyclopedia Mythica|website=pantheon.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.babylon-software.com/definition/Hermanubis/English|title=Hermanubis- Free definitions by Babylon|website=www.babylon-software.com|access-date=2019-02-11|archive-date=2018-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116183144/https://www.babylon-software.com/definition/Hermanubis/English|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The centre of this [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] was in ''uten-ha''/''Sa-ka''/ [[Cynopolis]], a place whose Greek name simply means  " city of dogs " . In Book XI of   " [[The Golden Ass]] "  by [[Apuleius]], we find evidence that the worship of this god was maintained in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] at least up to the 2nd century. Indeed, it was revealed that [[Hermanubis]] also appeared in the [[alchemy|alchemical]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetical]] literature of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. 
 
 Although the Greeks and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] typically scorned Egypt's animal-headed gods as bizarre and primitive (they mockingly called Anubis the  " Barker " ), Anubis was sometimes associated with [[Sirius]] in heaven, and [[Cerberus]] in the underworld.
