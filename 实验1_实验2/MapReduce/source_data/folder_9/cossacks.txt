 The '''Cossacks''' ({{lang-uk|Козаки}}) (from [[Cuman language|Cuman]] ''cosac'', meaning  " free man " ) < ref > For a detailed analysis, see {{cite journal |author-link=Omeljan Pritsak |first1=Omeljan |last1=Pritsak |title=The Turkic Etymology of the Word Qazaq 'Cossack' |journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies |volume=28 |issue=1–4 |date=2006–2007 |pages=237–XII}} < /ref >  were a group of nomadic [[Slavs|East Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] warrior people originating in the [[steppe]]s of [[Ukraine]]. They are famous for their sense of being free. They are also well known for their [[military]] skill, mostly as [[cavalry]] swordsmen and archers.  
 
 The Ukrainian Cossacks first rose as a warrior group of East Slavic Orthodox Christian horsemen who took up a military tradition and eventually created a Cossack Federation in the steppes of [[Ukraine]].  They first rose up in the 15th century in response to the raids of [[Tatars]] and the conquests of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  During Ottoman occupation of the western bank of Ukraine, the Cossacks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and were responsible for destroying Ottoman influence in the region.  The Ottomans lost control over Ukraine and parts of [[Romania]] also due to the Cossack rebels and raiders. The Cossacks captured many Ottoman outposts in the Ukrainian steppes and created a Cossack Hetmanate (''state''). They sometimes served the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces and later fought against them, taking Ukraine.  Thus, the Cossacks are considered in Ukraine to be the founders of modern [[Ukraine]] since they expelled the Ottomans and Polish from Ukraine and created an independent state for themselves. 
 
 The name Cossack itself literally means  " free man " . The term was first used in the year [[1395]].{{fact|date=August 2020}} The most well known Cossacks are the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] Cossacks from [[Zaporizhzhia]] and the [[Russians|Russian]] Cossacks (Kazaks) from [[Don River|Don]], [[Terek]], [[Kuban]] and [[Ural]] areas. They started after the [[Mongol]]s attacked [[Kievan Rus]]. Eventually Russian Cossacks guarded land for the Russian government. Cossacks were in the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army in some wars throughout the 1800s and 1900s. They were mostly responsible for conquering land in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]] for the [[Russian Empire]]. In behalf of the Russian Imperial Empire, they conquered lands as far east as [[Siberia]] and even in [[Alaska]] which they conquered. Alaska was later sold to the [[USA]] however the lands they conquered in the far east [[Russia]] such as [[Siberia]] are still part of Russia today making Russia the largest country in the world by land size. They conquered places in Caucasus too for example the rebellious states of [[Chechnya]] and [[Dagestan]]. They were also responsible for destroying many Turkic states in both the Caucasus and [[Central Asia]] due to their conquests for the Russian Empire. They subdued [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] and were responsible for adding these states to the huge [[Russian Empire]]. They also invaded [[Armenia]] due to calls of support by the [[Armenians]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and in doing so, they conquered [[Azerbaijan]] and annexed both Armenia and Azerbaijan to their empire and defeated the Ottomans many times in northeastern [[Turkey]]. In the [[Russian Civil War]] most fought against the [[Red Army]] but some were  " '''Red Cossacks''' "  who fought on behalf of the Bolsheviks. In [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the Cossacks' life was subject to a lot of [[Bolshevik]] attacks and Cossack lands survived several [[famine]]s. Cossack armies fought on both sides in the [[Second World War]]. In Russia today, Cossacks are ethnic descendants or are in the Cossack army and often both.
