 == Founding and the Sputnik crisis == 
 NASA was preceded by the  " [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] "  (NACA). NACA was a US federal agency founded on March 3, 1915 to undertake, promote, and institutionalize [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] research. On October 1, 1958 the agency was dissolved, and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). < ref name= " erickson " > {{cite book|url=http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf|title=Into the Unknown Together - The DOD, NASA, and Early Spaceflight|last=Erickson|first=Mark|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58566-140-4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030308054904/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf|archive-date=March 8, 2003}} < /ref >  NASA was founded to compete with the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[space race]]. In the 1950s and 1960s there was a space race between the [[US]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - now called [[Russia]]. The Soviets started first launching [[Sputnik|Sputnik 1]], the first object made by people to go into [[orbit]], in October 1957. The Americans were worried by this. It caused a [[wikt:crisis|crisis]] known as the Sputnik Crisis as the Americans feared the Russians might start building weapons in space. This all happened at a time called the [[Cold War]] when the US and the Soviet Union were always very close to [[war]]. 
 
 == Space flight programs == 
 === Project Mercury (1958 & ndash;1963) === 
 [[File:Glenn62.jpg|thumb|[[John Glenn]] on Friendship 7: first US flight to [[orbit]], 1962]] 
 Originally NASA was very small with only four [[laboratory|laboratories]] and around eighty people working there. [[Germany|German]] [[engineer]]s and scientists led by [[Wernher von Braun]] helped them build [[rocket]]s. They had helped build the [[V-2]] missile in Germany during [[World War II]] < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.reformation.org/wernher-von-braun.html |title=Wernher von Braun in SS uniform |access-date=2008-07-13 |publisher=reformation.org |archive-date=2019-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923153153/http://www.reformation.org/wernher-von-braun.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and the [[Redstone]] missile for the [[US Army]] afterwards. Their Army missile laboratory was transferred to NASA. 
 
 In 1960 they set up the Mercury project. The Mercury Project [[Spacecraft|space missions]] were designed by NASA, mostly to test if [[humans]] could survive in [[Outer space|space]]. After they proved it was possible for people to live in space they moved on. 
 
 On May 15th 1961 astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American in space. Less than a year later, [[John Glenn]] became the first American to [[orbit]] or circle the [[Earth]]. He did so in a [[spacecraft]] called Friendship 7. Once the Mercury Project proved that humans could live in space, the Gemini Project was started. Less than a year after it began, the Apollo Program also began. 
 
 === Project Gemini (1961 & ndash;1966) === 
 [[File:Ed White performs first U.S. spacewalk - GPN-2006-000025-crop.jpg|thumb|[[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]] on [[Gemini 4]]: first US [[spacewalk]], 1965]] 
 After the success of Mercury, NASA realized it had to start planning for its missions to [[the Moon]]. The [[Gemini (spacecraft)|Gemini]] [[spacecraft]] was built for two men. It was still small and [[wikt:cramp|cramp]]ed similar to the Mercury capsule, but allowed for more freedom of movement. Project Gemini proved that two spacecraft could rendezvous (meet and dock) in space. [[Neil Armstrong]], the first man on [[the Moon]], was also on the first Gemini flight to dock with another spacecraft in outer space. The Gemini spacecraft did not dock with another spacecraft with people in it. Instead, it docked with a rocket called  " [[Agena]] target vehicle " . The last few Gemini missions were science experiments and [[spacewalk]]s designed to prepare for the Apollo Program, which would land human beings on [[the Moon]]. 
 
 === Apollo program (1961 & ndash;1972) === 
 {{main|Apollo program}} 
 [[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag-crop.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]]: [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the [[Moon]], 1969]] 
 The Apollo program was started by [[US President|President]] [[John F Kennedy]] in the 1960s. The program was made of 16 missions designed to send a man to [[the Moon]] and return him safely back to [[Earth]]. The first Apollo mission, [[Apollo 1]], ended in disaster when a [[fire]] in the command module killed all the astronauts on board. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/ |title=Apollo 1 - A history of NASA |access-date= 2008-07-14 }} < /ref >  The [[Apollo 8]] and [[Apollo 10|10]] missions went to the moon. They tested equipment and took [[photography|photos]] but did not land. 
 
 The project's main success came in 1969 when [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed on the Moon as part of [[Apollo 11]]. The mission was a big success for NASA and over six million people watched it worldwide. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/pasa/on_eagles_wings.pdf |title=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |access-date=2008-07-13|publisher=CSIRO}} < /ref >  After Apollo 11, six more Apollo flights went to the moon. Five of them landed. The one that did not land, [[Apollo 13]], had to abort its mission when an [[oxygen]] tank exploded in the spaceship. [[Apollo 17]] was the last mission to land on [[the Moon]]. 
 
 === Skylab (1965 & ndash;1979) === 
 {{main|Skylab}} 
 [[File:Skylab (SL-4).jpg|thumb|Skylab in 1974, as seen from the [[Skylab 4]] [[CSM]]]] 
 After [[Congress]] stopped the Moon landings, NASA needed a new direction. Using a leftover [[Saturn V]] rocket, the giant rocket that sent men to [[the Moon]], they created a space station that orbited above the Earth. This space station was called Skylab. Skylab was very big on the inside, even bigger than a small house. Skylab was visited by Apollo spacecrafts. There were three missions to Skylab. Each of them carried important experiments. The last crewed mission, [[Skylab 4]], spent 84 & nbsp;days, 1 & nbsp;hour, 15 & nbsp;minutes, 30 & nbsp;seconds, longer than any space mission had spent until 1977. Skylab broke up in the atmosphere in 1979. 
 
 === Apollo & ndash;Soyuz Test Project (1972 & ndash;1975) === 
 [[File:Portrait of ASTP crews - restoration-crop.jpg|thumb|Soviet and American crews with Apollo & ndash;Soyuz model, 1975]] 
 During the [[Space Race]], the Soviets had designed their own spacecraft to fly to [[the Moon]]. Their spacecraft was called [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]. The Soviets never landed on the Moon, they had too many problems. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/sovietlunarlanding.html|title=Soviet Lunar Landing |publisher=Encyclopaedia Astronautica|access-date=2019-05-18}} < /ref >  Instead, they started creating small space stations. The Soyuz spacecraft is what they used to go to these space stations. US and Soviet Union were part of the [[Cold War]]. In order to make peace between Soviet Union and US, they decided they would dock an Apollo spacecraft to a Soyuz spacecraft in space. After docking, the crews performed experiments and learned about each other's cultures. Apollo & ndash;Soyuz was the last flight of the Apollo spacecraft. It has never been used since, and as of 2020, there are no plans for it to be used again. 
 
 === Space Shuttle program (1972–2011) === 
 {{main|Space Shuttle}} 
 [[File:Shuttle-a.jpg|thumb|A Space Shuttle taking off]] 
 In the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]] NASA began to concentrate on building [[Space Shuttle]]s. Four Shuttles were built in 1985. The first to launch was the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] on April 12, 1981. At this time the public began to lose interest in the space program and NASA faced [[budget cut]]s. They had planned for the Space Shuttles to cost less as they could be used more than once. But eventually it turned out the Space Shuttles were more expensive as building them in the first place cost more money than normal. There were further problems for NASA after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] disintegrated in flight in 1986, killing all seven of its astronauts. The incident is known as the [[Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster|Challenger Disaster]]. 
 
 The Challenger Disaster forced NASA to think about the way they worked. The entire Space Shuttle fleet was suspended for a year. < ref > {{cite web|title=NASA Shuttle Fleet Grounded after Challenger explosion|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/jul2005/shut-j29.shtml|website=wsws.org}} < /ref >  After that, NASA launched the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] into orbit. Its most famous photo was the [[Hubble Deep Field]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Hubble Deep Field - The most important image ever taken?|url=http://www.deepastronomy.com/hubble-deep-field.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410145115/http://www.deepastronomy.com/hubble-deep-field.html|archive-date=2008-04-10|website=Deep Astronomy}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2011, NASA shut down the Space Shuttle program. They were more expensive to use than other launch vehicles. 
 
 === International Space Station (1993 & ndash;present) === 
 {{main|International Space Station}} 
 [[File:ISS-56 International Space Station fly-around (04).jpg|thumb|International Space Station, as seen by a [[Soyuz spacecraft]]]] 
 In the early 1980s, NASA planned Space Station Freedom as a [[wikt:counterpart|counterpart]] to the Soviet [[Salyut]] and [[Mir]] space stations. It never left the drawing board and, with the end of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cold War]], it was cancelled. The end of the [[Space Race]] prompted the U.S. administration officials to start negotiations with international partners Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada in the early 1990s in order to build the International Space Station. This project was first announced in 1993 and was called Space Station Alpha. < ref name= " gao " > {{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151975.pdf |title=''Space Station: Impact of the Expanded Russian Role on Funding and Research''|access-date=2006-11-03 |author=GAO |date= June 1994 |publisher=GAO }} < /ref >  It was planned to combine the proposed space stations of all participating space agencies: NASA's Space Station Freedom, Russia's [[Mir-2]] (the successor to the Mir Space Station, the core of which is now Zvezda) and ESA's [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] that was planned to be a stand-alone spacelab. 
 
 === Curiosity rover (2011 & ndash;present) === 
 {{main|Curiosity (rover)}} 
 ''Curiosity'' is a [[car]]-sized [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]. It was made to [[Space exploration|explore]] the [[Gale (crater)|crater Gale]] on [[Mars]]. ''Curiosity'' was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] on November 26, 2011, at 15:02 & nbsp;UTC and landed on [[Aeolis Palus]] inside Gale on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17 & nbsp;UTC. The [[Bradbury Landing]] site was less than {{convert|2.4|km|abbr=off}} from where the rover landed after a {{convert|350|e6mi|e6km|abbr=off|order=flip}} journey. The goals of the rover include an [[wikt:investigation|investigation]] of the Martian [[climate]] and [[geology]].

 In 2069, NASA plans to send a [[space probe]] to [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star system to the Sun. The proposed launch would be on the 100th anniversary of the first Moon landing, [[Apollo 11]].[https://steemit.com/technology/@alexanderrigov/nasa-is-already-planning-a-mission-to-alpha-centauri-but-do-not-expect-it-anytime-soon] 
 
 NASA is continuing operations include missions to the [[planet]]s [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and [[Pluto]]. Missions to [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] are also planned for the future. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4599634.stm|title=BBC Mission guide: New Horizons |access-date=2008-07-14 |publisher=BBC}} < /ref > 
 
 == NASA Missions == 
 [[File:Voyager spacecraft model.png|thumb|Voyager spacecraft]] 
 NASA has launched over 500 missions. Over 150 missions had [[humans]] on board. Such ''manned'' missions are the most expensive and make the most news but the majority of launches are for [[space exploration]], science, and other purposes that do not need people. NASA [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] and the [[Voyager program]] have visited every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]]. Four NASA spacecraft have left the Solar System, [[Voyager 1]], [[Voyager 2]], [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]], while the fifth, a [[New Horizons|New Horizons spacecraft]] is estimated to exit the solar system by 2048. As of 2022 Voyager 1 is 23,447,000,000 (23.4 billion) [[kilometer]]s away from [[Earth]] and [[Voyager 2]] was at a distance 19,474,000,000 (19.4 billion) kilometres away from Earth. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|title=Interstellar Traveler: NASA's Voyager 1 Probe On 40,000-Year Trek to Distant Star|last=Spaceflight|first=Mike Wall 2013-09-13T09:09:40Z|website=Space.com|date=13 September 2013 |language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[New Horizons]] [[spacecraft]] flew past [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in February 2007, studying some of the planet's [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. On July 14, 2015 the craft flew by Pluto, took high resolution pictures of the planet's surface and analysed the [[chemical]] properties of its [[atmosphere]]. 
 
 == Use of the metric system == 
 Like other scientific organizations, NASA conducts most of its measurements in the international system ([[metric system]]). This is partially due to federal law requiring that most US government programs be done in the international system. In the 1980s, NASA transitioned to the metric system, but was still using US customary \ imperial units into the 1990s. In September 1999, a [[mixup]] (or mistake) between imperial and metric units resulted in the loss of the [[Mars Climate Orbiter]].
