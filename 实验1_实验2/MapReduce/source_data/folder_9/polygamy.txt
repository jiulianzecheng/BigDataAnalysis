 '''Polygamy''' is a word that comes from late [[Greek language|Greek]]. It can be translated as ''many [[marriage]]s''. It refers to any form of marriage where a person has ''more than one [[:wikt:simple:spouse|spouse]]''. < ref > [http://www.socialsciencedictionary.org/index.php?title=Polygamy Polygamy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428153859/http://www.socialsciencedictionary.org/index.php?title=Polygamy |date=2008-04-28 }} at socialsciencedictionary.org < /ref >  There is also a concept called '''group marriage'''. In group marriage, all the (adult) members of the group are responsible for all the children. 
   
 A man being married to more than one woman at the same time is called '''polygyny'''. A woman being married to more than one man at the same time is called '''polyandry'''.  
 *''These terms are used in [[zoology]]''. They are under the titles: [[Polygyny in animals]] and [[Polyandry in animals]]. 
 
 Both forms have occurred in humans. Polygyny is much more common, and is practised by millions of people, mostly in [[Muslim]] and [[Africa]]n countries. According to Muslim  
 [[Sharia]] [[law]], a man can have many [[wives]] at the same time. In many African [[Paganism|Pagan]] [[religion]]s, polygamy is a common [[custom]], and there is also often no limit to the number of women a man can marry. In most non-Muslim and non-African countries, polygamy is [[:wikt:illegal|illegal]], and a person who has more than one spouse can be prosecuted for [[bigamy]]. Some countries, including [[India]], only permit Muslims to be polygamous. 
 
 == The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints == 
 Polygamy is one of the beliefs of Mormon [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]]. These are Mormons (members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) who strictly follow the teachings of [[Joseph Smith]]. < ref name=Bennion23 > Janet Bennion, ''Polygamy in Primetime: Media, Gender, and Politics in Mormon Fundamentalism'' (Waltham, MA: Brandeis University Press, 2012), p. 23 < /ref >  Smith felt it was his job to restore plural marriage to the earth. He was married to 33 women. < ref name=Bennion23/ >  In 1890 the Mormon church officially stopped  " celestial marriages "  (polygamy). < ref name=Gordon1 > Sarah Barringer Gordon, ''The Mormon Question: Polygamy and Constitutional Conflict in Nineteenth-Century America'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 1 < /ref >  Church members who continue to practice plural marriage are [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the church. 
 
 == Sethepu/Isithembu == 
 [[Isithembu]] (Sethepu) is the [[Africa]]n practice of a man being able to have more than one [[wife]] at the same time. < ref name=Futhwa56 > Fezekile Futhwa, ''Setho: Afrikan Thought and Belief System'' (Alberton, South Africa: Nalane ka Fezekile Futhwa, 2011), p. 56 < /ref >   A man may marry again if his current wife or wives cannot have children. He keeps his current wife or wives as divorce is not allowed. < ref name=Futhwa56/ >  A man may marry again if his current wife or wives have not produced male children. He can marry again if a wife does not want children. In some places, if a man dies, his wife or wives are married to his brother. < ref name=Futhwa56/ >  This way his family is cared for. The [[Swaziland|Swazi]] culture says a man should have many wives. Polygamy (Isithembu) is normal for men. < ref name=Brown89 > A. R. Radcliffe-Brown; Cyril Daryll Forde, ''African systems of kinship and marriage'' (London; New York: Oxford University Press, 1950), p. 89 < /ref >  Woman should have children, which is normal for them. < ref name=Brown89/ >
