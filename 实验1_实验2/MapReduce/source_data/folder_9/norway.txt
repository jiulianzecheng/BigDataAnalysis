 '''Norway''' is a [[country]] in the north of [[Europe]]. It is the western part of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[peninsula]].  The [[mainland]] of Norway is surrounded by the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the west side, and [[border]]s [[Russia]], [[Finland]], and [[Sweden]] to the east.  The southern coast touches the [[Oslofjord]], [[Skagerrak]], and the [[North Sea]]. 
 
 The Monarchy of Norway has been [[independent]] since 1814. Its [[head of state]] is a king - [[Harald V of Norway|Harald the 5th]] (as of 2022).  The national day is May 17, which celebrates Norway's [[constitution]] of 1814. The parliament is called ''Stortinget'' and its members are [[election|elected]] by the people every 4 years. 
 
 About 5 million people live in Norway.  The [[Capital (city)|capital]] is the city of [[Oslo]]. 
 
 [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is the national language. There are two official written versions of Norwegian called ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]''. 
 
 The [[Northern Sami]] language is spoken by around 90% of those who speak one of Norway's 3 Sami languages. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://snl.no/nordsamisk|title=nordsamisk|first=Svenn-Egil Knutsen|last=Duolljá|date=26 November 2018|via=Store norske leksikon|access-date=20 January 2019|archive-date=10 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510150056/https://snl.no/nordsamisk|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Northern Sami is also an official language in a number of [[municipality|municipalities]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 The battle of Hafrsfjord (872 A.D.) resulted in small kingdoms becoming one larger kingdom, ruled by [[Harald Fairhair]]. After the king's death, again there were smaller kingdoms, inside Norway. < ref > [[Solveig Aareskjold]].

 The results of the election in 1882, led to [[parlamentarism]] becoming part of Norway's [[political system]]; the votes of the  " swamp men "  decided the outcome of the election; they included teachers, artists and [[craftsmen]] who were not poor but also did not own land; ownership of land or a contract to use land was necessary to get [[voting right]]s; the  " swamp men "  had bough cheap land which was nearly useless, except for getting a [[right to vote]]. < ref name=SwampMenDagsavisen > {{cite web|url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/stemmerettskampens-hemmelige-vapen-1.1020325|title=En liten myrflekk til fem kr ga deg stemmerett, og det ble avgjørende i 1882|website=www.dagsavisen.no|access-date=2019-01-20|archive-date=2017-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904181333/http://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/stemmerettskampens-hemmelige-vapen-1.1020325|url-status=live}} < /ref >

 The end of the '''[[Union of Sweden and Norway]]''', was  on 7 June 1905, when Norway got its [[independence]]. 
 
 In 1905 [[Prince Carl of Denmark]] was elected [[King of Norway]]. His name as a king, was [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].

 In 1952 Norway became a member of [[NATO]]. 
 
 Oil was found in Norway's part of the [[North Sea]], during the 1960s; the oil was found under the [[sea floor]]. 
 
 ===Royal family since 1905===

Their son, Prince Alexander of Denmark, became Crown Prince Olav and followed after his father as [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]] in 1957.

 Most people in Norway are ethnic Norwegians. Norwegians speak a language that is related to German and English. Swedish and Danish are so close to Norwegian that most Norwegians understand them. Across Norway, many different dialects are spoken. Norwegians disagree on how to make one correct written language. Therefore, there are two standard languages, Bokmål and Nynorsk. Nynorsk is used in writing in most of the western areas and in the central mountains. Bokmål is written by most people in the rest of the country. 
 
 A native population of Norway, the [[Sámi]], has its home in the northern parts of the country. Their language is not at all related to Norwegian. In some parishes in the far north, they make up the majority of people. Many Sami now live outside the Sami homeland, mostly in Oslo and other big cities. Earlier, Sami people were forced to speak Norwegian in school. Now Sami is taught as the first language in school for Sami children, and Norwegian is the first foreign language. 
 
 Many immigrants have come to Norway in the last 30–40 years. They mostly live in and around Oslo, and in the other big cities. Many immigrants come from nearby countries, like Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Russia. There are also many from countries far away, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Somalia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Vietnam]].

 === Tourism === 
 Among tourists to Norway, more come from [[Germany]] than from any other country. There are also many Swedes, Danes, British, Dutch and Italians visiting Norway. The Swedes and Danes often come in winter to go skiing. The others mainly come in summer. Many people visit Norway to see the Northern Lights, also known as the 'Aurora Borealis'. 
 
 == Media == 
 The largest national newspapers in Norway are [[Verdens Gang]] (VG), [[Aftenposten]] and [[Dagbladet]]. 
 
 == Culture == 
 Norwegian culture can be compared to English culture in the way that it is considered a bad thing to show off, as opposed to the US, where this is more acceptable. This is a big aspect of Norwegian culture, and it is related to the philosophy of [[egalitarianism]]. Because of this, people will understate things, for example if a Norwegian says something is good or nice, it can mean that it's really great.

 == Politics == 
 In Norway power is shared among three branches: The justice sector, the government and the [[parliament]] ([[Stortinget]]). Norway also has a king, [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]], but he does not have any real power and acts as a symbol and [[ambassador]]. This form of government is called a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Elections are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or [[coalition]] of parties that gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, the winners work together to find out who the [[prime minister]] should be, as well as who the other [[Minister (government)|ministers]] should be. 
 
 Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Norway, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]:

 * [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] (Sosialistisk venstreparti): The party is not very radical and is concerned with environmental issues as well as education. The party is traditionally regarded as the  " teacher's party "  because of their focus on learning and school. One might call SV more of a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party than a socialist party, since their socialist views have faded over the years. They were more radical in the 1970s and 80s.  
 * [[Norwegian Labour Party]] (Arbeiderpartiet): The Labour Party is the biggest party in Norway. They work for a strong economy with many regulations on private businesses, and are traditionally the party for workers, securing labour rights and the [[welfare state]].  
 * [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] (Senterpartiet): The Centre Party used to be known as the farmer's party; they no longer use this name, but still they are mostly popular in the countryside and other rural regions, since they work for the environment and protection of Norwegian farmers. For example, raising [[tariff]]s, or putting [[tax]]es on [[import]]s, to make foreign food cost more so that people will buy from Norwegian farmers. This is called [[protectionism]].  
 * [[Green party|Green Party]] (Miljøpartiet de Grønne): The Green party works for the environment only, and has recently been gaining a lot of popularity for its radical politics. They are mostly a left-side party, but will switch sides if it helps the environment.  
 * [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] (Venstre): Even though it is called Left in English, it is actually a [[social liberal]] party that belongs to the centre-right side of Norwegian politics. They work for liberal rights like [[freedom of speech]], [[gender equality]] and they are also concerned with environment. Because of this they heavily support [[public transport]]. 
 * Kristelig Folkeparti: The Christian People's Party is at present more active in local than national politics. 
 * [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] (Høgre): It is a conservative party and is the second biggest party in Norway. It works for a [[free market]], liberal rights and equality of opportunity. They are friendly towards private businesses and support economic growth by making taxes smaller, so that more people can start businesses.
