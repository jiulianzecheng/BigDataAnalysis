The '''heliosphere''' is the [[magnetosphere]], [[stellar wind]] bubble and outermost atmospheric layer of the [[Sun]].

 The '''heliosphere''' is the cavity made by the Sun in the [[interstellar medium]]. Almost all of the material in the heliosphere comes from the [[Sun]] itself.  
 
 For the first ten billion kilometres of its radius, the solar wind travels at over a million kilometres per hour. < ref name=speed > {{cite web|author=Dr. David H.

The point where the solar wind slows down is the '''termination shock'''; the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is called the '''heliopause'''; the point where the interstellar medium, travelling in the opposite direction, slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the '''bow shock'''.  
 
 ==Solar wind== 
 {{main|Solar wind}} 
 
 The solar wind is made of particles. They are charged ([[ion]]ized) atoms from the solar [[corona]], and fields, in particular [[magnetic field]]s. As the Sun [[rotation|rotate]]s once in about 27 days, the magnetic field transported by the [[solar wind]] gets wrapped into a spiral. Differences in the Sun's magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storm]]s in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. 
 
 In March 2005, measurements by the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) showed that the heliosphere, the solar wind-filled volume which prevents the solar system from becoming embedded in the local (ambient) interstellar medium, is not [[Symmetry|axisymmetrical]], but is distorted, very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field. < ref name= " esaDistortionHeliosphere " > {{cite journal
