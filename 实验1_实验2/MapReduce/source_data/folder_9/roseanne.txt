 '''''Roseanne''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[television programme|television]] [[sitcom]]. It was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1988 to 1997. It stars [[comedian]] [[Roseanne Barr]]. The series is about a [[working-class]] family living in [[fiction]]al [[city]] of Lanford, [[Illinois]]. For many years, ''Roseanne'' was more [[truth]]ful than other series of the time in how it showed family life. They dealt with tough [[wikt:subject|subjects]], for example [[poverty]], [[alcoholism]], [[narcotics]], [[sex]], [[menarche|first menstrual periods]], [[masturbation]], [[obesity]], [[feminism]], [[domestic violence]], [[nudity]] and [[homosexuality]]. Another important thing in the series was Roseanne's [[wikt:control|control]] in raising her children. Her husband Dan ([[John Goodman]]) felt as though he had no say in their house. ''Roseanne'' was important for [[women]] because it was one of the first series to put an overweight, powerful, yet smart woman as [[protagonist|the main]] [[fictional character|character]]. 
 
 The series had very high viewing figures from its start. It spent its first six [[season]]s in the top five of the [[Nielsen ratings]]. During the seventh season the series dropped some in ratings, but still stayed in the top 10 of the Nielsen ratings. However, during its ninth, and final season, the show's ratings dropped much and had fallen out of the top thirty. 
 
 Season 10 aired from March 27–May 22, 2018. On March 30, an eleventh season was ordered. 
 
 However, on May 29, 2018, the show was cancelled by ABC after Barr tweeted a message about [[Valerie Jarrett]] (an aide to President [[Barack Obama]]) that was viewed as racist. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/06/03/after-roseannes-racist-tweet-obama-ally-valerie-jarrett-seizes-political-opportunity.html|title=After Roseanne's racist tweet, Obama ally Valerie Jarrett starts wooing voters|last=Calicchio|first=Dom|date=2018-06-03|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}} < /ref >   Barr wrote: < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/roseanne-barr-valerie-jarrett-muslim-brotherhood-planet-apes/|title=Roseanne Attacks Ex-Obama Aide Valerie Jarrett With Racially Charged Joke|date=2018-05-29|work=TheWrap|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}} < /ref >
