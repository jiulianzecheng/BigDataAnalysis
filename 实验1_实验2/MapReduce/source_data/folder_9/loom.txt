A '''loom''' is a [[machine]] for [[weaving]] thread or [[yarn]] into [[textiles]]. Looms can range from very small hand-held frames, to large free-standing hand looms, to huge automatic mechanical devices. 
 
 The invention of the [[power loom]] by [[Edmund Cartwright]] was very important in the [[Industrial Revolution]].
