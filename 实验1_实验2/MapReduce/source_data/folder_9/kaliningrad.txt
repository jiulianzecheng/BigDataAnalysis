 '''Kaliningrad''' ({{lang-ru|Калинингра́д}}; {{lang-lt|Karaliaučius}}; [[German language|German]]: {{Audio|De-Königsberg.ogg|'''Königsberg'''}}; {{lang-pl|Królewiec}}; briefly Russified as {{lang-ru|Кёнигсберг}} ''Kyonigsberg'') is a [[seaport]] and the administrative center of [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], the [[Russia]]n [[exclave]] between [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] on the [[Baltic Sea]]. Kaliningrad is the second-largest city in the Northwestern Federal District, after Saint Petersburg, the third-largest city in the Baltic region and the seventh-largest city on the Baltic Sea. It is the westernmost Oblast of Russia. 
 
 It is surrounded by [[NATO]] and [[European Union]] members Poland and Lithuania and is geographically separated from the main part of Russia itself. Borderless connection is only possible by sea or air. 
 
 In 2002, it had a population of 430,003 people. This was more than in 1989, when the last census was done. At that time, the city only had a population of 401,280. About 78% of the people there are [[Russia]]ns, 8% [[Belarus]]ians, and 7.3% [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]s. < ref > [http://www.russia-ic.com/regions/1649/ Kaliningrad Oblast] < /ref > 
 
 Until [[World War II]] the people were mostly [[Germans]]. Many fled during the war, and the rest were expelled between 1946 and 1949. 
 
 It was named '''Königsberg''' originally. The city had that name from [[1254]] to [[1945]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 It was the capital city of the German province of [[East Prussia]], the earlier [[Duchy of Prussia]], and before that of the Monastic State of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. 
 
 The [[Albertina University]] opened in 1544. < ref > Maria Olerud. https://www.aftenposten.no/historie/i/v5jKpB/stedet-har-en-helt-spesiell-historie-naa-gjoer-byen-baade-russland-og-na. [[Aftenposten]]. Retrieved 15 April 2022 < /ref >
