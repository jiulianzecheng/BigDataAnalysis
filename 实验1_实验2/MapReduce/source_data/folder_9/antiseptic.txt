 An '''antiseptic''' is a substance that is applied to lesions or [[wound]]s of the skin to kill [[Pathogen|germs]]. This helps prevent the wound becoming [[infection|infected]]. 
 
 Commonly used antiseptics include [[alcohol]], [[iodine]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[Chemical compound|compound]]s. Antiseptics are different from [[antibiotics]]. Antiseptics can only be used on the skin, antibiotics can also be used internally, through the [[blood]] and [[lymphatic system]]s. They are also different from [[disinfectant]]s: Disinfectants are used on non-living objects only, because they are dangerous to the living.
