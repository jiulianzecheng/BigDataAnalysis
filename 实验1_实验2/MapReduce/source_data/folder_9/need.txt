 A '''need''' is a thing that, when a living being, plant or animal does not have it, it is not able to live. 
 A thing that someone wants to have, but is able to live when they do not have it, is called a [[want]]. 
 
 Every person has the same basic needs for the [[body]]. 
 [[Human]]s have bodily needs of [[water]], [[food]], [[clothing]], and [[shelter]] to live. 
 The need for [[water]] is the most important because a person will die very quickly when they do not have drinking water. In a warm place food is the next most important need. 
 In a cold place, the need for clothes or shelter may be next most important because a person will soon die when they do not have these.  
 
 Other human needs are not so certain. They are mostly needs for the mind. It is often said that a person needs [[love]], [[family]], and [[friends]]. These needs are for personal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. They may also be [[want]]s. It is true that a [[life]] may be better with these things, but some friends can be bad, or bad sometimes. Good relationships can make life very happy. Thinking about a need that is not possible can make a person very unhappy. 
 
 Some of the [[Research|study]] of [[philosophy]] is about [[question]]s like  " What are the needs of a [[human]]? " 
 
 Some [[scientist]]s study the needs of human or animal minds and bodies. The study of the mind is called [[psychology]] - ''words about the mind''. The study of bodily needs is part of [[medicine]].
