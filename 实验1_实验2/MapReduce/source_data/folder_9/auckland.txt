Now [[Wellington]] is the capital city. 
 
 Auckland is in the north of the [[North Island]]. It is  on two [[harbour]]s: the Manukau and Waitemata harbours. It is known as the  " City of Sails "  because there are many sailing boats in the city. The Hauraki Gulf has many different islands and provides safe anchorage and good sailing that is recognised around the world. It has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). 
 
 Auckland is built on a series of [[dormant volcano]]s. The youngest and largest of these is called Rangitoto. Rangitoto is an island just a few kilometres from the city centre. It has many [[pohutukawa]]s, native trees also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because of their brilliant red flowers which bloom in December. 
 
 In 2010, [[Len Brown]] became the 1st Mayor of Auckland. In 2016, he was replaced by [[Phil Goff]].
