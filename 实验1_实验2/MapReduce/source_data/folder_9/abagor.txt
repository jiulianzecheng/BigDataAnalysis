'''Abagor''' (Russian: Абаго́р) is a seldom-used male first name in [[Russian language|Russia]], with its colloquial form being Bagor (Баго́р). It was commonly found in various handwritten church calendars from the 17th to 19th centuries but was later excluded from the official Synodal Menologium in the late 19th century. The name is thought to have originated from Biblical Hebrew, where it meant  " father of Gor. "  If used as a first name, the derived patronymics for males and females are  " Abagorovich "  and  " Abagorovna, "  respectively.
