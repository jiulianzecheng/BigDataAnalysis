 '''Commuting''' is the act of travelling from home to a workplace every day. A '''commuter''' is a person who '''commutes'''. This was uncommon until the 19th century, when the word was invented for people who used [[public transport]] daily. For many commuters, home is a [[suburb]] and work is in the inner city; but the reverse is sometimes the case and is called a reverse commute. Commuters may use other transport, such as [[car]]s or [[bicycle]]s.
