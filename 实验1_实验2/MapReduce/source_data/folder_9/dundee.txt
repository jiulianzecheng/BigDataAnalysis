 '''Dundee''' is a [[city]] on the east coast of [[Scotland]] where the [[River Tay]] flows into the [[North Sea]]. It is the fourth largest city in Scotland.  It was famous as the city of  " [[Jute]], [[jam]], and [[journalism]] " , because jute and jam were made there, and several newspapers were printed in the city. 
 
 Dundee has a population of 148,260 people. It is the fourth largest city in Scotland. 
 
 There are two universities in Dundee. They are called the ''University of Dundee'' and the ''University of Abertay Dundee''. 
 
 It also is home to two professional [[Association football|football]] teams. [[Dundee F.C.]] and [[Dundee United F.C.]], who both play in the [[Scottish Premier League]].
