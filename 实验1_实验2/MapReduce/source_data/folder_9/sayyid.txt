 '''Syed''' or '''Sayyid''' or '''Sayed''' is a title of honour and respect in [[Islam]]. It is originally a word from the [[Arabic language]] which means 'Sir' or 'Mister' or 'Honourable Person'.  
 
 However, the word is now also used in different parts of the world by [[Muslims]] to refer specially to a '''descendant''' of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]. For example, if someone is called a 'Syed/Sayyid' in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] etc., then that person is descended from the prophet of [[Islam]].
