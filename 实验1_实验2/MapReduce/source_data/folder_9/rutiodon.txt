 '''Rutiodon''' was a type of phytosaur. Phytosaurs were crocodile-like animals that lived during the time of dinosaurs. Its nostrils were far back on the head, close to the eyes. It was shown in the [[movie]] ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'' trying to catch a [[Coelophysis]]. It jumped out of the [[water]]. and [[roar]]ed without [[warn]]ing.
