 The '''Lycaenidae'''  are the second-largest [[family (biology)|family]] of [[butterfly|butterflies]], with about 6000 species worldwide. < ref > Fiedler, K. 1996. Host-plant relationships of lycaenid butterflies: large-scale patterns, interactions with plant chemistry, and mutualism with ants. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 80(1):259-267 doi:10.1007/BF00194770 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/rmrv30142015l422/]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  They are also called '''gossamer-winged butterflies'''. 
 
 The family includes many beautiful species. Some, like the [[Palos Verdes blue]], are critically endangered. The Lycaenids were favourites of the [[Russians|Russian]] [[novelist]] and lepidopterist [[Vladimir Nabokov]].
