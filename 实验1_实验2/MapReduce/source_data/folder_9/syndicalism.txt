 '''Syndicalism''', a socio-political movement that originated in [[France]] during the late 19th century, aims to transfer the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution to workers' unions. This influential movement, strongly influenced by the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and the French social philosopher [[Georges Sorel]], < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1522/cla.sif.sog.mat1|title=mat√©rialisme historique|last=Sorel|first=Georges|last2=Sorel|first2=Georges|date=2003|publisher=J.-M.

Syndicalism found support not only in France but also in countries like [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]], where workers were also fighting for their rights. It brought together [[Trades union|trade unions]], which became the driving force behind the movement, and advocated for worker control and self-management. Syndicalism represented a radical departure from traditional labor movements, emphasizing direct action and the overthrow of existing capitalist systems that exploited workers. It sought to create a society where workers held the power and decisions were made collectively within their unions, envisioning a more equitable and just future for the working class.
