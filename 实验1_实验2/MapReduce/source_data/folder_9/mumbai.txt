 ==History== 
 The [[Seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]] that form Bombay were home to fishing colonies. The islands were ruled by successive kingdoms and indigenous empires before Portuguese settlers took it. Then, it went to the [[British East India Company]]. During the mid-18th century, Bombay became a major trading town. It became a strong place for the [[Indian independence movement]] during the early 20th century. When India became independent in 1947, the city was put into [[Bombay State]]. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state of [[Maharashtra]] was created with Bombay as the capital. It was renamed Mumbai in 1996. < ref > {{cite web
