 '''''Glossopteris'''''  < ref > [[Greek language|Greek]] ''glossa'' (γλώσσα), meaning  " tongue " , because the leaves were tongue-shaped < /ref >  is the largest and best-known [[genus]] of the [[Extinction|extinct]] [[seed fern]]s. They were typical plants of the [[coal forest]]s or [[coal swamp]]s which lasted from the [[Pennsylvanian]] (later [[Carboniferous]]) to the end of the [[Permian]]. 
 
 The coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in [[Gondwana]]. Therefore they had similar wet, [[tropical climate]]s. 
 
 ==History== 
 The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the [[Permian]] (~300 million years ago). Their distribution across several [[continent]]s led [[Eduard Suess]] to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single [[supercontinent]] – [[Gondwana]]. < ref >  McLoughlin S. 2012. Glossopteris – insights into the architecture and relationships of an iconic Permian Gondwanan plant. ''Journal of the Botanical Society of Bengal''. '''65'''(2), 1–14. < /ref >   
 
 These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).  
 
 The only convincing [[Triassic]] records are very earliest Triassic leaves from [[Nidpur]], [[India]]. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic [[strata]] at Nidpur.  
 
 Some textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the [[Jurassic]]. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of ''Gontriglossa'', ''Sagenopteris'', or ''Mexiglossa''.  
 
 Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the [[Permian/Triassic extinction event|end-Permian mass-extinction event]]. < ref > McLoughlin S; Lindström S.  &  Drinnan A.N. 1997.
