A '''chordophone''' is any [[musical instrument]] which produces sound commonly by vibrating a [[string]] or strings stretched between two points. 
 
 What most [[Western Hemisphere|westerners]] would call string instruments are classified as chordophones (for example, [[violin]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[harp]]s).
