 '''Nectar''', in [[botany]], is a [[liquid]] made by the [[flower]]s of [[plants]]. It is [[Sweet (taste)|sweet]] because it has [[sugar]] in it. Plants make nectar to attract [[pollination|pollinating]] [[animal]]s. It is made in [[gland]]s called nectaries. The nectaries are usually at the bottom of the [[perianth]] of the flower. < ref > Rudall, Paula J. 2007. Anatomy of flowering plants: an introduction to structure and development (3rd ed.) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 9780521692458. 
 < /ref >  This means the animal trying to get the nectar has to touch the parts of the plant that are used for [[Sexual reproduction|reproduction]]. By doing this, the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce. 
 
 Some plants make nectar outside the flower. These plants do it to attract [[predator]]y [[insect]]s. These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects found near the plant. 
 
 Nectar is [[economy|economically]] important because it is where the sugar for [[honey]] comes from. It is also useful in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] because the [[adult]]s of many predatory insects, as well as [[hummingbird]]s, eat nectar. Some plants give off very rich [[scent]]s. 
 
 == Extrafloral nectaries == 
 Extrafloral nectaries  (not in the flower) are specialised nectar-secreting plant glands. They develop outside flowers, and are not involved in [[pollination]]. < ref name= " Heil " > {{Cite journal | last1 = Heil | first1 = M.| last2 = Fiala | first2 = B.| last3 = Baumann | first3 = B. | last4 = Linsenmair | first4 = K.E. | title = Temporal, spatial and biotic variations in extrafloral nectar secretion by ''Macaranga tanarius'' | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2435.2000.00480.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 749 | year = 2000 | doi-access = free }} < /ref > 
 
 In contrast to floral nectaries, nectar produced outside the flower generally has a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any [[herbivore|plant-eating]] insects around, they work as 'bodyguards'. < ref > [http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521819415 Plant-provided food for carnivorous insects â€“ Cambridge University Press < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > 
 
 Extrafloral nectaries have been reported in over 3941 species of [[vascular plant]]s belonging to 745 [[genus|genera]] and 108 [[family (biology)|families]], 99.7% of which belong to [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms). This is 1.0 to 1.8% of all known species. They are most common among [[eudicot]]s, occurring in 3642 species (of 654 genera and 89 families). They often occur in [[rosids]].
