 '''Telecadena''' is a Honduran open television channel. It is owned by the Televicentro Corporation. Its name is due to the two frequencies that the channel occupies to transmit at the national level, channel 7 VHF from Tegucigalpa and channel 4 VHF from San Pedro Sula. 
 
 Its programming is of a general nature, with children's series broadcast in the mornings and programs for an adult audience in the afternoons. 
 
 == History == 
 The channel is launched in 1985 by Rafael Ferrari. In February 1988, the station's first news program, ''Abriendo Brecha'' at 5:30 pm, was launched, directed and presented by Rodrigo Wong Arévalo. 
 
 Since the 2000s, the channel has aired the soap opera block La telenovela del recuerdo, inspired by [[Rede Globo]]'s Vale a pena ver de novo block. On December 1, 2014, the block is canceled to premiere new programs. 
 
 Among other entertainment programs, it also broadcasts Honduran shows such as: Los del Cuarto, a night show broadcast on Sundays from 8pm to 9:30pm on Telecadena de Televicentro; alongside 2 great drivers: Samuel Martínez and Elmer Valladares. This program will stop broadcasting in 2020 and is currently moving on Canal 5.
