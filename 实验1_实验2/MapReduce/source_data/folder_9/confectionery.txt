 '''Confectionery''' or '''sweets''' is a type of [[food]] that has a lot of [[sugar]] in it and is very sweet. It often includes things that are rich in [[artificial sweetener]]s, flavours and colourings. The words '''[[candy]]''' (North America), '''sweets''' (UK and Ireland) and '''lollies''' (Australia and New Zealand) are also used for the many kinds of confections. Confections are usually low in [[Nutrition|nutrients]] but rich in [[calorie]]s. Sweets can come from anywhere.
