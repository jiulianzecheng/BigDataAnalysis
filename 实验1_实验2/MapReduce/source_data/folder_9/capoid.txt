'''Capoid race''' was a [[word]] for the [[Khoisan|Khoikhoi and San peoples]]. American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Carleton S. Coon invented the word in 1962. The words means  " looking like a person from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] " . < ref > ''The Origin of Races'' (1962). 
 Moore, Ruth ''Evolution'' (Life Nature Library) New York:1962 Time, Inc. Chapter 8:  " The Emergence of Modern ''Homo sapiens'' "  Page 173--First page of picture section  " Man and His Genes " : The ''Capoid'' race is identified as one of the five major races of mankind, along with the ''Mongoloid'', ''Congoid'', ''Caucasoid'', and ''Australoid'' races < /ref >  Coon divided [[human beings]] into five [[Historical definitions of race|races]]. He called these races ''Capoid'', ''Congoid'', ''[[Mongoloid]]'', ''[[Australoid]]'', and ''[[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]]''. Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern [[Genetics|genetic]] research has shown that the idea of five races was wrong. < ref > {{cite web|author=American Association of Physical Anthropologists|title=AAPA Statement on Race and Racism |website=American Association of Physical Anthropologists|access-date=19 June 2020 |date=27 March 2019 |url=https://physanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/}} < /ref > < ref name= " Templeton2016 " > Templeton, A.
