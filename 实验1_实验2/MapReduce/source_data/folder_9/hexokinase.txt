 A '''hexokinase''' is an [[enzyme]] that phosphorylates (adds phosphyryl groups) hexoses (six-carbon [[sugar|sugars]]). It takes in a substrate (usually [[glucose]] in most organisms) and adds a phosphate (usually from [[ATP]]) to form hexose phosphate as the product. When the substrate is glucose, the product is glucose-6-phosphate.
