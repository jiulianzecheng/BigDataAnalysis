 '''Melting''' is the process of changing something from a [[solid]] into a [[liquid]] (like metal into liquid metal). It is the opposite of [[freezing]]. The temperature at which something begins to melt is called its [[melting point]]. When an object is heated, the object's particles begin to move faster and faster until the structured particles are freed. Now it is a liquid. It is a solid that is turning into a liquid. Ice takes longer to melt it is in cold water, because the water is near the melting point. It melts more quickly in warm water, far from the melting point.
