 The '''Galli''' (singular: '''Gallus''') were [[eunuch]] priests of the goddess [[Cybele]] or [[Agdistis]]. They were [[temple]] attendants sometimes wandering the streets begging for [[Charity (practice)|charity]], and in return they told people's [[Fortune-telling|fortunes]]. The Galli wore feminine clothing and grew their hair long, wearing earrings, necklaces, and heavy make-up. At festivals to Cybele and [[Attis]] they danced around wildly to loud music and whipped themselves until they bled. The newcomers to the priesthood would voluntarily castrate themselves.  
 
 ==Archigallus== 
 In [[Rome]], the head of the galli was known as the Archigallus. A number of archaeological finds depict the Archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The Archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by Rome's college of priests, and the term of service lasted for life. Along with the institution of the Archigallus came the [[Phrygia]]num [[sanctuary]] and the [[rite]] of the [[taurobolium]], two aspects of the [[Cybele|Cybele cult]] which the Archigallus had responsibility, as well as presiding over the Galli priests.
