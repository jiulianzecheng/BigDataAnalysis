 The same research suggests it was larger than ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', but more clumsy on land, moving as a [[quadruped]]. All these ideas had been suggested before, but the discovery of a more complete [[skeleton]] made palaeontologists think they were correct. The [[fossil]] was found in [[Morocco]] by a private collector who let scientists examine it. < ref > Chang, Kenneth 2014. A lost-and-found nomad helps solve the mystery of a swimming dinosaur.

 ''Spinosaurus'' bones were first discovered in [[Egypt]] in 1912 by German [[paleontologist]] Ernst Stromer in 1915. Two species, ''S. aegyptiacus'' and ''S. marocannus'', are recognized, but there may only be one. ''Spinosaurus'' looked like ''[[Baryonyx]],'' except it was larger and more heavily built. Six specimens of ''Spinosaurus'' have been uncovered. The first fossils were destroyed in [[Munich]], during [[World War II]], in a 1944 [[bombing]] raid by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. < ref name=swim/ > 
 
 A note on classification: The material also supports the [[monophyly]] of the Spinosaurinae and the separation of ''Spinosaurus'' and ''[[Irritator]]''. 
 
 == Description == 
 [[File:Спинозавр - новая реконструкция.jpg|thumb|250px|Restoration of ''Spinosaurus'']] 
 100 million years ago, the [[Sahara Desert]] was wet.  Animals included the [[pterosaur]] ''[[Alanqa]]'', types of giant crocodiles, and [[theropod]] predators the size of ''[[T. rex]]''.  The largest predator was ''Spinosaurus''.  In the past, it was thought that ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'' was bipedal. By 2014, scientists believed that ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'' was quadrupedal because it is front-heavy. If ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'' were to walk on two legs, it would topple.  Scientists believe that ''Spinosaurus'' probably walked on its knuckles.  Spinosaurus's legs were short, and its jaws were good at catching slippery prey, like [[fish]]. ''Spinosaurus'' spent most of its time in the water and it was a semi-aquatic dinosaur.   
 
 ''Spinosaurus'' was larger than ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Estimates published in 2005, 2007, and 2008 suggested that it was between 15 metres (50 ft) in length and 7 to 20.9 tonnes (7.7 to 23.0 short tons) in weight. A new estimate published in 2014 and based on a more complete specimen, supported the earlier research, finding that ''Spinosaurus'' could reach lengths of over 15 m (49 ft). It had a two meter high sail on its back like ''[[Dimetrodon]]''. Several uses have been suggested for this sail, such as to help control its body [[temperature]], as a way to attract a mate, and to intimidate or frighten enemies. It lived in what is now the [[Sahara Desert]], but which then was [[mangrove]] forests alongside shoreline conditions, tidal flats and channels.  
 
 The [[skull]] of ''Spinosaurus'' was long and narrow like that of a modern [[gharial]]. ''Spinosaurus'' is known to have eaten fish. Evidence suggests that it lived both on land and in water like a modern crocodilian. 
 
 == Media == 
 It was featured as the main dinosaur in the 2001 film [[Jurassic Park III]] where it fights and kills a T-Rex.  It has also appeared on postage stamps in several countries, and many toy companies have made models of ''Spinosaurus''.
