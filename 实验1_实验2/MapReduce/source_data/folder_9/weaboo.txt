 A '''weaboo''' (often shortened to '''weeb''') is a Japanophile-like person that is mostly obsessed with [[manga]] and [[anime]], sometimes superiorizing it over other cultures. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Who Are 'Weeaboos' and What Does 'Weeb' Mean?|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywgxey/we-asked-j-culture-fans-to-defend-being-weeaboos|access-date=2021-07-28|website=www.vice.com|language=en}} < /ref >  The terms have been thought to be from the webcomic ''The Perry Bible Fellowship.'' The shortened term has also seen increased usage on the Internet in recent years. The terms, while originally derogatory, have also been reclaimed by those to whom they originally referred, seeing increased usage by fans of [[Japan]]ese media to refer to themselves in an ironic or self-deprecating fashion.
