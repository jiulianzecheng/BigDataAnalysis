 '''Euripides''' (c. 480 BCâ€“406 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writer from [[Classical Athens|Athens]] who wrote about 90 [[Play (theatre)|plays]]. Only 18 of his [[tragedy|tragedies]] have survived complete, more than all other surviving ancient Greek tragedies put together.  A nineteenth play, ''Rhesus'' is sometimes thought to be by Euripides, but not all classicists agree on this. 
 
 Euripides was the last of the three greatest [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers of tragedies, the others being [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]].
