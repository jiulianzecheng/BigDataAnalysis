'''Horsepower''' is a unit of power that is approximately how much work one [[horse]] can do. It is equal to 746 [[watt]]s.  The idea of horsepower was originated by [[James Watt]], who invented the [[steam engine]]. Because people used horses to pull carts, it was an amount of energy that could be understood by most people at that time.  A human can only maintain about {{convert|0.1|hp|W|abbr=off}}, but an engine can maintain much higher than that. Small motors can create {{convert|10|hp|abbr=off}} while a [[jet engine]] can create more than {{convert|1,000|hp|abbr=off}}.
