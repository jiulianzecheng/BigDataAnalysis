 Rather more widely, it is any custom or [[tradition]] that distinguishes one group of people from another. Shibboleths have been used throughout history in many societies as [[password]]s. They are simple ways of self-identification: they signal loyalty and affinity. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 The term comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''shibbólet'' ({{Hebrew|שִׁבֹּלֶת}}), which means the part of a plant containing [[grain]], such as the head of a stalk of [[wheat]] or [[rye]]. < ref > Wahrig Deutsches Wörterbuch sixth edition, and {{cite web |work=Meyers Lexikon online |title=Schibboleth |url=http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Schibboleth |access-date=2020-09-08 |archive-date=2009-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429051715/http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Schibboleth |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|work=American Heritage Dictionary, also sometimes rye, fourth edition |title=shibboleth |url=http://www.tfd.com/shibboleth}} {{cite web|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary |title=shibboleth |url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/shibboleth}} The context was the crossing of the River Jordan; according to E.A. Speiser, op. cit., 10, the medieval Hebrew commentators and most modern scholars have understood it in this alternative sense. < /ref >   
 
 The modern use comes from an account in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. How this word was pronounced was used to distinguish friend from foe. In the [[Book of Judges]], chapter 12, the inhabitants of [[Gilead]] inflicted a military defeat on the invading [[tribe of Ephraim]] (around 1370–1070 BC). The surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the [[Jordan River|River Jordan]] to their home territory, but the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them.   
 
 To identify and kill the Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word ''shibboleth'' (with [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]]). The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like ''sibboleth''. < ref name= " HessBlock2016 " > {{cite book|author1=Richard Hess|author2=Daniel I.

 {{quote|And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; < br / > Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.|source=''Judges 12:5–6 KJV''}} 
 
 The concept of a shibboleth is still with us. It is any word, [[phrase]], [[jargon]] or [[pronunciation]] which identifies a person as a member of a particular group.
