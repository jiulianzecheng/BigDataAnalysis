 The '''silvereye''' or '''wax-eye''' (''Zosterops lateralis'') is a very small omnivorous [[passerine]] bird of the south-west Pacific. In Australia and New Zealand its [[common name]] is sometimes '''white-eye''', but this name is more commonly used to talk about all members of the genus ''[[Zosterops]]'', or the entire family [[Zosteropidae]]. 
 
 In New Zealand, the silvereye was first recorded in 1832. It many more were seen in 1856, and it is assumed that a migrating flock was thrown eastwards by a storm. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/silvereye/1|title=Silvereye|publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|encyclopedia=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=2012-09-06}} < /ref >  As a self-introduced bird it is protected as a native New Zealand species. Its [[Māori language|Māori]] name, {{lang|mi|tauhou}}, means  " stranger "  or more literally,  " new arrival " .
