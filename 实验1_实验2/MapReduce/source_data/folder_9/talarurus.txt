 '''''Talarurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|l|ə|ˈ|r|ʊər|ə|s}} {{respell|TAL|ə|ROOR|əs}}; meaning  " Wicker tail " ) is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaur]] [[dinosaur]]. It lived about 90 million years ago during the [[Upper Cretaceous]]  in what is now [[Mongolia]].  
 
 ''Talarurus'' was a [[hippopotamus]]-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, [[quadrupedal]] [[herbivore]]. It could grow up to about {{Convert|6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long. Like other ankylosaurs it had heavy [[armour]] and a [[club]] on its tail. ''Talarurus'' is one of the oldest known ankylosaurines from Asia and one of the better-known ankylosaurs from Mongolia. < ref > Park J.Y; Lee Y.N; Currie P.J; Kobayashi Y; Koppelhus E; Barsbold R; Mateus O; Lee S.  &  Kim S.H. 2019.
