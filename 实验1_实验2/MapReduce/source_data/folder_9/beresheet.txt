 '''''Beresheet''''' was a demonstrator of a small robotic [[lunar lander]] and lunar probe. It was privately funded in [[Israel]] and was planned to land on the [[moon]]. The lander was known as ''Sparrow'', and was officially named ''Beresheet'' ({{lang-he-n|בְּרֵאשִׁית}},  " [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] " ) in December 2018. < ref > [http://www.spaceil.com/general/spaceil-iai-to-send-time-capsule-on-israels-historic-moon-mission/ SpaceIL, IAI to send time capsule on Israel's historic Moon mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330040247/http://www.spaceil.com/general/spaceil-iai-to-send-time-capsule-on-israels-historic-moon-mission/ |date=2019-03-30 }}.

 On 11 April 2019, the failure of an IMU unit caused a chain of events, leading to the shutoff of the main engine, which caused the lander to crash on the Moon. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-beresheet-spacecraft-crashes-during-moon-landing-attempt/|title=Israel’s Beresheet spacecraft crashes into the moon during landing attempt|first=Melanie|last=Lidman|website=www.timesofisrael.com}} < /ref >  On 13 April 2019, Beresheet-2 was announced.
