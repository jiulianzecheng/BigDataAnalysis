 The subphylum '''Hexapoda''', meaning  " six legs " , is the largest  group of [[arthropod]]s. It includes the [[insect]]s and three much smaller groups of arthropods without wings: [[Collembola]], [[Protura]], and [[Diplura]].  
 
 All of these were once called insects. It seems they are [[polyphyletic]], and evolved independently from each other. In other words, hexapoda is composed from the insects and the [[Entognatha]]. ''Hexapods'' are so called because they have a [[thorax]] with three pairs of [[leg]]s. Most other arthropods have more than three pairs of legs. 
 
 Alternatively, the Hexapoda could be eliminated because they are polyphyletic, the Insecta promoted to sub-phylum, and the minor groups become ''incertae sedis''. This is a [[Latin]] term meaning  " of uncertain placement "  and used for a taxonomic group when its broader relationships are unknown or undefined.
