 '''Prestel''' was the brand name for the [[United Kingdom]] [[Post Office]]'s [[Viewdata]] technology, It was an interactive [[videotex]] system developed during the late 1970s and commercially launched in 1979. It achieved a maximum of 90,000 subscribers in the UK and was eventually sold by [[BT Group|BT]] in 1994. 
 
 The technology was a forerunner of on-line services today. Instead of a [[computer]], a [[television]] set hooked to a dedicated terminal was used to receive information from a remote [[database]] via a [[telephone]] line. The service offered thousands of pages ranging from consumer information to financial data but with limited [[graphics]].
