 '''''Dimorphodon''''' was a [[prehistoric]] flying [[pterosaur]] from the early [[Jurassic]] period. It had a big head, a small brain, a tall beak, and two types of teeth. Variation in teeth is rare in pterosaurs.  
 
 Like ''[[Rhamphorhynchus]]'', ''Dimorphodon'' is only found in Jurassic [[strata]]. It was the first pterosaur found in [[England]], by [[Mary Anning]], in 1828. < ref > Buckland W. (1 January 1829). On the discovery of a new species of Pterodactyle in the Lias at Lyme Regis. ''Transactions of the Geological Society of London''. s2-3 (1): 217–222. < /ref > 
 
 Most of the known specimens were found in the Jurassic chalk of the south coast of England in the 19th century. Another species of ''Dimorphodon'' has been found in La Boca Formation in Tamaulipas, [[Mexico]], from the [[Lower Jurassic]]. < ref > Clark J.M.; Hopson J.A.; Hernández R., R.; Fastovsky D.E.; Montellano M. 1998.
