 A '''dementor''' is a man-size creature in the [[Harry Potter]] books. They are black and hooded. They only lift up their hood for performing ''the kiss'' in which they suck out the [[soul]]. There is one way to make them go away. It's the Patronus Charm. It's very advanced magic. You perform it by saying ''Expecto Patronum! '' and remembering a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] first saw them in the third book ''[[Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban|The prisoner of Azkaban]]''.
