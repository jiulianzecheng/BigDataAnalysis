'''Salford''' is a city in [[England]]. It was made a free borough by Ranulf, Earl of [[Chester]] in about [[1230s|1230]]. and was granted city status in 1926. Salford is unusual because it borders the city of [[Manchester]] at its center, rather than its outskirts. The two cities are divided by the River [[Irwell]]. 
 
 Salford shares the industrial history of its neighbour [[Manchester]]. It hosts several [[museum]]s and art centres, chiefly: [http://www.thelowry.com/ The Lowry] and the [[Imperial War Museum]], both on [[Salford Quays]].  There was a major cotton and silk spinning and [[weaving]] factory district in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It was an inland port on the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] from 1894.  Broadcasters moved to the [[Salford Quays]] development called [[MediaCityUK]]. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2007-05-31|title=BBC Salford move gets green light|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/6708383.stm|access-date=2023-03-27}} < /ref >
