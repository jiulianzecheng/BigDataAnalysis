[[File:816- Ivigtut - cryolite.jpg|thumb|Cryolite from Greenland]] 
 '''Cryolite''' is a rare mineral that consists of [[sodium fluoride]] and [[aluminium fluoride]] bonded. It is used in the production of [[aluminium]]. It is first melted and then [[aluminium oxide]] is dissolved in it. Then the [[solution]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]]. If it is immersed in water, it becomes invisible although it does not dissolve. It used to be found in large quantities in [[Greenland]], but it has been all used up. Now it is made from [[fluorite]] artificially.
