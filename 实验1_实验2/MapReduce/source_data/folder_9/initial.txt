In a written or published work, an '''initial''' or '''drop cap''' is a letter at the beginning of a word, a [[chapter (books)|chapter]], or a [[paragraph]] that is larger than the rest of the text. The word is comes from the [[Latin]] ''initialis'', which means ''standing at the beginning''.  An initial is often several lines in height and in older books or manuscripts. In some cases a name or title can be long so the initials would shorten them. 
 
 Examples include: [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]], [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez|AOC]], [[The Dark Knight (movie)|TDK]], [[New York City|NYC]], [[United States|USA]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|KUWTK]], [[European Union|EU]], etc.
