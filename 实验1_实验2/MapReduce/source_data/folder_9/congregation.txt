A '''congregation''' is a group of people who have come together ('''congregated''') for something, usually for [[religious]] [[worship]].  In [[Christian]] [[church]]es the word “congregation” is often used to mean all the people in the main part of the church, but not the [[choir]] or the [[priest]]s. This term came from long ago after the church was first formed. For example: the order of service might say that the choir will sing verse 1 of a [[hymn]] and  " the congregation are asked to join in at verse 2 " .
