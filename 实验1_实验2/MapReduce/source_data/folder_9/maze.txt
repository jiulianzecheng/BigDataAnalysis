 A '''maze''' is a [[puzzle]]. It is made of a [[wikt:complex|complex]] system of paths. Mazes can be on paper. They can also be big enough to walk through. [[Labyrinth]]s, which are similar, have one winding path instead of many paths like a maze. Sometimes balls are placed in small mazes which have to be moved to the end through the maze.
