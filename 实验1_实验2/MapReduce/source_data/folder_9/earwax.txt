 '''Earwax''' is a sticky yellow or grey substance like [[wax]] produced by the ears. The earwax sticks to [[dust]] that gets in the ears to keep them clean. It also protects the skin of ear and protects ear from [[insects]], water, [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. Some [[Human|people]] try to remove earwax, which may damage the eardrum. The movement of jaws helps to clean the earwax naturally.
