 '''Arles''' is a city in the south of [[France]]. It was built in the 6th century BC by the Greeks. Today more than 50,000 people live there. In the [[1880s]], the famous painters, [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] lived there. [[Vincent van Gogh]] painted his famous Sunflowers in Arles. 
 
 The city is at the heart of the [[Camargue]]. Not many people live in this region, so there is a lot of free land around Arles. Because of this, Arles is the city in [[France]] to have the largest area (nearly 760 square kilometres).
