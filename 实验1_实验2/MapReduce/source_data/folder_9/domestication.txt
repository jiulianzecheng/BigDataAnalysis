 '''Domestication''' is a change that happens in wild [[animals]] or [[plants]], when they are kept by humans for a long time. The [[Latin]] term literally means  " to make it suitable for home " . 
 
 If humans take wild animals and plants and keep and [[breed]] them, over time the animals and plants may change. The animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them, and they change in ways that are better for human use. This change (domestication) happens by humans choosing which animals will breed the next generation. Biologists call this method [[artificial selection]]. 
 
 The first domestication of plants happened during the first use of [[agriculture]]. Humans first domesticated [[dog]]s. In the [[Neolithic revolution]], people domesticated [[sheep]] and [[Domestic goat|goat]]s, and later [[cattle]] and [[pig]]s. 
 
 Domesticated plants are [[crop]]s or [[ornamental plant]]s. People use domesticated animals as [[livestock]], that is for food, clothing, and work. Otherwise, the domesticated animals may be kept as [[pet]]s. 
 
 == Domesticated plants == 
 The first evidence of plant domestication comes from [[wheat]] found in pre-Pottery [[Neolithic]] villages in Southwest Asia. They are dated at 10,500 to 10,100 BC. < ref name=OX > Zohary, Daniel Hopf, Maria Weiss, Ehud 2012. ''Domestication''. Oxford University Press. < /ref >  The [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]], and [[India]] were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants. < ref > Root, Clive 2007. ''Domestication of plants in the Old World''. Greenwood. < /ref > 
 
 Agriculture developed independently in a number of places at different times. < ref name=OX/ >  The eight Neolithic founder crops ([[emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], [[barley]], [[peas]], [[lentil]]s, [[bitter vetch]], [[chickpea]]s and [[flax]]) had all appeared by about 7000 BC. < ref > Colledge, Sue  &  Conolly, James 2007.

 == Domesticated animals == 
 === Origin of the dog === 
 The origin of the domestic [[dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') began with the domestication of the [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') several tens of thousands of years ago. < ref name= " DienekesAnthropology " > [http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/10/dog-domestication-in-aurignacian-c.html Dienekes' Anthropology Blog : Dog domestication in the Aurignacian (c. 32kyBP]) < /ref > < ref name= " Worldfirst " > [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370/ MSNBC : World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big] < /ref > < ref name= " Scott " > Scott, John Paul  &  Fuller, John L. 1974. ''Dog behavior: the genetic basis''. 2nd ed, University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|9780226743387}}. {{ISBN|0-226-74338-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-74338-7}}. p54] < /ref >  Domesticated dogs provided early humans with a guard animal, a source of food, fur, and a working animal (hunting, pulling sleds). The process continues to this day. 
 
 [[Archaeology]] has placed the earliest known domestication at possibly 30,000 BC, < ref name= " DienekesAnthropology "  / > < ref name= " Worldfirst "  / >  and with certainty at 7,000 BC. < ref name= " Scott "  / >  Other evidence suggests that dogs were first domesticated in [[East Asia]]. < ref name=Savolainen_et_al_2002 > {{cite journal | first = Peter | display-authors = etal| last =  Savolainen | date = 2002-11-22 | title = Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of domestic dogs | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1610–3 | doi = 10.1126/science.1073906 | bibcode = 2002Sci...298.1610S | pmid = 12446907| s2cid = 32583311}} < /ref > 
 
 Perhaps the earliest clear cultural evidence for this domestication is the first dog found buried together with humans, 12,000 years ago in Palestine. < ref > James Serpell 1995.

Other animals that were domesticated early are [[camel]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[horse]]s. Some animals, like the [[domestic rabbit]], were only domesticated in recent times.

 === Self-domestication === 
 [[File:6 bonobos WHCalvin IMG 1341.jpg|thumb|Bonobos are less aggressive than chimpanzees]] 
 Self-domestication refers to an evolutionary process in which aggressive behavior is selected against, which makes a species less aggressive and more friendly and social. Bonobos, who share a common ancestor with chimpanzees, show far less aggression than chimpanzees. It is thought that bonobos have become 'self domesticated' due to female bonobos only reproducing with the more gentle males. This process may also apply to humans, who are very social compared to other species. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdFkDwAAQBAJ|title=The Goodness Paradox: How Evolution Made Us Both More and Less Violent|last=Wrangham|first=Richard|date=2019-01-17|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1-78283-221-8|pages=Preface|language=en}} < /ref >
