 '''Polo''' is a [[sport]]. It is played between two [[team]]s of 4 [[player]]s on [[horse]]s, which are called polo ponies. The players try to [[wikt:score|score]] [[wikt:goal|goals]] (points) by putting the [[ball]] in the goal. They use long mallets (long sticks).

 ==Origins== 
 According to Austro-Hungarian ethnographic researcher [[Charles de Ujfalvy]], Polo was originally invented in the country of [[Balti people|Baltis]] in [[Baltistan]] (modern-day [[Pakistan]]). The word ''Polo'' itself is a Balti word which means Ball in the [[Balti language]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Polo; Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?q=polo|access-date=5 December 2023|website=Oxford University Press}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=Sports and games of the 18th and 19th centuries|url=https://archive.org/details/sportsgamesof18t0000creg|last=Crego|first=Robert|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-31610-4|edition=1. publ|series=Sports and games through history|location=Westport, Conn.}} < /ref >   < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.indianpolo.com/manipurpolo/history.asp |title=Polo Portraits |access-date=2021-03-21 |archive-date=2019-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211023839/http://www.indianpolo.com/manipurpolo/history.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-02-11|title=Manipur Polo - Indianpolo.com, polo, polo in india|url=http://www.indianpolo.com/manipurpolo/history.asp|access-date=2022-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211023839/http://www.indianpolo.com/manipurpolo/history.asp |archive-date=2019-02-11 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Italian seal on Manipur polo origin - Milan-based writer to visit Imphal to collect material for book on game's history|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/italian-seal-on-manipur-polo-origin-milan-based-writer-to-visit-imphal-to-collect-material-for-book-on-game-s-history/cid/791135|access-date=2022-03-05|website=www.telegraphindia.com}} < /ref >  Various forms of Polo, and similar sports, have been long played, traditionally, throughout a wide range covering [[Assam]] and [[Manipur]] areas of [[India]], [[Kashmir]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]],  and the other valleys of [[Pakistan]] such as [[Gilgit]], [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], and [[Chitral District]] and parts of [[Central Asia]] as well. In ancient [[Persia]], ''Chavgan'', another form of Polo, was also played. It was only in the mid-19th century that colonial officers in [[British India]] began to play this sport and imported it to [[Britain]], where the formal [[Hurlingham Rules]] were then laid down. Later, in the 1890s, Polo was also introduced to the [[United States]]. 
 
 == The main rules of polo == 
 There are two teams both with 4 players. They play on a [[field]] which is 300 yards long (about 275 meters) and 160 or 200 yards wide (about 146 and 183 meters). There are goalposts (long sticks in the ground) 8 yards (7.32 meters) [[wikt:apart|apart]] at each end of the field. To score, the ball has to go between the other team's goalposts, which is called a [[wikt:goal|goal]]. 
 
 The game is 4, 6 or 8 periods (units of time) of 7 [[minute]]s, which are called ''chukkas''. Between chukkas, players change ponies. 
 
 In a game there are 2 [[umpire]]s on horses and a [[referee]] on the side. 
 
 Players are given a foul if they break the rules. These rules keep the horses and riders safe. One rule in polo is called the  " line of the ball "  or just the  " line " . The  " line "  is an invisible line between the ball and the player that has the ball. A player has the ball if they are the closest to make a play on the ball. The  " line "  is in the same direction as this player is traveling and extends as far as the player is able to safely stop their horse. If another player crosses the  " line "  (that is, if another player runs in front of the player who has the ball), they will receive a foul. This is a common foul because it is sometimes difficult for a player to tell where the invisible  " line "  is. 
 
 A common defensive play in polo is called  " hooking " . A player may hook an opponent by using their mallet to block an opponent's mallet while the opponent tries to hit the ball. Sometimes it is unsafe for a player to hook their opponent. As an example, reaching over or under the opponent's horse to make a hook is considered unsafe. An unsafe hook will cause the player to foul. If a player cannot safely hook their opponent, they may instead use a different defensive play called a  " ride-off " . A  " ride-off "  happens when a player uses their horse to push an opponent's horse away from the  " line " . This makes it difficult for the opponent to make a play on the ball. If the player crosses the line while trying to ride off their opponent, they will receive a foul. 
 
 If a player makes a foul, the opponent may get a penalty shot. Penalty shots are made near the goal and other players cannot block the penalty shot. 
 
 == Player positions == 
 Each player has certain [[wikt:responsibilities|responsibilities]]: 
 * Number One is the most [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] position on the field.  
 * Number Two is the most difficult position on the field to play. The number 2 has an important offensive [[role]] and a [[wikt:defensive|defensive]] role.  
 * Number Three is the tactical [[leader]]. He is defensive and offensive and is often the best player. 
 * Number Four is the most defensive player. He tries to stop the other team from [[score|scoring]] goals. 
 
 == Polo ponies == 
 
 The ponies are 14.2 to 16 hands (1 hand equals 4 [[inch]]es or 10.16 [[centimetre]]s). They weigh between 900 and 1100lbs-pounds- (about 408 and 499 kilos). Ponies can be ridden to play from the age of 5 up to 18 or even 20 years old sometimes. Polo ponies are not actually [[pony|ponies]] because they are full-sized horses. [[Thoroughbred]]s are a common horse [[breed]] to use as polo ponies because they are fast and agile. 
 
 == Equipment == 
 [[File:Polo 070922 40.jpg|thumb|Polo player wearing all the equipment]] 
 The players have a [[helmet]] (hard hat), riding [[boot]]s, white [[trousers]], a [[shirt]] with the player's number on. Sometimes players also have one or two [[glove]]s, knee-pads and a [[whip]]. 
 
 The ball is made of [[plastic]]. Before, it was made of [[wood]]. The ball is about 3Â¼ inches (8.3 centimetres) in [[diameter]] and [[wikt:weigh|weighs]] about four [[ounce]]s (113.4 grams). 
 
 Polo [[saddle]]s are English-style, similar to jumping saddles. 
 
 Polo mallets are used to hit the ball. Their shape is similar to normal [[Hammer|mallets]], but they are much longer. The shaft of the mallet is usually made of [[bamboo]] and the head is usually made of wood. Players hit the ball with the side of the mallet rather than the front. 
 
 == Other forms of polo == 
 Polo is not always played on ponies. [[Canoe]] polo, cycle polo, [[camel]] polo, [[elephant]] polo, [[golf cart]] polo, [[Segway]] polo, [[BMX]] polo, [[yak]] polo and [[water polo]] also exist. However most of these forms are not played at a [[professional]] level.
