 [[File:Exercices d'aérobic.jpg|thumb|Aerobics class]]'''Aerobics''' or '''rhythmic fitness''' is a physical [[exercise]] performed under a rhythmic [[music]]. It includes [[running]], [[jumping]], [[stretching]] and [[strength training]] routines. It may be practiced in a group setting led by an [[teacher|instructor]], although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment.  
 
 Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their [[physical fitness|fitness]] level. Many [[gym]]s offer a wide variety of aerobic classes for participants to take. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class. 
 
 [[Jogging]] and [[cycling]] similarly promote aerobic fitness, but they are not usually done in classes led by instructors or with music, hence are not  " aerobics " .
