 '''Bartje Bartels''' is the main character in a series of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] books written by Anne de Vries at the beginning of the [[20th century]].  The stories are about a boy who grows up in a poor family in the [[countryside]] in [[Drenthe]] in the north-east of the [[Netherlands]]. 
 
 The author Anne de Vries is male.  The name “Anne”, although usually a girl's name, can also be used as a boy’s name in Dutch, especially in the north where [[Frisian language|Frisian]] is spoken.  It is pronounced “Oa-ne”. 
 
 Bartje (pronounce: “BAR-che”) is a boy whose father is a poor [[farmer]].  His parents expect him to become a farmer like his father, but Bartje has other ideas.  Bartje starts work as an [[apprentice]], but then his mother dies and he has to look after his younger brothers and sisters. 
 
 ==Famous quotation== 
 The most famous quotation from the Bartje books come in the story in which the family are sitting down to a meal.  They are going to eat brown [[bean]]s.  Bartje hates brown beans and pulls his empty plate away when his mother wants to give him some.  He refuses to say [[grace (prayer)|grace]] (to say a [[prayer]] to thank [[God]] for the food they are about to eat) and he says: ''Ik bid nie veur bruune boon'n '' (in modern Dutch: ''Ik bid niet voor bruine bonen'', meaning: ''I don’t pray for brown beans'').  His parents are shocked and he gets into big trouble. 
 
 ==Television series== 
 
 Bartje has become a much-loved [[symbol]] for the province of [[Drenthe]].  The stories were made into a television series which was shown in [[1972]] and repeated in [[2004]].  The film had Dutch subtitles because the actors were speaking in Drenthe [[dialect]].   
 
 There is a statue to Bartje in the town of [[Assen]].  Unfortunately it has been vandalized several times.
