A '''bastard''' is a person who was born of [[parent]]s who are not [[marriage|married]] to one another. It is considered by some cultures and individuals as a nasty or [[insult]]ing word, or sometimes even [[profanity]], with the term '''illegitimate''' being a little more polite. Some [[culture]]s see illegitimate children as dirty or bad, and only accept [[sexual intercourse|sexual relations]] between [[marriage|married couples]].
