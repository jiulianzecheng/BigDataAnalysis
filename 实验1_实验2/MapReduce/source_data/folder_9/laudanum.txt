 '''Laudanum''' is the name of a [[tincture]] containing [[opium]]. A tincture is usually an extract of plant or animal material dissolved in [[ethanol]] (ethyl alcohol). Laudanum is dissolved extracts from the [[opium poppy]] (''Papaver somniferum'' Linnaeus) in alcohol (ethanol). 
 
 [[Paracelsus]] thought that it was good for treating almost anything. According to Paracelus, laudanum consists of about 9 parts [[wine]], and one part opium. Other ingredients, such as [[henbane]], [[mandrake]] and [[deadly nightshade]] were commonly added. Since its discovery in the 16th century, laudanum was often used to treat different diseases. Its popularity and use is comparable to the modern drug [[aspirin]]. Its main effect was that of the opium: it was a [[painkiller]], and a [[sedative]].  
 
 The main problem is that opium causes [[addiction]]. This was only understood in the 19th century. Towards the end of the 19th century, there were good alternative drugs. England banished [[opiates]] from open sale in the 1920s, and Germany regulated their use in 1929.  
 
 Laudanum, like other opiates was used as a painkiller, and a sedative. Until the 1970s it was used to treat clinical depression. Laudanum is dangerous to children as it is easy to get an overdose. Today, laudanum is still used to treat severe cases of [[diarrhea]] which sometimes occur with [[chemotherapy]].
