 '''Necromancy''' is a form of [[divination]] in which a person tries to summon the [[spirit]]s of the dead.  Necromancy is seen by [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s as  [[black magic]] and [[demon]]-summoning, as the [[Book of Leviticus]] 19:31 says: 'do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out and so make yourselves unclean.'
