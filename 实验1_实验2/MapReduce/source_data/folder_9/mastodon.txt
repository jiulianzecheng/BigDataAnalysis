 '''Mastodons''' or '''Mastodonts''' are [[elephant]]s of the extinct [[genus]] ''Mammut'' and the family Mammutidae. Mastodons became extinct about 11,000 years ago.  
 
 Mastodons, with [[mammoth]]s, modern elephants and various older families, are members of the order [[Proboscidea]]. As adults they stood between 2.5 and 3 meters (8-10 feet) at the shoulder and weighed between 3500 and 5400 kilograms (4-6 tons).  
 
 Mastodons were [[browser]]s on leaves and branches, as shown by their [[molar]] [[teeth]]. 
 
 == Two species == 
 ''M. americanum'' was the American mastodon, and ''M. pacificus'' was the Pacific mastodon. They are the youngest and best-known species of the genus. Mastodons disappeared from North America as part of a mass extinction of most of the Pleistocene megafauna. < ref > Dooley A.C; Scott E; Green J.; Springer K.B; Dooley B.S.  &  Smith G.J. 2019. ''Mammut pacificus'' sp. nov., a newly recognized species of mastodon from the Pleistocene of western North America. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30944777/] < /ref > 
 
 == Recent discovery == 
 Stone tools and bones from a butchered mastodon were found at the bottom of a river in [[Florida]]. After a four-year investigation, researchers decided that humans lived there and made a meal of a mastodon 14,550 years ago. < ref > Webb, Jonathan 2016. Mastodon meal scraps revise US prehistory.
