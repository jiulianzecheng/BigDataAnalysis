 '''Stockholm''' is the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Sweden]]. It is also the biggest [[city]] in Sweden. It is on the east coast of the [[country]]. The city is built on [[island]]s, with [[canal]]s and open [[water]] in the inner city. Stockholm is found between Sweden's third largest [[lake]], [[Mälaren]], and the [[Baltic Sea]]. 
 
 [[Tyresta National Park]] is near Stockholm. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Central Stockholm has four different parts - Kungsholmen, Södermalm, Norrmalm and Östermalm. Kungsholmen and Södermalm are islands, while Norrmalm and Östermalm are parts of the mainland. Also, there are several smaller islands in the inner city - Gamla Stan, Riddarholmen, Djurgården and Skeppsholmen. Since Stockholm has so many islands, it is sometimes referred to as the  " Venice of the North " . 
 
 Gamla Stan is the oldest part of the city - the name means  " Old Town " , and is usually called that in English. Djurgården is mostly a large park, but there are buildings on the island. Most of these are museums that commemorate Sweden's and Stockholm's past - like Skansen, a zoo with a Swedish theme. Skeppsholmen is an island that used to be a training ground and military school, but most of the buildings are now used for museums and art galleries, such as the Modern Museum, or the East Asian museum. Riddarholmen is a part of Gamla Stan, but actually a different island. 
 
 All of the islands in Stockholm are connected by several bridges. The biggest one is Västerbron, going from Kungsholmen to Södermalm. 
 
 == History == 
 
 [[Birger Jarl]] is considered the [[wikt:founder|founder]] of Stockholm. It is believed that he rebuilt a [[defense (military)|defense]] [[building]] in the [[13th century]] on what is today the island of the Old town. Around the [[fort]]ification, a town grew. The town grew mainly because of its sea and land [[trade|trading]]. 
 
 == Wikimania == 
 
 The last Wikimania conference is hosted in this city in 2019.
