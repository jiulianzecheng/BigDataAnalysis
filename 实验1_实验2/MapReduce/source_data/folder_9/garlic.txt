 '''Garlic''' (species '''Allium sativum''') is a type of [[plant]] that [[wikt:people|people]] eat for [[food]]. < ref name= " Oregon " > {{cite web|title=Garlic|date=28 April 2014 |publisher=Oregon State University|url=https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/garlic}} < /ref >  Garlic is related to [[onion]]s, [[shallot]]s, and [[leek]]s. It has a very strong [[flavor]] and [[odor|smell]]. Most of the time, people use it as a flavoring so that it helps make food [[taste]] better. 
 
 Garlic is used as [[herb]]al medicine in the treatment of cold and flu. < ref name= " NIH " > {{cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/garlic/ataglance.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health|title=Garlic}} < /ref >   It has side effects of [[heartburn]], [[flatulence]] and [[sweating]]. < ref name= " Oregon "  / > 
 
 The part of the garlic plant that people eat is called the head.  It grows at the bottom of a long green stalk.  People pull the head apart into smaller pieces called cloves of garlic.  Cloves have papery skin on them.  People peel off the skin before cooking the cloves. < ref name= " Almanac "  / > 
 
 People plant garlic in the [[fall]] right after the first frost.  They plant the [[clove]] like a [[seed]].  One clove can grow into a whole head.  The garlic plant grows its roots before the ground freezes for winter.  People [[harvest]] (collect) the garlic in the middle of the next summer. < ref name= " Almanac " > {{cite web|title=Growing garlic|url=https://www.almanac.com/plant/garlic|publisher=The Old Farmer's Almanac|accessdate=July 16, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 == Folklore == 
 Garlic is in legends about [[vampire]]s. In these legends, vampires do not like garlic. Garlic keeps vampires away. Writers for the [[Toronto Garlic Festival]] say this might be because the vampire legend comes from the disease [[porphyria]]. People with porphyria do not like to eat foods that have [[sulfur]] in them, like garlic. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://torontogarlicfestival.ca/vampires-hate-garlic/|publisher=Toronto Garlic Festival|accessdate=July 16, 2020|title=Why Vampires Hate Garlic}} < /ref >
