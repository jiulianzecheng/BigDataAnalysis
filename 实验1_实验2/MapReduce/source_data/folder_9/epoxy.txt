 It is also a common name for the [[epoxide]] functional group, and a common name for a type of strong [[adhesive]] used for sticking things together. < ref > [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/epoxy-resin Definition of epoxy resin], noun, from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary  &  Thesaurus, Cambridge University Press. < /ref >  Typically, two resins need to be mixed together before use.  
 
 Epoxy resins are a class of reactive [[polymer]]s which contain epoxide groups.  Their co-reactants are often called 'hardeners' or 'curatives', and the cross-linking reaction is referred to as 'curing'.  The reaction forms a [[thermosetting polymer]], often with strong mechanical properties as well as high temperature and chemical resistance.  Epoxy has a wide range of industrial applications. 
 
 *[[Superglue]] is another strong adhesive, made of [[cyanoacrylate]].
