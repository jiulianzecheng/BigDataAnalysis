'''Inheritance''' is the practice of passing on [[property]], [[nobility|title]]s, [[debt]]s, and duties when someone [[death|dies]]. Those things usually go to [[family]] members. People have had laws about inheritance for thousands of years. The question is often settled in a [[will (law)|will]]. 
 
 If only sons and other [[male]] family members get the inheritance, it is called [[kinship|patrilineal]] inheritence. If only daughters and other [[female]] family members get the inheritance, it is called [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] succession. In some cases inheritance depends on [[legitimacy]]. 
 
 Cultural inheritance is called [[legacy]]. [[Gene|Genetic]] inheritance is called [[heredity]]. A [[kingdom]] may be inherited, and the person who is expected to inherit is called the [[heir apparent]]. 
 
 The person who gets the property and other things when someone dies is called the heir (male) or heiress (female). 
 
 [[Inheritance tax|'''Inheritance tax''']] is a tax paid by a person who inherits money or property of someone who has died.
