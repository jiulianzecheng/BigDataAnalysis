'''Tajdid''' ({{lang-ar|تجديد}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that means  " [[wikt:renewal|renewal]] " . It is usually put together with ''din'' to mean  " renewal of the [[religion]]. "  A similar but less common expression is ''ihya' al-din'' ({{lang|ar|إحياء الدين}}), which may be translated as  " revival of the religion. " 
 
 The purpose of the tajdid (renewal or revival) is to implement this ideal model in Muslims' lives, wherever and whenever Muslim society exists. This purpose implies that tajdid is a continuous effort by Muslims always to explain [[Islam]] and make it applicable in continually changing situations without violating its [[5 pillars of islam|principles]].  
 
 The notion of tajdid in the Islamic tradition can be traced back to the Prophet [[Muhammad]], who said that  " At the start of each century there will arise in this [[ummah]] (the Muslim community) those who will call for a religious renewal " . Such people ([[Mujaddid|mujaddids]], or renewers of [[Islam]]), are believed to always come in the time when Muslim community departs from the true path defined by the [[Qur'an]] and [[sunnah]] (example of the Prophet). The task of the [[mujaddid]], therefore, is to return Muslims to their basic sources (the Qur'an and sunnah), to clean Islam from all un-Godly elements, to present Islam and make it flourish more or less in its original pure form and spirit. 
 
 The tradition of a renewal of the faith went back to Islam's first century, with the [[Caliphate|caliph]] [[Umar II]] ('Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz), who came to power in the Muslim year 99 and was particularly revered for his piety, in contrast to his predecessors. He was viewed as a renewer of the faith in an age of increasingly profane rule, and later [[mujaddid]]s and their movements in various parts of the Islamic world followed his precedent.
