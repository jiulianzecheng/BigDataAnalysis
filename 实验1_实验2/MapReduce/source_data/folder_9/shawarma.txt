 '''Shawarma''' ({{lang-ar|شاورما}}; in {{lang-tr|çevirme}}) is a [[meat]] [[sandwich]] eaten by people of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Middle East]]. It is served in round Arabic [[bread]] with [[meat]] and [[vegetable]]s, with some [[spice]] or sauce of choice in it. Normally, the meat can either be [[lamb (food)|lamb]], [[beef]], [[turkey]], or [[chicken]]. Shawarma can also be spelled '''chawarma''', '''shwarma''', '''shawerma''', or '''shoarmais'''. 
 
 It was first introduced by people from [[Turkey]]. They call it ''çevirme'', which means  " turning " , because the meat can be turned around in the oven, but the Arabs changed its [[recipe]] from the Turkish [[Doner kebab]].
