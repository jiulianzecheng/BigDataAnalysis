 An '''idiophone''' is a type of [[musical instrument]] that makes sound from the material of the instrument itself. < ref name=OMD > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/1753-idiophone |title=idiophone |publisher=On Music Dictionary |access-date=12 November 2015}} < /ref >  They do not use [[reed]]s, [[strings (music)|strings]] or [[resonator]]s. < ref name=OMD/ >  Most [[percussion instruments]] that are not [[drum]]s are idiophones. Idiophones make their sound by [[Wikt:hit|hitting]], [[Wikt:rub|rubbing]] or [[Wikt:shaking|shaking]]. < ref > Steve Tomecek, ''Music'' (New York: Chelsea House, 2010), p. 122 < /ref >  Drums are not idiophones. Neither are stringed instruments. Examples of idiophones include the [[Triangle (instrument)|triangle]], [[wood block]], [[maracas]], [[bell]], and [[gong]].
