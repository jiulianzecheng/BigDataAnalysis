 '''Palla''', [[Italian language]] for [[ball]], is the name of various traditional ball games of [[Italy]]. In Italian they also call ''pallacanestro'' for [[basketball]], ''pallavolo'' for [[volleyball]], ''pallamano'' for [[handball]] and ''pallanuoto'' for [[water polo]]. 
 
 ==Games== 
 ===Palla eh!=== 
 ''Palla eh!'' is an old [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] ball game from [[Maremma]] towns between [[Siena]] and [[Grosseto]].  It has this name because players call out ''eh!'' before serving. 
 
 Small hand-made balls contain a [[lead]] [[wikt:pellet|pellet]] wrapped in [[rubber]] and wool with a leather cover. The game is played by facing teams who strike, not catch, the ball with either a bare or gloved hand: every team include 3, 4 or 5 athletes. Courts are marked out with painted lines on town streets, but there is no net, and players can move between sides.  Adjacent buildings, objects, and sometimes spectators, are considered  " in play. "   Play does stop for oncoming automobiles.  Similar to [[real tennis]], a second bounce can result in a  " chase "  rather than an outright point, marked in chalk where the ball stops rolling. In one version of palla, scoring is identical to that of [[tennis]]: 15-30-40-game. 
 
 ===Palla 21=== 
 In a variant called ''palla 21'' scoring is 7-14-21 or game. In this form they use a rubber or [[plastic]] ball of 35-40 [[gram]]s. Firstly a palla 21 tournament was played in [[Chicago]] during [[2007]] with Italian national team.
