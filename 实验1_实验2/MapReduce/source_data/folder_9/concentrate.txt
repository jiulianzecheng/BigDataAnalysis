 A '''concentrate''' is a special form of a substance, where one of the base components is mostly removed. The most common case is the removal of the [[solvent]] from a [[solution]]: [[Fruit juice]] concentrate will have most of the [[water]] removed. The benefit of this is that the concentrate takes up less volume, and weighs less than the original solution. This can save [[Transport|transportation]] costs. When needed, the solvent can simply be added again.
