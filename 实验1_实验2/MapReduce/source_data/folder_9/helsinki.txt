 '''Helsinki''' ({{lang-sv|Helsingfors}}) is the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Finland]]. Helsinki is the largest city in Finland. 604,380 (31.12.2012) people live in Helsinki, and 1,360,000 live in the Helsinki [[metropolitan area]]. 
 
 Helsinki is in the south of Finland, on the coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. The city is in the [[Uusimaa]] region. When one looks from Helsinki, [[Tallinn]] is on the opposite side of the sea, but it is too far away to see. A [[poetry|poetic]] name for Helsinki is  " the daughter of the [[Baltic Sea]] " . 
 
 == History == 
 In 1550, [[Sweden|Swedish]] king [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] commanded people to build a new city and move there. His idea was to build a new place to trade, which would be more popular than Tallinn. The idea did not work well, and many people returned from Helsinki to their homes. Later Sweden built the [[fortress]] Suomenlinna in Helsinki. After [[Russia]] had taken Finland from Sweden in several wars, they started developing Helsinki. Helsinki became the [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[autonomy|autonomous]] province of Finland. When Finland became [[independence|independent]] in 1917, Helsinki stayed as the capital city. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Helsinki spreads around several [[bay]]s and over several [[island]]s. Some famous islands include [[Seurasaari]], [[Lauttasaari]] and [[Korkeasaari]] - which is also the country's biggest [[zoo]] - as well as the fortress island of [[Suomenlinna]] (Sveaborg). 
 
 The metropolitan area of [[Greater Helsinki]] also includes two of Finland's biggest cities, [[Espoo]] to the west of Helsinki, and [[Vantaa]] to the north. These two cities, along with Helsinki itself and the small town of [[Kauniainen]] (which is in fact surrounded by Espoo), make up the Capital Region (''Pääkaupunkiseutu'' in Finnish or ''Huvudstadsregionen'' in Swedish). There are other towns nearby that are part of Greater Helsinki, including [[Järvenpää]], [[Kerava]], [[Tuusula]], [[Nurmijärvi]], [[Sipoo]], [[Kirkkonummi]], [[Mäntsälä]] and [[Vihti]]. They have become popular places for Helsinki [[commuter]]s to live. 
 
 == Transport == 
 The [[public transport]]ation network in Helsinki and its area consists of 
 *many [[bus]] routes serving most of the region. They are operated by different companies under [[contract]] to HSL. 
 *one [[Rapid transit|metro]] line (with two [[Branch line|branches]]) between Helsinki and its eastern [[suburb]]s. The line first opened in 1982 and was extended to Espoo in 2017. 
 *eleven [[tram]] lines, located mostly in the city centre. A [[light rail]] line serving the northern suburbs has been planned and construction will begin in 2019. 
 *several [[commuter rail|commuter trains]] between Helsinki and nearby cities. Some lines go as far as [[Lahti]], [[Riihimäki]] and [[Karis]]. 
 
 [[Helsinki Airport]] is located in Vantaa about 20 kilometers north of Helsinki city center. The airport offers both domestic flights within Finland and international flights to [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. 
 
 Helsinki offers several boat services to [[Tallinn]] and [[Stockholm]] every day, along with [[ferry|ferries]] to places including the island of Suomenlinna.
