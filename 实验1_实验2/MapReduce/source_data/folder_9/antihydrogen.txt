'''Antihydrogen''' is an [[atom]] made of [[antimatter]]. Like normal matter, antihydrogen can bond and form [[molecules]] with other antimatter. (It would annihilate any normal matter that it touches). Antihydrogen has one [[positron]]–which is [[Electric charge|positively charged]]–[[orbit]]ing an [[antiproton]], which is negatively charged. This is opposite normal [[hydrogen]], which has one negatively charged [[electron]] orbiting a positively charged [[proton]]. 
 
 " Antihydrogen "  can also refer to the [[molecule]] called Antihydrogen, which is made of two bonded [[antiproton]]s.
