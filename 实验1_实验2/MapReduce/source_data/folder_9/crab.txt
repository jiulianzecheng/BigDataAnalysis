 '''Crabs''' are a form of decapods (having eight walking legs and two grasping claws), along with [[lobster]]s, [[crayfish]] and [[shrimp]]s. Crabs form an order within the decapods, called the Brachyura. Their short body is covered by a thick [[exoskeleton]]. 
 
 They are an extremely successful group, found all over the world. They are basically heavily armored shell-breakers. Most crabs live in sea-water, but there are some who live in fresh water, and some who live on land. The smallest are the size of a pea; the largest (the [[Japanese spider crab]]) grows to a leg span of 4 metres. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/crab-facts.html|title=Size of crabs|access-date=2008-12-11|archive-date=2016-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306212413/http://www.buzzle.com/articles/crab-facts.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  About 7,000 species are known. < ref > Walters, Martin  &  Johnson, Jinny. 2007.

 == Structure and life-style == 
 === Body === 
 Crabs have short [[tail]]s. A crab's tail and  reduced [[abdomen]] is entirely hidden under the [[thorax]]. It is folded under its body, and may not be visible at all unless the crab is turned over. Usually they have a very hard [[exoskeleton]]. This means they are well protected against [[predator]]s. Crabs are armed with a single pair of [[claw]]s. Crabs can be found in all [[ocean]]s. Some crabs also live in [[fresh water]], or live completely on land. 
 
 === Pincers === 
 [[File:Fiddler crab anatomy-en.svg|thumb|250px|right|Anatomy of a ''fiddler crab''|alt=Anatomical drawing of crab, labeling walking legs, carapace, eye, antenna, rostrum chelipeds, propodus, carpus, and merus]] 
 The pincers (claws) of crabs are their most important weapons. They have at least three functions. The pincers' role in eating is to seize and subdue the [[prey]]. If the food is a shellfish ([[mollusc]]), then the pincers can exert force to open or break the mollusks shell. Pincers are also used in fighting between males, and for signalling to other crabs. 
 
 === Food === 
 Crabs are [[omnivore]]s, they eat almost anything they find. Often this is [[algae]], but animal food is essential for its good health and development. They will eat [[mollusc]]s, other crustaceans, [[worm]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Diet composition influeces the fitness of the herbivorous crab ''Grapsus albolineatus'' |journal=Oecologia |author=Kennish, R. |volume=105 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=22–29 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00328787 |doi=10.1007/BF00328787 |pmid=28307118 |bibcode=1996Oecol.105...22K |s2cid=24146814 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|title=Diet choice in an omnivorous salt-marsh crab: different food types, body size, and habitat complexity |author=Buck T.L. |display-authors=etal |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |year=2003 |volume=292 |issue=1 |pages=103–116 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=14847986 |doi=10.1016/S0022-0981(03)00146-1 |access-date=2009-11-12 |archive-date=2009-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206202643/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=14847986 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Crabs as food == 
 Crabs are prepared and eaten all over the world. Some species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as soft-shell crab; with other species just the claws and/or legs are eaten. In some regions spices improve the culinary experience. In Asia, Masala Crab and Chilli crab are examples of heavily [[spice]]d dishes. In the [[United States]] state of [[Maryland]], blue crab is often eaten with Old Bay Seasoning. 
 
 For the British dish ''Cromer crab'', the meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell. One American way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding a flour mix, creating a crab cake. Crabs are also used in ''bisque'', a French soup. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 True crabs appear in the fossil record in the Lower [[Jurassic]]. They are part of the '[[Mesozoic]] marine revolution', in which a number of sea-floor predators evolved. < ref name=Vermeij1977 > {{cite journal| author = Vermeij G.J.| date =  1977 | title = The Mesozoic marine revolution; evidence from snails, predators and grazers| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 3| issue = 3 | pages = 245–258| doi = 10.1017/S0094837300005352 | jstor = 2400374 | s2cid = 54742050 | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/2400374 | accessdate = 2008-05-13}} < /ref > < ref name=Stanley2008 > {{cite journal| author = Stanley S.M.| year = 2008| title = Predation defeats competition on the seafloor| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 34| pages = 1–21| doi = 10.1666/07026.1| s2cid = 83713101}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|author=Stanley SM |year=1974 |title=What has happened to the articulate brachiopods? |journal=GSA Abstracts with Programs |volume=8|pages=966–967}} < /ref > 
 
 === Tailpiece === 
 The closest relatives of the crabs are anomurans, a crustacean group which includes animals such as [[hermit crab]]s, king crabs and squat lobsters. They look a lot like crabs and many have the word 'crab' in their name, but are not true crabs. Anomurans can be told apart by the number of legs: crabs have eight legs, along with two claws or pincers, while the last pair of an anomuran's legs is hidden inside the shell, so that only six are visible.
