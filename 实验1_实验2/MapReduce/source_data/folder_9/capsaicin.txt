 [[File:Capsicum ..jpg|thumb|Capsaicin is named after the bell peppers (genus [[Capsicum]]) where it is found]] 
 
 '''Capsaicin''' is a [[chemical substance]]. It is responsible for the sense of ''spiciness'' or ''hotness'' found in [[chili pepper]]s. In [[mammals]], it causes a sensation of ''burning'' of the tissues it comes in contact with. < ref > It is likely that the effects work on any other kind of herbivore, but on mammals it certainly does. < /ref >  Capsaicin, and other similar substances called '''capsaicinoids''' are produced by chili peppers and other plants, probably as a protection against being eaten. < ref name= " totn " > [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93636630 What made chili peppers so spicy?] Talk of the Nation, 15 Aug 2008. < /ref >  Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] to waxy compound. 
 
 Capsaicinoids are added to food to make it have a ''hot'' [[taste]], but it can also be used as an [[analgesic]], a painkiller. Such painkillers are often directly used on the skin. The ''burning'' of the capsaicin will mask the real pain. Capsaicin is also the main agent in [[pepper spray]].  
 
 Capsaicin is not soluble in water; it binds to [[oil]] and [[fat]]. [[Soap]] can be used to wash it off. If something too hot has been eaten, [[milk]] or [[yoghurt]] can be used.
