 '''United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)''' is an [[organization]] established by the [[United Nations]] (UN) in December 1949. Its main purpose is to provide assistance and support to [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees who were displaced due to the [[1948 Palestine War]]. UNRWA offers necessary services such as education, [[healthcare]], [[social services]], and emergency aid to Palestinian refugees in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=What is the UNRWA?|url=https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-the-unrwa/a-67097460|access-date=31 December 2023|website=[[Deutsche Welle|DW]]|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 UNRWA has over 30,000 people as [[Employee|employs]], most of them Palestinian refugees, and a small number of international staff. The agency operates numerous schools and health centers, offering education and medical care to Palestinian refugees. UNRWA's services aim to improve the living conditions and well-being of these refugee communities. 
 
 UNRWA is funded through voluntary contributions from various countries around the world and is separate from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), which serves other refugee populations globally. The agency's mandate is regularly renewed by the [[UN General Assembly]] to continue its support and assistance to Palestinian refugees until a just and durable solution to [[Israel–Palestine conflict|their situation]] is achieved. 
 
 During the [[2023 Israel–Hamas war|Israel–Hamas War in 2023-24]], at least 136 members of UNRWA working in Gaza Strip were killed by israel. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Israeli strikes kill UN staff, more than 70 of his extended family in Gaza|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/israeli-strikes-kill-un-staff-more-than-70-of-his-extended-family-in-gaza|access-date=31 December 2023|website=[[Al Jazeera]]|language=en}} < /ref >
