{{Distinguish|Fertilization}} 
 A '''fertilizer''' is a [[chemical]] that helps [[plant]]s to grow. It is used to replace the [[mineral]] [[salt]]s taken by [[plant]]s or removed/washed away by [[rain]]. 
 
 Common fertilizers: 
 
 * [[Ammonia]] 
 * [[Manure]] (Animal [[waste]]) which was the first fertilizer. 
 * [[Compost]] 
 * [[Urea]] 
 
 The important things in fertilizer are: 
 * [[Nitrogen]] (N) 
 * [[Phosphorus]] (P) 
 * [[Potash]] (K) 
 
 When fertilizers are offered for sale, the percentage of N, P, and K must be written on the bags or boxes, but for historcal reasons, P is shown as %P2O5 and K is shown as %K2O. 
 
 E.g.:9-23-30 which means:    9% N, 23%P2O5 and 30%K2O. 
 
 In [[Australia]] the pecent of elemental [[sulfur]] must also be shown. 
 In the UK, the elemental composition (in percentages) may also be shown alongside the mandatory  traditional system, provided the numbers are put inside square brackets. 
 
 [[Leaf]]y [[plant]]s need lots of N.  [[Flower]]ing plants need lots of P and K. 
 
 A [[soil test]] can tell how much N, P, and K is needed.
