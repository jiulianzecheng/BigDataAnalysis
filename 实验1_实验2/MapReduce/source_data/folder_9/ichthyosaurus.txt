 '''''Ichthyosaurus''''' was an [[extinct]] [[Ocean|marine]] [[reptile]] from the [[Lower Jurassic]]. It was the first member of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Ichthyosaur]]ia to be discovered. The first complete skeleton was discovered in the early 19th century (1810/11) by [[Mary Anning]] in the [[Dorset]] [[Jurassic Coast]]. Many more specimens were found in Europe, especially from the [[limestone]] quarries in [[Holzmaden]], southern [[Germany]]. 
 
 Ichthyosaurus lived from about 199 to 189 million years ago (mya). 
 This sleek animal could perhaps swim at speeds up to 25 & nbsp;mph (40 kph). 
 
 == Mode of life == 
 === Live birth === 
 ''Ichthyosaurus'' bore live young. This we know from fossil evidence. It was thought at first that ''Ichthyosaurus'' laid eggs on land, but fossil evidence shows that the females gave birth to live young. Because they did, their [[life habit]] could be entirely [[aquatic]]. They were well-adapted to life as fully [[pelagic]] organisms because they never needed to come onto land. The babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water. < ref name= " Böttcher, 1990 " / > 
 
 Hundreds of well-preserved, [[fossil]]ised skeletons have been found in Jurassic rock at Holzmaden. Some of the bones were still articulated. Some fossils still had baby specimens inside them, indicating that ''Ichthyosaurus'' was [[viviparous]]. Similar finds in the related ''[[Stenopterygius]]'' also show this. < ref name= " Böttcher, 1990 " > Böttcher R. 1990. Neue Erkenntnisse über die Fortpflanzungsbiologie der Ichthyosaurier.

 === Fins === 
 The German fossils also featured the outline of ''Ichthyosaurus'' skin, showing it had a fleshy [[dorsal fin]] on its back and a large [[caudal fin]]. Other ichthyosaur fossils proved this feature was not limited to ''Ichthyosaurus''. 
 
 ===  Sense organs === 
 ''Ichthyosaurus'' ear bones were solid, probably transferring water vibrations to the [[inner ear]]. Still, hunting by sight was the creature's main feeding activity; it had huge, sensitive eyes, protected by bony shields. 
 
 === Feeding === 
 [[Coprolite]]s (fosillized excreta) of ''Ichthyosaurus'' show its diet consisted of fish and [[squid]]. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/80 80]|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >
