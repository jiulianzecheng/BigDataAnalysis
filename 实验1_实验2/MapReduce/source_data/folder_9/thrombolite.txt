'''Thrombolites''' are ancient types of [[microbe|microbial]] communities that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. They are similar to [[stromatolites]], but they are formed differently. 
 
 Stromatolites are clearly layered, but thrombolites are not. They are  " clotted accretionary structures " . They formed in shallow water by the trapping, holding, and cementing [[sedimentary]] grains by microorganisms, especially [[cyanobacteria]]. < ref > Kennard J.M.  &  James N.P  1986. Thrombolites and stromatolites: two distinct types of microbial structures. ''Palaios'' '''1''', 492-503. [http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/content/1/5/492] < /ref >  They were common in the [[Cambrian]] and early [[Ordovician]], and few examples still exist today.
