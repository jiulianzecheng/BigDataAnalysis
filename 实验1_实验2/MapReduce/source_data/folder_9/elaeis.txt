 '''''Elaeis''''' (from Greek 'oil') is a [[genus]] of [[Palm tree|palms]] with two [[species]], called '''oil palms'''. They are used in commercial [[Farming|agriculture]] in the production of [[palm oil]]. The African oil palm ''Elaeis guineensis'' (the species name ''guineensis'' refers to its country of origin) is the main source of palm oil. It is native to west and southwest [[Africa]]. It can be found between [[Angola]] and [[The Gambia|Gambia]]. The American oil palm ''Elaeis oleifera'' (from Latin  oleifer 'oil-producing') < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/namesplants00gled_746|title=The Name of Plants|last=Gledhill|first=David|publisher=University Press|year=2008|edition=4|location=Cambridge|page=[https://archive.org/details/namesplants00gled_746/page/n288 279]|url-access=limited}} < /ref >  is native to tropical [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], < ref > Collins Guide to Tropical Plants, {{ISBN|0-00-219112-1}} < /ref >  and is used locally for oil production. 
 
 == Description == 
 Mature palms are single-stemmed, and can grow well over {{Convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are pinnate, and reach between {{Convert|3|-|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.

 The palm fruit is reddish, about the size of a large [[plum]], and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single [[seed]] (the palm kernel), also rich in oil. 
 
 == Species == 
 The two species, ''E. guineensis'' and ''E. oleifera'' can produce [[fertile]] [[hybrid]]s. The [[genome]] of ''E. guineensis'' has been sequenced, which has important implications for breeding improved strains of the crop plants. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Singh, R.|last2=Ong-Abdullah, M.|last3=Low, E.-T.L.|last4=Manaf, M.A.A.|last5=Rosli, R.|last6=Nookiah, R.|last7=Ooi, L.C.-L.|last8=Ooi, S.-E.|last9=Chan, K.-L.|year=2013|title=Oil palm genome sequence reveals divergence of interfertile species in Old and New worlds|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7462|pages=335–339|doi=10.1038/nature12309|pmc=3929164|pmid=23883927|bibcode=2013Natur.500..335S}} < /ref >

 == Human use == 
 These palms are grown commercially, mainly for three reasons: 
 
 * The production of [[palm oil]]. Palm oil contains more [[Saturated fat]]s than most other [[vegetable oil]]s. It can withstand [[Deep frying|deep-frying]] heat and resists [[oxidation]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=De Marco|first1=Elena|last2=Savarese|first2=Maria|last3=Parisini|first3=Cristina|last4=Battimo|first4=Ilaria|last5=Falco|first5=Salvatore|last6=Sacchi|first6=Raffaele|year=2007|title=Frying performance of a sunflower/palm oil blend in comparison with pure palm oil|journal=European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology|volume=109|issue=3|pages=237–246|doi=10.1002/ejlt.200600192}} < /ref >  It also contains no  [[trans fat]]. 
 * Oil from the African oil palm is used as [[biofuel]]. 
 * These palms can be used to produce [[Fibre|fiber]]. 
 
 In coastal West Africa, the use of these palms may date back about 5.000 years. Palm oil was discovered in a [[tomb]] at [[Abydos]], dating back to 3.000 BCE. < ref name= " Kiple " > {{cite book|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/palmoil.htm|title=The Cambridge World History of Food|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0521402166|editor1-last=Kiple|editor1-first=Kenneth F.|access-date=30 August 2012|editor2-last=Conee Ornelas|editor2-first=Kriemhild|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020201103/http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/palmoil.htm|archive-date=20 October 2012|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Especially the African oil palm is widely cultivated in tropical countries outside Africa.  Today, most of the commercially produced palm oil comes from [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. 
 
 == Controversy == 
 Palm oil is controversial. This [[controversy]] is not based on palm oil itself, but on the conditions how it is produced. Very often, [[rainforest]], with a high [[biodiversity]] is destroyed to make room for palm oil [[plantation]]s. The companies producing the palm oil also often force people to move away and change their way of life. Especially in [[Indonesia]], there is growing pressure for palm oil producers to prove that they are not harming rare animals in the cultivation process. < ref > {{Cite news|title=Palm Oil Plantations Are Blamed For Many Evils. But Change Is Coming|language=en|work=NPR.org|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/04/21/396815303/palm-oil-plantations-are-blamed-for-many-evils-but-change-is-coming|access-date=2017-07-19}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2018 a [[Christmas]] TV advertisement by UK supermarket chain [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland Foods Ltd]], produced by [[Greenpeace]], was banned by the UK advertising watchdog [[Clearcast]], as it was deemed too political.  Iceland Foods had committed to banning palm oil from its own-brand products by the end of 2018.
