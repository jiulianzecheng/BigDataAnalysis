 '''Opossums''' are the largest [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[marsupials]]  in the [[Western Hemisphere]], the '''Didelphimorphia'''.  
 
 They are often called [[possum]]s, though that term is more properly applied to [[Australia]]n fauna of the suborder [[Phalangeriformes]].  
 
 The [[Virginia opossum]] was the first animal to be called an ''opossum'': the word comes from the [[Algonquian language|Algonquian]] language, and means  " white beast. "  It was one of the few [[South America]]n marsupials to establish itself permanently in [[North America]] after the [[Great American Interchange]], and the only one to survive there today. 
 
 Scientists used to believe that opossums are large numbers of [[tick]]s, but now they think they do not. Wildlife scientist Cecilia Hennessy thinks this belief came from a paper called  " Hosts as ecological traps for the vector of Lyme disease.

 [[Marsupial]]s like opossums are born before their [[jaw]] bones have grown enough for them to drink their mothers' milk the way other baby [[mammal]]s do.  Scientists from [[King's College London]] found that opossums and other marsupials use tissue from their inner ear to make a temporary jaw so they can feed and grow. < ref name= " Ev " > {{cite press release|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/e-haj063020.php|title=Hints at jaw evolution found in marsupials and monotremes |date=June 30, 2020|accessdate=July 1, 2020|author=eLife|publisher=Eurekalert.org}} < /ref > < ref name= " Anthwal " > {{cite journal|url=https://elifesciences.org/articles/57860|author1=Neal Anthwal|title=Transient role of the middle ear as a lower jaw support across mammals|date=June 30, 2020|journal=eLife|accessdate=July 1, 2020|author2= Jane Catherine Fenelon|author3=Stephen D Johnston|author4=Marilyn B Renfree|author5=Abigail S Tucker|volume=9 |doi=10.7554/eLife.57860 |pmid=32600529 |pmc=7363448 }} < /ref >
