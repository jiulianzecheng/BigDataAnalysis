'''Uniformitarianism''' is the idea that the same [[physical law]]s of today have always operated. It was the centerpiece of [[James Hutton]]'s 1795 [[geology]] book ''Theory of the Earth, with proofs and illustrations''. 
 
 In this work Hutton proposed that the causes acting on the world today also acted in the past. This means that the [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] of the [[Earth]] were formed by [[process]]es which we can see operating today. These processes, though very slow ([[gradualism]]), made the world what it is today. The idea is part of a wider [[philosophy]] called the [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophy of naturalism]]. 
 
 The term 'uniformitarianism' was invented by [[William Whewell]] in 1837 to describe Hutton's basic idea. < ref > Whewell W. 1847.

Parker, London. p665 < /ref > < ref > Whewell W. 1857. ''History of the inductive sciences''. 3rd ed, Parker, London. vol 3, p508 < /ref >  This idea is the foundation of modern [[geology]].  
 
 Hutton's ideas were popularised by [[John Playfair]] in 1802 in ''Illustrations of the Huttonian theory of the Earth'', and by [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of geology'' (1830 to 1833). The phrase  " the present is the key to the past "  is Lyell's most famous quotation. 
 
 Uniformitarianism in geology is opposed by [[catastrophism]], the idea that major changes in the Earth take place through sudden and violent events.
