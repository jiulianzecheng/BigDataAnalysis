 ==The end== 
 The match against France in Paris, which Austria was able to win 4-0, is generally seen as the last game played by the miracle team.  Hiden got an offer from Racing Club de Paris President Jean-Bernard Lévy. He made an offer to the Austrian goalie, which Hiden immediately accepted. He ended his career in the Austrian national team with this game and moved from Wiener AC to Paris in 1933 for a transfer fee of 80,000 francs. Several national players followed Hiden's example and went abroad, which caused significant losses in the technical game of the Austrians, although there was only one defeat against Czechoslovakia (1:2) in the following 13 games.
