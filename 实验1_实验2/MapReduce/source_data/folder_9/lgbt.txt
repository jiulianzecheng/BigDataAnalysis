 '''''LGBT''''' is an [[initialism]] that means [[Lesbian|'''l'''esbian]], [[Gay man|'''g'''ay]], [[bisexuality|'''b'''isexual]], and [[Transgender|'''t'''ransgender]]. It refers to the  [[community]] of people who are not [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]], which means to be attracted to the other gender, or [[cisgender]], which means to identify as the gender you were born as. < ref name= " Gay Pride Nee "  / > < ref name= " The Handbook of Lesb "  / >   It has been taken up by many [[sexuality]] and [[gender identity]]-related community centers. 
 
 == History == 
 Before the ''' " [[sexual revolution]] " ''' of the 1960s, there was no [[wikt:neutral|neutral]] word or group of words for people who were not [[heterosexual]].  
 
 The word ''' " [[homosexual]] " '''  started being used in America to describe [[sexual orientation]]s that were not [[heterosexual]]. However, this word began to have bad [[wikt:connotation|connotations]], as many people thought that it sounded like a condition or mental illness, and therefore the word  " '''homophile''' "  was used instead. < ref name= " Departing from Deviance "  / >  After that, the word  " '''[[gay]]''' "  replaced the word  " homophile "  in the 1970s. < ref name= " The Social Studies C "  / > 
 
 As '''[[lesbian]]s''' became more public about their sexuality in the 1970s, the group of words ''' " gay and lesbian " ''' was often used, < ref name= " Gay Pride Nee "  / >  and a phase of [[lesbian feminism]] started. This meant that certain lesbian feminist groups separated because did not have knowledge of if they should put [[feminism]] or [[LGBT rights]] first. < ref name= " accommodation "  / > 
 
 Lesbian feminists viewed the separation between  " [[wikt:butch|butch]] "  and  " [[wikt:femme|femme]] "  in mainstream gay (male) culture of the time in the same way that they viewed the separation in society over [[gender roles]] between men and women. They saw these ideas as [[wikt:patriarchal|patriarchal]] and did not want to join the [[wikt:mainstream|mainstream]] gay rights movement because of what they saw as the [[wikt:male chauvinism|chauvinism]] of [[gay men]], and refused to take up their cause. < ref name= " twentieth "  / >  Many lesbians who were not lesbian feminists saw this as not giving help to the gay rights movement. < ref name= " faderman "  / > 
 
 This was followed by many [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people wanting to be seen as respected groups in the LGBT community. < ref name= " Gay Pride Nee " / >  Before gender reassignment surgery was massively improved in later years, transgender people had a hard time being accepted. Still, they fought for their rights, and were greatly boosted when plastic surgery and hormone surgery helped them to be accepted as the gender they identify with.  
 
 After the [[Stonewall riots]], there was a change in points of view among the gay and lesbian community. Many gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual and transgender persons in general. < ref name= " Transgender Subjectivities "  / > < ref name= " Bisexuality and Transgend "  / >  Many gays and lesbians thought that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and that bisexuals were actually gay, but in too much fear to  " [[coming out|come out of the closet]] " . < ref name= " Transgender Subjectivities " / >  This separation still exists today, and it only became common to speak of all members of the LGBT community with equal respect in the trouble for LGBT rights in the late 1990s. < ref name= " Bisexuality and Transgend "  / > 
 
 == Acceptance of LGBT people == 
 Some people who are LGBT may not  " come out " , as they may be a target of [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]], such as [[homophobia]] or [[transphobia]]. < ref name= " vicvic "  / >  Many countries have discriminatory laws against LGBT people, some even giving out the [[death penalty]] for being gay or bisexual. < ref name= " territiory "  / > 
 
 == Different forms of the acronym == 
 
 === Shortening of the term === 
 When not including transgender persons in general, the acronym is sometimes shortened to just  " ''LGB'' " . < ref name= " Bisexuality and Transgend "  / > < ref name= " Psychology and Sexu "  / > 
 
 === Other letters === 
 
 [[File:Marcha-orgullo-buenos-aires.JPG|thumb|left|2007 LGBT [[pride parade]] in [[Buenos Aires]] organized by the ''Argentinean Federation of LGBT peoples'' with the '''LGBT''' acronym visible in the groups' banner (top right of image)]] 
 
 Many other letters are added to the acronym, so much so that it has been described as an  " alphabet soup "  by some. < ref name= " Huffpost1 "  / > < ref name= " PolicyMic1 "  / > < ref name= " pugetsoundoff "  / >  A few of the other letters added are: 
 * [[Queer|'''Q'''ueer]] or [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|'''Q'''uestioning]] < ref name= " Huffpost2 "  / > —added to the acronym to make it more inclusive. < ref name= " SantaCruzIn-queery "  / > < ref name= " In-Between Bodies "  / > < ref name= " Girls' Violence "  / > < ref name= " Advocacy Research in  "  / > 
 * [[Intersexuality|'''I'''ntersex]] < ref name=Huffpost2 / > —recorded use in the acronym since 1999. < ref name= " SexualMedicine "  / > < ref name= " Challenging Lesbian Norms "  / > < ref name= " Fenway Guide "  / >  (This acronym is used in all parts of  " The Activist's Guide "  of the [[Yogyakarta Principles in Action]]. < ref name= " Yogyakarta Principles in Action, Activist's Guide "  / > ) 
 * [[Asexuality|'''A'''sexual]], < ref name=Huffpost2 / >  [[Aromantic|'''A'''romantic]] or [[Agender|'''A'''gender]] < ref name= " :2 " > {{cite web|last=Kuykendall|first=Emily|title=What the A in LGBTQIA+ Stands For|url=http://www.buddy-project.org/articles/asexual-aromantic|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210521215113/http://www.buddy-project.org/articles/asexual-aromantic|archive-date=21 May 2021|access-date=21 May 2021|website=Buddy Project|language=en-US|quote=The A in LGBTQIA+ stands for asexual, aromantic, and agender[…]}} < /ref > 
 * [[Polyamory|'''P'''olyamorous]] or [[Pansexuality|'''P'''ansexual]] < ref name=Huffpost2 / > — however,  " '''pansexual''' "  is often thought of as being a [[category]] of  " '''bisexuality''' " , as well as the terms  " '''[[Omnisexuality|omnisexual]]''' "  and  " '''fluid''' " . < ref name= " blogspot "  / > 
 * [[Hijra (South Asia)|'''H'''ijra]]—the acronym '''LGBTIH''' has seen use in [[India]], in order to join the traditional Indian [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] [[third gender]] [[gender identity|identity]] and the related [[subculture]]. < ref name= " wordpress "  / > 
 * [[Non-binary|'''N'''on-binary]] < ref > {{cite dictionary|title=What does LGBTQIAPN stand for?|url=https://www.abbreviations.com/LGBTQIAPN|access-date=2022-02-05|website=www.abbreviations.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 * [[Demisexual|'''D'''emisexual]] < ref > {{Cite web|title=LGBTQIAPD - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, Pansexual, Demisexual {{!}} AcronymFinder|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/Lesbian,-Gay,-Bisexual,-Transgender,-Queer,-Intersex,-Asexual,-Pansexual,-Demisexual-(LGBTQIAPD).html|access-date=2022-05-20|website=www.acronymfinder.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Not everyone is in agreement what should or should not be covered in the acronym, or which order the letters should go in. < ref name=Huffpost2 / > 
 
 === Different terms === 
 *The group of words '''gender and sexual diversity''' ('''GSD''') has been shown as a different option to LGBT by some, as it is seen as more inclusive and less limiting. < ref name= " pinknews "  / > 
 
 *'''SGL''' ('''same-gender loving''') is sometimes used among gay male [[African American]]s as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they think of as [[white people|white]] LGBT groups of persons. < ref name= " The Politics of Gay Rights "  / > 
 
 *'''MSM''' ('''men who have sex with men''') is used to describe men who have sex with other men without having relation to their sexual orientation, often in a [[wikt:medical|medical]] [[wikt:context|context]]. < ref name= " discourse "  / > < ref name= " periodontology "  / > 
 
 *'''WSW''' ('''women who have sex with women''') is the opposite of MSM. It includes all women who have sex with women. 
 
 *'''AMAB''' (assigned male at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned the male sex at birth. 
 
 *'''AFAB''' (assigned female at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned the female sex at birth. 
 
 *'''AIAB''' (assigned intersex at birth) is used to describe people who were assigned intersex at birth. < ref name= " discourse "  / > 
 *'''MOGAI''' (marginalized orientations and gender alignments or identities and intersex) is a term somebody can use instead of using the term LGBT. MOGAI treats the idea of [[gender modality]] as more important than these other words do. < ref > {{Cite web|title=7 important events in history for the LGBTQIA+ community in Nepal|url=https://english.onlinekhabar.com/important-events-in-history-for-the-lgbtqia-community-in-nepal.html|access-date=2021-06-30|website=OnlineKhabar English News|date=28 June 2021 |language=en-GB}} < /ref >  It is an umbrella term because it is about many different kinds of people: A [[gay man]] and a [[trans woman]], for example, are both MOGAI.
