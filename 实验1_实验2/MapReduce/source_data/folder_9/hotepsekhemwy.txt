 '''Hotepsekhemwy''' was an [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early Egyptian]] king, the first ruler of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]]. It is not known how long he ruled. The [[Turin King List]] has him ruling for 95 years. < ref name=AHG > Alan H. Gardiner: ''The royal canon of Turin''.

 [[File:Abydos KL 02-01 n09.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Cartouche name of Hotepsekhemwy in the Abydos King List (cartouche no. 9).]] 
 Hotepsekhemwy's name has been found at [[Saqqara]], [[Giza]], [[Badari]] and [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], on clay seal impressions, stone vessels and bone cylinders. Several stone vessel inscriptions mention Hotepsekhemwy along with the name of his  successor [[Raneb]]. < ref name= " WoHe " > Wolfgang Helck: ''Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit (Ägyptologische Abhandlungen)'', Vol. 45, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, {{ISBN|3-447-02677-4}} < /ref > < ref > Guy Brunton: ''Qau and Badari I'', with chapters by Alan Gardiner and Flinders Petrie, British School of Archaeology in Egypt 44, London 1927: Bernard Quaritch, Tafel XIX, 25 < /ref > < ref > Gaston Maspero: ''Notes sur les objets recueillis sous la pyramide d'Ounas'' in: ''Annales du Service des Antiquités de l'Egypt (ASAE)'' Vol. III.

 The [[Ancient Egyptian royal titles#Horus name|Horus name]] of Hotepsekhemwy may give clues to the politics of the time. The Egyptian word  " Hotep "  means  " peaceful " ,  " to be pleased " , and also  " [[wikt:conciliation|conciliation]] "  or  " to be reconciled " . So Hotepsekhemwy's full name may be read as  " the two powers are reconciled "  or  " pleasing in powers " . This suggests a significant political meaning.  " The two powers "  could be [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Lower Egypt]] as well as to the major deities [[Horus]] and [[Set (mythology)|Seth]]. < ref name= " WoHe " / > < ref name=PeKa/ > < ref > Peter A. Clayton: ''Chronicle of the Pharaohs: The Reign-by-reign Record of the Rulers and Dynasties of Ancient Egypt'', Thames and Hudson, London 2006, {{ISBN|0-500-28628-0}}, page 26. < /ref > 
 
 From the reign of Hotepsekhemwy onward it became a tradition to write the Horus name and the [[Ancient Egyptian royal titles#Nebty ( " two ladies " ) name|nebty name]] in the same way. The Horus name has a clearly defined, [[symbol]]ic meaning in its translation. Horus- and nebty names being the same might also show, that the Horus name was used when becoming king. < ref name= " WoHe " / > 
 
 == Family == 
 The name of Hotepsekhemwy's wife is unknown. There could be a son, [[Perneb]], who had the titles “son of the king” and “priest of Sopdu”. The clay seals with Perneb's name and titles were found in a gallery tomb which belonged to two kings equally, Hotepsekhemwy and his successor, [[Raneb]]. It is not possible to know which was his father. < ref > Toby A. H. Wilkinson: ''Early dynastic Egypt: Strategy, Society and Security.''

 == Identity == 
 [[File:Cylinder Inscribed with a King's Name - Egypt, Dynasty 2, reign of Hetepsekhemwy, c. 2800-2780 BC, bone - Egypt- Brooklyn Museum - Brooklyn, NY - DSC08700.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Bone cylinder inscribed with the serekh of Hotepsekhemwy.]] 
 Hotepsekhemwy is known from lists made at the time of [[Ramesses II]]. The name ''Bedjau'' is found on the [[Abydos King List|Abydos king list]], ''Bedjatau'' from Giza, ''Netjer-Bau'' from the [[Saqqara King List|Sakkara king list]] and the name ''Bau-hetepju'' is on the [[Turin King List]]. A similar name, ''Bedjatau'', is on a short king list found on a writing board from the [[mastaba]] tomb '''G1001''' of the high official [[Mesdjeru]].  " Bedjatau "  means  " the foundryman " . This  is thought to be a misreading of the name  " Hotepsekhemwy " . The [[hieroglyph]]ic signs used to write  " Hotep "  are very similar to the signs of a pottery kiln and a chick in [[hieratic]] writings. The signs of two ''Sekhem''sceptres were misread as a leg and a drill. This kind of misreading may have happened in the case of King [[Khasekhemwy]], where the two sceptres in the Horus name were misread as two leg-symbols or two drill-signs. The Abydos king list copies this [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] name form of “Bedjatau”. The names  " Netjerbau "  and  " Bau-hetepju "  are problematic, since Egyptologists can't find any name source from Hotepsekhemwy's time that could have been used to form them. < ref name= " WoHe " / > < ref > Edward Brovarski: ''Two Old Kingdom writing boards from Giza''. In: ''Annales du Service des Antiquités de l´Egypte'', Vol.71, 1987, Table 1 < /ref > < ref > Thomas Schneider: ''Lexikon der Pharaonen''. Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, {{ISBN|3-491-96053-3}}, page 134. < /ref > 
 
 == Reign == 
 Little is known about Hotepsekhemwy's reign. Evidence shows he may have gained the throne after a period of political strife. During this time there were several kings who only ruled for a very short time, such as [[Horus Bird (Pharaoh)|Horus  " Bird " ]] and [[Sneferka]]. Sneferka could be a name used by king [[Qaa (Pharaoh)|Qaa]] for a short time. The tomb of king Qaa was robbed at the end of [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First dynasty]], and was restored during the reign of Hotepsekhemwy. The robbing of the cemetery and the conciliatory meaning of the name Hotepsekhemwy may be clues of a dynastic struggle. The kings Sneferka and Horus “Bird” were left out of later king lists, perhaps because their struggles for the Egyptian throne led to the collapse of the first dynasty. < ref name= " WoHe " / > < ref name=PeKa > Peter Kaplony: ''„Er ist ein Liebling der Frauen“ – Ein „neuer“ König und eine neue Theorie zu den Kronprinzen sowie zu den Staatsgöttinnen (Kronengöttinnen) der 1./2. Dynastie''. In: Manfred Bietak: ''Ägypten und Levante''.

 A new royal residence called  " Horus the shining star "  built for Hotepsekhemwy. He also built a temple near [[Buto]] for the god ''Netjer-Achty'' and founded the  " Chapel of the White Crown " . The white crown, the [[hedjet]], is a symbol of [[Upper Egypt]]. This is a clue to the origin of Hotepsekhemwy's dynasty, and shows a likely source of political power. < ref name= " WoHe " / > < ref > Toby A. H. Wilkinson: ''Early Dynastic Egypt''. Routledge, London 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-18633-1}}, page 285  &  286. < /ref >  There is no mention of a [[Sed festival]],which shows that Hotepsekhemwy cannot have ruled longer than 30 years. The Sed festival was celebrated as the anniversary for a reign of 30 years. < ref > Nabil M. A. Swelim: ''Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty''. Archaeological Society, Alexandria 1983, (Archaeological and Historical Studies 7). page 67-77. < /ref > [[File:Saqqarah Hotepsekhemoui.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Entrance to the gallery tomb beneath the Unas passway.]] 
 
 The ancient Egyptian historian [[Manetho]] reported that during his reign,  " a chasm opened near [[Bubastis]] and many perished " . Although Manetho wrote in the 3rd century BC – over two thousand years later – the story may be based on fact, as the region near Bubastis is known to be [[Seismology|seismically]] active. < ref name=WGW/ > 
 
 == Tomb == 
 The location of Hotepsekhemwy's tomb is unknown. Some Egyptologists believe it could be the giant underground ''Gallery Tomb B'' beneath the funeral passage of the [[Unas]]-[[necropolis]] at Saqqara. Many seal impressions of king Hotepsekhemwy have been found in these galleries. Others think that ''Gallery Tomb B'' is the burial site of king [[Raneb]]. Several seal impressions of this ruler were also found there. < ref name= " EME "  / > < ref > Alessandre Barsanti in: ''Annales du service des antiquités de lÉgypte - Súppleménts''; Volume II.
