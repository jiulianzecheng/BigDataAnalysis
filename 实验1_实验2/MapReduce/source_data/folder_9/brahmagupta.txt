'''Brahmagupta''' ({{audio|Brahmagupta.ogg|listen}}) (born {{circa|598 CE}}, died {{circa|668 CE}}) was an Indian [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]]. He was the author of two early works on [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]: the ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'' (BSS,  " correctly established [[Siddhanta|doctrine]] of [[Brahma]] " , dated 628). 
 
 Brahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with ''[[zero]]''. The texts composed by Brahmagupta were composed in [[elliptical poetry|elliptical verse]] in [[Sanskrit]], as was common practice in [[Indian mathematics]].  As no proofs are given, it is not known how Brahmagupta's results were derived. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Brahmagupta biography < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Brahmagupta.html |access-date=2018-05-17 |archive-date=2013-09-15 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Jeq9449q?url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Brahmagupta.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
