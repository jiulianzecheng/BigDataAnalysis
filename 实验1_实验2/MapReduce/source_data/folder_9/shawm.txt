 The '''shawm''' was a [[musical instrument]] of the [[woodwind]] family that was played in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].  The modern [[oboe]] was developed from the shawm.  Like the modern oboe, the shawm was played by blowing into a double [[Reed (instrument)|reed]].  It was usually made from one piece of wood, with a flare at the end (like a [[trumpet]]).  It sounded very loud, and was mostly used outdoors. 
 
 In [[German language|German]] the shawm is called ''Schalmei'' or ''Pommer''.  The first word may have come from the [[Latin]] word ''calamus''  meaning  " reed or stalk " .  There were many kinds of shawm over the centuries in Europe and they had a variety of names.  There were also several different sizes.
