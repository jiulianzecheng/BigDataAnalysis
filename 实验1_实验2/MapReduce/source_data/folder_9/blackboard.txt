 A '''blackboard''', also called a '''chalkboard''', is a [[surface]] on which  [[chalk]] is visible. < ref > Originally, actual geological chalk was used. However, in the 20th century it was an artifical product. < /ref >  It is used as a surface to [[write]] on. It is usually made up of [[wood]] or [[Fibre|fiber]]. It is painted [[black]] to reflect the white chalks. 
 
 Blackboards are often used to help in [[Pedagogy|teaching]] in [[school]]. Blackboards are not used as much now but can be seen in some [[school]]s still. The chalk dust got everywhere, and some people are allergic to chalk dust. Now people use [[whiteboard]]s: they can take modern felt-tip colour markers, and clean easily.  
 
 Schoolteachers often use the chalkboard to display things at large. It also makes the learning cooperative between teachers and student. Chalkboards can be black or dark green, in which case they may be called blackboards and greenboards.
