 The '''Bauhaus''' was a design school that operated from 1919 to 1933 in [[Germany]]. It is widely regarded as the most influential art school of the 20th century. It promoted [[modernism]]. It is most well known for teaching painting, photography, advertising, weaving, architecture and the design of furniture and household products. The work that it produced and its teaching methods had a world-wide influence on art, design, photography, architecture and art education. < ref name= " wh " > {{cite web|title=Bauhaus and its Sites in Weimar and Dessau|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/729|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=7 May 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 It was formally called the  " Staatliches Bauhaus "  from 1919 to 1932 because it was state funded in that period. From 1919 to 1925 it was in [[Weimar]], in the state of [[Thuringia]] and from 1926 to 1932 it was in [[Dessau]], in the state of [[Sachsen-Anhalt]]. It operated as privately funded school in [[Berlin]] from the end of 1932 until April 1933.  < ref > Fielder, Jeannine (2016) ''Bauhaus''. Potsdam: h.f.ullmann  < /ref >
