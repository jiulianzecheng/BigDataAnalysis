 }} < /ref >  It accelerates [[charged particle]]s by whirling them in a circle. The first cyclotrons were the size of a hand. Some modern circular accelerators use a circle as wide as a city. 
 
 Cyclotrons use perpendicular [[magnetic field]] to bend [[electron]]s and [[particle]]s through into a semicircular path by an applied [[electric field]]. The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the  " D "  electrodes(also called  " dees " ) of the magnetic field region. 
 
 The accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle, so that it accelerates them across the gap. With a higher speed, they move in a larger semicircle. After repeating this process several times, they come out the exit port at a high speed. 
 
 == Cyclotron Frequency == 
 
 A moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field. If the time to complete one orbit is calculated: 
 
 < math > T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}=\frac{2\pi mv}{qBv}=\frac{2\pi m}{qB} < /math > . 
 
 It is found that the period is independent of the radius. Therefore if a [[square wave]] is applied at [[angular frequency]] qB/m, the charge will spiral outward, increasing in speed. 
 
 When a square wave of angular frequency Ï‰=qB/m is applied between the two sides of the [[magnetic poles]], the charge will be boosted again at just the right time to accelerate it across the gap. Thus the constant cyclotron [[frequency]] can continue to accelerate the charge (so long as it is not relativistic).
