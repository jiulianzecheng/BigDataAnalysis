 A '''warehouse''' is a commercial [[building]] for [[storage]] of [[goods]]. Warehouses are used by [[manufacturer]]s, [[import]]ers, [[export]]ers, [[wholesale]]rs, [[transport]] businesses, [[customs]], etc.  They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities and towns.  They have [[loading dock]]s to load and unload [[truck]]s; or sometimes are loaded directly from [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, or [[seaport]]s.  They also often have [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[forklift]]s for moving goods, which are usually placed on ISO standard [[pallet]]s loaded into [[pallet rack]]s. < ref > [https://kyivlogisticsschool.com/news/odnakovih-pomilok-v-upravlinni-skladom/ Common mistakes in managing a sweet] < /ref > 
 
 In logistics, the warehouse performs the function of accumulating reserves of material resources necessary to dampen fluctuations in supply and demand volumes, as well as synchronizing the flow rates of goods in systems of promotion from manufacturers to consumers or material flows in technological production systems.
