 '''Polyethylene''' (also called '''polyethene''', usually shortened to '''PE''') is a [[thermoplastic]]. It is used in consumer goods, typical examples are [[transport wrap]]s, and [[garbage bag]]s. Other uses include pre-fabricated plastic parts, plastic tubes, and insulation of electric cables.  
 
 Polyethylene [[plastic wrap]] is usually less adhesive than [[Polyvinyl chloride]], but this can be remedied by adding linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which also increases the film's tensile strength. The world makes over 80 million tonnes of polyethylene per year. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/polymers/polyethene.html|title=Poly(ethene) (Polyethylene)|last=Lazonby|first=John|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-gb}} < /ref >
