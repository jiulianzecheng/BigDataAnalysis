 A '''corvette''' is a small, manageable and lightly armed [[war ship]]. During the [[Age of the Sail]], corvettes were smaller than frigates and larger than [[sloop-of-war|sloops-of-war]], they had normally a single gun deck. Almost all the modern [[Navy|navies]] use ships smaller than frigates for coastal duty, but not all of them use the term ''corvette'' (from the French ''corvair'') or equivalent.
