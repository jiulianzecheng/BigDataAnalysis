 The '''Riverina''' ({{pron-en|rɪvəˈriːnə}}) < ref > ''Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition'' (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|1-876429-14-3}} < /ref >  is a large farming area in the south west of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It has flat plains, warm to hot climate and a large supply of water for [[irrigation]]. This has allowed the Riverina to become one of the most productive and agriculturally varied areas of Australia. With the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to the south, and the mountains of the [[Great Dividing Range]] to the east, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] river systems. 
 
 The Riverina has been home to [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] groups for over 40,000 years. It was first settled by [[Europe]]ns in the mid-[[19th century]] as a [[grazing|pastoral]] region growing [[beef]] and [[wool]] for markets in Australia and overseas. In the [[20th century]], the building of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as [[rice]] and [[grape]]s. The Riverina has strong links to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the push behind the [[federation of Australia]]n colonies. 
 
 The major cities and towns in the Riverina include [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]]. Albury and Wagga Wagga are home to campuses of [[Charles Sturt University]]. Wagga Wagga is home to two major [[Australian Defence Force]] bases.

 The area of the Riverina region is not fixed, but it usually includes the farming and [[grazing|pastoral]] areas of New South Wales, west of the [[Great Dividing Range]] and in the [[drainage basin]] of the snow-fed [[Murray River|Murray]] and [[Murrumbidgee River]]s. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.maps.com.au/PDFS/Maps/riverina/RiverinaReg.pdf |title=Riverina Region Map (pdf) |access-date=2010-03-08 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717152845/http://www.maps.com.au/PDFS/Maps/riverina/RiverinaReg.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The north edge of the Riverina is the [[Lachlan River]] catchment area known as the [[Central West, New South Wales|Central West]]. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina border is the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. West of where the Murray and Murrumbidgee meet, is the beginning of the drier [[Far West, New South Wales|Far West]] region. 
 
 In general, the Riverina is an [[alluvial]] [[plain]] formed by soil carried from the [[Great Dividing Range]] by streams between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago. < ref name= " Landform " > {{cite web | url = http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Riverina+-+landform | title = Riverina - Landform | publisher = National Parks and Wildlife Service, New South Wales | accessdate = 2007-01-31 | archive-date = 2006-09-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911212237/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Riverina+-+landform | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  The landscape includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than {{convert|200|m|ft|}} above sea level. The western Riverina is mainly flat [[saltbush]] plain.

 The [[geology]] of the Riverina has several [[trough (geology)|troughs]] and [[sedimentary basin]]s. The western Riverina is thought to be the end of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone. The eastern part is over the top of the western part of the [[Lachlan Fold Belt]]. It is possible that the Riverina has [[mineral]] deposits including [[coal]], [[petroleum]], coal seam [[methane]], [[gypsum]], gold, [[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]] style [[polymetal]]lic systems, heavy [[mineral sands]] and possibly [[diamond]]s in these fold belt rocks and basins. < ref name= " Landform " / > < ref > {{cite web | url = http://minerals.nsw.gov.au/geology/resource_geoscience?p=1366 | title = Riverina Western Regional Assessment | publisher = New South Wales Department of Primary Industries | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | archive-date = 2006-10-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004105756/http://www.minerals.nsw.gov.au/geology/resource_geoscience?p=1366 | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Riverina soils are generally sandy along the rivers, with more [[soil salination|saline]] grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the edge of the [[floodplain]]. As the Murrumbidgee flows downstream, the water and soil become more saline. < ref name= " Landform " / > 
 
 The Riverina is drained by the large [[Murray-Darling Basin]]. Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west. As well as the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, other streams include [[Billabong Creek]] and the [[Edward River]], an [[anabranch]] of the Murray. Much of the water carried by these streams is taken out for other uses. In 2001–2002, 52% of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water was taken, with 77% of that water used for [[irrigation]]. < ref name= " CSIROirrigation " > {{cite web | last = Meyer | first = Wayne | year = 2005 | url = http://www.clw.csiro.au/publications/consultancy/2005/irrigation-industry-murray-CRCIF.pdf | title = The Irrigation Industry in the Murray and Murrumbidgee Basins | format = PDF | work = CRC for Irrigation Futures Technical Report No. 03/05 | publisher = CRC for Irrigation Futures | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | archive-date = 2006-09-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060918200301/http://www.clw.csiro.au/publications/consultancy/2005/irrigation-industry-murray-CRCIF.pdf | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
