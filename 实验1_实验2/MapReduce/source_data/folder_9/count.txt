A '''count''' is a [[nobleman]] in most of [[Europe]]an countries, equivalent in rank to a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[earl]], whose wife is also still a  " countess "  (for lack of an Anglo-Saxon term). The word ''count'' comes from [[French language|French]] ''comte'' which in turn comes from the Latin ''comitas'',  " companion "  (of the [[emperor]]). In [[feudalism]] the territory ruled by a count was a [[county]]. 
 
 A woman having this title or the wife of a count is called '''countess'''.
