 '''Jābir ibn Ḥayyān''' ({{Lang-ar|جابر بن حيان}}; {{Lang-la|'''Geber'''}}; [[died]] between 806 and 816), < ref > {{harvnb|Delva|2017|pp=36−37, note 6}}. < /ref >  is the name for the writer of a great number of writings in Arabic. The writings together have the name '''Jabirian corpus'''. < ref > {{harvnb|Plessner|1981}}; {{harvnb|Forster|2018}}. < /ref >  The most important subjects of these writings are: [[alchemy]], [[cosmology]], [[numerology]], [[astrology]], [[medicine]], [[magic]], [[mysticism]], and [[philosophy]]. 
 
 Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of [[chemical substances]]. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance ([[ammonium chloride]]) from [[Organic compound|organic substances]] (such as plants, blood, and hair). < ref > {{harvnb|Stapleton|Azo|Hidayat Husain|1927|pp=338-340}}; {{harvnb|Kraus|1942–1943|loc=vol. II, pp. 41–42}}. < /ref > 
 
 Modern [[scholars]] doubt the [[historical]] existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a [[pseudonym]] that a group of writers used. < ref > {{harvnb|Delva|2017}}; {{harvnb|Forster|2018}}. < /ref > 
 
 [[Translation|Translations]] into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the  " Book of Mercy " , and the  " Book of Seventy " ) came into existence in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Latin, Jabir had the name  " Geber " , a [[transliteration]] of  " Jabir " . < ref > {{harvnb|Forster|2018}}. < /ref > 
 
 In 13th-century Europe an [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] writer, called pseudo-Geber, started to produce new writings about alchemy under the name Geber. < ref > {{harvnb|Newman|1985}}. < /ref >  People still read the {{Lang-la|Summa perfectionis magisterii|label=none}} in the 17th century. The ''{{Lang-la|Summa perfectionis magisterii|label=none}}'' was one of the writings that pseudo-Geber produced in the 13th century. It was an [[influence]] on [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] chemists like [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691). < ref > {{harvnb|Newman|2006}}. < /ref >
