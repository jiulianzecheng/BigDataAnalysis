 '''Jacob''' is a figure in the [[Abrahamic religion]]s. He was a [[patriarch]] of the Hebrew people, as told in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the [[New Testament]] and the [[Qur'an]]. He was the [[ancestor]] of the [[Israelites|tribes of Israel]], which were named after his male children. He had 13 children, 12 sons and a daughter.  
 
 Jacob had an older brother, [[Esau]]. His mother was named [[Rebecca]] and his father named [[Isaac]]. According to the [[Talmud]], immediately after Abraham died, Jacob prepared a [[lentil]] stew as a traditional mourner's meal for his father. < ref > [[Bava Batra]] 16b. < /ref >  The Hebrew Bible says that Esau, who was very hungry, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew. (Esau called the dish,  " that red, red stuff " , which is why he is called Edom, {{lang-he|אדום}} (''`Edom'', meaning  " Red " ).) Jacob said,  " If you give me your birthright I will give you some stew. "  Esau agreed. < ref > {{bibleverse||Genesis|25:29-34}} < /ref >  Soon, Issac became almost blind. Rebecca tricked Issac into giving Jacob the blessing. Jacob's brother got angry, so Rebecca sent Jacob away. 
 
 Jacob works for his uncle Laban so he can marry his daughter [[Rachel]]. But he is tricked into marrying [[Leah]], her older sister as well. He has children with both women, and with their [[concubine]]s. 
 
 He is very upset when his son [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] is sold into [[slavery]] in [[Egypt]] by his brothers. Jacob moves to [[Egypt]] when there is a famine. He dies and is buried in [[Canaan]].
