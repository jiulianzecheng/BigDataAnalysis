Letterland is a unique [[phonics]]-based approach to teaching reading, writing and spelling to 3-to-8-year-olds. Its information-rich characters known as Letterlanders who live in an imaginary place called Letterland transform from plain, black letters into child-friendly [[pictogram]]s and back. 
 
 By translating the full range of dry phonic facts into engaging stories, children are motivated to listen to think and to learn. These stories explain letter shapes and sounds and quickly develop into word building, reading and writing.
