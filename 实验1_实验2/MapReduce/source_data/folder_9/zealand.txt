 '''Zealand''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Sjælland'') is an [[island]] in the eastern part of [[Denmark]]. It is just west of [[Sweden]] and a [[strait]] called the [[Øresund]] lies between the two. It has an area of 7,031 km² and is the largest island in the country. 
 
 About 2,268,000 people were living in Zealand as of 2016. Most of these people live in and around [[Copenhagen]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of Denmark, which is on the eastern shore of Zealand. 
 
 A number of [[Bridge|bridges]] and [[Tunnel|tunnels]] link Zealand to other parts of Denmark. They include: 
 * the [[Great Belt Bridge]], which links Zealand to [[Funen]], an island to the west. 
 * the [[Storstrøm Bridge]], which links Zealand to [[Lolland]], an island to the south. 
 * the [[Øresund Bridge]], which links Zealand (actually the island of [[Amager]]) to Sweden to the east, near [[Malmö]].
