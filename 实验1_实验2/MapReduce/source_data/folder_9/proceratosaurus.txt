 '''''Proceratosaurus''''' was a small [[dinosaur]] from the [[Middle Jurassic]], about 165 million [[year]]s ago. It was found in [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], in 1910. It was a  [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[theropod]]. 
 
 ''Proceratosaurus'' was first believed to be an early [[ancestor]] of ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= [https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7/page/n318 114]|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >  but it was actually an ancestor of the [[coelurosaur]]s. Thus, it was an early ancestor of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and its relatives in the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. < ref > Holtz, Thomas 1998. A new phylogeny of the carnivorous dinosaurs.
