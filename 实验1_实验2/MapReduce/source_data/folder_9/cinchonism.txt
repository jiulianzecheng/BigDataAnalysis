'''Cinchonism''' or '''quinism''' is poisoning from an overdose of cinchona alkaloids. [[Cinchona]] bark is the source of [[quinine]] and [[quindine]]. Quinine is used to treat [[malaria]]. In small amounts it is used in [[tonic water]] to give a bitter flavor. Cinchoism can be caused by medical doses of quinine or quindine.
