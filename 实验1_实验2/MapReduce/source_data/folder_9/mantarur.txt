 '''Mantarur''' is a hilly area in the southwest of the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]]. It forms the southeastern end of the [[Olia Chain]] of mountains. This outcrop includes '''Butler's Dome''' ({{lang-pjt|Utanta}}; 1102 & nbsp;[[metre]]s [[above sea level]]). The [[granite]] escarpment called '''Foster's Cliff''' is nearby to the east. < ref > {{cite web|title=Foster Cliff Granite|url=http://dbforms.ga.gov.au/pls/www/geodx.strat_units.def?strno=33651 & stratname=Foster%20Cliff%20Granite|work=Stratigraphic Units Database|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=15 April 2013|author=Geoscience Australia}} < /ref >  Mantarur is located about {{convert|80|km}} southwest of [[Kata Tjuá¹¯a]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Mantarur|url=http://www.bushtel.nt.gov.au/northern_territory/region3/shire_id13/community_display?comm_num=98|work=Bushtel|publisher=Northern Territory Government|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >  It is on [[Pitjantjatjara]] land, part of the [[Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust]].

 Frank Rees George led a [[prospecting]] [[expedition]] through the area between 1905 and 1906. George gave names to several of the landforms, including Butler's Dome, which is believed to have been named after Richard Butler, who was a minister of South Australia. < ref > {{cite web|title=Butler Dome|url=http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/placenames/view.jsp?id=11441|work=Northern Territory Place Names Register|publisher=Government of the Northern Territory|accessdate=15 April 2013}} < /ref >  He named Foster's Cliff after R.
