 A '''hippie''' (sometimes spelled as '''hippy''') is a [[label]] for a person of a particular [[counterculture]] that started in the [[United States]] and spread to other countries in the [[1960s]].  
 
 Hippies have their own opinions on [[drug|drugs]], [[Sexual revolution|sexual liberation]], and [[women's rights]].  
 
 == History == 
 The first people to be called  " hippies "  were young adults and [[teenager]]s in the 1960s who grew out of the [[beatnik]] movement. These people were supporters of [[civil rights]] for [[African-American]]s in the [[Southern USA]]. They soon developed their own [[music]] scene in neighborhoods in [[New York City]] ([[Greenwich Village]]) and [[San Francisco]] ([[Haight-Ashbury]]). They were also strongly against the [[Vietnam War]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, and what they called the  " [[Establishment]] "  (this was a word for [[mainstream]] [[society]]). They were also against the  " military-industrial complex " . This phrase was taken from a warning in the farewell speech of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1961. 
 
 Many more people began to see hippies in the news after the [[Human Be-In]] (January 1967) and the 1967  " [[Summer of Love]] "  were held in San Francisco. By this time, they had developed their own lifestyle that included [[psychedelic]] styles, drug use, usually some amount of travel, and much longer hair than other people. These styles quickly spread across the country, especially to [[college]] campuses where students were protesting President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s policies in Vietnam, the [[assassination]] of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in 1968, and other events. They also spread to the [[UK]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]] < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1223761|title=Pakistan's contrary years (1971-1977): A cultural history of the Bhutto era|work=Nadeem Paracha|publisher=Dawn News}} < /ref >  and [[Canada]], among other places.  
 
 In 1968 many more Americans turned against the war following the [[Tet Offensive]], King was shot, and [[politician]]s began to get ready for the [[election]] for President in November. Many colleges were shut down by students, and people burned their [[draft]] cards at public rallies. A group of radical hippies called the [[Yippies]], led by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], led a huge protest during the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in [[Chicago]], where they tried to run a [[pig]] called [[Pigasus]] as a [[candidate]] for President. The [[mayor]] responded by sending in [[riot]] [[police]] who beat people up in front of [[news]] [[cameras]]. The riot police even beat the cameramen, reporters, and other innocent people. This was shown on the news, and many programs and [[television]] stations began to feel more sympathetic to the hippies for a while. This made hippie lifestyle much more mainstream through the early seventies.  
 
 In 1969, [[Richard Nixon]] succeeded Johnson as President, and protests continued — not just against the war, but against the [[court]] [[trial]]s and hearings of the Yippie leaders who became known as  " the [[Chicago Seven]] "  (originally  " Chicago Eight " ). Also in that year, a huge [[rock music|rock]] concert was held in [[Bethel]], [[New York (state)|New York]] — the three day [[Woodstock Festival]]. At this festival, 500,000 hippies and music fans heard some of the most famous singers and groups of the time. The people there also did things like nude swimming, mud-sliding, rain-dancing and mass tribal chants. They did this to show their freedom to the world.  
 
 Late that year, a murderer named [[Charles Manson]] who posed as a hippie killed several people. Because some people blamed hippies for this, the term began to fall a little out of fashion in 1970, even if the fashions themselves did not. A new type of [[hard rock]] called [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] was developing out of one style of hippie music. A band called [[Led Zeppelin]] took the number one spot for most popular band of the year in 1970, which had been held by the [[Beatles]] for eight years. Also that year, when students at [[Kent State University]] in [[Ohio]] were protesting Nixon's spread of bombing to [[Laos]], the [[National Guard]] shot at them, and four were killed. This had a chilling effect on the hippies and the whole country, but the peace movement continued. In 1973, the draft was ended, and the war ended soon after that. US public attention turned to the [[Watergate]] scandal. After this, hippies never again had the attention they once did, though the lifestyle continued, especially in other countries. In the mid-seventies, trends like [[punk]]s and [[disco]] were also spreading, causing the hippie image to fade in the [[media]].
