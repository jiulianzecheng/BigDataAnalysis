 " '''Kimigayo''' "  ([[Kanji]]: 君が代, [[Katakana]]: きみがよ, {{small|say: {{respell|kee-mee-GAH-joh}}}}, meaning  " His Imperial Majesty's Reign " ) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Japan]]. < ref > Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs  (MOFA), [http://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/11NFlagAnthem.pdf  ''Japan Fact Sheet'', pp. 2-4]; retrieved 2011-12-23. < /ref >  The anthem is based on a [[poem]] written by an unknown poet from Japan about one thousand years ago. The [[music]] was composed more recently, about two hundred years ago; however, it had to be rewritten shortly afterwards, because the original tune was unpopular. 
 
 Although popular for a long period and sung in situations where people from other [[country|countries]] would usually sing their country's national anthem,  " Kimigayo "  was only considered as Japan's official national anthem in 1999. The [[law]] that stated this also defined the [[Flag of Japan]] in a similar way.

 The national anthem of Japan is one of the shortest national anthems in the [[world]], containing only thirty-two [[syllable]]s. Because it is so short, the anthem is normally played very slowly.
