 The '''Antiarchi'''  < ref > " Opposite anus " < /ref >  is an [[order (biology)|order]] of heavily armored [[placoderm]]s. The antiarchs were the second-most successful group of placoderms (after the [[arthrodire]]s) in terms of numbers of [[species]] and range of environments.   
 
 The front part of their bodies were heavily [[armour]]ed. The rear parts were sometimes [[scale (zoology)|scaled]], sometimes naked. The [[pectoral fin]]s were modified.  In primitive forms, such as ''[[Yunnanolepis]]'', the limbs were thick and short, while in advanced forms, such as ''[[Bothriolepis]]'', the limbs were long and had elbow-like joints. Probably they helped the fish pull themselves across the [[substrate]], or allow their owners to bury themselves into the substrate.
