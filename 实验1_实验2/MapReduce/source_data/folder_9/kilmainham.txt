'''Kilmainham''' (In Irish: ''Cill Mhaighneann'',  " St Maighnenn's church " ) is an area of [[Dublin]]. It lies south of the [[River Liffey]] and west of the city centre in the Dublin 8 [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]].  
 
 ==History== 
 In the [[Viking Age|Viking era]], there was a monastery here. The monastery was home to the first Norse base (''longphort'') in Ireland. < ref > Halsall, Guy. ''Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West, 450-900'' (London:  Routledge, 2003), p.156. < /ref > 
 
 In the 12th century the lands on the banks of the Liffey belonged to the [[Knights Templars]]. [[Strongbow]] built a castle for them, about a mile away from the Danish wall of old Dublin. Here the Templars lived for nearly a century and a half. In 1308, [[King Edward II of England|Edward II]] ruled that they were no longer allowed to practice their religion. Thirty members of the Templars were imprisoned in Dublin. Their lands and rights were given to the priory of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John of Jerusalem]]. They were there until the monasteries were closed in the 16th century. < ref name=harris > [[Walter Harris (historian)|Walter Harris]]: The History and Antiquities of the City of Dublin < /ref >   
 
 The [[Manor of Kilmainham]] was a [[The Liberties|liberty]]. This means it had special rights.  " The manor "  was an area that included parts of James's Street and side-streets and went as far as [[Lucan]] and [[Chapelizod]]. < ref > D'Alton: History of the County Dublin. 1838. p. 301 < /ref >   
 
 Until the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], the [[lord lieutenant]]s used the manor of Kilmainham. In 1559, the earl of Sussex, found that the building at Kilmainham was damaged by a storm. The following year Elizabeth ordered that Dublin Castle be improved so the lord lieutenant could live there. From that time, Kilmainham was no longer used much. < ref name=harris/ >

 The [[Royal Hospital Kilmainham]] is in Kilmainham. It was built on the site where the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John of Jerusalem]] had their priory in Dublin. It is now the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]]. Nearby is also [[Kilmainham Gaol]], where the executions of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]] took place.  
 
 Kilmainham also has one of a small number of [[Viking era]] burial sites ([[Old Norse]] ''haugr'' meaning barrow or mound), within Dublin.
