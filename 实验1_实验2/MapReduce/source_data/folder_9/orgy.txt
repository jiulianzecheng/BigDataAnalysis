 In common use, an '''orgy''' is when more than two people have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] together, sometimes also called '''group sex'''. 
 This dates back to prehistoric ages, recorded in many ancient civilizations.  
 
 ''Orgy'' could also mean any activity done without limits. 
 
 Originally, the word comes from [[Latin]]. There it referred to a [[meal|feast]] (or a banquet) of a rich citizen. When the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] ate they were almost lying down, and the food was brought to them by [[slave]]s. These slaves would also provide the entertainment which usually consisted of [[music]] and [[dance|dancing]] slaves.
