 == History == 
 The Seminole Nation began in the 18th century, when many groups of Native Americans came together in Florida. Much of Seminole culture comes from the [[Muscogee]] (Creek) people from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]], who made up a large part of the Seminole Nation when it was formed. The name  " Seminole "  comes the word for  " runaway "  in the Muscogee language, which many Seminole people spoke. 
 
 The Seminole developed an independent identity over a period of time in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time they traded with British and Spanish [[Colonist|colonists]] who were living in Florida. Many free blacks and escaped [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] settled near Seminole land and paid tributes to the Seminole tribe. These people later became known as  " [[Black Seminoles]]. " 
 
 After the [[American Revolutionary War]], many Americans tried to move into Seminole land. This created conflict leading to the Seminole Wars (1818-1858).
