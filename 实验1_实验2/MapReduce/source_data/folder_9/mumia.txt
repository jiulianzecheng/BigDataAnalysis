 '''Mumia''' (also '''pulvis mumiae''', '''Mumia vera aegyptiaca''') was a [[powder]] made from ground [[mummification|mummies]]. It was used as a [[drug]], for good [[health]], and as a [[color]]ing agent (a medium to dark brown) until the [[1920s]]. Eating ground mumified [[corpse]]s is a form of [[cannibalism]]. 
 
 The powder was said to work against almost any [[disease]]. To mummify a corpse, [[tar]] was used. It was said this tar had [[magical]] powers. It was also said to be an [[aphrodisiac]].
