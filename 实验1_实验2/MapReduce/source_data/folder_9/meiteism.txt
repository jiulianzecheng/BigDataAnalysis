 Though Meiteism is treated as another name of [[Sanamahism]], the later term has wider coverage of the traditional beliefs and practices of the hill tribesman communities also. The term was used during the Meitei revivalism movement to promote the ethnic religion of the [[Meitei people]] explicitly. < ref name= " hNALAAAAIAAJ " / >
