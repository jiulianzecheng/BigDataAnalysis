 A '''beach''' is a [[landform]] along the [[coast]] of an [[ocean]], [[sea]], [[lake]], or [[river]]. It usually consists of loose particles, such as [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[shingle beach|shingle]], or [[pebble]]s. The particles of a beach are sometimes biological in origin, such as [[mollusc]] [[shell (zoology)|shells]] or bits of [[coral]] and sometimes bits of [[igneous rock]], but the most common mineral in beaches is [[quartz]]. 
 
 Beaches are natural landing and launching places for [[boat]]s, and [[landing craft]] are specially made for beaches. 
 
 People often use beaches for [[recreation]]. They [[swimming|swim]], bask in the sun, or just relax. The most popular beaches have fine white or light-colored sand and warm water to swim in. Beaches are also used for [[diving]] or for seeing [[marine life]]. 
 
 Among the world's most popular and well-known beaches are [[Aruba]] (Dutch Caribbean), Long Beach ([[Canada]]), Copacabana Beach ([[Brazil]]), Hot Water Beach ([[New Zealand]]), Megan Bay ([[St. Thomas]]), Kailua Beach ([[Hawaii]]), Zandvoort Beach ([[Netherlands]]), Jeffreys Bay ([[South Africa]]), Bondi Beach ([[Australia]]) and [[Lake Como beaches]] (Italy). 
 
 Taking holidays on the beach is something of a British cultural export. Early [[railways]] in the 19th century took people to places they had never seen before. This [[tourism]] was made possible by the [[industrial revolution]]. Whole [[seaside resort]] towns grew to support visitors, where before there were just villages. Vacations at the sea became common all over the world. < ref > [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Sea/articles/walton.html Walton, John K. 2005.

 Beaches are never static. They are always being built up or [[erosion|eroded]], more quickly than other landforms. Over time the boundary between the land and the sea changes. [[New Romney]], a small town in [[Kent]], is one of the [[Cinque Ports]], a mile from the sea. In [[Henry VIII]]'s time it was a port on the south coast of England. The growth of [[Dungeness]] has cut it off from the sea. Dungeness is a huge [[shingle beach]].
