 The '''arapaima''', '''pirarucu''', or '''paiche''' are several large [[species]] of [[bonytongue]] fish in the [[genus]] '''''Arapaima'''''.  
 
 They are native to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] basins of South America.   
 These fish are widely dispersed and do not [[Migration|migrate]].  This makes scientists think that there are more species of arapaima that scientists have not found yet.  < ref > Arantes, Caroline C., Leandro Castello, Mauricio Cetra, and Ana Schilling.  " Environmental
