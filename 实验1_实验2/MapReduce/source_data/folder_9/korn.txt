 '''Korn''' (sometimes written as '''KoЯn''' to fit their logo) is an American [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[nu metal]] and [[alternative metal]] band from Bakersfield, [[California]]. 
 
 The band was first called 'Creep' and had another singer. 
 
 People often say they created the [[nu metal]] genre. < ref name= " Rock Star Magazine " > {{cite web | title=Rock Star Magazine | url=http://korn.simpol.net/i/rockstarjonathandavis.jpg}} < /ref >  Along with other bands of the time, they were influences for a wave of [[nu metal]], [[alternative metal]] and [[rap metal]] bands through the mid 1990s and early 2000s, helping [[Limp Bizkit]] (who were discovered by Korn themselves) and [[Slipknot]] more than other bands. Despite this, Korn have been quoted for disliking the term and even being called 'metal'. Jonathan Davis has said that Korn's music can not be classified and that it contains many other influences besides simply 'metal'. The official review on the [[iTunes Store]] for their first album goes as far as saying that Korn  " hate the term " . 
 
 Their first album was first sold in [[1994]] and also called KoRn. Since then, Korn has sold over 35 millions records worldwide - including 16,5 millions in the U.S., making them one of the best-selling metal acts of the last twelve years. < ref name= " www.showtimetickets.com " > {{cite web | title=www.showtimetickets.com | work= Mention of sales | url=http://www.showtimetickets.com/concerts/rock-pop/korn.jsp}} < /ref >  The band's catalogue consists of seven platinum studio albums in a row, one platinum compilation album, and seven consecutive debuts (including ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume 1 (Korn album)|Greatest Hits, Volume 1]]'' compilation album) in top 10 of [[Billboard Top 200]] best selling albums. Korn has been selected for 6 [[Grammy]]s, and won 2 such awards. 8 of their albums has been awarded as multi-platinum, despite only part of them being on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]].
