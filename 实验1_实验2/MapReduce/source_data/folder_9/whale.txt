 '''Whales''' are a group of [[cetacea]]n [[mammal]]s that live in the ocean. Like other mammals, they breathe [[oxygen]] from the [[air]], have a small amount of [[hair]], and are [[Temperature regulation|warm blooded]]. 
 
 There are two basic kinds of whales, and about 100 [[species]]. < ref > Mead, James G. and Brownell, Robert L. Jr. 2005. Order Cetacea (pp. 723-743). In Wilson, Don E. and Reeder, DeeAnn M. (eds) ''Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference''. 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2 vols. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8221-0}}. OCLC 62265494 < /ref > 
 
 People use the word ''whale'' in different ways.  Some use it for all [[Cetacea]]ns including [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.  These people say that dolphins and porpoises are also whales, because they are also Cetaceans.  Others separate out the dolphins and porpoises: common English-speaking people have never called them or thought of them as whales unless they are very large.  Actually, there is no clear line between whales and dolphins. 
 
 Whales have been killed for meat and oil by [[whaler]]s.  However, many countries have [[laws]] saying not to [[whaling|kill whales]] anymore.  Some countries, such as [[Iceland]] and [[Japan]], do not have these laws.  In other countries, such as the [[USA]], only [[Eskimo]]s and some [[American Indian]]s may legally kill whales such as the [[blue whale]] and [[beluga whale]]. 
 
 == Diet == 
 [[Mysticeti|Baleen whales]] eat [[plankton]] and [[krill]]. Plankton are clouds of very small fish floating in the water. The whales' mouths are very large. They open their mouths very wide and hold a big mouthful of sea water. Their throats stretch very wide to make the space inside their mouth even bigger. Then they close their mouth and squeeze out the seawater. The food does not escape because, instead of [[teeth]], these whales have filters called ''baleen''. Baleen is long, hard strips that act like a strainer. The water goes through the baleen. Animals and plants in the water are trapped and swallowed, while the water goes back out. < ref name=lifepac > {{cite book|last=Buskey|first=Theresa|title=History and Geography|year=1996|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781580956505|editor=Alan Christopherson, M.S.|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|series=L.I.F.E.P.A.C.|isbn=978-1-58095-156-2|accessdate=April 1, 2010|language=English}} < /ref >  This is very different from the way that toothed whales eat. 
 
 [[Toothed whale]]s eat larger fish or meat and are like big dolphins.  They have sharp teeth and usually have a big forehead.  Inside the big forehead is a chamber to make and direct sounds.  They make all kinds of sounds, including sounds so loud they can shock fish.  They can use [[echolocation]] to locate things that they can not see.  Some toothed whales, such as the [[sperm whale]], are almost never called dolphins.  Some of them are always called dolphins.  Others are like dolphins in some ways and like whales in others. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 Cetaceans are divided into two suborders: 
 *The largest suborder, [[Mysticeti]] (baleen whales) are characterized by baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of [[keratin]], which it uses to filter plankton from the water. 
 *[[Odontoceti]] (toothed whales) bear sharp teeth for hunting. Odontoceti also include dolphins and porpoises. 
 
 Both cetaceans and [[artiodactyl]] are now classified under the super-order  [[Cetartiodactyla]], which includes both whales and [[hippopotamuses]]. Whales are the hippopotamus's closest living relatives. < ref name= " physorg " > {{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news2806.html|title=Scientists find missing link between the whale and its closest relative, the hippo|last=Anon|date=25 January 2005|work=PhysOrg.com|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=6 May 2010|archive-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606213938/http://www.physorg.com/news2806.html|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 == Evolution == 
 {{main|Evolution of cetaceans}} 
 All cetaceans, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, are descendants of land-living mammals of the [[Artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed [[ungulate]]s). Both are related to ''[[Indohyus]]'' (an extinct [[semi-aquatic]] deer-like ungulate) from which they split around 54 million years ago. < ref name=science_news > {{cite web| url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm| title = Whales descended from tiny deer-like ancestors| accessdate = 2007-12-21| author = Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy| publisher = ScienceDaily| archive-date = 2015-04-24| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150424061425/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm| url-status = live}} < /ref > < ref name= " Ancestors_Tale " > {{cite book| first = Richard| last = Dawkins| authorlink = Richard Dawkins| title = The Ancestor's Tale: a pilgrimage to the dawn of life| url = https://archive.org/details/ancestorstale00rich_0| publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company| location = Boston| year = 2004| isbn = 0-618-00583-8 }} < /ref >

 Scientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales, and they found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals.  They said this may be why modern whales and extinct diving animals like [[plesiosaurus|plesiosaurs]] became so large. < ref name= " Plymouth " > {{cite press release|author=University of Plymouth|publisher=Eurekalert.org|title=Scientists reveal new fundamental principles governing diving in animals|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/uop-srn052620.php|date=May 26, 2020|accessdate=June 1, 2020|archivedate=June 4, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604163819/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/uop-srn052620.php}} < /ref > < ref name= " Diving " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspb.2020.0488 |publisher=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|title=Universal metabolic constraints shape the evolutionary ecology of diving in animals|date=May 27, 2020|author1=Wilco C.

 == Physiology == 
 Because of where they live (and unlike many animals), whales are conscious breathers: they decide when to breathe. Whales breathe through blowholes. Baleen whales have two and toothed whales have one. These are on the top of the head: the animal breathes while most of their body is underwater. Breathing first shoots out extra water from the blowhole, making a jet into the air, followed by inhaling air into the lungs. 
 
 All mammals sleep, including whales, but they cannot stay in an [[Consciousness|unconscious]] state for too long, because they need to be conscious to breathe. It is thought that only one hemisphere (half) of their brains sleeps at a time, so that whales are never completely asleep, but still get the rest they need. < ref name= " Discovery " > {{cite web|url=http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/question643.htm|title=Do whales and dolphins sleep?|last=Anon|work=How Stuff Works|date=24 May 2001|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=14 February 2010|archive-date=13 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213210819/http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/question643.htm|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Whales are thought to sleep around eight hours a day. 
 
 A baby whale is called a  " calf " . One calf is born every two or three years. [[Gestation]] takes up to a year. Nursing continues for more than a year in many species; there is a strong bond between mother and calf. Reproductive maturity occurs at seven to ten years. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases their chance of surviving. The effect of hunting is severe on these animals, who replace their numbers slowly. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr_blue_whale_e.pdf |title=Blue Whale assessment and status report |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-date=2014-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915084032/http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr%5Fblue%5Fwhale%5Fe%2Epdf |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 == Whale behavior == 
 ===Socialization=== 
 Whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and even grieve. < ref name=wwwu > {{cite web|last=Siebert|first=Charles|title=Watching whales watching us|work=New York Times Magazine|date=July 8, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=August 31, 2017|archive-date=April 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210428042948/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html?pagewanted=all|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 === Breaching === 
 ''Breaching'' is what happens when a whale jumps into the air and then purposefully flops down on the water with a great splash. Sometimes it twirls in the air when it does this. [[Scientist]]s are not sure whether breaching is done to play, to clean the whale's skin of things that are stuck to it, or to tell other whales something. < ref name=emm2 > {{cite book|editor1-last=Perrin|editor1-first=William F.|editor2-last=Wursig|editor2-first=Bernd|editor3-last=Thewissen|editor3-first=J.G.M.|title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals|last=Hooker|first=Sascha K.|edition=2nd|publisher=Academic Press|page=1174|location=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-373553-9|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/716899/description#description|access-date=2011-08-30|archive-date=2009-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109165656/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/716899/description#description|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 There are a number of other behaviors on the surface which are not well understood. < ref > {{Citation|title=Sperm whales: social evolution in the ocean|first=Hal|last=Whitehead|page=181|isbn=0226895173|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKXdCli7nI0C & pg=PA181|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|access-date=2022-02-24|archive-date=2021-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210705104707/https://books.google.com/books?id=TKXdCli7nI0C & pg=PA181|url-status=live}} < /ref >  'Logging' is when a whale swims slowly at the surface of the ocean with very little movement. When a whale does this, it looks like a [[wikt:log|log]] in the water. Some scientists think this is a kind of rest or sleep for whales. 'Spyhopping' is when a whale sits straight up in the water with its head straight up and out of the water. It will sometimes turn around in circles as it spyhops. Some scientists think this might be because whales are trying to see what is happening above water. 'Lobtailing' is done when a whale faces downward in the water. It then slaps the water with a [[thunder]]ous sound. Scientists think this might be done to warn other whales of danger, or as a method of feeding. < ref > {{Citation
