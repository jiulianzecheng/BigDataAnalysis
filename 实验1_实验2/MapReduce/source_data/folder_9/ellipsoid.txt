 An '''ellipsoid''' is a shape like a [[sphere]], but it may be longer in one or more directions, like a [[Rugby football|rugby]] ball. It is the 3 dimensional analogue of an [[ellipse]]. 
 
 The [[Earth]] is shaped slightly like an ellipsoid. Its shape is called an [[oblate spheroid]]. An ellipsoid shaped like the Earth, called a [[reference ellipsoid]], is often preferred to the [[geoid]] because it makes calculations simpler.
