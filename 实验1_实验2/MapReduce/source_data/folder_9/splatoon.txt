 {{nihongo|'''''Splatoon''''' |スプラトゥーン|Supuratūn|lead=yes}} is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]]. It was [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development|Nintendo EAD Group No. 2]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The game was released on May 28, 2015 in [[Japan]], May 29, 2015 in [[Europe]], May 29, 2015 in [[North America]], and on May 30, 2015 in [[Australia]]. It was released for the [[Wii U]]. In ''Splatoon'', the player controls a character called an Inkling. They can change between human and squid forms. The object of the game is to shoot colored ink across the game's map and cover the most territory with their team's color before the match ends. By transforming into a squid, it lets players swim through their own colored ink and can even let the player swim up walls and through grates. Hiding in their own ink recharges the players’ ink supply. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/10/5796790/splatoon-is-nintendos-take-on-third-person-squid-shooters|accessdate=2015-05-31|title=Splatoon is Nintendo's take on third-person squid shooters|date=10 June 2014|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}} < /ref >
