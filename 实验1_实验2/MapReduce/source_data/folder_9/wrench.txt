 A '''wrench''' (or '''spanner''') is a [[tool]] used to provide grip and turn [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[bolt]]s, and similarly shaped objects. 
 
 In [[British English]], ''spanner'' is the standard term. The most common shapes are called ''open-ended spanner'' and ''ring spanner''. The term ''wrench'' is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or may be used for a [[monkey wrench]] – an adjustable spanner. 
 
 What a wrench or spanner does is to grip. Pulling or pushing the handle to rotate gives [[mechanical advantage]]. It applies [[torque]] to turn objects – usually rotary [[fastener]]s, such as nuts and bolts – or keep them from turning. 
 
 == Adjustable wrenches == 
 An adjustable spanner, or [[adjustable wrench]], or crescent wrench in [[American English]], is a [[tool]]. It may move its jaw to rotate nuts or bolts of different sizes. It was [[invented]] by [[Edwin Beard Budding]] (1795–1846), who also invented the [[lawnmower]].
