 '''Planning''' is the way most [[organization]]s work to do big [[project]]s. It is [[Thought|thinking]] about what needs to happen, and then making a [[wikt:detail|detailed]] [[wikt:plan|plan]]. It may include a [[schedule]]. 
 
 All humans plan to some extent: it is a fundamental property of [[intelligence|intelligent behaviour]]. In big organisations and [[government]] planning is a main activity. It combines [[forecasting]]  developments with [[scenario]]s of how to react to them. 
 
 Forecasting is predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future ''should'' look like. < ref > [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php?option=com_content & task=view & id=3 & Itemid=3#field_2 How does forecasting relate to planning?] ForecastingPrinciples.com < /ref > 
 
 The  " nuts and bolts "  of planning are the [[document]]s, [[diagram]]s, and [[meeting]]s, the [[wikt:objective|objectives]] and the [[strategy]] to be followed. Beyond this, planning has a different meaning depending on the [[wikt:context|context]] in which it is used. 
 
 The [[wikt:counterpart|counterpart]] to planning is [[self-organization]], when [[wikt:order|order]] emerges [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneously]] out of seeming [[wiktionary:chaos|chaos]].
