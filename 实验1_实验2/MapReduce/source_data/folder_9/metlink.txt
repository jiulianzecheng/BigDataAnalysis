 '''Metlink''' is the [[marketing]] name  for all [[public transport]] operators' in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. 
 
 == Introduction == 
 The ''Metlink'' brand was introduced in [[2003]]. 
 
 Under the new branding, railway station signage and timetables are colour-coded ''' < span style= " color:blue; " > blue < /span > ''', tram stop signs and timetables are ''' < span style= " color:lime; " > green < /span > ''', and the bus network is ''' < span style= " color:orange; " > orange < /span > '''. The regional train network is colour-coded ''' < span style= " color:purple; " > purple < /span > '''. 
 
 == Future role == 
 
 Metlink has also been active in the use of 'value Metcards' (like credit cards but work only for trains) and is known for running a  " funny "  campaign called BATBYGOBSTOPL (Buying A Ticket Before You Get On Board Saves Time Or Problems Later).  In July 2007, Metlink launched a new campaign,  " I Highly Recommend You Get on the Bus " , featuring musical comedian [[Frank Woodley]], to improve bus services.

 While they do not have control, representatives of the Bus Association of Victoria and [[V/Line]] have helped Metlink. 
 
 ==Viclink== 
 Victoria's regional bus and rail services will at some future date be brought under a similar brand to Metlink named '''Viclink'''. Signage upgrades at regional railway stations have started from [[October]] [[2006]] [http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11323361.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212194904/http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11323361.htm |date=2007-12-12 }}. The signage will be fully implemented when [[V/Line]] is re-privatized following the completion of the Fast Rail project{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.
