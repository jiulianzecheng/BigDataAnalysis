 '''Aruba''' is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], just north of the [[Venezuela]]n [[Paraguaná Peninsula]]. It is in the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Unlike much of the Caribbean region, it has a dry climate and an arid, cactus-strewn landscape.  This climate has helped tourism, because visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather. 
 
 The island broke off from the [[Netherlands Antilles]] in 1986, hoping to gain its [[independence]] by 1996. In 1990, that effort stopped at the request of the island people. 
 
 Aruba is one of the four countries that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The other nations are the [[Netherlands]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]. The citizens of these countries all share a single nationality: Dutch.  
 
 About three quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism or related activities. < ref name= " CIA " > {{cite web|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=12 October 2016|archive-date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The island came into the news after U.S. [[high school]] student [[Natalee Holloway]] [[missing person|disappeared]] on a [[graduation]] trip on May 30, 2005. Today, some refer to Aruba as  " One Happy Island " . < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/one-happy-island/|title=The world's happiest island|date=2016-09-30|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2020-07-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}} < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 Aruba is a generally flat, riverless island. It is in the southern part of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The western and southern beaches have white sandy beaches. They are generally protected from the ocean currents. This is one of the reasons Aruba is a popular tourist location.  
 
 Together with [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], Aruba forms a group referred to as the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the [[Dutch Caribbean]]. 
 
 Aruba has no administrative subdivisions. For [[census]] purposes, it is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]. 
 
 == People == 
 The Aruba population is about 75% mixed, 15% black, and 10% white. The first inhabitants of Aruba were the Caiquetio Indians of the Arawak tribe from [[Venezuela]]. < ref >  https://www.aruba.com/us/our-island/history-and-culture/history < /ref >
