 A '''pattern''' is an [[idea]], a [[concept]] or a [[model]]. The model is usually abstract, and can then be applied to the domain where it is used. [[Pattern matching]] is checking if a certain pattern is present. Many patterns can directly be recognised by the [[sense]]s.  
 
 Some patterns are based on the fact that there are [[repetition]]s, that a certain thing occurs over and over again. An example of a simple pattern might be the tiling of a floor. For example, lots of bathrooms have a paisley or floral tiling pattern on the floor. In [[computer science]], [[design pattern]]s are model solutions for problems that occur often. Sometimes people see patterns when there are none. This is called [[pareidolia]]. 
 
 == Mathematical patterns == 
 In [[Mathematics]], there are many different patterns. For example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is a complex type of pattern. There are some simple ones like: 
 
 < big > 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... < /big > 
 
 In this pattern, the next number is the product of the previous number [[multiplication|multiplied]] by 2. Basically a mathematical pattern is a sequence of numbers which follows one rule.
