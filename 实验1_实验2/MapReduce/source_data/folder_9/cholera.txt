 There are many types (strains) of the ''Vibrio cholera'' bacteria.  Some of them cause more serious illnesses than others.  Because of this, some people who get cholera have no [[symptom]]s; others have symptoms that are not very bad, and others have very bad symptoms. < ref name= " CDC2015Pro " > {{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/healthprofessionals.html|title=Cholera - Vibrio cholerae infection Information for Public Health  &  Medical Professionals|date=September 7, 2018|website=cdc.gov|publisher=United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}} < /ref >

 ==Cause== 
 People usually get cholera by eating food or drinking water that is unclean.  When people have cholera, they have a lot of diarrhea, and the cholera bacteria stays alive in their [[feces]].  In developing countries, often there is not good [[sanitation]].  Cholera can spread if this diarrhea gets into water that other people use. < ref name= " Sherris " > {{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi0000unse_q1i3|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9|editor-last=Ryan KJ|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi0000unse_q1i3/page/376 376]–7|editor-last2=Ray CG}} < /ref >   For example, if [[sewage]] (human waste) gets into a [[river]], people can get cholera if they:

 Cholera is very rarely spread directly from person to person. < ref name=Lancet2004/ > 
 
 == Signs and symptoms == 
 [[File:Cholera feces.jpg|thumb|Diarrhea during cholera often looks like  " rice water " .]] 
 Cholera's main symptoms are bad [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] clear [[fluid]]. < ref name=Lancet2004/ >   These symptoms usually start suddenly.  They start half a day to five days after the person gets infected.  (This is called cholera's  " [[incubation period]] " .) < ref > {{cite journal | author = Azman AS, Rudolph KE | display-authors = etal|date= 2012 | title = The incubation period of cholera: A systematic review | journal = Journal of Infection | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 432–438 | pmid = 23201968 | pmc = 3677557 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2012.11.013 | url =  }} < /ref > 
 
 If they do not get [[treatment]], about half of people with serious cholera die. < ref name=Lancet2004/ >   People with bad cholera may have so much diarrhea that they do not have enough water and electrolytes (salts) left in their bodies to survive. < ref name=Lancet2004/ >   Cholera has been nicknamed the  " blue death "  because a person dying of cholera may lose so many body fluids that their skin turns bluish-gray. < ref name=McE2009 > {{cite book |last1=McElroy |first1=Ann | last2=Townsend |first2=Patricia K. |date=December 30, 2008 |title=Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective |edition=5th |url= |location=Boulder, Colorado |publisher=Westview Press |page=375 |isbn=978-0813343846}} < /ref > 
 
 Other symptoms may include: < ref name=Lancet2004/ > 
 [[Image:PHIL 1939 lores.jpg|thumb|right|{{Center|A person with severe dehydration from cholera.  He has sunken eyes and saggy skin from dehydration.}}]] 
 * [[Lethargy]] (having no energy) 
 * Eyes that look sunken into the head, dry mouth, and saggy skin (from dehydration)    
 * Changes in [[breathing]] 
 * [[Mental confusion|Confusion]] 
 * [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure) 
 * [[Tachycardia]] (fast heart rate) 
 * [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]] caused by dehydration (called [[hypovolemic shock]]) 
 * [[Seizure]]s (especially in children) 
 * [[Coma]], especially in children 
 
 ==Prognosis== 
 If people with cholera get good, quick medical treatment, less than 1% die from the disease.  However, if cholera is not treated, at least half of people with the disease (50% to 60%) die. < ref name=Lancet2004/ > < ref > {{cite web|author=Todar, Kenneth|title=''Vibrio cholerae'' and Asiatic Cholera|url=http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/cholera.html|publisher=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology|accessdate=January 31, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 Some strains of the ''Vibrio cholera'' bacteria have different [[gene]]s than others, which make them more dangerous.  These more dangerous strains of cholera bacteria caused the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India.  A person who gets these strains of cholera can die within two hours of getting sick. < ref name=Knox2010/ >   This means there is very little time to get the person treated. 
 
 == Treatment == 
 [[Image:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|{{Center|[[Nurse]]s treat a cholera patient in 1992}}]] 
 There are antibiotics for cholera. There are various treatments which can help.  For example: 
 * Giving fluids to treat dehydration, either by mouth or through a needle placed into a [[vein]] (intravenously). < ref name=Lancet2012/ > 
 * Giving important electrolytes like [[potassium]] and [[sodium chloride|sodium chloride (salt)]] < ref name=choleraoutbreaksteps > {{cite web|title=First steps for managing an outbreak of acute diarrhea|url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/publications/en/first_steps.pdf|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] Global Task Force on Cholera Control}}|accessdate=January 31, 2016 < /ref > 
 * Giving [[antibiotic]]s.  These make symptoms go away faster and not be so bad.  However, people may recover without them if they are not too dehydrated. Some advice is that antibiotics are suggested for people who have bad cholera and are dehydrated. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/index.html |title=Cholera - ''Vibrio cholera'' infection |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=November 7, 2014 |website=cdc.gov |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=January 31, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 * Patients should keep eating; this helps their [[intestines]] return to normal. < ref name=WHOTreatmentOfDiarrhoea2005 > {{Cite report |author=[[World Health Organization]] |date=2005 |title=The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A Manual for physicians and other senior health workers |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43209/1/9241593180.pdf |publisher=WHO Press |pages=14, 20–21 |docket= |accessdate=January 31, 2016 |isbn=92-4-159318-0}} < /ref > < ref name=CDCCommunityHealthWorkerTrainingManual > {{Cite report |author=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=November 17, 2010 |title=Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control |url=https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |pages=7–8 |docket= |accessdate=January 31, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 ===Individuals === 
 [[File:A SOIL EkoLakay toilet customer. (15921409131).jpg|thumb|This model of Urine-diverting [[Dry Toilet]] is used by many people in Haiti to fight cholera. It is also an example of Container-based Sanitation because buckets of feces and dry cover material are taken to certain places to be carefully [[compost]] < nowiki/ > ed.]] 
 There is a cholera [[vaccine]] that can be taken by mouth.  It provides some protection from cholera for about six months. < ref name=WHO2010/ > 
 
 People can also do some other things to prevent cholera.  For example: < ref name=CDCCommunityHealthWorkerTrainingManual/ > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.afro.who.int/index.php?option=com_docman & task=doc_download & gid=1712 |title=Cholera and food safety |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa |publisher=World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa - Division of Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases |accessdate=January 31, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 * Wash their hands with soap and/or [[ash]] after using the [[toilet]], and before touching food or eating. 
 * [[wikt:sterilize|Sterilize]] (remove [[germ]]s from) all water used for drinking, washing, or cooking.  The best and least expensive ways to do this are to [[Boiling|boil]] water or to add [[chlorine]].  If this is not possible, using a [[cloth]] [[filter]] for water is better than nothing. 
 * Wash all [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s using safe water.  Peel fresh fruits before eating them. 
 * Not put their [[Sewage treatment|untreated]] [[feces]] in rivers, oceans, or anywhere in the open environment. This can be avoided by using [[dry toilet]] < nowiki/ > s, especially if governments do not properly treat sewage. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/10/haiti-human-waste-recycle-cholera|title=Haiti recycles human waste in fight against cholera epidemic|last=Doucet|first=Isabeau|date=2013-03-10|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}} < /ref > 
 * Follow all suggestions from [[public health]] agencies like the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] about how to prevent spreading cholera (or other diseases). 
 
 ===Governments=== 
 [[Image:Cholera hospital in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|{{Center|Cholera hospital in [[Dhaka]], showing typical  " cholera beds, "  which are easy to [[disinfectant|disinfect]]}}]] 
 Governments could stop [[outbreak]]s or [[epidemic]]s from happening by improving sanitation.  For example, cholera is very uncommon in developed countries because they have good sanitation and because they add chemicals to their water to kill [[germs]].  Even after people start to get cholera, it is possible for governments to stop the disease from spreading, though: < ref name=choleraoutbreaksteps / > 
 * Sterilization:  Any material that touched a cholera patient should be  cleaned with [[disinfectant]] and washed in hot water, using chlorine [[bleach]] if possible.  Hands that touched cholera patients or their things, like clothing or blankets, should be carefully cleaned and disinfected with water that has [[chlorine]] in it, or with other effective [[antimicrobial]] agents (chemicals that will kill bacteria). 
 * Sewage: Proper [[Sewage treatment|treatment]] can kill enough cholera bacteria for wastewater to go back into the environment. [[Dry toilet]] < nowiki/ > s can be promoted where sewage treatment is not so good. 
 * Sources: Warnings about possible cholera in the water should be posted around [[pollution|contaminated]] water sources, with directions on how to kill the bacteria in the water through things like boiling or adding chlorine for possible use. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Image:Cholera.jpg|thumb|left|{{Center|[[Drawing]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]] bringing cholera (from ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'', 1912)}}]] 
 Cholera probably started in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  As early as the 5th century BC, people in the [[Ganges]] River [[delta]] area wrote about cholera. < ref name=Lancet2004/ >   The disease first spread to [[Russia]] in 1817 by [[trade route]]s (over both land and sea).  Later, cholera spread to the rest of [[Europe]], and from Europe to [[North America]] and the rest of the world. < ref name=Lancet2004/ > 
 
 Seven cholera [[pandemic]]s have happened in the past 200 years.  The latest started in [[Indonesia]] in 1961. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cholera-s-seven-pandemics-1.758504 |title=Cholera's seven pandemics |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=October 22, 2010 |website=cbc.ca |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 31, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   There have also been many serious outbreaks.  The worst outbreak in recent history happened in [[Haiti]] after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake there in 2010]].

 in 1854, an English doctor named [[John Snow]] was the first person to realize that contaminated water caused cholera.  
 
 The English engineer [[Joseph Bazalgette]] solved the problem for [[London]] in the middle of the 19th century. He invented the system for cleaning foul water, a system which is still used world-wide. Cholera has come back to the world because cities have hugely increased populations, and the treatment of sewage has overrun the facilities. It was the British who built most of the world's sewage plants, and until about 1950 they were able to work well unless they were damaged by warfare. Later governments did not invest money in their infrastructure, which meant the increased population eventually caused cholera to return. 
 
 Cholera is not the only problem with water supply. Blooms of [[red algae]] occur from time to time in hot weather, and they have to be killed off. Emergency control is got by adding [[chlorine]] to the water supply. This works, but makes the water rather distasteful. < ref name=Lancet2004/ > 
 
 Fortunately, infections transmitted in bad water can be cured. There is at least one antibiotic which works well against [[amoeba|amoeboid]] parasites, and another which usually works against bacteria. Treatment costs money, of course, and in many countries that means the treatment is not widely available.
