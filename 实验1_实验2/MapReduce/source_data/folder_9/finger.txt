 Humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed [[phalange]]s. < ref name= " OxfIll " / >  The first digit is the [[thumb]], followed by the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger or 'pinky'. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not. The four fingers have three phalanges each; the thumb has two.
