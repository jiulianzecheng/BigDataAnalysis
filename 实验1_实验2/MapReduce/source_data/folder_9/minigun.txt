 The '''M134 Minigun''' is an American 7.62x51mm six-barreled [[machine gun]]. Its [[rate of fire]] is 3000 to 4000 rounds (bullets) per minute. It is called  " mini "  as compared to the earlier, much bigger [[M61 Vulcan]]. 
 
 In [[Movie|movies]] and [[Video game|video games]], the Minigun is sometimes called the chaingun, but this is a mistake. The [[chaingun]] is completely different and has only one barrel.
