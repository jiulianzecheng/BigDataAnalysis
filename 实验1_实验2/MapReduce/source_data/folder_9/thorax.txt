 [[File:Insect anatomy diagram.svg|thumb|In this insect diagram, the thorax is the section labelled '''B''', between the head and the abdomen.]] 
 
 The '''thorax''' is a part of an [[animal]]'s body that is between the [[head]] and the [[abdomen]].  
 
 In [[mammal]]s, the parts that make up the thorax are the [[sternum]], the thoracic [[vertebra]]e and the [[rib]]s. It starts from the [[neck]] and stops at the [[diaphragm]].  
 
 In [[insect]]s and [[crustacean]]s, it is the middle of the three main body sections. The walking [[leg]]s are usually on the thorax.
