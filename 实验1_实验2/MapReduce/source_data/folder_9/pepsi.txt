 == History == 
 It was first introduced as  " Brad's Drink "  in [[New Bern, North Carolina]] in 1898 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his pharmacy where the drink was sold. It was later named Pepsi Cola, possibly due to the digestive enzyme [[pepsin]] and [[kola nuts]] used in the recipe. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20080212003647/http://www.sodamuseum.bigstep.com/generic.jhtml?pid=3 Soda Museum - The History of Pepsi Cola] < /ref >  Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was delicious and would aid in digestion and boost energy. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.pepsistore.com/history.asp |title=The History of the Birthplace of Pepsi-Cola |access-date=2010-01-06 |archive-date=2018-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004163206/http://www.pepsistore.com/history.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 [[gallons]] of [[syrup]]. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer [[Barney Oldfield]] was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi-Cola, describing it as  " A bully drink. refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race " . 
 
 During the [[Great Depression]], Pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1936 of a 12-[[ounce]] bottle. Initially priced at 10 [[Cent (currency)|cents]], sales were slow, but when the price was slashed to five cents, sales increased substantially. With a radio advertising campaign featuring the [[jingle]]  " Pepsi-Cola hits the spot/Twelve full ounces, that's a lot/Twice as much for a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]], too/Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you, "  arranged in such a way that the jingle [[Infinite-loop motif|never ends]]. Pepsi encouraged price-watching consumers to switch, obliquely referring to the Coca-Cola standard of six ounces per bottle for the price of five cents a nickel, instead of the 12 ounces Pepsi sold at the same price. < ref name= " alot " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.oldradiofun.com/downloads/Commercials.19xx.xx.xx_Pepsi_Cola.mp3 |title=1939 Radio Commercial (Twice as Much for a Nickel) |access-date=2021-05-02 |archive-date=2007-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615171027/http://www.oldradiofun.com/downloads/Commercials.19xx.xx.xx_Pepsi_Cola.mp3 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi's status.
