 An '''atoll''' is a kind of [[island]]. It is made when a [[coral reef]] forms around an island that sinks over many years. In the end, the land is gone, and only the coral reef continues to grow until it becomes an atoll, a group of islands shaped like a [[doughnut]].  < ref > {{cite book |title= LIFEPAC|last= History and Geography|date= March 2001|author-link= Theresa K.

 [[Charles Darwin]], who is most famous for his theory of [[evolution]], was the first person to find out how atolls form. He said that [[volcano]]es in the ocean sometimes wear away or sink deeper. [[Coral]] growing on a volcano needs to be near the surface, and it keeps growing to stay there. 
 
 Most atolls are in the warm parts of the [[Pacific Ocean]] or the [[Indian Ocean]]. 
 
 Some island nations like [[Kiribati]], [[Tuvalu]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] have atolls as all or part of their country.
