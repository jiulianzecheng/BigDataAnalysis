The '''ghazal''' is a [[poetry|poetic]] form that has rhyming [[couplet]]s and a [[refrain]], with each line sharing the same [[meter]]. A ghazal talks about both the pain of loss and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient.  It started in 6th century [[Arabic poetry|Arabic verse]]. It comes from the Arabian [[panegyric]] [[qasida]]. The structure of the ghazal are similar in strictness to those of the [[Petrarchan sonnet]]. In its style and content it is a [[genre]] with a lot of variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. It is one of the main poetic forms the Indo-Perso-Arabic civilization gave to the eastern [[Islam]]ic world.  
 
 The ghazal spread into [[South Asia]] in the 12th century.  This was because of the influence of [[Sufi]] mystics and the courts of the new Islamic [[Sultan]]ate. Although the ghazal is mostly a form of Dari poetry and [[Urdu poetry]], today it is found in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent.  
 
 Ghazals were written by the Persian mystics and poets [[Rumi]] (13th century) and [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (14th century), the [[Azeri language|Azeri]] poet [[Fuzuli]] (16th century), as well as [[Mirza Ghalib]] (1797–1869) and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (1877–1938).  Through [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in [[Germany]] during the 19th century.  The form was used by [[Friedrich Rückert]] (1788–1866) and [[August von Platen]] (1796–1835). The [[Kashmir]]i-[[United States|American]] poet [[Agha Shahid Ali]] liked the form. He edited a volume of  " real ghazals in English " .  
 
 It is common in ghazals for the poet's name to be in the last verse.  This is known as [[takhallus]].
