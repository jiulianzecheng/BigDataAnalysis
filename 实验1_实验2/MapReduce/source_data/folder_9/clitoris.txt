 The '''clitoris''' is a female [[genital|genital organ]]. It includes [[corpora cavernosa|erectile tissue]], [[gland]]s, [[muscle]]s and [[ligament]]s, [[nerve]]s, and [[blood vessel]]s. In an embryo there is a small raised point that grows into a clitoris in girls or a [[Human penis|penis]] in boys. Inside the penis, there is the [[urethra]], but there is no urethra in the clitoris. In women, the urethra is hidden behind the clitoris and in front of the [[vagina]]. Penises with male urethras are used daily for [[urination]], and can be used for sex: [[semen]] passes out of the body through the male urethra.  
 
 Although the parts are placed differently, the clitoris is a match to the male [[penis]]. The clitoris causes females [[Sexual intercourse|sexual]] [[pleasure]], [[arousal]] and [[orgasm]]. [[fingering (sexual act)|Rubbing]] or applying other consistent pressure to it is usually needed to help the female have an orgasm. < ref name= " Clitoris " > {{cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|website=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=November 14, 2012|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archive-date=2009-01-13}} < /ref > < ref name= " Weiten " > {{cite book|authors=Wayne Weiten, Dana S.

 During sexual arousal, erectile [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] fills with blood. This causes the clitoris to grow. It grows until orgasm happens. Also during arousal, touching the clitoris and other sensitive areas of the female genitals makes a woman's [[vagina]] change shape and release a [[lubricant]].  The lubricant and change of shape makes it easier for a man to enter a woman and for sex to occur. Most of the clitoris is hidden inside the body. Only a small part of it is seen outside the body. Adding the outside and inside parts, the clitoris is about the same size as the penis. The clitoris and penis grow from the same tissue in the [[womb]]; they bear many similar parts. 
 
 == Parts of the clitoris== 
 ===Outside the body=== 
 [[File:Clitoris and penis comparison.jpg|thumb|This is a comparison between an erect clitoris (left) and a flaccid [[penis]] (right). [[Female]] and [[male]] genitals are developed from the same bundle of tissue.]]The parts of the clitoris that can be seen from the outside are located from the ''clitoral junction'' (the point where the outer lips meet at the base of the [[pubic mound]]) to the ''fork'' (where the lower edges of the inner lips meet below the [[vagina]]l opening). < ref > {{cite book |last=Chalker |first=Rebecca |year=2000 |title=The Clitoral Truth |url=http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100427350 |publisher=Seven Seas Press |page=36 |isbn=1-58322-473-4 |access-date=2006-12-21 |archive-date=2011-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618070244/http://www.sevenstories.com/Book/index.cfm?GCOI=58322100427350 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The outside parts include: 
 * the ''glans'': the head or tip. It is filled with [[nerve]] endings. The glans creates pleasurable feelings. It also increases a woman's sexual response. 
 * the hood: the fold of skin formed by the outer edges of the inner lips. It covers the glans. The hood is the same as the male [[foreskin]]. 
 * the inner lips: hairless and very [[sensitivity|sensitive]] to touch. 
 
 === Inside the body === 
 [[File:Clitoris Anatomy.svg|lang=en|thumb|220px |The parts of the clitoris inside the body]] The parts of the clitoris inside the body include erectile tissue, glands, muscles, blood vessels, and nerves. In both the clitoris and the penis, there are two types of erectile tissue. These are ''[[Corpus cavernosum clitoridis|corpus cavernosum]]'' ([[cave]]rn-like body) and [[Bulb of vestibule|vestibular bulbs]]. These tissues fill with blood during sexual arousal. This causes an erection. The [[clitoral shaft]] is connected to the glans. It is just underneath the surface of the skin. The shaft is a round [[sponge|spongy]] erectile tissue. It is very sensitive like the glans. It feels like a hard ridge. The shaft is about {{convert|0.5|-|1|in|cm|lk=on|abbr=on}} long. It moves toward the pubic mound for a short distance, then bends sharply and divides. This forms two thin legs. These legs are also made of spongy tissue. The legs spread out like the [[wishbone]] of a [[chicken]].
