 '''''Wende''''' ( " the turn-around " ) refers to a historical process in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) in the years 1989 and 1990, after the Soviet reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The [[communism|communist]] [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'', shortly ''SED'') lost their power and a [[democracy|democratic]] government was established. The [[policy]] of this new government lead finally to [[German reunification]] in October 1990. 
 
 The ''Wende'' was known to be very peaceful. The people who were against the SED and communism did not want to use [[violence]], and so these events are also known as the '''Peaceful Revolution''' (in [[German language|German]]: ''Friedliche Revolution''). 
 
 == Beginnings == 
 The ''Wende'' events were part of the fall of Communism all over Eastern Europe, for example in [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] or [[Czechoslovakia]]. Soon there were reforms in that countries. In August 1989, Hungary opened its borders to [[Austria]], and many tourists from East Germany crossed the border and fled to Western countries.  
 
 In September, East Germans were not allowed to go to Hungary any more.  Soon, more and more East Germans went to the [[embassy|embassies]] of [[West Germany]] in [[Warsaw]] and especially in [[Prague]].  Soon there were more than 4,000 people in the Prague embassy.  West Germany could reach that East Germany allowed its people to go.  On 30 September 1989, the West German [[Foreign minister]], [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], came to Prague and told the East Germans in the embassy's garden that they could go.  The traveled to west Germany by trains which went through the GDR.  In the first days of October, even more East Germans went to West Germany from Prague. 
 
 == Monday Demonstrations == 
 [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-1106-405, Plauen, Demonstration vor dem Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in Plauen on 30 October 1989]] 
 In the GDR itself, some [[opposition]]al groups were founded, for example the ''[[Neues Forum]]'' ( " New Forum " ), the ''[[Demokratischer Aufbruch]]'' ( " Democratic Awakening " ) or ''[[Demokratie Jetzt]]'' ( " Democracy Now " ). 
 
 Since October 1989, there were lots of [[demonstration]]s against the SED and for [[democracy]] and [[human rights]]. In the city of [[Leipzig]], people met every Monday in a [[church]] which is called ''Nikolaikirche''. They [[pray]]ed for peace and freedom, and after that, they went out and demonstrate. These demonstrations are called ''Montagsdemonstrationen'' ( " Monday Demonstrations " ).  
 
 On 7 October 1989, there was the 40th  " birthday "  of the GDR. The SED held big celebrations and festivals in [[East Berlin]] and other cities. At the same time, lots of people protested in the streets, and more than 1,000 of them were [[arrest]]ed. In [[Plauen]], in the south of East Germany, many people met for a demonstration. Two days later, on 9 October, there was the next Monday Demonstration in Leipzig. About 70,000 people went peacefully through the city centre, and the [[police]] or the [[Ministry of State Security|State Security]] (Stasi) did not do anything to stop them.  
 
 On 18 October, the main leaders of the SED decided that their chairman, [[Erich Honecker]] had to [[resignation|resign]]. [[Egon Krenz]] became the new leader of the SED (''Generalsekretär des Zentralkomitees der SED'',  " General Secretary of the Central Comitee of the SED " ) and [[head of state]] (''Staatsratsvorsitzender'',  " Chairman of the State Council " ). He said that he wanted to start a  " Wende " , but the demonstrants still wanted the SED to give up all power.

 On 4 November, there was a very big demonstration on the ''[[Alexanderplatz]]'' in East Berlin. More than 400,000 people took part, and the demonstration was shown live on East German [[television]]. 
 
 The government of the GDR discussed a new law about travels to West Germany and other countries. In the evening of 9 November 1989, there was a [[press conference]] with the [[press secretary]] of the Central Committee of the SED, [[Günter Schabowski]]. Just before that press conference, Egon Krenz had given Schabowski a sheet of paper about the new travel law. Before the press conference ended, a [[journalist]] from [[Italy]] asked Schabowski a question about [[freedom of travel]]. Schabowski read out his sheet of paper, which said that everyone should be allowed to leave the country and come back whenever he or she wanted. When he was asked when this rule should come into force, Schabowski answered  " at once "  and  " immediately " . 
 
 Many people watched this press conference on TV, and the West German [[mass media]] reported that the GDR wanted to open the borders  " immediately " . So more and more East Germans went to the Wall to see if this was true. When they saw that the Wall was still closed, they became angrier and angrier. After 23:00, the border was opened at one [[border checkpoint]], at ''Bornholmer Straße'', and soon the other checkpoints followed. In that night lots of people went to [[West Berlin]] and back. In the next days and weeks, thousands of people visited West Germany. 
 
 ==  " Round Tables "  and the end of the Stasi == 
 On 13 November 1989, [[Hans Modrow]] became the new [[Minister-President]] of East Germany. He established a [[Round Table]] for political decisions. On the Round Table were members of the SED and its [[mass organisations]], from oppositional groups and from the churches. In cities, towns and villages, there were many other Round Tables established, too. 
 
 Many people in the GDR still feared the [[Ministry of State Security]], which was known as the  " Stasi " . Modrow renamed the Ministry into ''Amt für Nationale Sicherheit'' ( " Office of National Security " ; AfN). The AfN started to destroy the documents which they had collected over the years. The oppositional forces wanted the documents to be kept, and so they [[Occupation (protest)|occupied]] all the Stasi offices in the country in December 1989 and January 1990. The last was the Stasi headquarters in East Berlin on 15 January 1990. 
 
 == Free election == 
 On 18 March 1990, there were [[free election]]s to the [[parliament]] of East Germany, the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' ( " People's Chamber " ). These election was won by the ''Allianz für Deutschland'' ( " Alliance for Germany " ), a group of [[political party|parties]] which wanted the GDR to be [[annexation|annexed]] by West Germany. The most importand party of the Alliance was the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]], and their chairman, [[Lothar de Maizière]], became the new Minister-President of the GDR. The new [[government]] started the process of reunification, which finally came to an end on 3 October 1990.
