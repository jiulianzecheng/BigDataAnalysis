 '''Pacer''' trains were [[railbus]]es built by [[British Rail]] between 1980 and 1987. There were several classes of them: [[British Rail Class 140|140]], [[British Rail Class 141|141]], [[British Rail Class 142|142]], [[British Rail Class 143|143]] and [[British Rail Class 144|144]]. They were [[diesel multiple unit]] trains, meaning each carriage had its own diesel engine. Pacers were built as a stopgap because British Rail did not have enough normal trains at the time and could not get new ones quickly enough. They were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years, but it actually took nearly 35 years to replace them. 
 
 Most Pacer trains were put out of use in 2020. Two things finally made this happen. The first is that it is difficult for people with [[Disability|disabilities]] to climb onto Pacer trains. The [[Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations]] require that all public passenger trains must be made easy to use for disabled people by 2020 - but they made an exception for the Pacer trains until the end of 2020. Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) follows this rule right now. The second is that the Transport Secretary made a decision in 2015 to retire the Pacers by 2020 for the then-new [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]] service, arguing that it would be bad for the economy in the north to keep using  " these uncomfortable and low-quality vehicles " . < ref > {{Cite web |title=New trains to replace north of England's ageing rolling stock by 2020 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/new-trains-replace-north-england-rolling-stock-pacer-2020 |work=The Guardian |date=27 February 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 At the start of 2020, 138 Pacer units were still being used or stored by three National Rail operators: [[Northern Trains]], [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[Transport for Wales Rail Services|Transport for Wales]]. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/pacers-to-continue-into-2020-operators-confirm/54874.article |title=Pacers to continue into 2020, operators confirm |work=[[Railway Gazette]] |date=22 October 2019 |access-date=24 November 2019 }} < /ref >  Northern Trains retired its last Pacer unit on 27 November 2020, < ref > {{Cite web|last=Slater|first=Chris|date=2020-11-27|title=Final call for hated pacer trains as last 'truck on tracks' makes final journey|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/final-call-hated-pacer-trains-19361262|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Manchester Evening News|language=en}} < /ref >  and so did Great Western Railway in December 2020. Transport for Wales  kept using their Class 143s into the first part of 2021 until May 2021.

 * A lightweight modified [[bus]] body and other things from buses, such as the seats. The driver's cab area is reinforced to make it safer in case of a [[crashworthiness|crash]]. 
 * An underframe with just four wheels for the entire unit, instead of the usual two four-wheeled [[bogies]] (making eight wheels) that you would expect on trains. Passengers complained that this made for a noisy and bumpy ride. It also causes more wear to the wheels and track on tight curves. 
 
 ==Background== 
 {{main article|British Rail railbuses}} 
 At the beginning of the 1980s [[British Rail]] (BR) needed to make new trains to replace its old [[List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes#First generation|first generation]] [[diesel multiple units]] (DMUs) which had been built between the mid-1950s and early-1960s. These old trains had helped replace [[Steam train|steam]] and were popular with the public at the time. But BR did not get much money from the government, so could not get new trains that were just as good as the old ones. BR created two kinds of new [[List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes#Second generation|second generation]] trains: the [[British Rail Sprinter|Sprinter]] series, for use on city and longer-distance services, and the Pacer series as cheap DMUs built using bus parts for short-distance countryside and [[branch line]] services. < ref name=yp-20151017 > {{cite news |url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/simon-bradley-will-pacer-trains-trundle-into-history-at-last-1-7520082 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215111413/https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/simon-bradley-will-pacer-trains-trundle-into-history-at-last-1-7520082 |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 December 2017 |title=Will Pacer trains trundle into history at last? |author=Simon Bradley |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=17 October 2015 |accessdate=19 October 2015}} < /ref > < ref name= " Thomas " > {{cite book|first=David|last=St John Thomas|author2=Whitehouse, Patrick|year=1990|title=BR in the Eighties|url=https://archive.org/details/brineighties0000thom|publisher=David  &  Charles|location=Newton Abbot|isbn=0-7153-9854-7}} < /ref >  The Pacers were intended as a cheap stopgap solution to the shortage of trains, and were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years. < ref name= " JonKellyBBC " / >   BR set a challenge to several companies to design a cheap, lightweight train similar to [[railbus]]es. Since then, 165 Pacer trains (with 340 carriages in total) have been built. By 2015, some of these were over 30 years old. 
 
 They also tried to sell Pacers by showing them in the USA, Northern Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, but no one bought any there. However, [[Islamic Republic of Iran Railways|Iran]] bought leftover [[British Rail Class 141|Class 141]] units, for use on suburban lines around [[Tehran]] until 2005. < ref name=yp-20151017/ > 
 
 ==Class 140== 
 {{main article|British Rail Class 140}} 
 [[File:British Rail class 140.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype Pacer Class 140]] 
 The Pacer series was the outcome of an idea to try using bus parts to create a [[diesel multiple unit]]. The first prototype, known as [[LEV 1]], was made by [[British Rail Research Division]] and [[Leyland Motors]] working together. It used a bus body that was mounted on a modified freight train underframe ([[High Speed Freight Vehicle|HSFV1]]). In 1980 they also built a two-car prototype class 140 at [[British Rail Engineering Limited]] (BREL)'s [[Derby Litchurch Lane Works]]. 
 
 ==Class 141== 
 {{main article|British Rail Class 141}} 
 [[File:141108 at Colne Valley Railway.jpg|thumb|right|A preserved Class 141 at the [[Colne Valley Railway]]. Note the bus-like flat roof and windows.]] 
 Then they built 20 more two-car units, forming the Class 141 fleet that was used mostly for suburban services in [[Yorkshire]]. They could carry 94 passengers in each set of two cars. Their two Leyland TL11 engines gave a total of {{convert|410|bhp|abbr=on}}, making for a top speed of {{convert|75|mph|0|sigfig=2}}.  
 
 The 141s were built with [[Leyland National]] bus bodies that were so narrow that they could only be fitted with standard bus seats. The later Pacers had widened body panels to allow better seating. 
 
 The entire class got a technical upgrade in 1988 at the [[Hunslet-Barclay]] works in [[Kilmarnock]].  
 
 The units were withdrawn from British Rail in 1997. Many were sold to [[Islamic Republic of Iran Railways]] < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.msedv.at/rai/rolling.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928090950/http://www.msedv.at/rai/rolling.html | title = Iranian Railways Rolling Stock | archivedate = 28 September 2011}} < /ref >  but have been withdrawn and are left in disused sidings in Iran. < ref > http://share.bahnforum.info/transfer/e825dbc060ecc7caa98ce2687fe5a58c9db17011/Iran_2013/IMG_2301_1.JPG < /ref >  A few are preserved at museum sites. 
 
 ==Class 142== 
 {{main article|British Rail Class 142}} 
 [[File:Hugh llewelyn 142 017 (6285803767).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Arriva Trains Northern]] Class 142 ''Pacer'' at [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]]]] 
 The next and largest Pacer class was the Class 142. This again was built by Leyland and BREL, in 1985. The body was based on a Leyland National bus, built at [[Workington]] in [[Cumbria]]. Many fixtures and fittings of the Leyland National could be found on the units. The new class could carry more passengers: 120 passengers per two-car set. The same engines were used.  
 
 The first sets were used on [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] branch lines and on commuter services in the [[North West England|north west]]. The units from Cornwall were eventually moved to [[Liverpool]] and the [[North East England|north east]], so the Class 142s were often seen on services across the north of England.  
 
 In the early 1990s, the 142s got more powerful [[Cummins UK|Cummins]] engines, which gave a total power output of {{convert|460|bhp|abbr=on}} per two-car set. Several units were then changed for use on the [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive|Merseyside PTE]] [[City Line (Merseyrail)|City Line]] on [[Merseyrail]] in the Liverpool region, giving them dot-matrix route signs, better seating and Merseyrail PTE paintwork.  
 
 When privatisation happened, the class 142s were taken over by [[Arriva Trains Northern]] and [[First North Western]], and then by [[Northern Rail]], [[Arriva Rail North]], [[Northern Trains]], [[Arriva Trains Wales]] and [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]]. Eight Northern Rail units were withdrawn from service for a while and replaced by a series of [[British Rail Class 158]]s. < ref name= " nrwithdraw " > {{cite web|url=http://www.northernrail.org/images/upload/Angel%20Trains%20leases%2030%20Class%20158%20diesel%20multiple%20units%20to%20….pdf|title=Angel Trains leases 30 Class 158 diesel multiple units to Northern Rail|date=13 March 2007|publisher=[[Northern Rail]]}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  [[First Great Western]] received 12 units on loan from Northern Rail from December 2007 to November 2011 (five units were returned to Northern in December 2008). This allowed most of its Class 158 fleet to be rebuilt as three-car sets. 
 
 ==Class 143 and Class 144== 
 {{main article|British Rail Class 143|British Rail Class 144}} 
 [[File:144017 at York.JPG|thumb|right|Three coach Class 144 at [[York railway station|York]]]] 
 Around the same time that the Class 142 was developed, another class of Pacer railbus was designed by [[Kilmarnock]]-based [[Hunslet-Barclay]]. These used a [[Walter Alexander Coachbuilders|Walter Alexander]] bus body. They were given the number [[British Rail Class 143|Class 143]] and started being used in 1985. Its two 205 & nbsp;bhp engines gave a total output of {{convert|410|bhp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|75|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. This class of Pacer originally had a capacity of 122 passengers. They were used in the North East before being transferred to Wales and the South West, and were moved over to [[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Valley Lines]] and [[Wales  &  West]] control during privatisation. They then passed on to Arriva Trains Wales,  [[Wessex Trains]], [[First Great Western]] and [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]]. The interiors were completely changed in 2000, when the Valley Lines service was introduced, with full back, coach-type seating installed throughout, along with improved fittings. This reduced [[seating capacity]] to 106 seats per set. 
 
 Then came a similar [[British Rail Class 144|Class 144]] unit, a Walter Alexander body on BREL underframe, which was introduced in 1987. A unit was formed of either a two-car set with 122 seats or a three-car set with a total capacity of 195 passengers and {{convert|690|bhp|abbr=on}}, but its top speed was still {{convert|75|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The units were used in the North East, passing to [[Arriva Trains Northern|Northern Spirit]] at privatisation, then to [[Arriva Trains Northern]], [[Northern Rail]], [[Arriva Rail North]] and now [[Northern Trains]]. 
 
 ==Advantages and disadvantages== 
 ===Disadvantages=== 
 It has often been said that the Pacers are of poor quality. Instead of the usual [[bogie]]s, Pacers use a basic four-wheel two-axle underframe. This often makes for a ride that is noisier and less comfortable than other trains, especially over [[railroad switch|points]], and a loud squealing noise is heard around tight curves. Not having bogies also makes for a worse [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] and a bumpier ride; Pacers have been nicknamed  " [[Pumpjack|nodding donkeys]] "  because of the trains' up-and-down motion on uneven track. The basic [[bench seat]]ing can also be uncomfortable. < ref name= " JonKellyBBC " / >  The early units, especially the {{brc|141}}s, were also very unreliable. < ref name=yp-20151017/ > 
 
 Pacers have only been used in certain areas of the north and south west of England and the south of Wales, but not in the richer [[London]] or [[South East England|south east England]] areas. This has also created bad feelings. < ref name= " JonKellyBBC " / > < ref name=yp-20151017/ > 
 
 Safety worries were raised after the [[1999 Winsford railway accident|1999 Winsford crash]]. < ref > {{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/383785.stm |date=2 July 1999 |title=Safety fears over commuter trains |work=BBC News}} < /ref >  A [[Virgin Trains]] [[British Rail Class 87|Class 87]] express train ran into an empty [[First North Western]] [[British Rail Class 142|Class 142]] Pacer, after the Pacer had fouled the main line at [[Winsford railway station|Winsford]], [[Cheshire]] on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. < ref > {{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/375946.stm |title=Train driver averts disaster |date=23 June 1999 |work=BBC News}} < /ref > < !-- I'm guessing that the Class 139's don't count as railbuses -- >  The wire straps that held the body of the Pacer to its frame broke, separating the body from the frame and causing severe damage. The unit was written off. Twenty-seven passengers and crew were wounded, four badly. But all passenger injuries were on the other train, as the Class 142 was running empty at the time. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/HSE_Winsford1999.pdf |title=Report by the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate into the train accident at Winsford South Junction on 23 June 1999 |publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] |year=1999 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Advantages=== 
 On the other hand, the Pacers were seen as a practical solution at a time when there was not a lot of money. They probably saved services on some rural lines that might not have been serviced by any trains at all if only more expensive trains had been available. < ref name= " JonKellyBBC " / >  They have also proved cheap to run, achieving a fuel economy of 10 miles to the gallon. < ref name=yp-20151017/ >

 As of 2020, the oldest Pacers on the national network were nearly 35 years old. All were planned to be withdrawn and scrapped by December 2019 as they do not comply with [[Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations]]. 
 
 === CAF Civity === 
 In July 2019, rollout of Northern's [[British Rail Class 195|Class 195 CAF ''Civity'']] units had begun on some routes. Because of this, refurbished [[Sprinter (British Rail)|Sprinters]] that no longer needed on those routes can be used to replace Pacers instead. 
 
 === Vivarail D-Train === 
 {{Main|Vivarail D-Train}} 
 These units are built out of [[upcycling|upcycled]] [[London Underground D78 Stock]], built between 1978 and 1981, which were in service on the [[District line]] until 2017. To convert the old stock for mainline railway use, it will be necessary to re-use the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fit them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units underwent [[acceptance testing]] in 2015 and Vivarail pitched them to [[train operating company|train operating companies]] (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise. < ref name= " railmagazine140115 " > {{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=Stefanie|title=Vivarail ready to start converting first LU D-Stock|url=http://www.railmagazine.com/news/fleet/2015/01/14/vivarail-ready-to-start-converting-first-lu-d-stock|website=railmagazine.com|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media|accessdate=24 January 2015|date=15 January 2015}} < /ref >  While no orders were received from Northern, [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] will replace its Pacers with a combination of five D-Trains and trains taken over from other train operators, < ref > [https://www.railjournal.com/passenger/main-line/800m-fleet-renewal-plan-for-new-welsh-franchise/  " £800m fleet renewal plan for new Welsh franchise " ].
