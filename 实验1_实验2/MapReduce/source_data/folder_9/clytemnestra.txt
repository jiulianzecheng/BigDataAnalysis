 '''Clytemnestra''' (or '''Klytaimnestra''') was a person in [[Greek mythology]]. She was the daughter of King [[Tyndareos]] of [[Sparta]] and his wife [[Leda]]. She was married to [[Agamemnon]], King of [[Mycenae]]. With him she had children  [[Iphigenia]], [[Elektra]], [[Orestes]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. 
 
 After the [[Trojan War]], Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthos]] killed Agamemnon. Agamemnon had sacrificed their daughter, Iphigenia, to the Gods to have wind to set sail for war. Clytemnestra and Aegisthos are later killed by her son Orestes.
