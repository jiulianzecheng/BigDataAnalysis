 '''Savatage''' was an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. It was made by [[Jon Oliva]] and [[Criss Oliva]] in [[Florida]] in 1979. The band's first name was '''Avatar''', < ref > {{Cite web|title=Savatage|url=https://savatage.com/about/|access-date=2022-10-04|language=en-US}} < /ref >  but they changed it before they released their first [[album]]. This was because another band was already named Avatar. Savatage is thought to have had a big [[influence]] on heavy metal. Many think they had an effect in making progressive metal and death metal sound different. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2013-09-09|title=JON OLIVA Says SAVATAGE Was One Of First Progressive Metal Bands|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jon-oliva-says-savatage-was-one-of-first-progressive-metal-bands/|access-date=2022-10-04|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2018-11-29|title=ALEX SKOLNICK, DAVID VINCENT Remember Late SAVATAGE Guitarist CRISS OLIVA|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alex-skolnick-david-vincent-remember-late-savatage-guitarist-criss-oliva/|access-date=2022-10-04|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en}} < /ref >
