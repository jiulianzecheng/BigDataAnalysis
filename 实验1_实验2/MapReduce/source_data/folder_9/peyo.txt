 '''Pierre Culliford''' (25 June 1928 – 24 December 1992), known as '''Peyo''', was a [[Belgians|Belgian]] comics artist. He is best known for making ''[[The Smurfs]]'' [[comic strip]]. < ref > {{cite news|title= Pierre Culliford; Created the Widely Popular Smurfs |newspaper= LA Times|date=25 December 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-25/news/mn-2392_1_pierre-culliford|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Burt A. | last=Folkart}} < /ref > 
 
 Peyo was born in 1928 in [[Brussels]]. He was the son of an [[English people|English]] father and a Belgian mother. < ref name=Weyer > De Weyer, Geert (2005).  " Peyo " . In België gestript, pp. 148-149. Tielt: Lannoo. < /ref >  On [[Christmas Eve]] 1992, Peyo died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Brussels at age 64. 
 
 ==Career== 
 He went to the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in Brussels. Peyo began work at the [[Compagnie Belge d'Animation]] (CBA), a small Belgian animation studio. There he met a few of his future colleagues, like [[André Franquin]], [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] and [[Eddy Paape]]. He made his first comics for the newspaper ''[[La Dernière Heure]]'' (The Latest Hour). From 1949 to 1952, he drew ''Poussy'', a stop comic about a cat, for ''[[Le Soir]]''. For the same newspaper, he also made ''Johan''. 
 
 In 1952, Franquin introduced Peyo to ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Le Journal de Spirou]]''. It was a children's [[Franco-Belgian comics magazines|comics magazine]] published by [[Dupuis]] which was first in Belgium in 1938. < ref name=Weyer/ >  Peyo wrote and drew a lot of characters and storylines. His favourite was ''Johan et Pirlouit'' (translated into English as ''[[Johan and Peewit]]''). Set in the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], ''Johan et Pirlouit'' stars a brave young [[Page (servant)|page]] to the king, and his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget [[sidekick]]. Johan defends the meek on his trusty horse, while Peewit gallops behind on his goat, named Biquette.  
 
 ===Smurfs=== 
 The first smurf appeared in ''[[Johan and Peewit]]'' on 23 October 1958 in the album ''La Flûte à Six Schtroumpfs'' (''The Six Smurfed Flute''). As the smurfs became more popular, Peyo started a studio in the early 1960s. Many talented [[comic artist]]s started to work. The most notable artists to come from this studio are [[François Walthéry|Walthéry]], [[Wasterlain]], [[Roland Goossens|Gos]], [[Claude de Ribaupierre|Derib]], [[Degieter]], and [[Desorgher]]. 
 
 In 1959, the Smurfs got their own [[The Smurfs (comics)|series]]. Many authors of the [[Marcinelle school]] worked together on the writing or as an artist. These include [[Will (comics)|Willy Maltaite]] (aka 'Will'), [[Yvan Delporte]], and [[Roger Leloup]]. Peyo became more of a businessman and supervisor. He let his son, Thierry Culliford, lead the studio. His daughter Véronique was responsible for the merchandising. < ref name=Weyer/ > 
 
 The merchandising of the Smurfs began in 1959. The PVC figurines were the most important piece until the late 1970s. Then, with the success of the Smurf records by [[Pierre Kartner|Father Abraham]], the Smurfs got more international success. Some of the toys reached the [[United States]]. [[Hanna-Barbera]] made a [[The Smurfs (Hanna-Barbera series)|Saturday morning animated series]] in 1981. Peyo was story supervisor.
