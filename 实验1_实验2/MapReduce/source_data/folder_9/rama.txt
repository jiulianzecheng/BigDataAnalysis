'''Ram''' is known as the son of Lord Surya and Seventh [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in [[Hinduism]]. However, in Valmiki Ramayana, he was the son of Lord Sun (also surya). When king Dashrath conducted the sacrifice, lord sun presented his portion Rama. Rama's character purely resembles Karna(the chief protagonist of the Mahabharata). Both were the protagonists of the two greatest epics. Both were the eldest brother but however Yudhisthira and Bharat were crowned the king. Both had to be deceived by their mother-Kunti and Kaikeyi. Both were the most handsome good-looking person of their respective eras. Both learnt weaponry through the greatest teacher of all time- Parshurama and Vishwamitra. Despite being a part of royal family, had to suffer their entire life. Both possessed not more than 1 wife. Both possessed the bow of Shiva. Parshurama too had a place in the epic of Mahabharata and Ramayana because of the protagonist of the epics- Lord Rama and Karna.

 Indra and Sumitra gave birth to Shatrughana and Lakshmana. Lakshmana and Shatrughana were twins. Kaikeyi and Lord Yama gave birth to Bharat. Lord Rama was born through Lord Surya. 
 
 According to Puranas, Rama, Karna and Shani are three portions of Surya. They are regarded as greatest of all men. 
 
 Rama is said to have been born to [[Kaushalya]] and [[Dasharatha]] in [[Ayodhya]], the ruler of the Kingdom of [[Kosala]]. His siblings included [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]], and [[Shatrughna]]. He married [[Sita]]. Though born in a royal family, their life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, ethical questions and moral dilemmas. < ref name= " Brackney2013p238 " / >  Of all their travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king [[Ravana]], followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. It illustrates [[dharma]] and dharmic living through model characters. < ref name= " Brackney2013p238 " > {{cite book|author=William H.

 ==Etymology and nomenclature== 
 ''Rāma'' is a Vedic Sanskrit word with two contextual meanings. In one context as found in ''[[Atharva Veda]]'', as stated by [[Monier Monier-Williams]], means  " dark, dark-colored, black "  and is related to the term ''ratri'' which means night. In another context as found in other Vedic texts, the word means  " pleasing, delightful, charming, beautiful, lovely " . < ref name= " mmwrama " > {{Cite web|title=Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary --र|url=https://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/218.html#raama|access-date=2021-03-06|website=sanskrit.inria.fr}} < /ref > < ref name=parpola264/ >  The word is sometimes used as a suffix in different Indian languages and religions, such as Pali in Buddhist texts, where ''-rama'' adds the sense of  " pleasing to the mind, lovely "  to the composite word. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC & pg=PA521 |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page=521}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Rama'' as a first name appears in the Vedic literature, associated with two patronymic names – Margaveya and Aupatasvini – representing different individuals. A third individual named ''Rama Jamadagnya'' is the purported author of hymn 10.110 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' in the Hindu tradition. < ref name=mmwrama/ >  The word ''Rama'' appears in ancient literature in reverential terms for three individuals: < ref name=mmwrama/ > 
 
 # [[Parashurama|Parashu-rama]], as the sixth [[avatar]] of Vishnu. He is linked to the ''Rama Jamadagnya'' of the ''Rigveda'' fame. 
 # '''Rama-chandra''', as the seventh avatar of Vishnu and of the ancient ''Ramayana'' fame. 
 # [[Balarama|Bala-rama]], also called ''Halayudha'', as the elder brother of [[Krishna]] both of whom appear in the legends of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. 
 
 The name Rama appears repeatedly in Hindu texts, for many different scholars and kings in mythical stories. < ref name=mmwrama/ >  The word also appears in ancient [[Upanishad]]s and [[Aranyaka]]s layer of Vedic literature, as well as music and other post-Vedic literature, but in qualifying context of something or someone who is  " charming, beautiful, lovely "  or  " darkness, night " . < ref name=mmwrama/ >

 ==Legends== 
 This summary is a traditional legendary account, based on literary details from the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and other historic mythology-containing texts of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. According to [[Sheldon Pollock]], the figure of Rama incorporates more ancient  " morphemes of Indian myths " , such as the mythical legends of ''Bali'' and ''Namuci''. The ancient sage Valmiki used these morphemes in his ''Ramayana'' [[simile]]s as in sections 3.27, 3.59, 3.73, 5.19 and 29.28. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Vālmīki|author2=Sheldon I.
