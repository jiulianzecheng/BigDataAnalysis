 ''Quetzalcoatlus'' had an unusually long [[neck]], and when it stood on the ground it was as tall as a [[giraffe]].  
 
 Its fossil record is from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[North America]], 70–65.5 million years ago. ''Quetzalcoatlus'' became [[extinct]] at the [[K/T extinction event]].  
 
 == Its discovery == 
 A [[college]] student found the first ''Quetzalcoatlus'' fossil in [[Big Bend National Park]] in [[Texas]]. His name was Douglas Lawson, from the University of Texas in [[Austin]]. When he was in the park, he saw a bone sticking out of a rock. Since the bone looked [[wikt:hollow|hollow]], like the bone of a [[bird]], he thought it was part of a flying creature – and he was right. With his professor's help, he kept digging until lots of bones from an [[arm]] and [[wing]] were found. The rest of the animal's body was missing. < ref name= " lawson1975 " > Lawson D.A. 1975. Pterosaur from the latest Cretaceous of West Texas: discovery of the largest flying creature. ''Science'' '''187''': 947-948. < /ref >  Many others have looked for the rest of that huge pterosaur, but it has never been found. Other fossils of ''Quetzalcoatlus'' have been found, but none are as big as the one Lawson found. 
 
 == Flight == 
 Since ''Quetzalcoatlus'' was so large, two researchers suggested it was too heavy to fly. < ref > Henderson D.M. 2010. Pterosaur body mass estimates from three-dimensional mathematical slicing. ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'', '''30'''(3): 768-785. {{doi|10.1080/02724631003758334}} < /ref >  This would have been astonishing, because in the whole fossil record there is no flightless pterosaur. It has been thought their mobility on the ground was too poor for them to survive without flight. However, a recent discussion of this idea concluded they probably could fly after all. Another analysis suggested their flight was quite strong. < ref name=Witton > Witton M.P., and Naish D. 2008. A reappraisal of Azhdarchid Pterosaur functional morphology and paleoecology.

 == Lifestyle == 
 The feeding habits of ''Quetzalcoatlus'' (which had a long beak with no teeth) are unknown. This question, and its flight, are still being discussed. The lack of a more detailed [[skeleton]] is the main problem in reaching conclusions. Two theories have been proposed. 
 
 One idea is that it ate [[fish]], by flying with its jaw in the water, and snapping up fish when it hit them. Texas was largely covered by the [[Western Interior Seaway]] at the time.  " Of these proposed lifestyles, in-flight piscivory [fish-eating] appears to have gained the most acceptance, with skim-feeding being a frequently suggested foraging method. < ref name=Witton/ > 
 
 The other theory is that it fed on land, partly as a [[carrion]] feeder, like [[vulture]]s and [[buzzard]]s, and foraged for small animals. < ref name=Witton/ >  This view is gaining ground, because the jaw does not show the [[adaptations]] for skimming found in modern birds who catch fish this way. 
 
 In flight, it was certainly a soarer, flying on up-currents of air in a warm environment, and its remains come from a site which was far inland in the [[Cretaceous]]. < ref > Wellnhofer, Peter 1991.

 == Media == 
 ''Quetzalcoatlus'' was shown in the [[movie]] ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'' eating a dead ''[[Triceratops]]'' [[carcass]].
