 '''Chromium''' is a [[chemical element]]. Its symbol on the [[periodic table]] (a list of all the elements) is '''Cr'''. It always has 24 [[proton]]s, so its [[atomic number]] is 24. Its [[mass number]] (number of protons and neutrons) is about 54. Most of the times it has 28 [[neutron]]s, but different [[isotope]]s have more or fewer neutrons. As a metal, it has 24 [[electron]]s. Its [[ion]]s have fewer electrons. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Chromium is a shiny [[metal]]. It is reactive, but it reacts with air to produce a very thin coating of [[chromium(III) oxide]], which prevents it from [[rust]]ing any more.  
 
 ==Compounds== 
 Chromium occurs in several [[oxidation state]]s; +2, +3, and +6 are most common. It forms [[chemical compound]]s that are colorful. 
 *[[Chromium(II) oxide]], black, rare, [[reducing agent]] 
 *[[Chromium(II) chloride]], blue when dissolved in water, unstable 
 *[[Chromium(III) oxide]], dark green 
 *[[Chromium(III) chloride]], green when containing water (hydrated), purple when not containing water (anhydrous) 
 *[[Chromium(III) sulfate]] 
 *[[Chromium(IV) oxide]], black, used in [[Audio cassette|cassettes]] 
 *[[Chromium(VI) oxide]], chromium trioxide, red, [[oxidizing agent]], toxic. [[Chromic acid]] is formed by dissolving chromium(VI) oxide in water. 
 *[[Chromyl chloride]], red liquid 
 *[[Chrome alum]]

 ===Trivalent chromium=== 
 There are two main types of chromium ions, which are found in chromium compounds. One type of chromium ion (''Cr < sup > [[oxidation state|3+]] < /sup > '', trivalent chromium ) is required by our body and by those of other animals. If we do not get enough chromium, certain parts of our body may not work properly. We get most of the chromium we need from our food we eat. Chromium is also put into vitamins to make sure that we get enough. If we get too much of this type of chromium, it can harm our body.

 ===Hexavalent chromium=== 
 Another type of chromium (''Cr < sup > 6+ < /sup > '' ([[chromate]], hexavalent chromium), in the +6 oxidation state) can cause cancer or make people sick, even though most people do not get exposed to it much. It is found in places that make chromium metal, which is why they need to be cleaned up when they close. Hexavalent chromium can be destroyed by reacting it with [[reducing agent]]s, turning it into Cr < sup > 3+ < /sup >  (trivalent chromium). They are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s. 
 
 ;Chromates 
 The chromate ion is CrO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > . Chromates are generally yellow. 
 *[[Potassium chromate]] 
 *[[Sodium chromate]] 
 
 ;Dichromates 
 The [[dichromate]] ion is Cr < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 7 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > . Dichromates are red or orange. 
 *[[Ammonium dichromate]] 
 *[[Potassium dichromate]] 
 *[[Sodium dichromate]], used in chromium processing 
 
 ==Occurrence and preparation== 
 [[File:Chromite-182955.jpg|thumb|Chromite]] 
 Chromium occurs as '''chromite'''. Chromite is a mixture of [[iron(II) oxide]] and chromium(III) oxide. Its chemical formula is FeCr < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 4 < /sub > . It is heated with [[sodium carbonate]] to make [[sodium chromate]], [[iron(III) oxide]], and [[carbon dioxide]]. The sodium chromate is reacted with [[sulfuric acid]] to produce [[sodium dichromate]]. The sodium dichromate is [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] by [[carbon]] to chromium(III) oxide. The chromium(III) oxide is reacted with [[aluminum]] to make chromium metal. The [[chromate]]s and [[dichromate]]s are what make chromium production areas toxic. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Chromium is used in different metal products. [[Stainless steel]] is the most common use. It is also used in  " chrome plating " , where it makes things shiny and stops [[corrosion]]. Some chromates were used as pigments, but they are toxic so people do not want to use them anymore.  
 
 ==Safety== 
 Chromium metal is nontoxic. But hexavalent chromium is [[toxic]] and [[carcinogen]]ic, and trivalent chromium is mildly toxic in large quantities.
