 '''Chloroflexi''' is one of four [[Class (biology)|classes]] of [[bacteria]] that produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment, usually found in [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bodies.  
 
 Chloroflexi are typically filamentous (they look like microscopic strings), and can move about through bacterial gliding. They are facultatively [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] (they can survive with oxygen or without it), but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light, or [[phototroph]]y. Additionally Chloroflexi have a different method of phototrophy ([[photoheterotroph]]y) than true photosynthetic bacteria. [[Phylogenetic analysis]] (looking at DNA) indicates that they had a separate origin.
