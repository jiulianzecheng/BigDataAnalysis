 A '''sea''' is a large [[body of water|body]] of [[salt water]]. It may be an [[ocean]], or may be a large saltwater [[lake]] which like the [[Caspian Sea]], lacks a natural outlet.

 Seawater is salty. The open ocean has about {{convert|35|g}} solids per litre, a salinity of 35ppt. The [[Mediterranean]] Sea is a little higher at 37ppt and the [[Dead Sea]] has as much as {{convert|300|g}} dissolved solids per litre (300ppt). Although [[sodium chloride]] is the main salt present, making up about 85% of the solids in [[solution]], there are also {{convert|5|g}} per litre of the chlorides of other metals such as [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] and {{convert|3|g}} of [[sulphate]] < nowiki/ > s, [[carbonate]] < nowiki/ > s, bromides and other salts. A kilogram (2.2 lb) of salt can therefore be found in 28 litres or one cubic foot of typical ocean water. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salty_ocean.htm |title=Why is the ocean salty? |author=Swenson, Herbert |publisher=US Geological Survey |access-date=2020-07-15 |archive-date=2015-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209191609/http://www.palomar.edu/oceanography/salty_ocean.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Despite differences in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative [[composition]] of the dissolved salts is very stable throughout the world's oceans. < ref name=Anderson > {{cite web |url=http://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/02ocean/swcomposition.htm |title=Sea water composition |author=Anderson, Genny |date=October 8, 2010 |work=Marine Science |publisher=MarineBio.net}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Temperature ==== 
 The temperature of the sea depends on the amount of sunlight falling on the surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over {{convert|30|°C}} while near the poles the temperature in balance with the sea ice is about {{convert|-2|°C}}. Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and  density of the water, eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep sea water has a temperature between {{convert|-2|°C}} and {{convert|5|°C}} in all parts of the globe. < ref name=Anderson/ > 
 
 ==== Oxygen ==== 
 The amount of [[oxygen]] found in seawater depends mostly on the plants growing in it. These are mainly [[algae]], including [[phytoplankton]], but also include some [[vascular plant]]s such as [[seagrass]]es. In daylight the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic activity]] of these plants produces oxygen which dissolves in the seawater where it is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea where not enough light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen. < ref name=Anderson/ > 
 
 Seawater is a little alkaline and during historic times has had a [[pH]] of about 8.2. The pH is expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100, an increase of 320% in acidity in a century. < ref name=AboutAntarctica/ >  One important element for the formation of [[skeleton|skeletal material]] in marine animals is [[calcium]] but it is easily precipitated out in the form of [[calcium carbonate]] as the sea becomes more acid. < ref > {{cite book |last=Pinet |first=Paul R. |year=1996 |title=Invitation to Oceanography |url=https://archive.org/details/invitationtoocea0000pine_f1i7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/invitationtoocea0000pine_f1i7/page/126 126], 134–135 |publisher=West Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-314-06339-7}} < /ref >  This is likely to have profound effects on certain [[plankton]]ic marine organisms because their ability to form shells will be reduced. These include single-celled algae called [[coccolithophorid]]s and [[foraminifera]]. These are important parts of the [[food chain]]. Reducing their numbers will have significant results. In tropical areas, [[coral]]s will be affected by a lack of calcium, with knock-on effects for other [[Coral reef|reef]] residents. < ref name=AboutAntarctica > {{cite web |url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/climate-change/ocean-acidification-and-the-southern-ocean |title=Ocean acidification |date=28 September 2007 |publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population  &  Communities: Australian Antarctic Division}} < /ref > 
 
 === Waves === 
 [[File:Steep deep water wave.ogv|thumb|Movement of molecules as waves pass]] 
 Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms [[Wave (physics)|waves]]. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their greatest height when the rate at which they travel nearly matches the speed of the wind. The waves form at right angles to the direction from which the wind blows. In open water, if the wind continues to blow, as happens in the [[Roaring Forties]] in the southern hemisphere, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/learning/player/lesson09.html |title=Ocean waves |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=Ocean Explorer}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | title=Wind Generated Ocean Waves | url=https://archive.org/details/windgeneratedoce00youn | first=I.
