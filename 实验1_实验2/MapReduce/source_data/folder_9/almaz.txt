'''Almaz''' was a space program by the [[military]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Its purpose was to spy on other countries using [[space station]]s. After some time, the program changed to using spy [[satellite]]s instead. < ref name= " sg " > {{cite web |last1=Sven |first1=Grahn |title=Almaz space stations |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |website=www.svengrahn.pp.se |access-date=28 April 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 Since it is hard to hide a space station, the Soviets tried to keep the program a secret another way. They pretended the stations were [[civilian]] and gave them names in the [[Salyut]] series. The Salyut stations (such as [[Salyut 1]]) were normally to learn about how to live in space. 
 
 The Almaz program sent three stations to space, but the first failed. In the later years of the program, satellites were used instead since they are cheaper. 
 
 == Space stations == 
 The Almaz program sent three space stations to space. These were [[Salyut 2]], [[Salyut 3]], and [[Salyut 5]]. These had large [[space telescope]]s to spy on other countries. The [[Astronaut|cosmonauts]] on the station operated these and used [[camera]]s to record what they saw. < ref name= " sg "  / > 
 
 The Salyut 3 station also had a large [[Gun|cannon]], which was test fired once. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/russian-television-reveals-another-secret-the-soviet-space-cannon/|title=Russian television reveals another secret: the Soviet space cannon|date=17 November 2015|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Sean Gallagher|access-date=28 April 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 == Satellites == 
 In 1978, Almaz began to using spy satellites instead of space stations. Four were made as part of the program. These used [[radar]] to observe the ground instead of telescopes. < ref > {{cite web|title=Almaz-T spacecraft |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almazt.html |publisher=RussianSpaceWeb.com |access-date=30 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009023810/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almazt.html |archive-date=9 October 2012 }} < /ref > 
 
 The first was Almaz-T which launched on 29 October 1986. The [[Proton (rocket family)|Proton rocket]] in launched on failed, and was destroyed by its [[Range safety|safety system]]. The next was Almaz-T2, which went to space on 25 July 1987 and stayed in space for two years. The third was Almaz-1 which launched on 3 March 1991 and stayed in space for 18 months. A fourth satellite (Almaz-2) was built but never sent to space. 
 
 == Legacy == 
 The design of the Almaz space stations continues to be used even today. The [[Zarya]] module of the [[International Space Station]] is based on it. And before that, the [[Kvant-1]] module of [[Mir]] was based on it. < ref > {{cite web|title=Mir Hardware Heritage |url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf |publisher=NASA |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224205405/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf |archive-date=24 March 2009}} < /ref >
