The theory behind homeopathy is that an ill person can be healed with very small amounts of something that produces the [[symptom]]s of the [[illness]] in a healthy person. [[Scientist]]s have tested and proven many times that homeopathy does not work at all to treat any disease and only makes people think they feel better. (This is called the [[placebo]] effect.) < ref name= " pmid12492603 "  / > < ref name=Ernst > {{cite journal |author=[[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E]], Pittler MH |title=Efficacy of homeopathic arnica: a systematic review of placebo-controlled clinical trials |journal=Archives of Surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960) |volume=133 |issue=11 |pages=1187–90 |year=1998 | url = http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/133/11/1187 |pmid=9820349 |doi=10.1001/archsurg.133.11.1187}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Creation== 
 Homeopaths make their medicines by taking the ingredients, adding [[water]], and shaking the mixture. They then take a drop of the mixture, throw out the rest, and add more water. They do this usually 30 times but sometimes up to 200 times. They call it potentisation. Hahnemann said this would bring out the  " spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug " . < ref > [http://www.hpathy.com/philosophy/hahnemann-organon261to270.asp ''Organon of Medicine,''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912015714/http://www.hpathy.com/philosophy/hahnemann-organon261to270.asp |date=2009-09-12 }} Samuel Hahnemann, combined 5th/6th edition < /ref >  [[Science]] can show how many [[atoms]] or [[molecules]]—tiny things that cannot be divided up any more—of the original substance are left in the homeopathic drug. Most homeopathic drugs do not contain even a single molecule of the original substance. < ref name= " Weissmann " > {{cite journal |author=Weissmann G |title=Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales |journal=FASEB J. |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1755–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16940145 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/20/11/1755 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-0901ufm|s2cid=9305843 }} < /ref >  Homeopaths believe that the solution carries a  " memory "  of the original substance. < ref name= " shang "  / > < ref name= " NatureWhenToBelieve "  / >  Science says that goes against the laws of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. < ref name= " Weissmann "  / > 
 ==Disputes== 
 Homeopathy became popular because it was created at a time when medicine did not work very well and could make people sick. < ref > [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pagerender.fcgi?artid=2260507 & pageindex=1#page British Medical Journal: Blood-letting], page 283, [[March 18]] [[1871]], retrieved on [[March 21]] [[2008]] < /ref >  Back then, taking homeopathy might have kept people from getting hurt by bad doctors. However, medicine has improved since then, and now helps a lot more than it hurts people. Some homeopaths have told their patients not to take medicines like [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s that could cure (or keep them from getting) [[:wikt:dangerous|dangerous]] diseases. Hence the use of homeopathy, instead of obtaining real medical help, can cause unnecessary suffering, disease and/or death. < ref name= " pmid9243229 " > {{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The attitude against immunisation within some branches of complementary medicine |journal=Eur.
