 '''Fellatio''' is [[oral sex]] performed on the [[penis]]. Fellatio is often called a '''blow job'''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blow+job|title=blow job, a definition from the Merriam-Webster dictionary}} < /ref >  The opposite of this is [[cunnilingus]]. Cunnilingus is oral [[sex]] performed on the vulva.  
 Fellatio can continue until the receiver [[ejaculation|ejaculates]] or as part of [[foreplay]], before actual [[sexual intercourse]].

 There is no risk of [[pregnancy|getting pregnant]] by performing a fellatio, because there is no connection from the mouth to the [[womb]] and the [[fallopian tube]]s. There is however a large risk of transmitting [[sexually transmitted disease|diseases]] if the mouth comes in contact with [[semen]] on the [[penis]]. < ref > [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa19.htm Can I get HIV from oral sex? | Questions and Answers | CDC HIV/AIDS < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  If the person drinks [[alcohol|alcoholic drinks]], it can make this risk higher. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4123193.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Alcohol 'aids HIV cell infection' < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  HIV can also enter through open sores or bleeding gums.  
 
 Very few people are [[allergy|allergic]] to semen. < ref > [http://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/Sexuality/1230.html TeenHealthFX - Answers - Swallowing Semen < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >  Some claim that swallowing ejaculate is an intimate act. < ref > Nancy Friday's book, ''Men in Love - Men's Sexual Fantasies: The Triumph of Love over Rage'' < /ref >   
 
 Diseases such as [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[gonorrhea]], [[herpes]], [[hepatitis]] (multiple strains), and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), as well as viruses such as [[HIV]], can be transmitted through oral sex. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.uhs.uga.edu/sexualhealth/oral_sex.html#safe |title=University Health Center {{!}} Sexual Health {{!}} Oral Sex < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2008-09-21 |archive-date=2007-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010145522/http://www.uhs.uga.edu/sexualhealth/oral_sex.html#safe |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The risk of transmitting HIV through fellatio is unknown, but it is thought to be low. Any kind of direct contact with body fluids of a person infected with [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[AIDS]], poses a risk of infection. The risk from most of these types of infection, however, is generally considered far lower than that associated with [[sexual intercourse|vaginal]] or [[anal sex]]. < ref > {{cite web|author=By & nbsp;Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=572916 |title=Savage Love - Columns - Savage Love - Dan Savage - The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper |publisher=Thestranger.com |date=2008-05-08 |accessdate=2010-03-19}} < /ref > < ref > O'Malley, Paul 1996.

 If the receiving partner has [[wound]]s on their [[genital]]s, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of STD transmission. Flossing or undergoing dental work relatively soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are [[microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]] found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of this, some medical professionals advise the use of [[condom]]s when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STD status is unknown. Flavoured condoms may be used for this purpose. Alternatively there is flavored lube. 
 
 == In culture ==

 Many people accuse someone of performing fellatio as an [[insult]]. For example 'cock sucker!' or 'suck my dick'.  
 Many cultures see fellatio as showing control over ones partner, as often the giver is on their knees. < ref name=Question > {{cite web|url=http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2003/04/09/the_ageold_question_.php|title=The age old question?|access-date=2008-09-01|archive-date=2011-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928073425/http://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2003/04/09/the_ageold_question_.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In [[ancient Greece]] it was called ''playing the flute''. < ref name =Question/ >  The [[Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] practiced it regularly{{fact|date=July 2010}} and made vases showing it.
