 '''Groundwater''' (or '''ground water''') is [[water]] found below the surface.  It is water that is in empty spaces of soil and rocks. Groundwater starts as [[rain]] (or other [[precipitation]]), and flows under ground for long periods of time through [[aquifer]]s. Groundwater flow returns to the surface again through [[spring (water)|springs]] and [[river]]s. Groundwater is an important part of the [[water cycle]].  [[Plant]] < nowiki/ > s take in groundwater through their roots. 
 
 People bring groundwater to the surface by digging or drilling [[well]]s below the surface. They bring up water from the aquifer and use it for irrigation and other purposes. Some of the dissolved minerals in groundwater are important in the food making process of plants.  Rainwater is the main source of groundwater
