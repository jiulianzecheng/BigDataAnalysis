 '''Rhizobia''' are [[Gram-negative]] [[soil]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] which grow inside the [[root]] nodules of legumes (the [[pea]] family: [[Fabaceae]]).  
 
 The growth of this bacteria is beneficial to their plant host. They [[Nitrogen fixation|fix]] (absorb and chemically change) [[nitrogen]] from the air and convert it into the chemical ammonia (through the help of [[Enzyme|enzymes]]). The host plant breaks down this ammonia and uses it for growth.   
 
 In return, the plants provide the bacteria with nutrients for growth from products of plant  [[photosynthesis]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2023-02-24|title=Welcome to Farming For a Better Climate - Farming For a Better Climate|url=https://www.farmingforabetterclimate.org/|access-date=2023-07-01|website=www.farmingforabetterclimate.org|language=en-GB}} < /ref >   
 
 Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. As this relationship is  beneficial for both plant and bacteria involved, it is a classic example of [[symbiosis]] and [[mutualism]] < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Sawada|first=Hiroyuki|last2=Kuykendall|first2=L.

 Rhizobia is very important in aiding plant growth in soils with low Nitrogen concentrations and is classed as a fertiliser for soil. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Jaiswal|first=Sanjay K.|last2=Mohammed|first2=Mustapha|last3=Ibny|first3=Fadimata Y.

 == History == 
 Rhizobia was discovered by Martinus Willem Beijerinck in 1888. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Lise|date=2001-05-30|title=Beijerinck, Martinus Willem|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npg.els.0002363|journal=eLS|doi=10.1038/npg.els.0002363}} < /ref > 
 
 The word rhizobia comes from the Ancient Greek  " ῥίζα "  (rhiza) for root and  " βίος "  (bios) for life.
