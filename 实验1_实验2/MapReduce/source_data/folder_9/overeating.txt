'''Overeating''' (or over-eating) is eating [[food]] more than the body needs. There is a relationship between the energy that an organism uses and the amount eaten. Eating more leads to weight gaining and often [[obesity]]. It may be regarded as an [[eating disorder]]. 
 
 One consequence of overeating is weight gain, and excess weight may cause [[blood pressure]] to rise. In turn this makes illness and even death more likely. 
 
 The problem is very difficult to reverse: losing weight is often attempted, but rarely succeeds. Weight lost is usually rapidly replaced. [[Diet]]s are famously unsuccessful. [[Obesity]] is the end product of overeating. < ref > Obesity and overweight Fact sheet NÂ°311. [[WHO]]. January 2015.

 Some difficult facts are known. Poorer families tend to eat worse food than better-off families. Children learn from the experiences in their families. Once established, habits are hard to break. In 2013, several medical societies, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Heart Association]], classified obesity as a [[disease]]. < ref name= " NYTimes20130618 " > {{Cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/business/ama-recognizes-obesity-as-a-disease.html?_r=0 |title=A.M.A. Recognizes Obesity as a Disease |date=18 June 2013 |work=New York Times |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624124034/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/business/ama-recognizes-obesity-as-a-disease.html?_r=1 &  |archive-date=24 June 2013 |name-list-style=vanc}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag/HHNDaily/HHNDailyDisplay.dhtml?id=5870001020 |title=The Facts About Obesity |last=Weinstock |first=Matthew |date=21 June 2013 |website=H & HN |publisher=American Hospital Association |access-date=24 June 2013 |archive-date=9 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909051439/http://www.hhnmag.com/hhnmag/HHNDaily/HHNDailyDisplay.dhtml?id=5870001020 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
