 '''Epistaxis''' is when [[blood]] comes out of the nose. It is more commonly known as a '''nosebleed'''. Even though nosebleeds can seem scary, they are usually not serious or life threatening. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/teen/safety/first_aid/nosebleeds.html |title=Nosebleeds|publisher=KidsHealth |accessdate=21 March 2010}} < /ref >  Most nosebleeds happen in the front of the nose, and these are called ''anterior nosebleeds''. Sometimes, people get nosebleeds in the back of their noses, called ''posterior nosebleeds''. These are more serious, and somebody who has one may have to go to the hospital. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/nosebleeds/article_em.htm |title=Nosebleeds|publisher=eMedicineHealth |accessdate=21 March 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Nosebleeds are more frequent during the winter months. During this time, more upper respiratory infections occur and changes in [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] are larger. < ref >

 Most nosebleeds are caused by one of the following: 
 * Blunt trauma (usually a punch to the nose) 
 * Nose-picking 
 They can also be caused by a reaction to something in the environment. 
 
 ==Dealing with a nosebleed== 
 Many people tilt their heads back during a nosebleed, but this is actually not safe because it can make blood go down their throats and make them choke or get sick. < ref >
