 '''''Lepisma saccharina''''' (commonly called the '''fishmoth''', '''urban silverfish''' or just the '''silverfish''') is a small, wingless [[insect]]. Typically it is between half an inch and one [[inch]] (12â€“25 & nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]]). Its [[common name]] comes from the animal's silvery blue color, combined with the [[fish]]-like appearance of its movements. The [[scientific name]] indicates the silverfish's diet of [[carbohydrate]]s such as [[sugar]] or [[starch]]es. It belongs to the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] insect [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Thysanura]], and the [[species]] is estimated to have existed for over 300 million years, originating in the [[Paleozoic Era]]. < ref > [http://entomology.uark.edu/museum/silfsh.html University of Arkansas: Arthropod Museum Notes 2005] < /ref >  Often misidentified as a silverfish is the [[house centipede]], another house-dwelling arthropod that exhibits rapid, fluid movement. 
 
 An eyeless species of silverfish, or a close relative, was discovered in January 2006 in caves in [[Sequoia National Park]], [[California]].
