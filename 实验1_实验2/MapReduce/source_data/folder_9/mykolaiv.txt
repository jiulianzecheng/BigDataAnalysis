 The town was founded in [[1789]] by the Russian [[Guberniya|Governor General]] of  [[Novorossiya]] [[Knyaz]] [[Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin|Potemkin]] initially as a shipyard called simply a ''New Shipyard on the Ingul river''. Knyaz Potemkin signed an order to construct a shipyard on [[August 27]], 1789, which is considered to be a city birth date. The shipyard was to serve for the repair of the [[Russian Navy]] ships in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish war]]. Later Potemkin ordered the shipyard to be named ''Nikolaev'' to commemorate the date of fall of [[Ochakov]] to the Russian troops under his command on [[December 6]], [[1788]], close to the day of [[Saint Nicholas]] ''(Nikolay)'' December 19, in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

 The history of the city has always been closely connected to the [[ship building]].
