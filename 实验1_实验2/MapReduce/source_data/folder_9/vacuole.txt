 A '''vacuole''' is a [[Plasma membrane|membrane]]-bound [[organelle]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Venes | first = Donald | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2001 | title = Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary | edition = 20th | publisher = F.A. Davis  | location = Philadelphia | page = 2287 | isbn = 0-9762548-3-2 }} < /ref >  They are a kind of [[vesicle]]. Vacuoles are closed sacs, made of [[membrane]]s with inorganic or organic molecules inside, such as [[enzymes]]. They have no set shape or size, and the cell can change them as needed. They are in most eukaryotic [[cell]]s and do many things. They can store waste. Vacuoles and their contents are distinct from the [[cytoplasm]], and are classified as [[Ergastic substance|ergastic]] according to some people. < ref > Esau K. 1965. ''Plant Anatomy'', 2nd ed. John Wiley. < /ref >  The solution that fills the vacuole is called cell sap. 
 
 What a vacuole does and how important it is depends on what kind of cell they are in. They are much more important in plant and fungus cells than in animal cells. Some common jobs of a vacuole are to: 
   
 * Hold waste products, and keep things separate from the rest of the cell 
 * Hold water in plant cells 
 * Keep the internal hydrostatic [[pressure]] or [[turgor]] steady in a cell. In land plants, this holds the stem upright. 
 * Keep an [[acid]]ic [[pH]] on the inside of a cell 
 * Hold small molecules 
 * In seeds, proteins that seeds use to sprout are put in 'protein bodies'. Protein bodies are just vacuoles that are a little bit different from normal. < ref > Matile, Phillipe 1993.

 Vacuoles are also important in [[autophagy]], keeping a balance between making and getting rid of many things in cells and organisms. They also help with destroying and recycling broken proteins that build up in cells. Vacuoles may help attack [[bacteria]] and some kinds of vacuoles may act as a house for [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria. In protists, vacuoles also store and help digest food that the protist ate. < ref > {{cite journal |author= Jezbera Jan, Karel Hornak, Karel Simek |title=Food selection by bacterivorous protists: insight from the analysis of the food vacuole by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization |journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology |volume=52 |pages=351–363 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.femsec.2004.12.001 |pmid= 16329920 |issue= 3}} < /ref > 
 
 == Central vacuole == 
 The central vacuole is a cellular [[organelle]] found in plant cells. It is often the largest organelle in the cell. It is surrounded by a membrane and holds materials and wastes. It also keeps the proper pressure in the plant cells, and supports the growing plant. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 The evolution of [[multicellular]]ity took place several times on Earth. That is, separately in animals, [[fungi]], [[streptophyte]]s ([[charophyte]] [[algae]] and [[land plant]]s), [[red algae]], and [[brown algae]]. The vacuole probably evolved several times independently, even within the [[Viridiplantae|green plants]]. < ref name=Becker > {{cite book |author=Becker B |title=Function and evolution of the vacuolar compartment in green algae and land plants (Viridiplantae) |volume=264 |pages=1–24 |year=2007 |url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/botanik/bot1/AGBecker/Publikationen/pdfs/IRC2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(07)64001-7 |pmid=17964920|series=International Review of Cytology |isbn=9780123742636 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084817/http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/botanik/bot1/AGBecker/Publikationen/pdfs/IRC2007.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-06 }} < /ref >
