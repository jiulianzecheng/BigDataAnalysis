'''Revenue''' (or '''revenues''') is [[income]] that an [[organization]] receives from its normal business activities. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp |title=Revenue |author= |website= |publisher=Investopedia, LLC |accessdate=10 June 2016}} < /ref >  In the case of a corporation this is usually from the sale of [[product (business)|goods and services]] to customers. In the case of a government, revenue usually comes from various [[tax]]es. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-sources-revenue-federal-government-0 |title=What are the sources of revenue for the federal government? |author= |website= |publisher=Tax Policy Center; Urban Institute  &  the Brookings Institution |accessdate=10 June 2016}} < /ref >  In addition to sale of goods and services, some companies also receive revenue from [[interest]], [[dividend]]s or [[royalties]] paid to them by other companies. 
 
 First and foremost, it's important to note that revenue isn't the same thing as [[profit]]. Profit represents what is left over after all expenses are subtracted from revenues ([[gross margin]]). It would be possible for a company to generate high levels of revenue without earning any profit at all. For example, if Company A makes $1 million in sales but incurs $2 million in costs, then Company A will have zero net profit (or alternatively negative net profits). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Revenue|url=https://www.jika.io/dictionary/Revenue|website=Jika.io}} < /ref >
