 Some of the important [[event]]s in the Earth's history are [[flood]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], [[earthquake]]s, [[orogeny]] (mountain building), and [[plate tectonics]] (movement of [[continents]]).  
 == Subjects == 
 Geology is divided into special subjects that study one part of geology. Some of these subjects and what they focus on are: 
 
 * [[Geomorphology]] – the shape of Earth's surface (its ''morphology'') 
 * [[Historical geology]] – the events that shaped the Earth over the last 4.5 billion years 
 * [[Aquifer|Hydrogeology]] – underground water 
 * [[Palaeontology]] – [[fossil]]s; evolutionary histories 
 * [[Petrology]] – [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], how they form, where they are from, and what that implies 
 * [[Mineralogy]] – [[mineral]]s 
 * [[Sedimentology]] – sediments (clays, sands, gravels, soils, etc.) 
 * [[Stratigraphy]] – layered [[sedimentary rock]]s and how they were deposited 
 * Petroleum geology – [[petroleum]] deposits in sedimentary rocks < ref > Chapman, R. E. (2000). Petroleum geology. [[Elsevier]]. < /ref > < ref > Selley, R. C. (1998).

 == Types of rock == 
 
 {{Further|rock (geology)}} 
 
 Rocks can be very different from each other.  Some are very hard and some are soft.  Some rocks are very common, while others are rare.  However, all the different rocks belong to three categories or types, igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. 
 
 * [[Igneous rock]] is rock that has been made by volcanic action.  Igneous rock is made when the [[lava]] (melted rock on the surface of the Earth) or magma (melted rock below the surface of the Earth) cools and becomes hard. 
 * [[Sedimentary rock]] is rock that has been made from [[sediment]].  Sediment is solid pieces of stuff that are moved by wind, water, or [[glacier]]s, and dropped somewhere.  Sediment can be made from clay, [[sand]], [[gravel]] and the bodies and [[Animal shell|shells]] of animals.  The sediment gets dropped in a layer, usually in water at the bottom of a river or sea.  As the sediment piles up, the lowers layers get squashed together.  Slowly they set hard into rock. 
 * [[Metamorphic rock]] is rock that has been changed.  Sometimes an igneous or a sedimentary rock is heated or squashed under the ground, so that it changes.  Metamorphic rock is often harder than the rock that it was before it changed.  [[Marble]] and [[slate]] are among the metamorphic rocks that people use to make things. 
 
 === Faults === 
 All three kinds of rock can be changed by being [[heat]]ed and [[squeeze]]d by forces in the Earth. When this happens, [[Fault (geology)|faults]] (cracks) may appear in the rock. Geologists can learn a lot about the history of the rock by studying the patterns of the fault lines. Earthquakes are caused when a fault breaks suddenly. 
 
 === Soil === 
 Soil is the stuff on the ground made of lots of particles (or tiny pieces). The particles of soil come from rocks that have broken down, and from rotting leaves and animals bodies. Soil covers a lot of the surface of the Earth. Plants of all sorts grow in soil.

 == Principles of Stratigraphy == 
 Geologists use some simple ideas which help them to understand the rocks they are studying. The following ideas were worked out in the early days of [[stratigraphy]] by people like [[Nicolaus Steno]], [[James Hutton]] and [[william Smith (geologist)|William Smith]]: 
 
 # Understanding the past: Geologist [[James Hutton]] said  " The present is the key to the past " . He meant that the sort of changes that are happening to the Earth's surface now are the same sorts of things that happened in the past. Geologists can understand things that happened millions of years ago, by looking at the changes which are happening today. 
 # [[Horizontal]] [[strata]]: The layers in a sedimentary rock must have been horizontal (flat) when they were deposited (laid down). 
 # The age of the strata: Layers at the bottom must be older than layers at the top, unless all the rocks have been turned over. 
 # In sedimentary rocks that are made of [[sand]] or [[gravel]], the sand or gravel must have come from an older rock. 
 # The age of [[Fault (geology)|faults]]: If there is a crack or fault in a rock, then the fault is younger than the rock. Rocks are in strata (lots of layers). A geologist can see if the faults go through all the layer, or only some. This helps to tell the age of the rocks. 
 # The age of a rock which cuts through other rocks: If an [[igneous rock]] cuts across sedimentary layers, it must be younger than the sedimentary rock. 
 # The relative age of [[fossil]]s: A fossil in one rock type must be about the same age as the same type of fossil in the same type of rock ''in a different place''. Likewise, a fossil in a rock layer below must be earlier than one in a higher layer.
