 A '''puzzle''' is a problem to make the user think. They are often used for [[entertainment]] and can help with [[logic]] skills. The user may need to recognise [[pattern]]s to solve it, so those who have good logic are usually good with puzzles. 
 
 Puzzles, such as [[wordsearch]]es, [[crossword]]s and [[Sudoku]] grids are printed in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, but puzzles can be with objects or even on [[computer|computers.]].
