'''Mesons''' are incredibly small [[subatomic particle]]s that are made of one [[quark]] and one [[Antimatter|antiquark]]. Antiquarks are the [[antimatter]] counterpart of a regular quark < !--, meaning that in a fraction of a second, a quark and its antiquark will destroy each other to produce only energy [Not really. See English Wikipedia.]-- > . Since antimatter quarks have the opposite [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of regular quarks, their spins can cancel each other out, which forms a particle similar to a [[Higgs Boson]]. The name '''meson''' comes from Greek  " mesos " , meaning middle. This is because the [[mass]]es of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like [[electron]]s, called [[lepton]]s, and heavy particles like [[proton]]s, called [[baryon]]s. 
 
 ==Mesons' spin== 
 Mesons are [[hadron]]s, which simply means that they are made of quarks. Since quarks have different fractional [[Electric charge|charge]]s, mesons can have a charge. However, the charges of the quarks may cancel out, forming an uncharged meson. The rest of the hadron family are known as [[baryon]]s, which are made of three quarks. Since quarks all have a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2, three of them will never add up to an [[Boson|integer spin]]. An integer spin is simply 0, 1, or 2. Particles with an integer spin are called [[boson]]s, which obey [[Bose-Einstein Statistics]]. This means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in [[Space (physics)|space]] at the same time. However, a meson is made of one quark and one antiquark, which each do not have an integer spin. Particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 1/2 or 3/2. These particles with 1/2 spin are called [[Fermion]]s because they obey [[Fermi-Dirac Statistics]]. This means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time. All known baryons and quarks (and antiquarks) are fermions, and all mesons are bosons. This can get very confusing  < !--though not for the quarks-- > because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time, but the quarks that make up mesons cannot exist in the same point in space at the same time. 
 
 ==Creation of Mesons== 
 The most common natural way that we find mesons are through the interactions of [[cosmic ray]]s with matter. This process can be duplicated in [[particle accelerator]]s, which smash high-energy quarks and antiquarks. However, the mesons are very unstable and quickly turn into other particles. [[Electromagnetism|Charged]] Mesons can decay into [[electron]]s and [[neutrino]]s, and uncharged mesons can decay into [[photon]]s. Since antimatter is destroying matter, a large amount of energy is given off. The energy follows the equation [[E=mc2|E=mc < sup > 2 < /sup > ]].
