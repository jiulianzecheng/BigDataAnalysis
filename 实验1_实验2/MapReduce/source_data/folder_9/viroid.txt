 '''Viroids''' are the smallest [[Infectious disease|infectious pathogens]] known. They consist solely of short strands of circular, single-stranded [[RNA]] without [[capsid|protein coats]]. They are mostly [[plant pathogens]] (plant diseases), some of which can cause [[crop]] loss. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Viroids.aspx |title=Viroids: New and Continuing Risks for Horticultural and Agricultural Crops |author=Hammond, Rosemarie W. ; Owens, Robert A.  |publisher=The American Phytopathological Society |access-date=7 August 2015}} < /ref >  Viroid [[genome]]s are extremely small in size.

 Viroids were the first  " sub-viral pathogens "  discovered and named by [[Theodor Otto Diener]].  He was a [[plant pathologist]] at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Research| Research Center]] in [[Beltsville, Maryland]], in 1971. < ref name= " pmid5095900 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Diener TO | title = Potato spindle tuber  " virus " .

About 33 [[species]] have been identified.
