{{Books of the Old Testament}} 
 '''Deuteronomy''' is a book in the [[Bible]].  It is the last of the five books of [[Moses]], meaning it deals with Moses, the [[Israel]]ites and their [[Ancestor|ancestors]], and their relationship with [[God]]. It is part of the [[Torah]]. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name of the book is {{lang|he|Dbariym}}, which means 'Words.'

 === The Beginning === 
 The book begins with the words Moses spoke to the Israelites in the [[wilderness]] east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]].  He told them that they had been very [[Rebellion|rebellious]] towards God, so God made them travel from place to place before reaching the land he promised them.  This was the fortieth year they travelled. 
 
 === The Causes === 
 Moses told the Israelites what had happened throughout their journey.  He scolded them for disobeying God, who made them go through a very hard journey.  Moses then gave them the Law, teaching them what must be done, and what cannot be done.  These laws were given to him by God.  (See [[Ten Commandments]].) The Law warns against [[Worship|worshipping]] other gods, and tells that all Israel, every one, must obey God alone. He warned them against worshipping [[Idol|idols]], and commanded them to treat the [[Poverty|poor]], foreigners, and [[Orphan|orphans]] well.  If the Israelites obey God, they will prosper (be successful). But God predicted that the future [[Generation|generations]] will [[Suffering|suffer]] because of their disobedience.  One day, however the Israelites would return to God. 
 
 === The Tablets === 
 God then commanded Moses to write the Law on stone tablets for the Israelites to remember.  Then Moses formally made [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], son of Nun, the new leader over the Israelites.  God gave Moses a song to sing, and asked him to teach it to the Israelites.  The song would remind them in the future about how they had gone against God. 
 
 === The death of Moses === 
 Moses was very old - 120 years - during that time.  He knew he was going to die because God had told him it would happen.  Therefore, before he died, he gave a blessing to all the twelve tribes of Israel. 
 
 Finally God made Moses climb [[Mount Nebo]] and showed him all the land he was giving to Israel.  Because Moses and his brother [[Aaron]] disobeyed God earlier on, Moses was not allowed to enter the land, only to see it. Moses died on Mount Nebo, and the Israelites [[Mourning|mourned]] for him for thirty days.  After that Joshua began to lead Israel under God's command.
