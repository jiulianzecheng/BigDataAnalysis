'''Boer''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /bur/) is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for [[farmer]] which is used to call the descendants of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] farmers of [[Southern Africa]] during the 1700s, as well as those who left the [[Cape Colony]] during the 1800s to live in the [[Orange Free State]], [[Transvaal]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]]. They did this to escape the [[United Kingdom|British]] rule, and the wars between the British imperial government and the native tribes on the eastern frontier.  
 
 In 1657, “vrybriewe” was granted to 9 burgers, the first [[farmer]]s or Boers (Boere) at the Cape.  Although they were not known as Afrikaners, they did not regard themselves as living in a [[Europe]]an country.  As more immigrants from Europe arrived at the Cape, more international marriages took place.  Soon their language and culture were lost and transformed.  They regarded themselves as a new nation, the [[Afrikaner people]]. [[Paul Heyns]], born in [[1696]] christened his son Michiel Afrikanus (the Afrikaner).  
 
 One [[Hendrik Bieslow]] in [[1707]] proclaimed in public “Ik ben een Afrikaander”. The Boers later created the [[Boer Republics]], which were defeated in the [[1880]]-[[1881]] and [[1899]]–[[1902]] [[Boer War|Anglo-Boer wars]] (Anglo-Boere-oorloë). After that, many Boers emigrated to other countries, but many still live in modern [[South Africa]], [[Eswatini]] (formerly [[Swaziland]]) and [[Zimbabwe]].
