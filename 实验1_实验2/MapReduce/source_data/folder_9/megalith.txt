 A '''megalith''' is a large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] used to build a [[structure]] or [[monument]], either alone or together with other stones. '''''Megalithic''''' means structures made of such large stones, put together without the use of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[cement]].  
 
 The word ''megalith'' comes from the [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{polytonic|μέγας}}'' ''megas'' meaning ''great'', and ''{{polytonic|λίθος}}'' ''lithos'' meaning ''stone''. It has been used to describe [[stone structure]]s built by people from many parts of the world living in many different times.  Many megaliths were used to figure out the dates of the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. 
 
 These structures were built mainly in the [[Neolithic]] period. They continued to be built into the [[Bronze Age]]. Some were built even earlier in the [[Mesolithic]] period. < ref > Johnson, W. (1908) p.67 < /ref > 
 
 A famous example of a megalith is [[Stonehenge]].
