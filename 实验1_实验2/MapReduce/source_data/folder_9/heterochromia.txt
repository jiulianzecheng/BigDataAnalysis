[[File:Cuando el color llama la atenci√≥n.JPG|thumb|Heterochromia, possibly a [[Mosaic (genetics)|genetic mosaic]] ]] 
 
 '''Heterochromia''' means  " different colors " , and is most used for the description of [[Eye color|different colored eyes]]. Some people, and animals, have differences between the [[Iris (eye)|irises]] of their eyes. There are many different causes for this condition. 
 
 [[Genetic]] causes for heterochromia include [[genetic mosaicism]], where changes may take place in the dividing cells leading up to iris formation in the [[embryo]]. Or, environmental damage may occur to the eyes. Or, various diseases and medical conditions may result in changes in eye color. 
 
 Similar events may happen in other tissues, and sometimes result in visible tissue differences. However, the condition is most easily seen in the iris of the eye. The terms ''Hetrochromia iridis'' (= different color of the iris), ''Heterochromia iridum'' (plural form) and ''Heterochromia iridium'' (a mistake in [[Latin]] grammar) are variously used when it is the eye color which is specifically mentioned.
