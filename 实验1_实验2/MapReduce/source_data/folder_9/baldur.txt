 '''Baldr''' (also '''Balder''', '''Baldur''' or '''Baldor''') is the god of light and radiance, joy and purity, peace and forgiveness in [[Norse mythology]]. A member of the [[Æsir]], he is the son of [[Odin]] and [[Frigg]], and twin brother to the blind god of [[darkness]], [[Höðr]]. His wife is called [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]], with whom he had a son named [[Forseti]], god of [[:wikt:justice|justice]]. Prior to his death, Baldr possessed a [[ship]] called Hringhorni, said to be the largest ship ever built. His hall is called Breidablik.  
 Based on the Merseburg charms, his Germanic name may have been '''Phol'''.   
 
 Baldr once had a nightmare that he would be killed. His mother, [[Frigg]], made all the things across the Nine Realms vow not to hurt him. The mistletoe did not vow, however, as Frigg considered it to be so unimportant that she thought nothing of it. [[Loki]] found out that the mistletoe had not vowed, and thus made a spear out of the dreaded plant, and tricked Höðr into throwing it at Baldr. Beings from all across the Nine Realms will come to attend his funeral, and Baldr's wife Nanna soon dies of grief. Loki is soon caught and sentenced to punishment; he is bound by the entrails of one of his sons, to face torture as the venom of a massive serpent drips from its fangs onto Loki's eyes. This causes him unimaginable pain, writhing in agony. (The goddess [[Skaði]] is responsible for placing the serpent above him). His wife Sigyn is stationed nearby, collecting the drips of venom into a bowl. When the bowl is full, she leaves to empty it, and when she does, the venom drips onto the trickster and gradually eats away at his flesh. Loki's escape from this predicament is the catalyst of [[Ragnarök]], as upon his being freed, he will lead the forces of Jötunheimr and Svartálfheimr in a final assault against the gods.  
 
 During [[Ragnarok|Ragnarök]], the veils/barriers between the realms will be broken, so Baldr will be able to escape from Helheimr. After the death of Odin at the fangs of the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]], Baldr and Höðr came back to life, meeting with the other survivors in the'' ''fields of '''Iðavöllr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Iðavǫllr'' -  " splendour-plain " ), where [[Asgard]] once lay. There, they shall rule in place of their father.
