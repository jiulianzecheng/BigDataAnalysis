 '''Tights''' are a tight fitting clothing. In [[American English]], the term includes [[pantyhose]]. They usually fit from the waist down and are often worn in [[dancing]]. Tights in the past were made of elasticized silk or other material. Modern tights are often made of [[spandex]]. 
 
 Tights were invented in 1598, by a man called William Lee. He was a reverend and made a machine that knitted together silk. < ref > A history of hosiery [http://www.uktights.com/article/14/a-brief-history-of-hosiery/] < /ref > 
 
 Tights come in thin and thick options. Thinner tights are called sheer and thicker ones are called opaque. People measure this thickness uses something called  " denier " . They are five categories that show what denier a pair of tights is: Ultra sheer, sheer, semi-opaque, opaque and thick-opaque. 
 
 Tights are intended to maintain a wearerâ€™s legs warm, and they arrive in a vast collection of colors, lengths, and materials. Tights come in a diverse selection of colors and patterns. 1 rule of thumb to consider is that coated leggings like the shiny metallic leggings will usually have less stretch than faux leather leggings or even our basic nylon leggings which are the absolute most easy to fit due to their unhindered stretch. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://awesomeleggingstore.com/what-are-leggings/|title=What are leggings?|last=Fisher|first=Amy|date=January 13, 2020|website=Awesomeleggingstore.com|url-status=dead|access-date=2020-02-06|archive-date=2020-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205202047/https://awesomeleggingstore.com/what-are-leggings/}} < /ref >
