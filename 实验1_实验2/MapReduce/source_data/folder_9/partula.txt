'''Partula''' is a genus of land [[snail]]s, constituting over 100 species of [[Tree snail|arboreal land snails]] native to [[French Polynesia]] and neighboring islands. 
 
 Their decline and [[extinction]] is the result of failed [[biological control]]. The [[giant African land snail]] was introduced to French Polynesia as a food source, which escaped and began destroying crops. The [[rosy wolfsnail]] was subsequently introduced to eat and eradicate the giant African land snail. It instead chose to eat the 100 species of Partula endemic to the islands, resulting in an accidental [[Mass extinction|mass extinction event]] within French Polynesia. 
 
 Some species were successfully saved by scientists who collected the last live individuals from French Polynesia and took them into captivity for breeding. Others have been resilient enough to survive in the wild. 
 
 == Notable species == 
 ''[[Partula affinis]]'', which survived in a valley the rosy wolfsnail never reached. It is believed to be a closely related species to ''Partula otaheitana''. 
 
 ''[[Partula clara]]'', which continues to survive in some areas. 
 
 ''[[Partula exigua]]'', the first species of Partula to become extinct, a predatory snail itself which ate other native snails. These prey snails' populations increased after its extinction. It was named for being the smallest Partula species. 
 
 ''[[Partula faba]]'', the first species of Partula to be described, which was taken into capitivity but failed to breed. The last died in 2016. 
 
 ''[[Partula hebe]]'', which is a successfully bred species. The last 9 snails were collected and bred, and have been reintroduced to the wild over 20 years later. 
 
 ''[[Partula hyalina]]'', which is an extremely resilient species. It continues to survive in the prescence of the rosy wolfsnail as well as on several islands the rosy wolfsnail was not introduced to. 
 
 ''[[Partula otaheitana]]'', the second Partula species to be described, after ''Partula faba''. Closely related to ''Partula affinis''. 
 
 ''[[Partula rosea]]'' and ''[[Partula varia]]'', two species native to [[Huahine]]. These two species were used by the natives to make jewelry. Both were successfully taken into captivity and released some time after. 
 
 ''[[Partula suturalis]]'' and ''[[Partula taeniata]]'', previously considered extinct but now considered extant because of [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] changes. Initially they were each confined to one [[subspecies]], ''P. s. suturalis'' and ''P. t. taeniata'', both extinct, but since then other species have been demoted to subspecies under these two species, resulting in their  " [[de-extinction]] " . 
 
 ''[[Partula turgida]]'', the first known extinction due to a [[Parasitism|parasite]]. Was taken into the breeding program but all snails were killed by a parasite that infested the breeding chamber.
