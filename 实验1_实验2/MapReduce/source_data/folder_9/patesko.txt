 '''Rodolpho Barteczko''' (born [[12 November]], [[1910]] – [[13 March]], [[1988]]) is a former [[Brazil]]ian [[Football (soccer)|football]] player. He has played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]]. Widely considered one of the most complete left-wingers in Brazilian football at his time, offensive, good dribbler and finisher.  
 
 ==Early life== 
 
 Patesko, a fast left winger, comes from a Polish immigrant family. He originally played in his native city of Curitiba, the capital of the southern Brazilian state of Paraná, with [[Palestra Itália FC]], which was later merged into what is now Paraná Clube after two mergers. 
 
 ==Club career== 
 
 After playing for Gremio Esportivo Força e Luz in the riograndenser capital of Porto Alegre in 1932, he moved to Montevideo in 1932 to play there under coach Ondino Viera for the local [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]]. In the 1933 Uruguayan championship , Nacional tied on points with CA Peñarol at the end of the yearin first place. Patesko was absent from the three title playoffs where Nacional won the title, all of which took place in 1934, the last of which was in November. Presumably, Nacional and Patesko parted ways in February 1934. In March and April, the press reported that transfers to SC Corinthians Paulista in São Paulo and CR Vasco da Gama in Rio had already taken place, but neither of these came about. It was rumored that Patesko had had temporary contracts with two clubs. He played other games for the Cebedenses. 
 
 At the end of 1934, he was hired by Botafogo FC in Rio, where he made his debut on December 9th in a 1-1 friendly against Vasco da Gama. With Botafogo he immediately won the championship of Rio de Janeiro from 1935. He stayed with Botafogo until the end of his career in 1943, although he also played for Atlético Mineiro in a friendly match in September 1941. 
 
 ==International career== 
 
 He was eventually signed by the Brazilian federation CBF, with whose selection he competed in the 1934 World Cup participated in Italy. There he played for the Seleção in the 3-1 first-round loss against Spain. He continued to be a regular for the national team, with which he finished second at the 1937 South American Championship. At the 1938 World Cup in France, he was third with Brazil. It was followed by a third place at the South American Championship in 1942. He earned 34 matches with 11  goals.  
 
 ==Later life and death== 
 
 After his playing career, Patesko worked in Rio de Janeiro at the Hipódromo da Gávea, the city's racecourse. At the time he had lost all contact with his family, he was the father of a son. 
 
 On the morning of March 13, 1988, Patesko died of tuberculosis in a hospital in Curicica, a western Rio neighborhood. His former club was informed of this by a call from a fan. The club's board of directors organized a proper funeral for the club's idol. His former team-mate [[João Saldanha]], a major sports journalist in his later career and also national coach before the 1970 World Cup, said that he was a fan of Patesko
