 '''Temnospondyls''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] of small to giant [[batrachomorpha|batrachomorph]] [[tetrapod]]s. They lived worldwide from the [[Carboniferous]] to the [[Triassic]]. A few [[species]] continued into the [[Lower Cretaceous]]. 
 
 The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the [[Labyrinthodont]]s minus the [[Lepospondyl]]s. It is probably an [[evolutionary grade]], not [[monophyletic]]. It is convenient to use, because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia. < ref name=Milner > Milner, Andrew 1990. the radiations of temnospondyl amphibians.

Nevertheless, they were amphibians, and many larval stages have been found. 
 
 They are a large group of some 40 [[family (biology)|families]] and 160 [[genera]]. < ref name=Milner/ > < sup > p322 < /sup >  [[Fossil]]s have been found on every continent. Their evolutionary history spans 210 million years. During this time, they [[adapted]] to a wide range of [[habitat]]s including fresh water, [[terrestrial]], and even [[coast]]al [[Marine biology|marine]] [[environment]]s. 
 
 Fossils are known from the [[larva]]l stage, [[metamorphosis]], and maturity. < ref name=rise/ > < sup > p184 < /sup >  Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales, claws, and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have. 
 
 The youngest known temnospondyl is the [[Australia]]n [[Koolasuchus]] that lived about 120 million years ago during the [[Early Cretaceous]].
