'''Leet''' (sometimes written as  " 1337 "  or  " l33t " ), also known as '''eleet''' or '''leet-speak''', is another [[alphabet]] for the [[English language]] that is used mostly on the [[internet]]. It uses various combinations of [[ASCII]] characters to replace [[Latin alphabet|Latinate]] letters. For example, leet spellings of the word ''leet'' include ''1337'' and ''l33t''; ''eleet'' may be spelled ''31337'' or ''3l33t''. It is used on the internet in [[Internet forum|forums]], [[chat room]]s and [[online game]]s. 
 
 Leet is mostly used for [[English language|English]], but can also be used with other languages including [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]]. 
 
 == Leet-speak == 
 Leet-speak is a mixture of words (mostly computer-related jargon) spelled incorrectly intentionally*, usually coming from [[typo|typographical errors]] ([[Exempli gratia|e.g.]] ''the'' becomes ''t3h''). The words of Leet-speak are usually put together to create a [[dialect]] (small language). This dialect is used in some places for funniness. l33tspeak uses [[numbers]], [[ASCII]] symbols, and [[diacritic]]s together to make symbols that look like Latin letters. For example, the name  " David "  would translate in 1337 as |)/-\\/1|) or more commonly as D4v1d. 
 
 === 1337 Alphabet Examples === 
 Most of the time it is only the [[vowel]]s that are changed and then usually only they are replaced by numbers; therefore, it is unusual to see someone use the leet alphabet to spell out a whole word (although there are common exceptions, namely ''1337''). 
 
 These are only examples; these are not mandatory for Leet-speak, which is not officially defined anywhere, like most [[slang]]s.

 === Wrong grammar* === 
 When a person writes in English the person must follow English rules, but most of the time people who write in leet do not use these rules. When they write in leet they try to write it in a special way, so that it is very different from English. 
 
 " l33t is teh suck! "  (meaning: 'leet sucks') shows that in leet people can use their own rules, and not use the English rules. A lot of times [[adjective]]s (describing words) are turned into [[nouns]]. The leet word  " teh "  (the) is also often placed in front of verbs, as in  " I teh pwnd j00 "  (meaning I the owned you, meaning: I beat you badly). another example might be I 4m t3h pwnage!!!!11!!11 (meaning I am the best!) 
 
 Leet speakers may also speak normally but without the vowels. Fr xmpl nmbr 1 u cn tll it wrks.= For example, number one you can tell it works. 
 
 === Pronunciation === 
 Because some words are too long for use in games they have been written how they sound. Here's a quick guide: 
 * pwn --- own, pawn or powne 
 * x or xx (as in haxxorz or haxorz) --- an x followed by a z. In this example, hackzorz would be pronunciation 
 * R0fz --- rolling on floor screaming, pronounced rawfs 
 
 ===Variations=== 
 There are some that are uber 1337...using nothing but symbols and numbers to represent their letters... 
 Example as follows; 
 
 1 4/\/\ 7|-|3 | < 33/o3|2 ()| "  7|-|3 \_//\/1\/3|253 (I am the keeper of the universe)

 < nowiki > * < /nowiki > Much of the intentional misspelling said to be part of 1337 is actually more properly part of [[Internet_slang|chatspeak]], a completely different thing.
