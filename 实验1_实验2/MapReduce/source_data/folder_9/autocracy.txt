The person who holds the power is called an autocrat. 
 
 When there is a [[monarch]] ruling a country as an absolute [[monarchy]], this is also called an autocracy. Having an autocratic government does not mean the country is governed well or governed poorly. It is just a description on how it is set up.The two types of Autocracy are Absolute monarchy and [[Dictatorship]]  
 
 In modern times, most autocrats gain power as part of a larger [[nationalist]], [[communist]], or [[fascist]] movement. Once in power, they eliminate all other kinds of authority in the country, such as judges, the [[legislature]], and political parties. 
 
 Historical examples of autocracies include:  
 
 * The [[Aztec Empire]] in [[Mesoamerica]], in it, the Aztec Emperor functioned as both the sole ruler of the Empire himself, as well as of its [[military]], he also was the religious [[figurehead]] behind the empire's aggressive [[foreign policy]] (In this time, the priesthood supported a [[pantheon]] that demanded [[human sacrifice]], and the nobility consisted mainly of warriors who had captured many prisoners for these sacrificial rites) 
 * Eastern [[Han Dynasty]] under [[Dong Zhuo]] 
 * the [[Empire of Japan]] under [[Hirohito]] 
 * the [[Roman Empire]], in 27 [[B.C.]], [[Augustus]] founded the Roman Empire following the end of the [[Roman Republic]].  Augustus officially kept the [[Roman Senate]] while effectively consolidating all of the real power and influence in himself.  In recent years [[dictator]]s have been called autocratic.
