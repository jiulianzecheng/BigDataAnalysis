A '''terrier''' is a [[dog]] of any one of many [[Dog breed|breed]]s of terrier types. They are named from the [[Latin]] word ''terra'' meaning [[Soil|earth]]. It refers to their love of digging after their [[prey]] (small [[burrow]]ing [[mammal]]s). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/groups/terriers |title=Terrier Dogs |author= |website= |publisher=TotallyHer Media, LLC |accessdate=11 January 2016}} < /ref >  Terriers are typically small, very active and [[Courage|fearless]] dogs.
