 ==Early bible history== 
 The ''[[Book of Ezra]]'' and ''[[Book of Nehemiah]]'' are the oldest sources for the history of Ezra,. < ref name= " Britannica " / >  Many of the other books they say are written by Ezra (First Esdras, 3-6 Ezra) are written after that. Those books take the story from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. 
 
 Ezra was a member of the family of [[Seraiah]] the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]]. He lived in Babylon when in the seventh year (~ 457 BCE) of [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. 
 
 Ezra led a large group of exiles back to Jerusalem. He discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He worked to stop this from happening again. < ref name= " Britannica " > Ezra.

 Some years later the king Artaxerxes sent a Jewish nobleman, [[Nehemiah]], to Jerusalem. He had to rebuild the city walls. Once this was done, Nehemiah asked Ezra to read the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) to the people. The people and priests agreed to keep to this law and to separate themselves from all other peoples. 
 
 ==Later literature== 
 The [[2 Esdras|second book of Esdras]] was written a lot later, c. AD 100. In this book, Ezra talks with an [[angel]] or God three times and has four visions. At the end, he is taken up to [[heaven]] like [[Enoch]] and [[Elijah]]. < ref name= " BrillPauly " / >  Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book. < ref name= " BrillPauly " / >

 Judaism believes Ezra started the [[Great Assembly]] of scholars and prophets. Later, this would become the [[Sanhedrin]], the authority when it comes to religious law. < ref name= " Jewish Encyclopedia " > [[Emil G.
