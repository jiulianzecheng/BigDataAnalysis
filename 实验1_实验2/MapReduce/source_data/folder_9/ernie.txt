 '''Ernie''' is an orange [[Muppet]] on the [[television program]] ''[[Sesame Street]]''. Ernie was created and voiced by [[Jim Henson]]. [[Steve Whitmire]] has voiced Ernie since love. He is [[Bert]]'s best friend. They live together. 
 
 Ernie is the more active and [[comedy|funny kind]] of guy. He looks like an orange [[football]] with [[horizontal]] stripes on his [[shirt]]. He [[laugh]]s differently than anyone else and really likes to [[sing]]. 
 
 Ernie was first seen with Bert in the test [[episode]]s of ''Sesame Street'' in [[1969]]. His voice at that time was more similar to [[Rowlf]] the [[dog]] than [[Kermit the Frog]]. He had [[purple]] and [[yellow]] stripes on his shirt and a purple nose instead of the [[red]] and [[blue]] stripes and red nose he has now. His shirt and nose were changed in the second year of the program. In the third year, his [[eye]] focus got better. 
 
 Bert is Ernie's and roommate. He is more grumpy, but still likes Ernie.
