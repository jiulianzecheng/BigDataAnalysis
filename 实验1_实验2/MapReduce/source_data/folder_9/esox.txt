 '''''Esox''''' is a [[genus]] of [[fresh water]] [[fish]]. It is the only living genus in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Esocidae]]. The oldest known example of an ''Esox'' is ''[[Esox tiemani]]''. < ref name=Nelson205 > Joseph S. Nelson, ''Fishes of the World'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley  &  Sons, 2006), p. 205 < /ref >  It dates to about 62 [[million]] years ago and was found in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. < ref name=Nelson205/ >  They are commonly called [[pike]] and pickerel. They are found in the [[north]]ern parts of [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. < ref name=Page60 > Lawrence M. Page; Brooks M. Burr, ''Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America North of Mexico'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011), p. 60 < /ref >  One [[species]], ''Esox lucius'', the [[Northern pike]], is found in both Europe and North America. < ref name=Page60/ >  Esox are large [[predatory]] fish with a long [[Cylinder|cylindrical]] [[body]]. They have a [[green]] color (various shades) with [[yellow]] [[eyes]]. Pike and pickerel share a forked tail [[fin]] and a large pointed head. < ref name=Page60/ >  Their [[fin|dorsal]] and [[fin|anal fins]] are located far back on their bodies. < ref name=Page60/ >  All species have very sharp teeth. 
 
 == Species == 
 
 Currently there are five species in the ''Esox'' genus. The study of this family is not complete. There are several known hybrids between species which occur naturally. < ref > ''Pike: Biology and Exploitation'' ed. John Craig (London: Chapman  &  Hall 1996), p. 2 < /ref >  The five species are: 
 
 * ''Esox lucius'' - The [[northern pike]]; found in both [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. < ref name=Marcy241 > ''Fishes of the Middle Savannah River Basin: With Emphasis on the Savannah '', ed. Barton C. Marcy (Athens, GA; London: University of Georgia Press, 2005), p. 241 < /ref > 
 * ''Esox reichertii'' - The [[Amur pike]]; found in the [[Amur river]] in Asia. < ref name=Marcy241/ > 
 * ''Esox masquinongy'' - The [[Muskellunge]]; found in  northern and [[east]]ern North America. < ref name=Marcy241/ > 
 * ''Esox niger'' - The [[Chain pickerel]]; native to the [[U.S. states]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[North Carolina]]. < ref name=Marcy241/ >   
 * ''Esox americanus'' - The [[redfin pickerel]]; also found in Georgia and North Carolina. < ref name=Marcy241/ > 
 There is an extinct species called ''[[Esox tiemani]]''.  
 
 == Forage == 
 
 All species of Esox are predatory feeders. < ref name=Everard94 > Mark Everard, ''Britain's Freshwater Fishes'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2013), p. 94 < /ref >  They eat other fish, small [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. < ref name=Everard94/ >  Pike will eat almost anything that doesn't eat them first. < ref > Vin T. Sparano, ''The Complete Outdoors Encyclopedia'' (New York: Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin, 2000), p. 482 < /ref >
