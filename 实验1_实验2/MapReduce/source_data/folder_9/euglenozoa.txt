 The '''Euglenozoa''' are a large [[phylum]] of [[flagellate]] [[protists]].  
 They are part of the [[wastebasket taxon]] known as the [[Protozoa]], which had many obviously different protists. 
 
 Euglenozoa include a variety of common free-living species, and some important [[parasites]], of which a few infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the [[Euglenoidea]]  " euglenids "  and [[Kinetoplastea]]  " kinetoplastids " . < ref name=Tom >

 Most Euglenozoa have two [[flagella]], [[parallel]] to one another in a pocket-like structure. In some there is a [[cytostome]] or mouth, used to eat [[bacteria]] or other small organisms. This is supported by a [[microtubule]] from the flagellar bases; two other tubules support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell. < ref name=Pat1999 > {{cite journal| author = Patterson, David J. 1999. |title = The diversity of eukaryotes| journal = American Naturalist |year = 1999| volume = 154 | pages = S96–S124 | pmid=10527921 | doi=10.1086/303287 | issue = S4|s2cid = 4367158}} < /ref > 
 
 Some other Euglenozoa feed through [[absorption]], and many euglenids have [[chloroplast]]s and so get energy by [[photosynthesis]]. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain [[chlorophyll]]s ''A'' and ''C'', and other pigments, < ref name=Tom/ >  so are probably [[evolved]] from those of a [[endosymbiosis|captured]] [[green alga]].  Reproduction occurs only by cell division.  During [[mitosis]], the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside it. < ref name=Pat1999/ > 
 
 The group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella. In addition to the normal supporting microtubules, each contains a rod (called ''paraxonemal''), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other. < ref name=Sim1997 >

 ==Classification== 
 The euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic. They are related to [[Percolozoa]]; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped compartments, which only occurs in a few other groups. < ref name=Bal2000 > Baldauf S.L; Roger A.J; Wenk-Siefert I.  &  Doolittle, W.

 Both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the [[Excavata]]. < ref name=Sim2003 >
