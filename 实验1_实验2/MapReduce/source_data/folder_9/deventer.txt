 '''Deventer''' is a municipality and city in the province of [[Overijssel]], the Netherlands. About 101,000 people were living there in 2021. It lies both in [[Salland]] and [[IJsselvallei]] regions, alongside the eastern bank of the [[IJssel]] river. 
 
 Deventer was founded by [[Lebuinus]] around 768. He built a wooden church there. 
 
 A Catholic community called the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] was founded by priest [[Geert Groote]] in this city late 14th century. This community was connected with a Catholic reform movement called the [[Devotio Moderna]], which was largely based on Groote and founded the same time. 
 
 Deventer is well known for its cake, the so-called ''Deventer Koek''.
