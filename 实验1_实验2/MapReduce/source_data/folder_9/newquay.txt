 '''Newquay''' ({{lang-kw|Tewynn Pleustri}}) is a [[town]], [[civil parish]], [[seaside resort]], and [[fish]]ing [[port]] on the north [[Atlantic]] coast of [[Cornwall]], [[South West England]]. It is bounded to the west by the River Gannel and its associated salt marsh, and in the east by the Porth Valley. The town has been expanding inland (south) since it was founded. According to the [[2001]] [[census]], it had a permanent [[population]] of 19,423. It is the largest holiday resort in Cornwall, and it is served by Newquay Airport. The large beach provides very good conditions for [[surfing]]. There are numerous shops, ranging from the usual charity shops to shops selling many different brands of surf clothing.  There are many places to enjoy eating within the town.
