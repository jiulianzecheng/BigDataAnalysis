 '''Spain''' is a [[country]] in Southern Europe. It is in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Spain has borders with [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Andorra]] and [[Gibraltar]]. [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] border with [[Morocco]] in [[North Africa]]. In Spain's northeast side are the [[Pyrenees mountains]]. 
 
 The people of Spain are called Spaniards. They speak [[Castilian language|Castilian]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (in Spanish,  " < span lang= " es "  dir= " ltr " > Castellano < /span > " , from ''Castilla'', or  " < span lang= " es "  dir= " ltr " > Español < /span > " ).  They speak other languages in some parts of the country.  They are [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Basque language|Basque]], and [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Aranese]] [[Occitan language|Occitan]]  and even [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The [[religion]] of about 56% of the population in Spain is [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]. 
 
 Since 1975, Spain has had a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The King of Spain is [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]]; he only does what the [[constitution]] allows him to.  The parliament is called  " Las Cortes Generales, "  and has two bodies:  " El Congreso "  (The Congress) and  " El Senado "  (The Senate) and it is chosen by the Spanish people by [[vote|voting]].  The [[Prime minister]] is [[Pedro Sánchez]].  The [[government]] and the king's [[palace]] are in [[Madrid]], the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Spain. 
 
 Spain has more than five hundred thousand [[Square kilometer|square kilometres]] of land.  It is smaller than France, but it is bigger than [[Germany]]. Almost fifty million people live in Spain. Spain is divided into 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] (this means that they can decide upon some affairs themselves). Each community has its own government. 
 
 Spain is known for [[flamenco]] which is usually performed by the [[Caló]]. 
 
 Spain was a predominant [[Colonial Empire]] and had colonies throughout [[South America]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] and [[Africa]] with a large hold of European lands. 
 
 Spain was under a dictatorship by  
 [[Francisco Franco]] from 1939 to 1974. 
 
 ==History of Spain== 
 {{main|History of Spain}} 
 ===Early history=== 
 [[File:Dama de Elche.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Lady of Elche]] made by the Iberians]] 
 People have lived in Spain since the [[Stone Age]].  Later, the [[Roman Empire]] controlled Spain for about five hundred years; then as the Roman Empire broke up, groups of [[Germanic people]] including [[Visigoths]] moved in and took control. 
 
 === Muslim rule === 
 In 711, many parts of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] became under the control of the [[Muslims|Muslim]] [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. They called the land [[Al-Andalus]]; it was the farthest western point of [[Islamic civilization]]. In 756, the Umayyads were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] in the east. The Umayyads ruled the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], which fell apart in the early [[11th century]]. Muslim rulers sometimes fought each other when they were not fighting the Christians. Muslim Spain was focused on [[learning]]. The greatest [[library]] system outside [[Baghdad]]. 
 
 At first the Muslims ruled most of Spain but the [[reconquista]] slowly forced them out over seven centuries. 
 
 ===Kingdom of León=== 
 The [[Kingdom of León]], the most important in the early Spanish Middle Ages, was started in 910. This Kingdom developed the first democratic parliament (Cortes de Llión) in Europe in 1188. After 1301, León had the same King as the Kingdom of Castile in [[personal union]].  The various kingdoms remained independent territories until 1833, when Spain was divided into regions and provinces. 
 
 In 1492, the Christians took the last part of Spain that still belonged to the Moors, [[Granada]].  [[Boabdil]], the last Moorish King of [[Granada]], surrendered to King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] on 2 January 1492.  Ferdinand and Isabella then ruled all of Spain. 
 
 Before this, there were a number of Christian countries in what is now called Spain. Two of these countries, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], came together when Ferdinand II of Aragon married the queen [[Isabella of Castile]].  The King ruled as much as the Queen. 
 
 [[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Inside of the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], a Muslim [[mosque]] which became a Christian [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|cathedral]].]] 
 In the same year, 1492, they sent [[Christopher Columbus]] to sail across the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Columbus found the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. 
 
 When other Europeans explored, like [[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]], they found out that there were two [[continent]]s there - [[North America]] and [[South America]].  Spanish [[conquistador]] < nowiki/ > es took over very large parts of those two continents. This [[empire]] did not make Spain a rich country, for most of the money had to be spent in wars in Italy and elsewhere.  Some of these wars were fought against other European countries who were trying to take over parts of the Americas. 
 
 Meanwhile, at home, the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or taken to other countries.  Jews had also been expelled from Spain.  Some Jews remained but they had to become [[Christians]].  Among the few old things kept and respected in Spain were in [[music]]:  [[harmony]] and [[stringed instrument]]s. The buildings that had been built by the Moors were kept, and many Muslim religious buildings ([[mosque]]s) were turned into churches. Some Jewish religious buildings were also turned into churches. Many Arab words became part of the Spanish Language 
 
 === 16th and 17th century === 
 The grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella was Charles.  When his grandfather died he inherited Castille and Aragon.  He also inherited many territories at the death of his other grandfather, Maximilian I of Austria.  Charles received from Maximilian the Austria state and the territories of Burgundy.  He was named Charles I in Spain, but he was elected as the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was called [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]].  This made the empire bigger than ever.  However, it was not a single country, but a [[personal union]] of  many independent countries with a single King.  At first many Spaniards did not want Charles as their king, so they fought against him. However, he won. 
 
 Charles did not like the [[Protestant Reformation]], and fought against it. 
 
 ===18th century=== 
 In the 18th century some of the parts of that large empire became their own countries, or were taken over by new countries, such as the [[United States|United States of America]]. 
 
 ===19th century=== 
 Spain (and other European countries) was invaded by [[Napoleon]] of France. [[Britain]] sent troops to defend the peninsula, since it was so weak. Most of the [[Spanish Empire]] became independent in the following decades. 
 
 ===20th century=== 
 There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the [[20th century]]. Some Spaniards tried to set up a government chosen by the people (a [[democracy]]), and they made [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] leave the country. However, in 1936, two different groups of Spaniards went to war over whether the government should be a democracy, in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (although those on the side of the Republic were largely socialist or anarchist), or take orders from one person. In 1939, those who wanted democracy were defeated, and a nationalist [[dictator]] named [[Francisco Franco]] took over the government. 
 
 Francisco Franco died on 20 November 1975. He had decided that Spain should have a monarchy again, and he chose Juan Carlos, the grandson of Juan of Bourbon who had been forced to leave the country, to be king and [[Adolfo Suárez]] to become its first [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. But the king and Suárez did not rule as a dictator; instead, they chose to set up a democracy. 
 
 On 23 February 1981 a group of people who had supported the now dead General Franco tried to take control of the [[democratic]] Spanish Parliament by force, they entered the building and fired guns in the air. It was seen live on Spanish television and there was widespread fear that this might be the start of another civil war. However, Juan Carlos I, quickly appeared on television and broadcast to the nation that they should remain calm. The persons responsible for the attempt to take over the country were arrested. 
 
 Now Spain is a modern democratic country, and does business with many countries around the world. It is the eighth largest economy in the world and is an important part of the [[European Union]]. 
 
 ===21st century===
