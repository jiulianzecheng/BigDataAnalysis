"  ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. < /ref >  Hook-and-loop fasteners have a  " hook "  side, which is a piece of [[fabric]] covered with tiny hooks, and a  " loop "  side, which is covered with even smaller and  " hairier "  loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. < ref name= " OED " > {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster |title=Velcro |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/velcro |accessdate=2008-05-10 }} < /ref >  When they are separated, they make a special  " ripping "  sound.

 The person who invented hook-and-loop was a [[science|scientist]] named George de Mestral. < ref > {{cite web |last = Stephens |first = Thomas |title = How a Swiss invention hooked the world |publisher = swissinfo.ch |date = 2007-01-04 |url = http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/search/Result.html?siteSect=882 & ty=st & sid=7402384 |accessdate = 2008-05-09}} < /ref > < ref name= " Better " > {{cite book| last1 = McSweeney| first1 = Thomas J.| last2 = Raha| first2 = Stephanie | title = Better to Light One Candle: The Christophers' Three Minutes a Day: Millennial Edition| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-1Vm4OZ1B44C & pg=PA57| accessdate = 2008-05-09| year = 1999 | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-8264-1162-4| page = 55 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Velcro.uk " > {{cite web|url= http://www.velcro.co.uk/cms/History.6.0.html? & L=96581|title= About Us:History|accessdate= 2008-05-09|publisher= Velcro.uk|archive-date= 2008-06-14|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080614144059/http://www.velcro.co.uk/cms/History.6.0.html? & L=96581|url-status= dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " fb " > {{cite book| last = Fulbright| first = Jeannie| title = ''Exploring Creation with Botany''| url = https://archive.org/details/exploringcreatio00fulb| date = 2004| publisher = Apologia Educational Ministries, Inc.| location = 1106 Meridian Plaza, Suite 220| isbn = 978-1-932012-49-1 }} < /ref >  During a hunting vacation in [[Switzerland]], de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his [[dog]]'s fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a [[microscope]] and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like [[wikt:grasp|grasping]] hands. < ref name=fb/ >  De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of [[button]]s and [[zipper]]s. < ref name=fb/ >  By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made hook-and-loop! 
 
 == Vocabulary == 
 
 George de Mestral created the Velcro trademark by combining the [[French language|French]] words for [[velvet]] (''velour'') and hook (''crochet''). < ref name=fb/ >
