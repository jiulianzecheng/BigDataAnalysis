'''Nucleosynthesis''' is the [[physics|physical]] process where lighter [[elements]] are changed into heavier elements. This usually happens in the center of a [[star]], both during its life and especially during its [[supernova|violent death]]. It is also thought that this happened at the beginning of the [[universe]], in the [[big bang]].
