 '''Poisons''' are [[Chemical substance|substances]] which cause [[death]] or [[injury]] [[Exposure (toxicology)|when taken in by a living thing]]. < ref > ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 9th ed, p1055. < /ref > < ref > {{DorlandsDict|six/000084583|Poison}} < /ref >  It may be taken in as drink or food, or [[absorption|absorbed]] through the skin. The damage is usually done by a [[chemical reaction]]. The effect of the poison varies with the amount which is absorbed (taken in or inhaled). Substances which are poisonous are called [[toxic]], but any substance can be toxic if too much of it is consumed. If poisoning causes death, it is ''lethal'' poison. 
 
 Legally, and in hazardous chemical labeling, poisons are especially toxic substances. Less toxic substances are labeled  " harmful " ,  " irritant " , or not labeled at all. 
 
 In [[medicine]] and [[zoology]], toxins and [[venom]]s are different from poisons. Toxins are the result of a biological process. [[Venom (poison)|Venom]]s are substances which the [[organism]] uses to harm other [[species]]. Certain organisms use venoms for hunting, or as a defense. If an organism is ''poisonous'', such as many mushrooms, it is harmful to eat. If it is ''venomous'', like snakes or honeybees, it has a harmful bite or sting. For some very deadly bites, humans have developed effective [[antivenom]]s.  
 
 Often it is only the quantity of a substance that makes the difference. Drinking [[alcoholic drink]]s may lead to aggressive behavior, problems with speech, and different forms of [[amnesia]]. This effect is called [[intoxication]]. People who drink even more may go into [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].  At the same time, alcohol can be used as a [[disinfectant]]. 
 
 Sometimes, poisons have an [[antidote]]. The antidote of a poison will slow or reverse its effects. The antidote may itself be a poison. As an example, [[atropine]] can be used as an antidote against certain [[nerve gas]]es, like [[tabun]] or [[sarin]], or against certain [[insecticide]]s. It is also used as a [[medication]].  In high doses, atropine is a poison. Yet, atropine is a ''core'' medicine in the [[World Health Organization]]'s  " [[WHO Model list of essential medicines|essential drugs list]] " . < ref name= " essentialWHO " > {{cite web| year = 2005| url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2005/a87017_eng.pdf| title = WHO model list of essential medicines| publisher = World Health Organization| accessdate = 2006-03-12| archive-date = 2007-02-12| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070212145830/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2005/a87017_eng.pdf| url-status = dead}} < /ref > 
 
 There are other types of dangerous materials. These are: 
 * [[Carcinogen]]s ([[cancer]]-causing poisons), like [[acrylamide]], [[asbestos]], and [[benzene]] 
 * [[Mutagen]]s ([[mutation]]-causing poisons) such as [[radiation]] and benzene 
 * [[Teratogen]]s ([[birth defect]]-causing poisons), like [[thalidomide]] and [[Ethanol|alcohol]] 
 
 [[Pollution]] is also sometimes poisonous, for example [[toxic waste]]. 
 
 == Poison gas == 
 In [[war]]s, some countries use [[poison gas]]es against their enemies. This is called [[chemical warfare]]. 
 
 Poison gases such as [[chlorine gas]] and [[mustard gas]] were used in [[Chemical weapons in World War I|World War I]]. In World War II, the [[Nazi]]s used a form of [[hydrogen cyanide]] gas to [[mass murder|kill many people]] in their [[death camp]]s and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. 
 
 Poison gas has also been used to intentionally kill humans as a method of [[execution|death penalty]]. 
 
 Being poisoned by gas sometimes happens accidentally. For example, a faulty [[furnace]] or [[heating]] system can cause [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning. 
 
 There are many types of poison gases. For example, [[corrosive]] poison gases cause serious [[burn]]s to the skin, eyes, and [[lungs]]. [[Nerve agent]]s are poisons that can kill by damaging the [[central nervous system]]. [[Blister agent]]s cause severe blisters on the inside and the outside of the body. [[Choking agent]]s make [[pulmonary edema|fluid build up in a person's lungs]] until they [[drown]].
