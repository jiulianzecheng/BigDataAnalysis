 '''Tachycardia''' is the fast beating of the [[heart]]. In [[adult]]s, it refers to [[heart rate]]s higher than 100 beats per minute. Tachycardia may be a normal physiological response to [[wikt:stress|stress]], but depending on the cause and how healthy the patient is, tachycardia could be harmful and need medical treatment. In some cases, tachycardia can cause [[death]]. 
 
 Tachycardia can be harmful in two ways. First, when the heart beats too rapidly, it may perform inefficiently. Second, the faster the heart beats, the more [[oxygen]] and nutrients the heart requires. This can be especially problematic for patients suffering from [[ischaemic heart disease]].
