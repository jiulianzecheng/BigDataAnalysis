 A '''plebiscite''' or '''referendum''' is a type of [[voting]], or of proposing [[laws]]. Some [[definition]]s of 'plebiscite' suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/plebiscite |title=Definition of Plebiscite |access-date=2014-11-22 |archive-date=2016-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902214617/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/plebiscite |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Others define it as the opposite. [[Australia]] defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.peo.gov.au/learning/fact-sheets/referendums-and-plebiscites.html |title= Referendums and Plebiscites}} < /ref > 
 
 There are two types of result 
 * Mandatory - meaning the government must do what the result says 
 * Advisory - meaning the result of the vote is only to help the government make the final choice. 
 
 It usually depends on the country's history and constitution what sort of referendum/plebiscite is used.  In [[Switzerland]] a referendum is usually mandatory, because the people are seen as the source of the government's mandate (power) to govern. For example, during Switzerland's [[basic income]] campaign the country utilized a national referendum for the polling. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2016/06/switzerlands-basic-income-referendum-a-retrospective/|title=Switzerland's Basic Income Referendum: A Retrospective {{!}} Basic Income News|date=2016-06-05|newspaper=BIEN|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-US|archive-date=2017-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913154633/http://basicincome.org/news/2016/06/switzerlands-basic-income-referendum-a-retrospective/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] referendums have only been advisory, because the government says that the people elected to [[Parliament]] make the decisions. The [[Scottish independence referendum|referendum on the independence of Scotland]] was an exception. It ''was'' legally binding, but it was not a referendum of the UK electorate. It was restricted to present residents of Scotland. 
 
 An example of a proposed plebiscite was the 2011 decision by [[Greece|Greek]] Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] to let the Greek people vote on whether the heavily indebted nation would accept a â‚¬130 billion bailout package from the [[European Union]]. The idea shocked [[eurozone]] nations, as a  " no "  vote could mean [[Greece]] defaulting on its national debt, and leaving the European Union and the [[eurozone]]. However, the vote was cancelled.  
 
 Another example was the voting on the European Constitution in 2005. The vote took place in some countries. [[France]] and [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] had a ''referendum'' on the subject. In both states, the voters said no to the proposal and no constitution was made.  
 
 The separate simultaneous referendums held on 24 April 2004 in the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] and the [[Republic of Cyprus]] on the comprehensive settlement plan of the UN Secretary-General provides yet another example of such a vote. The Plan was approved in the Turkish Cypriot referendum by 65%, while it was rejected in the Greek Cypriot referendum by 75%. 
 
 == Problems with referendums == 
 Many political problems can be solved by asking the people their opinion because the supporters of the argument will be forced to accept the decision of the people. However: 
 
 * It is feared that the electorate do not have sufficient political knowledge to truly understand what they are voting for 
 
 * Philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Madison]] < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://mises.org/wire/why-james-madison-hated-democracy|title=Why James Madison Hated Democracy|last=Ryan|date=2017-12-01|newspaper=Mises Institute|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}} < /ref >  thought voters are too easily persuaded by their own internal feelings of a matter instead of focusing on the good of the nation. That is to say they vote selfishly.
