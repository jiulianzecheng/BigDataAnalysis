 This results in [[muscular weakness]].  " Myopathy "  simply means muscle disease ([[Greek language|Greek]] myo-  " muscle "  + patheia  <  [[pathos|-pathy]]  " suffering " ). This meaning implies that the primary defect is within the muscle, as opposed to the nerves ( " [[neuropathies]] "  or  " [[neurogenic]] "  disorders) or elsewhere (e.g., the brain). [[Muscle cramp]]s, [[stiffness]], and [[spasm]] can also be associated with myopathy. 
 
 '''Muscular disease''' can be classified as [[Neuromuscular disease|neuromuscular]] or [[Musculoskeletal disorders|musculoskeletal]] in nature. Some conditions, such as [[myositis]], can be considered both neuromuscular and musculoskeletal.
