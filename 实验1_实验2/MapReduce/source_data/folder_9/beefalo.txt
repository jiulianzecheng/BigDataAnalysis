 The '''beefalo''' is a [[fertility|fertile]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of domestic [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus''), usually a male in managed breeding programs, and the [[American bison]] (''Bison bison''), usually a female in managed breeding programs. < ref name= " Porter2008 " > {{cite book|last=Porter|first=Valerie|title=The Field Guide to Cattle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6CSqgpIC0YC & pg=PA70|access-date=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-3192-7|page=70}} < /ref > < ref name= " Drew et al 1989 " > {{cite book|last1=Drew|first1=K.

 Beefalo are primarily cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full Beefalo as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called  " bison hybrids " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Breeds - Beefalo|url=https://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/97/beefalo/|access-date=2020-10-29|website=The Cattle Site|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Accidental crosses were noticed as long ago as 1749 in the Southern states of North America, during British colonization. Cattle and bison were first intentionally [[Crossbreed|crossbred]] during the mid-19th century. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Dafoe|first1=John W.|title=Domestication of the Buffalo|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=April 1889|volume=34|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_34/April_1889/Domestication_of_the_Buffalo|access-date=21 March 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 The first deliberate attempts to cross breed bison with cattle was made by Colonel Samuel Bedson, warden of [[Stony Mountain Institution|Stoney Mountain Penitentiary]], [[Winnipeg]], in 1880. Bedson bought eight bison from a captive herd of James McKay and inter-bred them with [[shorthorn|Durham cattle]]. The hybrids raised by Bedson were described by naturalist [[Ernest Thompson Seton]]: < ref name= " Brower2008 " > {{cite book|last=Brower|first=Jennifer|title=Lost Tracks: National Buffalo Park, 1909-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGA2K51m_YQC & pg=PA132|access-date=14 May 2015|year=2008|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=978-1-897425-10-7|pages=132–133}} < /ref > 
 {{quote|''The hybrid animal is [claimed] to be a great improvement on both of its progenitors, as it is more docile and a better milker than the Buffalo, but retains its hardihood, while the robe is finer, darker and more even, and the general shape of the animal is improved by the reduction of the hump and increased proportion of the hind-quarters.''}} 
 
 After seeing thousands of cattle die in a Kansas blizzard in 1886, [[Charles  " Buffalo "  Jones]], a co-founder of [[Garden City, Kansas|Garden City]], [[Kansas]], also worked to cross bison and cattle at a ranch near the future [[Grand Canyon National Park]], with the hope the animals could survive the harsh winters. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/portraits/jones_charles.htm |title=Charles Jesse  " Buffalo "  Jones |publisher=Kshs.org |access-date=2009-10-02}} < /ref >   He called the result  " cattalo "  in 1888. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |title=The Story of Cattalo |publisher=canadiangeographic.ca |date=May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901164141/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/jf05/indepth/ |archive-date=2005-09-01 }} < /ref >  [[Mossom Martin Boyd]] of [[Bobcaygeon]], [[Ontario]] first started the practice in Canada, publishing about some of his outcomes in the Journal of Heredity. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.

 It was found early on that crossing a male bison with a domestic cow would produce few offspring, but that crossing a domestic bull with a bison cow apparently solved the problem. The female offspring proved fertile, but rarely so for the males. Although the cattalo performed well, the mating problems meant the breeder had to maintain a herd of wild and difficult-to-handle bison cows.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} 
 
 In 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana produced a hybrid bull that was fertile.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World Beefalo Association and began marketing the hybrids as a new breed. The new name, Beefalo, was meant to separate this hybrid from the problems associated with the old cattalo hybrids.  The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths ''Bos taurus'' and at most three-eighths ''Bison bison''. 
 
 == Nutrition characteristics== 
 A [[United States Department of Agriculture]] study found Beefalo meat, like bison meat, is lower in [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]] than regular beef cattle. < ref name =aba > [http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/beefalo-facts-zmaz81mazraw.aspx Beefalo Facts] < /ref > 
 
 == Registration == 
 In 1983, the three main Beefalo registration groups reorganized under the American Beefalo World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two Beefalo associations, the American Beefalo World Registry < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.abwr.org |title=ABWR |publisher=ABWR |access-date=2009-10-02| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091012195541/http://www.abwr.org/| archive-date= 12 October 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref >  and American Beefalo International. These organizations jointly formed the American Beefalo Association, Inc., which currently operates as the registering body for Beefalo in the United States. < ref name= " AmerBeefAssoc " > {{cite web|url=http://www.americanbeefalo.org/|title=American Beefalo Association |access-date=14 May 2015}} < /ref >

 Dr. Dirk Van Vuren, formerly of the University of Kansas, however, points out that  " The bison today that carry cattle DNA look exactly like bison, function exactly like bison and in fact are bison.

 == Cattalo == 
 
 The term  " cattalo "  is defined by United States law as a cross of bison and cattle which have a bison appearance. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |title=Code of Federal Regulations (9CFR352.1) rev 2004. & nbsp;—  " Catalo or Cattalo means any hybrid animal with American bison appearance resulting from direct crossbreeding of American bison and cattle. "  |publisher=Access.gpo.gov |access-date=2009-10-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826093000/http://www.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/cfrassemble.cgi?title=200409 |archive-date=August 26, 2009 }} < /ref >  In [[Canada]], however, the term is used for hybrids of all degrees and appearance.{{fact|date=October 2020}} 
 
 In some American states, cattalo are regulated as  " exotic animals " , along with pure bison and [[deer]]. However, in most states, bison and hybrids which are raised solely for livestock (meat and sale) purposes similar to cattle, are considered domestic animals like cattle, and do not require special permits.{{cn|date=August 2020}}
