The musicians [[improvisation|improvise]] using a small group of chords which are repeated again and again. [[Charlie Parker]] ([[1920]]-[[1955]]), who was  famous for his [[saxophone]] playing, was a bebop artist. The famous trumpet player [[Dizzy Gillespie]] ([[1917]]-[[1993]]) was also a renowned artist of this genre.
