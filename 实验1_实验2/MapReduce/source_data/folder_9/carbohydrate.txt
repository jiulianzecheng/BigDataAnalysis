 '''Carbohydrates''' are [[chemical compound]]s that contain ''only'' [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]]. They are made up of joined-up [[sugar]]s. Sugars have the general formula C < sub > m < /sub > (H < sub > 2 < /sub > O) < sub > n < /sub > , and are also known as '''saccharides.''' 
 
 Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of [[energy]] in most [[organism]]s, including [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. 
 
 == Biochemistry == 
 There are four types of carbohydrates, named by the number of sugar molecules they contain. 
 # Simple saccharides with one or two sugar molecules 
 ## [[Monosaccharide]]s: single sugar e.g. [[glucose]], [[fructose]] < ref > {{Cite web|title=Monosaccharides - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/monosaccharides|access-date=2021-06-03|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref > 
 ## [[Disaccharide]]s: two saccharides. e.g. [[sucrose]], [[lactose]], [[maltose]] 
 # Longer chain saccharides: 
 ## [[Oligosaccharide]]s (shortish chains), often linked to [[amino acid]]s or [[lipid]]s. They play a special role in [[cell membrane]]s. 
 ## [[Polysaccharide]]s (long chains) are complex carbohydrates, with linear chains of sugars or branched clusters. Their function is either energy storage ([[starch]], [[glycogen]]) or building structures ([[cellulose]], [[chitin]]). 
 
 == Nutrition and foods == 
 Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body. [[Protein]] builds tissue and cells in the body. Carbohydrates are very good for energy, but, if a person eats more than needed, the extra is changed into [[fat]] through a process called [[de novo lipogenesis]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2014-07-01|title=De novo lipogenesis in health and disease|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026049514001115|journal=Metabolism|language=en|volume=63|issue=7|pages=895–902|doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2014.04.003|issn=0026-0495|last1=Ameer|first1=Fatima|last2=Scandiuzzi|first2=Lisa|last3=Hasnain|first3=Shahida|last4=Kalbacher|first4=Hubert|last5=Zaidi|first5=Nousheen|pmid=24814684}} < /ref > 
 
 If necessary, humans can live without eating carbohydrates because the human body can change fats and proteins into carbohydrates through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Manninen|first=Anssi H|date=2004-12-31|title=Metabolic Effects of the Very-Low-Carbohydrate Diets: Misunderstood  " Villains "  of Human Metabolism|journal=Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition|volume=1|issue=2|pages=7–11|doi=10.1186/1550-2783-1-2-7|issn=1550-2783|pmc=2129159|pmid=18500949}} < /ref >  Some already stored glucose in the liver can be released through another process called [[glycogenolysis]]. People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates, but they still remain healthy, such as the [[Inuit|Inuits]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Husten|first=Larry|date=2016-07-29|title=Changes In Eskimo Diet Linked To Increase In Heart Disease|url=http://www.cardiobrief.org/2016/07/29/changes-in-eskimo-diet-linked-to-increase-in-heart-disease/|access-date=2021-05-07|website=CardioBrief|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Research in the United States and Canada have shown that people get about 40% to 60% of their energy from carbohydrates (mostly from refined carbohydrates). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Americans Are Still Eating Too Many 'Bad' Carbs|url=https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190924/americans-are-still-eating-too-many-bad-carbs|access-date=2021-05-07|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref >  The amount of energy needs may depend on the amount of physical work done by people: the harder the work, the more energy they need. The other need for energy is body temperature. Living in a cold climate means a person needs more energy. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Ocobock|first=Cara|date=December 2016|title=Human energy expenditure, allocation, and interactions in natural temperate, hot, and cold environments|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27561011/|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=161|issue=4|pages=667–675|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23071|issn=1096-8644|pmid=27561011}} < /ref > 
 
 Some foods (especially grains) have high levels of carbohydrates including [[Wheat|wheat products]] ([[bread]], [[pasta]], [[potato]]es, [[cereal]]s), [[rice]], etc.
