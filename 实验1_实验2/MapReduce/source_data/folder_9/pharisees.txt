 '''Pharisees''' were [[Jewish]] leaders who composed and enforced [[halakha|religious law]] at a certain period in Jewish history. At times, the Pharisees were a [[political party]], a [[social movement]], and a school of thought. After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 [[AD]], Pharisaic beliefs became the foundation for [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. The term '[[Judaism]]' today almost always refers to Rabbinic Judaism. 
 
 [[Paul of Tarsus]], disciple of [[Jesus]], was a Pharisee before he became a [[Christianity|Christian]].
