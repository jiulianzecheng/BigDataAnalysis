'''''Ferrodraco lentoni''''',   " Lenton's Iron Dragon " , is a [[species]] of [[pterosaur]]. The only known [[fossil]] of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of [[Winton, Queensland]], [[Australia]]. < ref name=abc > Larkins, Damien, and Lyons, Susannah, 'A new pterosaur, or prehistoric flying reptile species, has been discovered in outback Queensland', ABC News, 4 October 2019, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-04/new-pterosaur-flying-reptile-discovered-outback-queensland/11571756, accessed 4 October 2019 < /ref > < ref name=nature/ >   
 
 The pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. < ref name=abc/ >  The name, ''Ferrodraco lentoni'', comes from the [[Latin]] word, ''ferrum'' ([[iron]]), for the [[ironstone]] in which the fossil was found, and ''draco'', the Latin word for [[dragon]]. < ref name=nature/ >  The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. < ref name=nature/ >   
 
 Only small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. ''Ferrodraco'' is the most complete specimen found. < ref name=abc/ >  Scientists have been able to identify five [[vertebrae]], eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. < ref name=abc/ >  They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. < ref name=abc/ >  That is in the [[Upper Cretaceous]].  
 
 The fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. < ref name=abc/ >  This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. < ref name=abc/ >  Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. < ref name=nature > Pentland, Adele, and others, 'Ferrodraco lentoni gen. et sp. nov., a new ornithocheirid pterosaur from the Winton Formation (Cenomanianâ€“lower Turonian) of Queensland, Australia', Scientific reports, Nature.com, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49789-4, accessed 4 October 2019 < /ref >   
 
 Winton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here. < ref name=abc/ >
