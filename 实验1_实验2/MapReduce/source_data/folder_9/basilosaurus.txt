 '''Basilosaurus''' is a genus of [[cetacean]] that lived from 40 to 34 million years ago in the Late [[Eocene]]. The first ''Basilosaurus'' fossils were found in [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]], but another species was soon discovered preserved in large numbers in the [[Fayum]] deposits of [[Egypt]]. 
 
 The first fossil of ''B. cetoides'' was discovered in the [[United States]] and was initially believed to be some sort of reptile, hence the suffix - " saurus " , but it was later found to be a marine mammal. < ref name= " bbc " > {{Cite web | title = Basilosaurus | publisher = BBC Nature | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/seamonsters/factfiles/basilosaurus.shtml | accessdate = 10 September 2014 | archive-date = 21 September 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100921083651/http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/seamonsters/factfiles/basilosaurus.shtml | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  [[Richard Owen]] wanted to rename the creature '''''Zeuglodon''''' ( " yoked tooth " ), but by taxonomic rules the creature's first name remained permanent.

 Far from being a marine reptile, ''Basilosaurus'' is a stage in the [[evolution of whales]]. At 15–20 & nbsp;m (49–66 & nbsp;ft), ''Basilosaurus'' was one of the largest oceanic animals of its time. < ref > {{cite journal|year=2012|title=Evolution of Whales from Land to Sea|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=156|issue=3|pages=309–323|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23558092| last1 = Gingerich | first1 = P.
