 '''Goldfinch''' are [[finch]]es of the [[genus]] '''''Carduelis'''''. They are small [[passerine]] birds of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fringillidae]]. < ref > Clement P; Harris A.  &  Davis J. 1993. ''Finches  &  sparrows''.

 The goldfinch breeds across [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and western and central [[Asia]], in open, partially wooded lowlands. It is resident in the milder west of its range, but [[bird migration|migrates]] from colder regions. It will also make local movements, even in the west, to escape bad weather. It has been introduced to many areas of the world. < ref > Snow D.W.  &  Perrins C.M. 1998. ''The birds of the western palearctic''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-854099-X}}. < /ref > 
 
 The goldfinch's preferred food is small [[seed]]s such as those from [[thistle]]s and [[Dipsacus|teasels]], but insects are also taken when feeding young. It also regularly visits bird feeders in winter. They nest in the outer twigs of tall leafy trees, or even in bamboo, laying four to six [[egg (biology)|egg]]s which hatch in 11â€“14 days. 
 
 In the winter goldfinches group together to form flocks of up to forty birds, occasionally more. The song is a pleasant silvery twittering.
