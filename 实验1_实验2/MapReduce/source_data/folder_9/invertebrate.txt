 An '''invertebrate''' is an [[animal]] that does not have a [[spinal column]] or ''backbone''. This contrasts with [[vertebrate]]: if an animal is not a vertebrate ([[fish]], [[reptile]], [[amphibian]], [[bird]], or [[mammal]]), it is an invertebrate. 
 
 The main [[phyla]] (groups) of invertebrate animals are: 
 * [[Annelida]]: [[segmented]] worms  
 * [[Arthropod]]s: ([[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and others); the largest groups of invertebrates. 
 * [[Brachiopod]]s: the lamp-shells. 
 * [[Bryozoa]]: sea mats or moss animals (sometimes they look like [[coral]]s) 
 * [[Cnidaria]]ns: [[jellyfish]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[hydroid]]s. 
 * [[Echinoderm]]s: [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s 
 * [[Mollusc]]s: ([[gastropod]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[bivalve]]s and others); a large group of invertebrates. 
 * [[Nematoda]]: [[roundworm]]s 
 * [[Porifera]]: [[sponge]]s 
 * [[Platyhelminthes]]: [[flatworm]]s 
 * [[Rotifers]]: tiny  " wheel animals " , which live in habitats such as pond water. 
 
 Insects and other [[arthropod]]s have no bones, but they have a [[skeleton]] on the outside of their bodies, called an [[exoskeleton]].  
 
 There are 18 more groups of invertebrates, mostly minor: see [[List of animal phyla]].
