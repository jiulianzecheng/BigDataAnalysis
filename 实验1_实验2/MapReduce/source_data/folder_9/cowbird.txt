 '''Cowbirds''' are birds of the [[genus]] ''Molothrus''. They are [[brood parasite]]s, similar in life-style to the [[Cuckoo]]. The entire [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Icteridae]] is limited to the [[New World]]. 
 
 They lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. The birds whose nest is used by the cowbird is tricked into raising the young cowbirds. < ref name= " osford " >  Mermoz, Myriam E. and Francisco Oralis, Juan 2004.

 These birds feed on [[insect]]s, including those stirred up by [[cattle]]. They lay their eggs in other birds' nests. This means that the birds can more easily stay with the herd. < ref name=Mafia > {{cite web

 == Mafia-type behaviour == 
 It seems that Brown-headed Cowbirds periodically check on their eggs and young after they have deposited them. Removal of the parasitic egg may trigger a retaliatory reaction termed '[[mafia]] behaviour'. Cowbirds may penalise hosts which remove the cowbird egg: they often destroy the eggs or nestlings of those hosts. < ref name=Mafia/ > 
 : " Central to the persistence of mafia-type behavior in brood parasites and acceptance in hosts is the fact that hosts produce significantly more offspring by accepting parasitism rather than ejecting parasitic eggs " . < ref name=Mafia/ >
