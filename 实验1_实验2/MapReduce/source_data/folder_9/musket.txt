 A '''musket''' is a [[Muzzleloader|muzzleloading]], [[smoothbore]] [[firearm]], which is meant to be fired from the [[shoulder]].  
 
 The musket is the weapon that replaced the [[arquebus]], and was then replaced by the [[rifle]]. But the word ''musket'' is also used to describe a number of different weapons including: 
 * a long, heavy weapon with a [[matchlock]] or [[wheellock]] and [[gunpowder|loose powder]] fired with the [[gun barrel]] resting on a stand 
 * a lighter weapon with a [[flintlock]] or [[percussion cap]] firing mechanism, with a [[bayonet]].  
 
 Muskets were made for use by [[infantry]]. A soldier armed with a musket was called a '''musketman''' or '''musketeer'''. In the 1500's, soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus, called a musket, supported the [[arquebusiers]] and the [[pikemen]]. By the start of 1700's, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the [[united States]] was the [[Springfield Model 1795 Musket]]. < ref name=milfact > {{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=375 |title=Harpers Ferry / Springfield Model 1795 Musket (1795) |author= |website= |publisher=The Military Factory |accessdate=4 August 2016}} < /ref >  In the 1800's, better [[ammunition]] and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the [[rifled musket]] became common. A few years later, the use of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], [[breechloading]], and [[repeating rifle|multiple rounds of ammunition]] meant the  " rifled musket "  gave way to the [[rifle]], and  " muskets "  were no longer used. 
 
 Musket [[calibre]]s ranged from {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} to {{convert|0.8|in|mm}}. A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only [[wikt:accurate|accurate]] to about {{convert|50|yd|m}} to {{convert|70|yd|m}}. Rifled muskets in the 1850's were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to {{convert|500|yd|m}}. < ref > " Arms and Equipment of the Civil War "  By Jack Coggins, Published by Courier Dover Publications, 2004 < /ref >  The advantage of this longer distance was shown at the [[Battle of Four Lakes]], where [[Springfield Model 1855]] rifled muskets killed Indian warriors before they could get close enough with their smoothbore muskets. < ref > " Gunsmoke and Saddle Leather: Firearms in the Nineteenth-century American West "  by Charles G.
