 '''Televangelism''' is the use of modern mass media such as [[television]] or [[radio]] to speak of the [[faith]]. Usually this is done to convince other people of one's own beliefs. It is common with [[Christianity]] but also occurs with other religions. The word is a made up of [[television]] and [[evangelism]]. The [[term]] was started by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]''. < ref > ''Time: 75th Anniversary'' issue, March 9, 1998. < /ref >  Today it is also used for preachers who use modern mass media, such as radio, or the internet to spread the [[gospel]]. 
 
 Please note, that televangelism is different from watching a Christian mass (or other religious programme, for example, the [[blessing]]s [[Urbi et Orbi]] of the [[Pope]]) on television, or other media.

 Televangelists often give speeches, or sermons. There they tell about the good news, and they ask people to do specific things. Most often, they want donations either for their organisation, or for a specific cause. Most televangelists make a connection between wonders or [[miracle]]s, and the [[donation]]s of the faithful. What they preach is a form of [[prosperity theology]], and this connection is a defining characteristic. 
 
 In Christianity, televangelists often have positions that are close to those of the [[Charismatic Movement]], or of [[Pentecostalism]]. 
 
 == In Islam ==

 Televangelism also exists in [[Islam]]. There, the people are either [[Salafi]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims, or they are [[Shiite]]s or [[Alevite]]s.

 Harun Yahya is an [[Turkish people|Turkish]] Islamic televangelist who has [[Creationism|creationist]] ideas. Politically, his ideas are close to the [[Gülen movement]]. He has a very modern interpretation; in his broadcasts, he also shows women with few clothes, which is unusual for the Islamic world. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-inside-the-muslim-sex-cult-whose-leader-is-embraced-by-israeli-figures-1.5961420|title=Orgies, blackmail and anti-Semitism: Inside the Islamic cult whose leader is embraced by Israeli figures|website=Haaretz.com|language=en|access-date=2020-07-05}} < /ref > 
 
 == Criticism == 
 Televangelism has also been critiziced: Conservative Christian theologian John Mc Arthur wrote:  < blockquote > „Someone needs to say this plainly: The faith healers and health-and-wealth preachers who dominate religious television are shameless frauds. Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy.
