 '''Blasphemy''' is a word that means ''speaking badly about a [[religion]]'', or ''[[insult]]ing a [[god]]''. Some religions see blasphemy as a religious crime. Many countries witha [[state religion]] have [[laws]] that make blasphemy a [[crime]]. For example, blasphemy can be punished with the [[death penalty]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] or [[Pakistan]]. In other countries, the punishment for the crime is a [[fine]], or [[prison|imprisonment]]. 
 
 Some countries do not have laws against blasphemy. For example, after the [[French Revolution]], [[France]] made blasphemy legal to make sure people would have [[freedom of religion]] and the [[freedom of the press]]. 
 
 The [[United States]], [[Canada]], and many [[Europe]]an countries, have laws to protect people who speak badly about religion. Sometimes people do this in a [[satirical]] way, like with a [[movie]] that makes fun of a religion. In these countries, [[profanity]] is often protected by [[freedom of speech]] as well.
