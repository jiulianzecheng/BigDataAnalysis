It was originally available on [[Microsoft Windows]], but different ports are available on the [[Xbox Live]], [[Playstation]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Windows Phone]], and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]].

 == Gameplay == 
 It is a wide-open sandbox style game; players may edit the terrain and go anywhere they want to. 
 
 There are a wide variety of materials (Called ''blocks'' or ''tiles'') that players can use, such as Dirt Blocks, Stone Blocks, Copper [[Ore]], Wood, and many more. Players need the right tools to mine any block.   
 
 The game begins with the player creating a custom character, and then is placed in a computer-generated world. The players begins with only a few Copper tools, which are used to gather wood, mine blocks, and attack monsters. From these basic Copper tools, the player moves up to stronger armor and weapons. There are many bosses in Terraria that the player must defeat. Although Terraria might seem similar to [[Minecraft]], it is [[2D|two dimensional]] and includes many more items and bosses.  
 
 === Soundtrack === 
 In Terraria, the music changes depending on which biome/area the player is in. It can also change if the player is fighting a boss, like the Eye of [[Cthulhu]] for example.
