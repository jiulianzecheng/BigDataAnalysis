 A '''minbar''' (also called '''mimbar''' sometimes, {{lang-ar|منبر}}) is a special place in a [[mosque]]. It is used by the [[Imam]] to speak to the congregation, to deliver [[sermon]]s. Usually, minbars are raised (to be higher than the crowd, much like [[pulpit]]s); These sermons are usually called ''[[khutbah]]'' ( خطبه ). In a minbar, the speaker is standing while he is giving the lecture. An alternative to this is to have a [[Hussainia]] where the speaker can sit down while giving the lecture.  
 
 Very often, the minbar is shaped like a small tower. The minbar is located to the right of the [[mihrab]], the niche that indicates the direction of prayer (i.e. towards [[Mecca]]).
