[[File:Corncobs.jpg|thumb|Maize is an example of a cultigen]] 
 
 A '''cultigen''' is a [[plant]] that is the result of [[artificial selection]] by [[human]]s. [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], an American [[botany|botanist]] was the first to use the term, in 1918. < ref > Bailey L.H. 1918. The indigen and cultigen. ''Science'' series 2, '''47''':306-308 < /ref >  Bailey noticed that the classification [[Linné]] introduced for plants was not useful for classifying plants which came from human cultivation and selection. He called the plants which grow in the wild without human selection [[indigen]]s. A cultigen was:  < blockquote > "  ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown...  [It has] such characters as to separate it from known indigens, and is probably not represented by any [[type specimen]] or exact description " .  < /blockquote >  The point is that a cultigen cannot always be placed in the traditional [[Taxonomy|Linnean]] system of botanical [[Biological classification|classification]]. 
 
 Bailey later changed his definition to  " Plant or group known only in cultivation; presumably originating under [[domestication]]; contrast with indigen " , which is the definition used above. Examples of cultigens are [[maize]] and [[cabbage]]. 
 
 == Cultigens and cultivars == 
 Cultigen and [[cultivar]] may be confused with one-another. Cultigen is a general-purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well (see introductory text above). Cultivar is a formal classification category in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP). 
 
 Although in his 1923 paper Bailey used only the rank of [[species]] for the cultigen, it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species and so he established a new classification category for these, the cultivar, generally assumed to be a contraction of the words “cultivated” and “variety”. < ref > Trehane P. 2004. 50 years of the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants''. ''Acta Horticulturae'' '''634''': 17-27. < /ref >  He defined cultivar in his 1923 paper as:  < blockquote > 
  ...  " a race subordinate to species, that has originated and persisted under cultivation; it is not necessarily, however, referable to a recognised botanical species. It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin " .

 This definition and understanding of cultivar has changed over time. 
   
 == Definition of cultigen == 
 The definition has been discussed: 
 *The selection process is called artificial if humans cause it. This does not mean humans are not part of nature, it is simply a way to distinguish [[natural selection]] from human-influenced (artificial selection) 
 *What is the meaning of ''altered''? The whole [[flora]] is changing because of [[climate change]], which humans inflenced, yet no one would say that all the plants changing because of climate change are cultigens. 
 *Some plants are used in gardens or parks. They are the same that those that occur in nature. 
 *There may be [[gene flow]] from a cultigen that ''escaped'' into the wild and an indigen. There may be a practical problem of how to name such plants.  
 *Some plants have an unknown origin; it is therefore impossible to say if they are cultigens. 
 *Some crossings that are used in cultivation, may also occur in the wild. This makes the classification problematic.
