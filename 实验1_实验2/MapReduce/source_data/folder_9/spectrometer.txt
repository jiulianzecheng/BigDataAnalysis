 A '''spectrometer''' is an [[Optics|optical]] instrument used to measure properties of [[light]] over a specific portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. 
 
 The independent variable is usually the [[wavelength]] of the light.  
 The variable measured is most often the light's [[intensity]] but could also, for instance, be the [[polarization]] state. A spectrometer is used in [[spectroscopy]] for producing [[spectral line]]s and measuring their [[wavelength]]s and intensities.  Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths, from [[gamma ray]]s and [[X-ray]]s into the [[far infrared]]. 
 
 In general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at [[microwave]], [[radio]], and [[sound|audio]] frequencies), the [[spectrum analyzer]] is a closely related electronic device. 
 
 ==Spectroscopes== 
 Spectrometers are used in [[spectroscopic analysis]] to identify materials. Spectroscopes are used often in [[astronomy]] and some branches of [[chemistry]].  Early spectroscopes were simply a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] with graduations marking wavelengths of light. Modern spectroscopes, such as [[monochromator]]s, generally use a [[diffraction grating]], a movable slit, and some kind of [[photodetector]], all automated and controlled by a [[computer]].  The spectroscope was invented by [[Gustav Robert Georg Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]].
