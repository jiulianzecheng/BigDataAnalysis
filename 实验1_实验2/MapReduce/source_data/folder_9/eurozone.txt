 The '''Eurozone''' (also called '''Euro area''' or '''Euroland''') is the set of countries in the [[European Union]] which have adopted the [[Euro]] (â‚¬) currency. The [[European Central Bank]] is responsible for managing the supply of money within the eurozone and political decisions are taken by the  " euro group " , which is a meeting of the politicians from each euro country in charge of that country's [[economy]]. 
 
 EU members that are not part of the Eurozone are [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Romania]].
