 A '''dictionary''' is a type of [[book]] which explains the meanings of [[word]]s or, more precisely, [[lexeme]]s. The words are arranged in [[alphabetical order]] so that they can be found quickly. The word  " dictionary "  comes from the [[Latin]]  " dictio "  ( " saying " ). 
 
 There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which [[Translation|translate]] words from one [[language]] to another, dictionaries of [[biography]] which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular [[subject (school)|subject]] (sometimes called a [[thesaurus]]). Some of these come close to being an [[encyclopedia]], but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things ([[knowledge]]) and does not explain the use of the language. An encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does, but more than a simple dictionary. 
 
 == Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words == 
 === Online dictionaries ===

 Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear  " definition "  of the word (e.g. '''''hippopotamus''''' : a [[hoof]]ed [[mammal]] with thick [[skin]], large [[mouth]] and short [[leg]]s that lives in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s of [[Africa]].) 
 
 A big dictionary will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is [[pronunciation|pronounced]]. Usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like  " hippopotamus " , but a word like  " put "  has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain the [[Etymology|origin of the word]] (e.g. Greek  " hippos "  horse and  " potamus "  river). 
 
 A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[plural]] form etc. 
 
 == Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages == 
 There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Often one volume (one book) will translate both ways; for example, half the book might be translating from English to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the other half from Dutch to English. 
 
 When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like  " right "  has two basic meanings in English: 1)  " correct " , and 2) the opposite of  " left " . Other languages  have different words for these different meanings, but they have [[homonym]]s of their own. A word like  " put "  has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word “put” will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard). 
 
 == Updating dictionaries ==

 Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of [[computer]] terms) or words change their meanings (e.g.  " gay "  or  " cool " ). In this sense, the most famous English Dictionary is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED. They are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed [[online]] (with a [[subscription]]).
