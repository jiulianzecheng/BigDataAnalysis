The '''Developmentalism''' is an economic theory. It says that the best way for [[third world]] countries to develop is through a strong and varied internal market and by having high [[tariff]]s on imported goods. 
 
 Developmentalism is based on the assumptions that: 
 *There are similar stages to development for all countries. 
 *There is movement from one stage to another. This movement goes from traditional or primitive to modern or industrialized. < ref > Smith, Tony  " Requiem or New Agenda for Third World Studies? "  World Politics, Vol. 37, No. 4 (Jul., 1985), pp.537 < /ref >
