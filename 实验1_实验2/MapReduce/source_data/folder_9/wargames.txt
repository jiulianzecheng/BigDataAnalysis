 David Lightman (Broderick) is a smart [[high school]] student and [[computer]] [[hacker]] that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) [[grade]]s from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not [[motivation|motivated]] at school. A little while later David uses his [[IMSAI 8080]] computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a [[backdoor (programming)|backdoor]] into a [[NORAD]] [[war game]]s simulation computer called [[WOPR]] ([[nickname]]d the ''Whopper''). At first David is looking for new computer games to [[download]] and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an [[Artificial Intelligence]] computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls  " Joshua " ) asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game  " Global Thermonuclear War " . Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into [[World War III]] unless it is stopped. 
 
 The television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies  " what is the difference? "  At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and taken to [[NORAD]] to answer charges of [[espionage]]. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using [[Phreaking]] skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Jennifer meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III. 
 
 Professor Falken has in fact [[wikt:resign|resigned]] from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last [[ferry]] has left, Jennifer says that they should  " swim for it " . David admits he cannot swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD. 
 
 Inside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the [[Soviet Union]] has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word  " games " . After many tries they get Joshua to play [[tic-tac-toe]] against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of {{broken wikt link|futility|futility}} (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every [[wikt:scenario|scenario]] within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.
