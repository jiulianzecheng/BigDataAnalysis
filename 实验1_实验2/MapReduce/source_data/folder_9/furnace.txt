A '''Furnace''' is a device used for [[heat]]ing. It does this through burning [[propane]], [[natural gas]], other something else flammable. The word has different meanings, though: 
 * In [[American English]], it is the name for a heating system in the [[house]]. [[British English]] usually calls such systems [[boiler]], [[heater]] or [[kiln]]. 
 * There are industrial furnaces; these provide heat so some processes can take place. An example of such a furnace would be the use in [[metallurgy|metallurgic]] processing. [[Blast furnace]]s for example make [[iron]].
