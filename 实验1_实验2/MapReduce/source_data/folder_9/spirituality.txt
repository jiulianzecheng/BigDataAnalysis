 '''Spirituality''' is a name given to matters of the [[spirit]]. These can be any kind of meaningful personal activity or peaceful experience. There is not one agreed upon way to explain what happens. It is a [[concept]] so people can see and understand it in different ways. Some people believe spirituality is a part of [[religion]]. Others who are not [[religious]], still seek and have [[spiritual]] [[experiences]].

 " Matters of the spirit "  may include the meaning in a person's life (or in all life), and how to find and improve on it. They may also include someone's search for [[God]], the [[supernatural]], a [[divine]] [[:wikt:influence|influence]] in their lives, or information about the [[afterlife]], and how to best deal with each.  " Matters of the spirit "  may also include how to live among others as a group, or in a certain [[environment]].

 Some who do not believe in an organized [[religion]] may still be interested in the  " spirits "  of [[Human race|humanity]] or of [[nature]] and live a certain way, or [[worship]] [[ancestor]]s or [[creation]] because it gives them a sense of [[happiness]] to do so. This is referred to as spiritual but not religious. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Lipka|first1=Michael|last2=Gecewicz|first2=Claire|title=More Americans now say they're spiritual but not religious|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/06/more-americans-now-say-theyre-spiritual-but-not-religious/|access-date=2021-10-16|website=Pew Research Center|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Another common usage refers to people who ascribe to ideals  " greater than themselves.
