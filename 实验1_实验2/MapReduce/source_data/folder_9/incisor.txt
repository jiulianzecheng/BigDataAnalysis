 '''Incisors''' are special kinds of [[tooth|teeth]] that can be found in some [[mammals]], such as [[humans]]. They are the eight large flat  teeth with straight edges that are at the front of a person's mouth, in between the [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]], which are pointed. The straight edges of the ''incisors'' are useful for biting because they cut sharply. They come together like a pair of [[pincers]]. In a human, the two teeth at the middle of each [[jaw]] are called the  " central incisors " , and the side ones are the  " lateral incisors " . (lateral means  " to the side " ). Some humans never grow  " lateral incisors "  or have very small ones, particularly at the top. 
 
 In many mammalian [[herbivore]]s (plant-eaters) these front teeth are used to cut off stems of grass and other growing things, that are then ground up by the [[molar]]s at the back of the mouth. Some [[omnivore]]s (animals that eat both plants and meat), like humans, have incisors like herbivores. In [[carnivore]]s (meat-eating mammals) like [[cat]]s, the incisors are often quite small. The canine teeth are  long and suitable for grasping and stabbing. Carnivores use their incisors for many jobs that need find control, such as catching [[flea]]s, carrying a [[kitten]] or peeling the skin off a [[fish]]. If a dog or a member of the cat family needs to cut something with their teeth, they use their back teeth like [[scissors]].
