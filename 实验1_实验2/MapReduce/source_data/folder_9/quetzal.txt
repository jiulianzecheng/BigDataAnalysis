 A '''quetzal''' is a brightly colored bird in the [[trogon]] family. < ref > Restall R.L; Rodner C.  &  Lentino M. 2006. ''Birds of northern South America''. Christopher Helm. {{ISBN|0-7136-7243-9}} (vol 1); {{ISBN|0-7136-7242-0}} (vol 2). < /ref >  They are found in [[forests]] and [[woodlands]], especially in [[humid]] [[highlands]]. 
 
 These birds live in the [[Americas]]. The word  " quetzal "  was first used for the [[resplendent quetzal]], a famous long-tailed quetzal that lives in [[Central America]]. The resplendent quetzal is the national symbol of [[Guatemala]]. 
 
 They are strongly [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], as usual with the males being brighter. Parts of the female plumageis brown or grey. These largely solitary birds feed on fruits, berries, insects and small vertebrates (such as frogs). Even with their famous bright plumage, they can be hard to see in their natural wooded [[habitats]]. 
 
 In [[Aztec]] times, the quetzal was worshiped as the god of the air. Its long tail feathers, which can grow up to 2 & nbsp;ft (60 & nbsp;cm) long, were highly prized for making into costume and head-dresses. < ref > {{cite book|title=Jungle animals: over 100 questions and answers to things you want to know|last=Ganeri|first=Anita|year=2000|isbn=0-75254-909-X}} < /ref >
