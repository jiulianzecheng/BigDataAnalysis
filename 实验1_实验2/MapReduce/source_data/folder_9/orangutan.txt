 '''Orangutans''' (''Pongo'') are [[Hominidae|great apes]] belonging to the rainforests of [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. There are two [[species]] of orangutan. They are from [[Southeast Asia]]. There are very few of them left, because loss of the jungle has reduced their [[habitat]]. There are orangutans on view at the [[Singapore]] zoo.  
 
 The [[name]] orangutan comes from two [[Malay language|Malay]] words, ''orang'' which means ''[[person]]'', and ''hutan'' which means ''[[forest]]''; so orangutan means ''person of the forest''. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.orangutans-sos.org/kids/orangutan_facts |title=Orangutan Facts – |first= |last= |work=orangutans-sos.org |publisher=Sumatran Orangutan Society |year=2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011 |archive-date=23 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823062352/http://www.orangutans-sos.org/kids/orangutan_facts |url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 [[File:Homininae.svg|center|frame|[[Tree of life (biology)|Evolutionary tree]] of the superfamily [[Hominoidea]]. It highlights the subfamily Homininae. First the gibbons ([[Hylobatidae]]) split from the main line some 18 million years ago. Next, the subfamily [[Ponginae]] broke away—leading to the current orangutan. Later the Homininae split into the tribe [[Hominini]] (with subtribes Hominina and Panina), and the tribe [[Gorillini]]]] 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Orangutans have red-brown [[hair]]. They have long arms. They can be strong like [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[human]]s. They also have hands that are good for climbing. The ''Sumatran Orangutan'' is smaller and has longer hair than the ''[[Bornean orangutan]]''. Orangutans have suffered from forest loss and are on the very edge of [[extinction]]. 
 
 == Life == 
 Orangutans are from the [[rainforest]]s on the islands [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. They mostly live up in the [[tree]]s. They eat [[fruit]], [[leaves]] and [[bark]] and also [[insect]]s and [[bird]] [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. They drink water from rain that has been collected in leaves. Orangutans are not comfortable on the ground since they have to push themselves along with fists. Heavy adults move carefully through the trees, using their flexible feet to grasp the tree branches. Smaller orangutans swing with more ease. 
 
 == Diet == 
 An orangutan's diet consists mainly of fruit, they like ripe fruit. If they cannot find fruit they will eat bark, leaves and termites, rather than move to somewhere else to get food. About 60% of an orangutan's diet is fruit, 25% is leaves, 10% is bark and flowers, and 5% is termites and other insects. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.orangutanrepublik.org/faqs-mainmenu-28/20-about-orangutans/61-what-do-wild-orangutans-eat |title=What do Wild Orangutans Eat? |access-date=2015-11-26 |archive-date=2015-11-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107141738/http://www.orangutanrepublik.org/faqs-mainmenu-28/20-about-orangutans/61-what-do-wild-orangutans-eat |url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Pregnancy == 
 After a [[pregnancy]] of 230–260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby, but sometimes two, every eight to nine years. The little ones stay with their mother for years, riding on their mother's back and learning to move through the forest. The young orangutans are playful and affectionate. When they are five or six years old, they become more independent and eventually go off on their own. < ref > Blue Planet Level 5, written by Dinorah Pous p.70 < /ref >
