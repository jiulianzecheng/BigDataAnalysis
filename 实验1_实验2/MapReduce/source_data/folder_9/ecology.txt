 '''Ecology''' is the branch or aspect of [[biology]] that  studies the [[biota]] (living things), the [[environment]], and their interactions. It comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oikos'' = house; ''logos'' = study.  
 
 Ecology is the study of [[ecosystem]]s. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of [[biodiversity]], ecologists research everything from tiny [[bacteria]] in [[nutrient]] [[recycling]] to the effects of [[tropical]] [[rain forest]]s on the [[Earth's atmosphere]].  Scientists who study these interactions are called ''ecologists''.  
 
 [[Terrestrial ecoregion]] and [[climate change]] research are two areas where ecologists now focus. 
 
 There are many practical applications of ecology in [[conservation biology]], [[wetland]] management, [[natural resource]] management ([[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing|fisheries]]), [[city planning]] (urban ecology), community health, [[economics]], and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction. < ref > Omerod S.J. Pienkowski M.W.  &  Watkinson A.R. 1999. Communicating the value of ecology.

 == Population ecology == 
 {{See also|Overpopulation}} 
 [[File:Exponential Carrying Capacity.svg|thumb|A graph of a population which reaches carrying capacity]] 
 Population ecology measures the size of a [[population]]: all the living things from one [[species]] that live in an place. < ref name= " Starr " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57966041|title=Biology : concepts and applications|last=Starr|first=Cecie|date=2006|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|others=Christine A. Evers, Lisa Starr|isbn=0-534-46223-5|edition=6th|location=Belmont, CA|pages=|oclc=57966041}} < /ref > {{rp|5}} A population [[Population growth|gets bigger]] because of [[birth]] and movement into a place, and it gets smaller because of [[death]] and movement out of a place. Growth rate is the change in population size divided by the current population size. When a population is small, growth rate does not change, so the population shows [[exponential growth]].{{r|Starr|p=688-691}} Rate of exponential growth depends on how a living thing reproduces. If it has only a few [[offspring]] (children) which grow slowly, like a human, the rate will be low. If it has a lot of offspring which grow quickly, like a [[fruit fly]], the rate will be high. < ref name= " Freeman " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/472790415|title=Biological Science|last=Freeman|first=Scott|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn=978-0-321-59796-0|edition=4th|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=|oclc=472790415}} < /ref > {{rp|1042}} Any environment only has enough [[natural resource]]s, such as food, water, or space, for a certain size of population. This size is called the [[carrying capacity]]. When population size is near the carrying capacity, growth rate will become less. The graph of population growth will be an S-shape, called logistic growth.{{r|Starr|p=688-691}} 
 
 == Community and ecosystem ecology == 
 [[File:Soil_food_webUSDA.jpg|thumb|A soil food web]] 
 A [[Community (biology)|community]] is all populations of different species that live in the same place.{{r|Starr|p=5}} An [[ecosystem]] is a community and its environment. Ecosystem ecology studies how [[energy]] and [[nutrients]] move through an ecosystem. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ecosystem Ecology {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/ecosystem-ecology-13228212/|access-date=2021-03-12|website=www.nature.com}} < /ref >  All living things need [[energy]] to survive, move, grow, and reproduce.  A [[Trophic levels|trophic level]] is the number of times energy moves from one living thing to another, before reaching a particular living thing. The first trophic level, called producers or [[Autotroph|autotrophs]], gets energy from the environment. They use the energy to make [[organic compounds]]. Most producers, such as plants, take in energy from sunlight, but some take it from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic compounds]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Autotrophs - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/autotrophs|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210312014425/https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/autotrophs|archive-date=2021-03-12|access-date=2021-03-12|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref >  Other trophic levels, called consumers or [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]], get their energy by eating other living things. All animals are consumers, and there are three kinds: [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[Carnivore|carnivores]], and [[Omnivore|omnivores]]. Herbivores eat only plants, carnivores eat only other animals, and omnivores eat both. [[Decomposer|Decomposers]] are living things which break down dead things. A [[food web]] shows the movement of energy in an ecosystem.{{r|Starr|p=732-733}} 
 
 == Humans and ecology == 
 === Ecology in politics === 
 Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with [[peace]] movements and the Six Principles, they are called [[green]] movements. In general, these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better [[economics]].  
 
 People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance [[policy]], especially [[forest]] policy and energy [[policy]]. 
 
 Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms. 
 
 === Ecology includes economics === 
 Many ecologists also deal with human economics: 
 
 * Lynn Margulis says that economics studies how humans make a living, while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living. 
 * Mike Nickerson says that  " economy is three-fifths of ecology " , since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste, which the economy assumes is done  " for free " . 
 
 Ecological [[economic]]s and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong.  " Natural [[capital (economics)|capital]] "  is an example of one [[theory]] combining both. 
 
 === Ecology and anthropology === 
 Sometimes ecology is compared to [[anthropology]]. Anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology includes how our [[environment]] is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment.  
 
 Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated:  " The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle " .
