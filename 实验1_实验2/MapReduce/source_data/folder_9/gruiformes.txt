 The '''Gruiformes''' are an [[order (biology)|order]] with many living and extinct [[bird]] [[family (biology)|families]], and a widespread geographical diversity. Gruiform means  " crane-like " . 
 
 The Gruiformes evolved early, long before the [[passerine]] songbirds which are the most common birds today. The Gruiform [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] produced a large variety of medium to large-sized birds. Many of them still prefer the watery [[habitat]]s which were so common early in the [[Cainozoic]] era. 
 
 [[Crane (bird)|Cranes]] and [[Rallidae|rails]] are the core of the Gruiformes. Also often added are a large number of difficult-to-place birds like the huge ''[[Diatryma]]'' and ''[[Phorusrhacos]]''.
