 '''''Westlothiana lizziae''''' is an early [[tetrapod]]. It is a [[transitional fossil]], with a mixture of [[amphibian]] and early [[amniote]] characters. < ref name=Ruta/ > < sup > 282 < /sup >  Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day [[lizard]]s. It lived during the [[Carboniferous]] period, about 350 million years ago.  
 
 The [[type specimen]] was discovered in [[East Kirkton Quarry]], [[Bathgate]], [[Scotland]], in 1984. It was named after the County of [[West Lothian]] where it was found. < ref name=Smithson > Smithson T.R.  &  Rolfe W.D.I. 1990. ''Westlothiana'' gen. nov.: naming the earliest known reptile.

 == ''Westlothiania'' in life == 
 This species probably lived near a [[freshwater]] [[lake]], probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same [[habitat]]. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail.  
 
 Together with ''[[Casineria]]'', another [[transitional fossil]] found in [[Scotland]], it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length.  
 
 The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest [[amniote]], as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. < ref > Carroll R.L. 1991.

These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of [[labyrinthodont]] infolding of the [[dentine]] in [[teeth]], a lack of an [[otic notch]] and a generally small skull. < ref > Paton R.L; Smithson T.R.  &  Clack, J.A. 1999.

 The long body and small legs were a possible [[adaptation]] to burrowing, similar to that seen in modern [[skink]]s. < ref name=Ruta > Ruta M.; Coates M.I.  &  Quicke D.L.J. 2003.
