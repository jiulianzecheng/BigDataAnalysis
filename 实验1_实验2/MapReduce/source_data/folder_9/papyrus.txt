 '''Papyrus''' is a kind of [[paper]] that was used in [[Ancient Egypt]] for [[writing]]. It was first made in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. It was made from a kind of [[Reed (plant)|reed]] called ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''. < ref > {{citation|title=Papyrus Definition|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus|publisher=dictionary.reference.com|year=2009|access-date=21 January 2010}} < /ref >   
 
 This plant grows in [[Floodplain|marshy areas]] around the [[Nile]] river.  The Egyptians also used the papyrus plants to make [[boat]]s, [[mattress]]es, [[mat]]s, [[rope]], [[sandal]]s, and [[basket]]s.  
 
 Specially cultivated papyrus, grown on [[plantation]]s, was used to make the writing material. Papyrus was first used in Ancient Egypt, but it was later used elsewhere in the [[Mediterranean]] region. < ref > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO72jfUCYSg] Gives an illustrated account of the process. < /ref >
