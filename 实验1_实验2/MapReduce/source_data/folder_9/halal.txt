 '''Halal''' (حلال, '''halāl''', '''halaal''') is an [[Islam]]ic [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term meaning  " permissible " . The opposite is  " [[haram]] " , which means  " forbidden " . 
 
 Muslims have strict rules of what they can and cannot eat: 
 * [[Animal]]s need to be killed in a special way. The animal must be slaughtered by a Muslim man, < ref name= " Department of Halal Certification E " > {{cite web |title=Department of Halal Certification EU |url=https://halalcertification.ie/islamic-method-of-slaughtering/ |website=Department of Halal Certification EU}} < /ref >  and the slaughter must be humane. < ref name= " forbidden_food_2 " > {{Cite Quran|5|3}} < /ref >  (The animal should be slaughtered by hand so that all the blood could be drained from the slaughtered {dead} animal before they can eat the animal. It is called  " Zabihah Halal "  in Arabic language meaning  " Permissible Slaughter " .) 
 * Muslims cannot consume carcass animals even the animal slaughtered by knife not in its neck called Mari' and wajadan. Hunting animals can be eaten, but in a special manner. 
 * Muslims must not eat [[pork]].  " He has only forbidden you what dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that over which any other (name) than (that of) Allah has been invoked; but whoever is driven to necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin shall be upon him; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. "  (Quran 2:173) 
 * According to the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali branches of Islam, all [[fish]] and shellfish would be halal. All sea food is allowed to Muslims.  
 * They should not drink [[alcohol]] or consume other intoxicating substances in the wrong way (for example, [[narcotics]]). All substances that takes away the minds - with no medical purpose- are forbidden.  
 * Some sources even argue [[caffeine]], like alcohol and [[drugs]], to be ''haram'', which is the full opposite of halal. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.halalzilla.com/coffee-and-islam-considered-haram/90217 | title=Did You Know Coffee Was Once Punishable by Death in Istanbul? | date=23 July 2019 }} < /ref >
