 '''VidLii''' is a video sharing website that was created by Jan, in December 2015 as an alternative to [[YouTube]]. The website is designed to resemble the early days of [[YouTube]], with a simple and nostalgic interface that harkens back to the early 2000s. As of December 2023, It is considered a shock site. < ref > {{Cite web|title=About Us|url=https://www.vidlii.com/about|access-date=2023-08-27|website=VidLii|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Early Years=== 
 The first version was created in 2015 by Jan, under the name  " ClipBits " . The site looked to the 2005 version of [[YouTube]], without having many features on the main page. In August 2016, the site look was updated to the 2006 version of YouTube. In Late 2016, Jan changed his website name to  " VidBit " , where it changed to the late 2008-early 2009 YouTube version. The site changed the name to  " VidLii "  in 2017. For most of the year, it got many updates as the TestLii program for testing and experimenting with new features. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Testlii|url=https://www.vidlii.com/testlii|access-date=10 December 2023|website=VidLii}} < /ref >  The site went popular until went toxic userbase. 
 
 ===Transfer of ownership=== 
 In May 2019, a website called Vlare was launched. It originally started as a custom theme for VidLii in 2018, but later became its own site. In February 2022, Jan sold VidLii and BitView to Kuz and Lolwut. A few days later, VidLii went down for a short period of time to transfer the servers to the new owners. Lolwut announced on the site blog that Kuz had stepped down and left the site. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Blog|url=https://www.vidlii.com/blog|access-date=2023-08-27|website=VidLii|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=VidLii's Future|url=https://www.vidlii.com/vidlii_future|access-date=2023-08-27|website=VidLii|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 === Controversies === 
 VidLii has gone down-hill since Jan sold VidLii to Kuz and Lolwut. The site has become a shock site, containing gore and other shock content. VidLii is also a popular video sharing website for neo-Nazis due to no moderation and rules prohibiting Nazism.
