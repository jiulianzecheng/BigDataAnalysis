'''Foolscap''' is [[paper]] cut to the size of {{convert|8+1/2|xx|13+1/2|in|0}}, sometimes {{convert|13|xx|8|in|abbr=on}}. This was a traditional [[paper size]] used in Europe and the [[British Commonwealth]], before the adoption of the international standard [[A4 paper]], the most common standard size in the world. Foolscap was so called because, in the 18th century, [[folio]]-sized paper had the [[watermark]] of a fool's cap on it. Basically, it is taller than A4.  
 
 In [[North America]], foolscap is lined, [[legal]]-size paper. In some [[South American]] countries it is called  " oficio " , because it is or was used for official documents. 
 
 Paper of the size is now very rarely used, being superseded by A4 (297 x 210). However, some ring binders, lever arch files, suspended files, and other filing related things still use the size.
