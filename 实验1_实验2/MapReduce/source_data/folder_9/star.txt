 A '''star''' is a very large ball of bright, [[wikt:glow|glowing]], hot [[matter]] in space. That matter is called [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Stars are held together by [[gravity]]. They emit [[light]] because they are very hot. The [[Sun]] is an example of a star. It is at the center of the [[solar system]]. 
 
 The amount of material in a star (its [[mass]]) is so huge that a [[nuclear reaction]] called [[nuclear fusion]] goes on inside it. This reaction changes [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] and gives off heat. The light and heat created by nuclear fusion makes stars very hot. It also makes bigger [[chemical element]]s. In the Sun (but not all stars) the change which takes place is the production of [[helium]], with small amounts of heavier [[Periodic table|elements]].  
 
 Stars have a lot of [[hydrogen]]. Fusion makes a lot of energy. The energy produced by stars moves ([[radiation|radiates]]) away from them. Much of the energy leaves as light, and the rest leaves as other kinds of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. 
 
 When a star like the Sun gets old, it will expand in size and become a [[red giant]] star. That will happen in about 5 billion years. 
 
 == Earth's Sun == 
 The star nearest to [[Earth]] is the [[Sun]]. The energy from the Sun supports [[Black smoker#Ecosystems|almost all life]] on Earth by providing light for plants. Plants turn the light into energy in a process called [[photosynthesis]]. < ref name=Simon2001 >

 We can see other stars in the night sky when the Sun goes down. Like the Sun, they are made mostly of hydrogen and a little bit of helium plus other elements. [[Astronomer]]s  compare those other stars to the Sun. Their [[mass]] is measured in [[solar mass]]es ([[Solar mass|Mʘ]]). A solar mass is the mass of the Sun. A small star may be about 0.2 Mʘ, a medium one may be about the Sun's mass (1 Mʘ), and a large star may be about 10 Mʘ. 
 
 == Planets == 
 The Earth and other planets move around (''[[orbit]]'') the Sun. The Sun and all things that orbit it are called the [[Solar System]]. Many other stars have [[planet]]s orbiting them, and those planets are called [[exoplanets]]. Our Sun would look like a star in the sky to someone on an exoplanet, but you would not see the Earth from one because it would be too far away. 
 
 == Numbers, distances == 
 [[Proxima Centauri]] is the closest star to the Sun. It is 39.9 [[trillion]] [[kilometre]]s, equal to 4.2 [[light year]]s, away. This means that light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.2 [[year]]s to reach Earth.

 Most stars are very old. They are usually thought to be between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. The oldest stars are 13.7 billion years old. That is as old as the Universe. Some young stars are only a few million years old.  
 
 Stars are different sizes. The smallest stars are [[neutron star]]s, which are actually dead stars. They are no bigger than a human [[City|city.]] A neutron star has a large amount of mass in a very small space. A neutron star has a mass of at least 1.4 Mʘ.

 Some stars look brighter than other stars. This difference is measured in terms of [[apparent magnitude]]. There are two reasons why stars have different apparent magnitude. If a star is very close to us, it will appear much brighter. This is just like a candle. A candle that is close to us appears brighter. The other reason a star can appear brighter is that it is hotter than another cooler star. 
 
 Stars give off light but also give off a [[solar wind]] and [[neutrino]]s. These are very small [[particle]]s of matter.  
 
 Stars are made of mass and mass makes [[gravity]]. Gravity makes planets orbit stars. This is why the Earth orbits the Sun. The gravity of two stars can make them go around each other. Stars that orbit each other are called [[binary stars]]. Scientists think there are many binary stars. There are even groups of three or more stars that orbit each other. Proxima Centauri is a small star that orbits other stars. 
 
 Stars are not spread evenly across all of space. Instead, they are grouped into [[galaxy|galaxies]]. A galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars.

 Stars have been important to people all over the world for all of [[history]]. Stars have also been part of [[religion|religious]] practices. Long ago, people believed that stars could never die. 
 
 [[Astronomer|Astronomers]] organized stars into groups called constellations. They used the constellations to help them see the motion of the [[planet]]s and to guess the position of the Sun. < ref name= " forbes " > {{cite book | author=Forbes, George | title=History of Astronomy | publisher=Watts  &  Co. | location=London | year=1909 | format =Free e-book from [[Project Gutenberg]] | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/8172 | isbn=1153627744 }} < /ref >  The motion of the Sun and other stars was used to make [[Calendar|calendars]].

 == The life of stars== 
 {{main|Stellar evolution}} 
 Stars are made in [[nebula|nebulae]]. These are areas that have more gas than normal space. The [[gas]] in a nebula is pulled together by gravity. The [[Orion nebula]] is an example of a place where gas is coming together to form stars. 
 
 Stars spend most of their lives combining (fusing) hydrogen with hydrogen to make energy. When hydrogen is fused it makes [[helium]] and it makes a lot of energy. To fuse hydrogen into helium it must be very hot and the [[pressure]] must be very high. Fusion happens at the center of stars, called  " the core " . 
 
 The smallest stars are called [[red dwarf]]s. Red dwarfs fuse their hydrogen slowly and live for more than 100 billion years, so they live longer than any other star. At the end of their lives, they become [[wikt:dim|dimmer]] and dimmer. Red dwarfs do not explode. 
 
 When very heavy stars die, they explode. This explosion is called a [[supernova]]. When a supernova happens in a nebula, the explosion pushes the gas in the nebula together. This makes the gas in the nebula very dense (thick). Gravity and exploding stars both help to bring the gas together to make new stars in nebulas. 
 
 Most stars use up the hydrogen at their core. When they do, their core becomes smaller and hotter. It becomes so hot that it pushes away the outer part of the star. The outer part expands and it makes a [[red giant]] star. [[Astrophysics|Astrophysicists]] think that in about 5 billion years, the Sun will be a red giant. Our Sun will be so large it will  " eat "  the Earth. After our Sun stops using hydrogen to make energy, it will use helium in its very hot core. It will be hotter than when it was fusing hydrogen. Heavy stars will also make elements heavier than helium. As a star makes heavier and heavier elements, it makes less and less energy. [[Iron]] is a heavy element made in heavy stars.  
 
 Our star is an average star. Average stars will push away their outer gases. The gas it pushes away makes a cloud called a [[planetary nebula]]. The core part of the star will remain. It will be a ball as big as the Earth and called a [[white dwarf]]. It will fade into a [[black dwarf]] over a very long time.  
 
 Later in large stars (~ 10 Mʘ), heavier elements are made by fusion. Finally the star makes a [[supernova]] explosion. Most things happen in the universe so slowly we do not notice. But supernova explosions happen in only 100 seconds. When a supernova explodes its flash is as bright as a 100 billion stars. The dying star is so bright it can be seen during the day. Supernova means  " new star "  because people used to think it was the beginning of a new star. Today we know that a supernova is the death of an old star. The gas of the star is pushed away by the explosion. It forms a giant cloud of gas called a [[planetary nebula]]. The [[crab nebula]] is a good example. All that remains is a [[neutron star]]. If the star was very heavy (~ 25 Mʘ), the star will make a [[black hole]]. Gravity in a black hole is extremely strong. It is so strong that even light cannot escape from a black hole. 
 
 The heaviest elements are made in the explosion of a supernova. After billions of years of floating in space, the gas and dust come together to make new stars and new planets.  Much of the gas and dust in space comes from supernovae. Our Sun, the Earth, and all living things are made from star dust. 
 
 == Colors == 
 Astronomers have known for centuries that stars have different colors. When looking at an electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet waves are the shortest, and infrared are the longest. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.darvill.clara.net/emag/|title=The Electromagnetic Spectrum|first=|last=|website=Andy Darvill's Science Site|publisher=|accessdate=2016-06-06}} < /ref >    The [[visible spectrum]] has [[wavelength]]s between these two extremes.   
 
 Modern instruments can measure very precisely the color of a star.  This allows astronomers to determine that star's temperature, because a hotter star's [[black-body radiation]] has shorter wavelengths.  The hottest stars are blue and azure, then white, then yellow, and the coolest are red. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://oneminuteastronomer.com/708/star-colors-explained/|title=Star Colors Explained|first=|last=|date=December 23, 2008|website=One Minute Astronomer|publisher=|accessdate=2016-06-06|archive-date=2016-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327101450/http://oneminuteastronomer.com/708/star-colors-explained/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Knowing the color and [[absolute magnitude]], astronomers can place the star on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], and estimate its [[habitable zone]] and other facts about it.  
 
 For example, our Sun is yellow-white, and the Earth is the perfect distance away for life. If our Sun was a hotter, blue star, however, Earth would have to be much farther away or else it would be too hot to have water and sustain life.
