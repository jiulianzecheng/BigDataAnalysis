 == History == 
 === Foundation === 
 Humans were present in the area since [[Paleolithic]] times. Inside of local caves, evidence of the presence of first settlers, such as [[weapons]], stone tools and [[cave painting]], have been documented. 
 In the following [[centuries]], the plateau became the settlement for different peoples like [[Bavarians]], [[Scandinavians]] and [[Cimbri]]. These different cultures have left their signs in the local language and traditions. 
 Asiago and the six other towns on the plateau formed an [[alliance]] and shared a common government between 1310 and 1807. The alliance was an autonomous state and an ally of the Republic of Venice. After 1807, Asiago became part of the Republic of Venice and then of the Italian kingdom. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.asiago.to/EN/presentazione.aspx?idPage=128# & panel1-4|title=Asiago - Official tourism website|website=www.asiago.to}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.bcunico.com/asiago-history.htm#gerardo1|title=Asiago-history|website=www.bcunico.com}} < /ref > 
 === World War I === 
 During World War I (1915-1918), the plateau was the place of many battles between the [[Austro-Hungarians]] and Italians. 
 The deadliest battle took place on the 15th of May 1916 and lasted for two weeks. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.shotinthedark.info/wp/?p=57276|title=The Strafexpedition - Shot in the Dark|publisher=}} < /ref >  For the first time on the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army used toxic gas. The battle caused the deaths of 15,000 Italian and 10,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers. The [[civilian]] population of Asiago was evacuated and the town was destroyed as the result of heavy bombing. After the end of the war, some of the original population returned to Asiago and rebuilt the town. < ref > Grag D Wilson II, “Asiago – 1916 Two Views,” World War 1, accessed September 25, 2017, http://www.worldwar1.com/itafront/asiago1916.htm < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/asiago.htm|title=First World War.com - Battles - The Battle of Asiago, 1916|website=www.firstworldwar.com}} < /ref > 
 The famous American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] spent time in Asiago during the first World War as an ambulance driver. In 1922, he wrote a poem inspired by this experience and called “Arsiero, Asiago”. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.worldwarone.it/2012/08/the-poets-and-world-war-arsiero-asiago.html|title=The poets and the World War:  " Arsiero, Asiago "  and  " Killed Piave-July 8-1918 "  by Ernest Hemingway|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 == Economy == 
 The traditional economy was based on farming and on the use of other [[natural resources]] taken from the forest. More recently this has been replaced by the year-round tourism industry and by small [[manufacturing]] and [[food processing]] factories. 
 
 Asiago offers many outdoor activities such as [[hiking]] and [[skiing]]. There are 500 & nbsp;km of ski slopes and 260 & nbsp;km of biking trails (the Plateau Grand Tour). Many tourists are also attracted by the opportunity to taste local foods and visit historical sites from the first World War. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.asiago.to/EN/pagina.aspx?idPage=281#.|title=Asiago - Official tourism website|website=www.asiago.to}} < /ref >  Since 2003, the number of tourists has been decreasing every year.

 == Asiago cheese == 
 Asiago is the birthplace and the place of production of Asiago cheese. Production dates back to the 11th century. During the first World War the method of production was changed in order to feed the growing number of soldiers present on the plateau. This led to the development of the modern version of Asiago cheese, which is now popular around the world. The town of Asiago is the fifth major site of cheese production in Italy, exporting primarily to [[Switzerland]] and the United States. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.clal.it/en/index.php?section=imp_exp_istat & cod=04069075 & mov=E|title=CLAL - Italy: export Asiago, montasio, ragusano, caciocavallo|website=www.clal.it}} < /ref >  The production and origin of Asiago cheese are established under [[European union]] rules and guaranteed by a P.D.O.
