 The '''prosencephalon''' (or '''forebrain'''), the [[mesencephalon]] (midbrain), and [[rhombencephalon]] (hindbrain) are the three primary portions of the [[brain]] of [[vertebrate]]s. They develop very early during [[developmental biology|development]] of the [[central nervous system]]. 
 
 When the embryonic prosencephalon fails to divide the brain into two lobes, it results in a condition known as [[holoprosencephaly]].
