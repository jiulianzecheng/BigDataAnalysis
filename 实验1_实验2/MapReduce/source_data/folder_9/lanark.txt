 '''Lanark''' is a [[town]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. It is close to [[Carluke]] and [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]]. Lanark is approximately 40 miles from [[Edinburgh]], the capital of [[Scotland]]. [[William Wallace]] once lived there. There is a [[statue]] of Wallace on the town [[church]]. A [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] remembers where he  " first drew sword to free his native land "  in 1296, when he killed Heselrig, the [[England|English]] [[sheriff]] of Lanark. This event forms the start of the [[Mel Gibson]] film, ''[[Braveheart]]''.  
 
 Lanark is also notable for its annual Lanimer celebrations, where local children on coloured floats parade through the streets along with marching [[bagpipes|pipe]] bands. A Lanimer [[Queen]] is elected from the children, and crowned in a ceremony at the foot of the High Street. A Lord Cornet is chosen from local businessmen, and acts as escort for the Queen for the events of Lanimer Week.
