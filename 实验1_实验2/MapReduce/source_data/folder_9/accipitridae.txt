 The '''Accipitridae''' are one of the two major [[family (biology)|families]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Accipitriformes]] (the [[diurnal]] [[birds of prey]]).  
 
 They are a family of small to large [[bird]]s with strongly hooked bills (beaks). They vary accordig to their diet. They feed on  prey items from [[insect]]s to medium-sized [[mammal]]s. Some feed on [[carrion]] and a few feed on [[fruit]]. The Accipitridae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found on all the world's continents (except [[Antarctica]]) and a number of oceanic island groups. Some species are [[migratory]]. 
 
 Many well-known birds, such as [[hawks]], [[eagles]], [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[harrier]]s and [[Old World vulture]]s are included in this group. The [[osprey]] is usually placed in a separate family (Pandionidae), as is the [[secretary bird]]. The [[New World vulture]]s are now usually a separate family or order.
