 A '''coffeemaker''' or '''coffee machine''' is a cooking [[Small appliance|appliance]] used to brew [[coffee]]. While there are many different types of coffeemakers using several different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic '''coffee pot''', a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] in the [[kettle]] family. Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel. This is also called ''[[drip brew|automatic drip-brew]]''.
