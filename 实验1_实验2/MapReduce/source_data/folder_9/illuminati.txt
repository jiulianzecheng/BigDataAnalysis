 The '''Illuminati''' (the “enlightened ones”) was a late 18th century German political [[secret society]]. [[Adam Weishaupt]], a Bavarian [[philosopher]] and [[lawyer]], started the secret society on the 1st of May 1776 at the [[University of Ingolstadt]] . In 1785 it was outlawed in [[Bavaria]].  
 
 Originally, they opposed [[superstition]], [[prejudice]], religious influence over public life, and abuses of [[state power]]. They supported women’s education and [[gender equality]]. < ref name=McKeown > McKeown, Trevor W. 2009. [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html A Bavarian Illuminati Primer].

 Later, other groups formed using the same name. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://illuminati-order.com|title=The Illuminati Order Homepage|publisher=Illuminati-order.com|accessdate=2011-08-06}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.illuminati-order.org/index2.html|title=Official website of The Illuminati Order|publisher=Illuminati-order.org|accessdate=2011-08-06}} < /ref >  There is no evidence that these present-day groups have any significant power or influence. They promote themselves using the Bavarian Illuminati to attract membership. < ref name=McKeown/ >   The Illuminati has been prone to speculations and theory's (although most proving false).
