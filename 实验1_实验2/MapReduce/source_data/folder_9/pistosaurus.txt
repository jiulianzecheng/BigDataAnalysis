 '''Pistosaurus''' is a [[genus]] of [[Ocean|marine]] [[sauropterygia]]n [[reptile]]s. It is a [[Nothosaur]], a relative of the [[plesiosaur]]s. 
 
 ''Pistosaurus'' was a advanced [[nothosaur]]-like body with a plesiosaur-like head. Is presently known only from the Middle [[Triassic]]. Even if it is a nothosaur it is acknowledged to be closely related to the ancestors of plesiosaurs. 
 
 The head also resembled that of a plesiosaur, but with the primitive [[palate]] < ref > bone covering roof of mouth. < /ref >  of a nothosaur, and numerous, sharp teeth ideal for catching and eating fish. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 73|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref > 
 
 Although it is unlikely that ''Pistosaurus'' was a direct ancestor of the plesiosaurs, the mixture of features suggests that it was closely related  to that group. < ref name=EoDP/ >
