'''Profiling''' is collecting information about someone in order to describe them and/or predict their behaviour and actions. It is often used for [[criminal]]s or [[people]] believed to behaving illegally. More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success 
 
 == Three main types of criminal profiling == 
 
 A basic profile consists of an [[all points bulletin]] ([[APB]]). It is a visual description based on [[eyewitness]] information.  
 
 A psychological profile is created in the absence of eyewitness information, or in addition to, using evidence to create a picture of the suspect and help the police force to understand how the suspect is behaving. 
 
 Predictive profiling attempts to predict which people might commit crimes in the future. 
 
 Criminal profiling â€“ criminal profiling is a tool used by police forces to create a picture or idea of a suspect based on eyewitness information and any other evidence they have. 
 
 == Concerns about Profiling == 
 
 Some people fear profiling is taken too far by police forces and can lead to harassment and arrest based on skin colour, religious beliefs, culture, nation of origin, or any social type or group that can be stereotyped by characteristic behaviour. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/profiling.htm|title=How Profiling Works|date=13 September 2006|website=HowStuffWorks}} < /ref >
