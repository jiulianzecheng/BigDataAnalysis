'''Heli-skiing''' is off-[[trail]], [[downhill skiing]] or [[snowboarding]] that is accessed by a [[helicopter]]. This is instead of using a [[ski lift]]. As early as the late 1950s helicopters were used in [[Alaska]] and [[Europe]] to access remote terrain. The birth of heli-skiing as a commercial sport is attributed to [[Hans Gmoser]] in 1965. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Donahue| first1 = Topher| title = Bugaboo dreams : a story of skiers, helicopters and mountains| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SUBRAgAAQBAJ| access-date = 14 July 2015| date = 2008| publisher = Rocky Mountain Books| isbn = 978-1-77160-022-4 }} < /ref >

The snow is subjected to [[sun]], wind, [[temperature]] variation, and new snowfalls. Snow conditions change almost every day. < ref name= " faq "  / >  Risks include those of backcountry skiing, such as [[avalanches]] and [[Tree_well|tree wells]], plus those of helicopter flight. Risks are lessened by using experienced pilots and certified guides. Also [[avalanche transceiver]]s, avalanche air-bags, and radios make it safer. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Gmoser|first1=Hans|title=The CMH gallery: a visual celebration of CMH Heli-Skiing and Heli-Hiking.|date=1996|publisher=Altitude Pub.|location=Canmore, Alta.|isbn=978-1-55153-116-8}} < /ref >
