 A '''diacritic''' < ref > {{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ə|ˈ|k|ɹ|ɪ|t|ɪ|k}} < /ref >  is a mark put above, below, through or on a [[letter]]. Some examples of diacritics are an [[acute accent]] or a [[grave accent]]. The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek word]] διακριτικός ([[transliteration|transl.]] diakritikós, 'distinguishing'). 
 Usually, it affects the way the word is said (pronounced). Most diacritics concern [[pronunciation]] because most [[alphabet]]s do not describe the sounds of words exactly. Diacritics are rare in [[English language|English]], but common in many other languages. 
 
 == Examples == 
 === English === 
 English [[orthography]] often uses [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s (like  " ph " ,  " sh " ,  " oo " , and  " ea " ) rather than diacritics to show more sounds than can be shown with single letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].  Unlike other systems (such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) where the spelling shows how to say the words, English pronunciation is so varied that diacritics alone would not make it [[phonetic]]. By using digraphs we show sounds which are not shown by single letters. 
 
 Diacritics are not used much in modern English.  Two types of diacritics have become part of everyday English: the dot above the  " i "  or  " j "  and the [[apostrophe]]. But they are no longer commonly thought of as being diacritical.  The apostrophe is used to show missing letters (elision, ''it's'' to replace ''it is'') and show [[possession]] (as in ''Mike's car''). 
 
 In most other cases, use of diacritics for native English words is considered [[wikt:old-fashioned|old-fashioned]] (not used anymore). [[Diaeresis|Diaereses]] (similar to [[umlaut]]s) can be used on words where two [[vowel]]s next to each other are pronounced separately like ''noöne'', ''reëstablished'', or ''coöperate'' (two vowels pronounced ''together'' are a [[diphthong]]). This method is still used sometimes. < ref > {{cite book|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMsWFsI0YkIC & pg=PT445|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|author=Thomas Burns McArthur and Roshan McArthur|isbn=9780192806376}} < /ref >  Diacritics are sometimes used in [[wikt:loanword|loanwords]] (words of foreign origin), such as  ''naïve'', ''entrée'', ''pâté'', ''façade,'' < ref > {{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/english/story.asp?file=/2011/11/11/lifefocus/9861202 & sec=lifefocus|title=How foreign is English?|author=Dr Lim Chin Lam|work=The Star|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=17 June 2012|archive-date=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513021419/http://thestar.com.my/english/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F11%2F11%2Flifefocus%2F9861202 & sec=lifefocus|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  which are French words. 
 
 === French === 
 Letter '''e''': common are the [[acute accent]] '''é''' (rising voice, as in the [[French language|French]] word née), [[grave accent]] '''è''' (lowering voice); ''élève'' has (from the left) acute, grave and silent e. The [[cedilla]] '''ç''' signals a soft c, sounding like an '''s''' in English.  
 
 A different principle is illustrated by the [[circumflex]] '''î'''. This usually shows the loss of letter: e.g. maistre (Middle French)  >  maître (modern French). Thus its function is historical. Also, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between [[homophone]]s. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: ''sur'' = on, but ''sûr'' = safe. In those cases the [[pronunciation]] of the two words may be different. 
 
 === Spanish === 
 In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the acute accent simply signals stress, e.g. ''educación''. There the stress is on the last [[vowel]], not on the usual second to last. Second to last vowel ([[syllable]]) is the usual position for stress in spoken Spanish. It is usually not signalled by a printed accent. Where the stress is in its usual place, the end [[consonant]] is often dropped in speech. 
 
 The [[tilde]] '''ñ''' is pronounced something like '''ny'''. It counts as a separate letter in their dictionaries, coming after '''n'''. 
 
 The double '''L''' is pronounced as our '''Y''' and LL is in Spanish dictionaries in its own section,  after the single L section. 
 
 === German === 
 The [[umlaut]] '''ü''' in [[German language|German]] is pronounced '''ue''', and is less used in modern German. Historical name-spellings should always keep the umlaut if it was used for that name. 
 
 === Swedish, Norwegian, Danish === 
 The [[Scandinavia]]n languages treat the characters with diacritics '''ä''', '''ö''' and '''å''' as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after '''z'''. Usually '''ä''' is sorted as equal to '''æ''' (ash) and '''ö''' is sorted as equal to '''ø''' (o-slash). Also, '''aa''', when used as an alternative spelling to '''å''', is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that '''ü''' is frequently sorted as '''y'''. 
 
 == Non-Roman scripts ==

 Scripts for [[semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] have a wide variety of diacritics. This is partly because the scripts for semitic languages were originally formed without separate letters for vowels, and partly because some of the languages (Arabic in particular) are spoken in a number of dialects.  
 
 The diacritics in Hebrew and Arabic are not always used, however.
