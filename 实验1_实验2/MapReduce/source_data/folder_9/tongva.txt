 == Name == 
 The word Tongva comes from the word ''Toviscangna'', which is a Tongva village located near Mission San Gabriel. However, the Tongva call themselves '''Kizh''' (keech). 
 
 == History == 
 The Tongva were forced onto Spanish missionaries to learn about Christianity and the European lifestyle. The Tongva lived in shelters called ''kiches''. The ''kiche'' was dome-shaped. The frame was made of willow branches and was covered with mats made with reeds, grasses, or animal hides. The Tongva lived in villages with as many as 400–500 ''kiches''. A chief lived in the largest ''kiche'' and had almost total authority over the village. The position was passed down through the chief’s family. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Tongva|url=https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/Tongva/632190|access-date=2021-11-21|website=Britannica Kids|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Culture == 
 The Tongva hunted, fished, and gathered food. They liked to eat [[Acorn|acorns]]. They would mash the acorns and then process it so that it would taste better. They also hunted deer and small animals such as birds, rabbits, and rodents. 
 
 == Language == 
 The Tongva once spoke the Tongva language but most of them now speak English and Spanish. However, they are trying to use the Tongva language more. One way they are doing this is by having Tongva classes. 
 
 The Tongva language was the source of many place names in the Los Angeles region. Some of these places are: Topanga, Tujunga, Cucamonga, etc.
