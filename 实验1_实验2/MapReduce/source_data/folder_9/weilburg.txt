 '''Weilburg''' is an [[Germany|German]] town of the [[Limburg-Weilburg]] district in the west of [[Hesse]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Weilburg got mentioned in a history book back in 906 by a person named Abbot Regino of Prüm. It was like a strong place called Wilineburch. After six years, King Conrad I decided to build a church and a monastery there because his dad got killed in a battle nearby in 906, and he was buried in that place. 
 
 In 912, they started a monastery called St. Walpurgis-Chorherrenstift. They put it on high ground, so the monastery could control the Lahn River and important roads like the Hohe Straße (High Road) from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Cologne]] and the Via Publica from [[Flanders]] to [[Bohemia]]. These roads were close to the monastery.
