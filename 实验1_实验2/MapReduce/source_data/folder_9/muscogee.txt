 The '''Muscogee''' or '''Mvskoke, Muscogee Creek''' are a [[Native American]] people from the [[Southeastern Woodlands]]. Today this is [[Tennessee]], [[Alabama]], western [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and northern [[Florida]]. Their languages are [[Muscogee language|Muscogee, Mvskoke]] and [[Hitchiti-Mikasuki]]. The languages are part of the  [[Muskogean languages|Muscogean language family]]. The [[Seminole]] people come from the Muscogee tribes. The Muscogee historically formed the Muscogee Confederacy.   
 
 == Social Structure == 
 The Muscogee Confederacy included several Upper Towns and several Lower Towns.  [[Abihka]], [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], [[Tuckabutche]], and [[Coweta tribal town|Coweta]] were the four earliest towns.  
 
 The Muscogee Confederacy had particular social structure. The social unit was the town (''idalwa''). The ''mico'' was village chief and most important man. ''Micos'' were warriors. ''Micalgi'' were lower chiefs. The ''heniha'' was second in charge. The ''tustunnuggee'' were ranked warriors. The clan was another social group. They dealt with land, hunts, marriages and crimes. < ref > O'Brien, Sharon. American Indian Tribal Governments. United Kingdom: University of Oklahoma Press, 1993. < /ref >   
 
 == History == 
 Early Muscogee were part of the [[Mississippian culture]]. They built [[cities]] and were [[mound builders]]. Notable mound sites are the [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee]], [[Etowah Indian Mounds]], and [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] sites. 
 
 Spanish were early Europeans to meet the Muscogee in the 16th century.  
 
 Natives had interpretations for two special events. One was the [[Great Comet of 1811]]. The other was the [[1812 New Madrid Earthquake]]. Many thought the events meant that they should support the [[Shawnee]]. < ref > " The Creeks. "  Archived November 18, 2005, at the [[Wayback Machine]] ''War of 1812 "  People and Stories.'' (retrieved July 28, 2022) < /ref >   
 
 There was conflict between the Upper and Lower Towns of the Muscogee. This eventually lead to the  [[Red Stick War]] (Creek War, 1813–1814). It was connected to the [[War of 1812]]. Europeans also got involved in the war.  [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] led the Northern towns. They lost against the Southern Muscogee and General Andrew Jackson. In 1814, the Muscogee signed the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. They had to give up a lot of land. < ref > [[H. W. Brands|Brands, H. W.]] (2005). ''Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times''. New York, NY: Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. pp. 233–235. [[ISBN (identifier)|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-1-4000-3072-9| < bdi > 978-1-4000-3072-9 < /bdi > ]]. < /ref >  The Muscogee spread out to different regions after this. Several went to Florida.  
 
 In Florida, Andrew Jackson attacked the [[Seminole]] in 1817. The Natives had been raiding towns. The Seminole lost and many moved inland. < ref > Merwyn Garbarino, ''The Seminole'' Pg. 40 < /ref >   
 
 The Muscogee were forced to leave their homes during the [[Trail of Tears]] in the 1830s. Most went to [[Indian Territory]] ([[Oklahoma]]). Some remaining Muscogee moved to Florida and formed the [[Seminole]]. Also many of these Seminole were forced to leave. Some moved south to the [[Everglades]].  
 
 The Muscogee were considered part of the so-called  " [[Five Civilized Tribes]] " . The Europeans saw how technologically advanced these natives were and thought they were civilized.  
 
 ''[[Opothleyahola]]'' was a chief of the Muscogee during the American Civil War. He wanted that the Muscogee stay neutral. Later they supported the Union and blacks. < ref > " Woodson County history " . Archived from the original on June 28, 2022. < /ref >
