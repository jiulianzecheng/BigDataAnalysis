[[Image:Hamilton-burr-duel.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Duelling]] was a common way of defending one's honor.]] 
 '''Honour''', spelt '''honor''' in the [[United States]], is the idea of the [[trustworthiness]] and [[social]] [[status]] of a person by the society, by [[judge]]ment of his actions. The idea of honour, like most cultural things, is very different from place to place, and through time. In [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], honour took form in the [[code]] of [[Chivalry]]. In [[Japan]], a similar thing happened with [[Bushido]]. As time passed, the honour of a gentleman and his family was generally expressed in the [[practice]] of [[duelling]]. The idea has declined in modern times, but still exists, mostly as an [[approval]] of one's actions by the society.
