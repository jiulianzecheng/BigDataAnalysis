'''Cybersquatting''' is the use of a [[domain name]] which is another person's [[trademark]]. The domain name may be the name of a person, a company, or an organization. The purpose of cybersquatting is to make money. 
 
 For example: 
 *Domain parking: somebody buys a domain name of a company, because they hope to sell the domain to the company later. 
 *[[Phishing]]: somebody buys the domain name of a company, to fool people who visit that website. These visitors think the company owns the website  & mdash; but  a [[scam]]mer actually owns the website. When they use their [[banking]] number, the scammer can now steal money from their bank account. 
 
 In the USA, cybersquatting may be a crime under the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Cybersquatting: What It Is and What Can Be Done About It |website=Nolo |url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/cybersquatting-what-what-can-be-29778.html}} < /ref >
