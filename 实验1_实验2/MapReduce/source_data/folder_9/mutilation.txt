'''Mutilation''' is when the way a [[body]] looks is permanently changed. This change may be due to an [[accident]], or it may be the result of [[torture]]. 
 
 Losing a part of the body (like a hand), or permanent [[scar]]s (different looking skin after a bad injury heals) on the body, might be a result of mutilation.
