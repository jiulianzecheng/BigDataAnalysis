 '''Bacteria''' (singular: '''bacterium''') are very small [[organism]]s. They are [[prokaryotic]] [[microorganisms]]. Bacterial [[cell]]s do not have a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], and most have no [[organelles]] with membranes around them. Most have a [[cell wall]]. They do have [[DNA]], and their [[biochemistry]] is basically the same as other living things. They are amongst the simplest and the oldest organisms.    
 
 Almost all bacteria are so tiny they can only be seen through a [[microscope]]. Bacteria are made up of one [[cell]], so they are a kind of ''[[unicellular organism]]''. They were one of the earliest forms of life, and are simple single-celled organisms. They include [[extremophile]]s, which live in extreme [[habitats]]. 
 
 There are probably more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet, except [[viruses]]. < ref name=lots/ >  Most bacteria live in the [[ground]] or in [[water]], but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms, including humans. There are about as many bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-bacteria-cells-outnumber-human-cells-microbiome-science|title=Here's how many cells in your body aren't actually human |last=Crew|first=Bec|website=ScienceAlert|date=11 April 2018 |language=en-gb|access-date=2019-08-07}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/youre-probably-not-mostly-microbes/423228/|title=You're probably not mostly microbes |last=Yong|first=Ed|date=2016-01-08|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-07}} < /ref >  Some bacteria cause [[disease]]s, but others help us in everyday activities like digesting food ([[gut flora]]). Some we use in factories to make [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]. 
 
 The founder of [[bacteriology]] was a [[Germans|German]] [[biologist]] called [[Ferdinand Cohn]] (1828{{ndash}}1898). He published the first [[biological classification]] of bacteria, based on their appearance. < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48314/bacteriology Encyclopedia Britanniaca: Bacteriology] < /ref > 
 
 == Reproduction and gene transfer == 
 A bacterium [[reproduction|reproduces]] (creates more bacteria) by [[Cell division|dividing in half]] and creating two  " daughter "  cells. Each daughter is identical in shape to the parent. 
 
 Bacteria do not have sexes, but they do transmit [[DNA]] by several kinds of [[horizontal gene transfer]]. This is how they share resistance to [[antibiotics]] from one strain to another. The complete [[DNA sequence]] is known for many bacterial strains. Each bacterium has only one [[chromosome]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1900-bacterial-dna-the-role-of-plasmids | title=Bacterial DNA – the role of plasmids }} < /ref > 
 
 == Shape == 
 Bacteria vary widely in size and shape, but in general they are at least ten times larger than viruses. A typical bacterium is about 1 & nbsp;µm (one [[micrometer]]) in diameter, so a thousand bacteria lined up would be one millimeter long. There are about five nonillion (5×10 < sup > 30 < /sup > ) bacteria on Earth. < ref name=lots > {{cite journal |author=Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W |title=Prokaryotes: the unseen majority |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=12 |pages=6578–83 |year=1998|pmid = 9618454 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578|pmc=33863 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.6578W |doi-access=free }} < /ref > 
 
 Bacteria are identified and grouped by their shapes. Bacilli are rod-shaped, cocci are ball-shaped, spirilla are spiral-shaped, and vibrio are shaped like a comma or a boomerang.

 == Pathogens == 
 [[Pathogen]]ic bacteria, the harmful kind, enter the human body from the air, water or food. Once inside, these bacteria attach themselves to or invade specific cells in our respiratory system, digestive tract or in any open wound. There they begin to reproduce and spread while using your body's food and nutrients to give them energy to help them reproduce. 
 
 == Extremophiles == 
 Some bacteria are [[extremophile|extremophiles]]. Some microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 meters below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometers of ocean off the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States. < ref name= " LS-20130317 " > {{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes thrive in deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date= 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=17 March 2013 }} < /ref > < ref name= " LS-20130314 " > {{cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life thrives in ocean floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=17 March 2013 }} < /ref >  According to one of the researchers,  " You can find microbes everywhere — they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are. " < ref name= " LS-20130317 "  / >   
 
 == Viruses == 
 Viruses were the first and are the most serious enemies of bacteria. Everywhere bacteria are, they get attacked by viruses. The viruses which attack bacteria are called [[Bacteriophage|bacteriophages]].  
 
 Something is now known about how bacteria protect themselves against viruses. Some bacteria and most archaea have [[CRISPR]]–Cas systems as an [[adaptive]] defence against viruses. These keep sections of viral [[DNA]]. These are used to target and destroy later infections by the virus. The process is similar to [[RNA interference]]. < ref name= " pmid24909109 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = van der Oost J, Westra ER, Jackson RN, Wiedenheft B | title = Unravelling the structural and mechanistic basis of CRISPR-Cas systems | journal = Nature Reviews.

 == History of their classification == 
 All modern ideas start with the [[sequence analysis]] of DNA and RNA. In 1987, [[Carl Woese]], the forerunner of the [[molecular phylogeny]] revolution, divided bacteria into 11 divisions based on 16S [[ribosomal RNA]] (SSU) sequences: < ref name= " woese87 " > Woese C.R. 1987.
