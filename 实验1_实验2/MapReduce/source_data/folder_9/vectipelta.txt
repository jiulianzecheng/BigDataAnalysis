 '''''Vectipelta''''' (meaning  " [[Isle of Wight]] shield " ) is the name of a [[genus]] of [[ankylosaur]]ian dinosaur. It was recently discovered in [[Lower Cretaceous]] chalk in [[England]].  
 
 The specimen has many vertebrae, some of the fore and hindlimbs, and several [[osteoderms]] (bony plates). < ref name=Vectipelta > {{Cite journal |last1=Pond |first1=Stuart |last2=Strachan |first2=Sarah-Jane |last3=Raven |first3=Thomas J. |last4=Simpson |first4=Martin I. |last5=Morgan |first5=Kirsty |last6=Maidment |first6=Susannah C.

 ''Vectipelta'' is the first ankylosaur identified from the Isle of Wight in 142 years. This suggests that some specimens previously assigned to ''[[Polacanthus]]'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'' might actually be other taxa. < ref name=Vectipelta / >
