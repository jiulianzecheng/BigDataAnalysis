Hikoyai-no-Mikoto's father was [[Emperor Jimmu]], and his brothers were [[Kamuyaimimi]] and [[Emperor Suizei]].  
 
 After Jimmu died, Empress [[Himetataraisuzu-hime]] married [[Tagishimimi]], her stepson. Tagishimimi tried to kill the brothers but was instead killed by [[Emperor Suizei|Suizei]], who became the second emperor. Hikoyai-no-Mikoto did not have an active role in the story and did not play a significant part in the narrative. This is common in Japanese mythology where some brothers do not play a major role. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 == Family tree == 
 {{A genealogical tree based on the Kojiki}}According to the [[Kojiki]], Hikoyai-no-Mikoto was the son of [[Emperor Jimmu|Jimmu]], who was the first emperor of Japan, and {{Interlanguage link|Himetataraisuzu-hime|lt=|ja|ヒメタタライスズヒメ|en}}, the daughter of [[Ōmononushi|Omononushi no Mikoto]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 
 
 However, Hikoyai-no-Mikoto's name is not mentioned in the [[Nihon Shoki]]. In other sources, such as the Shinsen Seijiroku, the Ibarada-ren article of the Ukyo Emperor, and the  " Aso Family Brief Genealogical Record, "  there is a different theory that suggests he is the son of Kamiyai-mimi-no-mikoto. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Interestingly, Hikoyai-mikoto's name does not appear in the  " Aso Genealogy "  or the  " Monzan Genealogy "  found in the 16th volume of the  " Shoshu Keifu. " < ref > Hoga Hisao,  " Chapter 2: Imperial Clans, Section 1: The Many Clans " , Ancient Clans Genealogical Collection, Vol. 1, Ancient Clans Study Group, 1986, p. 210. < /ref > 
 
 
 
 The  " Shinsen Shōjiroku "  commissioned by [[Emperor Saga]] and the  " {{Nihongo|Aso Genealogy|阿蘇家略系譜|Aso-ka ryaku keifu}} "  have a different theory that suggests Hikoyai was the son of Kamuyaimimi, as opposed to the previously mentioned belief that he was the son of Himetataraisuzu-hime and Jimmu. < ref > 「日子八井命」『日本古代氏族人名辞典 普及版』[[吉川弘文館]]、2010年。 < /ref >
