 The chain is recognizable by the A-frame style roofs of its older restaurants, similar to the original structures used by [[IHOP]], [[Tastee-Freez]], [[Nickerson Farms]], and [[Whataburger]]. Structures that have been converted from Wienerschnitzels into other restaurants often retain the distinctive architecture. The chain's advertising [[mascot]] is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[chili dog]] known as [[The Delicious One]], who runs from people who want to eat him. < ref name= " TDO Speaks " > [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_40_34/ai_66219137 'The Delicious One' speaks in new TV spots for Wienerschnitzel] < /ref > 
 
 Wienerschnitzel sponsors the tongue-in-cheek [[Wiener Nationals]], the ''[[de facto]]'' national [[dachshund racing]] championship series for the United States.
