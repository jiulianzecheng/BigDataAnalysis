 The '''outback''' is the [[wikt:remote|remote]] areas of [[Australia]]. The outback is not a defined area, it is only a term used to refer to locations that are far away from big cities.  
 The [[fertile]] parts are known as Rangelands and have been traditionally used for [[sheep]] or [[cattle]] farming. 
 Agriculture, tourism and mining are the main economic activities in this vast and sparsely settled area. 
 
 ==Medicine in the outback== 
 Because of the expanses and remoteness in the outback a unique service, [[Royal Flying Doctor Service|The Flying Doctor]], was created in [[1928]]. The aim of the service is to provide medical care to people who cannot reach hospitals or other doctors. Consultations are carried out via radio or telephone and for serious situations, doctors are flown out to the patients. 
 
 ==Tourism== 
 Organised travels with a [[guide]] to the outback is popular, although some Australian and international tourists travel in their own cars. Such a trip, especially off the few big roads in the outback, requires very good planning and a suitable vehicle (usually four wheel drive). On remote routes considerable supplies and equipment are required. Some big trips cannot be undertaken safely without a convoy of  several vehicles. Deaths of tourists are a regular occurrences because many people are not well-prepared for their outback trip.
