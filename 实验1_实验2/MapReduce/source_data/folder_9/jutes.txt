 The '''Jutes''' were a Germanic people who are believed to have come from [[Jutland]] (called ''Iutum'' in Latin) in modern [[Denmark]] inclusive Southern Schleswig in Northern Germany and part of the [[Frisia|Frisian]] coast. The Jutes, along with the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Frisians]], were mentioned amongst the Germanic [[tribe]]s who sailed across the [[North Sea]] to [[raid]] and eventually [[invasion|invade]] [[Great Britain]].  
 
 It is believed that the Jutes settled particularly in [[Kent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The land where the Jutes, [[Angles]], and [[Saxons]] settled became the country of [[England]].
