 '''DjVu''' (pronounced like [[French language|French]] ''déjà vu'') is a [[Open_Format|open]] computer [[file format]]. It is made mostly to store scanned documents. It is especially used for things with a mix of words, line drawings, and [[photograph]]s inside. DjVu has been sold as an alternative < ref name= " DjVu " > {{cite web|url=http://djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php|title=What is DjVu - DjVu.org|publisher=DjVu.org|language=English|accessdate=2009-03-05|archive-date=2019-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190121142932/http://www.djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  to [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], as it gives smaller files than PDF for most scanned documents.  The DjVu developers report < ref name=djvupaper > Léon Bottou, Patrick Haffner, Paul G. Howard, Patrice Simard, Yoshua Bengio and Yann Le Cun: High Quality Document Image Compression with DjVu, Journal of Electronic Imaging, 7(3):410-425, 1998 http://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/jei-1998.pdf < /ref >  that color [[magazine]] pages make smaller to 40–70 & nbsp;kB. Black and white technical papers make it smaller to 15–40 & nbsp;kB. Old manuscripts make smaller to around 100 & nbsp;kB; a satisfactory [[JPEG]] image usually needs 500 & nbsp;kB. Like PDF, DjVu can have a [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] text layer. This makes it easy to cut and paste, and search for text.
