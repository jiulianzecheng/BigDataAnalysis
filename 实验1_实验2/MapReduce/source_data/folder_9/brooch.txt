 A '''brooch''' is a piece of [[jewelry]] that is attached to [[clothes]]. It is usually made of [[metal]], [[silver]] or [[gold]] but sometimes [[bronze]] and decorated with [[gemstone]]s. 
 
 Brooches called  " fibulae "  were used for many centuries to fasten clothing. In recent centuries people more often use buttons and belts for that, so brooches have become only decorative.
