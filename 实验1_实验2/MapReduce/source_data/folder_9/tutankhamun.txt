 Tutankhamun ruled for 9 years and died very young, at 19, so he is known as The Boy King. He was married to his half-sister Ankhesenamun, daughter of Queen [[Nefertiti]], his stepmother.

 In his third year of his reign, Tutankhamun reversed several changes made during his father's reign. He ended the worship of the god [[Aten]] and restored the god [[Amun]] to supremacy. The ban on the cult of Amun was lifted and traditional privileges were restored to its priesthood. The capital was moved back to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the city of [[Akhetaten|Akhenaten]] abandoned. < ref > Erik Hornung, ''Akhenaten and the religion of light'', Translated by David Lorton, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8014-8725-0}}. < /ref >  This is when he changed his name to Tutankhamun,  " Living image of Amun " , reinforcing the restoration of Amun. 
 
 In 1922 Howard Carter found Tutankhamun's tomb. Tutankhamen was believed to carry a [[curse]]. Actually, the archeologists who visited his tomb died from natural causes. Tutankhamen's tomb's unique and priceless treasures have taught us a lot about the boy king, the pharaohs, and ancient Egypt. < ref > {{Cite web|title=3.3 History Through Objects: Tut’s Treasures|url= https://mts.cengage.com/course/HRTCF6AZTT23CUQA8808/edition/student/activity/STLN413RNFL9JZLUT268|access-date=2023-02-04}} < /ref > 
 
 == Illness and death == 
 Recent studies of his body using [[Computed tomography scanner|CT scans]] and [[DNA]] tests show that he had two children, but they died very young. Scientists now believe he died from a broken leg, made more complicated by bone disease and [[malaria]]. < ref name= " abc " > {{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/LivingLonger/king-tut-died-revealed-study/story?id=9853119#.UMT1DOR4xiN | title=How King Tut died revealed in new study | publisher=ABC | work=ABC World News | date= 2010 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author= Hasan, Lama}} < /ref >  Before this discovery there were many theories about his early death, including murder. It is quite certain that he was infected by several strains of malaria, and very likely that he had some [[birth defect|genetic defects]] caused by [[inbreeding]]. His parents were brother and sister. < ref > Hawass Z. ''et al'' 2010.  Ancestry and pathology in King Tutankhamun's family. Supreme Council of Antiquities, Cairo, Egypt. ''JAMA''.
