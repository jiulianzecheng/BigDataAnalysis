 The '''Cherimoya''' (''Annona cherimola''), also called the '''custard apple''', is a [[Sweet (taste)|sweet]] [[fruit]] that comes mostly from [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]] and [[Bolivia]].. The inside of a cherimoya is soft, and it is white in color. The skin of the cherimoya fruit is [[green]] when it is [[ripe]], and brown if it becomes too ripe. The cherimoya has large, black [[seed]]s. The cherimoya is special because it can be grown in high places. 
 
 In India, especially in North India, this fruit is known as ''sitafal'' (named after [[Sita]]). In Sri Lanka it is known as  " Wali Anoda (වැලි අනෝදා) " .  
 It is grown in [[Reggio Calabria]] as well.
