 [[Defamation|Harmful untrue information]] against the Romani people is spread worldwide. Unfortunately, the Romani people are blamed for many things by other peoples. As example, dubious sources claimed, that Talat Pasha who belogend to the Turks from Bulgaria, have been the son of a Romani mother and a [[Pomak]] father, which is simply not true. He had nothing to do with the Romani people from Bulgaria. This is done, to deny his turkish origins and to blame the Romani people.
