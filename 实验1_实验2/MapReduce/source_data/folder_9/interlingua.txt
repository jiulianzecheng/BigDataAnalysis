 [[File:Vocabulario scientific international.ogg|thumb|Spoken Interlingua]] 
 
 '''Interlingua''' is a [[constructed language]] using words that are found in most West-European languages. It was made by [[IALA]] - a group of people (the most known was [[Alexander Gode]]) who worked on it for more than 20 years, and they finished and published the first dictionary in [[1951]]. Interlingua was created on the base of languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]. 
 
 ''Inter'' is the same root word as in the words  " interaction " ,  " interface "  and so on, and it means  " between "  or  " to each other " ; ''lingua'' means  " language " . They chose the name Interlingua because they wanted it to be used for people of different countries to talk to each other easily. Because Interlingua was made by people to be easy, it is easier than natural languages to learn. 
 In the year 2000, the language could be spoken by 1,500 people. Interlingua speakers say that millions can understand it (read texts in it and listen to someone talk in it) without having to learn it first. 
 
 There are three other constructed languages in the world that have more than 1000 speakers, [[Esperanto]], [[Ido]], and [[Toki Pona]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://iso639-3.sil.org/sites/iso639-3/files/change_requests/2021/2021-043_tok.pdf|access-date=2023-08-05|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2023-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230706140833/https://iso639-3.sil.org/sites/iso639-3/files/change_requests/2021/2021-043_tok.pdf|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  Esperanto and Ido were made before Interlingua. Toki Pona was made in 2001. Some people think Esperanto and Ido are easy to learn because they have no ''exceptions'' (words that break the rules) but other people think Interlingua is easier because the makers chose all the words to be easy to understand for people who know English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian, plus languages like [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], languages that used to be [[Latin language|Latin]], the language used in [[Rome]] a long time ago. 
 
 Actually, people who use Interlingua say that their language is actually new Latin, just simpler and ''modernized'' (made new). 
 
 == History == 
 {{Main|History of Interlingua}} 
 At the beginning of the 20th century, several associations such as the International Research Council, the American Council on Education and the American Council of Learned Societies were investigating the problem of the international auxiliary language. 
 
 [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] and her husband, [[Dave Hennen Morris]] had become interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s. In 1924 they created the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. They wanted to give scientific support to the study of IALs. They asked for the help of linguists like [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]]. < ref name= " Falk, Julia S 1995 " > {{cite journal|last1=Falk|first1=Julia S.|title=Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_language-communication_1995-07_15_3/page/241|journal=Language and Communication|volume=15|issue=3|pages=241–259|publisher=Pergamon|year=1995|doi=10.1016/0271-5309(95)00010-N}} < /ref > 
 
 In its early years, IALA was focused on finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing IALs such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido]], [[Novial]], and [[Interlingue]]. To achieve the last goal, it arranged conferences with people that supported those IALs. IALA gain the support of different linguists during these conferences and congresses. < ref name= " gopsill1990 " > {{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.|title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}} < /ref >  However, the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1939 meant the end of those meetings. < ref name= " gopsill1990 " / > 
 
 Although the IALA did not have the goal of creating its own language, after ten years of research, it concluded that none of the existing artificial languages was good enough. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language. 
 
 [[E. Clark Stillman]] with the help of [[Alexander Gode]], developed a technique for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''. < ref name= " gopsill1990 " / >  Later, in 1943 Stillman left and Gode became acting director of research. < ref name= " iala1971_foreword " > {{ cite book|last1=Bray|first1=Mary Connell|orig-year=1951|year=1971|chapter=Foreword|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090121/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html|archive-date=October 6, 2007|url=http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html|title=Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language|edition=2nd|location=New York|publisher=Frederick Ungar Publishing Company|isbn=0-8044-0188-8|oclc=162319|access-date=April 18, 2010}} < /ref >  IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's ''General Report'' in 1945. < ref name= " gopsill-historia2 " > Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-2.htm  " Profunde recerca duce a un lingua " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221210152200/https://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-2.htm |date=2022-12-10 }}, ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006. < /ref > 
 
 In 1946, with the French linguist [[André Martinet]] was Director of Research, four models for the language were introduced (two more naturalistic and two more schematic). IALA decided to find a middle way between the two naturalistic models, with some elements of one of the schematic ones. < ref name= " gopsill-historia3 " > Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm  " Le natura, si – un schema, no " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220412014242/https://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm |date=2022-04-12 }}, ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006. < /ref >  Martinet left the project in 1948, and Gode was in charge of the last phase of Interlingua's development. 
 
 The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'' and the 27,000-word [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] (IED). In 1954, IALA published an introductory manual entitled ''[[Interlingua a Prime Vista]]'' ( " Interlingua at First Sight " ). 
 
 == Grammar == 
 {{Main|Interlingua grammar}} 
 
 === Articles === 
 * ''un'' - a/an 
 * ''le'' - the 
 * ''al'' - to the 
 * ''del'' - of the 
 
 === Nouns === 
 The plural is ''-s'' after a vowel, ''-es'' after a consonant, but ''-hes'' after final ''c'': 
 * ''catto  >  cattos'' - cat  >  cats 
 * ''can  >  canes'' - dog  >  dogs 
 * ''roc  >  roches'' - rook  >  rooks (of chess) 
 
 Interlingua has no grammatical gender. Some words distinguish female from male by changing ''-o'' into ''-a'', or by adding ''-essa''. Other ones have two different forms. But the most of words do not distinguish: 
 * ''puero  >  puera'' - boy  >  girl 
 * ''tigre  >  tigressa'' - male tiger  >  female tiger 
 * ''rege  >  regina'' - king  >  queen 
 * ''jornalista'' - journalist (male or female) 
 
 === Adjectives === 
 Adjectives do not change for agreement with nouns. They can precede or follow the noun, except numbers, that always precede the noun. In general, short adjectives precede and long adjectives follow. 
 * ''belle oculos = oculos belle'' - beautiful eyes 
 * ''un bon idea, un idea ingeniose'' - a good idea, an ingenious idea 
 
 To compare, use ''plus'' or ''minus'' and ''le plus'' or ''le minus'': 
 * ''un plus feroce leon'' - a more ferocious lion 
 * ''un traino minus rapide'' - a less rapid train 
 * ''le plus alte arbore'' - the highest tree 
 * ''le solution le minus costose'' - the less costly solution 
 
 One can use the suffix ''-issime'' for the absolute superlative: 
 * ''un aventura excellentissime'' - the most excellent adventure 
 
 === Adverbs === 
 There are two kinds of adverbs: first form and second form. Adverbs of first form are a closed class of grammatical words, like ''quasi'' (almost), ''jam'' (already), and ''totevia'' (nevertheless). Adverbs of second form are an open class derived from adjectives by adding the suffix ''-mente'' (or ''-amente'' after final ''c''): 
 * ''felice  >  felicemente'' - happily 
 * ''magic  >  magicamente'' - magically
