The '''Mesozoic Era''' was the [[era|geological era]] in which [[dinosaur]]s lived, as well as the first [[mammal]]s. It lasted about 186 million years, starting 252.2 mya (million years ago) with the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|P/Tr extinction]] and ending 65 mya with the [[K/T extinction event|K/T extinction]] (the one that killed all dinosaurs except birds). < ref > Gradstein, Felix M.

 Dinosaurs appeared around 231 mya (21 million years after the beginning of the Mesozoic). They [[evolved]] from the reptiles called [[archosaur]]s. Modern birds and [[crocodile]]s are part of that group. 
 
 Although [[mammal]]s originated in the [[Upper Triassic]], they did not live like dinosaurs. Mammals spent most of the long Jurassic and Cretaceous periods as small [[nocturnal animals]] living mainly in forests. Most lost their [[color vision]]. Mammals today have some color vision. Most have red-green color blindness, with only two types of [[cone cell]]s. Some [[primate]]s evolved a third type of cone cell, which gives them [[trichromacy]]. Color is needed in forests to spot ripe fruit. 
 
 The Mesozoic is the middle of the three eras that make up the [[Phanerozoic|Phanerozoic eon]]. Before the Mesozoic was the [[Palaeozoic]] era. The K/T extinction in 65 mya also marks the beginning of the [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic era]], the one we live in. 
 
 The three Mesozoic periods were: 
 
 * [[Triassic]] (252–201 mya) 
 **[[Lower Triassic]] (252–247 mya) 
 **[[Middle Triassic]] (247–237 mya) 
 **[[Upper Triassic]] (237–201 mya) 
 * [[Jurassic]] (201–145 mya) 
 **[[Lower Jurassic]] (201–176 mya) 
 **[[Middle Jurassic]] (176–161 mya) 
 **[[Upper Jurassic]] (161–145 mya) 
 * [[Cretaceous]] (145–66 mya) 
 **[[Lower Cretaceous]] (145–100 mya) 
 **[[Upper Cretaceous]] (100–65 mya) 
 
 == Ecology == 
 The ecology of this world was quite different to that of the [[Pleistocene]], the relatively cold era in which humans evolved and live.  
 
 The Mesozoic was a much warmer world, with a higher temperature, and a higher [[sea level]].  There was little or no ice at the [[geographical pole|poles]] and the continents had large areas covered with shallow [[Inland sea|continental seas]]. < ref > Van Andel, Tjeerd H. 2nd ed 1994. ''New views on an old planet''. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-44755-0 < /ref > 
 
 Moreover, the continents were quite near each other, or actually touching.  Many land animals could walk or swim to other continents.  The Mesozoic started with all the continents together in [[Pangaea]].  They began to split apart in early Middle Jurassic times and stayed pretty close for the rest of the Mesozoic. 
 
 Textbooks have always described how the Mesozoic was the age of the dinosaurs, < ref > Benton, Michael J. 2015. ''Vertebrate palaeontology'', 4th ed. Wiley Blackwell 10.3 Mesozoic world, p204. ISBN 978-1-118-40684-7 < /ref >  and now we know birds descended from land dinosaurs.  It was the age, too, of extraordinary marine reptiles.  Mammals were mainly small nocturnal animals which scurried around in the night-times of the great forests.  We know from their loss of [[color vision]] (which is [[trichromatic]] in fish and reptiles) that mammals lived a [[Nocturnal animals|nocturnal]] life. 
 
 === Plants === 
 For most of the Mesozoic, the plants were different from those of today. Only in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] do we find [[flowering plant]]s of the modern kind. Before then [[fern]]s, [[cycad]]s and [[conifer]]s covered the land. They were the typical food of the huge vegetarian dinosaurs. [[Horsetail]]s like ''[[Horsetail|Equisetum]]'' formed the understory of the huge conifer forests. < ref > Husby, Chad E.; Walkowiak, Radosław J. (2012). Zawada, Beth (ed.).
