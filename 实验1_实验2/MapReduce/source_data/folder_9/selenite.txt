'''Selenite''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is SeO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > . It makes the hydrogen selenite ion, HSeO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup >  in neutral conditions. When in [[acid]]ic conditions it makes [[selenous acid]]. They are normally made by heating metal oxides with [[selenium dioxide]]. An example would be [[sodium selenite]]. Selenites are weak [[oxidizing agent]]s.
