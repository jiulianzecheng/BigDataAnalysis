[[File:Glycerin Fischer.svg|thumb|The structure of glycerol]] 
 
 '''Glycerol''' (or '''glycerin''', '''glycerine''') is a simple organic molecule. It is a colorless, odorless, thick [[liquid]] that is widely used during the last step of preparing prescription drugs. Glycerol has three hydrophilic (water-loving) hydroxyl (oxygen-hydrogen) groups that are responsible for its [[solubility]] in [[water]] and its hygroscopic nature (which means it attracts water from the air). The glycerol backbone is central to all [[lipid]]s known as [[triglyceride]]s. It is used is in making [[nitroglycerin]].
