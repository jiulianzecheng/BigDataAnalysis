 A '''ceasefire''' (or '''truce''') is a stoppage of a [[war]] or any armed conflict, where each side of the conflict agrees with the other to stop aggressive actions for some time. Ceasefires may be declared as part of a formal [[peace treaty]], but they have also been called part of an informal understanding between opposing forces.
