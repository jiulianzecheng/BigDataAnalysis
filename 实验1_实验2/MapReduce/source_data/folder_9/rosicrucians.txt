 The '''Rosicrucians''' are a mystical and esoteric secret society that originated in the early 17th century in Europe. The term  " Rosicrucian "  is often used to refer to a movement or a set of philosophical and spiritual beliefs rather than a specific organization. The origins of the Rosicrucian movement are shrouded in mystery, and it's debated whether the movement had actual historical roots or if it was more of a symbolic and allegorical creation. 
 
 The Rosicrucian manifestos, which include works like the  " Fama Fraternitatis "  (The Fame of the Brotherhood) and the  " Confessio Fraternitatis "  (The Confession of the Brotherhood), were published in the early 17th century. These manifestos presented the ideas and principles of the Rosicrucian movement. The manifestos discussed the pursuit of esoteric knowledge, spiritual enlightenment, and the application of alchemical and mystical principles for personal and societal transformation. 
 
 The Rosicrucian movement influenced various aspects of Western esotericism, alchemy, and mysticism. Over the centuries, several organizations have claimed to be connected to the Rosicrucian tradition, each with its own interpretation of its teachings and rituals. These organizations often operate as initiatory societies, with members progressing through different degrees of knowledge and understanding. 
 
 It's important to note that interpretations of Rosicrucianism can vary, and the movement has taken on different forms throughout history. Some modern organizations that identify as Rosicrucian continue to explore spiritual, mystical, and philosophical principles, often incorporating elements of symbolism, alchemy, and mysticism into their teachings.
