 A '''teacher''' is a person who helps people to [[learning|learn]]. A teacher often works in a classroom.  
 
 There are many different kinds of teachers. Some teachers teach young [[child]]ren in [[kindergarten]] or [[primary school]]s. Others teach older children in [[middle school|middle]], junior high and [[high school]]s. Some teachers teach adults in colleges and universities. Some teachers are called [[professor]]s.  
 
 Teachers are usually professionals. They have been to college and got qualifications. They use various methods to teach. Teachers explain new [[knowledge]], write on a [[blackboard]] or [[whiteboard]], sit behind their [[desk]]s on [[chair]]s, help students with their work and mark students' work. They may also use a [[computer]] to write tests, assignments or [[report card]]s for the class. 
 
 Teachers are not always professionals. Parents usually do a lot of teaching before children ever get to school.
