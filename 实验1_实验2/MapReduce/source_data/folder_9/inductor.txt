 An '''inductor''' is an electrical device used in [[electrical circuit]]s because it acts like [[inertia]] in the electrical circuit. Just like inertia opposes the change in state of motion, inductor opposes the change in [[electric current]]. 
 
 An inductor is usually made from a [[coil]] of [[Electrical conductor|conducting]] material, like copper wire, that is then wrapped around a [[magnetic core|core]] made from either air or a magnetic metal.  If you use a more magnetic material as the core, you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor, giving it better inductance. < ref name = " Induct 101 " > {{cite web|url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/vishay/Inductors101.pdf |title=Inductors 101 |publisher=Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.|date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2010-10-02}} < /ref >   Small inductors can also be put onto [[integrated circuit]]s using the same ways that are used to make [[transistor]]s.  Aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case.

 While a [[capacitor]] reacts against changes in voltage, an inductor reacts against changes in current. The inductor affects the current like [[inertia]]. 
 
 In general, the relationship between the time-varying voltage ''v''(''t'') across an inductor with inductance ''L'' and the time-varying current ''i''(''t'') passing through it is described by the [[differential equation]]:

 ==How inductors are used== 
 Inductors are used often in [[analog circuit]]s. < ref name=analog > " [http://www.engineersblogsite.com/inductor.html Inductor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208132236/http://www.engineersblogsite.com/inductor.html |date=2019-12-08 }} " , Engineersblogsite.com, Retrieved June 8, 2016 < /ref >  Two or more inductors that have coupled [[magnetic flux]] make a [[transformer]]. Transformers are used in every power grid around the world. 
 
 Inductors are also used in electrical transmission systems, where they are used to lower the amount of voltage an electrical device gives off or lower the [[fault current]]. 
 Because inductors are heavier than other electrical components, people have been using them in electrical equipment less often. < ref name=analog / > 
 
 Inductors with an iron core are used for audio equipment, power conditioning, inverter systems, rapid transit and industrial power supplies. < ref > " [http://www.agilemagco.com/power-inductors/iron-core Highly Efficient Iron Core Inductors] " , Agile Magnetics, Retrieved June 8, 2016 < /ref > 
 
 
 Electrical engineers like to reduce diagrams of electrical circuits, no matter how complicated, to an ''equivalent circuit'' consisting of a network of just ''four'' different types of component.  These four basic components are ''emfs'', ''resistors'', ''capacitors'', and ''inductors''.  An inductor is usually represented by a little [[solenoid]] in circuit diagrams. In practice, inductors generally consist of short air-cored solenoids wound from enameled copper wire.
