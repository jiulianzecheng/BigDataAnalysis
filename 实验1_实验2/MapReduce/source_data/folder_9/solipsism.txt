'''Solipsism''' ({{small|pronounced:}} {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-ncalif-solipsism.ogg|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|ᵻ|p|s|ɪ|z|əm}}) is the view that a person has no reason to believe anything [[wikt:exist|exist]]s except their own [[mind]]. < ref > {{cite dictionary|entry=Solipsism|dictionary=Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=November 22, 2020|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solipsism }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Solipsism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=June 14, 2019|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/solipsism }} < /ref >  It is a theory that first appeared in [[ancient philosophy]]. It mainly means to [[wikt:reject|reject]] or [[wikt:doubt|doubt]] that other people exist.  " {{lang|la|Solus}} "  and  " {{lang|la|ipse}} "  are the [[Latin]] words for  " alone "  and  " self " , which is where the word  " solipsism "  comes from. Some kinds of solipsism say that everything outside a person's own mind (including other people) is only [[wikt:imaginary|imaginary]]. Other kinds of solipsism instead say that nothing outside a person's own mind is [[wikt:certain|certain]]. 
 
 Denial of material existence, in itself, is not solipsism. Solipsism also rejects or doubts that other people exist. As an [[epistemology|epistemological]] view, it is the concept that nothing but one's own mind can be ''certain'' to exist. The existence of other minds, in this view, is considered a possibility, but not certainty. And even time does not stop just because there would be nobody to experience it (which is probably going to happen in the end of the universe when there would be simply nothing) < ref >  Dancy, Jonathan; Ernest Sosa; Matthias Steup edited A Companion to Epistemology : Second Edition Volume 4 Wiley Blackwell 2010 page 747 < /ref >
