 A '''continent''' is a large area of the [[land]] on [[Earth]] that is joined. 
 
 There are no strict rules for what land is considered a continent, but in general it is agreed there are six or seven continents in the world, including [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]] (or [[Australasia]]), < ref > Either are accepted terms < /ref >  and [[South America]]. < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134805/continent Continent] (2009).

 The most populous continent by population is Asia, followed by Africa. The third most populous continent is Europe. The fourth most populous is North America, and then South America. In sub-Saharan Africa, the largest age group are denarians (in their teens). In north Africa, the largest age group are vicenarian (in their twenties). In Europe, most people are tricenarian (in their thirties) or quadragenarian (in their forties). < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-08/these-maps-show-where-world-s-youngest-and-oldest-people-live|title=These maps show where the world's youngest and oldest people live|website=Public Radio International}} < /ref > 
 
 == Continents == 
 Geologists use the term ''continent'' to mean [[continental crust]], a platform of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock]], largely of [[granite|granitic]] composition. Continental crust is less dense and much thicker than [[oceanic crust]], which is why it  " floats "  higher than oceanic crust on the underlying [[Earth's mantle|mantle]]. This explains why the continents form high platforms surrounded by deep ocean basins. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Levin |first1=Harold L. |title=The earth through time |url=https://archive.org/details/earththroughtime0009edlevi |date=2010 |publisher=J.

 === Australia === 
 Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo|title=Australia - Oceania :: Australia—The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2009-06-03|archive-date=2016-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515201241/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook//geos/as.html#Geo|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Others say that Australia is part of a larger continent, such as Australasia, or [[Oceania]]. [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm|title=Australia Map / Oceania Map / Map of Australia / Map of Oceania - Worldatlas.com|website=www.worldatlas.com}} < /ref >  [[Australasia]] includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line. 
 
 : " It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses " . < ref > Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition. < /ref > 
 
 === Zealandia === 
 Zealandia is an almost entirely submerged land mass, and 93% of it still remains under water. Zealandia may have broken off the Australian plate between 85 and 130 million years ago. < ref name= " Te Ara " > {{cite encyclopedia|author1=Keith Lewis |author2=Scott D. Nodder |author3=Lionel Carter |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/OceanStudyAndConservation/SeaFloorGeology/1/en |title=Zealandia: the New Zealand continent |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2007|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hf1Kw3GQ?url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/sea-floor-geology/page-1 |archivedate=26 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}} < /ref > 
 
 === North and South America === 
 North America and South America together are often described as one continent,  " the Americas " , or simply  " America " . This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America. 
 
 === Eurasia === 
 [[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, rather it is a recognition that the landmasses of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both regions. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north–south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia. 
 
 When [[Britain|British]] people talk about  " the Continent "  (or  " Continental "  things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html|title=Encarta World English Dictionary|accessdate=2008-08-05|year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html|archivedate=2009-10-31|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like  " Continental [[breakfast]] "  ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an  " English breakfast "  which is a cooked breakfast). 
 
 Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], with [[Mount Everest]], are still being built up today. < ref name=holt > {{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url =https://archive.org/details/holtsciencetechn00na_0| isbn = 0-03-055667-8}} < /ref > 
 
 === Antarctica === 
 Antarctica is Earth's fifth largest continent. Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, covers Earth's [[South Pole]]. It has a surface area of ~13.6 –14 million km < sup > 2 < /sup > : this is about 1.4 times the size of Europe, The continent only has two seasons, a brief summer and a long winter.

 == Origin of continents == 
 A [[craton]] is an old and stable part of the continental [[lithosphere]]. It is the Earth's two topmost layers, the [[Earth's crust|crust]] and the uppermost [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. 
 
 There are various hypotheses of how cratons have been formed.. Continents may have been formed by giant meteorite impacts in the first billion years of Earth's existence. < ref > Kearey P.; Klepeis K.A.; Vine F.J. 2009. ''Global tectonics''. 3rd ed, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell ISBN 9781405107778 < /ref >  The question is not yet settled. What is clear is that the cratons are very old, and are the basis for the continents we see today.
