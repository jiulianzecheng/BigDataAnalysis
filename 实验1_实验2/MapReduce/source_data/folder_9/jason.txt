 Jason and the Argonauts went to find the [[Golden Fleece]]. His father was [[Aeson]], the rightful [[king]] of [[Iolcus]]. Jason fell in love with the daughter of the Golden Fleece's owner. Her name was [[Medea]]. Medea helped Jason get the Golden Fleece from her father. Jason and Medea killed the owner of the Golden Fleece and returned to Jason's city, Iolcus. Medea then killed Jason's half-brother Pelias so Jason could be in charge. When she was found out, Jason and Medea went to live in the Greek city of [[Corinth]]. Jason then married the princess of Corinth so they could stay. The story of Jason, the Argonauts, and the Golden Fleece is told in two modern movies: ''[[Hercules (1958 movie)|Hercules]]'' starring [[Steve Reeves]], and ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 movie)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' starring Todd Armstrong.
