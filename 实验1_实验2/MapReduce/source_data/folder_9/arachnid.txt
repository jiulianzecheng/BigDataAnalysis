 == Definition == 
 Arachnids are [[mwod:arachnid|defined as coming from the class of Arachnida]]. The requirements for this class is to have two body regions; a cephalothorax and an abdomen; 4 pairs of legs; and 2 pairs of mouthpart appendages, the chelicerae and the pedipalps. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Class Arachnida {{!}} Department of Entomology|url=https://entomology.unl.edu/class-arachnida|access-date=2021-01-20|website=entomology.unl.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Anatomy== 
 All adult arachnids have four pairs of legs, and arachnids may be easily distinguished from [[insect]]s by this fact, since insects have three pairs of legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages that have become adapted for feeding, defense, and sensory perception. The first pair, the [[chelicera]]e, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair of appendages, the [[pedipalp]]s have been adapted for feeding, locomotion, and/or [[reproduction|reproductive]] functions. 
 
 Like all arthropods, arachnids have an [[exoskeleton]]. They also have an internal structure of [[cartilage]]-like tissue, to which certain muscle groups are attached. < ref > {{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/750069|pmid = 750069|year = 1978|last1 = Kovoor|first1 = J.|title = Natural calcification of the prosomatic endosternite in the Phalangiidae (Arachnida:Opiliones)|journal = Calcified Tissue Research|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 267–269|doi = 10.1007/BF02013269|s2cid = 23119386}} < /ref > 
 
 Arachnids have no [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] or wings. Their body is organized into two parts: the [[cephalothorax]], and the [[abdomen]]. 
 
 ==Physiology== 
 There are some [[adaptation]]s for life on land. They have internal respiratory surfaces. These may be [[trachea]] (tubes), or a modification of gills into a 'book lung'. This is an internal series of [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e used for gas exchange with the air. 
 
 ==Diet and Digestive System== 
 Arachnids are mostly [[carnivore|carnivorous]], feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects and other small animals. Only the [[harvestmen]] and some [[mite]]s eat solid food particles. Predigestion avoids exposure to internal [[parasitism|parasites]]. < ref name=pinto2007 > Pinto-da-Rocha R. Machado G.  &  Giribet G. 2007. ''Harvestmen — the biology of Opiliones''. Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0-674-02343-9}} < /ref >  Several groups secrete [[Poison|venom]] from specialized [[gland]]s to kill prey or enemies. Several mites are external [[parasite#Terminology of parasitism|parasites]], and some of them are carriers of [[disease]] ([[Vector (biology)|vectors]]). 
 
 Arachnids pour digestive juices produced in their stomachs over their prey after killing it with their pedipalps and chelicerae. The digestive juices  rapidly turn the prey into a [[broth]] of [[nutrients]] which the arachnid sucks into a pre-buccal cavity located immediately in front of the mouth. Behind the mouth is a muscular, [[pharynx]], which acts as a pump, sucking the food through the mouth and on into the [[oesophagus]] and [[stomach]]. In some arachnids, the oesophagus also acts as an additional pump. 
 
 == Myth == 
 The word ''Arachnida'' comes from the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] for 'spider'. In legend, a girl called [[Arachne]] was turned into a spider by the [[Deity|goddess]] [[Athena]]. Arachne said she'd win a [[weaving]] [[contest]] against the goddess. Athena  won, but Arachne became angry, and started to weave an insult to the gods. Then Athena turned her into a spider for her disrespect. 
 
 == Orders == 
 The subdivisions of the arachnids are usually treated as [[Order (biology)|orders]]. Historically, [[mite]]s and [[tick]]s were treated as a single order, Acari. However, molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that the two groups do not form a single clade; morphological similarities are probably due to convergence. They are now usually treated as two separate taxa – Acariformes, mites, and Parasitiformes, ticks – which may be ranked as orders or superorders. The arachnid subdivisions are listed below alphabetically; numbers of species are approximate. 
 * [[Acariformes]] – mites (32,000 species) 
 * [[Amblypygi]] –  " blunt rump "  tail-less whip scorpions with front legs modified into [[whip]]-like sensory structures as long as 25 & nbsp;cm or more (153 species) 
 * [[Spider|Araneae]] – spiders (40,000 species) 
 *†[[Haptopoda]] – extinct arachnids apparently part of the [[Tetrapulmonata]], the group including spiders and whip scorpions (1 species) 
 * [[Opilioacariformes]] – harvestman-like mites (10 genera) 
 * [[Opiliones]] – phalangids, harvestmen or daddy-long-legs (6,300 species) 
 * [[Palpigradi]] – microwhip scorpions (80 species) 
 * [[Parasitiformes]] – ticks (12,000 species) 
 *†[[Phalangiotarbi]] – extinct arachnids of uncertain affinity (30 species) 
 * [[Pseudoscorpion]]ida – pseudoscorpions (3,000 species) 
 * [[Ricinulei]] – ricinuleids, hooded tickspiders (60 species) 
 * [[Schizomida]] –  " split middle "  whip scorpions with divided exoskeletons (220 species) 
 * [[Scorpion]]es – scorpions (2,000 species) 
 * [[Solifugae]] – solpugids, windscorpions, sun spiders or camel spiders (900 species) 
 * [[Thelyphonida]] (also called Uropygi) – whip scorpions or vinegaroons, forelegs modified into sensory appendages and a long tail on abdomen tip (100 species) 
 *†[[Trigonotarbida]] – extinct (late [[Silurian]] to early [[Permian]]) 
 *†[[Uraraneida]] – extinct spider-like arachnids, but with a  " tail "  and no [[Spinneret (spider)|spinnerets]] (2 species) 
 *[[Xiphosura]] – horseshoe crabs (4 living species) < ref name =  " Sharma2019 "  / > 
 
 It is estimated that 98,000 arachnid species have been described, and that there may be up to 600,000 in total. < ref > {{Cite book |first=Arthur D. |last=Chapman |title=Numbers of living species in Australia and the world |publisher=Department of the Environment and Heritage |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-642-56850-2 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/pubs/number-living-species-report.pdf}} < /ref >
