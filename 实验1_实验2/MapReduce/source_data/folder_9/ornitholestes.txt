 '''''Ornitholestes''''' was a [[carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]] which lived in the [[Upper Jurassic]] period about 156{{ndash}}145 million years ago. It was about 2 metres long (6.6 feet), half of which was its long tail. Only one specimen of it has ever been found. 
 
 It is one of a group of small, fast-running dinosaurs which are classified as early [[Coelurosaur]]s. It is known from a partial [[skeleton]] found near [[Medicine Bow]], [[Wyoming]], in 1900. It was described by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Henry Fairfield Osborn|Henry F. Osborn]] in 1903. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Ornitholestes'' was a [[bipedal]] runner. Its small head suggests it ate small mammals, lizards, frogs, and hatchling dinosaurs. It could grasp prey with both hands. It is likely that all coelurosaurs had feathers. < ref > {{cite book
