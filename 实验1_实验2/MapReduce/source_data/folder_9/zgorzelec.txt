 After the [[Second world war|Second World War]], the German city [[Görlitz]] was divided; the River [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] became the border. The part east of the river was in Poland. It is called '''Zgorzelec''' today. As of 2022, about 30,000 people lived in the city. About 55,000 people live in the German city Görlitz. Both Zgorzelec and Görlitz are used for both cities, so it may be necessary to add the country, to be more precise.
