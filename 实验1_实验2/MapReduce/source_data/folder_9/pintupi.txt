 '''Pintupi''' is an [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] group who are part of the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] cultural group. Their homeland is in the area west of Lake MacDonald and [[Lake Mackay]] in [[Western Australia]]. This is a very [[wikt:remote|remote]] part of Australian desert. Because of this, the Pintupi were among the last Aboriginals in Australia to leave their traditional way of life. Most of the Pintupi were [[wikt:displacement|displaced]] (forced to leave) their homeland in the middle the 20th century, because of [[missile|sti testing]] being done at [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera]]. They were moved into settlements to the east and west of their country, such as [[Papunya]], [[Balgo]], [[Haasts Bluff]] and even as far away as [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg]]. They ended up [[wikt:scattered|scattered]] into different communities. Within a few years, several hundreds of Pintupi had died from foreign [[disease]] and [[infection]]. < ref name= " myers " > {{cite journal|journal=American Ethnologist|title=Locating ethnographic practice: Romance, reality and politics in the Outback|author=Myers, Fred|volume=15|issue=4|date=November 1988|pages=609–624|doi=10.1525/ae.1988.15.4.02a00010|url=https://files.nyu.edu/frm1/public/source_files/pdfs/myers%20locating.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Others had problems with [[alcoholism]] and violence – having lived in small groups for most of their lives, they found it hard to deal with [[conflict]]. 
 
 During the 1960s, the [[assimilation]]ist policies of the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] government had a major effect on the [[wikt:mentality|mentality]] of many Pintupi. Part of the policy led to hundreds of Pintupi children being taken away from their parents and put into [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] or [[foster care]] (this is now known as the [[Stolen Generation]]).  
 
 Beginning in the 1970s, there was a strong push within the Pintupi community at Papunya to return to their historical lands. They moved back west in 1981 to set up [[Kintore]] (''Waḻungurru''). Further west, [[Kiwirrkurra]] was founded in 1983, close to Lake Mackay. 
 
 ==Skin groupings== 
 {{further|Australian Aboriginal kinship}} 
 The Pintupi have a complex [[kinship]] system, with eight different skin groups. Males and females have different [[prefix]]es ( " Tj "  for males,  " N "  for females). These names define kinship [[relationship]]s. They dictate who can marry whom. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not [[surname]]s in the sense used by Europeans. < ref name= " CLC " > {{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=2009-10-23|archive-date=2010-10-11|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html & date=2010-10-11|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " de Brabander " > {{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}} < /ref >
