 The '''Jacobins''' were a group of radicalists who supported [[The French Revolution]]. 
 Their leader was [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], and they were in power of the French government from June of 1793 to July of 1794. 
 
 Initially founded in 1789 by anti-royalist deputies from Brittany, the club grew into a nationwide republican movement, with a membership estimated at a half million or more. 
 
 Members of the Jacobins would often belong to mainly to the less prosperous section of the society (the working class). They included [[shopkeepers]], [[artisans]], [[Chef|cooks]], [[Shoemaking|shoemakers]] and [[daily wage workers]]. 
 
 They dressed differently by wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by [[dock workers]].
