'''Eurolang''' is an [[international planned language]] created by Philip Hunt between [[1995]] and [[1998]] in order to be a language for the [[European Union]]. The author stated as a principle of the design that the language should be very easy to learn for Europeans. In contrast with other languages like [[Esperanto]], Eurolang includes many words directly borrowed from English. 
 
 At present there's no known community of active speakers of Eurolang. The website of the author in which he described the language has disappeared from the net.
