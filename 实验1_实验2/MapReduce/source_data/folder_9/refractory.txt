 A '''refractory''' is a [[material]] that can stand high [[temperature]]. It is used in [[furnace]]s, [[kiln]]s, [[incinerator]]s and [[reactor]]s. Materials to make refractory must be [[Chemical substance|chemically]] and physically stable at high temperature, such as [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]], [[silica]], [[magnesia]] and lime.
