 '''Chirality''' is when an object is present in two forms which are mirror images of each other. < ref > The word ''chiral'' is derived from the Greek word for hand, χειρ (/cheir/). < /ref > 
 
 The two forms cannot be superimposed. Human [[hand]]s are chiral. The left hand is a mirror image of the right hand. You cannot turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other. This is why you can not put a left handed [[glove]] on your right hand, or shake the right hand of a person using your left hand. 
 
 == In chemistry == 
 In [[chemistry]], chirality refers to [[molecule]]s. If a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but ''otherwise identical''. 
 
 Chemists call these ''[[enantiomer]]s'' or ''optical [[isomer]]s''. Because the difference between right and left hands is easy to understand, chemists call enantiomers either '[[right-handed|right-]]' or '[[left-handed]]'. A mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers is called a ''racemic mixture''. 
 
 Molecular chirality is quite common. It is found in [[stereochemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]]. 
 
 The [[symmetry]] of a molecule (or any other object) tells us whether it is chiral.  A molecule is ''achiral'' (not chiral) if it has an axis of symmetry. 
 
 === Racemic mixtures === 
 A '''racemic''' mixture is one which has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. 
 
 == Homochiralism in biology == 
 Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. Most of these compounds are of the same chirality. Most amino acids are  < small > L < /small >  (left-handed) and sugars are  < small > D < /small > . (right-handed). Proteins made of  < small > L < /small >  amino acids, are known as ''left-handed proteins'', whereas  < small > D < /small >  amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''. 
 
 The origin of '''homochirality''' in the first place is much discussed. < ref > Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  2008. ''Amino acids and the asymmetry of life''. Springer. {{ISBN|3-540-76885-8}} < /ref >  Most believe that the original origin of chiralities was purely random. They think if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, the chemistry might have different chirality. Other theories are possible. < ref > [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html], New Scientist, 2005. < /ref > 
 
 [[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, usually only work with one enantiomer of a chiral substrate. Imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind. 
 
 It was economical for life-forms to adopt one form or the other of each type of chiral compound. That way we do not need two enzymes for every [[chemical reaction]] which involves chirality.
