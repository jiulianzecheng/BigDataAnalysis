 '''''Prionosuchus''''' is a [[genus]] of extremely large [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] [[amphibian]]s from the Middle [[Permian]] (270 million years ago). Its remains were found in [[Brazil]]. 
 
 ==Description== 
 The fragmentary remains of this animal were found in the  [[Parnaiba]] Basin of northeast Brazil. < ref > Price L.I.  1948. Um anfibio Labirinthodonte da formacao Pedra de Fogo, Estado do Maranhao. ''Ministerio da Agricultura, Departamento Nacional da Producao ineral Divisao de Geologia e Mineralogia'', Boletim n. 124, p. 7-32. 
 < /ref >  With an estimated length of 9 m (30 ft), ''Prionosuchus'' is the largest amphibian ever found.

 It had an elongated and tapered snout, numerous sharp teeth, long body, short legs, and a tail adapted for swimming.  
 
 Cox and Hutchinson re-evaluated ''Prionosuchus'' in 1991 and thought it was synonymous with the genus ''[[Platyoposaurus]]'' from Russia. < ref > Cox C.B. and Hutchinson P. 1991. Fishes and amphibians from the Late Permian Pedrado Fogo Formation of northern Brazil. ''Palaeontology'', '''34''': 561-573 < /ref >  However, ''Platyoposaurus'' had a total length of only 2.5 meters (8.2 ft), which suggested that the two animals were at least different species. The age of the sediments suggested the two were not comtemporaries. < ref > Mussa D  &  Coimbra AM., 1987, Novas perspectivas de comparação entre as tafofloras permianas (de lenhos) das Bacias do Parnaíba e do Paraná. X Congresso brasileiro de Paleontologia. Rio de Janeiro. Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias, 2: 901-922. < /ref > < ref > Caldas E.B. ''et al'' 1989. Nota sobre a ocorrência de uma floresta petrificada de idade permiana em Teresina, Piauí. Bol IG-USP, Publ Esp 7: 69-87. < /ref >  Most paleontologists consider ''Prionosuchus''  as a valid genus. 
 
 ==Paleoecology== 
 [[File:Prionosuchus scale.svg|thumb|right|150px|Size of ''Prionosuchus plummeri'' relative to a human]] 
 ''Prionosuchus'' lived in a humid and tropical environment as indicated by the petrified forest of the Pedra do Fogo formation in which the fossil was found. The strata of [[siltstone]]s, [[shale]]s and [[limestone]]s were deposited in [[lagoon]]al and [[fluvial]] environments. < ref > Schobbenhaus C. ''et al'' 1984. ''Geologia do Brasil''. p501 < /ref >  Other animals discovered in the same rocks include fish (primitive [[shark]]s, [[palaeoniscid]]s, and [[lungfish]]) and amphibians. 
 
 Its general appearance was similar to a modern crocodile, such as the [[gharial]]. It probably had a similar lifestyle as an ambush aquatic predator feeding on fish and other aquatic animals. 
 
 It was one of a group known as the Archegosaurs. < ref > Carroll R.L. 1988. ''Vertebrate paleontology and evolution''. W.H. Freeman. < /ref >  The archegosaurs were a group of [[temnospondyl]]s that occupied the ecological niche of crocodiles and [[alligator]]s during the Permian. The smaller European genus ''[[Archegosaurus]]'' is typical. The group went extinct at the end of the Permian. In the [[Triassic]], the [[niche]] was filled by other temnospondyls and by reptiles such as the [[phytosaur]]s.
