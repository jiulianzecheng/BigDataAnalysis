 '''''Fabrosaurus''''' was a small, early, plant-eating [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[Africa]] during the [[Lower Jurassic]], roughly 199 to 189 million years ago (mya). Very little is known about ''Fabrosaurus'' since only a portion of a jaw has been found. ''Fabrosaurus'' is a dubious genus; it may be the same dinosaur as ''[[Lesothosaurus]]''.
