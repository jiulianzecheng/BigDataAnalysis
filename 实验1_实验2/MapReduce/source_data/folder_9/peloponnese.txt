 The '''Peloponnese''' is a large [[peninsula]] in [[Greece]]. It is the part of Greece which is south of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. 
 
 The Peloponnese has many mountains and a long jagged [[coastline]]. The highest part is Mount [[Taygetus]] in the south.  
 
 There are four south-pointing peninsulas within the Peloponnese. They are called [[Messenia]], the [[Mani Peninsula]], [[Epidaurus]], and the [[Argolid]]. 
 
 There are also two groups of islands near the Peloponnese. In the east there are the [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] and in the west there are the [[Ionian Islands]]. There is also the island of [[Kythira]], which is near to the Epidaurus peninsula. Kythira is often thought of as part of the Ionian Islands. 
 
 The Peloponnese has had people living on it since [[prehistoric]] times. Its name means ''Island of [[Pelops]]''. Pelops was a person from [[Greek mythology]], who took over the island. During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the peninsula was known as the Morea.
