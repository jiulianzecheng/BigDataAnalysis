 The '''Foglia''' is the northernmost river of the [[Marche]] region of [[Italy]]. 
 
 In ancient times it was known as ''Pisaurus'', < ref > {{cite book |title=Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World: Map-By-Map Directory |editor=Richard J.A. Talbert |volume=I |year=2000 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ and Oxford, UK |isbn=0691049459 |page=611 }} < /ref >  as it flows into the [[Adriatic Sea]] at ''Pisaurum'' (modern [[Pesaro]]), the last important [[Trade|trading]] centre along the river. It was also known as the ''Isaurus''; < ref > John Lemprière, ''A Classical Dictionary, Containing a Copious Account of All the Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, With the Value of Coins, Weights, and Measures, Used Among the Greeks and Romans, and a Chronological Table'', New Edition edited by F.D.

 ==Geography== 
 The Foglia river has a length of about {{Convert|90|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. Its first {{Convert|11|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} are in [[Tuscany]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://sira.arpat.toscana.it/sira/idrografia/co_E0010000000000000000.htm |title= Corsi d'acqua FIUME FOGLIA  |publisher=Portale del Sistema Informativo Regionale dell'Ambiente della Toscana (SIRA) |language=it |access-date=25 June 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 Its [[Tributary|tributaries]] are only small [[stream]]s. 
 
 ===Course=== 
 The [[River source|sources]] of the Foglia is are in the [[province of Arezzo]] ([[Tuscany]]), near ''Sasso Aguzzo'', a hill between the  ''[[Comune|comuni]]'' of [[Sestino]] and [[Badia Tedalda]], at an [[altitude]] of about {{Convert|980|m|ft|0|abbr=on }}. 
 
 Then it flows east trough the ''comuni'' [[Sestino]],  [[Piandimeleto]], [[Lunano]], [[Sassocorvaro]] (where a [[dam]] forms an artificial [[lake]] called '''Lake of Mercatale'''), [[Auditore]], [[Montecalvo in Foglia]], [[Vallefoglia]], [[Montelabbate]] and, near the mouth, [[Pesaro]]. 
 
 Two ''comuni'' have, in their names, the name of the riverː [[Montecalvo in Foglia]] and [[Vallefoglia]].
