'''Sewage''' or domestic wastewater is the [[liquid]] waste produced by people when using the [[toilet]], having a [[bath]] or [[shower]] or washing [[clothes]] and [[dish]]es.  In some places, it also includes [[rain]]-water falling on [[house]]s and [[road]]s.  It can also have liquid waste from [[factory|factories]] in it.  It flows in pipes called sewers to be cleaned up at a [[sewage treatment]] works. 
 
 Sewage is mostly [[water]] but it also has many [[microbe]]s some of which can be harmful.  It can have many [[chemical]]s in it which can also cause harm to animals and humans.  Most sewage in poor counties is not treated and may spread disease. A problem that occurs sometimes is a sewage spill which can be damaging to health and wildlife.  < ref > {{cite web |last1=Matthews |first1=Chris |title='Absolutely sinking raw sewage' pouring into sea as people swim in poo |url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/local-news/absolutely-sinking-raw-sewage-pouring-8649966 |website=BristolLive |language=en |date=3 August 2023}} < /ref >

 The temperature of sewage tends to be slightly higher than in drinking water but it is more stable than the ambient temperature. The color of fresh sewage is slightly grey, whereas older sewage (also called  " septic sewage " ) is dark grey or black. The [[odor]] of fresh sewage is  " oily "  and unpleasant. Older sewage has an unpleasant foul odor due to [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas and other [[decomposition]] by-products. Sewage can have high [[turbidity]] from suspended solids.  < ref name= " Tchobanoglous-2003 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48053912|title=Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=George Tchobanoglous, Franklin L.
