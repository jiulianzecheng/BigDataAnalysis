'''Herpetology''' is the branch of [[zoology]] concerned with [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. It is about [[cold-blooded]] animals like [[salamander]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[tuatara]]s and [[crocodilia]]ns. 
 ==Herp== 
 " Herp "  is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term  " herpetile " . [[Linnaeus]]  grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles.  
 ==Batrachology== 
 '''Batrachology''' is the study of [[amphibian]]s. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite [[pet]]s.
