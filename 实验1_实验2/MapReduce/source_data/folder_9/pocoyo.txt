 '''''Pocoyo''''' is a Spanish [[television program|children's television series]] that aired for four series since 2005. Pocoyo does not talk very much. He has a few friends, including a [[bird]] named Baby Bird, an [[elephant]] named Elly, an [[octopus]] named Fred, a [[dog]] named Loula, a [[duck]] named Pato and a girl named Nina who also does not talk very much, but also speaks her own launguage. 
 
 ==Characters== 
 [[File:Pocoyo.jpg|thumb|Pocoyo representation in a playground]] 
 * '''Pocoyo''' is the main character of the series. He is a young boy full of curiosity who loves to play games and discover new things. He always wears a blue three-flap hat, a blue jacket with a yellow zipper, and a pair of blue pants and shoes. He is 4 years old; his  " birthday "  is October 14. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://pocoyo.blogs.com/pocoyo/2006/10/faq_10.html | title = FAQ (1.0) | date = 2006-10-10 | accessdate = 2007-11-19 | publisher = The Official Pocoyo Blog | archive-date = 2007-12-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227220316/http://pocoyo.blogs.com/pocoyo/2006/10/faq_10.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  His best friends are Baby Bird, Elly, Fred, Loula and Pato. He has a vehicle called the Vamoosh which he can use to travel under the water, in the air or through space. He is voiced by [[Montana Smedley]] in series 2, but occasionally, by [[Alex Marty]] in series 1. 
 * '''The Narrator''' (del Rio, Fry, or Hughes) speaks over the entire show and often communicates directly with the characters. Pocoyo has a good relationship with him and is always really delighted to see (hear) him. The narrator is also at times physically involved in the events of the episodes, making him more of a heard-but-not-seen character rather than a strict narrator. 
 * '''Baby Bird''' is the small, active and ''loud'' baby son of his mother Sleepy Bird, who gets into tricky situations from which he is rescued by Pocoyo. Named  " Pajarito "  in Spanish version ('little bird'). 
 * '''Elly''' is a pink [[elephant]] who always wears a blue back-pack. She loves making [[biscuits]] and [[tea]], and she also has a [[doll]] that she loves very much. Despite her size, she is graceful and gentle, capable of [[ballet]] dancing. She usually rides around on her pink [[kick scooter|scooter]]. 
 * '''Fred (the Octopus)''' is a red [[octopus]] (although shown with only 4 legs instead of 8, as to make animation rendering simpler) who speaks in gibberish like Caterpillar, and is very fond of singing. He appears in random episodes, sometimes as a major character, sometimes in passing. As of Season Two, he is sometimes referred to as 'Fred'. He sounds similar to Pee-wee Herman. 
 * '''Loula''' is Pocoyo's orange-yellow [[pet]] puppy and companion. Originally, the character's name was Lucas, in tribute to Creator and Director Guillermo García Carsi's dog, but for the series was lacking female characters so it was changed to Loula. 
 * '''Pato''' is a yellow [[duck]] who wears nothing but a small [[green]] hat. Pato means duck in Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and [[Papiamento]]. A favourite amongst the young children due to his enjoyable dancing. Although friendly, Pato is the most fussy and impatient character (indicated by his beak that bends in an angle when disappointed or shocked); on occasion he completely loses his temper, jumping up and down and quacking furiously. He is used as a [[jackhammer]] or [[missile]] or a ''[[hat]]'' and can become a [[helicopter]]. 
 * '''The Children''' are a group of kids who, like The Narrator, speak over the show, answering questions asked by The Narrator in order to assist Pocoyo in solving a problem or to let Pocoyo in on what's going on. 
 
 * '''Nina''' is another human character who is introduced in the 4th Season episode of the same name. She is a young girl similar to Pocoyo (likely younger than him) who has red hair, wears a lime green hoodie with two antennas, lime green shorts, and lime green shoes. Like Pato, She greatly loves plants and nature. She naturally speaks mostly a form of gibberish with Japanese or Spanish accent, but can also speak fluent English, though not as much as Pocoyo. She appears to be very fond of Pocoyo, always playing together like siblings. One image shows Nina kissing Pocoyo's cheeks, implying that they have a relationship. Her name resembles  " niña " , Spanish for  " girl " . Thanks to her robotic pet called Roberto (pronounced Roh-bear-toe), it has the ability to shrink where anyone can be shrunk as well. She replaces Loula's bit in the title sequence (except in her debut appearance and the episodes where she's absent). She is voiced by [[Noela Rodriguez]].
