 '''Aerogel''' is a [[gel]] in which the [[liquid]] part has been replaced with a [[gas]] (usually [[air]]). It was invented in 1931 by Samuel Stephens Kistler. The most common type of aerogel is [[silica]] aerogel, which is made from the same molecule as [[glass]]. It is a [[solid]] material that is almost as light as [[air]]. It is the world's lightest material. < ref > Quick, Darren (March 24, 2013). [http://www.gizmag.com/graphene-aerogel-worlds-lightest/26784/ Graphene aerogel takes worldâ€™s lightest material crown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325182654/http://www.gizmag.com/graphene-aerogel-worlds-lightest/26784/ |date=2013-03-25 }}. gizmag.com < /ref >  Its melting point is 1200 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos. Aerogel is the best [[Heat|thermal]] insulator available and can be used in construction in place of [[fiberglass]] insulation. It allows better insulation with less material, although it is much more expensive than fiberglass. It is also brittle, making it more difficult to install than fiberglass. Most aerogel is not water-resistant, and even small amounts of water can destroy it. It is also safer than fiberglass or [[asbestos]] because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs. < ref > [http://aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf Cryogel 5201, 10201 Safety Data Sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223111216/http://www.aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf |date=2010-12-23 }}.
