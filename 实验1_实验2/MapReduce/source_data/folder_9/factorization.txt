'''Factorization''' (also called '''factorisation''' and '''factoring''') is taking a [[composite number]] apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number.  These smaller numbers are called factors or [[divisor]]s.  1 is a factor of all numbers. 
 
 Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite number into [[prime number]]s that can be multiplied to give the larger number.  Note that since 1 is not prime, it is not included in the prime factorization. 
 
 For example, 12 can be factored as 4 & nbsp; & times; & nbsp;3. Since 4 is not a prime number, that is not its prime factorization.  12's prime factorization is in fact 3 & nbsp; & times; & nbsp;2 & nbsp; & times; & nbsp;2. 
 
 The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered, for example, starting with the smallest number. For example, 72=2^3*3^2.  The factorization of every number is [[wikt:unique|unique]].  This generalizes to: 
 
 # Every number has a unique prime factorization 
 # Every prime factorization corresponds to a unique number 
 
 Since finding the numbers to multiply together is very difficult for large numbers, this fact can be used in [[cryptography]].

 This is how one type of [[polynomial]] is factored. 
 
 < math > x^2+{\color{Green}9x}+20 < /math > 
 
 Find two numbers that add up to 9 and can be multiplied to get 20. Here, these numbers are 4 and 5. 
 
 < math > =x^2+{\color{Green}4x+5x}+20 < /math > 
 
 < math > =(x^2+4x)+(5x+20) < /math > 
 
 < math > =x(x+4)+5(x+4) < /math > 
 
 < math > =(x+5)(x+4) < /math >
