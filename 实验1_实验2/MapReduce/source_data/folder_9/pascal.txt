 '''Pascal''' is a [[programming language]]. 
 It was created in [[1970]] by [[Niklaus Wirth]], to help people learn how to make computer programs. 
 
 == Development == 
 Now, there are many different dialects of the language, some of which support [[object-oriented programming]]. 
 In 1990 the “Pascal” and “Extended Pascal” standards were registered with the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 Every [[Variable#Variables in computer science|variable]] has to be declared before it is used. 
 Pascal is a strongly typed programming language: 
 Every variable has a [[data type]]. 
 You are only allowed to assign values to the variable that are valid for the data type. 
 This ensures that the programmer does not make unintentional mistakes. 
 
 Pascal is a [[imperative programming|imperative language]]. 
 The language distinguishes between procedures and [[function]]s. 
 A  < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  inline > function < /syntaxhighlight >  returns a value, a  < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  inline > procedure < /syntaxhighlight >  does not. 
 As such, a  < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  inline > function < /syntaxhighlight >  call appears in an expression, whereas a  < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  inline > procedure < /syntaxhighlight >  invocation is a statement. 
 
 == Code samples == 
 This code prints [[Hello world program| < syntaxhighlight lang= " text "  inline > Hello world! < /syntaxhighlight > ]] at console window: 
 < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  line= " 1 " > 
 program helloWorld(output); 
 begin 
 	writeLn('Hello world!'); 
 	{ which is short for: writeLn(output, 'Hello world!); } 
 end. 
 < /syntaxhighlight > 
 
 This code calculate [[factorial]] of a positive integer, using [[recursion]]. 
 < syntaxhighlight lang= " pascal "  line= " 1 " > 
 program factorialDemo(input, output); 
 
 function factorial(n: integer): integer; 
 begin 
 	if n  <  2 then 
 	begin 
 		{ the result of a function is stored in a variable } 
 		{ that has the same name as the function: } 
 		factorial := 1; 
 	end 
 	else 
 	begin 
 		factorial := n * factorial(n - 1); 
 	end 
 end; 
 
 var 
 	n: integer; 
 begin 
 	write('Enter number: '); 
 	readLn(n); 
 	writeLn(factorial(n)); 
 end.
