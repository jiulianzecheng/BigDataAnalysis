 '''Plasticine''' is a [[putty]]-like modelling material made from [[calcium]] salts, [[petroleum]] jelly and [[fatty acid]]s. It does not dry, and comes in many different colours. 
 
 Plasticine is used for children's play and for modelling more formal or permanent structures.   
 
 Because of its non-drying property, it is a good material for [[stop-motion animation]]. < ref name=May > {{cite book|last1=May|first1=James|title=Toy Stories|date=2009|publisher=Conway|location=London|isbn=9781844861071|page=[https://archive.org/details/jamesmaystoystor0000mayj/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/jamesmaystoystor0000mayj/page/16}} < /ref >  It has been used for several [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning films by [[Aardman Animations]] ([[Nick Park]]). The brand-name clay is sometimes mentioned in British music, such as the  " plasticine porters "  in [[The Beatles]]'  " [[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]] " ,  the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] songs  " Little James "  and  " [[Shakermaker]] " , the [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]] song  " Plasticine " , and the [[Thom Yorke]] song  " Plasticine Figures " . 
 
 == Industrial history == 
 Plasticine was invented in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]] in 1897 by an art teacher, William Harbutt. In 1983 production was moved to [[Thailand]]. Several attempts have been made to change the formula to evade the [[patent]] and its licences. There are a number of similar products, but none has proved more successful. There is, however, a good market for [[epoxy]] products which set hard after being applied as a liquid or putty. Plasticine does not set hard. 
 
 Plasticine is about 65%  [[gypsum]], 10% [[petroleum jelly]], 5% [[Lime (material)|lime]], 10% [[lanolin]] and 10% [[stearic acid]]. It cannot be hardened by [[kiln|firing]], [[melting|melts]] when exposed to heat, and is [[flammable]] at higher temperatures. < ref name=May/ >
