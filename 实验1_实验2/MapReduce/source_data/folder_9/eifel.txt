 The '''Eifel''' is a [[mountain range]] mostly in [[Germany]]. The northern part is in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The southern part is in the state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. 
 
 The very eastern part of [[Belgium]] (the [[High Fens]] and most of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]) and the northern part of [[Luxembourg]] (the [[Oesling]]) are considered to be both parts of the [[Ardennes (forest)|Ardennes]] and parts of the Eifel. 
 
 The western border of the Eifel is at the Belgian and Luxembourgian Ardennes. The eastern border is at the [[Westerwald]] across the [[Rhine River]]. The southern border is at the [[Hunsrück]] across the [[Moselle River]]. The northern border is at the lower regions of the [[Rhineland]]. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The Eifel has hills up to about {{convert|700|m|abbr=off}}. They are made of [[slate]] and other stones. The highest hill is the [[Hohe Acht]] with an altitude of {{convert|747|m|abbr=off}}. 
 
 Few people live in the mountain range. It has many trees, [[reservoir]]s and rivers. 
 
 The biggest settlement is the city of [[Aachen]] at the northern edge. 
 
 Because of its [[elevation]], temperatures are low.
