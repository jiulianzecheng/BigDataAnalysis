 '''Batgirl''' is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. The character is one of [[Batman]]'s side-kicks and a member of the [[Batman family|Batman Family]] similar to [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. There have been several women to take the position over the years. The original Batgirl during the Silver Age was '''[[Bette Kane]]'''. This was later removed from continuity, and the character was reintroduced under the alias [[Flamebird]]. The most well-recognized Batgirl is '''[[Barbara Gordon]]''', daughter of [[Jim Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]], and the original in modern continuity. She was Batgirl for many years until the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] shot her through the spine during the events of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' and paralyzed her. Barbara still fought crime from her wheel-chair as [[Oracle]], an international super-hacker and invaluable computers expert for heroes everywhere.  
 
 '''[[Cassandra Cain]]''', daughter of the assassin [[David Cain]], became the next Batgirl while seeking redemption for her father's crimes. She was eventually manipulated into going rogue by [[Deathstroke]] and gave up the cowl after she had recovered from her mental breakdown. The teleporter '''[[Misfit]]''' briefly called herself Batgirl when she started her vigilante career on the streets, although she changed her name after she was taken in by the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. '''[[Stephanie Brown]]''', originally known as Spoiler and a former Robin, became Batgirl after the apparent death of Batman. Gordon has since returned to the position in the DCnU following a recovery.
