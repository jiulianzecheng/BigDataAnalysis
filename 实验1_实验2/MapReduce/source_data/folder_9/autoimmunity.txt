 '''Autoimmunity''' is a [[Disease|medical condition]] where a person’s [[immune system]] attacks that person’s own body.  A healthy immune system recognizes [[Virus|viruses]], [[bacteria]], and other [[Pathogen|pathogens]], then fights them off.  When a person has autoimmunity, their immune system attacks the person’s own body.  It recognizes the body’s healthy cells and tissues as antigens, and reacts by attacking them.  Sometimes this reaction causes severe [[inflammation]], which can be [[Pain|painful]] and even dangerous.  Sometimes the reaction is not dangerous and causes very few [[Symptom|symptoms]]. < ref name= " law " > {{cite book|editor=Lawrence E., Ed. |year=1999|title=Henderson's Dictionary of Biological Terms|publisher= Longman|place=London|isbn=0-582-22708-9}} < /ref >  [[Disease|Diseases]] caused by autoimmunity are called [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune diseases]]. 
 
 A person can suddenly develop autoimmunity.  Scientists can also cause autoimmunity by injecting people with autoantigens (the healthy cells that the immune system attacks). < ref name= " Hadžiselimović-Pojskić " > {{cite book |author=Hadžiselimović R., Pojskić N. |year=2005|title= Uvod u humanu imunogenetiku / Introduction to Human Immunogenetics.|publisher= INGEB|place= Sarajevo|isbn=9958-9344-3-4}} < /ref >
