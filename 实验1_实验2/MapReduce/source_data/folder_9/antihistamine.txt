 '''Antihistamines''' are [[pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] which treat [[allergic rhinitis]] and other [[allergies]]. < ref name= " Consumer Reports 2013 " > {{Citation |author=Consumer Reports |author-link=Consumer Reports |year=2013 |title=Using Antihistamines to treat allergies, hay fever,  &  hives - comparing effectiveness, safety, and price |publisher=Consumer Reports |location=[[Yonkers, New York]] |url=http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BBD-Antihistamines-Full.pdf |access-date=29 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517030305/http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BBD-Antihistamines-Full.pdf |archive-date=17 May 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} < /ref >    
 
 Usually people take antihistamines as an [[over-the-counter drug]] , with few side effects. It is for relief from [[nasal congestion]], [[sneeze|sneezing]], or [[hives]]. These [[symptom]]s may be  caused by [[pollen]], dust [[mites]], or [[allergy]] to animals. < ref name= " Consumer Reports 2013 "  / >   
 
 Antihistamines are usually for short-term treatment. < ref name= " Consumer Reports 2013 "  / >  Chronic allergies increase the risk of health problems which antihistamines might not treat, including [[asthma]], [[sinusitis]], and [[respiratory tract]] infections near the lungs. < ref name= " Consumer Reports 2013 "  / >  Consultation of a medical professional is recommended for those who intend to take antihistamines for longer-term use. < ref name= " Consumer Reports 2013 " / > 
 
 Although people use the word “antihistamine” to describe drugs for treating allergies, doctors and scientists use the term to describe a class of drug that opposes the activity of [[histamine]] receptors in the body. In this sense of the word, antihistamines are subclassified according to which histamine receptor they act upon.
