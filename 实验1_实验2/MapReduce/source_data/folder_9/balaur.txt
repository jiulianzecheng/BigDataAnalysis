 '''''Balaur''''' is a [[genus]] of [[dromaeosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in southern [[Europe]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 million years ago.  
 
 The specimen is unique: unlike most other dromaeosaurs, it had ''two'' sickle claws on each foot, not just one. < ref name=PNAS/ >  It had a reduced and presumably nonfunctional third finger, consisting of only one rudimentary phalanx. < ref name=PNAS / > < ref name=BBC > {{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11137905 |title=BBC News – Beefy dino sported fearsome claws |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2010-08-31|access-date=2010-09-01}} < /ref > 
 
 The specimen was discovered in 2010. ''Balaur'' lived on a large prehistoric island called [[Hateg Island]]. Seventy million years ago, sea levels were much higher than they are today. Europe was an [[archipelago]] of islands. < ref name=Magy > {{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000781107|author=Stein K. |display-authors = etal |year=2010|title=Small body size and extreme cortical bone remodeling indicate phyletic dwarfism in ''Magyarosaurus dacus'' (Sauropoda: Titanosauria)|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=107|issue=20|pages=9258–9263|pmid=20435913|pmc=2889090|doi-access=free }} < /ref >   
 
 Possibly because it was relatively isolated from other dinosaurs, ''Balaur'' developed unique features. It was a small {{convert|1.8|-|2.1|m|ft}}. < ref name=PNAS > {{cite journal |last=Csiki Z.

 There is one known [[species]], ''Balaur bondoc''. ''Balaur'' was a velociraptorine. Studies have shown that it is most closely related to the famous [[Asia]]n dromaeosaurid ''[[Velociraptor]]''.
