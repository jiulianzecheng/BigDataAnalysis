 The '''megaron''' ({{lang-grc|μέγαρον}}, {{IPA-grc|mégaron|}}, plural ''megara'') is the rectangular [[great hall]] in [[Mycenaean culture|Mycenaean]] and [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] palace [[architecture]]. < ref name=Biers/ >  The hall was: 1) surrounded by four [[columns]], 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open [[hearth]] venting through an [[oculus]], or opening, in the roof. < ref > {{harvnb|Pullen|2008|p=37}}. < /ref >   
 
 The megaron also had the throne-room of the ''wanax'', or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. < ref > {{harvnb|Kleiner|2016|loc= " Chapter 4 The Prehistoric Aegean " , p. 94}}; {{harvnb|Neer|2012}}. < /ref >  Similar architecture is found in the [[Near East]] but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region. < ref name= " Encyclopædia Britannica " > {{cite web|title=Megaron|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373030/megaron|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|access-date=3 April 2013}} < /ref >  Megara are sometimes called  " long-rooms "  because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. < ref name=Müller > {{harvnb|Müller|1944|pp=342−348}}. < /ref >  There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, [[Shrine|shrines]], corridors, [[Arsenal|armories]], and rooms storing [[wine]], [[oil]] and [[wheat]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Pentreath|2006|loc= " Pre-Classical Beginnings " }}. < /ref > 
 
 The megaron was used for [[sacrifices]], < ref name=Wright > {{harvnb|Wright|2004|pp=161–162}}. < /ref >  royal events, and court meetings. < ref name= " Encyclopædia Britannica " / > 
 
 ==Structure== 
 Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. < ref name=Hitchcock > {{harvnb|Hitchcock|2010|pp=200–209}}. < /ref >  The Mycenaean megaron originated from the ''megaroid'', or large hall-centered rectangular building, of [[Greece]] dating back to the [[Neolithic|Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age|Early Bronze Age]]. < ref name=Biers > {{harvnb|Biers|1996|p=69}}. < /ref > < ref name=Hitchcock/ >  Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. < ref name=Cartwright > {{harvnb|Cartwright|2019}}. < /ref >  The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a ''pronaos'', a central ''naos'' (or ''cella''), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). < ref name=Müller/ >  The roof was supported by wooden beams. < ref > {{harvnb|Werner|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Rider|1916|pp=179–180}}. < /ref >  The floor was made of patterned [[concrete]] and covered in [[carpet]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Diehl|1893|p=53}}. < /ref >  The walls were built with [[brick]]s of [[mud]], < ref > {{harvnb|Werner|1993|p=23}}. < /ref >  and were decorated with frescoes. < ref name=Cartwright/ >  There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. < ref > {{harvnb|Rider|1916|p=180}}. < /ref >  Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. < ref > {{harvnb|Rider|1916|p=183}}; Homer. ''Odyssey'', XIX.316. < /ref >  The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks. < ref > {{harvnb|Rider|1916|p=140}}. < /ref > 
 
 ==Examples== 
 A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of [[Tiryns]] where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central [[hearth]] bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. < ref name=Müller/ >  The [[Crete|Cretan]] elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. < ref name=Müller/ >  Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. < ref name=Wright/ >  Artistic images of [[bull]]s, a common animal [[motif]] in Mycenaean vase painting, < ref > {{harvnb|Wright|2004|p=160 (Footnote #116)}}. < /ref >  appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. < ref name=Wright/ >  Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Mycenae]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Werner|1993}}. < /ref >  Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this. < ref > {{harvnb|Rider|1916|p=127}}. < /ref >
