 '''Sea devils''' are deep-sea [[anglerfish]] of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Ceratiidae'''. < ref name= " bio " > [http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/FamilySummary.php?Family=Ceratiidae Froese, Rainer and Daniel Pauly (eds) 2006.  " Ceratiidae "  in FishBase] < /ref > < ref > The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''keras'',  " horn " , referring to the [[bioluminescent]] lure that projects from the fishes' forehead. < /ref >  They are among the most widespread of the anglerfish, found in all oceans from the tropics to the [[Antarctic]]. < ref name= " bio " / > < ref > {{cite web|title=Anglerfish|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com.au/animals/fish/anglerfish/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 February 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 The females are large: females of the largest species, [[Krøyer's deep sea angler fish]], ''Ceratias holboelli'', reach {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} in length. Males, on the other hand, are [[wikt:dwarf|dwarfed]], only {{convert|14|cm|in}} maximum. When these fish were first studied, the males were mistaken for [[parasite]]s. Females usually have more than one male attached to them, which is a good example of [[polyandry]]. 
 
 At birth, tiny male ceratiids already have extremely well-developed [[Olfactory system|olfactory organs]] that detect scents in the water. < ref name= " gould " > {{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Hens' teeth and horses' toes  |year=1983 |origyear=1983 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn= 0393017168 |page=30  |chapter=1  |quote=ceratioid males develop gigantic nostrils...relative to body size, some ceratioids have larger nasal organs than any other vertebrate}} < /ref >  The male lives solely to find and mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female angler fish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, the growth of the [[gut]] may stop in some species, preventing them from feeding at all. < ref name= " gould " / >  This means the male must find a female quickly to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male detect the [[pheromone]]s from female anglerfish. 
 
 When the male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [[enzyme]]. The enzyme digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. < ref name= " gould " / >  The male then slowly wastes away, first losing his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, and ends as nothing more than a pair of [[gonad]]s. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/anglerfish/|title=Anglerfish, Lophius piscatorius|date=10 September 2010}} < /ref >  The gonads release [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] in response to [[hormones]] in the female's bloodstream. This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] makes sure that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate right there. < ref name= " doran " > {{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

 Ceratiids are the only animals known to become [[Chimaera (genetics)|chimaeras]] < ref > A chimaera is an animal formed out of two fertilised eggs. A [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] has genetically different cells derived from '''one''' fertilised egg or [[zygote]]. < /ref >  as a normal part of their [[life-cycle]].
