 }} 
 '''Iraq''' is a country in southwestern [[Asia]]. Iraq borders with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]] to the south, [[Turkey]] to the north, [[Syria]] to the north-west, [[Jordan]] to the west, and [[Iran]] to the east. The capital of Iraq is [[Baghdad]]. 
 
 Iraq has been known by the [[Greek language|Greek]] name [[Mesopotamia]] which means ''(Land between the rivers)'' and has been home to continuous [[wikt:successive|successive]] civilizations since the 6th millennium [[BC]]. The region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers is often referred to as the cradle of civilization and the birthplace of writing. Iraq was part of several empires, some were [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], and [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]]. During the Mesopotamian Campaign of [[World War I]], British Empire troops conquered the [[Ottoman Empire]] provinces of [[Basra]] and [[Baghdad]] and later added the province of [[Mosul]] to make Iraq. 
 
 Most Iraqis are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]]. 
 
 == Politics == 
 From 1968 to 2003, Iraq was run by the [[Ba'ath Party]]. [[Saddam Hussein]] was the [[President]] from 1979 until the disbandment of the [[Ba'ath Party]]. 
 
 After the 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Pakistan, and others fought to free Kuwait. Later, some agents believed to be sent by Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George H. W. Bush with a truck bomb in Kuwait. 
 
 The Kurdistan Region gained autonomy in the 1990s. Kurdistan region has its own parliament. 
 
 The March [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] was led by [[United States|American]], [[British]], Australian, Danish and Polish forces. They forced the Ba'ath Party to surrender. The publicly stated reason for the invasion was that Saddam Hussein refused to let United Nations inspectors look for suspected nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. In the past, Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to kill the Kurds. Iraq had done research in making biological and nuclear weapons. 
 
 The country was initially split into 3 zones, the American zone, the British zone, and the Polish zone similar to the way Germany was divided in 1945. Forces from Denmark controlled areas in the British zone. A new temporary government was formed on June 28, 2004. The coalition forces were in the country. 
 
 There were many U.S., British and multi-national troops in the country until December 15, 2011 when the [[Iraq War]] had ended. Tensions between religious groups ([[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s, as well as [[Christian]]s) lead to a great deal of [[instability]] in the country. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Iraqi Governorates (numbered).png|left|thumb|The [[provinces of Iraq]]]] 
 The country area lies between two rivers; for this reason the area was called [[Mesopotamia]] in ancient ages. The rivers [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] bound what is called the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Iraq also has a small coastline along the Persian Gulf, and this coastline was considered the heart of the [[petroleum]] trade in Iraq before the [[First Gulf War]]. The weather is extremely hot and dry because Iraq is far from seas and [[ocean]]s and even the close ones are blocked by mountains so that the rainy wind can not reach the inlands. This region has fertile land because of the two rivers. 
 
 Iraq is divided into 18 provinces (''muhafazah'').

 == Economy == 
 Iraq has a large amount of [[petroleum|oil]]. Iraq is the world's number four in petroleum production and the world's number two in petroleum reserves. In the past, Iraq sold much of this oil to other countries. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August [[1990]], the [[United Nations]] stopped Iraq from selling the oil. The United Nations later allowed Iraq to sell some oil to buy food, clothes, and medicine so the people would not suffer as much. This was called the  " [[Oil-for-Food]] "  program.
