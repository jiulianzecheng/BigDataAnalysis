A '''misandrist''' is a person who hates men or boys. They may hate men because they believe there is something wrong with them, such as being stupid, dirty or evil. < ref name= " psychologytoday.com " > {{cite journal|last1=Synnott|first1=Anthony|title=Why Some People Have Issues With Men: Misandry is not in everyone's dictionary but it's out there|journal=Psychology Today|date=2010-10-06|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rethinking-men/201010/why-some-people-have-issues-men-misandry|access-date=24 October 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 Misandry is different from [[sexism]], which is not based on hate. Radical feminists are sometimes viewed as misandric. Misandry includes violence or discrimination against men. Some misandrists are prejudiced against men. For example they may think that all men or boys are potential rapists. < ref > {{Cite journal|url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/heresies6.pdf|title = Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea|last = Dworkin|first = Andrea|date = Summer 1978|journal = HERESIES: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|access-date = 2015-05-12|publisher = Heresies Collective, Inc.|issue = #6|series = No. 2|location = New York City, NY, USA|volume =  2|page =46|issn = 0146-3411|author-link = Andrea Dworkin}} < /ref >
