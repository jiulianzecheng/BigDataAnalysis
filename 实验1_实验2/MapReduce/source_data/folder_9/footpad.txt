 Footpads always operated on foot, and robbed people after scaring them. Usually operating in the dark, they used this to their advantage by frightening the victim and getting away unseen; some of these crimes were brutally violent, although most commited them out of need and preferred more passive methods.  
 
 They opted for this method due to the high price of horses and the incognito factor of the dark. These activities usually took place in gangs.
