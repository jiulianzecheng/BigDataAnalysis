 In [[Egyptian mythology]], '''Osiris''' is the [[god]] of [[life]], [[death]], the [[flood]]ing of the [[Nile River|Nile]], and the afterlife. He was the brother and husband of [[Isis]]. They had a son named [[Horus]]. Osiris was [[murder]]ed by his brother [[Set (deity)|Set]] because Osiris was the [[pharaoh]], which [[Seth|Set]] wanted to be. Osiris was killed when Set tricked him into getting into a [[box]], then poured [[lead]] onto the box to close it so Osiris could not get out of it. However, Isis brought Osiris back to life for one [[night]]. After Horus was old enough, he defeated [[Set (deity)|Set]] and became the [[pharaoh]]. Osiris' mother was the [[goddess]] [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], father [[Geb]], sister [[Nephthys]], and sister as well as wife [[Isis]]. < ref name=Wilkinson > {{cite book |author=Wilkinson, Richard H. |title=The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt |url=https://archive.org/details/completegodsgodd00wilk |publisher=Thames  &  Hudson |location=London |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/completegodsgodd00wilk/page/n105 105] |isbn=0-500-05120-8 |oclc= |doi=}} < /ref > 
 
 == Osiris and Dionysus ==

 By the Hellenic era, Greek awareness of Osiris had grown, and attempts had been made to merge Greek [[philosophy]], such as [[Platonism]], and the [[cult]] of Osiris (especially the myth of his resurrection), resulting in a new [[mystery religion]]. Gradually, this became more popular, and was exported to other parts of the Greek sphere of influence. However, these mystery religions valued the change in [[wisdom]], personality, and knowledge of truth, rather than the exact details of the accepted myths on which their teachings were overlayed. Thus in each region that it was exported to, the myth was changed to be about a similar local god, resulting in a series of gods, who had originally been quite distinct, but who were now synonymous with Osiris. These gods became known as Osiris-Dionysus. 
 
 == Why Egypt loved Osiris == 
 Egyptian civilization loved Osiris because he was a wise and gentle king. He taught them law and order and led them away from savage practices like cannibalism and human sacrifice. Osiris also taught them the art of agriculture and the appropriate rites for worshipping the gods. When he was done civilizing the people in Egypt, he left the country to his wife Isis and made peace in many other places. When he finished his job he then returned to Egypt. 
 
 == Purpose == 
 Osiris was the god of the Underworld. He was also one of the Nine Gods. One of his duties as Lord of the Dead was to do the very last judgment of the Dead, and after that to protect people from the dangers of the Underworld. The transition between life and death must have been a great experience, but still perilous .
