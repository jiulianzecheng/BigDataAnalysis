 A '''wheel''' is a [[disc]] or [[circle]]-shaped mechanical device. Its main purpose is to allow things to ''roll''; in other words, the wheel spins, and object on the wheels moves more easily along the ground.  It is a [[simple machine]]. < ref > Prater, Edward L. 1994.

 Most land [[vehicle]]s roll on wheels. Wheels are often used in pairs, connected by a rod of wood or metal known as an [[axle]]. The wheel and axle turn together. The part of the wheel that attaches to the axle is called the hub.  
 
 The wheel with an axle is the basis of many machines, not just vehicles.  The [[potter's wheel]], the [[lathe]] and the [[windlass]] are examples. < ref name=Bowser > Bowser, Edward Albert, 1890, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdM3AAAAMAAJ & dq=wheel+and+axle & pg=PR9  An elementary treatise on analytic mechanics: with numerous examples.]   (Originally from the University of Michigan) D.

 == History == 
 [[File:Bronocice drawn.png|thumb|Drawing of a drinking-cup, dated to 3500-3350 BC.  The object shown on the left has been interpreted as some kind of wagon, below or near a bridge.  This would make it the oldest known depiction of a wheel.  The cup is known as [[Bronocice bowl]] today.|alt=]] 
 Most experts believe that  the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns invented the wheel about 4000 BC. < ref > True potter's wheels, which are freely-spinning and have a wheel-and-axle mechanism, were developed in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]) by 4200â€“4000 & nbsp;BC. {{cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|author=D.T. Potts|year=2012|page=285}} < /ref > < ref name=Moorey1994 > The oldest surviving example, which was found in [[Ur]] (modern day [[Iraq]]), dates to about 3100 & nbsp;BC. < /ref > 
 
 People in [[Asia]] also discovered it on their own around 3500 BC.  The [[Inca]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] had wheels on children's toys around 1500 BC, but they did not use wheels for work.  [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara]] desert, Europe, and [[Australia]] did not have the wheel until people there met people from Europe.  Early wheels were solid [[disk]]s; the [[spoke]]d wheel was invented around 2000 BC. The earliest documentation of a vehicle with wheels is a painting dated between 3350{{ndash}}3500 [[BC]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Today, wheels are used in [[Automobile|cars]], [[cart|carts]], [[Fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]], [[wheelchair|wheelchairs]], [[bicycle|bicycles]], [[train|trains]], and [[skateboard|skateboards]], in addition to many more devices.
