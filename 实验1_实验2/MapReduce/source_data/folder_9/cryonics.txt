 [[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Cryonics]] 
 '''Cryonics''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''kryos'', which means 'cold') is the process of [[:en:wikt:vitrifying|vitrifying]] a human (or animal) about {{convert|-196|C|F K|0|abbr=off}} after a [[Medical doctor|doctor]] says they are dead. People do that in hope that, in the future when medicine becomes better, they can have life again, solve their health problems and have [[Immortality|eternal life]]. 
 
 Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have [[Brain death|no brain activity]]. The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like [[glass]] than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their [[blood]] is replaced with [[chemical]]s called ''cryoprotectants'', which act like anti-freeze (stops to freeze).
