 '''Maxillopoda''' is a diverse [[class (biology)|class]] of [[crustacean]]s which includes the [[barnacle]]s, [[copepod]]s and a number of related animals. 
 
 It does not appear to be a [[monophyletic]] group, and no single character unites all the members. < ref name= " M & D " > {{cite book |url=http://atiniui.nhm.org/pdfs/3839/3839.pdf |title=An updated classification of the Recent Crustacea |author=Joel W.

 == Description == 
 With the exception of some barnacles, maxillopodans are mostly small, < ref name= " UCMP " > {{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/arthropoda/crustacea/maxillopoda.html |title=Introduction to Maxillopoda |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=December 31, 2009}} < /ref >  including the smallest known arthropod, ''Stygotantulus stocki''. < ref name= " M & D " / >  They often have short bodies, with the [[abdomen]] reduced in size, and generally lacking any [[appendage]]s & nbsp; < ref name= " UCMP " / >  This may have arisen through [[paedomorphosis]]. < ref name= " UCMP " / > 
 
 Apart from barnacles, which use their legs for [[filter feeding]], most maxillopodans feed with their [[maxilla]]e. Their bodyplan has 5 head segments, 6 [[Thorax|thoracic]] segments and 4 abdominal segments, followed by a [[telson]] (tailpiece). < ref > {{cite web |author=Phil Myers |year=2001 |title= " Maxillopoda "   |work=Animal Diversity Web |accessdate=December 31, 2009 |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Maxillopoda.html}} < /ref > 
 
 == Fossil record == 
 The [[fossil]] record of the group extends back into the [[Cambrian]], with fossils of [[barnacle]]s and [[Pentastomida|tongue worms]] known from that period. < ref > {{cite book |author=B.A. Foster  &  J.S.

 == Classification == 
 Six subclasses are generally recognised, although many works have included the [[ostracod]]s among the Maxillopoda. < ref name= " M & D " / >  Of the six groups, only [[Mystacocarida]] are entirely free-living; all the members of the [[Tantulocarida]], [[Pentastomida]] and [[Branchiura]] are [[parasite|parasitic]], and many of the [[Copepod]]a and [[Thecostraca]] are parasites.
