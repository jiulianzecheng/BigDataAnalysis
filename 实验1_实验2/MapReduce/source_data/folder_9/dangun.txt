In [[Korea|Korean]] [[mythology]], '''Dangun''' was the grandson of the gods, and the founder of [[Gojoseon]], who set up the capital at [[Asadal]]. Legends say that around 4,340 years ago, ''Joseon'' was the name of the country that became [[Korea]]. So Dangun is believed to be an ancestor of the Korean nation. There was also a kingdom called ''Joseon'' later in Korean history, so Dangun's kingdom is called ''Go'' (meaning  " Ancient " ) Joseon. 
 
 Once upon a time, [[Hwanung]], the god [[Hwanin]]`s son, wanted to go down to the human world. Hwanin noticed that and let Hwanung go down to the human world with three amulets. Hwanung went to the [[Sindansu]] in [[Mount Taebaek]], with his 3,000 followers. He managed the human world`s agriculture, morals, and 363 other fields of societal work. All these things went well. 
 
 One day, two animals visited Hwanung, begging him to change them to human beings. One was a tiger, and the other was a bear. Hwanung gave them an armful of divine wormwood and twenty cloves of divine garlic, and said:  " Eat those for 100 days without being exposed to the sunshine. Then you will become human beings. " 
 
 The two animals went to the cave and followed Hwanung`s orders. But during this process, the tiger could not endure this trial, and rushed out from the cave. On the other hand, the bear endured the trial and became a woman. But nobody was willing to marry her. So the bear woman prayed to conceive a baby at Sindansu. Then Hwanung transformed himself into human being for a while and married her. The bear woman gave birth to a baby. That baby was Dangun. 
 
 Dangun managed Gojoseon for 1,500 years, and after that long period, [[Giza]] succeeded to the throne. Dangun retired from the world and became a mountain god.
