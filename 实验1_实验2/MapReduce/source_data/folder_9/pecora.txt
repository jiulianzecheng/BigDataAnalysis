 '''Pecora''' is a group of mammals which ''chew the cud'': in other words they re-eat the same material a second time. This kind of eating is done by all [[ruminant]]s. The main reason is that they eat [[grass]], which is quite hard to digest. It has little food value, but it grows so widely that it is always available to animals which can digest it. 
 
 Most pecorans, except ''[[Hydrotopes]]'' and ''[[Musk deer|Moschus]]'' have [[Horn|horns]] or [[antlers]].  " Pecora "  comes from [[Latin]] meaning  " [[Horn|horned]] [[Livestock|lifestock]] " . Some pecorans have horns, but the family [[Deer|Cervidae]] has [[antlers]].
