 " '''Taps''' "  is a song. It is used as the final [[bugle]] call of the day ( " lights out " ) and at solemn ceremonies such as military [[funeral]]s. It was written in 1862 by General Daniel Butterfield, commander of a Union brigade camped in [[Virginia]].  " Extinguish Lights "  was the original title. The words of the song (Day is done; Gone the sun) were written at later date. When or why  " Taps "  replaced the original title is unknown. The meaning of  " Taps "  is also unknown, but may refer to the sound of a muffled drum beat.
