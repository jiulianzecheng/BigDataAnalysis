 The original '''Labyrinth''' was an elaborate structure designed and built by the legendary [[Daedalus]] for [[King Minos]] of [[Crete]] at [[Knossos]].  
 
 Its function was to hold the [[Minotaur]], which was eventually killed by the hero [[Theseus]]. Daedalus had so cleverly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it. 
 
 [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] Natural History mentions four ancient labyrinths: the Cretan labyrinth, an Egyptian labyrinth, a Lemnian labyrinth, and an Italian labyrinth.
