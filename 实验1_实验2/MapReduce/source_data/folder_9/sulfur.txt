 '''Sulfur''' (or '''sulphur''') is a [[chemical element]]. The symbol for sulfur is '''S''', and its [[atomic number]] is 16. 
 
 ==Properties== 
 Sulfur is a [[yellow]] solid that is a [[nonmetal]]. It is fragile (easily broken) and [[crystalline]]. It burns easily, releasing [[toxic]] fumes of [[sulfur dioxide]]. It has a very faint odor. If it is melted and cooled very quickly, it makes a rubbery form of sulfur that is called  " plastic sulfur " . It gradually turns back into the yellow brittle form. It does not [[Solvation|dissolve]] in water. The smell normally known as  " sulfur "  comes from [[hydrogen sulfide]] and similar chemicals. These [[sulfide]]s are produced when things decay without air. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 Sulfur compounds are [[chemical compound]]s containing sulfur [[ion]]s. Sulfur comes in several forms: [[oxidation state]]s of -2 ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), +4 ([[sulfur dioxide]], [[sulfite]]s) and +6 ([[sulfuric acid]], [[sulfate]]s) are most common, although there are other oxidation states. 
 
 ====Sulfur oxides==== 
 {{see also|Sulfur oxide}} 
 *[[Sulfur dioxide]], colorless toxic heavy gas, used to preserve dried foods 
 *[[Sulfur trioxide]], various forms, sometimes liquid, irritating and toxic 
 *[[Oleum]], sulfur trioxide dissolved in sulfuric acid

 ====Sulfur acids==== 
 Mixture of sulfur oxides and water 
 *[[Sulfurous acid]], unstable, weak 
 *[[Sulfuric acid]], stable, strong acid, most used chemical after water 
 *[[Hydrogen sulfate]], an [[ion]] produced when sulfuric acid only [[deprotonation|loses one acidic proton]] 
 *[[Hydrogen sulfide]], weak smelly gas, becomes acidic when dissolved in water

 *[[Iron(II) sulfate]], used for [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]]  
 *[[Iron(III) sulfate]], rare 
 *[[Lead(II) sulfate]], white solid in lead acid batteries 
 *[[Manganese(II) sulfate]], used to add manganese to soil 
 *[[Nickel(II) sulfate]], used to make nickel compounds

 ==Occurrence and preparation== 
 [[File:Sulfur powder.jpg|right|thumb|Sulfur powder made by reacting sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from coal]] 
 Sulfur can be found in the earth near [[volcano]]es. Many minerals contain sulfur [[ion]]s. Coal contains sulfur ions which are released when it burns. Hydrogen sulfide and [[sulfur dioxide]] are some sulfur compounds that are released when coal burns. They are reacted to make sulfur. Sulfur in the ground in melted, then forced up through pipes by compressed (squeezed) air. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Sulfur is commonly used in gunpowder, medicine, and matches. Matches release sulfur dioxide when they burn, giving them their smell. Sulfur is an essential component to living cells. Many [[protein]]s contain sulfur. It is also used as a [[pesticide]] on [[Organic farming|organic]] farms. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 Powder sulfur is said to be left after an occurrence of a supernatural being. 
 
 ==Toxicity and safety== 
 Sulfur is not toxic, but the [[chemical compound]]s formed when sulfur [[burn]]s can be very toxic. [[Sulfuric acid]], for example, can make paper turn black! 
 
 ==History== 
 The ancient name for sulfur is ''brimstone''. Sulfur was used in [[fumigation]] (making fumes) and medicine in ancient Greece. In 1777, Antoine Lavosier convinced the scientific community that sulfur was an element.
