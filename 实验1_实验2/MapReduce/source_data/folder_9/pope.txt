 Popes are elected by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] of the Catholic Church. Once they are elected they hold the position until they die or resign. Usually they do not resign, though; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] is the only Pope to resign in the last 500 years.  A newly elected Pope chooses a [[regnal name]].  Everyone is told this new name when the [[Habemus Papam]] is read out. The current pope (Francis) was called [[Jorge Bergoglio]] before he became a pope. 
 
 The name ''Pope'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''pappas'', meaning  " father " . < ref name= " catholic " / >  Catholics believe that when making statements ''ex cathedra'', that is official statements teaching about faith and morals, the Pope is ''infallible'' - which means [[God]] will not allow his followers to be misled by allowing their leader to make a wrong statement. Only two of any Pope's statements have been ''ex cathedra''. < ref > Apostolic constitution ''Munificentissimus Deus'', written by Pope Pius XII, 1 November 1950 {{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19501101_munificentissimus-deus_en.html|title=Munificentissimus Deus}}; Apostolic constitution ''Ineffabilis Deus'', written by Pope Pius IX, 8 December 1854. < /ref >   
 
 Popes today travel to many countries around the world preaching. The Pope is the only person in the world who both leads the church and [[government]]. Like other bishops he wears a big hat called a [[mitre]] and holds a staff called a [[crosier]].

 == The Popes in Avignon == 
 During parts of the Middle Ages, the French kings had a lot of influence in Europe. For this reason, seven popes (and two anti-popes) lived in [[Avignon]], rather than Rome. The [[Avignon Papacy]] was from 1309 to 1377. During that time, the popes were known for their greed and [[corruption]]. < ref name= " R:RCC " > [[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957.  " Chapter I. The Roman Catholic Church. "  1300-1517. p. 3-25 < /ref >  These popes were [[ally|allies]] of France; the enemies of France were also their enemies. < ref name= " R:EWCGR " > [[Will Durant|Durant, Will]]. The Reformation. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1957.  " Chapter II. England: Wyclif, Chaucer, and the Great Revolt. "  1308-1400. p. 26-57 < /ref > 
 
 The Bishops of Rome who lived in Avignon were: 
 #[[Pope Clement V]]: 1305–1314 
 #[[Pope John XXII]]: 1316–1334 
 #[[Pope Benedict XII]]: 1334–1342 
 #[[Pope Clement VI]]: 1342–1352 
 #[[Pope Innocent VI]]: 1352–1362 
 #[[Pope Urban V]]: 1362–1370 
 #[[Pope Gregory XI]]: 1370–1378 
 
 Two antipopes were based in Avignon as well: 
 *[[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]]: 1378–1394 
 *[[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]: 1394–1423 (expelled from Avignon in 1403) 
 
 [[Antipope]]s were people that were elected by small groups who did not like the official choice.  
 [[Catherine of Siena]] convinced pope Gregory XI to move back to Rome. Unfortunately, he died shortly after moving. The cardinals then elected [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]] to be the next pope. The French cardinals did not recognise this election as legitimate. They declared the papal see as vacant; which led to the [[Western Schism]]. The schism lasted until the [[Council of Constance]] in 1417. During this time, there was a pope in Rome, an Antipope in Avignon, and for some time, a second antipope. Each of the three was recognised as legitimate pope by different European powers. This led to a big split in the church as a whole. The council elected [[Pope Martin V]] as a new pope, recognised by all parties.
