'''The arts''' are a large part of [[culture]], and the word means much more than  " ''[[art]]'' " . '''The arts''' include [[visual arts]], [[literature|literary arts]] (i.e. [[books]] and other [[writing]]s) and [[performing arts]] (i.e. [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]]).  
 
 Sometimes, in [[University|universities]], it is shorthand for a wider group of subjects which are properly called the [[humanities]]. These include [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[literature]], [[languages]], and [[history]] as well.   
 
 " The arts "  are usually contrasted with  " The [[sciences]] " . 
 
 === Visual arts === 
 Visual arts consist of any art that can be seen. This form of art doesn't change once it has been made. 
 
 === Architecture === 
 {{Main|Architecture}} 
 Architecture is the art and science behind [[building]] and [[sculpture]] [[design]]. Architecture as an art involves making something look [[Beauty|beautiful]] and [[appealing]] to others. 
 
 === Conceptual art ===
