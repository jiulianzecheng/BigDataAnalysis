 '''Hades''' ({{lang-el|ᾍδης}}, ''Háidēs'') is the king of the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] (not to be confused with the god of the dead, Thanatos) in ancient Greek religion and [[Greek mythology|myth]]. He is the eldest son of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Kronos]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and brother to [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hestia]], [[Hera]], [[Demeter]] and [[Chiron]].  
 
 As the lord of the dead, Hades was greatly feared by the Greeks, and he had few temples or shrines dedicated to him. He was married to the goddess [[Persephone]], the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Demeter]]. Hades’ symbols were the [[cornucopia]], a sceptre, the [[cypress]], [[Narcissus (genus)|narcissus]], [[Populus|poplar]] and his [[Helm of Darkness]]; the [[screech owl]] was his sacred animal. His sacred fruit was the [[pomegranate]], the fruit that Persephone ate one- third of when she was kidnapped and in the underworld. 
 
 Hades’ Roman equivalent was [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], whose name is merely a [[Latinization]] of the Greek ''Plouton''.
