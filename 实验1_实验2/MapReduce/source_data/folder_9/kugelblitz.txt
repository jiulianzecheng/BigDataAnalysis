A '''kugelblitz''' is a theoretical [[black hole]] created by enough light that [[space-time]] itself warps into a [[black hole]]. The famous equation, [[Special relativity|E=mc < sup > 2 < /sup > ]]  proves that energy can bend [[space-time]], like [[matter]]. There would be no difference from an ordinary [[black hole]]. 
 
 Kugelblitz drives have been considered as possible future [[black hole starship]] engines. 
 
 A man-made kugelblitz would be made with a [[gamma-ray laser]] 1 billion times stronger than the current hypothesized ones. Also, it would have to produce a pulse that was 100 billionth of the current duration of a modern [[Laser|laser's]] pulse. A single pulse would equate to the energy produced by the [[sun]] in 1/10 of a second. 
 
 A kugelblitz of this size would last five years, and a device similar to a [[Dyson sphere]] could be constructed around it to use the energy produced by the [[Hawking radiation]].
