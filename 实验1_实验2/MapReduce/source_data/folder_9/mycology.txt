 '''Mycology''' is the study of [[fungi]]. < ref > Ainsworth, Geoffrey Clough 1976. Introduction to the history of mycology. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-21013-3 < /ref >  This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and  [[psychoactive]] substances.  
 A biologist who studies mycology is called a '''mycologist'''.  
 
 Mycology is closely related to [[phytopathology]] (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi.  
 Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants. 
 
 Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are [[Symbiosis|symbionts]]. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global [[carbon cycle]]. < ref > Kibby, Geoffrey 2017.'' Mushrooms and toadstools of Britain  &  Europe.
