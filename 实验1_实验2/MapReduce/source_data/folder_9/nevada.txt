 '''Nevada''' is one of the [[United States]]' [[U.S. state|states]]. Its [[capital (city)|capital]] is [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. The largest city is [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Other big cities are [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] and [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]. More than two-thirds of the people live in the Las Vegas [[urban area]]. < ref > https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural.html < /ref > 
 
 Most of Nevada is in the [[Great Basin]]. It is the driest state in the United States. < ref > {{cite web |last=Osborn |first=Liz |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/driest-states.php |title=Driest states |publisher=Currentresults.com |access-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095100/http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/US/driest-states.php |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 Nevada was first inhabited by Native Americans. It was colonized by [[Spain]] and was part of [[New Spain]]. Later, it was part of New Mexico. It was taken by the United States in the [[Mexican–American War]]. 
 
 The most common ancestries in Nevada include Mexican, German, Irish, English, Italian and Asian. < ref > [https://www.info-america-usa.com/nevada/ Nevada] < /ref >  Many [[White people]] and Hispanics live in the state. 
 
 ==History== 
 Nevada was originally [[wikt:founder|founded]] in 1821 as part of the First [[Mexico|Mexican]] Empire. The Mexican Empire turned into the Mexican [[Republic]] in 1823, along with Nevada. Before the arrival of Europeans, Nevada was inhabited by [[Native American]] tribes including the Shoshone, the Paiute, the Washoe, and the Mohave.  
 ===The Mexican-American Conflict=== 
 Fighting between the United States and Mexico started. They fought over what was to become the [[Southwestern United States]] and who could own this land. This was called the [[Mexican-American War]]. The war ended in an American [[wikt:victory|victory]] in 1848. Nevada later became an American territory in 1861. It was called the  " Nevada Territory " . This was not all of Nevada as it is today. The eastern part of Nevada was part of  " Utah Territory "   and the southern part was part of  " [[New Mexico]] " . In 1859 in the [[Comstock Lode]], [[gold]] and [[silver]] were first discovered. This started a huge growth in [[mining]] in the state which Nevada is known for. 
 ===Gaining statehood=== 
 On October 31, 1864, now celebrated as  " [[Nevada Day]] " , Nevada was made the 36th state in the United States. It was given the distinct shape resembling a rectangle with a triangle. It was named ''Nevada'' meaning  " snowy land "  in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], because it was [[snow]]y in the North. Later, on May 5, 1866, Nevada got its current borders because the [[Paiutes|Pah-Ute]] County in [[Arizona]] was taken as part of Nevada. It is now [[Clark County, Nevada]]. It was also agreed upon that the western part of Utah would become Eastern Nevada. 
 
 ==Economy== 
 [[Tourism]] is very important to the economy of Nevada. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/usa/states/nevada-economy.html|title=Economy of Nevada State|website=EconomyWatch|access-date=2010-11-01|archive-date=2010-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104173840/http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/usa/states/nevada-economy.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Many people visit [[Las Vegas]], which has many casinos and resorts. There is not as much farming as there is in some other states, because Nevada is so dry. However, [[mining]] is big in Nevada. More [[gold]] is mined in Nevada than in any other state. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/photogold.html |title=Mineral Information Institute - Gold |access-date=2010-11-01 |archive-date=2010-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101021632/http://mii.org/Minerals/photogold.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
