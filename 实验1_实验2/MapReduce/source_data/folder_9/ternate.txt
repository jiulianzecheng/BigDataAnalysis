 '''Ternate''' is a city in the eastern [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Maluku Islands|North Maluku]]. It is made up of many islands in the [[Maluku Islands]]. It was the ''[[de facto]]'' provincial capital of North Maluku before [[Sofifi]] on the nearby coast of [[Halmahera]] became the capital in 2010. It is off the west coast of Halmahera. It is made up of eight islands: Ternate, [[Moti Island|Moti]], Hiri, Tifure, Mayau, Makka, Mano, and Gurida. In total, the city has a land area of 162.17 square kilometres and had a total [[population]] of 185,705 according to the 2010 census, and 205,001 according to the 2020 census, with a density of 1,264 people per square kilometre. It is the biggest and most densely populated city in the province, is the economic, cultural, and education center of North Maluku, and acts as a hub to neighbouring regions. It was the capital of the [[Sultanate of Ternate]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, and fought against the [[Sultanate of Tidore]] over control of the [[spice trade]] in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] before becoming a main interest to competing European powers.
