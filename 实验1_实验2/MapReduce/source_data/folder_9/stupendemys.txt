 '''''Stupendemys''''' is a [[prehistoric]] [[genus]] of freshwater [[turtle]]. Its [[fossil]]s have been found in northern [[South America]], in rocks dating from the late [[Miocene]] to the very start of the [[Pliocene]], about 6 to 5 million years ago. < ref name = bm2006 > Bocquentin, Jean  &  Melo, Janira 2006. ''Stupendemys souzai'' sp. nov. (Pleurodira, Podocnemididae) from the Miocene-Pliocene of the Solim√µes Formation, Brazil. ''Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia'' '''9'''(2): 187-192.

 ''Stupendemys'''s [[carapace]] measured over {{convert|1.80|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and was also very wide. With a total carapace length of at least 11 feet (3.3 m) it was the largest turtle that ever existed, surpassing even ''[[Archelon]]''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://cameronmccormick.blogspot.com/2010/03/stupendemys-giant-amongst-mega-turtles.html|title=The Lord Geekington: Stupendemys: Giant Amongst Mega-Turtles|first=Cameron|last=Mccormick|date=11 March 2010|publisher=}} < /ref >   
 
 Two species have been described to date. ''Stupendemys geographicus'' from [[Venezuela]], and ''Stupendemys souzai'', a bit smaller and more slender, from [[Brazil]]. < ref name = bm2006 / > 
 
 == Ecology == 
 Its weight helped ''Stupendemys'' stay under water for long periods, [[grazing]] on aquatic [[plant]]s. It was probably a very weak swimmer, unable to move its bulk against a swift current, and probably avoided smaller streams. < ref name = bm2006 / > 
 
 Altogether, the [[fauna]] of the time had many large [[herbivore]]s and few [[Land|terrestrial]] [[carnivore]]s. The [[habitat]] was mostly low-lying [[rainforest]] that was seasonally flooded, as well as [[floodplain]]s and [[swamp]]land. The rivers must have been wide and slow-moving. < ref name = bm2006 / >
