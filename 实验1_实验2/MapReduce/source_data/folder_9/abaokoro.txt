 I have an airmail envelope with a void centre datestamp PO Abaokoro / Kiribati, the envelope marked in manuscript O.K.G.S. assumed to be 'on Kiribati Government Service', addressed to the Home Affairs  &  Rural Development, Bairiki, with an unclear backstamp. I have been involved in philately for over sixty years and have not seen this before. C S H
