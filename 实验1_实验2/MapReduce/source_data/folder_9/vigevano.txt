 '''Vigevano''' ('''Avgevan''' in the local [[Dialects of Italy|variety]] of [[Western Lombard]]) is a city and ''[[comune]]'' (township) in the [[province of Pavia]], [[Lombardy]], northern [[Italy]], which has many treasures and a huge industrial business. It is in the middle of a district called [[Lomellina]], a great rice-growing centre. Vigevano received the honorary title of city with a declaration of [[Francesco II Sforza|Duke Francis II Sforza]] on February 2, 1532. Vigevano is well known for its beautiful [[Renaissance]]  " ''Piazza Ducale'' " , in the middle of the town. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Vigevano-street01.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A street in central Vigevano.]] 
 
 Vigevano dates back to the 10th century AD, when it was one of Lombard king [[Arduin of Ivrea|Arduin]]'s favourite places because of the good hunting. 
 
 Vigevano was a [[Ghibelline]] township, favoring the Emperor and was therefore invaded and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it finally gave itself up to [[Azzone Visconti]], after which it shared the fortunes of Milan. The Church of S. Pietro Martire (St. Peter Martyr) was built, with the neighbouring Dominican convent, by [[Filippo Maria Visconti]] in 1445. In the last years of Visconti's control it kept a siege by [[Francesco Sforza]]. Once he was settled in power in Lombardy, Sforza secured the erection of Vigevano as the seat of a bishop and provided its revenues. 
 
 ==Main sights== 
 ===Castello Sforzesco=== 
 Vigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a [[fortification|stronghold]] rebuilt 1492 & ndash;94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza ([[Ludovico il Moro]]), the great patron born in the town, who changed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a [[Lombards|Lombard]] fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was his guest at Vigevano, as was [[Bramante]], who is credited with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that travels between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant [[loggia]]to supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the [[mastio]], the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess [[Beatrice d'Este]].

 * [[Ludovico Sforza]] (1452–1508), known as [[Ludovico il Moro]],  " The Moor " , Duke of Milan.
