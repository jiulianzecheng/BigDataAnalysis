 '''Beatification''' (from [[Latin]] ''beatus'', blessed, [[Greek (language)|Greek]] μακάριος, ''makarios'' and Latin ''facere'', make) is a recognition given by the [[Catholic Church]] of a dead person's entrance into [[Heaven]] and power to help people who pray in his or her name. Beatification is the third of the four steps in the [[canonization]] process.  A person who is beatified is given the title  " Blessed " .
