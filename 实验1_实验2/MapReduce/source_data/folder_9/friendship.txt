 '''Friendship''' means familiarity with and liking of each other's [[mind]]. 
 
 People who are friends [[talk]] to each other and spend [[time]] [[wikt:together|together]]. They trust one another and also help each other when they are in [[wikt: trouble|trouble]] or are hurt. Friends are people that can be looked up to and trusted. Friends usually have similar interests. A friend is one who [[wikt: admires|admires]] another person. 
 
 The strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very strong, they are called [[best friend]]s. 
 
 There are expectations, demands, and complaints in friendship too. If friends do not match your expectations, it does not mean you will break the friendship. It is all about understanding, realizing, and helping whenever possible. 
 
 Friendship is both good and bad. Generally, it is only people of similar age, character, and background, mentality, etc., who can understand the problems of another person. Friends are needed for support and for sharing. 
 
 There are many different types of friendships. Most people find friends at a young age. Some do not have friends until much later in life, others will never make friends in their lifetime. Friendships can end. Friends leaving can be caused by differences in opinion or not talking to each other for a long time. 
 
 Many movies and TV shows are based on people making friends. An example of a friendship would be that of Sierra, Olivia, Emma, Langli, and Mallory in the movie Eight grade Whittier. 
 
 The word ''Friendship'' is also the official motto of [[Texas]].
