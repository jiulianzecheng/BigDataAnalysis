 The '''Penobscot''' ([[Abenaki language|Abenaki]]: ''Pαnawάhpskewi'') are Native Americans and [[First Nations|First Nation]] from the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]. Their language is part of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] family. They are part of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. The US government recognizes the ''Penobscot Nation'' as a tribe. They are in the regions of [[Maine]], [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] and [[Quebec]]. Their name means  " the people of where the white rocks extend out.

 == History == 
 The Penobscot did hunting. They moved for different seasons. < ref name= " :0 " > ''The Wabanakis of Maine and the Maritimes''. [[American Friends Service Committee]], 1989. < /ref >  They traveled in [[birch bark]] [[Canoe|canoes]]. They hunted and fished at different times of the year. They joined the fur trade. They traded furs and got goods like alcohol. Many Natives died from European diseases. They were not immune to these diseases. Penobscot encountered French in Canada and English in New England. They supported the Americans in the American Revolution. However, Americans began to push Penobscot off their lands. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  They were forced onto reservations. At the turn of the 19th century, the Penobscot gave up most of their land to [[Massachusetts]]. They could only stay on the [[Penobscot Indian Island Reservation]]. The tribe has sued the state of Maine several times. These have included issues like the right to hunt and land claims. < ref > Diana Scully.

 == Culture == 
 Penobscot made baskets. They used  [[Hierochloe odorata|sweet grass]], [[Fraxinus nigra|brown ash]], and [[birch bark]]. Baskets became more decorative with European trade. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Penobscot - New World Encyclopedia|url=https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Penobscot|access-date=2022-08-08|website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org}} < /ref >   
 
 For the Penobscot, the lands have spiritual importance. Religion was closely connected to land. The landscape was part of a larger cosmology. Thus, land was very important for the Penobscot. A key figure in legends is Klose-kur-beh ([[Glooscap|Gluskbe]]). He gives the Natives practical and spiritual knowledge. He is as old as creation. According to Penobscot cosmology, Gluskbe warned about the greed and lust of white men. Animals and plants also had spiritual elements. < ref > Kolodny, Annette (2007).
