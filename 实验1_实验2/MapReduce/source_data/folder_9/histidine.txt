 Histidine (symbol His or H) is an [[essential amino acid]]. It is used in the [[biosynthesis]] of [[Protein|proteins]]. It is a positively charged amino acid.  
 
 Originally it was thought essential only for infants. It has now been shown to be essential for adults also. < ref > Kopple J.D.  &  Swendseid M.E. 1975. Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man. ''Journal of Clinical Investigation''. '''55''' (5): 881–91. doi:10.1172/JCI108016. PMC 301830. PMID 1123426 < /ref >  It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC. 
 
 Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. < ref > Vickery, Hubert Bradford; Leavenworth, Charles S. (1928-08-01).  " On the Separation of Histidine and Arginine "  (PDF). Journal of Biological Chemistry. 78 (3): 627–635. doi:10.1016/S0021-9258(18)83967-9. ISSN 0021-9258 < /ref >  It is also a precursor to [[histamine]], a vital inflammatory agent in [[Immune system|immune]] responses.
