 '''Hindkowans''' is a general term used to identify speakers of the [[Hindko|Hindko dialect of Punjabi]] in [[Pakistan]]. In fact this is not an ethnic grouping or category properly speaking, and comprises diverse elements in the [[Punjab]], and small amount in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and in [[Mianwali District]] and Dera Ghazi Khan areas of [[Punjab (Pakistan)]].  < ref > {{cite web|url=http://siraiki.blogspot.com/2013/12/languages-of-punjab.html|title=سرائیکی ساݙی قومی زبان ہے : Languages of Punjab|first=پرویز|last=قادر|date=8 December 2013|publisher=}} < /ref > 
 
 However, over time, this linguistic category or grouping has come to be linked to various indigenous regional demands and aspirations and is now thought to be an ethnic group in itself.
