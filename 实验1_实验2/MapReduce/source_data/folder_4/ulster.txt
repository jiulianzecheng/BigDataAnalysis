 '''Ulster''' is one of the four [[Provinces of Ireland|historical provinces]] which make up the island of [[Ireland]]. The others are [[Leinster]], [[Munster]] and [[Connacht]].  
 
 There are nine [[county|counties]] in Ulster. Three of them are in the [[Republic of Ireland]]: 
 *[[County Cavan]] 
 *[[County Donegal]] 
 *[[County Monaghan]]  
 
 The other six counties make up all of [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]: 
 *[[County Antrim]] 
 *[[County Armagh]] 
 *[[County Down]] 
 *[[County Fermanagh]] 
 *[[County Londonderry]] 
 *[[County Tyrone]] 
 
 Due to the fact that most of Ulster is in Northern Ireland, the name  " Ulster "  is also sometimes used to mean ''Northern Ireland'', even though Northern Ireland is only part of Ulster. This is called ''[[totum pro parte]]'' in [[Latin]] which means  " the whole for a part " .
