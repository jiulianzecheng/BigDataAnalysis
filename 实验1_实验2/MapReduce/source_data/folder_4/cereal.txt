 '''Cereal''' usually refers to a type of [[Poaceae|grass]] that is grown to be eaten. Some, such as [[wheat]], are mostly used to feed people. Some are fed to [[cattle]], and lesser amounts are used for other purposes.  
 
 It is a common [[breakfast]] [[:wikt:meal|meal]]. The kind of cereal eaten for breakfast is called [[breakfast cereal]]. This is made of grain, and usually eaten with milk in the [[USA|United States]]. < ref name=britannica > {{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/78499/breakfast-cereal |title=breakfast cereal -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |first= |encyclopedia=britannica.com |year=2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012}} < /ref >  It is often sweetened with sugar, syrup, or fruit. < ref name=britannica/ > 
 
 The word  " cereal "  comes from '[[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]', the name of the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of harvest and agriculture.  [[Grain]]s are called ''corn'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], but in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] ''corn'' means ''[[maize]]''. 
 
 == History == 
 In the 19th century, Americans ate [[meat]] a lot for breakfast and usually did not eat grains and fiber. But after that, people who were interested in eating more healthy foods began a push for healthy breakfasts. < ref name= " history " > {{Cite web |url= http://www.fitnessandfreebies.com/health/cereal.html |title=The History of Cereal | publisher = Fitness and Freebies  |accessdate=1 May 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 This brought up the creation of [[Granula]]. The name ''Granula'' comes from ''granulates'', formed of [[grain]]. In 1863 this became the first breakfast cereal and included heavy nuggets made from bran, the outer husk of a grain that is taken out when making [[flour]]. The cereal had to be soaked overnight before being eaten. Simply pouring milk over it was not enough to make it eatable. < ref name= " history "  / > 
 
 The cereals eaten today grew out of a health campaign that began in the 1860s. Thin baked dough served to patients in hospitals inspired two men, C.W. Post and W. K. Kellogg. These two men started their own companies, named them after themselves. < ref name= " history "  / >
