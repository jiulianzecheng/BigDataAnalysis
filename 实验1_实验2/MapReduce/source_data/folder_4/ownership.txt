'''Ownership''' means total [[possession]] or control of [[property]], which may be a [[business]], an [[personal property|object]], [[land]] or [[real estate]], [[intellectual property]] or some other kind of property. 
 
 The rights of ownership are:  
 
 # Making decisions about what is owned, and  
 # Benefiting from the [[Returns (economics)|economic returns]] of what is owned. 
 
 Ownership can be divided, or shared between owners. Ownership has no legal value until [[money]] is added into the situation. The [[surplus]], or [[Profit|profits]], or money value of what is owned is divided according to the ownership accounts. 
 
 Ownership is needed for the development of the [[capitalist]] socio-economic system. The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of [[years]] and in all [[culture]]s.
