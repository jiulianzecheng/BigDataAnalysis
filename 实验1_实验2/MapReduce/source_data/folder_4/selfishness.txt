Selfishness means the quality or state of being selfish and selfish means lack of consideration for other people. It is having more concern for [[Self|yourself]] than for others. A selfish man aims at obtaining as much happiness as he can for himself and does not care whether other people are happy or unhappy. In order to attain his object, he tries to appropriate as large a share as possible of the good things of this world. It may be accompanied by a lack of [[empathy]]. Selfishness is the opposite of [[Altruism|selflessness]]. It is also different, though related, to [[Egocentrism|self-centredness]] and [[self-affirmation]]. Many psychologists approve of a healthy level of selfishness, < ref > N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 8 < /ref >  in order for some people to stay [[Happiness|happy]]. 
 
 In the study of [[ethics]] and [[morality]], selfishness is usually considered bad. In contrast, acts of selflessness are praised. Wider debate about it, however, such as in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[economics]], has shown that scholars have had many different opinions about its value and consequences. In most major [[religion]]s, selfishness is considered an immoral or bad habit. In [[Christianity]], it is associated with [[pride]], often considered the worst of the [[Seven deadly sins]]. < ref > Dante, ''Purgatorio'' (1971) p. 65 < /ref >  [[Aristotle]] condemned men who would only try to profit themselves; but he approved of those who would try to gain the praise from others that he deserved. < ref > Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 301-3 < /ref > 
 
 In the context of modern-day economics, there is a much wider opinion. [[Bernard Mandeville]] has argued that the [[Economic development|economic advancement]] of [[society]] depends on selfish actions. < ref > Mandeville, ''The Fable of the Bees'' (1970) p. 410 and p. 81-3 < /ref >  [[Ayn Rand]] argued that selfishness is a [[virtue]] and the cause of all [[progress]]. < ref > P. L. Nevins, The Politics of Selfishness'' (2010) p. xii-iii < /ref >
