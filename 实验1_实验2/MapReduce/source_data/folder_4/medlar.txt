 The '''medlar''' is a [[tree]] and the name of the [[fruit]] of this [[tree]]. Its [[Latin]] name is ''Crataegus germanica'', or  " German medlar " , but it is not from [[Germany]]. It grows in the Near East and South-Eastern [[Europe]], and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took it to Germany. Near the [[Caspian Sea]], people grew the medlar about three thousand years ago. It came to [[Greece]] in about 700 BC and to [[Rome]] in about 200 BC. It was an important fruit plant in Roman and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times. But by 1600-1700, people started eating other fruits and not the medlar. Today people do not grow it very often. 
 
 The medlar needs warm [[summer]]s and mild (not too cold) [[winter]]s and likes to grow in [[sun]]ny, dry places. In the best places, the plant can grow up to eight [[metre]]s tall. The medlar is ''deciduous'': it is not green all year. Usually, it is shorter than a tree. It lives between thirty and fifty [[year]]s. Medlar [[leaf|leaves]] are dark green, maximum fifteen centimetres long and three centimetres wide. The plant has [[flower]]s in late spring. The flowers are white. The red-brown medlar fruits are similar to [[apple]]s and grow to two to three centimetres. They are very hard and [[acid]]ic, and we can only eat them after the cold weather makes them soft.
