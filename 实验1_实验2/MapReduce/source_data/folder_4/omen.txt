 An '''omen''' is a sign that is thought to foretell the [[future]], often signifying the advent of change. The word can mean something either  " good "  or  " bad "  is about to happen. The origin of the word is unknown, although it may be connected with the [[Latin]] word ''audire'', meaning  " to hear " . An example from the past, babies born with [[birth defect]]s were believed to be a bad or evil omen.
