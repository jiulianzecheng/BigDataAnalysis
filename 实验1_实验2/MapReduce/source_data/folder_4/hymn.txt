 Many early hymns were taken from the [[Psalms]]. Later hymns began to include  ideas from other parts of the [[Bible]].  [[Isaac Watts]] and [[Charles Wesley]] wrote many hymns. In in more modern times, [[Fanny Crosby]] wrote many more. Some hymns are prayers to God. Others tell about God. Songs which describe God or how people relate to Him are also called  " [[Gospel music|gospel]] songs "  instead of hymns. 
   
 One of the most famous hymns is [[Amazing Grace]] which also became a popular song. It was written by [[John Newton]] who was an evil person who later became a Christian. The hymn tells how God [[Salvation (Christianity)|saved]] him from [[sin]] even though he was unworthy.  < ref name= " dah " > [http://www.hymnary.org/text/amazing_grace_how_sweet_the_sound  " Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound " ], ''Dictionary of American Hymnology''.
