 '''Jigglypuff''', known in [[Japan]] as '''Purin''' (プリン), is one of the [[fiction]]al [[species]] of [[Pokémon]] from the ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[media franchise]] owned by [[Nintendo]] and [[Game Freak]]. Since it was introduced early in the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]], it has become one of the most famous Pokémon. 
 
 Jigglypuff is perhaps most famous for the song it sings which puts everyone who hears it into a deep sleep. < ref name= " dexjigglypuff2 " > '''Pokédex:''' If it inflates to sing a lullaby, it can perform longer and cause sure drowsiness in its audience. {{cite video game|title=Pokémon Gold |developer=Game Freak |publisher=Nintendo |date=2000-10-15|platform=Game Boy |language=English}} < /ref >  Jigglypuff then becomes upset because it assumes everyone is very bored by the song, and it draws all over their faces with a marker. 
 
 Jigglypuff is a small Pokémon, slightly shorter than [[Pikachu]]. It is shaped like a [[balloon]] and has a pink body with blue eyes, catlike ears, and a strange tuft of [[fur]] on its forehead. 
 
 ==In video games== 
 In the [[Pokémon (video game series)|''Pokémon'' video games]], Jigglypuff is famous among players because it learns the move Sing, which puts enemy Pokémon to sleep. This often causes them to lose the battle, and many players find it very annoying. 
 
 Jigglypuff was introduced in ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue]]'', the first ''Pokémon'' games. It has appeared in most of the games since then. It evolves into [[Wigglytuff]], an  " upgraded "  form of Jigglypuff. Starting with ''[[Pokémon Gold and Silver]]'', Jigglypuff has a pre-evolved evolutionary form, [[Igglybuff]]. Igglybuff was one of the 100 new Pokémon introduced in ''Gold'' and ''Silver''. Previously there were only 151. 
 
 Jigglypuff has also appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]],'' < ref name=bros > [http://www.smashbros.com/ Smash Bros.com] Retrieved July 17, 2006 < /ref >  ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', < ref name=melee > [https://web.archive.org/web/20071024173852/http://ssbm.detstar.com/characteroverview/ Super Smash Bros Melee.] ''detstar.com'' Retrieved July 17, 2006 < /ref >  ''[[Super Smash Bros.

It is a light and fast character who is great in the air. Its attacks include Rollout, Pound, Sing, Rest, and its Final Smash, Puff Up. 
 
 ==In anime== 
 Jigglypuff is one of the most famous Pokémon, alongside [[Pikachu]], [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], and [[Mewtwo]], mostly because it has appeared many times in the still-running [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]]. It usually appears unexpectedly and puts Pokémon and humans near it to sleep for a few minutes by singing its trademark song. It has a black permanent marker, similar to a [[Sharpie]], with which it often draws on people and Pokémon's faces while they are asleep. This is an act of [[revenge]] because everyone falls asleep when they hear Jigglypuff's song and Jigglypuff assumes it's because they are very bored by it. Since people are upset when Jigglypuff puts them to sleep, and Jigglypuff is upset when they fall asleep, it is a [[vicious circle]]. 
 
 In episode  " Beach Blank-Out Blastoise " , Jigglypuff somehow got stuck in [[Blastoise|Blastoise's]] hydro cannon. When it was finally freed, it put everyone to sleep and then drew on their faces.
