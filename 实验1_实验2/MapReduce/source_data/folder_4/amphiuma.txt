 '''''Amphiuma''''' is a [[genus]] of aquatic [[salamander]]s.  They are the only genus still living in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Amphiumidae'''. They are sometimes called  " [[conger eel]]s "  or  " congo snakes " , which is not correct. Amphiumas have one of the largest amounts of [[DNA]] in the living world, around 25 times more than a human. < ref > [http://www.scientificblogging.com/genomicron/junk_dna_and_the_onion_test  " Junk DNA and the Onion Test " ] 1 June 2008. < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 Amphiumas have a long body.  They are generally [[grey]]-[[black]] in color. They do have legs but they are very small. Amphiumas can be up to {{convert|116|cm|abbr=on}} long, their legs are only up to about {{convert|2|cm|abbr=on}}. It is because of this that they are often mistaken for [[eel]]s or snakes. They also do not have eyelids or a tongue. < ref name=EoR > {{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G.  &  Zweifel, R.G.|author= Lanza, B., Vanni, S.,  &  Nistri A.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0/page/72 72]|isbn= 0-12-178560-2}} < /ref >   
 
 Female amphiumas lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in wet mud.  They then stay coiled around them for about five months, until they hatch. The [[larvae]] have external gills. After about four months these external gills disappear and the lungs begin to work.  
 
 == Distribution == 
 Amphiumas live in the southeastern part of the [[United States]].  
 
 In the past they have lived in more areas. [[Fossil]]s from the [[Pleistocene]] time show that they once lived in [[Europe]]. 
 
 == Behavior == 
 During the day amphiumas hide in plants.  At night they become active and go hunting. Their prey include [[frog]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s and even other amphiumas. Hunting and eating habits are similar to that of the [[Axolotl]].  They suck food into their stomachs with vacuum force. They can become aggressive.  
 
 == Species == 
 There are three amphiuma species.  They are different because of the number of toes: 
 *[[Amphiuma tridactylum|Three-toed Amphiuma]] (''Amphiuma tridactylum'') 
 *[[Two-toed Amphiuma]] (''Amphiuma means'') 
 *[[Amphiuma pholeter|One-toed Amphiuma]] (''Amphiuma pholeter'')
