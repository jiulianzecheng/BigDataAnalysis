 '''Stranglation''' is death by compressing the neck until the supply of [[oxygen]] is cut off. The [[process]] is called '''strangling'''.  
 
 The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen. Strangling leads first to [[unconsciousness]], then to [[death]]. < ref name=ernoehazy > Ernoehazy, William Jr;  [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm Hanging injuries and strangulation]. ''www.emedicine.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006. < /ref >  Fatal strangling may occurs in accidents, and other causes of violence.  Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in [[erotic asphyxiation]], in the so-called  " choking game " .  
 
 Strangling is a technique in many [[combat sport]]s and [[self-defence]] systems. It is a method of winning a [[judo]] bout. Usually the opponent submits; if not, he is  " strangled out " , that is, the hold is continued until he passes out and is then immediately released. ''Shime-waza'', the judo term for this technique, has scored 97 times in World Judo events. No fatalities have resulted from it. < ref name=koiwai2 > Koiwai, Karl.

Investigation suggested that this was because the officers' training had not been so adequate as the training of top-class judo players. < ref name=koiwai2/ >
