 '''''Lambeosaurus''''' was a crested, [[duck]]-billed [[dinosaur]]. Its large hollow, bony crest was as big as the rest of its [[skull]]. Its function has been much discussed. 
 
 ''Lambeosaurus'' lived during the later [[Cretaceous]] period, about 76 to 75 million years ago (mya). Fossils of it have been found in [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[Montana]] (USA), and [[Baja California]] (Mexico), but only the two Canadian species have been described in detail. 
 
 ''Lambeosaurus'' was described by Dr. William A. Parks in 1923, 20 years after [[Lawrence Lambe]] (an early Canadian fossil hunter) had studied it. The [[genus]] ranged over much of [[North America]], and into [[Mexico]].

 ===Feeding=== 
 As a hadrosaurid, ''Lambeosaurus'' was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating [[plant]]s. It had a sophisticated skull that allowed a [[wikt:grind|grind]]ing motion like [[mammal]]ian [[wikt:chew|chew]]ing. Its [[tooth|teeth]] were continually replaced and were packed into dental batteries that each contained over 100 & nbsp;teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. 
 
 It used its [[beak]] to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a [[cheek]]-like organ. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4 & nbsp;meters (13 & nbsp;ft) above. < ref name=HWF04 > Horner, John R.; Weishampel, David B.; and Forster, Catherine A. 2004.

 Lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, which suggests  that ''Lambeosaurus'' and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts. < ref name=RTB86 > {{cite book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=|year=1986 |title=The dinosaur heresies: new theories unlocking the mystery of the dinosaurs and their extinction |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaurheresies0000bakk |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-8217-2859-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaurheresies0000bakk/page/194 194]}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Cranial crest=== 
 [[Image:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|right|A life restoration of tall-crested ''L. magnicristatus'']] 
 
 Like other [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurines]] such as ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'' and ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', ''Lambeosaurus'' had a distinctive crest on the top of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest. They include housing [[salt gland]]s, improving the [[olfaction|sense of smell]], use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. < ref name=JAH75/ > < ref name=DBN85 > {{cite book |last=Norman |first=David B. |authorlink=|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs: an original and compelling insight into life in the dinosaur kingdom|chapter=Hadrosaurids II |year=1985 |publisher=Crescent Books |location=New York|pages=122–127 |isbn=0-517-46890-5 }} < /ref >  Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of these [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]. < ref name=HWF04/ > 
 
 The large size of hadrosaurid eyes and the presence of [[sclerotic ring]]s in the eyes imply acute vision and [[diurnal]] habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of [[wikt:hearing|hearing]] also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related ''Corythosaurus'', of a slender [[stapes]] in place, which combined with a large space for an [[eardrum]] implies a sensitive [[middle ear]]. The auditory part of the [[inner ear]] was well-developed. < ref name=JAH75 > Hopson, James A. 1975. The evolution of cranial display structures in hadrosaurian dinosaurs.
