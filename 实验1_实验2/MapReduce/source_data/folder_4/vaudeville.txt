A '''Vaudeville''' was a [[France|French]] [[satire|satirical]] [[poem]] or [[song]] in the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th centuries]]. It was used a lot in French [[theatre]] where entertainments using such songs were called  " comédie en vaudeville " . Late in the 19th century, a type of [[variety show]] done in American theaters came to be called  " vaudeville "  which was popular from the early 1880s to the early 1930s. The typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a several different, unrelated performances which were grouped together into a single show. Entertainers typically traveled from town to town as arranged by a  " vaudeville circuit " . It became less popular after the rise of [[movie]]s, [[cinema]], and [[radio]], which eventually took over as the main forms of public entertainment. 
 
 == History == 
 The earliest vaudeville was the ''vau de vire'', a [[Normandy|Norman]] song of the [[15th century]], named after the valley of Vire. During the [[16th century]] a style grew in the towns in France called the ''voix de ville'' ( ''city voices''), whose name may have been a [[pun]] on ''vau de vire''. These were also [[satirical]]. The two styles came together and in the 17th and 18th century. The term 'vaudeville' came to be used for songs satirizing [[political]] and [[court]] events.  
 
 == Growth == 
 The comédie en vaudeville grew from the tradition of these simple songs. The [[Paris]] audiences in the late 17th and early 18th century enjoyed hearing the familiar vaudeville tunes to new words. These comedies then grew into [[opéra-comique]].
