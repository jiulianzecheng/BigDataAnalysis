 The '''lion''' ('''''Panthera leo''''') is a large [[mammal]] of the [[Felidae]] (cat) [[family (biology)|family]]. Some large males weigh over {{cvt|250|kg}}. < ref name =  " nowak " / >   Today, wild lions live in [[Sahara|sub-Sahara]]n [[Africa]] and [[western India]]. < ref > A few [[endangered]] lions live in Gir Forest National Park in [[India]] < /ref >  Lions are [[adapted]] for life in [[grassland]]s and mixed areas with trees and grass. The relatively small females are fast runners over short distances, and coordinate their hunting of [[herd]] animals. 
 
 Lions have disappeared from [[North Africa]] and [[southwest Asia]] in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]], about 10,000 & nbsp;years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the [[Yukon]] to [[Peru]]. < ref name= " Harington69 " > Harington, CR ‘Dick’ (1969).

There was a decline in its African range of 30–50% over two decades in the second half of the 20th century. < ref name= " IUCN "  / >  [[Habitat]] loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. 
 
 Lions are often called the  " king of the beasts " . They are used as [[symbol]]s representing [[courage]]. They appear in [[heraldry]] more often than any other animal. They are an [[icon]] of courage and royalty. 
 
 Lions live for 10 to 14 years in the wild. When they are captured, they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males do not usually live longer than 10 years. This is because wounds from fighting other males make their lives shorter. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian |location=Johannesburg |page=231|isbn= 0-86954-122-6}} < /ref >  They usually live in [[savanna]] and grassland. These areas do have bushes and trees, but lions are mainly adapted to catch prey in grasslands. Compared to other cats, lions are social. A group of lions is called a '''pride'''. In a pride of lions, there are related females, their young, and one or two adult males. Groups of female lions often hunt together. 
 
 Lions are [[carnivores]] and [[scavenger]]s. < ref name =  " Schaller213 "  / >   They are also [[apex predator]]s. < ref name=AWF > > {{cite web | title = Behavior and Diet | work = African Wildlife Foundation website | publisher = African Wildlife Foundation | year = 1996 | url =http://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/lion | access-date =14 June 2015}} < /ref >  Lions feed on [[antelope]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[zebra]]s, [[warthog]]s, [[wildebeest]], [[bird]]s, [[hare]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], [[giraffe]]s, and young [[elephant]]s. Lions scavenge animals either dead from [[natural causes]] (disease) or killed by other [[predator]]s. They keep a constant lookout for circling [[vulture]]s, because this means there is a dead or injured animal close by. < ref name =  " Schaller213 " > Schaller, George B. 1972.

 == Etymology == 
 
 The word  " lion "  comes from the Latin word  " leo "  which means lion. The Latin word itself is derived from the Greek word  " leon " . Both words originally came from even older languages such as Sanskrit and Ancient Egyptian. Basically, the word  " lion "  has been passed down through different civilizations over time. < ref > {{Cite web|title=lion - Quick search results {{!}} Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?q=lion & tl=true|access-date=2023-08-10|website=www.oed.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Adaptations == 
 They have an archetypal roar which is used to communicate with other group members and warn different intruders of [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] boundaries. 
 
 They have long, retractable claws which help the lion to grab and hold [[prey]]. They also have a rough tongue that helps them peel the skin of prey animals away from flesh and flesh away from bone. Across their belly, they have loose skin which allows the species to be kicked by prey with little chance of an injury. 
 
 == Description == 
 There are around 30,000 lions left in the wild in Africa. Only 350 lions (of the [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic lion]] [[subspecies]]) are left in Asia. They live in the Gir Forest < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.girlion.in/|title=Gir National Park Website|website=www.girlion.in|access-date=2020-02-15}} < /ref >  in the state of [[Gujarat]], [[India]]. 
 
 Lions hunt many animals, such as [[wildebeest|gnus]] and [[antelope]]s. Male lions usually [[weight|weigh]] between {{cvt|150|and|250|kg|lb}}. Large lions have reached {{cvt|250|to|270|kg}}. [[Female]]s (lionesses) are usually {{cvt|120|to|182|kg}}. < ref name= " nowak " > {{Cite book|last=Nowak |first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |url=https://archive.org/details/walkersmammalsof0001nowa |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}} < /ref >  Mature male lions are the only cats with a mane. The lion has a long body, short legs, large claws, big head, and a yellowish-brown coat. 
 
 == Behavior == 
 Lions live in groups that are called prides. About 10 to 40 lions may live in a pride. Each pride has a home area that is called a [[territory]]. Lions do not allow other [[carnivore]]s (meat-eating animals) to hunt in their territory. A territory can be as large as {{convert|260|km2|sqmi|abbr=off|lk=on}}. 
 
 The lions' roar is unique in each individual. It is used for territorial marking and warning off other lions in separate prides (or lone individuals). This however, is usually carried out by competing males. Other male lions will challenge the alpha of the pride to a fight in order to take their spot of dominance if they win. Lions actually have prides in order to strengthen their species throughout the generations  (Boothalingam 2018). 
 
 Lions are not built for extreme speed as [[cheetah]]s are, but hunt in packs. This is unusual in cats. The females usually do the hunting for the pride. However the males can sometimes help if needed, to take down large animals like a [[African buffalo|buffalo]] or a [[giraffe]]. After lions have brought down a prey, they [[suffocation|suffocate]] it by biting the front of its face to prevent it breathing. Lions also have long retractable claws which act like grappling hooks, to keep hold of prey. 
 
 Even though a lion is good at killing prey, they are not among the most dangerous animals to humans. < ref name=not > {{cite web|title=Top 10 Most Dangerous Animals In The World|url=http://www.conservationinstitute.org/top-10-dangerous-animals-in-the-world/|publisher=Conservation Institute|access-date=24 October 2015|date=28 April 2015|archive-date=20 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020032416/http://www.conservationinstitute.org/top-10-dangerous-animals-in-the-world|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Breeding == 
 A lioness is ready to have young when she is 2–3 years old. Young lions are called [[cub]]s. Cubs are born after {{frac|3|1|2}} months. The cubs are born blind; their eyes do not open until they are about a week old, and cannot see well until they are about two weeks old. Lions do not have a den (home) where they would live for a long time. The lioness conceals the cubs in thick bush, gullies, or rocky outcrops. If the hiding place has been seen by other predators, then the lioness will move the cubs to a new hiding place. The cubs will be introduced to the pride at about 6 weeks old. The cubs are very vulnerable when the lioness goes out to hunt and needs to leave the cubs behind. Also, when a new male takes over a pride from another male, he usually kills all of the cubs. The cubs' mothers will then mate with the new pride male, which means that the first batch of new cubs will be his offspring.  A litter of 2-6 cubs are born. Usually, only 1-2 cubs survive until introduced to the pride, at which point they are protected by the whole pride. 
 
 In zoos, lions have been known to breed with tigers. If the parents are a male lion and a female tiger, the offspring is called a [[liger]]. If the parents are a male tiger and a female lion, the offspring is called a [[tigon]]. 
 
 == Lions in heraldry == 
 {{main|Lions in heraldry}} 
 
 Lions appear in [[heraldry]] more often than any other animal. They traditionally [[Symbolism|symbolise]] [[courage]], [[wikt:valour|valour]] and [[royalty]].
