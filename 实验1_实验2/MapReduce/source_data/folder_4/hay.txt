 '''Hay''' is [[grass]] and other plants that have been cut, dried and collected. It can then be stored in [[wikt:pile|piles]] (called ''hay stacks''), or tied into blocks called ''bales''. Bales can be round or box shaped (usually called square bales). 
 
 Hay is mostly used to feed animals. Some animals that eat hay are horses, cattle, goats, [[donkey]]s, and [[rabbit]]s. Hay is fed when there is not enough [[pasture]] or [[rangeland]] on which an animal can [[graze]] or they can't graze year round. Farmers and ranchers often need to use hay in the winter when grass is not available. 
 
 Hay is different than [[straw]].  Hay is made from leafy grass and other plants (such as [[alfalfa]]) and is good for feeding animals.  Straw comes from the stems of cereal grains, and is not very nutritious.  Straw is normally used for bedding to keep animals warm and dry.
