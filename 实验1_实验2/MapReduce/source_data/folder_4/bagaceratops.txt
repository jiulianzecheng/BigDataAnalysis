 '''''Bagaceratops''''' (meaning  " small horned face " ) was a plant-eating [[dinosaur]] that had a bony ridge along the back of its [[skull]]. This [[ceratopsia]]n dinosaur lived during the late [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]], roughly 84 to 71 million years ago. ''Bagaceratops'' fossils have been found in [[Mongolia]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Bagaceratops'' had a large head, a bulky body, a [[parrot]]-like beak, [[cheek]] teeth, triangular cheek protuberances, a short snout horn, and a small frill on its head. This [[ornithischia]]n (bird-hipped) dinosaur was about 3 feet (1 m) long. ''Bagaceratops'' walked on four short legs (it was a [[quadruped]]).
