 During the war, the town was completely destroyed. The land was so badly damaged that it was hard to live there. So, the commune was not rebuilt. The site of the commune is kept as it was to show the violence of war. It is officially named a  " village that died for France. "  A municipal council of three members manages the commune. The council members are appointed by the prefect of the Meuse department.
