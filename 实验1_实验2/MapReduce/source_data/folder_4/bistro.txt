 A '''bistro''' (sometimes spelled '''bistrot''') is a small place, much like a [[café]].  In its original [[Paris]]ian version, a bistro is a small [[restaurant]]. It serves moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting.  Bistros are defined mostly by the foods they serve.  Home cooking with robust earthy dishes, and slow-cooked foods like [[cassoulet]] are typical. By using [[stew]]s and cassoulets they could cook the main food and it would last all day. < ref > {{citation | last1=Porcelli | first1=Joey | year=2006 | title=The Gyros Journey: affordable ethnic eateries along the front range | last2=Fong | first2=Clay | publisher=Fulcrum | isbn=978-1-55591-579-7 | page=98 }} < /ref > 
 
 Similar to bistros are [[brasserie]]s, which offer  slightly more elaborate meals.
