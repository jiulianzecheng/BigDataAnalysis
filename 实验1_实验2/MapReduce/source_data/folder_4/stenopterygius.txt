 '''''Stenopterygius''''' was a typical, [[dolphin]]-shaped [[ichthyosaur]] of the [[Lower Jurassic]]. It is like the poster reptile of the ichthyosaur family, ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'', but with slightly narrower [[flipper]]s  and a smaller [[head]]. Its name means  " narrow wing " . 
 
 ''Stenopterygius'' was more [[streamlining|streamlined]] than the earlier ichthyosaurs of the [[Triassic]] period, and likely swam faster in pursuit of [[prey]]. 
 
 Some ''Stenopterygius'' fossils have been found with the remains of juveniles inside--clearly instances of mothers dying before they could give birth. As with other ichthyosaurs, ''Stenopterygius'' females gave birth to live young. Their eggs developed internally before birth.
