 == Mythology == 
 === Journey from Underworld to human world === 
 Lainaotabi was the youngest queen of King [[Thongaren]] ({{lang-omp|[[Thongalen]]}}) of the [[Hell|underworld kingdom]] ({{lang-mni|Khamnung}}). Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of the King. [[Poireiton]], Thongalel's younger brother, was about to leave on a journey to ''[[Ancient Kangleipak|Tai Pang Pan]]''. The king asked Laikhurembi to go with [[Poireiton]] as his wife because Poireiton's own wife had died. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n245/mode/2up?|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=245}} < /ref >  However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. So, instead of Laikhurembi, Lainaotabi was sent to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n246/mode/2up?|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=246}} < /ref > 
 
 === Love with a mortal prince ===  
 {{Main|Nongban Pombi Luwaoba}}  
 Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) went with [[Poireiton]], her brother-in-law, on a journey to earth. Later, she became separated from him. She was adopted by King [[Koupalu]] as his daughter. Afterwards, she came to be known as ''Koubarol Namoinu'' ({{lang-omp|Koupalol Namoinu}}) alias ''Koubru Namoinu'' ({{lang-omp|Koupalu Namoinu}}). < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9t47AAAAIAAJ & q=leinaotabi|title=The North Eastern Geographer|date=1980|publisher=North East India Geographical Society|language=en}} < /ref >  She fell in love with prince ''Nongban Pombi Luwaoba'' of [[Luwang dynasty]]. She met the prince for the first time when he visited King Koupalu. She and prince Luwaoba married and led a happy life. God Thongalel did not want his own wife spending her days with another man. So, the thread of her life was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the Prince did not give up. He challenged God Thongalel to give back his wife's soul or to fight with him. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf_2DwAAQBAJ & dq=thongarel & pg=PA7|title=AKASHVANI: Vol. XXXIII, No.12 ( 17 MARCH, 1968 )|last=Delhi|first=All India Radio (AIR), New|date=1968-03-17|publisher=All India Radio (AIR),New Delhi|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " The Cultural Heritage of Manipur " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhUHEAAAQBAJ & dq=pombi+luwaoba & pg=PA183|title=The Cultural Heritage of Manipur|last1=Meitei|first1=Sanjenbam Yaiphaba|last2=Chaudhuri|first2=Sarit K.|last3=Arunkumar|first3=M.

Thongalel first sent his two younger brothers one by one for the fight. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba defeated his two divine opponents. Finally, Thongalel himself appeared before him. But this time, the prince realised that he was no match for powerful God. So, he begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu's life so that the [[Luwang dynasty]] might have further generation. Thongalel felt pity on him. So, he granted the couple to live for another hundred years with marital pleasure. According to legends, [[Luwang Ningthou Punshiba|Hongnem Luwang Punshiba]] was the son of Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and Nongban Pombi Luwaoba. < ref name= " The Cultural Heritage of Manipur " / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf_2DwAAQBAJ & dq=thongarel & pg=PA7|title=AKASHVANI: Vol. XXXIII, No.12 ( 17 MARCH, 1968 )|last=Delhi|first=All India Radio (AIR), New|date=1968-03-17|publisher=All India Radio (AIR),New Delhi|language=en}} < /ref >
