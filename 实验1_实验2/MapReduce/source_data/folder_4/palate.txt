 The '''palate''' is the roof of the [[mouth]] in humans and other [[mammal]]s. It separates the oral cavity (mouth) from the [[nasal cavity]]. < ref name=Wingerd/ > 
 
 A similar structure is found in [[crocodilia]], but, in most other [[tetrapod]]s, the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate. 
 
 The palate is divided into two parts, the anterior bony '''hard palate''', and the posterior fleshy '''[[soft palate]]''' or '''velum'''. < ref name=Wingerd > Wingerd, Bruce D. 1994. ''The human body concepts of anatomy and physiology''. Fort Worth: Saunders. 166, 478. {{ISBN|0030555078}} < /ref > 
 
 The hard palate is formed before birth.  If the fusion is not complete, it is called a [[cleft palate]]. This is a birth or [[congenital defect]]. 
    
 As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of [[taste]], ''palate'' can also refer to this sense itself, as in the phrase  " a discriminating palate " . By further extension, the flavour of a food (particularly beer or wine) may be called its palate.
