 In 1557, Humayun had a fatal fall from the stairs of his private observatory (some sources say his library). He was carrying books when his feet got caught in his robe and he tripped and fractured his head. He had bent down upon hearing the Azaan (the Muslim call to prayer). All medical aid proved useless, and Humayun died. He is known as  " the luckless one " .
