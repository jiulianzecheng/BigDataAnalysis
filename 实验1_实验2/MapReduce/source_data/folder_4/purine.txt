 '''Purines''' include two of the [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] in [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. 
 
 A purine is a [[cyclic compound|heterocyclic]] [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic]] [[organic compound]]. It is a [[pyrimidine]] ring fused to an [[imidazole]] ring. Purines are the most widely occurring [[nitrogen]]-containing heterocycles in nature. < ref > Rosemeyer H. 2004. ''Chemistry  &  biodiversity''. ''1'', 361. < /ref > 
 
 Purines and [[pyrimidine]]s are the two groups of nitrogenous bases, and the two groups of [[nucleotide]] bases.
