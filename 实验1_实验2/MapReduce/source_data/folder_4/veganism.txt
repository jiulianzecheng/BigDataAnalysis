 '''Veganism''' is a [[philosophy]] that says people should not use [[animal]]s. There are vegans who choose not to eat animals, and vegans who choose not to use them in any other way either. 
 
 Vegans do not eat or drink food that comes from animals, including [[meat]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and [[dairy]] products (like [[milk]], [[cheese]], and [[yogurt]]). A vegan diet is sometimes called a strict [[vegetarian]] diet.  Some vegans also do not eat [[honey]]. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/qa.html#whatabouthoneyandsilk | title = Vegan Outreach FAQ - What about honey and silk? | access-date = 2012-09-14 | author = Vegan Outreach | archive-date = 2015-01-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150103162155/http://www.veganoutreach.org/guide/qa.html#whatabouthoneyandsilk | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Many vegans try not to use any other animal products, such as [[leather]], [[wool]], [[feather]]s, [[bone]], [[pearl]] or [[Shoe|shoes]]. < ref > [https://www.topveganshoes.com/ The concept of Vegan Shoes] < /ref >  They also try not to buy or use products that have been [[animal testing|tested on animals]]. They may support animal welfare and [[animal rights]], and may campaign for these causes. 
 
 Vegans eat fruits, vegetables, [[beans]], grains, nuts, and seeds, and types of food made from them like vegan sweets, vegan cheese and vegan [[cake]]s.

What if the first three and last two letters of the word vegetarian were taken to describe people who at the time were called nondairy vegetarians? Morgan proposed the name; Watson liked it, as did the other members. Morgan and Watson married, and along with twenty-three other people, they founded the Vegan Society in England.}} < /ref >

 Some people become vegan because they disagree with the treatment of animals in the modern animal farm industry. Other reasons to become vegan are for [[health]], religious reasons, to protect the [[environment]], or because of world hunger. Animals eat a lot and take up a lot of resources. By not producing meat, milk, or eggs, a lot of food, land (as of 2006, 30% of the earth's land mass is used raising animals for food < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html|title=Livestock a major threat to environment|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2014-03-05|archive-date=2008-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > ) and water can be saved. For example, it takes about 16 pounds of grain to make 1 pound of grain-fed meat, so eating plants directly takes fewer resources. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://veganpeak.com/global-benefits-of-veganism/|title=7 Global Benefits Of Veganism {{!}} Nr. 7 Might Save Humankind|last=Hassert|first=Gustav|date=2019-09-05|website=Vegan Peak|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-21}} < /ref >  There is also the issue of antibiotic use in the industry. Animals are given antibiotics so often that the risk of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics is very possible in the near future. 
 
 Some vegans only eat foods that have not been cooked. Their diet is called [[raw veganism]]. Another more restrictive type of veganism is [[fruitarianism]]. Fruitarians only eat foods that can be harvested without harming or killing a plant.

Vitamin D deficiency can lead to [[rickets]] in children and osteomalacia in adults. In rickets, bones do not mineralize normally, causing growth retardation and skeletal deformities. It can be prevented by supplements, and by direct injections. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Hainla|first=Liis|date=|title=Which Vitamins Do Vegans Need?|url=https://veganavenue.com/vegan-vitamins/|access-date=2021-10-31|website=VeganAvenue.com|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 A typical vegan diet contains more iron than other diets. Yet, the incidence of iron deficiency in vegans is similar to omnivores. While legumes, nuts, vegetables, and dried fruits are rich in iron, vegans absorb iron less effectively. 
 
 ==Health== 
 Many people think that it is not healthy to be vegan. However, a vegan diet can have all of the nutrients needed for health. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Melina|first1=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=December 2016|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1970–1980|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|quote=It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.}} < /ref >  It is just more difficult to get the nutrients because there are fewer foods to choose from.
