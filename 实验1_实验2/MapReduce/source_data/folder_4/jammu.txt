 '''Jammu''' is a city in [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]].  It is on the banks of the [[Tawi River]] which is a tributary of the [[Chenab River]]. The [[Dogri language]] is spoken here among [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s. Jammu is called ‘city of temples’ because the Hindu [[temple]]s are in huge numbers there. They also have numerous mosques such as the central Jamia Masjid. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir/jammu |title=Introducing Jammu |author= |website= |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=23 January 2016}} < /ref >
