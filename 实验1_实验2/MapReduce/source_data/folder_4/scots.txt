 ===Origin=== 
 [[Northumbria]]n [[Old English]] was established in what is now southeastern Scotland as far as the [[River Forth]] by the seventh century. The region was part of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. < ref > [https://dsl.ac.uk/about-scots/history-of-scots/ A History of Scots to 1700], Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (DOST) Vol. 12 p. xxxvi < /ref >  [[Early Scots]] began to diverge from [[Northumbria]]n English in the twelfth and thirteenth century. There was immigration of [[Old Norse language|Scandinavian-influenced]] Middle English-speakers from the North and Midlands of [[England]]. < ref > A History of Scots to 1700, DOST Vol. 12 p. xliii < /ref > 
 
 Later influences on the development of Scots were from [[Romance language]]s via ecclesiastical and legal [[Latin]], [[Norman language|Norman]] < ref > A History of Scots to 1700, pp. lxiii-lxv < /ref >  and later Parisian [[French language|French]] from the [[Auld Alliance]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Middle Low German]] influences by trade and immigration from the [[Low Countries]]. < ref > A History of Scots to 1700, pp. lxiii < /ref >  Scots also includes loanwords from contact with Gaelic. 
 ===13-14th century=== 
 From the 13th century, Early Scots spread further into Scotland through the [[burgh]]s established by King [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. The growth in prestige of Early Scots in the 14th century and the decline of French in Scotland made Scots the [[wikt:prestige|prestige]] dialect in most of eastern Scotland. < ref > " A Brief History of Scots "  in Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (eds) 2003.

 ===17th century=== 
 From 1610 to the 1690s, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]], many Scots-speaking Lowlanders, about 200,000, settled there. < ref name= " Montgomery  &  Gregg 1997: 572 " > Montgomery  &  Gregg 1997: 572 < /ref >  In the core areas of Scots settlement, there were five or six times as many Scots as English settlers. < ref > Adams 1977: 57 < /ref >  Southern Modern English was adopted as the literary language after 1700, and  " Modern Scots "  is sometimes used to describe the spoken language after 1700.
