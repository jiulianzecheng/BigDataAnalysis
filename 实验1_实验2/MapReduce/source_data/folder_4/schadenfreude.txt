 '''Schadenfreude''' comes from the [[Germany|German]] [[word]] by the same [[name]]. It literally translates to [[harm]] [[Happiness|joy]]. It is the happiness that somebody gets when somebody else is [[Pain|hurt]]. [[Psychologist|Psychologists]] [[Theory|theorize]] that there are three causes for this [[emotion]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118257982.ch6|title=The Think Big Manifesto|date=2011-11-15|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-1-118-25798-2|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|pages=163â€“166|doi=10.1002/9781118257982.ch6 }} < /ref >  [[Aggression]], [[Rival|rivalry]], or [[justice]]. [[Aggression]]-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else's [[group]] [[Failure|fail]] makes them feel better about themselves. Rivalry-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else fail makes them feel better about themselves. These may seem similar, but the difference is in that aggression is related to [[in-group]] and [[out-group]] [[Identity (philosophy)|identities]], and rivalry is based on individuals. The last form is [[justice]]-based schadenfreude. This happens because people feel happy that someone [[Evil|bad]] is being [[Punishment|punished]]. They feel good that the bad person is getting what they deserve.
