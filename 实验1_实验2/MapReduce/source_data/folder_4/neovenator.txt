 '''''Neovenator''''' is a [[dinosaur]] related to the [[clade]] which contains ''[[Allosaurus]]'' as its key member. Since the discovery of ''Neovenator'' on the [[Isle of Wight]], [[UK]], it has become one of the best-known large carnivorous [[dinosaur]]s in [[Europe]].   
 
 ''Neovenator'' was about 7.5 & nbsp;meters (24.5 feet) in length, and was of a slim build, weighting 1000{{ndash}}2000 kg. < ref > Paleofilescom.

 Fossil remains of ''Neovenator'' have been found on the [[Isle of Wight]] (southern [[England]]), and were first discovered in the 20th century. ''Neovenator'' existed alongside ''[[Baryonyx]]'', ''[[Polacanthus]]'' and ''[[Iguanadon]]'' in the early [[Cretaceous]]. It was one of the top predators of its day. 
 
 The [[holotype]] of ''Neovenator salerii'' had many pathologies. They were  " midcaudal vertebrae fusions, healed fractures of mid-caudal vertebra transverse processes; [[osteophytes]] affecting pedal phalanges, healed [[gastralia]] rib fractures, some forming [[false joints]]... [and] scapula fracture " . < ref name= " molnar-pathology " > Molnar R.E. 2001. Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: ''Mesozoic  vertebrate life'', edited by Tanke D.H.  &  Carpenter K. Indiana University Press, p. 337–363. < /ref >  This means the individual survived and healed after a number of [[bone fracture]]s.
