 '''Malindi''' is a town lying on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast of [[Kenya]]. It is 120 kilometres northeast of [[Mombasa]]. 
 
 Malindi has a tropical savanna climate (''As'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). The area shows classic examples of Swahili architecture. Malindi developed as part of Swahili Civilization in the 5th–10th centuries. 
 
 The Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] met Malindi authorities in 1498 to sign a trade agreement and hire a guide for the voyage to India, when he erected a coral pillar. 
 
 During World War II Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940. < ref name=Martin1970 > {{cite book|first=Esmond Bradley|last=Martin|title=Malindi. Past and Present|year=2009|publisher=The National Museum of Kenya|edition=New|orig-year=originally published in 1970}} < /ref > 
   
 After the World War II Malindi began developing into a resort. < ref name=Martin1970/ > 
 Malindi is home to the [[Malindi Airport]] and [[Broglio Space Centre]] (the previous San Marco Equatorial Range).
