 '''Miskolc''' is the third largest [[city]] of [[Hungary]] and the capital of [[Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén]] county. Its population is 178.950. 
 
 == Location == 
 Miskolc is in the north-eastern part of the country, east from the [[Bükk]] mountains, in the valley of the river Sajó and the streams [[Hejő]] and [[Szinva]]. Its area is 236.68 & nbsp;[[Square kilometre|km²]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Diosgyor castle.jpg|thumb|200px|The castle]] 
 The first known people who lived in this area are the Celts. The Hungarians came here in the end of the 9th century. The area was named after the Miskóc family who were its owners, and it was first mentioned in [[1210]]. The family lost a war against King Charles I and the king took away their properties. 
 
 A castle was built in Diósgyőr (a town near Miskolc; it is now a part of the city) in the 13rd century. It was the favourite castle of King Louis I who lived in the 14th century.  
 
 When Hungary was in a war with the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Ottomans burned down Miskolc in 1544. The Austrians also burned the city down in 1707 because Prince Francis Rákóczi, who started a freedom fight against the Austrians, lived in Miskolc for a while.

 In 1724 Miskolc became the capital of the county. The city developed. In the 18th and 19th centuries the people built many important buildings: schools, churches and a theatre. In the 1786 census (when they count the people) 14.719 people lived in Miskolc and there were 2414 houses. 
 
 After the [[World War I|first World War]] Miskolc became more important, because Hungary had to give Kassa, the other important city of the area, to [[Slovakia]]. Miskolc became a centre of iron industry. In 1945 Miskolc and Diósgyőr became one city. In 1949 a [[university]] was founded in Miskolc. Lots of people moved to Miskolc because they could find new jobs in the city. In the 1980s more than 200.000 people lived here. It was the second largest city in Hungary (the first was the capital [[Budapest]]). Now Miskolc is the third largest, the second is [[Debrecen]]. 
 
 Since the 1990s the iron industry is less successful and lots of people lost their jobs.  
 
 Miskolc is now an important cultural city and tourists like it too. The theatre holds an opera festival every year. The most beautiful parts of the city are Tapolca (with a famous warm water bath in a cave), Lillafüred (with a hotel which looks like a palace and is called Palace Hotel) and the castle of Diósgyőr.
