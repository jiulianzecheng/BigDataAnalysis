 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 [[File:Abszess.jpg|thumb|An abscess]] 
 Abscesses can form in any kind of solid tissue. They are usually on the skin surface (such as a [[boil]]s, or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, [[brain]], [[teeth]], [[kidney]]s and [[tonsils]].  The condition can become more complicated if the pus and the infection spread to other parts of the body. This can lead to [[gangrene]], where areas of body tissue die. 
 
 The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills. 
 
 Internal abscesses are more difficult to find. The abscess can be painful, and a person will have a high temperature, and generally feel unwell. 
 Internal abscesses do not usually heal without medical treatment. In some cases an abscess could even cause death, for example where an abscess in the neck put pressure on the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]. 
 
 If abscess is on the surface, it may be  " fluctuant " , that is it feels like it is full of fluid, when touched. This is a wave-like motion caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess. < ref > {{cite book|title=Churchill Livingstone medical dictionary.|url=https://archive.org/details/churchilllivings0000unse_h5h1|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780080982458|edition=16th}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 Abscesses are caused by [[bacterial infection]], parasites, or foreign substances. 
 Bacterial infection is the most common cause. < ref name=Cox2007/ >  Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection. < ref name=El2009/ >  In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is MRSA. < ref name=NEJM2014/ >  Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive ''Staphylococcus aureus'' is the most common organism involved. 
 
 Rarely [[parasites]] can causes abscesses and this is more common in the developing world. < ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/ >  Specific parasites known to do this include: [[dracunculiasis]] and [[myiasis]]. < ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/ >
