'''Strabane (Irish: An Srath Ban)''' is a [[town]] in the west of [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The town lies just east of the border between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and Northern Ireland with the town of [[Lifford]], [[County Donegal]], across the River Foyle to the west. Strabane is the second-largest town in the county. It stands roughly half-way between [[Omagh]] and [[Derry]] and roughly half-way between Omagh and [[Letterkenny]] and has a population of 17,000 people. Lifford Bridge connects Strabane with Lifford. The River Mourne flows through the centre of the town, and meets the River Finn to form the [[River Foyle]].
