 '''Akakor''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Ancient history|ancient]] underground [[city]] somewhere between [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]].  
 
 The German [[journalist]] [[Karl Brugger]] described the city in his book ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' (1976). Information about the city is from an interview with [[Tatunca Nara]], a Brazilian Indian. Tantunca Nara speaks about possible contact with [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] in the ancient past. He says these extraterrestrials are believed to have built this mysterious city. Two similar cities are mentioned in this book - [[Akanis]] and [[Akahim]].  
 
 Later [[Rüdiger Nehberg]] showed that Tatunca Nara was actually a German named Günther Hauck. 
 
 Parts of the story from ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' were used in the movie ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.
