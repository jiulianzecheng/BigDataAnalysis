Defined broadly, a '''visionary''', is one who can envision the future.  For some groups, this can involve the [[supernatural]] or use of mind-altering drugs. 
 
 A visionary state can be achieved via [[meditation]], [[drug]]s, [[lucid dream]]s, [[daydream]]s, or [[art]]. One example is [[Hildegard of Bingen]], a 12th century artist/visionary and [[Catholic]] [[saint]]. < ref > [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/247.html Hildegard of Bingen, Visionary] < /ref >  Other visionaries in religion are [[Mohammed]] (who had a vision of and communed with the [[Angel Gabriel]]), [[St. Bernadette]] (who had a vision of contact with the [[Blessed Virgin]]), and [[Joseph Smith]] (who had a vision of contact with the [[Angel Moroni]]). 
 
 == Extended meanings == 
 
 A ''vision'' can be political, religious, environmental, social, or technological in nature. By extension, a ''visionary'' can also be a person with a clear, distinctive and specific (in some details) vision of the future, usually connected with advances in [[technology]] or social/political arrangements. For example, [[Ted Nelson]] or U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]] is referred to as a visionary in connection with the [[Internet]]. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1581891.stm BBC News | SCI/TECH | Visionary lays into the web] < /ref > 
 
 Other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day, as some forms of ''visioning'' (or gazing) can provide a glimpse into the possible future. Therefore, visioning can mean seeing in a [[utopian]] way what does not yet exist on earth, but might exist in another realm, such as the [[ideal]] or perfect realm as imagined or thought. Examples are [[Buckminster Fuller]] in [[architecture]] and [[design]], and some of the pioneers of [[personal computer|personal computing]] such as [[Steve Wozniak]]. Some people use [[mathematics]] to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the [[universe]]. In that sense, a visionary may also function as a secular [[prophet]]. Some visionaries emphasize [[communication]], and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group. 
 
 == In art == 
 Artists may produce work loosely categorized as '''visionary art''' for its [[luminous]] content and/or for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of [[perception]] in the viewer: (e.g. [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Jean Delville]], [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], the French [[Symbolist]] [[Odilon Redon]], [[Brion Gysin]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Stanley Spencer]], [[Edward Burne Jones]], [[Adolf Wolfli]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[William Blake]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]], and [[Henry Darger]]). 
 
 [[Visionary art]] can be incorrectly defined as a category of [[primitive art]] (art of those not formally trained) rather than describing people who have used their visions (or [[dreams]]) to create their [[painting]]s. [[Salvador Dali]] is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither [[religious]] nor primitive.
