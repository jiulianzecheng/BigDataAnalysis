 '''Holly''' is a type of [[shrub|bush]] with recognisable leaves. The leaves have sharp edges, and are often used to decorate a house on [[Christmas Day]]. Some types of holly are used to make [[tea]]. The leaves of the Holly don't fall of in the winter because they're very thick and have a waxy layer on them. 
 Holly bushes produce berries that birds often eat during the winter season. The plant often signifies holidays such as Christmas, or the start of a new season.
