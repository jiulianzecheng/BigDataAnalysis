 Pilbara is known for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal peoples]], its stunning [[landscape]]s, its red earth and its vast [[mineral]] deposits, in particular [[iron ore]]. It is a dry region, but it has [[cyclone]]s every year or two. The cyclones bring a great deal of rain when they do occur. 
 
 The area is known for its [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and iron ore deposits, which make up much of the economy of Western Australia. Other than [[mining]], pastoral activities as well as fishing and tourism are the main industries. < ref name= " deph " > {{cite web |url=http://www.health.wa.gov.au/services/detail.cfm?Unit_ID=52 |title=Department of Health: Pilbara |date=19 January 2011 |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=28 August 2011 }} < /ref >
