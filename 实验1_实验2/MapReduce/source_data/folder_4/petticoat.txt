 A '''petticoat''' is a woman's [[undergarment]], shaped like a [[skirt]] or skirt+[[bodice]]. < ref > Concise Oxford Dictionary. < /ref >  Think of it as a skirt underneath a regular skirt. The purpose is possibly [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and certainly to make the skirt fly out in an attractive way.  
 
 Petticoats which are [[starch]]ed, with [[ruffle]]s, or made with stiff [[fabric]], can support a wider skirt. The ultimate in this trend is the [[crinoline]], which is a petticoat structure which includes [[hoop]]s of [[whale]]bone. Crinolines are not worn today, but petticoats are sometimes worn with ballgowns. 
 
 == Petticoats in the 20th century == 
 For most of the first half of the 20th century, with a few exceptions, petticoats were out of fashion. Certainly ''multiple'' petticoats were not needed for the narrow skirts and dresses which were fashionable. Some evening [[gown]]s needed petticoats, but they were finished off by [[WWII]] wartime [[ration]]ing and shortages. 
 
 Petticoats were revived by [[Christian Dior]] in his full-skirted ''New Look'' of 1947. Tiered, ruffled, stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s, especially with [[teenager|teenage]] girls. Typically, at least three single petticoats were worn, until manufacturers began making double and triple layer petticoats. A narrow [[Slip (clothing)|slip]] was usually worn under the petticoats, especially the crinoline type, because they tended to be 'scratchy'. 
 
 Dior continued this theme with his ''A-Line'' collection of Spring 1955, < ref name= " Ward 2005 " > {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Susan|title=Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-684-31394-4|pages=35–36|editor=Steele, Valerie|chapter=A-Line dress}} < /ref >  which featured  the  " most wanted silhouette in Paris " . This was a  " fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt " . < ref name= " Ward 2005 "  / >  Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats. 
 
 Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. < ref name= " Ward 2005 "  / >  That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior’s successor, [[Yves Saint Laurent]], with his ''Trapeze Line'' of Spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. < ref name= " Ward 2005 "  / >  A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s.
