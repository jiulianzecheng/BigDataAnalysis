 An '''acre''' is an [[England|English]] [[unit]] of [[area]], which is also used in the [[United States]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. It is most often used to describe areas of land. 
 * By the official definition it is 4,046.8564224 m < sup > 2 < /sup >  (4,840 [[square yard]]s). It is the area of one [[furlong]] by one [[chain_(unit)|chain]].  
 * The ''international acre'' is 4,046.8564224 m < sup > 2 < /sup > , or 0.404686 [[hectare]]s. This is based on ''international foot'' of 0.3048 m. 
 
 An acre is approximately equal: 
 * the area of an [[American football]] field. 
 
 Originally, it was seen as the area of land a [[farmer]] could [[plough]] with an [[ox]] in a day. Since this definition depended on the farmer and the ox, it looked variable. Therefore, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[George IV of England|George IV]] passed laws fixing its size. The Commonwealth countries, including the United States then also introduced these laws.
