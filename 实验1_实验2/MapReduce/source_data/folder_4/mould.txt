 '''Mould''' (or '''mold''') is a type of [[fungus]].

 Molds are a large group of fungi. The growth of their hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. < ref > {{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Mike|title=Moulds|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/indexmag.html?http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artjan99/mmould.html|publisher=Microscopy UK|accessdate=26 June 2012}} < /ref >  The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a [[mycelium]], is considered a single [[organism]].  
 
 Mould grows from spores, which float around in the air.  
 There are thousands of different kinds. Some molds cause disease or food spoilage. Sometimes people use them to make some kinds of [[cheese]]. Many [[antibiotics]] are developed from natural anti-bacterial substance made by moulds. 
 
 Mold or mould, also sometimes referred to as mildew, is a [[Fungus|fungal]] growth that develops on wet materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth should be avoided and proper inspection should be done for effective mold removal. < ref > {{cite web|title=Mold removal|url=https://www.ultimatemoldcrew.ca/bathroom-mold-removal-toronto/|publisher=Ultimatemoldcrew CA|access-date=12 January 2021}} < /ref >
