 In [[physics]], '''resonance''' is the tendency of a [[system]] to [[vibration|vibrate]] with increasing [[amplitude]]s at some [[frequency|frequencies]] of excitation. These are known as the system's ''resonant frequencies'' (or ''resonance frequencies''). < ref > Tongue, Benson, ''Principles of Vibration'', Oxford University Pres, 2001, {{ISBN|0-195-142462}} < /ref >  The resonator may have a ''fundamental frequency,'' and any number of ''[[harmonic]]s''. 
 
 An example of useful effect of resonant frequency is a [[guitar]] string which makes a characteristic [[noise]] when it is touched. The noise depends on how thick or slack the string is. 
 
 Another example can be seen in a [[Swing (seat)|playground swing]]. There is one specific rate at which you must push away a person on a swing to cause the swing to go high. This rate is the resonant frequency. 
 
 In [[earthquake engineering]], on contrary, any possibility of a resonance is detrimental for the [[building|building structure]]. 
 
 The [[Kirkwood gap]] and other connections among [[orbit]]s are caused by [[orbital resonance]].
