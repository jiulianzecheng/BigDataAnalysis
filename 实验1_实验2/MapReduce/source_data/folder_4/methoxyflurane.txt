'''Methoxyflurane''' (brand name: Penthrox) is an Australian liquid [[analgesic]] (a painkiller) which turns into a [[gas]] when it is exposed to the air. 
 
 It is breathed in through a special inhaler which is known in some places as the  " Big Green Whistle " .  It makes a slight whistling noise when the patient breathes through it. 
 
 The patient takes the medicine themselves in the presence of someone trained in its use. It can make them feel sick ([[nausea]]) or cause them to be sick ([[vomit]]). It also causes [[Dizzy|dizziness]].
