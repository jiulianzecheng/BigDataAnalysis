 '''Xerophytes''' are [[plant]]s which are adapted to dry/[[desert]] areas. They are a type of [[succulent plant]]. To survive these harsh conditions they have special features. < ref > Taylor D.J; N.P.O. Green  &  G.W. Stout 2001. ''Biological Science 1  &  2'', 3rd edition. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-56178-7}}. < /ref >  For example, a [[cactus]] has white hairs which help to prevent water loss. Another example is [[Arctostaphylos|manzanita]] plants, which have a thick [[wax]]y coating and keep their leaves vertical to the sun. 
 
 == Adaptions == 
 Some Xerophytic plants sit out a [[drought]]. They can still extract water from soil. They may have very salty cell sap and therefore a very low water potential in the roots; they may have very extensive or deep roots or may pick up the slightest dew and survive on that. 
 
 Others have special features about their shape or structure (xeromorphs). Thick waxy cuticle (''[[Aloe]]''); hairy surfaces (''[[Edelweiss]]''); dense packing of leaves, reduced leaf size (species of [[cypress]]); reduced density of stomata (many [[cacti]]); pitted and grooved position of stomata (Ammophila) Water storage in stem and tubers, etc. ([[baobab]]). They may also protect this water store from animals by [[spine]]s and [[chemical]]s.
