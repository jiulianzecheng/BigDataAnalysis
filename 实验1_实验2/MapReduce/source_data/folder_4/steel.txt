 '''Steel''' is [[iron]] mixed with carbon and perhaps other [[metal]]s. It is harder and stronger than iron. [[Iron]] with more than 1.7% [[percent]] carbon by [[weight]] is named [[cast iron]]. Steel is different from [[wrought iron]], which has little or no carbon. 
 
 == Making steel == 
 Steel has a long history. People in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were making small amounts of steel more than 2,500 [[year]]s ago. It was very expensive and was often used to make [[sword]]s and [[knives]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], steel could be made only in small amounts since the processes took a long time. 
 
 In the time since, there have been many changes to the way steel is made. In about the year 1610 steel started to be made in [[England]], and the way it was made got better and cheaper over the next 100 years. Cheap steel helped start the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[England]] and in [[Europe]]. The first industrial [[Converter (metallurgy)]] for making cheap steel was the [[Bessemer converter]], followed by Siemens-Martin open-hearth process.  
 
 Today the most common way of making steel is the basic-oxygen process.  The converter is a large [[turnip]]-shaped vessel.  Liquid raw iron called  " [[pig iron]] "  is poured in and some [[scrap]] metal is added in to balance the heat. [[Oxygen]] is then blown into the iron. The oxygen burns off the extra carbon and other impurities.  Then enough carbon is added to make the carbon contents as wanted. The liquid steel is then poured. It can be either [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] into molds or rolled into sheets, slabs, beams and other so-called  " long products " , such as [[railway track]] < nowiki/ > s. Some special steels are made in [[electric arc]] furnaces. 
 
 Steel is most often made by [[machines]] in huge buildings called ''[[steel mill]]s''.  It is a very cheap metal and is used to make many things.  Steel is used in making buildings and bridges, and all kinds of machines. Almost all [[ship]]s and cars are today made from steel. When a steel object is old, or it is broken beyond repair, it is called ''[[scrap]]''. It can be melted down and re-shaped into a new object. Steel is ''recyclable'' material; that is, the same steel can be used and re-used. 
 
 == Iron and steel chemistry == 
 Steel is a [[metal]] [[alloy]] which includes [[iron]] and often some [[carbon]].  
 
 Every [[material]] is made up of [[atoms]] which are very small parts. Some [[atom]]s hold together quite well, which is what makes some [[solid]] [[material]]s hard. Something made of pure iron is softer than steel because the atoms can slip over one another. If other atoms like [[carbon]] are added, they are different from iron atoms and stop the iron atoms from sliding apart so easily. This makes the metal stronger and harder.  
 
 Changing the amount of carbon (or other atoms) added to steel will change those things that are interesting and useful about the metal. These are called the [[property|properties]] of the steel. Some properties are: 
 
 * [[Hardness]]  
 * How easily it bends  
 * [[Ductility]]: can it be made into thin wires?  
 * Is it [[magnetic]]? Can a [[magnet]] pick it up? 
 * Will it [[rust]] (or [[Corrosion|corrode]])? 
 
 Steel with more carbon is harder and stronger than pure iron, but it also breaks more easily ([[wikt:brittle|brittle]]). 
 
 == Types of steel == 
 
 There are thousands of steel types, each made of different amounts of different chemical elements. 
 
 All steels have some elements that have a bad effect, such as phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S). Steel makers take out as much P and S as possible. 
 
 '''Plain carbon steels''' are made only of iron, carbon, and undesired elements.  They fall into three general groups. Plain carbon steel with 0.05 to 0.2% carbon does not harden by [[heat treating]].  [[Welding]] it is simple, so it is used for shipbuilding, boilers, pipes, fence wire and other purposes where low cost is important.  Plain  steels are used for springs, gears, and engine parts.  Plain carbon steel with 0.45 to 0.8% carbon is used for very hard items such as shears and machine tools. 
 
 '''Alloy steels''' are plain [[carbon steel]] with metals such as [[Boron]] (B), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[chromium]] (Cr), [[nickel]] (Ni), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[tungsten]] (W), and [[cobalt]] (Co) added.  These give other properties than plain carbon steel.  Alloy steels are made for specialized purposes. For example, chromium can be added to make [[stainless steel]], which does not rust easily, or boron can be added to make very hard steel that is also not brittle.[[File:Steel wire rope.png|thumb|Steel [[rope]] or [[cable]], made of many thin steel [[wire]]s]] 
 
 == Uses of steel == 
 There are a huge number of things that people make from steel. It is one of the most common and useful metals.  
 A lot of items made from iron in the past are now made of steel. Some of them are: 
 * [[Tool]]s 
 * [[Machine]]s 
 * [[Motor]]s and [[engine]]s 
 * [[Wire]]s 
 * [[Rail tracks|Rails]] for [[Railway|trains]] 
 * [[Building|Buildings]] 
 * [[Bridge]]s 
 * Bars for making reinforced [[concrete]]  
 * Hulls of [[ship]]s and large [[boat]]s 
 * [[Car]] and [[Railway|train]] bodies 
 * Major appliances 
 * [[Cutlery]] and [[knives]]
