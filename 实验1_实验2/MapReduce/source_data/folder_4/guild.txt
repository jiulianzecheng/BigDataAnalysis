 A '''guild''' is an [[association]] of [[craftsman|craftspeople]] or [[merchant]]s who control the practice of their craft in a town. < ref > Jovinelly, Joann  &  Netelkos, Jason 2006.

 Many groups of people started as guilds, including [[scholar]]s, and religious guilds. Many modern organisations, like [[universities]], started as guilds. However, the basic idea of a guild was to control the training and practice of a [[trade]] or business. In Europe, guilds were given authority by the [[monarch]]. New young members had to serve as [[apprentices]] to a master for a certain length of time (such as seven years). At the end they became full members of the guild, and could set up on their own, and take apprentices of their own. That is the way the European world worked up to and including the first part of the 20th century. 
 
 There were guilds of [[weaver]]s and dyers in the [[wool]] trade, of [[mason]]s and [[architects]] in the [[building]] trade. There were guilds of [[painter]]s,  [[blacksmith]]s, [[baker]]s, [[butchers]], and so on. The [[Corporation of the City of London]] includes the  " livery companies " . These companies were originally guilds. The senior members of the livery companies choose the [[Lord Mayor of London]], the sheriffs and certain other officers. 
 
 Guilds were common in the [[city|cities]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. After that, around 1700 to 1800 their influence lessened somewhat. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] were much opposed to the idea of guilds. They believed that guilds hindered economic development and [[free trade]].
