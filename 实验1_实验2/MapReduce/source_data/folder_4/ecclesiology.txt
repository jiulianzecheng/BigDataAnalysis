{{Christianity}} 
 In [[Christian theology]], '''ecclesiology''' is the study of [[doctrine]] about the Church itself as a [[community]] and about the churches own view of its mission and role. 
 
 That means that ecclesiology looks at the role of the church in [[salvation]], at its origin, its relationship to the historical Christ, its discipline, its destiny (see [[Eschatology]]) and its leadership.  
 
 In addition to describing a broad discipline of theology, ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denominationâ€™s character, self-described or otherwise. This is the sense of the word in such phrases as ''[[Roman Catholic]] ecclesiology'', ''[[Lutheran]] ecclesiology'', and ''[[ecumenism|ecumenical]] ecclesiology''.  
 
 == Questions asked by ecclesiology == 
 
 Ecclesiology asks the questions: 
 * '''Who is the Church?'''  Is it a visible or earthly [[corporation]] -- a  " church "  in the sense of a specific denomination or institution, for instance?  Or is it the body of all believing [[Christianity|Christians]] regardless of their [[religious denomination|denominational]] differences and disunity?  What is the relationship between living Christians and [[saint|departed]] Christians (the  " cloud of witnesses "  [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] 12:1)-- do they (those on Earth and those in Heaven) constitute together the Church? 
 
 * '''Must one join a church?''' That is, what is the role of corporate [[worship]] in the spiritual lives of believers?  Is it in fact necessary? Can salvation be found outside of formal membership in a given faith community, and what constitutes  " membership? "  ([[Baptism]]? Formal acceptance of a [[creed]]? Regular participation?)  
 
 * '''What is the [[authority]] of the Christian church?'''  Who gets to interpret the doctrines of the Church? Is the organizational structure itself, either in a single corporate body, or generally within the range of formal church structures, an ''independent vehicle'' of [[revelation]] or of [[God]]'s [[divine grace|grace]]?   
 
 * '''What does the Church do?''' What are the [[sacrament]]s, divine ordinances, and [[liturgy|liturgies]], in the context of the Church, and are they part of the Church's mission to preach the [[Gospel]]?  
 
 * '''How should the Church be governed?''' What was the mission and authority of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], and is this handed down through the sacraments today? What are the proper methods of choosing [[clergy]] such as [[bishop]]s and [[priest]]s, and what is their role within the context of the Church?   
 
 * '''What are the roles of '[[spiritual gift]]s'''' in the life of the church? 
 
 * '''How does the Church's 'new covenant' relate to the [[covenant]]s''' expressed in [[Bible|scripture]] with God's [[chosen people]], the Jewish people? 
 
 * '''What is the ultimate destiny of the Church''' in Christian [[eschatology]]?
