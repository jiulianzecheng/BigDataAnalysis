[[File:Rocks in the sea - geograph.org.uk - 219304.jpg|thumb|right|220px|These are some of the oldest rocks in the [[Dingle]] Peninsula, being [[Silurian]] in date. They consist of mudstones and [[siltstone]]s with some volcanic material ([[County Kerry]])]]  
 
 A '''mudstone''' is a [[Silica|siliciclastic]] [[sedimentary rock]] which has a mixture of [[silt]]- and [[clay]]-sized particles (at least 1/3 of each). < ref name=Blatt > Blatt H; Middleton G  &  Murray R. 1980. ''Origin of sedimentary rocks''. 2nd ed, Prentice Hall,  Englewood Cliffs, N.J. ISBN  0-13-642702-2 < /ref >  So, a mudstone is a type of [[mudrock]] with a more varied grain size than either [[siltstone]]s or [[claystone]]s. 
 
 Alternatively, some sources say it is a [[synonym]] for [[mudrock]]. < ref > Kearey P. ''The new Penguin dictionary of geology''. London: Penguin Books. p176 < /ref >

 == Claystone == 
 A '''claystone''' is a [[mudrock]]  which does not split easily. 
 
 In order for a rock to be a claystone, it must be up to half (50%) clay, whose particles measure less than 1/256th of a [[millimeter]].
