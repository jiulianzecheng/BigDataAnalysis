 '''Opioids''' & nbsp;are substances that act on '''opioid receptors''' to & nbsp;produce [[morphine]]-like effects. < ref name= " :17 " > {{Cite book|title = Pharmacology and Physiology for Anesthesia: Foundations and Clinical Application: Expert Consult - Online and Print|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s8CXrbimviMC|publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn = 978-1437716795|language = en|first1 = Hugh C.|last1 = Hemmings|first2 = Talmage D.|last2 = Egan|year = 2013|page = 253|quote = Opiate is the older term classically used in pharmacology to mean a drug derived from opium.

 Opioids are [[chemical substance]]s that relieve [[pain]]. There are a wide range of natural and artificial opioids. They are used in [[hospital]]s to treat acute pain, as can occur after an operation. They can also be used to relieve pain, where treatment no longer makes sense, for example in certain [[cancer]] patients. Drugs that can relieve pain are broadly known as [[analgesic]]s. 
 
 Certain opioids are used as [[anesthetic]]s, as well as in [[emergency medicine]] and [[intensive care]]. There are cases which are difficult to manage with non-opioid analgesics. < ref > McQuay H. 1999. Opioids in pain management: a review. ''[[The Lancet]]''. '''353'''(9171):2229-32 PMID 10393001 < /ref > 
 
 Certain opioids have been used as [[illegal drugs]]. They can cause [[impairment]] if taken in large amounts. Most opioids are controlled substances, only available by [[prescription]]. 
 
 The term '''Opiate''' is sometimes used as a [[wikt:synonym|synonym]]. Most often it is used to refer to opium alkaloids, and semi-synthetic opioids. 
 
 == Natural opioids == 
 === Endogenous opioids === 
 So called ''endogenous opioids'', also called [[endorphins]], are [[peptide]]s produced by the human body. They are used to respond to [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], to suppress [[pain]] and [[hunger]]. They also interact with [[sex hormone]]s and they can cause a state of [[Euphoria]]. [[Mammal]]s produce them in the [[brain]]. 
 
 === Opium alkaloids / Opiates === 
 There are different [[alkaloid]]s that naturally occur in [[opium]]. Opium is produced from [[Opium poppy]]. The most important ones are [[morphine]], [[codeine]] and [[thebamine]]. [[Papaverine]] and [[noscarpine]] also occur in opium, but the way they work is different. Most of the time, they are therefore not counted as ''opiates''. 
 
 == Semi-synthetic opioids == 
 These are produced based on natural opioids, which are changed. Examples include [[heroin]] and [[oxycodone]] 
 
 == Fully synthetic opioids == 
 Examples are  
 *[[pethidine]] 
 *[[methadone]] 
 
 == Addiction to opioids == 
 [[Drug tolerance]] to opioids and other [[narcotic]]s can develop with long use.  This means that higher doses will be needed to keep the same effect.  It also means that the body will eventually learn to operate normally with that amount of medication.  When the user tries to stop taking these pain killers, [[withdrawal symptom]]s appear. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Drug withdrawal treatment|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/treatment-centers/resolutions|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-14|website=American Addiction Centers|language=en}} < /ref >  Withdrawal from opioids is not life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable, so it is important to get medical supervision. These symptoms include restlessness, pain in the bones and muscles, insomnia, diarrhoea, vomiting and involuntary leg movements. However, the psychological symptoms, including cravings, depression, anxiety, and insomnia, are more likely to lead a person to relapse if they are not working with a doctor to safely detox. 
 
 If the [[addiction]] keeps on going, eventual permanent brain changes can appear, which eventually adapts to the drugâ€™s presence. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=How Opioids use can change brain chemistry|url=https://adcare.com/programs/inpatient/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Adcare.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Both prescription and recreational users of Opioids find that they will have to take increasingly larger doses of the drug to get the same effects, a process known as developing a tolerance. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Addiction Recovery - Drug tolerance and addiction recovery|url=https://deserthopetreatment.com/las-vegas-program/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-14|website=Desert Hope|language=en-US}} < /ref >  As users take greater and greater amounts of Opioids, they become progressively dependent on them. At this point, a full-blown addiction has developed. Even patients who experience chronic pain may be at risk for addiction, even though they are prescribed Opioids for treatment. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Prescription Drug Abuse Statistics  &  Rehab Options|url=https://treatmentsolutions.com/prescription-drug-abuse/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-13|website=Treatment Solutions}} < /ref >
