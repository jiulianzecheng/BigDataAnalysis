 '''''Homalocephale''''' was a thick-[[skull]]ed, plant-eating [[dinosaur]]. Its flat head housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes. The skull consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels. 
 
 ''Homalocephale'' grew to be about 5 feet long (1.5 m) and weighed about 95 pounds (43 kg). ''Homalocephale'' probably had a good sense of smell. It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull. It had leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and a stiff tail.
