 '''Robotics''' is a part of [[engineering]] and [[science]]. It is the work of creating and building [[robot]]s. It is [[interdisciplinary]], involving people who have studied [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]] or [[computer programming]]. It also needs people who understand the work of the robot. As an example, [[geologists]] need to be involved in making a robot that will take soil samples on another planet. 
 
 [[Robot]]s are sometimes used to do things that humans cannot, like finding and destroying [[bomb]] < nowiki/ > s, or going places that are too hot, small, dangerous or distant for humans. Some robots look like humans, but most just look like machines. Some robots can move by themselves, others need to be partly or completely controlled by a human. 
 
 Robotics comes from the word [[robot]], which in turn comes from the Slavic word ''robota''. ''Robota'' means labor, or work. Karel ÄŒapek invented the word ''robot'' to use in a play.  This play was called ''R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)''. The word ''robotics'' was first used by Isaac Asimov in his story  " Liar! "  published in 1941.
