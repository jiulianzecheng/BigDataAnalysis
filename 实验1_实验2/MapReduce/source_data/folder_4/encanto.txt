 == Plot == 
 Forced by the [[Thousand Days War]] to flee her village in [[Colombia]], a young Alma Madrigal loses her [[husband]] Pedro but saves her  three  [[children]]: Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. A [[miracle]] happens and her [[candle]] becomes [[magic]]. It gets rid of the people chasing them, and creates a living house, the Casita, for them to live in, along with a magical [[village]]  bordered by tall mountains—  " an ''encanto''. "   The candle's magic gives  " Gifts "  to each Madrigal [[descendant]], which they are to use to help the villagers. Bruno, who had the power of telling the future, disappeared after Mirabel, Julieta's youngest [[daughter]], did not get a gift, and ten years later Mirabel is still [[sad]] about not having one. Mirabel explains this with the [[song]] “The Family Madrigal” 
 
 On his fifth birthday, Pepa's youngest son, Antonio, gets the ability to talk with animals, and the family takes a picture with him but leaves out Mirabel. Mirabel then sings a [[song]] wishing she were also special. ( " Waiting on a Miracle " ). Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle's flame flickering, but is ignored when the Casita seems fine to the others. After overhearing Alma praying, Mirabel decides to save the miracle's magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister, Luisa, who admits that she has a hard time dealing with all the work she has to do ( " Surface Pressure " ). She suggests that Bruno's room may hold clues to the mystery. There, Mirabel finds a cave and gets pieces of a slab of [[emerald]]. After Mirabel gets out, Luisa realizes that her gift is weakening. After her family reminds her of the reasons that Bruno is not to be talked about ( " We Don't Talk About Bruno " ), Mirabel rebuilds the slab and discovers it is an image of Mirabel standing in front of a broken Casita. Mirabel takes this to mean that she will destroy the family. 
 
 Later that evening, Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela, who can make [[plant]]s and [[flowers]] grow whenever she wants, is supposed to become engaged to their neighbour Mariano Guzmán. But Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores, who has super hearing, lets everyone know that she overheard Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno's vision. The Casita begins to crack again, causing everyone's powers to go out of control, ruining the night and Mariano's proposal when Pepa accidentally starts a [[rainstorm]]. As everyone runs, Mirabel follows a group of rats and finds a secret passage behind a [[portrait]]. There she meets Bruno, who tells that his vision of Mirabel would have got her in trouble with the family so he broke the vision and went into hiding to protect her. He hid himself inside the house's walls so he could still be near them. Bruno tells her that the vision could change, meaning that Mirabel would either destroy the Madrigal family or fix it. At Mirabel's urging, he reluctantly conjures another vision. At first, it goes the same way as the last one, with Mirabel still standing in front of a broken Casita. But a golden [[butterfly]] appears, and the vision changes into an image of Mirabel [[hugging]] a young woman, who seems to be Isabela. 
 
 Mirabel apologizes to Isabela but accidentally gets her to admit that she does not want to marry Mariano and actually [[hate]]s having to be [[perfect]]. Then Isabella creates a [[cactus]] and wonders if she should grow whatever plants she feels like growing.  ( " What Else Can I Do? " ). After the song, they [[hug]], fixing the candle and the cracks. But, Alma sees the two of them, with Isabela growing whatever she wants. She accuses Mirabel of causing the family's problems out of [[jealousy]] for not having a Gift. Mirabel blames Alma for the immense pressure she puts on the family. Their rising [[argument]] weakens the candle again and creates a [[wikt:fissure|fissure]] that splits a nearby mountain and destroys the Casita. Despite Mirabel's trying  to save it, the candle dies in her hands, leaving all the Madrigals powerless. While the family and several locals look at the damage, Mirabel feels [[guilt]]y and leaves the town. 
 
 After a few hours of fruitless search, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel back at the river where Pedro died. She explains how, in her determination to preserve the magic, she ignored the toll it took on her family and finally takes responsibility for what happened ( " Dos Oruguitas " ). After hearing Alma's tragic backstory, Mirabel tells her that despite her flaws, she is the one who brought and protected the family together all these years. After a golden butterfly appears, they reconcile, and Bruno appears and confronts Alma to defend Mirabel, unexpectedly cheering her up with his return. They reunite with the Madrigals, and the townspeople arrive to help them rebuild the Casita ( " All of You " ). When the house is rebuilt, the Madrigals give Mirabel a gleaming doorknob with an M on it. When she places it in the front door, the magic springs back to life, restoring the Casita and all the family's Gifts and spreading through the village. The Madrigals pose for another family picture, this time with Mirabel and Bruno included.
