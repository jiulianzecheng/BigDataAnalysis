 '''Carnassials''' are large teeth used for shearing flesh and bone in a [[scissor]]- or [[Shear stress|shear]]-like way. They are found in many [[carnivorous]] [[mammals]],  
 
 In the [[Carnivora]], the carnassials are the modified last upper [[premolar]] and the first [[molar]]. In the [[Creodont]]a, the carnassials were further back in the jawâ€“first upper and second lower or second upper and third lower molars. < ref name= " Osborn1907 " > {{cite book|author=[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]|title=Evolution of mammalian molar teeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0eVtpUqWswC & pg=PA11|access-date=20 January 2011|year=1907|publisher=Macmillan}} < /ref > 
 
 Wear and cracking of the carnassial teeth in a wild carnivore (e.g. [[wolf|wolves]], [[lion]]s) may result in the death of the individual due to starvation.
