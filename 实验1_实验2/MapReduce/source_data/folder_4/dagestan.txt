 '''Dagestan''' is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] in the [[Caucasus]] region. The name comes from two combined [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words, ''dag'' which means [[mountain]] in the [[Turkic languages]], and ''stan'' which means land in the [[Persian language]]. Therefore, the literal translation of Dagestan is '''Land of the Mountains'''. Dagestan has a population of nearly 3 million, and its people are known as ''Dagestani''. Its capital city is [[Makhachkala]]. 
 
 == People == 
 Dagestan has the status of  " republic "  in Russia and has its own [[constitution]] and [[official language]]s. Republics in Russia are the home of its ethnic minorities (those who are not [[Russians]]), and usually one or two [[nationality|nationalities]] have a [[majority]] of the population in each republic. But in Dagestan, there are over 30 different nationalities (the largest of which are the [[Avar]], [[Lak]], [[Dargwa]], [[Lezgian]], and [[Tabasaran]]), and none of these form a majority. This is because the mountains in the region make it hard for people to move around. These people speak 30 different [[language]]s, but use [[Russian language|Russian]] as their [[lingua franca]] to communicate between each other. 
 
 Most people of Dagestan are [[Islam|Muslims]] and belong to the [[Shafi`i]] school of [[Sunni]] Islam.
