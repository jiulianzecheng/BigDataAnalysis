During the 15th-16th century, there were Gujjar kings in the areas of [[Meerut]] and Dadri. The Gujjars in Pakistan and Afghanistan are Muslim. 
 
 After this time, with struggles against the rising [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] power and later [[British India]] the Gujjars gradually fell into a decline.  They became poor nomads and started living in jungles and forests.  With Muslim rule in North India, the Hindu Gujjars of the area surrounding [[Delhi]] had to live in jungles in order to save their [[Hindu]] faith and to survive. Today, Hindu Gujjars are found in the [[India]]n states of [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], Western [[Uttar Pradesh]] and to a smaller extent [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. Muslim Gujjars are found in the Indian states of [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and in the [[Pakistan]]i provinces of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Azad Kashmir]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and in the [[Afghanistan]] province of [[Nuristan]].
