 '''Putty''' is a squeezy [[dough]]-like material used for filling small spaces. It is often used for [[woodwork]] repair. [[Painter]]s use it to fill holes and cracks in wood. Fireproof putties can be used round electrical boxes in [[drywall]] setups.  
 
 [[Plumber]]'s putty is waterproof, used to make watertight seals in plumbing. Putty is always used for traditional [[glazing]]. It fixes and seal panes of glass into wooden frames (or sashes). [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and metal window frames use synthetic sealants such as [[silicone]].  
 
 Glazing putty is traditionally made by mixing a base of whiting (finely ground [[chalk]]) with [[linseed oil]] in various proportions. In [[woodworking]], water-based putties are more often used: they have no [[odour]], and are easy to clean up. They work just as well with water-based and [[latex]] sealers. There are now synthetic putties of various types. There are [[epoxy]] (two-part) putties which dry hard as iron, and holes can be drilled in if needed.
