 '''''Tyrannosaurus''''' (from {{lang-el|τύραννος}}, tyrannos, meaning  " tyrant "  and {{lang|el|σαῦρος}}, sauros, meaning  " lizard " ) < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.azwordmeaning.com/el/74bb9695-translation-of-tyrannosaurus-in-greek.html|title=Tyrannosaurus Meaning in Greek - English to Greek Dictionary}} < /ref >  was a large [[predator]]y [[dinosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]], 68 to 65 million years ago. < ref name=hellcreekage > Hicks J.F.

 ''Tyrannosaurus'' was a [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]] with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Compared to the large and powerful hind limbs, its forelimbs were small, but powerful for their size. They had two clawed digits. 
 
 There is discussion as to whether it was a [[hunter]] or a [[scavenger]]. Like most dominant meat-eaters of today, such as [[lion]]s and [[hyena]]s, ''Tyrannosaurus'' might have been both. It had a very strong jaw, and its bite power could snap the bones of other dinosaurs.  
 
 The most famous [[species]] of tyrannosaurus is ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. More than 30 & nbsp;specimens have been found. Some of them are nearly complete skeletons, and soft tissue and [[protein]]s have been reported in at least one of these specimens. Research is done on its biology, life history and [[biomechanics]]. The feeding habits, [[physiology]] and potential speed of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' are some topics of debate. < ref > YouTube lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] by David Hone. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-jD7kQvyPs] < /ref >  Some scientists think  ''[[Tarbosaurus|Tarbosaurus bataar]]'' from Asia is a second species of ''Tyrannosaurus'', but others think ''Tarbosaurus'' is a separate genus. 
 
 ''Tyrannosaurus'' became [[extinct]] in the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]], which wiped out half of all [[species]] on [[Earth]]. 
 
 == Size == 
 The estimated size of this dinosaur has changed many times. Packard and colleagues tested dinosaur mass calculations on elephants. They decided that dinosaur estimations are flawed and produce results which were too high. Thus, the weight of ''Tyrannosaurus'' could be much less than usually estimated. < ref name= " " > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00594.x | author = Boardman T.J., Packard G.C., Birchard G.F. | year = 2009 | title = Allometric equations for predicting body mass of dinosaurs | url = | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 279 | issue = 1| pages = 102–110 }} < /ref >

 For a long time, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was the largest known ''carnivorous'' dinosaur. Recently, skeletons of other, slightly larger, carnivores have been found, such as ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]''. [[Skeleton]]s of ''Tyrannosaurus'' were found on the [[North America]]n [[continent]], but relatives, such as ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'', have been found in [[Asia]].

Some bones were fused, preventing movement between them; but many were [[pneumatized]], with a  " honeycomb "  of tiny air spaces. This may have made the bones more flexible as well as lighter.

 The tip of the upper jaw was U-shaped (most non-tyrannosauroid carnivores had V-shaped upper jaws), which increased the amount of tissue and bone a tyrannosaur could rip out with one bite, although it also increased the stresses on the front teeth. < ref name= " holtz2004 " > {{Cite book|editor=David B.

 == First discovery == 
 The earliest ''Tyrannosaurus'' skeletons were found in 1902 by Barnum Brown. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], named the species ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' (meaning  " tyrant lizard king " ) in 1905. The most complete skeleton was found in 1990 in [[South Dakota]] and named  " [[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]] "  after its finder, Susan Hendrickson. Several tyrannosaurids found later are also known by individual names.  
 
 ''Tyrannosaurus'' has become well known. Many movies and television shows have featured it, such as [[Jurassic Park]]. Its skeletons are popular exhibits in many museums.  
 
 == Jane == 
 [[File:Jane TRex Burpee.jpg|thumb|250px| " Jane "  at the Burpee Museum in Rockford, Illinois]] 
 
 '''Jane''' is a [[fossil]] specimen of a small tyrannosaurid. It is either ''[[Nanotyrannus]]'' or a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus''. The skeleton was found in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in southern [[Montana]] in 2001. < ref name=NIU > {{cite web |author= |title=NIU teams up with Burpee Museum to bring world's top dinosaur hunters to Rockford |date=7 September 2007 |url=http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2005/sept/dinosympsm.shtml |publisher=Northern Illinois University |accessdate=2007-09-09 |archive-date=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805122346/http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2005/sept/dinosympsm.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 It took experts four years to make the partial skeleton ready for a museum.  Jane went on display at [[Rockford, Illinois]] in the [[Burpee Museum of Natural History]]. Some paleontologists think Jane was a young tyrannosaurid, about 11 years old when she died. Jane is measured 6.5 metres (21.5 & nbsp;ft) long, about half as long as the largest known complete ''T. rex'' specimen, which is 13 & nbsp;m (42.6 & nbsp;ft) long. Experts think Jane weighed about 680 & nbsp;kg (1,500 & nbsp;lbs) when she was alive. Her large feet and long legs show she could perhaps run as fast as 20–30 miles per hour. Her lower jaw has 17 teeth.  Her teeth are curved and [[serration|serrated]]. 
 
 The scientists named her 'Jane' even though they do not know whether she was female.  She was named after Jane Solem, a person who helped the Burpee Museum. < ref > News Release: [http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2005/sept/dinosympsm.shtml NIU teams up with Burpee Museum to bring world's top dinosaur hunters to Rockford] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805122346/http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2005/sept/dinosympsm.shtml |date=2012-08-05 }} < /ref > 
 
 The Jane specimen has become part of an argument that scientists have.  The scientists disagree whether ''Nanotyrannus'' is really a separate genus of tyrannosaurids. Jane's skull is almost exactly the same as the skull of the original ''Nanotyrannus'' specimen, which means they are the same species.  The Burpee Museum held a conference in 2005.  Paleontologists came to the conference and talked about whether these  " pygmy tyrants "  were adults from a small tyrannosaurid species or young ''Tyrannosaurus rexes''. A few scientists thought they were adult small tyrannosaurids, < ref name= " larson2005 " > Larson 2005. A case for ''Nanotyrannus''.

 ==Scotty== 
 [[File:Scotty Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|280px|Scotty exhibited in Japan]]  
 In August 1991, Robert Gebhardt was a high school principal. He joined [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]] palaeontologists on a prospecting expedition. They went to the exposed [[bedrock]] along the Frenchman River Valley in southwest [[Saskatchewan]], Canada.  
 Gebhardt discovered the base of a  worn tooth, and a [[vertebra]] from the tail. Both looked like they belonged to a ''T. rex''.  
 
 In June 1994, RSM palaeontologists began excavating the ''T. rex''. The 66-million-year-old skeleton was the first ''T. rex'' skeleton found in Saskatchewan and one of only 12 known in the world at the time. '''Scotty''' is one of the largest and most complete skeletons with almost 70% of the skeleton found. A complete articulated cast of the skeleton was finally completed in 2012 and is now on display at its permanent home at the [[T.rex Discovery Centre]] in [[Eastend, Saskatchewan|Eastend]], Saskatchewan, Canada.  
 
 Scotty's skull has a scar from the eye socket to the nostril. That was probably caused by another T. rex or large carnivore that gripped Scotty's skull in its jaws. < ref > {{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=David|title=T-rex bones called find of giant significance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336 & dat=19940630 & id=0wkkAAAAIBAJ & sjid=uuwDAAAAIBAJ & pg=6824,7494892|accessdate=17 August 2014|work=p.

 Many people call it the  " king of the dinosaurs " .   
 
 ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' appears in many works of fiction and literature.  A ''T. rex'' is important in ''[[A Sound of Thunder]]'' by Ray Bradbury.  A ''T. rex'' is a big part of the novel ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s crew built a life-sized robot ''T. rex'' and a [[CGI]] ''T. rex'' for the movie version of ''[[Jurassic Park (movie)|Jurassic Park]]''. < ref name= " BI " > {{cite news|publisher=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-cgi-works-in-jurassic-park-2014-7|title=How 4 Minutes Of CGI Dinosaurs In 'Jurassic Park' Took A Year To Make|date=July 11, 2014|author1=Kirsten Acuna|accessdate=September 3, 2020}} < /ref > < ref name= " Times " > {{cite news|publisher=Animated Times|accessdate=September 3, 2020|url=https://www.animatedtimes.com/jurassic-park-10-hidden-details-about-the-movies-spielberg-hid-from-of-us/|author=Bibhu Prasdad Panda|title=Jurassic Park: 10 Hidden Details About the Movies Spielberg Hid From of Us|date=August 15, 2020}} < /ref >  Many other ''T. rexes'' have appeared in books, movies and [[animation|animated]] works. < ref name= " CG " > {{cite news|publisher=CG Magazine|url=https://www.cgmagonline.com/2015/02/09/best-fictional-t-rexes-time/|accessdate=September 3, 2020|title=The Best Fictional T-Rexes Of All Time|date=February 9, 2015|author=Brendan Quinn}} < /ref >
