 The '''Heterobranchs''' are a large group of [[snail]]s and [[slugs]]. The group includes [[Marine biology|marine]], [[aquatic]] and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[gastropod]] [[molluscs]]. 
 
 Heterobranchia is one of the main [[clades]] of gastropods. It has three informal groups:  < ref name= " Bouchet " > Bouchet P.  &  Rocroi J.-P. (eds) 2005.

 *Lower Heterobranchia: a group of rather specialized, highly evolved [[sea slugs]] and [[sea snails]]. 
 *Opisthobranchia: almost all are marine species, some shelled and some not. They are a group of slugs and snails with [[grinding]] [[gizzard]] plates.  
 *Pulmonata. This is a group which  is familiar to most people. It includes most land [[snails]] and [[slugs]], many freshwater snails and a few marine species. They breathe air, are [[hermaphrodite]], and usually have no operculum. < ref > The operculum is the hard section on the foot which closes up the shell so the animal is safe inside. < /ref >
