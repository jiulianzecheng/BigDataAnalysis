 '''Mammography''' is an [[x-ray]] of the [[breast]]. It is used to look for things that may be in a breast like a [[Neoplasm|tumor]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|date=2017-10-19|title=Nipple discharge|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nipple-discharge/|access-date=2023-07-08|website=National Health Service|language=en}} < /ref >  These images are viewed by [[Radiologist|radiologists]] for abnormal findings. A mammogram uses lower powered [[X-ray|x-rays]] when compared to x-rays of bones. Other tests are often used along with mammograms. These are [[ultrasound]], [[ductography]], [[positron emission mammography]] (PEM), and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography.
