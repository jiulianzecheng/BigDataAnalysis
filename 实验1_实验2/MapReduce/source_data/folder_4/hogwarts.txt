 ==Hogwarts houses== 
 ===Gryffindor=== 
 Gryffindor house was started by Godric Grand Gryffindor, from whom it gets the name. The house especially values [[courage]]. Its symbol (animal) is the lion and its colours are [[scarlet]] (red-purple) and yellow / [[gold]]ish yellow. Nearly Headless Nick is the house ghost. The Gryffindors always compete with the Slytherins. 
 
 The Gryffindor Common Room (the place where the Gryffindor students spend their time and do their homework) is in one of the castle's towers, at the seventh floor. At the door, there is the Fat Lady, or the Lady who is fat. She lets the students in only after they give her the password (which changes from the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year). The Fat Lady wears a blue dress. In the room there is a place with fire, many chairs and tables, and two pair of stairs which take the girls and boys to their sleeping rooms. 
 
 The head of Gryffindor house is Minerva McGonagall.
