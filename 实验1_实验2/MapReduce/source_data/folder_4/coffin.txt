 A '''coffin''' (also known as a '''casket''') is a [[box]] used to store [[corpse|dead bodies]], either for [[burial]] or after [[cremation]]. Coffins used after cremation are what is known as an [[urn]], where the ashes of the person are stored.  
 
 The word comes ultimately from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''kophinos'', a basket. In [[English language|English]], the word was not used in a [[funeral]] sense until the [[1500s]].  
 
 Any box used to bury the dead in is a coffin.  
 
 The main distinction between a coffin and a casket is the shape. A casket regularly has 6 â€“ 8 sides while coffins have a rectangular shape.  
 
 == Material and design == 
 Many coffins are made out of materials such as [[wood]], [[steel]] (which would have been used in [[Ancient Egypt]] < nowiki/ > ian sarcophaguses), and many others. These types of coffins, for example wooden ones can have a rectangular or any other design, whereas a steel or any other metal used in making coffins (or sarcophaguses) could have the exact same but include religious marking added to make it look more appealing.
