A '''claque''' (pronounce: ‘clack’) is a small group of people in an [[opera house]] who deliberately either clapped loudly ([[applause|applauded]]) or shouted [[boo]] for a particular singer. Usually it means an ''organised'' group who know in advance what they are going to do. 
 
 In the 19th century there was very often a claque at performances of an [[opera]]. Someone who liked one of the [[singer]]s and wanted them to have lots of applause would pay a group of people to sit near the back of the opera house and to clap and shout enthusiastically whenever that singer had finished a song. This would encourage the rest of the audience to clap loudly too. Sometimes the claque would be paid to do the opposite: they would be told to hiss and boo when the singer had sung. 
 
 Very often a singer would have to pay some money to the claque so that they would applaud him (or her). If the singer did not pay, the claque would hiss and boo. This was, of course, a nasty form of [[blackmail]]. In the early 20th century, when the world-famous [[tenor]] [[Enrico Caruso]] refused to pay the claque in [[Naples]] a [[bribe]], they hissed during his singing of the great [[aria]] ''Una furtiva lagrima''. 
 
 Groups of supporters at [[football]] ('soccer') matches do much the same thing without being paid. Abuse of match officials is also quite common. Abuse between rival groups of fans is also common. Clubs are required to keep away fans in different sections from home fans.
