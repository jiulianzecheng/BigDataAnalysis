 '''Magma''' is the melted [[mineral|rock]] under the ground. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Bowen|first=Norman L.|date=1947|title=Magmas|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_geological-society-of-america-bulletin_1947-04_58_4/page/263|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=58|issue=4|pages=263|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1947)58[263:M]2.0.CO;2|issn=0016-7606}} < /ref >  The liquid rock may have solid bits mixed in with it, and volcanic gas.   
 
 There are different types of magma. One is called [[felsic]] magma. Felsic magma is thick and has [[silica]] [[mineral]]s. It mostly makes light-coloured rocks. Another type is called [[mafic]] magma, which is runny and has less silica. It usually makes dark-coloured rocks. Magmas can be intermediate between both types.  
 
 Magma may become solid  by cooling slowly below the surface. This makes  " plutonic "  rocks such as [[granite]]. When magma comes out from the ground in a [[volcano]] it is called [[lava]]. Lava cools quickly, and forms other kinds of rock such as [[basalt]].  
 
 Magma is produced by melting of the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] or the [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. It happens at [[Tectonics|tectonic]] settings, such as [[subduction]] zones, continental [[rift (geology)|rift zone]]s, < ref name= " Foulger " > {{cite book|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html|title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy|author=Foulger, G.R.|publisher=Wiley–Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0}} < /ref >  [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].  
 
 Melted material from the mantle and crust moves up through the crust and collects  in [[magma chamber]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Detrick|first1=R.

 When they come up through the crust, magmas may feed a [[volcano]] and come out  as lava. But they may solidify underground to form an [[intrusion]] (magma which cools and becomes solid). < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal| last1=McBirney|first1=A.R.|last2=Noyes|first2=R.M. |date=1979-08-01|title=Crystallization and Layering of the Skaergaard Intrusion|url=https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/20/3/487/1515390|journal=Journal of Petrology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=487–554|doi=10.1093/petrology/20.3.487|bibcode=1979JPet...20..487M|issn=0022-3530}} < /ref >  Intrusions eventually cool down and become [[Dike (geology)|igneous dike]]s or  [[Sill (geology)|sill]]s.  
 
 The study of magma is usually done in lava flows. However, magma was found under the ground three times in [[Geothermal energy|geothermal drilling projects]] & mdash;twice in Iceland and once in Hawaii. < ref > [https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/scientists-drill-hits-magma-only-third-time-record/ Scientists' Drill Hits Magma: Only Third Time on Record], UC Davis News and Information, June 26, 2009. < /ref > < ref > [http://www.physorg.com/news148664988.html Magma Discovered in Situ for First Time].
