 An '''exhibition''' is an organized event in which a collection of special objects can be viewed by the public. The objects are often brought together from many places for the period of the exhibition. The objects on show are called '''exhibits'''. 
 
 [[Museum]]s often organize special exhibitions, such as paintings by a famous painter. These paintings will mostly be “on loan”, i.e. specially borrowed from other museums. Exhibitions can be about anything. They may be to do with [[art]], or they can also be [[science]] exhibitions. 
 
 Some exhibitions show things which can be bought. [[Company|Firms]] exhibit the things they have made, hoping to encourage [[business]]. These exhibitions are called [[trade fair]]s. They are sometimes called '''expositions''' or '''expos'''.  They may be open to the public, but others are just for invited [[business people]].
