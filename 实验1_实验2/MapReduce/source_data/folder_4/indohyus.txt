 [[File:Mystice pelvis (whale).png|250px|thumb|right|Some modern whales have traces of their land-dwelling ancestors. The skeleton of a [[Bowhead whale]] shows its hind limb and pelvic bone structure (circled in red). This bone structure stays inside its body its entire life: it is a [[vestigial structure]].]] 
 
 '''''Indohyus''''' (meaning  " [[India]]'s [[pig]] " ) is a small [[deer]]-like creature, which lived about 49 or 48 million years ago in [[Kashmir]], [[India]]. It belongs to the artiodactyls family ''[[Raoellidae]]'', and is believed to be the closest sister group of [[Cetacea]]. It lived during the same time as the related ''[[Pakicetus]]''. The two may have coexisted. 
 
 About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this [[herbivorous]] creature shared some of the [[Trait (biology)|traits]] of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, < ref name=science_news_3 > {{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/02/050205103109.htm| title = UC Berkeley: French scientists find missing link between the whale and its closest relative, the hippo| access-date = 2007-12-21| author = University Of California, Berkeley (2005)| publisher = ScienceDaily

This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African [[mousedeer]] or [[water chevrotain]] which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes. < ref name=TheLoom > {{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/12/19/whales_from_so_humble_a_beginn.php |title=The loom: whales: from so humble a beginning. |access-date=2007-12-21 |author=Carl Zimmer |author-link=Carl Zimmer |date=2007 |publisher=ScienceBlogs |archive-date=2007-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221103928/http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2007/12/19/whales_from_so_humble_a_beginn.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=GuardianIndohyus  > {{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/dec/19/whale.deer?gusrc=rss & feed=networkfront |title=Whales may be descended from a small deer-like animal | access-date=2007-12-21 |author=Ian Sample |date=2007 |publisher=Guardian Unlimited }} < /ref > < ref name=PharyngulaIndohyus > {{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/12/indohyus.php |title=Pharyngula: Indohyus |access-date=2007-12-21 |author=Myers P.Z. |date=2007 |work=Pharyngula |publisher=ScienceBlogs |archive-date=2007-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220115757/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/12/indohyus.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
