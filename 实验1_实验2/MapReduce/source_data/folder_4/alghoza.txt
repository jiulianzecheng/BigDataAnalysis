 This musical grouping first happened around 7500 BC in [[Mesopotamia]]. Then it reached [[Iran]] and eventually [[Pakistan]]. It had some changes on the way. < ref name= " Dawn "  / >  Some old Mesopotamian paintings show a musical instrument very similar to Alghoza. < ref name= " Dawn "  / > 
 
 In Mesopotamia, this instrument was called  " Al-Joza " , which literally means,  " the twin " . < ref name= " Dawn "  / >  As it reached [[Pakistan]], the  " J "  in  " Al-Joza "  became  " gh "  and eventually the modified form of this instrument which reached Pakistan came to be known as Alghoza. < ref name= " Dawn "  / > 
 
 The Alghoza (Sindhi: الغوزو‎) is a paired woodwind instrument. It is traditionally used by Baloch, Saraiki, Sindhi, Kutchi, Punjabi and Rajasthani folk musicians. It consists of two joined beak flutes, one for melody, the second for drone. The flutes are either tied together or may be held together loosely with the hands.
