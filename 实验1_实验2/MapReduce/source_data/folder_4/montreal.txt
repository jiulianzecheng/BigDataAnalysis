 '''Montreal''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ʌ|n|t|r|i|ˈ|ɔː|l}}, spelled ''Montréal'' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[city]] in the country of [[Canada]]. It is the largest city in the [[province]] of [[Quebec]] and the second-largest city in Canada. It is the second-largest [[French language|French-speaking]] city in the world after [[Paris]]. 
 
 Montreal is built on an island sitting in the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. More than three million people live in the Montreal region. At the centre of Montreal is a mountain called [[Mount Royal]]. The suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] is a very rich suburb on the island of Montreal. 
 
 Most of the people who live in Montreal speak [[French language|French]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The name 'Montréal' comes from ''Mont Royal'', which means 'Royal Mountain' in [[French language|French]]. It was originally called ''Ville-Marie'', or City of Mary. 
 
 Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada. It continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial centre, as well as a major seaport (via the Saint Lawrence River). It once was the largest city in Canada, before [[Toronto]] grew to be larger. 
 
 Tourists visit Montreal for its historical and cultural interest. One can visit the Old City in horse-drawn carriages, where many buildings from the earliest years stand and remind of the way of life that started in the [[New World]], when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to [[France]] over 350 years ago. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Montreal is in the southwest of [[Quebec]], 530 [[kilometres]] north of [[New York City]]. The city itself is located on an [[island]], the Island of Montreal. Near the downtown area, there is a hill called ''Mount Royal'' (''Mont Royal'' in French). 
 
 == Economy == 
 [[File:TourDeLaBourse night.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The [[stock exchange]] tower in downtown Montreal]] 
 Montreal's [[economy]] is the second largest in [[Canada]]. The city's [[port]] is the biggest inland port (a port that is not on the [[sea]]) in the world. Many large corporations have their main offices in Montreal. It also hosts many international organizations like [[ICAO]], the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], and [[IATA]]. The city is home to four major [[university|Universities]], welcoming students from all parts of Canada and from all over the world. 
 
 Montreal is also known for its [[culture|cultural]] production sector. Because the city has many different buildings, [[movie]]s are easy to film there. The [[circus]] troupe (group) ''Cirque du Soleil'' is from Montreal. The city is also known for its festivals, like the Montreal Jazz Festival and ''Just For Laughs''. 
 
 Some [[video game]] companies like [[Ubisoft Montreal|Ubisoft]] also have studios in Montreal. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2023-07-17|title=Home|url=https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/|access-date=2023-08-11|website=Ubisoft Montréal|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Culture == 
 [[File:CentrevilleMontrealété.jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown area seen from across the Saint Lawrence River]] 
 
 Montreal is the cultural capital of Quebec and French-speaking Canada.  
 Montreal has many beautiful [[Church (building)|church]]es (Montreal is referred to locally as 'the city of a hundred churches'), including the largest church in Canada, and also many important art, history, and science museums. You can also visit the location of the 1967 [[World's Fair]], where today, as well as many other attractions, one will find the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve [[Formula One]] automobile race course. Also of interest is the site where the 1976 Summer [[Olympic Games]] were held, and the modern architecture of the Olympic stadium (the 'Big O') and its tall inclined observation tower (the highest inclined tower in the world); now a landmark of Montreal.
