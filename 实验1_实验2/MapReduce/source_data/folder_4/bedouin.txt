 '''Bedouins''' are an [[Arab]] ethnocultural group. They are descended from [[nomad]]s who lived in the [[Arabian Desert|Arabian]], [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Sahara |Saharan Deserts]]. < ref > Losleben, Elizabeth 2003.

 They call themselves the ''people of the tent'', because they travelled around, living in tents. Bedouin were camel raisers and drivers, sheep and goat nomads, cattle driving nomads, and [[merchant]]s. Today many Bedouin have given up the nomadic life and live and work in towns. The Bedouin are the original Breeders of the [[Arabian]] Horse.
