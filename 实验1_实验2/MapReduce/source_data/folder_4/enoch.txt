 == Enoch in the Book of Genesis == 
 Enoch is first mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] as the seventh of the ten [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] who lived before the flood; each patriarch lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 gives us a [[genealogy]] of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), giving us information on the age at which each fathered the next and the age of each figure when they died. But for Enoch, he is an exception; he did  " not see death "  ({{Bibleref2|Hebrews|11:5|9}}). {{bibleverse||Genesis|5:22–24|HE}} says that Enoch lived for 365 years, which is shorter than any other patriarch who lived before the flood; they are all said to be dying at over 700 years of age. The account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that  " he was not; for God took him " . < ref > Genesis 5:24, KJV < /ref >  This happened 57 years after Adam's death and 69 years before Noah's birth. 
 
 === Enoch and Enmeduranki === 
 [[Enmeduranki]] was an ancient [[Sumerians|Sumerian]] king who is said to have been a Mesopotamian model for Enoch, he lived before the ancient Egyptian dynasties ruling from about 3400 BC. Enmeduranki appears as the seventh name on the Sumerian King List, whereas Enoch is the seventh figure on the list of patriarchs in Genesis. Both of them were also said to have been taken up into heaven. [[Sippar]], the city of Enmeduranki, has been said to be connected with sun worship, while the 365 years that Enoch is said to have lived may have formed the number of days in the [[solar calendar]]. < ref > John Day (2021), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gIpFEAAAQBAJ & pg=PA106 From Creation to Abraham: Further Studies in Genesis 1-11.] Bloomsbury Publishing. p.106 < /ref >

 === New Testament === 
 The New Testament mentions Enoch three times. 
 
 * The first mention is in the genealogy of Jesus in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. (Luke 3:37). 
 * The second mention is in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] which says,  " By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. "  (Hebrews 11:5 KJV). This means that he did not experience the mortal death which  Adam's other descendants experienced, which makes sense with Genesis 5:24 KJV, as it says,  " And Enoch walked with God: and he ''[was]'' not; for God took him. " 
 * The third mention is in the [[Epistle of Jude]] (1:14–15) where the author writes {{Blockquote|text= " And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. " }} This passage is not found in Catholic and Protestant canons of the Old Testament. The verses is believed by most modern scholars to be taken from 1 Enoch 1:9 which exists in Greek, in Ge'ez (as part of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] canon), and also in Aramaic among the [[Dead Sea scrolls|Dead Sea Scrolls]]. < ref > 4Q Enoch (4Q204[4QENAR]) COL I 16–18 < /ref > < ref > Clontz, T.E. and J.,  " The Comprehensive New Testament with complete textual variant mapping and references for the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Nag Hammadi Library, Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha, Plato, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Talmud, Old Testament, Patristic Writings, Dhammapada, Tacitus, Epic of Gilgamesh " , Cornerstone Publications, 2008, p. 711, {{ISBN|978-0-9778737-1-5}} < /ref >  Though the same scholars themselves already know that 1 Enoch 1:9 itself is just a [[midrash]] of Deuteronomy 33:2. < ref > " The initial oracle in chapters 1–5 is a paraphrase of part of Deuteronomy 33,24 "  George W.
