 '''''Araucaria''''' is a [[genus]] of [[evergreen]] [[Conifer|coniferous]] [[trees]] in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. There are 19 [[species]] in the genus, with a scattered distribution in the southern continents. They are found in [[New Caledonia]] (where 13 species are endemic), Norfolk Island, eastern [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and southern [[Brazil]]. 
 
 The present populations are relicts, and of restricted distribution. They are found in [[forest]] and [[shrubland]], in exposed sites. These tall trees are [[living fossil]]s, dating back to early in the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]].  
 
 Fossil records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. By far the greatest diversity exists in New Caledonia, due to the island's long isolation and stability. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Araucaria'' are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem, reaching a height of 30–80 m (16–262 ft). The horizontal, spreading branches grow in [[whorl]]s and are covered with leathery or needle-like leaves. In some species, the [[Leaf|leaves]] are narrow and shaped like a lance, barely overlapping each other, in others they are broad and flat, and overlap broadly. 
 
 ''Aurucaria'' reproduces by [[Seed cone|seed cones]].

 The whole group was common in the [[Jurassic]] period. The living ''Araucaria araucana'' is often called the '''monkey-puzzle tree'''. The whole family '''Araucariaceae''' is often called that name by palaeobotanists. The leaves (shown here) have an average life of 24 years, < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Lusk|first1=Christopher H.|title=Leaf life spans of some conifers of the temperate forests of South America|journal=Revista Chilena de Historia Natural|date=2001|volume=74|issue=3|pages=711–718|doi=10.4067/S0716-078X2001000300017|url=http://rchn.biologiachile.cl/pdfs/2001/3/Lusk_2001.pdf|access-date=6 November 2017}} < /ref >  and cover most of the tree except for the older branches.
