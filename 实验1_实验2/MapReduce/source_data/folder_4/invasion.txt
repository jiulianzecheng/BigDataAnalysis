 '''Invasion''' is a word that comes from [[Latin]]. Originally, it meant that something ''goes in'' (as in [[military occupation]]) of a foreign [[territory]]. So far, the following uses are known: 
 
 * ''Military'': Getting [[soldier|troops]] to take control of enemy territory. Often a [[state]] invades another to start a war, but invasions can happen anytime during war. An invasion differs from a [[raid]], in which the attacker does not intend to remain. 
 * ''Others'': Sometimes, [[biologist]]s speak about an [[invasive species]]. There might be [[locust]] [[swarm]]s invading, or that some algae spread far more rapidly in new territory.
