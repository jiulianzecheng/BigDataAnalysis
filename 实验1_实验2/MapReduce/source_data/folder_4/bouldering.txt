'''Bouldering''' is a type of [[rock climbing]]. Bouldering comes without gear, belayer, and associated distractions. As such, it allows a climber to focus completely on the terrain and their movement. It is climbing heights at which the climber does not usually suffer serious injuries in case of a drop. To protect from injuries there are usually special [[bouldering mat]]s underneath the climber. It is usually practiced on large natural [[boulder]]s and in [[climbing gym]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Neyer|first=Eric|title=Bouldering: What Is It and How To Start?

 ==Bouldering basics== 
 Boulder routes are called  " problems " , because this style is like solving climbing-problems. The height of boulder problems is rarely higher than {{convert|3|-|5|m|abbr=off}}. Otherwise the risk of injuries is too high. Often other climbers, who stand on the ground, spot the climbers to protect them from hitting the ground with the [[head]] or the [[spine]]. 
 
 ==Equipment== 
 The equipment used by boulderers is not much. They use special [[climbing shoes]], a [[bouldering mat]], some [[brush]]es to clean the grips and sports tape. 
 
 ==History== 
 Bouldering was invented in the late 19th century. It has been first documented in [[France]], [[England]] and [[Switzerland]]. It has been practiced for a long time but in the 1930s and 1940s it was practiced for its own sake in [[Fontainebleau]] in France. 
 
 Today many rock climbers are specialized boulderers and it is their favourite style of climbing.
