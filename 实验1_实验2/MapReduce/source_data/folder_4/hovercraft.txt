 A '''hovercraft''' is a [[vehicle]] supported and moved by a cushion of [[air]] blowing downwards. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/n27 18]}} < /ref >  They are used on [[water]], [[land]], [[ice]] and other areas where the [[surface]] is smooth. A difference in air pressure between the ship and the atmosphere creates lift, causing the hovercraft to float above the surface it is set on, allowing it to ride on different surfaces. They are often used as [[ferry|ferries]] and by [[military|militaries]] for amphibious, or on water and on land (like an [[amphibian]] can live in water and land) missions. A hovercraft can move cargo, people, and cars.
