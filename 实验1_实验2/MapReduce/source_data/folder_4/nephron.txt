 '''Nephrons''' are tiny tubules (miniature tubes) which are the smallest working part of the [[kidney]]. This is where the kidney removes waste, excess salt and excess water.  
 
 Each nephron starts in the [[cortex]] of the kidney, then goes into the [[medulla]] of the kidney, before coming back to the cortex, then goes through the medulla into the pelvis of the kidney. In the pelvis, the nephrons join up with the [[ureter]]. < ref > p160,''' '''Biology, ''Mary Jones and Geoff Jones, ''2002 edition, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-45618-5}} < /ref > 
 
 In humans, a normal kidney has between 800,000 and 1.5 million nephrons. < ref name= " guyton11 " > {{Cite book | author=Guyton, Arthur C.; Hall, John E. | authorlink= | title=Textbook of Medical Physiology | year=2006 | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-7216-0240-1 | pages=310}} < /ref > 
 
 Each nephron consists of a cup-shaped structure at one end called the Bowman's capsule. It extends into a long urinary tubule,that is surrounded by a network of renal capillaries. The urinary tubules of nephrons in each kidney join to form a common tube called the ureter. 
 
 Inside the Bowman's capsule is a network of blood capillaries, the ''glomerulus''. The Bowman's capsule and glomerulus together form the Malphigian capsule or Malphigian body. 
 
 Liquid passes through the segments of the nephron in this order: 
 #Bowman's capsule (including glomerulus) 
 #Proximal convoluted tubule 
 #Descending loop of Henle 
 #Ascending loop of Henle 
 #Distal convoluted tubule 
 #Collecting duct
