 '''Empedocles'''  < ref > {{lang-el|Ἐμπεδοκλῆς}}, ca. 490–430 BC < /ref >  was a Greek pre-Socratic [[philosopher]] who lived in Agrigentum, a Greek colony in [[Sicily]].  
 
 Empedocles' philosophy is best known for being the origin of the cosmogenic theory of the four [[classical elements]] in the Western world. He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements.  
 
 Influenced by the [[Pythagoreans]], he supported the doctrine of [[reincarnation]]. Empedocles was perhaps the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]. Some of his work still survives today, more so than in the case of any other [[Presocratic]] philosopher. Empedocles' death was mythologized by ancient writers, and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments.
