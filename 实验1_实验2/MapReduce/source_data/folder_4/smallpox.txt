 '''Smallpox''' was a dangerous [[disease]] with a high [[mortality rate]]. It no longer exists as an [[epidemic]] disease. < ref >  Bazin H. 2000. ''The eradication of smallpox: Edward Jenner and the first and only eradication of a human infectious disease''. Academic Press. ISBN 978-0-12-083475-4 < /ref >  The last naturally occurring case was diagnosed in October 1977. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) certified the [[Eradication of infectious diseases|global eradication]] of the disease in 1980 (said there was no more). < ref name=WHO2007Fact > {{cite web | title=Smallpox | work=WHO Factsheet | url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921235036/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/ | archive-date = 21 September 2007 }} < /ref > 
 
 It was caused by a [[virus]]. There are two different [[species]] of viruses that can cause the disease. They are ''Variola major'' and ''Variola minor''. Some people also call smallpox '''Variola''', from the Latin work for  " spotted "  which is also the viruses' [[Taxonomy|scientific name]]. 
 
 Only [[human]]s can get this disease, but it probably came from a virus which infected animals. ''Variola major'' killed between 20% and 40% of those who got it. ''Variola minor'' killed only about 1%. Many people who survived become [[blindness|blind]] because of the damage the virus did to the [[eye]]s. < ref > [http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/smallpox/DS00424.html CNN.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001032152/http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/smallpox/DS00424.html |date=2012-10-01 }}.

 During the first half of the [[20th century]], between 300 million and 500 million people died of this disease. Even in 1967, about 15 million people caught the disease, and about two million people died of it, according to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). 
 
 The first [[vaccine]] for smallpox used the results of [[cowpox]] infections. It was invented by [[Edward Jenner]]. It was used to stop people from getting smallpox.  The word  " vaccine "  came from  " vaccina " , the [[Latin]] word for [[cow]], because cowpox was used. The [[WHO]] (World Health Organisation) [[vaccine|vaccinated]] people all over the world. In 1980, the WHO said the disease no longer existed, < ref > [http://www.who.int/topics/smallpox/en WHO smallpox FAQ] < /ref >  and no one would ever get sick from it again. Live copies of smallpox are kept in maximum-security laboratories around the world to make sure the disease can never infect people again. 
 
 Some people believe that smallpox could be used as an agent for [[biological warfare|purposely infecting]] enemies in a war. Today, most people no longer receive a smallpox shot.
