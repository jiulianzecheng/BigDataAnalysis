 A '''legume''' is a type of dry [[fruit]]. It is usually produced by plants in the family [[Fabaceae]]. Legumes can be a variety of fruits: [[pea]]s and [[bean]]s are types of legumes. 
 
 == Description == 
 Legumes grow from the [[carpel]], the female reproductive part of a [[plant]]. The fruit of a legume is found inside a pod that can be split on both sides. However, there are some foods that grow inside pods that are not legumes.

 == Health == 
 Legumes contain many healthy nutrients, such as [[protein]]. They are a good source of protein for [[vegetarian]]s and [[vegan]]s, or people who do not eat meat and fish. They also contain [[fibre]]. This helps to have a healthy [[digestive system]]. However, they contain some nutrients which humans find difficult to digest. It is recommended that legumes are soaked (left in water) before cooking to help with nutrient absorption (taking in more nutrients). < ref > {{cite journal|last=Sandberg|first=Ann-Sofie|title=Bioavailability of minerals in legumes|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|year=2002|volume=88|pages=Suppl. 3, S281â€“S285|doi=10.1079/BJN/2002718|pmid=12498628|s2cid=5942232|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FBJN88_S3%2FS000711450200257Xa.pdf & code=0af4a50bd3be34211339879b90c07d0c|accessdate=22 February 2016}} < /ref >  Some [[amino acid]]s, such as [[methionine]], are not found very much in some legumes. However, they are needed to help the body use protein. 
 
 == Use == 
 [[India]] imports (buys from other countries) the most legumes. This may be because a lot of Indians follow the [[religion]] of [[Hinduism]], which does not let people eat meat. Legumes are a cheap and plentiful source of food in a country where around 22% of the population are in [[poverty]]. The top four producers and exporters (selling to other countries) of legumes are: 
 *[[Canada]] 
 *[[Myanmar]] 
 *[[Australia]] 
 *[[USA]] 
 The USA uses legumes for a variety of reasons. It is the highest producer. It uses [[Soybean|soybeans]] to feed [[cattle]] and make [[vegetable oil]]. [[Peanut]]s are a popular snack food in the USA and these are also a type of legume.
