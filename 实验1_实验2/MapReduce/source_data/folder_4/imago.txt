 In [[entomology]], the '''imago''' is the last stage in the development of an [[insect]]. In an incomplete [[metamorphosis]] it comes after the last [[ecdysis]]. < ref > Sloughing off of epicuticle or [[exoskeleton]] during larval growth. < /ref >  If the metamorphosis is complete, it comes after emergence from the [[pupa]]. This is the only stage where the insect is [[sex]]ually mature and (if a winged species) has functional wings. The imago is often referred to as the ''adult stage''.
