 == History == 
 
 The Roman Pannonia lasted from [[Augustus]]' times until the [[5th century|fifth century.]]  
 
 In the second century Pannonia flourished and received many Roman citizens, who developed a rich farm economy. 
 
 It was temporarily  increased under emperor [[Constantine the Great]] up to the actual [[Romania|Romanian]] mountains. The border was the so called  " Devil's Dike " . 
 
 When [[Attila]] attacked the area was destroyed and depopulated. 
 
 After the fall of the western Roman Empire, in Pannonia, the latinized population developed the [[Pannonian Romance]]. That lasted until the [[10th century|tenth century]].
