'''Hexameter''' is a [[line (poetry)|metrical line]] of [[verse]]. It is usually made of six parts, called [[metrical foot|feet]]. It is the standard verse form used in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] [[literature]]. The [[Iliad]] and [[Aeneid]] use it, and so do [[Ovid]]'s [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]. English poetry rarely uses hexameter.

 == Dactylic hexameter == 
 [[File:Dactyl like a finger vectorial.svg|thumb|right|300px|A [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] is like a finger, having one long syllable followed by two short syllables.]] 
 
 The meter consists of lines made from six ( " hex " ) [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]. In strict '''dactylic hexameter''', each of these feet would be a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]], but classical meter allows for the substitution of a [[spondee]] (two long syllables) in place of a dactyl in most positions. Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is frequently a dactyl (around 95% of the time in [[Homer]]).  
 
 Because of the strong pause at the end of the line, it is traditionally regarded as a spondee. Thus the dactylic line most normally looks as follows: 
 
 :— U | — U | — U | — U | — u u | — X 
 (note that ''—'' is a [[long syllable]], ''u'' a short syllable and ''U'' either one long or two shorts and X anceps syllable) 
 
 As in all classical verse forms, the last [[syllable]] can actually be short or long.
