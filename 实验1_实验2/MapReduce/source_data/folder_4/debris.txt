'''Debris''' in a general sense means man-made [[waste|garbage]]. Debris is the scattered remains of something that is discarded or destroyed. There are many types of debris, depending on the context. When [[natural disaster]]s happen, debris is the remains of destroyed buildings and land. In the context of [[geology]], debris is the remains of geological activity such as [[landslide]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], [[avalanche]]s, and so on. 
 
 The average American produces garbage, also called [[trash]], at the rate of four pounds per day per person, which translates to 600,000 tons per day, or about 220 million tons per year. This is almost twice the rate of trash [[generation]] per person as most other major countries. Trash levels can be reduced primarily by [[recycling]], re-use, and reduced [[consumerism|consumption]].
