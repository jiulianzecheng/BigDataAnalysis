'''Preschool''' is a term for early [[childhood]] [[education]]. It is education for very young children between the ages of three and six, before the start of [[compulsory education]] at [[elementary school]]/[[primary school]]. There are theories of [[child development]] which influence preschool activities, with the ideas of [[Jean Piaget]] that categorise this age group as a “preoperational” stage of development being the most influential. 
 
 In [[Europe]] the terms '[[nursery]]' and '[[kindergarten]]' are used to describe preschooling.
