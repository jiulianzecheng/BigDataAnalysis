'''Cattistock''' is a village in west [[Dorset]], [[England]], in the upper reaches of the Frome Valley eight miles north west of [[Dorchester]]. The village has a [[population]] of 440 (2002). 
 
 The church was rebuilt in the 19th century, by architects [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] and his son George Gilbert Scott Junior. The Perpendicular-styled tower was the work of the latter, and has led to the church being called the 'Cathedral of the Frome Valley'. < ref > Betjeman, John, ed.
