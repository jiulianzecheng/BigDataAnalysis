 In order to be able to work together, people and companies need to agree on a common set of [[Rule|rules]], and [[Unit of measurement|units]]. These agreements are called [[Standard|standards]]. The process of agreeing is called '''standardization''' or '''standardisation'''.  
 
 Companies that have products which follow these rules can make their products work together.  One example of a standard is the two pin plug. It provides [[electricity]]. It is commonly found in household appliances. Many countries have adopted it. However, this is not the case for three-pin plugs: they are different in each country.   
 
 Agreements do not need to be technical. Lawyers can agree on a standard way to solve a problem, linguists can agree on what the  " standard language "  is, and bookkeepers can agree on rules how to evaluate a company.
