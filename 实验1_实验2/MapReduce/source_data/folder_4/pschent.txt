[[Image:Double crown.svg|thumb|Pschent, the double crown of Egypt]] 
 The '''Pschent''' was the name of the Double [[Crown]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The Ancient Egyptians called it '''[[sekhem scepter|''sekhemti'']]'''  meaning the Two Powerful Ones. < ref > Griffith, Francis Llewellyn, ''A Collection of Hieroglyphs: A Contribution to the History of Egyptian Writing'', the Egypt Exploration Fund 1898, p.56 < /ref >  The Pschent was made from the [[Deshret|Red Deshret Crown]] of [[Lower Egypt]] and the [[Hedjet|White Hedjet Crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. 
 
 The Pschent was a [[symbol]] of the [[pharaoh]]'s power over all Egypt. < ref > Dunand, Françoise; Christiane Zivie-Coche, ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', Cornell University Press 2004, pp.32f. < /ref >  The design used two animals, a cobra and a vulture.  The [[Egyptian cobra]], known as the [[uraeus]], ready to strike, was a symbol for the Lower Egyptian goddess [[Wadjet]]. The [[Egyptian vulture]] was a symbol for the Upper Egyptian goddess [[Nekhbet]]. These were placed on the front of the Pschent and called the ''[[Two Ladies]]''.

 The [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] pharaoh [[Menes]] is said to have invented the Pschent. The first pharoah to be shown wearing the Double Crown was [[Djet]], in a rock inscription showing his [[Horus]] wearing it. < ref > Wilkinson, Toby A. H., ''Early Dynastic Egypt'',  Routledge 1999, p.196 < /ref >

[[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic rulers]] only wore the Pschent in Egypt. They wore the [[diadem]] in the other territories]] 
 
 The list of kings on the [[Palermo Stone]] shows the Lower Egyptian pharaohs wearing the Red Crown. After Egypt is unified, the list shows all First Dynasty and later pharaohs wearing the Pschent. < ref > Fage, John Donnelly; Desmond J. Clark, Roland Anthony Oliver, A. D. Roberts, ''The Cambridge History of Africa " , Cambridge University Press 1974, p.521 < /ref >  But the Cairo fragment, shows Lower Egyptian rulers wearing the Pschent. < ref > Kemp, Barry John, ''Ancient Egypt: Anatomy Of A Civilization'', Routledge 2006, p.92 < /ref > 
 
 ==Archaeology== 
 None of the Egyptian crowns have survived (or been found yet). Like the Deshret and the Hedjet Crowns, the Pschent is known only from statues, paintings, inscriptions, and ancient stories. 
 
 ==Mythology== 
 Among the gods shown wearing the Double Crown are Horus < ref > Zandee, Jan, ''Studies in Egyptian Religion: Dedicated to Professor Jan Zandee'', Brill 1982, p.74 < /ref >  and [[Atum]]. These both [[wikt:represent|represented]] the pharaoh or had a special relationship to the pharaoh. < ref > ''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica'', [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], Inc. 2005, p. 689 < /ref >
