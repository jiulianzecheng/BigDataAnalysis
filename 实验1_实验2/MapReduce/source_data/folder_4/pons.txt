[[File:Gray768.png|thumb|right|300px|Section of the brain showing the position of the pons]] 
 
 The '''pons''' is part of the [[hindbrain]], the ancient rear part of the [[brain]]. It acts as a bridge, and has [[nerve fibre]]s connecting the [[cerebellum]] to the [[medulla oblongata]]. In humans it is above the medulla and below the [[midbrain]]. 
 
 Mainly, its function is to carry [[white matter|white fibres]] ( " wiring " ) which conduct signals from the [[cerebrum]] down to the cerebellum and medulla, and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the [[thalamus]].
