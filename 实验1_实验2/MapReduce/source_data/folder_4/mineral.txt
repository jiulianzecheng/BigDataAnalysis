 '''Minerals''' are [[substance]]s that are formed naturally in the [[Earth]]. Minerals vary in composition, from pure [[elements]] and simple [[salt]]s to very complex [[silicate]]s with [[thousand]]s of known forms. In [[wikt:contrast|contrast]], a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] sample is a random [[wikt:aggregate|aggregate]] of minerals and/or mineraloids, and has no specific [[chemical]] composition. Most of the rocks of the [[Earth's crust]] have [[quartz]] (crystalline SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ), feldspar, mica, chlorite, kaolin, calcite, epidote, [[olivine]], [[augite]], hornblende, magnetite, [[hematite]], [[limonite]] and a few other minerals. Some minerals, like [[quartz]], mica or [[feldspar]] are common, while others have been found in only a few places in the [[world]]. The largest group of minerals by far is the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]] (most rocks are ≥95% silicates), which are made largely of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]], also with ions of [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]] and other metals. 
 
 [[Rock (geology)|Rocks]] are made of minerals. Minerals are usually [[solid]], [[Inorganic matter|inorganic]], have a [[crystal]] structure, and form naturally by geological processes. < ref name= " Railsback " > L.B.

 A mineral can be made of single [[chemical element]] or more usually a [[Chemical compound|compound]]. There are over 4,000 types of known minerals. < ref name=IMA > International Mineralogical Association [http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/IMA2009-01%20UPDATE%20160309.pdf IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626060238/http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/IMA2009-01 |date=2013-06-26 }} (PDF 1.8 & nbsp;MB;) < /ref >  Two common minerals are [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. 
 
 == Characteristics of minerals == 
 [[File:Labradorite detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Labradorite [[feldspar]] displaying typical labradorescence]] 
 A mineral is a substance that usually 
 * is an [[Inorganic matter|inorganic]] [[solid]]. (elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]] is an exception) < ref name=IMA/ > < sup > p184 < /sup > < ref > [http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ima/ima98%2804%29.pdf Minsocam] < /ref > 
 * Has a definite [[chemical]] make-up 
 * usually has a [[crystal]] structure; some do not 
 * is formed naturally by geological processes 
 
 One recent definition is: 
 : " A mineral is a [[homogeneous]] (which means composed of parts or elements that are all of the same kind) naturally occurring substance with a definite but not necessarily fixed chemical composition. Most minerals are solids with an ordered atomic arrangement, and most are inorganic in the chemical sense of that word " . < ref name= Railsback/ > 
 Alternatively, a mineral is one listed as such by the International Mineralogical Association. < ref name=IMA/ > 
 
 === Minerals and rocks === 
 Minerals are different from [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. A mineral is a chemical compound with a given composition and a defined crystal structure. < ref > Levin H. 2006. ''The Earth through time''. 8th ed, Wiley. p48: Minerals and their properties. < /ref >  A rock is a [[mixture]] of one or several minerals, in varying proportions. 
 
 A rock has only two of the characteristics minerals have–it is a solid and it forms naturally. A rock usually contains two or more types of minerals. Two samples of the same type of rock may have different kinds of minerals in them. Minerals are always made up of the same materials in nearly the same proportions. A [[ruby]] is a mineral. Therefore, a ruby found in India has similar makeup as a ruby found in [[Australia]]. 
 
 === Formed in nature === 
 Minerals are formed by natural processes. A few substances with the same chemical composition as minerals can be produced by living creatures as part of their shells or bones. The [[Animal shell|shells]] of [[mollusc]]s are composed of either [[calcite]] or [[aragonite]], or both. 
 
 Traditionally, chemicals produced by living things are not considered minerals. However, it is difficult to see why an organic substance should not be called a mineral if its chemical nature ''and'' its [[crystalline]] structure is identical with its inorganic twin. This issue is now under debate: see Railsback part II. < ref name=Railsback/ >

 Minerals form in many ways. The mineral [[halite]], which is used as table salt, forms when water [[evaporate]]s in a hot, shallow part of the ocean, leaving behind the salt it contained. Many types of minerals are made when molten rock, or [[magma]] cools and turns into a solid. Talc, a mineral that can be used to make baby powder, forms deep in Earth as high pressure and temperature causes changes in solid rock. 
 
 The extraordinary thing is, that most minerals owe their formation to life, or at least to the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].  " Sturdy minerals rather than fragile organic remains may provide the most robust and lasting signs of biology " . < ref > Hazen, Robert M. Evolution of minerals: looking at the mineral kingdom through the lens of deep time leads to a startling conclusion: most mineral species owe their existence to life. ''Scientific American'', March 2010. < /ref > < ref > Rosing, Minik T. 2008. On the evolution of minerals. ''Nature'' '''456''' p457. < /ref > 
 
 === Solid === 
 [[File:Corundum-53802.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Corundum]]]] 
 A mineral is a solid—that is, it has a definite volume and a rough shape. Volume refers to the amount of space an object takes up. For example, a golf ball has a smaller volume than a baseball, and a baseball has a smaller volume than a basketball. 
 
 A substance that is a liquid or a gas is not a mineral. However, in some cases its solid form is a mineral. For instance, liquid water is not a mineral, but ice is. 
 
 === Definite chemical makeup === 
 Each mineral has a definite chemical makeup: it consists of a specific combination of atoms of certain [[Chemical element|elements]]. An element is a substance that contains only one type of atom. 
 
 Scientists can classify minerals into groups on the basis of their chemical makeup. Though there are thousands of different minerals, only about 30 are common in Earth's crust. These 30 minerals make up most rocks in the crust. For that reason, they are called rock-forming minerals. 
 * '''Silicates''' are most common group. All the minerals in this group contain [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]—the two most common elements in Earth's crust—joined. [[Silicate]]s may include other elements such as [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]] and [[calcium]]. [[Quartz]], [[feldspar]], and [[mica]] are common silicates. 
 * '''Carbonates''' are the second most common group of rock-forming minerals is the [[carbonate]]s. All the minerals in this group contain carbon and oxygen joined. [[Calcite]], which is common in [[seashell]]s, is a [[carbonate]] mineral. 
 * '''Oxides''' include the minerals from which most [[metal]]s, such as [[tin]] and [[copper]], are refined. An [[oxide]] consists of an element, usually a metal, joined to oxygen. This group includes [[haematite]], a source of [[iron]]. 
 
 [[File:Brazilianite-21986.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brazilianite]]]] 
 * '''Sulphates''' contain the [[sulphate]] group SO < sub > 4 < /sub > . Sulphates commonly form in [[evaporite]]s where highly salty waters slowly evaporate, allowing sulfates and [[halide]]s to [[precipitate]] where the water evaporates. Sulphates also occur where hot waters are forced through the rock, as with [[geyser]]s. 
 
 There are many other mineral groups. 
 
 == Some uses of minerals == 
 People use minerals for many everyday purposes. Every time people turn on a [[microwave oven]] or a TV, minerals are being used. The [[copper]] in the wires that carry electricity to the machine is made from a mineral. Table [[salt]] or halite, is another mineral that people use in their everyday life. 
 * [[Graphite]] is used to make [[pencil]]s 
 * Rock salt is used in cooking 
 * Mineral [[ores]] are the source of metals.
