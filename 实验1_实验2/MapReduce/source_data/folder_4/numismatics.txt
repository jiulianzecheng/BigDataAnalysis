'''Numismatics''' is the study and collecting of [[coin]]s and the history behind the coins. A '''Numismatist''' is either a collector of coins or a scholar who studies the history of coins. 
 
 ==Origin of Word== 
 The term comes from a word meaning  " of coins. "  The original word is French (numismatique), which itself is from a Latin origin (numismatis). < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fmisma νόμισμα],

 ==History of Numismatics== 
 Coin collectors may have existed in ancient times. Caesar [[Augustus]] may have been an example. < ref > [[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#75 75 on-line text]. < /ref >  The first known book about coin collecting was in 1514,  " De Asse et Partibus " , by [[Guillaume Budé]]. < ref > ''[[Brigham Young University]]'' [http://net.lib.byu.edu/aldine/44Bude.html library web page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725015240/http://net.lib.byu.edu/aldine/44Bude.html |date=2008-07-25 }} < /ref >  However, only royalty really enjoyed coin collecting until the 19th century. That's when professional organizations started to sprout, like the [[American Numismatic Society]] in 1858. 
 
 ==Modern Numismatics== 
 '''Modern numismatics''' is a sub-field that focuses on when coins started being stamped by machines (around 17th century on). Because of its focus, modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians. Other subfields/variants include [[exonumia]] (focus on coin-like objects), [[notaphily]] (focus on paper money instead of coins), and [[scripophily]] (focus on stocks and bonds instead of coins).
