 === Main === 
 * CatDog (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] and [[Tom Kenny]] respectively) are a conjoined [[cat]] and [[dog]] sibling. CatDog's conjoined body is very stretchy and flexible. Cat is the smarter and more cunning and Dog is the more happy-go-lucky and more [[gullible]]. Cat often devises plans to trick Dog into getting what he wants, such as making Dog smarter in an attempt to have more in common with him, or having him win a dog sledding contest by training him in a very hard and militaristic manner, and usually, as a result of his greediness and selfishness, these schemes all blow up in his face. Dog is the source of clumsiness. Dog is an [[American Foxhound]].
