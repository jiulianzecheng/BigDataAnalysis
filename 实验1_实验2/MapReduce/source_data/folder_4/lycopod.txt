 The '''Lycopods''' ('''Lycopodiophyta''' or '''Lycophyta''') are the oldest surviving [[vascular plant]] division. This is a subdivision of the [[plant]] [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. Its earliest fossils are from 428–410 million years ago. < ref name= " Kenrick  &  Crane " > {{cite book | last1=Kenrick | first1=Paul | last2=Crane | first2=Peter R. | year=1997 | title=The origin and early diversification of land plants: a cladistic study | url=https://archive.org/details/originearlydiver0000kenr | location=Washington D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | isbn=1-56098-730-8 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/originearlydiver0000kenr/page/339 339]–340 }} < /ref > < ref name= " isbn0-19-850065-3 " > {{cite book | author = McElwain, Jenny C | display-authors = etal | title = The evolution of plants | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 0-19-850065-3 | oclc =  | accessdate = }} < /ref > < sup > p99 < /sup > 
 
 The Lycopods include some of the most primitive ([[basal]]) living [[species]]. They reproduce by shedding [[spore]]s and have macroscopic [[alternation of generations]]. < ref > 'macroscopic' = can be seen with the naked eye, e.g. instead of requiring a microscope < /ref >  Members of Lycopodiophyta have a [[protostele]], < ref > A central core of [[vascular tissue]] which conducts water and nutrients up, and manufactured substances down. The stele also supports the plant above the ground. < /ref >  and the [[sporophyte]] generation is dominant. < ref > The sporophyte generation is [[diploid]], and produces the spores. The spores produce the [[haploid]] [[gametophyte]] generation. < /ref > < ref name= " Eichhorn " > Eichhorn, Evert, and Raven 2005. ''Biology of plants'', 7th ed. 381-388. < /ref > 
 
 Lycopods differ from all other vascular plants in having [[microphyll]]s, [[Leaf|leaves]] that have only a single vein rather than the much more complex megaphylls found in [[fern]]s and [[seed plants]]. 
 
 == The first coalfields == 
 The lycopods, or [[Clubmoss|club mosses]], are the main plants in the [[Carboniferous]] rain forests. They were only partly eaten by [[Insect|insects]] and other life-forms. Mostly they formed [[swamp]]lands which in the course of time became [[coal measures]]. In fact most of the coal from the Carboniferous period comes from these swamplands. < ref > Gensel P.G.  &  Edwards D. (eds). ''Plants invade the land : evolutionary  &  environmental perspectives''.

 == Classification == 
 There are around 1,200 living species of Lycopodiophyta; they are generally divided into three orders. < ref name= " isbn0-7487-4336-7 " > {{cite book | author=Callow R.S.  &  Cook, Laurence Martin | title=Genetic and evolutionary diversity: the sport of nature | url=https://archive.org/details/geneticevolution0000cook | publisher=S.
