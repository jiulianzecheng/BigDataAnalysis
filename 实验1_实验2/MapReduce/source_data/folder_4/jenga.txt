 '''Jenga''' is a block building game created by board game creator Leslie Scott, and owned by Hasbro in terms of marketing. Most of its games are now owned by Art's Ideas. In this game, players take turns removing blocks from a 54 built tower and replacing them at the top without making the tower fall. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-03-12|title=Jenga Rules: Your Complete Guide with Instructions|url=https://bargames101.com/how-to-play-jenga/|access-date=2021-10-22|website=Bar Games 101|language=en-US}} < /ref >
