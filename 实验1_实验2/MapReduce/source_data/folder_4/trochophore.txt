 A '''trochophore''' is a type of [[larva]] found in [[Ocean|marine]] [[plankton]]. It belongs to animals of several related [[phyla]], in the superphylum [[Lophotrochozoa]]. 
 
 They have  two or more bands of [[cilia]]. By moving their cilia rapidly, a water eddy is created. In this way they control the direction of their movement. Also, in this way they bring their food closer, to capture it more easily.
