 The '''Gendarmenmarkt''' is a square in [[Berlin]], and the site of the [[:en:Konzerthaus Berlin|Konzerthaus]] and the [[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Cathedral]] and [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|German Cathedral]]s. The centre of the Gendarmenmarkt is crowned by a statue of Germany's poet [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The square was created by [[Johann Arnold Nering]] at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by [[Georg Christian Unger]] in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after the [[Prussian]] regiment [[:de:Gensdarmes|Gens d'Armes]].

 During [[World War II]], most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. Today all the buildings are restored to their former state.   
 
 The Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin's most popular Christmas markets.
