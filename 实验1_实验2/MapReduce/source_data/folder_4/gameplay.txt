 Along with the rise of [[game development|video game development]] in the 1980s, the term gameplay was used only in the context of [[video game]]s. Now its popularity has started to be used in the description of other, more traditional, game types. Generally, gameplay is about the general experience of playing a video game. It does not include other things like graphics and sound. [[Game mechanics]], on the other hand, is the set of rules in a game that are supposed to make an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions often use terms like  " game mechanics " . This is because  " gameplay "  is too general for academic discussions. < ref name= " The Stupidest Word in Videogames " > {{cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Alex|title=Videogame Culture: Volume 1|year=2012}} < /ref >
