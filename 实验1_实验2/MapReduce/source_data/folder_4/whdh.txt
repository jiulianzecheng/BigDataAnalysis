'''WHDH''' is a [[television]] station in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]]. It is owned by [[Sunbeam Television]] and is an independent television station that used to carry NBC. It is received on Channel 7 in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and southern New Hampshire. 
 
 In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there was another television station in Boston with the name WHDH-TV. That station aired on Channel 5 and is now called WCVB-TV. There is no relationship between the two stations. 
 
 ==History== 
 Channel 7 in Boston went on the air June 21, 1948 as WNAC-TV. It is the second oldest television station in Boston, and the third oldest in the [[New England]] states. The first owner was [[General Tire]], which later became [[RKO General]].  The station showed [[CBS]] network programs when it first went on the air. The station also showed some programs from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. However, when a new TV station in Boston, Channel 5, then known as WHDH-TV but now known as [[WCVB-TV]], started in 1957, Channel 7 dropped all ABC programs, which were then aired on Channel 5.  In 1961, Channel 7 and Channel 5 switched networks, and Channel 7 became an ABC station, and Channel 5 became the CBS station for Boston. In 1972, the two channels switched again, and Channel 7 returned to being a CBS station, and Channel 5 an ABC station. 
 
 On May 21, 1982, RKO General lost the license to broadcast and Channel 7 was taken over by New England Television on May 22. The channel was renamed WNEV-TV. New England Television bought a radio station known as WHDH in 1989, and in January, 1990, channel 7 was renamed WHDH-TV. On January 2, 1995, Channel 7 stopped showing CBS programs and began showing [[NBC]] programs. Before then, NBC programs were shown on [[WBZ-TV]], Channel 4, which now shows CBS programs. The reason for this switch is because WBZ-TV's owners merged with the CBS network. 
 
 In 1993, the station was sold to Sunbeam Television. In July, 2010, Channel 7 officially dropped the -TV from its name, becoming just WHDH. 
 
 In 2017, the station stopped carrying NBC programming, losing the affiliation to WBTS-CD, and became an independent television station.
