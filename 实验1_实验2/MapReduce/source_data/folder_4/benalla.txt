 ==History== 
 [[Major]] [[Thomas Mitchell]] went through this area on his way back to [[Sydney]] in [[1836]]. One of the men with him, a [[convict]] named James Taylor, was drowned while trying to cross the Broken River. < ref name= " Benalla " > Australian Encyclopaedia Vol 1. pg.488. Angus and Robertson 1958 < /ref >  After Mitchell many farmers arrived with sheep to make new farms. The [[Reverend]] Joseph Docker (1793 - 1865) started a farm called '' " Benalta " '' in [[1838]] but later settled on the run Bontherambo, near Wangaratta. The name came from the Taungurung [[Indigenous Australian|Australian aboriginal]] word meaning  " musk duck " . < ref name= " Benalla " / >  The name was later changed to Benalla. 
 
 Seven men, working for farmers George and William Faithfull, were killed by the aborigines at Winding Swamp on [[April 11]] 1838. The police under [[Captain]] Lonsdale killed many Taungurung people as punishment. Their ears were cut off and taken back to [[Melbourne]] as a trophy (prize). < ref name= " Taungurung " > [http://www.mansfield.vic.gov.au/projectwappan/html/taungurung.html.|Taungurung - Project Wappan]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
