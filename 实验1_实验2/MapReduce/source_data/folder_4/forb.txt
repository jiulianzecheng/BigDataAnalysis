 A '''forb''' is a [[plant]] with broad [[leaves]], flowers, and no [[wood]]y stem. Forbs are [[herbaceous plant]]s because their [[plant stem|stem]]s are green and soft, not woody. Many familiar plants are forbs, such as [[sunflower]]s, [[clover]]s, and [[melon]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2016-06-24|title=Forbs|url=https://forages.oregonstate.edu/ssis/plants/plant-types/forbs|access-date=2023-01-25|website=Forage Information System|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Forbs are not a grouping used in [[taxonomy]], because some forbs are more closely related to other plants than they are to each other. All herbaceous [[flowering plant]]s are forbs except [[grass]]es, [[sedge]]s, and [[Juncaceae|rush]]es.
