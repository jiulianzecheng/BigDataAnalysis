'''Campervans''' are self-propelled vehicles that can provide [[transport]] and sleeping accommodation. The term ''campervan'' mainly represents [[van]]s which are fitted out, with a [[custom]] built body for use as accommodation. In the [[United States]], the vans are also known as ''recreational vehicles'' or RVs and are larger than in [[Europe]]. Such vehicles sometimes have a [[refrigerator]], [[microwave oven]], showers and [[television]]s.
