A '''blowhole''' is the hole that [[cetacean]]s use to [[breathe]]. It is [[homology|homologous]] to the [[nostrils]] of other [[mammals]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/03/whale-evolution.html|title = Whale evolution: The blowhole|date = 18 March 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 When [[whales]] come up to the surface of the water, they release air through the blowhole. [[Water vapor]] in the air condenses. This makes a spray of water.
