 '''Sonthofen''' is the most southerly town of [[Germany]]. It is in the [[Oberallgäu]] region of the [[Bavarian Alps]]. [[Oberstdorf]] is {{convert|14|km}} farther south but is not a town. In 2005, Sonthofen was awarded  " Alpenstadt des Jahres "  (Alpine city of the year). 
 
 In [[World War II]] Sonthofen was bombed twice. This was because [[Adolf Hitler]] had built the ''[[Ordensburg Sonthofen]]'' in Sonthofen. Young boys were trained there for Nazi Party organisations. Sonthofen was given town rights on 18 August 1963. < gallery widths= " 230 " >
