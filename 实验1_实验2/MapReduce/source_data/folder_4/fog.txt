 '''Fog''' is a [[Meteorology|meteorological]] [[phenomenon]].  It is [[stratus cloud]] < nowiki/ > s on the surface of the Earth.  Fog may appear on [[land]] or [[sea]] and it usually lowers [[visibility]] (makes it hard to see very far).  When the air chills, [[moisture]] will turn to fog. 
 
 Fog is made up of tiny water droplets or, in very cold conditions, ice crystals. When seen on a high speed camera, (a special camera that takes many frames and can view videos at very low speed) it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air. These water droplets make up the fog or mist.  
 
 There are many types of fog, classified according to what makes the [[condensation]]. They include evaporation fog, advection fog, radiation fog, and upslope fog. The thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere, temperature, weather and location.
