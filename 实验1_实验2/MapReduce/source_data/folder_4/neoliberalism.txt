'''Neoliberalism''' is a term for different [[social]] and [[economy|economic]] [[idea]]s.  There is no agreed definition. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Mudge|first=Stephanie|date=26 August 2008|title=What is neo-liberalism?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ser/article/6/4/703/1739555?login=false|access-date=2023-11-11|website=academic.oup.com}} < /ref >   Originally the term was used by a group of [[liberal]]s who helped shape social [[market economy]] in the mid [[20th century]]. Classic liberalism is characterized by [[free market]] trade, [[deregulation]] of financial markets, [[mercantilism]] and the shift away from state [[welfare]] provision. 
 
 [[Alexander Rustow]] was the first economist to develop this concept, looking after a [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] system rather than a Laissez Faire Capitalist Society. 
 
 == Characteristics of Neoliberalism == 
 
 In the application of neoliberal ideals, the [[state]] might also intervene and regulate, for example, to prevent exploitation, or to ensure social fairness and equality. 
 
 Neoliberalism is against the protection of group - rather than individual - interests, for example, that might be achieved through [[lobbying]] of [[group]]s, or state interventions that protect national interests via [[tariff]] < nowiki/ > s or [[subsidy|subsidies]]. 
 
 Neoliberalism has moved away from a centrally governed economy. 
 
 == Contemporary use == 
 Since the 1990s the term has been consistently used in academia to imply the move from [[welfare state]] to [[laissez faire]] economic management, particularly associated with the promotion of free market ideals in the late 1980s by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the [[UK]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the [[US]].
