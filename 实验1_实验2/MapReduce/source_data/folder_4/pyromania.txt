 Someone with this disorder deliberately and purposely sets fires on more than one occasion. Before the act of lighting the fire the person usually has tension and an emotional buildup. When around fires, a person with pyromania shows intense interest or fascination and may also get pleasure, gratification or relief. < ref name= " frey " > {{Cite book |last=Frey |first=Rebecca J. |title=Pyromania |date=2003 |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders |volume=2 |pages=802â€“806}} < /ref >
