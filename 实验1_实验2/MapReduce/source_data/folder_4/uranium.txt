 '''Uranium''' is a [[chemical element]] (a [[metal]]) on the [[periodic table]]. It has an [[atomic number]] of 92, which means that a uranium [[atom]] has 92 [[protons]] in its center, the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]].  
 
 Uranium dug out of the ground is made from three different [[isotopes]]. The isotopes are different types of uranium with different numbers of [[neutron]]s in their [[Nucleus (physics)|nuclei]]. Most of it is uranium-238; [[uranium-235]] is less common; uranium-234 is the rarest. [[Pitchblende]] is the main [[ore]] that is mined for uranium. 
 
 Uranium-235 can be used in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapons]] by making a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This turns the uranium-235 into uranium-236 and splits the nucleus into two smaller nuclei. This makes two completely different elements with smaller [[atomic number]]s. The process is called [[nuclear fission]] and creates lots of heat. This heat makes it very useful for making [[steam engine|steam]] in nuclear reactors, or for making [[explosion]]s with nuclear weapons. Most such weapons use [[plutonium]] made from uranium-238. Uranium is slightly [[radioactive]]. 
 
 Uranium without its uranium-235 is called [[depleted uranium]]. It is less radioactive than natural uranium. It is used in [[anti-tank gun|anti-tank]] weapons. Uranium can also be used as a [[dye]] for [[stained glass]] or [[pottery]].

 Uranium is a dangerous substance. Because uranium is radioactive it is often seen with the hazard sign for radioactive elements, a group of three [[triangle]]s with curved outer edges pointing in towards the middle (as you can see on the left). Uranium is a shiny white metal, but is usually seen in its [[oxide]] form which is black. Spent or partially spent uranium fuel rods are kept underwater, inside a nuclear reactor or in a spent fuel pool. Uranium can glow blue due to [[Cherenkov radiation]]. In addition to being radioactive, uranium is a [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] and is chemically [[Poison|toxic]]. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]]. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 6. It is [[malleable]], [[Ductility|ductile]] and slightly [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]]. It is strongly [[Electropositivity|electropositive]]. It is a poor [[electrical conductor]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56198760|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of science  &  technology.|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-142957-3|edition=5th|location=New York|oclc=56198760}} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44440496|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics, 2000-2001|date=2000|publisher=CRC Press|others=Lide, David R., 1928-|isbn=0-8493-0481-4|edition=81st|location=Boca Raton|oclc=44440496}} < /ref >  Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1 g/cm < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Uranium - Element information, properties and uses {{!}} Periodic Table|url=https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/92/uranium|access-date=2020-11-20|website=www.rsc.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements and their [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. [[Hydrochloric acid|Hydrochloric]] and [[nitric acid]]s dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than [[hydrochloric acid]] dissolve the element very slowly. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 [[Uranium-235]] was the first [[isotope]] that was found to be [[fissile]]: The molecule splits. Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable (can be broken down), but are not fissile. 
 
 As little as 15 & nbsp;lb (7 & nbsp;kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an [[atomic bomb]]. The nuclear weapon detonated over [[Hiroshima]], called ''Little Boy'', relied on uranium fission.

 The use of uranium in its natural [[oxide]] form dates back to the year [[79 AD]]. It was used in the [[Roman Empire]] to make [[ceramic glaze]]s [[yellow]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Yellow [[glass]] with 1% uranium oxide was found in a [[Roman villa]] on [[Cape Posillipo]] in the [[Bay of Naples]], [[Italy]]. It was found by R.T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. In the late [[Middle Ages]], [[pitchblende]] was extracted from the [[Habsburg]] silver mines in [[Jáchymov|Joachimsthal]], [[Bohemia]] (now Jáchymov in the [[Czech Republic]]). In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium [[ore]] were these [[mine]]s. 
 
 == Origin == 
 Uranium is only naturally formed by the rapid neutron capture in [[Supernova|supernovae]] and [[neutron star]] mergers. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://herschel.jpl.nasa.gov/chemicalOrigins.shtml |title=History/Origin of Chemicals |publisher=NASA |access-date=1 January 2013}} < /ref > < ref > Burbidge E.M.; Burbidge G.R.; Fowler W.A.; Hoyle F. 1957.

 Radioactive heat production is present on Earth in quantities. It may be a widespread component of [[Solar System Habitable Zone|Solar System]] planets, and possible other planetary systems. That might help to explain the high internal temperatures of planets. 
 
 == Mining == 
 The world's largest producer of [[uranium]] is [[Kazakhstan]], which in 2019 produced 43% of the world's mining output. [[Canada]] was the next largest producer with a 13% share, followed by [[Australia]] with 12%. < ref name= " wna_2019 " > {{cite web |title=Uranium Production Figures, 2009-2018 |url=https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/uranium-production-figures.aspx |publisher=World Nuclear Association |access-date=19 March 2020 |location=London |date=August 2019}} < /ref >  Uranium has been mined in every continent except Antarctica.
