 '''Hutterites''' are a group of [[Protestantism|Protestanŧ]] Christians. They are an [[anabaptist]] movement; they think believers should be baptized (a second time). Their movement was founded by [[Jacob Hutter]] who lived in the [[16th century]]. The main difference to the [[Mennonite]]s is that they think the [[Bible]] should be read literally. They also share everything they have; there is no private property. Within the Hutterites, there are a few different groups. Some of the groups are more liberal than others. Usually, the different groups also have different leaders.  
 
 Today, there are about 50.000 Hutterites; most of them live in the [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Like the [[Amish]] they still speak a dialect of [[German language|German]]. In 2005, there were about 465 settlements, with 60 to 150 people each. The people who emigrated to the US or Canada had one of the following family names: Decker, Entz, Glanzer, Gross, Hofer, Kleinsasser, Knels, Mändel, Stahl, Tschetter, Waldner, Walther, Wipf, Wollmann, or Wurz.
