 November is the eleventh [[month]] of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], after [[October]] and before [[December]], which is the last month. November has 30 days. It was the ninth month in the old [[Roman calendar]], which is where its name comes from. It kept its name when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the beginning of the year, despite becoming the [[eleven]]th [[month]]. The ninth month is now [[September]]. 
 
 November begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[common year]]s and [[March]] every year, as each other's first days are exactly 39 weeks (273 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. November ends on the same day of the week as [[August]] every year, as each other's last days are exactly 13 [[week]]s (91 [[day]]s) apart. 
 
 In common years, November starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[September]] and [[December]] of the previous year. In common years, November finishes on the same day of the week as [[March]] and June of the previous year, and in leap years, September of the previous year. 
 
 In years immediately before common years, November starts on the same day of the week as [[August]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[May]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, November finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[February]] and [[October]] of the following year. 
 
 In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], November is an [[Autumn]] (Fall) [[month]], and the further north in the hemisphere, the more likely it is to get colder as [[December]] approaches. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] it is a [[Spring]] month. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season|seasonal]] equivalent of [[May]] in the other. 
 
 Several observances around the beginning of the month are believed to be related, linked to the old [[Celts|Celtic]] celebration of [[Samhain]] on [[November 1]]. These events include [[Halloween]] ([[October 31]]), [[Day of the Dead]] in [[Mexico]] ([[October 31]] to [[November 2]]), [[All Saints Day]] ([[November 1]]) and All Souls Day ([[November 2]]).  
 
 In several mainly Christian countries, it is month in which people who died in [[war]] are commonly remembered, mainly related to the end of [[World War I]] on [[November 11]], [[1918]]. Near the end of the month [[Advent]], the period leading up to [[Christmas]], begins.
