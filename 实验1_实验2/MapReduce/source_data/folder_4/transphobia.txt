 '''Transphobia''' or '''transmisia''' is any [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] based on bad feelings toward [[transgender]] or [[transsexual]] people. This also means refusing them the chance to take part in [[society]], have a [[job]], or forcing [[prostitution]] out of them, not only [[hate speech]] or [[hate crime]] against the transgender person. In 2009, to prohibit hate crime against transgender people, [[Matthew Shepard Act]] was passed and entered into force by recognition of the president [[Barack Obama]] in the United States.

 Transphobia is common all over the world. It is also found in [[social justice]] movements such as [[feminism]]. It is especially associated with [[radical feminism]]. 'Transmisogyny' is a word that refers to transphobia towards trans women. [[Julia Serano]] made it popular with her book ''Whipping Girl''. Cissexism is sometimes used as a synonym for transphobia, and cisphobia is sometimes used as its antonym.
