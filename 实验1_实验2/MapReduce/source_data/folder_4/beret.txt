 A '''beret''' is a soft, round type of [[hat]]. They are similar to [[caps]], but without the peak at the front. Berets are usually made of [[felt]] or a similar [[material]].  Berets are often worn in [[France]].   
 
 Berets are worn as part of the uniform of many military and police units across the world.  Many other organizations also wear berets for different purposes. < ref > Kilgour, Ruth Edwards 1958. ''A pageant of hats ancient and modern''. McBride. < /ref >
