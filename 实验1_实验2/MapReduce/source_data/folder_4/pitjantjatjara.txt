 '''Pitjantjatjara''' ({{IPA-aus|b̥ɪɟɐɲɟɐɟɐɾɐ}}) is the name of a [[nation]] of [[Indigenous Australians|native Australian]] people. They live in the [[central Australia]]n [[desert]]. The people call themselves ''[[Aṉangu]]'', a word which means  " person "  or  " people "  in [[Pitjantjatjara language|their own language]]. The group is considered part of the [[Western Desert cultural bloc]]. Pitjantjatjara people are closely related to their two closest neighbours: the [[Yankunytjatjara]] and the [[Ngaanyatjarra]]. They can understand much of each other's languages. There are currently about 4,000 people from this nation living in small communities spread out across their homeland. 
 
 The [[homeland]] of the Pitjantjatjara covers north-western [[South Australia]] and the south-west of the [[Northern Territory]]. More communities are located a short distance over the [[border]] in [[Western Australia]]. The land they live in is special to them. It forms a large part of their [[culture]] and [[belief]]s. In South Australia, they mostly live in the [[Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands]]. This area is where the Pitjantjatjara language is strongest. In the Northern Territory, their country is on the south side of [[Lake Amadeus]]. It is centred around [[Uluṟu]] and [[Kata Tjuṯa]], two of their most [[sacred site]]s.  
 
 Pitjantjatara are historically a [[nomadic people]]. They lived in small family groups, travelling from one [[wikt:rockhole|rock hole]] to another depending on the water and [[bushfood|food]] that was available. In the mid-20th century, most families [[Human settlement|settled]] in new communities they built together. They have kept their culture and identity despite outside [[influence]]s and attempts to force them to change. These influences come from the wider Australian community.
