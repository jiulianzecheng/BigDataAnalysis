'''Egocentrism '''is a state of mind of putting oneself in the center of interest, of being interested more about oneself than about other people. While this is normal in young [[child|children]], it becomes more and more of a problem, in older children, [[adolescent|adolescents]] and [[adults]]. To egocentric people, self-relevant information is seen as more important in shaping one’s judgments than are thoughts about others and other-relevant information. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Windschitl P.

Egocentrism is different from both [[egoism]] and [[narcissism]]. Young children are egocentric: they see themselves as the  " center "  of the world. Developing self-conscience requires the perception that there are others, that there is socialisation with other people, and that there are differences between oneself and other people. Egocentric people are often unable to fully understand or to cope with other people's opinions. The fact that reality can be different from what they are ready to accept is difficult for them.
