 '''Nunavut''' is a [[provinces and territories of Canada|territory]] in [[Canada]]. It is the newest, largest, and northernmost territory of Canada. It was founded in 1999 when many [[Inuit]] living in the [[Northwest Territories]] wanted to have an independent [[province]] and government. Its capital is named [[Iqaluit]]. It is in the [[arctic|north]] of Canada, and has a particularly cold [[climate]] for much of the year. It has many native people (mainly Inuit). 
 
 The main form of [[transportation]] is the [[snowmobile]]. For the first week of being a separate unit, it was the Province of Nunavut, but after a week it was renamed Nunavut Territory. 
 
 A symbol of the territory is the [[Canadian Eskimo Dog|Eskimo Dog]] (''{{lang|iu|qimmiq}}''). < ref name= " nunavut " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.assembly.nu.ca/about-legislative-assembly/official-animal-nunavut |title=Legislative assembly of Nunavut: The Canadian Inuit Dog (Canis Familiaris Borealis) - Official Animal of Nunavut |access-date=2014-01-14 |archive-date=2014-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831065018/http://www.assembly.nu.ca/about-legislative-assembly/official-animal-nunavut |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Even today, some people still use these [[dogs]].{{cn|date=January 2014}}
