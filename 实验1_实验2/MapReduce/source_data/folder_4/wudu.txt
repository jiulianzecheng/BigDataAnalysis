 '''Wudu''' ({{lang-ar|الوضوء}} '''al-wu{{IPA|ḍ}}ū'''', {{lang-fa|آبدست}} ''ābdast'', {{lang-tr|abdest}}, {{lang-ur|وضو}} '''wazū'''') is the [[Islamic]] act of washing parts of the body using [[water]]. It is necessary to do this before one prays.

 {{cquote|''Abu Huraira reported that the Messenger of Allah said,  " When the Muslim - or believing - slave does wudu' and washes his face, every wrong thing at which his eyes have looked leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every wrong thing which his hands have touched leaves with the water - or with the last drop of water. When he washes his feet. every wrong thing to which his feet have walked leaves with the water – or with the last drop of water, until he emerges cleansed of sins. " '' [Muslim 1/148 and others]}}
