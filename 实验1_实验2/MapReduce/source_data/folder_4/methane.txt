 '''Methane''' is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|[[Carbon|C]]|[[Hydrogen|H]]|4}}. It is an [[alkane]] with one carbon [[atom]]. It is often found as the main part of [[natural gas]].

It is also less stable and slowly oxidates by [[oxygen]] to carbon dioxide and [[water]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Methane is used in [[gas taps]] in places such as [[kitchen]]s, chemistry classrooms, laboratories, etc. as it burns very easily because of its simple [[molecular structure]]. 
 
 == Molecular structure == 
 Methane's molecular structure is very simple. It is a single [[carbon]] [[atom]] surrounded by four [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s. 
 
 == Production == 
 Methane can be made by many chemical ways, but usually is found in natural gas and is obtained by [[fractional distillation]], after it has become liquid.
