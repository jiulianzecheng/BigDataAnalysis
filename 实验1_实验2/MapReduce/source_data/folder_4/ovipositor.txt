[[Image:Dolichomitus imperator Oviposition R Bartz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The process of '''oviposition''' in ''[[Dolichomitus imperator]]'': 1 Tapping with her antennae the wasp listens for the vibrations that indicate a host is present; 2 With the longer ovipositor, the wasp drills a hole through the bark; 3 The wasp inserts the ovipositor into the cavity which contains the host larva; 4 Making corrections; 5 and 6 Depositing eggs.]] 
 
 An '''ovipositor''' is the long hollow [[tube]] on the rear of female [[insects]] (and some other animals). Through this tube they lay eggs. The ovipositor is formed by the union of three pairs of rear [[appendage]]s.   
 
 In many [[species]] it is a piercing organ which allows the insect to put its eggs into a specific place. In some species of [[wasp]], the female [[drill]]s through tree [[bark]] with her ovipositor and lays eggs in the bodies of [[Larva|grubs]] eating under the bark.  
 However, in many [[hymenoptera]] the ovipositor is used as a [[Sting (disambiguation)|sting]], and the female does not use it for egg-laying.
