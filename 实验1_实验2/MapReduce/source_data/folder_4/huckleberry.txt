 '''Huckleberry''' is a name used in [[North America]] for several [[plant]]s in two closely related [[Genus|genera]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] ''[[Ericaceae]]'': ''[[Gaylussacia]]'' and ''[[Vaccinium]]''. The huckleberry is the [[U.S. state|state]] [[fruit]] of [[Idaho]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Idaho State Emblems|url=https://sos.idaho.gov/emblems/index.html|access-date=2021-07-01|website=sos.idaho.gov}} < /ref > 
 
 Some ''Vaccinium'' species, such as the [[red huckleberry]], are always called huckleberries. Other species may be called [[Blueberry|blueberries]] or huckleberries in different locations. 
 
 There is much confusion in naming of [[berry|berries]] in [[American English]]. The 'garden huckleberry' (''[[Solanum]] melanocerasum'') is not a true huckleberry but a member of the [[nightshade]] family. 
 
 The fruit of most species of huckleberry can be eaten. The berries are small and round. They are usually less than 5 & nbsp;mm in [[diameter]] and contain 10 seeds. Berries range in [[color]] from bright red, through dark purple, and into the blues. In taste the berries range from [[wikt:tart|tart]] to [[Sweet (taste)|sweet]]. They have a [[flavor]] similar to that of a blueberry. Huckleberries are well liked by many [[mammal]]s such as [[bear]]s and [[human]]s.
