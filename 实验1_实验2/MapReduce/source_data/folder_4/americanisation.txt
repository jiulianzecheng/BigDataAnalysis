 '''Americanisation''' means that a culture (often a [[country]]) is heavily influenced by so-called ''anglicisms''. These anglicisms are [[United States|American]]-based. Anglicisms can be [[institution]], [[value]]s, [[way]]s and [[behaviour]]s, but can also be [[symbol]]s and [[picture]]s. 
 
 In Americanisation, the transferring of American culture is only one-way. A culture is being Americanised, but the United States aren't affected by the other culture in return.
