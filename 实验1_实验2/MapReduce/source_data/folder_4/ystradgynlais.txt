 '''Ystradgynlais'''  ({{IPA-cy|ˌəstradˈɡənlais|lang}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|ʌ|s|t|r|ə|d|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|n|l|aɪ|s}}) is a [[town]] in the south-west of the county of [[Powys]], [[Wales]]. It is the second largest town in Powys, the largest being [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]]. It is situated on the banks of the [[River Tawe]] in the historic county of [[Brecknockshire]]. 
 
 The town was first recorded in [[1372]]. The place-name '' " Ystradgynlais " '', meaning '' " vale of the river Cynlais " '' – may derive from ''cyn'' (a chisel) and ''glais'' (a stream). Cynlais may also be a personal name. 
 
 Ystradgynlais is one of the few areas within the historic county [[Brecknockshire]] that has a reasonably high proportion of speakers of the [[Welsh language]]. According to the [[2001]] census, more than half of all the [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speakers within the Brecknock district live in Ystradgynlais. 
 
 Parc-yr-Orsedd in the town has a monument dedicated to fallen heroes of both World Wars from Ystradgynlais, [[Abercraf]], [[Cwmtwrch]], [[Cwmgiedd]], [[Glyntawe]] and [[Coelbren, Powys|Coelbren]].
