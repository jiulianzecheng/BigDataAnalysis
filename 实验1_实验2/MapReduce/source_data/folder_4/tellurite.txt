'''Tellurite''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is TeO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > . They are some of the more stable [[tellurium]] compounds. They are weak [[oxidizing agent]]s. In slightly [[acid]]ic conditions, it makes '''hydrogen tellurite''', HTeO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > . When it is very acidic, it makes [[tellurous acid]]. They are normally made by reacting [[tellurium dioxide]] with a metal oxide.

 '''Tellurite''' is also a rare [[mineral]]. This mineral consists of tellurium dioxide. It is a yellow to white mineral. It is in areas that tend to oxidize minerals (oxidation zone). Otherwise telluride or native tellurium would be there.
