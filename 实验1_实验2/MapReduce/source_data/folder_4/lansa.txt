 ==History==  
 
 Its base was the Jorge Chávez International Airport. It operated flights inside and outside the country. Within the country it made itinerary flights, beginning its operations with Lockheed 749 Constellation aircrafts. 
 ===Accidents=== 
 The airline is sadly remembered for the series of accidents that they had. They were caused by bad maintenance/operations of aircrafts.  
 ====1966 accident==== 
 It had its first accident on April 27, 1966, during a flight from Lima to Cuzco. The ship crashed against Mount Talsula, in Sierra de Yauyos, Lima. 49 occupants were killed. This was due to an error by an American pilot.  
 ====1970 accident==== 
 Later, on August 9, 1970, another fatal accident occurred. It was a Lockheed L-188A Electra. It took off from the Velasco Astete airport in the city of Cuzco in the afternoon. They caused the failure of engine number 3 -an Allison turboprop- while trying to take off. The captain of the aircraft continued with this operation. But they failed to maintain the speed necessary for the ascent, a fact that was aggravated by retracting the flaps with the consequent loss of lift, causing the aircraft to lean to the left. Finally it hit the ground in the San Jerónimo sector. As a result of this accident, 99 of the 100 occupants on plane and 2 farmers on ground at the time of impact have died.  
 
 ===Disestablishment=== 
 In 1972, they stopped operations. Their remaining fleet just had only one Lockheed L-188 Electra. This is because others had already been lost.
