'''Abataly''' (Абата́лий) is a [[Russian language|Russian]] first name that was popular in the 17th-19th centuries but has since become rare. Although it appeared in handwritten church calendars during that time, it was not included in the official Synodal Menologium by the late 19th century. The name may have originated from the name Abtalion or from a Greek word meaning a holy place or temple.
