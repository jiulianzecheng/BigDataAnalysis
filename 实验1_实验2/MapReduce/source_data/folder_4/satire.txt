 '''Satire''' is a form in [[art]] or [[writing]] which ridicules either a person, [[government]], or an institution, often through the use of [[humour]]. Satire can either be in [[painting]]s, [[play (theatre)|play]]s, [[book]]s, [[song]]s, [[TV]] or [[movie]]s. It also is used to [[stereotype]] people. 
 
 Satire was used long ago. It is a [[Latin]] word, though the plays of [[Aristophanes]] are often called satirical. Satire was widely known in [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] times. [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]] used it in his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' to make fun of people’s stupidity. Works like ''The Beggar’s Opera'' (1728) used satire to show how silly the [[politician|politicians]] of the time were. The [[Germany|German]] [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] used a lot of satire, as did [[Peter Cook]]. [[Jon Stewart]] and other [[comedian]]s use it frequently. A modern example of satire is the American cartoon [[South Park|''South Park'']]. 
 
 Satire often points out ironic or bad things that powerful people are doing. Its adjective is '''satirical'''.
