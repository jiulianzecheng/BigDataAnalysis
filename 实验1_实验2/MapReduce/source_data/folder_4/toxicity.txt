 '''Toxicity''' is the degree to which a substance can damage an [[organism]]. < ref > Merriam-Webster. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxicity] < /ref >  It is the subject-matter of [[toxicology]]. 
 
 A central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is [[toxic]] when taken to excess. Effects are dose-dependent: even [[water]] can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much. For even a very toxic substance such as [[elapid]] snake [[venom]] there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect.  
 
 Toxicity is [[species]]-specific. < ref > {{Cite web |accessdate = 25 February 2012 | title = Toxicity endpoints  &  tests  | publisher = AltTox.org | url = http://alttox.org/ttrc/toxicity-tests/}} < /ref >  A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another. 
 
 == Acute toxicity == 
 '''Acute toxicity''' describes the bad [[wikt:effect|effect]]s of a [[substance]] that come either from a single exposure, < ref name= " msds " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/acutetoxicity.html|title=The MSDS HyperGlossary: Acute toxicity|accessdate = 2006-11-15|publisher=Safety Emporium}} < /ref >  or from many [[exposure]]s in a short amount of [[time]] (usually less than 24 & nbsp;hours). < ref name= " IUPAC " >  Compendium of Chemical Terminology Internet edition. Acute toxicity. [http://goldbook.iupac.org/AT06800.html] < /ref >  To be known as ''acute'' toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 & nbsp;days of the substance thouching something. < ref name= " IUPAC " / > 
 
 Acute toxicity is different from [[chronic]] toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years). 
 
 It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as '''tests''' for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make [[contact]] with the substance (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity [[Information|data]] comes from [[animal testing]] or, more recently, ''[[in vitro]]'' testing methods and [[Statistical inference|inference]] from data on similar substances. < ref name= " msds " / > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Walum E |title=Acute oral toxicity |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=106 Suppl 2 |pages=497â€“503 |year=1998 |pmid=9599698 |doi=10.2307/3433801 |pmc=1533392 |jstor=3433801 }} < /ref >
