 '''Djoser''' (other names include '''Netjerikhet''', '''Tosorthos''', and '''Sesorthos''') was the first Pharaoh, or king of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt]], c. 2670 BCE. < ref name= " ancient.eu " > Ancient History Encyclopedia: [http://www.ancient.eu/Djoser/ Djoser - Ancient History Encyclopedia], accessdate: January 5, 2017 < /ref >  He is known for the building of the first pyramid built in Egypt, the [[Pyramid of Djoser|Step Pyramid]] at [[Saqqara]]. The Third Dynasty, based in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], was the beginning of the [[Old Kingdom]], a period of stability, achievement and unity. 
 
 There have been claims that he was not the first king, as the [[Abydos King List]] and the [[Turin King List]] give a king by the name of Sanakht. < ref name= " ancient.eu " / >  There is no archaeological evidence to support this, and most experts agree that Djoser was the first. He ruled for at least 20 years, but he had so many temples, tombs and monuments built that some experts say he may have ruled for up to 30 years. < ref name= " ancient.eu " / > 
 
 There is a painted [[limestone]] statue of Djoser, which is the oldest discovered life sized Egyptian statue. < ref name= " touregypt.net " > King Djoser: [http://www.touregypt.net/egyptmuseum/egyptian_museumk3.htm The Egyptian Museum, Cairo, Egypt - King Djoser], accessdate: January 5, 2017 < /ref >  It was found in Saqqara during archaeological digging in 1924-1925. The statue is now in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. 
 
 ==The Step Pyramid== 
 
 The building of the Step Pyramid was quite an achievement. It is the first massive monument built in stone, about 62 meters in height. It is surrounded by a 10 meter high wall, which encloses an area of about 16 hectares. < ref name= " nationalgeographic.com " > National Geographic: Egypt--Step Pyramid of Djoser, Saqqara: [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/djoser.html National Geographic: Egypt--Step Pyramid of Djoser, Saqqara] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216020632/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pyramids/djoser.html |date=2017-02-16 }}, accessdate: January 5, 2017 < /ref >  It shows that the kingdom must have been stable and wealthy to have spent so much time and money to build it. < ref name= " bbc.co.uk " > Djoser: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/djoser.shtml BBC - History - Djoser], accessdate: January 5, 2017 < /ref >  The man who designed it and supervised the building was [[Imhotep]], the oldest named architect known to us. < ref name= " bbc.co.uk " / >  Thousands of years later, Djoser was known to Egyptians as the  " opener of stone " , recognising his legacy of using stone for buildings. < ref name= " ancient.eu " / > 
 
 ==The Famine== 
 The Egyptians believed in a story of how Djoser was able to end a [[famine]]. There is no evidence from the time of his rule, but an engraved stone, a [[stele]], was made 2000 years later giving the details. < ref name= " ancient.eu " / >  Even if the story is a [[legend]], it does show that Djoser was remembered as a great pharaoh. Egypt had been suffering from a famine for seven years, when the god of the [[Nile]], [[Khnum]], spoke to Djoser in a dream. Djoser rebuilt Khnum's temple on [[Elephantine]], an island near modern [[Aswan]]. This pleased the god, and the famine ended. The ruins of the temple are still visible today.
