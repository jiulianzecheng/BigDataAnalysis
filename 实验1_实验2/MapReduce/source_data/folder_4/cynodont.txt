 The '''Cynodonts''' are a sub-order of the [[Therapsid]]a. Cynodonts, one of the most diverse groups of therapsids, are named after their dog-like teeth. 
 
 The [[taxon]] is a [[clade]] which includes modern [[mammal]]s and their [[extinct]] close relatives, the [[Mammaliaformes]].  
 
 The cynodonts lived in all [[continent]]s, and their [[fossil]] record begins in the Upper [[Permian]] 256 million years ago. < ref > [http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo & taxon_no=39168 & is_real_user=1 PaleoBiology Database: ''Cynodontia'', basic info] < /ref > 
 
 The extinct members of the group were victims of the [[End-Triassic extinction event]], but the line that led to the mammals survived.
