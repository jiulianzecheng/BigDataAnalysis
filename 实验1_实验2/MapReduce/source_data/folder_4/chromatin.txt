 Heterochromatin is composed mostly of [[satellite DNA]] [[tandem repeat]]s. The active components of chromatin are DNA and [[histone]] proteins, although other proteins also occur. < ref > Van Holde K.J. ''et al'' 1995. Elements of chromatin structure: histones, nucleosomes, and fibres, p. 1-26. In S.C.R. Elgin (ed) Chromatin structure and gene expression. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford. < /ref >  The functions of chromatin are: 
 *to package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell 
 *to strengthen the DNA to allow [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] 
 *to control [[DNA replication]] and [[gene expression]]. How this works is not yet clear.

 == Chromatin definitions == 
 # '''Simple and concise definition:''' Chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a DNA [[macromolecule]] and protein macromolecules (and RNA). The proteins package and arrange the DNA and control its functions in the cell nucleus. 
 # '''The ''DNA + histone = chromatin'' definition:''' The DNA [[double helix]] in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the [[nucleosome]].
