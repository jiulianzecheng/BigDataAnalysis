A '''lunar base''', '''moon base''', or '''lunar colony''' is a theoretical [[research station]], [[resort]] or similar establishment on the [[Moon]]. As the Moon is only 360,000 kilometers or 250,000 [[statute mile]]s away from the [[Earth]], it would make an ideal test bed for settlements on other [[planet]]s and [[natural satellite]]s. Arguably the best moon colony option would be to place it within one of the Moon's [[lava tube]]s, where it would be protected from radiation, micro[[meteorite]]s, and the wild temperature swings due to the lack of any substantial [[atmosphere]] and the lunar day being 672 [[hour]]s long.
