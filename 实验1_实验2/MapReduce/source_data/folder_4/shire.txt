{{for|the fictional place in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]]|Shire (Middle-earth)}} 
 
 A '''shire''' is an old term for a [[county]] in England. It is a kind of [[local government]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The first shires were created by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] in central and southern [[England]].  Shires were controlled by a royal [[official]] known as a  " shire [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] "  or [[sheriff]]. In modern English usage shires are sub-divided into districts. 
 
 Individually, or as a [[suffix]] in Scotland, the word is pronounced {{IPA|ʃaɪə(ɹ)}} (to rhyme with  " fire " ). As a suffix in an English or Welsh place name it is pronounced {{IPA|-ʃə(ɹ)}} (rhymes with  " fir " ). 
 
 == Shires in Great Britain == 
 In England and Wales, the term  " [[shire county]] "  is used to refer to [[county|counties]] which are not [[metropolitan counties]]. 
 
 It can also be used in a narrower sense, referring only to [[traditional counties]] ending in  " shire " .  These counties are typically (though not always) named after their [[county town]]. 
 
 ===Shires in England=== 
 [[Bedfordshire]], [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Worcestershire]], [[Yorkshire]]. 
 
 Of these, all but Huntingdonshire and Yorkshire are also administrative counties (but with different boundaries).  Huntingdonshire is now administered as a district of Cambridgeshire, and Yorkshire is split between [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East]], [[North Yorkshire|North]], [[South Yorkshire|South]] and [[West Yorkshire]].

 In Wales, the counties of [[Merioneth]] and [[Glamorgan]] are occasionally referred to with the  " shire "  suffix. The only traditional Welsh county that never takes  " shire "  is [[Anglesey]].

 ==Shires in Australia== 
 Shire is the most common word in [[Australia]] for the smallest [[local government areas]] by population. The states of [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]] and [[Western Australia]] use shire for this unit. [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]] use [[district]]. A shire has the same powers as the next largest units, the [[town]] and [[city]].  In NSW, the expression 'The Shire' commonly refers to the [[Sutherland Shire|Sutherland shire]].
