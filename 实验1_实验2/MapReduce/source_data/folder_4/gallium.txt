 '''Gallium''' (chemical symbol: '''Ga''') is [[chemical element]] 31 on the [[periodic table]]. 
 
 Gallium is a [[metal]], but it has some unusual properties. Its melting point is 85.58 Fahrenheit. If it is held in a person's hand, it will melt. It makes a stain on your hand when put on your hand. Gallium is safe in your hands but is not edible. Some Gallium Compounds can be very dangerous. Gallium is a [[semiconductor]], meaning that it conducts [[electricity]] reasonably well but not as well as a [[metal]]. That means gallium can be used in [[computer]]s to make them work. It is very shiny, so it is used to create [[mirror]]s when its in its liquid form. In its purest extracted form, gallium is a vibrant silver color. As a solid, it is blue-gray. Gallium has been used in nuclear bombs to stabilize the crystal structure.  It's related to [[aluminium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]].
