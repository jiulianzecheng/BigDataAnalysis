'''Epigenetics''' is the study of changes in [[gene]] activity which are ''not'' caused by changes in the [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis|sequence]]. < ref > By  " DNA sequence "  we mean the sequence of [[nucleotide]] [[base pairs]] in an '''[[exon]]''', the part of a gene which makes the sequence of [[amino acids]] in the coded protein. < /ref >  It is the study of [[gene expression]], the way genes bring about their [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effects. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. p146 < /ref >  An organism's cells are, genetically, nearly identical. There are, however, certain occurrences that can change how genes are expressed or suppressed. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Lisa D.|last2=Le|first2=Thuc|last3=Fan|first3=Guoping|date=July 11, 2012|title=DNA Methylation and Its Basic Function|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2012.112|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=23–38|doi=10.1038/npp.2012.112|pmid=22781841 |pmc=3521964 |issn=1740-634X}} < /ref > 
 
 These changes in gene activity may stay for the rest of the [[cell]]'s life. They may last for many generations of cells, through [[mitosis|cell divisions]]. However, ''there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism''. < ref name=Bird/ >  Instead, non-hereditary factors cause the organism's genes to behave (express themselves) differently. Epigenetics works by mechanisms such as [[DNA methylation]], where a gene expression may be suppressed.  < ref name=Nessa > Carey, Nessa 2011.

 == Definitions == 
 A general definition is  " the study of... gene activity during the development of complex organisms " . < ref name= " pmid2265224 " > {{cite journal | authors=Holliday R. | title=DNA methylation and epigenetic inheritance | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=326 | issue=1235 | pages=329–338 |date=1990 | doi =10.1098/rstb.1990.0015| pmid=1968668 }} < /ref >  Thus ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence which influences the development of an organism. 
 
 A stricter or narrower definition is  " the study of [[mitosis|mitotically]] and/or [[meiosis|meiotically]] [[heritable]] changes in gene function which cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence " . < ref name= " isbn0-87969-490-4 " > {{cite book | author=Riggs A.D; Russo V.E.A.  &  Martienssen R.A. | title=Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | url=https://archive.org/details/epigeneticmechan0000unse | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location=Plainview, N.Y. | year=1996 | pages=| isbn=0-87969-490-4 | oclc=| doi=| accessdate=}} < /ref >  More simply, it is the study of cell division where there are ''changes in gene expression that cannot be explained by changes to the DNA of the cell''.   
 
 The term  " epigenetics "  has been used to describe processes which are not [[heritable]]. An example is [[histone]] modification. So some definitions do not require [[heritability]]. [[Adrian Bird]] defined epigenetics as  " the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states " . < ref name= " Bird " > Bird A. 2007. Perceptions of epigenetics. ''Nature'' '''447''' (7143): 396–8. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7143/full/nature05913.html] < /ref >  This definition includes [[DNA repair]] or [[cell division]] phases, and stable changes across cell generations. It excludes others such as [[prions]] unless they affect [[chromosome]] function.  
 
 The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project uses the definition:  " ...For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or individuals), and also stable, long-term alterations in the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] potential of a cell " . < ref name= " NIH " > {{cite web |work=NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview |title=Overview |access-date=2015-09-02 |archive-date=2019-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121014029/http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait,  " stably heritable [[phenotype]] resulting from changes in a chromosome ''without alterations in the DNA sequence'' " , was made at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting. < ref name= " pmid19339683 " > {{cite journal | authors=Berger S.L. |display-authors = etal | title=An operational definition of epigenetics | journal=Genes Dev. | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=781–3 | year=2009 | pmid=19339683 | pmc=3959995 | doi=10.1101/gad.1787609 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/7/781.full }} < /ref > 
 
 A somewhat out of date but otherwise reliable and readable account is from ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper. < ref > Rutherford, Adam 2015.[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford  Beware the pseudo gene genies The Guardian] < /ref > 
 
 === Imprinting === 
 '''Genomic imprinting''' in this context means ''tagging a gene for the lifetime of the individual''. Tagging is the basic operation where [[cytosine]] [[amino acid]]s have a [[methyl]] group added by the [[enzyme]] [[DNA methyltransferase]]. This changes the operation of that gene to be (usually) more favourable to the individual. Usually, it switches the gene off. < ref > Plomin R. 2018. ''Blueprint: how DNA makes us who we are''. London: Allan Lane (Penguin), p113. ISBN 978-0-241-36769-8 < /ref >   
 
 In general, the advantage of this is to keep the gene output in the most favourable condition for the lifetime of the particular individual. < ref > Court F. and others 2014. Genome-wide parent-of-origin DNA methylation analysis reveals the intricacies of human imprinting and suggests a germline methylation-independent mechanism of establishment. ''Genome Research'' '''24''' (4): 554–69. PMID 24402520 < /ref >   
 
 Imprinting is giving rise to much medical research at present. < ref name=Nessa/ > 
 
 == Mammals == 
 Imprinting seems to have evolved only about 150 million years ago in animals. It seems largely confined to [[mammals]]. < ref > Lyon M.F.  &  Glenister P.H. 1977. Factors affecting the observed number of young resulting from adjacent-2 disjunction in mice carrying a translocation. ''Genetical Research'' '''29''' (1): 83–92. doi:10.1017/S0016672300017134. PMID 559611 < /ref > < ref > Butler 2009. ''Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics''. 477{{ndash}}486. < /ref >  However, it may have originated separately (and earlier) in plants. < ref > Fell, Robert  &  Berger Frédéric 2007. Convergent evolution of genomic imprinting in plants and mammals. ''Trends in Genetics''. '''23''' (4): 192–9. [https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(07)00057-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0168952507000571%3Fshowall%3Dtrue] < /ref > 
 
 == Examples == 
 The best example of epigenetic changes in [[eukaryote]]s is the process of [[cell differentiation]], where a less specialized cell becomes more specialized. During [[morphogenesis]], generalised [[stem cells]] become the cell lines of the [[embryo]] which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell – the [[zygote]] – [[mitosis|divides]] and changes into all the many cell types: [[neuron]]s, muscle cells, [[epithelium]], blood vessels etc. 
 
 As the [[embryo]] develops, some genes get switched on, while others are switched off or moderated. < ref > {{cite journal| last = Reik| first = Wolf| title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development| journal = Nature| volume =  447| pages = 425–432|  date = 2007| issue = 7143| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7143/full/nature05918.html| doi = 10.1038/nature05918| pmid = 17522676| s2cid = 11794102| accessdate = 2008-04-05 }} < /ref >  This process is called [[gene regulation]]. There are many [[molecule]]s inside the cell [[nucleus]] which do the job of adjusting the genes' output. 
 
 DNA and [[histone]]s make up what is called [[chromatin]]. Epigenetic modifications to the chromatin are copied during cell division. This produces a line of cells, all of which are alike. This is called a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. 
 
 [[Meiosis]] cancels epigenetic changes, and resets the [[genome]] to its baseline state, so the process unfolds in each new generation. There are some exceptions to this rule, but none of these exceptions involve changes to DNA base pair sequences. 
 
 This process is different from [[mutations]] of the DNA. Genetic mutations change the primary DNA sequence, and mutations can happen in any cell. However, only mutations in cells involved in [[reproduction]] can affect the offspring. 
 
 Forms of genetic imprinting have been found in plants and filamentous fungi. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Martienssen RA, Colot V | title = DNA methylation and epigenetic inheritance in plants and filamentous fungi | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5532 | pages = 1070–4 | date = 2001 | pmid = 11498574 | doi = 10.1126/science.293.5532.1070 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Feil and Berger 2007 " >  Feil R.  &  Berger F. 2007.
