'''Orient''' is a term meaning  " the east " . It is from the [[Latin]] word ''oriens''. [[Ancient Rome]] sometimes used it to mean the area east of Rome. Later the dividing line moved farther east, to the [[Adriatic]] or the [[Aegean]] or the [[Indus River]]. This term is in contrast to the  " [[Occident]] " , which is a term meaning  " the west " .  
 
 [[Edward Said]] used the term in his book [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]] (1978). He used it to mean an area including most of present-day North Africa and Middle Eastern countries.
