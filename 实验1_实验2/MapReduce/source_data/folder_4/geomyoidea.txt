 '''Geomyoidea''' is a superfamily of [[rodent]]s that contains the [[pocket gopher]]s ([[Geomyidae]]), the [[kangaroo rat]]s and mice ([[Heteromyidae]]), and their [[fossil]] relatives. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Although they do not look similar, gophers are joined with kangaroo rats into a common superfamily. This is widely agreed. Overall [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], the fossil record, [[sequence analysis]], and [[biogeography]] all support this relationship. 
 
 Modern geomyoids are mostly restricted to North America, but some have extended their range into South America since the [[Great American Interchange]]. Fossil taxa are known from throughout [[Laurasia]]. 
 
 == Relation to other rodents == 
 Some authorities consider the geomyoids related to [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, and [[mountain beaver]]s. 
 
 Other authorities consider geomyoids may be related to [[Muroidea|mice]], [[jerboa]]s, and perhaps [[dormouse|dormice]].
