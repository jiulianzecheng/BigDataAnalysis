The Zealots were a group of [[Jew]]s who lived about the same time as [[Jesus]]. They wanted to defeat the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who were the rulers of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] at that time. They used violence to meet their goals. One of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of Jesus, named Simon, was a Zealot. The word  " zealot "  (not written with a capital letter) in [[modern English]] is used for any person who has a very strong idea about things and works hard to act upon their ideas. There are political and religious zealots but people can be  " zealous "  about other things also.
