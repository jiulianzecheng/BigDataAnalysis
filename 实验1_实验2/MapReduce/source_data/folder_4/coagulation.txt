A '''coagulation''', also known as '''clot''' is a semi-solid substance that [[blood]] forms, especially when it is in [[air]]. When a person bleeds, the blood turns into a clot at the injury. 
 
 A blood clot is also called a ''[[thrombus]]''. The process is called ''coagulation''. 
 
 If a person gets a [[cut]] on their [[body]], that person may bleed. To stop the bleeding, the human body does several things. First, the brain orders the [[liver]] to produce chemicals that will help the clot to form. When the chemicals released by the liver arrive at the injury, the [[coagulation]] begins. In the mean time, the brain also lessens the blood flow near the injury (by tightening the veins and arteries in that area), so that not as much blood is lost.  
 
 There is a limit to how quickly a clot can form. If the cut is very deep and the person bleeds too much, a clot may not be able to form and a lot of blood may be lost.

 Coagulation begins almost instantly after an injury to the blood vessel has damaged the [[endothelium]] lining the vessel. When blood is exposed to proteins such as [[tissue factor]] it starts changes to blood [[platelets]] and the plasma protein [[fibrinogen]], which is a clotting factor. [[Platelet]]s immediately form a plug at the site of injury. Proteins in the [[blood plasma]], called ''coagulation factors'' or ''clotting factors'', respond in a complex [[cascade]] to form [[fibrin]] strands. These strengthen the platelet plug. < ref name=Furie > {{cite journal |author=Furie B.  &  Furie B.C. 2005|title=Thrombus formation in vivo |journal=J. Clin.

 Coagulation is highly conserved throughout biology; that means its [[genetics]] is almost the same in all mammal species. In all [[mammal]]s, coagulation involves both a cellular (platelet) and a [[protein]] (coagulation factor) component. < ref name= " Michelson2006 " > {{cite book|author=Michelson, Alan D. 2006|title=Platelets|date=29 August 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnIQGmiSylkC & pg=PA3|access-date=18 October 2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-369367-9|pages=3–5}} < /ref >  The system in humans has been the most extensively researched and is the best understood. < ref name= " isbn1-4051-8460-4 " > {{cite book |author=Lillicrap, David ''et al'' 2009|title=Practical hemostasis and thrombosis |year=2009|url=https://archive.org/details/practicalhemosta00keyn|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=[https://archive.org/details/practicalhemosta00keyn/page/1 1]–5 |isbn=978-1-4051-8460-1 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Fibrin == 
 Fibrin is a white insoluble fibrous protein formed by the action of thrombin on fibrinogen when blood clots. it forms a network that traps red cells and platelets. 
 
 == Vitamin K == 
 [[Vitamin K]] is an essential factor in blood clotting. Then, vitamin K is oxidized. Another enzyme, Vitamin K epoxide reductase, (VKORC) reduces vitamin K back to its active form. This reactivation is important as a target of anticoagulant drug [[warfarin]]. < ref name= " Colorado " > {{cite web|author=Anderson J, Young L|title=Fat-soluble vitamins|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09315.html|publisher=Colorado State University, Cooperative Extension|access-date=2020-04-25|archive-date=2007-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517050502/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/FOODNUT/09315.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Vitamin K can be found in green [[vegetable]]s, such as [[spinach]], [[lettuce]], [[broccoli]] or [[cabbage]].
