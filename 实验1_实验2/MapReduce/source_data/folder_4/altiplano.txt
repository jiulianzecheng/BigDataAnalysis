 The '''Altiplano''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for  " high plain " ), '''Collao''' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]: Qullaw, meaning  " place of the [[Qulla people|Qulla]] " ) or '''Andean Plateau''', is the largest high [[plateau]] on Earth outside [[Tibet]]. It is in [[South America]]. Most of the Altiplano is in [[Bolivia]]. Its northern parts are in [[Peru]], and its southwestern parts are in [[Chile]]. 
 
 There are many cities on the Altiplano. These include [[El Alto]], [[La Paz]], [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and [[Puno]]. The northeastern part of the Altiplano is more [[humid]] than the southwestern part. The southwestern part has several [[Salt pan|salares]] (salt flats) because of its [[aridity]]. At the Bolivia–Peru border lies [[Lake Titicaca]]. This lake is the largest lake in South America. 
 
 Many [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Culture|cultures]] come from the Altiplano. These include the [[Chiripa]], [[Tiawanaku]] and the [[Inca Empire]]. Spain [[wikt:conquer|conquered]] the region in the 16th century. 
 
 Today, major [[Economy|economic]] activities in the Altiplano include [[mining]], [[llama]] and [[vicuña]] [[herding]], and services (in its cities). Many [[Tourism|tourists]] visit the region.
