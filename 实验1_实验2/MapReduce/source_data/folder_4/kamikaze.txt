 '''''Kamikaze''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 神風; [[literal translation|literally]]: '' " [[god]]-wind " ''; usual [[translation]]: '' " [[divinity|divine]] wind " '') < ref > In the [[Nara period]], [[pronunciation|pronounced]]  " ''Kamukaze'' " , it was a word in [[rhetoric]]s of [[waka]] introducing [[Ise Province]]. < /ref >  is a word of [[Japan]]ese origin. It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a [[typhoon]] that destroyed the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] [[fleet (ships)|ships]] in the 13th century and saved the country from [[invasion]]. In [[Western culture]], the word ''kamikaze'' is used to mean the [[suicide]] [[pilot]]s of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Those pilots attacked the [[ship]]s of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the final years of [[World War II]], during which they flew their planes into enemy ships. It has also come to mean other kinds of [[suicide attack|suicide attacks]]. 
 
 Most people in Western culture believe the word ''kamikaze'' was the name used by the Japanese [[military]] for [[pilot]]s, but that is not true. Their correct name was ''tokubetsu kōgeki tai'' (特別攻撃隊), which [[literal translation|literally]] means '' " special attack team. " '' This is usually [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] ''tokkōtai'' (特攻隊) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by [[Navy]] pilots were called ''shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai'' (神風特別攻撃隊, '' " divine wind special attack team " ''). The [[United States|American]] translators used a different [[wikt:style|style]] of pronunciation of the [[Japanese language]] by mistake, and read the word ''shinpū'' ('' " divine wind " '') as ''kamikaze'', as those [[kanji|Japanese characters]] can be read both ways. The name became so well known after the war that Japanese also started using it. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa hit Bunker Hill (new).png|thumb|110px|left|Kiyoshi Ogawa, ''kamikaze'' pilot, hit the [[aircraft carrier]] USS ''Bunker Hill'' (see picture right).]] 
 [[File:USS Bunker Hill hit by two Kamikazes.jpg|270px|thumb|right|USS ''Bunker Hill'' was hit by Ogawa (see picture left) and another ''kamikaze'' near [[Kyūshū]] on May 11, 1945. Out of a [[crew]] of 2,600, 372 [[sailor]]s were killed.]] 
 
 After the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Navy and its [[Air force]] were [[wikt:defeat|defeated]] in several important battles, like [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]].  They lost many ships (including nearly all the Japanese [[aircraft carrier]]s), hundreds of [[fighter aircraft]], and many of their best pilots.  The Japanese industry was small and very poor compared to the American industry.  For this reason, the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly; but Japan could only make few, and of poor quality. During 1943-44, the Allied forces were moving towards Japan. At the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], on June 19-20, 1944, the Japanese forces were pushed back to the [[Philippines]]. 
 
 On July 15, [[Saipan]] (in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) was captured by Allied forces.  The capture of Saipan made it possible for the [[United States Army Air Force]] to attack Japan itself, using [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]]s.  After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next. The Philippines were very important because they were located between the [[oil field]]s of Southeast Asia and Japan. If Japan lost control over the Philippines, they would have little [[fuel]] left for their ships. On October 17, the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. 
 
 [[Military#Ranks|Vice Admiral]] [[Takijiro Onishi]] was in charge of the Japanese Air Force in [[Manila]]. He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and [[training|trained]] pilots. For this reason, he decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. A group of 24 student pilots [[wikt:volunteer|volunteered]] for the mission. The Special Attack force was [[organization|organized]] into 4 groups, ''Unit Shikishima'', ''Unit Yamato'', ''Unit Asahi'', and ''Unit Yamazakura''. These names were taken from a [[patriotism|patriotic]] poem (''[[waka]]'' or ''[[tanka]]''), written by the Japanese [[wikt:classic|classic]]al poet, [[Motoori Norinaga]]:  (敷島の 大和心を 人問はば 朝日に匂う 山桜花). The poem reads:  " ''Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana''

 The Japanese were defeated at the battle of Leyte Gulf, but the Special Attack force had great success. The first ''kamikaze'' attack took place on October 21, 1944, against the [[flagship]] of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], HMAS ''Australia''. < ref > {{cite journal | author= Nichols, Robert | url=http://www.awm.gov.au/wartime/28/kamikaze-attack/ | title=The first kamikaze attack? | journal =Wartime |issue = 28 | publisher= Australian War Memorial | year=2004 | accessdate=April 23, 2012}} < /ref >  30 sailors died in the attack, including its [[Captain]] Emile Dechaineux, and many more were wounded. By October 26, 47 more Allied ships had been attacked. Most of them were badly damaged or sunk, like the United States aircraft carrier USS ''St. Lo''. < ref > {{cite book |last= Toland |first= John | year=1970 | title= The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 |url= https://archive.org/details/risingsundecline00tola |publisher= Random House |isbn= 978-0-8129-6858-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/risingsundecline00tola/page/567 567] }} < /ref > 
 
 This early success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the ''kamikaze'' attacks. Many more pilots were recruited to act as ''kamikaze''. Over the next few months, more than 2,000 planes made such attacks. When the Japanese [[stock]] of airplanes began to run low, new models of low quality were built for these missions. Some of them, like the Nakajima Ki-115 ''Tsurugi'', were made mostly of [[wood]] and used stocks of older [[engine]]s. The plane's [[landing gear]] was usually dropped by the pilot after [[takeoff]] so it could be used by other aircraft, because he would not be landing again. Similar suicide attack [[wikt:program|programs]] were planned, including [[rocket]] bombs with pilots (called ''[[Ohka]]'') and [[submarine]] [[torpedo]]es (''[[Kaiten]]''). 
 
 The high point of ''kamikaze'' attacks came from April 6 to May 25, 1945 during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in ''Operation Kikusui'' ('' " floating [[chrysanthemums]] " ''). In that time, seven important [[wave]]s of attacks took place, with more than 1,500 ''kamikaze'' planes. Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were poorly made, ''kamikaze'' pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots, who also had much better planes. But still, the ''kamikaze'' who escaped the [[anti-aircraft fire]] and the enemy [[fighter]] airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet. The Allies won the battle, but they lost many ships and men because of ''kamikaze'' attacks. By the end of the battle, at least 21 American ships had been sunk by ''kamikazes''. Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk, and dozens more were damaged. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq82-1.htm | title=''Casualties: U.S. Navy and Coast Guard Vessels, Sunk or Damaged Beyond Repair during World War II, 7 December 1941-1 October 1945'' | publisher=Naval Historical Center | accessdate=August 30, 2007 | archive-date=2 January 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102121523/http://www.history.navy.mil/FAQs/faq82-1.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Hundreds of extra ''kamikaze'' planes were ready to defend Japan from invasion. However, with Japan's surrender on August 15 after the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] and the declaration of war by the [[Soviet Union]], they were never used again. 
 
 == Effects == 
 The most important effect of the attacks was creating [[fear]] among the Allied troops. When the American ships went to the last battles, the [[crew]]s were very afraid of ''kamikaze'' pilots. By the end of World War II, the Japanese Navy had [[wikt:sacrifice|sacrifice]]d 2,525 ''kamikaze'' pilots, and the Air force had lost 1,387. The Japanese [[government]] said, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195. They also claimed that the ''kamikaze'' attacks were the cause of 80% of Allied deaths in the last years of the War. 
 
 The American [[wikt:source|source]]s claim that ''kamikaze'' sunk less ships than the Japanese say. But still, they agree that they did very important damage. According to a [[U.S. Air Force]] source, the ''kamikaze'' attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. < ref > {{cite web | author=Hallion, Richard P | url=https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/EARS/Hallionpapers/precisionweaponspower.htm | title=''Precision weapons, power projection and the revolution in military affairs'' | publisher=[[United States Air Force]] Historical Studies Office | accessdate=August 30, 2007 | archive-date=May 5, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505052709/https://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/EARS/Hallionpapers/precisionweaponspower.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In a 2010 book, the [[historian]] Robin Rielly said that about 60 U.S. ships were sunk by kamikazes, and over 400 were damaged by them. < ref > {{Cite book|author=Rielly, Robin L. |title=Kamikaze Attacks of World War II: A Complete History of Japanese Suicide Strikes on American Ships, by Aircraft and Other Means |publisher=McFarland |year=2010 |pages=317–324 |isbn=978-0-78644-654-4}} < /ref > 
 
 == Kamikaze beliefs == 
 [[File:Chiran high school girls wave kamikaze pilot.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[High school]] girls say [[wikt:farewell|farewell]] to Kamikaze pilots with [[cherry blossom]] [[branch]]es at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], on April 12, 1945.]] 
 
 Many ''kamikaze'' pilots offered themselves as volunteers for the mission. They were usually very young, between 18 and 24 years old. Their [[belief]] was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] down was a very [[honor]]able death. This [[principle]] was traditional since the days of the [[samurai]], and gave great importance to the sense of duty and [[wikt:obedience|obedience]]. This idea was called ''Giri'' ('' " Obligation " ''), and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the Middle Ages, the ''[[Bushido]]''. Many young men [[wikt:sacrifice|sacrifice]]d themselves by their [[free will]] because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for them. The ''tokkōtai'' pilot's [[:wikt:manual#Noun|manual]] told pilots to never close their eyes. This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target. < ref > {{cite book |last= Ohnuki-Tierney |first= Emiko |year=2006 |title= Kamikaze Diaries - Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-61951-4}} |pages=1-11  < /ref > < ref name= " Guardian " > {{cite news |author= Axell, Albert and Kase, Hideaki |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/07/japanese-kamikaze-pilots-second-world-war | date = September 7, 2009 |title=Advice to Japanese kamikaze pilots during the second world war |newspaper= The Guardian |publisher= Guardian News and Media Ltd }} < /ref >  In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to [[wikt:shout|shout]] '' " Hissatsu!

" '') as loud as he could. < ref > {{cite news |title=Advice to Japanese kamikaze pilots during the second world war |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/07/japanese-kamikaze-pilots-second-world-war |accessdate=30 July 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=7 September 2009}} < /ref > 
 
 However, many others did so because of [[social]] [[pressure]]. Not offering oneself as a volunteer was a sign of [[wikt:cowardice |cowardice]] and [[dishonor]]. Several professional pilots who were ordered to do suicide attacks did it because of military obedience, not because of honor. One of the first ''kamikaze'' pilots, [[Military#Ranks|Lieutenant]] Yukio Seki, wrote after nearly being forced to volunteer: 
 :''Japan's future is pale if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots. I am not going on this mission for the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] or for the Empire... I am going because I was ordered to.'' < ref > {{cite book |last= Axell |first= Albert |author2= Kase, Hideaki | year=2002 |title= Kamikaze: Japan's suicide gods |url= https://archive.org/details/kamikazejapanssu0000axel |publisher= New York: Longman |isbn= 0-582-77232-X}} | page=16  < /ref > 
 
 A special ceremony before going to combat usually took place. Pilots drank [[sake]] and ate a ball of [[rice]]. They were given [[medal]]s, and a [[katana]] [[sword]]. They put on a [[headband]] with the rising sun, and a ''sennibari'', a '' " belt of a thousand [[:wikt:stitch#Noun|stitch]]es " '' made by a thousand women, who made one stitch each. < ref > {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYdr87lYRGwC |title=Blossoms in the wind: human legacies of the Kamikaze |author=Sheftall, Mordecai G. |page=237 |year=2005 |publisher=NAL Caliber |isbn=978-0-45121-487-4 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Many times, they took [[prayer]]s written by their families with them. < ref > {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bYdr87lYRGwC |title= Japanese Infantryman 1937-45: Sword of The Empire |author= Rottman, Gordon L. and Welply, Michaël |page= 7 |year= 2005 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |isbn= 978-1-84176-818-2 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  According to [[legend]], young pilots on ''kamikaze'' missions many times [[flight|flew]] [[southwest]] from Japan over the 922-metre (~3000 & nbsp;ft) [[Mountain|Mount]] Kaimon. Suicide mission pilots looked over their [[shoulder]]s to see this, and said farewell to their country. Another legend says that ''kamikaze'' pilots dropped flowers from the air, as they departed on their final missions. Some places, like the hills near Kikajima [[airport]], are said to have beds of [[cornflower]] that [[wikt:simple:bloom|bloom]] in early May from those days. < ref > {{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WGjxAAAAMAAJ |title= The birth of the kamikaze |journal=The Minaret: The Islamic Magazine |publisher=Islamic Center of Southern California |year=2004 |volume=26 |issue=1–10 |page=31}} < /ref > 
 
 Some important [[military]] men who survived the war [[critic]]ized the ''kamikaze'' plan years after. [[Saburo Sakai]], a war time [[flying ace|ace]] pilot said: 
 :''A kamikaze is a [[wikt:surprise|surprise]] attack, according to our ancient war [[Military tactics|tactics]]. Surprise attacks will be successful the first time, maybe two or three times. But what fool would continue the same attacks for ten months? [[Emperor Showa|Emperor Hirohito]] must have realized it. He should have said  " Stop. "
