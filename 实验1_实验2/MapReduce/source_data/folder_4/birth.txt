 == Changes in pelvis during human pregnancy == 
 In adult females the [[pelvis]] is shaped differently from males. The differences are connected with allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal successfully. Also, during pregnancy, a [[hormone]] called [[relaxin]] softens the [[ligament]]s in the pelvis area. This produces a little bit of extra space for the baby's head to get through. The process is hard to describe in words, but fortunately there is an excellent video which explains what goes on.
