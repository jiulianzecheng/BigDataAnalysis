 == Geography == 
 === Location and environment === 
 Hockenheim is in the [[Upper Rhine Plain|Upper Rhine valley]]. It is on an old [[trade route]] that ran from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Basel]]. The [[river]] Kraichbach flows through the town, and divides Hockenheim in an eastern and a western area. Hockenheim covers 34.84 & nbsp;km². About 28.2 & nbsp;percent is used for [[Human#Habitats, settlements and population|settlement]] and [[transport]]ation. About 47.5 & nbsp;percent is used for [[Farming|agriculture]]. About 2.3 & nbsp;percent of the area are [[waterway]]s, and 21.1 & nbsp;percent are [[forest]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01515215GE226032 |title=Regionaldaten - Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg |date=2004-12-31 |accessdate=2011-07-28 |work=baden-wuerttemberg.de |publisher=Statistical Office of Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart |language=German }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 The town is divided into two large natural areas. The  " Rheinaue "  to the west and the  " Niederterrasse "  to the east. The  " Hockenheimer Rheinbogen "  is an area of the Rhine. 656 & nbsp;[[hectare]]s of the area is a [[Conservation biology|nature conservation]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.themenpark-umwelt.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/27196/?path=4422;6350;6706; & part=27207 & partId=12 |title=Hockenheimer Rheinbogen (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis): Pflanzen- und Tierwelt (Themenpark Umwelt) |accessdate=2011-07-28 |work=baden-wuerttemberg.de |publisher=Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy Baden-Wuerttemberg |language=German }} < /ref > 
 
 === Town structure === 
 The central urban area forms one unit. It is divided into five districts for [[Statistics|statistical]] reasons. 
 
 == History == 
 In 1984, an old brick [[kiln]] was found during an excavation in Hockenheim. The kiln had stamped bricks inside it from the [[Roman Empire]]. The Roman Legio XIV Gemina was near [[Mainz]] from 71 & nbsp;AD until 92 & nbsp;AD. The bricks indicate an early settlement in the Hockenheim area. < ref > {{cite book |title=Ton + Technik.

 Hockenheim was first mentioned 769 as  " Ochinheim "  in a document of the Lorsch Codex (a list of early [[monastery]] gifts). The name  " Hockenheim "  was first used in official documents in 1238. During the [[Middle Ages]], Hockenheim was owned by several local authorities. 
 
 [[Image:Hockenheim-1907.png|thumb|right|200px|Hockenheim and surroundings 1907]] 
 In the 17th century, Hockenheim was severely destroyed twice by [[France|French troops]]. In 1644 during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and in 1674 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. [[Tobacco]] was brought to the area by the French. During this time, the growing of [[hops]] started to be replaced with tobacco. In 1803 Hockenheim was merged into [[Baden]]. The tobacco crop grew well and prospered, and Hockenheim was awarded town rights on 22 July 1895. 
 
 At the beginning of the 20th century, [[asparagus]] growing replaced most of the remaining hops growing. On 29 May 1932 the [[Hockenheimring]] opened with a motorcycle race. In January 1973, Hockenheim was assigned to the new [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]] (district). 
 
 == Politics == 
 The town is led by the Lord Mayor ({{Lang|de| " Oberbürgermeister " }}). The Lord Mayer is elected every 8 years by the population. This office has been held by Dieter Gummer ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) since 2004. The local council of Hockenheim consists of 22 members, and the Lord Mayor presiding the council. 
 
 In 1975 the Hockenheim government agreed upon a [[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft|municipal association]] ({{Lang|de| " Verwaltungsgemeinschaft " }}) with the neighboring villages [[Altlußheim]], [[Neulußheim]] and [[Reilingen]]. 
 
 == Coat of arms == 
 Adopted in 1609, the [[coat of arms]] of Hockenheim has diagonally crossed silver hooks in a sign, below a crowned golden lion. The lion is the animal of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], to which Hockenheim belonged; the hooks are probably derived from the place name. The form of the symbols was changed several times, but has been specified in its current form by municipal law since 1895. 
 
 == Sport ==
