 == Legends == 
 After Sotoku's abdication and [[exile]], he devoted himself to a [[Monastery|monastic life]].  He copied numerous [[scriptures]] and offered them to the [[Court (royal)|court]].  Fearing that the scriptures were [[curse]]d, the court refused to accept them. < ref > Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1963). ''Vicissitudes of Shinto,'' p. 99. < /ref >  Snubbed, Sotoku was said to have resented the court and, upon his death, became an [[onryō]].  Everything from the fall in fortune of the Imperial court, the rise of the samurai powers, [[drought]]s and internal unrests were blamed on his [[wikt:haunt|haunt]]ing. 
 
 Other legends say he changed into an Ootengu (greater [[tengu]]). Along with [[nurarihyon]], the nine-tailed [[kitsune]] [[Tamamo-no-Mae]] and the [[oni (folklore)|oni]] [[Shuten-dōji]], they are often called the four greatest [[yōkai]] of Japan.
