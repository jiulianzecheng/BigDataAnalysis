The '''cnida''' is the basic term for the stinging apparatus of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. The whole life-style of the phylum is based on this device, which enables the animals to catch their [[prey]]. The cnida appears in several forms: the most usual is the '''nematocyst'''. < ref name= " Daly " > Daly, Marymegan ''et al'' 2007.

 Cnidae are [[organelle]]-like capsules with eversible tubules (they shoot the tubule outwards). < ref > Hessinger D.A.  &  Lenhoff H.M. (eds) 1988.  
  ''The biology of nematocysts''. San Diego: Academic Press. < /ref >  They are the diagnostic feature of the phylum. All cnidarians possess cnidae; no loss of the feature is known. 
 
 There are three main types of cnidae: nematocysts, ptychocysts, and spirocysts, with many variations. Depending on the species, one or more types may be on the organism. 
 
 #'''Nematocyst'''. This is the main type, present in all [[Anthozoa]]. It is a [[harpoon]]-like structure which holds and paralyses small prey. 
 #'''Ptychocyst'''. This puts out a sticky substance. This is used to hold on to prey, and to help make tubes for burrowing [[tube anemone]]s. 
 #'''Spirocyst'''. This is a lasso-like string that is fired at prey. It wraps around the prey. 
 
 The cell which produces the cnida is variously called a ''cnidocyte'', ''cnidoblast'', or ''nematocyte''. It is highly specialised for just one function. Each nematocyte cell contains an [[organelle]] with a hollow, coiled, thread-like structure. The outside of the cell has a hair-like trigger. When the trigger is touched, the shaft of the cnidocyst fires like a [[harpoon]]. It penetrates the prey, and the hollow thread comes with it. This takes no more than a few microseconds. After penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target. The rapid activity of the injected [[neurotoxin]]s [[paralysis|paralyzes]] the mobile prey, thus allowing the [[sessile]] cnidarian to devour it.

 Certain types of [[sea slug]]s, such as the [[nudibranch]] aeolids, store nematocysts from digested [[jellyfish]] at the tips of their cerata (body projections). It is quite common for predators to store useful [[plastids]] from their victims. < ref >  Rudman W.B. 1999. Cerata (ceras) in aeolids. ''Sea Slug Forum''. Australian Museum, Sydney.
