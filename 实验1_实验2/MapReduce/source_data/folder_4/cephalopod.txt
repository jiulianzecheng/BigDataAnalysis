 The '''Cephalopoda''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] meaning  " head-foot " ) is an important [[mollusc]] [[class (biology)|class]]. They have [[bilateral symmetry]], a head, and [[arm]]s or [[tentacle]]s. < ref > These are [[adaptation]]s of the basic mollusc foot. < /ref >  '''Teuthology''', a branch of [[malacology]], is the study of cephalopods. 
 
 The class has two living [[subclass (biology)|subclasses]]. In the [[Coleoidea]], the mollusc shell has become smaller, or is not there at all; this subclass has the [[octopus]], [[squid]], and [[cuttlefish]]. The ''Nautiloidea'' have a shell; ''[[Nautilus]]'' is its only living [[genus]]. 
 
 There are at least 800 different living [[species]] of Cephalopods. Two important [[extinct]] [[taxon|taxa]] are the [[ammonite]]s, and the belemnites (order ''Belemnoidea'', of class Coleoidea). Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of the world and at all [[pelagic]] levels. None of them can live in freshwater (water with no salt in it), but a few species live in brackish (partly salty) water.

 == Nervous system and behaviour == 
 Cephalopods are the most [[intelligence|intelligent]] [[invertebrate]]s and have good senses and large [[brain]]s. The [[nervous system]] of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates, and their brain to body mass ratio falls between that of warm and cold blooded vertebrates. < ref name= " JZ " > Marion Nixon  &  J.Z. Young 2003. ''The brains and lives of cephalopods''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-852761-6}}. < /ref >  The giant [[nerve]] fibers of the cephalopod [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] have been a favourite experimental material for many years; their large diameter makes them easier to study. 
 
 === Colour and light === 
 [[Image:Cuttlefish color.jpg|thumb|This Broadclub Cuttlefish (''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]] latimanus'') can go from blending tans and browns (top) to yellow with dark bits (bottom) in less than a second.]] 
 Most cephalopods have [[chromatophore]]s – that is, cells with different colours – which they can use in a number of surprising ways. < ref name=JZ/ >  As well as blending with their background, some cephalopods [[bioluminescence|bioluminesce]], shining light downwards to hide their shadows from any attackers. < ref name=JZ/ >  The bioluminescence is made by bacterial [[symbiosis|symbionts]]; the host cephalopod is able to find the light made by these animals. < ref > Tong D. Rozas S.; Oakley H.; Mitchell J.; Colley J.; Mcfall-Ngai J. 2009. Evidence for light perception in a bioluminescent organ. PNAS '''106''': 9836–9841. < /ref >  [[Bioluminescence]] may also be used to [[wikt:attract|attract]] prey, and some species use colourful shows to get mates, amaze predators, or even signal to one another. < ref name=JZ/ > 
 
 ==== Colouration ==== 
 Colouration can be changed in milliseconds as they adjust to their environment, < ref name=JZ/ >  and the pigment cells can expand or contract. < ref name= " encbrit " > ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD < /ref >  Rapid colour change is usually more common in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean. Those in open ocean mostly use [[camouflage]] to make their body outline less easy to see. < ref name=JZ/ > 
 
 Evidence of original colouration has been found in cephalopod fossils as far back as the Silurian; certain straight-shelled species had lines round their shell, which are thought to have used as camouflage of their body outline. < ref > {{cite journal|url =http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app20080062.html|title=Minute Silurian oncocerid nautiloids with unusual colour patterns

 === Moving around === 
 Cephalopods usually move by jet propulsion (squirting water). This uses a lot of energy to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. They use jet propulsion because they do not have fins or flippers. The efficiency of jet propulsion goes down with larger animals. This is probably the reason why many species use their fins or arms for moving if possible. 
 
 Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s. By contracting the mantle's muscles, the water is pushed out through the siphon, made by a fold in the mantle. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out forwards, but the siphon can be pointed in different directions. Some cephalopods can adjust their body shape to move through the water more easily. 
 
 Some octopus species are also able to walk along the sea bed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by moving a flap of [[muscle]] around the mantle.

 == Blood == 
 Like most molluscs, cephalopods use [[haemocyanin]], a copper-containing protein, rather than [[haemoglobin]] to transport oxygen.  As a result, their blood is colourless when deoxygenated and turns blue when placed in air. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Ghiretti-Magaldi A.|last2=Ghiretti F.|year=1992|title=The pre-history of hemocyanin: the discovery of copper in the blood of molluscs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01919143|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|publisher=Birkhäuser Basel|volume=48|issue=10|pages=971–972|doi=10.1007/BF01919143|s2cid=33290596}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} < /ref > 
 
 == Reproduction and life cycle == 
 With a few exceptions, Coleoideans live short lives with fast growth. Most of the energy from their food is used for growing. The [[penis]] in most male Coleoidea is a long and muscular end of the [[vas deferens]] (tube for sperms) used to transfer [[spermatophore]]s (sperm packages) to a modified arm called a [[hectocotylus]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/103036/cephalopod/35760/Natural-history|title=cephalopod|author=Gilbert L. Voss|date=27 September 2013|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}} < /ref >  That in turn is used to transport the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the penis is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. The females lay many small eggs in one batch, and die afterwards. The Nautiloidea, on the other hand make a few large eggs in each batch, and live for a long time. 
 
 == Evolution == 
 The class developed during the late [[Cambrian]] and were the most common and varied marine life forms during the [[Palaeozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] [[era]]s. ''Tommotia'', an early cephalopod, had [[squid]]-like tentacles but also a [[snail]]-like foot it used to move across the sea floor. Early cephalopods were at the top of the food chain. 
 
 The old (cohort Belemnoidea) and [[wikt:modern|modern]] (cohort Neocoleoidea) coleoids, as well as the ammonoids, all diverged (evolved away) from the external shelled nautiloids during the middle Paleozoic Era, between 450 and 300 million years ago. Most ancient varieties had [[wikt:protect|protective]] shells. These shells at first were conical but later developed into the curved shapes seen in modern [[nautilus]] species. Shells inside the body still exist in many living cephalopod groups, such as [[cuttlefish]]. The most famous group with external shells, the [[ammonite]]s, became extinct at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.
