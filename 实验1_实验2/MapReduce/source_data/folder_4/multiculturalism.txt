'''Multiculturalism''' is a word that describes a [[society]] where many different [[culture]]s live together. It is the simple fact of cultural diversity. 
 
 In a '''multicultural''' society, there is not an official (decided by the people in charge) culture that every person must be a part of. Instead, all cultures are respected as much as each other. 
 
 A multicultural society can result when people from many different countries [[human migration|migrate]] to one place, or an [[empire]] conquers many countries. [[Tolerance]] is a big help for multiculturalism. [[Xenophobia]] makes it difficult.  
 
 A multicultural society would be composed of people from different ethnic backgrounds and cultures living and working together. In society when people from different backgrounds link with each other's culture shows the acceptance of each other's culture and background.
