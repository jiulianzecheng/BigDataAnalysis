Very often, this is the case with a [[family]], but this need not be the case. People living in the same household profit, because they can share some of the [[Expense|expenses]]. 
 
 It is an important concept in [[social security]]. People in the same household are expected to support each other. Benefits for the poor are generally based on  households.
