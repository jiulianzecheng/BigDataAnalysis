 Historically, the word  " Kurdistan "  is first attested in 11th century [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] chronicles.{{sfn|Mitchell|2010}} Many disparate [[List of Kurdish dynasties and countries|Kurdish dynasties, emirates, principalities, and chiefdoms]] were established from the 8th to 19th centuries. Administratively, the 20th century saw the establishment of the short-lived areas of the [[Kurdish state (1918–1919)|Kurdish state]] (1918–1919), [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] (1921–1924), [[Kurdistansky Uyezd]] i.e.  " Red Kurdistan "  (1923–1929), [[Republic of Ararat]] (1927–1930), and [[Republic of Mahabad]] (1946). 
 
 Iraqi Kurdistan first gained autonomous status in a 1970 agreement with the Iraqi government, and its status was re-confirmed as the autonomous [[Kurdistan Region]] within the federal Iraqi republic in 2005. < ref > Iraqi Constitution, Article 113. < /ref >  There is also a [[Kurdistan Province]] in Iran, but it is not self-ruled. Kurds fighting in the [[Syrian Civil War]] were able to take control of large sections of northern Syria and establish [[Regions of Rojava|self-governing regions]] in an [[Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria]] (commonly called Rojava), where they seek autonomy in a [[Federalization of Syria|federal Syria]] after the war. < ref > {{cite news |title=Kurds seek autonomy in democratic Syria |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19291072 |date=16 August 2012}} < /ref >
