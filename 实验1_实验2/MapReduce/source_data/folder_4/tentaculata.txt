 '''Tentaculata''' is a class of [[Ctenophore|comb jellies]]. The common feature of this class is a pair of long, feathery, contractile [[tentacle]]s, which can be retracted into specialised ciliated sheaths. In some species, the primary tentacles are reduced and they have smaller, secondary tentacles. The tentacles have colloblasts, which are sticky-tipped cells that trap small prey.
