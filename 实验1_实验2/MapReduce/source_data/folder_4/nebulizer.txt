A nebulizer is a small machine that creates a mist out of liquid medication, allowing for quicker and easier absorption of medication into the lungs.  Typically, nebulizers come in both electric or battery-run versions, and are either portable or meant to sit on a table and plug into a wall. < ref > [https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma-nebulizer-machine What is a nebulizer?] < /ref > 
 
 It is also used for the patients with runny nose or nasal stroke. A nebulizer delivers liquid medication via pressurized air. While individuals with asthma typically use both nebulizers and inhalers, occasionally, a nebulizer may be easier to use â€” especially when it comes to young children who may not have the proper technique for an inhaler. 
 
 A nebulizer is helpful for a variety of conditions, including: 
 
 * [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) 
 * [[Asthma]] 
 * [[Bronchiectasis]] 
 * [[Cystic fibrosis]] 
 * [[Pulmonary fibrosis]] 
 
 == Types of nebulizers == 
 There are three main types of nebulizers: < ref > [https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/home-nebulizer-therapy Types of nebulizers] < /ref > 
 
 * '''Jet nebulizers''' make an aerosol out of medications using a compressed gas (like air). These are the most common type of nebulizers. 
 * '''Ultrasonic nebulizers''' make an aerosol via high-frequency vibrations. These are more commonly used in hospitals and typically are not for personal use. 
 * '''Mesh nebulizers''' use a mesh cap with tiny holes that help dispense medication in a very efficient way. These nebulizers are newer and often more effective than jet nebulizers.
