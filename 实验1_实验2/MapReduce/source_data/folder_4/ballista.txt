 The ballista resembled a large crossbow. They were made in different sizes. Smaller ones threw smaller missiles such as scaled-up arrows and darts. 
 
 The steps to operating the ballista are: 
 # Pull back the bow-string with a winch, which creates tension. 
 # Load the ballista with a light missile e.g. darts with iron points. 
 # Release the bow-string, launching the missile. 
 
 Ballistae would be used if a weapon that fired light, narrow ammunition was needed.
