 An '''injunction''' is a [[court order]] that either [[wikt:command|command]]s or [[wikt:prevent|prevent]]s a party from doing a specific act. < ref > {{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is an Injunction|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/what-injunction|website=ExpertLaw|access-date=24 July 2017|date=10 October 2016|archive-date=9 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409020404/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/what-injunction|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == US law == 
 Injunctions can be [[wikt:temporary|temporary]] or [[wikt:permanent|permanent]]. A [[restraining order]] and a preliminary injunction are [[example]]s of temporary injunctions. < ref > {{cite web|title=Injunction|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/injunction|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|access-date=24 July 2017}} < /ref >  Either may be issued early in a [[lawsuit]] to prevent either party from doing anything that might unfairly influence the outcome of the [[litigation]]. A permanent injunction is usually issued after a case is settled. It enforces the final decision of the [[court]]. 
 
 ==Australian apprehended violence orders== 
 In the state of [[New South Wales]], an apprehended violence order (AVO) may be issued against a person from whom another person fears violence. < ref name=NSW > {{cite web |url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/apprehended-violence-orders-applicants |title=Apprehended Violence Orders |publisher=NSW Government |access-date=26 October 2015 |archive-date=22 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022232546/http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/apprehended-violence-orders-applicants |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They can be issued to prevent [[physical abuse]], [[harass]]ment or [[stalking]]. Any person who violates an AVO may be charged with a [[wikt:criminal|criminal]] [[wikt:offence|offence]]. < ref name=NSW/ > 
 
 == UK injunctions and super-injunctions == 
 While the [[United Kingdom]] has injunctions much the same as other [[countries]] they also have super-injunctions. This is an injunction (sometimes called a [[gag-order]]) that prevents [[journalist]]s from writing anything about a [[court case]]. < ref name=TaylorBI > {{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-super-injunction-ryan-giggs-2010-5 |title=What Is A Super-Injunction, And Why Does A UK Football Star Want To Sue Twitter? |author=Adam Taylor |date=23 May 2011 |website=Business Insider |access-date=26 October 2015}} < /ref >  It also prevents them from reporting that the injunction itself has been issued. < ref name=TaylorBI/ >  If any injunction in the [[UK]] prevents details of the order from being known it is also called a super-injunction. 
 
 == Anti-suit injunctions == 
 In [[common law countries]] anti-suit injunctions are court orders used to prevent a court or tribunal from assuming [[jurisdiction]] or taking over an ongoing lawsuit. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/turkey/x/382468/trials+appeals+compensation/AntiSuit+Injunctions+In+International+Arbitration |title=Turkey: Anti-Suit Injunctions In International Arbitration |publisher=Mondaq |access-date=26 October 2015}} < /ref >  An anti-suit injunction may also be used to prevent a party from filing a second lawsuit in another jurisdiction at the same time as the first case. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2011/11/14/barring-the-courthouse-door-anti-suit-injunctions-in-international-arbitration/ |title=Barring the Courthouse Door?
