 '''Drunkenness''' means being [[intoxication|intoxicated]] by [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]].  This means a person's [[brain]] and body are not working normally, because of the alcohol they have had.  A person who is intoxicated is usually called ''drunk''.    
 
 The effects of being drunk depend on how much alcohol a person has had to drink. < ref name=cdc/ > 
 
 ==Effects== 
 Alcohol causes the mind and body to not work normally. 
 
 In low amounts, alcohol often causes [[euphoria|good feelings]], reddened skin, and feeling [[relaxation|relaxed]].  People who drink small amounts of alcohol may feel less nervous about being around others.  Even in small amounts, alcohol slows down the [[brain]]. Alcohol interferes with normal brain communication and changes a person’s behavior and mood. The ability to think clearly is often inhibited,. Consuming larger amounts of  alcohol can drastically affect motor functions via its effects on the brain. Commonly seen effects on the brain and the rest of the central nervous system (CNS) include slurred speech and issues with coordination. It starts to affect a person's judgment - their ability to make good decisions.  It also makes a person react more slowly and have slower [[reflex]]es.  This is why it is [[Drunk driving|not safe to drive]] even after drinking just a little. < ref name=cdc > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/impaired_driving/bac.html |title=Effects of Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=August 17, 2015 |website=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention |publisher=[[CDC|United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > < ref name=ca > {{cite web |url=http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/stopteendui/teens/resources/substances/alcohol/short-and-long-term-effects.cfm |title=Short- and Long-Term Effects |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2016 |website= |publisher=State of California – Administrative Office of the Courts |accessdate=February 25, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >

They may get [[Mental confusion|confused]] or [[Lethargy|very tired]].  They will not be able to make good decisions.  They may also start [[vomit]]ing. < ref name=cdc/ > < ref name=ca/ >
