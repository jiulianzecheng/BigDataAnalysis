 A '''heterotroph''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''heteros'' = another and ''trophe'' = nutrition) is an [[organism]] that requires [[organic compound|organic]] [[substrate]]s to get its [[carbon]] for growth and development. 
 
 == In food chains == 
 A heterotroph is known as a '''consumer''' in the [[food chain]]. Consumers are organisms that cannot make their own food supply. They use the food that producers make, or they eat other organisms. Animals are consumers. To stay alive, consumers must get food from other organisms. There are three types of consumers:Herbivores, Carnivores, and Omnivores. < ref name=Consume > {{cite book |title= Blue Planet|last= English through Science|author-link= Dinorah Pous|year=2003 |publisher= McGrawHill|isbn= 007-125034-4}} < /ref > 
 
 === Herbivores === 
 Consumers that only eat plants are called herbivores. The word herbivore comes from the Latin words ''herba'', which means  " grass or herb, "  and ''vorare'', which means  " to eat. "   < ref name=Consume/ >  A [[giraffe]] is an example of a herbivorous consumer. 
 
 === Carnivores === 
 Consumers that only eat animals are called carnivores. The word comes from the Latin ''carnis'', which means  " flesh " , and ''vorare'', which means  " to eat. "  A [[tiger]] is an example of a carnivorous consumer. < ref name=Consume/ > 
 
 === Omnivores === 
 Consumers that eat both plants and animals are called omnivores. The word comes from the Latin ''omnis'', which means  " all "  and ''vorare''. Humans are a good example of an omnivorous consumer. < ref name=Consume/ >
