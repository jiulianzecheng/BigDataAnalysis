 '''Prometheus''' is a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] in [[Greek mythology]]. He is the son of [[Iapetus]] and [[:en:Asia_(mythology)|Clymene]]. He created humans, originally made out of gold. He also stole [[fire]] from [[Zeus]] and gave it to [[human]]s. As [[punishment]], Zeus had Prometheus [[chain]]ed to a [[mountain]]. Every [[day]] an [[eagle]] (symbol of Zeus) would come and eat his [[liver]]. Prometheus is [[immortal]], so he never died, and his liver grew back every night. But he still felt great [[pain]]. 
 
 After a long time, Zeus sent his son [[Heracles]] to free Prometheus by breaking the chains which held him. 
 
 [[Aeschylus]] wrote a play about Prometheus.
