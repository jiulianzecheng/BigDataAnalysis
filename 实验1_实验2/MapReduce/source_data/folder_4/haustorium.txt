 A '''haustorium''' (plural: ''haustoria'') is a term in [[botany]]. It is a root-like structure which attaches to a tree or other plant host. [[Fungi]] and [[parasitic]] plants like [[mistletoe]] use haustoria to get [[nutrients]] from hosts. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Szabo|first1=Les|title=Hidden robbers: The role of fungal haustoria in parasitism of plants|journal=PNAS|date=July 3, 2001|volume=98|issue=14|pages=7654â€“7655|doi=10.1073/pnas.151262398|pmid=11438718|pmc=35395|bibcode=2001PNAS...98.7654S|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 Contrast with the term [[epiphyte]], which means  " living on " . Many other plants live on large trees, but only a few have hausteria.
