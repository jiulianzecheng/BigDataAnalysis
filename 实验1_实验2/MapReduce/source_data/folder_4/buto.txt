'''Buto''' or '''Butos''' or '''Butosos''', < ref > {{lang-el|Βοῦτος}}, [[Herodotus|Herod.]] ii. 59, 63, 155; {{lang|el|Βουτώ}}, Stephanus of Byzantium ''s. v.'' < /ref >  was the later, Greek name for an ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] city  95 & nbsp;km east of [[Alexandria]] in the [[Nile Delta]] of [[Egypt]]. It is the modern ''Kem Kasir''. 
 
 == History == 
 Buto originally was two cities, [[Pe]] and [[Dep]], which merged into one city that the Egyptians named '''''Per-Wadjet'''''.  The goddess [[Wadjet]] was its local goddess, often represented as a [[cobra]], and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt. 
 
 The city was an important site in [[Ancient Egypt]] since more than ten thousand years. Archaeological evidence shows that [[Upper Egypt]]ian culture replaced the Buto-culture at the delta when Upper and [[Lower Egypt]] were unified. 
 
 == Uses == 
 The Greek historians told that town was celebrated for its [[temple]] and [[oracle]] of the goddess Wadjet. < ref > Herod. ii. 155; Aelian. ''V. Hist.'' ii. 41 < /ref > 
 They also told that at Buto there was also a sanctuary of [[Horus]].
