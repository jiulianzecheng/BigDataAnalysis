 '''Cumae''' was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] settlement in [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]]. It was settled in 740 BC, and is the first Greek [[colony]] on the Italian mainland. < ref > [[Titus Livius]] 8, 22, 5–6: ''{{lang|la|Cumani Chalcide Euboica originem trahunt. Classe, qua advecti ab domo fuerant, multum in ora maris eius quod accolunt potuere, primo  < in >  insulas Aenariam et Pithecusas egressi, deinde in continentem ausi sedes transfere.}}'' „The Cumaeans came from Chalkis, on Euboa. Because of their fleet, with which they came from home, they had a lot of influence alonf the coast of the sea, on which they lived. First they went to the islands of Ainaria  and Pithekoussai,later they dared move their home to the mainland. " < /ref >  The same group had founded Pithekoussai, on the island of [[Ischia]], in 770 BC. Later they founded other cities, namely Dikaiarcheia (modern-day [[Pozzuoli]], and Neapolis ([[Naples]]).
