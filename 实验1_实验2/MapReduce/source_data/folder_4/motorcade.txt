 A '''motorcade''' (or '''convoy''', '''carcade''', '''autocade''') is a number of vehicles driving in the same direction on official business.  
 
 == Uses of motorcades == 
 === VIPs === 
 {{see|Official state car}} 
 Motorcades can be used to transport a [[very important person]] (VIP), usually a political figure. Such a motorcade is usually accompanied by police cars and other protection. This is to make sure the people in the motorcade are safe. For instance, motorcades for presidents often have four to six [[armoured car]]s, with police [[motorcycle]]s and cars going in front and behind. 
 
 Depending on the size of the motorcade and who it is carrying, streets may be completely blocked off so no-one else can use them. This is common for the security of heads of state or government.
