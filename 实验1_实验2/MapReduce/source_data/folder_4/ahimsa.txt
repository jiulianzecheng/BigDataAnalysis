 '''Ahimsa''' (also ahiṃsā, ahinsa, [[Sanskrit]]:अहिम्स) is a Sanskrit word which means  " [[nonviolence|non-violence]]” or  " non-injury " . The practice of ahimsa is an important aspect of religions like [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. A person who practices ahimsa generally eats vegetarian foods. A religious person who practices ahimsa does not take part in animal sacrifice. 
 
 In twentieth century, [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King]] each followed a path of Ahimsa, though in different ways. They struggled without fighting, while asking for the rights of their followers. 
 
 ==Buddhism== 
 The concept of ahiṃsā forms the base of [[Buddhism]]. In Buddhism, the first of the five basic vows (''precepts'') that are undertaken voluntarily by those who practice, is  " I undertake the training rule to abstain from killing " . In Buddhism, killing any living being out of passion is considered 'hiṃsā' (injury) and abstaining from such act is 'ahiṃsā' (non-injury or nonviolence).
