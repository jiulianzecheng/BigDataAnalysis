 '''Shellfish''' is a culinary term for some aquatic [[invertebrate]]s used as [[food]]: [[mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. It is not a scientific term, and its use may vary from place to place. 
 
 Both saltwater and freshwater invertebrates are considered shellfish. < ref > See the Maryland Department of the Environment's page [http://textonly.mde.state.md.us/CitizensInfoCenter/FishandShellfish/harvesting_notices/index.asp] for a discussion on why shrimp, crab, and lobster are not categorized as  " shellfish. " < /ref >  Molluscs commonly used as food include the [[clam]], [[mussel]], [[oyster]], [[Periwinkle (mollusc)|winkle]], and [[scallop]]. 
 
 Some crustaceans commonly eaten are the [[shrimp]], [[prawn]], [[lobster]], [[crayfish]], and [[crab]]. 
 
 Echinoderms are not eaten as commonly as molluscs and crustaceans. In [[Asia]], [[sea cucumber]] and [[sea urchin]]s are eaten. 
 
 Edible [[cephalopod]]s such as [[squid]], [[octopus]], and [[cuttlefish]] and terrestrial [[snail]]s, though all molluscs, are sometimes considered to be shellfish and sometimes not. 
 
 The term ''finfish'' is sometimes used to distinguish ordinary (vertebrate) [[fish]] from shellfish. 
 
 [[Jew]]ish and [[halal|Islamic]] dietary laws forbid the eating of shellfish (those that live on the land, and in the water). 
 
 In [[Japanese cuisine]], chefs often use shellfish and their [[roe]]. [[Sushi]] and [[sashimi]] feature both raw and cooked shellfish.
