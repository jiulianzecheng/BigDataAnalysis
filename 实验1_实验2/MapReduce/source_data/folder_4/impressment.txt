 '''Impressment'''  ('''the Press''') was the act of forcing men to serve in the [[navy]].  The people who were  " pressed "  to join the navy were usually young men.  A naval [[officer]] would lead a '''press gang''' and force men onto [[warship]]s where they were made to serve as [[sailor]] < nowiki/ > s.  Their families (if they had families) seldom knew where they had been taken. 
 
 This was a normal practice in the [[Royal Navy]] during the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries.  Many people said that it should be stopped, but the Navy said it was a good way to get sailors who were needed to defend their country.  After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the need for sailors was less and the Navy stopped impressing them.
