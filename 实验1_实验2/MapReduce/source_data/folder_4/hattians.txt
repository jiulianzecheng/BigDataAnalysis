'''Hattians''' were an ancient people who inhabited the land of Hatti. 
 
 == History == 
 " Land of the ''Hatti'' "  is the oldest known name for central [[Anatolia]], albeit as an exonym in extraneous sources, such as the Assyrian ''hatti matu'', found on Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] tablets from the period of Sargon the Great of [[Akkad]] c. 2350â€“2150 & nbsp;BC; on those tablets Assyrian-Akkadian traders implored King Sargon for help.
