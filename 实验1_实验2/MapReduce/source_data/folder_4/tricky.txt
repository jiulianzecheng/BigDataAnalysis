 Tricky was born in [[Knowle West]], [[Bristol]], [[England]]. His father left the family before he was born and his mother, Maxine Quaye, committed [[suicide]] when he was only four. He named his solo album after her - ''Maxinquaye'' - and once said that though he hardly knew her, he feels like she's speaking through him with his words. < ref > {{Cite web
