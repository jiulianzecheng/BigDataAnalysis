 The '''mesencephalon''' or '''midbrain''' is a part of the [[brain stem]]. < ref > Mosbyâ€™s Medical, nursing and allied health dictionary. 4th ed, Mosby-Year Book 1994. p981 < /ref >  It is associated with [[vision]], [[hearing]], motor control, sleep/wake, arousal ([[wikt:alertness|alertness]]), and temperature regulation. < ref > Breedlove, Watson,  &  Rosenzweig 2010. ''Biological psychology''. 6th ed. 45-46 < /ref >   
 
 In the [[anatomy]] of developing animals, the [[brain]] forms from the [[neural tube]], which turns into three [[vesicle]]s. The mesencephalon (midbrain) is the middle vesicle, and becomes part of the [[brain stem]].  
 
 The mesencephalon is ancient in origin, meaning its general [[architecture]] is shared with the most ancient of [[vertebrate]]s. [[Dopamine]] produced in the ''substantia nigra'' plays a role in [[wikt:motivation|motivation]] and [[habituation]] of species from humans to [[insect]]s.
