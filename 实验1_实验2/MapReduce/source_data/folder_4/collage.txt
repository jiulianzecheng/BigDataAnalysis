 '''Collage''' is an [[art]] term. It is a work of art like a [[painting]] but with pieces of [[paper]] and [[fabric]] ('found objects') stuck on a surface such as a piece of paper, wood or canvas.  
 
 Collage is a popular technique in [[modern art]]. Types of collage are 'decoupage', [[photomontage]] and digital collage. When actual painting is included, or any other medium, the technique is called 'mixed media'. Work in three dimensions may be called 'assemblage'.
