 A '''plastic''' is a [[material]] that can change its shape easily. Many things are made of plastics, usually because making them to the right shape is easy. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard.  Others are [[thermoplastic]] and can be softened by heating them. These plastics can be used for [[3D printing]], because the plastic will become soft enough to form into different shapes, and then become hard again when they cool down.   
 
 Most plastics are [[man-made]]; they do not occur in nature. The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called ''plastic'' are [[polymer]]s. Polymers are long chains of [[atoms]] bonded to each other. In most plastics, the long chain is a chain of [[carbon]] atoms with other atoms attached to them. The different atoms and the shape and length of the chains change how the plastic looks and works.  
 
 People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time. [[Alexander Parkes]], an English inventor (1813-1890), created an early form of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent. He called it  " Parkesine "  but now it is called  " [[Celluloid]]. " 
 
 Old plastics are usually thrown away and put in [[landfill]]s. Some plastics release toxic fumes when heated. Some plastics are [[Recycling|recycled]] so they won't become waste. Some plastics have other materials added to them, like [[glass]], because they make the plastic stronger and stiffer. 
 
 Plastics are mostly [[petrochemical]]s, made from [[natural gas]] or from [[petroleum]], a type of [[oil]]. [[Chemical engineer]]s refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]], which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These [[chemicals]] are then combined with other chemicals to produce a [[polymer]]. 
 
 Today, some of these plastics are also being made without oil. Instead, other sources like [[Plant|plants]] and [[bacteria]] are used to make the plastic. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Biello|first=David|title=Plastic from Plants: Is It an Environmental Boon or Bane?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-plastic-from-plants-good-for-the-environment-or-bad/|access-date=2021-06-09|website=Scientific American|language=en}} < /ref >  These plastics are called [[bioplastics]]. They are useful because they can be eaten by other bacteria instead of throwing them away. 
 
 == Well-known plastics, and their use == 
 * Polyamide (usually called [[nylon]]) {{ndash}} Women's [[stocking]]s, gears, car parts, toothbrush bristles 
 * [[Polycarbonate]] – [[bulletproof glass]], [[compact disc]]s, [[DVD]]s. 
 * [[Polyethylene]] – tubes, [[bottle]] < nowiki/ > s, shopping bags, milk jugs, body armor (made with polyethylene with especially long chains) 
 * [[Polyethylene terephtalate]] (called PET when used for [[bottle]]s, and polyester when used for [[clothes]] or other materials) 
 * [[Polypropylene]] - food containers, chairs 
 * [[Polystyrene]] - CD cases, plastic cups, plastic forks and knives 
 * [[Polyurethane]] - rubber, foam, shiny coatings on wood and tile 
 * [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (called PVC, usually) - pipes (chemicals can make PVC softer for toys and cushions) 
 * [[Polylactic acid]] (PLA) - [[3D printing]]
