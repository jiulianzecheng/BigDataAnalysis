 The '''horsetails''' are a [[Class (biology)|class]] in the [[Pteridophyta]] (ferns). They were one of the most important plant groups in the [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]].   
 
 For over 100 million years they were varied, and dominated the understorey of late Paleozoic forests. They are seen in the [[coal measures]] of the [[Carboniferous]] period, and some were trees reaching up 30 metres. < ref > Pryer K.M. ''et al'' 2004.

''American Journal of Botany'' '''91''': 1582-1598 (available [http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/91/10/1582 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223530/http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/91/10/1582 |date=2007-09-26 }}; pdf file) < /ref >  The group is now almost [[extinction|extinct]], but one [[genus]] survives. They are [[vascular plant]]s that reproduce by [[spore]]s and not by [[seed]]s. The name ''horsetail'' came because the branched species somewhat look like a horse's tail. 
 
 == ''Equisetum'' == 
 Modern horsetails first appeared during the [[Jurassic period]]. 
 '''''Equisetum''''' is the only living genus of horsetails. The name ''Equisetum'' comes from the [[Latin]] (''equus'' = horse; and ''seta'' = bristle). < ref > Other names include '''candock''' (applied to branching species only), and '''scouring-rush''' (applied to the unbranched or sparsely branched species). The latter name refers to the plants' [[Juncaceae|rush]]-like appearance; the stems are coated with abrasive [[silica]], which made them useful for cleaning ( " scouring " ) cooking pots in the past. < /ref >  The genus includes 15 [[species]]. 
 
 Horsetails are [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] on all continents except [[Australasia]] and [[Antarctica]]. They are [[perennial plant]]s. They are either [[herb]]aceous (they die back in winter  
 like most temperate species) or they are [[evergreen]] (some tropical species, and some temperate species). They mostly grow 0.2-1.5 m tall, though ''E. telmateia'' can reach 2.5 m, and the tropical [[Americas|American]] species ''E. giganteum'' 5 m, and ''E. myriochaetum'' 8 m.

 [[File:Equisetopsida.jpg|thumb|How they usually look.]] 
 In these plants the [[Leaf|leaves]] are very small, in [[whorl]]s joined together to make sheaths around the [[Plant stem|stem]]. The stems are green and [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]], also distinctive in being hollow, jointed and ridged, usually with 6-40 ridges. There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes; when present, these branches are identical to the main stem except smaller. 
 
 The spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like structures at the tips of some of the stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. ''E. arvense'', field horsetail) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in Springtime.
