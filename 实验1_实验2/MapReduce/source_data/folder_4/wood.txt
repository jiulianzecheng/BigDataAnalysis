 '''Wood''' is the main substance in [[tree]]s. It is mainly formed by the [[xylem]] vessels which carry water up the plant. The two main substances in wood are [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. Wood is used to make [[building]]s and [[furniture]], and also for [[art]]. [[Firewood]] is a fuel. [[Paper]] is made from [[wood fibre]]s. Wood is a [[renewable resource]] although it has become scarcer in recent centuries. Its origin is about 425 million years ago. < ref > Labandeira C. 2007. The origin of herbivory on land: Initial patterns of plant tissue consumption by arthropods. ''Insect Science''. '''14''' (4): 259–275. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2007.00152.x] < /ref > 
 
 Wood is hard to cut, but it is also strong. A [[lumberjack]] is a person who cuts down trees. After a tree falls, the wood in it can be cut into long, straight pieces called [[lumber]]. Lumber can then be used to make [[wikt:post|posts]], or put together with [[nail]]s, [[screw]]s, or even [[glue]] to make wooden [[frame]]s for other shapes. 
 
 Wood comes in many different kinds. [[Oak]], [[maple]] (hardwood) and [[pine]] and redwood (softwood) are widely used types of wood. Woods are usually divided into [[softwood]] (from [[conifers]]) and [[hardwood]] from [[flowering plants]]. < ref > Jane F.W. 1970.'' The structure of wood''. 2nd ed, edited by K. Wilson  &  D.J.B.

 == Housing == 
 For a long time and even today, many [[building]]s, mostly [[house]]s, have been made of wood. To build a house with wood, lumber is put together into frames that are the shape of each wall, floor, and roof of the house. Then the frames are placed into the shape of a house. Then the frames can be covered to make solid walls. Sometimes the walls are made of more wood. 
 
 When the outside of a house or building is covered in wood, the wooden pieces are usually flat and stacked. These pieces are called [[shingle]]s. Wood is also sometimes used in other parts of the house, like [[door]]s and [[staircase]]s. Wood is also used to make [[fence]]s. 
 
 == Carpentry ==

 [[Carpenter]]s make houses of mostly soft wood such as pine. For many kinds of [[furniture]] they use harder wood such as maple or oak. When someone builds something with wood, they often [[paint]] it. Paint protects and beautifies the wood. Some people like the look of wood, so they put [[transparent|clear]] paint called ''[[varnish]]'' on it. This helps to protect the wood and gives it a shiny finish. 
 
 Some people make [[art]] with wood. Sometimes [[sculpture]]s are built with wood: see [[Grinling Gibbons]]. 
 
 Regular [[pencil]]s are made of wood. Inside is the  " [[lead]] " , which is not actually lead. [[Clay]] or [[wax]] and [[graphite]] form the  " lead "  in a pencil. 
 
 == Paper == 
 Wood is turned into [[paper]] in large [[factory|factories]] called [[paper mill]] < nowiki/ > s.  Heat, chemicals and machines separate the [[cellulose]] fibers from other parts and press the fibers into paper.
