 '''Cleisthenes''' < ref > {{Lang-el|Κλεισθένης}}; and Kleisthenes is a good spelling of the name in English. The Greek alphabet has no 'C', and the Latin alphabet had no 'K'. From this we see that any Greek word containing a 'C' has been 'translated' into Latin, or an Italic language. The last 'e' in the name is a long e, and this is sometimes written as Kleisthenês. < /ref >  was a noble [[Athens|Athenian]] of the Alcmaeonid family. He reformed the constitution of [[Athens]], and set it on a [[democracy|democratic]] footing in 508/7 BC. < ref > Ober, Josiah 2007.

 With help from the his clan, he overthrew [[Hippias]] the [[tyrant]] (dictatorial ruler). After the collapse of Hippias' tyranny, [[Isagoras]] and Cleisthenes were rivals for power. Isagoras won the upper hand by appealing to the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes I]] to help him expel Cleisthenes. 
 
 So Cleisthenes left Athens as an exile, and Isagoras held power in the city. Isagoras uprooted hundreds of people from their homes on the pretext that they were cursed, and attempted to dissolve the Council (βουλή, boulé). However, the Council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support of it. Hence Isagoras and his supporters were forced to flee to the [[Acropolis]], remaining besieged there for two days. On the third, they fled and were banished. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and he assumed leadership of Athens. < ref > Aristotle, ''Constitution of the Athenians'', Chapter 20 < /ref >
