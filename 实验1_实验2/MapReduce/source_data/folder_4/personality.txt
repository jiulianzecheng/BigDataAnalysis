{{otheruses}}'''Personality''' is a term that describes the [[trait]]s a [[person]] shows consistently, such as how they think, act and respond to emotions as well as their likes and dislikes.  
 
 These traits are shown at different times and in different situations.  Understanding someoneâ€™s personality may allow you to predict their [[behavior]] in many situations.  Predictability makes it possible to explain and understand behavior.  A person's personality can often suggest their [[self-awareness|internal]] [[Cognition|thoughts]], [[Emotion|feelings]], and behaviors.  Intrapersonal functioning is a term used to describe the stable processes that underlie these thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Gordon Allport defined personality as a  " dynamic organization inside a person, of psychophysical systems that create the person's characteristic patterns of behavior, thoughts and feelings.
