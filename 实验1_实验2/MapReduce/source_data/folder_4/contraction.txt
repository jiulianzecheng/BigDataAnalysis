A '''contraction''' is a [[word]] that is made up of two or more words that are connected together. One or more letters are removed from the words when they are connected. One or more [[apostrophe]]s are added in the location letters are removed. For example, an apostrophe goes in place of the o in ''not'' when  " do not "  is shortened to  " don't. " 
 
 In linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with [[crasis]], [[abbreviation]]s and initialisms (including [[acronym]]s), with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all three are connoted by the term  " abbreviation "  in loose parlance. < ref name=harts > {{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-861041-6|year=2005|author = Roberts R|display-authors=etal|title-link=Hart's Rules}} {{rp|p.167}} < /ref >  Contraction is also distinguished from morphological [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]], where beginnings and endings are omitted. 
 
 The [[definition]] overlaps with the term [[portmanteau]] (a linguistic ''[[Blend word|blend]]''), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as ''do'' and ''not'', whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept that the portmanteau describes.
