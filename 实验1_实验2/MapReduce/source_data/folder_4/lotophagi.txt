 A group of people also known as lotus eaters, who ate only lotus flowers, and were so addicted to them that they never left, they also offered these lotuses to [[Odysseus]] and his crew. The crew were very tempted to stay and eat lotus flowers, not knowing it would keep them there forever. But [[Odysseus]] pulled them back to the ship, leaving the island of the Lotophagi.
