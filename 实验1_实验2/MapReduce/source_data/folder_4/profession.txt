The '''profession''' is a [[job]] at which someone works and for which they have had training. It is what they do to get money or a living. People often study for years to do their job. [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]] recognized three professions: [[Religion|divinity]], [[medicine]], and [[law]]. These were called  " learned professions " . In modern times other occupations such as [[teacher]] or [[engineer]] are often called  " learned " .  
 
 Sometimes  " profession "  only means learned professions, but the word may also be used for other jobs. Someone who works in a profession is called a [[professional]]. Sometimes this is in contrast to [[amateur]] which means someone who does similar things but is not paid.
