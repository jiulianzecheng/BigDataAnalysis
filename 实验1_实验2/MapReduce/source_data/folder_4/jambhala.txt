In the [[Buddhist]] religion, '''Jambhala''' is the wealth-giving form of [[Avalokite≈õvara]] or [[Chenrezig]], the [[bodhisattva]] of [[compassion]].  
 
 Jambhala's blessings are to help others by eliminating [[poverty]], so that they may practice the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]. There are five Jambhalas - Yellow Jambhala (overcomes pride), White Jambhala (overcomes attachment), Black Jambala (overcomes resentment), Green Jambhala (overcomes jealousy) and Red Jambhala (overcomes greed). For instance, the White Jambhala is shown sitting on a turquoise dragon and his left hand holds a mongoose that spews out precious jewels.
