'''Agorism''' is a [[Free-Market Anarchism|free-market anarchist]] [[political philosophy]] founded by [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] that believes the ultimate goal as bringing about a society in which all  " relations between people are voluntary exchangesâ€“ a [[free market]]. " < ref name= " newlibman " > Konkin, Samuel Edward. [http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf New Libertarian Manifesto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |date=2012-02-23 }} < /ref >  The term comes from the Greek word  " [[agora]], "  referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient Greek city-states. Agorist theory divides people into two classes: people who make their living through the market, and people who make their living by coercing others (called the  " economic class "  and  " political class " , respectively). They support a nonviolent overthrow of the second class by the first, through peaceful [[black market]] and [[grey market]] activity, known as counter-economics.
