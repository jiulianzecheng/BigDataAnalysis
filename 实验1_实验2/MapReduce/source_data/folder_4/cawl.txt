 '''Cawl'''  is a [[Wales|Welsh]] dish. It was traditionally eaten during the winter months in the south-west of [[Wales]]. < ref name= " TWAEOW " > Davies, (2008) p.130 < /ref >  Today the word is often used to refer to a dish containing [[lamb]] and [[leek]]s, but historically it was made with either salted [[bacon]] or [[beef]], [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s and other vegetables. < ref name= " TWAEOW " / >  Cawl is widely considered to be the national dish of Wales. < ref > {{cite web|last=Staff|title=Children celebrate St David's Day with traditional cawl |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southwestwales/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8550000/8550170.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=5 March 2010|access-date=13 March 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 The meat in the dish was normally cut into medium-sized pieces and boiled with the vegetables in water. The stock was thickened with either [[oatmeal]] or [[flour]]. It was then served, without the meat or vegetables, as a first course. < ref name= " TWAEOW " / >   The vegetables and slices of the meat would then be served as a second course. < ref name= " TWAEOW " / >   Cawl served as a single course is today the most popular way to serve the dish. Cawl is similar to ''lobsgows'', cawl's north Wales equivalent. ''Lobsgows'' differs in that the meat and vegetables are cut into smaller pieces. The stock is not thickened. < ref name= " TWAEOW " / > 
 
 " Cawl cennin " , or leek cawl, can be made without meat but using meat stock. In some areas cawl is often served with bread and cheese. These are served separately on a plate. The dish was traditionally cooked in an iron pot or cauldron over the fire. < ref > {{cite web|last=Staff|title=Captain Alfie laps up cawl crawl |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4749382.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=26 February 2006| access-date=13 March 2012}} < /ref >  It was eaten with wooden spoons. < ref > Freeman (1980) p.82 < /ref >  The word ''cawl'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] is first recorded in the 14th century, and is thought to come from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|caulis}}'', meaning the stalk of a plant, a [[cabbage]] stalk or a cabbage. In Welsh, ''{{lang|cy|gwneud cawl o [rywbeth]}}''  ( " make a cawl of [something] " ) means to mess something up.
