 An '''aquifer''' is an underground  layer where the material contains [[water]]. That can be less solid material like [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]] or [[silt]], but it can be [[Rock (geology)|rock]] as well, as long as the rock allows water to get in (that means that it is water-bearing). 
 [[Groundwater]] can be taken out of the ground by digging a [[well]]. The study of water in aquifers is called [[hydrogeology]]. 
 
 == Groundwater in rock formations == 
 One kind of groundwater is found in underground rivers in [[cave]]s where water flows freely underground. This may occur in [[erosion|eroded]] [[limestone]] areas known as [[karst]] [[topography]], but those are only found in small parts of the Earth. 
 
 Usually, groundwater is found in the pore spaces, or tiny openings, of rocks under the ground.  The pores in the rocks are saturated, or filled up, with water, much like a kitchen sponge.  The groundwater  can be [[pump]]ed out for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses. 
 
 If a rock unit of low [[wikt:porous|porosity]] is highly fractured, it can make a good aquifer (via [[Fracture (geology)|fissure]] flow), if the water can get through it. Porosity is important, but, ''alone'', it does not make an aquifer. The [[Deccan Traps]] (a [[flood basalt]]ic lava) in west central [[India]] are good examples of rock with high porosity but low permeability, so they are poor aquifers. The (Upper [[Cretaceous]]) [[Chalk]] of south east England has a reasonably high porosity, but low grain-to-grain permeability. Much of its good water-yielding characteristics being due to micro-fracturing and fissuring. 
 
 == Examples == 
 *The [[Great Artesian Basin]] in [[Australia]] is arguably the largest groundwater aquifer in the world. < ref name= " qldgovt " > {{cite web |url=http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf |title=The Great Artesian Basin |access-date=2007-01-03 |format=PDF |work=Facts: Water Series |publisher=Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water |archive-date=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66WVovDxR?url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/factsheets/pdf/water/w68.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  (over 1.7 million km²). It plays a large part in water supplies for [[Queensland]] and remote parts of [[South Australia]]. 
 *The [[Guarani Aquifer]] with an area of 1.2 million km² is shared by [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]]. 
 *The [[Ogallala Aquifer]] of the [[central United States]] is one of the world's great aquifers. It underlies portions of eight states, contains primarily [[fossil water]] from the time of the last [[Quaternary glaciation|glaciation]].  Annual recharge, in the more [[arid]] parts of the aquifer, is estimated to total only about 10 percent of annual withdrawals. 
 *The [[Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System]] (NSAS) is the world’s largest known fossil water aquifer system.  
 
 == Exploitation == 
 Aquifers can occur at various depths. Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be exploited for water supply and [[irrigation]], but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have [[limestone]] hills or mountains within them or close to them which can be exploited as groundwater resources. If more water is taken out than get in again one speaks of [[over-harvesting]]. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as [[Libya]] and Israel, population growth has led to [[over-population]] which has caused the lowering of water table and the subsequent contamination of the [[groundwater]] with saltwater from the sea (saline intrusions). In these cases the aquifer contains brackish water. 
 
 When water seeps (comes slowly) out of the ground, it is called a '''seep''' or  " [[spring (water)]] " . It usually means there is an aquifer under the ground.
