 The village became better known after 2 April 1839 when the first railway line was laid between London and Brighton. Over 6,000 workmen were hired for up to two years building, blasting and clearing rubble beneath the South Downs to create Clayton Tunnel. It is the second longest tunnel on the London to Brighton Line, some 1¼ miles long and {{convert|270|ft|m}} below ground. The opening of Hassocks Gate as the railway station in 1841 saw the beginning of the village that is known today.  In 1861 there was a collision between two trains, which killed 23 people and injured 176 others.

These villages have many nice, older buildings whereas Hassocks village centre was mainly built after World War Two.
