 '''Octocorallia''' is a subclass of the [[Anthozoa]] in the phylum [[Cnidaria]]. There are over 3.000 different [[species]]. 
 
 These animals have an eight-fold [[symmetry]]. Most are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] [[sessile]] [[polyp]]s. Octocorallia look like the [[stony coral]]s. Stony corals have a six-fold symmetry, and are classified in the group [[Hexacorallia]]. Unlike the stony corals, most Octocoralllia lack a lasting [[skeleton]]. For this reason, they do not build [[coral reef]]s. An older name for this group is '''Alcyonaria'''.  
 
 Many species form [[symbiosis|symbioses]] with [[unicellular]] [[algae]]. Octocorallia have many enemies: For this reason, many are [[toxic]], or they taste bad. Many species of the Octocorallia can reproduce both [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] and [[asexual reproduction|asexually]]: It is common to find a colony of Octocorallia, where most polyps have the same sex.
