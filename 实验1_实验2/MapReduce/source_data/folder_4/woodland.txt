 '''Woodland''' is a low-density [[forest]] with plenty of sunlight and limited [[shade]]. It forms an open [[habitat]].  
 
 Woodlands have an understory of [[shrubs]] and [[herbaceous plant]]s including [[grass]]es. Woodlands grade into [[shrubland]] in drier conditions or in early stages of plant [[succession]]. Higher densities and areas of trees, with largely closed [[wikt:canopycanopy|canopy]], and nearly continuous shade and are often called [[forests]].  
 
 ''Woodland'' in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[forestry]] means any smaller area covered in trees, however dense. [[Forest]] in the [[British Isles]] means extensive wooded areas, regardless of density. [[Royal forest]]s may not be wooded at all. The term [[ancient woodland]] is used in British [[conservation]] to mean any wooded land that has existed for a very long time (equivalent to the American term [[old growth forest]]). 
 
 Conservationist work hard to preserve woodlands. The woodlands in Northwest [[Indiana]] have been preserved as part of the Indiana Dunes. < ref > Smith S.  &  Mark S. 2006. Alice Gray, Dorothy Buell, and Naomi Svihla: preservationists of Ogden Dunes. ''The South Shore Journal''. '''1'''.
