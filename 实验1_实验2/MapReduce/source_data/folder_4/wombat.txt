 A '''wombat''' is a [[marsupial]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Vombatidae'''. It lives in the [[Australian]] [[eucalyptus|eucalypt]] forests. There are two [[genera]] with three living wombat [[species]]; the [[common wombat]] and the hairy-nosed wombats. 
 
 It is a medium-sized [[animal]] that makes a [[burrow]] by digging holes in the [[ground]]. Wombats are usually around a metre (40 & nbsp;in) long when they are fully grown.  It is a kind of animal known as a [[marsupial]] because it has a [[pouch]] on its belly that holds its young, although it faces back instead of forward like most marsupials.  Having the pouch face backwards prevents dirt from building up in the pouch and hitting the offspring in the face when digging.  When its young are born they spend some time growing in their mother's pouch before going into the world.  Wombats are [[herbivore]]s. They eat [[plant]]s, [[root]]s, and [[grass]]es.  They are [[nocturnal]] which means they sleep in the [[day]] and come out at [[wikt:night|night]]. Some wombats have thick brown [[fur]] and very small [[ear]]s. They can weigh from 20 to 35 kilograms (45 to 80 lb). They can live up to 7 years. 
 
 Wombats are commonly known and recognised by their waste products. They are the only known [[mammal]]s that excrete [[feces]] in [[cube|cubic]] shape. This lets people easily know when wombat [[habitat]]s are nearby. It also tells simply what the wombat may have eaten by examining the feces thoroughly.
