 '''Eyeglasses''' (U.S),'''glasses''' or '''spectacles''' ( also more rarely '''cheaters''') are pieces of [[glass]] or clear [[plastic]], called [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], that are held in front of a person's [[eye]]s by a frame made of [[metal]] or [[plastic]]. They can be used for many reasons. These include safety. fashion and to correct a person's vision.  The earliest known eyeglasses are in the thirteenth century in Italy. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_peIL7hVQUmwC|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=2007|isbn=9780871692597|location=Philadelphia}} < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 ''Corrective'' lenses let some people see or read better if they have problems seeing. If the someone is [[Hyperopia|long-sighted]] (the light is focusses past the retina), they use a different type of glasses than someone who is [[Myopia|short-sighted]]. Lenses can also correct [[Astigmatism]]. [[Contact lens]]es also help people see better. Corrective lenses usually are made by [[optician]]s following [[eyeglass prescription]] from an [[optometrist]]. It's also possible to get [[adjustable focus glasses]] where one can change the lens power. 
 
 R''eading glasses that are sold over the counter'' may help those with [[presbyopia]] who only need to wear glasses occasionally. They typically come in lens powers from +0.25 to +4.  
 
 [[3d glasses]] are used during [[3d movie]]s. 
 
 Glasses can also protect the eyes. [[Goggles]] and safety glasses are strong and protect the eyes from flying objects. [[Sunglasses]] (with dark [[tinted lens]]es) keep too much [[sunlight]] from getting in people's eyes. Some glasses are tinted for special applications, fashion and [[light sensitivity]] conditions. Some eyeglasses, often with yellow lenses, block blue light from a [[computer]], game, [[tablet]], [[smart phone]] or [[TV]]. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/strategist/article/blue-light-blocking-glasses-work.html|title=Do Blue-Light-Blocking Glasses Actually Do Anything?|last=Builder|first=Maxine|work=The Strategist|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en}} < /ref >

 Eyeglasses are made in many different styles. These may be worn for [[fashion]] or function. These styles include:

 * '''[[Wayfarer glasses]]''' - Eyeglasses or sunglasses with thicker plastic frames and small metal detailing on the front of the glasses. 
 * '''Wraparound glasses''' - Those where the lenses curve around the face offering a greater field of vision and more protection than  " flat "  glasses. 
 *'''Wire-rim glasses''' - Glasses with thin !metal frames. 
 *'''[[Horn-rimmed glasses]]''' - With thicker plastic frames. 
 * '''Windsor''', '''granny''' or [[John Lennon]] glasses - with perfectly round lenses. 
 * '''Flip up''' glasses - Glasses with two pairs of lenses, the outer pair flips up and down as needed.

 '''Historical styles''' 
 * '''[[Rivet spectacles]]''' or '''scissors glasses''' - One of the oldest styles dating back to the [[medieval]] era and essentially consisting of two [[magnifying glass]]es attached at the handles with a [[rivet]]. These seem to have been invented in Florence around 1286. In a sermon from 1306, a Dominican friar wrote: “It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision… And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered.” < ref > {{Cite web|title=The World’s Oldest Surviving Pair of Glasses (Circa 1475) {{!}} Open Culture|url=https://www.openculture.com/2015/09/the-worlds-oldest-surviving-pair-of-glasses.html|access-date=2022-08-30|language=en-US}} < /ref >
