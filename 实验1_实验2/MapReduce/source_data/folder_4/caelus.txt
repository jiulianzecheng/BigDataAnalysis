 '''Caelus''' or '''Coelus''' was a god of the sky in Roman myth and [[theology]] and literature. Its name usually appears in [[masculine]] form when he is thought of as a male generative force.  
 
 According to [[Cicero]] and [[Hyginus]], Caelus was the son of [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and [[Dies (mythology)|Dies]] ( " Day "  or  " Daylight " ). < ref > [[Cicero]], ''De natura deorum'' 3.44, as cited by E.J. Kenney, ''Apuleius: Cupid and Psyche'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990, 2001), note to 6.6.4, p. 198; [[Hyginus]], preface. This is not the [[theogony]] that [[Hesiod]] presents. < /ref >  Caelus and Dies were in this tradition the parents of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. < ref > [[Cicero]], ''De natura Deorum'' 3.56; also [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 4.14. < /ref >
