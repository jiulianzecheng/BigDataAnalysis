 The '''Radiata''' is a super[[phylum]] which includes both the [[echinoderm]]s and the [[ctenophore]]s. It is not part of the usual [[classification]] system, and is not used by all biologists. < ref > Nielsen, Claus 2002.

 The group includes the [[Symmetry (biology)#Radial symmetry|radially symmetric]] animals of the [[Eumetazoa]]. The echinoderms, however, are members of the [[Bilateria]], because they exhibit [[bilateral symmetry]] in their developing stages. Their radial symmetry is secondary. 
 
 Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1983 defined a subkingdom called Radiata consisting of the [[Phylum|phyla]] [[Sponge|Porifera]], [[Myxozoa]], [[Placozoa]], [[Cnidaria]] and [[Ctenophora]] in Radiata, that is, all the animals that are not in [[Bilateria]].  
 
 The ''[[Kingdom (biology)#Five kingdoms|Five Kingdom]]'' classification of Lynn Margulis and K.V. Schwartz keeps only Cnidaria and Ctenophora in Radiata.  
 
 [[Clade|Cladistic]] classifications do not recognize Radiata as a clade. The radiata, in this sense, are [[diploblastic]], meaning they have two primary germ layers: endoderm and ectoderm. Cavalier-Smith's use of the term Radiata includes animals with a single germ layer such as sponges. 
 
 Although radial symmetry is usually given as a defining characteristic of radiates, a few members of the class [[Anthozoa]], which are now considered as the most basal and oldest group of cnidarians, are actually bilaterally symmetric.  
 
 Newer research strongly indicates that bilateral symmetry evolved before the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria: the radially symmetrical cnidarians have evolved radial symmetry secondarily. This means the bilaterism in species like ''N. vectensis'' has a primary origin. Also the free-swimming [[planula]] larvae of cnidarians exhibit bilateral symmetry. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry. < ref > Mark Q. Martindale AND Jonathan Q. Henry 1998.
