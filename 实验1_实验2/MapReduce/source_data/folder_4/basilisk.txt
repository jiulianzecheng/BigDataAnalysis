 '''Basilisks''' are a type of [[lizard]]. They are about 70-75 cm long, when fully grown, and weigh about 80 grams. They live in [[South America]]. There are four different species. They can be very still and hard to see. 
 
 The basilisk lizard can walk on water. It runs across the surface of a pond or pool, without sinking. Its speed keeps it from sinking. At the same time, its long tail helps it to balance. < ref > {{cite book|url=|title=Jungle Animals Over 100 Questions and Answers to Things You Want to Know|last=Ganeri|first=Anita|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=9780752559049|location=Dubai, U.A.E}} < /ref >
