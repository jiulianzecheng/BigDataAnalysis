 Myths are different from [[Folklore|folktales]] and [[Legend|legends]].  The definitions of these are not agreed upon but myths are generally understood to be true, about the remote past, and containing non-human characters. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last=Bascom|first=William|date=1965|title=The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/538099|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=78|issue=307|pages=5|doi=10.2307/538099|jstor=538099|issn=0021-8715}} < /ref >  In contrast, legends usually feature human characters and folktales are understood as fiction. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last=Bascom|first=William|date=1965|title=The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/538099|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=78|issue=307|pages=5|doi=10.2307/538099|jstor=538099|issn=0021-8715}} < /ref > 
 
 The word myth is often used to mean false. For this reason, some religious people object to their beliefs being called myths and some scholars choose to avoid it in favour of other terms. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC & pg=PA41|title=Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth|last=Dundes|first=Alan|date=1984-11-15|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05192-8|pages=41–42; 49|language=en}} < /ref >  Other scholars choose to call all religious stories myths in order to avoid treating one religion as more important or true than another. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC & pg=PR7|title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|last1=Leeming|first1=David|last2=Leeming|first2=Former Professor of English and Comparative Literature David|date=2005-11-17|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-515669-0|pages=vii; xii|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Content of myths== 
 All cultures have developed their own mythology over time. [[Mythology]] includes the [[legend]]s of their history, their [[religions]], their stories of how the world was created, and their heroes. These stories have a great symbolic power, and this may be a major reason why they survive as long as they do, sometimes for thousands of years. 
 
 The main characters in myths are usually [[gods]], [[demigod]]s, or [[supernatural]] humans, < ref name = Bascom > Bascom, William. 1984. The forms of folklore: prose narratives. ''Sacred narrative: readings in the theory of myth''. (ed) Alan Dundes.

''Myth and Reality'', transl. Willard R. Trask. New York: Harper  &  Row. < /ref > < ref name=Petta/ > 
 
 [[Creation myth]]s take place in some early primordial age when the world had not reached its present form. < ref name =  " eliademyth " / > < ref name =  " dundesintro " > Dundes, Alan 1984. ''Sacred narrative: readings in the theory of myth''.

As stories spread to other cultures or as faiths change, however, myths can come to be considered folktales. < ref name=Bascom/ > < ref name =  " doty " > Doty, William 2004. ''Myth: a handbook''. Westport: Greenwood, p. 114. < /ref >  Sometimes myths and legends get merged. Their divine characters get recast as humans or as demihumans (such as [[giant]]s, [[elf|elves]], and [[faerie]]s). < ref name =  " mythfolk " / > 
 
 [[Creation myth]]s describe the  " official "  belief as to how world was created. These myths differ greatly between societies, as any collection of myths clearly shows. < ref > Fraser, James. 1906–1915. ''The golden bough: a study in magic and religion''.

 ==Historians' views on myths== 
 Although myths are often considered to be [[stories]] of events that have not happened, many [[historians]] think myths are about actual events that have become connected with strong symbolic meaning, or that have been changed, or shifted in time or place, or even reversed. One way of thinking about this process is to imagine 'myths' as lying at the far end of an imaginary line. At one end of the line is 'dispassionate account', and 'legendary occurrence' or 'mythical status' is near the other end. As an event progresses toward the 'mythical' end of this line or continuum, the way people think, feel and say about the event changes. It may gain greater historical significance while the 'facts' become less important. By the time one arrives at the [[mythical]] end of the line, the story has  " taken on a life of its own "  and the facts of the original event have become almost unimportant.
