 '''Phagocytes''' are the [[white blood cell]]s that protect the body by eating (phagocytosing)  [[bacteria]] and dead or [[Apoptosis|dying]] cells. They are important for fighting [[infection]]s. They are also important for becoming [[Immunology|immune]]. < ref name=USC > {{cite web| last = Mayer| first = Gene|title=Immunology & nbsp;— Chapter One: Innate (non-specific) Immunity| work = Microbiology and Immunology On-Line Textbook| publisher = USC School of Medicine| year = 2006|url=http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/ghaffar/innate.htm| accessdate = November 12, 2008}} < /ref >  Phagocytes are present in all animals and are very complex in vertebrates. < ref name=Delves > Delves P.J.

 == Professional phagocyte == 
 Phagocytes of humans and other animals are called professional or non-professional, depending on how good they are at [[phagocytosis]]. < ref name=Ernst > Ernst J.D.  &  Stendahl O. (eds) 2006.

 == What a phagocyte does == 
 When there is an infection, phagocytes move to the bacteria by sensing chemicals. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes that are already there. The phagocytes move by a way called [[chemotaxis]]. When bacteria touch a phagocyte, they bind to the receptors on the phagocyte and are eaten (phagocytosed). < ref > Janeway, Charles; Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik 2001.

New York and London: Garland Science. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-4101-7}} Chapter: Induced innate responses to infection. < /ref >  When bacteria enter some phagocytes, the phagocytes use [[oxidant]]s and [[nitric oxide]] to kill the pathogen. < ref name = pmid15378046 > {{cite journal |author=Fang FC |title=Antimicrobial reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: concepts and controversies |journal=Nat.

These parts are then shown to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then move to the body's [[lymph node]]s and show the bacterial parts to white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s. This action is important in getting immunity. < ref name=ATP > Janeway, Charles; Paul Travers, Mark Walport, and Mark Shlomchik 2001. ''Immunobiology''. 5th ed.

 == Phagocyte evasion == 
 Many bacteria have ways to not be eaten or killed by phagocytes. < ref name=USC/ >  They may avoid contact by 
 #growing in places phagocytes cannot reach,  
 #putting out chemicals which make it difficult for phagocytes to get to an infection 
 #interfering with the [[immune response]] which causes phagocytes to respond 
 #tricking the immune system into treating them as  " self " , by coating themselves with a natural substance. < ref > Celli Jean  &  Finlay B. Brett 2002. Bacterial avoidance of phagocytosis.
