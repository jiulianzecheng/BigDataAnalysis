 '''Nylon''' is an artificial [[fibre]]. It is one of the most commonly used [[polyamide]]s, and was first used on February 28, 1935. < ref name=palmer > Palmer R.J. 2001. Polyamides, plastics. In ''Encyclopedia of Popolymer science and technology''. {{doi|10.1002/0471440264.pst251}} < /ref >   
 
 Nylon makes a [[silk]]y material which was first used in [[toothbrush]]es.  It is strong, hard and water resistant. It is used to make clothes. In fact, polyamides are mostly used for synthetic fibres in [[clothing]]. Nylon can also be used to make other materials, such as [[parachute]]s, [[rope]]s, [[string]] for [[tyre]]s, [[carpet]]s, [[fishing net]]s and [[cloth]] and [[socks]]. 
 
 Nylon was invented by [[Wallace Carothers]] at [[Du-Pont]]. < ref name= " ACS " > {{cite web|last1=American Chemical Society National Historic Chemical Landmarks|title=Foundations of Polymer Science: Wallace Hume Carothers and the Development of Nylon|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carotherspolymers.html|website=ACS Chemistry for Life|accessdate=27 January 2015}} < /ref > < ref name= " Carothers " > {{cite web|title=Wallace Hume Carothers|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/wallace-hume-carothers|website=[[Science History Institute]]|date=June 2016|accessdate=20 March 2018}} < /ref >
