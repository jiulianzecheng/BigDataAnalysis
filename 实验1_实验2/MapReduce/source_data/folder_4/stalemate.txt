 Black to move is in stalemate. Black has no legal move since every square to which his [[king (chess)|king]] might move is under attack by White. }} 
 
 When stalemate occurs, the game is a draw. Actual stalemate is rare, but the threat of stalemate has a big effect on endgame play. Many K+R+P vs K+R endings are drawn when stalemate cannot be avoided. The existence of stalemate is a main reason why draws are common in chess, but rare in the chess derivative [[shogi]]. 
 
 In the old Persian form of chess, [[shatranj]], stalemate was a win for the side with the most pieces. The idea of stalemate as a draw in modern chess took a long time to be agreed. It was finally decided by the early 19th century British master [[J.H. Sarratt]] in the London Chess Club rules of 1807. < ref > Hooper D.  &  Whyld K. 1992. ''The Oxford Companion to chess''.
