 The '''Polyphaga''' is the largest and most diverse [[suborder]] of [[beetle]]s. The name is got from two Greek words: ''poly''-, meaning 'many', and ''phagein'', meaning 'to eat', so the suborder is called the “eaters of many things”. Polyphaga has 144 families in 16 superfamilies, and shows an enormous variety of [[wikt:specialization|specialization]] and [[adaptation]]. It has over 315,000 described species, about 90% of all beetle species so far discovered. < ref name=Grimaldi > Grimaldi D. and Engel M.S. 2005. ''Evolution of the insects''.

 == Classification == 
 There are 5 infraorders: 
 
 * [[Bostrichiformia]] — including [[furniture beetle]]s and [[skin beetle]]s. 
 * [[Cucujiformia]] — includes [[lady beetle]]s, [[longhorn beetle]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[checkered beetle]]s and [[leaf beetle]]s. 
 * [[Elateriformia]] — includes [[click beetle]]s and [[firefly|fireflies]] 
 * [[Scarabaeiformia]] — includes [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]]s and [[stag beetle]]s. 
 * [[Staphyliniformia]] — includes [[rove beetle]]s and [[Hydrophilidae|water scavenger beetles]]. 
 
 The infraorder Cucujiformia includes most phytophagous [plant-eating] beetles. Adoption of a plant-eating lifestyle promoted [[speciation]] and diversity in beetles, with Cucujiformia, especially [[weevil]]s, forming a major radiation. Much of this [[adaptive radiation]] has taken place at the same time as the evolution of the [[flowering plants]].  " 99% of phytophagous beetles feed on flowering plants " . < ref name=Grimaldi/ > < sup > p399 < /sup >
