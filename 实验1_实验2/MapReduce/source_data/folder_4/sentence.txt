{{Otheruses|Sentence (law)}} 
 
 A '''sentence''' is a group of [[word]]s that are joined together to mean something. A sentence is the basic unit of [[language]]. It expresses a complete [[thought]]. It does this by following the [[grammar|grammatical]] basic rules of [[syntax]]. For example:  " Ram is walking " . 
 
 A complete sentence has at least a '''[[Subject (grammar)|subject]]''' and a '''main [[verb]]''' to state (declare) a complete thought. Short example: ''She walks''. A subject is the [[noun]] (name) which is doing the main verb. The main [[verb]] is the activity that the subject is doing.  
 
 In [[English language|English]] and many other languages, the first word of a written sentence has a capital letter. At the end of the sentence there is a punctuation mark depending on whether it is a statement, a question, a command, a request or an exclamation. < ref > {{cite web|title=Parts of Sentence|url=https://grammarword.com/parts-of-sentence|work=GrammarWord|accessdate=25 December 2020|archive-date=7 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307115044/https://grammarword.com/parts-of-sentence|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Phrases and clauses == 
 A ''[[phrase]]'' or ''[[clause]]'' is part of a sentence. < ref name= " McA " > McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press. < /ref > < sup > p773â€“777 < /sup > 
 
 This is an example of a sentence: 
 * ''The [[dog]] is happy.'' 
 In this sentence, 'The dog' is the subject, and 'is' is the verb. 
 
 This is an example of a phrase: 
 * ''The happy dog'' 
 
 There is no verb, so we do not know anything about what the happy dog is doing. Therefore, it is not a sentence. 
 
 A clause is a sentence within a sentence. Example: 
 * ''They milked the cows, and then they made cheese and butter''. This sentence has two co-ordinate (~equal) clauses, linked by 'and'. < ref name= " McA " / > < sup > p220 and indranil das < /sup > 
 
 ==Types of sentence== 
 
 * A '''[[simple sentence]]''' has only one clause, and one independent variable. ''The cat is sleeping''. 
 * A '''[[compound sentence]]''' has two or more clauses. These clauses are joined with [[conjunction]]s, [[punctuation]], or both. ''The dog is happy, but the cat is sad''. 
 * A '''[[complex sentence]]''' has one clause with a [[relative clause]]. ''The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy''. 
 * A '''complex-compound sentence''' (or compound-complex sentence) has many clauses, at least one of which is a relative clause: ''The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy, but the cat is sad''. 
 
 Sentences have different purposes: 
 * A '''declarative sentence''', or declaration, is the most common type of sentence. It tells something. It ends with a [[full stop]] '''.''' (''The dog is happy''.) 
 * An '''interrogative sentence''', or question, asks something. It ends with a [[question mark]] '''?''' (''Are you happy?'') 
 * An '''exclamatory sentence''', or exclamation, says something out of the ordinary. It ends with an [[exclamation mark]] '''!''' (''That dog is the happiest dog I have ever seen!'') 
 * An '''imperative sentence''', or command, tells someone to do something. (''Give the dog a bone.'')
