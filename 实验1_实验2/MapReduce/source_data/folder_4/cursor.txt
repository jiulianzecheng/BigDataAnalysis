 A '''cursor''' is a shape on a [[computer]] [[Computer monitor|screen]] that shows where actions made with the [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] or [[mouse]] will make a change. 
 
 There are 2 types of cursor that most people will use. 
 
 * '''The Mouse cursor:'''  The pointer on the screen which the person using the [[computer]] can move using the [[computer mouse]].  This cursor allows the person to select or  " click "  items with the mouse.  On most computers mouse cursors are the shape of an [[arrow]].

 * '''The Text Cursor:'''  Usually seen as a [[vertical]] line or rectangle that flashes on and off. The Cursor tells the person using the computer where they are [[typing]] things on the screen.  They can type letters, numbers and symbols where the cursor is. 
 
 The computer automatically moves the cursor one space to the right when a letter, number or symbol is typed.  The cursor can be moved to the start of the next line by pressing the Enter Key. 
 
 Most Keyboards also have 4 cursor keys to move the text cursor up, down, left or right.
