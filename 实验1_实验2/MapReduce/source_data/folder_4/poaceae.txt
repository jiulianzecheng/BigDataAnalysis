 The '''Poaceae''' or '''Gramineae''' are the  " true "  grasses. They are a large [[family (biology)|family]] of [[monocot]] [[flowering plant]]s. There are about 12,000 [[species]] and 780 [[genera]]. They are one of most ecologically and economically important of all plant families. < ref name= " Missouri botanical garden " > {{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APweb/welcome.html#Famlarge|author=Stevens, P.F|title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website|accessdate=2007-10-07}} < /ref >  [[Juncaceae|Rushes]] and [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] fall outside this family, but they are related. 
 
 [[Grassland]]s are about 20% of the vegetation cover of the [[Earth]]. Poaceae also live in many other habitats, including [[wetland]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[tundra]]. [[Bamboos]] are part of this huge family of plants. 
 
 Domesticated poaceous [[cereal]] crops ([[maize]] (corn), [[wheat]], millets, and [[rice]]) are eaten around the world. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family in modern times. They are used for [[Foraging|forage]], building materials ([[bamboo]], [[thatch]]) and fuel ([[ethanol]]), as well as food. 
 
 Grasses include some of the most useful plant life-forms. They became widespread towards the end of the [[Cretaceous period]]. Fossilized dinosaur dung ([[coprolite]]s) have been found with phytoliths of grasses which are related to rice and bamboo. < ref > Piperno, Dolores R.; Sues, Hans-Dieter 2005. Dinosaurs dined on grass. [[Science (journal)]] '''310''' (5751): 1126â€“1128. doi:10.1126/science.1121020. PMID 16293745. S2CID 83493897 < /ref >  Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even [[intertidal]] habitats. They are at present the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for [[wildlife]] as well as humans.
