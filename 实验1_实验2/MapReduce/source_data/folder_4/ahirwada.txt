 == History == 
 The [[Abhira]]s (modern day [[Ahir]]s) are often mentioned in Ksatrapa inscriptions of Saurashtra. The [[Puranas]] and the Brihatsamhita place the [[Abhira]]s in the southern region during the [[Samudragupta]]. These tribes slowly spread out in different parts of [[India]]. They may have occupied Ahirwada in [[Madhya Pradesh]] at a late date. We know of their occupation in [[Rajasthan]] also at a late date as is evident from the [[Jodhpur]] inscription of samwat 918, that the [[Abhira]] people of this area were a terror to their neighbours, because of their violent demeanour. < ref name= " Google Books " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWVZWjNAcAgC & dq=Ahirwada & pg=PA87 | title=A Political History of the Imperial Guptas: From Gupta to Skandagupta | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | date=1989 | accessdate=7 September 2014 | author=Tej Ram Sharma | pages=87}} < /ref > 
 
 According to James Tod, The Princes of Garh Mandla, for ages continued the surname of Pal, which is indicative of their nomadic occupation. The [[Ahir|Aheers]], who occupied all the Central India and have left Aheerwara (Ahirwada) a memorial of their existence, was a bunch of the same race, as Aheer being a synonym for Pal. < ref name= " James Tod " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5xLm38cPAC & dq=Pal+surname & pg=PA443 | title=Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, Or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India | publisher=Lyon Public Library | author=James Tod | year=1922 | pages=443}} < /ref > 
 
 Ahirwada is  mentioned in ''Malwa in Transition Or a Century of Anarchy: The First Phase, 1698-1765'', along with ''Khichiwada'' and ''[[Bhopal]]'' where the anti Maratha feelings prevailed very often. Rising of the [[Ahir]]s of Ahirwada were a cause of worry for [[Maratha]] Supremacy as the Ahirs started building new Forts. < ref name= " GoogleBooks " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1Z6yHKuwlUC & dq=ahirwada & pg=PA312 | title=Malwa in Transition Or a Century of Anarchy: The First Phase, 1698-1765 | publisher=Asian Educational Services | date=1993 | accessdate=7 September 2014 | author=Sinh Raghubir | pages=75–329}} < /ref >  Also, the presence of ''Puranmal Ahir'', an [[Ahir]] Ruler or chief of [[Ahir]] Country in [[Malwa]] is noticed in several historical accounts for the period of 1714 to 1716 . < ref name= " gbook1 " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0oPIo9TXKcC & dq=puranmal+ahir & pg=PA164 | title=A History of Jaipur: C. 1503-1938 | publisher=Orient Blackswan | date=1994 | accessdate=27 October 2014 | author=Jadunath Sarkar | pages=164}} < /ref > < ref name= " googlebook2 " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQeSBLpUwsC & dq=puranmal+ahir & pg=PA91 | title=Studies In Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages The Heritage Of Rajputs (Set Of 5 Vols. | publisher=Sarup  &  Sons | date=2008 | accessdate=27 October 2014 | author=R.K.

 ==History== 
 Ahirwada was a troubled region.Gopal Rao Barve suppressed them during the early months of 1761, buesoon after his departure the Ahirs rose again in alliance with Izzat Khan and the Khichis. Nothing could be done during the rainy season. 
 
 In November, 1761, [[Maratha]] officers in Ahirwada invited Malhar to come to their assistance. He came as far as Sanganer (February, 1762), but his wound prevented him from advancing to the scene of action. In December, 1761,Vishwas Rao was asked by his father, Naro Shankar, to capture Jhansi with the co-operation of Izzat Khan and Govind Kalyan.The latter was asked by the Poona Government to settle the  Sarkar. < ref > Fall of the Adagiai Emftre, Vol. II, pp. 544, 509.2 S.P.D., II, 7, xxix, 33, 34, 37. < /ref > 
 
 Peshwa Madhav Rao affairs of Ahirwada and to recover the fore of Bhilsa. seized by the Nawab of [[Bhopal]].1During the years 1762-1764 the Marathas could pay noattention to the affairs of [[Malwa]], [[Bundelkhand]] and [[Rajputana]].The invasion of Nizam Ali and the civil war between the Peshwa and his uncle absorbed their energy. Malhar Rao, gradually sinking due to old age and ill-health, could not venture intothe scene of his former triumphs. Mahadji Sindhia was busy with the question of succession, and the Poona Government asyet showed no desire to profit by his abilities. 
 
 " Inactivity and lack of a vigorous policy weakened the Maratha power inMalwa " .Two incidents seem to show that by the year 1764 dieposition of the Marathas in Northern India had somewhat improved. Ahmed Shah Abdali ratified a formal peace withthem in that year.' This was a much-needed relief, and at thesame time it was an indirect recognition of their still surviving power. The second incident is more interesting. We read in dieEast India Company's general letter to Madras, dated May 13,1768,  " When our servants after the Battle of Buxur planned theextirpation of Shuja from his dominions and the giving thesame up to the King, "  Lord Clive soon discerned the Kingwould have been unable to maintain them and that it wouldhave destroyed the strongest barrier against the Marathas and1 S.P.D., xix, 12, 22, 37, 43; xxxix, 3.
