 '''Pankow''' [{{IPA|ˈpaŋkoː}}] is one of the new [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin]]. In 2001, the old borough of Pankow was merged (joined) with the former boroughs of [[Prenzlauer Berg]] and [[Berlin-Weißensee|Weißensee]]. 
 
 It has an area of {{convert|103.07|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} and about 347,100 inhabitants. Pankow's current [[mayor]] is Matthias Koehne ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]). 
 
 Between 1945 and 1960 many members of the government of East Germany lived in the [[Majakowskiring]] district of Pankow. Western writers often called Pankow capital of East Germany, or used Pankow as shorthand for the East German government. 
 
 The [[Rykestrasse Synagogue]] Germany's largest [[synagogue]], is located in the Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood of the Pankow district.
