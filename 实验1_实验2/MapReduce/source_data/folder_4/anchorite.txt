Online Etymology Dictionary. < /ref > < ref > {{LSJ|a)naxwrhth/s|ἀναχωρητής|ref}}. < /ref >  is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-filled, [[ascetic]] life.

 The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of being a Christian [[monk]]. From the [[12th century|12th]] to the [[16th century|16th]] centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the [[13th century]]), dropping eventually to two to one (in the [[15th century]]). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods. < ref name= " :1 " > {{cite book|title = Anchorites, Wombs And Tombs : Intersections Of Gender And Enclosure In The Middle Ages|url = https://archive.org/details/anchoriteswombst00mcav|last = Herbert McAvoy|first = Liz|publisher = University of Wales|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/anchoriteswombst00mcav/page/n27 13]}} < /ref >
