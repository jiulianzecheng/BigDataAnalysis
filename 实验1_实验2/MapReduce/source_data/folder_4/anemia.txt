 '''Anemia''' (U.S. spelling) or '''anaemia''' is not having enough [[red blood cell]]s or [[hemoglobin]] in the [[blood]]. 
 
 == Types or causes of anemia == 
 === Microcytic anemia === 
 * [[Iron deficiency anemia]] is the most common type of anemia overall 
 * [[hemoglobinopathy|Hemoglobinopathies]]â€”much rarer 
 ** [[Sickle-cell disease]] (once called ''sickle-cell anemia'') 
 ** [[Thalassemia]] 
 
 === Normocytic anemia === 
 * Acute [[hemorrhage|blood loss]] 
 * [[Anemia of chronic disease]]  
 * [[Aplastic anemia]] ([[bone marrow]] failure) 
 
 === Macrocytic anemia === 
 * [[Megaloblastic anemia]] due to not having enough of either [[vitamin B12]] or [[folic acid]] (or both) 
 * [[Pernicious anemia]] is an [[autoimmune]] problem with the [[parietal cell]]s of the stomach 
 * [[Alcoholism]] 
 * [[Methotrexate]], [[zidovudine]], and other drugs that stop [[DNA replication]]. This is the most common cause in nonalcoholic patients. 
 
 === Dimorphic anemia === 
 ''Dimorphic anemia'' means two types of anemia at the same time. For example, macrocytic [[hypochromic]], due to [[hookworm]] [[infestation]] leading to not enough of both [[iron]] and [[vitamin B12]] or [[folic acid]] or following a [[blood transfusion]].
