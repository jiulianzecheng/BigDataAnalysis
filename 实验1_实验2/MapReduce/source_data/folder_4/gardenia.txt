 '''''Gardenia''''' is a [[genus]] of about 250 species of [[flowering plant]]s in the family [[Rubiaceae]]. Gardenia can be found in the [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of [[Africa]], southern [[Asia]], [[Australasia]] and [[Oceania]]. 
 
 The genus was named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] after ''Dr Alexander Garden'' (1730-1791), Scottish-born American naturalist. 
 
 They are [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s growing to 1–15 m tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite or in [[whorl]]s of three or four, 5–50 & nbsp;cm long and 3–25 & nbsp;cm broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery texture. The [[flower]]s are solitary or in small [[cluster]]s, white or pale yellow. Flowering is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many [[species]] are strongly scented. 
 
 ==Cultivation and uses== 
 
 Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in some species. 
 
 Gardenias have a reputation for being difficult to grow. Because they originated in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high [[humidity]].
