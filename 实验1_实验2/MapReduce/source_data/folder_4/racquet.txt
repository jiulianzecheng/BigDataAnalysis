 A '''racquet''' (sometimes [[racket]]) is used in sports to hit an object.  It differs from a [[paddle]] because the [[head]] is a grid of strings instead of solid. 
 
 == Tennis == 
 A [[tennis]] racquet has a long [[Handle (grip)|handle]] and a large [[oval]]-[[shape]]d area used to hit a tennis [[ball]]. It has many strings stretched across its surface (or face) both [[horizontal]]ly and vertically. The strings supply bounce to hit the ball. The handle and frame of the racquet is usually made out of light [[material]]s such as [[graphite]]. Older racquets were made out of [[wood]]. Tennis racquets come in different [[size]]s and [[weight]]s. 
 
 Tennis racquets can be bought at sports [[:wikt:equipment|equipment]] [[Shop|stores]] or [[department store]]s. A beginner racquet can cost as little as $30, but they can cost much more for very good [[quality]] rackets ($500 or more). 
 
 == Badminton == 
 A [[badminton]] racquet has a longer, thinner [[neck]] than a tennis racquet with softer strings as the [[shuttlecock]] is hit up over a [[net]].
