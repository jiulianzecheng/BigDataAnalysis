 The word '''''geek''''' is a [[slang]] word. It has many different meanings. It can mean a person who enjoys [[computer]]s and knows a lot about them. It used to mean a [[carnival]] worker  " who bit the heads off of chickens and rats. " < ref name=wsj > {{cite news|title=Now That Everyone Wants to Be a Geek, Lawyers Have Been Called|first=Miguel|last=Bustillo|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 20, 2011|page=A1}} < /ref >  One [[dictionary]] says that a geek is  " a peculiar or otherwise dislikable person, especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual " . < ref name= " merriam-webster " > {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geek|title=Dictionary: Geek|accessdate=2007-10-12|work=Dictionary.com-Merriam-Webster entry}} < /ref >  This means  " a strange and un-likeable person, especially one who is thought to be very clever " . 
 
 ==History== 
 This word comes from [[English language|English]] [[dialect]] words (words that are used in certain places) ''geek, geck'': [[Foolishness|fool]], freak; from Low German ''geck'', from Middle Low German. A different form of the word ''geck'' is still used in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]] ''gek'': crazy. Other forms of ''geck'' are also used in some [[German dialects]], and in the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] word ''Gickeleshut'': geek's hat, used in carnivals. < ref name= " merriam-webster " / > 
 
 In 18th century Austria-Hungary, ''Gecken'' were freaks shown by some [[circus]]es. In 19th century, in North-America, the term ''geek'' referred to a freak in circus [[Sideshow|side-shows]] (see also [[freak show]]). The 1976 edition of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' included only the definition of [[geek show]]s. 
 
 The word can be used to be rude or mean to someone. However, it can also be used without meaning to be hurtful, or with pride. An example is the '[[Geek Squad]]' of the [[Best Buy]] company. < ref name=wsj/ > 
 
 ==Meanings== 
 The meaning of geek has changed. There is no longer a single meaning. The words [[nerd]], gimp, [[dweebs|dweeb]], [[wikt:dork|dork]], [[wikt:spod|spod]] and [[wikt:gump|gump]] have similar meanings. People may say that these words mean slightly different things.  In a 2007 interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] said the difference between nerds and geeks is  " geeks get it done. " < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ifilm.com/episode/18527/startsWith/2814949?cmpnid=800 & lkdes=VID_2814949 |title=The Colbert Report - 2007 Archive - 1/17/07 - Television - SPIKE Powered By IFILM < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016102446/http://www.ifilm.com/episode/18527/startsWith/2814949?cmpnid=800 & lkdes=VID_2814949 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  [[Julie Smith]] described a geek as  " a bright young man turned inward, poorly socialized, who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors, who thought of that secret, dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspaceâ€”somewhere exciting, a place more real than his own life, a land he could conquer, not a drab teenager's room in his parents' house.

 Other meanings include: 
 *A hurtful word to call to a person who only thinks about intellectual puzzles for their own sake, who does not know how to do most other human things so they cannot go around where they want within society. 
 *A person who is interested in [[technology]], especially [[computing]] and [[new media]]. Geeks are very good with computers, and use the term ''[[Hacker (term)|hacker]]'' in a positive way, though are not all hackers themselves. 
 *A person who matches [[Academia|academic]] subjects to the real world outside of academic studies; for example, using [[multivariate calculus]] to select the best dimensions of a pan to [[bakery|bake]] a [[cake]]. 
 *A person who has chosen concentration rather than being normal; one who tries their best to pursue skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance. 
 *A person who loves something in a way that places him or her outside the [[mainstream]]. This could be due to the intensity, depth, or subject of their interest. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The word ''geek'' is in [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1952 short story ''[[The Year of the Jackpot]]''. < ref > {{cite book|title=The Menace from Earth|first=Robert A. |last=Heinlein|year=1983|isbn=978-0-552-09334-7|publisher=Corgi}} < /ref >   The word appears meaning the modern definition. 
 
 ==Reclamation and self-identification== 
 Being called a  " geek "  was usually an insult. Now it is often a nice thing to say, meaning that the person it is describing has extraordinary technical skill. [[Geek Pride Day]] has been observed on May 25 in [[Spain]] since 2006 (May 25 being the world premiere date of [[Star Wars]] and also [[Towel Day]]). < ref > {{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/05/5-reasons-to-be-proud-on-geek-pride-day/|magazine=Wired|first=Dave |last=Giancaspro|title=5 Reasons To Be Proud on Geek Pride Day|date=May 25, 2010|accessdate=October 25, 2011}} < /ref >  The holiday promotes the right to be nerdy or geeky, and to express it in public without feeling bad. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://eastvalleytribune.com/site/get_out/article_a96c071a-85cf-11e0-b40f-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Once a year, it's hip to be square|work=East Valley Tribune|first=Susan|last=Thurston|date=May 24, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  A new meeting, [[Geek.Kon]], is held in Madison, Wisconsin to celebrate all things geek. < ref name= " MJS2009 " > {{cite web

 The website [[BoardGameGeek]] is an online community of board gamers who see themselves as geeks at [[board game]] meetings; they call their website  " The Geek " , for short. Technical support services such as [[Geek Squad]] use the term ''geek'' to show that they have helpful technical abilities. < ref name=wsj/ >  In recent history, some geeks have grown a geek culture, such as [[geek humor]] and odd references on t-shirts. The so-called ''[[#Geek chic|geek chic]]'' trend is a deliberate affectation of geek or nerd traits as a [[fashion]] statement. < ref name=Beck/ >  Nonetheless, the derogatory definition of geeks remains that of a person only thinking about his area of interest at the cost of [[social skill]]s, [[personal hygiene]], and status. 
 
 There has been criticism over the widespread appropriation of the terms  " geek "  and  " nerd "  as self descriptors. Certain people who would have most likely not been described as such under the traditional [[stereotype]] have argued this. Along with efforts to de-emphasize the negative social aspects, in recent years there have been arguments for de-emphasizing the necessity for having noticeably high levels of [[intelligence]] or technical aptitude. This has resulted in the desire to redefine the term geek rather as any person who pursues a passionate interest in anything regardless of genre, is [[Creativity|creative]], and [[individual]]istic. Arguments against the revisionist definitions, however, state that it is not only unnecessary, but it completely contradicts the traditional accepted definition of the terms which distinctly refer to persons who are noticeably above average intelligence, usually good at things in technically demanding fields, and socially awkward or [[alienation|alienated]] to a certain extent. < ref > {{cite book|title=The Geek Handbook: User Guide and Documentation for the Geek in Your Life|first=Mikki|last=Halpin|year=2000|publisher=Simon  &  Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1776-3}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Geek chic== 
 " Geek chic "  is a phrase that means a person who has [[wikt:stereotypically|stereotypically]]  " geek "  features including black-rimmed [[glasses]], [[T-shirt]]s with geek in-jokes, and more technically complex things. 
 
 There are many ways of looking at the term  " geek chic " , with heavy black-rimmed glasses being the one defining thing as far as the press is concerned. Wearing them is sufficiently notable to have celebrities like [[David Beckham]], < ref name=Beck > {{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3135201/Geeky-Becks-specs-appeal.html|title=Geeky Becks' specs appeal|work=The Sun|date=2010-09-12|accessdate=October 25, 2011}} < /ref >  [[Justin Timberlake]] < ref > [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1315143/Justin-Timberlake-bringing-geek-chic-Social-Network-premiere.html Daily Mail: Justin Timberlake geek chic] < /ref >  and [[Myleene Klass]] < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://uk.stylelist.com/2010/08/31/hot-or-not-myleene-klass-does-geek-chic-in-spectacles/ |title=stylelist.com: Myleene Klass geek chic |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-date=2010-09-03 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100903145709/http://uk.stylelist.com/2010/08/31/hot-or-not-myleene-klass-does-geek-chic-in-spectacles/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  being reported as  " trying geek chic " .

 Geeks themselves think that the term is used for  " reclaiming the geek identity as something not only meaningful, but also stylish. " < ref > [http://people.howstuffworks.com/geek-chic.htm How Stuff works: Geek Chic] < /ref >  - for this usage, more than just glasses are needed, and so the term has a wider meaning, being applied to home fittings < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.geekchichq.com/ |title=Geek Chic HQ |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-date=2011-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711210649/http://www.geekchichq.com/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and objects as well as clothes. In this usage, the term  " geek chic "  can even be used as a positive contrast to the somewhat more negative term  " geeky " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.geeksugar.com/Cell-Phone-Hand-Stand-Totally-Geeky-Geek-Chic-11184165 |title=Geek Sugar: Cell phone stand, totally geeky or geek chic? |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-date=2011-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724055242/http://www.geeksugar.com/Cell-Phone-Hand-Stand-Totally-Geeky-Geek-Chic-11184165 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Geek chic is not to be confused with [[preppie]] fashion, which is more widely to do with a [[conservatism|conservative]] image rather than geek culture. Instead, much of the geek chic image borrows from various other youth fashions such as [[goth subculture|goth]], [[hippie]], and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] among others,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} but t-shirts with geeky in-jokes seem to originate from the geeks themselves. Shirt designers who tailor to geeks offer rewards for the best ideas. < ref > [https://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/customer_bounty.cgi ThinkGeek: Tshirt idea submission page] < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.tshirthell.com/ideas.htm |title=TShirtHell: Tshirt idea submission page |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-date=2011-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723103938/http://www.tshirthell.com/ideas.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Trademark dispute== 
 The [[:en:Best_Buy|Best Buy]] company of [[:en:Richfield,_Minnesota|Richfield, Minnesota]] has trademarked  " Geek Squad "  as the name of its computer repair service. Best Buy has fought the [[Trademark|trademarks]] of a dozen other companies, including Geek Rescue, Rent a Geek, and [[:en:Speak_With_A_Geek|Speak With a Geek]]. < ref name=wsj/ >  It is also fighting with [[Newegg]] over the use of  " Take it from a Geek "  on Newegg's website. The [[NBC]] television show ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]'' wanted to use  " Geek Squad "  to describe the main characters' job. Best Buy asked for them to change the name. So the characters on ''Chuck'' were called  " Nerd Herd "  instead. < ref name=wsj/ >
