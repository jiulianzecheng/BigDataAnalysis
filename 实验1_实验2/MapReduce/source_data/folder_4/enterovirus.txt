 '''Enteroviruses''' are a group of [[virus]]es that usually live in the [[gut]] of humans and other mammals. Most do not cause [[disease]] there. They can cause a mild form of [[meningitis]], which is an infection near the brain. Some members of this group of viruses, such as [[poliomyelitis|poliovirus]], can sometimes be more dangerous. They are viruses made for [[RNA]] and there are many different kinds of them. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Enterovirus/ |title=Health Protection Agency, UK.
