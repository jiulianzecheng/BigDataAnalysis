 '''Yaws''' is a tropical [[infection]] of the [[skin]], [[bone]]s and joints. < ref > It is also known as 'frambesia tropica', 'thymosis', 'polypapilloma tropicum', 'parangi', 'bouba', 'frambösie' and 'pian'. < /ref > < ref name= " Bolognia " > {{cite book |author=Rapini RP; Bolognia JL; Jorizzo JL. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} < /ref > < ref name= " Andrews " > {{cite book |author=James W.D. | display-authors = etal |title=Andrews' diseases of the skin: clinical dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc=62736861 |doi= |accessdate=}} < /ref >  It is caused by the [[spirochaete]] [[bacterium]] ''[[Treponema pallidum]] pertenue''. < ref name=Mit2012 > {{cite journal|last=Mitjà O. | display-authors = etal |title=New treatment schemes for yaws: the path toward eradication|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=406–412|doi=10.1093/cid/cis444|format=pdf|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/3/406.long|pmid=22610931}} < /ref > < ref name=Mit2013 > {{cite journal|last1=Mitjà O|last2=Asiedu K|last3=Mabey D|title=Yaws|journal=Lancet|year=2013|volume=381|issue=9868|pages=763–773|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62130-8|pmid=23415015|s2cid=208791874}} < /ref > 
 
 The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, two to five centimeters in diameter. < ref name=Mit2013/ >  The center may break open and form an [[ulcer]]. < ref name=Mit2013/ >  This usually heals after three to six months. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  After several weeks, or even years later, the joints and bones may become painful, [[fatigue]] may develop, and new skin sores may appear. < ref name=Mit2013/ >  The skin of the [[Hand|palms]] of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The bones (especially those of the nose) may change shape. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  After five years or more large areas of skin can die. This leaves large [[scar]]s. < ref name=Mit2013/ > 
 
 Yaws is spread by touching the [[fluid]] from the sores of a person with the disease. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together. < ref name=Mit2013/ > 
 
 Other similar diseases are caused by different strains of the same bacterium, such as [[syphilis]] (''Treponema pallidum pallidum''). < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Once the lesions have appeared doctors are able to tell it is yaws. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is the best method of diagnosis. < ref name=WHO2014/ > 
 
 The main way of stopping the disease spreading, is by curing those who have it. This stops them passing it on to others. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Where the disease is common, treating the entire community is effective. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Improving cleanliness and sanitation will also decrease spread. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Yaws can be treated with [[antibiotic]]s. Without treatment, physical deformities happen in 10% of cases. < ref name=WHO2014/ > 
 
 Yaws is common in at least 14 [[tropical]] countries as of 2012. < ref name=Mit2013/ > < ref name=WHO2014/ >  The disease infects only humans. < ref name=WHO2014 > {{cite web|title=Yaws Fact sheet N°316|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2014|date=February 2014}} < /ref >  In the 1950s and 1960s the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) nearly destroyed yaws. < ref name=WHO2014/ >  Since then the number of cases has increased. 
 
 One of the first descriptions of the disease was made in 1679 by [[Willem Piso]]. Archaeology shows that yaws may have been present among humans as far back as 1.6 million years ago. < ref name=Mit2013/ >
