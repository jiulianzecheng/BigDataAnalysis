[[File:Pseudogene illustration.pdf|400px|thumb|An illustration of the [[mutation]]s that can cause pseudogenes. The [[human]] sequence is of a pseudogene in the [[olfaction|olfactory]] [[gene family]]. The [[chimpanzee]] sequence is the functional ortholog. Key differences are highlighted]] 
 
 '''Pseudogenes''' are [[gene]]s that have lost their function. They have lost their [[gene expression]] in the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or their ability to code [[protein]]. < ref name= " pmid3909943 " > {{cite journal | author = Vanin EF | title = Processed pseudogenes: characteristics and evolution | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-genetics_1985_19/page/253 | journal = Annu.

 Pseudogenes can result from [[mutations]] in a gene whose product is not needed for the survival of the organism. Although not protein-coding, the [[DNA]] of pseudogenes may be functional. < ref name= " pmid20577206 " > {{cite journal | author = Poliseno L | title = A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | pages = 1033–1038 | year = 2010 | issue = 7301 | pmid = 20577206 | doi = 10.1038/nature09144 | pmc=3206313| bibcode = 2010Natur.465.1033P }} < /ref >  It may be similar to other kinds of [[non-coding DNA]] which have a [[gene regulation|regulatory]] role. 
 
 Most have some gene-like features. They lack protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling mutations, or their inability to encode RNA (such as with [[rRNA]] pseudogenes). < ref > {{cite book |author=Herron, Jon C; Freeman, Scott |title=Evolutionary analysis |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionaryanal0000free_i9s5 |publisher= 4th ed, Pearson Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-13-227584-2 }} [http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/6/839] < /ref >    
 
 Pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic material that is to be removed from the genome, < ref name=Zheng > Zheng D. ''et al'' 2007. Pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions: Consensus annotation, analysis of transcription, and evolution. ''Genome Res''. '''17''' (6): 839–51. [http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/6/839] < /ref >  so they are often labeled as [[junk DNA]]. Pseudogenes contain fascinating biological and [[evolution]]ary histories in their sequences. This is due to a pseudogene's shared ancestry with a functional gene. In the same way that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] thought of two species as having a shared [[common ancestor|common ancestry]] followed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence (see [[speciation]]), a pseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a [[common ancestor]] and have diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years.
