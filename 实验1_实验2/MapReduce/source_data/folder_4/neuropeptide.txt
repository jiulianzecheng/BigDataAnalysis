'''Neuropeptides''' are chemical messengers made up of small chains of [[amino acids]]. When they bind to receptors, they cause [[nerve]] activity. They also act on other tissues like the [[gut]], [[Muscle|muscles]], and [[heart]]. There are over a hundred different types in our bodies. 
 
 [[Peptide|Peptides]] are ancient signalling systems that are in almost all animals on [[Earth]] ([[Sponge|sponges]] are the exception). < ref name= " :2 " > {{cite journal | vauthors = Schoofs L, De Loof A, Van Hiel MB | title = Neuropeptides as regulators of behavior in insects | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 62 | pages = 35–52 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27813667 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ento-031616-035500 | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/632231 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Jékely G | title = The chemical brain hypothesis for the origin of nervous systems | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.
