 A '''cloudberry''' (''Rubus chamaemorus'') is a [[herbaceous plant]] in [[alpine climate|alpine]], [[tundra]] and [[boreal forest]]. The [[fruit]] is an [[amber]]-colored [[edible]] fruit similar to the [[raspberry]] or [[blackberry]]. 
 
 Despite great demand as a delicacy (particularly in [[Russia]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]) the cloudberry is not widely cultivated. It is mainly a wild plant. Wholesale prices vary widely by the size of the yearly [[harvest]], but cloudberries have gone for as much as €10/kg (in 2004). < ref name= " bloomberg-Heiskanen- & -Erkheikki " > {{ cite news |author=Ville Heiskanen  &  Juho Erkheikki |title=Record cloudberry crop lures thousands of Finns to Lapland bogs (see §  " Prices Drop " ; ¶ 1) |date=28 July 2005 |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085 & sid=aFoIHwZwFtyk & refer=europe |accessdate=13 August 2015}} < /ref >   
 
 The ripe fruits are golden-yellow, soft and juicy, and are rich in [[vitamin C]]. When eaten fresh, cloudberries have a distinctive tart taste. < ref > Tart taste: a sharp, sour, or acidic flavour. < /ref >  When over-ripe, they have a creamy texture somewhat like yogurt, and a sweetened flavour. They are often made into [[jam]]s, [[juice]]s, tarts, and liqueurs. They are very popular in [[Scandinavia]]. 
 
 The plant spreads by two means. Its seeds are spread by birds and mammals. Locally, its [[rhizome]]s develop into wide berry patches.
