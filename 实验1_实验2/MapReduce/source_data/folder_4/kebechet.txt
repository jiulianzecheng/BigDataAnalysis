In the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], '''Kebechet''' (also known as Qebehet, Kebhut, Kebehut, Qebehut, and Kabechet) was the goddess of [[wikt:fresh|freshness]] and [[purification]]. She was known as the  " wandering goddess "  or the  " lost child " . She was the daughter of [[Anubis]] and his wife [[Anput]] and was thought to help her father in his role as the god of [[embalming]]. She was particularly associated with embalming fluid used during [[mummification]]. 
 
 Kebechet was often depicted as a [[snake]], sometimes with a body of [[star]]s. She was also depicted as a woman with the head of a snake. Sometimes she takes the form of an [[ostrich]], linking her to the goddess of MaÂ´at who represented [[justice]] and [[balance]] in the universe and was involved in the [[judgement]] of the dead.
