 '''Threshing''' is the process of [[wikt:separating|separating]] the [[edible]] part of [[cereal]] [[grain]] (or other crop) from the scaly, inedible [[chaff]] that surrounds it. It is the step in grain [[process]]ing after [[harvest]]ing and before [[winnowing]]. Early threshing methods removed some of the [[bran]] but modern methods do not. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://wholegrainscouncil.org/newsroom/blog/2014/09/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff|title=Separating the Wheat from the Chaff|publisher=The Whole Grains Council|access-date=28 August 2015}} < /ref > 
 
 Threshing may be done by beating the grain using a [[flail (agriculture)|flail]] on a [[threshing floor]]. Another traditional method of threshing is to make [[donkey]]s or [[oxen]] walk in circles on the grain on a hard surface. < ref > Adolf Erman, ''Life in Ancient Egypt' (London; New York: Macmillan, 1894), pp. 431–431 < /ref >
