 The '''kea''' (''Nestor notabilis'') is a large [[parrot]].  It lives in forests and high rocky hills on the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It is mostly olive-green in color. It has a large, narrow, curved, grey-brown upper beak. The kea is the only parrot in the world that lives in [[alpine habitat]]s. 
 
 Kea are intelligent and curious.  People think this may help them survive in the mountains. 
 
 Kea likes playing with human objects. They like to tear the rubber off car windows and move around traffic cones. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/100321972/roadconemoving-kea-get-gym-to-distract-them-away-from-traffic|title=Roadcone-moving kea get gym to distract them away from traffic|website=Stuff|date=9 January 2018|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}} < /ref >
