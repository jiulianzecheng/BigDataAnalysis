 '''Catatonia''' means a person is awake, but does not move, talk, or react to anything but pain. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkp10N5Hu4oC & dq=catatonia+still+pain & pg=PA25|title=Catatonia: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment|last1=Fink|first1=Max|last2=Taylor|first2=Michael Alan|date=2006-11-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03236-0|language=en}} < /ref >  The person can stay stiff and still for hours. A person with catatonia may look to be in a stupor (being mentally numb and in a daze).  The cause is in the [[nervous system]]; the [[brain]] and [[nerve]]s. This problem was first written about in 1874 in ''Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein''. < ref > {{cite web|title=Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|url=http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm|access-date=12 August 2014|author=Dr Hans-Peter Haack|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406012208/http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm|archive-date=6 April 2010|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 == Causes == 
 Catatonia can sometimes happen with mental disorders. It can be a [[symptom]] of [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Catatonia may also happen when a person abuses drugs or [[overdose]]s by taking too much of a drug. 
 
 Catatonia can also be caused by many different medical disorders. Some causes are [[infection]]s, such as [[encephalitis]]; [[autoimmune disease]]s; damage to the brain from [[stroke]]s; and [[metabolism|metabolic]] problems.  
 
 A person can also get catatonia from benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which happens if the person quickly stops taking [[benzodiazepine]] medications. < ref > {{cite journal |date=August 1996  | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology. | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–9 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 | last1 = Rosebush | first1 = Patricia I. | last2 = Mazurek | first2 = Michael F. }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |date=January 2001  |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364–6 |date=September 1999  |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 |s2cid=17454162 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1059-1311(99)90309-6}} < /ref > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 Doctors can treat catatonia. They usually start with medicines such as [[benzodiazepine]]s. If those medicines do not work; doctors may use [[electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]]. [[Antipsychotic]] medicines can also be used, but with safety in mind. Sometimes they can make catatonia worse or have bad side effects. < ref name =  " Fink  &  Taylor " > Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003 " < /ref >  A group of [[anesthetic]] drugs called NMDA antagonists may be helpful when benzodiazepines don't work. < ref name= " Daniels-2009 " > {{Cite journal | last1 = Daniels | first1 = J. | title = Catatonia: clinical aspects and neurobiological correlates. | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–80 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.4.371 | pmid = 19996245 }} < /ref >
