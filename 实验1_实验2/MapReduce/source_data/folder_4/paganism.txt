 '''Paganism''' is a term that covers a great number of [[spiritual]] and [[religion|religious]] beliefs, and someone who follows one of these beliefs is known as a Pagan. Some of those in ancient times, who are called ''Pagans'' today, believed there was not just one [[deity|god]] but a number of gods and goddesses.  The stories from [[Greek mythology]] are famous examples from a pagan religion. Pagans usually focus on [[spirituality]] and [[nature]], rather than on [[doctrine]]s and [[dogma]]. Not all pagans are [[polytheism|polytheists]] (belief in more than one god). Some of them are [[monotheism|monotheists]] (belief in only one god). 
     
 The word ''pagan'' (without [[a]] capital [[P]]) is often used to describe anyone who holds religious beliefs that differ from the main world religions. A similar term is ''heathen''. Today Pagan, with a capital [[P]], often refers to people who follow Neo-Pagan religions that honour the Earth. The best known Neo-Pagan religion is [[Wicca]]. Another well-known neo-pagan faith is [[Druidism]], but there are many other Neo-Pagan religions with different beliefs.

 == Surviving religions of earlier cultures == 
 Enough has survived of the ancient religions of cultures from pre-modern [[Africa]], [[South America]], [[New Guinea]] and [[Japan]] to give us quite a clear picture. Since African slaves were taken to both South America and the [[United States]], it is no surprise that their beliefs and practices still survive. Not, of course, as the main religion, but they do survive. < ref > Murphy, Joseph M. 1988. ''Santería: an African religion in America''. Boston: Beacon Press.

 In a similar way, but much less well documented, are the ancient religions of other groups such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] in Japan, the tribes in [[New Guinea]], the many tribes in [[Amazonia]], and the fractured remnants of traditional religions in African countries. < ref > Huet, Michael 1994. ''Africa dances''. Text by Claude Savary. London: Thames  &  Hudson. ISBN 0-500-54195-7 < /ref > 
 
 All these groups have one thing in common: they are not part of [[farming]] revolution which happened in the [[Middle East]], and which spread quickly to [[Eurasia]]. The religions which started there are called the ''religions of the book'' because their original beliefs were written down. Of course, [[writing]] was one of the original inventions of a settled people, one able to invest time and energy into activities which would be far more difficult for more traditional peoples.
