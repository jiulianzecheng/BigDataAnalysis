 '''Geckos''' are small to middle size [[Lizard|lizards]]. There are 1196 different species of geckos, mostly in the suborder '''Gekkota'''. They live in many warm countries and usually are active during the night. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/gecko|title=gecko {{!}} Species  &  Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=March 12, 2019}} < /ref >  Some kinds of geckos live in people's [[House|houses]]. ''Hemidactylus frenatus'' is the common house gecko. People are often happy to have them, because geckos eat many insects. 
 
 Unlike most lizards, geckos have voices. A gecko sounds a little like a bird or a frog. In some languages, these lizards have names that sound like their calls, for example, both English and Indonesian call one kind gecko (gek-KO) and tokay (to-KAY). Another kind of gecko, with a different sound, is called chicak (CHEE chak). 
 
 Most geckos [[Oviparous animals|lay eggs]], but some [[Viviparity|give birth to live young]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Geckos have no [[Eye|eyelids]]. Instead, they have a clear membrane (skin) over their eyes. They lick the membrane clean with their [[Tongue|tongues]]. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|url=https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/gecko/|title=Gecko|website=National Geographic|access-date=March 10, 2019|archive-date=March 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327225006/https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/gecko/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Like most lizards, they can [[regenerate]] their tail if they need to. Their tail also helps them balance and store fat. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Geckos also shed their skin, like many other reptiles. Geckos are also able to replace their teeth every few months. 
 
 Geckos can walk on trees, walls, windows, and ceilings. Geckos' feet form a [[Molecule|molecular]] bond with the surface that they are walking on in order to  " stick "  to the surface. This force is called [[Van der Waals force|van der Waal's force]].They can do this because they have special toe pads. A [[microscope]] shows that each toe pad is made of thousands of hair-like structures called setae. Each of these structures branches into many smaller ends called spatulae. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/animals-science-geckos-reptiles-sticky/|title=Geckos may be famously sticky, but here's what stumps them |date=July 9, 2016|website=National Geographic News|access-date=March 12, 2019}} < /ref > < ref > Autumn, Kellar; et al. 2002. Evidence for van der Waals adhesion in gecko setae.

Gecko skin can also kill [[bacteria]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Gregory S.|last2=Green|first2=David W.|last3=Schwarzkopf|first3=Lin|last4=Li|first4=Xin|last5=Cribb|first5=Bronwen W.|last6=Myhra|first6=Sverre|last7=Watson|first7=Jolanta A.|date=July 2015|title=A gecko skin micro/nano structure - A low adhesion, superhydrophobic, anti-wetting, self-cleaning, biocompatible, antibacterial surface|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25772496|journal=Acta Biomaterialia|volume=21|pages=109–122|doi=10.1016/j.actbio.2015.03.007|issn=1878-7568|pmid=25772496}} < /ref >
