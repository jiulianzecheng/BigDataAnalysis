[[File:Rinkhals2.jpg|thumb|A Rinkhals specimen]]The '''rinkhals''' (Hemachatus haemachatus) is a species of [[venom]]ous snake found in parts of southern Africa. It is in the family [[Elapidae]]. It is not a true cobra in that it does not belong to the genus Naja, but instead belongs to the monotypic genus Hemachatus. While rinkhals bear a great resemblance to true cobras they also possess some remarkable differences from these, resulting in their placement outside the genus Naja.
