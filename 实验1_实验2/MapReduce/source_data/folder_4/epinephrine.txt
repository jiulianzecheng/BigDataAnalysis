 '''Epinephrine''', also known as '''adrenaline''', < ref name= " bmj " > Aronson, Jeffrey K. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127537/  " 'Where name and image meet'—the argument for 'adrenaline', " ] ''British Medical Journal'' (BMJ). 19 February 2000, Vol. 320, Issue 2733, pp. 506-509; retrieved 2012-11-15. < /ref >  is a [[hormone]] and a [[medication]]. The names  " adrenaline "  and  " epinephrine "  come from the [[Latin]] words ''ad''-+''renes'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''epi''-+''nephros.'' Both mean  " into or onto the [[kidney]] "  (adrenaline is made in the [[adrenal gland]]s, which sit on top of the kidneys < ref name=Chan2013 > {{cite book|last1=Chansky|first1=Michael Lieberman, Allan Marks, Alisa Peet ; illustrations by Matthew|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781608315727|page=175|edition=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FNYdShrCwIC & pg=PA175}} < /ref > ). In medical [[jargon]], epinephrine is shortened to just  " epi "  ([[Pronunciation|pronounced]] eh-pee). 
 
 ==History== 
 The hormone was first isolated and purified in 1901 by [[Japan]]ese [[chemist]] [[Jokichi Takamine]]. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Wermuth|first1=Camille Georges|title=The practice of medicinal chemistry|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080568775|page=13|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qmt1_DQkCpEC & pg=PA13}} < /ref >  It was [[patent]]ed in the United States with the name  " adrenaline. " < ref name= " bmj " / > 
 
 == Effects in the body == 
 Epinephrine is one of two [[Neurotransmitter|chemical messengers]] that control the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and cause the [[Fight or flight response| " fight or flight "  response]]. < ref name=Kh2008 > {{cite book|last1=Khurana|title=Essentials of Medical Physiology|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=9788131215661|page=460|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cm_kLhU1AP0C & pg=PA460}} < /ref >  Epinephrine makes the  " fight or flight "  response kick in, and causes changes in every part of the body. For example, it: < ref > {{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=David R.|title=Medical physiology : principles for clinical medicine|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781768528|page=312|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBeAeYS-vRUC & pg=PA312}} < /ref > 
 * Makes the heart beat faster 
 * Increases [[blood pressure]] 
 * Causes [[vasoconstriction]] (it makes the [[blood vessels]] narrower, which sends extra blood to the most important [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] in the body, like the [[heart]], [[lung]]s, and [[brain]]) 
 * Causes [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]] (it makes the [[Bronchus|bronchi]], the tubes that bring air to the lungs, get wider, so more air can get into the lungs) 
 
 === Adverse effects === 
 Because epinephrine causes so many changes in the body, it can cause changes that make a person feel bad. Sometimes, it can cause changes that could be dangerous. These are called [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. They include: < ref name=AHFS2015 > {{cite web|title=Epinephrine|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/epinephrine.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Aug 15, 2015}} < /ref > 
 * [[Tachycardia]] (a fast [[heart rate]]) or heart [[palpitations]] (feeling the heart pounding inside the [[chest]]), because epinephrine makes the heart beat harder and faster 
 * [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure), because epinephrine raises blood pressure 
 * [[Cardiac arrhythmia]] (where the heart beats in a way that is not normal) 
 * [[Anxiety]] or [[panic attack]] 
 * [[Tremor]] 
 * Acute [[pulmonary edema]] ([[fluid]] in the lungs) 
 
 == Medical uses == 
 Epinephrine is used to treat a few different medical problems. 
 
 === Cardiac arrest === 
 Epinephrine can restart a person's heart when they are in [[cardiac arrest]] (their heart has stopped beating). < ref name=Lin2014 > {{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=S|last2=Callaway|first2=CW|last3=Shah|first3=PS|last4=Wagner|first4=JD|last5=Beyene|first5=J|last6=Ziegler|first6=CP|last7=Morrison|first7=LJ|title=Adrenaline for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.|journal=Resuscitation|date=June 2014|volume=85|issue=6|pages=732–40|pmid=24642404|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.03.008}} < /ref >  It can make the heart start pumping [[blood]] to the rest of the body again. 
 
 === Anaphylaxis === 
 Epinephrine is the best medicine to treat [[anaphylaxis]], which is a very bad allergic reaction. < ref > {{cite journal|last=ECC Committee, Subcommittees and Task Forces of the American Heart Association|title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care. Part 10.6: Anaphylaxis|journal=Circulation|year=2005|volume=112|issue=24 suppl|pages=IV–143–IV–145|doi=10.1161/circulationaha.105.166568 }} < /ref >  During anaphylaxis, the bronchi (which bring air to the lungs) get narrower and narrower until the person cannot [[Breathing|breathe]]. Epinephrine makes the bronchi get wider so air can get into the lungs and the person can breathe again. It also treats some of the other [[symptom]]s of anaphylaxis. 
 
 People with [[Allergy|allergies]] can get a [[Medical doctor|doctor's]] [[prescription]] for an epinephrine  " auto-injector. "  Anyone can learn to use an auto-injector. If a person starts having anaphylaxis, they just press the auto-injector to the outside of their thigh, and the device will automatically [[Injection|inject]] the right dose of epinephrine into the person's thigh. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > 
 
 === Asthma === 
 Epinephrine can be given for [[asthma]] attacks, if regular asthma medications like [[albuterol]] do not work. < ref > Soar, Perkins, et al (2010) European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Resuscitation 2010 Section 8. Cardiac arrest in special circumstances: Electrolyte abnormalities, poisoning, drowning, accidental hypothermia, hyperthermia, asthma, anaphylaxis, cardiac surgery, trauma, pregnancy, electrocution. Resuscitation. Oct. pp.1400–1433 < /ref > < ref > Fisher, Brown, Cooke (Eds) (2006) Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee. UK Ambulance Clinical Practice Guidelines. < /ref >  The epinephrine will relax the muscles around the lungs and widen the bronchi, making it easier to breathe. < ref > {{cite web|title=Childhood Asthma: Symptoms  &  Treatments|url=https://filterbuy.com/childhood-asthma/|publisher=www.filterbuy.com|accessdate=21 April 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 === Croup === 
 [[Croup]] is a disease that mostly happens in children, and is caused by a virus. It can cause [[Inflammation|swelling]] in the [[throat]], which can make it hard to breathe. Epinephrine can help bring this swelling down, which makes it easier for the child to breathe. Epinephrine works best for croup if it is breathed in, so it is made into a special [[wikt:mist|mist]] that can be inhaled. < ref name=PedN09 > {{cite journal | author = Everard ML | title = Acute bronchiolitis and croup | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_pediatric-clinics-of-north-america_2009-02_56_1/page/119 | journal = Pediatr.
