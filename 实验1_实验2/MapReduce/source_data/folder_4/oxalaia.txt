 '''''Oxalaia''''' was a large [[Predation|predatory]] [[dinosaur]]. It lived during the [[Late Cretaceous|Upper Cretaceous]] of what is now [[Brazil]], sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million [[years]] ago. ''Oxalaia'' is known only from two bones of the [[skull]], which were discovered in 1999. The animal was named in 2011 by a group of Brazilian [[palaeontologists]]. 
 
 It was a member of the [[Spinosauridae]] [[Family (biology)|family]], a group of [[crocodile]]-like [[theropod]] dinosaurs. Like other spinosaurids, ''Oxalaia'' had a long nose or [[wikt:snout|snout]] with [[Jaw|jaws]] and [[Tooth|teeth]] shaped to feed on [[fish]]. ''Oxalaia'' < nowiki/ > 's [[habitat]] was [[Tropics|tropical]], an area of large forests around which were dry [[Desert|deserts]]. ''Oxalaia'' shared this environment with many other animals, most of which are also known from other Cretaceous fossils discovered in [[Africa]].

 In 1999, two [[fossil]] bones of ''Oxalaia'' were found in rocks on an [[island]] in the [[Northeast Region of Brazil|Northeast Region]] of [[Brazil]]. This part of the island gets covered up by the sea at high tide. Because of the action of the waves which cause [[Soil erosion|erosion]], the fossils were almost lost. < ref name= " DescOxalaia "  / >  Hundreds of other fossil teeth were also found at the same place. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite journal|last1=Medeiros|first1=M.A.|year=2006|title=Large theropod teeth from the Eocenomanian of northeastern Brazil and the occurrence of Spinosauridae|journal=Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia|volume=9|issue=3|pages=333–338|doi=10.4072/rbp.2006.3.08}} < /ref > 
 
 The full name of the dinosaur is ''Oxalaia quilombensis''. The animal was named by Brazilian [[palaeontologists]] Alexander Kellner, Elaine Machado, Sergio Azevedo, Deise Henriques, and Luciana Carvalho. The first part of the dinosaur's name (the [[genus]]) comes from an [[Africa|African]] god. The second part of the name (the [[species]]) comes from the ''quilombos'', a group of [[Brazilian]] [[town]]s. < ref name= " DescOxalaia "  / >

 Only two pieces of [[bone]] are known from ''Oxalaia.'' The first is the tip of its snout, called the [[premaxilla]] bone. The second is a piece of its left [[maxilla]], or main upper jaw bone.

 ''Oxalaia'' is the third spinosaurid named from Brazil so far. The other two are ''[[Irritator]]'' and ''Angaturama'' (which might be the same animal as ''Irritator'').

 [[File:Oxalaia_Size_Chart.svg|thumb|Size compared to a [[human]]]] 
 
 To estimate its size, ''Oxalaia'' < nowiki/ > 's [[skull]] bones were compared with those of its close relative, ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. ''Oxalaia'' was probably {{convert|12|to|14|m|abbr=off}} long, and likely weighed {{convert|5|to|7|tonnes|abbr=off}}.

 ''Oxalaia'' is more closely related to the African than Brazilian members of its family. ''Oxalaia'', ''[[Irritator]]'', ''Angaturama'', ''[[Ichthyovenator]]'', and ''Spinosaurus'' are the only known dinosaurs from their [[clade]] that don't have knife-like (or [[Serration|serrated]]) teeth.

 ''Oxalaia'' can be separated from ''Spinosaurus'' by differences between their jaw bones''.'' For example: ''Oxalaia'' had a rounder snout, and more closely spaced teeth than ''Spinosaurus''. ''Oxalaia'' < nowiki/ > 's two replacement teeth per socket, and less smooth secondary palate, also make it unique among the other known spinosaurs. < ref name= " DescOxalaia "  / >

 Spinosaurids likely spent most of their time near or in water, feeding mostly on [[aquatic]] animals like [[fish]]. This way, they would avoid [[Competition (biology)|competing]] with other large predatory dinosaurs. Fossil evidence shows that spinosaurs sometimes also ate [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small dinosaurs. < ref name= " hone2017 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Hone|first1=David William Elliott|last2=Holtz|first2=Thomas Richard|date=June 2017|title=A century of spinosaurs – a review and revision of the Spinosauridae with comments on their ecology|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-6724.13328|journal=Acta Geologica Sinica – English Edition|volume=91|issue=3|pages=1120–1132|doi=10.1111/1755-6724.13328|s2cid=90952478 |issn=1000-9515|url-access=subscription}} < /ref > < ref name= " RMetal10 " > {{cite journal|last1=Amiot|first1=R.|last2=Buffetaut|first2=E.|last3=Lécuyer|first3=C.|last4=Wang|first4=X.|last5=Boudad|first5=L.|last6=Ding|first6=Z.|last7=Fourel|first7=F.|last8=Hutt|first8=S.|last9=Martineau|first9=F.|year=2010|title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_geology_2010-02_38_2/page/139|journal=Geology|volume=38|issue=2|pages=139–142|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A|doi=10.1130/G30402.1|url-access=subscription|last10=Medeiros|first10=A.|last11=Mo|first11=J.|last12=Simon|first12=L.|last13=Suteethorn|first13=V.|last14=Sweetman|first14=S.|last15=Tong|first15=H.|last16=Zhang|first16=F.|last17=Zhou|first17=Z.}} < /ref >   
 
 The cone-shaped teeth of ''Oxalaia'' were built for [[wikt:impale|impaling]] [[prey]], instead of cutting flesh like those of most theropod dinosaurs. ''Oxalaia'' < nowiki/ > 's [[Nostril|nostrils]] were placed far back on the head. This was probably to avoid water getting inside its nostrils when fishing.

 ''Oxalaia'' is known from the [[Alcântara Formation]], a [[geological formation]] in [[Northeast|northeastern]] Brazil. This formation dates to the [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million [[years]] ago. Back then, the [[environment]] of the formation had a wet [[climate]]. There were large [[Tropics|tropical]] [[forests]] made of plants like [[conifer]] trees, [[ferns]], and [[Horsetail|horsetails]]. These forests were surrounded by an [[arid]], or dry, [[landscape]]. < ref name= " medeiros20142 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Medeiros|first1=Manuel Alfredo|last2=Lindoso|first2=Rafael Matos|last3=Mendes|first3=Ighor Dienes|last4=Carvalho|first4=Ismar de Souza|date=August 2014|title=The Cretaceous (Cenomanian) continental record of the Laje do Coringa flagstone (Alcântara Formation), northeastern South America|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981114000364|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=53|pages=50–58|doi=10.1016/j.jsames.2014.04.002|bibcode=2014JSAES..53...50M|issn=0895-9811|url-access=subscription}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Toledo|first1=Carlos E.

 ''Oxalaia'' shared this habitat with many different kinds of animals. Other dinosaurs found in the formation included giant carnivores like ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'', and perhaps ''Spinosaurus''. Smaller predators lived there too, such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], and an animal very similar to ''[[Masiakasaurus]]''. There were also large [[Sauropod|sauropods]], a group of [[herbivorous]] (plant-eating) dinosaurs. Fish found in the formation included [[bony fish]], [[ray-finned fish]], and [[lungfish]]. There were also giant [[Coelacanth|coelacanths]] and [[Sawfish|sawfishes]]. Besides dinosaurs, there were other [[Reptile|reptiles]], like pterosaurs and [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]. Fossils of [[snakes]] and [[Mollusc|molluscs]] have also been found. < ref name= " medeiros20142 "  / > 
 
 The [[fauna]] from the Upper Cretaceous of Brazil is very similar to that of [[Morocco]] and [[Egypt]] during the same time period. This is because [[South America]] and [[Africa]] used to be connected, in a giant [[supercontinent]] called [[Gondwana]]. < ref name= " medeiros20142 "  / > < ref name= " candeiro20152 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Candeiro|first1=Carlos Roberto A.|date=August 2015|title=Middle Cretaceous dinosaur assemblages from northern Brazil and northern Africa and their implications for northern Gondwanan composition|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895981114001424|journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences|volume=61|pages=147–153|doi=10.1016/j.jsames.2014.10.005|bibcode=2015JSAES..61..147C|issn=0895-9811}} < /ref >
