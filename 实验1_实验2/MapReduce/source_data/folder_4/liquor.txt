 '''Liquor''' is any [[alcoholic drink]] containing [[ethanol]] and produced by [[distilling]]. They are also called '''distilled beverages'''. The term '''hard liquor''' is used around [[North America]] and [[India]] to tell distilled beverages from those that are weaker. If the beverage carries no added sugar or has at least 20% alcohol by volume, it is referred to as a '''spirit'''. Alcoholic beverages are under different regulations around the world.
