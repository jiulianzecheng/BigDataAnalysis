'''Hypomania''' is a condition similar to [[mania]] but less severe. < ref > " History and Etymology for hypomania " . [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hypomania#:~:text=%3A%20a%20mild%20mania%20especially%20when%20part%20of%20bipolar%20disorder]. Retrieved 25 June 2021. 
 < /ref >  The symptoms are similar with elevated mood, increased activity, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, racing thoughts, and the like. However, hypomanic episodes differ in that they do not cause significant distress or impair one's work, family, or social life in an obvious way while manic episodes do. 
 
 Hypomanic people tend to be unusually cheerful, have more than ample energy, and need little sleep. Hypomania is a pleasurable state. It may confer a heightened sense of creativity and power. However, hypomania can subtly impair a person's judgment. Too much confidence can hide the consequences of decisions. 
 
 Hypomania can be difficult to diagnose because it may seem mere happiness. It is important to diagnose hypomania because, as an expression of [[bipolar disorder]], it can cycle into [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]] and carry an increased risk of [[suicide]]. 
 
 Hypomania has a reputation of being difficult to treat. There are anti-psychotics and anti-manic drugs, but above all, a person who shows these symptoms needs specialist attention.
