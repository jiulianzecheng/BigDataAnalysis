 '''Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu''' (18 January 1689 – 10 February 1755), was commonly known as '''Montesquieu'''. was a French [[politics|political]] thinker who lived during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age Of Enlightenment.]] He is famous for his [[theory]] of the [[separation of powers]] in [[government]]. Many [[constitution]]s all over the world use it. He helped make the terms  " [[feudalism]] "  and  " [[Byzantine Empire]] "  popular. 
 
 == Political views == 
 Before Montesquieu, the standard feudal system was called  " the three estates " : 
 * the entire [[clergy]] 
 * the [[aristocracy]] (the [[monarch]] was outside the system of  " estates " ) 
 * the  " third estate " : the [[commoner]]s 
 
 Montesquieu's work divided French people into three classes: three classes (or trias politica, a term he coined): 
 * the monarchy 
 * the aristocracy 
 * the commons 
 
 These should be balanced, so that no one power would be able to overcome the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it eliminated the three estates structure. Montesquieu's ideas are important because they ended the [[feudalism|feudalistic]] structure. They also helped inspire the constitution of many countries, including the [[United States]]. 
 
 Some of Montesquieu's ideas are still controversial. He believed that women could be leaders in government. But he thought women could not lead a family. He supported a hereditary aristocracy and [[primogeniture]]. Hereditary means that the title passes from the parents to the children. 
 
 Montesquieu describes an unusual idea in his essays ''The Spirit of the Laws'' and ''Persian Letters''. This idea is the climate theory. It says that [[climate]], the weather of a place, influences the nature of man and his [[society]]. Montesquieu thought that some climates were better than others. He believed the mild climate of France is the best. He believed people from hot countries are  " too hot-tempered " . People in cold, northern countries are  " icy "  or  " stiff. "  The climate in middle Europe therefore breeds the best people. (This view is possibly influenced by similar statements in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by [[Tacitus]], one of Montesquieu's favourite authors.) 
 
 Montesquieu's philosophy that  " government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another "  prompted the creators of the Constitution to divide the U.S. government into three separate branches.
