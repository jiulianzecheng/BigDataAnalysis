 '''Begging''' means asking people for [[money]], [[food]], [[shelter]] or other things, when one is not able to give anything instead. It is also referred to as '''sponging''', '''spanging''' (short for  " spare-changing " ) or (in [[American English]]) '''panhandling'''. 
 
 In larger cities, it is common to see beggars who ask for money, food, or other items. Typically, beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups, mugs, small boxes, hats, or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as  " Help me. I'm homeless. "

 A [[2002]] study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]], those interviewed spent a median of $200 CAD on food and $192 CAD on alcohol, tobacco and [[illegal drugs]]. < ref >

Hwang.{{cite web | url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=121964 | publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal | author=Bose, Rohit and Hwang, Stephen W. | title=Income and spending patterns among panhandlers | date=2002-09-03 | pages=167(5): 477â€“479 | access-date=2006-09-29 }} < /ref >   The [[Fraser Institute]], however, [[criticize]]d this study.  They said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned.  They also said that panhandlers' reports were not reliable  < ref > Bose/Hwang study {{cite web | url=http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/canstats/readdetail.asp?id=406 | title=Begging for Data | publisher=CANSTATS | date=3 September 2002 | access-date=2006-09-29 | archive-date=2006-04-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420120833/http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/canstats/readdetail.asp?id=406 | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Because of this, some people say that it would be better to give the beggars [[gift]] cards or food/service vouchers, instead of money. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.portlandalliance.com/downtown_services/real-change.html | title=Real Change, not Spare Change | publisher=Portland Business Alliance | access-date=2006-09-30 | archive-date=2006-11-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113185159/http://www.portlandalliance.com/downtown_services/real-change.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Some shelters also offer business cards with information on the shelter's location and services, which can be given instead of cash. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~peace_st/homelessness.html | publisher=George Washington University | author=Peace Studies Program | access-date=2006-09-30 | title=Homelessness Contact Cards | archive-date=2006-09-09 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909032358/http://www.gwu.edu/~peace_st/homelessness.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Aggressive panhandling == 
 '''Aggressive panhandling''' means to ask for donations or help in a threatening manner. This is not [[mugging]], but rather similar and therefore often forbidden by law. Examples include: 
 * Asking customers inside a store or restaurant. 
 * Extending a hand, or even the head and both arms, into a car window 
 * Asking after dark, in a secluded area. 
 * There have been reports of beggars who will try to have their limbs [[amputation|amputated]] in the hope that they can get more out of [[sympathy]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5231022.stm | access-date=2006-09-29 | title=Inquiry into 'beggar amputations' | publisher=BBC | last=Sudworth | first=John | date=2006-07-31}} < /ref >
