 '''Layla''' is a [[song]] by [[Derek and the Dominos]]. The song first appeared on the album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''. This song clocks in at 7 minutes and 4 seconds, and it is split into two sections. The first section has the unmistakable [[guitar]] [[riff]], which has two parts to it. The first part is played on a [[Brownie (guitar)|Brownie]] guitar by [[Eric Clapton]]. The next part that comes in is played on a [[Gibson Les Paul]] by [[Duane Allman]]. Clapton also sings the lead vocals. [[Bobby Whitlock]] sings the backup vocals, and he plays the [[organ (music)|keyboard]]. [[Carl Radle]] plays the bass, and [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] plays the drums. He plays the piano part in the second segment, and Allman plays the slide guitar during the piano exit part. Eric Clapton plays the [[acoustic guitar]], which augments the piano. While [[Led Zeppelin]]'s  " [[Stairway to Heaven]] "  builds from a quiet introduction to a hard rock finale,  " Layla "  does pretty much the opposite. The  " bird call "  sound at the end of the song is made by Allman on the slide guitar. 
 
 This song was dedicated to [[Pattie Boyd]], who was already married to [[George Harrison]]. The lyrics have something to do with [[unrequited love]]. The song was also named after a [[fictional character]] in a [[movie]].
