'''Aneuploidy''' is a condition where the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus of a cell]] has one or a few [[chromosome]]s more or less than the usual number in the [[species]]. < ref > Species normally have a set number of chromosomes in each individual, and the term  " aneuploidy "  refers to the chromosome number being different from the usual number for that species. < /ref >  It is a common cause of [[genetic disorders]]. Aneuploidy occurs during [[cell division]] when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. < ref name=Dudek129 >  Dudek R.W. 2007.
