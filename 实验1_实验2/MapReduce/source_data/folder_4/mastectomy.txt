 '''Mastectomy''' is a [[surgery]] to remove the [[breast]]. They may remove one breast or both breasts. They may remove some of the breast, or all of it. 
 
 Mastectomy is often done for people with [[breast cancer]]. Both men and women can get this cancer. Both men and women can need a mastectomy. Some people with a high risk of breast cancer have the operation before the cancer starts. 
 
 If they find a [[tumor]] in the breast, they may only remove part of the breast around the tumor. Then the person might also take drugs ([[chemotherapy]]) to stop the cancer. They might also have a machine send [[energy]] ([[radiation]]) into the breast. Sometimes this can stop the cancer. 
 
 Transgender men also get this surgery to reassign their sex.
