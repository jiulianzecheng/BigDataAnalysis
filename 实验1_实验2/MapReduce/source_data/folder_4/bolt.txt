 A '''bolt''' is a form of grooved [[fastener]] with an external helical male thread that engages the interior female thread of a [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]. Bolts are closely related to, and often confused with, [[screw]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolt|title=Definition of BOLT|website=www.merriam-webster.com}} < /ref > 
 
 A screw is different from a bolt because it does not take a [[nut (hardware)|nut]], and its [[helix|helical]] thread is used to penetrate (cut into) a softer material (such as [[wood]]). 
 
 This distinction is not always clear, and sometimes screws are regarded as bolts without a nut.
