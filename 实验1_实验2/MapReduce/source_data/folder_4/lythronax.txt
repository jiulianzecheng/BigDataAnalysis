 '''''Lythronax''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. It lived about 80 million years ago (mya) in what is now southern [[Utah]]. ''L. argestes'' is the oldest known tyrannosaurid based on its [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] position. < ref name=Loewen >  Loewen M.A. ''et al'' (2013). Tyrant dinosaur evolution tracks the rise and fall of late Cretaceous oceans. In Evans, David C. ''PLoS ONE'' '''8''' (11): e79420.

 Comparisons to [[Tyrannosauridae|its close relatives]] suggest that ''Lythronax'' would have been about {{Convert|8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long, with a weight of around {{convert|2.5|t|lb}} and had a large [[skull]] filled with sharp teeth. < ref name=Lyt > {{cite web|title=''T. rex'' gets a new relative: ''Lythronax argestes'', gore king of the south|url=http://www.walkingwithdinosaurs.com/news/post/lythronax-argestes-gore-king-south-tyrannosaurus/|work=Walking with dinosaurs|publisher=David Hone|accessdate=6 November 2013|archive-date=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108022608/http://www.walkingwithdinosaurs.com/news/post/lythronax-argestes-gore-king-south-tyrannosaurus/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 The rostrum < ref > front part of skull < /ref >  is comparatively short: it makes up less than two thirds of the total [[skull]] length. The whole skull is very broad, 0.4 times as wide as long. Overall, the skull is similar to that of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tarbosaurus]]''. Its robust jaws have two sizes of teeth: its first five teeth are much larger than the other six. Behind the skull, the rest of the [[skeleton]] is similar to that of other tyrannosaurids. < ref name=Loewen/ >
