 '''Rajput''' is a community of India which claim descent from many [[rulers]] or [[King|kings]].  < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6xVm9lkknUC|title=Social Change and Development in Medieval Indian History|last=Chandra|first=Satish|date=2008|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|isbn=978-81-241-1386-8|language=en|quote=Modern historians are more or less agreed that the Rajputs consisted of miscellaneous groups including shudras and tribals.

 ==Origin== 
 According to V.A. Smith, Rajput is a mixed race. Rajputs have descended from the foreign invaders like Sakas, Kushans and Hunas. V.A. Smith states that Rajputs were born of various races and castes. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPQOEAAAQBAJ|title=Indian History  &  Culture Compendium for IAS Prelims General Studies Paper 1  &  State PSC Exams 4th Edition|last=Experts|first=Disha|publisher=Disha Publications|isbn=978-93-90486-68-7|language=en|quote=According V.A.

 According to Harbans Singh Bhatia, It would appear that [[Brahmin|Brahmans]], Bhars, [[Ahir|Ahirs]], [[Jats]], [[Gurjar|Gujars]], and [[Huns]] have all contributed to the Rajput clans. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0sMAQAAIAAJ|title=Political, Legal, and Military History of India|last=Bhatia|first=Harbans Singh|date=1984|publisher=Deep  &  Deep Publications|language=en|quote=It would appear that Brahmans, Bhars, Ahirs, Jats, Gujars, and Huns have all contributed to the Rajput clans.}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Rajputs in Hindu Dharmashastras== 
 Ananya Vajpeyi discusses the Rajputs in the context of Hindu [[Dharmaśāstra|Sanskrit Dharmashastra]] texts and shows the dissonance between the meaning of Rajput in the practical political arena  versus the literal meaning of ''rajaputa'' in Hindu religious texts and how both meanings could coexist.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=257-258}}  
   
 ''Vishvambhara Shastra'' states that : " An Ugra (Śūdra mother, Kshatriya father) makes a living by the arts of war.   
 Skilled with the sword and bow, he is expert in combat. He stands apart among men as the mighty ''Rajput'' " . < ref > {{cite thesis|title= The Sudracarasiromani of Krsna Sesa: A 16th century manual of dharma for Sudras|author=Theodore Benke|year=2010|pages=96,97|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}} < /ref > 
   
 Similar view is held by the ''Jatinirnayaprakaranama'' of ''Sudrakamalakara'', an early 1600s Dharmaśāstra text written by Kamalakarabhatta  
 (uncle of the notable Brahmin scholar Gaga Bhatt) for a ''rajaputa''. Vajpeyi clarifies that although ''ugra'' literally means scary or fierce, in this context the medieval writers only used this term in the context of his qualities as a warrior.  
 Seshasakrishna's ''Sudracarasiromani'', a text that predates ''Sudrakamalakara'' also supports this definition for a ''rajaputa''.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=257}} 
   
 Vajpeyi notes that Kamalakarabhatta makes a professional and religious distinction: a ''rajaputa'' may fight, however, he has to follow the duties similar to sudras or ''sudrasamana''. She says ''Ugra''  or ''rajaputa'' is listed as one of the six types of a ''sankarajati''(mixed caste) given in the text, whose father's varna is higher than that of the mother, and are thus an ''anulomajas'' or  " one born in accordance with the natural flow " . There are five other types of ''anulomajas''  unions given by Kamalakarabhatta. Thus, as  per the medieval Brahminical Dharmashastras, Rajputs are a mixed ''jati''.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=257}} In the practical political context,  
 the word meaning edges towards  Kshatriya although in Hindu religious texts ''rajaputa'' is closer to Shudra.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=258}} 
   
 Some emigrant Brahmins may have been involved in Rajputising tribes to the Rajput status.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=257}} Despite this, Vajpayi states that, periodically, Brahmins have characterized Rajput as self-seekers, and stated that they are not real Kshatriyas.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=258}} Other than establishing marital ties with already established Rajput families,  
 constructing false genealogies and adopting titles such as  " rana " , Rajputising also involved starting the pretensions of rituals of twice-borns ( wearing sacred thread etc.).{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=254}} However, one  ritual that was not given much significance was the Abhisheka. When a clan leader was made king by the Mughal emperor, the Tika mark on the head of leader by the Muslim emperor confirmed his Royal status and the Hindu ritual of Abhisheka was only of secondary importance. Aurangzeb eventually stopped the custom of ''Tika'' and the custom was replaced by bowing or ''taslim'' to the Mughal emperor, who would return the salute. According to Vajpayi, this possibly implies that it was still up to the Mughal emperor to ultimately give or deny the Rajput status to the clan leader.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=251}} 
   
 The description of Rajputs in the Hindu Dharmashastras, self image that the Rajputs presented, and the Mughal view of the Rajputs was disparate. This incongruity, according to Vajpayi makes the Rajput identity Polyphonous.{{sfn|Ananya Vajpeyi|2005|pp=258}}
