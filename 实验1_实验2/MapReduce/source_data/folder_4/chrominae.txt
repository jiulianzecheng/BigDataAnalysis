In addition, the genera ''[[Acanthochromis]]'' and ''[[Altrichthys]]'' which the 5th edition of Fishes of the World included in this subfamily have been [[wikt:reclassified|reclassified]] as belonging to the [[Pomacentrinae]]. < ref name = CofF > {{Cof family|family=Pomacentridae|access-date=2 October 2022}} < /ref >
