 The '''Kaskaskia''' were one of the Native American tribes of the Northeastern Woodlands. They were one of about a dozen [[cognate]] tribes that made up the [[Illiniwek|Illiniwek Confederation]] (also called the [[Illinois Confederation]]). They mostly lived in the [[Great Lakes]] region. Their first contact with Europeans happened in 1667 near present-day [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] at a [[Jesuit]] [[Mission (station)|mission station]]. 
 
 The descendants of the Kaskaskia, along with the [[Wea]] and [[Piankeshaw]], are in the [[Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]]. That means they are a [[federally recognized tribe]] in [[Oklahoma]]. < ref > House, Office of the Law Revision Counsel.
