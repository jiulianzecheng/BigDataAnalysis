'''Poetry''' is written, spoken or sung [[language]] that is used in stronger or more original ways than [[prose]] is used. Poetry uses the ''[[Meaning|meanings]]'' of words as prose does; but it also uses the ''[[Sound|sounds]]'' of words as if they were [[music]], especially [[Rhyme|rhymes]], other repeating sounds, and [[Rhythm|rhythms]] ([[Tempo|beats]] or [[Meter (poetry)|meters]]). < ref > " poetry " .

 Poetry arranges words and groups of words to make [[Repetition|repetitions]] and [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelisms]]. Poetry uses [[Figure of speech|figures of speech]], [[Ellipsis|ellipses]] and [[delayed identifications|delayed identification]] to suggest that there is more meaning in the language. 
 
 Some people believe that poetry began when language began. They think it is probably  " as old as [[history]] and older, present wherever [[religion]] is present.
