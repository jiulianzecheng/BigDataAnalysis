'''Hypnagogia''' is the [[altered state of consciousness|state of mind]] that exists between being awake and [[sleep]], or just after waking up. 
 
 People in this state may have experiences that resemble [[hallucination]]s, but are not. The person usually knows that it is not real, but very often nothing can be done against it. Most of these ''pseudohallucinations'' are [[sight|visual]] experiences. 
 
 Other experiences that may happen are [[sleep paralysis]] and [[lucid dream]]s. All of these [[symptom]]s happen because of the changes that occur in the [[brain]], and they are not linked to a [[disease]]. 
 
 The writings of [[Aristotle]] already talk  about hypnagogia. In more recent centuries, many authors have referred to the state. [[Edgar Allan Poe]], for example, wrote of the  " fancies "  he experienced  " only when I am on the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so " . < ref name= " mavromatis4 " > {{cite book |title=Hypnagogia: the unique state of consciousness between wakefulness and sleep |first=Andreas |last=Mavromatis |publisher=London: Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1987 |page=4 |isbn=0-7102-0282-2}} < /ref > 
 
 Serious scientific inquiry began in the 19th century with [[Johannes Peter MÃ¼ller]], [[Jules Baillarger]] and [[Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury|Alfred Maury]], and continued into the 20th century with Leroy. < ref > Leroy, E.B. 1933.

 With [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) in the mid 20th century, detecting such a state has become easier.
