 '''''Riojasaurus''''' was a [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[prosauropod]] [[dinosaur]]. It was one of the earliest of the large, plant-eating [[dinosaur]]s. ''Riojasaurus'' lived during the [[Upper Triassic]], roughly 225 to 219 million years ago. Fossils have been found in [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja Province]] in [[Argentina]]. There are include incomplete skeletons from about 20 individuals. 
 
 ''Riojasaurus'' had a heavy body, bulky legs, and a long neck and tail. Its leg bones were dense and massive for a prosauropod. < ref name=Dodson > " Riojasaurus. "  In: Dodson, Peter ''et al'' ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International, 41. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}}. < /ref >  By contrast, its [[vertebrae]] were lightened by hollow cavities, and unlike most prosauropods, ''Riojasaurus'' had four [[sacrum|sacral vertebrae]] instead of three. < ref name=Dodson/ > 
 
 It probably moved slowly on all fours and could not rear up on its back legs. < ref name=Dodson/ > < ref name= " HeerdenGalton97 " > Van Heerden J. and Galton P.M. 1997.
