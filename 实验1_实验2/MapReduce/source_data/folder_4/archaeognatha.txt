 '''Archaeognatha''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of wingless [[insect]]s, also known as ''jumping bristletails''. They are among those insects which changed least during [[evolution]]. They first appear in the [[Devonian]] period along with the [[arachnid]]s (Spiders). The name Archaeognatha is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Archaeos'' meaning  " ancient "  and ''gnatha'' meaning  " [[mouthparts|jaw]] " . This refers to the [[articulation]] of the [[mandible]]s, which has a single condyle, where all higher insects have two. An alternate name, ''Microcoryphia'' comes from the Greek ''micro'' meaning  " small "  and ''coryphia'' meaning head. 
 
 The Order Archaeognatha has previously been combined with the Order [[Thysanura]], or bristletails. Both groups have three-pronged tails with two [[cercus|cerci]] and an epiproct. Archaeognatha differ from Thysanura in that they are able to use their tail to spring up to 30 & nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] into the air.  < !-- 
 They are also the only ones to have small, articulated  " styli "  on the hind (and sometimes middle) [[arthropod leg|coxae]] and [[sternite]]s 2 to 9, which are sometimes considered to be rudimentary [[appendage]]s, as well as paired eversible vesicles (membranous water-absorbing organs). Further unusual features are that the abdominal sternites are each composed of three [[sclerite]]s, and they cement themselves to the substrate before [[ecdysis|molting]]. -- >  Like [[Thysanura]], the body is covered with scales, with a thin [[exoskeleton]] that is susceptible to dehydration. 
 
 There are approximately 350 species in the two families. They are distributed worldwide, and unusual in the insect world in that they can even be found in the [[Arctic]] where they live in leaf litter and rock crevices. They feed primarily on [[algae]], but also [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es, or decaying organic materials. 
 
 There are no species at current conservation risk, though the order is one of the most poorly-studied among insects, and therefore it may simply be that no one has yet recognized that any species are at risk.
