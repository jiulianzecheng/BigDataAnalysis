 ==Partial or full repeals== 
 
 A '''partial repeal''' occurs when a specified part or [[Wikt:provision|provision]] of a previous [[Law|act]] is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the [[Acts of Union 1800]], providing for the union between the formerly separate [[kingdom]]s of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom]], was partially repealed in 1922. This was when (as a consequence of the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]), twenty-six of the thirty-two [[County|counties]] of Ireland were constituted as the [[Irish Free State]], and ceased to be part of the United Kingdom. 
 
 A '''full repeal''' occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed. 
 
 ==Repeal with or without re-enactment== 
 
 A typical situation where an Act is '''repealed and re-enacted''' is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era.  Re-enactment can be with or without [[amendment]]. However, repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a Consolidation Bill (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area). 
 
 For example the repeal of the [[Poor Law]]s in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation. 
 
 A '''repeal without replacement''' is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned. Many repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in [[society]].  Major examples include: 
 *the old [[Jim Crow laws]] or [[blue law]]s in the US 
 *The [[Corn Laws]] in [[England]], repealed in 1846 after a passionate campaign. 
 *Repeal of [[Prohibition]] in the [[United States]]. Enacted by the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], it proved to be so [[Wikt:ineffective|ineffective]] that it had to be repealed by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]]. This is the only [[constitutional amendment]] to be repealed in the U.S. 
 *The massive [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007 (Ireland)|Statute Law Revision Act 2007]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]], through which 3,225 Acts were repealed, dating back over eight centuries to 1171 and the earliest laws enacted by [[England]] when it began its invasion of [[Ireland]]. The statutes repealed include a number of Acts of significant historical interest, including an Act of 1542 providing that the Kings of England shall be Kings of Ireland. This Act is the largest single repealing statute in the [[history of Ireland]]. 
 *[[Don't ask, don't tell]] was a policy of the [[US]] military signed into law by president [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993. Service members could not be asked their [[sexual orientation]]. < ref name=MilFindLaw > {{cite web |url=http://military.findlaw.com/administrative-issues-benefits/the-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-and-what-it-means-for-you.html |title=The Repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and What it Means for You|publisher=Military FindLaw |access-date=16 November 2015}} < /ref >  They were also not allowed to discuss the subject among themselves. < ref name=MilFindLaw/ >  Congress passed a law in 2010 to repeal the policy. < ref name=MilFindLaw/ >
