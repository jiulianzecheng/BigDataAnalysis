 In [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought, '''bodhicitta''' is the motivation of a [[bodhisattva]]. The word ''bodhicitta'' combines the words for enlightenment ''([[Bodhi]])'' and  mind ''([[Citta]])''. It is sometimes translated as ''mind of enlightenment''. 
 
 Bodhicitta is taught to be the intent to become enlightened, not for oneself, but for the benefit of ''all'' beings.
