 '''Omega''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Ω ω''') is the 24th and the last letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. It stood for a long  " o "  sound in [[Ancient Greek]]. It still stands for  " o "  in [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]], but there is no longer a difference between long and short vowels, so it sounds the same as [[Omicron]]. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it stands for the number 800.  
 
 There was also once a letter  " Omega "  [[Ѡ]] in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]. It was there so people could spell Greek names both in Cyrillic and in Greek in the same way. However, this letter is no longer used today. 
 
 In [[mathematics]], the uppercase omega Ω is used in big-Omega notation (a variant of [[Big O notation|big-O notation]]). It is also used to represent the [[Omega constant]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-20|title=Greek/Hebrew/Latin-based Symbols in Mathematics|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/greek-hebrew-latin-symbols/|access-date=2020-10-07|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  In [[electromagnetism]] and [[engineering]], the uppercase Ω is used as the symbol for [[ohm]]s, < ref > {{Cite web|title=Omega Symbol in Greek Alphabet Ohm Symbol|url=https://www.greeksymbols.net/omega-symbol|access-date=2020-10-07|website=www.greeksymbols.net|language=en}} < /ref >  which are the units of [[electrical resistance]].
