 '''Halakha''' is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for the [[Jewish]] code of laws. 
 
 == History == 
 A long time ago, these laws were [[oral]] (spoken, but not written down). Once they became written down they were called the [[Mishnah]]. The [[Mishnah]] was made by [[rabbi]]s in the 1st and 2nd Century (CE).
