 '''''Primula''''' is a [[genus]] of 400–500 [[species]] of low-growing [[herb]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Primulaceae]]. They include primrose, cowslip and oxlip.  
 
 Many species are grown for their ornamental [[flower]]s. They are native to the temperate [[Northern Hemisphere]], south into tropical [[mountain]]s in [[Ethiopia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[New Guinea]], and in temperate southern [[South America]]. 
 
 Perennial primulas bloom mostly during the spring; their flowers can be [[purple]], [[yellow]], [[red]], [[pink]], or [[white]]. Generally, they prefer filtered [[sunlight]]. Many species are adapted to [[Alps|alpine]] [[climate]]s. 
 
 The word ''primula'' is the [[Latin]] feminine [[diminutive]] of ''primus'', meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring.  
 
 Primroses are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e ([[caterpillar]]s) of some [[Lepidoptera]] species. 
 
 Some flowering forms of (cultivated) ''Primula'' are commonly known as polyanthus (''P. elatior'' hybrids) as opposite to primrose (''P. vulgaris'' hybrids). 
 
 == Heterostyly == 
 The common primrose, ''Primula vulgaris'', shows [[heterostyly]]. This is a type of [[Polymorphism|morphism]] with flower forms which differ in the lengths of the [[pistil]] and [[stamen]]s. 
 
 The morph [[phenotype]] is [[genetic]]ally closely linked to genes responsible for a system of self-incompatibility. < ref > 'closely linked' means close together on the same [[chromosome]]. < /ref >  That means the [[pollen]] from a flower on one morph cannot [[Fertilization|fertilize]] another flower of the same morph.  
 
 In one morph (termed ''''pin'''') the stamens are short and the pistils are long; in the second morph (termed ''''thrum'''') the stamens are long and the pistils are short. The length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph, and vice versa. < ref name=CDLinn > Darwin, Charles 1862.
