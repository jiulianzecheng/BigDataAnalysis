 In [[Finance|financial]] markets, '''stock''' is the partial ownership of a company. Shareholders bear the financial ([[Limited liability corporation|but not legal]]) risk of the corporation, and receive [[Dividend|dividends]], which are a piece of the [[net income]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Dividends: A Complete Guide|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp|access-date=2022-04-19|website=Investopedia|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 A person or [[organization]] which holds ''shares'' of stocks is called a [[shareholder]]. The value of the stock multiplied by the [[shares outstanding]] is the [[market capitalization]]. This is the most common metric for valuing a publicly traded company. 
 
 Stocks can be bought and sold privately or on [[stock exchange]]s. Someone who buys and sells stock on the behalf of another individual is called a [[stockbroker]]. 
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], the term ''share'' is used the same way as ''stock'' is described in the [[United States]].
