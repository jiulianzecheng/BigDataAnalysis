The '''cryosphere''' is the part of the [[Earth]]â€™s surface where [[water]] is in [[solid]] form, including [[sea ice]], lake ice, river [[ice]], [[snow]] cover, [[glaciers]], [[ice cap]]s and [[ice sheet]]s, and frozen ground (which includes [[permafrost]]). It often overlaps with the [[hydrosphere]], the water on, under and over the surface of the Earth. The cryosphere is an important part of the [[global climate]] system. It influences surface energy, [[cloud]]s, [[precipitation]], [[hydrology]], and the way both air and water move about in the [[atmosphere]] and [[ocean]]s. The cryosphere is important to understanding how the climate of Earth works and how it affects global climate. The word ''cyrosphere'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''cryo'' meaning  " [[cold]] "  or  " to cold " .
