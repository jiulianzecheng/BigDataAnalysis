 '''Chemiluminescence''' (or '''Chemoluminescence''') is a kind of [[luminescence]]. It is a process of making [[light]] from a [[chemical reaction]]. Chemiluminescence in [[biological]] [[systems]] is called [[bioluminescence]].  
 
 The light made in chemiluminiscence is not directly related to [[heat]]. A simple two step example of a reaction of A, and B, that produces; C, D, and light. 
 :['''A'''] + ['''B'''] → ['''C < sup > * < /sup > '''] + [''D''] 
 :['''C < sup > * < /sup > '''] → ['''C'''] + '''Light'''  
 '''C < sup > * < /sup > ''' is an [[excited state]] of '''C'''.  
 
 This reaction is simpler than most chemiluminesence reactions. The excited state happens when [[electrons]] are pushed into a  higher [[orbit]] by the energy of a chemical  reaction. The excited state is less stable than the [[ground state]]. The [[electrons]] in the excited state fall to the [[ground state]] (lower energy), emitting light.  
 
 The amount of measurable light made is called ''radiant intensity'': I < sub > CL < /sub >  ([[photons]] [[Emission|emitted]] per [[second]]).  
 
 == Analytical applications== 
 The device needed to measure the light made is simple. It needs something to hold the sample, and a [[Photomultiplier tubes|photomultiplier]] tube. There are three ways for this to be used in chemical measurements.  
 #sometimes the product wanted makes light when it reacts with another [[Chemical compound|compound]],  
 #in another type the amount of light made drops when the wanted product is added,  
 #sometimes the wanted product when added to a chemiluminescence reaction makes more light(a [[Catalysis|catalytic]] reaction). 
 
 === Analysis of gases === 
 The method measures small amounts of [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[pollutants]]. A common method measures the amount of [[nitrogen]] [[monoxide]] by reacting it with [[ozone]]. The light made has a [[wavelength]] range of 600 to 2800 & nbsp;nm. 
 
 === Analysis of liquids === 
 [[Luminol]] is the most well known type of compound used for chemiluminescence in liquids.  
 
 === Analysis of cell organelles === 
 '''Ca < sup > 2+ < /sup > '''([[calcium]]) inside of different parts of [[cells]] like the [[mitochondria]] can make light when it reacts with a [[protein]] from [[jellyfish]] named [[aequorin]]. [[Nitric oxide]](NO) is in cells and is a way for cells to [[Transmitter|talk]] to each other, this can be measured with the compound [[luminol]].  
 
 ==Other examples== 
 *An example of chemiluminescence molecules in nature is [[firefly]] [[luciferin]]. 
 *The process is used to make [[glowstick]]s.
