 A '''paperback''' is a type of [[book]]. It has a cover of thick [[paper]] or thin [[cardboard]]. Paperback book covers can bend and be folded. The covers are laminated (have layers), and some of the methods are more durable (lasting) than others. Another name for paperback is ''soft cover''.   
 
 Paperback books may be [[glue]]d or held by [[sewing]]. If the pages are held only by [[adhesive]], the book will eventually come apart. The quality of the paper also varies. It is generally less white than bound hardback books because it is less [[bleach]]ed. 
 
 Usually, paperback books cost less money than [[hardback]] books. In the middle 20th century a  " mass market "  type of paperback became commonplace, having a standard size, fitting a standard display rack, and glued.
