 '''Blond''' or '''blonde''' is a light color of [[hair]] or a person with this color hair. The spelling ''blonde'' means a female with this hair colour, and the spelling ''blond'' may mean a male with the same hair color. The color itself can have either spelling (''blonde'' or ''blond''), according to [[Merriam-Webster|''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary'']]. 
 
 Natural blonds have quite fair skins, and their skin is finer (less thick) than people with dark skin. Light skin is natural amongst people living (or whose ancestors lived) in northern climates. It is an [[adaptation]] for their skins to make [[vitamin D]]. This vitamin is essential for health, and people in northern climates may not make enough.  
 
 One thing to mention: hair colour may change during life, and many children have blond hair at first, but it grows darker as they get older. That's a normal thing. Blondes do not make the [[melanin]] for their hair (and skin) to go dark. It is very unusual to see a blond person with dark skin, but it does happen occasionally.  
 
 People who are blonde have less pigment in their hair than dark haired people. To be blonde is usually to have blonde ancestors. It is not [[albinism]]. People may also use [[chemical]]s to make themselves blonde, but that is just a fashion thing.  
 
 ''Natural'' blondes are most common around the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The [[Nordic countries]] such as [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], and [[Finland]] also have many blond people. [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] also have a high number of natural blondes.

 [[File:Light hair coloration map.png|thumb|300px|Anthropologist [[Peter Frost]]'s map of blonde hair. In the lightest yellow area, blonde hair is the most common (80 per cent or more of the native population). The darker the colour, the fewer blondes. In the darkest area, there are almost no native blondes.]]
