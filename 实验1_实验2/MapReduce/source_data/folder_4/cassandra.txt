 '''Cassandra''' or '''Kassandra''' ({{lang-el|Κασσάνδρα}}, also 'Alexandra') was a person in [[Greek mythology]]. She was the daughter of King [[Priam]] of [[Troy]] and [[Hecuba]], and twin sister of [[Helenus]]. She was famous for her [[prophesy|prophesies]] of bad [[event]]s. 
 
 The god [[Apollo]] gave her the gift of [[prophecy]] so that she would love him, but Kassandra did not want him. This made Apollo angry, but he could only change his gift and not take it away. So he made it that Kassandra could only foresee bad things, and that no one would ever believe her. 
 
 In the [[Trojan War]] Kassandra knew of the trick with the [[Trojan Horse]], but no one believed her, and so Troy was destroyed. After the Trojan War she became a [[slave]] of [[Agamemnon]]. She warned him that his wife [[Klytaimnestra]] would kill him. But he would not believe her, and so Agamemnon was killed, and Kassandra shortly after him. 
 
 There is a work called ''[[Alexandra (Lykrophon)|Alexandra]]'' by Lykrophon. The poet is only known through this work which was done between 196 and 190 BC. The work has 1474 lines, which are done in jambic trimeters. This is what most Greek [[tragedy|tragedies]] were written in.
