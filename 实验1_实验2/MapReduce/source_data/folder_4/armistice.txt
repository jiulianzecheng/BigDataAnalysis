 An '''armistice''' is the effective end of a [[war]], when the parties agree to stop fighting. The word comes from the [[Latin]] ''arma'', meaning weapons and ''statium'', meaning a stopping.  
 
 A truce or [[ceasefire]] usually refers to a ''temporary'' stop of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area. A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice.  
 An armistice is not the same as a [[peace treaty]], which may take months or even years to agree on. The 1953 [[Korean War]] armistice  < ref > {{cite web

 The [[United Nations Security Council]] often demands cease-fire of parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than UN cease-fire resolutions in modern [[international law]].  
 
 The most famous armistice is the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany at the end of World War I]], on [[11 November]], [[1918]], signed near [[Compiègne]], France, and effective at the  " eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. "   < ref > {{cite web
