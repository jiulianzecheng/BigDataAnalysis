 '''Telestrations''' is a [[party game]] in which players must draw an object listed on a card, then guess what the other players have drawn. USAopoly makes the game. 
 
 == Gameplay == 
 All players have a drawing book and a marker each. At the start of each round, they get a card with a list of secret words, all with a number between one and six. One player rolls a die, then all players have sixty seconds to draw the word or phrase with that number on page one of their drawing book. 
 
 After the sixty seconds, the players pass their books to the player on their left. On page two, the players guess what was drawn on page one of the book that was passed to them. When all players have written their guesses, they turn their books to page three and again pass their books to the left. Players draw and guess until they have their original books back. 
 
 The players then take turns revealing what was drawn and guessed in their books, then award points. Each player awards:  
 * One point to the player who drew their favorite sketch in their book 
 * One point to the player who made their favorite guess in their book 
 * One point to themselves if the final guess is the same as the secret word 
 
 The player with the most points after three rounds wins the game. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.usaopoly.com/games/telestrations|title=Telestrations® 8 Player: The Original|date=2013-11-21|website=USAopoly|language=en|access-date=2018-12-09|archive-date=2018-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209124050/https://www.usaopoly.com/games/telestrations|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
