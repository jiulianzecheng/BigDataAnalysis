 '''''Buitreraptor''''' is a small [[dromaeosaur]] from the [[Cretaceous]] of [[Argentina]]. It was about four to five feet long (1.5 metres). < ref > Paul G.S. 2010. ''The Princeton field guide to dinosaurs''. Princeton University Press, 139. < /ref > 
 
 ''Buitreraptor'' has a slender, flat, extremely elongated snout. Its jaws have many small teeth which lack meat-tearing serrations or cutting edges. They are grooved, strongly recurved and flattened. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Gianechini F.A. |author2=Makovicky P.J|author3=Apesteguía S.|year=2011 |title=The teeth of the unenlagiine theropod ''Buitreraptor'' from the Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina, and the unusual dentition of the Gondwanan dromaeosaurids |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=279–290 |url= |doi= 10.4202/app.2009.0127|pmid= |pmc= |s2cid=62811731}} < /ref >  This probably meant it ate quite small animals, like [[lizards]] and [[mammals]].  
 
 Since its close relatives had [[feathers]], it is likely that ''Buitreraptor'' also was feathered.
