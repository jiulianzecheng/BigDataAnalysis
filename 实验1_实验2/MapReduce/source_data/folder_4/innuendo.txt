It can also be a remark or question, often disparaging  (also called '''insinuation'''), that works indirectly by [[allusion]]. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used, taken literally, seem to be innocent in the direct meaning (but have a negative unspoken meaning).
