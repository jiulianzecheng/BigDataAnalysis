 '''Paracetamol''' (or '''acetaminophen''') is a common [[analgesic]], a [[drug]] that is used to relieve [[pain]]. It can also be used to reduce [[fever]], and some kinds of [[headache]]. This makes it an [[antipyretic]], something that reduces fevers. It is used in many drugs that treat [[influenza|the flu]] and [[cold]]s. 
 
 The words ''acetaminophen'' and ''paracetamol'' both come from the names of the chemicals used in the compound: N-'''acet'''yl-para-'''aminophen'''ol and '''par'''a-'''acet'''yl-'''am'''ino-phen'''ol'''. Sometimes, it is shortened to '''APAP''', for N-'''a'''cetyl-'''p'''ara-'''a'''mino'''p'''henol. 
 
 [[Harmon Northrop Morse]] was the first to make Paracetamol, in the year [[1878]]. Drugs made with Paracetamol became common in the 1950s. Today, these drugs are some of the most used, together with those containing [[salicylic acid]] or [[Ibuprofen]]. In the year [[1977]], Paracetamol was put on the [[List of World Health Organization Essential Medicines|List of Essential Medicines]] of the [[WHO]]. 
 
 ==Safety and dosage== 
 Paracetamol is considered safe for use. The drug is easily available without a [[prescription]]. People often take too much Paracetamol. Sometimes this is because people do not know how much they should take. The recommended [[wikt:dose|dose]] may not work for some individuals. Other times it is because they are trying to commit [[suicide]]. Very often, a person's [[liver]] can be hurt when they take too much Paracetamol. < ref name= " Paracetamol_Larson " > {{cite journal | author = Larson A.

 In [[England]] and [[Wales]], about 30.000 people per year go to the hospital after taking too much paracetamol (called paracetamol poisoning), and about 150 die of the poisoning. Since a law was passed saying that Paracetamol packets cannot be too large, fewer people have been committing suicide with Paracetamol. < ref name= " pmid17407385 " > {{cite journal |author=Morgan OW, Griffiths C, Majeed A |title=Interrupted time-series analysis of regulations to reduce paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning |journal=PLOS Med. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=e105 |date=April 2007  |pmid=17407385 |pmc=1845154 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040105}} < /ref >  In [[Great Britain]] < ref name= " Paracetamol_Chun " > {{cite journal | author = Chun, L.
