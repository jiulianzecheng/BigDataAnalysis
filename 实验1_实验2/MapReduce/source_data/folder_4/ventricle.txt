#REDIRECT [[Ventricle (heart)]] 
 < !--Ventricles refer to the left and right side of the heart. As the deoxyginated blood enters the heart on the right hand side. First into the right chamber, it receives a level of cleansing all the way to the left ventricles. This process is repeated in all four Chambers until the oxygenated blood exit on the left ventricles as blood with oxygen.
