[[File:Backyard_Fun.jpg|thumb|An Armbra]] 
 A '''handbra''' is the practice of covering a woman's [[Breast|breasts]], including her [[Nipple|nipples]] and [[Areola|areolas]], with one's hands, which would otherwise have been exposed. When arms are used instead, it is called an ''armbra''. 
 
 A handbra may be used by [[Woman|women]] to maintain their [[modesty]], or in compliance with [[censorship]] guidelines. It is also used in poses for [[photography]].
