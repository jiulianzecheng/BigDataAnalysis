 '''''Vheissu''''' is an [[album]] by [[experimental rock|experimental]] [[band]] [[Thrice]]. It was released in 2005. The album introduced a new sound to the bands [[post-hardcore]] roots. It also used many new elements from [[music box]]es to [[chain gang]]s and has much softer, dreamy songs such as  " Atlantic " 
 
 The songs on ''Vheissu'' use many [[Bible|biblical]] [[theme]]s but Thrice does not think of themselves as a [[Christianity|Christian]] band. Some of the statements from the album which are clearly from the bible include: 
 
 *''There's no greater love, then that one shed his blood for his friends'' - from  " For Miles " 
 *''We were all lost, and now we're found'' - from  " Image of the Invisible " 
 *''Once again the bread and wine'' - from  " From Moths to Flame "
