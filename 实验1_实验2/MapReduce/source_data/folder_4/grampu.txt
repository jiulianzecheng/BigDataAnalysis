 ==Role== 
 Grampu is an old man. He lives with his two grandkids, Oobi and Uma. Their parents and grandma are never seen or talked about, so Grampu is the only one who takes care of them. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.moderndaydad.com/posts/2006/02/where_the_hell_-1|title=Where the hell are Oobi's parents?|work=Modern Day Dad|date=February 12, 2006}} < /ref >  He likes to teach them about the world. He shows them how to do new things. As a [[running gag]] (repeated joke) in the show, Grampu is very unlucky and usually has to clean up messes that the kids make. 
 
 Grampu's favorite things to do are [[cooking]] and growing plants in his [[garden]]. < ref > {{cite episode|title=Garden Day!|series=Oobi|season=1|number=7a|network=Noggin|airdate=2003|credits=Directors: Josh Selig, Pam Arciero, Kevin Lombard}} < /ref >  When he is in the kitchen, he wears a big [[chef]]'s hat and an [[apron]].

 Grampu has hazel eyes and doesn't wear any clothes. His hand is in a different position from the other characters.

 ==Creation== 
 Grampu was made by [[Josh Selig]], the maker of the whole show. Josh Selig wanted to show a non-traditional family: a family that was different from most ones shown on TV. This is why he came up with the idea for Oobi and Uma to live with their single grandpa. 
 
 In the first episodes of ''Oobi'', which were short two-minute stories, Grampu was a secondary character who did not show up very much. When the show was turned into a longer half-hour program, Grampu got a bigger role. The show writers used him as a [[:en:foil (literature)|foil]] (a contrasting character) to the kids, or as someone to give them advice. Grampu appeared more than he used to, and he was part of almost every single episode. 
 
 The person who played the role of Grampu was [[Tyler Bunch]]. Bunch is a [[puppet]]eer (an actor who works with puppets) known from the show ''[[Sesame Street]]''. While he was playing the part of Grampu, Bunch had to never [[shave]] his arm, so that Grampu would look like an old, hairy man. < ref name= " Oobi Does It " > {{cite news|title=''Oobi'' Does It: The creator of a popular children's show discusses his low-tech success|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6153394/site/newsweek|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027075904/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6153394/site/newsweek|archive-date=October 27, 2004|last=Gostin|first=Nicki|date=October 1, 2004|access-date=March 13, 2016|work=Newsweek|publisher=IBT Media|via=[[NBCNews.com|MSNBC News]]}} < /ref >  This was different from the other actors, who all had to shave their arms because they played kid characters. Bunch had a [[manicure|manicurist]] who filed his nails every week during filming. < ref name= " Oobi Does It " / > 
 
 ==Reception== 
 Grampu has gotten a good reception from viewers and critics. Many parents who watched ''Oobi'' with their kids thought he was the funniest part of the show. In an interview, Josh Selig said  " many mothers seem to have developed a 'thing' for Grampu. " < ref name= " gothamist "  / >  [[:en:Neal Pollack|Neal Pollack]], a writer of comedy books, called him  " a hilarious character "  in his book ''Alternadad''. < ref name= " alternadad " > {{cite book|author=Neal Pollack|title=Alternadad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RneMXUAKUQUC & pg=PA275|date=January 9, 2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-375-42480-9|pages=275–}} < /ref >  He also wrote that Grampu seemed like a  " children's TV character with whom we could spend an afternoon if [he] magically came to life. " < ref name= " alternadad " / > 
 
 The newspaper ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' included Grampu as a good example of an unusual family unit in children's TV. < ref name= " stpaul " > {{cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com:80/mld/twincities/10821460.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219095920/http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/10821460.htm|archive-date=February 19, 2005|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|title=Bunny not alone in kids' TV plague|last=Billings|first=Laura|date=February 6, 2005|access-date=September 15, 2020|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In a satirical article that made fun of people wanting to keep gay and single parents out of media for kids, the newspaper called attention to Grampu being a single stay-home parent with a foreign girlfriend (Inka). < ref name= " stpaul " / > 
 
 ==Other media==

From 2006 to 2013, toy versions of Grampu's puppet eyes (made of the material [[acrylic]]) were sold on an online shopping site called OobiEyes.com. < ref name= " oobieyes " > {{cite web|work=OobiEyes.com|title=Oobi Eyes Varieties|url=http://www.oobieyes.com/eyes.html|date=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706201048/http://www.oobieyes.com/eyes.html|archive-date=July 6, 2007}} < /ref >  They were available in different sizes for kids' and adults' hands. < ref name= " oobieyes " / >
