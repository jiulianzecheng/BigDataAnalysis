 The '''Franks''' or the '''Frankish peoples''' were one of several west Germanic federations of [[tribe]]s. < ref > Jo Ann H. Moran Cruz and Richard Gerberding, ''Medieval Worlds: An Introduction to European History'' Houghton Mifflin Company 2004, p. 80 < /ref >  It was formed out of Germanic tribes: Salians, Sicambri, Chamavi, Tencteri, Chattuarii, Bructeri, Usipetes, Ampsivarii, Chatti. Most of them lived at the northern borders of the Rhine. 
 
 They entered the late [[Roman Empire]] from the north and east river bank of the Rhine into modern northern [[Belgium]] and southern [[Netherlands]]. Later invasions conquered and established a lasting [[kingdom]] in an area which eventually covered most of modern-day [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and the western regions of [[Germany]]. When the pagan Frankish king [[Clovis I|Clovis]] became Christian in the late 5th century that was an important event in the history of Europe. 
 
 Modern scholars of the period of the [[Migration Period|migration]]s are in agreement that the Frankish confederacy emerged  at the beginning of the third century. A region in the northeast of the modern-day [[Netherlands]] – north of the erstwhile Roman border – still bears the name [[Salland]], and may have received that name from the Salians, who formed the core of the Frankish sea raiders. 
 
 == Frankish Empire== 
 
 From their heartland, the Franks gradually conquered most of Roman [[Gaul]] north of the [[Loire]] valley and east of [[Visigoth]]ic [[Aquitaine]]. At first they helped defend the border as allies; for example, when a major invasion of mostly East Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in 406, the Franks fought against these invaders. In the region of [[Paris]], Roman control persisted until 486, a decade after the fall of the emperors of [[Ravenna]], in part due to alliances with the Franks. 
 
 ===  Merovingians === 
 
 In 451, [[Aëtius]] called upon his Germanic allies on Roman soil to help fight off an invasion by [[Attila the Hun]]. The Salian Franks answered the call; the Ripuarian Franks fought on both sides as some of them lived outside the Empire. The Merovingians had [[Mayor of the Palace|governors]] who lead the Franks to war and had many governing responsibilities. 
 
 === Carolingians === 
 
 The Carolingian kingship begins with the deposition of the last Merovingian king, and the [[accession]] in 751 of [[Pippin III|Pippin the Short]], father of [[Charlemagne]]. 
 
 Pippin reigned as an elected king. While in later France the kingdom became hereditary, the kings of the later [[Holy Roman Empire]] proved unable to abolish the [[Prince-elector|elective tradition]] and continued as elected rulers until the Empire's formal end in 1806. 
 
 In 768 [[Charlemagne]] (Charles the Great), a powerful, intelligent, and modestly literate figure who became a legend for the later history of both France and Germany. Charles restored an equal balance between emperor and pope. 
 
 From 772 onwards, Charles conquered and eventually defeated the [[Saxons]] to incorporate their realm into the Frankish kingdom.  
 Then (773–774), he conquered the [[Lombards]] and thus could include northern Italy in his sphere of influence. He renewed the Vatican donation and the promise to the [[papacy]] of continued Frankish protection. 
 
 Charles created a realm that reached from the [[Pyrenees]] in the southwest (actually, including an area in Northern Spain (''[[Marca Hispanica]]'') after 795) over almost all of today's France (except [[Brittany]], which the Franks never conquered) eastwards to most of today's Germany, including northern [[Italy]] and today's [[Austria]].  
 On Christmas Day, 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charles as  " [[Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]] "  in [[Rome]]. Though Charles preferred the title  " Emperor, king of the Franks and Lombards " , as he did not want to get in conflict with the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Frankish Empire became the successor of the (Western) [[Roman Empire]]. Charles died on [[January 28]], [[814]] in [[Aachen]], where was buried. 
 
 [[Image:Western Empire-Europe870.JPG|frame|Charles' kingdom survived its founder and covered much of Western Europe from 795 until 843 when a treaty split it amongst his grandsons: Central Franks ruled by [[Lothair I]] (green), East Franks ruled by [[Louis the German]] (yellow), and [[Charles the Bald]] led West Franks (purple).]] 
 
 Charles had several sons, but only one survived him. This son, [[Louis the Pious]], followed his father as the ruler of a united Empire. When Louis died in 840, the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843 divided the Empire in three: 
 
 # Louis' eldest surviving son [[Lothair I]] became Emperor and ruler of the Central Franks. His three sons in turn divided this kingdom between them into [[Lotharingia]], [[Burgundy]] and (Northern) [[Italy]]. These areas would later vanish as separate kingdoms. 
 # Louis' second son, [[Louis the German]], became King of the East Franks. This area formed the kernel of the later [[Holy Roman Empire]], the cradle of [[Germany]]. 
 # His third son [[Charles the Bald]] became King of the West Franks; this area became the foundation for the later [[France]].
