 '''Hummingbirds''' are small [[bird]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Trochilidae'''. 
 
 They are among the smallest of birds: most [[species]] measure 7.5–13 & nbsp;cm (3–5 & nbsp;in). The smallest living bird species is the 2–5 & nbsp;cm [[bee hummingbird]]. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their [[wing]]s 12–80 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. < ref > Ridgely, Robert S. and Paul G. Greenfield. 2001.

 == Eating habits and pollination == 
 Hummingbirds help flowers to pollinate, though many other insects also do so. The hummingbird depends absolutely on the nectar, more so that any other bird. 
 
 Hummingbirds do not have a good sense of [[Olfaction|smell]]; instead, they are [[wikt:attract|attracted]] to [[color]], especially the [[color]] [[red]]. Unlike the butterfly, the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it, like a [[moth]]. When it does so, it flaps its [[wing]]s very quickly to stay in one place, which makes it look like a blur and also beats so fast it makes a humming sound. A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly. When it takes its head back out, its head is covered with [[yellow]] [[pollen]], so that when it moves to another [[flower]], it can pollinate.  
 
 Like bees, hummingbirds can assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat. They reject flowers whose nectar has less than 10% sugar. Nectar is a poor source of [[nutrients]], so hummingbirds meet their needs for [[protein]], [[amino acids]], [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], etc. by preying on [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. < ref > [http://www.allaboutbirds.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=2031 Not all sweetness and light] < /ref > 
 
 === Feeding apparatus === 
 Most hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight or nearly so, but in some species the bill shape is adapted for specialized feeding. [[Thornbill]]s have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short [[corolla]]s and piercing the bases of longer ones. The sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollas of flowers in the family [[Gesneriaceae]]. The bill of the fiery-tailed awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the [[Avocet]]s. The male tooth-billed hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill. 
 
 The two halves of a hummingbird's bill have a pronounced overlap, with the lower half ([[mandible]]) fitting tightly inside the upper half ([[maxilla]]). When hummingbirds feed on nectar, the bill is usually only opened slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out into the nectar. 
 
 Like the similar nectar-feeding [[sunbird]]s and unlike other birds, hummingbirds drink by using grooved or trough-like tongues which they can stick out a long way. < ref name=cade1 > Cade, Tom J. and Lewis I. Greenwald.

 Hummingbirds do not spend all day flying, as the energy cost would be prohibitive; much of their activity consists of sitting or perching. Hummingbirds feed in many small meals, consuming many small invertebrates and up to twelve times their own body weight in nectar each day. They spend an average of 10–15% of their time feeding and 75–80% sitting and digesting. 
 
 ===Co-evolution with flowers===

 Since hummingbirds are specialized nectar-eaters, they are tied to the flowers they feed upon. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Stiles |first=Gary |title=Geographical aspects of bird flower coevolution, with particular reference to Central America |jstor=2398801 |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=68 |issue= 2|pages=323–351 |year=1981 |doi=10.2307/2398801 |s2cid=87692272 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/38387 }} < /ref >  Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the sword-billed hummingbird and the sicklebills, are [[co-evolution|co-evolved]] with a small number of flower species. 
 
 Many plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], and bright [[pink]], though the birds will take nectar from flowers of many colors. Hummingbirds can see [[wavelength]]s into the near-[[ultraviolet]]. However, their flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. The narrow color [[spectrum]] may make hummingbird-pollinated flowers inconspicuous to insects, thereby reducing [[nectar robbing]] by insects. < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Rodríguez-Gironés |first1=M.A. |last2=Santamaría |first2=L. |year=2004 |title=Why are so many bird flowers red? |journal=PLOS Biol |pmid=15486585 |volume=2 |issue=10 |pmc=521733 |pages=e350 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020350 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Altschuler |first=D.

 Hummingbird-pollinated flowers produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing high concentrations of [[sucrose]], whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by [[fructose]] and [[glucose]]. < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Nicolson |first1=S.W. |name-list-style=amp |first2=P.

 == Taxonomy == 
 Hummingbirds have traditionally been a part of the [[bird]] [[order (biology)|order]] Apodiformes. This order includes the hummingbirds, the [[swift]]s and the [[tree swift]]s. The [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy of birds]], based on [[DNA]] studies done in the 1970s and 1980s, changed the classification of hummingbirds. Instead of being in the same order as the swifts, the hummingbirds were made an order, the Trochiliformes. Their previous order, Apodiformes was changed to the [[superorder]] Apodimorphae. This superorder contains the three families of birds which were in it when it was an order.
