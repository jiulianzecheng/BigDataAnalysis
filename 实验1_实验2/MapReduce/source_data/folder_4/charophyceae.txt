 The '''Charophyceae''' are the [[green algae]] closest to plants. 
 
 Their exact rank is the matter of some debate. Some [[botany|botanists]] recommend expanding the existing [[Plantae|plant kingdom]] to include charophyceans and [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]]. < ref name =  " Campbell " > Campbell N.A.  &  Reece J.B.  2005.  ''Biology''. 7th ed, Cummings, San Francisco. < /ref > 
 
 Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division '''Charophyta''', with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division. < ref name =  " AlgaeBase " > Guiry M.D.  &  Guiry G.M. 2007. AlgaeBase.

 The consensus among [[botanist]]s is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land [[plants]] ([[Embryophyta|embryophytes]]). < ref name =  " Campbell " / > < ref name =  " Delwiche " > Delwiche C.F.

 Many of the complex plant [[Trait (biology)|traits]] related to [[sexual reproduction]] evolved first in charophyceans.{{cn}} Analysis of cpDNA ([[chloroplast]] [[DNA]]) shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts also evolved first in the charophyceans, before the [[Zygnematales]] diverged from the lineage that lead to [[Coleochaetales]], [[Charales]], and the land plants. < ref name =  " Campbell " / > < ref name =  " Laval " > Turmel M; Otis C.  &  Lemieux C.  2005. [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/22 The complete chloroplast DNA sequences of the Charophycean green algae ''Staurastrum'' and ''Zygnema'' reveal that the chloroplast genome underwent extensive changes during the evolution of the Zygnematales].

 Groups generally included within the Charophyceae are: 
 *[[Mesostigmatales]] 
 *[[Klebsormidiales]] 
 *[[Zygnematales]] 
 *[[Desmidiales]] 
 *[[Charales]] 
 *[[Coleochaetales]]
