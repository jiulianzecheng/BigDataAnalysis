 The '''Punisher''' (''' < nowiki/ > 'Francis  "  Frank  "  Castle, born Castiglione''') is a fictional character. He appears in American comic books published by the [[Marvel Comics]]. 
 
 The Punisher (whose real name is Frank Castle) is a [[vigilante]] who uses unorthodox methods like [[murder]], [[torture]], and [[kidnapping]] in his crusade against crime. His family was murdered in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]] after witnessing a [[mafia]] assassination. Frank Castle then turned into the  " Punisher " , a man who vowed to kill criminals, [[terrorist]]s and [[gangster]]s of all kinds. Castle also wears a [[kevlar]] costume with the peculiar design of a [[Skull|human skull]] in his chest, of which, according to Castle himself, acts both as a distraction and a tool of intimidation, as it would draw the attention of criminals in that direction, and instead of aiming at his head, they would shoot his costume, which he wore with a rather solid armor beneath. In addition, his skull symbol has psychologically affected many of the criminals he faced off.
