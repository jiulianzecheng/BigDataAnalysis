 '''Beaumaris''' ({{lang-fr|beau marais}}, [[Literal translation]]: ''beautiful marsh'') is a small town on the island of [[Anglesey]] of the [[Menai Strait]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 The town itself began  in 1295 when [[Edward I of England]] started to build [[Beaumaris Castle]]. This was one of several castle along  the North Wales coast  - others include [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]], [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] and [[Harlech Castle|Harlech]] . Many of the builders of the castle were from [[France]]. 
 
 The castle was built on a [[marsh]] by the village of [[Llanfaes]]. The French builders called the marsh ''beaux marais'' which means  " beautiful marsh " . This is how the town got its name.  The people who lived village in [[Llanfaes]] were removed  to a new village in the west of Anglesey to make way for the castle. This village was called [[Newborough]] and it still exists today.
