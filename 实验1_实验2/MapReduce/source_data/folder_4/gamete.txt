A '''gamete''' < ref > (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''γαμετης''; translated ''gamete'' = wife, ''gametes'' = husband) < /ref >  is a specialized sex cell that [[fusion|fuses]] with another gamete during [[fertilization]] (conception) in [[organism]]s that [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]]. Gametes are [[haploid]]—they have only one copy of each [[chromosome]]. All other cells in an animal are [[diploid]]—they have two copies of each chromosome. Gametes are produced by '''germ cells'''. 
 
 In species which produce two [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type, a [[female]] is any individual which produces the larger type of gamete—called an [[ovum]] (or egg)—and a [[male]] produces the smaller type—called a [[spermatozoon]] (or sperm cell). 
 
 The name gamete was introduced by the [[Austria]]n biologist [[Gregor Mendel]]. 
 
 ==Gametogenesis== 
 '''Gametogenesis''' is the development of [[diploid]] germ cells into [[haploid]] eggs or sperm, (respectively [[oogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]]). It is different for each [[species]] but the general stages are similar. The development of eggs (oogenesis) and sperm (spermatogenesis) have many features in common. They both involve: 
 * [[Meiosis]] 
 * Extensive [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] [[cell differentiation]] 
 * Unable to survive for very long if fertilization does not occur 
 
 They also have major differences, especially 
 * Different timing of maturation: oogenic meiosis is interrupted at one or more stages (for a long time) while spermatogenic meiosis is rapid and uninterrupted.
