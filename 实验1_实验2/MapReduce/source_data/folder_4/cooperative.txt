A '''cooperative''' (also spelled '''co-operative,''' or '''co-op''') is when several people come together in [[cooperation]] to reach a common goal through [[mutualism|mutural aid]]. It is a type of [[organization]] used to make the lives of its members easier; it is usually not focused on making [[profit]], instead focusing on serving member needs. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 Cooperative [[ownership]] can have different details about what ownership means and how cooperation works. A basic cooperative-ownership structure has the following characteristics:  
 
 * Ownership is based on voluntary participation 
 * Members of the cooperative are also users (also known as patrons) 
 * Decisions are made on a basis of one member = one vote 
 
 Co-operatives are [[democratic]] organizations owned by the people who use them. Cooperative organizations help people adapt to [[capitalism]].    
 
 == History and examples == 
 The first cooperative was a store in [[Rochdale]], England started in 1844.  The people who started it wanted food that was cheaper and better quality.  Since then, people have found many ways to cooperate.   
 
 Examples of cooperatives: 
 
 * Farmers provide their own transport and marketing to get better prices for their crops 
 * Poor people protect themselves from money-lenders, and workers save for their retirement (as in a [[credit union]]) 
 * Fishers package their fish to get a better price 
 * Villagers provide themselves with electricity or water 
 * Residents own their [[apartment]] building 
 
 The International Cooperative Alliance was started in 1885.  It reports that there are 800 million cooperative members in the world.
