A '''courante''' ({{lang-it|corrente}}) is a [[dance]] that was popular in [[Baroque music]] in the [[17th century|17th]] and early [[18th century|18th centuries]].  The word comes from the [[French language|French]] word for to  " run " . 
 
 The courante was a fast, running dance with 3 beats in a [[bar (music)|bar]] (the [[time signature]] was often 3/2, although sometimes it was 3/4).  During the [[17th century]] the French courante started to become slower than the [[Italy|Italian]] corrente, and it often had more [[counterpoint]] (imitating parts).  However, this was not a strict rule, and the courantes that [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] wrote were both Italian and French in style, and sometimes he called them  " courante "  and sometimes  " corrente " . 
 
 Composers of the Baroque period often composed a group of several dances.  This was called a [[suite (music)|suite]].  There was usually an [[allemande]], then the courante was the second dance, followed by a [[sarabande]] and a [[gigue]] and sometimes one or two other dances or as well.
