[[File:MAXIMATOR-High-Pressure-Manometer-01a.jpg|thumb|Pressure [[gauge]]s (or manometers) are often similar to this one]] 
 A '''manometer''' is a [[wikt:device|device]] that is able to measure the [[pressure]] of a medium (a [[liquid]], or a [[gas]]), it is also used to check the pressure of cylinder but it can only check the inner pressure not outer. In most cases, the relative pressure will be measured. A [[barometer]] can measure the absolute pressure, compared to a [[vacuum]].A common simple manometer consists of a U-shaped glass tube filled with a liquid. It is a simple pressure gauge and it's measure difference in pressure exerted at the two ends of the glass tube. The name ( " manometer " ) comes from [[Ancient Greek]], μανός manós  -thin and μέτρον métron measurement, or ruler. Many [[animal]]s have a [[tympanic membrane]] (or eardrum), which only reacts to changes in pressure similar to a manometer.
