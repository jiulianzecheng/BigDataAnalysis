 The '''cytoskeleton''' is a kind of [[scaffold]]ing present in all cells. It is made of [[protein]]. 
 
 It keeps cell shape, protects the cell and enables cells to move (using structures such as [[flagellum|flagella]] and [[cilium|cilia]]). It helps transport inside the [[cytoplasm]] (the movement of [[vesicle]]s and [[organelle]]s, for example), and in [[cell division]]. The concept and the term (''cytosquelette'', in French) was introduced by French embryologist Paul Wintrebert in 1931. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Frixione E |title=Recurring views on the structure and function of the cytoskeleton: a 300-year epic |journal=Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton |volume=46 |issue= 2|pages=73–94 |year=2000 |pmid=10891854 |doi=10.1002/1097-0169(200006)46:2 < 73::AID-CM1 > 3.0.CO;2-0}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Eukaryote]] cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments, which are ''microfilaments'' ([[actin]] filaments), ''intermediate filaments'', and ''microtubules''. They give the cell structure and shape. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Minton AP |title=Confinement as a determinant of macromolecular structure and reactivity |journal=Biophys.
