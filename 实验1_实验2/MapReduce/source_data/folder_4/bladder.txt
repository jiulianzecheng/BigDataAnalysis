 The '''urinary bladder''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] in the [[human]] [[body]] in charge of storing urine. It is part of our urinary system. All the [[liquid]]s that are drunk go through the bladder. The bladder takes in the liquid in order for the body to work. The bladder works with the [[kidney]]s. The [[kidney]]s clean the liquid we drink. This goes on until the bladder is too full to hold anymore. At this point, it is roughly the size of a softball. The bladder then tells the [[brain]] that it needs to be emptied. Once this message is received by the brain, the [[muscle]]s around the bladder starts to squeeze and the bladder starts to [[contract]]. At the same time, the bladder sends a message to the sphincters to relax and let the liquid pass and pass through to the [[urethra]].
