 A '''trench''' is a long, narrow [[ditch]]. 
 
 [[Trench warfare]] has often been used in defense. Entrenched soldiers can be somewhat safe from enemy fire.  Trench warfare made [[World War I]] longer than expected.  The [[trench coat]] got its name from there. 
 
 Several kinds of trench exist: 
 * ''Utility trench'' has pipes, wires, or other [[infrastructure]] 
 * ''Road trench'' carries [[vehicles]] 
 * ''Military trench'' provides shelter for [[soldier]]s shooting at each other 
 * ''[[Oceanic trench]]'': For example, the [[Mariana Trench]] 
 *''[[Rift valley]]'' 
 *  ''Archaeological trench'' dug by [[archaeologist]]s
