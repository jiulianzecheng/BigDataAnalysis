 '''''Aureus''''' (plural: '''''aurei''''') was a type of [[gold coin]] in [[ancient Rome]]. It had the same value as 25 [[denarii]] silver coins. An aureus was the same size as a denarius, but it weighed more because [[gold]] is more [[Density|dense]]. 
 
 The aureus coin was first used in 1st century BC. It stopped being used in the 4th century AD. It was replaced by the [[solidus]].
