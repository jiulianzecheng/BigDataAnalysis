 In biology, '''[[offspring]]''' are the young creation of [[Organism|living organisms]]. They may be produced by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms.  
 
 Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny'''. In a more general way, 'brood' implies a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. Progeny is a more general word.
