 The '''kilogram'''{{efn|Also known as kilogramme, kg or kilo.}} is the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[mass]] in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). It is widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[commerce]] worldwide. The kilogram is exactly the mass of one [[litre]] of water. 
 
 As of May 20, 2019, the definition of the kilogram is based on the [[Planck constant]] as {{val|6.62607015|e=−34|u=kg⋅m < sup > 2 < /sup > ⋅s < sup > −1 < /sup > }}. < ref name=draft-resolution-A > {{citation

 There are attempts to define the kilogram in other ways. One example specifies a number of [[atom]]s of a certain substance (at a certain temperature). 
 
 One kilogram is a little more than 2.2 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]. One [[tonne]] is one thousand kilograms. One [[litre]] of [[water]] weighs almost exactly one kilogram, at {{cvt|3.98|C|F K}}, at [[sea level]]. This was the basis of the definition of the [[gram]] in 1795. 
 
 == History == 
 In 1879, the piece of metal was made. It was officially chosen to be the kilogram in 1889. It was made of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. < ref name= " Practical realization " > {{cite web | publisher = BIMP | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/mass.html | title = Practical realization of the definition of the kilogram | access-date = 2010-03-04 | archive-date = 2011-01-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110110123409/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/mass.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Those metals were chosen because they do not [[rust]] or [[corrosion|corrode]] like most metals. It is stored in a vault at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]] in [[Sèvres]], France. From 1795 to 1799, the unit of mass was not called  " kilogram "  but was called  " [[grave (mass)|grave]] " . 
 
 The original kilogram is kept inside bell jars. Over time, dust can collect on it. Before it is measured, it is cleaned to get the original size. < ref name= " Practical realization " / > 
 
 == Mass and weight == 
 {{main|Mass versus weight}} 
 [[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The chains on the swing hold the child’s weight. If one were to stand behind her and try to stop her, one would be acting against her inertia. This inertia comes from her mass, not weight.]] 
 The kilogram is a unit of [[mass]]. In normal language, [[measurement|measuring]] mass defines how ''heavy'' is something. This is not scientifically correct. Mass is an ''[[inertia]]l property''. It measures the tendency of an object to stay at a given speed when no [[Force (physics)|force]] acts on it.  
 
 Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] contain an important formula: ''F'' = ''ma''. ''F'' is force. ''m'' is mass. ''a'' is [[acceleration]]. An object with a mass (''m'') of one kilogram will accelerate (''a'') at one [[Metre per second squared|meter per second per second]] when acted upon by a force (''F'') of one [[newton (unit)|newton]]. This about one-tenth the acceleration due to [[Earth's gravity|earth’s gravity]].{{efn|In professional [[metrology]] (the science of measurement), the acceleration of earth’s gravity is taken as [[standard gravity]] (symbol: ''g'' < sub > n < /sub > ). The acceleration is really {{val|9.80665}}{{nbsp}}[[metre per second squared|meters per square second]] (m/s < sup > 2 < /sup > ). The expression {{nowrap| " 1 m/s < sup > 2 < /sup >   " }} means that for every second that elapses, velocity changes an additional 1 & nbsp;m/s.}} 
 
 The [[weight]] of matter depends on the strength of gravity. The mass of matter does not. The mass of an object is the same everywhere. Matter has invariant mass assuming it is not traveling at a [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic]] speed with respect to an observer. According to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein’s]] theory of [[special relativity]], the [[mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] (apparent mass with respect to an observer) of an object or particle with rest mass ''m'' < sub > 0 < /sub >  increases with its speed as ''M''{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}γ''m'' < sub > 0 < /sub >  (where γ is the [[Lorentz factor]]). This effect is vanishingly small at everyday speeds, which are by [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] less than the [[speed of light]], but becomes noticeable at very high speeds. For example, traveling at just 10% the speed of light with respect to an observer—exceedingly fast compared to everyday speeds (about {{convert|108|e6km/h|abbr=unit|disp=or}})—increases an object’s relativistic mass just over 0.5%. 
 
 As regards the kilogram, relativity’s effect upon the constancy of matter’s mass is simply an interesting scientific phenomenon that has zero effect on the definition of the kilogram and its practical realizations. Objects are  " weightless "  for astronauts in [[Micro-g environment|microgravity]]. However, the objects still have their mass and inertia. Astronaut must use ten times as much force to accelerate a ten-kilogram object at the same rate as a one-kilogram object. 
 
 A common swing, as shown in the picture, can show the relationship of force, mass and acceleration. Someone could push an adult on the swing. The adult would accelerate slowly. They would only swing a short distance forward before the swing would change direction. If a child is sitting on the swing, then the child would swing forward faster and further.
