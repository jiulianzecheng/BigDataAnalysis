 Measurement means compare to a fix standard value. To '''measure''' something is to give a number to some property of the thing. Measuring something puts the [[amount]] of the thing into [[number]]s. Measurement can be written using many different units. For example, if we want to compare two different sized container for holding a given quantity of liquid, we can ask: Are both containers the same size? Will they hold the same amount of liquid? 
 
 == What can be measured? == 
 Many things can be measured. Some properties of things that can be measured: 
 * '''[[Distance]]''': For example, distance measurements can be used to answer the following questions; 
 ** How far is the [[city]] from here? 
 ** How far apart are these two [[trees]]? 
 ** How long is this [[stick]]? 
 * '''[[Weight]]''': For example, weight measurements can be used to answer the following questions; 
 ** What is heavier, this group of [[apple]]s or that group of [[banana]]s? 
 ** Did John lose weight in the last year? 
 ** Will putting this rock in the [[boat]] make the boat [[wikt:sink|sink]]? 
 * '''[[Temperature]]''': For example, temperature measurements can be used to answer the following questions; 
 ** Where is hotter today? In London or in Paris? 
 ** Will this ice turn into water if I put it inside? 
 ** Is Sally [[Illness|sick]]? Does Sally have a [[fever]]? 
 * '''[[Volume]]''': For example, volume measurements can be used to answer the following questions; 
 ** How many pails of water do I need to fill up the bath tub? 
 ** How much [[Olive (fruit)|olive]] [[oil]] do I put in this food I am making? 
 ** How many blocks can I fit in this box? 
 * '''[[Pressure]]''': For example, pressure measurements can be used to answer the following questions; 
 ** How much air should I put in this [[automobile]] [[tire]]? 
 ** Will the weather stay good or will we have a storm? 
 ** Will my ears pop when I climb that hill? 
 
 One can measure many other things. 
 
 == Units of measurement == 
 {{main|Unit of measurement}} 
 Most [[Property#Characteristics|properties]] are measured using a [[number]] and a [[unit of measurement]]. The unit of measurement is a [[standard]] amount. The number compares the property to the standard amount. 
 
 == Measure theory == 
 There is an [[advanced]] part of [[mathematics]] that is about measuring things with unusual [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s. This is called measure [[theory]]. 
 
 Measurement can be the capacity, how long something is, or distance, etc.
