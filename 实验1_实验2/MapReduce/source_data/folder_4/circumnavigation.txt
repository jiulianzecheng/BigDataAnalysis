 '''Circumnavigation''' originally meant going around something, by [[ship]]. Usually, it means people going around the [[earth|world]]. The first known circumnavigation was done by [[Ferdinand Magellan|Fernão de Magalhães]] (Ferdinand Magellan), from 1519 to 1522. Magellan took five ships and went west, from [[Spain]]. He discovered a [[waterway]] which is now named after him, the [[Strait of Magellan]]. Magellan died in a fight with natives on the [[Philippines|Philippine island]] [[Mactan]] in April 1521. The voyage was completed under command of [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]]. Elcano returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], where the voyage had started, with 18 survivors and valuable cargo in 1522. This proved that the earth was a [[globe]].
