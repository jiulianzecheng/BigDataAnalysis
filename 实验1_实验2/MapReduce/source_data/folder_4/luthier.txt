A '''luthier''' is a person who repairs [[guitar]]s, [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es, and other wooden stringed instruments. These instruments need regular adjustments and minor repairs, especially straightening the bridge. As well, sometimes instruments are damaged in accidents, and a luthier has to use wood glue, broken pieces, and clamps to repair the instrument. Luthiers also have the ability to create wooden stringed instruments, mostly classic string family instruments. 
 
 The French word '''lutherie''' is referred to the art to build wooden instruments. The word luthier comes from the French word '''luth''', luth comes from the Arabian word '''al-`ūd''' (العود), this last word means [[lute]], although its generic meaning is '''the wood'''. The German word for luthier is '''luther''', that word has became also in a name ([[Martin Luther King]]) and in a last name ([[Martin Luther]])
