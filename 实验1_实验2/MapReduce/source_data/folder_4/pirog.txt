 '''Pyrih'''  (the plural is ''pyrohy'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[pie]] that can have either a sweet or savory filling. In [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] it is called '''pirog''' (plural is ''pirogi''). 
 
 == Pastry == 
 Pyrih (pirog) is usually made from [[yeast]]-raised [[dough]], but can also be made from [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] or [[puff pastry]]. Pyrohy or pirogi are full-sized pies, while [[Pirozhki|pyrizhky]] or pirozhki are smaller-sized pies that can be eaten with one hand. 
 
 The standard shape for pyrohy is [[oblong]] with [[taper]]ing ends, but [[rectangle|rectangular]] or [[circle|circular]] pyrohy are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no [[wikt:crust|crust]] on top (like a [[tart]]). 
 
 == Filling == 
 The filling for pyrohy may be sweet and contain [[cottage cheese]], or fruits like [[apple]], [[plums]] or various [[berry|berries]]. Savory versions may consist of [[meat]], [[fish]], [[mushroom]]s, [[cabbage]], [[buckwheat]] [[groat]]s or [[potato]]. In Ukrainian and Russian [[cuisine]]s, pyrohy with a savory filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) together with [[borscht]], or [[soup]].
