The '''calorie''' is a pre-SI unit of [[energy]], most common in [[heat]]. 
 
 It is the amount of energy required to increase the [[temperature]] of one [[gram]] of water by one [[Kelvin]]. 
 
 When on a food label, the term  " Calorie "  refers to '''kilocalories''', or 1000 calories. In this case, the word  " Calorie "  is usually written with a capital C. 
 
 For a layman, calories are the parameters of energy consumption. Think of them like the gasoline in the car. But unlike the car, the body stores the excess gas for long. The reaction to the calorie depends on which [[macronutrient]] did that calorie came from. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Pareek|first=Rahul C.|date=2 July 2020|title=Understanding the basics of calories|url=https://thecalorieconscious.com/how-to-lose-weight-290-pounds-lbs/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-11|website=The Calorie Concious|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > [https://www.azbukadiet.ru/sutochnaya-norma-kalorij-05-02-2023 How many calories does a person need per day?] < /ref >
