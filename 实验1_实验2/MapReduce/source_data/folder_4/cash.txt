 [[File:American Cash.JPG|thumb|Money in Cash.]] '''Cash''' is a form of [[currency]], such as [[banknote]]s or [[coin]]s. There is usually different sorts in every [[country]]. 
 
 == Bookkeeping and finance == 
 In [[bookkeeping]] and [[finance]], ''cash'' can also refer to [[Check (finance)|checks]], [[money order]]s, [[cashier's check]]s, [[bank draft]]s, or [[travelers cheque|traveler's checks]]. In all these forms, the term indicates the most [[Market liquidity|liquid]] form of [[asset]]s, which have a fixed value and can be easily converted to currency:  " ready money " .  For example, [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]] paid as  " cash "  (as opposed to, e.g., [[stock]] options) would in most countries normally be paid with checks or direct bank deposits, which are trivially convertible to currency.
