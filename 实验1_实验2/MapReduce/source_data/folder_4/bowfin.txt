 The '''bowfin''' (''Amia calva'') is a primitive [[bony fish]] in the genus ''[[Amia (fish)|Amia]]'' that lives in [[North America]]. It is a relict species, last of a group known as the [[Halecomorphi]]. That group appeared the [[Lower Triassic]], about 250 million years ago.  
 
 The bowfin is described as  " primitive "  because they have  characteristics of their early ancestors. The closest living relatives of bowfins are [[gar]]s: the two groups make up the [[clade]] [[Holostei]]. 
 
 Their physiology is quite interesting. Like [[gar]]s, bowfin are ''bimodal breathers'': they can to breathe both water and air. Their gills exchange gases in the water, and they also have a gas bladder. The gas bladder is the secret: it keeps [[buoyancy]], and lets the fish  breathe air by a small pneumatic duct which goes from the foregut to the gas bladder. They  break the surface to gulp air. This lets them survive conditions of [[hypoxia]] which would be lethal to most species. < ref name= " Warren " > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUrcAwAAQBAJ & pg=PA288 | title=Freshwater Fish of North America | publisher=JHU Press | work=Volume 1: Petromyzontidae to Catostomidae | date=July 2014 |author1=Melvin L.

 == Bowfin body-shape evolution and development == 
 The first fish lacked jaws and used negative pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin is a result of their evolutionary need to be able to catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several adaptations. 
 
 == Similar species == 
 Some people mistake northern snakeheads (''Channa argus'') for bowfin because even if they are in a different genus, they have similarities to them in appearance, most noticeably their elongated, cylindrical shape, and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs.

 [[File:Amia calva (white background).jpg|thumb|Bowfin (''Amia calva'')]] 
 A common parasite of bowfin is the anchor worm from the genus ''[[Lernaea]]''. These crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. 
 
 == Feeding == 
 Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that move into the shallows at night to prey on fish, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects.
