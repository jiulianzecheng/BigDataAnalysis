 The '''Trabant''' (or ''Trabi'') was a series of [[car]]s built in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. When the first cars were released, people saw them as being [[innovation|innovative]]. The cars were also easy on [[fuel]], they did not need much fuel. Trabant had a [[two-stroke]] engine. The outside of the Trabant was not made with steel or [[iron]], because the German Democratic Republic did not want to [[import]] steel and iron for the cars, because that would have been too expensive. Instead, the Trabant was made of [[Duroplast]], a special kind of [[plastic]], made by mixing [[formica]] and [[bakelite]], and made stronger with fibres of [[cotton]]. They could afford some steel from Russia, and this was used for the engine and the floor, and to give the plastic strength. After the [[Berlin Wall]] was opened the Trabant did not sell as much as before, because the people wanted bigger cars that they could get after the wall was opened. Trabants can still be found in East Europe, for example in [[Hungary]]. 
 
 == Criticism == 
 The Trabant was a small [[car]], good for driving in the city. The two-stroke [[engine]] created lots of air [[pollution]], but because of the plastic body, it was stronger and safer than western cars of the same time. It was famous for being better in a crash test than a VW Polo.
