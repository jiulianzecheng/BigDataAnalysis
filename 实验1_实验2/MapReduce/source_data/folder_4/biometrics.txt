 '''Biometrics''' is a field of study which identifies or recognises people by the [[Trait (biology)|traits]] they have. Not to be confused with [[biometry]], the application of statistics to biology. 
 
 Given those traits, a system can be [[training|trained]] to recognise certain people, with a certain [[probability]]. Training lowers the probability of falsely identifying someone. < ref > {{Cite web|title=New trends and advantages of biometrics|url=https://worldvision.com.ua/novye-tendentsii-i-preimushchestva-biometrii/|access-date=|website=|language=}} < /ref >   
 
 The traits used are of two types: 
 *Based on the body ([[physiology|physiological]] traits). These include [[fingerprint]]s, [[face]] [[recognition]], [[scent]], voice recognition, [[iris (eye)]], or [[retina]] recognition. 
 *Based on the behaviour of a person. 
 
 Most often, the two types are combined, as in [[voice recognition|voice]] or signature recognition. Most of these biometrics are seen as  " behavioral " , but some are linked to the physiology, e.g. of the vocal tract, or of the hand.  
 
 A person  may be identified by a [[fingerprint]], or by letting the person [[signature|sign]] a [[wikt:document|document]].  The data could then be kept.  Someone who is checking can again take the fingerprint or the signature, and compare it to the old version. 
 
 When selecting features, those choosing must also look at social acceptance. Taking a fingerprint may be ok, taking a [[blood test]] may not be. Some biometric data is also easier to fake, e.g. [[signature]]s. 
 
 Also, when [[voice]] samples are taken, they may be distorted, if only a [[telephone|telephone line]] is available. Telephone lines cut off some [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] from the [[signal]]. 
 
 Other than for [[Passport|passports]], biometric methods are also used in many banks.
