[[File:Scissors.jpg|right|frame|'''Scissors''' are used for [[sewing]], in the [[kitchen]], and for [[paper]].]] 
 '''Scissors''' are a [[tool]] used for [[cut]]ting thin material like: 
 * [[paper]]

 * [[metal]] foil 
 * thin [[plastic]]

 Knives are better than scissors for some uses. Unlike a [[knife]], scissors have two sharp edges. 
 Some types of scissors, like [[children]]'s scissors, are not very sharp. [[Children]]'s scissors are often protected with [[plastic]]. These are called  " Safety Scissors " . 
 
 Scissors can be made for [[left-handed]] or [[right-handed]] people. Using scissors made for the wrong [[hand]] is very hard for most people.  
 
 There are many kinds of scissors used for cutting different [[material]]s and shapes.
