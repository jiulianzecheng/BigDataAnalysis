 Modern-day Odisha falls under the boundaries of the ancient kingdom of Kalinga in the 3rd Century BCE, and the state is still sometimes referred to as Kalinga. Odisha is also known as Utkal, and is mentioned in the Indian National Anthem, [[Jana Gana Mana]], under this name. The Orissa province was founded on the 1st April 1936, and the anniversary of this is celebrated as ''Utkal Dibas'' throughout the state. The state was created on the basis of the Odia language, encompassing the native speakers of the language. 
 
 Popular tourist destinations in Odisha include the Konark Sun Temple, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, the Puri Jagannath Temple, and Chilika Lake.

Odisha has successfully hosted several sports events as Asian Junior Women's Rugby Tournament, the 22nd Asian Athletics Championship, and the Men's Hockey World Cup in 2018. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Odisha aspiration to be India's sports hub crystallises|url=https://www.statesman.com}} < /ref >
