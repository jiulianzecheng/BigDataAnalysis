 A '''map''' is an image of an area, usually of the [[Earth]] or part of the [[Earth]]. A map is different from an aerial [[photograph]] because it includes [[interpretation]]. Many maps are called  " charts "  such as [[star chart]]s and [[nautical chart]]s. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on [[paper]]. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used. 
 
 The word  " map "  can also be used to talk about a [[chart]] or [[drawing]] that shows [[relationship]]s between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why [[World Wide Web|web]] developers call a list of [[web page]]s on a [[web site]] a site map.

 People who make maps are [[cartography|cartographers]]. 
 
 Many maps today are made using [[GIS]] computer systems. These are [[database]] systems that are organized by location instead of named records.  
 
 If a map is on a piece of paper or a [[computer]] screen, it has to be projected.  This is because the [[Earth]] is round and paper and screens are flat.  There are a lot of ways that use [[mathematics]] to make [[map projection]]s.  The only kind of map of the [[Earth]] that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere.  This is called a [[globe]].
