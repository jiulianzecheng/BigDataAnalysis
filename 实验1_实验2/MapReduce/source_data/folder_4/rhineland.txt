It borders [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] to the west and the Rhine to the east. 
 
 After the French were defeated in the early 19th century, the German - and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking areas in the middle and the lower Rhine were added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and were called the '''Rhine Province''' (or '''Rhenish Prussia''').  
 
 After [[World War I]], the western part of Rhineland was under Allied control and [[demilitarized zone|demilitarized]], with no military activities allowed, under the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. German forces sent armies back to it in 1936, three years before [[World War II]] began.
