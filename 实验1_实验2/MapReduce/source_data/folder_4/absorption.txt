'''Absorption''' is when something takes in another substance. It is a physical or chemical [[phenomenon]] or  [[process]]. < ref > Such as [[diffusion]], for example. < /ref >  [[Atom]]s, [[molecules]], or [[ion]]s enter in the inner part (called  " bulk " ) of a [[gas]], [[liquid]], or [[solid]] material.  
 
 This is different from [[adsorption]]. Molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the [[volume]] of the material, instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the [[surface]] of the material. A more general term is ''[[sorption]]'', which covers absorption, [[adsorption]], and [[ion]] exchange. 
 
 Other meanings of  " absorption "  are: 
 * [[Biology]]: entry of substances through the [[skin]] or other boundaries such as the [[intestine]] or [[cell membrane]]. 
 * [[Pharmacology]]: release of [[drug]]s into the [[blood]]. 
 * [[Physics]]: receiving of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by a material.
