'''Nepotism''' is when a person in authority gives jobs to their [[relative]]s. It comes from the practice of [[mediaeval]] [[Popes]], appointing their [[nephew]]s to important positions. < ref > Especially nephews because, as officially [[Celibacy|celibate]], Popes could not legitimately have sons. < /ref >  ''Nepote'' is [[Italian language|Italian]] for 'nephew'. < ref name= " BBC " > Ed Butler 2013.

 For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]]. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|title=Article Pope Alexander VI|work=New Catholic Dictionary|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01289a.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-12 }} < /ref >  Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become [[Pope Paul III]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Article Pope Paul III|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11579a.htm|accessdate=2007-07-12 }} < /ref >  Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s.  
 
 The practice was finally ended when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''Romanum decet Pontificem'', in 1692. < ref name= " Article Nepotism " > {{cite web|title=Article Nepotism|work=New Catholic Dictionary|url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm|accessdate=2007-07-12|archive-date=2007-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal. 
 
 In the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of [[wikt:merit|merit]], where the best person gets the job ([[meritocracy]]). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like [[Italy]] is that it damages the [[economy]] of the country, though that is difficult to prove. < ref name=BBC/ >
