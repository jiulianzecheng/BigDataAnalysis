 The '''ear''' is the part of the [[body]] which allows animals (including [[Human|people]]) to [[hear]]. People and most [[mammal]]s have ears. Non-mammals, such as lizards or frogs, can also hear, but may have holes instead of external ears. The ear works by directing sound waves to the [[inner ear]]. These [[vibration]]s are sent to the brain by an organized group of [[nerve]]s. This system is called the [[auditory system]]. (Auditory meaning relating to hearing and how we hear) 
 
 The inner ear is in most [[vertebrate]]s, but mammals have special adaptations for hearing which even other land vertebrates do not have. These include the external ear and the three little bones which transmit sounds to the brain (the [[ossicles]]). The part of the ear that sticks out and can be seen is called the ''pinna.'' 
 
 Ears are also used in other ways. [[African elephant]]s use their large ears to cool themselves when it is very hot. [[Bat]]s rely on their ears to find prey by [[echolocation]]. Some animals use their ears for [[signal (biology)|signalling]] to each other. 
 
 == Other hearing == 
 In ordinary language,  " ear "  refers to this [[sensory receptor|receptor]] which conducts sound and sends signals to the brain. It does not refer to the many other methods of [[hearing]] found in fish and [[invertebrate]]s. Many animals do not hear through ears.  [[Spider]]s have small [[hair]]s on their [[leg]]s that they can hear with.
