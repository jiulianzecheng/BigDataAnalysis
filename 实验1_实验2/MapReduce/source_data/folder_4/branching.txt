'''Branching''' is a term in [[linguistics]]. It refers to the way a [[phrase]] or [[sentence]] is made up. There is a '''head word''' and various other words to make the phrase or sentence. 
 
 ==Examples== 
 Most languages make phrases with a head word and dependents (modifiers). These examples show the phrase heads in bold.  
 
 Examples of left-branching phrases (= head-final phrases): 
 ::the '''house'''  < small > - Noun phrase (NP) < /small > 
 ::very '''happy'''  < small > - Adjective phrase (AP) < /small > 
 ::too '''slowly'''  < small > - Adverb phrase (AdvP) < br > < /small > 
 
 Examples of right-branching phrases (= head-initial phrases): 
 ::'''laugh''' loudly  < small > - Verb phrase (VP) < /small > 
 ::'''with''' luck  < small > - Prepositional phrase (PP) < /small > 
 ::'''that''' it happened  < small > - Subordinator phrase (SP = subordinate clause) < /small > 
 
 Example of phrases that contain both left- and right-branching (= head-medial phrases): 
 ::the '''house''' there  < small > - Noun phrase (NP) < /small > 
 ::very '''happy''' with it  < small > - Adjective phrase (AP) < /small > 
 ::only '''laugh''' loudly  < small > - Verb phrase (VP) < /small > 
 
 Most structures in English are, however, not completely left- or completely right-branching, but rather they combine both. The following trees show a combination of left- and right-branching in English:

 There are more right-branching structures than left-branching structures in English. This means that trees usually grow down to the right.
