 ==History== 
 Breads shaped like crescents have been around since the [[Medieval]] times. Before the croissant, there was a version of the croissant called a  " [[feteer meshaltet]] " . It came from Egypt. Many years later, a crescent-shaped version of [[feteer meshaltet]] was made. It was called  " feteer halali "  (crescent feteer). The feteer halali became popular throughout Europe, especially France. Later, feteer halali became known as a croissant. < ref name=Israa > {{cite news |last1=عبدالقادر |first1=اسراء |title=حكاية أكلة..
