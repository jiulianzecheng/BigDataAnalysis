 '''Magnoliids''' (or '''Magnoliidae''' or '''Magnolianae''') are a group of [[flowering plant]]s. < ref name= " palmer " > {{cite journal | title = The plant tree of life: an overview and some points of view | first1=Jeffrey D. |last1=Palmer |first2=Douglas E. |last2=Soltis  |first3=Mark W. |last3=Chase  | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1437–1445 (Fig.2) | doi = 10.3732/ajb.91.10.1437 | issue=10 | pmid=21652302| doi-access=free }} < /ref >  They are descendants of the earliest [[flowering plants]]: they keep some features which look like those of [[conifers]]. < ref > Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009.

 The group include [[magnolia]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[bay laurel]], [[cinnamon]], [[avocado]], [[black pepper]], [[tulip tree]] (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera|Lyriodendron]]'') and many others.  They  have three-part flowers, [[pollen]] with one pore, and usually branching-veined leaves.  
 
 The '''magnoliids''' are today more than 10,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s. They are successful despite being  " primitive "  in structure. 
 
 The group has many food crops (such as [[avocado]]s) and many with [[narcotic|psychotropic]] effects. The famous [[Polynesia]]n drink [[kava]] is prepared from a magnoliad, and [[nutmeg]] fruits are a source of the [[hallucinogen]] [[myristicin]]. Psychotropic effects are usually a [[defence against herbivory]].
