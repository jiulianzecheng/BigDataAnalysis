 '''Nicotine''' is a [[drug]] in tobacco [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[Pipe (smoke)|pipe]] [[tobacco]], chewing tobacco, vaping liquids and some [[e-cigarette]]s. Nicotine is an [[addiction|addictive]] [[stimulant]] that causes the heart to beat faster and makes [[blood pressure]] rise. It can also make a person feel less hungry and speeds up the [[metabolism]]. These effects can be very unhealthy. Many people who use tobacco products want to quit but have a hard time quitting. It is one of the most addictive chemicals that is widely consumed by humans. It can be as addictive as [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]]. 
 
 Nicotine is a substance found in most members of the [[nightshade]] family of plants. Small quantities of it can be found in [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[aubergine]]s (eggplants) and green pepper (''Capsicum'', the peppers used as [[vegetable]]s). Nicotine is also in the [[Coca]] plant. In higher quantities it is a very efficient [[poison]]. It acts on the [[nerve]]s. It is a [[stimulant]] in lower quantities. It is the main reason people are [[addiction|addicted]] to smoking. 
 
 Nicotine is named after [[Jean Nicot]]. Nicot was a [[French people|French]] [[ambassador]] in [[Portugal]]. In 1560 he sent tobacco seeds to [[Paris]] for analysis (as a drug). 
 
 Besides the treatment of nicotine dependency, it seems that the drug can also be used to treat special (severe) forms of [[epilepsy]], as well as some other diseases. 
 
 == Cigarette == 
 The amount of nicotine in one cigarette varies greatly. Factors which influence the amount include type of tobacco; brand of cigarette; and country or region (some markets restrict maximum average nicotine levels). Different ways of smoking a cigarette influence how much nicotine gets into the smoker.
