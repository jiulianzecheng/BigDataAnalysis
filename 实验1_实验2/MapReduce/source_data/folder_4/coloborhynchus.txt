 '''''Coloborhynchus''''' was a [[pterosaur]]. It has been found in [[Lower Cretaceous]] rocks in [[England]] and [[Brazil]]. It is a similar [[genus]] to ''[[Anhanguera]]'' and ''[[Ornithocheirus]]''. 
 
 The [[type specimen]] of ''Coloborhynchus'' is known only from a partial upper jaw. It can only be distinguished from its relatives by its [[wikt:unique|unique]] combination of [[tooth]] socket positions. In ''Coloborhynchus'', the two front teeth pointed forward and were higher on the jaw than the other teeth, while the next three pairs of teeth pointed to the sides. The final two pairs of teeth in this specimen point downward. Finally, a unique oval depression was located below the first pair of teeth. < ref name=rodrigues & kellner2008 > Rodrigues T. and Kellner A.W.A. 2008.

 The possible species ''Coloborhynchus capito'' is the largest toothed pterosaur known. A specimen from the [[Cambridge]] [[Greensand]] has a very large upper jaw tip which displays the typical teeth which distinguish ''C. capito'' from other species. The jaw tip is nearly 10 cm tall and 5.6 cm wide, with teeth up to 1.3 cm in base [[diameter]]. If the proportions of this specimen was the same as other known species of ''Coloborhycnhus'', the total [[skull]] length could have been up to 75 cm, leading to an estimated wingspan of {{convert|7|m|ft}}. < ref name=martill & unwin2011 > Martill D.M. and Unwin D.M. 2011.
