'''Palaeoclimatology''' (or '''paleoclimatology''') is the study of changes in [[climate]] over the entire [[history of Earth]]. Modern interest in [[climate change]] has caused a great increase in the climates of the past. 
 
 The climates of the past can only be studied by [[proxy]]. [[Data]] comes from studying [[rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[ice]] and [[tree rings]], [[coral]]s, [[shell (zoology)|shells]] and [[microfossil]]s. These records are used to work out the past states of the [[Earth]]'s climate and its [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] system. 
 
 Studies of past changes in the life and [[ecosystems]] of the past may throw a light on the present. An example is the effect of climate on [[mass extinction]]s and the recovery of life after those extinctions. < ref name= " SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction " > {{cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | author=Sahney S. and Benton M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65| pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}} < /ref >

 == Notable climate events in Earth history == 
 Knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes further back in time. Some notable climate events: 
 * [[Faint young Sun]]  
 * [[Huronian glaciation]] (~2400 mya Earth completely covered in ice probably due to [[Great Oxygenation Event]]) 
 * Later [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Snowball Earth]] (~600 mya, precursor to the [[Cambrian Explosion]]) 
 * [[Carboniferous]] rainforest collapse (~300 mya) 
 * [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] (251.4 mya) 
 * [[Anoxic event|Oceanic Anoxic Events]] (~120 mya, 93 mya, and others) 
 * [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] ({{period start|Paleogene}} mya) 
 * [[Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum]] ([[Paleocene]]–[[Eocene]], 55mya) 
 * [[Younger Dryas]]/The Big Freeze (~11 kya) 
 * [[Holocene]] climatic optimum (~7-3 kya) 
 * Climate changes of 535–536 AD 
 * Medieval warm period (900–1300) 
 * [[Little ice age]] (1300–1800)
