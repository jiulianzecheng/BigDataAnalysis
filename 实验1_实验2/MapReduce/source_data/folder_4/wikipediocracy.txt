It lets people who sign up talk about [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. < ref name= " Salon 1 " > {{cite news|newspaper=Salon|title=Revenge, ego, and the corruption of Wikipedia|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/17/revenge_ego_and_the_corruption_of_wikipedia/|date=May 17, 2013|last=Leonard|first=Andrew}} < /ref >  It is like the [[Wikipedia Review]], another website for talking about how people feel about Wikipedia and the organisations and people that run it. 
 
 ==History== 
 Wikipediocracy was created by users of the website the Wikipedia Review in March 2012. It says it shows how Wikipedia works and that there are problems with Wikipedia. It says there is corruption at Wikipedia and alsoÂ  that there are problems with the way it was built. < ref > {{cite web|title=Message|url=http://wikipediocracy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13 & t=15|accessdate=November 16, 2013|publisher=Wikipediocracy}} < /ref >  A reporter for ''The Daily Dot'', which is an online newspaper, has written that Wikipediocracy exposes the bad side of Wikipedia. < ref > {{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Dot|url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-staffers-vandalizing-wikipedia/|date=April 23, 2013|last=Morris|first=Kevin|title=Wikipedia says its staffers are not vandalizing Wikipedia}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2013, users of the website gave personal information about  " Qworty " , a Wikipedia user, to a writer for ''Salon'', an online newspaper. They revealed his offline identity, along with bad things he had been doing, and the writer published it on ''Salon''. < ref name= " Salon 1 " / >
