 In [[medicine]], the word '''blackout''' is a form of [[amnesia]]. The amnesia may be complete or partial. Such an amnesia can be provoked by:  
 * [[Stress (biology)]] for example, before an [[examination]]. 
 * [[Alcohol]]: People suffering from such a conditions may also lose [[consciousness]] for a certain time. 
 * Interrupting the supply of [[oxygen]] or [[blood]] to the [[brain]] 
 * Injuries to the brain 
 * Various illnesses 
 
 After the cause is gone full mental powers are usually restored, although there may be a blank in memory.
