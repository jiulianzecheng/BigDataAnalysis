 '''Pigs''' or '''domestic pigs''' are [[mammals]] in the [[genus]] '''''Sus'''''. Pigs are in the [[Suidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[even-toed ungulate]]s.  
 
 Related, but outside the genus, are the [[babirusa]] and the [[warthog]]. Pigs, like all [[Suidae|suids]], are [[native]] to the [[Old World]]. Baby pigs are called piglets or pups. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/piglet |title=Piglet - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2013}} < /ref >  Pigs are [[omnivore]]s and are very social and intelligent animals. < ref > {{cite news|title=Pigs Prove to Be Smart, if Not Vain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/10angier.html | work=The New York Times | first=Natalie|last=Angier|date=10 November 2009}} < /ref >  Its ancestor is the common Eurasian [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa'').

 The flesh of domestic pigs is eaten as food and is called [[pork]]. The [[Jew]]ish and [[Islam|Muslim]] religions, and some Christian [[Christian denomination|denominations]], believe eating pork is wrong. Pig farmers take care that the animals do not get [[diseases]] or [[parasites]] which might harm humans.

 Domestic pigs come in different colours, shapes and sizes. They are usually [[pink]], but little pigs kept as [[pet]]s (''[[pot-bellied pig]]s'') are sometimes other colours. Pigs roll in [[mud]] to protect themselves from [[sun]]light.  Many people think that pigs are dirty and smell. In fact, they roll around in the mud to keep bugs and [[tick]]s away from their skin. This also helps to keep their skin moist and lower their body temperature on hot days. They are [[omnivores]], which means that they eat both plants and animals.  
 
 Pigs are smart [[animal]]s. They are even able to learn how to play [[video game]]s. < ref name= " Telegraph " / >   
 Pigs are commonly used as working animals. They are used to hunt for [[truffle]]s, pull carts and sniff out [[landmine]]s. < ref name= " Telegraph " > https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/8912210/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-pigs.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024000836/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/8912210/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-pigs.html |date=2012-10-24 }} The Telegraph.

 == Care == 
 Pigs need a warm, clean area under a roof to sleep, and they should not be crowded. They need to be checked for sickness regularly. Pigs need lots of water. Over half their body weight is made up of water. < ref > [http://www.goats4h.com/Pigs.html Pig Information]. Retrieved 15 Mar 2011. < /ref >  Pigs should be given all the feed they will eat, which is usually four to five pounds a day for adult pigs. < ref > [http://www.homestead.org/cjmouser/GettingStartedwithPigs.htm Getting Started with Pigs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315114703/http://www.homestead.org/cjmouser/GettingStartedwithPigs.htm |date=2011-03-15 }}.

 Pigs can be found throughout the world living on farms and in the wild, and they are also popular pets. Pigs are kept and slaughtered for their flesh, pork.
