 The '''Pennacook''' (or '''Pawtucket''') were a [[Native American]] people in [[North America]]. They lived along the [[Merrimack River]] in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Massachusetts]]. They spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language. 
 
 When the English [[History of the United States#Colonial America|colonists]] arrived, the Pennacook fled north with the [[Abenaki]], or west with other tribes. Those that went west were hunted down and killed by colonists. Those that fled northward eventually merged with other [[Forced migration|displaced]] tribes from New England.
