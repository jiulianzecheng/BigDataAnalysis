'''Thakur'''  is a historical [[feudal]] title of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is also used as a surname in the present day. The female variant of the title is '''Thakurani''' or '''Thakurain''', and is also used to describe the wife of a Thakur. 
 
 There are varying opinions among scholars about its origin. Some scholars suggest that it is not mentioned in the Sanskrit texts preceding 500 BCE, but speculates that it might have been a part of the vocabulary of the dialects spoken in northern India before the [[Gupta Empire]]. It is viewed to have been derived from word ''Thakkura'' which, according to several scholars, was not an original word of the Sanskrit language but a borrowed word in the Indian lexis from the Tukhara regions of [[Inner Asia]]. Another view-point is that ''Thakkura'' is a loan word from the Prakrit language. 
 
 Scholars have suggested differing meanings for the word, i.e.  " god " ,  " lord " , and  " master of the estate " . Academics have suggested that it was only a title, and in itself, did not grant any authority to its users  " to wield some power in the state " .

 == Origin == 
 [[Nirmal Chandra Sinha]] stated that the word ''Thakura'' is  " unknown "  to the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit and finds no mention in the Sanskrit literature preceding 500 BCE. He suggests, however, that  " the word was possibly current in many north Indian dialects before the Imperial Guptas " . Sinha notes that many scholars, such as Buddha Prakash, [[Frederick William Thomas (philologist)|Frederick Thomas]], [[Harold Bailey]], [[Prabodh Chandra Bagchi|Prabodh Bagchi]], [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Suniti Chatterji]], and [[Sylvain Lévi]], have suggested that ''Thakura'' is a borrowed word in the Indian lexis from the Tukhara regions of Inner Asia. < ref name= " NCS " > {{cite journal |journal=Bulletin of Tibetology |series=New |volume=23 |number=1 |year=1987 |page=18 |publisher=Sikkim Research Institute of Tibetology |place=Gangtok, India |title=Inner Asia and India Through the Ages |first=Nirmal Chandra |last=Sinha |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/bot/pdf/bot_1987_01_full.pdf |via=[[University of Cambridge]]}} < /ref >  Sinha observed:

 [[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] noted that the Sanskrit word ''Thakkura'' finds mention in  " late Sanskrit " . He doubted, however, that ''Thakkura'' is  " an original Sanskrit word "  and was of the opinion that ''Thakkura'' is probably a loan word from the Prakrit language. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali |year=1992 |page=14 |publisher=K. P. Bagchi  &  Company |first=Byomkes |last=Chakrabarti |isbn=978-8170741282 |quote=Mr. Risley has also drawn attention to the fact that the supreme God  " Thakur "  of the Santali traditions bears a Hindi name derived from the Sanskrit origin  " thakkura " . But there is much doubt whether  " thakkura "  itself is an original Sanskrit word. The word occurs in late Sanskrit possibly being borrowed from Prakrit. But if we make a careful analysis of the different languages of the western regions of Asia from Turkish to Bengali we would surely find out traces of similarities of most of these languages with Santali and this will go to show that the tribes had their historical wanderings from the Western part of Asia to the Eastern part of India.}} < /ref >
