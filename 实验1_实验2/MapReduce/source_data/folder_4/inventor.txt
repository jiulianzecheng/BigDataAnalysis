 An '''inventor''' is a person who makes new [[invention]]s, devices that perform some kind of function. The devices are mostly [[electricity|electrical]] or [[mechanics|mechanical]]. Someone that invents new [[idea]]s or [[wiktionary:Method|method]]s on how to do things may also be called an inventor. Inventors can receive a [[patent]]. 
 
 Many inventors make small changes to old [[invention]]s. For example, people have invented new ways to make [[clock]]s over history.  Early clocks were [[sundial]]s, later clocks used water, and [[pendulum]]s.  Modern clocks are often electronic.  Other machines such as [[vehicle]]s are made of many inventions.
