 '''Trostianets''' (also '''Trostyanets'''; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Тростянець) is a city in the [[Sumy Oblast]] in [[Ukraine]], and serves as the administrative center of the Trostianets Raion.  
 
 Many were killed and the city was badly damaged during the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. 
 
 Trostianets was a settlement in the Akhtyrka Uyezd. It arose in the first half of the 17th century, during a new wave of migration of peasants and Cossacks from the Right-bank Ukraine to Sloboda Ukraine. The name of the city is associated with the name of the river Trostyanka, which flows nearby. 
 
 During [[World War II]], the city was occupied by Axis troops from October 1941 to August 1943. In January 1989 the population was 25,706 people. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Всесоюзная перепись населения 1989 г.
