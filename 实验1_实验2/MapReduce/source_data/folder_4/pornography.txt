 '''[[Pornography]]'''  (or '''porn''') is the name for [[story|writing]], pictures, and films which feature [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] for the sole or primary purpose of [[Sexual arousal|arousing]] people sexually, either to help them [[masturbation|masturbate]], or to prepare them for sex with a partner.  
 
 When the purpose of these works is not arousal, but for example education, or art,  these works are not called pornographic. People instead speak about [[eroticism| " erotica.

 In the law of most countries, showing [[nudity|naked]] people is not called  " pornography "  unless the people are doing something sexual; even so, material that counts as pornographic may still be legal. When people consider photographs or movies to harm or to disrespect the people depicted or the viewers, or to violate the community's [[moral]] or [[religion|religious]] standards, they condemn the material as  " obscene. "   Most countries have laws against obscenity. One type of pornography against the law in most countries is [[child pornography]].  
 
 Pornography can be made in different media.  Some ways include [[photograph|photos]], [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, [[animation]]s, and [[movie]]s. Live shows (like sex shows or [[striptease]]) are usually not considered pornography. Pornography is made to [[Entertainment|entertain]] adults. Many people are involved in the industry of making, selling, or showing pornography.  People shown in pornographic movies are called [[pornographic actor]]s (or actresses), and when they attain the popularity to appear in many films, they are called  " porn stars. " 
 
 == Definition == 
 The word  " pornography "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words meaning  " [[prostitution|prostitute]] "  and  " writing " . < ref > {{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate(R) Dictionary|chapter=Pornography|location=Springfield|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=2004}} < /ref >  The word was first used for stories about sex, but is now also used for [[photograph]]s, paintings, illustrations, cartoons, and [[movie]]s that depict sex to arouse people to sexual activity.  It is also called  " porn "  or  " porno "  for short.   
 
 === What is ''not'' pornography ===

 There are different ideas about what is and what is not pornography. Diana Russell, a [[psychologist]], says that there is a [[difference]] between pornography and [[Eroticism|erotica]]. < ref name=DR > {{Cite web|url=http://www.dianarussell.com/porn_as_a_cause_of_rape.html|title = Pornography as a Cause of Rape}} < /ref >   The word  " erotica "  is often used for pictures, movies or stories that focus on the beauty of sexuality.  There is not often a clear difference between  " erotica "  and  " pornography. "  The [[dispute]] over what is or is not pornography can even go to the [[court]]s. 
 
 Some people believe that anything that shows a [[Nudity|naked body]] is a type of pornography. The laws of the [[United States]] and many other countries do not support this. < ref name=NCAC > {{cite web |url=http://www.ncac.org/action_issues/Nudity_ & _Pornography.cfm |publisher=National Coalition against Censorship |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208094211/http://www.ncac.org/action_issues/Nudity_%26_Pornography.cfm |title=Sex, Nudity, and Pornography |archivedate=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2016 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  There can be all sorts of reasons for showing a naked or partly undressed body.  Some of these reasons include art work or a [[medical]] [[diagram]]. 
 
 == Types of pornography == 
 [[File:AN Penny Flame 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pictures that show models in a sexy pose are sometimes called  " soft porn " .]] 
 
 There are different kinds of pornography. The term  " soft porn "  is sometimes used for pictures that show people who may or may not be naked, but who are [[pose]]d in a sexy manner. Pictures of women like this are sometimes called  " cheesecake, "  and pictures of men are called  " beefcake. "  Pornographic pictures or movies which show people having sex are sometimes called  " hard porn. " 
 
 == The business of pornography == 
 [[Business]]es have been making pornography for many years. Until the 1970s, businesses making pornography were small since there were many laws against it. In the 1970s, pornographic magazines such as ''Penthouse'' became a huge and successful business. Pornographic movies also become popular at this time. In the 1980s, the [[creation]] of the [[video cassette recorder]] caused a rise in the pornography business. A number of companies began making pornographic videotapes in the United States. In the 1990s, as more people began using the [[Internet]], businesses began selling pornographic pictures on the Internet. In the 2000s, the increased speed of computers allowed pornography companies to sell porn videos over the Internet. The pornography brand Mitchell Gaffney was the first website that contained such items.  
 
 Many different kinds of businesses make and sell pornography: [[magazine]]s such as [[Playboy]] and [[Hustler]], movie companies such as [[Vivid Video]], and [[web site]]s, such as [[Pornhub]], that make and sell porn. Since  " pornography "  is a word that many people consider being the name for something that is morally wrong or ugly, businesses do not say that they are in  " the business of pornography, "  but rather in the  " adult [[entertainment]] "  business. 
 
 == Pornography and the law == 
 In the nations of [[Western Europe]] and the United States, the law permits people who have reached the legal age of [[Adult|adulthood]] (the age of majority) to own, buy, sell, make, or participate in pornography.  Laws about the public display of pornographic materials for sale may vary in the West: in [[The Netherlands]] the very [[liberal]] laws allow stores that sell pornography to display books, magazines, photographs, and the covers of videos openly, but in [[Canada]] and the United States the laws require that such stores keep pornographic material out of the sight of children. In some parts of Asia ([[Indonesia]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]]) making or owning pornography is a crime. 
 
 In the law of most countries, those people who have not reached the age of majority, or minors, may not buy, let alone sell, pornography of any sort.  More importantly, there are laws against showing minors naked in photographs or films meant to arouse others sexually or showing them engaged in sexual acts.  Such material is called  " [[child pornography]], "  and is considered not just illegal, but a serious crime.  The laws against child pornography (also called  " child porn " ) are meant to protect children against people who  " use "  or  " [[exploitation|exploit]] "  them. The laws also require those who make pornographic photos or films to keep records to prove that their models, actors, and actresses are over the age of legal majority. 
 
 == Criticism of pornography == 
 
 Since the 1970s, many women's groups and [[feminist]] writers have criticized pornography, especially hardcore pornography, arguing that such pornography degrades and humiliates women. Some [[psychology|psychologists]] who have talked with many people in jail for violent sex crimes believe that pornographic depictions of violent sex often make people less caring about other people's feelings, which might make them more likely to commit rape and other sex crimes. Many [[pedophile]]s, who sexually assault children, also have collections of child pornography. < ref name= " anderson " > {{cite web|title=Kerby Anderson, ''Pornography''|url=http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/porno.html}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Jay Rogers, ''The Documented Effects of Pornography''|url=http://forerunner.com/forerunner/X0388_Effects_of_Pornograp.html|access-date=2008-05-01|archive-date=2008-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512144918/http://www.forerunner.com/forerunner/X0388_Effects_of_Pornograp.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   < !---NOTE: The two references here pertain to the entire paragraph, not just to the last sentence.--- >   
 
 [[Religion|Religious]] people believe that, because it depicts the sexual act without any relation to love and marriage, pornography is unholy. Most parents do not wish their children to see pornography because they believe that it will make them less capable of romantic love. Special computer programs can be installed on computers to block access to pornographic websites, or websites otherwise objectionable.   
 
 In the [[novel]] ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], pornography is described as a tool that is secretly pushed by some evil [[government]]s, who believe that the use of pornography makes the [[:wikt:public|public]] less likely to care about [[injustice]], let alone to [[rebel]]. 
 
 == Other problems with pornography == 
 Even though many countries have laws against child pornography, enforcement has become a problem because new computer technologies allow pornographers to make an adult in a photograph look like an adolescent, or in making a film can use actors and actresses who, although they have passed the age of majority, still look much younger. In addition, organized crime makes money from [[Human trafficking|trafficking human beings]]; they force [[girl]]s and [[women]] into [[prostitution]], and sometimes force them to make pornography.
