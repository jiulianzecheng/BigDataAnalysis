[[File:Giardia lamblia SEM 8698 lores.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' is a  [[parasitic]] [[flagellate|flagellate protozoan]] which causes 'beaver fever'. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/giardiasis/fact_sheet.htm|title=Giardiasis (beaver fever) Fact Sheet|website=www.health.ny.gov}} < /ref > ]] 
 
 '''Protozoa''' are [[microorganism]]s.  They are single-celled [[heterotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s, which eat [[bacteria]] and other food sources. 
 
 It is an old term, and the wider term [[protist]] is generally preferred today.  However, 'protozoa' is often used for convenience, especially in junior education. < ref > Gunter, Michelle 2008. ''Passing the North Carolina 8th grade end of grade test of science. American Book Company. {{ISBN|978-1-59807-186-3}} < /ref >   It is a convenient hold-all term, and most systems of [[taxonomy]]  classify 'protozoa' into several different [[phyla]]. 
 
 The term is problematic because modern [[biochemical]] and [[genetic]] techniques show that it includes several quite different kinds of [[cell]]s. They are found only in moist or aquatic habitats. Many protozoan species are [[symbiont]]s, some are [[parasites]], and some are [[predators]] of soil bacteria and [[algae]]. About 30,000 protozoan species are known.  The study of protists is called  " protistology " .{{fact|date=August 2023}}
