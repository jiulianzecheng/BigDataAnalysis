 A '''pika''' is a small [[mammal]] related to the [[hare]] and the [[rabbit]] ([[lagomorph]]). Pikas are also known as '''rock rabbits''' or '''coneys'''. Pikas have short limbs, a round body, an even coat of fur, round ears, and no external tail. < ref > {{cite web|author=Melissa Breyer|date=2 September 2016|title=Meet the 'mouse-bunny' that could vanish from the US|url=https://www.treehugger.com/animals/what-know-about-mouse-bunny-could-vanish-states.html|publisher=treehugger}} < /ref >   
 
 There are 37 different [[species]] of pika. Most pikas live in colder climates, on [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] mountain slopes. Pikas need cold temperatures to live, and can die if exposed to temperatures above {{convert|77.9|F|C|order=flip}}. < ref > {{Cite web|title=American Pika|url=https://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/pika.html|access-date=2018-11-18|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|archive-date=2020-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020232810/https://www.fws.gov/nevada/nv_species/pika.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They live in [[Asia]], [[North America]] and parts of Eastern [[Europe]]. They are [[diurnal|active during the day]] or [[crepuscular|twilight]]. Pikas do not [[hibernation|hibernate]]. Because they do not hibernate, during the summer they gather food for winter. They collect [[hay]], which they pile up to dry. They sometimes steal hay from each other. This often results in disputes. [[Predator]]s, like [[ferret]]s, and large birds often use these disputes to catch pikas.  
 
 Pikas are [[Herbivore|herbivores]] and eat many kinds of plants, such as [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[moss]], and [[Lichen|lichens]].  
 
 Pikas in [[Eurasia]] often live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Some species are territorial. Pikas in North America are [[wiktionary:asocial|asocial]] outside of breeding season. < ref name= " AnimalDiversity " > {{cite web|last=Leininger|first=Charlene|date=2009|title=''Ochotona collaris''|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Ochotona_collaris/|access-date=March 23, 2021|website=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=|quote=}} < /ref >
