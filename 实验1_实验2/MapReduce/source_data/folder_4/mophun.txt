 '''Mophun''' is a [[computing platform]] used to run [[porting|portable code]] on [[embedded system|embedded]] and [[mobile device]]s. Some phones and other devices support Mophun. [[Sony Ericsson]] phones, especially the [[Sony Ericsson T300]] and [[Sony Ericsson T610]], are the best known devices for running Mophun. It was designed by Synergenix Interactive. Most Mophun programs are around 50–150 [[kilobyte|kB]] in size. 
 
 Programs for Mophun are written in [[assembler]] in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] using a well-documented and open [[API]]. A special version of [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] is used to compile programs. < ref name= " Why Mophun failed " > https://simonkagstrom.livejournal.com/8885.html Why Mophun failed: simonkagstrom — LiveJournal < /ref > 
 
 Despite the API being very easy for programmers to use, Mophun has not been very popular. The main reason for this seems to be the strict approval process - the compiled program can only be run under an emulator, and Synergenix must approve the program so it can be used on a mobile device. The approved program can only be run under one [[International Mobile Equipment Identity|IMEI number]]. Only developers registered and approved by Synergix can use self-certification (and through the Synergenix server), and they are only allowed to have one IMEI number. The developer must sign a sales contract with Synergenix, which then shares and approves it for end-users, so the program can be shared. Such a process disallows free programs to be created for Mophun, and also discourages many developers from developing programs for Mophun. < ref name= " Why Mophun failed " / >
