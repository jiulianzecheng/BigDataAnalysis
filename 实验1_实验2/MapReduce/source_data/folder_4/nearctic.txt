 The '''Nearctic''' is one of the eight [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[ecozone]]s dividing the Earth's land surface. 
 
 In [[ecology]], an ecozone is a large land mass that contains many [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s, each of which has unique [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. 
 
 The Nearctic ecozone covers most of [[North America]], including [[Greenland]] and the highlands of [[Mexico]].  
 
 Southern Mexico, southern [[Florida]], [[Central America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands are part of the [[Neotropic]] ecozone, together with [[South America]]. 
 
 The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) divides the Nearctic into four '''Bioregions''', defined as  " geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).
