 In [[computing]], '''rlogin''' is a [[Unix]] [[Computer software|program]] that allows users to log in on another [[Server (computing)|host]] using a [[computer network|network]]. rlogin uses [[Internet protocol suite|TCP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 513. It was first distributed as part of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.2BSD]] release.  rlogin is also the name of the [[application layer]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] used by the software, also the protocol is part of the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP protocol suite]].

 rlogin has several serious security problems, the most important are: 
 * All information, including passwords, is transmitted unencrypted (making it open to interception). There is a modern version, called Rlogin Kerberos, that uses the [[MIT]] [[Kerberos]] authentication technique. 
 * The protocol partially depends on the remote rlogin [[client]] to provide information honestly (including source port and source host name).  A corrupt client is thus able to rebuild this and gain access. 
 * The protocol lacks any means of authenticating other machines' identities, ensuring that the rlogin [[client]] is running on a trusted machine, or if it is the ''real'' rlogin client. 
 
 Due to its serious problems, rlogin was rarely used across untrusted networks (like the public internet), and rlogin distributions are no longer included by default with many [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] distributions. Many networks which were depending on rlogin and [[telnet]] have replaced it with [[Secure Shell|SSH]] and the ''rlogin secured equivalent'' slogin.
