'''Alcmene''' '' < small > ALK-meen < /small > '' is a person mentioned in [[Greek mythology]]. She is not a goddess, for Alcmene was mortal. She was the daughter of King [[Elektryon]] of [[Mycenae]] and his wife [[Anaxo]]. She was the wife of [[Amphitryon]]. She is the mother of [[Herakles|Heracles]] '' < small > HERR-uh-klees < /small > '' and [[Iphicles]]. 
 
 Once when Amphitryon was not at home, the god [[Zeus]], seduced Alcmene in the form of Amphitryon. Alcmene gave birth to Heracles, who was the son of Zeus, and Iphicles, who was the son of Amphitryon. Zeus wanted to kill her for yet another unknown reason of godlore, but Heracles, one day old, saved her.
