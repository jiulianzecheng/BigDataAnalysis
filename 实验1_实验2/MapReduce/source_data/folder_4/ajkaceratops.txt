 ==Description== 
 The Ajkaceratops has a [[skull]] that looks a lot like a [[Protoceratops]] skull, except that it has a hump near the beak. The body is slender and long, compared to the skull. The tail is very short for its size. Ajkaceratops would have walked quadrupedally and eaten low vegetation. < ref > prehistoric wildlife.com < /ref >  Ajkaceratops may have reached the part of europe in which it was found by Island-hopping. < ref > mindat.org < /ref > < ref > A dinosaur a day. < /ref >
