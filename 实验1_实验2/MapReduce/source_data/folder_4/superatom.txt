Superatoms are atoms that have the power to mimic any element property. They were built when chemists had noticed that certain arrangements of atoms acted as scaled up versions of a single atom of a different kind. The electrons are in shells around it's core, with determine chemical properties of an atom, in which the superatom takes those characteristics. Normal atoms have their own properties, but superatoms can mimic any properties.
