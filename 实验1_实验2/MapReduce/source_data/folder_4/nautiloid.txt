 '''Nautiloids''' are a large and varied group of [[ocean|marine]] [[cephalopod]]s ([[Mollusca]]) in the [[subclass]] Nautiloidea. They began in the later [[Cambrian]]. ''[[Nautilus]]'' is the only surviving [[genus]].  
 
 Nautiloids flourished during the early [[Palaeozoic]] [[era]], when they were the main predatory animals. They developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of [[fossil]] nautiloids are known, though only a few species survive today. < ref name=bigbook > Teichert C. 1988. Main features of cephalopod evolution.

 == Taxonomic relationships == 
 Nautiloids are among the group of animals known as [[cephalopoda|cephalopods]]. The cephalopods are an advanced class of [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. The cephalopods also include [[Ammonite|ammonoids]], [[Belemnite]]s and modern [[coleoidea|coleoids]] such as [[octopus]] and [[squid]].  
 
 Traditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids.  This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea ''sensu lato''. 
 
 [[Cladistics|Cladistically]] speaking, nautiloids are a [[paraphyletic]] group united by shared primitive ([[basal]]) features not found in [[derived]] cephalopods. In other words, they are a [[evolutionary grade]] that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids. They are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups.  Both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from  [[Bactritida|bactritids]], which in turn arose from straight-shelled [[orthocerid]] nautiloids. < ref name=bigbook/ >    
 
 The [[ammonoidea|ammonoids]] (a group which includes the [[ammonite]]s and the [[goniatite]]s) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids which evolved early in the [[Devonian]], some 400 million years ago.
