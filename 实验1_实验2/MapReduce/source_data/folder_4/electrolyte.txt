An '''electrolyte''' is a [[chemical]] that conducts [[electrical current]]. It is used in [[battery|batteries]] to make the [[ion]]s flow, producing current. Electrolytes ionize when dissolved in suitable [[solvent]]s such as water. Most soluble [[salt]]s, [[acids]], and bases are electrolytes.  
 
 An electrolyte used in  " [[electrolytic cell]]s "  carries the [[ions]] between the [[electrode]]s of the cell.  Electrolytic cells may be used to extract constituent [[chemical element|elements]] and [[chemical compound|compounds]] contained in the [[solution]]. 
 
 A correct concentration of electrolytes is important to [[physiology]].
