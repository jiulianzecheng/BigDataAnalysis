 '''Bagels''' are a type of bread made with flour. They look like [[doughnuts]], and they are leavened with [[yeast]]. They have a [[wikt:crisp|crisp]], shiny crust and a dense inside. Bagels are glazed, and in a [[Torus|ring-shaped]] roll. They are different from doughnuts because they are boiled before baked. Bagels are sometimes called  " the cement doughnuts " .  
 The bagel is regarded as a special kind of Jewish food. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48756/bagel |title=bagel (food) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |access-date=1 May 2010}} < /ref >  They are eaten usually for breakfast or a snack. 
 
 Bagels are made from the basic bread ingredients of [[flour]], yeast, [[salt]], and sweet kinds of spices. Flour gives the bread its chewy taste, which can be made more light by eggs, milk, and butter. They are the only bread product that is boiled before it is baked. 
 
 == Serving == 
 Bagels are often toasted in a toaster and then paired with foods like [[cream cheese]] (a soft cheese that tastes a little sweet) and [[jam]], or with butter. Bagels can also be used to make [[sandwich]]es, with [[meat]] (for example smoked salmon) and [[Egg (food)|egg]] and [[cheese]]. Bagel sandwiches are usually eaten for [[breakfast]] or lunch. 
 
 == History == 
 Bagels were formally an obscure ethnic treat found only in the city's Jewish neighourhoods. Bagels were first sold in grocery stores in the 1950s. Frozen bagels were first introduced in 1960. < ref name= " trivia " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/fbagel.html|title=Food Facts  &  Trivia: Bagels|access-date=1 May 2010|work=foodreference.com}} < /ref > 
 
 When Polish Jews went away to America, they brought the beugel with them. The first beugel bakeries were founded in New York City in the 1920s. Later the name was changed and called a bagel. Bagels have been used as a symbol of the continuous cycle of lifeâ€”without beginning and without end. < ref name= " trivia "  / > 
 
 In the East End of London, the bagel is known as a beigel, and poplar in many of the areas where many Jewish immigrants first arrived in London in the 19th century, such as Whitechapel and Spitalfields, and Brick Lane in particular, home to the Beigel Bake.
