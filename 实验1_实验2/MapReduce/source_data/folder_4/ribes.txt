 '''''Ribes''''' is a [[genus]] of about 150 species of [[Angiosperms|flowering plants]]. They are native throughout the [[temperate]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It is the only genus in the family '''Grossulariaceae'''. < ref name=APGIII2009 > {{Cite journal |last=[[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105â€“121 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1095-8339.2003.t01-1-00158.x/pdf | format= PDF |accessdate=2013-07-06 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }} < /ref >   Seven sub[[genera]] are recognized. 
 
 Sometimes ''Ribes'' is instead put in the family [[Saxifragaceae]]. A few taxonomists place the [[gooseberry]] species in a separate genus of ''Grossularia''. 
 
 ==Cultivation== 
 The genus ''Ribes'' includes the edible currants ([[blackcurrant]], [[redcurrant]], [[white currant]]), [[gooseberry]], and several hybrid varieties. It should not be confused with the dried currant used in cakes and puddings, which is a [[cultivar]] of small [[grape]] ([[Zante currant]]). ''Ribes'' gives its name to the popular blackcurrant cordial [[Ribena]]. 
 
 The genus also includes the group of ornamental plants collectively known as the flowering currants, for instance ''[[Ribes sanguineum|R. sanguineum]]''.
