 '''Ovaries''' ([[Singular]]: '''Ovary''') are [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] found in [[female]] [[organism]]s. Ovaries are part of the [[reproductive system]] needed to [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]].  
 
 Most [[vertebrate]]s have ovaries. Usually animals have two ovaries. [[Bird]]s usually have only one working ovary; [[snake]]s have one ovary in front of the other. The ovaries are similar to [[testicle]]s in men. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 Ovaries are shaped like [[egg (biology)|egg]]s and are around 3 [[centimeter|cm]] by 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm. The ovary is found in the side walls of the [[pelvis]].  
 
 Each ovary is attached to the [[Fallopian tube]]. Usually each ovary takes turns releasing eggs every [[month]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Ovaries have two purposes: 
 * Produce female sex [[hormone]]s resulting in [[puberty]] 
 * Produce [[ovum|ova]] (also called  " egg cells " ), which are the female [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] cells. 
 
 == Menstruation == 
 {{Main|Menstruation}} 
 During menstruation, an ovum is released from the ovary and enters one of the Fallopian tubes. There, the ovum can be fertilised. Ovaries have a certain number of eggs in them, so when eggs stop being released, this is the start of the [[menopause]]. During this time, female hormones stop being produced.
