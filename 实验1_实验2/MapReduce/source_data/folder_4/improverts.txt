 The '''Improverts''' are an [[Improvisation|improvised]] [[comedy]] group based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. They are a part of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company. Their home is the [[Bedlam Theatre]]. It has been their home since they were created 18 years ago. The group is similar to ''[[Who's Line is it Anyway?]]'', [[Comedy Store Players]], and [[Keith Johnstone]] in that they use short improvised [[game]]s.  
 
 They have taken part in the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] almost every year since they were formed. Also they have played every Friday night during the [[school]] year (as their main [[audience]] is [[Edinburgh University]] [[student]]s).  
 
 Because they are always in [[Bedlam Theatre]], the [[theatre]] [[technician]]s improvise the [[sound]]s, [[music]] and [[light]]s along with the scenes the [[actor|performers]] are doing. The sounds can be loud and annoying at times. The technicians show off their very big [[iTunes]] [[library]] of [[songs]] and [[sound effect]]s. [[United Kingdom|British]] [[1980s|80's]] [[child]]ren's [[television programme|programmes']] [[theme]]s  are a favourite of theirs. 
 
 Past players have gone on to many different things. They have created an improv group in [[London]], joined the [[Stand Players]]'  " [[Who's Lunch is it anyway]] "  free improv show at Edinburgh's [[The Stand (theatre)|The Stand]] [[comedy]] [[theater|venue]] and become successful [[stand up]] [[comedian]]s. Some have starred in British [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]], [[television]] [[drama]]s, [[movie]]s and popular children's programmes
