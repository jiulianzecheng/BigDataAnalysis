'''Megasthenes''' ({{lang-grc|Μεγασθένης}}, ca. 350 – 290 BCE) was a Greek [[ethnographer]] and explorer in the [[Hellenistic period]]. He wrote the work ''Indica''. He was born in [[Asia Minor]] (now [[Turkey]]). 
 
 [[Arrian]] says that Megasthenes lived in [[Arachosia]], with the [[satrap]] [[Sibyrtius]]. He visited India from there:

 " Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting [[Sandracottus]], the king of the Indians. "  [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]''  < ref > [http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp v,6] < /ref > 
 < /blockquote > 
 
 At the beginning of his ''Indica'', he speaks about the older Indians who know about when [[Dionysus]] and [[Hercules]] arrived in India. This story was very popular during the [[Alexandrian period]]. What he says about the religions of the Indians is important. He mentions the [[devotee]]s of Heracles (Lord Krishna) and Dionysus (Lord Shiva or King Lord Indra). However, he does not mention Buddhists. This could mean that the religion was not well known before [[Ashoka]] took power. < ref > [[Demetrios Vassiliades|Vassiliades, Demetrios]],  " Greeks and Buddhism Historical Contacts in the Development of a Universal religion " The Eastern Buddhist, Vol. XXXVI, No. 1  &  2, Otani University, Kyoto 2005. < /ref > 
 
 Writers like [[Arrian]], [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus]] and [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] refer to ''Indica'' in their works. Arrian said the best things about Megasthenes, but Strabo and Pliny do not treat him with as much respect.  
 
 Megasthenes' ''Indica'' is the first well-known description of India by someone from the Western world.
