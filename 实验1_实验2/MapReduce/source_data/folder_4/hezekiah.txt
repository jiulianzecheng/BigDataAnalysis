 '''Hezekiah''' (meaning God will strengthen) or ''' {{lang|he|יְחִזְקִיָּ֫הוּ}}''' Ḥizqiyyāhu ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), also [[translation|translated]] as Ḥizkiyyahu (and sometimes as Ezekias ([[Greek language|Greek]]), Khizkiyahu, Yəḥizqiyyāhu, Y'khizkiyahu), was a king of [[Judah]] that appears in the book of [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]], chapters 18 to 32, and the book of [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] chapters 18 to 20. He was one of the few kings who is compared [[wikt:favorable|favorably]] with [[David]], and is unique for his trust in the Lord:  " There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. He held fast to the LORD and did not cease (stop) to follow him "  (NIV). < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:5,6}} < /ref > 
 
 Hezekiah was the son of Judah's King [[Ahaz]], and is best known for turning his people away from the sins of his father Ahaz, [[wikt:restore|restoring]] worship in the temple, and having his life made 15 years longer. < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Kings|20}} < /ref >  The Book of 2 Chronicles tells more about Hezekiah than any other king after [[Solomon]], and suggests that he is a  " second Solomon "  in his celebration of the [[Passover]], his [[wealth]], his [[honor]], and his land. 
 
 Toward the end of his [[reign]], he became very sick and close to death. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him miraculously. The king of [[Babylon]] heard about it and sent men with a letter and gift to Hezekiah. Because Hezekiah was proud of his riches, he showed all of his treasures to the visitors. The [[prophet]] [[Isaiah]] [[prediction|predicted]] that it all would later be taken by the Babylonians. His prediction came true. < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:27-31}} < /ref > < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Kings|25}} < /ref > < ref name=ABF > {{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=978-1603207782|pages=176, 179}} < /ref >
