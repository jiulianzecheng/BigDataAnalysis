 Halva has a number of geographical sources: from [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Poland]], and [[Ukraine]]. It is considered a national dish in [[Turkey]]. There are many types of halva. In Israel, crude sesame base is popular. In Russia, halva made out of Sunflower seeds is popular. 
 
 == Types and preparation == 
 *[[Sesame]] or [[Peanut]] - Made from raw [[tahini]], mixed with sugar syrup and sometimes honey. The ingredients are mixed to form a solid, fatty lump, that easily melts in heat, break apart easily, and become easier to make. This is the most popular type of halva in Israel. It usually shows the marble lines made by mixing fat and sugar. In [[Bukhara]], a Bukharan peanut halva called  " [[Labaz]] "  is made. 
 
 * [[Semolina]] - It is the most common type in Eastern countries, such as Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and India. It is based on [[wheat bran]] [[Starch|starches]]. The fat is added from another source: usually soybean oil, while the sweetness comes from syrup or honey. Indian semolina halva is called suji halva, a wheat flour halva called ata kahalva. In Iraq, halva is made from wheat flour and semolina. It is served with Iraqi [[pita]] before meal. 
 
 * [[Sunflower seeds]] - Its main source of fat is [[sunflower]] seeds. It is common in countries around Russia. They got their recipe from neighboring Turkey. The recipe is almost identical to sesame one. 
 
 * [[Goat cheese]] - It is common to make a halva from goat cheese in Lebanon and Greece.  
 
 * [[Cornflour]] - In Saudi Arabia, halva is made from cornflour, butter, sugar, cardamom and saffron. 
 
 * [[Flour]] - In Bulgaria, Iraq and Iran, halva flour is also used as a substitute for semolina. 
 
 * [[Rice]] - In the area of the city of Shiraz in Iran, it is commonly prepared using cooked rice. 
 
 == Other uses ==
