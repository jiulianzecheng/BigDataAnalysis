 '''Narazuke''' (ならづけ、奈良漬) is a type of traditional pickle produced in [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Making pickles using the byproduct of alcohol was first widely used in the Korean Peninsula during the time of [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]]. It was then spread to Japan, which later evolved into the current form of pickles produced in Nara Prefecture.
