 '''Tubuai''' is the name for a [[archipelago|group]] of [[island]]s in the [[Pacific]]. The island of Tubuai is about 640 & nbsp;km south of [[Tahiti]]. It is part of the [[Austral Islands]], which belong to [[French Polynesia]]. Slightly over 2.000 people live on an area of  about 45 square kilometers. [[James Cook]] discovered the island in 1777, but saw no reason to land there. The natives looked hostile. [[Fletcher Christian]] landed there in 1789. They founded Fort George on the island, but soon left, because of troubles with the natives.
