 The '''perianth''' ('''perigonium''', '''perigon''' or '''perigone''' in [[monocots]]) is the non-reproductive part of the [[flower]]. It forms an envelope surrounding the sexual organs.  < ref > Beentje H.  &  Williamson J. 2010. ''The Kew Plant Glossary: an illustrated dictionary of plant terms''. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Kew Publishing. < /ref > 
 
 It includes the [[calyx]] ([[sepal]]s) and the [[corolla]] ([[petal]]s) when called a perigone.  
 
 The term ''perianth'' is got from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:περί|περί]] ({{transl|el|peri}},  " around " ) and [[wikt:άνθος|άνθος]] ({{transl|el|anthos}},  " flower " ).  ''Perigonium'' is got from [[wikt:περί|περί]] ({{transl|el|peri}}) and [[wikt:γόνος|γόνος]] ({{transl|el|gonos}},  " seed, sex organs " ). 
 
 In the [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts (Marchantiophyta)]], the perianth is the sterile tubelike tissue that surrounds the female reproductive structure (or developing [[sporophyte]]).
