 ==History== 
 Egloshayle was a medieval river port, rivalling [[Padstow]] five miles downriver. Egloshayle is now a residential suburb of Wadebridge. The town of Wadebridge developed in the parishes of Egloshayle and [[St Breock]]. A Vicar of Egloshayle named Thomas Lovibond was responsible for the building of the first bridge across the River Camel to replace a dangerous ford which was begun in 1468 and completed in 1485. < ref > [http://www.cornishlight.co.uk/wadebridge.htm Wadebridge and the Bridge on Wool at cornishlight.co.uk] < /ref >
