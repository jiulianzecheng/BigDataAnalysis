 == Video games == 
 Bowser's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the last boss, in the last level. The first seven castles in the game had Bowsers, but they were actually his minions, who were disguised as him. The real Bowser is in the eighth castle, the last one. 
 
 Bowser's kids, called the Koopalings, were bosses in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''. However, after ''Super Mario World,'' The Koopalings were no longer said to be Bowser's biological kids, since they are now adopted children and Bowser Jr. is now his biological child. In ''Super Mario World'', Bowser appears in a [[clown]] car and throws Mecha Koopas. 
 
 When Mario moved to the [[Nintendo 64]] with ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Bowser was again the main bad guy. In the remake of this game, [[Super Mario 64 DS]], he is fought as a boss three times. 
 
 He also appears in the Disney movie ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/06/09/the-familiar-faces-of-wreck-it-ralph|accessdate=5 May 2014|title=The Familiar Faces of Wreck-It Ralph|publisher=[[IGN]]}} < /ref >
