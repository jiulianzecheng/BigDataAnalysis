 A '''gift''' or a '''present''' is something (usually [[money]] or a [[Property|good]]) which is given to someone. People give gifts [[Donation|voluntarily]] and do not expect anything in return. A gift is usually something that family or friends give to each other on special occasions like a birthday or holiday. For example you will give and / or receive gifts and presents at [[Christmas]] time, or chocolate (most commonly [[chocolate egg]]s) for [[Easter]]. Gifts are usually something that you really want to have. If it is a [[birthday]] gift, it would be [[money]] or an [[item]] that is not costly. A small gift is usually wrapped in wrapping paper while a big gift is most likely to be just given to the receiver or in a box without wrapping.
