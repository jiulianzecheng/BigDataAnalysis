 '''Yap''' or Wa′ab traditionally refers to an island in the [[Caroline Islands]] of the western [[Pacific Ocean]], a part of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. The name  " Yap "  in recent years has come to also refer to [[Yap State|the state]] within the Federated States of Micronesia, inclusive of the Yap Main Islands and its various outer islands. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The Yap Main Islands are considered to be made up of four separate islands: Yap Island proper (''Marbaq''), Gagil-Tamil, Maap, and Rumung. The four are contiguous, though separated by water, and are surrounded by a common [[coral reef]]. They are formed from an uplift of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]], and are referred to as  " high "  islands as opposed to atolls. The land is mostly rolling hills, densely vegetated. [[Mangrove]] swamps line much of the shore, although there are beaches on the northern sides of the islands. Excluding the reef area, Yap is approximately 24 & nbsp;km long, 5–10 & nbsp;km wide, and 98 & nbsp;km{{sup|2}}.  The highest elevation is {{cvt|178|m}} at Mount Taabiywol in Fanif municipality on Yap island proper.    The [[Yapese people]]'s indigenous cultures and traditions are strong compared to other states in [[Micronesia]]. < ref name= " Natl Geo Picture Atlas " > {{cite book|title=National Geographic Picture Atlas of Our World|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|editor=Mary B. Dickenson|page=235|isbn=0-87044-812-9}} < /ref > 
 
 == Capital == 
 [[Colonia, Yap|Colonia]] is the capital of the [[Yap State|State of Yap]] which includes the Yap Main Islands and the Yap Neighboring Islands—the outer islands (mostly atolls) reaching to the east and south from the Yap Main Islands for some 800 & nbsp;km (500 & nbsp;mi), namely the atolls of Eauripik, Elato, Faraulep, Gaferut, Ifalik, Lamotrek, Ngulu, Olimarao, Piagailoe (West Fayu), Pikelot, Sorol, Ulithi, and Woleai, as well as the islands of Fais and Satawal (see map). Historically, a tributary system existed between the Neighboring Islands and the Yap Main Islands. This probably related to the need for goods from the high islands, including food, as well as wood for construction of seagoing vessels. 
 
 == Population == 
 In 2000 the population of Colonia and ten other [[municipalities]] totalled 11,241. The state has a total land area of {{convert|102|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.fsmgov.org/info/people.html |title=FSM Population |work=Fsmgov.org |access-date=2012-06-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629052438/http://www.fsmgov.org/info/people.html |archive-date=2012-06-29 }} < /ref >
