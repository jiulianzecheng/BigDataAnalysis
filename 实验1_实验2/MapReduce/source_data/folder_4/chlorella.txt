 '''''Chlorella''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Unicellular organism|single-cell]] green [[algae]]. It is in the division [[Chlorophyta]]. It is microscopic in size and round in shape. 
 
 ''Chlorella'' has in its body two green color substances:  " chlorophyll-a "  and  " chlorophyll b. "  It uses [[photosynthesis]], similar to plants which also have chlorophyll. It multiplies rapidly, needing only [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[sunlight]], and a small amount of [[mineral]]s to reproduce. < ref > {{cite journal |first=John |last=Scheffler |date=3 September 2007 |title=Underwater Habitats |journal=Illumin |volume=9 |issue=4 |url=http://illumin.usc.edu/163/underwater-habitats/}} < /ref > 
 
 Many people believe ''Chlorella'' can serve as a possible source of food and energy. This is because its photosynthesis process can, in theory, reach 8% efficiency. < ref > {{cite book |first=I. |last=Zelitch |title=Photosynthesis, Photorespiration and Plant Productivity |publisher=Academic Press |year=1971 |page=275}} < /ref >  This is even better than that of other highly efficient [[crop]]s such as [[sugar cane]], which are already being used for food and energy. 
 
 In 1961, [[Melvin Calvin]] of the [[University of California]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation using ''Chlorella''. 
 
 Chlorella reproduce asexually by aplanospores. A single chlorellon cell produces at least 16 non-motile aplanospores and each one of them matures into an individual unicellular alga (chlorellon) under favourable conditions. There are no any reports of sexual reproduction in Chlorella.
