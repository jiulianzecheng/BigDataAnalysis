In [[Roman mythology]], '''Quirinus''' was an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, Quirinus was also a name of [[Janus]], as ''Janus Quirinus''. < ref > In the prayer of the [[fetiales]] quoted by [[Livy]] (I.32.10); [[Macrobius]] (''Sat.'' I.9.15); < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 Quirinus was originally most likely a [[Sabine]] god. The Sabines had a settlement near the site of what was to become [[Rome]], and erected an altar to Quirinus on the ''Collis Quirinalis'', the ''Quirinal Hill'', one of the ''Seven Hills of Rome''.  When the Romans settled there, they absorbed the cult of Quirinus into their early belief system — previous to direct Greek influence — and he was said to be the [[Deity|deified]] [[Romulus]].   
 
 In later times, however, Quirinus became far less important, losing his place to ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]' place).
