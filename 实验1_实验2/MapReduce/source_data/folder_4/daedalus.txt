 '''Daedalus''' was [[King Minos]]' head [[architect]] in [[ancient Greece]] and son of [[Athena]].  When [[King Minos]] of [[Crete]] was having some [[sovereignty]] problems, he asked [[Poseidon]], [[Greek god|god]] of the [[sea]], for an offering to [[sacrifice]] to him as a sign as true [[kingship]].  So Poseidon sent a snow-white [[bull]] straight out of the sea foam.  Once the people of Crete saw the bull, they all agreed that it was a sign of true kingship.  However, once King Minos saw the bull, he refused to sacrifice the bull, kept it for himself, and sacrificed another bull to Poseidon, thus angering him.  Poseidon put a [[curse]] on Minos’ wife, making her fall in love with the bull.  She loved it so much that she wanted to [[mate]] with it.  Minos called for the help of Daedalus, who built a wooden bull and put Queen Pasiphae inside it, thus calming her anxiety for mating with the bull.  She soon became [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] with half-man, half-bull (also called the [[Minotaur]]).   
 
 [[King Minos]] was horrified and asked Daedalus to build some kind of [[prison]] to keep the Minotaur from destroying [[Crete]].  So Daedalus built a [[labyrinth]] that was so complicated that the Minotaur could not get out.  Only Daedalus knew the course of the labyrinth.  Minos was afraid that Daedalus would tell the route through the labyrinth, and that he would tell that the Minotaur was the son of Minos' wife, he imprisoned Daedalus and his son [[Icarus]], in a high tower.  Daedalus made some wings that he strapped to his and Icarus’ arms and together they escaped from the tower.  However, Icarus, forgetting his father’s words, flew too close to the sun, and the [[wax]] that held the feathers together melted.  Icarus fell into the ocean and [[drowning|drowned]].  Daedalus landed safely on an [[island]], and in [[grief]], he named the sea that he and [[Icarus]] had flown across the [[Icarian Sea]].
