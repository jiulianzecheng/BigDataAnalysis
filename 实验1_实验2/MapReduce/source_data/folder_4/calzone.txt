 A '''calzone''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]  " stocking "  or  " trouser "  or  " drooping sack "  or  " hanging fold " < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/calzone dictionary.com] < /ref > ) is a [[turnover (food)|turnover]] from [[Italy]]. It is made with [[wikt:ingredient|ingredients]] that are like a [[pizza]], but they are not the same. < ref > [http://wiki.pizzahood.org/index.php?title=Great_Schism]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It is folded into a [[wikt:crescent|crescent]] shape before it is cooked. Calzones are made from pizza dough and filled with [[mozzarella]] and [[ricotta]] cheese. Other things such as [[ham]], [[salami]], [[vegetable]]s or an [[egg (food)|egg]] can used as fillings as well. The dough is folded over, sealed along the edge and then fried. It is usually served with a [[seafood]] sauce, or with [[garlic]], [[parsley]] and [[olive oil]]. 
 
 The [[Pizza Hut]] restaurant sells large calzones known as the P'zone. In America, the [[Hot Pocket]]s brand of [[microwavea]]ble turnovers are called  " Bread Stuffed Calzones " . 
 
 In [[Chicago]], the calzone is usually called a ''pizza puff'', made by Italco Foods.
