 The '''ibises''' (collective plural '''ibis'''; classical plurals '''ibides''' and '''ibes''') are a group of long-legged wading [[bird]]s in the family [[Threskiornithidae]]. This family also includes the [[spoonbill]]s. 
 
 They all have long down curved bills, and usually feed as a group, probing mud for food items, usually [[crustacean]]s. Most species nest in trees, often with [[spoonbill]]s or [[heron]]s. 
 
 The word ibis comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and probably from the [[Ancient Egyptian]]. According to [[Josephus]], [[Moses]] employed ibes against serpents during a desert campaign into Ethiopia in his early life. [[Pliny the Elder]] also recounted,  " The Egyptians invoked ibes against the serpents. " 
 
 ==Ancient Egyptians== 
 
 Ancient Egyptians would make ibises into mummies and offer them to the god [[Thoth]], whom they drew and carved with the head of an ibis.  Egyptologists have found many thousands of ibis mummies in tombs.  In 2019, scientists looked at the [[DNA]] from the ibis mummies and from living ibises around [[Africa]] and came to believe that the ibises that were made into mummies were not caught in the wild.  Instead, ancient Egyptians fed the ibises in large lakes near their temples and caught them when they wanted them. < ref name= " Eureka " > {{cite web|url    = https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/p-aeg110719.php|title  = Ancient Egyptians gathered birds from the wild for sacrifice and mummification |author = [[PLOS]]|publisher    = Eurekalert.org|date   = November 14, 2019}} < /ref >
