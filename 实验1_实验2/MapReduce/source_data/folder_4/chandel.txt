 ==Origin and History== 
 According to S. N. Sen, the Chandels were originally Hinduised Bhars or Gonds or both, who became Kshatriyas on attaining political power. The Gaharwars similarly are associated with the Bhars; the Bundelas and the northern Rathors are offshoots of the Garhawars. The Dharmashastras recognise the possibility of lower castes being elevated to higher castes. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC & pg=PA172|title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization|last=Sen|first=Sailendra Nath|date=1999|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1198-0|language=en|quote=The Chandel Rajputs were originally Hinduised Bhars or Gonds or both, who became Kshatriyas on attaining political power.
