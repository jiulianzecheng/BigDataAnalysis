'''Flannel''' is a soft [[woven]] [[fabric]], of various fineness. It usually does not have a nap, and instead gains its softness through the loosely spun [[yarn]] it is woven from. It is commonly used to make [[clothing]], [[bed sheet]]s, and [[sleepwear]]. 
 
 Flannel was originally made from carded [[wool]]{{Fact|date=May 2008}} or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either [[wool]] and [[cotton]], or wool and [[synthetic fibre]]. 
 
 == Flannelette == 
 
 '''Flannelette''' is a light, [[nap (textile)|napped]] [[cotton]] fabric imitating the texture of flannel. The [[weft]] is generally coarser than the [[warp]]. The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft; scratching it and raising it up. Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on only one or two sides. It comes in many colours, both solid and patterned. < ref name= " 1911EB " > {{cite encyclopedia |year=1911 |title = Flannelette|encyclopedia= Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition}} < /ref > 
 
 == Weave == 
 
 Flannel, flannelette and cotton flannel can be woven in either a [[twill]] weave or [[plain weave]]. The weave is often hidden by [[nap (textile)|napping]] on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then [[bleaching|bleached]], [[dyed]], or otherwise treated, and then napped a second time.
