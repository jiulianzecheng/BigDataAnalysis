 '''''Nigersaurus''''' (meaning  " [[Niger]] reptile " ) is a [[genus]] of ''[[Diplodocus]]''-like [[sauropod]] dinosaur. It lived in the middle of the [[Cretaceous]] period in what is now the Republic of [[Niger]]. Fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976, but it was only named in 1999 after more complete remains were found and described. < ref > Sereno P.C.  ''et al'' 2007. Structural extremes in a Cretaceous dinosaur. PLoS ONE 2 (11): e1230. [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001230] < /ref > 
 
 Its [[skull]] was very different from ''Diplodocus'', suggesting a different feeding method. It had many [[Fenestra (anatomy)|fenestrae]] (openings) and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth. < ref > Wilson J.A.  &  Sereno P.C. 2005. Structure and evolution of a sauropod tooth battery. In Curry Rogers K. and Wilson J.A. ''The Sauropods: evolution and paleobiology''. University of California Press. pp. 157–177. {{ISBN|0-520-24623-3}} < /ref >  They were replaced often: about every 14 days the whole set were replaced together. < ref > Sereno P.C. ''et al'' 1999. Cretaceous sauropods from the Sahara and the uneven rate of skeletal evolution among dinosaurs. ''Science'' '''286''' (5443): 1342–1347. [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/286/5443/1342] < /ref >  The jaws may have had a [[keratin]]ous sheath, something like a wide beak. Its jaws were wider than the skull, and its teeth were placed far to the front. 
 
 ''Nigersaurus'' was {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} long, which is small for a [[sauropod]], and had a short neck. It weighed around 4 tonnes, comparable to a modern [[elephant]]. Its skeleton was filled with air sacs, which lightened the weight. Its limbs were robustly built. 
 
 ''Nigersaurus'' was probably a [[browser]], and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was small, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a [[riparian]] [[habitat]] (near rivers). Its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[angiosperms]]. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other large [[herbivore]]s, as well as large [[theropods]] and [[crocodylomorph]]s.
