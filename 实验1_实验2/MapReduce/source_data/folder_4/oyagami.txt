'''Oyagami '''(祖神) is a Japanese literally meaning  " parent deity. "  It sometimes expresses the belief that kami, or divine beings, care for human beings in the same way that human parents care for their children, similar to how [[God the Father|God the father]] expresses that. This concept can be found in two forms: an abstract idea that has been around since ancient times, and a more codified concept that developed within certain Shinto sects and new religions. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Some Shinto sects believe that the entire world or cosmos is a living entity, full of vitality and productive power that originates from the oyagami, which is the ultimate existence that gives birth to everything. According to this belief, humans are  " offspring of the kami "  and have been given life by them. This doctrine suggests that humans have the potential to become kami themselves, as they are originally made of the same substance as the divine beings. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 In the Tenrikyō new religion, the main deity is called  " Oyagami, "  and the sect's founder is known as  " Oyasama. "  This use of the word  " parent "  before the name of the kami being worshipped is believed to reflect the traditional Japanese understanding of the meaning of divine beings. Overall, the concept of oyagami emphasizes the close relationship between humans and kami and the belief that divine beings care for humans like parents care for their children. < ref name= " :0 "  / >

 The [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Household]] and Uji clans believe in ancestor gods from a long time ago. They are considered the god or person that started the family line. The clan is a group of people who feel like they are family because they have the same ancestor god. This idea used to be very important, but over time it became less important. The clan gods used to be based on family ties, but later became more connected to the land they lived on, and were like other local gods. < ref > " [https://kotobank.jp/word/氏神-34471 International Encyclopedia Britannica],  " Ujigami " , p.  < /ref >
