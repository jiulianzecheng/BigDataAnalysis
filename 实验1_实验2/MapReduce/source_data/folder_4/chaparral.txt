 '''Chaparral''' is a [[shrubland]] or [[heath]]land plant community. It is found mainly in the U.S. state of [[California]]. Also in the northern portion of the [[Baja California peninsula]], [[Mexico]]. It is caused by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and [[wildfire]].  
 
 A chaparral has [[summer]] [[drought]]-tolerant plants. < ref > Nancy Bauer, ''The California Wildlife Habitat Garden'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012), p. 175 < /ref >  They have hard [[sclerophyll]]ous [[evergreen]] leaves. < ref > William Skinner Cooper, ''The Broad-sclerophyll Vegetation of California: An Ecological Study of the Chaparral and its Related Communities'' (Washington, DC: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1922), p. 21 < /ref >  Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California. < ref name= " calacademy.org " > {{cite web |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/california_hotspot/habitat_mediterranean_shrublands.htm |title=Hotspot; California on the Edge |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2005 |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |access-date=10 June 2014 |archive-date=15 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815233612/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/california_hotspot/habitat_mediterranean_shrublands.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Of the associated Mediterranean shrubland, it covers an additional 3.5%. < ref name= " calacademy.org " / >  The name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''chaparro'', referring to scrub oaks. < ref > Peter R.

 There are four other chaparral regions in the world.  
 #parts of the [[Mediterranean]] coast, known as ''maquis'' 
 #Central [[Chile]], known as ''matorral'' 
 #[[South Africa]]n Cape, known as ''fynbos'' 
 #[[South Australia]], known as ''kwongan'' 
 
 Chaparral does not often have [[Wildfire|fires]]. These are usually at [[Time|intervals]] from 10â€“15 years to over a hundred years. Mature chaparral often has [[dense]] [[thicket]]s. They are highly [[Flammability|flammable]].
