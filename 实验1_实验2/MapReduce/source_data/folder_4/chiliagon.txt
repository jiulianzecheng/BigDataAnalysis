 A '''chiliagon''' or '''1000-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 1000 sides and 1000 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular chiliagon == 
 A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] chiliagon'' is represented by [[Schl√§fli symbol]] {1000} and can be constructed as a [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] 500-gon, t{500}, or a twice-truncated 250-gon, tt{250}, or a thrice-truncated 125-gon, ttt{125}. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular chiliagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > A = 250a^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{1000} \simeq 79577.2\,a^2 < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides.
