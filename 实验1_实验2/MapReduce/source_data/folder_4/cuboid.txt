 A '''cuboid''' is a [[3D]] [[shape]]. cuboids have six faces. These faces form a [[convex]] [[polyhedron]]. The faces of the cuboid can be any [[quadrilateral]]. The most common cuboids are the rectangular cuboids. They are made from 6 rectangles that are placed at right angles to each other. A cuboid that uses all [[Square (geometry)|square]] faces is a [[cube]]. The cuboid can also be called a right rectangular prism. 
 
 == Properties == 
 The properties of a cuboid include: 
 * cuboids have 12 edges 
 * They have 8 corners or vertices 
 * They have 6 faces.

 The difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that a rectangle  is a 2D shape and a cuboid is a 3D shape. 
 
 A cube is a cuboid where all six faces have the same [[height]] and [[Width|widths]]. Each face of a cube is a  square.  
 
 Where L= length, w= width and h= height: 
 * Total [[Surface area|Surface Area]] of Cuboid = 2( (L×w) + (w×h) + (h×L) )  
 * [[Volume]] of Cuboid = L * w * h
