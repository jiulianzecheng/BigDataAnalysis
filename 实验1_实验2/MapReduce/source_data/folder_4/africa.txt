 '''Africa''' is the second largest [[continent]] in the world, it has a very big island called Madagascar. It makes up about a fifth of the world's land. < ref name= " Sayre " > {{cite book| last = Sayre| first = April Pulley| title = Africa| url = https://archive.org/details/africasayr00sayr| year = 1999| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| isbn = 978-0-7613-1367-0 }} < /ref >  It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. < ref name=Sayre/ >  It is thought to be the continent where the first [[human]]s [[Human evolution|evolved]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:African-civilizations-map-pre-colonial.svg|thumb|Civilizations before European colonization.]] 
 The [[history]] of Africa begins with the first modern [[humans|human beings]] and continues to its present difficult state as a politically developing [[continent]]. 
 
 Africa's [[Ancient history|ancient historic]] period includes the rise of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian civilization]].  It also includes the development of other [[Society|societies]] outside the [[Nile|Nile River]] [[Valley]], and the interaction between these societies and [[Civilization|civilizations]] outside of Africa. In the late [[7th century]], [[North Africa|North]] and [[East Africa]] were heavily influenced by the spread of [[Islam]]. That led to the appearance of new [[Culture|cultures]], like the [[Swahili people]] and the [[Mali Empire]], whose [[king]], [[Musa Keita]] I, became one of the richest and most influential people of the early [[14th century]]. This also led to an increase in the [[slave trade]], which had a very bad influence on Africa’s development until the [[19th century]]. 
 
 === Slavery === 
 {{further|African slave trade|Arab slave trade}} 
 [[Slavery]] has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world. < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Historical survey  >  Slave societies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=2014-10-06 }}, Encyclopædia Britannica < /ref > < ref > [http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html Swahili Coast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206102932/http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html |date=2007-12-06 }}, National Geographic < /ref >  But two new [[Slave trade|slave trades]] would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery. 
 
 Between the [[7th century|7th]] and [[20th century|20th centuries]], the [[Arab slave trade]] took 18 million slaves from Africa via [[Trans-Saharan trade|trans-Saharan]] routes and the [[Indian Ocean]].

 Africans who had been captured and sent to the [[France|French]] [[colony]] of [[Haiti|Saint Domingue]] on [[Slave ship|slave ships]] played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the [[Haitian Revolution]], which created [[Haiti]], the first country to permanently ban slavery. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Gaffield|first=Julia|date=|title=Haiti was the first nation to permanently ban slavery|language=en-US|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/12/haiti-was-first-nation-permanently-ban-slavery/|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-17|issn=0190-8286|archive-date=2021-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210101164743/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/12/haiti-was-first-nation-permanently-ban-slavery/}} < /ref >  After this revolution, European [[Empire|empires]] began to reduce slave trading and [[abolitionism]] became more popular.

 [[File:Colonial Africa 1914 map.png|thumb|left|200px|Areas of Africa under the control or influence of European nations in 1914 (at the outbreak of [[World War I]]).]] 
 
 === Colonialism === 
 In the late [[19th century]], the European powers [[Military occupation|occupied]] much of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: [[Liberia]] and [[Ethiopia]] (which the Europeans called “[[Abyssinia]] " ). 
 
 [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt  < !-- the fate of Sudan under British rule differed from that of Egypt -- >  was effectively under British administration until 1922. 
 
 === Modern history === 
 African [[independence]] movements had their first success in 1951, when [[Libya]] became the first former [[colony]] to become [[independence|independent]].  Modern African history is full of [[revolution]]s and [[war]]s, as well as the growth of modern African [[Economy|economies]] and [[democracy|democratization]] across the continent. 
 
 A [[civil war]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an [[Estimation|estimated]] 5.5 million people. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8792068/Is-your-mobile-phone-helping-fund-war-in-Congo.html |title=Is your mobile phone helping fund war in Congo? |date=27 September 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Gordon |last=Rayner |access-date=1 April 2018 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018135029/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8792068/Is-your-mobile-phone-helping-fund-war-in-Congo.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 Political associations such as the [[African Union]] offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. 
 
 == Climate == 
 [[File:Vegetation Africa.png|thumb|200px|[[Biome]]s of Africa]] 
 From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north: 
 * Alpine and mediterranean climate 
 * Dry [[sand]]y [[desert]] 
 * [[Cold desert|Cold deserts]] 
 * Fairly dry [[savannah]] ([[grassland]]) 
 * [[Rain forest]] 
 * More grassland 
 * More deserts 
 * [[Table Mountain]] 
 * Temperature excursions 
 
 Running north-east to the south is the [[East Africa]]n [[Great Rift Valley]]. This has mountains, [[volcano]]es, deep [[Rift (geology)|rifts]] and [[valley]]s, rivers and [[lakes]]. 
 
 In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types. 
 
 === Rainfall === 
 [[File:Rain shadow.svg|thumb|200px|The rainshadow concept, but with the wind coming from the west.]] 
 [[File:Africa FebAug.gif|thumb|200px|This picture shows where vegetation is most common in [[February]] and [[August]] (before and after the summer)]] 
 Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the [[Sahara Desert]] and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few [[rivers]] or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An [[oasis]] is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert. 
 
 In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the [[Himalaya]]s and the [[Tibetan Plateau]] block the [[monsoon]] rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the [[Atlas Mountains]] near the north coast 
 of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow. 
 
 These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert. 
 
 Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the [[equator]]. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics: 
 * [[Tropic of Cancer]] 
 * [[Tropic of Capricorn]] 
 
 == Plants and animals == 
 [[File:Libyen-oase1.jpg|thumb|200px|This oasis, in [[Libya]], has lots of plants growing around it.]] 
 Africa has a lot of wildlife. < ref > J.Hofman and S.Colbert 2009. ''The ultimate guide to African mammals''. Libeal House, New Jersey. < /ref > < ref > J.Dorst and P.Dandelot 1983. ''A field guide to the larger mammals of Africa''. Collins, London. < /ref >  There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large [[mammal]]s. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are [[antelope]], [[buffalo]], [[zebra]], [[cheetah]], [[elephant]], [[lion]], [[giraffe]], [[rhinoceros]], [[apes]], [[hyaena]], and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of [[fish]] live in African [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. < ref > N.Myers 1997. The rich diversity of biodiversity issues. (In:''Biodiversity II'', ed. E.O. Wilson ''et al'', National Academy Press. < /ref > 
 
 == Politics == 
 The [[African Union]] (AU) is an [[international organisation]]. It aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan African Parliament]]. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP. 
 
 Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include [[Uganda]], < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.historycentral.com/nationbynation/Uganda/Human.html|title=Uganda Human Rights|website=www.historycentral.com|access-date=2019-01-20|archive-date=2020-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803155559/https://www.historycentral.com/nationbynation/Uganda/Human.html|url-status=live}} < /ref >  [[Sierra Leone]], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/88/sierra-leone|title=Sierra Leone — Global Issues|website=www.globalissues.org|access-date=2011-03-02|archive-date=2019-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320103656/http://www.globalissues.org/article/88/sierra-leone|url-status=live}} < /ref >  [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/genocide-darfur/|title=Genocide in Darfur|first1=Salih|last1=Booker|first2=Ann-Louise|last2=Colgan|date=24 June 2004|publisher=|via=www.thenation.com|access-date=20 January 2019|archive-date=27 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227082305/https://www.thenation.com/article/genocide-darfur/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  [[Zimbabwe]], < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/04/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum|title=African leaders break silence over Mugabe's human rights abuses|first=Andrew|last=Meldrum|newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 January 2006|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com|access-date=20 January 2019|archive-date=6 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506184306/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/04/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum|url-status=live}} < /ref >  and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201102241028.html |title=AllAfrica.com: Côte d'Ivoire: Human Rights Situation Getting Worse, Says UN Report |access-date=2011-03-02 |archive-date=2011-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228131027/http://allafrica.com/stories/201102241028.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  There are 54 UN member states in Africa.
