'''Anions''' are [[atom]]s or radicals (groups of atoms), that have gained [[electron]]s. Since they now have more electrons than [[proton]]s, anions have a [[negative]] charge. For example, [[chloride]] ions Cl- , [[bromide]] Br- , [[iodide]] I-.  These are [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] anions, meaning they have a [[valency]] (combining capacity) with only one ion of [[hydrogen]].  Similarly there are bivalent anions, etc. 
 
 An [[ion]] is an [[atom]] (or group of atoms) with an [[electrical charge]]. Anions are one of the two types of [[ion]]s. The other type is called a [[Cation]], having a positive charge. In many [[crystal]]s the anions are bigger; the little cations fit into the spaces between them. 
 
 Anions are termed so because they are attracted towards the [[anode]] (the positive electrode).  All anions tend to accept a proton H+ thus they are categorised as [[Base (chemistry)|base]]
