'''Politeness''' is the teaching or acting of good manners so as not to offend others. What is thought to be polite may be different or event rude depending on many cultures. 
 
 ==Types== 
 * '''Negative politeness''': Making a request less rude, such as  " If you don't mind... "  or  " If it isn't too much trouble... " 
 *Non-assertive politeness: when a person does not stop from making a comment or pushing their beliefs during a discussion. 
 *Assertive politeness: when a person offers their opinion in a positive way to be assistive and helpful during an interaction. Or 
 * '''Positive politeness''': Seeks to create a positive relationship between people. 
 
 Some cultures seem to prefer one of these kinds of politeness over the other. In this way politeness is culturally bound.
