An '''interface''' or '''shell''' is what the user uses < ref > Interfaces are not only for the end user (average computer user), everybody uses interfaces! < /ref >  on an [[operating system]] to make the computer do tasks, like writing a document, or loading a [[web page]]. There are two types of interfaces, a [[command line interface]] (CLI for short) - where people write commands to make the computer perform tasks, or a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI for short), where people use their [[Computer mouse]] to click on buttons to perform tasks. 
 
 == Command line interface ==

 ''See [[Command line interface]].'' 
 
 Command line interfaces ask the user to type in commands in a [[text-based]] environment, not allowing images, like the screen image to the right. < ref > Computers still could do good graphics at the time. Take old computer games as an example. If the user saw a car, instead of [[ASCII art]], the user would most likely get a car  " drawn "  on the screen. < /ref > 
 
 For example, if the user wanted the computer to say  " Hello World " , he or she would: 
 # have to type in what tells the computer that this is a command (we will use  " say " ) 
 # then have to tell the computer what to  " say "  ( " Hello World "  in [[wikt:quotation marks|quotation marks]]) 
 # then press Enter or Return, giving the command to the computer, which is ''say ''' " '''Hello World''' " ''''', so the computer prints ''Hello World''. 
 
 This is hard to use for most people, mostly because when the user has to do a long command, he or she can miss a letter or two, so the computer shows an error, and he or she has to do it all over again, which can waste hours. 
 == Graphical user interface == 
 ''See [[Graphical user interface]].'' 
 
 Graphical user interfaces are instead made of not only text, but also images. The first computer to do this was the [[Apple Lisa]] (1983). 
 
 The following [[operating system]]s can use graphical user interfaces: 
 * [[Microsoft Windows]] 
 * [[Mac OS X]] 
 * [[Linux]] < ref > Linux is not an [[operating system]], but a [[kernel]] (the core of an operating system). < /ref >  distributions, such as [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] 
 Since the top operating systems (listed above) use graphical user interfaces, they are seen on every computer. Anyone can still use a command line interface on any computer very easily.
