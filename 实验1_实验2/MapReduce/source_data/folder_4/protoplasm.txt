 [[File:Allium-Differenzierung05-DM100x HF ba1.jpg|thumb|right|Plant cells have strong [[Cell wall|walls]], and inside the wall is a [[cell membrane]], then a thin layer of cytoplasm with the [[nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s in it. The cytoplasm is pressed against the cell wall by the very large [[vacuole]]. In this picture the cell nuclei are dark-coloured.]] 
 
 '''Protoplasm''' is an old term, which  means the living [[substance]] that makes up a [[cell]]. It is no longer much used. Biologists prefer to talk about the [[cytoplasm]] and the [[cell nucleus]]. 
 
 In [[plant]] cells, it is surrounded by a [[cell wall]]. In [[animal]] cells, the whole cell is made of protoplasm, surrounded by a [[cell membrane]]. Protoplasm in living beings is made up of about 75{{ndash}}80% [[water]]. However, this is rather misleading because the cytoplasm is full of structures called [[organelles]], which do various tasks. The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] is the largest of these structures; there are many other organelles.   
 
 The word  " protoplasm "  was first used in 1846 by Hugo von Mohl to describe the substance in plant cells, apart from the cell wall, the cell nucleus and the vacuole. After the invention of the [[electron microscope]] it was clear that a living cell is much more complicated than von Mohl knew.
