 '''Alnico''' is an [[alloy]] made up of [[iron]] with [[aluminium]] (Al), [[nickel]] (Ni) and [[cobalt]] (Co). < ref name= " Hellweg " > {{cite book| title = The Insomniac's Dictionary| year = 1986| url = https://archive.org/details/insomniacsdictio0000hell| last = Hellweg, Paul 1986| publisher = Facts On File| isbn = 0-8160-1364-0| pages = [https://archive.org/details/insomniacsdictio0000hell/page/115 115]}} < /ref >  The name  " Alnico "  is an [[acronym]] from Al-Ni-Co. Alnico may also contain [[copper]] and sometimes [[titanium]]. 
 
 Alnico alloys are [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] (a [[mechanism]] by which some materials form permanent [[magnets]]). Alnico alloys also have a high coercivity (they do not easily lose their [[magnetism]]) and are used to make permanent [[magnets]]. Before [[rare-earth magnet]]s were developed in the 1970s, lnico magnets were the strongest type of magnet. The [[development]] of Alnico began in 1931 when T. Mishima in [[Japan]] found that an [[alloy]] of [[iron]], [[nickel]], and  [[aluminium]] had double the coercivity of the best magnets of that time. (the coercivity of Alnico is 400 oersted). < ref > {{cite book | last = Cullity B.D.  &  Graham C.D. 2008 | title = Introduction to Magnetic Materials| date = 30 March 2009| publisher = Wiley-IEEE| pages = 485| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC & pg=PA485| isbn = 978-0471477419}} < /ref > 
 
 == Properties == 
 Alnico [[alloy]]s can be made magnets by strong [[magnetic field]]s. Rare-earth magnets like [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]]-cobalt are the only easily found magnets which are stronger than alnico magnets. Alnico magnets produce very strong [[magnetic field]]s at their poles (a pole is one of the two ends of a magnet) as high as 1500 gauss (0.15 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] which is about 3000 times stronger than earth's magnetic field. 
 
 Some types of alnico magnets are isotropic ([[properties]] are same in all directions) and can be properly magnetised in all directions. Other types like alnico 5 and alnico 8 are anisotropic ([[properties]] change when direction changes) have a preferred direction (one direction would be better than other directions) for magnetisation. Anisotropic alnico alloys will make stronger magnets in their preferred direction than an isotropic alnico alloy. 
 
 Alnico magnets are the only magnets that have useful magnetism even when heated [[red-hot]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/products/alnico/index.htm |title=Arnold-Alnico Magnets |access-date=2011-06-01 |archive-date=2007-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028041735/http://www.arnoldmagnetics.com/products/alnico/index.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite book | last = Hubert, Alex  &  Sch√§ffer, Rudolf 1998 | title = Magnetic domains: the analysis of magnetic microstructures| year = 1998| publisher = Springer| pages = 557| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pBE42lLYs-MC & pg=PA557| isbn = 3540641084}} < /ref >
