 '''Loam''' is [[soil]] made mostly of [[sand]] and [[silt]]:  
 *Sand: [[particle size]]  >  {{convert|63|µm}}  
 *Silt: particle size  >  {{convert|2|µm}} 
 *Clay: small amount: particle size  <  {{convert|2|µm}}  
 
 By weight, it is about 40–40–20% concentration of sand–silt–clay, respectively. < ref name= " KaufmannCleveland "   > {{cite book |last=Kaufmann |first=Robert K. |author2=Cutler J.
