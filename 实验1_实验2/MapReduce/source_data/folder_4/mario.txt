 ==Concept and creation== 
 [[File:Mario emblem.svg|thumb|left|200px|Mario's symbol]] 
 Mario first appeared in the [[arcade game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' as a [[carpenter]] named '''Jumpman'''. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/13/super-mario-bros-how-shigeru-miyamoto-created-mario-for-nintendo.html|title = 'Super Mario Bros.' debuted 35 years ago — here's how Mario accidentally became a gaming superstar|website = [[CNBC]]|date = 13 September 2018}} < /ref > < ref name= " wired " > {{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=18|title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming|publisher=[[Wired News]]|author=Orlando, Greg|accessdate=23 August 2008|date=15 May 2007}} < /ref >  In Japan, he had the name  " Mr. Jump. "  Later, he was named  " Mario, "  after Mario Segale, who was a lot like Mario. [[Mario Segale]] owned the land where [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]'s office was built. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/feature/the-top-10-best-selling-game-franchises/532199-2|title=The Top 10 Best-Selling Game Franchises|publisher=[[Yahoo!

 Mario later appeared with his younger brother [[Luigi]] in an arcade game called ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' The game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was released at the same time as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''Super Mario Bros.'' was a very well liked game, along with ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''  and [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|Legend Of Zelda]]. 
 
 At that time, video games were hard to make and Nintendo could not make Mario move without making his arms  " disappear " . Changing his clothes fixed it. They also did not have the space to give him a mouth or ears. They also could not make hair on his head. To fix this, the makers of the game gave Mario a [[moustache]], [[sideburns]], and a cap so it would not look like he was [[Baldness|bald]]. Mario's creator, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], said that he gave Mario a cap,  because it is hard for him to draw hair. < ref name= " History of Mario " > {{cite web|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-nintendo_shining_star.htm|title=Nintendo's Shining Star: The History of Mario|publisher=Gamecubicle|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref >  His voice is made by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Luigi]], [[Wario]], [[Waluigi]] and other characters like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toadsworth]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=164|title=Charles Martinet Down Under|publisher=[[N-Sider]]|accessdate=12 November 2006|archive-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106230109/http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=164|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Mario is Nintendo's mascot (the face of the company). Mario's [[rival]] was [[Sega]]'s mascot, [[Sonic the Hedgehog]]. Sonic the Hedgehog first appeared in 1991. At first, Sega and Nintendo [[Competition (economics)|competed]] with each other. But then, in ''[[Sonic Adventure 2#Sonic Adventure 2 Battle|Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]], Sega'' made a game for a Nintendo [[video game console]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-nintendo-sega-rivalry.htm|title=A Rivalry Ends: Nintendo and Sega, Mario and Sonic|publisher=Gamecubicle|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref >  Mario and Sonic appeared together in a sports game, ''[[Mario  &  Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', and again in [[Super Smash Bros.

 ==Appearances== 
 Mario has been seen in many games, and is seen in games that are not Mario games, like ''[[Punch-Out!! (video game)|Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]'' where he is a [[referee]]. He is also a character you can play as in the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]]. Mario has  appeared as a secret character which any player can play as in the [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'', which are both from [[Electronic Arts]]. In some games, he only makes very small appearances: in both ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', a picture of Mario can be seen, and in ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]'' small Mario and [[Yoshi]] statues can be seen. 
 
 After the Game  &  Watch game ''Mario Bombs Away'', the first ''Mario'' non-platformer game, ''Dr. Mario'', was sold in 1990. There are two educational ''Mario'' games that have been made. They are called ''[[Mario Paint]]'', which was sold in 1992 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and ''[[Mario Pinball Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]'' was released in 1996 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first ''Mario'' role-playing game. Since then, other Mario role-playing games have been released, such as ''[[Paper Mario]]'' for the Nintendo 64;  and ''[[Mario  &  Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' for the Game Boy Advance. Both of these games were made into their own series later on. 
 
 There have been more series based on the original ''Mario'' series. The ''Mario Kart'' series' first game was ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The ''Mario Kart'' series is the most successful racing video game series of all time. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ownt.com/qtakes/2003/gamestats/gamestats.shtm|title=All Time Top 20 Best Selling Games|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221044930/http://www.ownt.com/qtakes/2003/gamestats/gamestats.shtm|archivedate=21 February 2006|date=23 May 2005|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/072/072580p1.html|title=Japan vs. US Sales|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=30 November 1999|accessdate=23 August 2008|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111203136/https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/01/japan-vs-us-sales|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/topten2.htm|title=Japan Platinum Game Chart|publisher=The Magic Box|accessdate=23 August 2008|archive-date=13 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213230402/http://www.the-magicbox.com/topten2.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/report/fiscal2004.pdf|title=Nintendo of America 2004 Annual Report|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|pages=42|date=31 March 2004|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/807/807852p1.html|title=Nintendo Sales Update|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Casamassina, Matt|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=23 August 2008|archive-date=22 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822032138/http://wii.ign.com/articles/807/807852p1.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The ''Mario Kart'' series is a type of ''Mario'' sports game. There have been other ''Mario'' sports games like ''[[Mario Golf]]'' and ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and the baseball and soccer games ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]''. In 1999, the ''[[Mario Party (series)|Mario Party]]'' series started on the [[Nintendo 64]]. 
 
 There has been a few TV shows and a movie for the ''Mario'' series. The name of the first TV show is ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' and the movie is called ''[[Super Mario Bros. (movie)|Super Mario Bros.]]''. The TV show starred [[Lou Albano| " Captain "  Lou Albano]] as Mario, and the movie starred [[Bob Hoskins]] as Mario. There have also been ''Mario'' toys sold in some places. 
 ==Characteristics== 
 Mario was first a [[2D]] character but since technology has changed, Nintendo has remade Mario in [[3D]]. He is a plumber who lives in the land of [[Mario (series)#Mushroom Kingdom|Mushroom Kingdom]]. He is the older, shorter brother of [[Luigi]], and they are both plumbers. In the television series, Mario and Luigi are from [[Brooklyn]], although ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' says he was born in the Mushroom Kingdom. 
 
 ===Physical appearance=== 
 Mario's looks have changed over the years although he has several [[wikt:staple|staple]] features. He is a short, stubby man wearing a hat with an  " M "  on it, brown hair, black [[moustache]], a very large nose, white gloves, and [[denim]] [[overalls]]. In most appearances, Mario wears a red hat and shirt with blue overalls. However, in the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' video game, Mario wears a brown shirt and red overalls. 
 
 Mario's clothes depend on the game he is in. For example, in the ''[[Super Mario Strikers]]'' [[Association football|soccer]] game, Mario wears a [[kit (association football)|football kit]] instead of overalls, and in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]],'' a very sunshiny tropical game, he wears a red T-shirt and can also put on sunglasses and a Hawaiian-style shirt. In some games, Mario can turn into different forms, each with different clothes. 
 
 ===Personality=== 
 Mario is a kind-hearted and brave hero, with a love of [[pasta]] and [[pizza]]. People know Mario has a great, happy, personality since he has a high pitched, funny voice. Since ''[[Mario's Game Gallery]]'', [[Charles Martinet]] has been his voice actor. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=503|title=Charles Martinet|publisher=[[N-Sider]]|accessdate=23 August 2008|archive-date=15 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115013600/http://www.n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=503|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In the games, Mario speaks in English with a thick Italian [[accent]]. In other things like TV shows, he has a more Brooklyn-styled accent. Mario does not say much. He usually says:  " Okey dokey! " ,  " Woohoo! " ,  " Let's a-go! " ,  " It's-a me! Mario! " ,  " Here we go " ,  " Mama mia! "  and more, though in [[List of Mario games by genre#Sports series|sports]] games, he says things relevant to the sport, in Mario Golf he says  " Fore! "  for example. Mario hardly ever speaks properly in any game, leaving the talking to other characters. He does speak normally in the DiC animated cartoons and the anime series. 
 
 ===Occupation and hobbies=== 
 He only acts like a plumber in the games, ''[[Mario  &  Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', but pipes are always one way to get around. Mario was seen plumbing during the animated series. He knows a lot about tools and fixing pipes in the movie. In the first Donkey Kong games when Mario was called Jumpman, he was a carpenter. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/service/corporate_2001.html|title=Nintendo - Corporate: About Nintendo Worldwide|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2007|accessdate=2 May 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 In the ''[[Dr. Mario (video game)|Dr. Mario]]'' games first seen in 1990, Mario is a doctor. In 2001, Mario appeared in ''[[Dr. Mario 64]]'', an updated version of the original puzzle game. Dr. Mario appeared as an secret character in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and in another newer version, ''Dr. Mario Virus Buster'', for [[WiiWare]]. In the [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Mario's Picross]]'', Mario is an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. 
 
 Mario usually saves [[Princess Peach]] (AKA Princess Toadstool), [[Princess Daisy]] and [[mariowiki:pauline|Pauline]]. And he usually has to defeat villains, like [[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]](AKA King Koopa in Japan) Most characters in the games know who he is because he acts like a hero, as shown in ''[[Mario  &  Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', where they are called  " superstars " , or celebrities. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://marioandluigi.gameboy.com/flash.jsp|title=Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}} < /ref > 
 
 In ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'', it is said that Mario has a toy-making company that earns him money. 
 
 ===Relationships=== 
 Since his first game, Mario has to save the  " [[damsel in distress]] "  of the game. Originally, he had to rescue his girlfriend [[List of Mario series characters#Pauline|Pauline]] in ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel-in-distress, [[Princess Peach]], in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (she was first named  " Princess Toadstool "  or simply  " the Princess "  in English-speaking places until 1993, when ''[[Yoshi's Safari]]'' was sold, even though the name was not widely used until ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' was sold three years later). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.themushroomkingdom.net/games/sm64|title=Super Mario 64|publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref >  Pauline returned in the [[Game Boy]] remake of ''[[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|Donkey Kong]]'' in 1994, and later ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'' in 2006, although the character is now said to be  " Mario's friend " . < ref name= " Mario vs. DK 2 " > {{cite web|url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ds/previews/mario-vs--donkey-kong-2--march-of-the-minis-902997.html|title=Mario vs. DK 2: March of the Minis|publisher=[[Yahoo!

 Mario has rescued Princess Peach lots of times since ''Super Mario Bros.''. In a [[role reversal]], Peach rescues Mario in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]''. Some people say the two could be a couple. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.themushroomkingdom.net/mariopedia/m.shtml#Mario|title=Mariopedia & nbsp;— Mario|publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.themushroomkingdom.net/mariopedia/b.shtml|title=Mariopedia & nbsp;— Bowser|publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Luigi]] is Mario's younger brother. He is usually a companion on many of Mario's adventures and the character whom players play as in two-player sessions of many of the video games. He sometimes acts like a  " scaredy cat "  who sets off to help Mario but instead needs help himself, though he has also had to rescue Mario occasionally as displayed in ''[[Mario is Missing!]]'' and ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]''. [[Yoshi]] is another one of Mario's friends. 
 
 Mario rescued [[Princess Daisy]] in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', the text explaining Princess Daisy's trophy states that  " after her appearance in Mario Golf, some gossips portrayed her as Luigi's answer to Mario's Peach " , < ref > {{cite video game|title=Super Smash Bros. Melee|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=3 December 2001|platform=Nintendo GameCube}} < /ref >  although Luigi and Daisy were previously paired as a romantic couple in the live-action ''[[Super Mario Bros. (movie)|Super Mario Bros]]'' movie. 
 
 [[Wario]], Mario's evil [[counterpart]] was first seen in ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]''. Though there is no clear relationship between the two, Wario was once referred to as Mario's cousin in [[Nintendo Power]]. Wario is designed to act, in a way, as an anti-Mario. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.themushroomkingdom.net/mariopedia/w.shtml#Wario|title=Mariopedia & nbsp;— Wario|publisher=The Mushroom Kingdom|accessdate=23 August 2008}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Baby Mario=== 
 Baby Mario is Mario when he was a child. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', released in 1995 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and has appeared in several titles since. Baby Mario has often appeared in Nintendo-sports titles, such as ''[[Mario Golf]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'', ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash!!]]'', ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', and ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''. These games imply Mario and Baby Mario are separate characters, but those games are considered to be outside the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the main ''Mario'' series. More recently, he has appeared in ''[[Mario  &  Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', in which Baby Mario appeared via time travel along with Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, and Baby Bowser, which could explain the separation of the two characters. Like the older Mario, Baby Mario is also voiced by [[Charles Martinet]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Charles Martinet: Voice Over|url=http://www.charlesmartinet.com/voiceover.html|accessdate=16 March 2008}} and acts similar to his older counterpart. < /ref > 
 
 ==Abilities== 
 During the development of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', Mario was known as  " Jumpman " . Jumping—both to access places and as an offensive move—is a common gameplay element in ''Mario'' games, especially the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' series. 
 
 Mario's most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies, first used in ''[[Mario Bros.]]''. This jump-stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage, and usually deals damage to larger ones, sometimes also causing secondary effects. This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle-like [[Koopa troopa|Koopa Troopas]] into their shells, which can slide into and damage other enemies or Mario. 
 
 Subsequent games have elaborated on Mario's jumping-related abilities. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' added the ability to spin-jump, which allows Mario to break blocks under him. Later, the Game Boy version of ''[[Donkey Kong (handheld game)|Donkey Kong]]'' allows Mario to jump higher with many jumps, and perform a back-flip. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario has several jumping abilities, such as a sideways [[somersault]], a  " ground pound " , which makes Mario hit the ground under him hard, and the  " Wall Kick " , which propels him upwards by kicking off walls. 
 
 ===Power-ups=== 
 Mario uses many items, which give him various powers. The one that shows up the most often is the  " Super Mushroom " , which allows Mario to grow to twice his size, becoming  " Super Mario "  (after the name of the series), and can take a hit before shrinking back down to  " regular "  Mario. If  " Super Mario "  collects a  " Fire Flower " , he will transform into  " Fire Mario " , who can throw fireballs at enemies. Picking up a  " Star "  makes it so nothing can hurt Mario for several seconds. 
 
 A common theme in the ''Mario'' series' power-ups is the fact that many items give Mario a semi-animal appearance, sometimes related to the item itself, for example ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''{{'}}s Frog Suit, which turns Mario into a frog, and ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins|Super Mario Land 2]]''{{'}}s Power Carrot, which turns Mario into a rabbit. Other times the item may not be related to the power; for example, the Raccoon Leaf gives him [[raccoon]] ears, a tail, and the power of flight. Other power-ups are overall more useful; in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the Cape allows Mario to fly and glide, and a balloon in a later game in the series allows similar effects. ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' introduced other types of Mushroom power-ups, such as the  " Mega Mushroom " , which causes Mario to grow to a screen-filling size and the  " Mini Mushroom "  that makes him shrink to a very small size.  The [[Drill Mushroom]] in [[Super Mario Bros. Wonder]] allows the player to dig and dodge enemies go through walls and dig in ceilings to almost fly.  
 
 In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', Mario takes extra damage without when he is not wearing his hat. Different types of caps found in the game also give him powers of flight, invincibility, and [[invisibility]]. Along with these basic features, caps gave more practical abilities as well. For example, the Metal Cap allows Mario to sink to sea floors and the Invisibility cap allows him to walk through thin surfaces such as iron grates. 
 
 ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' has several few power-ups with a water theme. He is granted a F.L.U.D.D. ('''F'''lash '''L'''iquidizing '''U'''ltra '''D'''ousing '''D'''evice) pack that performs his main attack and squirts paint and enemies with water, named the Squirt Nozzle. He has three other expansion packs including the Hover Nozzle, which allows him to hover for short distances, the Turbo Nozzle, which allows him to move a lot faster and break through some barriers, and the Rocket Nozzle, which charges water up, then blasts Mario high into the air. 
 
 ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' introduced several new power-ups along with a few older items re-done. These include the Bee Shroom, which allows him to float short distances and stick to certain surfaces; the Boo Shroom, which makes him capable of floating as well as traveling through walls; the Life Shroom, which gives him three more life wedges; the Rainbow Star, granting him brief invincibility; the Fire Flower, which appeared for the first time in a 3D game; and the Ice Flower, which allows him to turn water into solid ice so he can go to otherwise unreachable or deadly places. A hidden power-up is the Flight Star, which allows Mario to fly for a while. 
 
 Mario uses hammers in numerous games, such as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', the original ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and ''Super Mario RPG''. Hammers are used to attack and for other things, like flicking switches and solving puzzles. He often picks up and throws various projectiles around him, however, starting in ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. He tosses items such as vegetables, giant blocks and [[Bob-omb|Bob-ombs]]. 
 
 In the [[Mario Kart]] series, there are a number of [[items]] to use. For example, a [[mushroom]] makes the characters go faster, and a Koopa shell knocks into other players to slow them down.
