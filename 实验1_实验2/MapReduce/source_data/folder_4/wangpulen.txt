 == Description == 
 In the [[Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Amailon Pukok Puya]], Wangbren is mentioned as '' " Khana Chaopa Wangpulen " ''. According to the text, He is one of the 7 [[Laipungthou]]s and one of the manifestations of the Supreme God, [[Atingkok|Ipung Loinapa Apakpa]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461915/page/n63/mode/2up?q=Wangbren+wakoklon+hilel+thilel+salai+amailon+pukok+puya+khana+chaopa+wangpulon+seven+laipungthous+supreme+ipung+loinapa+apakpa|title=A Critical Study Of The Religious Philosophy|last=Singh|first=L.

 == Mythology == 
 Once God Wangbren went to the village of the [[Anāl Naga|Anal people]], disguising Himself as a human. He fell in love with a beautiful girl, Shagnu. The maiden was also attracted to His good looks. The girl's affair with a stranger angered the community. The young men of the village challenged Wangbren to fight. There were competitions in [[race]], stone throw and [[archery]]. If He failed, He would be killed. But He won all the challenges. As He won, He took Shangnu, the maiden away with Him to His divine abode. < ref name= " e-pao.net " / > < ref name= " pothashang.in " / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.language.1358/page/n185/mode/2up?q=Wangbrel|title=Folktales of Manipur|website=archive.org|year=2014 |pages=185}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.language.1358/page/n187/mode/2up?q=Wangbrel|title=Folktales of Manipur|website=archive.org|year=2014 |pages=187}} < /ref > 
 
 == Worship ==
