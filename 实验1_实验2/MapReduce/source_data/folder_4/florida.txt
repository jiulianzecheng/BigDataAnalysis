 '''Florida''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ɒr|ɪ|d|ə|audio=en-us-Florida.ogg}}), officially the '''State of Florida''', is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the southeast part of the [[United States]]. It is the 22nd largest US state by [[total area]] with 65,757.70 sq mi (170,312 km < sup > 2 < /sup > ) and the third most-populous with a 2020 [[population]] of more than 21 million. It is a [[peninsula]], which means that water surrounds the state on three of four possible sides. To the west is the [[Gulf of Mexico]], to the south is the [[Florida Straits]], and to the east is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The highest elevation in Florida is [[Britton Hill]]. Many Cubans, Haitians and other Caribbeans live in state. 
 
 In 2018, The top countries of origin for Florida’s immigrants were [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Jamaica]]. < ref > [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/immigrants-florida Immigrants in Florida] < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 {{main|History of Florida}} 
 
 [[Native American]]s first settled in Florida before the arrival of the Europeans. Florida had many residents from many tribes and nations living in almost all parts of it for thousands of years. These include the Timucua, the Tequesta, the Calusa, the Seminole, the Miccosukee, and many more. Florida was first discovered by a European in 1513 by the Spanish [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce De Leon]], who called this peninsula  " Tierra de la Pascua Florida "  (Land of the Easter flowered) because it was discovered on [[Easter]]: in the next centuries only the last word remained. < ref > [https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/ponce-de-león-lands-florida Ponce De Leon life] < /ref > 
 
 Northern Florida contains [[hill]]s because it is at the very end of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The highest hill in Florida is Britton Hill, in northern [[Walton County]] near the town of [[Lakewood, Florida]]. It is {{convert|345|ft}} above [[sea level]]. It is the shortest of the highest points in all other states. < ref name= " Britton " > {{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/UW268 |title=The Florida Environment: An Overview |date=July 2007 |last1=Main |first1=Martin B. |last2=Allen |first2=Ginger M. |publisher=[[University of Florida]], [[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]] |accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uNhCpOjH?url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw268 |archivedate=2010-11-20 |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 Florida has the longest [[coastline]] in the continental United States.The [[Gulf Stream]] [[ocean current]] goes through the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the east coast of Florida, so the water is warmer than the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is on the west coast of Florida. 
 
 In the center of southern Florida is a [[lake]] called [[Lake Okeechobee]]. It is the seventh largest [[freshwater]] lake in the United States  < ref > Muller, Peter O.  " Lake Okeechobee. "  World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. 12 Jan. 2008  < http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar309640 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608191400/http://www.worldbookonline.com/wb/Article?id=ar309640 |date=2011-06-08 }} > < /ref >  and the second largest freshwater lake entirely within the lower 48 states. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/virtual_tour/lakeokee/index.html|title=SOFIA Virtual Tour - Lake Okeechobee|website=archive.usgs.gov|access-date=2019-01-20|archive-date=2019-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203151205/https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/sofia.usgs.gov/virtual_tour/lakeokee/index.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   Okeechobee is 730 square miles (1,890 & nbsp;km²), about half the size of the state of [[Rhode Island]], and is very shallow for a lake of its size, with an average depth of only 9 & nbsp;feet (3 & nbsp;m). 
 
 A lot of south Florida used to be covered by a [[swamp]] called the [[Everglades]]. When Florida was first being settled, [[farmer]]s found out the [[soil]] there was fertile, so they drained some of the wetlands in 1882 for farming. In 1947, the state constructed [[levee]]s and [[canal]]s to make more room for farming and houses. The Everglades is now about half the size it used to be. < ref > {{cite web

 }} < /ref >  Most of what is left is now the [[Everglades National Park]]. Lots of animals live there, including [[alligator]]s and [[puma|Florida panther]]s. Recently, Florida has been trying to restore the Everglades. 
 
 At the southernmost tip of Florida is a chain of [[island]]s called the [[Florida Keys]]. There are 4500 islands in the Keys. The most famous one is [[Key West]]. 
 
 == Weather == 
 [[File:BahiaHonda.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Bahia Honda beach in south Florida]][[File:Jacksonville Snow 2.jpg|thumb|[[Snow]] is very uncommon in Florida, but has fallen in every major Florida city at least once. Snow does fall sometimes in North Florida.]] 
 Florida is nicknamed the Sunshine State. During the summer, temperatures may rise up to as high as 109 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (or 40.5 degrees [[Celsius]]). Its annual average temperature is much warmer than many of the other states, but during winter, temperatures occasionally fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In Florida, a dozen [[palm tree]] species are native to the state. Florida has both a rainy season and dry season. Southern Florida does not have four separate seasons. < ref > {{cite book| last = Stewart| first = Melissa| title = Life in a Wetland| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_WbzyhcWLHoC & pg=PA11| year = 2003| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| isbn = 978-0-8225-4687-0| page = 11 }} < /ref > 
 
 Florida's sunny climate attracts visitors. The summer is great for [[surfing]] the waves and enjoying the beaches. The most popular sport in Florida is [[fishing]]. 
 
 Florida is vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s due to its proximity to the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30, but sometimes a hurricane will occur outside of this period. [[Hurricane Andrew]] was a destructive hurricane that hit Florida on August 23, 1992. Florida's most active recorded hurricane seasons were in [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], when it was hit by hurricanes [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]] (August 13), [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]] (September 4–5), [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] (September 16), [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] (September 25), [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] (August 25), and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] (October 24).

 * [[Invertebrate]]s: [[carpenter ant]]s, [[termites]], and [[cockroach|American cockroach]]. 
 
 In the 1930s, the [[fire ant|Red imported fire ants]] were accidentally brought from [[South America]] to [[North America]]. Since then, they have spread to most of the [[Southern United States]], including Florida. They are more [[aggressive]] than most native ant species and have a painful [[sting]]. < ref name= " Not all alien invaders are from outer space " > {{cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/invasive/4fireant.html |title=Not all alien invaders are from outer space |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |accessdate=2007-12-03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uNhOujmD?url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/invasive/4fireant.html |archivedate=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 A lot of non-native [[snake]]s have been released in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for [[Python bivittatus|Burmese]], [[Python molurus|Indian]] and [[African rock python|African rock]] [[python]]s, [[green anaconda]]s, and Nile [[monitor lizard]]s. < ref name= " State creates season for hunting pythons " > {{cite news|title=State creates season for hunting pythons|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100222/BREAKINGNEWS/100222008/Officials-set-new-python-hunting-season| work=|publisher=Florida Today|location=Melbourne, Florida|pages= 6B|date=23 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224102357/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100222/BREAKINGNEWS/100222008/Officials-set-new-python-hunting-season|archivedate=24 February 2010}} < /ref >
