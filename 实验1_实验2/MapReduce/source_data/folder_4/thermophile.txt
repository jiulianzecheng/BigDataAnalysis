 A '''thermophile''' is an organism – a type of [[extremophile]] – that thrives at relatively high temperatures.

 Thermophiles are found in various [[geothermal energy|geothermally]] heated parts of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Examples are [[hot spring]]s like those in [[Yellowstone National Park]] and deep sea [[hydrothermal vent]]s. Also decaying plant matter, such as [[peat]] [[bog]]s and [[compost]], makes higher temperatures.
