 A '''clown''' is a kind of [[entertainer]], or [[performing arts|performance artist]], who performs physical [[comedy]] and [[stunt]]s to amuse others. They usually wear [[grease paint]] [[makeup]] that hides their real face, a large [[wig]] with brightly-colored hair, and baggy, padded [[clothing]]. 
 
 Many clowns belong to a [[circus]], while others [[freelance]] or have a [[talent agent]] who helps them find work. Some clowns study at a '''clown college''' or '''clown school''', where they learn [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]] and other physical skills, and ways to [[:wikt:interact|interact]] with an audience. Others learn from experienced clowns, or through study and practice.

 Clowns are sometimes mentioned in other forms of [[entertainment]]. ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is an [[opera]] by [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]], about clowns. This theme was borrowed by [[Smokey Robinson]], when he wrote  " The Tears of a Clown "  working with [[Stevie Wonder]]. [[Red Skelton]] was a popular entertainer, who performed clown routines on television. 
 
 [[Ronald McDonald]] is a clown character who is the [[mascot]] of [[McDonald's]] restaurants. (Jeff Giuliano, who performed Ronald for many years on television, later became a [[vegetarian]].) 
 
 In many different media, clowns are often [[Villain|villains]] due to the possibility of them being creepy. Examples are [[It (character)|Pennywise]] from [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] [[It (novel)|It]] and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] from the [[Batman]] universe.
