 '''Liemers''' or '''De Liemers''' (historically also known as ''Lijmers'') is a region in the province of [[Gelderland]], the [[Netherlands]]. 
 
 It lies in the very east of the country, near [[Germany]]. It is bordered by three rivers, namely southwest the [[Rhine]], northwest the [[IJssel]], northeast the [[Oude IJssel]], and the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in the southeast. The northern and especially the eastern boundaries are rather vague. There is a grey area with the [[Achterhoek]] region, which stretches itself from these borders of the Liemers region. The hills of Montferland or Bergherbos in the municipality of [[Montferland]] are also considered as the eastern border. 
 
 The local dialect is called [[Liemers (dialect)|Liemers]], which belongs to the [[Low Franconian]] languages.
