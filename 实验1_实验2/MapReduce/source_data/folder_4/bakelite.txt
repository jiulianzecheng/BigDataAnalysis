 '''Bakelite''', or '''polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride''', is an early [[plastic]].

It was made in 1907 by [[Belgium|Belgian]] chemist [[Leo Baekeland]]. 
 
 Bakelite was used for its electrically [[nonconductor|nonconductivity]] and heat-resistant properties in [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulators]], radio and telephone casings.  It was also in products as [[kitchenware]], [[jewelry]], pipe stems, and children's [[toy]]s.
