 {{Nihongo|'''''Himorogi'''''|神籬||{{lit.}}  " divine fence " }} are sacred spaces in [[Shinto]] used for worship.  
 
 Himorogi are enclosed with [[shimenawa]] ropes suspended from poles. < ref name= " sugi "  / >  There are usually four poles in a square shape. < ref name= " sugi "  / >  The poles are normally made from green bamboo or ''[[sakaki]]. < ref name= " sugi "  / > ''  
 
 At the center of the himorogi is a branch of sakaki or some other type of evergreen, which represents the physical presence of the kami - a divine being that is incorporeal. It is a [[yorishiro]]. The himorogi is a simple yet important structure in Shinto worship. < ref name= " sugi " > {{Cite web|date=2007-09-30|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto - Home : Shrine Architecture : Himorogi|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=247|access-date=2023-04-17|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2007-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184429/http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=247|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > < ref > Kōjien, 神籬 < /ref >

 The Aoi Festival in Kyoto features a more elaborate version of the himorogi, which is a square area enclosed by green branches and features an evergreen tree at the center as a yorishiro. Another variation of the himorogi involves using a straw mat on the ground and placing a ceremonial 8-legged stand, called an hassoku-an, on top of it. The hassoku-an is adorned with shimenawa and other sacred emblems.. < ref name= " sugi "  / > 
 
 The origin of the word  " himorogi "  is uncertain, but it is found in ancient Japanese texts such as the Nihon Shoki and the [[Man'yōshū]]. < ref name= " sugi "  / >  In Shinto, the term  " himorogi "  is used to describe both the sacred space and the tree at the center of the space. Both the tree and the space are considered to be pure and sacred. < ref > Bocking, Brian. (1997). ''A Popular Dictionary of Shinto.'' p. 41. < /ref > 
 
 In Japan, at construction sites, people often build a Himorogi. It is a sacred space where a Shinto priest comes to bless the site before work begins. The Himorogi is usually left standing for some time after the ceremony. This is a part of a traditional ground-breaking ritual called {{Nihongo|''[[jichinsai]]''|地鎮祭}}.
