 '''FreeCell''' is a [[Solitaire]] game that is played with a standard 52-card of [[playing cards]]. FreeCell is different from other solitaire games in the sense that all [[cards]] are face-up from the beginning of the game, which makes the outcome of the game depend more on skills than luck. 
 
 To win the game, a player has to stack all cards onto [[four]] foundations, sorted by a cards suit and [[number]], starting from the ace and ending with the king. < ref name=freecell_rules > {{Cite web
