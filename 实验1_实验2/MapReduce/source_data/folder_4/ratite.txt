 The '''ratites''' are a group of medium to large birds, most of which are flightless. Most of them, including the largest ([[moa]]s and [[elephant bird]]s) are now [[extinct]].  
 
 Unlike other [[flightless birds]], the ratites have no keel on their [[sternum]]. In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles.  
 
 Most parts of the former super-[[continent]] [[Gondwana]] have ratites, < ref > Gondwana included the [[southern hemisphere]] continents plus [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Arabia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. < /ref >  or did have until the fairly recent past. Their closest living relatives are the [[tinamou]]s of [[South America]]. < ref name=Haddrath > {{cite journal

 The classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes, but not the tinamous. This may change in future. 
 
 == Evolution and systematics == 
 [[File:Kiwi, ostrich, Dinornis.jpg|thumb|Comparison of a [[kiwi]], [[ostrich]], and ''[[Dinornis]]'', each with its egg]]  
 It was once thought that ratites were all one [[monophyletic]] group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus [[Africa]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. 
 
 However, modern [[Sequence analysis|gene analysis]] conflicts with this. [[DNA]] analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that [[Rhea (bird)|rheas]] (South America) and the living [[Australasia]]n/[[Oceania]]n ratites ''are'' monophyletic.  
 
 Recent analysis of twenty [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] genes suggests that the flighted [[tinamou]]s cluster within the ratite lineage. The timamids are the sister group of the Australo-Pacific ratites. < ref name =Harshman > {{cite journal

 If so, this would make 'ratites', as a whole, [[paraphyletic]] rather than monophyletic. < ref name=Harshman/ > < ref > {{cite journal

 == Simple summary == 
 Tinamous are ratites. Therefore, ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of whom are flightless, with the exception of the tinamous. The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once. The similarities between [[ostrich]]es and the Australo-Pacific ratites is due to [[convergent evolution]].
