 The '''Archaeoceti''' ('ancient whales'), or '''Zeuglodontes''' in older literature, is a group of primitive [[cetacea]]ns. They lived from the early [[Eocene]] to the late [[Oligocene]], 55{{ndash}}23 million years ago (mya). < ref name= " Paleodb-Archaeoceti " > {{Cite web

So they are the ancestors of both modern cetacean suborders, [[Mysticeti]] and [[Odontoceti]]. < ref name= " Thewissen-2002 " > Thewissen J.G M.  &  Williams E.M. 2002.

 The group evolved in the shallow waters that separated [[India]] and [[Asia]] 55–45 mya. About 30 species have been found which were [[adapted]] to a fully oceanic life. Modern characters such as [[echolocation]] and [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]] evolved later, in a second radiation {{Mya|36|35|mya}}. < ref > Fordyce, Ewan 2002. Cetacean evolution.

 All archaeocetes from 55 to 48 mya are only from Indo-Pakistan. By 41–34 mya [[genera]] are known from across the Earth, including [[North America]], [[Egypt]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Europe]]. They were very unlikely to be as well-adapted to the open ocean as living cetaceans, so they probably got to North America along [[coastal]] waters. They could have gone around Africa and over to South America. More likely, over the [[Tethys Sea]] (between Eurasia and Africa) and along the coasts of Europe, [[Greenland]], and North America. < ref > Geisler, J.H; Sanders A.E.  &  Luo, Zhe-Xi 2005.

 The group is a [[paraphyletic]] because it gave rise to the two separate modern suborders.
