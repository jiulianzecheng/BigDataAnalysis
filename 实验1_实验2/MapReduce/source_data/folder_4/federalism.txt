'''Federalism''' is a [[politics|political]] [[philosophy]] in which a group of people are bound together, with a governing head. In a [[federation]], the [[authority]] is divided between the head (for example the national government of a country) and the political units governed by it (for example the [[state]]s or [[province]]s of the country). 
 
 Several countries in the world have a federal government; examples are [[United States of America]], [[Canada]], [[Nigeria]], [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. The [[European Union]] can be called a sort of federal government as well. 
 
 In the [[United States Constitution]] for example, the federal government and [[U.S. state|state]] governments both have power. When states and the federal government do not agree on something, the federal government can [[Lawsuit|sue]] the state in [[court]] using the [[Supremacy Clause]] in [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the Constitution. This case can go as far as the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] to decide which side is right. < ref name=how > {{Cite web|date=2012-12-10|title=What happens when a state law contradicts a U.S. federal law?|url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/state-law-contradicts-federal-law.htm|access-date=2022-05-03|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en}} < /ref >  The federal government does not always do this.
