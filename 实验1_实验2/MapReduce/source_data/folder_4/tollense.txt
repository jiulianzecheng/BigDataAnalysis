 The '''Tollense''' ({{IPA2|tɔˈlɛnzə}}) is a [[river]] in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] in northeastern [[Germany]], right [[tributary]] of the [[Peene]]. The river starts as the outflow of the lake [[Tollensesee]] in [[Neubrandenburg]]. The Tollense is {{convert|68|km|mi|lk=on|abbr=on}} long and empties into the river [[Peene]] in [[Demmin]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 According to several reports in the German media, < ref > [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,650639,00.html Massacre at the Tollense, Spiegel Online (German)] < /ref >  several human remains of the bronze period have been found in the region named Tollense valley ({{lang-de|Tollensetal}}) since 1997. 
 
 Many showed signs of injury and violent death. In 2008 research was concentrated on an area of {{convert|2|km2|sqmi}}. Hundreds of bone fragments, as well as wooden weaponry and flintstone arrowheads have been discovered. The finds were possible due to the preservation of the former swamp ground and the fact that the Tollense has never really changed its flow. 
 
 It is now estimated that about 200 people died in a battle-like scenario in that valley about 1250 BC. Since the population then was about 5 people per [[square kilometre]], about 13 people per [[square mile]], this would've been the most important battle in [[Bronze Age]] Germany yet to be discovered. More investigation of the grounds is planned for the years 2010 to 2015.
