 The '''Hemichordata''' is a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of worm-shaped  [[Ocean|marine]] [[deuterostome]] [[animal]]s, generally considered the sister group of the [[echinoderm]]s. They date back to the Lower or Middle [[Cambrian]] and include an important class of [[fossil]]s called '''graptolites''', most of which became extinct in the [[Carboniferous]]. < ref > Cameron C.B; Swalla B.J. and Garey J.R. 2000.

 Living hemichordates are a phylum with two living classes: the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs. Since the hemichordates are the closest living relatives  to the [[chordate]]s, they are of great interest to those studying the origins of chordate development.   
 
 ==Structure== 
 The bodies of Hemichordates are divided into three parts, [[proboscis]], collar and trunk. They have open [[circulatory system]]s and a complete [[digestive tract]] but the musculature in their gut is very poorly developed, and food is mostly transported through it by using the [[Cilium|cilia]] that cover its inside surface. 
 
 A hollow [[neural tube]] exists among some species (at least in early life), probably a primitive trait they share with the common ancestor of [[chordata]] and the rest of the deuterostomes. 
 
 ==Development== 
 Hemichordates are known to develop in two ways: either directly or indirectly. < ref > Lowe C. ''et al'' 2004. Hemichordate embryos: procurement, culture and basic methods.  ''Methods in Cell Biology'' '''74''': 171-94.  < /ref >  The enteropneusts have both types of development. The indirect development has a long [[pelagic]] [[larva]]l stage. These species have a larval stage which feeds on [[plankton]] before turning into an adult worm. < ref > Tagawa K. ''et al'' 1998. The spawning and early development of the Hawaiian Acorn worm (Hemichordate), ''Ptycodhera flava''. ''Zoological Science'' '''15''': 85-91. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18429670?dopt=Abstract] < /ref >  Those species which develop directly bypass this prolonged larval stage and develop straight into an adult worm. 
 
 == Graptolites ==

 Graptolites are common [[fossil]]s from the [[Palaeozoic]]. They are [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] [[animal]]s known chiefly from the Upper [[Cambrian]] to the Lower [[Carboniferous]] ([[Mississippian]]).  A possible early graptolite, ''Chaunograptus'', is known from the Middle Cambrian.  
 
 The name graptolite comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''graptos'', meaning 'written', and ''lithos'', meaning 'rock'. Many graptolite fossils resemble [[hieroglyph]]s written on the rock. [[Linnaeus]] originally regarded them as  " pictures resembling fossils rather than true fossils " . More recent work places them near the '''pterobranchs''', possibly within. < ref name=Fortey > {{cite book |author=Fortey, Richard A. |title=Life: a natural history of the first four billion years of life on earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifenaturalhisto00fort |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |year=1998 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/lifenaturalhisto00fort/page/129 129] |isbn=0-375-40119-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} < /ref > 
   
 === Graptolite morphology === 
 Each graptolite colony is known as a '''rhabdosome''' and has a variable number of branches (called ''stipes'') coming from an initial individual. Each subsequent [[zooid]] is housed within a tubular or cup-like structure (called a [[theca]]). In some colonies, there are two sizes of theca, and it has been suggested that this difference is due to [[sexual dimorphism]]. 
 The number of branches and the arrangement of the thecae are important features in the identification of graptolite fossils. Their general shape has been compared with that of a hacksaw blade. 
 
 Most of the tree-like forms are classified as dendroid graptolites (order Dendroidea). They appear earlier in the fossil record (in the Cambrian), and were [[benthos|benthic]] animals attached to the sea-floor by a root-like base. Graptolites with relatively few branches were derived from the dendroid graptolites at the beginning of the [[Ordovician]] period. This latter type (order Graptoloidea) were pelagic, drifting freely on the surface of ancient seas or attached to floating [[seaweed]] by means of a slender thread. They were a successful and prolific group, being the most important animal members of the plankton until they died out in the early part of the [[Devonian]] period. The dendroid graptolites survived until the Carboniferous period. 
 
 == Acorn worms == 
 The '''Acorn worms''' or '''Enteropneusta''' are a Hemichordate class of [[invertebrate]]s, closely related to the chordates. < ref > ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment 2016. Sea worm fossil gives clues to 'common ancestor'. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36724562] [http://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-016-0271-4] < /ref >  There are about 70 species of acorn worm in the world, the main species for research being ''Saccoglossus kowalevskii''. 
 
 All species are benthic, and either deposit feeders or suspension feeders. Some of these worms may grow to be very long; one particular species may reach a length of 2.5 meters (almost eight feet), although most acorn worms are much smaller. One genus, ''Balanoglossus'', is also known as the tongue [[worm]]. 
 
 ==Pterobranchs == 
 '''Pterobranchia''' is a [[clade]] of small, worm-shaped animals. They belong to the Hemichordata, and live in [[secretion|secreted]] tubes on the [[ocean floor]]. Pterobranchia feed by filtering [[plankton]]  out of the water with the help of [[cilia]] attached to [[tentacle]]s. There are about 30 known living [[species]] in the group. 
 
 The class Pterobranchia was established by [[E. Ray Lankester]] in 1877. It contained, at that time, the single [[genus]] ''Rhabdopleura''. The publication of the Challenger Report (''Cephalodiscus'') in 1887, showed that ''Cephalodiscus'', the second genus now included in the [[Order (biology)|order]], had affinities in the direction of the Enteropneusta. 
 
 Studies under an [[electron microscope]] have suggested that pterobranchs belong to the same clade as the [[Extinction|extinct]] graptolites. < ref name=Fortey/ >
