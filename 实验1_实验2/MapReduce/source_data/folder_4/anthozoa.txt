 '''Anthozoa''' are a [[Class (biology)|class]] in the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. It includes the [[sea anemone]]s and the [[coral]]s. It is a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]], one of two in the Cnidaria. The other is the [[Medusozoa]]. < ref name=Daly > Daly M. ''et al'' 2007. The phylum Cnidaria: a review of phylogenetic patterns and diversity 300 years after Linnaeus. ''Zootaxa'', '''1668''': 127–182, Wellington.   [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p182.pdf Abstract - PDF] < /ref > 
 
 The class does not have a [[Medusa (animal)|medusa]] [[larva]]l stage in its development, unlike the rest of the phylum. Like all Cnidaria, their food-catching and defense are done by [[nematocyst]]s, which are extremely effective [[sting]]ing cells. Over 6,100 species have been described. < ref > {{cite book| author=Crowther A.L. |chapter=Class Anthozoa Ehrenberg, 1834 |editor=Z.-Q.

 There are three subclasses: 
 
 *[[Ceriantharia]]: the tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids 
 *[[Hexacorallia]]: 4,300 species of [[colony (biology)|colonial]] [[polyp]]s, usually with 6-fold [[symmetry]]. This includes all of the [[stony coral]]s, which are vital for [[coral reef]] formation, and all [[sea anemone]]s, and zoanthids.  
 *[[Octocorallia]]: 3,000 species of colonial polyps with 8-fold symmetry. < ref name=Daly/ >  It includes the [[blue coral]], [[soft coral]]s, [[sea pen]]s, and [[gorgonian]]s ([[sea fan]]s and [[sea whip]]s).
