'''Chiropractic''' is a form of [[alternative medicine]]. A '''chiropractor''' is a person who went to [[school]] to learn chiropractic. Chiropractors may [[diagnose]] and treat many [[condition]]s relating to [[muscle]]s, [[joint]]s, and [[nerve]]s of the [[body]]. They may give what is called an  " adjustment "  to the body. An adjustment is a fast short push to an area of the [[patient]]'s [[spine]] or other joints to help their condition. Chiropractors do not use [[drug]]s to treat patients. They use [[nature|natural]] [[treatment]]s such as [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[physical therapy]], adjustments, and [[massage]] in order to help their patients. 
 
 Chiropractic has changed since it was created over 100 years ago because chiropractors learn new [[fact]]s and do new [[research]]. Chiropractors have many different ways to treat their patients. They all use drug free treatments. Chiropractic is best known for helping people with spine [[pain]], but chiropractors can also help other problems. There has been a debate as to whether or not chiropractic is classified as [[Pseudoscience]].
