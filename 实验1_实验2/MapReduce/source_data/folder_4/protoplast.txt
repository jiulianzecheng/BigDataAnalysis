 '''Protoplast''' in modern [[biology]], is what is left of a cell when the cell wall is dissolved. That leaves the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and the surrounding [[protoplasm]]ic materials. 
 
 Definition: a protoplast is a [[plant]], [[bacterium|bacteria]]l or [[fungus|fungal]] cell that had its [[cell wall]] completely or partially removed using either mechanical or [[enzyme|enzymatic]] means. 
 
 Because cell walls are made differently in the different [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]], different enzymes are used to remove them. 
 
 ==Enzymes for the preparation of protoplasts== 
 Cell walls are made of a variety of [[polysaccharide]]s.  Protoplasts can be made by degrading cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading [[enzyme]]s: 
 {| border= " 1 "  cellpadding= " 2 " 
 !Type of cell 
 !Enzyme 
 |- 
 | [[Plant cell]]s 
 |[[Cellulase]], [[pectinase]], [[xylanase]] 
 |- 
 | [[Gram-positive]] bacteria  
 | [[Lysozyme]] (+[[EDTA]]) 
 |- 
 | [[Fungus|Fungal]] cells 
 | [[Chitinase]] 
 |} 
 
 The reason for removing the cell walls is to allow many different experimental techniques to be used. 
 
 Protoplasts are widely used for [[DNA]] [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] (for making [[genetically modified organism]]s), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell. < ref > {{cite journal |authors=Davey M.R.
