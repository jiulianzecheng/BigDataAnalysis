 A '''residential garage''' is a garage that is part of a [[house]] or similar building. Some garages are directly connected (called  " attached " ) to the house, while others are separate and called a  " detached "  garage " . The garage will have a large garage door that opens to let cars in and out, which is often opened by a motor. 
 
 ==Parking garage==

 A parking garage is a large covered structure, often made of [[concrete]], which is used for holding many cars. Parking garages may have more than one level. 
 
 ==Automobile repair shop== 
 An [[automobile repair shop]] may also be called a garage, although it is for repairing cars rather than just storing them.
