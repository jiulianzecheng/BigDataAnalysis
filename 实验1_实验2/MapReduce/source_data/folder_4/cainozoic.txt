 The '''Cainozoic''' ('''Cenozoic''') is the current [[geology|geological]] [[era]]. It began 66 [[million]] years ago and continues today. Before it was the [[Mesozoic]]. 
 
 During the Cainozoic the continents moved into their present positions. The climate started warm, but cooling continued steadily. Finally [[ice age]]s occurred.  
 
 The word Cainozoic is derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''kainos'' =  " new " , and ''zoe'' =  " life " . 'Cainozoic' may be spelled 'Cenozoic'. It has three [[Period (geology)|periods]], and the periods are split into [[Stage (geology)|stages]].  
 
 * Cainozoic  
 ** [[Palaeogene]] 
 **: [[Palaeocene]] 
 **: [[Eocene]]

 ** [[Neogene]]

 Previously, what is now the Cainozoic was divided into two periods, the [[Tertiary]] and the [[Quaternary]]. The Tertiary corresponded to the [[Palaeogene]]+[[Neogene]]. Now, the term 'Tertiary' is not used. Officially, it is 'deprecated'.

 On land, the Cainozoic is the era of [[mammal]]s, and of [[bird]]s and [[flowering plant]]s. [[Grass]]land became a major [[habitat]]. Aquatic mammals took over the roles of predatory reptiles like the [[mosasaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s. As a result, the [[ecology|ecological]] landscape of the Cainozoic has become quite different from the Mesozoic. < ref > Levin, Harold L. 2005. ''The Earth through time''. 8th ed, Wiley, N.Y.
