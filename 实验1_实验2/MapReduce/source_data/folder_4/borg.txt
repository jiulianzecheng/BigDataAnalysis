The '''Borg''' are a [[fiction]]al race of organic [[cyborg]]s in the [[Star Trek]] [[universe]] which have formed over thousands of years. The Borg use [[nanoprobes]] to [[assimilate]] others, like [[humans]] or [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|vulcans]], into their group consciousness. The only exception to assimilation are races either too primitive to assimilate (who are ignored) or races too dangerous to assimilate (who are destroyed). The Borg's group consciousness is led by the Borg queen, who's role is similar to that of a [[queen bee]] in a [[bee hive]]. 
 ==Defeating the Borg== 
 Despite their ability to adapt to various attempts to destroy them, the Borg can be defeated several ways: < br > 
 #Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] linked with the assimilated  " Loctus of Borg "  ([[Jean-Luc Picard]]) and sends a command that starts the Borg regeneration sequence and effectively put them all to sleep; the command caused the Borg power net to [[feed back]] on itself and triggered a [[Self-destructive behavior|self-destruct]] sequence in [[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]], < br >  	 
 #Data and [[Geordi La Forge|La Forge]] came up with an invasive program designed as a [[Geometry|geometric form]] that could not actually exist in physical space. In the Borg collective memory each step to understand the program would start [[Anomaly|anomalous]] solutions that would interact with each other, resulting in an endless, unsolvable puzzle. Eventually, the Borg neural network would collapse under the strain of attempting to solve the [[paradox]], resulting in a total system failure across the entire Collective in [[I Borg (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|I Borg]], < br >   
 #A Borg experiences being an individual; this is so dangerous that the Borg Queen will destroy an entire Borg Square/or Sphere if even a hint of individuality is about to form in one Borg. " [[I Borg (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|I Borg]] " ;  " Unimatrix 1 and 2 "  and  " [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]] " . < br > 
 #[[Species 6339]] developed a [[synthetic]] [[pathogen]] so that when they were assimilated by the Borg, it would be spread to the Borg vinculum. From there, it caused all drones within range to experience the Borg equivalent of [[multiple personality disorder]], eventually leading to their self-destruction. The process would be repeated when another Borg vessel retrieved the [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], and so on in  " [[Infinate Regress (Star Trek: Voyager)|Infinate Regress]] " , < br > 
 #Future Admiral [[Kathryn Janeway]] had herself injected with a [[neurolytic]] [[pathogen]] and allowed herself to be assimilated by the [[Borg Queen]] who in turn self-destructed  "  along with The Borg transwarp complex and many Borg Spheres.  " [[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]] " , < br > 
 
 ==How many species assimiliated?== 
 By the time of Voyager, the Borg have assimilated 10,026 species
