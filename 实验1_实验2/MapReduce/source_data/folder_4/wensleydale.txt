 == Wensleydale in popular culture == 
 In the 1990s, sales of the cheese had fallen very low. However, in the popular [[Wallace and Gromit]] animated cartoons, ''A Grand Day Out'' and ''A Close Shave'' the main character Wallace, a cheese lover, mention Wensleydale as a particularly favourite cheese, which boosted sales of the cheese. < ref name= " Wallaceandgromit.net " > http://www.wallaceandgromit.net/wensleydale.php < /ref >
