[[File:Euromaidan collage.jpg|thumb|Euromaidan collage]]{{Campaignbox Post-Soviet conflicts}}'''Euromaidan''' ({{lang-uk|Євромайдан}}) was a period of [[demonstration]]s and civil unrest in [[Ukraine]]. It began on the night of 21 November 2013 with [[protest]]s demanding that Ukraine become part of the [[European Union]]. < ref > [http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-nov-21-23-coverage-332423.html EuroMaidan rallies in Ukraine - Nov. 21-23 coverage] < /ref >   On 30 November 2013 [[riot police]] attacked protestors, violently putting a stop to the protests. < ref > [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25164990 Ukraine police disperse EU-deal protesters] < /ref >   The protesters then demanded the resignation of [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/12/us-ukraine-idUSBRE9BA04420131212 |title=Kiev protesters gather, EU dangles aid promise |access-date=2017-08-31 |archive-date=2014-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420012605/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/12/us-ukraine-idUSBRE9BA04420131212 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   Many people were killed in the riots. < ref > [http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/euromaidan-draws-200000-people-for-new-years-party-334544.html EuroMaidan draws 200,000 people for New Year's party (VIDEO)] < /ref > 
 
 Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the western part of the country, wanted to be part of the European Union. But President Yanukovych wanted to maintain close relationships with Russia.  This angered pro-EU civilians.  They started Euromaidan.  On 30 November, the police intervened, sometimes violently.  As a result, more people came out to protest.  Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called ''Automaidan''. 
 
 The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued.  In March 2014 the Russian Federation captured [[Crimea]] which angered many other nations.  Some people feared this might lead to a global war.

 == Riots/revolution == 
 As the riots continued, the protesters were attacked.  Hundreds were killed or injured.  Ukrainians got the freedom they wanted and a new government, although they have not yet entered into the European Union.  Meanwhile Ukraine lost [[Crimea]] to Russia. 
 
 Russia did not like that the Ukrainian government was overthrown as the new more nationalist and anti-Russian government did not favor them. Some of the people in the east, in the [[Donbas]], preferred the old President, and declared [[independence]] and wanted to join Russia. Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the east, suffered in [[War in Donbas|fighting]].
