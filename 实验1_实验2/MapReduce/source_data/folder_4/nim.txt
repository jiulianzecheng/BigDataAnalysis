'''Nim''' is a simple game used for examples in [[combinatorial game theory]]. The rules of nim are simple: 
 # The game begins with some piles of [[counter]]s. 
 # Players alternate turns. 
 # On a turn, a player takes counters from a pile. At least one counter must be taken, but up to 3. All counters must be in the same pile. 
 # If a player cannot take a counter, that player loses. 
 
 There is a simple [[mathematical]] [[strategy]] to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup.
