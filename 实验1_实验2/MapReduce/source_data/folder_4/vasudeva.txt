 ==Sage Kashyapa incarnated as Vasudeva== 
 Sage Kashyapa is said to have incarnated as Vasudeva, the father of Krishna due to a curse of the god [[Brahma]]. Once, the sage performed a yajna (a Vedic sacrifice) in his hermitage for the welfare of the world. Kashyapa sought the help of the god [[Varuna]] for the offerings of milk, [[ghee]] etc. Varuna granted the sage a holy cow which will provide the offerings on the condition that the sage returns the same to Varuna after the sacrifice. After completing the sacrifice after several days, Kashyapa was overcome with greed, realizing the miraculous power of the cow, and refused to return the cow arguing that whatever is offered to a [[Brahmin]] like Kashyapa should never be sought back, and whoever does that would turn out to be a sinner. 
   
 Varuna requested Brahma for intervention. Brahma told the sage to get rid of his greed which is capable of destroying all his virtues, but Kashyapa remained adamant. The enraged Brahma cursed Kashyapa that he would be born on earth again as a cowherd and his two cows Aditi and Surabhi would be his two wives. This was King Vasudeva with his wives Rohiņi and Devaki. Kashyapa repented for his mistake and pleaded Brahma for mercy. Brahma blessed Kashypa that he would still be born as a cowherd in the [[Gwalvanshi Ahir|Gopa (Ahir) clan]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPEUAAAAMAAJ|title=Philosophical Theory and Social Reality|last=Kumar|first=Ravinder|date=1984|publisher=Allied|isbn=978-0-8364-1171-3|language=en|quote=Ahirs, Gopas, Gollas, and other cognate castes were and are cowherds.
