 A '''truffle''' is the [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting body]] of an underground [[mushroom]]. Its spores are dispersed by [[fungivore]]s (animals that eat fungi). Almost all truffles are found in close association with trees (see [[mycorrhiza]]). 
 
 Truffles are used as a food additive in cooking. The truffles improve the flavour. There are hundreds of species of truffles that can be used, but the fruiting body of some (mostly in the [[genus]] ''Tuber'') are highly prized. The 18th-century French [[Gastronomy|gastronome]] [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin|Brillat-Savarin]] called these truffles  " the diamond of the kitchen " . Edible truffles are expensive because they are held in high esteem in ''[[haute cuisine]]''. They are used in the cuisine of many countries in Europe and worldwide.

 === Black truffle === 
 [[Image:Truffe coupée.jpg|thumb|right|Black Périgord Truffle]] 
 
 The  " black truffle "  or  " black Périgord truffle "  ''Tuber melanosporum'' is named after the [[Périgord]] region in [[France]] and grows only with [[oak]]. Specimens can be found in late autumn and winter, reaching 7 & nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing up to 100 & nbsp;g. < ref name= " Carluccio03 " / >  Production is almost exclusively European, with [[France]] accounting for 45%, [[Spain]] 35%, [[Italy]] 20%, and small amounts from [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and the Australian states of Tasmania and Western Australia (see [[#In New Zealand and Australia|below]]). In 1900, France produced around 1,000 metric tonnes (1,100 [[short ton]]s) of ''Tuber melanosporum''. Production has considerably shrunk in the past century, and is now around 20 metric tonnes (22 short tons) per year, with peaks at 46 metric tonnes (50 short tons) in the best years. About 80% of the French production comes from southeast France. The largest truffle market in France (and probably also in the world) is at [[Richerenches]] in [[Vaucluse]]. The largest truffle market in southwest France is at [[Lalbenque]] in [[Quercy]]. These markets are busiest in the month of January, when the black truffles have their highest perfume. As of December 2009, black truffles were sold for about €1,000 per kilo in a farmer's market < ref > [http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/12/23/742355-Lalbenque-1-000-le-kg-la-truffe-de-Noel-au-prix-du-diamant.html Ladepeche.fr - Jean-Michel Fabre,  " Lalbenque. 1 000 € le kg: la truffe de Noël au prix du diamant " , 23/12/2009.] < /ref >  and €3,940 per kilo in a retail saler. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.maison-de-la-truffe.com/Produit/Truffe-Fraiche-Noire.aspx |title=Maison de la Truffe - TRUFFE FRAÎCHE NOIRE |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-date=2009-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228153812/http://www.maison-de-la-truffe.com/Produit/Truffe-Fraiche-Noire.aspx |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === White truffle === 
 [[Image:Truffle washed and cut.jpg|thumb|left|White truffle washed and cut]] 
 The  " white truffle "  or ''Alba madonna'' or ''Tuber magnatum'' comes from the [[Montferrat]] and [[Langhe]] areas of the [[Piedmont]] region in northern [[Italy]] and in the countryside around the city of [[Alba, (CN)|Alba]]. It is also found in [[Croatia]], on the [[Istria]] peninsula in the [[Motovun]] forest alongside Mirna river. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://gastro.croatia.hr/Gastronomija/Regije/Jelo.aspx?idRegion=6 & idMeal=45 |title=Gastro.croatia.hr |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-date=2008-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120094058/http://gastro.croatia.hr/Gastronomija/Regije/Jelo.aspx?idRegion=6 & idMeal=45 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  They grow with oak, hazel, poplar and beech trees, and fruit in autumn. They can reach 12 & nbsp;cm diameter and 500 & nbsp;g, though are usually much smaller. The flesh is pale cream or brown with white marbling. < ref name =  " Carluccio03 " > {{cite book | author = Carluccio A | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | url = https://archive.org/details/completemushroom0000carl | publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 1-84400-040-0}} < /ref >  Like the French black truffles, Italian white truffles are very highly esteemed (''illustration, left''). The white truffle market in Alba is busiest in the months of October and November, where a 1.6-pound white truffle sold to  " The Cody "  of southern California for $150,000 on November 8, 2009 during the 79th [[White Truffle Festival]]. In 2001, the ''Tuber magnatum'' truffles sold for between US$1,000 and $2,200 per pound; < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.restaurant.org/rusa/magArticle.cfm?ArticleID=674 |title=Page moved  & #124; National Restaurant Association |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718132556/http://www.restaurant.org/rusa/magArticle.cfm?ArticleID=674 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  as of December 2009 they were being sold at €10,200 per kilogram. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.maison-de-la-truffe.com/Produit/Truffe-Fraiche-Blanche.aspx |title=Maison de ça Truffe - TRUFFE FRAÎCHE BLANCHE (in French). |access-date=2011-02-21 |archive-date=2009-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228084359/http://www.maison-de-la-truffe.com/Produit/Truffe-Fraiche-Blanche.aspx |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Giancarlo Zigante and his dog Diana found one of the largest truffles in the world near [[Buje]], [[Croatia]]. The truffle weighed {{convert|1.31|kg|lb}} and has entered the [[Guinness Book of Records]]. 
 
 The record price paid for a single white truffle was set in December 2007, when [[Macau]] casino owner [[Stanley Ho]] paid US$330,000 (£165,000) for a specimen weighing {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}}, discovered by Luciano Savini and his dog Rocco. One of the largest truffles found in decades, it was unearthed near [[Pisa]] and sold at an auction held simultaneously in Macau, [[Hong Kong]] and [[Florence]]. < ref > {{cite news | date=2007-12-02 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7123414.stm | title=Giant truffle sets record price | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2007-12-02}} < /ref >  This record was then matched on November 27, 2010 when Ho again paid US$330,000 for a pair of white truffles including one weighing nearly a kilogram.

 Looking for truffles in open ground is almost always carried out with specially trained [[pig]]s ([[hog]]s) or, more recently, [[dog]]s. The [[Lagotto Romagnolo]] is the only dog breed recognized for sniffing out truffles (although virtually any breed could be trained for this purpose). < ref > {{cite news |url=http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-truffles30-2009aug30 |title=On the hunt for truffles in Western Australia |accessdate=2009-08-31 |author=Krista Simmons |date= 28 August 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |quote=Traditionally, truffle hunters — the Aussies call them  " punters "  — have used pigs to track their prey. More recently, punters have started using dogs, which, unlike pigs, will settle for a biscuit instead of chowing down on the truffle.}} < /ref >

 The female pig's natural truffle-seeking, as well as her intent to eat the truffle, is due to a compound in the truffle. This compound is similar to [[androstenol]], the sex [[pheromone]] of [[boar]] [[saliva]], to which the [[sow]] is keenly attracted. 
 
 In [[Italy]], the use of the pig to hunt truffles is prohibited since 1985 due to damage caused by animals to truffle's [[mycelia]] during the digging that dropped the production rate of the area for some years. 
 
 == Cultivation == 
 Truffles can be cultivated, but it is not easy. The two world wars disrupted the growing of truffles in Europe, and changes in land use has reduced the available area. Truffles are now being cultivated in Australia and New Zealand. < ref > {{cite book |editor1-last= Zambonelli|editor1-first= Alessandra |editor2-last=Bonito |editor2-first=Gregory M |date=2013 |title=Edible Ectomycorrhizal Mushrooms: Current Knowledge and Future Prospects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUo_AAAAQBAJ & dq=1999%2C+the+first+Australian+truffles+were+harvested+in+Tasmania & pg=PA193 |location=Germany |publisher=Springer |pages= 193|isbn=978-3-64233822-9 |accessdate=22 Mar 2014}} < /ref > < ref name= " NZ Truffle Association " > {{cite web| title=Truffles in New Zealand| url=http://www.southern-truffles.co.nz/html/truffles_in_nz.html| publisher=Southern_truffles.co.nz| accessdate=2012-07-19| archive-date=2013-05-04| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504065111/http://www.southern-truffles.co.nz/html/truffles_in_nz.html| url-status=dead}} < /ref >
