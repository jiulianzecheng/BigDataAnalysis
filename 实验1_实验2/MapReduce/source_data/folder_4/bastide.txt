[[File:Monpazier 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bastides are cities that are characterised by a main square with arcades. This one is in the City of Monpazier, in the Dordogne.]] 
 
 A '''bastide''' is a [[Fortification|fortified]] [[town]]. < ref > ''Bastide'' emphasises the  " built "  nature of the enterprise; in spite of the fortified connotations of ''[[Bastille]]'', most of the present town walls were not built initially, though their strategic location was a consideration from the start, in part through contractual promises of future military support from the new occupants. (Adrian Randolph,  " The Bastides of southwest France "  ''The Art Bulletin'' '''77'''.2 (June 1995, pp. 290-307) pp 291 note 11 and 303. < /ref >  They were built mainly in the south of [[France]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. Most bastides were built between 1229 and 1373, between the [[Albigensian Crusade]] and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Today, there are about 400 bastides. They all have a central [[Town square|square]], and a [[rectangle|rectangular]] street layout. On the [[market]] square, the houses have [[arcade]]s. They were usually built in places that were easy to [[defend]], such as the top of a [[hill]] or on a [[plain]]. 
 
 Well-known bastides today are [[Carcassonne]] and [[Andorra la Vella]]. 
 
 ==Overview== 
 Bastides are [[medieval]] [[city|cities]]. There is an act of [[foundation]] (a law made to start them). There are often historic documents written about them. 
 Some times they are [[planned city|planned cities]] and are usually only one [[architect]] (or one lord) designs it. They were often built where there was already a [[village]], or at a place of [[historical]] importance. They were sometimes also built where people bought and sold things a lot (for example where [[trade|trading]] [[route]]s crossed). 
 
 The [[Treaty of Paris (1229)]] is sometimes seen as the foundation act which made the construction of modern cities and bastides possible. The treaty itself ended the Albigensian Crusade.  One of the first bastides built was [[Montauban]]. Montauban became a city in 1144. However some consider [[Mont-de-Marsan]] which was founded in 1133 to be a bastide. 
 
 ==Purpose== 
 Most bastides were built in the countryside. They were basically to serve the needs of local trade (usually, [[agriculture]]). A few of them were built in places which were very easy to defend. Others were built where it was possible to defend them, but most bastides were simply built where they were needed. The time when they were built was a peaceful one in the region. 
 
 ==Builders of Bastides== 
 
 Bastides were built by people who had a high social status, such as: < ref > Jacques Dubourg, ''Histoire des bastides'', éditions Sud-Ouest, 2002,{{ISBN|2-87901-492-1}}, pages 55 to 70 < /ref > 
 
 * The [[count]]s of [[Toulouse]],  [[Raymond VII]] and [[Alphonse of Poitiers]]. 
 * The [[king]]s of France, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], [[Philippe III of France|Philippe III]], and [[Philippe IV of France|Philippe IV]]. 
 * The kings of [[England]], [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. 
 * High-ranking [[seneschal]]s, Doat Alaman, Eustache of Beaumarchès and Jean of Grailly. They did this in the name of their lords. 
 * Local lords, namely the counts of [[Foix]], of [[Comminges]] and [[Astarac]]. 
 * Religious authorities, such as [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s. 
 
 ==Structural elements== 
 [[File:Sommet d'une bastide-Lot.JPG|thumb|right|A typical square at the top of a bastide.]] 
 ===Central square=== 
 The main feature of all bastides is a central, open place, or square. It was used for markets, but also used for [[political]] and [[social]] gatherings. A [[wikt:typical|typical]] square, (which was probably a [[model]] for other bastides), can be found in Montauban. 
 
 Generally, there is just one square. [[Saint-Lys]] and [[Albias]] are different because they have two squares, one for the market, and one square for the [[church]]. 
 
 The square is also used to [[wikt:divide|divide]] the city into quarters. Generally it lies outside the main street (the axis) which carried the [[traffic]]. There are three possible layouts: 
 * ''completely closed'': The square does not touch any street. These are very [[wikt:rare|rare]]; there is one example at [[Tournay]] with a size of {{convert|70|m|ft|0|lk=on}} by {{convert|72|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}). 
 * ''single-axis'': These happen because of the single-axis design of the bastide. All roads run in one direction and are parallel. Here and there there are alleys cut between the roads. The square is placed between two roads. These squares are usually {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on each side. 
 * ''grid-layout''; usually based on the square in Montauban. 
 
 Generally the [[wikt:flat|flattest]] place in the bastide was used for the square. 
 
 ===Church=== 
 Except in very rare cases, the church was not on the central square. Usually it was at an angle, and faced the square [[diagonal]]ly. One of the rare exceptions is [[Villefranche-de-Rouergue]]. 
 
 ===Houses=== 
 There were clear rules how houses could be built in the bastide. The front of the houses - the façades - had to line up. Also there had to be a small space between the houses. The different housing lots were all alike, {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} by {{convert|24|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} was a common size. There were only a limited number of lots. This varied between 10, and several thousand (3,000 in [[Grenade-sur-Garonne]]) 
 
 ===Streets=== 
 The streets were usually {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} – {{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, so a [[chariot]] could pass through. They ran alongside the [[façade]]s of the houses. Alleys run between streets, these are usually only {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} – {{convert|6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide. Sometimes they are only {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} – {{convert|2.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide. In a bastide there were usually between one and eight streets. 
 
 ===City walls=== 
 When bastides were founded most had no city walls or [[fortification]]s. This was because it was a peaceful time in history. Such things were added later. This was done either through a special [[tax]], or through a law that [[wikt:require|required]] that the people of the city helped build the walls. A good example is [[Libourne]]. Ten years after the city was founded, the people asked for money to build city walls. Once they had received the money, they spent it on making their city prettier, rather than building walls. 
 
 At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, many bastides that had no city walls were destroyed. Some of the others quickly built stone walls, to [[protect]] the city. 
 
 == Layout of a bastide == 
 
 There are different base layouts for bastides. Often for each type of layout, there was a bastide that was an example for other bastides. The most common layout started from two [[wikt:perpendicular|perpendicular]] [[street]]s. New streets were made parallel to the two original streets. This led to a usually rectangular grid layout. 
 
 ===Unstructured bastide=== 
 There seems to have been no plan when these bastides were built. This may have been for the following reasons: 
 * They were built in a place where there already was a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] or village and the bastide had to allow for the buildings. 
 * There were very few people who lived in the bastide, (which means the reason for the bastide failed). 
 * The [[lord]]s who built them had little or no authority to put their ideas into practice. 
 
 An example of such a bastide is [[La Bastide-de-Bousignac]]. 
 
 ===Circular bastide=== 
 The circle layout for a bastide was very rare. The only [[wikt:survive|surviving]] example is in [[Fourcès]]. 
 
 ===Enclosing type=== 
 Enclosing bastides were built around an existing small village or [[hamlet]]. There already was a church or a small group of houses. When new houses were built, they were added around the original buildings. 
 
 ===One axis design=== 
 There is one main street that links the two gates. This makes the [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] around which the bastide was built. These are quite common, with about 30—40% of all bastides using this design. Very often they are found on flat land.  The square is often made by making the main street bigger. Very often there are alleys which run perpendicular to the main street. This layout is very easy to change to fit in with the local [[landscape]]. 
 
 An example of a one axis bastide is [[Gimont]]. Gimont is {{convert|1000|m|yd|0|lk=on}} long, and only {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} wide. Sometimes, there is another street which runs [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the main axis. The city square is made between the two streets. 
 
 ===Two axis design=== 
 There are two main streets, axes, which are perpendicular (make a [[right angle]]). All other streets are at a right angle, or parallel to one of the two main streets. The city square is very often in the centre, or very near the centre. The whole city is either rectangular, square, [[hexagon]]al or [[oval]] shaped. This layout was the plan used at the height of the bastide movement. 
 
 ==Making a bastide== 
 A few steps are necessary to make a new bastide, these are: 
 *[[wikt:choose|Choosing]] a place where the baside can be built. 
 *Choosing a name for it; there are different options: 
 *#Telling about the [[wikt:privilege|privileges]] of [[citizenship]]: Villefranche, La Bastide. 
 *#Telling about the site where it is built; [[Monségur, Gironde|Monségur]] or [[Montastruc-la-Conseillère|Montastruc]] tell about the fact the place was easy to defend or a [[wikt:pleasant|pleasant]] one to live in. 
 *#The name tells about foreign cities the lord has visited when he went abroad, like for a [[crusade]] or for a war: [[Pavie, Gers|Pavie]], [[Fleurance]] (for [[Florence]]), [[Grenade, Haute-Garonne|Grenade]], [[Cordes-sur-Ciel|Cordes]] (for [[Cordoba]]), Tournay (for [[Tournai]] in Flanders ), but also [[Bruges-Capbis-Mifaget|Bruges]] ([[Bruges]], also in Flanders) and [[Gan, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Gan]] ([[Ghent]], in Belgium). 
 *#Name of the founding nobleman, for example Libourne is named after ''Leyburn''. 
 *#The [[authority]] of a king: Montréal (means: mountain of the king). 
 *A [[contract]] is made between the noblemen who owned the land, and who (co-)founded the city. 
 *A plan of what the city should look like is drawn. 
 
 Once all this steps are done, the bastide is not yet founded. The next step is to attract people to come live in the new city. This is done by making a ''Charta of customs''. This Charta does not tell so much about customs, but rather about the privileges those that live there (the citizens) get. These privileges can be of different kinds: 
 *Based on taxes: Those that live in the city have to pay less taxes. 
 *Based on a given legal status. 
 *Based on honorifics. 
 
 Bastides wanted to attract people who should come to live there. They therefore offered equality to those who came to live there. They made it look like citizens had equal rights, and were free. 
 
 ==Legal foundations for bastides== 
 The social system was very fixed and unchanging during the Middle Ages. The system of laws of the Middle Ages was built on the fact that society did not change. Everyone had their place in the system and they stayed there. The lords who built the bastide did not want to change the social system. All they wanted was small local improvements. Usually, the land where the bastide was built was not developed. The lords that owned the land were not making much money from it. They built the bastide because they hoped they would get more profits from the land. 
 
 For these reasons, people who already had a social status, ([[serfdom|serf]]s, [[nobleman|noblemen]] and [[priest]]s) could not settle in the bastide. A few poor noblemen gave their [[land]] to the city and started a [[career]] as a [[trader]], because that way they could earn more money than before. 
   
 The people who lived in the city looked free, but this freedom had limits: 
 *When they came to the city, they had equal chances of being able to live there, and being made a citizen (Not all people who lived in the bastide were citizens). 
 *On paper, all citizens had equal rights and duties. 
 
 Men and women did not have equal rights. Women are often mentioned in the Charter, and have some rights: 
 *In most of the bastides, husbands did not have the right to beat their wives. 
 *There are special rules regarding [[dowry]]. Sometimes even men have to pay it. 
 
 [[Leprosy|Lepers]] were usually not welcome in the city. Certain bastides had special places which would treat them, but they were generally [[wikt:exclude|excluded]] from social life. They had to wear special [[badge]]s to show they were [[ill]], and they could not come close to normal people. 
 
 Another group of people that was generally not welcome were the [[Jews]]. In the beginning there was no problem, but later Jews were [[Religious persecution|persecuted]]. [[Philip IV of France]] did not allow any Jews to live in France, in 1306. He confiscated their belongings and sold them.

 #Know that from us or our successors, you will collect in this town no ''Quête'', nor ''Taille'', nor ''droit de gîte''. Also, you will not collect any [[Subsidy|subsidies]] whatsoever unless the inhabitants' want to. 
 #The current inhabitants of our city, and those who are going to live here can sell, give away, or pass on all their movable and immovable possessions to whoever they want. They can however not give their immovable goods to a [[church]], [[convent]] or [[military]] order unless they respect the right of the [[Lord|seigneurs]] from whom they hold [[fief]]s. 
 #The [[citizen]]s of said city can give their daughters freely in [[marriage]] to whom they want. They can promote their sons to the order of the church. 
 #We will not [[arrest]] any inhabitant of the city. We will not hurt them. We will not take his goods, if he has promised he has not broken any laws. This does not include murder, blessing someone mortally, and others. In these cases his goods will be delivered to us. 
 #If there is a request or a complaint, our representative will not be able to ask any inhabitant of this city to testify outside the bastide for events that happened inside the city. An exception to this is if request the inhabitants request it. 
 #If an inhabitant of this city dies without a [[Will (law)|testament]], without any children, and if nobody else comes to collect the heritage, our representatives will [[Choice|choose]] two people who will guard the goods. They will guard them for a year and a day. If someone who can [[Rights|rightfully]] claim the heritage within that time, all the goods will be given to him. Concerning the immovables which belong to others seigneurs, they will be given back to them. This is, after the [[debt]]s of the person who's died have been paid following the customs of the diocese of [[Agen]]. This is, if the debt can be clearly established during the year. 
 #Testaments written by the inhabitants of the city, with a trustworthy witnesse shall be valid. This is, even if they were not established following all the rules required by the law. The only condition is that the children must get the part which rightfully belongs to them. To warrant this, the local [[priest]] or other [[clergy]] shall be called, wherever possible. 
 #Whoever lives in this city will not be forced to enter a duel or single-handed combat to prove his innocence if he is accused. If he refuses to enter combat, he will not be seen as guilty. The person who accuses him may do so in a court of law. He may use witnesses, or any other good way for the purpose, following legal forms. 
 #Inhabitants of the city may give or receive as rent or gift goods form any other person wishing to sell, rent, or give his immovable goods. This does not include fiefs, [[allodial land]] and [[terrain]]s for military use. These cannot be bought or received without the inhabitants, or their successors agreeing to the trade. 
 #For each [[Land|plot of land]] which is 16 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] wide, and 48 feet long, we will only pay 6 deniers, on the [[Festival|feast]] of Ste Foy. There will also be this [[tax]] when the owner changes. If the land is sold, we will get 1/12 of the selling price of the seller as a tax. If these taxes are not paid by a certain date, we will get 6 sols, in addition to the taxes due. 
 #We or our representatives shall establish a fine for [[arson]], or for other crimes committed inside this city. These fines are established following the [[custom]]s of the diocese of Agen. 
 #When the representatives of our city start their duties, they shall promise to do as well as they can. They also promise to respect the [[law]]s and customs of this city. 
 #[[Official|Consuls]] of the city will be changed each year, on the day of [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. We or our representative will elect 6 catholic consuls on that day. They will be chosen among the inhabitants of the city. We will pick those which seem the most honest, and those who are the best suited to the needs of the community and ourselves. These consuls will promise in the presence of us and our representatives, to serve us well, to keep up our rights, to govern the people, and to be a consul as well as they can. These consuls shall receive no compensation for what they do from anyone just for being a consul. The community will promise in return to help these consuls and to follow them in all things. Our [[sovereignty]] will not be touched by these measures. The consuls will have the right to repair [[street]]s, [[alley]]s, [[fountain]]s and [[bridge]]s. Together with the consulate of 24 people, elected by the community, they shall collect the [[money]] from the citizens, to execute these works. They can also collect money for works for the general utility of the people. 
 #All those who [[Garbage|litter]] public streets and alleys with human [[excrement]]s will be punished by our representative or by the consuls. 
 #Every man having [[property]] or [[income]] in the city,will contribute to the upkeep of the city in the same manner as the inhabitants of the cities. This also applies to his successors. If he refuses, our representative can seize his goods on the request of the consuls. Clerics and other privileged people will do the same for the goods which they did not get by heritage. They have no such obligation as to the goods they inherited. They can contribute for their pure heart and good will. 
 #[[Food|Comestibles]] from outside the city which are brought into the city to be sold, can only be sold on the marketplace, if they came from farther away than half a league. People who do not respect this rule shall be [[fine]]d. The [[buy]]er and the [[sell]]er shall each pay 2 sous for legal [[expense]]s. [[Foreigner]]s who do not know this custom do not have to pay.

They are also required to put the [[Injury|injured]] back into a reasonable state. If, blood has flown, the aggressor has to pay 20 sols in legal fees, if the matter was brought before the [[court]]. If he used a [[glaive]], a [[bat]], a [[stone]], a [[brick]], the [[fee]] will be 20 sols if there was no blood. If there was blood, and the matter was brought before the court, the fee will be 60 sols. In addition, the victim will receive reparation. 
 #If someone has committed [[murder]], and has been judged as [[guilty]] for the death of the victim, when it can be considered [[homicide]], he will be punished by a judgment of our court, and his goods will fall to us, after having paid his debts. 
 #Whoever addresses [[insult]]s, reproaches, or speech that hurts the feelings of someone else will be fined two sols and a half, if the matter is brought before the court.

 #If someone steals an object, by night or day, worth 2 sols or less, they shall run through the city with the object around his [[neck]]. He will also pay a 5 sol fine and give the object back to its owner. This does not apply to [[fruit]]. If the object is worth more than 5 sols, and it is the first offence, the person will be fined 60 sols. If he has already stolen he will be judged by our court. If an offender was hanged for stealing, and if the worth of his possessions allows it, we will receive 10 pounds for legal fees. This is, after his debts have been paid. The rest will be given as heritage. 
 #Whoever penetrates someone else's [[garden]], [[vineyard]], or [[meadow]], and steals [[fruit]], [[hay]], [[grass]] or [[wood]]of a value of 12 deniers or less, during the day, will be fined 2 sols and a half.

But in the nine days following, our representative will have to make the creditor pay back everything, otherwise the debtor will have to pay a two and a half sol fine for his right to justice. 
 #For a normal complaint with a lawsuit, if someone asks for more time, they will pay us, five sols for right to justice, after the sentence falls. 
 #If a person does something wrong and the representative tells him the same day, he will have to pay a two and a half sol fine. The fine will be for rights of justice and the legal costs that the opposition need. 
 #Our representative must not receive the money from justice until the lawsuit is finished and one side has won. 
 #For lawsuits concerning [[house]]s, we will receive five sols after the judgement. 
 #In all complaint followed by a lawsuit, if there is not enough evidence, the person who complained will have to pay us a five sol fine. The fine will be for rights of justice and the legal costs that the opposition need. 
 #The [[market]] will have to be on [[Thursday]]. If a [[bull]], a [[cow]], a [[pig]], more than a year is sold by a foreigner, he will pay us one denier for the ''droit de leude''. For a [[donkey]], a [[she-donkey]], a [[horse]], a [[mule]] of more than a year, the seller will have to give us two deniers for the ''droit de leude''. Below this age, he will not have to pay anything. For a [[domestic sheep|ewe]], a [[Sheep|ram]], a [[goat]], he will pay one obole. For a ''saumée'' ''(4 sesters)'' of [[wheat]] he will pay one denier. For a sester, he will pay one denier. For a ''hémine'' he will pay one ''obole''. These fees are for the ''droit de leude'' and measuring. For a box, we will not collect anything. The glass-cutter ''(someone who cuts glass)'', will pay one denier or a cut equivalent to one denier. For a ''saumée'' of [[metal]] objects or [[wool]], the seller will pay two deniers. For [[shoe]]s, [[cauldron]]s, [[firedogs]], [[frying pan]]s, [[trill]]s, [[pot]]s, [[Knife|knives]], [[scythe]]s, [[salt]]ed [[fish]] and other basic things, the foreign merchant will pay two deniers. For a ''saumée''and for a man's load of items, he will pay is one denier. For a ''saumée'' of [[vase]]s and pots, it is one denier. For a man's load of these objects, it is also one denier. 
 #We will hold fairs on assigned days. Every foreign [[merchant]] will have to pay an entrance and exit fee. They will also pay for the right to be in the town four deniers per man. For his items, one denier. As of the items bought, for use at home, the buyer will not have to pay a tax. 
 #Each inhabitants allowed to have an oven built in his Faubourg. For each oven, whether it's for baking bread to sell or your to give to your neighbour, we will get twelve deniers every weak for the ''droits d'oublies''. 
 #Acts committed by the town's civil law notaries will have the same value as any public act. 
 
 These liberties and customs are approved by us with all and each one of its articles above, as long as law permits us to. In everlasting testimony on what we do, we fix our seal to these. Done in Vincennes, in June, in the year of the Lord 1256.

 ==Later developments== 
 A number of bastides were successful and still exist today. Many others have failed, and most of their population left them. 
 
 The bastides had three stages of development or change: 
 
 # Many bastides failed to take off, and disappeared, as new people did not come to live there. Those that are left see an economic growth that changes the way south-eastern France is organised. 
 # During the Hundred Years' War the bastides that are left, are forced to build city walls to defend themselves. Those that do not disappear from the map during the war. After the end of the war, there is [[prosperous|prosperity]] again. The position of the [[bourgeoisie]] is strengthened. Long-distance roads are built and the bastides along these roads profit [[wikt:enormous|enormously]]. 
 #In the [[19th century|19th]] and [[20th century|20th centuries]] people left the countryside to move to the cities. During this time bastides are tested again, and some disappear.
