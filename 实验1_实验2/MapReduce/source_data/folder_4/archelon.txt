 '''''Archelon''''' was a huge marine [[turtle]] ([[Testudines]]) that was the size of a car. It lived in [[North America]] 74 million years ago (from the [[Upper Cretaceous]]) in the [[Epeiric sea|epeiric]] inland sea called the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. [[Fossil]]s have been found in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Kansas]] and [[South Dakota]].

Its only [[predator]]s were probably the larger [[mosasaur]]s. From its [[beak]], its own food was probably [[squid]]. 
 
 ''Archelon'', like other turtles, had a solidly-roofed skull with no opening (except for eyes, and nostrils).
