 '''Manhattan''' is one of the five [[borough]]s that make up [[New York City]], and is the center of the [[New York metropolitan area]]. It is also located over the same area as a [[county]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] state called '''New York County'''. Although it is the smallest borough, it is the most [[population density|densely populated]] borough. Most of the borough of Manhattan is on Manhattan [[Island]], but the Marble Hill neighborhood is part of the mainland United States (by way of [[the Bronx]]). Several smaller islands, including [[Roosevelt Island]], are also part of Manhattan. 
 
 The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] bought it from the [[Native Americans]] and called it '''[[New Amsterdam]]''', then the English took it over and changed the name to New York. The name ''Manhattan'' comes from the Munsi language of the [[Lenni Lenape]] meaning ''island of many hills''. Other theories say that it comes from one of three Munsi words.  " Manahactanienk "  meaning  " place of inebriation " . Other possibilities are  " manahatouh "  meaning  " a place where wood is available for making bows and arrows "  and  " menatay "  meaning simply  " the island. "   < ref > {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngqJWOykT8QC & dq=Manahactanienk & pg=RA6-PA228|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|work=Lydia Maria Francis Child, Bruce Mills|accessdate=29 December 2010|title=Letters from New-York|year=1998|isbn=9780820320779}} < /ref >

 == History == 
 Before [[colonization]], the [[Lenape|Lenape Indians]] lived in the area that is now called Manhattan. < ref name= " colonization " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/kingston/colonization.htm|title=Dutch Colonization|publisher=National Park Service: U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=8 January 2011}} < /ref >  In 1524, Lenape people in canoes met [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], the first European explorer to pass [[New York Harbor]], although he may not have entered the harbor past [[the Narrows]]. < ref > Sullivan, Dr. James.

" There is satisfactory evidence that Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into the outer harbor of New York in 1524. < /ref >  [[Henry Hudson]], an Englishman who worked for the [[Dutch East India Company]], made the first map of the area. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.226262|title=New York: the World's Capital City, Its Development and Contributions to Progress|author=Rankin, Rebecca B|last2=Cleveland Rodgers|publisher=Harper|year=1948}} < /ref > 
 
 === Colonial times === 
 [[File:CastelloPlanOriginal.jpg|thumb|left|Lower Manhattan in 1660, when it was part of [[New Amsterdam]]. The large building toward the tip of the island is [[Fort Amsterdam]]. North is on the right in this map.]] 
 
 In the 1620s, the first large European [[colony]] was started in [[New Netherland]], when the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] began trading fur on [[Governors Island]]. < ref name= " colonization "  / >  In 1625, the Dutch chose '''Manhattan Island''' to build [[Fort Amsterdam]],  a [[citadel]] for the protection of the new arrivals. It would later be called [[New Amsterdam]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nieuw Amsterdam''). The creation of New Amsterdam was recognized as the birth of [[New York City]]. 
 
 On May 24, 1626, Manhattan was bought from the [[Native American]]s living on the island. The [[price]] was trading goods worth 60 [[guilder]]s, which was worth about 24 [[dollar]]s at the time. The currency calculations from the [[International Institute of Social History]] in [[Amsterdam]] say that 60 guilders in the 1620s cost around [[USD|$]]1000 now. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Value of the Guilder/Euro: Comparing the purchasing power of the guilder from 1450 to any other year.|url=http://www.iisg.nl/hpw/calculate.php|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=|accessdate=8 January 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1647, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] became the last Dutch Director General of the colony. New Amsterdam was considered an official [[city]] on 3 February 1653. In 1664, the British [[wikt:conquer|conquered]] New Netherland and renamed it  " New York "  after the English [[King James II]], then known as [[Duke of York|Duke of York and Albany]]. Stuyvesant and his [[council]] made a deal with the British where New Netherlanders were promised [[liberty|liberties]], including [[freedom of religion]], under British rule. In August 1673, the Dutch took control of the island again, calling the city  " New Orange "  ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nieuwe Oranje''). The Dutch lost control of New Netherland forever to the English in November 1674 by [[treaty]]. 
 
 === American Revolution === 
 [[File:NYC fire 1776.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A 1776 [[illustration]] by an unknown artist of [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|the fire]] that destroyed much of the city]] 
 Manhattan was the center of many [[campaign]]s, battles and meetings during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1765, all of the colonies worked together for a unified political aim when the [[Stamp Act|Stamp Act Congress]] (meeting) of [[representative]]s from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] was held in New York City to write The [[Declaration of Rights and Grievances]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/10a.asp|title=10a. Stamp Act Congress|accessdate=9 January 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Sons of Liberty]], a [[Boston]] based group, were part of a long-term battle with British authorities over liberty poles that were sometimes raised by the Sons of Liberty and cut down by the British. The [[wikt:dispute|disputes]] ended when the revolutionary [[New York Provincial Congress]] took power in 1775. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3sFAAAAQAAJ & pg=PA47|title=The New York Civil List|author=Hough, Franklin B|year=1858|publisher=Weed Parsons  &  Co, 1858|page=46 – 48|accessdate=7 January 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 Manhattan was the center of a [[wikt:series|series]] of large battles in the early [[American Revolutionary War]]. < ref name= " amrev " > {{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/11.asp|title=11. The American Revolution|accessdate=9 January 2011}} < /ref >  These battles were called the '''[[New York and New Jersey Campaign|New York Campaign]]''', where British forces and colonists fought for control of New York City and the state of [[New Jersey]]. The rebel [[Continental Army]], led by [[George Washington]], had to leave Manhattan after losing the [[Battle of Fort Washington]] on 16 November 1776. Shortly after, Manhattan was greatly damaged by the [[Great Fire of New York (1776)|Great Fire of New York]] in 1776. 
 
 Victory gave the British control of the area. They used the city as the center for political and military activities for the rest of [[American Revolutionary War|the war]]. Loyalists from elsewhere came to the city as [[refugee]]s from the Rebels and to join the war. 
 
 Years later, Washington came back to Manhattan with his army. On [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]], the last British occupation forces left the city on 25 November 1783. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=March 1997|title=History of WaHI: Evacuation Day|url=http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/evacuation_day_122.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106180930/http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/evacuation_day_122.html|archive-date=January 6, 2006|accessdate=11 January 2011|website=}} < /ref >  On 30 April, 1789, Washington was [[inauguration|inaugurated]] (officially became) the first [[president of the United States]] and took his [[oath of office]] at [[Federal Hall]] on [[Wall Street]]. < ref > EyeWitness to History [http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/washingtoninaug.htm  " The Inauguration of George Washington, 1789 " ], www.eyewitnesstohistory.com, accessed 11 January 2011.

Washington, Vice President John Adams, the Senators and Representatives stepped out of the chamber onto a balcony overlooking the street filled with a cheering crowd. As there were as yet no Supreme Court Justices, the Oath of Office was administered by Chancellor Robert R. Livingstone - New York's highest ranking judge. After taking the oath, Washington and the others returned to the Senate Chamber where the new president gave a short speech.

 === Immigration influx and Gilded Age === 
 [[File:New York, N.Y., yard of tenement LOC det.4a18586.jpg|thumb|200px|Old tenements in Manhattan.]] 
 In the early 19th century, Manhattan grew in population and economically. Another great fire in 1835 destroyed much of the city but it was soon rebuilt. Because of the [[Great Famine|Great Irish Famine]], a lot of [[Ireland|Irish]] people [[emigration|emigrated]] (left their country) to live in New York; they made up for 25% of Manhattan's population at the time. < ref > {{cite book |title=The New York Irish |author=Bayor, Ronald H. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0801857643 |page=91}} < /ref >  Many of the Irish people lived in a part of the [[Lower East Side]] known as the [[Bowery]] or in another section called [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]].

Over a million people lived in the area at one point. 
 
 An Irish political machine called [[Tammany Hall]] was very important to New York City during the Gilded Age. < ref name= " tammany " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Spartacus Educational: Tammany Society|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAtammany.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011123113253/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAtammany.htm|archive-date=November 23, 2001|accessdate=11 January 2011|website=|quote=Initially a social organisation, it became increasingly political and by the middle of the 19th century had become a significant force in city government.

 The rate of immigration from Europe shot up after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and New York became the most popular state for immigrants in the United States. Because of this, the French built and gave New York the [[Statue of Liberty]] on October 28, 1886. Soon after, the boroughs of Manhattan and [[Brooklyn]] were [[wikt:combine|combined]] into [[New York City|one city]]. 
 
 === Economic downfall and rise ===

 In the beginning of the 20th century, many new things were built in the city, like [[skyscraper]]s and the [[New York City Subway]]. The first subway transit center, the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|Interborough Rapid Transit]] or ''IRT'', opened to the public in 1904. < ref name= " subway " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/faq/briefhist.html|title=IRT - BMT - IND: A Brief History of the Subway|accessdate=21 January 2011}} < /ref >  The installation of the Subway helped tie the new city together, as did new bridges to [[Brooklyn]].

Once the city's [[demography|demographics]] were steadier, labor [[Trade union|union]]ization provided protection and [[wikt:affluence|affluence]] to the [[working class]]. Despite the [[Great Depression]], some of the world's tallest skyscrapers of the time were built in Manhattan during the 1930s, including many [[Art Deco]] masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today. The most well-known structures are [[Empire State Building]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the [[GE Building]]. 
 
 Following the end of [[World War II]], a lot of veterans came home to the United States. This led to the development of private communities that were intended to be sold or rented out to returning soldiers, resulting in an economic boom. An example of one of the communities built to attract veterans looking for homes is [[Stuyvesant Town—Peter Cooper Village]], which opened in 1947. In 1951, the [[United Nations]] relocated from its first headquarters in Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan. 
 
 Population and industry began to [[wikt:decline|decline]] in the 1960s. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent demonstrations by members of the [[gay]] community. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a [[graffiti]]-covered, [[crime]]-ridden [[relic]] of history. In 1975, the city government went [[bankrupt]] (ran out of money), and its pleas for financial help were rejected at first.
