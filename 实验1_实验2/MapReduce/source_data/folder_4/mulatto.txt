 '''Mulatto''' is a [[word]] referring to a person who is [[birth|born]] to one [[Black people|black]] parent and one [[White people|white]] parent. The term may be considered offensive or rude to some, because of its origin. The term is also used to refer to a light [[brown]] color, because of a mulatto's skin color.  Many people prefer terms such as  " biracial "  and  " of [[mixed race]] "  over  " mulatto " . 
 
 In some cultures, such as in [[Cuba]], there are a number of terms describing skin colour, and ''none of them is taken as evaluative''. There are simply descriptive terms. And in the [[Spanish language]] the term '''mulata''' would be used for females of mixed race. < ref > Guillen, Nicolas 1931. ''Songoro cosongo: poemas mulatos''.

 There are other descriptive terms which are used in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]], without their being regarded as racial in the [[pejorative]] sense.
