'''Optics''' is the [[science]] of [[light]] and how it interacts with the world. Optics explains how [[rainbow]]s exist, how light reflects off [[mirror]]s, how light [[refraction|refracts]] through [[glass]] or [[water]], and what splits light shining through a [[prism]]. In addition to [[visible light]] in the standard  " [[spectrum]] "  of [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]], optics also deals with invisible parts of the whole [[electromagnetic spectrum]] of which visible light is only a small part. 
 
 Optics is both a science and an area of [[engineering]]. It has been used to make many useful things, including [[eyeglasses]], [[camera]]s, [[telescope]]s, and [[microscope]]s. Many of these things are based on [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], which [[focusing|focus]] light and can make [[image]]s of things that are bigger or smaller than the original. 
 
 While optics is an old science, new things are still being discovered in it. [[Scientist]]s have learned how to make light travel through a thin [[optical fiber]] made of glass or plastic. Light can go long [[distance]]s in a [[fiber]]. Fibers are used to carry [[phone]] calls and the [[Internet]] through cities and around the world.
