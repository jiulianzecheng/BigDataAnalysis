 In [[Christian theology]], '''reconciliation''' is the process of repairing one's [[relationship]] with [[God]]. This comes after [[atonement]]. It is a part of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]]. Reconciliation is the end of the estrangement, caused by [[original sin]], between God and his people. [[John Calvin]] describes reconciliation as the peace between humanity and God that results from atoning for religious sin. < ref > [[John Calvin]], ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (II.16.2). < /ref >
