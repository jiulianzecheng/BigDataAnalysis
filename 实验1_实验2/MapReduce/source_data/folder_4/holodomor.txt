 The '''Holodomor''' ({{lang-uk|Голодомор}}, which means  " [[murder]] by [[hunger]] " ) was a [[man-made]] [[famine]] that happened in [[Ukraine]] in 1932 and in 1933. It is also known as the '''Terror-Famine''' or '''Great Famine'''. At that time, Ukraine was a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. About seven million people [[starvation|starved]] to death in the Holodomor. < ref > {{Cite web

 [[Joseph Stalin]] was the [[leader]] and [[dictator]] of the Soviet Union, which was a [[communism|communist]] country. He made [[farmer]]s in the Soviet Union change the way they farmed, then he tried to make the farmers work harder for the [[government]]-[[ownership|owned]] [[farm]]s, for less [[money]]. < ref > {{Cite web
