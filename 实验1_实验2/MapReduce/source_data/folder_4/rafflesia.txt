 '''''Rafflesia''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plants]].  They are found in southeastern Asia, on the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]]. < ref name='VJR' > [http://sabah.gov.my VJR Rafflesia Reserve, Forestry Department Sabah, Malaysia] < /ref >  They are the biggest single flowers in the world. < ref > As contrasted to the [[Titan arum]] (''Amorphophallus titanum''), which has the largest unbranched [[inflorescence]], and the  [[Talipot palm]] (''Corypha umbraculifera''), which has the largest branched inflorescence . < /ref >  In one [[species]] the flowers can be over a meter (three feet) across. 
 
 The flowers smell like a dead animal, < ref > {{cite web|author=Library of Congress|title=What is the largest flower in the world?|website=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/flower.html|accessdate=August 28, 2012}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|author=Western Michigan University|title=Rafflesia|url=http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~tbarkman/rafflesia/Rafflesia.html|accessdate=August 28, 2012|archive-date=July 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707224001/http://unix.cc.wmich.edu/~tbarkman/rafflesia/Rafflesia.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  which attracts flies. The flies, which normally lay their eggs on rotten flesh, [[pollinate]] the ''Rafflesia'' when they get inside. 
 
 ''Rafflesia'' is a [[parasite]], and does not use [[chlorophyll]]. The plant has no [[Plant stem|stem]], [[leaves]] or true [[root]]s. It lives inside [[vines]] of the genus ''Tetrastigma'' ([[Vitaceae]]). It spreads its [[wikt:absorb|absorptive]] organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The only part of the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the flower.
