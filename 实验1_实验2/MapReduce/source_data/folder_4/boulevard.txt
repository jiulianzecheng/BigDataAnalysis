A '''boulevard''' is a type of broad [[avenue]] planted with rows of trees. In parts of [[North America]], all urban [[Highway|highways]] are called boulevards.  
 
 In French, it originally meant the flat surface of a [[rampart]], and later a [[promenade]] taking the place of a demolished [[fortification]].
