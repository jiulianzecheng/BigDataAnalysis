 '''Sewu''' ({{lang-id|Candi Sèwu}}) is a [[Buddhist]] temple built in 8th century. It is 800 metres north of Candi [[Prambanan]]. Candi Sewu is the second largest Buddhist temple complex after [[Borobudur]] temple. Candi Sewu complex consists of 249 temples, although it is called 'Candi Sewu' which means 'a thousand temples' (in Javanese language). This candi is very much related to famous local [[folklore]] of [[Loro Jonggrang]]. < ref > {{Citation|work=Harian Kompas via Youtube|title=Candi Sewu Mandala Suci Manjusrigrha|author1=Gunawan Kartapranata|author2=Septa Inigopatria|author3=Emille Junior|date=2015-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riCSpUwgoJQ|access-date=2022-03-08}} < /ref > < ref name= " Schliesinger " > {{cite book | title = Origin of Man in Southeast Asia 5: Part 2; Hindu Temples in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago | author = Joachim Schliesinger | publisher = Booksmango | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781633237308 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu9CwAAQBAJ & q=Manjusrigrha+inscription & pg=PA7 | page = 7}} < /ref >
