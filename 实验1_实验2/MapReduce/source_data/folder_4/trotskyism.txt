 '''Trotskyism''' is the form of [[communism]] that is based on the [[idea]]s of [[Leon Trotsky]]. Trotsky described himself as an  " [[Traditional|orthodox]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] " . This is a different way of seeing the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] than the way other communists like [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] saw them. The biggest difference is in Trotsky's idea that there needs to be an [[international]]  " [[permanent revolution]] " . Permanent revolution is the idea that proletarian revolution needed to spread in [[country|countries]] worldwide, even where [[capitalism]] was not as advanced as only the proletarian revolution could carry out the tasks of the unfinished bourgeois revolutions in these countries. This is different to the [[Stalinist]] idea of trying to preserve a single [[nation]]'s revolution from within. Trotsky also supported a less authoritarian government and more democracy.
