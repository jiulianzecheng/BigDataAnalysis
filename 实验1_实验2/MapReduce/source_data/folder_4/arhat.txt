 ==Meaning==

 ==Theravada== 
 The ultimate goal in Theravada Buddhism is to become an arhat. Someone who becomes an arhat is the same as someone who attains enlightenment. The Buddha is also sometimes called an  " arhat. " 
 
 ==Mahayana== 
 In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattvas are seen as better than arhats. A bodhisattva will eventually become a Buddha, who can teach all living beings. An arhat can teach too, but only achieves enlightenment for him or herself. < ref name= " Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119 " > Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism.
