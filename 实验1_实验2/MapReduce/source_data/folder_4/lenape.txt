 The '''Lenape''', '''Lenappe''', '''Lenapi''' or '''Lenni Lenape''' (meaning  " ''the people'' "  or  " ''true people'' " ) are a group of several bands of [[Native American]] people who share [[culture|cultural]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[wikt:trait|traits]].  They are also known as the '''[[Delaware]] Indians'''. They spoke two similar languages known as the Delaware languages: ''Unami'' and ''Munsee''.  The three subtribes of the Lenape are Munsee, Unami and Unalachtigo.  They lived in different regions in [[Pennsylvania]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=West Philadelphia Collaborative History - The Original People and Their Land: The Lenape, Pre-History to the 18th Century|url=https://collaborativehistory.gse.upenn.edu/stories/original-people-and-their-land-lenape-pre-history-18th-century|access-date=2022-08-10|website=collaborativehistory.gse.upenn.edu}} < /ref >    
 
 The Lenape lived in the part of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeast Woodlands]] called '''Lenapehoking''', roughly the area around and between the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and lower [[Hudson River]]s.  These areas are known today as the [[U.S. state]]s of [[New Jersey]], eastern [[Pennsylvania]] around the Delaware and Lehigh valleys. They also lived on the north shore of Delaware and much of southeastern [[New York]], mostly the lower [[Hudson Valley]] and Upper New York Bay. Nowadays most live in [[Oklahoma]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Ontario]].
