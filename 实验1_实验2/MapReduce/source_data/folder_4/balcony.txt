A '''balcony''' is a kind of [[floor]] at a certain height, which stands out from the [[building]]. Usually, there is some kind of [[balustrade]] so people do not fall off. 
 
 There is a possibility to protect the balcony with a glazing. So called balcony glazings are important for certain areas that are heavily influenced by weather or noise. Assemblers, which create designs and static evaluation for the balcony glazing, are necessary to integrate the glazing conform with regulations and laws. < ref > {{Cite web|date=21 August 2020|title=balcony glazing post-construction|url=https://scarabaeus-wintergarten.de/ratgeber/den-balkon-nachtraeglich-verglasen/|access-date=4 May 2021|website=Guide to balcony glazing after construction of balcony}} < /ref >  Because if the glazing is assembled in the wrong way, parts could fall off and damage property or persons. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Removal of glazing to the balcony|url=https://okna-otzyvy74.ru/vse-ob-oknah/osteklenie-balkona-i-lodzhij-s-vynosom/|access-date=|language=}} < /ref > 
 
 Unlike a terrace, balconies and also their balustrade need a [[Statics|static]] evaluation, so they don't take damage over time and can permanentely hold their visitors.
