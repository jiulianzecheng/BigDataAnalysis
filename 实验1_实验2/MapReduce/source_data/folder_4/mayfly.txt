 '''Mayflies''' are insects which belong to the [[Order (biology)|Order]] '''Ephemeroptera''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ephemeros'' = [[wikt:ephemeral|ephemeral]], or short-lived; ''pteron'' = [[wing]]). The name refers to the most distinctive features of the adults. They are in an ancient group of insects, the [[Palaeoptera]], ('Ancient wings') with [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]] and [[Damselfly|damselflies]]. < ref > They may not be a natural [[monophyletic]] group.Trueman J.W.H. 2008.

 There are over 3,000 living [[species]] of mayfly, in over 400 [[genera]] in 42 [[family (biology)|families]]. 
 
 == Egg stage == 
 At [[Sexual reproduction|mating]] the female lays her [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in the water. < ref name=Caucci29 > Al Caucci; Bob Nastasi; Art Flick; et al., ''Hatches II: A Complete Guide to the Hatches of North American Trout Streams'' (Guilford, CT: Lyon's Press, 2004), p. 29 < /ref >  They settle to the bottom where they stick to rocks, [[vegetation]] or the bottom of the [[stream]]. They range in size by the particular [[species]] of Mayfly. Depending on temperature, the eggs take from a few days to a year to develop: usually it is one to three months. < ref name=Caucci29/ >  During this [[embryonic]] stage the mouth, legs, tail and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] all develop. < ref name=Caucci29/ > 
 
 == Larva (or nymph) stage == 
 Mayfly are [[insect]]s whose [[aquatic]] [[larva]]e (called ''naiads'' or [[nymph]]s) live from several months up to a year, in freshwater. < ref name=Caucci29/ >  The naiads go through 20 or 30 [[Moulting|moults]] as they develop. 
   
 == Adult stage == 
 Mayflies are unique in that they moult one more time after getting functional wings (this is known as the ''alate'' stage). This second-to-last winged stage is usually very short, lasting from 30 minutes to one day, depending on the species. The function of the adult [[imago]] is [[reproduction]] and [[dispersal]]; they do not eat. The stage is a favorite food of many fish, and many 'fishing flies' are modeled on them. 
 
 == The hatch == 
 It often happens that all the mayflies in a population mature at once (called ''the hatch''). For a day or two in the Spring or Autumn (Fall), mayflies will be everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. < ref > Lewis Berner; Manuel L. Pescador, ''The Mayflies of Florida'' (Gainesville: University Presses of Florida, 1988), p. 132 < /ref >  The adults have various special features. Their rear wings are small or almost vestigial; the males have two long front legs for holding females, the rest have no function. Mating is usually in mid-air. The mayfly are quite a successful group. About 2,500 species are known worldwide, including about 630 species in [[North America]]. < ref name=Hoell > Hoell H.V; Doyen J.T.  &  Purcell A.H. 1998. ''Introduction to insect biology and diversity''. 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. p. 320. {{ISBN|0-19-510033-6}}. < /ref >  The hatch at [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]] has been a news event for several years. The hatch is so large it appears on weather radar. < ref name=USATODAY > {{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/news/2006-07-07-mayfly-radar_x.htm |title=Mayfly hatch shows up on weather radar near La Crosse, Wis. |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2006-07-07 |website= |publisher=USATODAY.com |accessdate=22 May 2014 |archive-date=2014-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727074312/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/news/2006-07-07-mayfly-radar_x.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The emerging mayflies land on everything and cover some areas like [[snow]]. < ref name=USATODAY/ >
