 '''Biodegradation''' is a [[Chemistry|chemical]] [[process]] in which [[material]]s are [[Dissolution|dissolved]] by [[bacteria]] or other [[Biology|biological]] elements. If a material is ''biodegradable'', it means that it can be consumed by [[microorganism]]s and turned into [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that are natural. It is an important process in [[ecology]] and [[waste management]]. Items that are biodegradable are considered [[environmentally friendly]] because they can turn back into elements found in nature. 
 
 [[Organic matter|Organic materials]], such as those that come from plants and animals, can be degraded [[Aerobic organism|aerobically]] (with [[oxygen]]) or [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobically]] (without oxygen). Some artificial or [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] materials can also be biodegraded. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Sims|first=G.K.|author2=A.M.

 In nature, different materials biodegrade at different speeds. Most microorganisms that help biodegradation need light, [[heat]], water and oxygen. < ref name= " W. B. Betts (ed.).
