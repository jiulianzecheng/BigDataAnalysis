 ==Story== 
 The young man Aladdin is told by a [[sorcerer]] (magician), who is pretending to be his uncle, to get him an [[oil lamp]] from a cave. Aladdin gets the lamp, but the sorcerer tries to trick him. So, Aladdin keeps the lamp for himself. Aladdin learns that inside the lamp there is a [[Genie|djinn]]. The djinn can fulfill every wish of the lamp's owner. With the djinn's help, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries a [[princess]].  
 
 The sorcerer returns and tricks Aladdin's wife into giving him the magic lamp. Aladdin finds out that in a [[ring]] he has, there is another djinn. This djinn helps Aladdin defeat the sorcerer, get back the magic lamp, and save his wife.

 * There is a film ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. It was shot in 1940. It was one of the first films to use [[Technicolor]].  
 * There is a [[Bollywood]] version ''Aladdin and [[Sinbad]]''. In it, both characters meet and participate in the adventures of each other. The djinn is female. In the end Aladdin marries her (rather than the princess). 
 * [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] also made a version of [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], who appeared in several adaptions. In the [[Aladdin (1992 film)|Disney film ''Aladdin'']], he is a smart young [[thief]] in the fictional city of [[Agrabah]]. He meets and falls in love with the Sultan's daughter, Jasmine, an independent soul who, much like Aladdin, wants to escape from her current life. Jafar, the Sultan's evil advisor, tricks Aladdin into helping him find a magic [[lamp]], which ends up with Aladdin and his monkey and friend, Abu. The lamp's occupant is a lunatic, shape-shifting [[genie]], who promises his master three wishes, and though he cannot make Jasmine fall in love with Aladdin – he can make things easier for him. By making Aladdin look like rich and handsome Prince Ali, Aladdin does not impress the Princess, and discovers that it was his true self she liked him all along. Using his own smartness and courage, Aladdin defeats Jafar and his evil plans, becoming a prince.
