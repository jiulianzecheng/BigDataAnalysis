 '''Puddingstone''' is a kind of [[sedimentary rock]]. It is formed when pebbles, perhaps from a [[shingle beach]], are [[cement]]ed together by [[silica]] coming out of [[solution]]. 
 
 The rock which forms is extremely hard and resistant to wear. It is used for grindstones and building. The pebbles are usually made of [[flint]], and both they and the [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] are made of silica.
