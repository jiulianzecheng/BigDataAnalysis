That they in fact spoke greek was implied by [[Herodotus]]' inclusion of Molossi among the Greek colonists of Asia Minor, but became demonstrable only when D. Evangelides published two long inscriptions of the Molossian State, set up p. 369 BC at [[Dodona]], in Greek and with Greek names, Greek patronymies and Greek tribal names such as Celaethi, Omphales, Tripolitae, Triphylae etc. As the Molossian cluster of tribes in the time of Hecataeus included the Orestae, Pelagones, Lyncestae, Tymphaei and Elimeotae, as we have argued above, we may be confindent that they too were Greek-speaking.

 Buthrotum was a city of the [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirote]] tribe of the [[Chaonians]]. It started declining in [[Late Antiquity]]. It later became abandoned during the [[Middle Ages]] after a major earthquake flooded most of the city.  
 
 It is now an [[Archaeology|archeological]] site in [[Vlorë County]], [[Albania]]. It is about 14 & nbsp;kilometres south of [[Sarandë]] and close to the [[Greece|Greek]] border. It is located on a hill overlooking the [[Vivari Channel]], and is part of the [[Butrint National Park]]. 
 
 == Directions == 
 The site of Butrint is accessible from [[Sarandë]]. Its road was first built in 1959 for a visit by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The road was improved during the summer of 2010.  
 
 The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster. It one point, it threatened Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination. It attracts day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30 & nbsp;minutes) and ferries (90 & nbsp;minutes) run daily between the New Port in [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] Town and Saranda.  
 
 Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarandë. A regular public bus service runs between Sarandë port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near [[Konispol]] and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.
