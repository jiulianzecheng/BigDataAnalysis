 '''Egoism''' is a [[philosophy]] about people [[wikt:serving|serving]] their own [[need]]s or [[want]]s. Some kinds of egoism say that everything people do is {{definition|egoistic|a person serving their own desires}}, meaning it is done to serve their own [[wikt:desire|desire]]s. Other kinds of egoism instead say that people should do whatever they want or whatever [[wikt:benefit|benefit]]s themselves. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |title=Egoism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/ |first=Robert |last=Shaver |year=2021 |editor=Edward N.

 Egoism is often seen as the opposite of [[altruism]], meaning the concern for others.  " Altruism "  is a word invented by a French thinker named [[Auguste Comte]]. He said that people should only serve each other and never be egoistic. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Altruism|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia|first=Timothy|last=Brosnahan|year=1907|via=New Advent|access-date=August 19, 2020|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01369a.htm }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Altriusm (ethics)|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=October 4, 2013|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/altruism-ethics }} < /ref >  But the German thinker [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] says that altruism is not the opposite of egoism. < ref name= " :2 " > Nietzsche, Friedrich.

 The American [[researcher]] James Scanlan says that when people do whatever benefits themselves it is only a [[wikt:fake|fake]] kind of egoism. And that real egoism is when people do whatever they want. Both are often seen as [[wikt:dangerous|dangerous]] beliefs. < ref > {{cite journal|title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's ''Notes from Underground''|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-the-history-of-ideas_1999-07_60_3/page/549|first=James P.|last=Scanlan|year=1999|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=60|number=3|pages=549–567|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|doi=10.2307/3654018|jstor=3654018}} < /ref >  Some egoists such as Max Stirner, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, and Dmitry Pisarev, are also thought of as [[nihilism|nihilists]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Pratt|first=Alan|title=Nihilism|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url-status=live|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/ |archive-date=2010-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412132711/http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/n/nihilism.htm }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Pisarev, Dmitry Ivanovich|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Russian History|access-date=August 11, 2020|via=Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/pisarev-dmitry-ivanovich }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Chernyshevskii, Nikolai Gavrilovich (1828–1889)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=August 11, 2020|via=Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/chernyshevskii-nikolai-gavrilovich-1828-1889 }} < /ref >  And [[Aleister Crowley]] was a British egoist who made the phrase  " Do what thou will "  popular. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Partridge|first=Christopher Hugh|year=2017|title=Aleister Crowley on Drugs|publisher=Equinox Publishing Ltd.|journal=International Journal for the Study of New Religions|volume=7|number=2|pages=125–151|issn=2041-9511|doi=10.1558/ijsnr.v7i2.31941|url=https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/84818/1/Crowley_on_Drugs.pdf|access-date=2020-12-11|archive-date=2020-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126130351/https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/84818/1/Crowley_on_Drugs.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Theories == 
 There are many different kinds of egoism: 
 
 * Ethical egoism is the belief that it is {{em|right}} for people to do whatever benefits themselves. {{crossreference|(See also: [[Ethics]])}} 
 * Default egoism is the belief that people {{em|mostly}} try to benefit themselves. 
 * Psychological egoism is the belief that people {{em|always}} try to benefit themselves, even when they don't know it. {{crossreference|(See also: [[Psychology]])}} 
 * Rational egoism is the belief that it {{em|makes the most sense}} for people to do whatever benefits themselves. {{crossreference|(See also: [[Rationality]])}} 
 
 == Moral psychology == 
 
 Some ideas of egoism can be studied in moral psychology. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|last=May|first=Joshua|title=Moral psychology, empirical work in|entry=Moral psychology, empirical work in|year=2012|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-L147-1|doi-access=free|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9780415250696|entry-url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/moral-psychology-empirical-work-in/v-1 }} < /ref >  For example, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] says that many people wrongly think that being  " [[good]] "  is related to not being egoistic. He says that this idea only appeared because [[priest]]ly [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] took over from [[noble]] values {{crossreference|(see {{slink|Master and slave philosophy|Nietzsche's explanation}})}}. < ref name= " :3 " / > < ref > {{cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=On the Genealogy of Morals|translator-last=Samuel|translator-first=Horace B.|series=The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche|volume=13}} < /ref >  Nietzsche says that the idea that actions are egoistic or altruistic is [[pseudoscience|pseudo-]] < nowiki/ > psychology. He says the truth is that  " there are no such things as egoistic and altruistic actions " . < ref name= " :4 " > {{cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Ecce Homo|translator-last=Ludovici|translator-first=Anthony M.|series=The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche|volume=17}} < /ref >  [[Morality]] tries to damage psychology with these false ideas, he says. < ref name= " :4 " / >  He also says that this kind of morality always serves the needs and wants of some people over others. < ref name= " :3 " / >  A British [[researcher]] named Alexander Moseley instead says that egoists don't believe psychology can understand people's [[motivation]]s. < ref name= " :1 " / >
