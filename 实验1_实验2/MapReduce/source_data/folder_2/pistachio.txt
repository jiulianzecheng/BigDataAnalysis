 The fruit is a [[stone fruit]]. Only the [[seed]] is edible. The fruit has a hard, cream-colored exterior shell. The seed has a mauve-colored skin and light green flesh. When the fruit ripens, the shell goes from green to yellow or red and splits a bit open. < ref > Towards a comprehensive documentation and use of Pistacia genetic diversity in Central and West Asia, North Africa and Europe, Report of the IPGRI Workshop, 14–17 December 1998, Irbid, Jordan – S.Padulosi and A.

 Pistachio trees can give {{convert|50|kg}} of seeds on average every two years. < ref > {{cite book |last=Nugent |first=Jeff |author2=Julia Boniface  |title=Permaculture Plants: A Selection |date=30 March 2005 |publisher=Permanent Publications |isbn=978-1-85623-029-2 |page=41 |chapter=Pistachio Nuts |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40n-Z_8ihZMC & pg=PA41 }} < /ref > 
 
 The shell of the pistachio is naturally a [[beige]] color, but it is sometimes dyed red or green. It is thought that [[dye]] was used by importers to hide stains on the shells when the seeds were picked by hand. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/30/what-are-red-pistachios_n_6570944.html|title=Remember Red Pistachios?
