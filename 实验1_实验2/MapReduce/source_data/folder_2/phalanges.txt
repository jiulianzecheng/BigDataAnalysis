[[File:Phalanges of the hand (left hand) - animation01.gif|thumb|upright|Phalanges of the left hand]] 
 '''Phalanges''' are [[bone]]s. There are 14 of them in each [[hand]] and [[foot]]. The phalanges (distal, middle and proximal) in the hand are the [[fingers]] and those in the feet are the [[toes]]. Human toe bones are usually shorter than the bones in the hand.
