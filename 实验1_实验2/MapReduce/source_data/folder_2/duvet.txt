A '''duvet''' is a type of bedding used as a [[blanket]], on a [[bed]]. They are normally made of a cotton cover, filled with [[feather]]s and down or man-made fibres such as polyester, microfibre and hollowfibre. They are soft and comfortable, and keeps the person who's under it warm when sleeping. Additional bed throws (sometimes called a 'snug') may be added in the autumn/fall to add an extra layer of warmth.

 The thickness of the duvet is measured by a tog rating. The higher the tog, the warmer the duvet will be. The warmest duvet on the market is currently a 15 tog. < ref > {{cite web |title=Duvet Tog Guide |url=https://www.dormeo.co.uk/duvet-tog-guide#:~:text=The%20higher%20the%20tog%20rating,is%20usually%20around%2013.5%20tog. |website=Doremo |accessdate=26 November 2021}} < /ref >  Most people who have heated houses will use a 4.5 tog duvet all year round, but sometimes in the autumn/winter people will upgrade to either a 7.0 or a 9.0 tog.
