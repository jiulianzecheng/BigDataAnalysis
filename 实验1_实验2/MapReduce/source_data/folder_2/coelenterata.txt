'''Coelenterata''' was the name for an [[animal]] [[phylum]]. It is not used now. It was broken down into two separate phyla: the [[Cnidaria]] (jellyfish) and the [[Ctenophora]] (comb jellies). This change was made on the evidence of [[molecular evolution]]. This makes use of [[protein]] [[amino acid]] sequences, and whole [[genome]] [[DNA]] analysis. < ref name= " Arthur " > Arthur, Wallace 1997.
