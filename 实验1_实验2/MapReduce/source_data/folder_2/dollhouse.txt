 A '''dollhouse''' (or '''doll house''') is a [[toy]] [[home]] made in miniature. Dollhouses have been mainly for children. Making and collecting them, however, is also a [[hobby]] for many adults. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the term ''dollhouse'' is used. In the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''doll's house'' is used. 
 
 Early dollhouses were seen more than 400 years ago as ''baby house'' display cases in [[Europe]]. Smaller dollhouses that looked like real houses on the outside appeared in Europe in the 18th century. 
 
 Early dollhouses were hand-made. After the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[World War II]], doll houses were [[mass production|mass produced]]. They became more standard and cost less to buy. 
 
 Mass-produced dollhouses include those related to the [[Barbie]] doll. < ref > {{cite web|title=Top 6 Barbie Dollhouses|publisher=Cool Doll Houses|url=https://cooldollhouses.com/best-barbie-doll-houses|access-date=May 30, 2019|archive-date=May 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530121954/https://cooldollhouses.com/best-barbie-doll-houses/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
