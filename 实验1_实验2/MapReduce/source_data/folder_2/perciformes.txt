 The '''Perciformes'''  < ref > also called the '''Percomorphi''' or '''Acanthopteri''' < /ref >  is the largest [[order (biology)|order]] of [[vertebrata|vertebrates]]. They have about 40% of all [[bony fish]]. < ref > Long, John A. 1995. ''The rise of fishes: 500 million years of evolution''. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. < /ref > < sup > p151 < /sup >    
 
 ''Perciformes'' means ''[[perch]]-like''. They belong to the [[class (biology)|class]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] and have over 7,000 [[species]] in almost all aquatic environments. 
 
 They have the widest range of sizes of any order of vertebrates, ranging from the 7 & nbsp;mm ''[[Schindleria brevipinguis]]'' to the 5 metre ''[[Makaira]]'' species. They first appeared and diversified in the Upper [[Cretaceous]]. 
 
 Some well-known members of this group are [[angelfish]], [[barracuda]], [[Bass (fish)|bass]], [[blenny]], [[cichlid]]s, [[damselfish]], [[filefish]], [[goby]], [[grouper]], [[remora]], [[swordfish]], [[mackerel]], [[pufferfish]], [[tilefish]], [[tuna]], [[whiting]], and of course [[perch]].

 The [[dorsal]] and anal [[fin]]s are divided into front spiny and back soft-rayed portions, which may be partially or completely separated.  
 
 The [[pelvic]] fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays, positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly. Scales are usually [[ctenoid]] (rough-edged).  
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 They are grouped as in the text ''[[Fishes of the World]]''. The order is probably [[polyphyletic]], and changes may occur in this and other teleost orders. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Search FishBase|url=https://www.fishbase.de/|access-date=2022-04-07|website=www.fishbase.de|archive-date=2021-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210513153625/https://www.fishbase.de/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | title = Fishes of the World | last = Nelson | first = Joseph, S. | publisher = Wiley | year = 2006 | isbn = 0471250317}} < /ref > < ref > {{ITIS |id=161061 |taxon=Actinopterygii |accessdate=3 April 2006}} < /ref > 
 
 Recent [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]] has shown that several of the higher-level groupings of [[teleost]]s are [[evolution]]ary grades rather than [[clade]]s. Examples of demonstrably [[paraphyletic]] groups include the Perciformes. < ref > [http://www.tolweb.org/Percomorpha/52146 G.D. Johnson and E.O. Wiley 2006. ''Tree of life: Percomorpha''] < /ref >
