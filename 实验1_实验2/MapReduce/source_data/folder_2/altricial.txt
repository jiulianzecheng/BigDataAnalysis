 '''Altricial''', meaning  " requiring care " , refers to a group or kind of creature that is incapable of moving around on its own soon after hatching or being born. The word is derived from the [[Latin]] root ''alere'' meaning  " to nurse, to rear, or to nourish " , which means that young has to be taken care of for a long time before it can overcome its helplessness. < ref name=EDW > {{cite book | last = Ehrlich | first = Paul | title = The Birder's Handbook | url = https://archive.org/details/birdershandbookf00ehrl_0 | publisher = Simon  &  Schuster | location = New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-671-65989-8 }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Bird]]s or [[mammal]]s which need much less care after birth are called [[precocial]], meaning they are precocious.
