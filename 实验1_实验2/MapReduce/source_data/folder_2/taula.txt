 A '''taula''' ('table' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is a stone monument in the shape of a T. It is found on the [[Balearic Islands]] of [[Minorca]]. They were built by the [[Talaiotic culture]] sometime between 1000 BC and 300 BC. Their meaning is unknown but it was probably made for either religious and/or astronomical purposes. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://gospain.about.com/od/menorca/tp/prehistoric_sites_menorca.htm|accessdate=2014-06-04|title=Prehistoric Menorca|publisher=Go Spain|archive-date=2014-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713013626/http://gospain.about.com/od/menorca/tp/prehistoric_sites_menorca.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
