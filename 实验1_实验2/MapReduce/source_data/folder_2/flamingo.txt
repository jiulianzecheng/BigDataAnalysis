 '''Flamingos''' ({{Audio|Br-Flamingo.ogg|listen}}) are types of [[bird]]s. They are noisy birds and they live in big groups called flocks. Flamingos are [[wading bird]]s. This means they live by water, such as lakes.  
 
 They are in the [[genus]] '''''Phoenicopterus''''' and [[family (biology)|family]] '''Phoenicopteridae'''. There are six [[species]] of flamingo. Two of species are found in [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The other four are found in [[North America]] and [[South America]].   
 
 Flamingos are pink or red. This is because of small [[bacteria]] that live in water which the flamingos eat. This small bacteria is known as [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2389827 carotenoids]. This is a pigment that causes the plumage color you see on flamingos. They also eat small crayfish and algae. Baby flamingos are gray. Flamingos can fly. This is why they have wings. Flamingos are very tall birds and they have long [[leg]]s. They often stand on only one leg. Scientsts found that they do this beacuse it takes less energy than standing on two legs. Flamingos have a curved bill that is shaped like a [[banana]]. This is because they feed in the mud on the bottom of lakes. 
 Flamingos can weigh up to 4 kg and be up to 145cm tall. They live up to around 47 years. < ref > Hannover Zoo: [http://www.zoo-hannover.de/explore-the-zoo/animals-a-z/flamingo.html?L=1#steckbrief Flamingo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713133654/http://www.zoo-hannover.de/explore-the-zoo/animals-a-z/flamingo.html?L=1#steckbrief |date=2012-07-13 }}, viewed 2012-12-06 < /ref > 
 
 == Conservation== 
 Many flamingos that live in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] are dying. Scientists do not know why. They think it may be because of bacteria in the water.
