 '''Pansexual''' people are people [[sexual attraction|attracted]] to people regardless of their [[sex]] or [[gender]]. This is similar to many [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people. The word ''pansexual'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word 'pan-', meaning  " all " .     
 
 Although the sexuality overlaps with [[bisexuality]], both labels are accepted as long as the person is comfortable and respects the other equally.  
 
 Originally, [[Sigmund Freud]] invented the word  " [[:en:Pansexualism|pansexual]] " , regarding the hypothesis  " that regards all desire and interest as derived from [the] sex instinct " . 
 
 Pansexuality is often described as â€˜attraction to people regardless of [[gender]] (including those who may not identify as boys or girls or as men or women, or to those who are [[intersex]], genderfluid, etc.) pansexuality can also be described as  " gender blind " . 
 
 Some may describe it as  " gender blind "  because those who identify as pansexual do not consider gender important when they are attracted to others. Pansexuality is considered the opposite of [[asexuality]], as pansexuality means a person may be sexually attracted to anyone regardless of their gender identity, but asexuality means a person is sexually attracted to no one. However, pansexuals are not necessarily sexually attracted to everyone they meet, nor do they necessarily have strong sex drives. 
 
 The pansexual colors from the pride flag all have different meanings, pink meaning attraction to fem presenting people, blue attraction to masculine presenting people, and yellow for people (for an example) of a non-binary gender, such as [[agender]], [[bigender]] or [[genderfluid]].
