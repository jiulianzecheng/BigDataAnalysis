 In [[physics]], '''buoyancy (lit: float force)''' ({{pron-en|ˈbɔɪ.ənsi}}) is a [[Force (physics)|force]] on an object making that object rise or move upward. It comes from the Spanish word for  " float " , ''boyar''. Buoyancy is made by the difference in [[pressure]] put on the object by the [[Fluid]] or [[air]] that the object is in. 
 
 The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the magnitude of the [[weight]] of fluid that is displaced by the body. This force enables the object to float or at least to seem lighter. Buoyancy is important for many [[vehicle]]s such as [[boat]]s, [[ship]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s, and [[airship|blimp]]s.   
 
 ==Density== 
 If the object has exactly the same density as the [[liquid]], then its buoyancy is the same as its weight. It will not sink or float. 
 
 If the object has a higher average density than the liquid, then its buoyancy is less than its weight. It will sink. That is why pebbles do not float.  
 
 If the object has a lower average density than the liquid, then its buoyancy is greater than its weight. That is why, although a ship may be made of [[steel]] which is more dense than water, it floats because it encloses a [[volume]] of air and the resulting shape has an average density less than that of the water.
