 The family '''Cyperaceae''', or the '''sedges''', is a [[taxon]] of [[flowering plant]]s. They look like [[grass]]es or [[rushes]], but are not. They are [[monocot]] plants (as are grasses), but belong to a different [[family (biology)|family]]. < ref > " Cyperaceae " . Plants of the World Online. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. [https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30000197-2] < /ref >   
 
 The family is large, with some 5,500 species described in about 109 [[genus|genera]]. < ref > Govaerts R. 2007. ''World Checklist of Cyperaceae: Sedges''.

 Sedges include many wild [[marsh]] and grassland plants, and some cultivated ones such as water chestnut (''[[Eleocharis dulcis]]'') and [[papyrus]] sedge (''[[Cyperus papyrus]]''). These species are widely distributed, with many in [[tropical]] [[Asia]] and tropical [[South America]]. Sedges may be found growing in almost all environments. Many are [[wetlands]], or have poor soils. [[Community (ecology)|Ecological communities]] dominated by sedges are known as sedgelands. 
 
 Members of the sedge family have stems with triangular cross-sections (there are occasional exceptions). Their leaves are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks). < ref name= " backyardnature " > {{cite web | url=http://www.backyardnature.net/fl_caryx.htm|title=Grasslike non-grasses }} < /ref > < ref > Ball P.W; Reznicek A.A.  &  Murray D.F.
