 '''Malaria''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by a [[parasite]]: it is spread by the bite of an infected [[mosquito]]. People catch malaria when the parasite enters the [[blood]]. The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid-1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% Indian population lives in malaria risk areas. 
 
 Malaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most '''common health problems'''. As per latest WHO estimates (2011)* between 149 and 274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa. This amounts to one malaria death every minute. In India, the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). 
 
 The parasite that causes malaria is a [[protozoa]]n called ' < nowiki/ > '''Plasmodium''''. Protozoa are organisms with only one [[cell]], but they are not [[bacteria]]. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans. 
 
 People usually get malaria from the ''[[Anopheles]]'' or [https://www.healthtipsagency.com/2018/09/malaria-symptomas-tratment-and-prevention.html ''Culex'' mosquitoes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228001032/https://www.healthtipsagency.com/2018/09/malaria-symptomas-tratment-and-prevention.html |date=2019-02-28 }}: they are the [[Vector (biology)|vector]]s of the disease. The ''Plasmodium'' gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The ''Plasmodium'' is in the mosquito's special saliva. < ref > Saliva is moisture, or spit, made in the mouth. < /ref >  The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with ''Plasmodium'' as a by-product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria. 
 
 Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the [[nectar]] of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of [[protein]] for its eggs. 
 
 Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called ''maternal-foetal transmission''. People can also get malaria from a [[blood transfusion]]. This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a [[needle]] that someone with the disease used before them.

 }} 
 There are several [[species]] (kinds) of ''Plasmodium'' that cause malaria in humans: 
 * serious disease: 
 ** ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' < ref > [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/ WHO  & #124; Malaria] < /ref > 
 * milder disease: 
 ** ''Plasmodium malariae'' 
 ** ''Plasmodium ovale'' 
 ** ''Plasmodium vivax'' 
 * species which normally infect other [[primate]]s: 
 ** ''Plasmodium knowesli'' 
 
 ''P. vivax'' and ''P. falciparum'' cause the most malaria in people. ''Falciparum'' malaria is the worst kind, and kills the most people. 
 
 When ''Plasmodium'' enters the blood, they are then called ''sporozoites''. Sporozoites go to the [[liver]], where they make many more sporozoites. Then they change into a different form of ''Plasmodium''. This form is the ''merozoite''. The merozoites go into the [[red blood cell]]s, then they make many more merozoites. 
 
 The merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again. When they do this, the person gets very sick, and shows symptoms of malaria. This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm. 
 
 ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' can live in the liver for a long time. A person can look well, but still have the ''Plasmodium'' in the liver. This is called a ''dormant phase''. Weeks or months later, the ''Plasmodium'' can leave the liver to the blood, and the person will get sick again. 
 
 ''P. falciparum'' is the most dangerous type of malaria. It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria, because there are more of them in the blood. Also, with ''falciparum'' malaria, the red blood cells are sticky. This makes the red blood cells block [[blood vessel]]s. If blood vessels are blocked, this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to, and can hurt people's [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

 Pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria. When they get malaria, they get sicker. 
 
 40% of people live in a place where there is malaria. Malaria is in these places: 
 * [[Africa]] 
 * [[Asia]] (mostly in [[India]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]) 
 * [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] 
 * [[Hispaniola]] 
 * [[Eastern Europe]] 
 * [[South Pacific]] (the part of the [[Pacific Ocean]] south of the [[equator]]) 
 
 Every year, 300 to 700 million people get malaria. It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa. Most of the people who die from malaria are children. Even if children do not die, many have [[brain]] damage. 
 
 Many of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control. But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries. These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes, or to give people medicine. Money, however, is not the only problem. A country must have an organised medical system to provide services. Many countries in central Africa have been disrupted by [[war]]fare and [[conflict]] between groups, and general unrest. Also, easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did 50 years ago. This is because the insects are resistant to many [[insecticide]]s, and the ''Plasmodium'' parasite is highly resistant to [[quinine]] and most other common drugs. This is a normal [[evolution]]ary process: the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms, and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply. 
 
 == Signs and symptoms of malaria == 
 [[File:Jaundice eye.jpg|thumb| < center > '''Jaundice''' < /center > Malaria can cause ''jaundice'', which causes the skin and the white areas of the eyes (''sclerae'') to turn orange-yellow.

 Symptoms are changes in someone's body that are signs for a disease. Most people who get malaria get symptoms 10–30 days after they get infected (the ''Plasmodium'' gets in their blood.) But some people can get symptoms after only a week, and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year. 
 
 The most common symptom of malaria is [[fever]], when the body temperature is high. The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly. The people who have malaria often feel like they had [[influenza]]. 
 
 Symptoms of malaria are: 
 * Arthralgia (pain in [[joint]]s) 
 * Headache (pain in head) 
 * Feeling very tired or sleepy 
 * Cough 
 * Chills (feeling very cold) 
 * [[Delirium]] (when people are very confused because of a disease. They may look drunk. They may not be able to talk.) 
 * [[Coma]] (when people are not [[consciousness|conscious]]. They look like they are asleep, but they cannot be woken. ) 
 Signs of malaria: 
 * [[Anemia]] (low [[red blood cell]] levels in the blood) 
 * Diarrhea 
 * [[Jaundice]] (yellow skin and eyes) 
 * [[Sweat]]ing 
 * [[Vomit]]ing 
 * Fast [[heart]] rate 
 * Low [[blood pressure]] 
 * Enlarged organs. When something becomes enlarged or BIGGER than normal the word often ends in -megaly. 
 ** Hepatomegaly -enlarged [[liver]], splenomegaly - enlarged [[spleen]], or both hepatosplenomegaly. When these organs become enlarged it may cause pain in the [[Right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant of the abdomen]]. 
 
 == Complications from malaria == 
 Complications are problems that happen because of a disease. 
 
 Pregnant women and young children have more complications. People who get malaria for the first time have more complications. ''Falciparum'' malaria has the most complications.

 Complications of malaria are: 
 * Cerebral malaria (brain malaria) 
 ** To have cerebral malaria, the following must be present: 
 *** ''P. falciparum'' in the blood. 
 *** Coma, many [[seizure]]s, or long delirium 
 *** If no treatment is given, death often occurs. 
 *** Even if treatment is given, 15%-20% of people with it die. 
 * Seizures (if ''only'' one seizure happens it is not cerebral malaria) 
 * Damage to the [[brain]] 
 * Blackwater fever 
 ** Many red blood cells break open and the [[hemoglobin]] in the cells gets into the blood. 
 ** This hemoglobin is put in the urine and makes it look very dark. 
 ** Without the right care this can make the [[kidney]]s stop working. 
 * Pulmonary oedema 
 ** This is fluid in the lungs that makes it hard to breathe. 
 ** Pregnant women get this much more. 
 ** 80% of people who get this complication die. 
 * Very low blood sugar 
 ** Children and pregnant women get this more. 
 ** This can cause people to look like they are drunk or to be in a coma. 
 * Hemolysis 
 ** This means breakdown of red blood cells. 
 ** It can cause blackwater fever, [[jaundice]], and symptoms of [[anemia]]. 
 * Coagulopathy (not being able to stop bleeding)

 === Clinical diagnosis === 
 A clinical diagnosis is based on the [[Signs and symptoms (medicine)|signs and symptoms]] of a disease, it is a diagnosis made without medical testing. In the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever. 
 
 Any clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible. < ref > Pfeiffer K. ''et al.'' 2008. Clinical diagnosis of malaria and the risk of chloroquine self-medication in rural health centres in Burkina Faso. ''Tropical Medicine  &  International Health''. '''13''': 418–426. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02017.x PMID 18397402 < /ref > 
 
 === Malaria rapid diagnostic test === 
 A Malaria rapid diagnostic test is a [[blood test]] which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes. RDTs are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks, and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary. 
 
 === Malaria microscopy === 
 To see if patients have malaria, doctors may do a blood test. This test is called a ''Giemsa blood smear''. Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass. The ''Giemsa'' stain is put on the slide. This stain helps doctors see the malaria. Then they look at the slide under a [[microscope]]. The ''Plasmodium'' is seen in the [[red blood cell]]s. 
 
 == Treatment == 
 [[File:Mefloquine-resistant malaria in Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|160px| < center > '''Drug resistant malaria''' < /center > Malaria [[evolves]] [[resistance to antibiotics|resistance to anti-malarial drugs]]. 
 The map shows areas in SE Asia where the drug ''Mefloquine'' no longer works]] 
 
 People with different kinds of malaria need different medicines. The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind. So it is very important to know which [[species]] of ''Plasmodium'' the person has. 
 
 If the species is not known, the person should be given medicine and care like they have ''falciparum'' malaria {{ndash}} the worst kind. 
 
 It is also important to know ''where'' the person got malaria. ''Plasmodium'' in some places is resistant to some medicines. So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America. 
 
 === Treatment of malaria other than ''falciparum'' === 
 Everywhere except [[New Guinea]], the treatment is the same. In New Guinea most ''P. vivax'' is resistant to ''chloroquine''. It can be treated with [[quinine]], but this medicine can make people sick. Everywhere else, non-''falciparum'' malaria is treated with chloroquine. 
 
 Chloroquine kills the ''Plasmodium'' in the blood. But the ''Plasmodium'' in the liver is not killed by chloroquine. ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' both stay in the liver a ''long'' time. This is the ''dormant phase''. Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale''. This is to kill the ''Plasmodium'' in the liver. The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is ''primaquine''. In southeast Asia, some ''P. vivax'' is resistant to primaquine. Most other places, ''primaquine'' works very well. 
 
 Some people get very sick from ''primaquine''. So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD-deficiency before they take ''primaquine''. 
 
 === Treatment of ''falciparum'' malaria === 
 Falciparum is the worst kind of malaria. People with ''falciparum'' malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are: 
 * Very sick 
 * Children 
 * [[Pregnant]] 
 * Having malaria for the first time 
 * Not able to take medicines by mouth 
 
 Even people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8 & nbsp;hours. This is to make sure they do not get sicker.It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth. Malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated. 
 
 ''Falciparum'' malaria also has more resistance to medicines. This makes it much harder to treat. ''Falciparum'' malaria is always treated with two or more medicines. Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria. Different places have ''P. falciparum'' that is resistant to different medicines. 
 
 The most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance. In some places in the world, ''P. falciparum'' is killed by chloroquine. In some places it is chloroquine-resistant. This means chloroquine does not kill it. In these places quinine can be used. Quinine is taken by mouth. 
 
 == How to prevent malaria == 
 [[File:Malaria prevention-Insecticide treated bed net-PMI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) helps reduce the risk of getting malaria. 
 Only pyrethroid insecticides are approved for use on ITNs. These are man-made pesticides similar to the natural pesticide pyrethrum, made by [[chrysanthemum]] flowers]] 
 
 There are three ways to prevent malaria: 
 * Control mosquitoes 
 * Keep mosquitoes from biting 
 * Take medicine to keep from getting sick after a bite, especially in those parts of the world where people get malaria. 
 
 === Control mosquitoes === 
 [[File:Oxfam East Africa - Clearing drainage ditches.jpg | thumb|right |250px|Clearing drainage ditches in Kenya]] 
 [[File:Anopheles larve.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Anopheles larvae''' The anopheles mosquito lays eggs in stagnant water]] 
 
 ''[[Vector]] control'' is one way to stop malaria. Vector means an [[organism]] that carries an [[infectious disease]] to another organism. For malaria, the vector is the ''Anopheles'' mosquito. 
 
 The most used method of vector control is [[pesticide]]s. These are chemicals that kill the mosquito. The first pesticide used for vector control was [[DDT]]. DDT worked very well for vector control. It killed mosquitoes. It did not make people very sick at the time it was used. It did not cost very much money. Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet. 
 
 In many places mosquitoes became resistant to DDT. This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas. Scientists worried that DDT was making people and animals sick. It killed a lot of wildlife too. DDT also stays in the [[environment]] for a long time. For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control. ''Organophosphate'' or ''carbonate'' pesticides are used, like ''malathion'' or ''bendiocarb''. 
 
 Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria. And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control. The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods. In some places, DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria. This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria. 
 
 === Keeping mosquitoes from biting === 
 The mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn (when the sun comes up) and dusk (when the sun goes down.) Be most careful at these times. Wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves. Wear mosquito repellent (this is a [[chemical]] that mosquitoes do not like, so they do not bite.) Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth. So repellent should be used on skin ''and clothes''. 
 
 Pesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes. When sleeping outside, people use a mosquito net. This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out. It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out. Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping. It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin, which repels and kills mosquitoes. 
 
 === Taking medicine to not get sick === 
 People can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria. This reduces the chances that they contract malaria. This is called ''[[prophylaxis]]''. 
 
 Some people take prophylactic medicines for years. Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine. 
 
 People who live where there is no malaria usually have ''not'' had malaria. The first case malaria is usually much worse. So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria. The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are. This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place. 
 
 To make them work best, prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way. The medicine should start ''before'' going to an area with malaria. Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home. One medicine (Malarone) only needs to be used for ''one'' week after coming home. 
 
 == Resistance to malaria == 
 There are some children in [[Tanzania]] who are naturally [[immune]] to malaria. Researchers are using this to develop a new [[vaccine]]. U.S. researchers have found the children produce an [[antibody]] which attacks the malaria-causing parasite. Injecting a form of this antibody into [[mice]] protected the animals from the disease. The researchers plan to do tests on [[primate]]s, including humans. < ref > Morelle, Rebecca 2014. Immune children aid malaria vaccine hunt. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment.

 The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. This tree grows on the slopes of the [[Andes]], mainly in [[Peru]].

 In the early 20th century, before [[antibiotics]] became available, [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]] discovered that patients with [[syphilis]] could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria.
