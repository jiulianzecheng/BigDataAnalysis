 '''Leatherhead''' is a town in [[Surrey]], England, on the right bank of the River Mole, and at the edge of the contiguous built-up area of [[London]]. Its local district is Mole Valley. Records exist of the place from Anglo Saxon England. It has a combined theatre and cinema, which is at the centre of the re-modelling following late 20th century pedestrianisation.
