A '''crisis''' is a situation which is difficult, unexpected, or an [[emergency]]. It is often an important  " turning point " , where a [[decision]] must be taken, affecting many people. Very often, this decision must be taken in relatively little time. The word is related to the Greek ''κρίσις'' (krisis). Examples include the sudden threat of [[war]], or the occurrence of a [[natural disaster]]. 
 
 According to Steven Fink, a crisis manager, crises may:  
 # be difficult to control  
 # the focus of [[mass media]], or [[government]] attention 
 # interfere with regular business  
 
 Crises occur in different fields. People may develop [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], because they cannot deal with a crisis situation. Many countries and associations offer [[crisis hotline|help lines]], which can help people deal with a crisis situation.
