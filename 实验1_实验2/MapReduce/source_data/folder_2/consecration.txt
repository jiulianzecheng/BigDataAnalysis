 '''Consecration''' is a special ceremony, usually [[religious]], in which a person, or an object or a [[building]] is [[dedication|dedicated]] to a special purpose.  When a new [[church]] is built there will be a special opening ceremony, called a  " consecration " . In many religions '''ordination''' is how individuals are consecrated (ordained) as a minister. 
 
 The [[verb]] is '''to consecrate'''.  The [[adjective]] is '''consecrated'''. 
 
 *A [[synonym]] (another word) for consecration is '''sanctification''' ([[verb]]: to '''sanctify'''). 
 *An [[antonym]] (the opposite) is '''desecration''' ([[verb]]: to '''desecrate''') (for example when people smash holy things in a church). 
 * A related word is '''deconsecration''', also called secularization. it is the act of reversing the consecration from something that had been previously consecrated. A church building which is no longer to be used as a church is sometimes deconsecrated, thus making it suitable for secular use.  
 
 
 The word  " consecration "  is used in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] as the setting apart for the service of God of both persons and objects. The ordination of a new [[bishop]] is also called a consecration. The life of those who enter religious orders (for example: [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s) is also described as  " Consecrated Life " .  
 
 In [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox]] churches, only men are chosen to be [[priest]]s. But in many [[Protestant]] [[denomination]]s, including the [[Church of England]], women are allowed take leadership roles. (See [[Liberal Christianity]]) Some major Protestant denominations however, like the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] take a more [[conservative]] and [[traditional]] view of women. Various religious groups have different terminology for the recognition of persons who take special roles in the religion. The word  " consecration "  is sometimes used to recognize persons who would not be accepted for  " ordination " .
