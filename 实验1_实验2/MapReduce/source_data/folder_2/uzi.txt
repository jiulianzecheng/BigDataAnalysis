 The '''Uzi''' is a type of [[submachine gun]] (SMG). It is famous for being very small and easy to carry, much more easily than any SMG made in [[World War II]]. It does this by loading [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] inside the grip, much like a [[pistol]]. It was not the first submachine gun to do this, but the Uzi was the first used on a large scale.   
 
 There are different kinds of Uzis: Mini Uzi, which is a smaller version of the Uzi; Micro Uzi, which is only slightly larger than a standard [[pistol]]; Para Micro Uzi, which was made for [[Counter Terrorist Unit]]s; and the Uzi Pistol, which is semi-automatic (it fires one bullet every time you pull the trigger).  All of these kinds of Uzis are still in use by the special forces today. It is slowly being replaced by the [[MP-5]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Uzis were invented by an [[Israeli]] army officer, Uziel Gal. < ref name=uzi > {{cite web |url=http://www.uzi.com/history.html |title=The Uzi official website |first= |last= |work=uzi.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |archive-date=5 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005024625/http://www.uzi.com/history.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This gun was first used in 1956. Uzis were used in the 1967 [[Six Day War]] by [[Israel]]. They are made by Israel Military Industries and also by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] weapon company, FN. < ref name=uzi/ > 
 
 Even though Uziel Gal told his manufacturers not to name the weapon after him, they ignored his request and did so anyway.
