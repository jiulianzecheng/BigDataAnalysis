''''Basal'''' is a term in [[biology]] for 'primitive' or 'ancestral'. Basal is preferred because it is neutral and non-judgmental. This terminology came into use with [[cladistics]]. The term is used in [[evolution]] and [[classification]] to mean the group which gave rise to later forms. It is a term which works at any level: a basal [[species]] gives rise to '''derived''' species, and a basal group gives rise to derived groups. 
 
 ''''Derived'''' is the correct term in [[biology]] for ''specialised'' or ''advanced''. It is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group. A '''derived trait''' is a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] that is present in an organism, but was not in the last [[common ancestor]] of the group being considered. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. < ref name=Clark1999 > {{Cite journal | last = Clark | first = C.G. | year = 1999 | title = The effect of secondary loss on our views of eukaryotic evolution | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = 196 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–388 | doi = 10.2307/1542976 | url = http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/reprint/196/3/385.pdf | publisher = Marine Biological Laboratory | jstor = 1542976| pmid = 28296494 }} < /ref >  For example, no [[mitochondria]] in the anaerobic [[protist]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' is a result of their secondary loss. 
 
 ;General view – 
 *Basal group 
 **Derived group 
 **Derived group 
 **Derived group 
 
 ;Example – 
 *Early [[primate]]s 
 **[[Monkey]]s 
 ***[[Ape]]s 
 ****''[[Homo]]'' 
 
 In the last example, note that apes are ''derived'' from monkeys but ''basal'' with respect to our own [[genus]]. The status of being basal or derived is relative, though living species can only be derived. In any basal-derived pair, the basal member must have evolved before the derived member, with evidence that some of its species gave rise to (evolved into) the derived member. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/treeinterpret.html|title=Interpreting the tree diagram or list of subgroups on a Tree of Life page|publisher=Tree of Life web project}} < /ref >

 *Ancestral taxon = basal group 
 *Characters or attributes: 
 **[[Plesiomorphy]] = ancestral [[trait]] inherited from earlier forms. 
 **[[Apomorphy]] =  trait or innovation derived from a plesiomorphic character. It may define a clade. 
 **[[Synapomorphy]] = a trait or character of a whole clade.
