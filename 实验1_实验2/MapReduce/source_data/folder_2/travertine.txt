 '''Travertine''' is a [[Land|terrestrial]] [[sedimentary rock]]. It is a natural chemical [[precipitation|precipitate]] of [[carbonate]] [[mineral]]s; [[aragonite]] or [[calcite]]. This happens from solution in ground and surface waters, and/or  [[hot spring|geothermally heated hot-springs]]. < ref > ''Dictionary of geological terms'', 1962.
