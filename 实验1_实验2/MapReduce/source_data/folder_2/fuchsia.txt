 '''''Fuchsia''''' is a [[genus]] of flowering [[plant]]s. They are often [[Purple|purplish]]-[[red]], which is where we get the colour '' [[Magenta#Tones of fuchsia color comparison chart|fuchsia]]''.  
 
 Fuchsia belongs to the [[Onagraceae]] family of flowering plants. Fuchsia has 110 species. It consists mostly of [[shrubs]] or small trees.  
 
 The first, ''[[Fuchsia triphylla]]'', was discovered on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]) about 1696–1697. The discoverer was the French [[monk]] and [[botanist]], [[Charles Plumier]], during his third expedition to the [[Greater Antilles]]. He named the new genus after the German [[botanist]] [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501–1566). < ref > Charles Plumier. ''Nova Plantarum Americanum Genera'', Paris, 1703. < /ref >
