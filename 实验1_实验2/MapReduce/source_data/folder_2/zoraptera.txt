 '''Zoraptera''' is an order of [[insect]]s, is one of the least diverse and most poorly understood insect lineages. Zoraptera are minute, hemimetabolous insects superficially resembling barklice ([[Psocoptera]]) or [[termite]]s (Isoptera).  
 
 == Description == 
 Individuals are generally less than 3 mm in total body length, exclusive of their antennae, and are gregarious. Overall, zorapterans are quite homogenous in their morphology and tend to be off-white (mostly nymphs) to brown in color. Individuals of each species occur in two morphs: eyed and winged forms that then shed their wings after dispersal or blind and apterous forms that predominate in colonies.
