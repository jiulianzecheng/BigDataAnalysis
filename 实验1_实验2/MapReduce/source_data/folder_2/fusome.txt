'''Fusome''' is a term from [[microbiology]] that describes a way different [[cell]]s communicate with each other. Fusomes are simple openings, or pores, in the walls of certain types of cells. These allow certain [[chemical compound]]s to pass through.

 {{Quote|1=“'''Fusome''' (Hirschler 1948) –  intercellular bridges in various tissues wich  undergo a common synchnonous development. Unlike the other intrcellular complexes such as → desmosomes and → plasmodesmata,  the fusomes merely  consist  single, large annular openings in the cell wall. Electrom microscope observations support the theory that these bridges allow the free passage of cytoplasmic  materials,  including the mitochondria. The fusomes are probably the result of  incomplete cell division where  the annual furrow of the  spindle residual-body does not divide completely durig  → cytokinesis. The fusosomes show a strongly  osmophylic anular thickening around the opening.“ < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Rieger| first1 = R.| last2 = Michaelis| first2 = A.| last3 = Green| first3 = M.M.| title = Glossary of Genetics and Cytogenetics: Classical and Molecular| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=N9f6CAAAQBAJ| year = 2012| publisher = Springer Science  &  Business Media| isbn = 978-3-642-96327-8 }} < /ref > < ref name= " rieger " > {{cite book| last1 = Rieger| first1 = Rigomar| last2 = Michaelis| first2 = Arnd| last3 = Green| first3 = Melvin M.| title = Glossary of genetics and cytogenetics: Classical and molecular| year = 1976| publisher = Springer-Verlag| isbn = 978-3-540-07668-1| place = Berlin – Heidelberg - New York }} < /ref > }}
