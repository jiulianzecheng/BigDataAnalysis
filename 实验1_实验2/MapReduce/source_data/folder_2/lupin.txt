 '''Lupin''', often spelled '''lupine''' in [[North America]], is the common name for members of the [[genus]] '''''Lupinus''''' in the family [[Fabaceae]].  
 
 There are between 150 and 200 species. They grow all over the [[Mediterranean region]] - [[Subgenus|Subgen.]] '''''Lupinus''''', and the [[Americas]] - Subgen. '''''Platycarpos '''''(Wats.)

 [[File:Lupinenblaetter.jpg|left|thumb|Lupin leaves from below]] 
 The species are mostly [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant]]s 0.3-1.5 [[Metre|m]] tall, but some are [[annual plant]]s and a few are [[shrub]]s up to 3 m tall, with one, Lupinus jaimehintoniana, a tree 8 m high with a trunk 20 & nbsp;cm in diameter, from the Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]]. They have a characteristic and easily recognised [[leaf]] shape, with soft green to grey-green or silvery leaves with the blades usually [[Palmate|palmately]] divided into 5â€“17 leaflets or reduced to a single leaflet in a few species of the southeastern United States; in many species, the leaves are hairy with silvery hairs, often densely so. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense or open [[Whorl|whorls]] on an erect spike, each flower 1-2 [[centimeter|cm]] long, with a typical [[pea]]flower shape with an upper 'standard', two lateral 'wings' and two lower petals fused as a 'keel'. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|pod]] containing several [[seed]]s. 
 
 == Lupins as an introduced pest == 
 In New Zealand lupins have escaped into the wild and grow in large numbers along main roads and streams in South Island. The seeds are carried by car tires and water flow, and unfortunately, some tourist shops in the major tourist areas have been reported to have sold packets of lupin seeds to tourists, with the instructions to plant, water and watch them grow into a giant beanstalk. They are principally blue, pink and violet, with some yellow, and are very attractive, providing colourful vistas with a backdrop of mountains and lakes. The New Zealand environment authorities have a campaign to reduce their numbers, although this seems a hopeless task, especially when faced with such ignorance as mentioned above. In fields they seem to be eradicated by sheep, and hence remain largely restricted to ungrazed roadside verges and stream banks.
