'''Neon''' is a [[chemical element]] on the periodic table.  It is part of the [[noble gas]] group and it has an atomic number of 10. It is an odorless and tasteless gas.  Neon does not react with other elements, so it is found by itself. There is not much neon in the [[air]], and it is clear, so we do not see it. 
 
 It was previously thought that Neon could not bond with any other elements, creating compounds. However, there have been a few compounds that have been made with neon, such as NeAuF and NeBeS.  
 
 == History == 
 Two British scientists, Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers, discovered neon, argon, krypton, and xenon.  Together they discovered a brand new gas element in 1898.  Four years before, Ramsay, a physical chemist, had found argon and was the first person to isolate [[helium]] in 1895.  The scientists froze [[argon]], using liquid air, and then evaporated this to collect the gas that is produced.  Using a high voltage, they collected the first sample of the gas.  To their surprise, the gas illuminated the glass tubes and glowed with bright crimson light. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Mama|first=Neon|title=The History Of Neon Signs and Lights|url=https://neonmama.com/blogs/news/history-of-neon-signs|access-date=2022-03-23|website=Neon Mama|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Upon discovery, the two scientists decided to name the new gas Neon, after the Greek word Neos, meaning the new one. While Ramsay and Travers discovered neon gas, they didn’t invent [[Neon lamp|neon lamps]]. It wasn’t until 1902 when French engineer and inventor Georges Claude showcased the first neon light. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Neon gas is used in [[gas discharge lamp]]s. When [[electricity]] goes through the neon, it lights up red. Due to this quality, it is used in light up signs. Similar signs use other gases to make other colors, but they are also often called  " neon signs " . Neon is also a term referring to a type of color that is very bright, such as [[lime green]].
