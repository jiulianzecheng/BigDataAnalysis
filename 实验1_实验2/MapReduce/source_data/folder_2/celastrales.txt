 '''Celastrales''' is an order of [[flowering plant]]s. They are found throughout the tropics and subtropics, with only a few species extending far into the temperate regions. There are about 1200 to 1350 species in about 100 genera. All but 7 of these genera are in the large family [[Celastraceae]]. Until recently, the composition of the order and its division into families varied greatly from one author to another.
