'''Dehumanization''' is the act of denying that a person is fully human, or treating a person like they are not fully human. Dehumanization makes it easier for people to be cruel to others, and inflict suffering. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Haslam|first=Nick|date=2006|title=Dehumanization: An Integrative Review|url=https://newclasses.nyu.edu/portal/site/bd325357-284c-4867-9164-8e088b8f7f4f/tool/37d05c72-c02a-426c-9ac9-83e7a9bfab85/discussionForum/message/dfAllMessages|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=10|issue=3|pages=252–264|via=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_4|pmid=16859440|s2cid=18142674|access-date=2019-06-22|archive-date=2020-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910172536/https://shibboleth.nyu.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?execution=e1s1|url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Spens|first=Christiana|date=2014-09-01|title=The Theatre of Cruelty: Dehumanization, Objectification  &  Abu Ghraib|journal=Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|doi=10.15664/jtr.946|issn=2516-3159|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 Dehumanization can be used against a [[race (sociology)|racial group]] or [[ethnicity]], by comparing them to animals or [[monster]]s. In this way it is easier to abuse people of another group. For example, [[black people]] have been dehumanized by [[racist]] images comparing them to [[ape]]s. Researchers say that this dehumanization continues to exist today: it can affect the punishment for a crime. < ref > {{cite web|title=Discrimination against blacks linked to dehumanization, study finds|date=2008-02-07|url=https://news.stanford.edu/pr/2008/pr-eber-021308.html|access-date=2021-07-17|archive-date=2022-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217193632/https://news.stanford.edu/pr/2008/pr-eber-021308.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Some people, such as [[Ota Benga]], an African [[Mbuti]] man, were held in [[human zoo]]s.

 [[Native Americans]], [[Africans]], and [[Aboriginal Australians]] were often pictured as unintelligent and [[wikt:savage|savages]]. When [[Ireland]] became a [[colony]] of [[England]], English newspapers showed the Irish as less cultured, less reasonable, and violent. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0181422|title=The enemy as animal: Symmetric dehumanization during asymmetric warfare|year=2017|volume=12|issue=7|doi-access=free|last1=Bruneau|first1=Emile|last2=Kteily|first2=Nour|pages=e0181422|pmid=28746412|pmc=5528981|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1281422B}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[Nazi Germany]], Nazis called Jews [[Untermensch]], meaning less than human. Nazis also described Jews as rats. These words were used to allow the Nazis to kill millions of [[Jews]] in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis also dehumanized other groups, such as [[Romani people]] (Gypsies). In the [[Rwandan Genocide]], [[Tutsi]]s were described as [[cockroach]]es. < ref > {{cite web|website=NPR|title='Less Than Human': The Psychology Of Cruelty|date=2011-03-29|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134956180/criminals-see-their-victims-as-less-than-human}} < /ref > 
 
 Women actors in [[pornography]] can be subject to objectification, which means they are seen as an [[object]]. The pornography is made for the [[pleasure]] of men, who may only see the actors for their body, not as a person. Some say that women are [[victim]]s of objectification in their daily life. They say that society (especially men) sees women as sexual objects, and that the woman herself is seen as less important. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Barbara L.|title=Objectification Theory: Toward Understanding Women's Lived Experiences and Mental Health Risks|last2=Roberts|first2=Tomi-Ann|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=21|issue=2|year=1997|pages=173–206|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258181826|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00108.x|s2cid=145272074|access-date=2014-11-07|archive-date=2020-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910172534/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258181826_Objectification_Theory_Toward_Understanding_Women%27s_Lived_Experiences_and_Mental_Health_Risks|url-status=live}} < /ref >
