 '''Adolescence''' is the time between being a [[child]] and a mature [[adult]], that is the period of time during which a person gradually grows into an adult, but is emotionally not mature. Adolescence in the English-speaking world usually corresponds to the [[teenager]] years of 13-19 which are so named because of the end of the English words  " thirteen "  to  " nineteen " . < ref > {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5H7Dg_cnJgIC & dq=adolescence+begins+13+ends+21 & pg=PT354 | title=Human Development | isbn=9780798647083 | last1=Louw | first1=D.

 The ages when one is no longer a child, and when one becomes an adult, vary by culture. In many cultures they are marked by [[rites of passage]]. The word comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] verb ''adolescere'' meaning  " to grow up. "  During this time, a person's body, emotions and academic standing change a lot. When adolescence starts, in America, children usually finish [[elementary school]] and enter [[secondary education]], such as middle school or high school. 
 
 During this period of life, most children go through the physical stages of [[puberty]], which can often begin before a person has reached the age of 13. Most cultures think of people as becoming adults at various ages of the teenage years. For example, [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition thinks that people are adults at age 13, and this change is celebrated in the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] (for boys) and the [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bat Mitzvah]] (for girls) ceremony. Usually, there is a formal [[age of majority]] when adolescents formally (under the law) become adults.
