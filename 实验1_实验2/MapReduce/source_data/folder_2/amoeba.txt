 '''''Amoeba''''' (plural = amoebae) is a well known [[genus]] of [[unicellular organism]], a [[protist]]. One of its most common [[species]], the '''''Amoeba Proteus''''', is about 0.2 to 0.3 & nbsp;mm large. The amoeba was first discovered by August Von Rosenhof in 1757. < ref > {{cite journal | last =  Leidy | first = Joseph | title = Amoeba proteus | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | year = 1878 | pages = 235â€“238 | jstor=2463786 | doi = 10.1086/272082| s2cid = 222321758 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1431317 }} < /ref >   It is a [[genus]] of [[protozoa]] that moves with ''false feet'', called [[pseudopodia]]. 
 
 The amoeba is a member of a whole group of amoeboid [[eukaryota|eukaryotic]] protists called [[Amoebozoa]]. They are [[heterotroph]]s, eating [[bacteria]] and other protists. 
 
 The pseudopodia (false feet) are extensions of the organism's [[cell membrane]]. They are used by the amoeba for [[phagocytosis]] (active food/nutrient intake) and [[motility]] (self-propelled movement). 
 
 == Life == 
 Amoebae are often found within [[freshwater]], typically on [[vegetation]] in [[decay]] in still or slow moving water, or in the [[benthic]] zone of some lakes. However, they are common organisms of study because it is easy to keep them in a [[laboratory]]. They are used to study sex 
 ''[[protozoa]]'' and to demonstrate [[Cell (biology)|cell]] structure and function.
