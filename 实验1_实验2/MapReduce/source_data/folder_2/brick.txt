 A '''brick''' is a man-made [[building]] [[material]] used to make [[wall]]s and make places to walk. It is a single unit of a kneaded [[clay]]-bearing soil, [[sand]] and [[Calcium oxide|lime]], or [[concrete]] material, fire-hardened or air-dried, used in [[masonry]] construction. 
 
 Bricks are made mostly of [[clay]]. They are put into [[mold]]s or cut with [[wire]]s, and then [[bake]]d in an [[oven]]. The [[color]] of a brick depends on the clay from which it was made. 
 
 [[Mason]]s build brick walls. They join bricks together using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. 
 Bricks can be [[wikt:assemble|assembled]] into many different [[pattern]]s. The most common pattern is called  " running bond " . A row of bricks is called a course.  
 
 Bricks used outdoors on the [[ground]] are called  " pavers " . Engineering bricks are used for high load-bearing walls, and for damp-proof courses. They are more expensive, and are made of better clays and fired at a higher temperature. 
 
 ==History== 
 The oldest shaped bricks found date back to 7500 B.C. They have been found in Çayönü, a place in the upper [[Tigris]] area in south east [[Anatolia]], close to Diyarbakir. A bit later, between 7000 and 6395 BC, bricks come from [[Jericho]] and [[Catal Hüyük]].  
 
 ''Fired'' bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s. They have been used since about 3000 BC in early [[Indus Valley]] cities. < ref name= " Ancient Bricks Anlysis " > [https://www.academia.edu/1285495/Bricks_and_urbanism_in_the_Indus_Valley_rise_and_decline], Bricks and urbanism in the Indus Valley. < /ref >  Sun-dried mud bricks are much older, and quite satisfactory in hot, dry climates. Fired bricks are much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions. They allow permanent building in regions where the harsher climate prevents the use of mud bricks. 
 
 Most bricks from all places tend to be about the same size: ~9 x ~4¼ x ~2½ inches or 250 × 120 × 65 mm. This is because they are picked up by the brickie in one hand, while in his other hand is a [[trowel]] with [[cement]] on it. 
 
 === Cement === 
 Just as bricks are ancient (probably Neolithic in origin), so is cement. That is (in comparison) a more recent invention. The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used cement. Older civilizations knew, however, that bricks needed to be stuck together. The [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyria]]ns used [[bitumen]] to bind together burnt brick or [[alabaster]] slabs. Bitumen comes out of the ground naturally in a few places. It is a black oily substance of [[Organic synthesis|organic]] origin, like oil or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. 
 
 In [[Ancient Egypt]], stone blocks were cemented together with a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] made of [[sand]] and roughly burnt [[gypsum]] (CaSO < sub > 4 < /sub >  · 2H < sub > 2 < /sub > O), which often contained calcium carbonate (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ). < ref name= " Blezard " > Blezard, Robert G.
