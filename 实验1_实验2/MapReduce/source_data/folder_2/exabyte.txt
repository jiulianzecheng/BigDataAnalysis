An '''exabyte''' ('''EB''') is a [[unit of measurement]] for data equal to 1000 [[petabyte]]s ('''PB''') or a million trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) [[byte]]s. An exabyte is large enough that it would take about 250,000 high-end home computers or 1,000,000 average home computers to store this amount of data. 
 
 One thousand exabytes make one [[zettabyte]]. The largest file currently known is CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) dataset. and that is only 2 [[petabyte]]s.
