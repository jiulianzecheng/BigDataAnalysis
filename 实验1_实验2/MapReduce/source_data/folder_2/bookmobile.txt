 A '''bookmobile''' is a mobile [[library]]. Today, it usually is a [[bus]], that is designed like a library. Usually, these mobiles have a fixed [[schedule]]. They serve the same stops, all the time. Often, these bookmobiles stop at [[School|schools]]: The idea is to incite children to read books, to improve their reading skills. Usually, they also allow to pre-order certain books. The first such libraries date from the 19th century. 
 
 In 1833, the [[Brothers Harper]] started with several identical collections, that toured around the united states. The brothers also published [[Harperâ€™s Weekly]].  Their library was called  " American School Library " . They started in 1839.  Probably the last complete set of these books is at the  National Museum of American History.  
 
 In 1857, the monthly journal ''The British Workman reported on'' a library that regularly served 8 villages in [[Cumbria]]. George Moore, a merchant and philanthropist ran this library,  to  " serve good literature to the people in the countryside. " 
 
 In 1905, there was such a library with a horse-drawn carriage in [[Maryland]].
