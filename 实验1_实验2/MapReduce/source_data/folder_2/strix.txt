 '''''Strix''''' is a [[genus]] of [[owl]]s in the [[True owl|typical owl family (Strigidae)]]. 
 
 This is one of the two living families of owls, the other being the [[barn owl]]s ([[Tytonidae]]). Common names for ''Stryx'' are '''earless owls''', though they are not the only owls without ear tufts.  " Wood owl "  is also used as a more generic name for forest-dwelling owls. Neotropical  birds in the genus ''[[Ciccaba]]'' are sometimes included in ''Strix''. 
 
 These are medium-sized to large, robustly built, powerful owls. They do not have ear tufts and most are [[nocturnal]] woodland birds. They eat small [[mammal]]s, birds, and [[reptiles]].
