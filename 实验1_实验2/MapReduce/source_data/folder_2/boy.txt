 A '''boy''' is a young [[male]] [[human]], either a [[child]] or [[teenager]].  Little boys still have the body of a child.  It is not until they reach [[puberty]] (adolescence) that their bodies start to mature and they become a [[man]]. 
 The word “boy” was used a long time ago in [[Anglo-Saxon]] English. The [[opposite]] of a boy is a [[girl]]. 
 
 ==Culture== 
 The way boys are brought up will vary a lot between different cultures.   Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls.  It is their job to do work that is physically hard, including fighting in the [[army]] when they are grown up.  However, people’s attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys. In Western cultures boys traditionally wear [[trousers]] (pants) while girls wear [[dress]]es or [[skirt]]s.    However, many girls also wear trousers these days, like boys, especially when dressed informally.  Boys often have shorter hair than girls, although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions. 
 
 Traditionally boys like rough games (such as [[soccer]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]]) and enjoy playing with [[mechanism|mechanical]] things such as toy cars and [[train]]s.  People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that, or because that is the way [[society]] expects them to behave. 
 
 The traditional color for a boy is [[blue]].  For girls, it is [[pink]].  When a baby is born in a [[hospital]] it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its [[wrist]] or [[ankle]], according to whether it is a boy or a girl. 
 
 ==Names== 
 Some names are boys’ names, others are girls’ names. There are some names that can be for boys and girls (although they may be spelled differently, e.g. “Lesley” for a boy and “Leslie” for a girl). 
 
 In some countries such as [[Britain]] an “old boy” means a grown-up who used to be a pupil at a particular school (e.g. “He is an old boy of Cransbury High School”).   The expression can also be used in a very informal, friendly way, e.g. “Nice to see you, old boy!”.
