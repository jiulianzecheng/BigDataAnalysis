 '''''Polacanthus''''' was an [[armour]]ed, spiked, plant-eating [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]], about 132 to 100 million years ago. ''Polacanthus'' means  " many spines. " 
 
 Some paleontologists think that ''Polacanthus'' is the same genus as ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]''. Fossils of this [[ankylosaurid]] have been found in [[England]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Polacanthus'' was about 12 feet (4 & nbsp;m) long and about 4.8 feet (1.5 m) tall. It was a bulky quadruped that relied on its many rows of bony spikes for protection. No head is known for this genus.
