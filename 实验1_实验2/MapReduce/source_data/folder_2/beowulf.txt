 == Story == 
 [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]], a Danish king, has built a big [[mead hall]], which is called [[Heorot]]. Hrothgar and his people live a good life and celebrate in Heorot. But then they are attacked by [[Grendel]], who comes to Heorot every night and kills some of Hrothgar's people. 
 
 [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]] is a warrior from [[Götaland|Geatland]] (modern southern [[Sweden]]). He hears of Hrothgar's troubles with Grendel. Beowulf and his men leave Geatland to help King Hrothgar. 
 
 Beowulf and his men stay the night in Heorot. When Grendel comes to kill them, Beowulf fights him. Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off from his body and sticks it on the wall as a trophy. Grendel runs to his home in the [[marsh]]es, where he dies. Everyone is happy that Grendel is killed and celebrates.  
 But the next night, Grendel's mother comes to Heorot and kills many people for revenge and grabs Grendel's arm. Beowulf then goes to the marshes where Grendel and his mother lived. Beowulf fights Grendel's mother and kills her. 
 
 Beowulf later becomes a king. He fights a [[dragon]] that was living in a [[barrow]]. With the help of the young man Wiglaf, Beowulf kills the dragon. Beowulf is wounded in the final battle and dies and crowns Wiglaf as his successor.
