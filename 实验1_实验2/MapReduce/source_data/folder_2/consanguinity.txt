'''Consanguinity''' ( " blood relation " , from the Latin ''[[:en:wikt:consanguinitas|consanguinitas]]'') means being of the same [[kinship]] as another person. Consanguinity also means being [[wikt:descend|descend]]ed from the same [[ancestor]] as another person.  The [[law]]s of many [[jurisdiction]]s set up degrees of consanguinity when [[wikt:prohibit|prohibit]]ing [[Sexual intercourse|sexual relations]] and marriage. [[Law|Rules]] of Consanguinity are also used to determine [[heir]]s of an [[estate]]. These are according to [[law]]s that govern [[intestate succession]]. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
 
 == History == 
 Most [[culture]]s have prohibited marriages between individuals who are closely related by blood (consanguinity). < ref name=LewisA.c > {{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriagemedieval/fl/Consanguinity-and-Medieval-Marriages.htm |title=Consanguinity and Medieval Marriages |author=Jone Johnson Lewis |publisher=About.com |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-date=6 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906030103/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriagemedieval/fl/Consanguinity-and-Medieval-Marriages.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  There were some [[wikt:exception|exception]]s.

 Most early [[society|societies]] had rules or laws that limited consanguineous marriages. So the [[danger]]s of [[inbreeding]] must have been known to them. < ref name=Sforza2 > Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza; Antonio Moroni, Gianna Zei, ''Consanguinity, Inbreeding, and Genetic Drift in Italy'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004), p. 2 < /ref >   
 
 === Roman civil law ===  
 In ancient Rome, marriage was governed by civil laws. Under Roman civil law couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. < ref name=Bouchard40 > Constance Bouchard, ''Those of My Blood: Creating Noble Families in Medieval Francia'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 40 < /ref >  The [[Germanic peoples]] also had rules against such marriages but were not as strict. < ref > Johannes Wilhelmus Wessels, ''History of the Roman-Dutch Law'' (Grahamstown, Cape Colony, African Book Co., 1908), p. 445 < /ref >   
 
 === Medieval Europe === 
 In the [[5th century]], after the [[Roman empire]] collapsed, the church took over regulating marriage. < ref name=TWeek > {{cite web |url=http://theweek.com/articles/475141/how-marriage-changed-over-centuries |title=How marriage has changed over centuries |publisher=The Week |access-date=19 October 2015}} < /ref >  At first they did not have a great deal of [[influence]]. The Church's power over marriage grew gradually. At first the Church followed Roman civil law. < ref name=Bouchard40/ >  In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven. < ref name=Bouchard269.270 > Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269-70 < /ref >  They also changed the method by which they were calculated. < ref name=Bouchard269.270/ >  The [[nobility]] of [[Europe]] usually married from within their own [[social class]]. Eventually they became too [[wikt:interrelated|interrelated]] to marry by the Church's rules. Many found it necessary to defy the Church. < ref > Constance B.

Sometimes the Church used consanguinity to block marriage as in the case of [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]]. < ref name=Douglas76 > David C. Douglas, ''William The Conqueror'' (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 76 < /ref >  In 1049 [[Pope Leo IX]] refused to allow the marriage. He did not give a reason but the two were [[cousin]]s. < ref name=Douglas76/ >  They married anyway. < ref name=Douglas76/ >  Ten years later, in 1059, [[Pope, Nicholas II]] finally granted a dispensation for their marriage. < ref name=Douglas76/ >  Despite restrictions and laws, up to the [[20th century]] consanguineous marriages were not uncommon in Europe. < ref > A.
