 '''''Euphorbia''''' is [[genus]] of over 2000 plant [[species]]. It is one of the biggest genera in the plant kingdom. Common names include [[poinsettia]], [[spurge]], or just ''Euphorbia''. 
 
 Many of these plants have developed a [[defence against herbivory]]: They are [[poison]]ous when swallowed. The Euphorbia family is in the group [[Malpighiales]], one of the largest groups in the plant kingdoms. The euphorbia family also includes [[croton]]s (''Codiaeum''), [[castor bean]] plants (''ricinu''s), and [[hogwort]]s (''Croton''). 
 
 Euphorbias are commonly plants that do not need a lot of water, like cacti. Pointsettias are commonly called Christmas flowers. There are many smaller genera in ''Euphorbia''. ''[[Ricinus]]'' (castor bean plant) is very [[toxic]]. It is the second most poisonous plant after ''Nerium oleander'' (family [[Apocynaceae]]).
