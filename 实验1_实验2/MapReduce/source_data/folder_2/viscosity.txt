 '''Viscosity''' is a physical property of [[fluid]]s. It shows [[resistance]] to [[flux|flow]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://physics.info/viscosity/|title=Viscosity|first=Glenn|last=Elert|journal=The Physics Hypertextbook|year=2021 }} < /ref >  In a simple example, [[water]] has a low viscosity, as it is  " thin " . [[Syrup]] and [[tar]], on the other hand, have a high viscosity, as they are  " thick " . A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the [[substance]] runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, and water would be much quicker. 
 
 There are two types of viscosity: ''[[fluid dynamics|dynamic]] viscosity'', measured in [[Pascal_(unit)|pascal]] [[seconds]], and ''[[Kinematics|kinematic]] viscosity'', measured in [[metres]] per [[second]] [[Square (mathematics)|squared]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.uniteasy.com/en/unitguide/Viscosity.htm|title=Quantities and Units of Viscosity|website=Uniteasy}} < /ref > 
 
 Viscosity is used as a way to predict when [[volcanoes]] erupt. When the [[lava]] comes out very thickly ([[Viscosity index|viscous]]), there is more chance that it will erupt [[violence|violently]]. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-viscosity.htm|title=What is Viscosity?

 The word ''viscous'' comes from the [[Latin]] root ''viscum'', meaning sticky. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/viscous|title=viscous - Origin and meaning of viscous|website=Online Etymology Dictionary}} < /ref >
