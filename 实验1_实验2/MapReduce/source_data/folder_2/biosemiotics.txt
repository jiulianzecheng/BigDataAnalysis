'''Biosemiotics''' is a science where the models of sign processes are used to study living systems. Unlike [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], sciences where the quantitative [[physical laws]] are used to explain the living things, biosemioticians study the [[organisms]] and phenomena of [[life]] on the basis of qualitative [[semiotics|semiotic]] principles.
