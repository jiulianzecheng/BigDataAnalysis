 '''Herbivores''' are animals that only eat [[plant]]s. They are ''herbivorous'' animals. 
 
 Most modern herbivores (such as [[deer]], [[elephant]]s, [[horse]]s) have [[teeth]] that are [[adaptation|adapted]] to grind grass. The main present-day vegetation in most continents is [[grassland]]. Some herbivorous animals do eat [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and sometimes other [[protein|animal protein]]. 
 
 Animals who eat mainly [[fruit]] are called [[frugivore]]s. [[Browser]]s eat mostly [[leaves]] and sometimes small tree branches. Animals that eat mostly [[grass]] are [[grazer|grazing]] animals. 
 
 The [[diet]] of some herbivorous animals changes with the [[season]]. In the [[temperate|temperate zones]], some seasons are hot and some are cold, so different plants are available at different times of the year. 
 
 == Digesting cellulose == 
 Plant [[cell wall]]s are mostly made up of [[cellulose]]. No animal can digest cellulose by itself. They make use of [[gut flora]], some of which produce an [[enzyme]] called cellulase. This is an example of [[symbiosis]]. 
 
 == Herbivore-plant interactions == 
 According to the theory of [[Prey-predator equations|predator-prey interactions]], the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic. < ref name= " Gotelli " > Gotelli N.J. 1995. ''A primer of ecology''. Sinauer. < /ref >  When prey (plants) are numerous, herbivores increase in numbers. Reducing the plant population causes herbivore number to decline. < ref name= " Gotelli " / >  The plant population recovers, starting a new cycle. The population of herbivores fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source, in this case the plants. 
 
 There will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores. < ref name= " Smith " > Smith R.L.  &  T.M. 2001. ''Ecology and field biology''. 6th ed, Cummings, New York. < /ref >  Eating a second plant type helps herbivores’ populations stabilize. < ref name= " Smith " / >  Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore, while the populations of the plants oscillate. < ref name= " Gotelli " / >  When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system, the balance is thrown off and the diversity can change or even collapse. < ref name= " Smith " / > 
 
 It is easier to be an herbivorous animal than a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] (meat-eating) animal. Carnivorous animals have to find and catch the animals that they eat, and sometimes the animals that they want to eat fight them. Herbivorous animals have to find the plants that they want to eat, but they do not have to catch them. Many plants have some [[defence against herbivores]], such as [[spine]]s, [[toxin]]s ([[poison]]s), or a bad [[taste]]. There are many more herbivorous animals living in the world than carnivorous animals. 
 
 === Herbivore effects on plant diversity === 
 Herbivores might increase plant diversity or decrease plant diversity. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Olff|first1=Han|last2=Ritchie|first2=Mark E.|date=July 1998|title=Effects of herbivores on grassland plant diversity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0169-5347(98)01364-0|journal=Trends in Ecology  &  Evolution|volume=13|issue=7|pages=261–265|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(98)01364-0|pmid=21238294|issn=0169-5347}} < /ref >

 One way that plants could differ in their susceptibility to herbivores is through defense trade-off. Defense trade-off theory is commonly used to be seen as a fundamental theory to maintain ecological evenness. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Huot|first1=Bethany|last2=Yao|first2=Jian|last3=Montgomery|first3=Beronda L.|last4=He|first4=Sheng Yang|date=August 2014|title=Growth–Defense Tradeoffs in Plants: A Balancing Act to Optimize Fitness|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/ssu049|journal=Molecular Plant|volume=7|issue=8|pages=1267–1287|doi=10.1093/mp/ssu049|pmid=24777989|pmc=4168297|issn=1674-2052}} < /ref >  Plants can make a trade-off response to resource allocation, such as between defense and growth. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Mole|first=Simon|date=October 1994|title=Trade-Offs and Constraints in Plant-Herbivore Defense Theory: A Life-History Perspective|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546166|journal=Oikos|volume=71|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.2307/3546166|jstor=3546166|issn=0030-1299}} < /ref >  Defenses against herbivory on plant diversity can vary in different situations.

 The predator-prey interaction, especially the “top-down” regulation. The predator-prey interaction encourages the adaptation in plant species which the predator prefers. The theory of “top-down” ecological regulation disproportionately manipulates the biomass of dominant species to increase diversity. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=P.

 In a highly productive system, the environment provides an organism with adequate nutrition and resources to grow. The effects of herbivores competing for resources on the plant are more complicated. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Borer|first1=Elizabeth T.|last2=Seabloom|first2=Eric W.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Charles E.|last4=Cronin|first4=James P.|date=2013-10-15|title=Multiple nutrients and herbivores interact to govern diversity, productivity, composition, and infection in a successional grassland|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00680.x|journal=Oikos|volume=123|issue=2|pages=214–224|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00680.x|issn=0030-1299}} < /ref > < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Bakker|first1=Elisabeth S.|last2=Ritchie|first2=Mark E.|last3=Olff|first3=Han|last4=Milchunas|first4=Daniel G.|last5=Knops|first5=Johannes M.

Therefore, in a highly productive system, direct consumption of dominant plants could indirectly benefit those herbivory-resistant and unpalatable species. But the less productive system can support limited herbivores because of lack of nutrients and water. Herbivory boosts the abundance of most tolerant species and decreases the less-tolerant species’ existence which accelerates the plant extinction. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Mediate productive system sometimes barely has long-term effects on plant diversity. Because the environment provides a stable coexistence of different organisms. Even when herbivores create some disturbances to the community. The system is still able to recover to the original state. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Light is one of the most important resources in environments for plant species. Competition for light availability and predator avoidance are equally important. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  With the addition of the nutrients, more competition arises among plant species. But herbivores could buffer the diversity reduction. Especially large herbivores can enhance the bio-diversity by selectively excluding tall, dominant plant species, and increase light availability. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 Body size of herbivores is a key reason underlying the interaction between herbivores and plant diversity, and the body size explains many of the phenomena connected to herbivore-plant interaction. Small herbivores are less likely to decrease plant diversity. Because small non-digging animals may not cause many disturbances to the plant and the environment. Intermediate-sized herbivores mostly increase plant diversity by consuming or influencing the dominant plant species, such as herbivore birds, that can directly use dominant plant species. < ref name= " :0 " / >  While some herbivores enhance plant diversity by indirect effects on plant competition. Some digging animals at this size local community environmental fluctuations. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Huntly|first1=N.|last2=Reichman|first2=O.

They use competitively dominant plant species, and disperse seeds and create disorder of the soil. Besides, their urine position also adjusts the local plant distribution, and prevent light competition. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 Therefore, the mechanisms of herbivores’ effects on plant diversity are complicated. Generally, the existence of herbivores increases plant diversity. But varies according to different environmental factors, multiple factors combined to affect how herbivores influence plant diversity.
