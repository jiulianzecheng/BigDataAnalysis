 The '''narwhal''' or '''narwhale''' (''Monodon monoceros'') is a rarely seen Arctic [[whale]]. < ref name= " narwhale.org " > {{cite web|url=http://www.narwhal.org/|title=Narwhale.org - Tusk Discoveries|accessdate=2009-12-26}} < /ref >  This social whale is known as the  " unicorn of the sea "  because the male has a very long tusk. Very little is known about this whale. Narwhal means  " corpse whale "  in Old Norse. < ref name= " WinterWhales " > {{cite book | author = Heide-Jørgensen, M. P. and K. L.

 == Description == 
 Large male narwhals can grow to a length of {{convert|15|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}, and weigh up to two tons. < ref name= " ford " > Ford, John and Deborah. ''Narwhal: Unicorn of the Arctic Sea.'', National Geographic, March 1986, pgs. 355-362 < /ref >  A female can give birth once every three years, after a pregnancy of 15 months. < ref name= " ford " / >  At birth, the baby narwhal is about {{convert|5|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} long and weighs about {{convert|180|lb|kg|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}. < ref name= " ford " / > 
 
 All narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw and a tusk. After the first year of a male narwhal's life, its left [[tooth]] grows outward, spirally. There are some narwhals that are double-tusked, but they are not as common. < ref > Nicklen, Paul.  " Arctic Ivory. "  ''National Geographic'' 212.2 (2007): 110-129. ''Science  &  Technology Collection''. Web. 8 May 2014. < /ref >  This long, single or double tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be {{convert|8.75|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} long. < ref name= " Geographic " > {{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/narwhal.html|title=National Geographic Society|accessdate=2009-12-26}} < /ref >  Tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and are hollow inside. The tusk's function is uncertain, perhaps used as a formidable jousting [[weapon]] in [[courtship]] and dominance rivalry, in getting food, and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses (which they emit). < ref name= " WinterWhales " / > < ref > {{cite journal |last=Silverman |first=H. B. |author2=M. J. Dunbar |date=March 1980  |title=Aggressive tusk use by the narwhal (''Monodon monoceros'' L.) |journal=Nature |volume=284 |issue=5751 |pages=56–57 |doi=10.1038/284057a0 |bibcode=1980Natur.284...57S |s2cid=4263166 }} < /ref >  The [[tusk]] is not used in [[hunt]]ing. Long ago, narwhal sightings probably reinforced (or started) the [[unicorn]] [[legend]]s. In fact, when people found the [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]] of a dead narwhal washed up on shore, they thought that they had found the horn of a [[unicorn]]. < ref name= " Daston " > Daston, Lorraine and Katharine Park. Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150-1750. New York: Zone Books, 2001. < /ref > 
 
 Narwhal can dive deep into the sea to around 800 meters, but can also sometimes dive up to 1,500 meters. This makes them one of the deepest diving sea [[mammals]]. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 [[File:Narwhal distribution map.png|left|thumb|220px|Narwhals live mostly in the solid blue areas of this map, but also live in the striped blue areas.]] 
 Narwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas. < ref name= " Geographic " / >  The Narwhal's thick skin, called blubber, keep them warm in the cold water. They do not go far away from [[ice]]. Narwhals live in groups of between 10 and 100. Narwhals are migrating animals who like to move from one place to live in another place for a while. In [[summer]], groups of them move closer to land, where they can sometimes be seen in the estuaries, deep fjords, and bays of [[Greenland]], Northern [[Canada]] and as far eastern [[Russia]]. In [[Winter]] they move back to the icy waters, where they breathe from small holes in the ice.  
 
 Narwhals can hunt under [[ice]] and like to eat Arctic [[fish]] such as the [[flatfish]] [[Greenland halibut]], the [[Polar cod|polar]] and Arctic [[cod]], [[shrimp]] and [[squid]]. They suck in their prey when they get close.   
 
 Narwhals are both hunted by [[polar bears]] and [[killer whales]]. The native [[Inuit]] people, sometimes called the [[Eskimos]], are still allowed to hunt the Narwhals for their meat and for the tusks. The tusks are sold with or without carving. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2009/08/19/111980557/inuit-hunters-help-scientists-track-narwhals | title=Inuit Hunters Help Scientists Track Narwhals | publisher=National Public Radio | date=19 August 2009 | accessdate=24 October 2016 | author=Greenfieldboyce, Nell}} < /ref >  The annual value received from Narwhal hunts in [[Hudson Bay]] is $530,000, of which $370,000 is for meat, $150,000 for tusks, bones and teeth of males, and $10,000 for teeth and bones of females. < ref > {{Cite journal |authors=Hoover C, Bailey M, Higdon J, Ferguson SH, Sumalia R |date=March 2013 |title=Estimating the Economic Value of Narwhal and Beluga Hunts in Hudson Bay, Nunavut |url=https://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/4261/4242 |journal=The Arctic Institute of North America |volume=66 |pages=1–16}} < /ref >
