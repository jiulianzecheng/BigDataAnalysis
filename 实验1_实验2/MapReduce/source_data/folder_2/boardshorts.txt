 Boardshorts are a type of [[Swimsuit|swimwear]] or beachwear. They can also be general casual wear (informal clothing), however they usually don't have big pockets for a phone and wallet like other casual shorts. Boardshorts usually have only a very small inside pocket to hold car keys. Compared to other styles of swimwear or beachwear, they are quite long (approximately knee length) and loose-fitting. They are made of material that is quick-drying. They are generally made from strong and smooth [[polyester]] or [[nylon]] material. They are very popular with teenaged boys. Boardshorts were popular for boys and men at first, but are now also worn by girls and women.  
 
 Boardshorts are popular to wear at swimming pools and beaches. Originally they were for [[surfing]]. They are also popular for [[wakeboarding]], riding [[Jet Ski|jet skis]] and [[water skiing]]. Boardshorts are very popular in North America. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are more common. They are not actually very good for swimming if you want to swim quickly. Tighter, form-fitting, swimwear is better to swim fast. However, most men and boys in the United States and Canada do not like to wear tight beachwear that shows the shape of the [[Human penis|penis]] and [[Testicle|testicles]]. In slang, this shape is sometimes called a '''manbulge''' or [[mooseknuckle]]'''.''' People in Europe do not care so much and are happy to wear tighter and more flexible swimwear. 
 
 Boardshorts started in the 1950s. Their popularity spread beyond surfing, especially as the skater ([[skateboard]]) punk fashion trend started. They are also commonly worn for men's beach [[volleyball]].  
 
 Boardshorts usually do not have an elastic waist like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid waistband which opens at the front, often with a [[Velcro]] (or similar hook and loop technology) fly. To be extra safe, the waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up string (thin rope) tie. Because there are two ways they are kept from falling down, it is uncommon for boardshorts to come off and be lost in the ocean while surfing in rough waves.  
 
 Although the basic design for boardshorts has not changed much over the years, some companies that make them use new technology. Because surfers and other people who like water-sports usually wear boardshorts without [[underwear]] (commonly called  " '''freeballing''' "  or  " '''going commando''' " ), one of the major complaints was about the use of velcro for the fly closure. Velcro can entangle or catch [[pubic hair]]. This can hurt. To fix this problem, some companies use a [[neoprene]] fly instead. This does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. Velcro is not a big problem for people who keep their pubic hair cut short or shave their pubic hair, as is now common.
