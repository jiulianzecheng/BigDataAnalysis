 ==History== 
 The [[explorer]]s [[Charles Throsby]] and [[Joseph Wild]] travelled through the Yass River valley in 1820.  The [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigines]] called the valley ''Candariro'' which means ''blue crane''. This name might be the meaning of the word Gundaroo. < ref > * ''Exploring the ACT and Southeast New South Wales'', J. Kay McDonald, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1985 {{ISBN|0-86417-049-1}} < /ref >   Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] gave the first [[Europe]]n settler, Peter Cooney, 30 acres in 1825.  Other farms were started quickly with about 400 people in the 1840s. The Harrow Inn ([[hotel]]) was built in 1834.  A post office was built in 1848 and an Anglican church, St Lukes in Upper Gundaroo (now part of a [[pottery]] business), in 1849. The first [[school]] opened in 1850 and a [[Police station]] in 1852. < ref > {{cite web
