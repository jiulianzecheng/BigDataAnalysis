 A '''tangerine''' is [[citrus]] [[fruit]] related to the [[mandarin orange]]. Tangerines are smaller and easier to peel than common [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]. The [[taste]] is considered less [[sour]], but sweeter and stronger, than that of an orange. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.pittmandavis.com/blog/why-are-tangerines-so-tangy/|title=Why Are Tangerines So Tangy? â€“ Pittman  &  Davis Blog|publisher=}} < /ref >    
 
 Very often, tangerines are simply peeled and eaten by hand, but they are sometimes also used as an ingredient of [[salad]]s. In [[Sichuan cuisine]], the dried peel of tangerines is used as an ingredient.  
 
 [[Clementine]]s are sometimes considered as alternatives to tangerines.
