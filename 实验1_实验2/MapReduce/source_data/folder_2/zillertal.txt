 The '''Zillertal''' is the biggest valley branching off the [[Inn (river)|Inntal]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Austria]] drained by the river [[Ziller]]. It is surrounded by the strongly [[glacier|glaciated]] [[Zillertal Alps|Zillertaler Alpen]] to the south and east, the lower grass peaks of the [[Kitzbüheler Alpen]] to the east and [[Tux Alps|Tuxer Alpen]] to the west. The largest settlement is [[Mayrhofen]]. 
 
 ==Culture== 
 The Zillertal is particularly renowned for its musical tradition. For instance, several families of travelling singers and organ builders from the valley have been credited with spreading the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Silent Night]]'' across the world during the 19th and early 20th centuries. More recently, the [[Schürzenjäger]] band have had tremendous success in German-speaking countries with their [[fusion (music)|crossover]] mix of ''[[Volksmusik]]'' and [[pop music|pop]].
