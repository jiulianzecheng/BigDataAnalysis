 The '''Hajj''' ( " [[wikt:pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] " ) is an annual [[Islam]]ic [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]], the most holy city of the Muslims. It is a Fard, a religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult [[Muslim]]s who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence. < ref name= " Marshall86 " > {{cite book| last = Long| first = Matthew| title = Islamic Beliefs, Practices, and Cultures| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H_m14NlQQMYC & pg=PA86| accessdate = 2 September 2014| year = 2011| publisher = Marshall Cavendish Corporation| isbn = 978-0-7614-7926-0| page = 86 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = Nigosian| first = S.

 The Hajj is associated with the life of [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] from the 7th century, but the ritual of pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people, who all go to Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the [[Ka'aba]] (the cube-shaped building and the [[Qibla|direction of prayer]] for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah]], drinks from the [[Zamzam Well]], goes to the plains of [[Mount Arafat]] to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of [[Muzdalifa]], and performs symbolic [[stoning of the devil]] by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of [[Eid al-Adha]]. < ref name= " armstrong " > {{cite book| last = Armstrong| first = Karen| title = Islam: A Short History| url = https://archive.org/details/islamshorthistor00arms_131| edition = Revised Updated| series = Modern Library Chronicles| year = 2002| publisher = Modern Library| isbn = 978-0-8129-6618-3| pages = [https://archive.org/details/islamshorthistor00arms_131/page/n24 10]–12 }} < /ref > < ref name= " ngeo " > {{cite news |title=Inside Makkah (video documentary) |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |year=2003 |author=Anisa Mehdi |author2=John Bredar}} < /ref > < ref name= " bbc.co.uk " > {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/eiduladha.shtml |title=Eid ul Adha |date=7 September 2009 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 December 2012}} < /ref > < ref > Sahih Bukhari-hadith No-732-733 < /ref > 
 
 Pilgrims can also go to Mecca to perform the rituals at other times of the year. This is sometimes called the  " lesser pilgrimage " , or [[Umrah]]. < ref name= " RT-2016 " > {{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/business/337135-saudi-hajj-revenues-oil/ |title=Saudi Arabia to move from oil, earn more from Hajj |publisher=RussiaToday |date=25 March 2016}} < /ref >  However, even if they choose to perform the Umrah, they are still obligated to perform the Hajj at some other point in their lifetime if they have the means to do so, because Umrah is not a substitute for Hajj. < ref > {{cite book| title = Islamic Beliefs and Practices| url = https://archive.org/details/islamicbeliefspr00stef_385| year = 2010| publisher = [[Britannica Educational Publishing]]| location = [[New York City|New York]]| isbn = 978-1-61530-060-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/islamicbeliefspr00stef_385/page/n72 73]| editor = Matt Stefon }} < /ref >
