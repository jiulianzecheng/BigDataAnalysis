 A '''sabbath''' is a [[day]] reserved for [[leisure|rest]] or [[prayer]], usually each [[week]]. The word ''Sabbath'' comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''Shabbat'' ({{hebrew|שַׁבָּת}}). This word is built from the Hebrew [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''Sh-B-T,'' meaning rest.   
 
 In the [[Hebrew Bible]], or ''[[Tanakh]],'' the root ''Sh-B-T'' is used to describe [[God]] resting on the seventh day. This is the day after He finished [[wikt:create|creating]] the universe. < ref > {{bibleref|Genesis|2:1-3|HE}} < /ref >  In the Bible, the idea of ''Shabbat,'' or ''Sabbath,'' as a holy day of rest starts there. < ref > Some [[scholar]]s believe that the writers of the Bible got the idea of the ''Sabbath'' from the [[Babylonia]]ns. See, for example, {{cite book|author=Craveri, Marcello|title=The Life of Jesus|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofjesus00crav|publisher=Grove Press|year=1967|page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeofjesus00crav/page/134 134]|asin=B00DLK4P48}} < /ref > 
 
 Remembering and keeping Sabbath is also one of the [[Ten Commandments]]. < ref > {{bibleref|Exodus|20:7-10|HE}} and {{bibleref|Deuteronomy|5:11-14|HE}}. Some [[translation]]s have different [[wikt:verse|verse]] numbers. < /ref >  From that, the [[Abrahamic religion]]s ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) all have a [[tradition]] of a holy day of rest or prayer set aside every week. These days are now very different from each other, including which day of the week they fall on.
