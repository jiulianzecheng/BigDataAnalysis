'''Crochet''' is a way of creating [[fabric]] from [[yarn]] or [[thread]] using a [[crochet hook]] to pull loops of yarn through other loops.  It is similar to [[knitting]], except that usually only one loop is active at one time, and that a crochet hook is used instead of knitting needles.  Also, crochet can not be made by machine.  Crochet uses more yarn than knitting but is faster to make by hand. 
 
 Crochet is used to make [[clothing]], household items like [[tablecloth]]s, [[blanket]]s and potholders, and [[toys]]. [[Lace]] is often made by crocheting, though it can be made by knitting and [[weaving]] as well. 
 
 Crocheting is also a great craft for younger children.  The stitches are easy and their small hands are able to hold the crochet hook.  They are also able to see progress very quickly and that motivates them to continue.  It is very easy to start again after setting the project down, which will help to keep young people involved in the craft.
