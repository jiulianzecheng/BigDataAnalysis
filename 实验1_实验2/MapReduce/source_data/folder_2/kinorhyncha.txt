 '''Kinorhyncha'''  < ref > Gr. κίνηω, ''kīneō'' 'move' + ρυνχος, ''rhynchos'' 'snout' < /ref >  is a [[phylum (biology)|phylum]] of small (1 & nbsp;mm or less) [[Ocean|marine]] [[invertebrate]]s. They are widespread in [[mud]] or [[sand]] at all depths of the sea. They are sometimes called '''mud dragons'''. About 222 [[species]] are known. Kinorhynchs eat either [[diatom]]s or organic material found in the mud, depending on species. 
 
 ==Anatomy== 
 Kinorhynchans are segmented, limbless animals. Their body has a head, neck, and a trunk. The trunk has eleven segments. They do not have external [[cilia]], but have a number of spines along the body, and up to seven circles of spines around the head. < ref > Brusca, Richard C.  &  Brusca, Gary J. 2003. ''Invertebrates'', p347. ISBN 978-0-87893-097-5 < /ref >  These spines are used for movement. They can pull back the head and push forward; then they can grip the substrate with the spines, and draw up the body. 
 
 The body wall is a thin layer with a tough [[cuticle]]. It is moulted several times during growth. This layer is a [[syncytium]], with [[nuclei]], but no [[cell membrane]]s. 
 
 The spines are hollow and covered by cuticle. The head is completely retractable, when is covered by a set of neck plates. < ref name=IZ > {{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders|location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 286–288|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}} < /ref > 
 
 The nervous system is a ventral nerve cord, with one [[ganglion]] in each segment, and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. This is the common arrangement  for invertebrates.  Some species have simple [[ocellus|ocelli]] (eye-spots) on the head, and all species have tiny bristles on the body as touch receptors. < ref name=IZ/ > 
 
 ===Reproduction=== 
 There are two sexes that look alike. A pair of [[gonad]]s are in the mid-region of the trunk, and open to pores in the final segment. In most species, the sperm duct has two or three spiny structures that presumably help in [[copulation]]. The [[larva]]e are free-living. < ref name=IZ/ > 
 
 ==Classification== 
 Their closest relatives may be the phyla [[Loricifera]] and [[Priapulida]]. Together they are the [[Scalidophora]].
