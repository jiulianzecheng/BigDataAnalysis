 '''Arnhem''' is a city in [[the Netherlands]]. It is the capital of the eastern province [[Guelders|Guelders (Gelderland)]]. Arnhem has 159,265 [[citizen]]s (as of 1 January 2019), the agglomeration 722,181 (Arnhem-Nijmegen conurbation). It is in the top-15 of largest cities in the Netherlands. 
 
 ==History== 
 The history of Arnhem goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. Arnhem got city-rights in [[1233]] from the Count of [[Zutphen]]. The exact text is still kept in the ''Duivelshuis'' (Devil's house) which is now part of Arnhem's City Hall. 
 
 In 1850 Arnhem had 9,000 citizens. The city became popular with rich people from the western part of the Netherlands. 
 
 During the [[World War II]] Arnhem was severely damaged. The [[Battle of Arnhem]] in 1944 is the sad story of [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Poland|Polish]] [[paratrooper]]s who fought to get control of the [[Rhine]]-bridge. According to the plan of [[Field Marshal Montgomery]], Arnhem was the last in a series of bridges which would be taken by [[paratroopers]]. At the same time a ground-army would advance from the Belgium-Dutch border across all these bridges. This operation was called [[Operation Market Garden]]. Market for the [[Airborne]]-element and Garden to represent the Ground-forces. Arnhem would be the responsibility of the British paratroopers, and would be the last bridge to be crossed by the ground forces. [[General officer|General]] [[John Frost]] succeeded in taking the Arnhem bridge from the [[Germany|Germans]]. Due to several reasons Frost had to [[retreat]], and the bridge was again in German control. The [[movie]] [[A Bridge Too Far]] is about this battle. After the Battle of Arnhem the Germans forced Arnhem's citizens to [[evacuation|evacuate]] the city. This was because they were afraid another battle would have to be fought. When Arnhem's citizens came back, they found their city destroyed. 
 
 After the war Arnhem was rebuilt, including the [[Eusebiuskerk]] (Eusebius Church). The bridge crossing the Rhine is now called [[John Frost Bridge]] after the famous UK general, since 1978.
