'''ELISPOT''' stands for  " Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay " .  It is a [[laboratory]] technique for detecting [[cells]] that make (or  " secrete " ) various substances.  These substances include specific types of [[cytokine]]s or [[antibody|antibodies]].  The ELISPOT method is typically used with [[blood cell]]s, and is a helpful tool in studying the human immune system and various treatments for disease (e.g. vaccines). 
 
 In the ELISPOT technique, tiny wells are used to contain the cells, with a variety of other substances.  The substances cause colored spots to form near the cells that secrete the substances in question. These spots can then be counted manually (using a microscope, for example) or automatically using specialized equipment with computer vision capabilities. 
 
 The ELISPOT technique is very sensitive, and can detect even a single substance-producing cell. It is also very versatile, since it can be tailored to detect a wide variety of very specific secretions.
