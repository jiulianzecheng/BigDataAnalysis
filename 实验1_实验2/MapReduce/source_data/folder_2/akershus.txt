 '''Akershus''' is a former [[county]] in [[Norway]]. It was bordered by [[Hedmark]], [[Oppland]], [[Buskerud]], [[Oslo]] and [[Østfold]]; the area has a short border with [[Sweden]]. Akershus was the second largest county in [[population]] after Oslo. It has more than half a million people living in it. The county was named after [[Akershus Fortress]]. The county [[administration]] was in Oslo, which was not part of the county. 
 
 On 1 January 2020 the county merged with [[Buskerud]] and [[Østfold]] to the current county of [[Viken (county)|Viken]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Jessheim railway station.jpg|thumb|The Jessheim railway station in Ullensaker, Akershus]] 
 Most of the county is in the districts [[Follo]] and [[Romerike]]. There are also the two smaller districts of [[Asker]] and [[Bærum]] which are west of Oslo. This happened when the [[municipality]] of [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] (surrounding Oslo) was moved from Akershus county to Oslo in [[1948]]. 
 
 Akershus includes some of the [[lake]] [[Mjøsa]] and some of the [[river]] [[Glomma]]. Because it includes many suburbs of Oslo, notably Bærum, Akershus has a large number of people living in a small area. The main national [[railway]] lines into Oslo run through Akershus with many [[railway station|stations]] such as Asker, [[Ullensaker]], Ski and [[Lillestrøm]]. 
 
 The county includes the [[history|historical]] place Eidsvoll, 48 & nbsp;km north of Oslo. This is where the National assembly voted the Norwegian [[constitution]] in 1814. South of Eidsvoll is the [[international]] [[airport]] of [[Oslo Airport]] at Gardermoen. The home of the [[Prince|crown prince]] is in Asker. 
 
 == Buildings == 
 The county has a major international airport, the Oslo Airport. It also has two [[university]] [[hospital]]s, [[Akershus University Hospital]] and [[Sunnaas Hospital]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Akershus became a [[fief]] in the [[16th century]]. At that time it included the current counties of [[Hedmark]], [[Oppland]], [[Buskerud]] and [[Oslo]]. It also included municipalities of [[Askim]], [[Eidsberg]] and [[Trøgstad]] in the county of [[Østfold]]. In [[1685]] Buskerud was separated from Akershus. In [[1768]] Hedmark and Oppland were also separated from Akershus. In [[1842]] Christiania (Oslo) was made separate as well. In 1948 Aker was transferred to the county of Oslo. 
 
 == Origin == 
 The county is named after Akershus Fortress. The [[fortress]] was built in 1299. Its name means  " the (fortified) house of (the district) Aker " .
