 In [[chemistry]], a '''crucible''' is a kind of laboratory equipment that is usually a small cup, about the size of a shot glass, made of porcelain or non-reactive metal. Crucibles are used to heat [[chemical compound]]s to very high temperatures using a gas burner. One of the earliest uses of [[platinum]] was as a material in crucibles. Metals such as [[nickel]] and [[zirconium]] are also used as a modern crucible material.
