 A '''Tissue''' forms part of an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] in plants or animals. Tissues are groups of [[cells]] that work together to do a job in the body. They are a group of cells having the same origin, structure and [[Function (biology)|function]]. The cells look the same or almost the same. The work the cells in a tissue do is the same or almost the same.  
 
 The four main kinds of tissue in animals are: 
 # [[connective tissue]] 
 # [[muscle]]s 
 # [[nerve]]s  
 # [[epithelial tissue]]  
 
 [[Organ (anatomy)|Organs]] are made up of more than one kind of tissue. The [[heart]] is an organ. It is made up of different tissues. It has [[muscle]] tissue called myocardium. It has [[connective tissue]] on the inside (endocardium), and on the outside (pericardium). The heart has [[valve]]s that make sure the blood goes the right way through the heart. So the heart is an organ made from several tissues.  
 
 The study of the structure of tissues under a [[microscope]] is called [[histology]].
