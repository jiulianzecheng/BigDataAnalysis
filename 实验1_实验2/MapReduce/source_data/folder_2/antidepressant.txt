 There are different types of antidepressant, such as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), [[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs), [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs).  
 
 == How they work == 
 Antidepressants work to improve the [[mood]]. Doctors think that when someone is depressed, the [[chemical]]s in their [[brain]] are not working properly. Antidepressants balance these chemicals, lifting the depression. < ref > {{cite book| last = Cefrey| first = Holly| title = Antidepressants| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| date = 2000| pages = 14| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TmUUxIu7DJkC| isbn =0823932834 }}  < /ref >
