 '''Tritheism''' is the belief that there are three distinct, powerful gods, who form a triad. Generally three gods are believed to have separate powers and separate supreme beings or [[spheres of influence]] but working together. In this respect tritheism differs from [[dualism]], which typically envisages two opposed Divine powers in conflict with one another. 
 
 Ironically, there is no group that claims to believe in or teach tritheism; the term is solely used as an accusation against others, somewhat similar to the usage of the word ''[[cult]]'', in accusing a group of holding an alternate or distorted view of the [[Christian]] doctrine of [[Trinity]]. < ref name= " OCE " > Chapman, John (1912).
