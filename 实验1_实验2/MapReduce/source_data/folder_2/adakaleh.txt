 '''Adakaleh''' (nicknamed '''Ottoman Atlantis''') was a small [[island]] in the [[Danube River]] at the [[Carpathian Mountains]], opposite on the other bank of [[Orşova]] and  Tekija. From 1699 onward, it was a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], until the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923. After that, it was owned by the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In 1939, many [[Turkish people]] left Ada Kaleh and settled in Turkey. < ref > https://www.acarindex.com/dosyalar/makale/acarindex-1423873237.pdf < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.webumenia.sk/en/dielo/SVK:SGP.O_759 | title=Maximilián Kurth – Bego Mustafa }} < /ref >  The Island was flooded in 1968-1971, when a [[dam]] was made by the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. The island has been underwater since then. The people who used to live on the island were [[Turkish language|Turkish]] speaking [[Sufism]]-[[Muslims]] Turks. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/ada-kaleh-an-ottoman-atlantis-on-the-danube/ | title=Ada Kaleh, an Ottoman Atlantis on the Danube }} < /ref >  In 1967, before the island was flooded, the [[Turkish people]] on the island went to other places in Mainland Romania to Dobruja, but most of the people went to [[Turkey]]. 
 
 The island was known for its [[Mediterranean climate]] and Oriental Flair, with [[rose]]s, different [[fruit tree]]s like [[apricot]] and [[fig]], [[almond]] and [[sweet chestnut]] trees, exotic [[Ottoman architecture]] and production of [[Turkish delight]], [[Baklava]], [[Candy]], and [[Turkish coffee]], [[rose water]] [[sorbet]], [[Rose]] and [[Fig]] [[Marmalade]], [[fishing]], and [[souvenir]]s. The island was also known for [[smuggling]]. The island had a [[mosque]] with one [[Minaret]] and [[Well]] for [[Wudu]], and a [[Hammam]], a [[Bazaar]] and an old [[fortress]] with [[catacomb]]s, a governor's [[villa]], a [[cinema]], an old Ottoman [[cemetery]], small white  [[Cottage]]s, three or four [[Mansion]], a [[Hotel]], many [[Café]]'s, a [[Textile]] and [[Tobacco]] [[Fabric]], a small [[Power station]] for Electricy, an [[Association football pitch]] and a [[botanical garden]]. The islanders were described by outlandish visitors as kindly people, the male and female wear [[Salwar kameez]], the men handsome who wear a [[Fez (hat)]], and the women beautiful, some of them veiled in [[Chador]] until it was forbidden by [[Socialist Republic of Romania]]. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2016/01/22/ada-kaleh-a-turkish-island-in-the-danube-river | title=Ada Kaleh: A Turkish island in the Danube River | website=[[Daily Sabah]] | date=22 January 2016 }} < /ref >  [[Oil wrestling]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish dance]] and [[Sünnet]] [[party|parties]] of Boys were performed as [[tourist attraction]]s. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://alexisphoenix.org/adakaleh.php | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000112/http://alexisphoenix.org/adakaleh.php | archive-date=2011-07-25 | title=Ada Kaleh }} < /ref > 
 
 The most famous resident was Bego Mustafa, a turk, former officer in the ottoman army. 
 In 1846 he helped the Hungarian national hero Lajos Kossuth to escape to Vidin in the Ottoman Empire. 
 His image was often used for postcards from Adakaleh. He died in 1910 at the age of 104. < ref > {{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/23622641 | title=Mustafa Bego, türkischer Nargileh-Raucher und ungarischer Nationalheld.

 ==Diaspora== 
 When in 1967 the majority of the Islanders moved to Turkey, they call themselfs ''Haymatlos'', the descendants of Adakaleh Turks live mostly in [[Turkey]] and few in [[Romania]], but some came from Turkey to Germany as [[Guest worker]], and became part of the [[Turks in Germany]].
