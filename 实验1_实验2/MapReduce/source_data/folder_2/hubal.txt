'''Hubal''' was a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabian]] [[moon]] [[god]] worshipped by the [[Quraysh|Quarysh]] tribe in [[Makkah]]. The idol of the God was shaped similarly to a [[Human]] and the people of Makkah throwed [[arrows]] at the idol so they could get favors out of the God. However in 630, [[Muhammad]] destroyed all of the idols in Makkah including Hubal using a rod. The idol was seen as the greatest of the 360 idols by the [[Quraysh]]. < ref name= " armstrong " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/islamshorthistor00arms_354|title=Islam: A Short History|author=Karen Armstrong|date=2002|publisher=Random House Publishing|isbn=0-8129-6618-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamshorthistor00arms_354/page/n50 11]|url-access=limited}} < /ref >
