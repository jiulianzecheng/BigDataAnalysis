 A '''waterspout''' is a [[funnel cloud]] over water. It is a nonsupercell [[tornado]] over water. Waterspouts do ''not'' suck up water; the water seen in the main funnel cloud is actually water droplets formed by condensation. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/637532/waterspout|author=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Waterspout|year=2009|accessdate=28 August 2009}} < /ref >  It is weaker than most of its land counterparts. < ref > Glossary of Meteorology.

 == Types == 
 === Non-tornadic === 
 Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]], are known as  " nontornadic "  or  " fair-weather waterspouts " , and are by far the most common type. < ref name= " GALE " > Gale Schools. [http://www.galeschools.com/environment/glossary.htm#f Fair weather waterspout.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421022620/http://www.galeschools.com/environment/glossary.htm#f |date=2008-04-21 }} Retrieved on 2006-10-25. < /ref > 
 
 Fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective [[cumulus]] towers.

 ===Snowspout=== 
 A '''winter waterspout''', also known as a '''snow devil''', an '''icespout''', an '''ice devil''', a '''snonado''', or a '''snowspout''', is a very [[wikt:rare|rare]] [[meteorology|meteorological]] [[:wikt:phenomenon|phenomenon]] in which a [[vortex]] from snow develops that looks like a [[waterspout]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/glossary/s.html |title=weather.com - Glossary |access-date=2012-04-03 |archive-date=2008-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801101119/http://www.weather.com/glossary/s.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   One does not know much about this rare happening and there are only six known pictures of this event so far. 
 
 There are three main things that produce a winter waterspout: 
 * Very cold temperatures present over a body of warm water enough to produce [[fog]] that looks like [[steam]] above the water's surface.  This usually needs temperatures of -18 & nbsp;°C or colder if the water temperature is no warmer than 5 & nbsp;°C. 
 * [[Lake-effect snow]]s in a small, enclosed or banded [[wikt:formation|formation]] must be present and going on. 
 * The wind speed has to be slow, usually less than 5 knots (9.25 & nbsp;km/h).
