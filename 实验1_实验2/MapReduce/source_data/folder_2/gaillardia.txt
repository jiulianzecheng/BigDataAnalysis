 '''Gaillardia''' ('''Blanket flower''') is a genus of [[drought]]-tolerant annual and perennial plants from the sunflower family ([[Asteraceae]]), native to [[North America]]. It was named after M. Gaillard de Charentonneau, an 18th-century French magistrate who was a patron of [[botany]]. The common name refers to the inflorescence's resemblance to brightly patterned [[blanket]]s made by native Americans.
