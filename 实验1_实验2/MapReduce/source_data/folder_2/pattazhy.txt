 ==Etymology== 
 
 The name Pattazhy has an uncertain etymology. Pattazhy may stem from an imperfect [[Malayalam]] [[portmanteau]] fusing Patt ( " Soft " ) and Aazhy ( " [[Ocean]] " ). Thus the word Pattazhy represents the compassion and affection of Pattazhy [[Devi]] to her beloved devotees and depth of her grace. The name Pattazhy may have also derived from the word ''Bhattarika'' which means a [[virtuous]] and [[pious]] woman. 
 
 ==Culture== 
 
 The annual [[festival]] at Pattazhy Devi Temple is one of the famous temple festivals in central [[Travancore]].The Kumbhathiruvathira and Meenathiruvathira were the famous festivals of Pattazhy. The [[festival]] is known for Kambam ([[fire works]]), Aalpindi Vilakku Ezhunnallathu (Procession of small structure made out of [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] kernel and germinating leaves of [[coconut]] tree with numerous lamps on it), Ponnin Thirumudi ([[Devi]]'s idol carved out of pure [[gold]] and rare precious stones) Ezhunnallathu. Pattazhy also got a place in the [[Guinness Book]] of world records for the 'Longest bamboo'.
