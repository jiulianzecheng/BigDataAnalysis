A '''triclinic''' [[crystal]] is shaped almost like a [[rectangle]]. It is slightly bent, though. [[Copper sulfate]] makes triclinic crystals. It is the least [[symmetric]] (meaning that both sides are not very similar).  
 
 . In the triclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal length, as in the orthorhombic system.
