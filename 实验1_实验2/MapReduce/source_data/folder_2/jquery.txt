 '''jQuery''' is a [[JavaScript|JavaScript library]] created to make it easier and simpler to write [[JavaScript]] and [[HTML]]. It works on most [[web browsers]] < ref name= " jquery.com " > {{cite web|url=http://jquery.com/|title=jQuery: The write less, do more, JavaScript library|publisher=The jQuery Project|accessdate=29 April 2010}} < /ref >  and was invented by [[John Resig]]. The first [[software release|release]] was in January 2006 at [[BarCamp]] NYC. Today there is a [[team]] of [[Programmer|programmers]] working on jQuery, which is led by Dave Methvin. 
 
 Today, more than 55% of the 10,000 most-visited websites use jQuery, hence it is the most popular JavaScript library being used today. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/JQuery|title=jQuery Usage Statistics|accessdate=2012-04-02|archive-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225092702/https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/JQuery|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library/all|title=Usage of JavaScript libraries for websites|publisher=W3Techs|accessdate=2010-07-08}} < /ref >  It is [[free and open source software]] and licensed under the [[MIT License]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://docs.jquery.com/License |title=License â€“ JQuery JavaScript Library |accessdate=2009-11-26}} < /ref > 
 
 jQuery's [[syntax]] is designed to make it easier to write complicated JavaScript. Some things that are easier to do using jQuery are: 
 * navigate (move around) a web page 
 * select (choose) elements on a web page using the [[Document Object Model]] 
 * create [[animation]]s 
 * handle [[Event (computing)|events]] like user actions 
 * create [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax applications]]. 
 It also allows [[Programmer|programmers]] to make their own jQuery [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s.  
 
 Companies like [[Microsoft]] and [[Nokia]] have said that they are going to include jQuery on their [[mobile]] [[platform]]s. < ref name= " 2008-09-28 " > {{cite web |url=http://jquery.com/blog/2008/09/28/jquery-microsoft-nokia/ |title=jQuery, Microsoft, and Nokia |date=2008-09-28 |last=Resig |first=John |publisher=jQuery |work=jQuery Blog |accessdate=2009-01-29 }} < /ref >  In addition, Microsoft is including jQuery in its [[Visual Studio]] software to use with the [[ASP.NET AJAX]] [[framework]] and [[ASP.NET MVC Framework]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx |title=jQuery and Microsoft |last=Guthrie |first=Scott |work=ScottGu's Blog |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2009-01-29 }} < /ref >  Nokia has included it in their Web Run-Time widget development platform. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Guarana_UI:_a_jQuery-Based_UI_Library_for_Nokia_WRT |title=Guarana UI: A jQuery Based UI Library for Nokia WRT |accessdate=2010-03-30 |work=Forum Nokia |archive-date=2009-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123130408/http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Guarana_UI%3A_a_jQuery-Based_UI_Library_for_Nokia_WRT |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  jQuery has also been used in [[MediaWiki]] since version 1.16. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/JQuery |title=jQuery |publisher=MediaWiki |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2012}} < /ref >
