 ==Types== 
 There are two basic types of truss: 
 * The pitched truss, or common truss, uses triangular shaped bases. It is most often used for roof construction.  
 * The parallel chord truss, or flat truss, gets its name from its parallel top and bottom chords. It is often used for floor construction.
