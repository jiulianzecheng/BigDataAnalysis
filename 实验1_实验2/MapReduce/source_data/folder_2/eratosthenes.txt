 '''Eratosthenes of Cyrene''' (276 – 194 BC) was a 3rd century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]], [[geographer]] and [[astronomer]]. He was head of the [[Library of Alexandria]] from 240 {{sc|BC}} until his death: this was the most important library of the ancient world. 
 
 According to the [[Suda]], < ref > The massive 10th century [[Byzantine]] [[encyclopedia]] of the ancient [[Mediterranean]] world < /ref >  his contemporaries nicknamed him ''Beta'', (the second letter of the Greek alphabet), because he was the second best in the world in almost any field. < ref > Asimov, Isaac. 1975. ''Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of science and technology'', Entry #42,  " Eratosthenes " , p. 29. Pan Books, London. {{ISBN|0-330-24323-3}}. < /ref >  Eratosthenes was a friend of [[Archimedes]], who also lived and worked in Alexandria. Archimedes was the greatest [[mathematician]] and [[inventor]] of the age, so perhaps the Beta [[nickname]] was not unjust. 
 
 The works Eratosthenes wrote are known to us only indirectly: the great Library was destroyed, and no copies survived. Strabo (~63 < small > BC < /small > –24 < small > AD < /small > ) wrote about geography in antiquity. He tells us that the works of Eratosthenes were ''On the measurement of the Earth'' and ''Geographica''. 
 
 Eratosthenes made several remarkable discoveries and inventions. He was the first person to calculate the [[circumference]] of the [[Earth]] (with remarkable accuracy), and he invented a system of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. He calculated the tilt of the earth's axis (again with remarkable accuracy); he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the [[leap day]]. < ref name= " Wired " > [https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/06/dayintech_0619 'Wired' 2008] < /ref >  He created a [[map]] of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era. Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of [[Troy]]. 
 
 == Measuring the Earth's circumference == 
 [[File:Eratosthenes measure of Earth circumference.svg|thumb|Measurements taken at Alexandria and Syene]] 
 
 Eratosthenes measured the [[circumference]] of the Earth without leaving Egypt. He knew that on the [[summer solstice]] at local noon at the [[Syene]] on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the sun would appear at the directly overhead. He also knew, from measurement, that in [[Alexandria]], the angle of [[elevation]] of the sun would be 1/50 of a full circle (7[[Degree (angle)|°]]12[[Minute|']]) south of the [[zenith]] at the same time. 
 
 Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 1/50 of the total circumference of the Earth (360 degrees). < ref > 50 x 7°12' = 360° < /ref >  His estimated distance between the cities was 5000 stadia ({{convert|925|km|abbr=off|disp=or}}) by estimating the time that he had taken to travel from Syene to Alexandria by [[camel]]. He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 250,000 stadia. The exact size of the stadion he used is frequently argued. The common [[Attic]] stadium was about {{convert|185|m|abbr=off}}, which would imply a circumference of {{convert|46250|km|abbr=off|disp=or}}, which is {{convert|6250|km|abbr=off}} different from the currently accepted circumference of the Earth ({{convert|40000|km|abbr=off|disp=or}}). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://traianus.rediris.es/topo01/surveying.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205033538/http://traianus.rediris.es/topo01/surveying.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-05 |title=Roman Surveying |author=Isaac Moreno Gallo |others=translated by Brian R. Bishop |date=2004}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://anthonybloggeneral.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/eratosthenes-earth-circumference/|title=How did Eratosthenes measure the circumference of the earth?|date=3 July 2012|publisher=}} < /ref >  The method is an early application of [[trigonometry]] in the measurement science of [[geodesy]].

 === The sieve of Eratosthenes === 
 In [[mathematics]], the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους) is a simple, ancient [[algorithm]] for finding all [[prime number]]s up to a specified integer. < ref > Horsley, Rev. Samuel F.R.S. 1772. ''Κόσκινον Ερατοσθένους''  or, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, being an account of his method of finding all the prime numbers. ''Philosophical Transactions''. '''62''', 327-347. < /ref >  It works efficiently for the smaller primes (below 10 million). < ref > The Prime Glossary:  " The Sieve of Eratosthenes " , 
 http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=SieveOfEratosthenes, references 16. November 2008. < /ref > 
 The sieve was described and attributed to Eratosthenes in the ''Introduction to Arithmetic'' by [[Nicomachus of Gerasa|Nicomachus]]. < ref > [https://archive.org/stream/nicomachigerasen00nicouoft#page/29/mode/1up Nicomachus ''Introduction to arithmetic'', I, 13] < /ref >

 === Other === 
 Eratosthenes went further and computed the tilt of the Earth's axis to within a degree. This is the tilt which is the main cause of the annual climate cycle of spring, summer, autumn, winter. He also deduced the length of the year as 365¼ days. He suggested that calendars should have a leap day every fourth year, an idea taken up two centuries later by [[Julius Caesar]]. < ref name= " Wired "  / >
