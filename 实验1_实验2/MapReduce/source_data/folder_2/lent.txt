 '''Lent''', in the [[Christianity|Christian tradition]], is a period of about six weeks before [[Easter]]. It is a time in which Christians are supposed to be quiet and thoughtful, preparing themselves for Easter.  They should [[prayer|pray]] a lot, give money to [[Charitable organization|charities]] and give up some of the things they might otherwise do for pleasure.  The period of Lent ends at Easter, which is a time of great celebration as the Christians think of how [[Jesus]] had died on the [[crucifix|cross]] but then rose again from the dead. 
 
 Lent is traditionally supposed to be forty days long. That is because the [[Bible]] says that Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness, preparing for his death and [[resurrection]]. 
 
 Lent begins on [[Ash Wednesday]]. In the [[Catholic Church]], it ends at the Ninth Hour of [[Maundy Thursday]] (44 days). In The Anglican Catholic Church, it ends on [[Holy Saturday]] (46 days). 
 
 Churches in the [[Byzantine]] tradition (for example, [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]]) count the days of Lent differently.  There are also different local traditions in the [[Oriental Orthodox]] church. 
 
 Lent is traditionally a time for fasting (not eating much).  This tradition was useful because it was a time when food which had been kept for the winter had to be eaten up before it went bad. Many [[Roman Catholics]] do not eat meat other than [[fish]] on Fridays during Lent. 
 
 The word  " lent "  came from the [[Old English]] ''lencten'' meaning  " [[spring (season)|spring]] "  (the season).
