 '''Mayfair''' (first called '''The May Fair''') is an area in [[central London]]. It is in the [[city]] of [[Westminster]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Mayfair is named after the annual [[fortnight]]-long ''May Fair'' that happened in a place that is [[Shepherd Market]] today (from [[1686]] until it was banned at that place in [[1764]]). Until 1686, the May Fair was held in [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]], and after 1764, it moved to Fair Field in [[Bow, London|Bow]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://flugradar.info/|title=ðŸ¥‡ â–· Flight radar 24 â–· Free, worldwide flight tracking Â» IN REAL TIME|website=Flugradar.info}} < /ref > 
 
 Mayfair was bordered by [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to the west, [[Oxford Street]] to the north, [[Piccadilly]] to the south and Bond Street to the east, although the eastern boundary has been made longer recently, so now it goes all the way to [[Regent Street]]. Most of the area was first made between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century. 
 
 The district is mostly [[commerce|commercial]] now. It has many offices in houses and new buildings. The price of [[Renting|rents]] in Mayfair are some of the highest in [[London]] and the [[Earth|world]]. There is still a large number of houses as well as some [[wikt:exclusive|exclusive]] shopping and London's largest number of luxury [[Hotels in London|hotels]] and many restaurants. Some buildings in Mayfair are: 
 * The Canadian High Commission and the [[United States]] embassy in [[Grosvenor Square]]

 * The [[Handel House Museum]], 
 * The [[Grosvenor House Hotel]]
