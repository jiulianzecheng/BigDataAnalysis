 '''Mitochondria'''  < ref > single = 'mitochondrion'; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''mitos'', a thread + ''khondrion'', granule < /ref >  (sing. mitochondrion) are [[organelle]]s, or parts of a [[eukaryote]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. They are in the [[cytoplasm]], not the [[nucleus]]. 
 
 They make most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate ([[ATP]]), a [[molecule]] that cells use as a source of energy. Their main job is to convert [[energy]]. They [[Oxidation|oxidise]] [[glucose]] to provide energy for the cell. The [[process]] makes ATP, and is called [[cellular respiration]]. < ref > Henze K.  &  Martin W. 2003.

 In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in a range of other processes, such as [[signal]]ling, [[cellular differentiation]], [[apoptosis|cell death]], as well as the control of the [[cell division]] cycle and [[cell growth]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=McBride H.M; Neuspiel M.  &  Wasiak S. |title=Mitochondria: more than just a powerhouse |journal=Curr.

 == Structure == 
 A mitochondrion contains two [[membrane]]s. These are made of [[phospholipid]] double layers and [[protein]]s. The two membranes have different properties. Because of this double-membraned organization, there are five distinct compartments within the mitochondrion. They are: 
 # the outer mitochondrial membrane, 
 # the intermembrane space (the space between the outer and inner membranes), 
 # the inner mitochondrial membrane, 
 # the cristae space (formed by infoldings of the inner membrane), and 
 # the matrix (space within the inner membrane). Mitochondria are small, spherical or cylindrical organelles. Generally a mitochondrion is 2.8 microns long and about 0.5 microns wide. it is about 150 times smaller than the nucleus. There are about 100-150 mitochondria in each cell. 
 
 == Function == 
 The mitochondria's main role in the cell is to take [[glucose]] and use the energy they stored in its chemical bonds to make [[ATP]] in a process called [[cellular respiration]]. There are 3 main steps to this process: [[glycolysis]], the [[citric acid cycle]] or [[Krebs cycle]], and [[ATP]] Synthesis. This ATP is released from the mitochondrion, and broken down by the other [[organelle]]s of the cell to power their own functions. < ref > {{cite book |author=Campbell, Reece | display-authors = etal |title=Biology: concepts and connections. |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780536401151 |year=2008 }} < /ref > 
 
 == DNA == 
 It is thought that mitochondria were once independent [[bacteria]], and became part of the [[eukaryotic]] cells by being engulfed, a process called [[endosymbiosis]]. < ref > Lake, James A. Evidence for an early prokaryote symbiogenesis. ''Nature'' '''460''' 967–971. < /ref > 
 
 Most of a cell's DNA is in the [[cell nucleus]], but the mitochondrion has its own independent [[genome]]. Also, its DNA shows substantial similarity to [[bacteria]]l genomes. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Andersson S.G. | display-authors = etal |title=On the origin of mitochondria: a genomics perspective |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B, Biol. Sci. |volume=358 |issue=1429 |pages=165–77; discussion 177–9 |year=2003  |pmid=12594925 |pmc=1693097 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1193}} < /ref > 
 
 The shorthand for [[mitochondrial DNA]] is ''either'' '''mDNA''' or '''mtDNA'''. Both have been used by researchers. 
 
 == Inheritance == 
 Mitochondria divide by [[binary fission]] similar to bacterial cell division. In single-celled eukaryotes, division of mitochondria is linked to [[cell division]]. This division must be controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in humans for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. 
 
 An individual's mitochondrial genes are not inherited by the same mechanism as nuclear genes. The mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually comes from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but are marked for later destruction. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Sutovsky P. | display-authors = etal|year=1999|title=Ubiquitin tag for sperm mitochondria|journal=Nature|volume=402| issue = 6760|pages=371–372|doi=10.1038/46466| pmid = 10586873| s2cid = 205054671}} Discussed in [http://www.sciencenews.org/20000101/fob3.asp ''Science News''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219174548/http://www.sciencenews.org/20000101/fob3.asp |date=2007-12-19 }}. < /ref >  The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate the cells of the adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited down the female line, known as ''maternal inheritance''. This mode is true for all animals, and most other organisms. However, mitochondria is inherited ''paternally'' in some [[conifer]]s, though not in [[pine]]s or [[yew]]s. < ref > {{cite journal| author=Mogensen H.L. |year=1996| title=The hows and whys of cytoplasmic inheritance in seed plants| journal=American Journal of Botany| volume=83 | pages = 383–404 | doi = 10.2307/2446172| issue=3|jstor=2446172}} < /ref > 
 
 A single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. < ref name=Wiesner > {{cite journal | author=Wiesner R.J; Ruegg J.C.  &  Morano I. |year=1992 |title=Counting target molecules by exponential polymerase chain reaction, copy number of mitochondrial DNA in rat tissues | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta. | volume=183 |pages=553–559 | pmid=1550563 | issue=2|doi=10.1016/0006-291x(92)90517-o }} < /ref >  For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is thought to reproduce by [[binary fission]], so producing exact copies. However, there is some evidence that animal mitochondria can undergo [[recombination]]. < ref > {{cite journal| author=Lunt D.B.  &  Hyman B.C. | title=Animal mitochondrial DNA recombination | url=https://archive.org/details/sim_nature-uk_1997-05-15_387_6630/page/247 | journal=Nature | volume=387 | date=15 May 1997 | pmid=9153388 | doi=10.1038/387247a0 | pages=247| issue=6630 | bibcode=1997Natur.387..247L | s2cid=4318161 }} < /ref >  If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single [[haploid]] genome, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations. 
 
 === Population genetic studies === 
 The near-absence of [[recombination]] in mitochondrial DNA makes it useful for [[population genetics]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Castro J.A; Picornell A.  &  Ramon M. | title=Mitochondrial DNA: a tool for populational genetics studies | journal=Int Microbiol. | year=1998 | volume=1 | issue=4 | pages=327–32| pmid=10943382}} < /ref >  If all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single [[haploid]] unit, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be seen as a [[phylogenetic tree|gene tree]]. Patterns in these gene trees can be used to [[inference|infer]] the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is where the [[molecular clock]] can be used to give a date for the so-called [[mitochondrial Eve]]. < ref > {{cite journal | journal=Nature. | volume=325 | pages=31–36 | date=1987 | doi=10.1038/325031a0 | title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution | author=Cann R.L; Stoneking M.  &  Wilson A.C. | pmid=3025745 | issue=6099| bibcode=1987Natur.325...31C | s2cid=4285418 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Torroni A | display-authors = etal |title=Harvesting the fruit of the human mtDNA tree |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_trends-in-genetics_2006-06_22_6/page/339 |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=339–45 |year=2006 |pmid=16678300 | doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.001 }} < /ref >  This is often interpreted as strong support for the spread of modern humans out of Africa. < ref name=Garrigan06 > {{cite journal |author=Garrigan D.  &  Hammer M.F. |title=Reconstructing human origins in the genomic era |journal=Nat.

 However, mitochondrial DNA only reflects the history of females in a population. It may not represent the history of the population as a whole. To some extent, paternal genetic sequences from the [[Y-chromosome]] can be used. < ref name=Garrigan06/ >  In a broader sense, only studies that also include [[nuclear DNA]] can provide a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population. < ref > {{cite journal | journal=Am J Hum Genet. | date=1997 | volume=60 | issue=4 | pages=772–89 | title=Archaic African and Asian lineages in the genetic ancestry of modern humans | author=Harding R.M. | display-authors = etal | pmid=9106523 | pmc=1712470}} < /ref >
