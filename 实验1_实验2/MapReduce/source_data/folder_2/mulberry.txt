 '''Mulberry''' (''Morus'') is a [[genus]] of 10–16 species of [[tree]]s. They are native to warm regions of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[the Americas]], with most of the species native to Asia. 
 
 Mulberries are fast-growing when young but soon become slow-growing and rarely grow over 10-15 [[metre|meters]] tall. The leaves are simple, often lobed, and ridged. The [[fruit]] grows in bunches, 2-3 [[centimeter]]s long, is red to dark purple in color, edible, and sweet with a good flavor in several species. 
 
 The [[fruit]] is used in [[pie]]s, [[tart]]s, and [[wine]]s. The fruit of the black mulberry, native to southwest Asia, and the red mulberry, native to eastern North America, have the strongest flavor. The fruit of the white mulberry, an east Asian species, has a very weak flavor. 
 
 Mulberries can be grown from [[seed]]s, which is the best idea as seedling-grown trees are generally healthier. However, they are often planted from large pieces cut from other mulberry trees, which easily take root.

 {{Main|Morus alba}} 
 Mulberry leaves, particularly those of the white mulberry, ''Morus alba'', are important as the food of the [[silkworm]], the [[cocoon]] of which is used to make [[silk]]. ''Morus alba'' is also notable for the rapid release of its [[pollen]], which is launched at over half the speed of sound.
