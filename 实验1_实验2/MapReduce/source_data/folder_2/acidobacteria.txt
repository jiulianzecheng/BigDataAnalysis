 The [[phylum]] ''acidobacteria'' is distributed across nearly all ecosystems. ''Acidobacteria'' are particularly abundant in acidic soils, peatlands and environments with rich iron minerals. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Kalam|first1=Sadaf|last2=Basu|first2=Anirban|last3=Ahmad|first3=Iqbal|last4=Sayyed|first4=R.

 The characteristics of ''acidobacteria'' are [[gram-negative]] (gram staining negative), non-[[spore]]-forming and with multiple shapes. In most cases, they reproduce through [[binary fission]] (separate a body into two new parts). Most ''acidobacteria'' get energy from chemical substances (chemoheterotrophs), but some get it from light. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 Due to the most acidobacteria's capacity to live with a low level of nutrients, ''acidobacteria'' are hard to culture on the conventional growth media in the laboratory. Hence, they were underrepresented until gene analysis in recent decades. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Currently, ''acidobacteria'' have 26 subdivisions based on the results of DNA analysis. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Barns|first1=Susan M.|last2=Cain|first2=Elizabeth C.|last3=Sommerville|first3=Leslie|last4=Kuske|first4=Cheryl R.|date=May 2007|title=Acidobacteria Phylum Sequences in Uranium-Contaminated Subsurface Sediments Greatly Expand the Known Diversity within the Phylum|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=73|issue=9|pages=3113–3116|doi=10.1128/AEM.02012-06|issn=0099-2240|pmc=1892891|pmid=17337544}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Acidobacteria'' has a large proportion of the genes encoding proteins that can transport nutrients from the environment into cells, which facilitates ''acidobacteria'' to acquire a wide range of nutrients, helping them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Ecological roles == 
 
 === Modulation of biogeochemical cycles === 
 ''Acidobacteria'' contains genes that help them in degrading sugar polymers. They can act as [[decomposer]]s in soil and recycle organic matters produced by plants, fungi and insects. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/047001590X|title=eLS|date=2001-05-30|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-01617-6|editor-last=John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd|edition=1|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0027685}} < /ref >  ''Acidobacteria'' is likely to supplement their energy intake with [[carbon monoxide]](CO), but this remains to be confirmed. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Naomi L.|last2=Challacombe|first2=Jean F.|last3=Janssen|first3=Peter H.|last4=Henrissat|first4=Bernard|last5=Coutinho|first5=Pedro M.|last6=Wu|first6=Martin|last7=Xie|first7=Gary|last8=Haft|first8=Daniel H.|last9=Sait|first9=Michelle|last10=Badger|first10=Jonathan|last11=Barabote|first11=Ravi D.|date=April 2009|title=Three Genomes from the Phylum Acidobacteria Provide Insight into the Lifestyles of These Microorganisms in Soils|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=75|issue=7|pages=2046–2056|doi=10.1128/AEM.02294-08|issn=0099-2240|pmc=2663196|pmid=19201974}} < /ref >  They significantly contribute to the [[carbon cycle]] in these two major parts: degradations of sugars and CO oxidation. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 ''Acidobacteria'' can process nitrogen in many different forms and they play a central role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] in plant-soil ecosystems. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Some members of ''acidobacteria'' can do [[anaerobic respiration]] (respiration without oxygen) and promote the global [[sulfur cycle]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Some ''acidobacteria'' can breathe oxygen at atmospheric and at very low oxygen concentrations. They have survival advantages in soils with a low level of oxygen. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Some strains can consume [[hydrogen]] (H < sub > 2 < /sub > ) at the atmospheric level and this contributes to the global hydrogen cycle. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Eichorst|first1=Stephanie A.|last2=Trojan|first2=Daniela|last3=Roux|first3=Simon|last4=Herbold|first4=Craig|last5=Rattei|first5=Thomas|last6=Woebken|first6=Dagmar|date=March 2018|title=Genomic insights into the Acidobacteria reveal strategies for their success in terrestrial environments|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=1041–1063|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.14043|issn=1462-2912|pmc=5900883|pmid=29327410}} < /ref > 
 
 === Production of complex sugars === 
 ''Acidobacteria'' species can produce and send complex sugars to the outside of their cells , which could help plant roots uptake nutrients and water from soils by modifying the properties of soils around roots. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  These sugars also support bacteria to adhere to the root surfaces. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Kielak|first1=Anna M.|last2=Cipriano|first2=Matheus A.
