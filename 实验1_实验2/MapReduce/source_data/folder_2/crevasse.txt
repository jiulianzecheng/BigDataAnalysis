 A '''crevasse''' is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an [[ice sheet]] or [[glacier]]. It is like a [[Fracture (geology)|crevice]] that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement caused by the [[shear stress]] between two semi-rigid pieces of ice. 
 
 Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create [[serac]]s, [[arch]]es, and other ice formations. < ref name= " Crevasses on Glacier " > {{cite journal | title=Crevasses on Glaciers | author=van der Veen, C | journal=[[Polar Geography]] | year=1990 | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=213â€“245 | doi=10.1080/10889379909377677}} < /ref >
