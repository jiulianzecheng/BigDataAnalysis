 '''Buckwheat''' (or '''common buckwheat''') is a [[plant]] whose seeds may be used as a [[cereal]]. < ref > Agriculture Canada. (1978). Growing buckwheat. Ottawa Canada: Canadian Department of Agriculture. < /ref >  Buckwheat is not a true [[grass]]. It is not related to [[wheat]], because [[wheat]] ''is'' a true [[grass]], and buckwheat is not.  
 
 Buckwheat seeds look like small [[beech|beech tree]] seeds. Both seeds have three sides. ''Beech'' is also called ''buck'', which is how buckwheat got its name.  
 
 Instead, buckwheat is related to [[sorrel]], [[knotweed]], and [[rhubarb]]. Buckwheat is referred to as a ''pseudocereal'' because its seeds are used in cooking the same as cereals, because they have complex [[carbohydrates]]. 
 
 The cultivation of buckwheat grain declined sharply in the 20th century with the adoption of nitrogen [[fertilizer]] which increased the productivity of other staples.
