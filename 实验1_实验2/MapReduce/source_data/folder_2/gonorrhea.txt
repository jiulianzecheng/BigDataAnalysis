 It is caused by a [[bacteria|bacterium]], ''Neisseria gonorrheae''. Since it is caused by a bacterium, it can be treated with [[antibiotics]].

This is because the bacterium is becoming immune or resistant to the medicine. When this happens, the infection is more difficult to cure. < ref name= " BaardaSikora2015 " / >
