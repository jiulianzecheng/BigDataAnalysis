 '''Shiprock''' is the remains of an [[extinct volcano]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Mexico]].  
 
 Shiprock is composed of fractured [[volcano|volcanic]] [[breccia]] and black [[Dike (geology)|dike]]s of [[igneous]] rock. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano. The exposed rock was probably formed 2,500–3000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but exposed after millions of years of [[erosion]].  
 
 [[Radiometric dating]] of the rock shows that the volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field. [[El Capitan]] in [[Monument Valley]] is another prominent volcanic neck in this field. < ref name= " semken " > Steven C. Semken 2001.
