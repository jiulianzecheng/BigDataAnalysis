 Antithesis is often used to express contrasting ideas and strengthen arguments by pointing out differences. This makes it more memorable and catchy for readers and listeners alike in [[literature]], [[advertisements]] and [[music]].  < ref >  {{cite web|title=What is Antithesis, and How Do You Use It In Writing?|url=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/antithesis/|publisher=Grammarly|access-date=29 December 2023}}  < /ref >  It does the latter by showing that the arguer's own idea is better.  < ref >  {{cite web|title=How to Use Antithesis In Your Writing|url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-use-antithesis-in-your-writing|website=MasterClass|access-date=29 December 2023}}  < /ref >
