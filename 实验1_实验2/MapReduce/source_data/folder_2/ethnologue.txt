'''Ethnologue''' is an annual [[publication]] which lists information about all living languages of the world. Ethnologue uses  a three letter code to identify a [[language]]. It also classifies the languages into ten different groups, based on how common they are. The classification is from international language, to extinct language.  The organism that publishes Ethnologue is called [[SIL international]].
