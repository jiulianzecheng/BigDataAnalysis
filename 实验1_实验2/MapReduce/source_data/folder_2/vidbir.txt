 '''''Yevrobachennia: Natsionalnyi Vidbir''' (''meaning  " Eurovision: National Selection " ), informally known as '''''Vidbir''''', is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] music competition which began in [[2016]]. The winner of the contest gets the chance to represent Ukraine at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. 
 
 == Format == 
 Each contest lasts for one show. Once all of the entrants have performed, they are ranked by both a jury and a public vote which give a set of points based on the rankings (for example, if there are six contestants, then the highest ranked contestant gets 6 points, with the lowest getting 1). The points are then combined and the highest scorer wins.
