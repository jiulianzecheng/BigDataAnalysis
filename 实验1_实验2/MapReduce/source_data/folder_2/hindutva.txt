 According to Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist specializing in South Asia, the Hindutva ideology has roots in an era where the fiction in ancient Indian mythology and the [[Vedic|Vedics]]  was thought to be valid. This fiction was used to  " give sustenance to Hindu ethnic consciousness " . Its strategy emulated the Muslim identity politics of the Khilafat movement after World War I, and borrowed political concepts from the West – & nbsp;mainly Germany. < ref name= " Jaffrelot1996p77 " > Jaffrelot, Christophe 2009.

 According to Anthony Parel, a historian and political scientist, V. D. Savarkar's ''Hindutva, Who is a Hindu?'' (1923) is a fundamental text of Hindutva ideology. He comments on Savarkar's summary of Hindu culture  " as a self-sufficient culture, not needing any input from other cultures "  by saying that this is  " an unhistorical, narcissistic and false account of India's past " . < ref name= " Parel2006p42 " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQhz0fW0HZUC|title=Gandhi's Philosophy and the Quest for Harmony|author=Anthony J.

 Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, a Fellow of the British Academy and a scholar of Politics and Philosophy of Religion, says that Hindutva is a form of [[nationalism]] that is seen differently by its opponents and its supporters. The Hindutva ideology according to Savarkar, states Ram-Prasad, is based on   " [[geography]], [[Race (sociology)|race]], and [[culture]] " . < ref > Ram‐Prasad, C. (1993).
