The '''Siderian''' is the first [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]] in the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] that began 2.5 [[billion]] years ago, and ended at 2.3 billion years ago. Before it was the [[Neoarchaean]] It is followed by the [[Rhyacian]]. 
 
 [[Banded iron formation]]s (BIFs) became very abundant early this period. BIFs were formed as anaerobic [[algae]] produced waste [[oxygen]] that combined with [[iron]], forming [[magnetite]] (Fe < sub > 3 < /sub > O < sub > 4 < /sub > , an [[iron oxide]]). This process cleared iron from the oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, without an oxygen sink in the oceans, the process created the oxygen-rich [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of today. This event is known as the [[oxygen catastrophe]], which according to some geologists triggered the [[Huronian glaciation]]. < ref > Paleoclimates: The First Two Billion Years - James F.
