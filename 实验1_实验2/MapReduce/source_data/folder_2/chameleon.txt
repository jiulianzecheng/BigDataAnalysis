 '''Chameleons''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[lizard]]s. Most can change the colour of their [[skin]]s for [[camouflage]], or to signal [[mood]] to other chameleons.  
 
 They are a [[clade]] of lizards. They have parrot-like zygodactylous feet, < ref > Zygodactyly: (birds) an arrangement with two toes facing forward (digits 2 and 3) and two back (digits 1 and 4); (chameleons) the feet are fused into a group of two and a group of three toes which oppose one another to grasp branches in a pincer-like arrangement. Zygodactyly is most common in [[arboreal]] species, particularly those that climb tree trunks or clamber through foliage.

 Their eyes are separately mobile and [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]. < ref > Eyes can focus and move independently. < /ref >  Their very long tongues can flick out, and their movement sways like leaves in the wind. Their prehensile (grabbing) tail can hang onto branches and many can change colour. They eat insects. 
 
 Chameleons have long sticky [[tongue]]s that they can fire out in a fraction of a second. They stretch up to twice their body size. Their eyes can move independently. The largest species is about 1.5 feet when fully grown. They are mainly [[insectivores]], but larger species may take occasional smaller lizards and young birds. < ref > Dever, Jennifer 2007.

 There are about 160 species, living in [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], across [[south Asia]], [[Sri Lanka]]. They have been introduced to [[Hawaii]], [[California]] and [[Florida]], and are found in warm habitats that vary from rain forest to desert conditions. Chameleons are often kept as household pets. 
 
 == Tiny chameleons == 
 The world's tiniest reptile has been found on [[Madagascar]].  It is a chameleon 13.5mm long. < ref > 'Smallest reptile on Earth' discovered in Madagascar. ''BBC News'' [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55945948]. < /ref >  It hunts for [[mites]] on the [[rainforest]] floor and hides from predators at night in blades of grass. Other species of tiny chameleons have been found. < ref > Glaw, Frank ''et al.'' 2012.

 == Vision == 
 [[File:Looking twice with one look (32411816261).jpg|thumb|220px|Independent eye movement]] 
 Chameleons have 360-degree eye-turning, the ability to zoom in and out, and [[binocular vision]].

 Each of the chameleon's eyes can move separately, < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://animals.mom.me/unusual-chameleons-eyes-2288.html|title=What is unusual about a chameleon's eyes?|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en}} < /ref >  allowing them to see all around them at all times.  
 
 Chameleons have two eyes whose vision overlaps. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.google.ca/search?q=binocular+vision & rlz=1C1CHWA_enCA682CA682 & oq=binocular+ & aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.7461j1j7 & sourceid=chrome & ie=UTF-8|title=binocular vision - Google Search|website=www.google.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}} < /ref >  This gives them  [[3D]] vision. They can switch to [[monocular vision]], which is seeing with each eye independently. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://asknature.org/strategy/eyes-give-360-vision/|title=Eyes give 360° vision : Chameleon - AskNature|work=AskNature|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}} < /ref >  This gives them more flexible sight.
