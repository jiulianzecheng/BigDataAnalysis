 '''Echolocation''' is a way that some animals use to determine the location of things. They emit sound waves and listen for the echo. They use the delay to determine the distance. It is a kind of biological [[sonar]].  
 
 [[Microbat]]s find their [[insect]] [[prey]] in the dark this way.  [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are two other kinds of [[mammal]]s that use echolocation. Their sound waves go through the water, while the bats' sound waves go through the [[air]]. < ref >  {{cite book |title= Magic School Bus: the truth about bats|last= Cole|first= Joanne |author2= Bruce Degen|year= 2001|publisher= Scholastic Inc.|location= United States of America|isbn= 0-439-31432-1|pages= 13}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Radar]] is man-made echolocation using [[radio wave]]s.
