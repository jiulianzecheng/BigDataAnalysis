Most of these are known as [[psychedelic mushrooms]]. It grows in [[Europe]], [[South America]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]]. Mushrooms that contain psilocybin are known as magic mushrooms. 
 
 The substance is used as a recreational drug. It is illegal in many countries. 
 
 Psilocybin works by activating serotonin receptors, most often in the [[Pre-frontal cortex|prefrontal cortex.]] This part of the brain affects mood, cognition, and perception. Hallucinogens also work in other regions of the brain that regulate arousal and panic responses. < ref name= " medicalnewstoday 2021 " > {{Cite web |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308850 |title=What are magic mushrooms and psilocybin? |date=October 3, 2021 |publisher=MedicalNewsToday |access-date=January 16, 2023 |archive-date=January 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230109023407/https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/308850 |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 The hallucinogenic effects of psilocybin usually occur within 30 minutes after a person ingests it and last 4–6 hours. In some individuals, changes in sensory perception and thought patterns can last for several days. 
 
 In 2016, [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medicine]] researchers first reported that treatment with psilocybin under psychologically supported conditions significantly relieved existential [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]] in people. < ref name= " johns hopkins release 2016 " > {{cite web |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer |title=Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Eases Existential Anxiety in People With Life-Threatening Cancer |date=December 2, 2016 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medicine]] |access-date=January 16, 2023 |archive-date=January 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230116170324/https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref name= " nih " > {{cite journal |title=Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial |date=December 2016 |first1=Roland R. |last1=Griffiths |first2=Matthew W. |last2=Johnson |first3=Michael A. |last3=Carducci |first4=Annie |last4=Umbricht |first5=William A. |last5=Richards |first6=Brian D. |last6=Richards |first7=Mary P. |last7=Cosimano |first8=Margaret A. |last8=Klinedinst |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=1181–1197 |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] |doi=10.1177/0269881116675513 |pmid=27909165 |pmc=5367557 }} < /ref >
