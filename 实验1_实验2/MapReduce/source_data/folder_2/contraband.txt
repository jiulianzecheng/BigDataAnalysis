 In [[international law]], contraband means [[goods]] sent to [[Territory|territories]] under the control of the [[enemy]] that can be used in [[armed conflict]]. < ref > 'San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea', ''International Committee of the Red Cross'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 148 < /ref >  Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, '''absolute contraband''' and '''conditional contraband'''. Absolute contraband includes [[Small arms|arms]], [[munitions]], and various materials. These can include [[chemical]]s and certain types of [[machinery]] that may be used to wage [[war]]. 
 
 Conditional contraband includes [[food]] and [[livestock]] feed. Cargo of this kind, while presumably innocent in character, can be seized if the supplies are destined for the [[armed forces]] of the enemy. Under conditions of modern warfare almost everything can be called absolute contraband. 
 
 == American Civil War == 
 During the [[American Civil War]], [[Slavery|slaves]] who sought refuge in [[Union army]] military camps or who lived in territories that fell under Union control were declared contraband.  This policy was first used by General [[Benjamin F. Butler]] in 1861, in what came to be known as the  " Fort Monroe Doctrine, "  established in [[Hampton, Virginia]].  By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the [[Southern United States]].  The [[Roanoke Island]] Freedmen's Colony (1863–1867) was developed to be a [[colony]]. < ref name= " learnNC " > [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-civilwar/4590  " The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony " ], provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010 < /ref >  Many [[adult]] former slaves worked for wages for the Army at such camps.
