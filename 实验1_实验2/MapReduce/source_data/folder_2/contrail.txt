 A '''contrail''' (condensation trail) is a cloud-like trail of [[water vapor]] or ice crystals left by an [[airplane]]. When jet [[fuel]] burns, it produces water vapor and carbon dioxide. The water vapor condenses (turns from gas to liquid) because of the low temperature at the high [[altitude]] that the plane is flying. The [[chemtrail]] conspiracy theory claims that these trails may contain harmful chemicals being sprayed by government organizations.
