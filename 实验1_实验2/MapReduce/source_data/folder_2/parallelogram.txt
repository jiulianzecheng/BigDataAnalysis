 A '''parallelogram''' is a [[polygon]] with four sides (a [[quadrilateral]]). It has two pairs of [[parallel]] sides ([[Line segment|line segments]] which never meet if the lines were allowed to extend beyond their end points). The opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length (they are equally long). The word  " parallelogram "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word  " parallelogrammon "  (''bounded by parallel lines''). < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=parallelogram & searchmode=none 
  |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work=etymonline.com |accessdate=10 January 2011}} < /ref >  [[Rectangle]]s, [[rhombus]]es, and [[Square (geometry)|squares]] are all parallelograms. 
 
 As shown in the picture on the right, because [[triangle]]s '''''ABE''''' and '''''CDE''''' are [[congruence|congruent]] (have the same shape and size),

 In all Parallelogram's opposite angles are equal to each other. 
 Angles which are not opposite in the Parallelogram will add up to 180 degrees. 
 
 ==Characterizations== 
 A simple (non self-intersecting) [[quadrilateral]] is a parallelogram [[if and only if]]  < u > any one < /u >  of the following statements is true: < ref > Owen Byer, Felix Lazebnik and Deirdre Smeltzer, ''Methods for Euclidean Geometry'', Mathematical Association of America, 2010, pp. 51-52. < /ref > < ref > Zalman Usiskin and Jennifer Griffin,  " The Classification of Quadrilaterals. A Study of Definition " , Information Age Publishing, 2008, p. 22. < /ref > 
 *Two pairs of opposite sides are equal in length 
 *Two pairs of opposite angles are equal in measure 
 *The [[diagonal]]s bisect each other 
 *One pair of opposite sides are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and equal in length 
 *[[Adjacent angles]] are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]] 
 *Each diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[triangle]]s 
 *The sum of the [[Square number|square]]s of the sides equals the sum of the squares of the diagonals. (This is the [[parallelogram law]]) 
 *It has [[rotational symmetry]] of order 2 
 *It has two lines of symmetry 
 
 == Properties == 
 # Opposite sides of parallelogram are parallel. 
 # Any line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area. 
 # Parallelograms  are quadrilaterals. 
 
 == Area formula == 
 A parallelogram can be cut into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], and be rearranged to make a [[rectangle]]. This mean the area of a parallelogram is the same with with a rectangle of the same height and base as that parallelogram:
