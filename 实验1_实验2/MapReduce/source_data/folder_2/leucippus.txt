 '''Leucippus''' or '''Leukippos''' ({{lang-grc|Λεύκιππος}}, first half of 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]]) was a Greek philosopher. He was an early philosopher of [[atomic theory|atomism]], the idea that everything is made up of many tiny things which always continue to exist. < ref > Wheelwright P. 1966. ''The Presocratics''. Odyssey Press, p177. < /ref > 
 
 Leucippus was born at [[Miletus]] or [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], < ref > ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Greek Philosophy'', pg. xxiii.  Some said Leucippus was from [[Elea]], for his philosophy is associated with the [[Eleatics|Eleatic philosophers]] < /ref >  although apparently [[Epicurus]] said he never existed. < ref > According to [[Epicurus]], as reported in [[Diogenes Laertius]]' ''Life of Epicurus''. < /ref >  There has long been a [[controversy]] about this. 
 
 Leucippus may have been the first person to suggest the idea of empty space (a [[vacuum]]). It is difficult to know which ideas come from him, and which come from [[Democritus]].
