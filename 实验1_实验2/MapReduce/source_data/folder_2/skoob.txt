 '''Skoob''' is a [[Social media]] for readers in [[Brazil]], launched in January 2009 by Lindenberg Moreira. < ref name= " skoob " > {{cite web|url=http://gazetaonline.globo.com/_conteudo/2010/10/687046-leitura+em+rede.html|title=Leitura em rede|publisher=[[Globo.com]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29|archive-date=2011-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123082613/http://gazetaonline.globo.com/_conteudo/2010/10/687046-leitura+em+rede.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Without adverts, the site became a meeting point for readers and writers who exchanged things about books and made meetings in bookstores. The network allows for interaction with other social medias, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as well as popular stores in Brazil. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI96567-15220,00-REDES+SOCIAIS+TRAZEM+A+LITERATURA+PARA+A+INTERNET.html|title=Redes sociais trazem a literatura para a internet|work=[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]|language=portuguese|accessdate=2011-05-29|archive-date=2011-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204061949/http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI96567-15220,00-REDES+SOCIAIS+TRAZEM+A+LITERATURA+PARA+A+INTERNET.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Skoob's name comes from the English word  " [[book]]s "  spelled backwards. Through free account creation, the user creates a profile showing what books they are reading, have read, want to read, or are no longer reading, thus forming a   " virtual bookshelf " . Users can also add missing titles and share their views on the books via reviews. On January 27, 2012, a survey was made that indicates that Skoob had more than 1,200,000 users. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2012/01/skoob-a-rede-social-de-leitores-brasileiros-chegou-aos-420-mil-usuarios-cadastrados.html|title=Skoob, a rede social de leitores brasileiros, chegou aos 420 mil usuários cadastrados|website=TechTudo|language=portuguese}} < /ref >
