 '''Printmaking''' is making art by [[printing]] pictures, normally on [[paper]]. The advantage of printmaking is that lots of the same picture can be printed. This is called a print. Each print is not a copy, but an original, since it came from the same [[source]] (not like [[paint]]ing or [[draw]]ing).You can also use different types of techniques to start the print. 
 
 == Materials == 
 Pictures for prints can be cut into plates of metal, usually [[copper]] or [[zinc]] for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric plates for [[screen-printing]]. Prints may also be [[publish]]ed in books by the artist.
