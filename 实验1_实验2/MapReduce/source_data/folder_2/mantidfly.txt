 '''Mantidflies''' are insects in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Mantispidae'''. They are small to moderate-sized [[insect]]s in the order [[Neuroptera]].

 ==Description and ecology== 
 Some mantidflies are [[wasp]] [[Batesian mimicry|mimic]]s, < ref > {{cite journal| title=Polymorphic mimicry of polistine wasps by a neotropical Neuropteran| url=https://archive.org/details/sim_biotropica_1981-09_13_3/page/165|first=Paul A. 1981 |last=Opler| journal=Biotropica|year=1981 | volume=13| issue=3| pages=165–176|doi=10.2307/2388121 |jstor=2388121 }} < /ref >  but most are brownish with green, yellow and sometimes red hues.  
 
 They get their name from their [[mantis]]-like appearance, as their spiny  " raptorial "  ([[raptor]]-like) front legs are modified to catch small insect prey and are very similar to the front legs of [[mantid]]s. The adults are [[predator]]y insects that are often [[nocturnal]], and are sometimes attracted by porch lights. They have four membranous wings which may sometimes be patterned (especially in wasp mimicking species) but are usually clear. Adult mantidflies are [[predator]]s of suitably sized [[insect]]s, which they catch as mantids do. Mantidflies are active hunters, but as with other Neuroptera, they are cumbersome fliers. 
 
 Their larvae are either [[parasitoid]]s or predators. Subfamily Symphrasinae larvae are parasitoids on [[bee]], [[wasp]] or [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetle]] larvae. Larvae of the subfamily Calomantispinae are predators of small [[arthropod]]s.  
 
 Larvae of the subfamily Mantispinae seek out female [[spider]]s or their [[egg sac]]s which they then enter; the scarab-like larvae then feed on the spider eggs, draining egg contents through a piercing/sucking tube. Then they [[pupa|pupate]] in the egg sac. < ref name = e+g2007 / > < ref > Redborg K.E. 1998. Biology of the Mantispidae. ''Annual Review of Entomology'' '''43''': 175-194 < /ref >
