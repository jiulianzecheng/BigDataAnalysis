 '''Rickets''' is a [[disease]] that happens in young children.  It happens in children who do not get enough [[vitamin D]] and [[calcium]].  It causes larger spaces inside [[bones]], and makes them dry, like [[Sponge (tool)|sponges]].  It can make the legs curve toward each other (so the [[knee]]s touch) or away from each other. 
 
 Rickets in adults is called '''osteomalacia'''. < ref name=wb > Cole Jr., Madison B. (2016).   " Rickets. "  ''World Book Advanced.'' World Book.  Retrieved February 22, 2016. < /ref > 
 
 The word  " rickets "  comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word ''rhakhis'', which means  " [[spine]]. " 
 
 == Cause == 
 People need both vitamin D and calcium to make their bones strong. 
 
 Vitamin D helps the bones absorb (take up) calcium.  Low vitamin D makes it hard to absorb calcium. < ref name=nof > {{cite web |url=http://nof.org/calcium |title=Calcium and Vitamin D: What You Need to Know |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=National Osteoporosis Foundation |publisher= |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[human body]] makes vitamin D < sub > 3 < /sub >  in the [[skin]], from [[cholesterol]].  Then the [[liver]] changes vitamin D < sub > 3 < /sub >  into [[calcitriol]], which sends calcium from the [[blood]] into the bones.  The bones need calcium to stay strong.  However, the skin will not make vitamin D < sub > 3 < /sub >  unless enough [[ultraviolet]] light shines on it.  [[Sunlight]] contains ultraviolet light, so getting enough sun is one way of getting enough D < sub > 3 < /sub > . < ref name=wb/ > < ref name=nof/ > 
 
 People need calcium for [[calcification]]. Calcification uses calcium to help make bones bigger and stronger.  Low calcium makes bones delicate and easier to [[Bone fracture|break]]. < ref > " Rickets. "  Nutrition and Well-being A-Z. Ed. Delores C.S. James. New York: MacMillan Reference USA, 2004. 2 vols. < /ref > 
 
 == Prevention == 
 Rickets can be prevented if a person gets plenty of calcium and vitamin D. < ref name=wb/ > 
 
 The best way to do this is to get a lot of sunlight, and eat foods that have a lot of vitamin D and calcium in them.  However, people who cannot get enough vitamin D and calcium this way can take supplements (vitamin pills that have calcium and vitamin D in them). < ref name=nof/ > 
 
 ===Calcium=== 
 
 Foods that have a lot of calcium in them include: < ref name=nof/ > 
 * [[Milk]] and other [[dairy product]]s like [[cheese]]s 
 * Some green [[vegetable]]s, like [[broccoli]], [[spinach]], and [[kale]] 
 * Today, many products are  " fortified "  with vitamin D: the vitamin was added when the food was made.  These foods include some kinds of [[orange juice]], [[breakfast cereal]]s, [[bread]]s, and even bottled [[water]].  The food's label will say how much calcium it has in it. 
 
 Calcium is absorbed best by the bones when it is taken in amounts of 1000[[Milligram|mg]] or less.  Because of this, doctors suggest eating smaller amounts of foods with calcium in them, at different times in the day, instead of all at once. < ref name=nof/ > 
 
 ===Vitamin D=== 
 [[File:Frog Pond at Boston Common.jpg|thumb|300px|These people's bodies are making vitamin D while they play in the sun]] 
 There are three ways to get vitamin D: sunlight, foods, or supplements (vitamin pills that have vitamin D in them).  However, many people cannot get enough vitamin D just from their [[diet]]. < ref name=nof/ > 
 
 There are only a few foods that have a lot of vitamin D in them.  They include: < ref name=nof/ > 
 *  " Fatty fish "  that were caught in the wild, like [[mackerel]], [[salmon]], and [[tuna]] 
 * Cooked [[egg yolk]] 
 * Vitamin D is added to some foods, like some kinds of dairy products, cereals, and orange juices 
 
 [[Breastfeeding|Breast milk]] may not have enough vitamin D in it to prevent rickets.  Babies who are only breastfed, and not fed any other foods, may be given vitamin D drops to make sure they do not get rickets. < ref name=mayorisk/ >  However, this is not a significant risk if mothers and child have some exposure to sunlight. Children with dark skin are more likely to need additional vitamin D. 
 
 ==Risk factors== 
 These things make a person more likely to get rickets: < ref name=mayorisk > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rickets/basics/risk-factors/con-20027091 |title=Rickets: Risk Factors |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=June 1, 2013 |website=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Education and Research |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 *They are between three and 36 months old.  Children this age are at the.      greatest risk for rickets because their bones are growing so quickly, and are supposed to get bigger and stronger during this time 
 * They were born [[premature birth|prematurely]] (earlier than normal) 
 * They live in the Northern parts of the world, where there is less sunshine 
 *They spend too little time outside 
 [[File:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|thumb|200px|X-ray of a child with rickets, showing the legs curving outward]] 
 *They always wear [[sunscreen]] when going out 
 ** Even mild sunscreen decreases the amount of vitamin D the body makes by 95% (by stopping the body from taking in vitamin D from sunlight) 
 ** However, people should still wear sunscreen when they might get [[sunburn]]ed 
 *They do not eat enough food that has calcium or vitamin D in it, because of [[lactose intolerance]] or a strict [[vegan]] [[diet]] 
 *They cannot make or use vitamin D because of a [[disease|medical disorder]], like [[coeliac disease]], or because they take certain [[anticonvulsant|anti-seizure medications]] 
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 [[Signs and symptoms]] of rickets include: < ref name=wb/ > 
 * Brittle (easily broken) bones or [[teeth]] 
 * [[Bleeding]] more than normal 
 * Stunted growth (not growing like a healthy child would) 
 * [[Sweating]] 
 * Weakness (feeling tired all the time) 
 * Body [[pain]]
