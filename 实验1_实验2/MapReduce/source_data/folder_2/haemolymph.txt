'''Haemolymph''' (hemolymph) is a blood-like fluid in the [[circulatory system]] of [[insects]] and other [[Arthropods]] ([[spiders]] and [[crustaceans]]). [[Molluscs]] also have a similar circulatory system. 
 
 Insects and their relatives use a molecule called [[haemocyanin]], which does the same job as [[haemoglobin]] does in [[vertebrate]]s. Haemocyanin has a greenish colour, not red. The insect circulatory system has no [[vein]]s or [[artery|arterie]]s. Their haemolymph moves around in the space called the '''haemocoel'''. The organs sit in the haemocoel and are bathed in the haemolymph. The 'heart' is little more than a single tube which pulses (squeezes). < ref name= " Gullan and Cranston " > Gullan, P.J.  &  Cranston P.S. 2005.
