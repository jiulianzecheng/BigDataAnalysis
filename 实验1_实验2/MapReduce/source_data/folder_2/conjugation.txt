 '''Conjugations''' are forms of [[verb]]s that are changed to agree with the [[Subject_(grammar)|subject]] that is doing the action described by the verb. Usually most of the word stays the same, but the endings change. Most conjugation systems follow some sort of pattern within the language. 
 
 Example: [[French language|French]] verb for 'to eat'-  " manger "  (stem: mang) 
 ( " manger "  is the [[infinitive]] of the verb. The infinitive is the un-conjugated form of the verb, [[literal]]ly the  " to do "  something form such as ''to'' walk, ''to'' play, ''to'' eat. In [[English language|English]] one does not say  " I like eat "  one must say  " I like ''to'' eat " . In both English and French ( " J'aime ''manger'' " ) the [[infinitive]] form of the verb would be used in this case.

 |He/She eats||il/elle mange  (mang + e)

 |You(formal) eat||vous mangez  (mang + ez) 
 |- 
 |We eat||nous mangeons  (mang + eons)

 |They eat||ils/elles mangent  (mang + ent)

 The [[pattern]] here is that the  " er "  is removed from the verb and replaced with a different ending depending on the subject(who's doing the eating). This pattern is good for many French conjugations, but not all, and in other [[language]]s, conjugation patterns are going to be very different.
