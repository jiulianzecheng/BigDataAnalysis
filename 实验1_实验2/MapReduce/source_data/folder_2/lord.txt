A '''Lord''' ('''Laird''' in some Scottish contexts) is a person who has [[Influence|power]] and [[authority]]. Women will usually (but not universally) take the title 'Lady' instead of Laird or Lord, but there is an example of a female Lord: ''Lord of Mann'', the [[ruler]] of the [[Isle of Man]]. The territory belonging to a lord is often called a lordship. Lords as a group are a [[peerage]].  
 
 The word actually comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] forms for  " [[wikt:loaf|loaf]] "  (bread) and  " [[ward]] "  (used to mean  " protector " , although today it means  " one who is protected " ). So a ''lord'' or  " loaf ward "  was originally  " the one who protected the loaf " . A '''mesne lord''' was a lord in the [[feudal]] system who had [[vassal]]s who held land from him, but who was himself the vassal of a higher lord. < ref name=Reynolds359-360 > Susan Reynolds, ''Fiefs and Vassals'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), pp. 359â€“360 < /ref >  The one who ruled over mesne lords was sometimes called an '''overlord'''. < ref name=Reynolds359-360/ >  This higher lord was sometimes the king. < ref name=Reynolds359-360/ > 
 
 In a religious context, '''The Lord''' means [[God]], mainly by [[Christianity]].
