The '''Mesolithic'''  < ref > from the [[Greek language|Greek]]  " ''mesos'', "   " middle, "  and  " ''lithos'', "   " stone " . However, it is not right to use the term 'Middle Stone Age' here because that is used for a much earlier stage in [[Africa]]n [[archaeology]]. < /ref >  was a period in the development of [[human]] [[technology]] between the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods of the [[Stone Age]]. 
 
 In the Palaeolithic, people were pure [[hunter-gatherer]]s. In the Neolithic they were [[farmer]]s in settlements with [[domesticate]]d animals and [[wheat]], with over 100 kinds of tools and with [[pottery]]. The Mesolithic was a [[wikt:transition|transition]]al period between the two. It happened at different times in different places. Mesolithic tools are small tools produced by chipping, and are hunter-gatherer tools, often arrowheads and points. Neolithic tools are often [[wikt:polish|polished]] and far more varied. They are tools of more settled societies with some [[agriculture]]. 
 
 The term 'Mesolithic' was introduced by Hodder Westrop in 1877, though the idea had been used earlier. < ref name=Trigger > Trigger, Bruce G. 1989. ''A history of archaeological thought''. Cambridge University Press. p148 < /ref >  It was not much used until [[Vere Gordon Childe|V. Gordon Childe]] popularized it in his book ''The dawn of Europe'' (1947). There is another term, 'Epipalaeolithic', which is sometimes used instead. 
 
 == Distinctive features == 
 The type of tool is the [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] factor. The Mesolithic featured devices made with small chipped stone tools. The Neolithic mainly abandoned this mode in favor of polished, not chipped, stone tools. 
 
 The Mesolithic culture can be set apart from that of the Palaeolithic in these ways: 
 #the [[tool]] kit is more varied than Palaeolithic tools. 
 #the emphasis is on small, even tiny, tools rather than the larger tools used previously. These small tools are called '''microliths'''. The Mesolithic also saw greater use of wooden handles for tools. 
 #they used the [[adze]], a [[carpentry]] tool with a wooden handle at [[right angle]] to the blade.  
 #the [[domestication]] of animals has begun. < ref name= " DienekesAnthropology " > [http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2008/10/dog-domestication-in-aurignacian-c.html Dienekes' Anthropology Blog : Dog domestication in the Aurignacian (c. 32kyBP]) < /ref > < ref name= " Worldfirst " > [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370/ MSNBC : World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big] < /ref > < ref name= " Scott " > Scott, John Paul  &  Fuller, John L. 1974.

 == The Fertile Crescent == 
 The [[Fertile Crescent]] was the first part of the world to move out of the Palaeolithic. 
 
 In some areas, such as the [[Near East]], agriculture was already underway by the end of the [[Pleistocene]], and there the Mesolithic is short. In areas with limited influence of [[ice age]], the term  " [[Epipaleolithic]] "  is sometimes preferred. 
 
 Regions that experienced greater [[environment]]al effects as the last ice age ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era. This lasted millennia. In Northern [[Europe]], societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the [[marshland]]s. Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours which are [[wikt:preserve|preserved]] in characteristic finds. These conditions also [[:wikt:delay|delayed]] the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BC (6,000 before present) in northern Europe. 
 
 == Mesolithic people in Europe == 
 [[Sequence analysis|Genetic research]] has been done on the [[skeleton]] of a 7,000-year-old man from north-west [[Spain]]. It shows he had blue eyes and a dark skin. < ref > Morelle, RebeccA 2014. Hunter-gatherer European had blue eyes and dark skin. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Technology. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25885519] < /ref >  The analysis showed that he had ancestral [[alleles]] in several skin pigmentation [[genes]]. This means he had dark hair and brown skin. 
 
 Researchers were surprised because they thought that European populations [[evolved]] light skin quite quickly. In lower latitudes dark skin protects from [[UV]] rays in sunlight. In northern latitudes this is not such a problem, but the supply of vitamin D is a problem. Vitamin D is synthesised by the action of sunlight on skin. Therefore, it is an advantage in much of Europe to have a light skin. 
 
 Earlier research was done on data using 2,196 samples from 185 diverse populations. It showed that at least three ancestral groups contributed to present-day Europeans. < ref > Lazaridis I. ''et al'' 2013. Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans. ''bioRXiv'' [http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2013/12/23/001552] < /ref >
