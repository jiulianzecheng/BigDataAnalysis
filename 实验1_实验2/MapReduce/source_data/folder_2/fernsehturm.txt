 The '''Berliner Fernsehturm''' or '''Fernsehturm Berlin''' (English: '''Berlin Television Tower''') is the tallest [[television tower]] in central [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is {{Convert|368|m}} tall. The tower is the fourth highest [[television]] tower in [[Europe]]. It is located in a [[park]] in Berlin's [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] [[Boroughs of Berlin|district]] (''Bezirk''). When it was built in 1969,  it was the second tallest television tower in the world. In 2021, it is one of the 10 most popular attractions in Germany. Over one million people visit the tower each year. The [[international]]-style television tower was built in 1965-1969 by [[Deutsche Post]] in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany). It was built in the park next to the demolished [[Marienviertel]]. On October 3, 1969, the opening took place. The building is over 220 meters higher than the old Berlin [[radio]] tower from the 1920s in the western part of the city. As a [[Landmarks|landmark]] visible from far away, it shapes the skyline of the city. In opening scenes of [[Movie|movies]] related to Berlin,  buildings such as the [[Brandenburg Gate]], the [[Siegess√§ule|Victory Column]] and the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building are often symbolized by the television tower.
