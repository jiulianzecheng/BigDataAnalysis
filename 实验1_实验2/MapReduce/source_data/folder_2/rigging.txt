 The '''rigging''' of a [[sailing ship]] is made up of the [[rope]]s and/or [[chain]]s used to support the ship's [[mast]]s, [[yard (sailing)|yard]]s and [[sail]]s. < ref name=riggingOD > {{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rigging |title=rigging |website=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=January 4, 2017 |archive-date=January 3, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103165130/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rigging |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The '''standing rigging''' is used to support the masts. < ref name=riggingOD/ >  The '''running rigging''' supports the yards and sails. < ref name=riggingOD/ >  Some types of [[sailboats]] that have un[[wikt:supported|supported]] masts do not have any rigging. < ref name=SC > {{cite web |url=http://www.sailboat-cruising.com/sailboat-rigging.html |title=Sailboat Rigging: Part 1 - Standing Rigging |publisher=Sailboat-Cruising.com |access-date=January 4, 2017}} < /ref >  These include the [[junk rig]] and [[catboat]] rigs. < ref name=SC/ >  [[Bermuda sloop]]s with a single mast and one [[headsail]] use fairly simple rigging. < ref name=SC/ >  [[Ketch|Cutter-rigged ketch]]es and [[schooner]]s have the most complex rigging. < ref name=SC/ > 
 
 == Standing rigging == 
 A sailing ship's standing rigging is made up of the ropes used to support the masts, yards and [[boom (sailing)|boom]]s. < ref name=sriggingHNSA > {{cite web |url=http://www.hnsa.org/resources/manuals-documents/age-of-sail/textbook-of-seamanship/standing-rigging/ |title=Standing Rigging |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |access-date=January 4, 2017 |archive-date=April 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426032515/http://www.hnsa.org/resources/manuals-documents/age-of-sail/textbook-of-seamanship/standing-rigging/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Most modern sailing vessels use [[wire rope]] for the standing rigging. < ref name=sriggingHNSA/ >  Modern standing rigging is regularly checked for [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] using a special [[gauge]]. Adjusting the tension is done by use of a [[turnbuckle]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thecoastalpassage.com/petrearigging.html |title=Rigging Made Simple |author=Petrea Heathwood |publisher=The Coastal Passage |access-date=January 4, 2017}} < /ref >  Ropes, wires or rods that run fore-and-aft along the centerline which [[Stability|stabilize]] the masts or [[spar (sailing)|spar]]s are called '''stays'''. < ref name=Hamersly774 > Lewis Randolph Hamersly, ''A Naval Encyclopædia'' (Philadelphia: L.R. Hamersly  &  Co., 1884), p. 774 < /ref >  Those that from the mast to the [[bow (ship)|bow]] are called '''forestays'''. < ref name=Hamersly774/ >  Those that run from the mast to the [[stern]] are called '''backstays'''. < ref name=Hamersly774/ > 
 
 == Running rigging == 
 The running rigging of a sailing vessel controls the sails. < ref name=SC2 > {{cite web |url=http://www.sailboat-cruising.com/running-rigging.html |title=Sailboat Rigging: Part 2 - Running Rigging |publisher=Sailboat-Cruising.com |access-date=January 4, 2017}} < /ref >  The running rigging is usually made up of various kinds of rope (ropes are also called lines). It uses [[block (sailing)|block]]s and [[Sheave (mechanical)|Sheave]]s to adjust the length of the ropes. < ref name=SC2/ >  A block is a kind of [[pulley]]. < ref name=SC2/ >  A sheave is the [[groove  (engineering)|groove]]d wheel inside the block. < ref name=SC2/ >  Larger sailing boats and ships use [[winch]]es. The adjustability of the running rigging allows the boat to perform various maneuvers such as [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] and [[Jibe|jibing]]. Common to all sailboats are the [[outhaul]] and the [[downhaul]]. < ref name=cat22 > {{cite web |url=http://www.catalina22experiment.com/home/sailing-basics-for-the-beginner |title=101 Basics for Sailors |publisher=Catalina 22 Experiment |access-date=January 4, 2017 |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031133041/http://www.catalina22experiment.com/home/sailing-basics-for-the-beginner |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The outhaul pulls the sail to the free end of the boom. < ref name=cat22/ >  The downhaul keeps the boom from rising on the mast. < ref name=cat22/ >
