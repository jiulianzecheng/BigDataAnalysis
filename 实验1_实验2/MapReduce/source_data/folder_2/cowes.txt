 '''Cowes''' is an English [[seaport]] town on the [[Isle of Wight]], an island south of [[Southampton]]. Cowes is on the west bank of the [[estuary]] of the [[River Medina]] facing the smaller town of '''[[East Cowes]]''' on the east Bank.  The western town is sometimes referred to as '''[[West Cowes]]''' where distinction is needed - such as at the two differing [[ferry]] landings.
