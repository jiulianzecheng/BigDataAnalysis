 '''Acanthopterygii''' (meaning  " spiny-finned one "  ) is a superorder of fish in the class [[Actinopterygii]]. Members of this superorder are sometimes called '''[[ray-finned fishes]]''' by other people for the characteristic sharp, bony rays in their fins. That refers to the [[Actinopterygii]].
