[[File:Lepton isodoublets.png|thumbnail|5000000px|right|The six basic leptons: [[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, [[tauon]]s, [[electron neutrino]]s, [[mu neutrino]]s, and [[tau neutrino]]s, respectively]]'''Leptons''' are [[elementary particle]]s with [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1/2 (a [[fermion]]) that are not affected by [[strong nuclear force]].  They are a family of particles that are different from the other known family of [[fermion]]s, the [[quark]]s. 
 
 [[Electron]]s are a well-known example that are found in ordinary [[matter]]. There are six leptons: the electron, muon, and tau particles and their associated neutrinos. The different varieties of the elementary particles are commonly called  " flavors " , and the [[neutrino]]s here are considered to have distinctly different flavor. Of the six leptons, three have [[electric charge]] and three do not. The best known charged lepton is the electron (e). The other two charged leptons are the muon (µ) and the [[tau lepton|tau]] (τ), which are like electrons but much bigger. The charged leptons are all negative particles, their ''[[antiparticles]]'' are positively charged (for example, the antiparticle of the electron, e < sup > - < /sup > , is a positron, e < sup > + < /sup > ).

 The [[Supersymmetry|superparticle]] of a lepton is called a  " slepton. "
