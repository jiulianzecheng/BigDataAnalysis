 '''Nyarlathotep''' is the [[Deity|god]] of [[nightmare]]s and [[chaos]] in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], a [[fictional universe]]. It has many forms. 
 
 It is one of the oldest beings within the Mythos, along with Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath. 
 
 Unlike most other Mythos beings, Nyarlathotep enjoys interacting with humans (and other helpless critters) and then driving them mad. It is also credited with giving humans the [[atomic bomb]], with hopes that humanity kills itself off.
