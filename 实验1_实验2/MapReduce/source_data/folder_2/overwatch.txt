 Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise. Its origins came after a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Titan, was cancelled. The developers of the game based it off other first-person shooters, such as Team Fortress 2. Some elements of Overwatch borrow concepts from the canceled Titan project. 
 
 A sequel, Overwatch 2, was announced in 2019, and released on October 4, 2022.
