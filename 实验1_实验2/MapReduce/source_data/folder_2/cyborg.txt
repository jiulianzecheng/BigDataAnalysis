A '''cyborg''' (short for  " [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[organism]] " ) is a theoretical or fictional being with both organic and [[manufacturing|manufactured]] parts.  
 
 The term was coined in 1960. < ref > " Cyborgs and Space [http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf], "  in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline. < /ref >   D.S. Halacy's ''Cyborg: evolution of the superman'' in 1965 spoke of a  " new frontier "  that was  " not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' â€“ a bridge...between mind and matter " . < ref > D.S. Halacy 1965. ''Cyborg: evolution of the superman''. New York: Harper and Row, 7. < /ref > 
 
 The term cyborg is not the same thing as [[bionic]]. It is often applied to an organism that has restored or enhanced abilities, done by some artificial part, by or technology that relies on some sort of [[feedback]]. < ref > [http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/techuman.html Technology as extension of human functional architecture] by Alexander Chislenko. < /ref > < ref > {{cite book | title=The techno-human shell-a jump in the evolutionary gap | url=https://archive.org/details/technohumanshell0000carv | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1620061657}} < /ref >   
 
 While cyborgs are commonly thought of as [[mammal]]s, they might also conceivably be any kind of [[organism]] and the term  " cybernetic organism "  has been applied loosely to all sorts of things. The term can also apply to micro-organisms which are modified to perform at higher levels than their unmodified counterparts. It is thought that cyborg technology may form a part of humanity's future.
