'''Reggaeton''' is a form of [[urban contemporary|urban music]] that first became popular with [[Latin American]] youths in the early 1990s. Reggaeton's predecessor originated in [[Panama]] as Reggae en Espa√±ol. After the music's gradual exposure in [[Puerto Rico]], it eventually evolved into reggaeton. It blends British West reggae and dancehall with Latin American genres, as well as [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Modern reggaeton beats follow the structure of the Dem Bow Riddim, a beat created by Jamaican producers Steely  &  Clevie in the late 80s and early 90s. However, over the years, it has been losing every noticeable similarity with its original reggae origins.
