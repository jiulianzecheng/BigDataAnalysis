 '''Parazit''' ({{lang-fa|پارازیت}}, ''{{transl|fa|pārāzit}}'', meaning  " static " ) was a weekly half-hour [[Persian language]] [[Satire|satirical]] television show on [[Voice of America]]'s Persian service. < ref > [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/08/parazits-sharp-cuts.html  " Meet the Duo behind Iran's 'Daily Show' " ], ''PBS Frontline Tehran Bureau'', August 13, 2010, accessed January 21, 2011. < /ref >  The show is a satire about [[Iran]]ian politics. [[Kambiz Hosseini]] and [[Saman Arbabi]] started the show as a 10-minute show. It was influenced by the American satirical news show ''[[The Daily Show]]''. < ref > {{cite news| title=Expats' 'Daily Show'-style VOA program enthralls Iranians, irks their government |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/31/AR2010123101327.html?sid=ST2011012103765 |first=Tara |last=Bahrampour |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= December 31, 2010}} < /ref >  Parazit was started before the June 2009 [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|presidential elections in Iran]]. It became very popular in Iran. Many people watched it via illegal satellite dishes and internet. < ref name=bahr > {{cite news|last=Bahrampour|first=Tara|title=Iranian Daily Show, Meet 'The Daily Show' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/21/AR2011012103880.html?sid=ST2011012103765 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=21 January 2011}} < /ref >  Its name comes from the Iranian government's repeated tries to jam foreign satellite programming. Because it is shown through unofficial channels, it is impossible to say how many people have seen it. However since January 2011, the show's [[YouTube]] channel is watched 45,000 times a week and its [[Facebook]] page is visited 17 million times a month. < ref name=bahr/ >
