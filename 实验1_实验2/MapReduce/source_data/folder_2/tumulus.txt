 A '''tumulus''' (one tumulus, several ''tumuli'') is a certain type of [[grave]]. The word comes from [[Latin language|Latin]]. This way of burying people was common in the [[Stone age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]]. There are different layouts. Sometimes [[sarcophagus]]es were used, at other times, [[urn]]s were placed in the grave. There are layouts with one or with multiple chambers. Sometimes the location is privileged, and [[stone circle]]s can be found nearby.
