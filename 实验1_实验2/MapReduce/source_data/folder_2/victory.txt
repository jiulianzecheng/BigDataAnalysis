 '''Victory''' is [[wikt:win|win]]ning an [[argument]], [[war]] or [[test]]. Many [[song]]s have been made called ''victory songs''. Victory often comes with a lot of [[emotion]]. Victory is usually celebrated after winning, although there are many times not to, like after a war. The term comes from the [[culture of ancient Rome]], when it meant winning a war. 
 
 ==Different types== 
 In terms of human emotion, being victorious usually brings strong feelings of gladness, and in human behaviour often has movements and victory poses. 
 Victory dances and victory cries are quite similar to war dances and war cries that are done before the violence.
