 An '''oppidum''' (plural: ''oppida'') is a large fortified [[Iron Age]] [[settlement]].  
 
 In the 2nd and 1st centuries [[BC]], they were in all parts of Europe. They continued until the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered Southern and Western Europe. In [[Germania]], north of the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Rhine River|Rhine]], oppida were used into the 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]]. 
 
 [[Julius Caesar]] called the larger [[Celt]]ic [[Iron Age]] settlements he found in [[Gaul]] ''oppida''. The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oppidum |title=Oppidum |first= |last= |work=Oxford Dictionaries Online |year=2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |archive-date=19 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119173716/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oppidum |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Many oppida grew from [[hill fort]]s, but not all of them had an important defensive role. The main features of the oppida are: 
 * the planned building of the walls and gates 
 * the spacious layout 
 * a view of the surrounding area. 
 
 The development of oppida was an important step in the [[urbanisation]] of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] that could be described as [[town]]s. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of [[hierarchy]]. 
 
 In conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the Empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain. 
 
 One of the best preserved oppida is at [[Enserune]] in [[France]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.midi-france.info/1001b_enserune.htm |title=Prehistory: The oppidum at Enserune |first= |last= |work=The History of the Languedoc |year=2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011}} < /ref >  It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the [[1st century]]. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by [[Vienna]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.livius.org/vi-vr/vindobona/vindobona.html |title=Vindobona (Vienna) |first= |last= |work=livius.org |year=2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |archive-date=3 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403073608/http://www.livius.org/vi-vr/vindobona/vindobona.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
