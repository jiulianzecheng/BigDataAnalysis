'''Cryptanalysis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kryptós'',  " hidden " , and ''analýein'',  " to loosen "  or  " to untie " ) is the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of [[Encryption|encrypt]]ed information, without access to the [[secret]] information which is normally required to do so. Typically, this involves finding a [[secret key]]. In non-technical language, this is the practice of '''codebreaking''' or '''cracking the code''', although  " break "  can also mean just a part of a complete solution. 
 
 People have been making and breaking codes for many centuries. In the 1930s specialized machines were invented to do the calculations. Code-breaking machines such as the [[Colossus computer]] were important during [[World War II]]. Computers were the main tool of cryptanalysis in the [[Cold War]] and later.
