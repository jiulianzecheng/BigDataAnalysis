 '''''Wollemia''''' is a genus of [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. It is a  " [[living fossil]] " , recently found in 1994. Its fossil record dates back 200 million years, and it was thought to be long extinct. 
 
 ''Wollemia nobilis'' was discovered in 1994 in a temperate [[rainforest]] wilderness area of the [[Wollemi National Park]] in [[New South Wales]]. in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone [[gorge]]s near [[Lithgow]],  150 kilometres north-west of [[Sydney]]. 
 
 In both botanical and popular literature the tree has been called the '''Wollemi Pine'''. It is not a true pine (genus ''[[Pinus]]'') nor a member of the pine family ([[Pinaceae]]), but is related to ''[[Agathis]]'' and ''[[Araucaria]]'' in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. < ref > [http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s1471653.htm Fact Sheet: Wollemi Pine] < /ref > 
 
 The Wollemi pine is classified as [[Critically Endangered]] (CR – D) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] 2002. < ref > IUCN Red List (April, 2003) 
 http://www.redlist.org < /ref >  It is legally protected in Australia. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term.
