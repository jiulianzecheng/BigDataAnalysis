'''Combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]]. It is concerned with finite or [[Countable set|countable]] infinite [[set]]s. Combinatorics is part of [[discrete mathematics]]. Combinatorics are about [[graph theory]], or [[Partition of a set|Partitions]] of sets. According to [[George PÃ³lya]], combinatorics looks at counting the number of possibilities, and about the questions whether certain configurations exist, and how to get to them. 
 
 == Permutation == 
 
 Permutation is concerned with the following problems: 
 * Determining how many different ways there are to arrange a number of objects. 
 * Determining how many ways there are to select a number of objects from a larger set. 
 
 There are variations in the problems as follows: 
 * The objects may or may not be distinguishable. 
 * The order in which the objects are selected may or may not matter. 
 
 === Examples === 
 [[File:Permutations RGB.svg|thumb|right|All the possibilities to arrange three differently colored balls]] 
 * There are 6 different ways to arrange three distinguishable objects (as shown in the graphic). 
 * There are three different ways to select one particular orange from a basket with three oranges. 
 * There is only one possible way to select the apple from a basket that has one orange, one apple and one pear in it.
