 The '''nuthatches''' are a part of '''''Sitta''''', a [[genus]] of small [[passerine]] [[bird]]s in the family '''Sittidae'''. They live in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. < ref > Harrap, Simon  &  Quinn, David 1996. ''Tits, nuthatches and treecreepers''. Christopher Helm. ISBN 978-0-7136-3964-3 < /ref > 
 
 They have large heads, short tails, and powerful [[beak|bill]]s and feet. Nuthatches advertise their [[Territory (animal)|territory]] with loud, simple songs. Most species have grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.

 They live in forests, often [[pine]] [[coniferous]] forests, on higher land (montane forests). As usual in such places, [[insects]], [[nuts]] and [[seeds]] are their food. Unlike other birds, nuthatches can run down trees head-first, and hang upside down. They can run down trees as fast as they climb up them. < ref name= " Firefly " > {{cite book | last = Matthysen | first = Erik | author2 = Löhrl, Hans | chapter = Nuthatches | editor = Perrins, Christopher | title = Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2003 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/536 536–537] | isbn = 978-1-55297-777-4 | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse | url = https://archive.org/details/fireflyencyclope0000unse/page/536 }} < /ref > 
 
 Nuthatches use holes in trees for [[nest]]s. This also means they compete with [[squirrels]] and [[woodpeckers]] for these holes. In fact both [[Squirrel|squirrels]] and the [[great spotted woodpecker]] kill nuthatches if they can. [[Owls]] and [[hawks]] also kill these small birds, but that is not to do with their nest-holes. In defense of their nests, nuthatches make the entrances smaller by packing the edges with mud or tree [[resin]]. [[Predation]] is not really a threat, just a fact of life for them. [[Deforestation|Loss of coniferous forest]] in some countries is a threat. They cannot live in anything else except in trees. 
 
 All nuthatches store food, especially seeds. They hide seeds in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes.  These stores are remembered for as long as 30 days. < ref > {{cite journal| last= Hardling | first= Roger |author2=Kallander, Hans|author3=Nilsson, Jan-Åke | year=1997 | title= Memory for hoarded food: an aviary study of the European Nuthatch | journal=The Condor | volume=99 | issue= 2| pages= 526–529 | url = http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v099n02/p0526-p0529.pdf | doi= 10.2307/1369961| jstor= 1369961}} < /ref > 
 
 Most nuthatches do not [[migrate]]. They stay in the forest through the winter, where they roost in large flocks. These flocks can have over 100 nuthatches. Sometimes they include other forest birds, such as [[tit (bird)|tits]] and [[woodpecker]]s. < ref name= " Firefly " / >
