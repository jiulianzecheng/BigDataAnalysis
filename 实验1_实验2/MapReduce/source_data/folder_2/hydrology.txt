 The central theme of hydrology is how the water circulates. This is called the [[water cycle]]. The most vivid illustration of it is the water [[evaporation]] from the [[ocean]] with the formation of [[cloud]]s. These clouds drift over the [[land]] and produce [[rain]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.issaquah.org/comorg/gwac/hydro.htm |title=Basic Ground Water Hydrology |access-date=2011-03-11 |archive-date=2010-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213022253/http://issaquah.org/comorg/gwac/Hydro.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
