 The '''Aidi''' or '''Chien de l'Atlas''' is a Moroccan [[dog]] [[breed]] used to protect flocks of [[sheep]] and goats. It also can hunt and smell very well.. In its native [[Morocco]] it is often paired in hunting with the [[Sloughi]], which chases down [[prey]] that the Aidi has found by sniffing it out.
