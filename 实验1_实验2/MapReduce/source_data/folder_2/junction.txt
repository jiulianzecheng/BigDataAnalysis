 A '''railway junction''' is a place where two [[railway tracks]] join.  The shape of a junction looks like

 Sometimes the trains just cross and keep going straight ahead to their destination.  Sometimes they turn onto the other track to reach the planned destination.  Moveable portions of track make this possible.
