 '''Lactation''' describes the secretion of [[milk]] from the [[mammary gland|breasts]] when a [[mother]] feeds her young. It occurs with almost all female [[mammals]] after the birth of their young. In humans the process is also called ''[[breastfeeding]]'' or ''nursing''. 
 
 In most species, milk comes out of the mother's [[nipples]]. The [[platypus]] (which is a [[monotreme]] mammal) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen. In only one [[species]] of mammal, the [[Dayak fruit bat]], is milk production a normal male function. 
 
 Milk contains fat, lactose, and protein, as well and vitamins and minerals. 
 
 Apart from food nutrients, mothers' milk contains a range of [[antibodies]] which protect the baby until it develops its own [[immune system]]. When born, a baby has IgG antibodies from across the mother's [[placenta]]. Its own [[immunoglobulin]] production takes about six months to develop after birth, so meantime the mother's milk supplies IgA as a stop-gap protection. < ref > Janeway C.A. ''et al'' 2001.

 [[Milk]] production requires the [[hormones]] [[prolactin]] and [[oxytocin]]. 
 
 The evolution of milk production made use of a feature which was present before modern mammals. < ref > Capuco A.V.  &  Akers R.M 2009. The origin and evolution of lactation. ''J. Biol''.

The bovine lactation genome: insights into the evolution of mammalian milk. ''Genome Biol''. '''10''':r43. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2688934/] < /ref >  The cells which produce milk were developed from the [[apocrine]] glands in the skin:  
 : " The [[synapsid]] branch of the [[amniote]] tree that separated from other [[taxa]] in the [[Pennsylvanian]] ( > 310 million years ago) evolved a glandular rather than scaled [[Integumentary system|integument]] " . < ref name=Oft/ >   
 Meaning: since the skin of synapsids had glands in it, the development of milk production was possible.
