 An '''average''' is the  " normal "  number of a group of numbers made by mixing the group of numbers. 
 
 In [[math]], an average is called a '''[[mean]]'''. It can be found by [[add]]ing the numbers, then [[Division (mathematics)|dividing]] the answer by the number of numbers there were. There are other kinds of mean, and other things that are sometimes thought of as  " average "  such as [[median]] or [[mode (statistics)]].
