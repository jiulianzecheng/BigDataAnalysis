 ''Punica'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] name for the pomegranate, ''malum punicum'', meaning  " [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] [[apple]] "  ( " apple from [[Carthage]] " ). < ref name= " Purdue " > {{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/pomegranate.html |last=Morton |first=Julia F.|work=Fruits of Warm Climates|pages=352–355|publisher=Purdue New Crops Profile|title=Pomegranate, ''Punica granatum'' L. |date=1987 |access-date=8 January 2017}} < /ref >

 * ''[[Pomegranate|Punica granatum]]'' L., pomegranate. The pomegranate originated in the region of modern-day [[Iran]], and has been cultivated since ancient times throughout the [[Mediterranean]] region and northern [[India]]. < ref name= " Purdue "  / > 
 * ''[[Punica protopunica]]'' [[Balf.f.]], [[Socotra]] pomegranate. It is  [[Endemism|endemic]] to the island of [[Socotra]]. It differs from the common pomegranate because it has pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit. 
 
 Although previously placed in its own family '''Punicaceae''', recent [[Phylogeny|phylogenetic]] studies have shown that ''Punica'' belongs in the family [[Lythraceae]], and it is classified in that family by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]].
