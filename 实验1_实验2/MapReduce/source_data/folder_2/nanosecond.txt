A '''nanosecond''' ('''ns''') is one billionth of a [[second]]. It is equal to 10 < sup > âˆ’9 < /sup >  seconds. 
 
 One nanosecond contains 1000 [[picosecond]]s. 1000 nanoseconds is equal to one [[microsecond]]. Ten nanoseconds are sometimes called a shake. 
 
 Some things that take between one nanosecond and ten nanoseconds are listed below 
 * [[Speed of light|Light]] travels about 29.9 & nbsp;[[centimeter]]s in 1 nanosecond. That is 3.33564095 nanoseconds to move 1 [[meter]]. 
 * It takes a [[fusion reaction]] between 20 and 40 nanoseconds to finish in a [[hydrogen bomb]]. 
 * It takes a [[nuclear reaction]] 10 nanoseconds to finish one generation with fast [[neutrons]]. 
 * The [[Half-life (element)|half-life]] of a [[Kaon|K meson]] is 12 nanoseconds.
