'''Slug''' is a general term for a [[gastropod]] [[Mollusca|mollusc]] which has no shell, or just a small internal shell.  
 
 Slugs belong to several different [[family (biology)|families]] which also include snails with shells. [[Snail]]s are gastropods with a coiled shell large enough for the animal to pull back inside. The families of land slugs are not very closely related, despite looking similar. The shell-less slug type is an example of [[convergent evolution]], and so the category  " slug "  is  not a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] category. 
 
 The name  " slug "  is used for air-breathing land slugs, while the [[Marine biology|marine]] forms are usually known as [[sea slug]]s. Land gastropods with a shell that is too small to hide the body are sometimes called ''semislugs''. 
 
 == Body parts and behaviour == 
 [[Image:Slug parts.png|thumb|240px|left|Body parts of a slug|alt=Drawing of slug with labels for the foot (bottom side), the foot fringe that surrounds it, the mantle behind the head, the pneumostome for breathing, and the optical and sensory tentacles]] 
 
 Like land snails, most slugs have four 'feelers' or ''tentacles'' on their head. The upper two (the  " optical tentacles " ) see [[light]] and have eyespots at the ends, while the lower two (the  " sensory tentacles " ) are used for [[olfaction|smelling]]. The tentacles are retractable, and can regrow if lost.  
 
 On top of the slug, behind the head, is a body part called the ''[[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]],'' and under this are the [[genital]] opening and [[anus]]. On one side (almost always the right side) of the mantle is a breathing hole, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. Inside the mantle in some species is a very small, flat shell. 
 
 The bottom of a snail is called a  " foot " . Like other snails, a slug moves by [[rhythm]]ic waves of [[Muscle#Muscle contraction|muscle contraction]] on the bottom of its foot. At the same time, it [[Secretion|secretes]] a layer of [[mucus]] on which it travels, which helps prevent damage to the foot. Around the edge of the foot is the 'foot fringe'.  
 
 Some slug species [[Hibernation|hibernate]] underground during the winter in places with cold winters, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn.
