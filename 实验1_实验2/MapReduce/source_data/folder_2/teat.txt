'''Teats''' are what [[Mammal|mammals]] use to feed their babies. They let milk be taken by the young. Milk is [[Digestion|digested]] by the babies with a special [[hormone]].  
 
 The number and position of the teats varies with the [[species]]. Humans are different to most mammals in that they may continue to drink milk throughout life. Normal mammals stop digesting milk at a certain stage. This forces the young to change to an adult diet. 
 
 The word  " teat "  is from the Old French or Dutch word, ''tete'' or the Greek word ''τιτθύς''. < ref > Schrevelius' Greek Lexicon, Translated Into English, with many new words added, Retrieved 11 August 2018 < /ref >
