 '''Utah''' is a state in the west [[United States]]. The [[capital (city)|capital]] and largest [[city]] is [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]. Utah became a state in the U.S. on January 4, [[1896]]. About 3.3 million people lived there in 2020. 
 
 In 2018, The top countries of origin for Utah’s immigrants were [[Mexico]] (35 percent of immigrants), [[India]] (4 percent), [[Venezuela]] (4 percent), [[Peru]] (4 percent), and [[Canada]] (3 percent). < ref >  https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/immigrants_in_utah.pdf < /ref > 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Utah is bordered by [[Idaho]] and [[Wyoming]] in the north and [[Colorado]] in the east. It touches a single point of [[New Mexico]] to the southeast at [[Four Corners]]. Utah is bordered by [[Arizona]] in the south, and by [[Nevada]] in the west. It covers an area of 84,899 [[square mile]]s (219,887 [[square kilometre|km²]]). 
 [[File:Delicatearch1.jpg|180px|left|thumb|An arch in Arches National Park, Utah]] 
 Utah is mostly rocky with three distinct geological regions: the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], and the [[Colorado Plateau]]. Utah is known for its natural [[wikt:diversity|diversity]] and is home to [[wikt:features|features]] ranging from arid deserts with sand dunes to thriving pine forests in mountain valleys, which has attracted many [[tourists]]. 
 
 ===Climate=== 
 Utah has a dry, semi-arid to [[:wikt:arid|arid]] climate, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://easyscienceforkids.com/all-about-dry-climates/|title=Easy Science for Kids|website=Dry Climate|date=7 March 2014 |access-date=17 June 2016}} < /ref >  although its many [[mountains]] have large, wide, differences of climates, with the highest points in the [[Uinta Mountains]] being above the [[tree line]]. The dry weather results from the state lying mostly in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]]. The eastern half of the state is in the rain shadow of the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. The main [[wikt:source|source]] of rain for the state is the [[Pacific Ocean]], with the state normally lying in the path of large Pacific storms from mid-[[October]] through [[April]], although northern Utah often sees these large storms earlier and later. In summer, the state, normally southern and eastern Utah, is in the path of [[monsoon]] {{broken wikt link|moisture|moisture}} from the Gulf of California. Most of the lowland areas get less than 12 [[inches]] (300 & nbsp;mm) of rain a year. The [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] is the driest area of the state, with less than 5 & nbsp;inches (125 & nbsp;mm). Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys. Although St. George only gets about 3 & nbsp;inches (7.5 & nbsp;cm) per year, [[Salt Lake City]] sees about 60 & nbsp;inches (150 & nbsp;cm), [[wikt:enhanced|enhanced]] by the lake-effect snow from the Great Salt Lake, which [[wikt:increases|increases]] snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake. Some areas of the Wasatch Range in the path of the lake-effect get up to 700 & nbsp;inches (1,770 & nbsp;cm) per year. The {{broken wikt link|consistently|consistently}} dry, fluffy, snow led Utah's ski [[wikt:industry|industry]] to get the slogan  " the Greatest Snow on Earth "  in the 1980s. In the winter, temperature {{broken wikt link|inversions|inversions}} are a [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomenon]] across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick [[humidity]] and fog that can sometimes last for weeks at a time, normally in the [[Uintah Basin]]. 
 
 ==Population== 
 The center of population of Utah is in Salt Lake County in the city of  " Salt Lake City " . < ref > {{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 | publisher = United States Census Bureau | access-date = 2008-12-06 | url = https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}} < /ref >  As of 2020 the Census Bureau believes Utah has a population of 3,271,616. < ref > https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/UT < /ref >  In 2008, the [[United States|US]] Census Bureau [[wikt:determined|determined]] Utah to be the fastest growing state in the country in terms of population growth. < ref > https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/013049.html Utah is Fastest Growing State. Press Release by [[US Census Bureau]]. Dated 12/22/2008. Accessed 12/23/2008. < /ref > 
 
 Much of the population lives in [[City|cities]] and [[town]]s along the [[Wasatch Front]], a {{broken wikt link|metropolitan|metropolitan}} [[wikt:region|region]] that runs north-south with the [[Wasatch Mountains]] rising on the eastern side. Growth outside the Wasatch Front is also [[wikt:increasing|increasing]]. The [[St. George]] metropolitan area is right now the second-fastest growing in the country after the [[Las Vegas]] metropolitan area, while the [[Heber]] metropolitan area is also the second-fastest growing in the country (right in front of Palm Coast, Florida). 
 
 ==Economy== 
 [[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Bingham Canyon Mine]] southwest of [[Salt Lake City]].]] 
 The University of Utah says that the gross state product of Utah in 2005 was $92 billion, or 0.74% of the total United States GDP of $12.4 trillion for the same year. The per capital personal [[income]] was $24,977 in 2005. Major companies of Utah are: [[mining]], [[cattle ranching]], [[salt production]], and [[government services]]. 
 
 In eastern Utah [[petroleum]] making is a big [[wikt:industry|industry]]. Near Salt Lake City, petroleum [[wikt:refining|refining]] is done by a number of [[oil]] companies. In central Utah, [[coal]] mining accounts for much of the mining [[wikt:activity|activity]]. 
 
 ===Age and gender=== 
 Utah has a high total birth rate, and the youngest population of any [[U.S. state]]. It is also one of the few non-Southern states that has more males than females. 
 
 In 2000, the [[wikt:gender|gender]] percents of Utah were estimated as: 
 
 * 49.9 percent female 
 * 50.1 percent male 
 
 ===Religion=== 
 The majority of the state's people are members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. These people are called the Mormons or the LDS [[Christian church|Church]]. As of 2020, 60.7 percent of people in the state are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Utah sees Latter-day Saint slowdown and membership numbers drop in Salt Lake County|url=https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/01/05/utah-sees-latter-day/|access-date=2022-01-02|website=The Salt Lake Tribune}} < /ref >  Mormons are not as common as they used to be in Salt Lake City. Usually, people who live in rural areas in Utah are almost all Mormon.

In the past, many of Utah's lawmakers have been church members. This has [[wikt:contributed|contributed]] to the state's laws on [[alcohol]] (sales and content) and [[gambling]]. Another effect can be seen in Utah's high birth rate (25 percent higher than the [[wikt:national|national]] normal; the highest for a state in the U.S.). The Mormons in Utah normally have [[wikt:conservative|conservative]] views in politics. Most Utahns that vote are not in a political party (60%). But, most vote for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].{{Cn|date=January 2023}} [[John McCain]] got 62.5% of the vote in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]]. 70.9% of people of Utah voted for [[George W. Bush]] in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]].
