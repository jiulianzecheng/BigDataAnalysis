 '''Gabrovo''' ({{lang-bg|Габрово}}) is a [[city]] in central northern [[Bulgaria]]. It is the [[Local government|administrative]] centre of [[Gabrovo Province]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 People have lived in the area around Gabrovo since the [[Neolithic]]. It gained [[economic]] importance after [[Veliko Tarnovo]] became [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the 12th century. [[Artisan|Craftsmanship]] and [[trade]] grew because Gabrovo was close to both the capital and the [[Balkan]] passes. 
 
 In the 1870s [[Felix Kanitz]] said that Gabrovo is  " a big workshop "  and that it is a  " city that lives from the water, "  referring to widely used water power. The glory of the goods of Gabrovo became known throughout the Ottoman Empire, and beyond that, in [[Bucharest]]. There is still a street named  " Gabroveni "  in Bucharest.
