 '''Silicon''' is a [[chemical element]]. Its [[atomic number]] is 14 on the [[periodic table]]. Its [[Chemical symbol|symbol]] is '''Si'''. It is a hard, [[Brittleness|brittle]] [[Crystal|crystalline solid]]. It is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]] and [[semiconductor]]. It is a member of [[Group 14 element|group 14]] in the periodic table. 
 
 Silicon looks like a [[metal]], but cannot do everything that a metal can, like conduct [[electricity]] well. Silicon is used a lot in today's [[computer]]s and nearly every other electronic device as well. [[Germanium]] can also be used in computers, but silicon is much easier to find.  
 
 For example, all of the sand found at the beach is made of small cubes of  silicon dioxide also known as  [[silica]]. [[Glass]] is made by heating [[sand]] hot enough until it melts. < ref > {{cite web|title=Glass Crusher Machines|url=https://www.qcr.co.uk/balers-compactors/glass-recycling-equipment/|publisher=www.qcr.co.uk|accessdate=24 May 2016}} < /ref >  Glass made from silicon can be made in different colours by adding colouring compounds. Many rocks and minerals are composed of compounds of silicon and [[oxygen]] called [[silicate]]s. 
 
 == Silicon in computers == 
 Silicon is a [[semiconductor]], and much used in [[computers]]. A super-pure [[isotope]] of silicon, silicon-28, can now be made 40 times more pure than before. It is very important for the next big development in computers. This stores  " qubits "  in [[atoms]] of another [[element]], like [[phosphorous]], embedded in a tiny layer of ultra-pure silicon-28. These qubits can [[wikt:simultaneous|simultaneously]] encode a one and a zero, for incredibly fast and complex calculations. < ref > Webb, Jonathan 2014.
