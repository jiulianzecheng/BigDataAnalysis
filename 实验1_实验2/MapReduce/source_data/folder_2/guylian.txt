 '''Guylian''' ({{IPA-nl|'É¡ilijan}}) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[chocolate]] manufacturer founded by Guy Foubert in 1960. The company takes its name from the combination of Foubert's first name (Guy) with that of his wife, Liliane. Guylian is perhaps most famous for their chocolate Sea Shells [[praline]] with different fillings. Guylian has been the major sponsor of [[Project Seahorse]] since 1999. 
 
 In 2008 [[Lotte Confectionery]] from [[South Korea]] bought the company for $164 mln. < ref > {{cite web|title=UPDATE 1-S.Korea Lotte buys Belgium's Guylian for $164 mln|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/23/guylian-lotte-idUSSEO22252520080623|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=12 October 2011|date=Jun 22, 2008|archive-date=30 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234741/http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/23/guylian-lotte-idUSSEO22252520080623|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 ==Guylian chocolate egg breaks Guinness World Record== 
 In March 2005, Guylian made a [[Guinness World Record]].  They built the world's largest chocolate sculpture of an Easter egg.  This was on the market square in Sint-Niklaas (Belgium). 26 Guylian master chocolatiers worked continuously for eight days to make this giant chocolate egg. The sculpture measured 8.32 meters high and 6.39 meters wide.  It was made using 1,950 kilos of chocolate or about 50,000 chocolate Sea Shell Bars.
