 The '''hominids''' are members of the [[Family (biology)|biological family]] '''Hominidae''' (the '''great [[ape]]s'''). This family includes [[human]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[orangutan]]s. < ref > Groves C. 2005. Wilson D.E.; Reeder D.M. eds. ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 181{{ndash}}184. {{ISBN|0-801-88221-4}}. [http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?id=12100786] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204210226/http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?id=12100786 |date=2011-02-04}} < /ref >   " Great ape "  is a common name rather than a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] label, and people use it in different ways. Sometimes people mean to include humans in the category of “great apes,” and sometimes they mean non-human apes. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is definitely a hominid, as judged by all modern reference works. 
 
 Hominids range in weight from 48 & nbsp;kg to 270 & nbsp;kg. Males are larger than females. Hominids are [[Primate|primates]] with no [[Tail|tails]], strong bodies, and well-developed [[Forearm|forearms]]. Their [[Finger|thumbs]] (and big toes, except in humans) oppose the fingers, and form a grip. All digits have flattened [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]. 
 
 At present, the family Hominidae includes four [[Genus|genera]] and eight [[species]]. However, if [[fossil]] hominids were included, all of the [[Australopithecines]] and the genus ''[[Homo]]'' would be members of the Hominidae family. Today, nonhuman great apes live only in the [[Rainforest|rainforests]] of [[Equator|equatorial]] [[Africa]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]]. 
 
 The first hominid fossils are from the [[Miocene]] period. Archaeologists found these in [[Asia]] < ref > Hill, Andrew  &  Steven Ward 1988. Origin of the Hominidae: the record of African large hominoid evolution between 14 My and 4 My. ''Yearbook of Physical Anthropology'' '''31''' (59): 49–83.[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.1330310505/abstract;jsessionid=DEE106EB867A65B6755019EE86A1906E.d03t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+15+December+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EST%29+for+essential+maintenance] < /ref >  and [[Europe]]. Also in Asia, they found fossils of a huge version of the orangutan called ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'', which is now [[Extinction|extinct]]. Fossils also show that [[Neanderthals]] were in Europe and western Asia for at least half a million years before [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] appeared. 
 
 ==Classification== 
 Scholars do not agree on exactly [[Biological classification|how to classify]] the family Hominidae. 
 
 ===Past versions=== 
 In the past, the family Hominidae have been classified this way: 
 *Family '''Hominidae''': Great apes 
 ** Subfamily [[Ponginae]] 
 *** Genus ''[[Orangutan|Pongo]]'' {{ndash}} [[orangutan]]s 
 ** Subfamily [[Homininae]] 
 *** Genus ''[[Gorilla]]'' – [[gorilla]]s 
 *** Genus ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' – [[chimpanzee]]s 
 *** ''[[Australopithecus]]''† and other extinct relatives 
 *** Genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' – [[human]]s 
 
 ===Modern version=== 
 A more recent classification shows humans and the [[Australopithecine]]s as [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/distinct distinct] from the [[rainforest]] apes. Two major reference works have supported this approach. < ref > Larsen, Clark Spencer (ed) 2010. ''A companion to biological anthropology''. Blackwell. Chapter 3 (Bernard A.
