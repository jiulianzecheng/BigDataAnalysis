 A '''qanat''' is a series of [[well]]-like holes and tunnels dug to reach a natural [[Aquifer|underground source of water]], usually run-off from a mountain. They were (and are) used to provide water in the [[desert]] regions of the [[Middle East]]. The oldest qanats, found in the region once known as [[Persian Empire|Persia]] (now known as [[Iran]]), are believed to be a couple of thousand years old.
