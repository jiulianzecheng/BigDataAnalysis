 '''Paleobotany''' (Palaeobotany) is part of [[paleontology]] (palaeontology).  Paleophytology (Palaeophytology) is a [[synonym]]. 
 
 Paleobotanists study [[plant]] [[fossil]]s from the past. Paleobotany is also about trying to understand past [[environment]]s and the [[history]] of [[agriculture]]. Fossil [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s are important for studying the history of plants. [[Micropaleontology]] and [[palynology]] both include studying fossil plant pollen and spores. 
 
 Note: terms starting with '''Paleo'''- are spelt '''Palaeo-''' in the English version of the [[English language]].
