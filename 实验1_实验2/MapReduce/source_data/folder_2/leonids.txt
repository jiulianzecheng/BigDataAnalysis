The '''Leonids''' are a prolific [[meteor shower]] associated with the [[comet]] [[Tempelâ€“Tuttle]].  
 
 The Leonids get their name from the direction their shower seems to come from. This direction is called the [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]]. The [[meteor]]s appear to come from the [[constellation]] [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]].  
 
 The Leonids peak in the month of November.
