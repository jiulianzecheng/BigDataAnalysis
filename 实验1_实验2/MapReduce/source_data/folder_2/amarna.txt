 " Amarna "  is the Arabic name for the place. The name for the city used by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians is written as ''Akhetaten'' in [[English (language)|English]]. It translates to  " the Horizon of the [[Aten]] "  (''Akh-t-Aten''). < ref name= " davidp125 " > David, Rosalie 1998. ''Handbook to life in Ancient Egypt''. Facts on File, p. 125. < /ref > 
 
 == Amarna art == 
 The Amarna art-style broke with the old Egyptian conventions. It showed its people more realistically. It included informal scenes, such as affection within the royal family or playing with their children. It no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art had a realism that sometimes shocks. This art had a more lasting legacy than the religion.
