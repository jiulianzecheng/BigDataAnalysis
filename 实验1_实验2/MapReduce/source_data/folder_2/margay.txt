 The '''Margay''' (''Leopardus wiedii'') is a spotted [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/margay.html | title = Leopardus wiedii, common name: Margay | access-date=2007-04-15}} < /ref >  It is a [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] and [[nocturnal animal]] which prefers remote parts of the [[rainforest]]. 
 
 == Life-style == 
 The margay is mostly [[nocturnal]]. < ref name= " nocturnal " > [http://www.anywherecostarica.com/flora-fauna/mammal/margay Anywhere Costa Rica] < /ref >  It eats small mammals (sometimes including monkeys), birds, eggs, lizards and tree frogs. < ref name=Wang2002 > {{cite journal | author = Wang E. | year = 2002 | title = Diets of Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), Margays (L. wiedii), and Oncillas (L. tigrinus) in the Atlantic rainforest in Southeast Brazil | journal = Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–212 | url = http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/index/FN1FYN6WTTEKT95X.pdf | access-date = 2007-06-15 | doi = 10.1076/snfe.37.3.207.8564 | s2cid = 83976479 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The margay is able to hunt its prey entirely in trees. < ref name=Solórzano-filho2006 > {{cite journal | author = Solórzano-filho, J.A. | year = 2006 | url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/mamm.2006.70.issue-1_2/mamm.2006.031/mamm.2006.031.xml | title = Mobbing of ''Leopardus wiedii'' while hunting by a group of ''Sciurus ingrami'' in an ''Araucaria'' forest of Southeast Brazil | journal = Mammalia | volume = 70 | issue = 1/2 | pages = 156–157 | doi = 10.1515/MAMM.2006.031 | access-date = 2007-06-15}} < /ref >  However, they do sometimes hunt on the ground, and have been reported to eat [[cane rat]]s and [[guinea pig]]s. < ref name=WCoW/ > 
 
 There is a report of a margay using sound [[mimicry]] to lure a prey. A margay was seen to imitate the call of an infant [[Saguinus bicolor|pied tamarin]] while in the presence of a group of adult tamarins. This caused the adults to investigate. Although the margay was not successful in catching a monkey, this was the first observation of a Neotropical predator using this type of [[Mimicry#Aggressive mimicry|mimicry]]. < ref name = mimic > {{Cite journal | last = Calleia F.O.

 Margays are mainly nocturnal, but they do sometimes hunt during the day. They prefer to spend most of their life in the trees, but also travel across the ground, especially when moving between hunting areas. During the day, they rest in safe branches or clumps of [[liana]]s. 
 
 Like most cats, they are solitary: the adults usually meet only to mate. They have large home ranges of {{convert|11|to|16|km2|mi2}}. They use [[scent]] to mark their territory ([[urine]] spraying) and leave scratch marks on the ground or on branches. Their vocalisations are short range: they do not call to each other over long distances. < ref name=WCoW > Sunquist, Mel  &  Sunquist, Fiona 2002. ''Wild cats of the World''.

 === Special adaptations === 
 The margay is one of only two cat species with [[ankle]]s [[wikt:flexibility|flexible]] enough to climb head-first down trees. < ref name=WCoW/ >  The other is the [[clouded leopard]]; the little-studied [[marbled cat]] may also have this ability. 
 
 The margay is very agile; its ankles can turn up to 180 degrees, < ref name=G > Garman, Andrew 1997. [http://www.agarman.dial.pipex.com/margay.htm Margay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114220538/http://www.agarman.dial.pipex.com/margay.htm |date=2009-01-14 }} < /ref >  it can grasp branches equally well with its fore and hind paws, and it is able to jump up to {{convert|12|ft|m}} horizontally. < ref name=WCoW/ >  The margay has been seen to hang from branches with only one foot, and can run upside down beneath branches. < ref name=G/ > 
 
 == Conservation == 
 Although once thought to be [[endangered species|vulnerable]] to [[extinct]]ion, the [[IUCN]] now lists it as only  " near threatened " . < ref name=iucn/ >  It roams the rainforests from [[Mexico]] to [[Argentina]]. Actually, it is a successful and widespread species. It has ten [[subspecies]] over a large geographical range from [[Mexico]] to [[Argentina]]. Its past range even included the southern [[United States]]. < ref > {{cite book |last1 = Kays |first1 = Roland W. |last2 = Wilson |first2 = Don E. | year = 2002 |title = Mammals of North America |url = https://archive.org/details/mammalsofnortham00rola_0 |location = Princeton and Oxford  |publisher = Princeton University Press |isbn = 0-691-07012-1 }} < /ref > 
 
 They are hunted mainly for their fur and this has resulted in a large population decrease - around 14,000 are killed a year. They also suffer from a loss of [[habitat]], which is also a significant part of this decline. < ref name=iunc > IUNC Wild Cats Book.  " Margay facts. Big Cat Rescue. IUNC, n.d. Web.
