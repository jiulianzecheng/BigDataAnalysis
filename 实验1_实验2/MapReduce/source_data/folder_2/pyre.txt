 A '''pyre''', also known as a '''funeral pyre''', is a [[structure]] used for burning a body. The word ''pyre'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for ''fire''. Pyres are built outdoors. They are usually made from wood. The body is placed on top of the pyre or under it. Then the pyre is set on [[fire]]. Pyres are still used for [[funeral]]s in some parts of the world. They are also used for other types of [[ceremony|ceremonies]]. In those ceremonies, there is a big fire, but a body is not burned. Historically, pyres have also been used to kill people by burning them alive. 
 
 ==Pyres used for funerals== 
 The [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Sikhism|Sikh]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religions still use pyres for the [[cremation]] of dead people. This form of [[funeral]] is thousands of years old. < ref name= " Times " > {{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1072759.ece|title='Illegal' funeral pyre burnt in secret|last=Norfolk|first=Andrew|date=13 July 2006|work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2011}} < /ref > < ref > Be√©r, Robert (2004).

The [[Viking]]s also used them. Viking funeral pyres were usually built on boats floating in the sea. < ref name= " Guardian " > {{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1820024,00.html|title=The question: Why are funeral pyres illegal?|last=Fernando|first=Shehani|date=14 July 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=19 January 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Other uses for pyres== 
 People sometimes use pyres to make a big fire or [[bonfire]] but they do not burn a real body. These types of pyres are used for [[celebration]]s or to remember a person or a special event. Pyres are often used in [[Guy Fawkes Night]] celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. In [[Denmark]] and [[Germany]] people light pyres to celebrate the [[summer solstice]] (the longest day of the year). People light pyres in [[Switzerland]] to celebrate their [[National Day]]. 
 
 Farmers sometimes use pyres to destroy the bodies of dead animals. They especially use them when the animals have died of a [[disease]]. This helps prevent the spread of the disease to other animals. < ref name= " Guardian "  / > 
 
 In the past, pyres were sometimes used to [[execution|execute]] people. The people were burned while they were still alive. Often the person was tied to a stake (a very big stick) on top of the pyre. This type of execution was known as  " [[wikt:burn at the stake|burning at the stake]] " . [[Joan of Arc]] died in this way.
