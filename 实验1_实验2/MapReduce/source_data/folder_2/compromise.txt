To '''compromise''' is to make a deal where one person gives up part of his or her [[demand]]. In [[argument]]s, ''compromise'' is a concept of finding [[agreement]] through [[communication]], through a mutual acceptance of terms, while often involving variations from an original [[Objective (goal)|goal]] or desire.  
 [[Extremism]] is often considered as [[antonym]] to compromise, which, depending on context, may be associated with concepts of balance or [[tolerance]]. In the negative [[connotation]], compromise may be referred to as ''capitulation'', referring to a  " surrender "  of objectives, principles, or material, in the process of negotiating an agreement. In human relationships,  " compromise "  is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with, this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little. < ref name= " pmhut " > {{cite web|url=http://www.pmhut.com/methods-of-dealing-with-conflict-part-ii|title=Methods of Dealing with Conflict - Part II|author=Global Knowledge|year=2008|publisher=PM Hut|access-date=2010-01-11}} < /ref > 
   
 From cultural background and influences, the meaning and perception of the word  " compromise "  may be different: In the [[UK]], [[Ireland]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the word  " compromise "  has a positive meaning (as a [[consent]], an [[agreement]] where both parties win something); in the U.S., it can have rather negative connotations, as in  " compromising principles "  as a sell-out of basic beliefs. 
 
 == Studies in compromise == 
 Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like [[game theory]] and the [[voting]] system. 
 
 Research has indicated that less-than-optimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party, and hence, they settle for suboptimal agreements. Mutually-better outcomes can often be found by careful study of both parties' interests, especially if done early in negotiations.
