 '''''Rickettsia''''' is a unique [[genus]] classified between a [[virus]] and a [[bacteria]]. The organism is unique in that it has a [[cell wall]] and exists only in living cells like a virus, but is susceptible to [[antibiotics]] like bacteria. 
 
 The method of growing ''Rickettsia'' in chicken embryos was invented by [[Ernest William Goodpasture]] and his colleagues at [[Vanderbilt University]] in the early 1930s.
