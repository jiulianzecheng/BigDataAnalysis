 '''''Ophthalmosaurus''''' was an [[ichthyosaur]] of the [[Upper Jurassic]] (165 to 150 million years ago), named after its large [[eye]]s. Well-preserved skeletons, ranging in age from juveniles to adults, have been found in [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Argentina]]. 
 
 ''Ophthalmosaurus'' had the largest eyes of any [[vertebrate]] ''relative to its body size''. Its eyes, 4 inches in diameter, occupied most of the space in the skull. They were protected by bony plates ([[sclerotic ring]]s), which most likely assisted to maintain the shape of the eyeballs against water pressure at depth. < ref name= " motani " > University of California Museum of Natural History: Motani's ichthyosaur page [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/eyes.html] < /ref > 
 The size of the eyes and the sclerotic rings suggests that ''Ophthalmosaurus'' hunted at a depth where there is not much light or that it may have hunted at night when a prey species was more active. Its snout was long and thin, perfect for snapping at fast, maneuverable, prey. 
 
 Calculations suggest that a typical ''Ophthalmosaurus'' could stay submerged for approximately 20 minutes or more. < ref > University of California Museum of Natural History: Motani's ichthyosaur page [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/motani/ichthyo/diving.html] < /ref >  The swimming speed of ''Ophthalmosaurus'' has been estimated at 2.5 metres per second or greater. Even assuming a conservative speed of 1 m/s, an ''Ophthalmosaurus'' would be able to dive to 600 meters and return to the surface within 20 minutes. 
 
 The family Ophthalmosauridae continued into the [[Upper Cretaceous]], but this [[genus]] became [[extinct]] at the end of the [[Jurassic]] period.
