 '''Bey'''{{efn|{{lang-ota|بك|beğ|script=Arab}}, {{lang-tr|bey}}, {{lang-az|bəy}}, {{lang-tk|beg}}, {{lang-uz|бек}}, {{lang-kk|би/бек}}, {{lang-ky|бий/бек}}, {{lang-tt-Cyrl|бәк|translit=bäk}}, {{lang-cjs|пий/пек}}, {{lang-sq|beu/bej}}, {{lang-hr|beg}}, {{lang-sr|beg}}, {{lang-fa|بیگ|beyg}}/{{transliteration|fa|beig}}, {{lang-tg|бек}}, {{lang-ar|بيه, بك|bēh, bek}}}} also spelled as '''Baig,''' '''Bayg''', '''Beigh''', '''Beig''', '''Bek''', '''Baeg''' or '''Beg''' is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] title for a [[chieftain]], and an [[honorific]] title traditionally applied to people with special lineages to the leaders or rulers of variously sized areas in the numerous Turkic kingdoms, emirates, sultanates and empires in [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], and the [[Middle East]], such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]] or the various [[khanates]] and [[emirate]]s in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Eurasian Steppe]]. The feminine equivalent title was [[begum]]. The regions or provinces where  " beys "  ruled or which they administered were called ''beylik'', roughly meaning  " governorate "  and/or  " region "  (the equivalent of [[county]] in other parts of Europe). However the exact scope of power handed to the beks (alternative spelling to beys) varied with each country, thus there was no clear-cut system, rigidly applied to all countries defining all the possible power and prestige that came along with the title. 
 
 In modern times, the word is still used formally as a social title for men. It is cited after the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names.
