 '''Hedylidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[insects]] in the [[lepidoptera]]n order,  
 They are also called the  " American moth-butterflies " . Butterflies evolved from [[moths]], and this group is rather moth-like. 
 
 They are [[Extant taxon|living]] [[sister group]] to the butterfly superfamily [[Papilionoidea]]. In 1986, Scoble combined all 35 species into a single genus '''''Macrosoma'''''. They are all entirely [[tropical|neotropical]] species from [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|southern America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. < ref name = " Scoble86 " > {{cite journal |author=Scoble MJ |year=1986 |title=The structure and affinities of the Hedyloidea: a new concept of the butterflies |journal=Bull.

 [[DNA sequence]] analysis of this group continues.
