 '''Eyeshine''' or '''tapetum lucidum''' is when an animal's eyes glow in the dark. 
 
 When light goes into the animal's eye, it hits a [[membrane|web of cells]] called the [[tapetum]] behind the [[retina|light collector]].  These cells reflect the light like a mirror.  The light goes through the animal's light collector twice, once on the way in and once on the way out.  This helps the animal see in the dark. < ref name=YN > Ilo Hiller
