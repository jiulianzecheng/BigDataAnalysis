 The name 'lysozyme' was coined in 1922 by [[Alexander Fleming]] (1881–1955), the discoverer of [[penicillin]]. < ref name= " Fleming_1922 " > {{cite journal | author = Fleming A | title = On a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions  |  journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 93 | issue = 653 | pages = 306–317 | date= 1922| pmid =  | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1922.0023| jstor = 80959 | bibcode = 1922RSPSB..93..306F | url = https://www.jstor.org/pss/80959 }} < /ref >  Fleming first observed the antibacterial action of lysozyme when he treated bacterial cultures with nasal mucus from a patient suffering from a [[common cold]]. < ref name= " Fleming_1922 "  / > 
 
 Lysozyme is in a number of secretions, such as [[tears]], saliva, [[milk]], and [[mucus]]. It is also present in [[cytoplasm]]ic [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] of [[macrophage]]s and [[granulocyte]] [[neutrophil]]s. 
 
 The enzyme works by attacking [[polymers]] in the cell walls of bacteria, especially [[Gram-positive]] bacteria like  ''[[Bacillus]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus]]''. 
 
 Lysozyme was the second [[protein]] structure, and the first enzyme structure,  solved by [[X-ray diffraction]] methods. It was the first enzyme to be fully [[sequence analysis|sequenced]] that contains all twenty common [[amino acids]]. < ref name= " Canfield1963 " > {{cite journal | journal=J Biol Chem | volume=238 | issue=8 | pages=2698–2707 | year=1963 | author = Canfield R.E | title=The amino acid sequence of egg white lysozyme | doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)67888-3 | pmid=14063294 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/238/8/2698.short | doi-access=free }} < /ref >
