 The '''drivetrain''' of a [[motor vehicle]] is the group of parts that deliver power to the [[wheel]]s that move the vehicle. < ref name= " Bosch, Drivetrain "   > {{Cite book|title=Automotive Handbook |year=1993|isbn=0-8376-0330-7 |publisher=Bosch |edition=3rd|chapter=Drivetrain|ref={{harvid|Bosch|Automotive Handbook}}|page=536}} < /ref >  The drivetrain includes the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] or [[transaxle]], [[driveshaft]]s, [[differential]]s, [[axle]]s and [[wheel]]s. < ref name=MTI > {{cite web |url=http://www.mistertransmission.com/what-is-a-drivetrain|title=What is a Drivetrain?|publisher=Mister Transmission (International) Limited|access-date=30 August 2015}} < /ref >  It does not include the [[engine]] or motor that creates the power. < ref name=MTI/ >  In contrast, the [[powertrain]] includes the engine and the drivetrain. In order to transmit power from the engine to the rear wheels, the drivetrain uses some of that power to work. < ref name=SmithHRN > {{cite web |url=http://www.hotrod.com/how-to/transmission-drivetrain/ccrp-0311-drivetrain-power-loss/|title=Drivetrain Power Loss - The Brutal Truth|author=Jeff Smith|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Hot Rod Network/TEN|access-date=30 August 2015}} < /ref >  '''Drivetrain loss''' is the power lost, measured in [[horsepower]], between what the engine generates and what is available at the wheels. < ref name=PratteSSO > {{cite web |url=http://www.superstreetonline.com/how-to/engine/modp-1005-drivetrain-power-loss/|title=Drivetrain Power Loss - The 15%  " Rule " |author=David Pratte|date=7 May 2010|publisher=Super Street Online/TEN|access-date=30 August 2015}} < /ref >  As power is transmitted through the drivetrain, forces including [[inertia]], [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and [[friction]] cause some power to be wasted. < ref name=PratteSSO/ >  The more component parts power is transmitted through, the more power is lost. However each combination of drivetrain parts is different as to how much is lost. < ref name=PratteSSO/ >  The [[automatic transmission]] wastes the most power of any drivetrain component. < ref name=SmithHRN/ >
