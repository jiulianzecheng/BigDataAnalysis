 A '''tweeter''' is a small or rather tiny [[loudspeaker]]. Tweeters are designed to reproduce high-[[Pitch (music)|pitched]] sounds (such as the sound of a [[whistle]] or a [[bird]] singing). It can mean sound's [[frequency]] going up to 20[[Hertz|kHz]]. Humans can't hear frequencies larger than 20 000 Hz. Low frequencies would destroy small speakers because it is not designed to create larger movements. This is what a [[subwoofer]] is for, to play low frequencies.
