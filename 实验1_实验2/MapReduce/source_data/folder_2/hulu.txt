 Hulu's subscription service was launched in beta (preview) on June 29, 2010, and officially launched on November 17, 2010, under the branding Hulu Plus. The service remained advertising-supported, but it offers an expanded content library including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available. Hulu also launched Hulu Plus apps on other types of devices, including mobile, [[digital media]] players, and [[video game]] consoles. By the end of 2011, Hulu Plus had around 1.5 million subscribers. 
 
 On April 29, 2015, it was announced that the  " Hulu Plus "  branding would be discontinued, and that the service would be henceforth marketed as simply  " Hulu "  to place it in-line with its subscription-only competitors. By then, the service had grown to 9 million subscribers.
