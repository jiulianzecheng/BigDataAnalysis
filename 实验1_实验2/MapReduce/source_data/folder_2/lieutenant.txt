 === First Lieutenant === 
 A first lieutenant (1LT) (1stLt) (1st Lt) (O2) is the [[wikt:senior|senior]] rank of lieutenant. A first lieutenant is also addressed as  " lieutenant " . < ref name=lieuMA/ >  In the army, a first lieutenant often functions as the [[executive officer]] of a [[Company (military unit)]]. A company may have from 110 to 140 [[wikt:personnel|personnel]]. In the British Army, an officer may hold this rank for up to three years. < ref name=ranksBA/ > 
 
 There is great variation in the insignia used worldwide. In most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, as well as a number of European and South American nations, full lieutenants (and equivalents) usually wear two stars (pips) and second lieutenants (and equivalents) one. An example of an exception is the United States, whose armed forces distinguish their lieutenant ranks with one silver bar for first lieutenant and one gold (brass) bar for second lieutenant.
