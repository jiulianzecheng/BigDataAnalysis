Now Nihari is available in Pakistani restaurants around the world. A particular favorite is nalli nihari, which is made with marrow added to nihari, and makes the stew very rich. In some restaurants, a few kilos from each day's leftover Nihari is added to the next day's pot. This re-used portion of Nihari is called ''taar'' and is believed to provide the unique flavour. Some Nihari outlets in old Delhi boast of an unbroken taar going back more than a century. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/19112010/page13.shtml|title=Dilli Ka Dastarkhwan|access-date=28 November 2014}} < /ref >
