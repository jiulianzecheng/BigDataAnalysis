 '''Thinis''' or '''This''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: '''Tjenu''') was the [[capital city]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|first dynasties]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. The actual site of Thinis has not yet been discovered. Ancient writers, such as [[Manetho]], said it was the centre of the [[Thinite Confederacy]]. Their leader [[Menes]] (or [[Narmer]]), united [[Egypt]] and was its first [[pharaoh]]. In the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] the capital was moved to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. This meant that Thinis was no longer important. It still played a role in administration  becauset was close to border of the competing [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolitan]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] dynasties of the [[First Intermediate Period]]. It was also near [[Oasis|oases]] of  military importance, during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New]] Kingdoms. Thinis lost its position as a regional administrative centre by the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. 
 
 Due to its ancient heritage, Thinis remained a significant religious centre. It was the home to the tomb and [[mummy]] of the local god.  In ancient Egyptian [[religious cosmology]], as seen (for example) in the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', Thinis played a role as a mythical place in [[heaven]]. < ref name= " Massey " > Massey 1907: 637 < /ref > 
 
 The exact site of Thinis is unknown. Historians believe its was near ancient [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and modern [[Girga]]. < ref name= " Gardiner1 " > Gardiner 1964: 430 n.1 < /ref > < ref name= " Ryholt1 " > Ryholt 1997: 163 n. 594 < /ref > < ref name= " Strudwick1 " > Strudwick 2005: 509 < /ref >
