 An '''asset''' is something valuable or useful. In [[business]] and [[accounting]], the value of an asset is expressed as a certain amount of [[money]]. The amount of money can be calculated as the amount of economic value that the asset can produce in future. The calculation is based on [[past]] [[transaction]]s or events. Correct evaluation can be useful in deciding what to do with an asset. 
 
 Examples of assets include [[money]], [[property]] (land and buildings), and [[accounts receivable|amounts to be received]] from someone. 
 
 There are two types of assets:  
 *[[Wiktionary:tangible|tangible]] assets 
 **Fixed assets such as buildings, equipment etc. 
 **Current assets like inventory 
 *[[Wiktionary:intangible|Intangible]] assets for example: [[goodwill]], [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[copyrights]] and [[computer programs]] 
 
 ==Asset characteristics== 
 
 Assets have three important characteristics: 
 
 *They can give a future benefit to contribute directly or indirectly to future net [[cash flows]], and, in the case of [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organizations]], to give [[service]]s; 
 *It can control [[access]] to the benefit; and, 
 *The transaction or event which created the asset has already occurred.
