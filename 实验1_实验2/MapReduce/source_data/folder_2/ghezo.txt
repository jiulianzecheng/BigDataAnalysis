Ghezo was a [[king]] of the [[Dahomey]] in [[Benin]] in the 19th Century. After Ghezo’s [[father]] Agonglo died, Ghezo’s [[brother]] Adandozan became king. In 1818, Adandozan [[jail]]ed Francisco Félix de Souza, a [[slave trade]]r from [[Brazil]] but de Souza escaped and made a deal with Ghezo to launch a [[coup d’état]] to force Adandozan to [[abdicate]]. Officially, Ghezo was [[regent]] for Adandozan’s [[son]] Dakpo but then in 1838, Ghezo declared his own son Glele [[heir apparent]]. Dakpo and Adandozan decided to [[fight]] Ghezo to change this and the fight started a [[fire]] which [[kill]]ed Dakpo making Ghezo official [[king]] of Dahomey. 
 
 ==War with Oyo== 
 An [[empire]] called the Oyo had had the [[Dahomey]] pay [[tax]]es to them every year since 1730. Then in 1823, Ghezo refused to pay the tax the Oyo wanted. When the Oyo sent an [[ambassador]] to Ghezo to change his [[mind]], Ghezo [[kill]]ed him. The Oyo then went to [[war]] with Ghezo and the [[Kingdom]] of Dahomey.  Ghezo defeated and killed the Oyo [[leader]] Ajanaku and won the war. 
 
 ==Other Wars== 
 After beating the Oyo, Ghezo created his own [[empire]] which was based on [[slavery]]. Ghezo had people captured and enslaved so to escape him [[people]] ran away to a place called the city of [[Abeokuta]]. Ghezo started to wage [[war]] against Abeokuta to get [[slaves]].  
 
 Then in 1849, a [[man]] named [[William Winniett]] from the [[British Empire]] sent someone named Frederick Forbes to Ghezo to convince King Ghezo to end the [[slave trade]]. Ghezo ignored this and went back to [[attack]]ing Abeokuta. After he lost in 1852, Ghezo decided to [[ban]] the slave trade but he went back to the [[war]]s against Abeokuta in 1858. 
 
 ==Controversy over the Slave Trade== 
 Because the [[British Empire]] wanted the [[Dahomey]] to end the [[slave trade]] it was a major [[controversy]]. One [[faction]] known as the [[Fly]] faction said that the [[Dahomey]] should end the [[slave trade]] like the British wanted. But King Ghezo and the [[Elephant]] faction said that they should keep the [[slave trade]].  Ghezo wanted to continue to sell [[slaves]] to Francisco Félix de Souza. In 1852, Ghezo still signed a [[treaty]] with the [[British Empire]] to end the [[slave trade]]. But in 1857, Ghezo brought it back. 
 
 ==Death== 
 In 1859, Ghezo died, either of [[smallpox]] or because he was [[kill]]ed by his [[enemies]] and his [[son]] Glele replaced him as [[king]].
