 A '''corkscrew''' is a [[tool]] which is used to open [[wine]] bottles. It is inserted into the [[Cork (material)|cork]] and used to pull the cork out of the wine bottle. Corkscrews are needed because the cork cannot be gripped otherwise.

 In 1732 an [[:wikt:anonymous|anonymous]] [[poem]] shows just how far a man was willing to go to open a bottle of wine:  
 {{cquote|Sir Roger set his teeth to work/ This way and that he ply'd/ And wrench'd in vain from side to side. Sir Roger then burned the cork from the top and pushed the remainder into the bottleâ€”only to get his thumb stuck in the neck. < ref name=Taber15 > George M. Taber, ''To Cork Or Not To Cork'' (New York: Scribner, 2009), p. 15 < /ref > }} 
 
 With the popularity of wine today, a corkscrew is a common item in kitchens, [[Public house|pubs]] (bars) and [[restaurants]]. It takes between 50 and 100 pounds of force to remove a cork from a wine bottle. < ref name=MacNeil90 > Karen MacNeil, ''The Wine Bible'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2001), p. 90 < /ref >   
 
 == History == 
 
 The basic design of a corkscrew is been based on a tool called a [[gun worm]]. This was used by a [[:en:wikt:musketeer|musketeer]] to remove an unfired [[bullet]] from a [[musket]]'s barrel. < ref name=Taber15/ >  In the 1800s, many [[manufacturer]]s that made gun worms also made corkscrews. < ref name=MacNeil90/ >  The first [[patent]]ed corkscrew in [[England]] was by Samuel Henshall in 1795. < ref name=Taber15/ >  In 1883 a flat, [[lever]]-style corkscrew called the waiter's friend was invented in [[Germany]] by Karl Wienke. It is commonly used in restaurants today. < ref > Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Drink: An A-Z of Alcoholic Beverages'' (Wordsworth Editions Ltd., 2005), p. 627 < /ref >
