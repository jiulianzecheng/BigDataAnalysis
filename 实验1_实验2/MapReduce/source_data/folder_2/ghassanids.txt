'''Ghassanids''', are an [[Arab]] clan who came to the [[Levant]] from [[Yemen]] before Islam. Ghassanids were [[Christian]]s. Some of them remain  Christians until modern days especially in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Palestine]], and [[Israel]]. The Ghassanids were a puppet of the Byzantine Empire during the Byzantine-Sassanid wars during the war they fought against the Lakhmids. The Ghassanids were annexed by the Muslim Caliphate in the mid 600s AD.
