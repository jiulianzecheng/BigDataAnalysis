 In the [[Schools of Islamic theology|four schools]] of [[Sunni]] [[fiqh]] ([[Islamic jurisprudence]]), and the two schools of [[Shi'a]] fiqh, the term zināʾ is a sin of sexual intercourse that is not allowed by [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and classed as a [[hudud]] crime (class of Islamic punishments that are fixed for certain crimes that are considered to be  " claims of God " ). < ref > Julie Chadbourne (1999), ''Never wear your shoes after midnight: Legal trends under the Pakistan Zina Ordinance'', ''Wisconsin International Law Journal'', Vol. 17, pp. 179-234 < /ref >   To prove an act of zina, a [[qadi]] (religious judge) in a sharia court relies on an unmarried woman's [[pregnancy]], the confession in the name of [[Allah]], or four witnesses to the actual act of penetration. The last two types of prosecutions are uncommon. Most cases of zina in the history of Islam have been pregnant unmarried women. < ref name=keciali > Kecia Ali (2006), ''Sexual Ethics and Islam'', {{ISBN|978-1851684564}}, Chapter 4 < /ref > < ref > M. Tamadonfar (2001), Islam, law, and political control in contemporary Iran, ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'', 40(2): 205-220 < /ref >  In some schools of Islamic law, a pregnant woman accused of zina who denies sex was consensual must prove she was [[rape]]d with four eye[[witness]]es [[wikt:testimony|testifying]] before the court.  This has led to many cases where rape [[victim]]s have been punished for zina. < ref name=aquraishi > A.

 The above sense of ''zina'' is not to be confused with the woman's name ''Zina'' or ''Zeina'' (زينة). The name has a different [[Linguistics|linguistic]] root (Greek ''xen''-). It also has a different meaning ( " guest, stranger " ), is pronounced differently (either Zīnah or Zaynah), and is usually spelled differently. < ref name=baby > {{cite web|title=Zina meaning and name origin|url=http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Zina|website=thinkbabynames.com|access-date=16 September 2014|archive-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032229/http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Zina|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
