'''Crystallography''' is the study of the arrangement of [[atom]]s in [[solid]]s that are mostly in three dimensional pattern. < ref > Howard M.  &  D. ''Introduction to crystallography and mineral crystal systems''.

 Before the development of [[X-ray crystallography]], the study of [[crystal]]s was based on their [[geometry]]. This involves measuring the [[angle]]s of crystal faces, and establishing the [[symmetry]] of the crystal in question. 
 
 == X-ray diffraction == 
 Crystal structure is now found by analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type. 
 
 The technique was jointly invented by Sir [[William Bragg]] (1862–1942) and his son Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]] (1890–1971), who jointly won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for 1915. Lawrence Bragg was the youngest to become a Nobel Laureate. He was the Director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[Cambridge University]], when the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] was made by [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in February 1953. < ref > {{Cite web|title=X-ray diffraction {{!}} physics|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/X-ray-diffraction|access-date=2021-04-08|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 [[X-ray]]s are most commonly used, but for some purposes [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s are used. Because of the different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies. 
 
 === Technique === 
 Some materials studied using crystallography, [[protein]]s for example, do not always occur naturally as crystals. Normally such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days, weeks, or months. 
 
 Once a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of [[radiation]]. Although X-ray equipment is commonplace, crystallography often uses special [[synchrotron light source]]s to make X-rays. They produce purer and more complete patterns. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams, so [[Information|data]] collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources.  
 
 Producing an [[image]] from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]]. 
 
 The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''[[pattern]]s,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly [[array]]s. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be got to crystallize.  
 
 In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by [[fibre]]s and [[powder]]s. For example, the double-helical structure of [[DNA]] was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been got from a fibrous sample. 
 
 == Electron diffraction ==

 [[Electron crystallography]] is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission [[electron microscope]] (TEM). The method was invented by [[Aaron Klug]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this, and his studies on [[virus]] structures and [[transfer RNA]], in 1982. 
 
 The first electron crystallographic protein structure to achieve atomic resolution was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990.

 Crystallography is a tool that is often employed in [[materials science]]. The understanding of crystal structures is needed to understand crystallographic defects.  
 
 A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography. For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction [[Perpendicularity|perpendicular]] to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic [[texture]] measurements. 
 
 Crystallography includes the [[symmetry]] patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal.  
 
 === Biology === 
 [[X-ray crystallography]] was the primary method for determining the [[3-D]] molecular structure of biological [[macromolecule]]s. The most important of these are [[enzyme]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. In fact, the [[double helix]] structure of DNA was worked out from crystallographic data.  
 
 The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958  < ref > Kendrew J.C. ''et al.'' 1958. A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis. ''Nature'' '''181''', 662–666 [http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/kendrew/kendrew.pdf] < /ref >  The [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of [[protein]]s and other biological macromolecules. Computer programs can be used to help visualize biological molecular structures. 
 
 X-ray crystallography has now given way to [[electron crystallography]] for [[macromolecule]]s which do not form large [[3-D]] crystals.
