 '''Leishmania''' is a [[protist]] 
 organism which causes [[Leishmaniasis]]. It is a [[Trypanosomatid]] parasite in the [[Euglenozoa]] [[phylum]]. 
 
 It is spread by [[sandflies]] of the genus ''Phlebotomus'' in the Old World, and of the genus ''Lutzomyia'' in the New World.  
 
 Their primary hosts are [[vertebrates]]; Leishmania commonly infects [[hyrax]]es, [[canids]], [[rodents]], and humans. Leishmania currently affects 12 million people in 98 countries. 
 The parasite was named in 1903 after the Scottish pathologist William Boog Leishman. 
 
 == Diseases == 
 The parasite causes three kinds of disease. Each type of disease is caused by different species of the parasite. 
 
 #Skin disease: the ''Oriental sore'' 
 #[[Mucous membrane]] leishmaniasis: can be fatal 
 #Visceral disease of the [[liver]] and [[spleen]], and [[anaemia]]. So-called ''kala-azar'' 
 
 == Structure == 
 ''Leishmania'' have a [[lipophosphoglycan]] coat on the outside of the cell. This is a trigger for [[toll-like receptor]] 2, a signalling receptor which triggers an [[innate immune response]] in mammals. The parasite can withstand the counter-attack by the immune system. There are treatments, which consist in helping the immune system to respond.
