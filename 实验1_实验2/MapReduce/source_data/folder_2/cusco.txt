 '''Cusco''' is a city in southeastern [[Peru]], near the [[Huatanay Valley]] (Sacred Valley) in the [[Andes]] mountain range. It is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[Cusco Region]]. The city has a population of about 300 000, triple the population it had just 20 years ago. Alternate spellings include '''Qusqu''' (in old [[Quechua]]), '''Cusco,''' (after the Spanish arrived), and '''{{lang|qu|Qosqo}}''' current [[Quechua]]. '''Cusco''' is the preferred way to spell it in Spanish. 
 
 == Inca history == 
 [[File:cusco church la compania.jpg|thumb|left|The Church of La Compañía on the Plaza de Armas in Cusco]] 
 Cusco was the capital of [[Tahuantinsuyu]] (or [[Inca Empire]]). The city was planned to be shaped like a [[puma]]. The city had two areas: the ''hurin'' and ''hanan'', which were further divided to each be part of two of the four provinces of the Inca Empire: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Cuntisuyu (SW), and Collasuyu (SE). 
 
 A [[road]] led from each of these quarters to the corresponding quarter of the empire. Each local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, but only in the quarter of Cusco that corresponded to the quarter of the empire he had territory in. 
 
 According to Inca [[legend]], the city was built by [[Sapa Inca]] [[Pachacuti]], the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cusco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of Tahuantinsuyu. But archaeological evidence points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before [[Pachacuti]]even though he did initiate growth in the city after defeating the Chancas as a monument to Incan glory. There was however a city [[plan]], and two rivers were changed to flow around the city. 
 
 == Post-Columbian Cusco == 
 The first [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers arrived in the city on November 15, 1533. Spanish ''[[conquistador]]'', or ''conqueror'', [[Francisco Pizarro]], however, officially refounded Cusco on March 23, 1534, naming it the  " Very noble and great city of Cusco " . The many buildings constructed after the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish conquest]] have Spanish influence with a mix of [[Inca]] [[architecture]]. The Spanish made a new city on the foundations of the old Inca city, replacing Incan temples with churches and palaces for the Spanish. In the [[colony]], the city of Cusco was very rich, thanks to the agriculture, [[cattle]] raising, mining and trade with [[Spain]]. Many churches and convents were built, and even a Cathedral, and the [[Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco]]. 
 
 [[File:Koricancha.jpg|thumb|250px|Koricancha temple and Church of Santo Domingo]] 
 The major [[earthquake]] that hit Cusco in 1950 badly destroyed the Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive [[Koricancha]] (Temple of the Sun). The city's Inca architecture, however, survived the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite walls of the Koricancha were exposed, as well as many walls throughout the city. While some wanted to restore the buildings to their colonial splendor, some of Cusco citizens urged city officials to retain the exposed walls. Eventually they won out and now tourists from around the world enjoy looking at these ruins within the living city. The 1950 earthquake was the second time that the Dominican Priory had been destroyed, the first being in 1650 when another major earthquake struck Cusco. 
 
 == Nearby sights == 
 Other nearby Inca sites are: Pachacuti's presumed winter home [[Machu Picchu]], which can be reached by a lightly maintained [[Inca road system|Inca trail]]; the  " fortress "  at [[Ollantaytambo]]; and the  " fortress "  of [[Sacsayhuaman]] which is approximately two kilometers from Cusco. Other less visited ruins include [[Inca Wasi]], the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,134 feet), and [[Vilcabamba, Perú|Old Vilcabamba]] the capital of the Inca after the Spanish took over Cusco. 
 
 The surrounding area, in the [[Huatanay Valley]], is strong in agriculture. There is [[maize|corn]], [[barley]], [[quinoa]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] grown. 
 
 Cusco's main stadium, [[Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega]], attracted many tourists during South America's continental soccer championship, the [[Copa América 2004]], which was held in [[Peru]].
