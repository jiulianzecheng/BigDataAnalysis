 A '''chakra''' is an energy center in the human body as taught in [[India]]n [[yoga]] and some related cultures. Chakras are also believed in by some [[New Age]] adherents. Chakra means ‘Aneel or wheel' in [[Sanskrit]]. 
 
 According to people who believe in their existence, a chakra is an area in the body connected with life energy. They say that there are seven chakras in the body - each is an interface for the flow of life energy. They say that a chakra vitalizes a physical body and is associated with interactions of a physical or mental nature. They also say that current science is not able to detect or measure chakras. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Purification and disclosure of human chakras|url=https://www.astromeridian.ru/magic/kak_prochistit_chakry.html|access-date=|website=|language=|archive-date=2021-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211204172349/https://www.astromeridian.ru/magic/kak_prochistit_chakry.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Definitions == 
 Although there are various interpretations as to what exactly a chakra is, the following features are common in all systems: 
 * They form part of a subtle energy body, along with the energy channels, or [[nadis]], and the subtle winds, or [[pranas]]. 
 * They are located along a central nadi, [[Sushumna]], which runs either alongside or inside the spine. 
 * Two other nadis, [[Ida (yoga)|Ida]] and [[Pingala (yoga)|Pingala]], also run through the chakras, and alongside Sushumna. They occasionally cross Sushumna at the location of the chakras. 
 * They possess a number of 'petals' or 'spokes'. In some traditions, such as the Tibetan, these spokes branch off into the thousands of nadis that run throughout the human body. 
 * They are generally associated with a [[mantric|mantra]] seed-syllable, and often with a variety of colours and deities. 
 
 
 ==Types of Chakras== 
 The seven main chakras are described as being present in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine]] to the head. The chakras are usually connected with a certain color. Each chakra is also connected with some part of consciousness.
