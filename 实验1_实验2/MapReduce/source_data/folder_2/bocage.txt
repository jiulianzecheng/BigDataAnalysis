 During [[World War II]] following the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Invasion of Normandy]], the allies found themselves in 'hedgerow country' (bocage). < ref name=Daugherty7172 > Leo Daugherty, ''The Battle of the Hedgerows: Bradley's First Army in Normady, June-July 1944'' (St. Paul, MN: MBI Pub. Co., 2001), pp. 71-72 < /ref >  It was ideal for [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops to hide in and not be seen until it was too late. < ref name=Daugherty7172/ >  The hedgerows were thick enough to hide [[tank]]s and [[artillery]] pieces. The final Allied [[:en:wikt:breakout|breakout]] of the bocage into open country took over eight weeks of fighting. < ref > William R. Buster, ''Time on target: the World War II memoir of William R.
