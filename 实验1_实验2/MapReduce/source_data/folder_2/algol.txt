 [[File:Algol AB movie imaged with the CHARA interferometer.gif|thumb|right|200px|English: Algol (Î² Persei) is a triple-star system (Algol A, B, and C) in the constellation Perseus.  
 The large and bright primary Algol A is regularly [[eclips]]ed by the dimmer Algol B every 2.87 days. The pair is separated by only 0.062 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) from each other, so close that Algol A is slowly stripping off Algol B's outer layers.]] 
 
 '''Algol''', also known as the '''Demon Star''', is a bright [[star]] in the [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] [[constellation]].  It is one of the best known double stars that can only be seen in [[spectroscope]]s, the first star of its type discovered, and one of the first [[variable star]]s  to be discovered before it explodes. Algol is made of three stars (Beta Persei A, B and C) and the brightest is '''Persei A'''. These stars partly [[eclipse]] each other every 2 & nbsp;days, 20 & nbsp;hours and 49 & nbsp;minutes for 10 hours. < ref > Beta Persei, American Association of Variable Star Observers.  http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0199.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708092301/http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/0199.shtml |date=2006-07-08 }} < /ref >
