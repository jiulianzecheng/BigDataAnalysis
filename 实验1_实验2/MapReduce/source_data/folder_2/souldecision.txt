 '''soulDecision''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Pop music|pop]] [[band]] from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  
 
 soulDecision was formed in 1993 under the original name, '''Indecision'''. They changed their name to '''soulDecision''' because of naming conflicts. Even though the band started during the [[boy band]] era, they were not a boy band, as they played their own instruments and  wrote their own music. The band released their debut full-length album ''[[No One Does It Better]]'' on August 22, 2000 in [[Canada]]. The album featured their hit single  " Faded "  which reached #1 on Canada's singles chart as well as #22 in the United States. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php? & file_num=nlc008388.8304 & type=1 & interval=20 & PHPSESSID=c6btf3r8hs459qqt5ln3o3dcv5 |title= Top Singles - Volume 70, No. 19, March 13 2000 |accessdate=2013-04-09 |publisher=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]}} < /ref >  The album also featured the single  " Ooh It's Kinda Crazy "  which reached #1 in Canada and was the number one request on [[MTV]]'s [[Total Request Live]] at the time. < ref name=MM > {{cite web |url=http://www.muchmusic.com/artists/346/souldecision/more/ |title= Who is soulDecision |accessdate=2013-04-09 |publisher=[[MuchMusic]]}} < /ref >  The band toured with [[Destiny's Child]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [['N Sync]]. < ref name= " MM "  / >
