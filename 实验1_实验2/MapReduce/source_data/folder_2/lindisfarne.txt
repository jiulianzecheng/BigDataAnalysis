 '''Lindisfarne''' (often called '''Holy Island'''), is a [[tidal island]] off the north-east coast of [[England]]. It is connected to the mainland of [[Northumberland]] by a [[causeway]] and is cut off twice a day by tides â€“ something well described by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]]: 
 
 :For with the flow and ebb, its style 
 :Varies from continent to isle; 
 :Dry shod o'er sands, twice every day, 
 :The pilgrims to the shrine find way; 
 :Twice every day the waves efface 
 :Of staves and sandalled feet the trace. 
 
 According to the 2001 census it had a usual population of 162. 
 
 ==Nature reserve== 
 Large parts of the island, and all of the adjacent inter-tidal area, are protected as '''Lindisfarne National Nature Reserve''' to help safeguard the internationally important wintering [[bird]] populations.  
 [[Grey seal]]s are frequent visitors to the rocky bays at high tide.

 The [[Abbey|monastery]] of '''Lindisfarne''' was founded by [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Saint Aidan]]. He was brought from [[Iona]] off the west coast of Scotland to [[Northumbria]] around AD 635 by King [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. It became the base for Christian evangelising in the North of England and also sent a successful mission to [[Mercia]]. Monks from the community of Iona settled on the island. 
 
 [[Northumberland]]'s patron saint, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]], was a monk and later [[Abbot]] of the [[monastery]], and his miracles and life are recorded by the [[Venerable Bede]]. Cuthbert later became Bishop of Lindisfarne. 
 
 In the early 700s the famous [[illuminated manuscript]] known as the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (an illustrated Latin copy of the [[Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) was made, probably at Lindisfarne. 
 
 Later, a monk named Aldred added an [[Anglo-Saxon]] translation to the Latin text. This made (late 10th century) the earliest surviving [[Old English language|Old English]] copies of the [[Gospels]]. 
 
 == History == 
 In 793 a [[Viking]] raid on Lindisfarne scared many people throughout the Christian West. The year 793 is often called the beginning of the age of Viking raids. A very famous passage in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] reads: 
 
 " In this year fierce, foreboding [[omen]]s came over the land of Northumbria. There were excessive whirlwinds, lightning storms, and fiery [[dragons]] were seen flying in the sky. These signs were followed by great [[famine]], and on January 8th of the same year, the ravaging of heathen men destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne. " 
 
 Eventually the monks fled the island. They took with them the body of St Cuthbert, which is now buried at [[Durham Cathedral]]. The [[priory]] was re-established in [[Normans|Norman]] times as a [[Benedictine]] house and continued until its dissolution in 1536 under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It is now a ruin in the care of [[English Heritage]], who also run a museum/visitor centre nearby. The neighbouring parish church (see below) is still in use. 
 
 Lindisfarne also has the small [[castle]], based on a Tudor fort and open to visitors.
