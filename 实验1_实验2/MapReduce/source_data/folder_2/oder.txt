 The '''Oder River''' ({{Lang-de|Oder}}; [[Czech language|Czech]]/{{Lang-pl|Odra}}) is a [[river]] in [[Central Europe]]. It starts in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Flux|flows]] through [[Poland]] and [[Germany]]. It forms 187 kilometers of the [[border]] between Poland and Germany. The river is 854 [[kilometre]]s long and ends in the [[Szczecin Lagoon]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. 
 
 Some bigger towns the Oder passes are [[Wrocław]], [[Eisenhüttenstadt]], [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt on the Oder]], [[Szczecin]] and [[Police, Poland|Police]]. The biggest city on the Oder River is [[Wrocław]], in [[Lower Silesia]], Poland. 
 
 == Names == 
 The Oder River has different names in different languages. Most of these names are very similar, or almost the same: 
 * [[English language|English]] and {{lang-de|Oder}} 
 * [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and {{lang-dsb|Odra}} 
 * {{lang-hsb|Wódra}} 
 * {{lang-csb|Òdra}} 
 These names come from the [[Latin language]] names. In [[Medieval Latin]] the river was called ''Od(d)era''. In [[Renaissance Latin]], which was invented in 1534, the river was called ''Viadrus''. 
 
 In the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, the name of the river was Vjodr. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.libraryindex.com/encyclopedia/pages/cpxlf4wc00/oder-feet-miles-channel.html |title=Encyclopædia Britannica's 9th edition 1870–1890: ''Oder'' |access-date=2011-05-15 |archive-date=2013-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506034613/http://www.libraryindex.com/encyclopedia/pages/cpxlf4wc00/oder-feet-miles-channel.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 == Geography == 
 The Oder is 854 & nbsp;km long. 112 & nbsp;km pass through the Czech Republic. 742 & nbsp;km pass through Poland. 187 & nbsp;km make up part of the [[border]] between Germany and Poland. 
 
 The Oder is the second-longest river in Poland. (The [[Vistula]] is the longest river.) 
 
 It begins in a [[watershed]] in the [[Oder Mountains]] that is 118,861 & nbsp;km². < ref name=britannica > " Oder River. "  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 15 May. 2011.  < http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/425072/Oder-River > . < /ref >  This [[basin]] is mostly in Poland, but a little bit is in the Czech Republic and Germany. The river runs through five [[voivodeship]]s in Poland, and two states in Germany. 
 
 The river ends in the [[Szczecin Lagoon]] near [[Police, Poland]]. Here the Oder [[split]]s into three other rivers: the [[Dziwna River]], the [[Świna River]], and the [[Peene River]]. These three rivers start in Szczecin Lagoon and end [[Bay of Pomerania]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. 
 
 The biggest city on the Oder River is [[Wrocław]] in [[Lower Silesia]], Poland.
