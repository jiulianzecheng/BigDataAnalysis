A '''mindset''' is a state that usually a [[majority]] of people would have in a particular time or occasion. It is formed from things that people are convinced about. It is like a [[collected]] [[norm]]. 
 
 Mindset can also be about how people see their abilities. In this sense, people have two types of mindsets: fixed and growth mindsets. Psychologist Carol Dweck explains that students with fixed mindset believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed characteristics . They have a certain amount and they improve, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and working hard. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.
