[[File:Stubbly face.jpg|thumb|[[male]] chin]] 
 
 The '''chin''' is the bottom part of the face. It is under the [[mouth]] and is the forward part of the [[jaw]]. 
 
 The chin is unique to present-day humans, our [[species]]. It is not present in the [[ape|anthropoid apes]], nor in any other [[hominin]]. < ref > Ichim, Ionut; Kieser, Jules  &  Swain, Michael 2007. Tongue contractions during speech may have led to the development of the bony geometry of the chin following the [[evolution]] of human [[language]]: a mechanobiological hypothesis for the development of the human chin.

 Its absence in ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' is grounds for thinking that small hominin was not of our species. < ref > Hogenboom, Melissa 2016. Mystery ancient hobbit was not human. ''BBC News'' Earth. [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160217-ancient-hobbit-was-not-human] < /ref > 
 
 It is thought that our chin may have become shaped like this to improve the muscle attachments of the [[lips]] and [[tongue]]. Chins can be larger or smaller, depending on the person. Even though chin sizes vary a lot, it is usually further forward than the rest of the face in normal [[human]]s.
