 Hypospermia is a male condition where individuals consistently produce an abnormally low volume of [[semen]] when ejaculating. The [[World Health Organization]] recognizes the condition of Hypospermia when less than 1.5 ml of semen is produced during a single ejaculation. 
 
 Hypospermia itself does not cause severe [[infertility]] problems. However, combination of hypospermia with oligoozoospermia (low sperm count in semen) negatively affects the chance to conceive naturally.
