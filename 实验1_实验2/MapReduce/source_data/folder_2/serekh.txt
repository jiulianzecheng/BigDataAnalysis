A '''serekh''' was an important type of [[Heraldry|heraldic crest]] used in [[Ancient Egypt]].

 Serekhs, particularly those found throughout Egyptian history, are typically composed of three components: a recessed or niched façade, the king’s name inscribed in a panel, and a falcon. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Alexandra A.|last2=O'Brien|first2=Alexandra|date=1996|title=The Serekh as an Aspect of the Iconography of Early Kingship|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40000610|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|volume=33|pages=123–138|doi=10.2307/40000610|jstor=40000610|issn=0065-9991}} < /ref >  While both the façade and name depictions are consistent in history, during a portion of Egyptian history there appears variety among the animal incarnation specified. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This can be seen by the falcon being presented singularly, joined alongside a Seth [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]], completely replaced by the Seth, or absent of both. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Prominent examples include the mid-Dynasty II’s ruler Peribsen whose serekh exclusively displays the [[Set (deity)|Seth]] animal and his predecessor, Khasekhemwy, whose serekh joins both [[Horus|falcon]] and Seth animal. < ref > Emery, Walter Brian. 1961.

 Dissecting these components, it appears each element serves a purpose in its iconography of kingship. The recessed or niched façade, which appears at the bottom of the serekh, is often considered associated with the king’s ownership of large building such as a palace or tomb. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This rendition would serve both to certify the king’s authority but also to acknowledge his possession of wealth. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  The panel, which exists between the niched façade and the falcon, is observed as the space where the king’s name is written. It’s underlying purpose is often debated, however, some claim it to be an allusion to early architectural elements such as the [[:en:False_door|false doors]] in many pharaonic tombs. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Frankfort|first=H.|date=October 1941|title=The Origin of Monumental Architecture in Egypt|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/370617|journal=The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures|volume=58|issue=4|pages=329–358|doi=10.1086/370617|s2cid=170226222|issn=1062-0516}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  On top of this panel, as stated earlier, is often a falcon denoting the god [[Horus]]. Horus’s presence in the serekh suggests the name inscribed in the panel as being the king’s [[Horus]] name, but the god’s association with kingship often lends credibility to the monarch. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite book|title=Egyptian Grammar|last=Gardiner|first=Sir Alan H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1957|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=496}} < /ref >  Both the Seth and Horus animals can be shown wearing a red, white, or double crown of Egypt and in some instances, appear in control of weapons. Such personification indicates the larger role played by the serekh, and potentially the use of the animal god as a representation of the king. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  The king himself would often be known to contain or exemplify the ‘Ka’ of Horus, which was the internal spirit that was later removed following the kings death and transitioned to fill that of the succeeding king. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Faulkner|first=R.

This relationship between the king’s Ka and the Horus god in royal serekh’s can be traced to many of the earliest texts and coalesce with the development of early writing. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > Quirke, Stephen. 1990.

 The name depicted in the panel is denoted as the king’s Horus name- in the case that the Horus animal is depicted- and is a tribute to the belief that kings were considered son of the god [[Osiris]] and therefore a semi-divine earthly representation of Horus. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This name, which is one of [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|five great names]], is further argued to be the king’s [[Ka]] name. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > {{Cite book|title=Aspects of the cult of the deified Tutankhamun.|last=Bell|first=Lanny|publisher=Melanges Gamal Eddin Mokhta|year=1985|isbn=|location=Cairo|pages=|oclc=469272353}} < /ref >  The characterization of the Horus falcon also provides a means of dating serekhs and further identifying their owner.

 The word  " serekh "  comes from the Egyptian word for  " [[facade]] " . There are many different serekhs on different types of objects. Many different decorations and details of the facade are shown in many different examples. It seems that there were no strict rules for the design of the serekh. < ref name= " JvB " > Jürgen von Beckerath: ''Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen''. Münchner Ägyptologische Studien. Bd. 49.

 A serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the [[pharaoh]]. They have been found as far back as the predynastic Naqada II ([[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]]) period (ca. 3400 BC.). The [[hieroglyph]]s forming the king's name were placed inside a rectangular area above the serekh. From the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] period onward, the word serekh appears in old papyri. < ref name= " JvB "  / > < ref name= " RGH "  / > < ref name= " TAW "  / > 
 
 A serekh was not only important in validating the authority of the king during his time of rule, but it subsequently allowed fallen kings to maintain a legacy long after death. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  In the time of ancient Egypt this was especially important as the adoption of a name signified the beginning of one’s existence. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Egypt|url=https://archive.org/details/godssymbolsofanc0000lurk|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|publisher=Thames  &  Hudson|year=1980|isbn=|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/godssymbolsofanc0000lurk/page/107 107]}} < /ref >  This connection between name and existence was so well established that often it was not uncommon for the serekh of a royal to stand in his place. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This is captured by the many serekhs exhibiting arms and hands attached to either the falcon animal or the panel element wielding weapons or holding captives. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This personification of serekhs suggests an active participance in its surroundings and therefore its role as embodiment of the inscribed king. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This anthropomorphizing of glyphs and symbolic images, such as the catfish glyph on an ivory cylinder of Narmer which epitomizes the duality of function, continues throughout Egyptian history and can be seen in a variety of contexts. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > Dochniak, Craig C. 1991.

 Given the predominant usage of serekhs in the identification of kingship, especially preceding Dynasty IV, the presence of such also serve to demonstrate Egyptian presence in foreign areas. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Inscribed serekhs into natural stone sites provide compelling evidence of travel or expansion of Egyptian populations into such areas. < ref name= " :3 "  / >

 Serekh’s appear on a variety of surface throughout history, progressing alongside the material industry current at the time. Most noticeably appearing on statues and landmarks, they also sit on the likes of many less elaborate medium such as rock or pots. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref > Kaplony, Peter. 1963.
