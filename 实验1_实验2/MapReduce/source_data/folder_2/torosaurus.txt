 '''''Torosaurus''''' (meaning  " pierced lizard " ) was a large, quadrupedal, plant-eating [[Ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] with three horns on its large head. ''Torosaurus'' hatched from eggs and may have lived in herds. 
 
 ''Torosaurus'' lived during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 & ndash;65 million years ago, in what is now western [[North America]]. It was similar to ''[[Triceratops]]''. Some had thought that ''Triceratops'' was a younger form of ''Torosaurus''. < ref name=scannella & horner2010 > Scannella J. and Horner J.R. 2010.

 However, latest thinking is that the two are definitely different [[genera]]. < ref > Bowdler, Neil 2012. BBC News Science  &  Environment. ''Triceratops and Torosaurus dinosaurs 'two species, not one''' [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17192624] < /ref >  In 2011, 2012 and 2013, studies of external features of known specimens decided that shape and development differences mean the two genera are not [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]. The main problems in the  " one genus "  idea are:  < ref name= " richyrich " >  Longrich N.R  &  Field D.J. 2012.

 #A lack of good transitional forms,  
 #The apparent existence of authentic ''Torosaurus'' subadults, different skull proportions independent of maturation  
 #The hole formation at an adult stage is not part of a normal ceratopsian growth sequence.
