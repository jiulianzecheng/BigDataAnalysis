 A '''switch''' is something that changes the [[flux|flow]] of an [[electrical circuit]]. The most common kind of '''switch''' is something (for example a [[railroad switch]]) which can be taken off of one course and put onto another. The term  " switch "  usually means [[electricity|electrical]] power. In applications where more than one switch is needed, (i.e. a [[telephone]] service) mechanical switches have been replaced by electronic switches which can be controlled automatically. 
 
 The switch is called a  " [[logic gate|gate]] "  when used in a [[mathematics|mathematical]] form. In [[logic]], [[argument]]s are represented as [[logic gate]]s. The use of electronic ''gates'' to work as a system of logical gates is the basic idea behind the [[computer]] â€”i.e. a computer is a lot of electronic switches that work as [[logic gate]]s.

 The word 'switch' can also mean to change between two things. For example, on a [[railway]] line, sometimes the track can split into two different tracks. If the train is travelling on one line and changes over to the other, it has just done a switch.
