 '''Betelgeuse''' (from Arabic: إبط الجوزاء Ibṭ al-Jauzā’, meaning  " the armpit of Orion " ) is a large red [[supergiant]] [[star]] in the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] [[constellation]]. It is usually the [[List of brightest stars|ninth-brightest]] [[star]] in the night sky, and the second-brightest in Orion. 
 
 Betelgeuse is a semiregular [[variable star]] whose [[apparent magnitude]] varies between 0.2 and 1.2. < ref > Davis, Kate (AAVSO Technical Assistant, Web) 2000. Variable star of the month: Alpha Orionis. ''American Association of Variable Star Observers'' (AAVSO). [http://www.aavso.org/vsots_alphaori] < /ref >  This is the widest range of any [[luminosity#Magnitude|first-magnitude star]]. 
 
 It is also one of the largest and most [[luminosity#Astronomy|luminous]] observable stars. It has a radius between around 640 times wider than the [[Sun]]'s [[Solar radius|radius]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Mittag|first=M.|last2=Schröder|first2=K.-P.|last3=Perdelwitz|first3=V.|last4=Jack|first4=D.|last5=Schmitt|first5=J.

Betelgeuse was the first star other than the Sun whose size was known.

 Betelgeuse is less than 10 million years old. It evolves rapidly because of its high [[mass]]. < ref > Levesque E.M. 2010. The physical properties of red supergiants. ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific''. 425 Hot and Cool: Bridging Gaps in Massive Star Evolution ASP Conference Series: '''103'''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4720] < /ref >  It is moving through the [[interstellar medium]] at a speed of 30 & nbsp;km/s, creating a [[shock wave]] over 4 light-years wide. 
 
 Betelgeuse is now in a later stage of [[stellar evolution]]. It will rapidly go through its life cycle before exploding as a [[type II supernova]] sometime in the next million years. Betelgeuse was once a yellow supergiant, which was observed by humans thousands of years ago. < ref name= " color " / > 
 
 An observation by the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] in January 2013 showed that the star's winds are crashing against the surrounding interstellar medium. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Betelgeuse_braces_for_a_collision |title=Betelgeuse braces for a collision |publisher=ESA |date=2013-01-22 |access-date=2013-01-23 }} < /ref > 
 Betelgeuse is one of the [[red supergiant star]]s to have a [[bow shock]]:  others are [[Mu Cephei]] and [[IRC-10414]]. Betelgeuse can be seen at the upper left  in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].
