 '''Breakbeat''' (literally break beat as to interrupt a beat) (also called '''breaks''' or '''breakbeats''') refers to two things. It is both an [[electronic music|electronic]] [[music genre]] and the distinct [[percussion instrument|percussive]] [[rhythm]] from which this [[genre]] takes its name. 
 
 ==Early history== 
 As a musical device, breakbeats have been known and used for almost a hundred years. The name and modern meaning of the term traces its origins to the rise of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in the [[United States]] during the 1980s. The [[electronic]] [[music]] genre is widely regarded as coming from the [[United Kingdom]]'s early rave music. Breakbeats were added to the music to form what became known as [[breakbeat hardcore]]. However, breakbeats had been used by American hip hop [[DJ]]s and [[turntablism|turntablists]] in instrumental sets well before the advent of [[rave]] in the UK. It could be argued that the two scenes developed in parallel. 
 
 Today, breakbeat lives on in the form of strong regional scenes in the US and UK. Breakbeats are [[frequent]]ly used in the production of such diverse music genres as [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Drum and bass|jungle or drum and bass]], [[hardcore techno|hardcore]], [[UK garage]] (including [[2-step garage|2-step]], [[breakstep]] and [[dubstep]]). Since the 1990s, breakbeat has been used as background music to [[television advertisement|TV adverts]]. It also has been used in [[action film]] [[soundtrack]]s. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The most likely origin of the word  " breakbeat "  is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a  " [[break (music)|break]] "  in the music. a 
 
 In the early 1990s, [[acid house]] artists and producers started using breakbeat [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in their music to create [[breakbeat hardcore]]. This was also called[[rave music]].  < ref > {{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Gideon|title=Breakbeat Hardcore - Your Ultimate Guide|url=http://www.coremagonline.com/features/breakbeat-hardcore-your-ultimate-guide.html|publisher=Core Magazine|access-date=12 April 2014|archive-date=16 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316135548/http://www.coremagonline.com/features/breakbeat-hardcore-your-ultimate-guide.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The hardcore scene then diverged into sub-genres like [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], which generally had a darker sound and focused more on complex sampled drum patterns. An example of this is [[Goldie]]'s album ''[[Timeless (Goldie album)|Timeless]]''.

 ==Evolution== 
 In the 1980s, breakbeat became an essential feature of many genres of breaks music which became popular within the global dance music scene, including [[big beat]], [[nu skool breaks]], [[acid breaks]] and [[Miami bass]]. 
 
 DJs from a variety of genres work breaks tracks into their sets. This may occur because the [[tempo]] of breaks tracks (ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute) means they can be readily mixed with these genres. 
 
 Some artists well known for breakbeat include [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Whodini]], [[Davy DMX]], [[Deekline]], [[Dynamix II]], [[2 Live Crew]], [[Cybotron (band)|Cybotron]], [[Nubreed]], [[Hybrid (Welsh band)|Hybrid]], [[Phil K]], [[Dirty Harry]], [[NAPT (electronic music artist)|NAPT]], [[DJ Icey]], [[Stanton Warriors]], [http://freqnasty.com/ FreQ Nasty], [[Krafty Kuts]], [[Freestylers]], [[K-Swing]], [[Soul Of Man]], [[DJ Sharaz]], [[Annie Nightingale]] and performance troupe [[Lucent Dossier Experience]].

 ===The  " Amen Break " === 
 The [[Amen Break]], a drum break from [[The Winstons]]' song  " Amen, Brother "  is widely regarded as one of the most widely used and sampled breaks among music using breakbeats. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://blog.whosampled.com/2010/04/29/the-10-most-sampled-breakbeats-of-all-time/ |title=10 Most Sampled Breakbeats |publisher=blog.whosampled.com}} < /ref >   This break was first used on  " King of the Beats "  by [[Mantronix]], and has since been used in thousands of songs. < ref name='econ20111217'/ >  Other popular breaks are from [[James Brown]]'s ''[[Funky Drummer]]'' (1970) and ''Give it Up or Turnit a Loose'', [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]'s 1973 cover of [[The Shadows]]'  " [[Apache (instrumental)|Apache]] " , and [[Lyn Collins]]' 1972 song  " [[Think (About It)]] " . < ref > ''Modulations: A History of Electronic Music'', ed.

 ===Legal issues=== 
 With the rise in popularity of breakbeat music and the advent of digital audio samplers, enterprising companies started selling  " breakbeat packages "  for the express purpose of helping artists create breakbeats. A breakbeat kit CD would contain many breakbeat samples from different songs and artists, often without the artist's permission or even knowledge. One example of this is the [[Amen Break]], from a song by [[The Winstons]], who hold the copyright. However, a company named [[Zero-G Limited]] released a  " jungle construction kit "  containing hundreds of audio samples. One appeared to be an exact copy of the Amen break. It was slightly sped up. Zero-G Limited claimed copyright since a copyright symbol was included on the product's packaging. However, when it came to Zero-G Limited's notice that there may be another claim on the copyright of the audio sample in question, they removed it from the product. The Winstons have not received [[royalties]] for third-party use of samples of the break recorded on their original music release. < ref name='econ20111217' > {{cite news | title = Musical history: Seven seconds of fire | date = 2011-12-17 | publisher = The Economist Newspaper Limited | url = http://www.economist.com/node/21541707 | work = The Economist | access-date = 2011-12-28}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Subgenres== 
 ===Big beat=== 
 {{Main|Big beat}} 
 '''Big beat''' is a term employed since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe much of the music by artists such as [[The Prodigy]], [[Cut La Roc]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[The Crystal Method]] and [[Propellerheads]].  
 
 ===Acid breaks=== 
 In [[electronic music]],  " acid breaks "  is a [[fusion]] between breakbeat, and other forms of [[electronic dance music]] Its drum line usually mimics most breakbeat music, but lacks the distinctive [[kick drum]] of other forms of EDM. One of the earliest synthesizers to be employed in acid music was the [[Roland TB-303]].  
 
 In more recent times, artists such as Champion Breaks have started a [[resurgence]] of this sound, using mainly [[Amen break]]s, [[Kevin Saunderson|Reese bass]], and [[Roland TB-303|303 acid lines]] to create energetic, and sometimes frenetic acid breaks songs.
