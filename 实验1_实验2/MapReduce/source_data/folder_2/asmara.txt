 '''Asmara''' is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Eritrea]]. It is the largest [[Human settlement|settlement]] in the [[country]]. Asmara has a [[population]] of about 579,000 people. [[Textile]]s and [[clothing]], [[meat]], [[beer]], [[shoe]]s, and [[ceramics]] are the major [[industry|industrial]] products of the city. 
 
 == History == 
 Asmara grew from four [[village]]s [[:wikt:found|founded]] in the [[12th century|twelfth century]]. It is said that there were four [[Clan|clans]] living in the Asmara area. The women of these tribes told them men to join together to fight [[thief|bandits]] who had been [[wikt:attack|attacking]] the area.  After they defeated the bandits, a new name was given to the place, ''Arbaete Asmara''. This name, in the [[Tigrinya language]], meant ''the four females united''. ''Arbaete'' was later dropped and the name was made Asmara.

 In 1889, Asmara became an [[Italy|Italian]] [[colony]]. It was made the capital of the country in 1897 and was called ''[[Piccola Roma|Asmara italiana]]''. The city was [[wikt:damage|damaged]] during [[earthquake]]s in 1913 and 1915. During the [[1930s]], the Italians made many chances to how Asmara looked. Many new [[building]]s were created during this time and the city was mainly populated by Italian colonists (in 1940 there were 57000 Italian residents on a total population of 98000). < ref > [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7mXuju-Fi5YJ:https://www.rivista-incontri.nl/articles/10.18352/incontri.9143/galley/9551/download/+ & cd=18 & hl=it & ct=clnk & gl=us Asmara colonia italiana e oltre (in Italian)] < /ref > 
 
 These buildings were built in the same [[wikt:style|style]] as Italian buildings. This gave Asmara the look of an Italian city. Today many of the buildings and [[Shop|stores]] in Asmara still have [[Italian language|Italian]] names. 
 
 During [[World War II]], after the defeat of Italy in [[Africa]], Asmara was under [[United Kingdom|British]] rule. In 1952, the [[United Nations]] placed the country and Asmara under [[Ethiopia]]n control. In the [[1960s]], the Eritrean people started fighting for [[independence]] from Ethiopia. 
 
 This bloody [[war]] lasted until 1991. Asmara was given back to the Eritrean people on May 24, 1991. 
 
 In July 2017 Asmara has been declared ''World Heritage Site'' by the [[UNESCO]]. 
 
 {{Quote|''Asmara is a new addition  (since July 2017) to the UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, under the direction of the  " Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Project " , for its outstanding examples of 20th century architecture and town planning when was called 'Asmara italiana'........Asmara, a village that became the capital in 1891, still conserves an almost intact urban structure and architectural features from its half century of colonialism. The first expansion of Asmara was regulated by a scheme plan, approved in 1902, which included the area to the East of the original military outpost on the Mai Belà river. The grid pattern was marked by two major arteries, parallel to each other: the King’s Way (il Corso del Re) and the Queen’s Avenue (il Viale della Regina). After the space of a decade, Cavagnari’s plan was the first to separate the European settlement from the indigenous zone. The advent of Fascism did not have an immediate impact in Eritrea; by then the capital had developed a well-integrated population. One is continuously surprised by testimonies of the residents in Asmara in the Thirties, which express a state of mind shared by both colonizers and colonized, describing the city as: ‘beautiful [...] inhabited by a mixed race, Italians and Africans ... a lot of traffic, shops, cinemas and restaurants...’ . It is commonplace to refer to ‘good Italian people’ (italiani brava gente), which is a most difficult viewpoint to abandon, and is also a most relevant perspective when considering the architectural patrimony of Asmara as a shared heritage.''
