 The '''Palmengarten''' is one of two [[botanical garden]]s in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].  It is in the [[city district|city area]] [[Westend-Süd (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend-Nord]]. 
 
 The garden was privately [[financed|paid for]] and built by the [[architect]] [[Heinrich Siesmayer]].  Work was done in 1871 and the garden opened to the public. One special visit was from the American [[entertainer]] [[Buffalo Bill]].  Buffalo Bill performed his Western show at the garden in 1890. In 1931, it was placed in the care of the city of Frankfurt.  Control of the  garden was later moved to the [[American occupation|American occupation authorities]] after [[World War II]].  When the Palmengarten was returned to the city's control in the 1960s, a major rebuilding started. The halls that were destroyed in the war were [[renovation|redeveloped and expanded]]. In 1992, the reconstruction finished and the Palmengarten showed in its new form. 
 
 Next to the area of the Palmengarten is the [[Frankfurt Botanical Garden]], which belongs to the [[biology]] department of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt]]. 
 
 The botanical exhibits are placed according to their start in free-air or climate controlled [[greenhouse]]s, which also contain many [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] plants. 
 
 With {{convert|29|ha}}, it is the biggest garden of its kind in Germany.
