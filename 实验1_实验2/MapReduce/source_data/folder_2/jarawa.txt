The tribes of the [[Andaman Islands]] – the Jarawa, Great Andamanese, [[Onge]] and [[Sentinelese]] – are believed to have lived in their Indian Ocean home for up to 55,000 years. 
 
 They are now vastly outnumbered by several hundred thousand [[Indian people|Indians]], who have settled on the islands in recent decades. 
 
 Today, approximately 400 members of the nomadic Jarawa tribe live in groups of 40-50 people in chaddhas – as they call their homes. 
 
 Like most tribal peoples who live self-sufficiently on their ancestral lands, the Jarawa continue to thrive, and their numbers are steadily growing. 
 
 They hunt pig and [[turtle]] and fish with bows and arrows in the coral-fringed reefs for crabs and fish, including striped catfish-eel and the toothed [[pony fish.]] They also gather fruits, wild roots, tubers and honey. The bows are made from the chooi wood, which does not grow throughout the Jarawa territory. The Jarawa often have to travel long distances to [[Baratang Island]] to collect it. 
 
 Both Jarawa men and women collect wild honey from lofty trees. During the honey collection the members of the group will sing songs to express their delight. The honey-collector will chew the sap of leaves of a bee-repellant plant, such as [[Ooyekwalin]], which they will then spray with their mouths at the bees to keep them away. Once the bees have gone the Jarawa can cut the bee’s nest, which they will put in a wooden bucket on their back. The Jarawa always bathe after consuming honey.A study of their nutrition and health found their ‘nutritional status’ was ‘optimal’. They have detailed knowledge of more than 150 plant and 350 animal species.
