 '''Mail''' is part of the '''postal system'''. The postal system is a [[wikt:system|system]] where [[writing|written]] [[wikt:document|document]]s and small to medium [[package]]s are sent (delivered) to places around the [[earth|world]]. Anything sent through the postal system is called mail or '''post'''. 
 
 A postal [[wikt:service|service]] can be private or public.  [[Government]]s often make rules about private postal delivery systems. Since the early 19th century, most [[national]] postal systems have been controlled entirely by governments.  The governments make people pay a [[fee]] to send something.  This fee is usually in the form of [[stamp]]s.  Some governments only let private postal services deliver parcel (non-mail) packages. 
 
 Postal systems often do things other than sending [[letter]]s. In some [[country|countries]], the postal system is also in charge of [[telephone]] and [[telegraph]] systems. The postal systems in other countries can help people apply for government papers such as [[passport]]s and [[driver's license]]s. Many places the post offices also work like [[bank]]s. This is so that people can take out money or pay bills at a nearby [[post office]], instead of travelling to a big bank in the nearest town. 
 
 People drop letters in a [[post box]] to be collected and delivered by the post office.
