 The '''diaphragm''' is a [[muscle]] that is at the bottom of the [[rib]]cage of [[mammal]]s. 
 
 ==What it does== 
 When breathing in, the diaphragm pulls down so that the size of the [[lung]]s increases, allowing air to enter the lungs. 
 When breathing out, the diaphragm rests and goes up making a [[dome]] shape, decreasing the size of the lungs and pushing [[air]] out. 
 This increases the surface area of the air so that there is more oxygen that the lungs can hold.
