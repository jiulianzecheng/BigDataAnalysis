 A '''cart''' is a [[vehicle]] with two [[wheel]]s and usually pulled by one [[horse]].  Other animals such as [[ox]], [[cattle]] or [[donkey]]s are sometimes used instead of a horse. A '''handcart''' is pulled or pushed by a person. 
 
 Carts have been used for over 4,000 years around the world. Today we use the [[shopping cart]]. Shopping carts first made their appearance in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] in 1937.
