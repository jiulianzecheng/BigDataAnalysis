 '''Vermont''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[United States]]. Its [[Capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], and its largest [[city]] is [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]. It is one of the six [[New England]] states. About 640,000 people lived there in 2020. 
 
 The states that border Vermont are [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]] to the north. 
 
 Vermont was home to the [[Abenaki]] and [[Iroquois]] [[Native American]] groups until [[France]] took control of the area when it was building colonies. [[Great Britain]] gained control after winning the [[French and Indian War]]. It is known for being one of only four states to be an independent nation before joining the [[United States]]. It was not a part of the 13 colonies, as it joined as the 14th state. Vermont became a state in 1791. It is world-renowned for its [[maple syrup]] industry, and many tourists go to see brilliant colors the trees become in the fall months. The tourism industry has become quite successful, with many tourists coming every year.
