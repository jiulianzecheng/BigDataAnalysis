 A '''desmosome''' is a cell structure for cell-to-cell [[adhesion]]. They are localized spot-like adhesions on the outer sides of [[plasma membrane]]s. < ref name= " riger " > R. Rieger; A.

 Desmosomes help to keep cells together in a sheet.  They are found in [[epithelium|epithelial tissue]], like multilayer [[squamous epithelium]].  The intercellular space is relatively wide up to about 30 & nbsp;nm. < ref name= " Alberts " > Bruce Alberts ''et al'' 2002.
