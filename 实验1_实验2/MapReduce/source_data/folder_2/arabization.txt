 '''Arabisation''' (or '''Arabization''') is a process where the influence of [[Arab people|Arabic populations]] grows in an area. This will mean that the Arab ways of doing things will replace other ways over time. It will also mean that the [[Arabic language|Arabic lanuage]] will become more important. Usually, this will also mean that [[Islam]] will spread in the area. Non-Arabic populations will be [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] over time (or leave the area altogether). 
 
 Examples where Arabization happened are the south of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], called [[Mozarabs]]), in the [[Middle Ages]] (undone by the [[Reconquista]]). In the [[Maghreb|Mahgreb]], Arabization drove away many [[Berber people]]. Arabization also happened in the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]].  
 
 In [[Sudan]] and other parts of [[East Africa]], Arabization also took place. In those areas, it was driven by [[trade]].
