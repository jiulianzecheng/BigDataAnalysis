 The '''Pleuronectidae''' are a family of [[flatfish]] that are widely known as '''righteye flounders'''. The reason why they're called like that is because most species lie on the [[seabed]] on their left sides, with both eyes on their right sides. Only a few species can also have their eyes on the left side. Females lay eggs that float in mid-water until the larvae develop, and they sink to the bottom. 
 
 They are found on the bottoms of oceans around the world. The name of the family is derived from the [[Greek]] πλευρά (''pleura''), meaning  " rib "  or  " side " , and νηκτόν (''nekton''), meaning  " swimming " .
