A '''shack''' is a makeshift and often rundown [[building]] often made of [[wood]] or [[corrugated metal]]. Shacks seldomly have [[electricity]] or [[plumbing]] and are typically used either for cheap (often illegal) [[housing]] for those too poor to afford anything better, as [[outbuilding]]s (like storage [[shed]]s) or as an alternative to [[tent]]s when [[camping]].
