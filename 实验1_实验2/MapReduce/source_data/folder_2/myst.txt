 '''''Myst''''' is a [[computer game]] designed by the brothers [[Robyn Miller|Robyn]] and [[Rand Miller]] in a company called [[Cyan, Inc.|Cyan]]. The Millers started working on Myst in [[1991]] and released it for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computer on September 24, 1993. ''Myst'' was later released on many different [[computer|computers]] and [[video game console|video game consoles]]. 
 
 In ''Myst'', the player starts by using a special book to travel to Myst Island. There, the player uses other special books to travel to different worlds called  " Ages " . Solving puzzles on different Ages helps the player learn more about Myst Island and the people who live there. The player can make choices that change the ending of the game. 
 
 When ''Myst'' was released, it became very popular. [[Critic|Critics]] loved ''Myst'' because it felt like a real world. ''Myst'' was the best-selling computer game until [[The Sims]] was released in [[2002]]. ''Myst'' helped the [[CD-ROM]] get more popular when the CD-ROM was new. Because ''Myst'' was so popular, four [[Sequel|sequels]] were made, and three ''Myst'' [[Novel|novels]] were written.
