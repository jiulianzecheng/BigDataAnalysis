 '''Antarctica''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[wikt:southern|southernmost]] [[continent]]. It is on the [[South Pole]]. It is almost entirely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]. Around Antarctica is the [[Southern Ocean]]. It is the fifth-largest continent in area after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. < ref > 14.0 million km < sup > 2 < /sup > & nbsp; 5.4 million & nbsp;sq & nbsp;mi, < /ref >  About 99% of Antarctica is covered by ice. This ice averages at least 1.6 [[kilometers]] (1.0 & nbsp;miles) thick. 
 
 Antarctica is the coldest, driest and [[wind]]iest continent. It is also, on average, the highest of all the continents. < ref > {{cite web | title=National Geophysical Data Center | publisher=National Satellite, Data, and Information Service | url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/relief_slides2.html | accessdate=9 June 2006 | archive-date=15 June 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195737/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/relief_slides2.html | url-status=live }} Choose the South Pole view. < /ref >  Antarctica is considered a [[desert]]. < ref name= " Campbell " > Campbell I.B. and Claridge G.G.C. 1987.

However, about 1,000 to 5,000 people live through the year at the [[science]] stations in Antarctica. Only plants and animals that can live in cold live there. The animals include [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[nematode]]s, [[tardigrade]]s and [[mite]]s. Plant life includes some [[grass]] and [[shrub]]s, [[algae]], [[lichen]], [[fungi]], and [[bacteria]]. 
 
 The first known polar sighting of the continent was in 1820. Antarctica was mostly forgotten for the rest of the 19th century. This was because of its [[wikt:hostile|incredibly hostile]] [[environment]], few [[wikt:resource|resources]], and [[wikt:isolation|isolation]]. The first official use of the name ''Antarctica'' as a continental name in the 1890s is said to have been used by Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]]. 
 
 The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in 1959 by 21 countries. More countries have signed the treaty since then. So far, 46 countries have signed the treaty. The treaty declares that [[military]] activities and [[mineral]] [[mining]] are against the law. However, it supports [[science|scientific]] research. It also helps the continent's [[ecozone|ozone]]. More than 4,000 scientists from different nations and different interests experiment together. < ref name= " cia " > {{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#People|title=Antarctica - The World Factbook|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-03-14|archive-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225211652/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html%20#People|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 Antarctica is covered by an [[ice sheet]] about four kilometers thick. Under the ice it is mostly land, although the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] are glossing over the ocean.  The Trans antarctic Mountains divide the land between [[East Antarctica]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] and [[West Antarctica ]]in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Scientists say Antarctica used to be much farther from north and much warmer, moving to where it is now through [[continental drift]]. < ref name= " Wpost " > {{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/03/21/antarctica-bones-give-evidence-of-continental-drift/d9188847-8ee9-4215-8c3c-37036ce93bc9/|title=Antarctica Bones Give Evidence of Continental Drift |author=Philip J.

 == Life in Antarctica == 
 [[File:Adelie chicks in antarctica and Ms Explorer.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie Penguin]] chicks in Antarctica, with [[MS Explorer|MS ''Explorer'']] and an [[iceberg]] in the background.]] 
 
 === Plants === 
 Few [[Embryophyte|land plants]] grow in Antarctica. This is because Antarctica does not have much moisture (water), [[sunlight]], good [[soil]], or a warm temperature. Plants usually only grow for a few weeks in the summer when penguins produce the most feces. However, [[moss]], [[lichen]] and [[algae]] do grow.  The most important organisms in Antarctica are the [[plankton]] which grow in the ocean. < ref name=lifepac/ > 
 
 === Animals === 
 One important source of food in the Antarctic is the [[krill]], which is a general term for the small shrimp-like [[Marine biology|marine]] [[crustacea]]ns. Krill are  near the bottom of the [[food chain]]: they feed on [[phytoplankton]] and to a lesser extent [[zooplankton]]. Krill are a food form suitable for the larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet.  [[Whale]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], and even some of the [[bird]]s that live in Antarctica, all depend on krill. 
 
 Whales are the largest animals in the ocean, and in Antarctica. They are [[mammal]]s, not [[fish]]. That means that they breathe [[air]] and do not lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. Many different kinds of whales live in the oceans around Antarctica.  
 [[Whaler]]s have hunted whales for hundreds of years, for [[meat]] and [[blubber]].  Nowadays most whaling is done in the Antarctic area. 
 
 [[Penguin]]s only live south of the [[equator]]. Several different kinds live in and around Antarctica. The biggest ones can stand nearly 4 feet (1.2m) tall and can weigh almost 100 pounds (40 & nbsp;kg). The smallest kinds are only about one foot (30 & nbsp;cm) tall. Penguins are large birds that swim very well but cannot fly. They have [[black]] backs and wings with [[white]] fronts.  Their [[feather]]s are very tightly packed and make a thick cover.  They also have a layer of woolly [[down]] under the feathers.  The feathers themselves are coated with a type of oil that makes them [[wikt:waterproof|waterproof]]. < ref name=lifepac/ >    A thick layer of blubber also keeps them warm.  Penguins eat fish and are at home in the ocean.  They come up on the land or ice to lay their eggs and raise the chicks.  They nest together in a huge group.

 == History of its discovery ==

 [[File:Europe antarctica size.png|thumb|right|230px|Antarctica is bigger than Europe]] 
 
 For a long time, people had believed that there was a great continent in the far south of Earth. They thought this ''Terra Astral-is'' would  " balance "  the lands in the north like [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]. People have believed this from [[The Times|the times]] of [[Ptolemy]] (1st century AD). He suggested this idea to keep the balance of all known lands in the world. Pictures of a large land in the south were common in maps. In the late 17th century, people discovered that South America and Australia were not part of the [[myth]]ical  " Antarctica " . However, [[geography|geographers]] still believed that Antarctica was much bigger than it really was. 
 
 European maps continued to show this unknown land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, HMS ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure'', first crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 17 January 1773. < ref name= " mariner " > {{cite web|author=The Mariners' Museum|title=Age of Exploration: John Cook|url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php|accessdate=12 February 2006|archive-date=7 February 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207175624/http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php|url-status=live}} < /ref >  In fact, he did come within about {{convert|75|mi|km}} of the Antarctic [[wikt:coast|coast]].

The three ships were captained by Fabian von Bellingham (a captain in the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]), Edward Mansfield (a captain in the [[Royal Navy]]), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American seal hunter out of Stonington, [[Connecticut]]). The first recorded landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]]. He landed on West Antarctica on 7 February 1821. However, some [[history|historians]] are not sure about this claim. 
 
 People began discovering different parts of Antarctica and mapping them. This was slow work because they could only work in the summer. < ref name=lifepac/ >  At last a map was made, and people began to talk about exploring the land, not only the sea. < ref name=lifepac/ >  However, this would have been very hard work. They would have to break through the ice that was around Antarctica. Then they would have to land on it and bring in enough things to live on while they explored the land. 
 
 The first serious exploration of the Antarctic land was the [[Nimrod Expedition]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]] in 1907‚Äì09. They were the first to climb [[Mount Erebus]] and to reach the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908 ‚Äì February 1909. They were the first humans to cross the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], and the Trans-antarctic Mountain Range (via the [[Beardmore Glacier]]). They were the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. 
 
 [[Robert Falcon Scott]], the most well known of all of the explorers, < ref name=lifepac/ >  wanted to be the first man to reach the South Pole. At the same time, another team from [[Norway]] lead by [[Roald Amundsen]] started. They both raced each other to the South Pole, but in the end Amundsen won because he had made a good use of his sleigh dogs. Scott had used ponies and motor sleds, but when he got to the South Pole he found a message from Amundsen, showing that he had beaten Scott. 
 
 On his way back, Scott and two of his men met a [[wikt:blizzard|blizzard]] and froze to death while waiting for it to finish. The people who found him eight months later also found his records and [[diary]], which he had written to the day he died. 
 
 [[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] are showing effects in Antarctica, particularly the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC & dq=climate+change+in+the+antarctic+peninsula & pg=PA255|title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic|last=Riffenburgh|first=Beau|date=2007|publisher=Taylor  &  Francis|isbn=978-0-415-97024-2|location=|pages=255|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 === People === 
 No one lives in Antarctica all the time. People who go to Antarctica are there to learn about Antarctica, so most of the people who live there are scientists. Most live at national science stations on the coast. Some bases are far from the sea, for example at the [[South pole]]. They study the [[weather]], animals, [[glacier]]s, and the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. < ref name=lifepac/ >  Some scientists [[wikt:drill|drill]] [[ice core]]s to find out about the weather long ago. People who work in the Antarctic must be careful, because a blizzard can start any time and anywhere. When they go far away from their shelter, they must always take lots of food just in case. 
 
 Today, people explore Antarctica using [[snowmobile]]s, which are faster than dogs and can pull heavier loads. Many come to Antarctica just for a short visit. There are companies in South America that have vacations to Antarctica, so people pay to go there on a ship. Some people take their own boats. < ref name=lifepac/ >
