'''Hydroflurocarbons''' (HFC) are [[chemical compound]]s made of [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]] and [[fluorine]].  
 
 They are used in [[air conditioning]] and as [[refrigerant]]s in place of the older [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s. HFC contain a hydrogen [[atom]] which cause it to decompose quickly before reaching the [[stratosphere]]. HFC do not contain chlorine which is harmful for the [[ozone layer]]. HFC survive in the [[atmosphere]] between two and forty years. [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] can stay at the atmosphere for up to 150 years.
