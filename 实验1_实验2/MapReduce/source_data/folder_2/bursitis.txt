'''Bursitis''' is a painful condition. Small sacs called bursae get inflamed. Bursae are pockets between your [[muscle]]s and your [[bone]]s. Your bursa help you move without [[pain]]. In bursitis, the inflammation is often caused by extra fluid in the bursae. The most common places to have bursitis are in your hip and shoulder. You can also have bursitis in your [[elbow]], [[knee]] and [[toe]]. < ref > " Bursitis. "  World of Health. Gale, 2007. Student Resources in Context.
