'''Fluoridation''' is the adding of [[fluorine]] compounds ([[fluoride]]s) to various substances, especially [[toothpaste]] and drinking water. Government officials, scientists, and doctors say that Fluoridation helps prevent tooth decay and cavities, but it also has harmful effects in larger doses, creating a controversy over whether water should be fluoridated.
