 '''Italophilia''' is the admiration, general appreciation or love of [[Italy]], its culture, society, arts and people. It is often related to the emulation of Italy's ideals and civilization. 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 [[File:Littleitaly worldcup.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Italophilia is very strong in the USA, mainly between the [[Italian Americans]], as can be seen even for the 2006 WorldCup celebrations of the Italian soccer team victory.]] 
 The term is used in two basic contexts: in international politics and in cultural context. 
 
 " Italophilia " ,  " Italophile " , and  " Italophilic "  are the terms used to denote pro-Italian sentiments, usually in politics and literature. 
 
 A huge italophilia started to develop in [[Europe]] during the centuries of the Italian [[Renaissance]]. 
 
 Actually one of the main reasons of Italophilia in the world is that Italy is home to more [[World Heritage Site]]s than any other nation in the world. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/|title=List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-07-24}} < /ref >  These sites are culturally important and value according to [[UNESCO]]. Indeed about 60% of the works of [[art]] of the world are in Italy. 
 
 Another reason is the worlwide appreciation for Italian culinary and foods. Italy is also a big [[wine]] producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes, and many italian wines are very famous in the world, like the  " Chianti " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Wine_production_by_country|title=Countries by wine Production|access-date=2013-05-01|archive-date=2013-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801024533/http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Wine_production_by_country|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Indeed in the American countries with a huge Italian emigration in the last centuries, there it is a widespread italophilia: [[Argentina]], [[Brasil]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] have millions of Italian descendants who promote in their society the love and appreciation for Italy. 
 
 Actually Giorgio Silvestri (director of the  " Assemblea legislativa della Liguria " ) has calculated that there are nearly 250 million italophiles in the world. < ref > [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v & q=cache:DhlV9BPrwhUJ:dalbollettinoalblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/presentazione.ppt+italofilia+in+latinoamerica & hl=it & gl=it & pid=bl & srcid=ADGEEShcf9XTvZ2sipfHj4-vlWF-LGpzbrNYCxft3NkYjUEjPE-x1yyo0-I5YCWeha11L42GBGdktvu1JRHzYXJtRoB3VqcVwhtyDC9olsdOAO8yVgMf0-itSU0ijLABRMUFJr10vKvW & sig=AHIEtbSBQMfpMVrI-L0X0FQ_SBTreRfTxg Italophilia in the world] < /ref >
