 In some rules of [[football]], a '''punt''' is a play in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it touches the ground. A punt is in contrast to a [[drop kick]], in which the ball touches the ground before being kicked. 
 
 In [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] football, the ball is kicked downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final [[down (football)|down]], with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more helpful to the kicking team when possession changes.
