'''Bioturbation''' is the reworking of [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s by animals or plants. < ref > Meysman F.J.R. ''et al''  2006. Bioturbation: a fresh look at Darwin's last idea. ''Trends in Ecology  &  Evolution''. '''21''', 12, 688-695. [http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(06)00243-6] < /ref >  It disturbs and changes [[sediment]]. Any animal living in the soil or on the bottom under water may disturb the sediment by moving it around. Burrowing, eating and defecation of sediment grains, building galleries (etc.) all disturb the sediment. 
 
 Common bioturbators include [[annelid]]s ( " ringed worms " ) such as [[oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], [[bivalve]]s like [[mussel]]s, [[clam]]s, [[gastropods]], [[holothuria]]ns.  
 
 [[Fossil]] sites with bioturbation do not leave traces of soft-bodied animals. In contrast, fossil sites with undisturbed sediment have given rise to important [[lagerst√§tten]] with many impressions of small soft-bodied [[invertebrates]].
