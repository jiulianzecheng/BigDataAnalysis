 ==History== 
 The band started out as a cover band and went by the name Fozzy Osbourne, a play on the name of the singer [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The band was assembled by Rich Ward from whatever musicians that he could find in a given week. In 1999, Ward met Jericho in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] after a wrestling show and he invited Jericho to play with the band. 
 
 In 2000, after Jericho suffered a severe ankle injury and was unable to wrestle for four moths, he rejoined the band and became their front man. He went under the persona of Moongoose McQueen. As part of the band's  " gimmick " , Jericho did not acknowledge that Moongoose McQueen and Chris Jericho were the same person. When he was interviewed as Moongoose, he stayed in character the entire time and feigned ignorance of who Chris Jericho was. On the other side, Chris Jericho was a  " huge fan "  of both Moongoose and Fozzy. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/?p=27704|access-date=2014-07-06|title=Rewind with Moongoose McQueen, 11/14/02|publisher=Metal Sludge|archive-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112072841/http://www.metalsludge.tv/?p=27704|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
