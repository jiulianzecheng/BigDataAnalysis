 A '''handkerchief''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ŋ|k|ər|tʃ|ɪ|f}}, also called a '''handkercher''' or '''hanky''', is a form of a [[kerchief]], usually made of thin [[Textile|fabric]] that can be carried in the [[pocket]] or [[Handbag|purse]]. It was invented for personal [[hygiene]] purposes such as wiping one's [[hand]]s or face, or blowing one's [[human nose|nose]].  
 
 A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in a suit pocket. 
 
 ==Modern usage== 
 The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the [[social-economic class]] of the user. It is not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and useful for those who use a handkerchief for more than style.  Handkerchiefs can be made of [[cotton]], cotton-synthetic blend, [[synthetic fabric]], [[silk]], or [[linen]]. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 Before people used the word handkerchief, the word kerchief alone was common. This term came from two French words: couvrir, which means “to cover,” and chef, which means “head.” 
 
 In the time of [[ancient Greece]] and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today. But in the [[Middle Ages]], kerchiefs were usually used to cover the head.
