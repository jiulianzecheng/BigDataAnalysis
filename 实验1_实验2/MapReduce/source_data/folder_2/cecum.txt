 The '''cecum''' is a part of the [[large intestine]]. It helps with fermenting [[dietary fiber]]. It comes before the [[colon]] and after the [[ileum]] in the [[gastrointestinal system]]. The [[appendix]] is connected to the cecum. The size of the cecum varies in [[Human|humans]] and other [[Omnivore|omnivores]] but it is large in [[Herbivore|herbivores]] and small in most [[Carnivore|carnivores]].
