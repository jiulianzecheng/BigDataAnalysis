 The '''Glaspaleis''' (English: ''Glass Palace'') is a building in [[Heerlen]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]]), built in the years 1934-1935 and serves as the cultural centre. 
 
 Most part of the building is covered with [[glass]]. It belongs to the architecture of Het Nieuwe Bouwen, a style more or less comparable to that of the [[Bauhaus]], [[Modernism]] and [[International Style]]. Architect is [[Frits Peutz]], largely responsible for reshaping Heerlen in a modern way. 
 
 The Glaspaleis is one of the top thousand buildings of the twentieth century.
