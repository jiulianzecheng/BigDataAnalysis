 A '''puteal '''is an old-fashioned structure built around the hole of a [[well]]. It is made to stop people from easily falling in. Some puteals have [[Bas-relief|bas relief]]. Some have a step that leads to the water well itself. 
 
 Puteals were decoration or part of an [[Architecture|architectural]] [[design]]. 
 
 In the big places where a lot of people walked in [[Venice]], puteals had cast-[[iron]] lids. That protected people even more and stopped the water supply from becoming dirty. 
 
 Classically, puteals were made of carved stone, or marble in Europe. They were in big private [[courtyard|courtyards]] and [[town square|town/city squares]].
