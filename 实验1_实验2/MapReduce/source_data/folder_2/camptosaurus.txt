 '''''Camptosaurus''''' (meaning  " bent lizard " ) was a [[plant]]-eater from the [[Upper Jurassic]] (about 156 to 145 million years ago). It is related to [[Iguanodon]].  
 
 It was a heavy [[ornithischia]]n [[dinosaur]] that was about 16-23 feet (5-7 m) long and 3-4 feet (1 m) high at the hips, weighing roughly 2,200 pounds (1000 kg). It had a long [[snout]], hundreds of teeth and a horny [[beak]]. Its legs were longer than its arms; it had four-toed feet and five-fingered [[arm]]s, all with hooves. It could walk on two or four [[leg]]s, it probably went on all four to graze for low-lying plants.
