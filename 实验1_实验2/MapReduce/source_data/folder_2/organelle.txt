 In [[cell biology]], an '''organelle''' is a part of a cell that does a [[wikt:specific|specific]] job. 
 
 Organelles usually have a [[plasma membrane]] around them. < ref > See 'Scope of the term' below. < /ref >  Most of the cell's organelles are in the [[cytoplasm]]. < ref > Alberts, Bruce et al. 2003. ''Essential cell biology'', 2nd ed. Garland Science. < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = National Research Council (U.S.).

 The name ''organelle'' comes from the idea that these structures are to cells what an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] is to the [[body]]. 
 
 There are many types of organelles in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells. [[Prokaryote]]s were once thought not to have organelles, but some examples have now been found. < ref name= " pref " > {{cite journal |pmid=16081736 |doi=10.1126/science.1113397 |year=2005 |author=Kerfeld C. |display-authors = etal |title=Protein structures forming the shell of primitive bacterial organelles. |volume=309 |issue=5736 |pages=936–8 |journal=Science|bibcode=2005Sci...309..936K |s2cid=24561197 }} < /ref > 
 They are not organised like eukaryote organelles, and are not bounded by plasma membranes. They are called [[bacterial microcompartment]]s. < ref name= " Bobik2007 " > {{cite journal | author = Bobik T.A. | title = Bacterial microcompartments | year = 2007 | journal = Microbe | volume = 2 | pages = 25–31 | url = http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000002765/znw00107000025.pdf | publisher = Am Soc Microbiol | access-date = 2011-01-06 | archive-date = 2008-08-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080802025916/http://www.asm.org/ASM/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000002765/znw00107000025.pdf | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Scope of the term == 
 The term is now widely used to refer to cell structures surrounded by single or double [[plasma membrane]]s. < ref > Nultsch, ''Allgemeine Botanik'', '''11''' Aufl. 2001, Thieme Verlag < /ref > < ref > Wehner/Gehring: Zoologies. '''23'''. Aufl. 1995, Thieme Verlag < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = Alberts| first = Bruce| title = Molecular Biology of the Cell| year = 2004| isbn = 978-0-8153-3218-3 }} < /ref > < ref > Brock, [[Microbiology]], 2. korrigierter Nachdruck 2003. der 1. Aufl. von 2001 < /ref >  However, the older definition of a 'subcellular functional unit' still exists. So, the term is sometimes used for structures which are not membrane-bound. < ref > Strasburger's Lehrbuch der Botanik für Hochschulen, 35. Aufl. 2002. S. 42 < /ref > < ref name= " clam " > {{cite journal |author=Alliegro MC, Alliegro MA, Palazzo RE |year=2006 |title=Centrosome-associated RNA in surf clam oocytes |journal=Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=103 |issue=24 |pages=9037–9038 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0602859103 |pmid=16754862 |pmc=1482561 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.9034A |doi-access=free }} < /ref > 
 
 The plasma membrane is a [[lipid bilayer]] with some proteins embedded in it. It keeps the [[ions]] and [[molecules]] of the organelle from merging with the surroundings. 
 
 == Origin of organelles == 
 [[Mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] have double-membranes and their [[DNA]]. These are believed to come from incompletely digested or invading [[prokaryotes]], which were adopted as a part of the invaded cell. This idea is supported in the [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic theory]].

 == Prokaryotic organelles == 
 [[Prokaryote]]s are not so complex as eukaryotes. They were once thought to have no internal structures inside the [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membranes]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Ryter A |title=Contribution of new cryomethods to a better knowledge of bacterial anatomy |journal=Ann. Inst. Pasteur Microbiol. |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |year=1988 |pmid=3289587 |doi=10.1016/0769-2609(88)90095-6}} < /ref > 
 
 However, recent research has shown that at least some prokaryotes have [[Bacterial microcompartment|microcompartment]]s such as [[carboxysome]]s. These subcellular compartments are 100–200 & nbsp;nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins. < ref name= " structures " > {{cite journal |pmid=16081736 | doi = 10.1126/science.1113397 |year=2005 |author=Kerfeld CA |display-authors = etal|title=Protein structures forming the shell of primitive bacterial organelles |volume=309 |issue=5736 |pages=936–8 |journal=Science|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..936K | s2cid = 24561197 }} < /ref >   Even more striking is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Komeili A. |display-authors = etal|title=Magnetosomes are cell membrane invaginations organized by the actin-like protein MamK |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5758 |pages=242–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16373532 |doi=10.1126/science.1123231|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..242K |s2cid = 36909813}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Scheffel A. |display-authors = etal |title=An acidic protein aligns magnetosomes along a filamentous structure in magnetotactic bacteria |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7080 |pages=110–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16299495 |doi=10.1038/nature04382|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..110S |s2cid = 4372846 }} < /ref >  as well as the nucleus-like structures of the ''Planctomycetes'' that are surrounded by [[Lipid bilayer|lipid membranes]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Fuerst JA |title=Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-microbiology_2005_59/page/299 |journal=Annu.
