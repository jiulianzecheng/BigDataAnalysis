 A '''match''' is a [[tool]] for making [[fire]] under controlled circumstances. Most often, it is a small piece of [[wood]], or hardened [[paper]]. At one end, the match is coated with a material that will ignite from [[friction]]. The lighting end of a match is known as the match  " head " . It either contains '''an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder''' as the active ingredient and [[gelatin]] as a binder. Matches are sold in multiples, packaged together either in a [[box]], or in [[matchbook]]s. There are two main types of matches: '''safety matches''', which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface; and '''strike-anywhere matches''', for which any suitably frictional surface can be used. 
 
 There are also [[electric match]]es, which use [[electricity]] and not friction to produce a fire. 
 
 ==Early matches== 
 Matches that used [[sulfur]] were mentioned by [[Martial]] in [[ancient Rome]]. He called them ''sulphurata''. < ref > [[Martial]], ''Epigrammata'', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book01.htm I 41], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book12.htm XII 57] < /ref > 
 
 Around the year 1530, Matches appeared in Europe. The first modern, self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by K. Chancel, assistant to Professor [[Louis Jacques Th√©nard]] of [[Paris]], though. The head of the match was made of a mixture of [[potassium chlorate]], [[sulfur]], [[sugar]], and [[rubber]]. They were ignited by dipping the tip of the match in a small [[asbestos]] bottle filled with [[sulfuric acid]]. This kind of match was quite expensive and its usage was dangerous, so Chancel's matches never gained much popularity. 
 
 ==Special-purpose matches== 
 '''Storm matches,''' also known as [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] matches or flare matches, have an easy to strike tip like a normal match, but much of the stick is coated with a [[burning|combustible]] compound which will keep burning even in a strong wind. They have a [[wax]] coating to make them waterproof. They are a component of many [[survival kit]]s. This particular match was used in the first mass-produced [[Molotov cocktail]]s. 
 
 ''' " Bengal matches " ''' are actually small hand-held [[fireworks]] akin to [[sparkler]]s. They are similar to storm matches in form, but they include compounds of [[strontium]] or [[barium]] in the compound on the stick to produce a red or green flame respectively.
