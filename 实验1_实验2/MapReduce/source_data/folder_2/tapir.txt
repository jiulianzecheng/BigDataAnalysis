 '''Tapirs''' are [[odd-toed ungulate]]s form the family '''Tapiridae'''. The only living [[genus]] is '''''Tapirus'''''. The first tapirids appeared in the [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], and by the [[Oligocene]] they looked similar to the present-day [[species]]. For much of their history, tapirs were spread across the [[Northern Hemisphere]] [[extinct]] as recently as 10,000 years ago. < ref > Palmer D. (ed) 1999.

 == Appearance == 
 Tapirs are about 2 [[metre|m]] / 7 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]] long and about 1 meter / 3 & nbsp;ft high. They weigh between 150 - 300 [[kilogram|kg]] / 330 - 700 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]. They have a rounded body and very short stubby tails. Tapirs have hoofed [[toe]]s, with four toes on the front feet and three toes on the hind feet. The Tapir's upper lip and nose have formed a short [[trunk]], and they have a long tongue. 
 
 Tapirs have a short [[fur]], with colors that are reddish-brown to grey to nearly black. Exceptions are the Mountain Tapir and the Asian Tapir. The Mountain Tapir has longer wooly fur. The Asian Tapir has a black front part and legs, and a white middle part and back. All baby tapirs have brown fur, with lighter stripes and dots for [[camouflage]]. 
 
 Tapirs cannot [[sight|see]] very well, but they have good [[hearing]] and a very good sense of [[Olfaction|smell]]. Tapirs also swim very well. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Tapirs live in of [[South America]] and [[Central America]], except the Asian Tapir which lives in [[Southeast Asia]].  
 Tapirs live in dense [[forest]]s, and close to water. They can also live in savannah biomes, or in dry tropical deciduous forests near a permanent water source. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Jirik|first=Kate|title=LibGuides: Tapirs (extant/living species; Tapirus spp.) Fact Sheet: Distribution  &  Habitat|url=https://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/tapirs/distribution|access-date=2023-11-07|website=ielc.libguides.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Life == 
 Tapirs are active at night. They eat [[leaf|leaves]], [[fruit]], [[berry|berries]], [[vegetable]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. 
 
 Tapirs live alone. After a [[pregnancy]] of about 13 months, the female gives birth to a single baby. After half a year the baby starts to lose the baby-coloring of its fur. When the young tapir is one year old it looks like an adult tapir, and it leaves its mother. Tapirs become mature when they are 4 years old. Tapirs can become 25 – 30 years old.
