 Selbach was a great Scottish king who ruled [[Dál Riata]] from 700 to 723, when he retired to become a [[monk]]. He is well recorded, and defeated Beli II, the king of [[Strathclyde]], at Lorg Ecclet. He also fought Ainbcellach, his brother and contestant for the throne, at Finnglen in 719, and was victorious. However, then he was defeated by [[Dúnchad Bec]] (Duncan the Small, a ruler from Kintyre), another rival, the same year. Selbach died in 730, three years after fighting his son's great enemy [[Eochaid mac Echdach]].
