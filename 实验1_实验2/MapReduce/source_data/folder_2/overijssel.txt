 '''Overijssel'''  < !-- {{listen|039 Overijssel.ogg}}-- >  ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Transisalania'') is a [[province]] of the [[Netherlands]]. It is in the central eastern part of the country. The province's name in both [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and Latin means  " Lands across river [[IJssel]] " . The capital city of Overijssel is [[Zwolle, Netherlands|Zwolle]]. Its biggest city is [[Enschede]]. About 1,166,000 people are living in Overijssel (2021).  
 
 == Geography == 
 Overijssel has [[Germany]] to the east. The [[Achterhoek]] region of [[Gelderland]] lies to the south, the [[Veluwe]] region of Gelderland and [[Flevoland]] are to the west, and [[Friesland]] and the former moors of [[Drenthe]] to the north. Overijssel is made of three regions: [[Kop van Overijssel]] in the northwest, [[Salland]] in the centre of the province, and [[Twente]] in the east. Besides the capital Zwolle, the major cities are [[Almelo]], [[Deventer]], [[Enschede]], and [[Hengelo]]. 
 
 To the southeast, the land is mostly sandy. There are small rivers and brooks cutting through it. Examples for such rivers are [[Regge River|Regge]] and [[Dinkel]]. In the northwest, the geology is mostly made of  sediments from the ''[[Vecht (Overijssel)|Overijsselse Vecht]]'' and clay. The northern parts were once covered by ''veen'' ([[bog]]s) which separated the dryer and more arable south from [[Drenthe]]. These bogs have been exploited as fuel to a large degree. Only small patches survive today (''Engbertsdijksvenen'' near [[Tubbergen]], ''Witteveen'' (near [[Haaksbergen]], and the Aamsveen (near [[Enschede]]). The extreme northwest is dominated by a system of lakes formed by former peat-mining, the [[Weerribben]], which is a valuable wetland. 
 
 The highest point in Overijssel is the summit of the [[Tankenberg]], a hill in the municipality of [[Losser]]. It is 89 metres (295 & nbsp;ft). The lowest point is in the Mastenbroek [[Polder]] near [[Kampen, Netherlands|Kampen]] at 2 metres (6 & nbsp;ft) below [[sea level]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Overijssel was formerly known as [[Oversticht]]. In 1336, it was made part of [[Guelders]]. It was given to the [[Archbishop of Utrecht|Bishopric of Utrecht]] in 1347. Utrecht was known as ''het Sticht''. The Bishops gave the Oversticht to the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1528, who styled himself  " Lord of Overijssel " . With this, he gave the province its modern name. The people joined with the other Dutch and rebelled against Charles' heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. Overijssel became governed by the most powerful mayors and lords in the province. 
 
 After a brief occupation by the forces of the [[Bishop of Münster]] (1672–1674), Overijssel received a new form of government. This granted the [[stadtholder]]s more power. Widespread resistance against the bigger power throughout the provinces lead to the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1795. A centralist government arose and the Netherlands was organised into a series of ''[[département]]s'', based on those used by revolutionary [[France]]. At first organised into its own ''[[Overijssel (département)|département]]'', it was merged with [[Drenthe]] in 1798 to form [[Ouden Ijssel]], which was renamed Overijssel in 1801. 
 
 The French annexed the Batavian Republic in 1810, and Overijssel was organised into the new French département of [[Bouches-de-l'Yssel]]. After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1814, the kingdom of the Netherlands and the former province of Overijssel were recreated. Overijssel was briefly occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] from May 1940, until its liberation in April 1945. The [[Noordoostpolder]], which had been laid dry in 1942, was part of Overijssel from 1962 until 1986, when it became part of the newly created province of [[Flevoland]].
