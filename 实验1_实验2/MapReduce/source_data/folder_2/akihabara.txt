 ==Electronics== 
 As mentioned, Akihabara is famous as electric town. 
 
 ===Electronic component=== 
 After [[World War II]], a black market at Kanda developed. And what began as a host of electrical stores selling radio goods or some electronic component has today come to be known as Electric Town. 
 
 ===Consumer electronics=== 
 Consumer electronics such as a TV or washing machine is one of the products sold in Akihabara for a long time. These days, because of intense price competition, mid or small-scale electrical appliance shops have decreased and large retail electrical appliances store came to be outstanding. However, the shops treating a lot of consumer electrionics for foreign countries are prosperous by foreign tourists.
