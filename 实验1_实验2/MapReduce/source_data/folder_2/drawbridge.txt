 A '''drawbridge''' is a [[bridge]] that can be moved in order to stop or allow passage across it. They were often built as part of [[medieval]] [[castle]]s which had [[moat]]s. 
 
 Modern drawbridges are often built across large, busy [[waterway]]s. They can be lifted to allow large ships to pass or lowered to allow land vehicles or [[pedestrian]]s to cross.
