 The '''Couesnon River''' ({{IPA-fr|kwenɔ̃}}) is a [[river]]. It starts in the ''[[Département in France|département]]'' of [[Mayenne]] in [[north west|north-western]] [[France]]. It forms an [[estuary]] at [[Mont-Saint-Michel]]. Its last stretch is the [[border]] between the historical [[duchy|duchies]] of [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. In the past, its course changed often between two beds. They are on the north and south of the [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. In the end, it settled to the south bed. This created (''made'') the saying  " The Couesnon's madness placed Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy "  (''in french'',  " ''le couesnon en sa folie mit le Mont en Normandie'' " ), as the mount is just to the Norman side of the river's mouth, now.  However, the [[administrative division|administrative boundary]] which separates the two [[Regions of France|regions]] does not depend on the course of the river. The border is about six kilometres west of the mount. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The Couesnon, the [[Sée]] and the [[Sélune]] form part of the complex water system of the bay of Mont Saint-Michel. On one side, the [[tide]] brings lots of [[sediment]]. This causes large [[sandbar]]s within the river. On the other side, the three rivers bring the sediment back to sea. 
 
 In the 20th century, the Couesnon was made into a [[canal]]. This to reduced the [[erosion]] of its banks. In 1969, a [[dam]] was built. These changes, and the [[causeway]] linking Mont Saint-Michel to the mainland, have made mudflats. The French built a bridge to replace the causeway. It was finished in 2013. This helped to remove the [[silt]]. 
 
 During [[spring tide]]s, a [[tidal bore]] — a wave caused by the tide rising — can be seen going up the river. 
 
 The Couesnon flows through the following [[departments of France|departments]] and towns: 
 *[[Ille-et-Vilaine]]: [[Fougères]], [[Antrain]] 
 *[[Manche]]: [[Pontorson]] 
 
 ==Hydrology and water quality== 
 In the summer, the water flow is typically in the range of {{convert|150|cuft/s|m3/s}}. The [[pH]] has been measured at 8.26 (Hogan, 2006). The temperature of the water is 19 degrees Celsius in summer, in the area of the mouth.  Water [[turbidity]] is moderate with a [[Secchi disc]] reading of 14 centimetres.  Electrical conductivity at the mouth is high.
