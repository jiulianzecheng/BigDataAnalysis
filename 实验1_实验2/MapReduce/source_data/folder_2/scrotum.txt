 The '''scrotum''' is the bag that holds the [[testicle]]s (commonly called ''balls'') in [[male]] [[mammal]]s. It is made of [[skin]] and [[muscle]] and is found between the [[penis]] and [[anus]]. It is often covered in [[pubic hair]] and becomes tight when the male is [[sexual arousal|aroused]]. The scrotum has a seam or slightly raised line of skin which is called the raphe. 
 
 == Use == 
 [[File:Male Landing Strip 1.png|thumb|The scrotum will usually tighten during erection. ]] 
 The function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body. Human testicles work best at 36.8 degrees [[Celsius]] (98 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]) when normal [[body temperature]] is 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures than 36.8 degrees will damage the [[sperm]] inside the testicles. 
 
 The temperature is controlled by moving the testicles closer to the [[abdomen]] when they are too cold, and away when too hot. This is done by muscles [[contraction|contracting]] or [[relaxing]]. This lifts and lowers the testicles inside the scrotum. The scrotum will usually tighten during [[erection]]. The testicles can also be lifted by tightening the anus and [[pelvis|pelvic]] muscles.  
 
 Some men put [[jewelry]] on the scrotum, mainly for decoration. 
 
 === Temperature === 
 The best temperature for the testes varies between [[species]], but usually it is a bit cooler than body temperature. This means that the testicles have to be held outside of the body in most male mammals. 
 
 ===Protection=== 
 The scrotum may move the testes closer to the abdomen when in danger. Testes are extremely sensitive, and hitting or injuring them causes extreme pain. Males avoid this by involunatirly moving the testes closer.  
 
 Another explanation for the location of the scrotum is to that their exterior location protects the testes from jolts and being crushed inside the body. Animals that have slow movements - such as [[elephant]]s, [[whale]]s, and [[mole]]s - have internal testes and no scrotum. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15120432.000-science--bumpy-lifestyle-led-to-external-testes.html |title=Science : Bumpy lifestyle led to external testes - 17 August 1996 - New Scientist |accessdate=2007-11-06 |format= }} < /ref > 
 
 When the scrotum is hanging loosely, the testicular cords that the testicle hangs from can get twisted. This is especially prone to happen during exercise.  This is called [[:en:Testicular_torsion|testicular_torsion]]. It is a medical emergency.
