'''Camogie''' (in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''camógaíocht'') is an [[Ireland|Irish]] team [[sport]], organised by the ''Camogie Association of Ireland'', the women's variant of hurling. The rules are almost identical to hurling with a few exceptions. 
 
 One is that goalkeepers wear the same colours as outfield players and a player in camogie can handpass a score, which is not allowed in the men's game. All games last 60 minutes (senior inter-county hurling games last 70), and dropping the [[camogie stick]] to handpass the ball is allowed. The All-Ireland Final is held every year in [[Croke Park]] during September, usually the week between the hurling final and [[Gaelic football]] final. There are two main competitions; the National League which is staged during the winter-spring months and is used as a warm-up to the All-Ireland Championships during the summer. 
 
 The reigning champions are [[County Cork|Cork]]. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/2017/0910/903602-cork-v-kilkenny-all-ireland-final-report/ |title=Cork defeat Kilkenny in dramatic camogie finale |accessdate=25 June 2018|work=[[RTÉ News]] |date= 10 September 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 ==The name  " camogie " == 
 Camogie/[[hurling]] is unique in that it uses a different name for the version played by men and women. The reason is complicated: men play using a curved stick called in Irish a ''camán''. Women would use a shorter stick, called by the diminutive form ''camóg''. The suffix -''aíocht'' was added to both words to give names for the sports: ''camánaíocht'' (which became ''iománaíocht'') and ''camógaíocht''. When the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] was founded in 1884 the English-origin name  " hurling "  was given to the men's game. When an organisation for women was set up in 1904, it was decided to Anglicise the Irish name ''camógaíocht'' to ''camogie''.
