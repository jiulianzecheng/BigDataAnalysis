 '''Citypoint''' (previously known as '''Britannic House''' and '''Britannic Tower''') is a [[skyscraper]] located on Ropemaker Street on the northern part of the [[City of London]], the main financial district and historic center of [[London]]. 
 
 Originally named Britannic House, Citypoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, {{convert|122|m|ft|0}} tall headquarters for [[BP|British Petroleum]] (now BP). This became the first building in the City of London area to pass the height of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. < ref > [http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/diad/article.php?year=1968 & title=236 & article=d.236.15 Design Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317172224/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/diad/article.php?title=236 & year=1968 & article=d.236.15 |date=2011-03-17 }} < /ref >  In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on [[Finsbury Circus]] and the building was renamed Britannic Tower. 
 
 It was [[wikt:refurbish|refurbished]] in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to {{convert|127|m|ft|0}}. Sheppard Robson helped to improve the building. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=81 |title=Citypoint on Skyscrapernews.com |access-date=2019-05-31 |archive-date=2022-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705191258/http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=81 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It was then renamed to Citypoint. 
 
 Citypoint is the seventh-tallest building in the City, after the [[Heron Tower]], [[122 Leadenhall Street]], [[Tower 42]], [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[20 Fenchurch Street]] but only the 23rd-tallest in Greater London. 
 
 In August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than £500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market. 
 
 In early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for £650 million, and purchased by a private American company called [[Beacon Capital Partners]]. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. However [[8 Canada Square]] at Canary Wharf eclipsed this by some margin just a few months later when it was sold for over £1 billion. 
 
 A number of other large buildings are planned on sites nearby. These include a 43-storey, {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} residential tower at Milton Court. A {{convert|90|m|ft|0}} office tower at Ropemaker Place has also been developed by [[British Land]].
