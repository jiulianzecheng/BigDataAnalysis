 '''Lionel Pickens''' (December 4, 1983 – May 17, 2015), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Chinx''' (formerly '''Chinx Drugz'''), was an American [[rapper]] from [[Queens, New York]]. He was a member of [[French Montana]]'s Coke Boys group and record label. Other members are Cheeze, Flip, and Lil Durk. He was best known for his raps on the ''Coke Boys'' mixtapes and the ''Cocaine Riot'' mixtape series. He died from a fatal gunshot wound after a drive-by shooting in [[Jamaica, Queens]] on May 17, 2015. 
 
 On how he got started rapping, Chinx said:  " I started rapping at the table in [[junior high school]] for fun with the homies and then by 9th grade is when I started taking music seriously. At that point is when I started investing my street money into my studio time and trying to find my sound. " < ref name= " xxlbreak " / >
