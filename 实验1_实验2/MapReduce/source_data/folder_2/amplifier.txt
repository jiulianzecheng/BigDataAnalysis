 The word '''amplifier''' (sometimes called an '''amp''') usually refers to an electronic amplifier. Electronic amplifiers make a signal from a [[radio]] or electric [[musical instrument]] (such as an [[electric guitar]] or an electric [[bass guitar]]) louder and stronger. Amplifiers are also hidden in any electronic thing that makes sound with loudspeakers. This includes televisions, radios, computers, and mp3 players, to name a few. 
 
 Amplifiers ability to use low impedance speakers may vary. Typical impedance is 8 ohms. 
 
 Classification can be done by current loss when amplifier is on but does not get signal. Example: A-class amplifier takes more current without signal than B-class amplifier but A-class amplifier have smaller distortion. 
 
 There is also several distortion types.  
 
 ==How it works== 
 Electronic amplifiers make a signal from the radio or electric instrument louder and stronger by using [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube]]s. Electronic amplifiers have to be connected to [[electrical current]] or a [[battery]] to work. Once the signal from the radio or electric instrument has been made louder and stronger, the signal needs to be connected to a [[loudspeaker]] so that people can hear it. 
 
 When an amplifier tries to make the sound louder than it can, it adds [[distortion]] to the sound. Some amplifiers are made to add controlled distortion. Distortion from transistors sounds different than distortion from tubes. Distortion from tubes is often [[Tube sound|said to be more musical]]. Because of all this, more expensive amplifiers often add controlled distortion with tubes. Many of these amplifiers use transistors for a  " clean "  sound (without distortion). 
 
 ==History== 
 From the  [[1920s]] until the  [[1950s]], electronic amplifiers used vacuum tubes. However, electronic amplifiers with vacuum tubes were heavy, and they produced a lot of heat. They also broke down a lot.  
 
 Since the [[1960s]], most electronic amplifiers have been built with [[transistor]]s. Transistors are lighter, cheaper, and more reliable.
