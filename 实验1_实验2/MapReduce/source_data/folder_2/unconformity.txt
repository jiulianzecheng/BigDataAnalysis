 An '''unconformity''' is a [[wikt:gap|gap]] in the sequence of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] in a geologic column. It is a buried [[erosion]] surface separating two rock [[strata]] of different ages. It shows that [[sediment]] deposition was broken for a time, usually because the land was above sea level at that time.  
 
 Usually, the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger. However, the term is used to describe any break in the [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] record. 
 
 Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity.   
 
 [[James Hutton]] found examples of unconformity in [[Scotland]], at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/geology/elothian_borders/hutton.asp |title=Hutton's Unconformity |access-date=2011-01-07 |archive-date=2015-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104617/http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/geology/elothian_borders/hutton.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=monty > {{cite web |url=http://nagt.org/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/Montgomery_v51n5.pdf |title=Siccar Point and teaching the history of Geology |accessdate=2008-03-26 |author=Keith Montgomery |date=2003 |format=pdf |work= |publisher=University of Wisconsin }} < /ref > 
 
 The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned). An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region.  
 
 The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area. The interval of geologic time not represented is called a ''hiatus'' (= 'gap').
