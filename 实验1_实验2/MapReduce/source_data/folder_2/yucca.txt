 '''Yucca''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s, related to the [[agave]]s. There are between 40 and 50 different [[species|kinds]] of Yucca. All come from the [[heat|hot]] and [[:wikt:dry|dry]] places in [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]], as well as the [[Caribbean]].  
 
 They have a very special way of [[pollination]]. There is an [[animal]], the [[Yucca moth]], which does the pollination. It also lays its [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in the plant. The [[larva]]e will eat some of the [[seed]]s, but not all of them. 
 
 In many parts of the world, yuccas are grown as [[ornament]]al [[flower]]s.
