 '''''Vibrio''''' is a type of [[gram-negative]] [[bacteria]] that have a curved rod shape, several species of which can cause [[food poisoning]], usually due to eating seafood that has not been cooked enough. They are usually found in [[Seawater|saltwater]] as they cannot survive in freshwater. ''Vibrio'' can breathe with or without oxygen and do not create [[spore|spores]]. All members of the genus can move and have [[flagella]] on both ends with or without sheaths. Recent [[phylogeny|phylogenies]] have been made based on a group of [[gene]]s (multi-locus sequence analysis). 
 
 The name ''Vibrio'' comes from [[Filippo Pacini]] who isolated microorganisms he called  " vibrions "  from [[cholera]] patients in [[1854]].
