 '''''Deinosuchus''''' is an [[extinct]] relative of the [[alligator]] which lived 80 to 73 million years ago, in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]].  
 
 The first remains were discovered in [[North Carolina]] in the 1850s, but it was not until 1909 that the [[genus]] was named and described.  
 
 Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later made into an influential, but inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Knowledge of ''Deinosuchus'' is still incomplete, but better [[skull]] material has been found in recent years. 
 
 ''Deinosuchus'' was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator: it was up to {{Convert|10.6|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and weighed up to {{convert|4.3|MT|ST}}. However, its overall appearance was fairly similar to its modern relatives.  
 
 It had large, robust teeth that were [[adapted]] to crushing, and its back was covered with thick round bony plates. One study suggests that ''Deinosuchus'' may have lived for up to 50 & nbsp;years, growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians, but growing for a much longer period. 
 
 ''Deinosuchus'' fossils have been found in ten [[U.S. state]]s, as well as northern [[Mexico]]. It lived on both sides of the [[Western Interior Seaway]], and was an ambush [[apex predator]] in the coastal regions of eastern North America.  
 
 ''Deinosuchus'' reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate [[species]]. ''Deinosuchus'' was probably capable of killing and eating large [[dinosaur]]s. < ref name= " colbert-dinoworld " > {{cite book|title=Dinosaurs: their discovery and their world|url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaurstheirdi00colb|last=Colbert|first=Edwin H.|publisher=E.P.
