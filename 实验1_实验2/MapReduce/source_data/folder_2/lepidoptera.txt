 The order '''Lepidoptera''' is the second biggest [[order (biology)|order]] of  [[insect]]s. It includes the [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]] including the  [[skipper (butterfly)|skippers]]. There is no common word for the group: ordinary people talk of  " butterflies and moths " .  
 
 The order has more than 180,000 [[species]] in 128 [[Family (biology)|families]] and 47 [[Superfamily|superfamilies]]. < ref >

 The name, Lepidoptera, comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''λεπίδος'' (scale) and ''πτερόν'' (wing).

 == Characteristics of Lepidoptera == 
 Lepidopterans go through complete [[metamorphosis]]. This means that they have a four parts to their lives. The first part is the [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The second part is the [[caterpillar]] or [[larva]]. The third part is the [[pupa]]. The last part is the adult or [[imago]]. 
 
 === Larva === 
 The larvae have a tough [[head]] and a soft [[body]]. They have [[mouth]]s that are made to [[wikt:chew|chew]]. Some larvae are covered with hairs, or other body [[wikt:extensions|extensions]]. The larvae have three pairs of small [[leg]]s on the [[thorax]]. These legs are called true legs. There are up to five pairs of bigger legs on the [[abdomen]]. These legs are called prolegs. Lepidopteran larvae can be [[wikt:confused|confused]] with the larvae of [[Symphyta|sawflies]]. The [[wikt:difference|difference]] between Lepidopteran larvae and sawfly larvae is that Lepidopteran larvae have tiny hooks on their prolegs. These hooks are called crochets. Most larvae are [[herbivore]]s, but a few are [[carnivore]]s and [[detritivore]]s. < ref name= " dugdale " > Dugdale, JS, 1996.

Journal of The Royal Society of New Zealand, Volume 26, Number 2, pp 251-274 < /ref > 
 
 === Adult === 
 Adults have two pairs of [[wing]]s. They are covered by small [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. In some species, the adults have very small wings or no wings at all. This is more common in [[female]]s. Adults have [[antenna]]e. Some moths have antennae that look like [[feather]]s. These feather-like antennae are larger in males than females. Adults have a [[mouthpart]] called a proboscis. It  [[wikt:suck|sucks]] [[nectar]] from [[flower]]s. Some adults do not have mouths and cannot feed. Others have different mouths that are made to pierce and suck [[blood]] or [[fruit]] [[wikt:juices|juices]]. < ref name= " scoble " > Scoble M.J. 1992.
