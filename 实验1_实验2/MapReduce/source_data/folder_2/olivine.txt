 '''Olivine''' (or chrysolite) is a [[silicate mineral]] made of [[magnesium]] [[iron]] [[silicate]] with the formula {{chem2|auto=1|(Mg,Fe)2SiO4}}. 
 
 It ranges in colour from [[chartreuse green]] to pale [[Olive (colour)|olive]].  In its [[gem]] form, it is called [[peridot]]. 
 
 '''Dunite''' [[contain]]s (or has) over 90%+ olivine in it.  Dunite and other peridotite rocks are major constituents of the [[Earth's mantle]] above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found on land, except where slabs of mantle rock from a [[plate tectonics|subduction zone]] have been thrust onto [[continental crust]].  
 Olivine has also been found at several extraterrestrial locations, such as the moon and many passing space rocks - as well as the outer layers of dust orbiting young stars.
