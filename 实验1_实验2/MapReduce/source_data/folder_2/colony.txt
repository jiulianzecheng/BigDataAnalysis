 A '''colony''' is a piece of land controlled by another [[country]]. The metropolitan state is the country that owns the colony. The phrase ''[[dependent territory]]'' is now used instead of ''colony''. '''Colony''' can also refer to a [[commune]] or a currently hypothetical [[human settlement]] in the sea ([[ocean colony]]) or [[outer space]] ([[space colony]]). 
 
 A country that has many colonies is often called an [[empire]]. A colonist is a person from the metropolitan state who lives in a colony. 
 
 Colonial means having to do with a colony. Colonial land is land that belongs to the colony. A colonist is sometimes called a colonial. The [[philosophy]] of having colonies is called [[colonialism]]. There must be many people to start a colony. There are many colonies, or countries that were once colonies, in the world. Most countries that were once colonies of [[Britain]] are part of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].
