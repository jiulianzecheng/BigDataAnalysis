 '''Tax''' is money that people have to pay to the [[government]]. 
 
 The government uses the money it gets from taxes to pay for things. For example, taxes are used to pay for people who work for the government, such as the [[military]] and [[police]], provide services such as [[education]] and [[health care]], and to maintain or build things like [[roads]], [[bridge|bridges]] and [[sewer]]s. The earliest known taxes were those of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.          
 
 == Types of taxes == 
 
 There are many different kinds of taxes. They may be direct tax or indirect  tax. 
 * Taxes that are based on how much money a company earns are called '''corporate taxes'''  
 * Taxes that are based on how much money a person earns are called '''income taxes'''.  
 
 * Taxes that are based on how much a person buys are called [[sales tax|'''sales taxes''']].  
 * Taxes that are based on how much a person owns are called '''property taxes'''. Things like houses have a [[property tax]] on them. 
 * Taxes that are paid when official documents are approved are called [[Stamp Act|'''stamp duties''']] (because in the past the document would have a stamp put on it). Changing who owns a house will often need a document approving.  
 * Taxes that are paid when somebody dies are called '''[[inheritance]]''' or '''estate taxes.''' 
 
 Taxes can also be split into 3 groups: 
 * '''Flat taxes''': Everybody pays the same percentage. Russia has a flat income tax and everybody in Russia has to pay 13% of the income. 
 * '''Progressive taxes''': The more money a person makes, the higher percentage of their income they have to pay. Most countries have progressive income taxes. 
 * '''Regressive taxes''': The less money a person makes, the higher percentage of their income they have to pay. Sales taxes are usually called regressive as poor people spend a higher percentage of their money than rich people. 
 
 == Paying lots of different taxes == 
 Often because different parts of governments use taxes for different things, people end up paying lots of taxes. 
 
 In the [[United States]], for example, the national government has an income tax; most states have an income tax or a sales tax, or both; and cities and towns may have a sales tax or a property tax. In some states such as Ohio, the sales tax is different in each county. 
 
 == Before Taxes == 
 In ancient times, people from one city or area would attack another place, and make the people there pay ''[[tribute]]''. Tribute meant that the attacked people would pay money (or other things), and the attacker would stop attacking them. A famous tribute was the [[Danegeld]], when people from [[Denmark]] conquered part of [[England]] and made the English pay thousands of [[silver]] coins. < ref > {{cite book |last1= Munoz |first1= Shaun |title= NZ GST Calculator|url= https://gstinfo.net/}} < /ref > 
 
 == Groups who are against taxes == 
 [[Anarchist]]s and [[Libertarian]]s are against all taxes or against high taxes. As people are paying them unwillingly and under the threat of [[:wikt:sanction|sanction]]s, they say that taxation is the same as [[robbery]]. ([[Taxation as theft]]) < ref > {{cite book |last1= Schweigl |first1= Johan |title= Legal and Economic Aspects of Regulation of Social Relations from the Point of View of the 4th Generation of Austrian School of Economics |url= https://is.muni.cz/th/210729/pravf_m/?lang=en |accessdate= 2017-06-19 |date= 2011-03-25 |publisher= Masarykova univerzita |location= Brno |language= Czech |page= 85-86 |chapter= Rothbardův anarcho-kapitalismus}} < /ref >
