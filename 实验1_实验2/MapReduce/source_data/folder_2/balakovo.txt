 == History == 
 Balakovo was founded in 1762 by the [[Old Believers]] who returned from [[Poland]]. It was granted town status in 1913. < ref name= " gr " > {{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|year=2003|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|location=Moscow|page=33}} < /ref > 
 
 For a long time people thought that the city of Balakovo was founded in 1762, but later a [[document]] from 1738 was found in the archives of [[St. Petersburg]]. It [[wikt:mention|mentions]] the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] meadow possession of Balakov Yurt. In 1762, Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] wanted the Old Believers to return from [[Poland]] to Russia and [[Settler|settle]] on the lands between the [[Bolshoy Irgiz River|Bolshoy]] and [[Maly Irgiz River|Maly Irgiz]] [[rivers]]. The Old Believers founded many new [[wikt:settlement|settlements]], including Balakovo. In 1861, there were 2,700 people living in the [[village]] of Balakovo. The village grew quickly because of the wheat trade that went through it. Up to 10 million [[Pood|poods]] of [[grain]] were sent from Balakovo in one season. There were over 300 big barns near Balakovo to store the grain. The village also had a large forest nearby that helped its economy. In 1897, the population of the village reached 18,388 people. 
 
 Balakovo grew in size and in industry at the start of the [[20th century]]. In May 1911, Balakovo was given city status. Ivan Mamin became the first city head. In 1917, there were 6 churches, 7 schools, the [[Grain trade|grain market]], the ironworks of [[Fyodor Blinov]] and the mechanical plant of oil engines of the Mamin brothers, ship repair and furniture workshops, sawmills, mills, a commercial college opened in 1910, the Zemsky hospital and the city factory ambulance (polyclinic), a library, and a power plant, which was organized by the  " Light "  partnership. 
 
 [[Inventors]] Fyodor Abramovich Blinov and Yakov Mamin made Balakovo the birthplace of the world's first caterpillar tractor, wheel self-propelled gun and Russian [[diesel engine]].
