 '''Mufti''' (/ˈmʌfti/; Arabic: مفتي‎), an Islamic legal authority who gives a formal legal opinion (fatwa) in answer to an inquiry by a private individual or judge. A fatwa usually requires knowledge of the [[Qur'an|Qur'ān]] and [[Hadith]] (narratives concerning the Prophet’s life and sayings), as well as knowledge of exegesis and collected precedents, and might be a pronouncement on some problematic legal matter.
