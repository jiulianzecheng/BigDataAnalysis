 '''Heat''', or '''thermal energy''', is the sum of the [[kinetic energy]] of atoms or molecules. In [[thermodynamics]], heat means energy which is moved between two things, when one of them has a higher [[temperature]] than the other thing. 
 
 Adding heat to something increases its temperature, but heat is not the same as [[temperature]]. The temperature of an object is the measure of the [[average]] speed of the moving [[Matter|particles]] in it.  The [[energy]] of the particles is called the [[internal energy]].  When an object is heated, its [[internal energy]] can increase to make the object hotter.  The [[first law of thermodynamics]] says that the increase in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the [[Work (physics)|work]] done on the surroundings. 
 
 '''Heat''' can also be defined as '''the amount of thermal energy''' in a system. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/heat-energy-definition-and-examples-2698981|title=How Physicists Define Heat|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-04-24}} < /ref >  [[Thermal energy]] is the type of [[energy]] that a thing has because of its [[temperature]]. In [[thermodynamics]], thermal energy is the [[internal energy]] present in a [[thermodynamic system|system]] in a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] because of its temperature. < ref > [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072068/thermal-energy Thermal energy] - Britannica < /ref >   That is, '''heat''' is defined as a spontaneous ''flow of energy'' (energy in transit) from one object to another, caused by a difference in temperature between two objects; therefore, objects do not possess heat. < ref name= " Schroeder "   > {{cite book|author= Schroeder, Daniel, R.|title=Thermal Physics|url= https://archive.org/details/introductiontoth0000schr_k1f1|publisher=New York: Addison Wesley Longman|year=2000|isbn=0201380277}} < /ref > 
 
 == Properties of Heat == 
 Heat is a form of energy and not a physical [[substance]].  Heat has no [[mass]]. 
 
 Heat can move from one place to another in different ways: 
 *[[Heat conduction|Conduction]] 
 *[[Convection]] 
 *[[Radiation]] 
 
 The measure of how much heat is needed to cause a change in temperature for a material is the specific [[heat capacity]] of the material. If the particles in the material are hard to move, then more energy is needed to make them move quickly, so a lot of heat will cause a small change in temperature. A different particle that is easier to move will need less heat for the same change in temperature. 
 
 Specific heat capacities can be looked up in a table, like [http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Thermal/HeatCapTable.html|1 this]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} one. 
 
 Unless some [[work (physics)|work]] is done, heat moves only from hot things to cold things. 
 
 == Measuring heat == 
 Heat can be [[measure]]d. That is, the amount of heat given out or taken in can be given a value. The calorie is one of the units of measurement for heat but the [[joule]] is also used for all kinds of energy including heat. 
 
 Heat is usually measured with a [[calorimeter]], where the energy in a material is allowed to flow into nearby water, which has a known specific heat capacity.  The temperature of the water is then measured before and after, and heat can be found using a [[formula]].
