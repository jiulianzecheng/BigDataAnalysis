 '''''Nanosaurus''''' ( " small or dwarf lizard " ) was an [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] that measured about 4 ft (1.1 m) long, weighing about 50 pounds (22.5 kg). Nanosaurus had a horny beak and a small skull with self-sharpening cheek teeth. Nanosaurus may have had cheek pouches.  
 
 This plant eater was bipedal (walked on two legs). It had thin legs and a stiffened tail that gave it speed and agility. It had five-fingered hands and four-toed feet, all clawed. It had large eyes and short arms. ''Nanosaurus'' resembled [[Hypsilophodon]]. Its fossils (two partial skeletons and teeth) were found in [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]] in rocks of the [[Jurassic|Late Jurassic]] age.
