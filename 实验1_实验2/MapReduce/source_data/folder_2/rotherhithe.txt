 '''Rotherhithe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|ð|ər|h|aɪ|ð}}) is a residential district in south east [[London]]. It is part of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Historically, the area was the most northeastern settlement in the county of [[Surrey]]. It is located on a [[peninsula]] on the [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames]] and is a part of the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area. It borders [[Bermondsey]] to the west and [[Deptford]] to the south east and faces [[Wapping]] and the [[Isle of Dogs]] on the north bank of the river. 
 
 The '''Rotherhithe Tunnel''' is a road tunnel under the [[River Thames]]. It connects [[Limehouse]] in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] north of the river to Rotherhithe  south of the river. A road runs through it called the A101. It was opened in 1908. It is a rare example of a road tunnel where road [[traffic]], [[pedestrian]]s and [[cyclist]]s all share the same tunnel. [[Transport for London]] took over ownership and maintenance of the tunnel in 2001.
