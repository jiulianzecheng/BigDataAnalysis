 '''''Anomalocaris''''' ( " abnormal shrimp " ) is an extinct [[genus]] of [[anomalocaridid]], which are, in turn, thought to be closely related to the [[arthropod]]s. The first fossils of ''Anomalocaris'' were discovered in the ''Ogygopsis'' shale by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves, with more examples found by [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]] in the famed [[Burgess Shale]]. 
 
 == Body Parts == 
 ''Anomalocaris'' lived in the [[Cambrian]] period, which was a long time before dinosaurs. This makes ''Anomalocaris'' very old, so their body parts haven't evolved to be as detailed as modern animals. However, ''Anomalocaris'' still had [[compound eye]]s which were very big and complex compared to other animals in the earlier parts of the [[Cambrian]], and also had segmented (has many sections) front [[appendage]]s which were used to grasp its prey like arms. So while ''Anomalocaris'' was around the size of a small cat, it still was a very good predator. 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 ''Anomalocaris'' lived in the [[sea]], like most of the plants (which were really small [[algae]] in the Cambrian) and animals during this time period. 
 Recently, people now think that ''Anomalocaris'' didn't hunt [[trilobite]]s and other [[benthos|benthic]] animals that lived on the sea floor, but instead swam after nekton like basal [[Chordata|chordates]] (animals that can control how they move underwater, unlike [[plankton]]).  
 
 == Being Called A Different Animal == 
 ''Anomalocaris'' was misidentified many times, as the [[mouth]], front appendages and trunk (the rest of its body) were discovered separately multiple times, leading scientists to think for a while that these parts of ''Anomalocaris'' were, in fact, of three different animals.
