 '''Cheese''' is a [[dairy product]] that is made from [[milk]]. There are many types of cheese, such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese|Swiss]], and [[provolone]].  
 
 Many things affect the [[form]], [[texture]], [[colour]] and [[flavor|flavour]] of a cheese. These include the milk ([[cow]] or [[Domestic goat|goat]]), if the milk has been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the amount of [[butterfat]], [[bacteria]] and [[mold]] in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is. 
 
 == Origin == 
 People have been making cheese since before [[history]] was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the [[Sumerians]] in about 4000 BC. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The history of cheese: from an ancient nomad's horseback to today's luxury cheese cart |work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct.|accessdate=2012-02-09}} < /ref >

 * How long the cheese was aged  
 * The [[texture]] of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer. 
 * How the cheese was made 
 * What type of [[milk]] was used to make the cheese. This is mainly what [[animal]] the milk comes from, such as cows, sheep, and goats. The [[diet]] of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk.
