 [[File:01 Runes of the Elder Futhark painted on little stones - Runen des älteren Futhark auf kleine Steine gemalt.jpg|250px|thumb|Elder Futhark]] 
 '''Runes''' are very old [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] which [[Germanic peoples|Germanic people]] used before they started using [[Roman alphabet|Latin]] letters in the [[Middle Ages]].  In its broadest sense, the word ''runes'' can mean any [[:wikt:en:cryptic|cryptic]] letters, but it usually means the [[alphabet]]s used by [[Scandinavia]]n people from about the year 150 [[Common Era|CE]] to the Middle Ages.  The oldest of these is called the ''Elder Fuþark'', used from about 150 to 800 CE.  Around the year 800 the runes changed into the ''Younger Fuþark'', and these were used until about 1100, when the Latin alphabet replaced them.  The [[Anglo-Saxon]] runes were used about the same time (400-1100) in [[Britain]].  The Scandinavian runes are called  " Fuþark "  because the first six letters in the runic alphabet are ᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚨ ᚱ ᚲ (F U Þ A R K).  The [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] are called  " Fuþorc "  because they are a little different. 
 
 Runes are found carved into stones (called [[runestone]]s) in many places in Scandinavia ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]), and in the [[British Isles]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Frisia]].  Runes have been used for writing [[poetry|poems]] and [[:wikt:en:eulogy|eulogies]], and they are still sometimes used to write [[cipher]]s.  Runes were also used by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his fantasy works, which were based on Germanic [[mythology]].  Because of their association with Germanic mythology, runes were also used by the [[Nazi]]s to support a new [[:wikt:en:mysticism|mysticism]] and a romantic sense of Germanic [[:wikt:en:heritage|heritage]].  The rune ᚦ survived into the Middle Ages in the [[English language]] and to modern times in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as the letter [[þ]] (pronounced  " th "  as in ''thing'').  After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], this letter was replaced by the letters ''th'' because it was unknown to the [[French language|French]]-speaking Normans.  Similarly, the letter [[ð]] (pronounced  " th "  as in ''this'') was used in Old English and is still used in Icelandic, but it is from Irish, not from the runes. 
 
 When the runes were first used, the Germanic languages were not yet split into their modern branches; there was only one unified language (called ''Proto-Germanic'') with many regional [[dialect]]s.  Each rune had a name, like our modern letters have names, but these very old names are no longer known.  By their association with later letters, the old names of the runes have been [[:wikt:reconstruction|reconstructed]].  The [*] before a rune's Proto-Germanic name means this is a reconstructed name.  Not all runes were drawn the same way, however, and some of the runes and their names were different in some places.
