 The '''aardvark''' (''Orycteropus afer'') is a [[mammal]] from [[Africa]]; its [[name]] means  " [[earth]] [[pig]] "  in the [[language]] [[Afrikaans]]. It is the only living member in its [[order (biology)|order]], though some [[fossil]] [[genera]] have been found 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 * Order ''Tubulidentata'' 
 ** Family ''Orycteropodidae'' 
 *** Genus ''Orycteropus'' 
 **** Species ''Orycteropus afer'' 
 
 The Aardvark looks a bit like the [[Anteater|South American anteaters]] but they are not related. It is in a proposed [[clade]] Afroinsectiphilia, with the [[golden mole]]s and [[tenrec]]s. Another proposal is to out it in the Pseudungulata, with the elephants and [[Sirenia]]. There is no [[consensus]] at present. 
 
 == Description == 
 Adult aardvarks weighs about 60 [[kilogram]]s (130 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]) and a little more than one [[metre|meter]] (45 [[inch]]es) long. It is the largest member of the [[Proposition|proposed]] [[Cladistics|clade]] [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil. The aardvark's fur is thin. Its hair is short on its head and tail. But, its legs tend to have longer hair. < ref name= " :3 " > {{cite book |last1=Macdonald |first1=David W |title=The Encyclopedia of mammals |date=1984 |publisher=Facts on File |isbn=978-0-87196-871-5 |oclc=10403800 |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10403800 |access-date=21 September 2020 |language=English }} < /ref > 
 
 == Distribution and Habitat == 
 Aardvarks are found in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{cite web |author1=African Wildlife Foundation |title=This insect-eater belongs to the same group of mammals as the elephant. |url=https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/aardvark |website=African Wildlife Foundation |publisher=African Wildlife Foundation |access-date=21 September 2020 |language=en |url-status=live |archive-date=22 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922080144/https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/aardvark }} < /ref >  They are found in every country in sub-Saharan Africa except [[Namibia]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Ghana]] and [[Madagascar]]. < ref name= " IUCN " > {{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Andrew |last2=Lehmann |first2=Thomas |title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Orycteropus afer |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41504/21286437 |website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |publisher=IUCN |access-date=21 September 2020 |language=en |date=21 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-date=30 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930202543/https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41504/21286437 }} < /ref >  It lives in many [[Habitat|habitats]] like [[Savanna|savannas]], [[Grassland|grasslands]], [[Woodland|woodlands]] and [[bushland]]. They have been seen as high as 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) in [[Ethiopia]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Feeding == 
 Aardvarks eat mostly [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. They have a long sticky [[tongue]] which makes it easy to pick up many ants at once. The only [[fruit]] that aardvarks eat is the [[aardvark cucumber]]. < ref name= " :1 " > {{cite book |last1=Grzimek |first1=Bernhard |title=Grzimek's encyclopedia of mammals. |date=1990 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-07-909508-4 |oclc=20014856 |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20014856 |access-date=21 September 2020 |language=en }} < /ref >  They avoid eating the African [[driver ant]] and red ants. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 Aardvarks are [[nocturnal]], which means they are awake at [[wikt:night|night]] and asleep during the [[day]]. The aardvark is a good swimmer. It can dig a [[tunnel]] that is one yard in about five minutes. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  It has many predators such as [[Lion|lions]], [[Leopard|leopards]], [[Cheetah|cheetahs]], [[African wild dog|African wild dogs]], [[Hyaena|hyenas]], and [[Python|pythons]]. < ref name= " :2 " > {{cite book |title=Collier's encyclopedia. 24 vols. |date=1 November 1997 |publisher=Collier's |isbn=978-1-57161-093-5 |oclc=656144659 |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/656144659 |access-date=21 September 2020 |language=en }} < /ref > < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Some humans also hunt aardvarks for [[meat]]. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  Aardvarks can dig fast or run in a zigzag to confuse predators. If all else fails they will attack with their [[Claw|claws]]. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Aardvarks only come together to breed. The [[Gestation|gestation period]] is seven months. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  They give birth to one cub, which is what a baby aardvark is called. The cub weighs around 1.7–1.9 kilograms (3.7–4.2 lb). < ref name= " :1 "  / >  It is born during May–July. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  After 5–6 weeks, hair starts growing on its body. After two weeks, it is able to leave the [[burrow]] to follow its mother. After 9 weeks, it is able to eat [[Termite|termites]]. It is [[Weaning|weaned]] between three months and 16 weeks. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  At six months, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often stay with the mother until the next [[mating season]]. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  It reaches [[sexual maturity]] when it is two years old. < ref name= " :1 "  / >
