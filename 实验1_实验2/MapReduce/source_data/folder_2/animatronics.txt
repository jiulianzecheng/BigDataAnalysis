'''Animatronics''' is to use [[electronics]] and [[robot]]ics in automated, magically moving [[puppet]]s to make them appear to be alive. It is normally used in [[movie]]making, but also in [[theme park]]s and other forms of getting out of boredom. The best things about it and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and stop motion is that it is not a feeling of reality, but are some objects moving in the computer. The technology behind this has become more large and difficult over the years, making the puppets become real.  
 
 The modern era of animatronics began in 1961, when [[Walt Disney]] started developing animatronics for entertainment and film. The first animatronic figure he created was the 9 "  tall  " dancing man "  figure that used older rotating cam technology to create the movement of the figure. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Stan Winston School of Character Arts|url=https://www.stanwinstonschool.com/blog/animatronics-world-review|access-date=2023-02-24|website=www.stanwinstonschool.com}} < /ref >
