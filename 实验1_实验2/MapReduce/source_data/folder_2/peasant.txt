 A '''peasant''' is a name for a [[person]] that worked for others on a farm and never had much [[money]]. They usually wore rough, uncomfortable clothes and lived in small houses. 
 
 The word peasant came from the French word for  " country "  in the [[medieval]] era (15th century). In [[feudalism]] peasants, like other [[farmer]]s, had to be able to do a number of jobs on the farm. They lived in rural areas and made up a large amount of the population. Most peasants could not [[Literacy|read or write]]. They did not usually talk with the higher society unless it was about work. Some were [[Serfdom|serfs]] meaning they were not free to leave their lord's land. 
 
 Male peasants were not the only ones who worked in the fields. Their wives and other woman also worked in the fields if necessary. Female peasants usually did women's work in the house such as cooking, cleaning, making clothes, and looking after children. 
 
 They worked all the time, except sometimes on Sundays they would get a break, and when the harvesting season was over they got a longer break.
