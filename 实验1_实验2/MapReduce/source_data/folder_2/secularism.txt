'''Secularism''', also called '''Secularity,''' is the idea of something being not religious or not connected to a church or other religious organization. An example of this is the government, which is independent of any religion in many states. In some countries, such as [[Pakistan]], [[England]] (though not the rest of the [[UK]]), [[Greece]], [[Iran]] or [[Saudi Arabia]], there is a [[state religion]]. In that case, the government follows the state religion. In contrast, [[India]], [[South Africa]] or the [[United States]] have [[law]]s that religion and government should stay separate. 
 
 In a [[theocracy]] like the [[Vatican City]] and [[Iran]], the priests of religion are the rulers of the country.
