{{For|the fishing term flipping|Casting (fishing)}} 
 '''Flipping''' is a term used in [[economics]]. It is used mainly in the [[United States]] to describe buying something and quickly reselling (or  " flipping " ) it for profit. It can apply to any [[asset]] but is often applied to [[real estate]] and [[initial public offering]]s (IPOs). 
 
 == Real estate == 
 
 Real estate is bought and sold every day. The seller arranges for a [[realtor]] to [[advertise]] and [[Sales|sell]] their [[property]]. The realtor charges between 4 and 7 [[percent]] of the selling [[price]] as a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]. < ref > William Bronchick; Robert Dahlstrom, ''Flipping Properties: Generate Instant Cash Profits in Real Estate'' (Chicago: Dearborn Trade Publishing, Â©2001), p. 1 < /ref >  The [[:wikt:sale|sale]] is conducted between the [[Ownership|owner]] of the property or house, and the [[:en:buyer|buyer]] who wants to [[purchase]] it.  
 
 Flipping is used by real estate [[investor]]s to describe someone purchasing a property then selling it quickly for a profit. Usually the investor will pay for [[:wikt:improvement|improvements]] to make the property more attractive. The investor must have the [[money]] to buy the house and pay for the improvements. Realtors neither buy the house or resell it (although a realtor can also be a flipper). They simply [[broker]] the sale. 
 
 Flipping involves a good deal of [[:wikt:risk|risk]] for investors. < ref name=Forbes > {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencelight/2012/09/21/how-to-flip-a-house-yes-even-in-2012/ |title=How to Flip a House. Yes, Even in 2012 |author=Larry Light |date=21 September 2012 |website= |publisher=Forbes Magazine /Forbes.com |accessdate=18 June 2014 }} < /ref >  They must know the [[value]] of a property and not pay too much. They have to be careful not to invest too much in improvements. Very often run-down properties or [[:en:wikt:foreclosure|foreclosures]] are sold at [[auction]]s. The buyer may not be able to inspect the property before buying it. This can lead to additional costs to fix problems that could not be seen. A property needs to sell quickly or there is no quick return on their money. < ref name=Forbes/ >   
 
 There are also many risks for buyers of flipped homes. < ref > United States Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, ''Property  " flipping " : HUD's failure to curb mortgage fraud'' (Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 2001), p. 1 < /ref > 
 
 == IPOs == 
 
 Initial public offerings are when a private company sells [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[:wikt:stock|stock]] to the public for the first time (called going public). Flipping is buying stocks and selling within the first 2 to 3 days after the company went public. < ref name=Gregoriou159 > Greg N. Gregoriou, ''Initial Public Offerings (IPO): An International Perspective of IPOs'' (Oxford; Burlington, MA: Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006), p. 159 < /ref >  The hope is the price will go up rapidly. [[Underwriting|Underwriters]] want investors want to hold onto stocks. They may [[Blacklisting|blacklist]] investors who flip too many stocks even though it is legal. < ref name=Gregoriou159/ > 
 
 == Other forms ==    
 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] the term is used to describe [[Members of Parliament]] switching their 'second home' between several houses. This was to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179291/MPs-expenses-How-Cabinet-ministers-tens-thousands-flipping-homes.html|title=Cabinet ministers have made tens of thousands 'flipping' their homes
