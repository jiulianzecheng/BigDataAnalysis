{{wiktionary}} 
 In law, '''negligence''' is a kind of [[lawsuit|legal claim]] that people and organizations can bring if they are hurt. It is a kind of [[tort]]. The law calls someone '''negligent''' if he hurts someone else, or someone else's property, because he was not careful enough. In a legal case about negligence, the person who brings the lawsuit is called the [[plaintiff]] and the person who is being sued is called the [[defendant]].

 The law about negligence is different in many places (or [[jurisdiction]]s), < ref > {{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Richard W.|title=The Standards of Care in Negligence Law|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198265795.001.0001/acprof-9780198265795-chapter-12|website=Oxford Scholarship Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 May 2017}} < /ref >  but for the plaintiff to win, he or she usually has to prove at least four things: 
 
 * the defendant had a [[wikt:duty|duty]] to behave in a certain way; 
 * the defendant [[wikt:breach|breached]] that duty; 
 * the plaintiff was ''damaged'', or harmed as a result; and 
 * the breach of duty was the [[wikt:cause|cause]] reasonably predictable cause of the plaintiff's harm. < ref > {{cite web|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 May 2017|archive-date=6 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035306/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 === Duty === 
 
 The defendant's ''duty'' is what the law says that he or she has to do. Usually, the law says that people have to be ''reasonable''. That means they have to be careful, use good judgment, and not be unfair to other people. In some cases, the law tells people that they have special duties. In other cases, the law says that people have no duties at all. For example, in most places that use the [[common law]], a person has no legal duty to rescue another person from harm, even if the rescue is very easy and does not cost anything or put anyone else in danger. < ref > {{cite web|title=Negligence|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligence|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=31 May 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 === Breach === 
 
 When people do not follow their duty, the law says that they ''breach'' their duty. < ref > {{cite web|title=Proving negligence or breach of statutory duty|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/personalinjury/synopsis/448:449/Establishing-legal-liability/Proving-negligence-or-breach-of-statutory-duty|website=Lexis PSL|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=31 May 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 === Harm === 
 
 A plaintiff can usually bring a lawsuit only if he or she has been hurt, or has some other legal harm. The law tells people what kinds of injuries people can sue about. < ref > {{cite web|title=Negligene|url=http://webpage.pace.edu/pacelegalassistance/negligence.htm|website=Pace Legal Assistance|publisher=Pace University|accessdate=31 May 2017|archive-date=3 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603192448/http://webpage.pace.edu/pacelegalassistance/negligence.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 === Cause === 
 
 A plaintiff can usually sue a defendant only if that defendant was the one who hurt the plaintiff. In many cases, it is easy to figure out who hurt someone. But sometimes people get hurt in ways that nobody expects. < ref > {{cite web|title=Cause and Harm|url=https://nationalparalegal.edu/public_documents/courseware_asp_files/torts/negligence2/causeAndHarm1.asp|website=National Paralegal College|accessdate=31 May 2017}} < /ref >  For example, a defendant might be driving while drunk, and he might hit an electric pole. The electric pole could fall down and cause a neighborhood to lose electric power. As a result, a person two miles away might trip and fall in the dark. The law will decide whether the drunk driver ''caused'' the person to trip and fall. 
 
 == Outside the law == 
 
 The word ''negligence'' is sometimes used outside the law in a similar way. It means that someone has not been careful enough. < ref > {{cite web|title=Definition of Negligence|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/negligence|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=31 May 2017}} < /ref >
