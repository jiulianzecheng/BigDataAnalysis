 ==Controversy== 
 
 Human beings have learned more about dolphins and whales since the first SeaWorld was built. People have started to ask whether it is good to keep them in places like SeaWorld.  Scientists say that dolphins and whales need much more space and much more time with other dolphins and whales than people used to think they did. < ref name=BBC > {{cite news|accessdate=July 20, 2021|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160310-why-killer-whales-should-not-be-kept-in-captivity|date=March 10, 2016|title=Why killer whales should not be kept in captivity|publisher=BBC|author=Melissa Hogenboom}} < /ref > < ref name=NatGeo > {{cite news|accessdate=July 20, 2021|publisher=National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/orcas-captivity-welfare|date=March 25, 2019|title=Orcas don’t do well in captivity.

 There have also been accidents.  Sometimes a whale will attack its human trainer.  The mini-series ''[[Blackfish]]'' told the story of an [[orca]] named Tilikum that attacked a trainer named Dawn Brancheau. < ref name=CBS > {{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seaworld-lawsuit-settlement-65-million-lying-investors-blackfish-documentary/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=July 20, 2021|author=Sophie Lewis|title=SeaWorld to pay $65 million settlement to investors over impact of  " Blackfish "  doc|date=February 11, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 People from SeaWorld say that they are doing good things for whales and dolphins by allowing people to see them close up. < ref name=BBC / >
