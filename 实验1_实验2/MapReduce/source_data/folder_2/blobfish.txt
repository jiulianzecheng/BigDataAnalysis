 The '''blobfish''' (''Psychrolutes marcidus'') is three species of a fish of the [[family (biology)|family]] Psychrolutidae. They live in deep waters off the coasts of [[Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]]. < ref name=fishbase > {{FishBase species|genus=Psychrolutes |species=marcidus|month=February|year=2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Blobfish are typically shorter than 30 & nbsp;cm. They live at depths between {{convert|600|and|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}} where the pressure is several dozen times higher than at [[sea level]]. 
 
 Blobfish are often caught accidentally in [[bottom trawling]] nets. Scientists now fear the blobfish could become an [[endangered species]] because of deep-ocean trawling. < ref > {{cite news|title=So you think you've had a bad day?
