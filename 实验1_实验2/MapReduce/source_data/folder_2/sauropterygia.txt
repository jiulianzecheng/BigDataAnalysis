 The '''Sauropterygia''' was a [[superorder]] of successful [[aquatic]] [[reptile]]s that flourished during the [[Mesozoic]] [[era]]. They are united by an [[adaptation]] of their [[shoulder]], designed to support powerful paddle strokes. Some later sauropterygians like the [[pliosaur]]s developed a similar mechanism in their [[pelvis]]. < ref name= " Benton " > Benton M.J. 2004.

 ==Origins and evolution== 
 The earliest sauropterygians appeared about 245 million years ago, at the start of the [[Triassic]] period. At first they were small, less than a metre. They were semi-aquatic lizard-like animals with long limbs (called pachypleurosaurs). They developed into a group called the nothosaurs, several meters long. The sauropterygians included another very distinctive group: the [[placodont]]s. They were bottom-feeders on [[shellfish]], and possessed flat, crushing teeth to handle their [[prey]]. < ref name= " Benton " / > < sup > p148–151 < /sup > 
 
 The [[end-Triassic extinction event]] wiped them all out except for the [[plesiosaur]]s. During the earliest [[Jurassic]] these diversified quickly into the long-necked small-headed plesiosaurs proper, and short-necked large-headed [[pliosaur]]s.
