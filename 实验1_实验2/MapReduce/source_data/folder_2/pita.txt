 '''Pita'''  is a type of [[flatbread]]. Sometimes it is called '''pitta ''' or '''pide''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), '''pitka''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]) and pronounced  " pitta "  in [[Greek language|Greek]] < ref > [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pita & searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] < /ref > ). Pita is often round, brown, [[wheat]] [[flatbread]] made with [[yeast]]. 
 
 Pita is traditionally made in the [[Middle East]] and around the [[Mediterranean]]. It is also used in the cuisines of these countries. It can also be found in [[North Africa]] and the [[Levant]].  
 
 Possibly, it was spread by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[city state]]s colonies, or by the spread of the [[Islam]] through the region.  
 
 In [[Turkish cuisine]], pide may refer to thicker breads made with [[yeast]], for example [[shish kebab]] pide. It may also refer to foods using many thin layers of [[dough]], usually with many different ingredients in between. That way, [[pie]]s such as [[tyropita]] and [[spanakopita]] or sweet pies such as [[baclava]] are made. 
 
 The Indian flatbread form of [[roti]] is sometimes referred to as  " Indian pita " .
