 '''Crocs''' are a type of [[plastic]] [[clogs]]. They have holes in the top of them so your feet can let in air. They also come in many different colours. You can buy different [[accessories]] to clip into the holes of the [[shoe]]. 
 
 The company who make them was founded in 2002 in [[Colorado]]. 
 
 Crocs started to make a comeback during the pandemic as crocs reported a 66.92% percent increase in sales from 2020 alone compared to 2021's sales.
