 The look and feel of the [[animation]] is somewhere between [[Pixar]] and a [[Slipknot]] [[music video]] that’s been burnt on one side and left out in the [[desert]]. The result is something that might play in a dank [[backroom]] of a short [[film festival]] (or out in the open of [[Fantastic Fest]]). < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/short-film-chernokids.php |title=Movie News - Short Film of the Day: Chernokids |access-date=2014-11-28 |archive-date=2015-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612233852/http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/short-film-chernokids.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
