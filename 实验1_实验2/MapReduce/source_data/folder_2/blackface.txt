'''Blackface''' is a kind of costume or make up which involves putting black [[make-up]] on to imitate a [[racism|racist]] [[image]] of a [[Black people|Black]] or [[African American]] person. Blackface became popular in the 19th century especially during [[Reconstruction]] after the [[American Civil War]]. 
 
 By the mid 19th century, blackface [[minstrel show]]s became a distinctive artform. It translated formal works, like opera, into popular terms for general audiences. < ref > {{cite book|title=Behind the Burnt Cork Mask|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orsJVN4dhLsCa|access-date=September 19, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 Early in the 20th century, blackface came off the minstrel show. It became a form in its own right. < ref > {{cite book|title=History of the Minstrel Show|isbn=9780939479214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5cVSVbOu2EC & pg=PA25|access-date=September 19, 2019|last1=Sweet|first1=Frank W.|date=September 2000}} < /ref > 
 
 However, in the [[United States]], blackface became less popular after the civil right movement. It is offensive and [[racism|racist]]. < ref > {{cite news|title=Don't Get What's Wrong with the Blackface?|publisher=Vox|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/29/7089591/why-is-blackface-offensive-halloween-costume|access-date=September 19, 2019}} < /ref >
