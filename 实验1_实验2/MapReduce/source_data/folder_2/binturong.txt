 A '''binturong''' (''Arctictis binturong'') is a large, rare mammal that lives in trees in the dense forests of southeast [[Asia]]. The binturong is also often called a '''bearcat''' because it looks like both a [[bear]] and a [[cat]]. < ref > {{IUCN2008|assessors=Mustelid Specialist Group|year=2008|id=41690|title=Arctictis binturong|downloaded=2008-10-15}} < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 Binturongs have thick, black fur, a long, muscular tail, and long, stiff, white whiskers. They use their prehensile tail almost like another [[hand]]; young binturongs can even hang by their [[tail]]. Binturongs grow to be up to about 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Like other [[civet]]s, the binturongs use scent marks to communicate with other binturongs. In captivity, binturongs live for about 30 years. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Binturongs eat [[fruit]] and small animals that they find using their sense of smell to find food. They hunt for food at night - they are nocturnal.
