'''Shenfield''' is part of the [[conurbation]] of [[Brentwood, Essex]], England. The original town centre < ref > [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51269 & strquery=Shenfield Historical notes on Shenfield: British History Online] < /ref >  is located one mile (1.6 & nbsp;km) north-east of the centre of Brentwood. There are some small industrial areas and a modest, but busy, shopping area. Shenfield serves predominantly as a dormitory town for commuters to [[London]] and surrounding towns such as [[Romford]] and [[Basildon]]. This is facilitated by easy access to the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 Road]], the [[M25 motorway]] and rail services on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]].
