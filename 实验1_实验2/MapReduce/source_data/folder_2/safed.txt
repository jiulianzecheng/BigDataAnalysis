 '''Safed''' ({{lang-he-n|צְפַת}}, ''Tzfat''; {{lang-ar|صفد}}, ''Ṣafad'') is a major city in northern [[Israel]]. It is in the Safed region of the [[Upper Galilee]] Mountains. Safed is an international center for [[Kabbalah]] study. It is one of [[Judaism]]'s four holiest cities, along with [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]] and [[Tiberias]].  
 
 Located at an [[elevation]] of 900 meters (2,953 feet), Safed is the highest city in the [[Galilee]] and in Israel. Due to its high elevation, Safed has warm summers and cold, often snowy, winters. 
 
 Due to its pleasant climate and scenic views surrounded by [[pine]] [[forest]]s, Safed has become a popular holiday resort visited by Israeli and foreign tourists.
