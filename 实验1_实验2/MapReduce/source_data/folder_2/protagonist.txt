A '''protagonist''' is the main [[Fictional character|character]] of a [[story]]. It can be used for any kind of story: in [[literature]], a [[movie]], a [[television]] show or a play. The protagonist is also called the '''central character''' or '''main character''' and is often the '''[[hero]]''' of the story. However, the protagonist does not always win and survive in a story. 
 
 Protagonists are usually [[moral]] and [[Good|benevolent]], helping other characters to change their badness to become good again, or defeating the [[Villain|bad characters]]. This is not always the case. For example, the protagonists in [[Psycho]] and [[Lolita]] are (respectively) a [[serial killer]] and a [[pedophile]]. 
 
 The protagonist's [[name]] can sometimes be in the title of the fiction he or she is in, for example: 
 *In ''[[Harry Potter]]'', Harry Potter is the protagonist. 
 *In the [[anime]] ''[[Naruto (comic)|Naruto]]'' and ''InuYasha'', Naruto and Inuyasha are the protagonists. 
 *In the [[tragedy]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], the [[prince]] Hamlet himself is the protagonist of the story.  
 *In ''[[DC Comics]]'', [[Batman]] is the protagonist.  
 *In ''[[Marvel Comics]]'', [[Spider-Man]] is the protagonist.
