 '''Archaeobatrachia''' is a suborder of [[Frog|Anura]].  It has various primitive [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s. As the name literally suggests, these are the most [[primitive]] frogs. Many of the species (28 in total) show certain body features which are not in other frogs and toads. They are mostly found in [[Eurasia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Borneo]].  
 
 In addition, the family [[Tailed frog|Ascaphidae]] is found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.  They are only represented by two species.
