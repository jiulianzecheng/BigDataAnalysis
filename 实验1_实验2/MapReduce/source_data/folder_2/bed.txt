 A '''bed''' is a piece of [[furniture]] that people [[sleep]] on. It normally has a soft [[mattress]] on a [[bed frame]]. Many beds also have [[bed sheet]]s to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads.  A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size.

 In August 2020 [[archaeologists]] reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from Middle [[Paleolithic]] (at least 200,000 years ago). < ref name=Ash > {{cite news |title=200,000 years ago, humans preferred to sleep in beds |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-08-years-humans-beds.html |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819030258/https://phys.org/news/2020-08-years-humans-beds.html |url-status=live }} < /ref >  This was much older than the oldest previously known bedding.  
 
 They found insect-repellent plants and [[ash]] layers beneath the bedding. This would have made a dirt-free, insulated base which helped to keep away insects. < ref > {{cite news |title=The oldest known grass beds from 200,000 years ago included insect repellents |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-grass-beds-insect-repellent |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=Science News |date=13 August 2020 |archive-date=18 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818123246/https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-grass-beds-insect-repellent |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Wadley |first1=Lyn |last2=Esteban |first2=Irene |last3=Peña |first3=Paloma de la |last4=Wojcieszak |first4=Marine |last5=Stratford |first5=Dominic |last6=Lennox |first6=Sandra |last7=d’Errico |first7=Francesco |last8=Rosso |first8=Daniela Eugenia |last9=Orange |first9=François |last10=Backwell |first10=Lucinda |last11=Sievers |first11=Christine |title=Fire and grass-bedding construction 200 thousand years ago at Border Cave, South Africa |journal=Science |date=14 August 2020 |volume=369 |issue=6505 |pages=863–866 |doi=10.1126/science.abc7239 |pmid=32792402 |s2cid=221113832 |url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/863 |access-date=6 September 2020 |language=en |issn=0036-8075 |archive-date=6 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200906092437/https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/863 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  So early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried [[ferns]]). 
 
 Here's an example of what they said:  " Several cultures have used [[ash]] as an insect repellent because insects cannot easily move through fine powder. Ash blocks insects' breathing and biting apparatus, and eventually [[dehydration|dehydrates]] them. ''Tarchonanthus'' ([[camphor]] bush) remains were on top of the grass from the oldest bedding in the cave. This plant is still used to deter insects in rural parts of East Africa " . < ref name=Ash/ > 
 
 Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in [[Ancient Rome]]. 
 
 In Ancient Egypt, beds were considered to be status symbols. While the lower classes simply slept on a heap of palm bows or straw, the wealthy constructed wood platform beds that were ascended by stairs, were often curtained, and piled high with cushions for comfort. 
 
 In Ancient Rome, the bed was utilized as a multi-purpose reclining surface rather than just a place to sleep. Several beds, or  " dining couches "  were arranged around the perimeter of the home's living space, and friends and family would recline in bed while socializing, studying, and dining.
