 '''''Aucasaurus''''' was a medium-sized [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from [[Argentina]] that lived during the [[Upper Cretaceous]]. It was smaller than its relative ''[[Carnotaurus]]''. It had extremely short arms. Its skeleton is the most complete [[Abelisauridae|abelisaurid]] skeleton discovered so far. However, the skull is damaged, causing some [[paleontologists]] to speculate that it was involved in a fight shortly before it died. 
 
 ==In popular culture== 
 This dinosaur was featured in the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[Dinosaur Planet]]'', where it was depicted as a pack hunter and ate the [[sauropod]] ''[[Saltasaurus]]''. In the episode, the head injury discovered in the type specimen was interpreted as being crushed by a stumbling ''Saltasaurus''.
