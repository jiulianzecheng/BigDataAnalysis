 '''''Thylacosmilus''''' is a extinct [[genus]] of carnivorous [[sparassodont]]. < ref > The [[Sparassodonta]] were actually not marsupials, but a sister group which used to be described as marsupials. < /ref >  found as fossils in deposits dated from about 10 million to 3 million years ago (late [[Miocene]] to late [[Pliocene]] epoch) in [[Argentina]], [[South America]].  
 
 ''Thylacosmilus'' was sabre-toothed and was about as large as a modern [[jaguar]]. To a remarkable degree, ''Thylacosmilus'' paralleled the evolution of [[felid]] [[sabre-toothed cat]]s like ''[[Smilodon]]''. Its [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] were long and powerfully developed; they were used for stabbing prey. Its killing method was to hold its prey, and make deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles. < ref name =  " Hogenboom_2013 " > {{cite web| last = Hogenboom | first = M. | title = Sabretooth killing power depended on thick neck

 ''Thylacosmilus'' died out during the late [[Pliocene]], whereas saber-toothed cats did not get to South America until the middle Pleistocene epoch. < ref > see [[Great American Interchange]]. < /ref > < ref > Prevosti, Francisco J; Forasiepi, Analia  &  Zimicz, Natalia 2013.
