In [[chemistry]], a '''mixture''' is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler [[substance]] < nowiki/ > s. These substances can be [[chemical element]]s or [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. A mixture can be made of [[liquid]]s, [[solid]]s, or [[gas]]es. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Chemistry (IUPAC)|first=The International Union of Pure and Applied|title=IUPAC - mixture (M03949)|url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/M03949|access-date=2021-05-11|website=goldbook.iupac.org|doi=10.1351/goldbook.M03949 }} < /ref > 
 ==Characteristics== 
 A mixture is not the same as a [[Chemical compound|compound]] which is made of two or more [[atom]]s connected together. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25401134|title=General chemistry|last=Whitten|first=Kenneth W.|date=1992|publisher=Saunders College Pub|others=Kenneth D. Gailey, Raymond E. Davis|isbn=0-03-072373-6|edition=4th|location=Fort Worth|oclc=25401134}} < /ref >  For instance, a mixture of the gases [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]] contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound [[ammonia]] which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. 
 
 A mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called ''heterogenous'', one where this is not the case is called ''homogeneous''. A third form is called [[colloid]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46872308|title=General chemistry : principles and modern applications.|last=Petrucci|first=Ralph H.|date=2002|publisher=Prentice Hall|others=William S. Harwood, F. Geoffrey Herring|isbn=0-13-014329-4|edition=8th|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=46872308}} < /ref > 
 
 If one substance in a mixture [[dissolution|dissolves]] in the other, it is called a [[solution]]. For example, if [[sugar]] is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. 
 
 Solids can be mixtures also. [[Alloy]] < nowiki/ > s are mixtures. Many kinds of [[soil]] and [[mineral|rock]] are mixtures of different [[mineral]]s. Thus, a mixture is made of two or more elements and/or compounds which are not chemically combined. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of mixture - Chemistry Dictionary|url=https://www.chemicool.com/definition/mixture.html|access-date=2021-05-11|website=www.chemicool.com}} < /ref >
