 '''Floaters''' or '''eye floaters''' are small dots in the field of vision of a person. They are transparent and between the [[eye]]'s [[Vitreous body|vitreous humour]] or between the vitreous and [[retina]]. Their medical name is ''muscae volitantes'' (Latin for 'flying flies'), or ''mouches volantes'' (French for 'flying flies'). < ref > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtDhOJJYkkU Adult Eye Health: Mayo Clinic Radio (5 minutes in to 8 minute talk)] < /ref >  All people will get them over time, < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://coopervision.com/blog/eye-floaters-how-do-we-get-them#:~:text=These%20are%20eye%20floaters%20and,indicate%20a%20more%20serious%20condition. & text=Many%20people%20think%20eye%20floaters,this%20is%20not%20the%20case.|title=Eye Floatersâ€“How do we get them? {{!}} CooperVision|website=coopervision.com|access-date=2020-07-25}} < /ref >  but not all will notice them.

 == Origin == 
 The vitreous, a jelly-like material inside the eyeball, becomes more liquid. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-floaters/multimedia/eye-floaters/img-20008145|title=Eye floaters|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2020-07-25}} < /ref >  This happens when people age. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  But young people can also get them. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  When this happens, small collagen fibers and vitreous form to clumps. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  These clumps throw shadows onto the retina. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  These shadows are floaters. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 Laser vitreolysis is a possible treatment option for the removal of floaters.
