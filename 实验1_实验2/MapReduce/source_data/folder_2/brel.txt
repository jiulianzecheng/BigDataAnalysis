'''BREL''' stands for '''British Rail Engineering Limited''', which was the [[engineering]] division for [[British Rail]] until the design and building trains in the [[United Kingdom]] went private.  
 
 They made trains like the [[British Rail Class 210]] [[diesel multiple unit]] and the experimental  '''[[Advanced Passenger Train]]''' ('''APT''')  tilting High Speed Train during the 1970s and early 1980s.
