 '''Calamari''' is [[squid]] that is prepared to be eaten. It can be prepared in several ways. Most common is deep [[frying]] or [[saut√©ing]] after coating the rings with [[batter]]. If deep fried, it is done for less than two minutes to prevent toughness. It is usually served with a [[dip]], [[mayonnaise]] or something similar. Calamari is a standard dish in Italian restaurants, served as a starter.
