 '''Shoemaking''' is the process of making [[footwear]]. Originally, shoes were made by [[handicraft]]. Few people buy shoes made by old-fashioned methods anymore, preferring cheaper ones made by [[industry |industrial]] [[mass production]]. The old methods are still used for buyers who want unusually high [[quality]]. Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, [[boot]]s, [[sandal (footwear)|sandal]]s, [[clogs]] and [[moccasin]]s. Such items are generally made of [[leather]], [[wood]], [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[jute]] or other plant material. 
 
 A '''cordwainer''' is a '''shoemaker''' who makes very fine soft leather shoes. A '''cobbler''' is someone who repairs shoes. < ref name= " IntrotoPoetry " > {{cite book |last= Driscoll |first=Michael |author2= Meredith Hamiltion, and Marie Coons |title=A Child's Introduction to Poetry |publisher= Black Dog  &  Leventhal Publishers |location= 151 West 19th Street New York, NY 10011 |date=May 2003 |page=12 |isbn=1-57912-282-5 |url= http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829 }} < /ref >
