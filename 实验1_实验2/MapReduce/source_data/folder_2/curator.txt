 A '''curator''' or '''keeper''' looks after collections. It may be a private activity, but usually they look after the collections of a [[cultural heritage]] institution. [[Art gallery|Art galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[libraries]] or [[archive]]s have curators. [[Zoo]]s have [[zookeeper]]s and underkeepers. 
 
 Curators are subject-matter experts who act as managers. It is an official job description in institutions which have collections. The curator's work involves [[object]]s of some kind, such as artwork, collectibles, historic items or scientific collections. Curators in [[zoo]]s are usually called 'keepers', but it is the same idea. 
 
 The word '''curator''' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''curare'', meaning to look after.
