'''Nonmetal'''s or '''non-metal'''s are [[chemical element]]s which do not have the properties of a [[metal]].  
 
 They gain electrons when reacting with a metal. They are generally not lustrous and are bad conductors of heat and electricity. Some are [[gas]]es including: [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[fluorine]], [[neon]] or [[radon]] and others.  An example of a [[solid]] that is a nonmetal is [[sulfur]]. It is yellow and not shiny at all. An example of a [[liquid]] that is a nonmetal is [[bromine]]. It is red. A non-metal is a good [[thermal insulation|insulator]] for heat and cold. Usually, gases or brittle solids are non-metals.  
 
 Elements on the periodic table can be classified as metal, [[semimetal]], or non-metal. Five times more elements are metals than nonmetals. However, nonmetals are abundant and important.  Two of the nonmetals—[[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]—make up over 99 per cent of the observable [[Universe]], and one—[[oxygen]]—makes up close to half of the [[Earth's crust]], [[oceans]] and [[atmosphere]]. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more [[chemical compound|compounds]] than metals.
