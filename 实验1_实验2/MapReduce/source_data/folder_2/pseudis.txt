 '''''Pseudis''''' or the '''swimming frogs''' are a [[genus]] of frogs that live in [[South America]]. They are in the family [[Hylidae]]. < ref name=frost/ >  They are important because they have the largest [[tadpole]]s of any frog in the world. The adult frogs are not much bigger than other frogs, but the tadpoles are giant. Human beings hear these frogs more than they see them.  This is because the frogs sing loud but [[camouflage|blend into the water and plants]] so they are hard to see. The frogs live in lakes, ponds, [[marsh]]es, and other bodies of waters that have many plants in them.  These frogs sit near the top of the water, hiding in the plants or on floating plants. This frog will dive into the water if they see something that looks dangerous to them. < ref name=Halliday2016 > {{cite book | author=Halliday, T. | year=2016 | title=The Book of Frogs: A Life-Size Guide to Six Hundred Species from around the World | url=https://archive.org/details/bookoffrogslifes0000hall | page=[https://archive.org/details/bookoffrogslifes0000hall/page/320 320] | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0226184654 }} < /ref > < ref name=Fabrezi2009 > {{cite journal| author1=Fabrezi, M. | author2=S.I.

 ==Distribution== 
 ''Pseudis'' frogs live in tropical and subtropical South America.  Almost all of them live east of the [[Andes]], on the Atlantic side of South America. ''P. paradoxa'' is the only species in ''Pseudis'' that has any frogs living west of the Andes. These frogs live from [[Trinidad]] to northern Argentina but not in Ecuador or Chile. They live in hills and other highland regions, and they live in the southernmost part of South America. All species in this genus are found in Brazil. < ref name=frost > {{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Anura/Hylidae/Pseudinae/Pseudis |title=''Pseudis'' Wagler, 1830 |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2013 |work=Amphibian Species of the World 5.6, an Online Reference |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |access-date=11 December 2013}} < /ref > < ref name=Garda2010 > {{cite journal| author1=Garda, A.

 These frogs have several [[adaptation|body parts]] that help them live in the water.  They have eyes that stick up and out, strong hind legs, and fully [[webbing|webbed]] feet. < ref name= " GARDA " / >  Scientists say they are still  " true "  tree frogs, so they are in the family [[Hylidae]]. < ref name=frost/ > 
 
 ===Breeding and feeding=== 
 Frogs in ''Pseudis'' find mates and lay eggs the same way most frogs do. However, their [[tadpole]]s are different.  The tadpoles start live normal, but they continue growing until they are very, very large, sometimes as large as {{convert|22-27|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} in length in ''P. paradoxa'' and ''P. platensis''. < ref name=Fabrezi2009/ > < ref name=Garda2010/ > < ref name=Bokermann1967 > {{cite journal| author=Bokermann, W.C.A. | year=1967 | title=Girinos de anfíbios brasileiros—3: sôbre um girino gigante de Pseudis paradoxa (Amphibia, Pseudidae) | journal=Revista Brasileira de Biologia | volume=27 | pages=209–212 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal | last1 = Emerson | first1 = S.

It is smaller when it [[metamorphosis|becomes a frog]]. < ref name=Santana2016/ >  In most of these frogs, tadpoles from different places can be different sizes. Tadpoles that grow in large, temporary bodies of waters with plenty of food and few [[predator|animals that want to eat them]] grow larger than those in smaller bodies of water with less food, or year-round bodies of waters that may have fish or other animals that eat tadpoles in them. < ref name=Garda2010/ >  The very largest tadpoles usually have well-developed organs, including reproductive organs that are almost ready to be used. This means that the frogs are ready to mate very soon after becoming frogs.  This is different from most genuses of frogs: In most species, the tadpoles become small frogs and then grow larger before they can mate and lay eggs. < ref name=Fabrezi2009/ > < ref name=Garda2010/ > < ref name=Downie2009 > {{cite journal| author1=Downie, J.R. | author2=K.

 ''Pseudis'' is closely related to the genus, ''[[Lysapsus]]''.  The frogs in ''Lysapsus'' do not have giant tadpoles. In ''Lysapsus'', adults frogs grow to {{cvt|2.5|cm|in|1}}. < ref name=Garda2010/ > < ref name= " GARDA " / >

 ==Species== 
 [[File:Pseudis bolbodactyla02a.jpg|thumb|''[[Pseudis bolbodactyla|P. bolbodactyla]]'', one of several species formerly included in ''P. paradoxa'']] 
 
 There are seven species in this genus if we think of ''Lysapsus'' as a different genus. Until the late 1990s and early 2000s, most scientists said only ''P. minuta'' and ''P. paradoxa'' counted as frogs in ''Pseudis''.  Scientists wrote the first paper about ''P. cardosoi''. Before that, scientists thought ''P. cardosoi'' was the same frog as ''P. minuta''. All the other species remaining were thought to be [[subspecies]], [[Synonym (biology)|synonyms]] or populations of ''P. paradoxa''. < ref name=frost/ >  Not all scientists agree that ''P. platensis'' is not the same frog as ''P. paradoxa''. < ref name=Garda2010/ >

 ==Phylogenetic relationships== 
 Scientists argue about how these frogs are [[phylogenetic|related]] to other frogs and toads.  In the 19th and 20th centuries, scientists could only looking at animals' [[cladistics|bodies]], the way they acted, and [[fossil]]s to figure out how they were related to each other.  Then [[DNA]] technology became strong enough to help scientists look at the animals' genes.  These frogs were very hard for scientists to put in groups before DNA technology became strong. 
 
 Over the years, scientists have said theys hould be in [[Ranidae]], [[Leptodactylidae]], < ref > NOBLE, G. K. 1922. The phylogeny of Salientia. I. The osteology and thigh musculature; their bearing on classification and phylogeny. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History. 46:1-87. < /ref >  [[Hylidae]], < ref > PARKER, H. W. 1935. The frogs, lizards, and snakes of British Guiana. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. 505-530. < /ref >  and in their own family, Pseudidae, by themselves. < ref > SAVAGE, J. M., and A. L. DE CARVALHO. 1953. The family position of neotropical frogs currently referred to the genus ''Pseudis''. Zoologica. 38:193-200. < /ref >  It has been difficult for scientists to say where these frogs belong in [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] because their bodies are very different from those of other hylid frogs. The bodies of ''Pseudis'' frogs are different from other tree frogs' bodies because ''Pseudis'' frogs spend much more time living in water than most tree frogs do. 
 
 However, in the early 20th century, scientists did more studies.  Both body-shape-based < ref name= " DA SILVA " > DA SILVA, H. R. 1998. Phylogenetic relationships of the family Hylidae with emphasis on the relationships within the subfamily Hylinae (Amphibia: Anura). Department of Systematics and Ecology. University of Kansas. < /ref >  and molecular (DNA) < ref > DARST, C. R., and D. C. CANNATELLA. 2004. Novel relationships among hyloid frogs inferred from 12S and 16S mitochondrial DNA sequences. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 31:462-475. < /ref >  scientific experiments showed that these frogs are more closely related to tree frogs than to other frogs.  So scientists put them in the subfamily Hylinae with ''[[Scarthyla]]'' as a sister group. 
 
 Since then, two teams of scientists used [[molecular genetics]] ([[DNA]]) to find how this frog is related to other frogs. < ref name= " GARDA " > GARDA, A. A., and D. C. CANNATELLA. 2007. Phylogeny and biogeography of paradoxical frogs (Anura, Hylidae, Pseudae) inferred from 12S and 16S mitochondrial DNA. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution.

Cladistics. 23:455-463. < /ref >  Both teams found the same thing, but they had different ideas about how the frogs should be [[taxonomy (biology)|put into groups]]: One team said scientists should start using the genus ''Podonectes'' again < ref name= " GARDA " / >  and the other team said they should use ''Lysapsus'' as a [[junior synonym]] of ''Pseudis''. < ref name= " AGUIAR " / >  Later, more teams of scientists said ''Pseudis'' was not [[paraphyletic]] to ''Lysapsus'', so making Lysapsus a junior synonym would not be good. < ref name=frost/ >
