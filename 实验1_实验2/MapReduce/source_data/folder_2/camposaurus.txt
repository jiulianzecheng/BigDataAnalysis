 '''''Camposaurus''''' is a [[dinosaur]] from the [[Late Triassic]] of [[North America]]. It is a relative of ''[[Coelophysis]]''. This relationship was upheld by a recent [[phylogenetic]] anlysis. < ref name=Ezcurra/ > 
 
 With [[fossil]]s dating back to 205–210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neo[[theropod]]. It is known from partial lower [[leg]] bones and other fragmentary material. < ref name=Ezcurra/ > < ref > A.P. Hunt ''et al.'' 1998. Late Triassic dinosaurs from the western United States. ''Géobios'' '''31'''(4): 511-531 < /ref >   
 
 A study of ''Camposaurus arizoniensis'' by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. < ref name=Ezcurra >  Ezcurra M.D. and Brusatte S.L. 2011. Taxonomic and phylogenetic reassessment of the early neotheropod dinosaur ''Camposaurus arizonensis'' from the late Triassic of North America. ''Palaeontology'' '''54''' (4): 763–772.  < /ref >  This meant the specimen was a valid [[genus]] and species. ''Camposaurus'' is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is ''[[Megapnosaurus]] rhodensis'', because they share similarities in the [[tibia]], and ankle. < ref name=Ezcurra/ >  Spielman et al. (2007) put ''Camposaurus'' in the family [[Coelophysidae]]. < ref > Spielmann J.A. ''et al'' 2007. Oldest records of the Late Triassic theropod dinosaur Coelophysis bauri. In S.G. Lucas  &  J.A.
