 A '''roof''' is the top surface of the [[building]]. < ref name=M-W > {{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/roof |title=roof |author= |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |accessdate=January 16, 2017}} < /ref >  The plural of 'roof' is 'roofs'. < ref name=M-W/ >  The roof keeps out [[rain]] and [[snow]] and protects people from the [[sun]]. Some roofs are [[:wikt:slope|sloped]], or [[:wikt:pitch|pitched]], so the rain and snow fall off easily. Some roofs are flat, but even flat roofs have a little bit of pitch so the water can flow away towards a drain.
