 '''''Bobinogs''''' (original [[Welsh language|Welsh]] title: '''''Bobinogi''''') is a British children's [[television]] programme that was shown on [[CBeebies]]. It was first shown in Kent at The Romney Marsh Visitor Centre, then the rest of the United Kingdom in February 2008. At first, the main characters (Ogi, Bobin and Nib) lived in the Romney Marsh Visitor Centre in a shape of a blue bobble hat and were Born in April 1940 and then with a child named Owen (played by David Bursey), and were inanimate without him. Owen was later removed from the series so the characters were always shown living. 
 
 The three main characters play in a band. They try to solve a problem in most episodes. In the episode, they find a clue to solve it by looking through their  " Bobinoculars " , which show [[video]] footage from the real world. A song about the problem is played at the end of the episode.
