 [[File:Universe_expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory states that the universe originally expanded from a point.]] 
 In [[astronomy]], cosmogony is the study of the origin of things like the universe, the [[Solar System]], or the Earth–Moon system. < ref name= " DicAstro2 " / > < ref name= " CosmoToday2 " / >  The popular [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Scientific theory|model]] for the birth of the [[universe]] is the [[Big Bang]] theory. < ref name= " Wollack " > {{Cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|date=10 December 2010|website=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archive-date=14 May 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=27 April 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 It is generally accepted that the universe began as a [[singularity]], and when the singularity of the universe started to expand, the Big Bang occurred, which began the universe. 
 
 People disagree on the origins of the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/#.XMQHyM9KhmA|title=A Universe from Nothing?|last=Carroll|first=Sean|date=28 April 2012|website=Science for the Curious|access-date=22 April 2019|archive-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510012738/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/#.XMQHyM9KhmA|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 It may be like a [[black hole]], which is a singularity since[[gravity]] in a black hole becomes boundless. 
 
 Others like [[Stephen Hawking]] say  " time "  did not exist and was only born with the universe. Hence the universe does not have an origin story. Time did not exist before the creation of the universe. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|title=Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|last2=Carroll|first2=Sean M.|publisher=Pearson|year=2003}} < /ref > 
 
 There is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck time]]). This is because we lack a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Still, some researchers in [[string theory]], [[M-theory|M theory]], and loop quantum cosmology have some ideas. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/research-strings.html|title=String Theory/Holography/Gravity|website=Center for Theoretical Physics|access-date=20 April 2019}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|title=String Theory and M-Theory|last1=Becker|first1=Katrin|last2=Becker|first2=Melanie|last3=Schwartz|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|location=Cambridge, UK}} < /ref > 
 
 === Mythology === 
 There are certain myths that also propose how the universe was created: for example [[creation myth]]s in the [[Bible]], the [[Dào Dé Jīng]], and other genesis stories. These usually involve 
 
 * a [[God|supreme being]] or god 
 * birth via sex between male and female gods 
 * or birth via the cosmic egg < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/creation-myth#ref1239147|title=Creation Myth|last=Long|first=Charles|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 April 2019}} < /ref > 
 
 The Eridu Genesis, written on Sumerian tablets, is one of the oldest creation myths. The universe was created from a sea (Abzu). < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eridu-Genesis|title=Eridu Genesis Mesopotamia Epic|date=20 July 1998|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc|access-date=30 April 2019}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Charles|date=1897|title=The Primeval Ocean|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|volume=49|pages=12–17|jstor=4062253}} < /ref >  In [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] created the universe from [[chaos (mythology)|chaos]]. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mythology Contemporary Approaches to Classical and World Myths, 4th ed.|last1=Thury|first1=Eva|last2=Devinney|first2=Margaret|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|location=Madison Avenue, New York|pages=4, 187}} < /ref >  Aztec creation has four versions of earth being created and destroyed, before settling the fifth and current earth. In Bushongo creation, the great god Bumba vomited up the sun, then the earth and everything else. 
 
 == It is not the same as cosmology == 
 [[Cosmology]] studies the universe in general. You can still study the universe without thinking about its origin, which is what cosmonogy studies specifically. < ref name= " Wollack " / > < ref name= " :1 " / > < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Smeenk|first1=Christopher|last2=Ellis|first2=George|date=Winter 2017|title=Philosophy of Cosmology|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/cosmology/|access-date=30 April 2019}} < /ref >
