'''Estrogen''' or '''oestrogen''' is a group of [[female]] [[hormone]]s. < ref > The word comes from the Greek ''οἶστρος'', meaning ''gadfly''. Its use here is not literal. < /ref >  It includes [[oestrone]] (E1), [[oestradiol]] (E2), and [[oestriol]] (E3). Oestradiol is the most important oestrogen. Oestrogen is mainly secreted by the [[ovary]], a small amount by the [[liver]], [[adrenal gland|adrenal cortex]], and [[breast]]. In [[pregnancy]], the [[placenta]] can also have a lot of [[secretion]]. Male [[teste]]s also secrete a small amount. Ovary mainly secretes β-estradiol, other estrogens are less important. < ref > Whitehead S.A.  &  Nussey S. 2001. ''Endocrinology: an integrated approach''.

 Oestrogen helps women grow during [[puberty]] and is part of the [[menstrual cycle]]. During [[menopause]], oestrogen levels go down. The male hormone that is similar is [[androgen]].
