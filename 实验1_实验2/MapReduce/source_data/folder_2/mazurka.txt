 The '''Mazurka''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[country dance]].  It comes from an area called [[Mazovia]] near [[Warsaw]] where the people are called Mazurs.  It was known in the [[16th century]].  In the [[17th century]] its popularity spread all over Poland and by the [[19th century]] it was becoming known in [[England]] and then the [[United States]].  The Mazurka is very similar to the '''Kujawiak''' which is a dance from another district near Warsaw. 
 
 The Mazurka is a lively dance in 3/4 [[metre]].  It has lots of dotted [[rhythm]]s and the fourth [[note (music)|note]] of the [[Scale (music)|scale]] is often [[sharps and flats|sharpened]].   The dancers often click their [[heel]]s on the 2nd or 3rd beat of the [[Bar (music)|bar]].  The speed is not always fast, it can be slow, but it is a wilder dance than the [[waltz]] which is also in 3/4 time and had become very popular as a ballroom dance. 
 
 The [[composer]] [[Frédéric Chopin]] wrote more than 50 mazurkas for the piano.  Chopin really shows his [[genius]] in these pieces.  They are very beautiful  and there is a lot of variety and interest in them.  Many of them are not all that difficult to play.  Some of them have very [[chromaticism|chromatic]] bits in them. 
 
 There were other [[Classical music|classical composers]] who wrote Mazurkas, but none of them are as good as those of Chopin.  Some [[Russia]]n composers like [[Mikhael Glinka|Glinka]] and [[Tchaikovsky]] wrote several mazurkas.  It was danced a lot in Russia in the 19th century and it is mentioned a lot in Russian [[novel]]s.  In the [[20th century]] [[Karol Szymanowski]] wrote several mazurkas.
