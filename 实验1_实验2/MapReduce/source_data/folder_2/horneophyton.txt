 '''''Horneophyton''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Devonian|early Devonian]] [[fossil]] [[land plant]]s. Its fossils are very common in the [[Rhynie chert]]. Both the [[sporophyte]] and a female [[gametophyte]] have been found as fossils. The sporophyte was about 20 cm tall, and the gametophyte was about 6 cm tall. It is not really a [[vascular plant]]. It had [[vascular tissue]] but the [[cell]]s had thin walls. 
 
 ''Horneophyton'' had [[plant anatomy|anatomy]] similar to the [[hornwort]]s. It is also similar to the vascular plant ''[[Rhynia]]'' which lived at the same time. It might therefore be a [[missing link]] between the [[Bryophyte]]s like hornworts and the vascular plants like ''Rhynia''.
