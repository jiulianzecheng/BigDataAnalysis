A '''surface''' is the outer part of something. Most surfaces have a [[width]] and a [[length]], but no [[depth]]. < ref > Another way to say this is  " Most surfaces are [[2D|two-dimensional]]. The two dimensions are [[width]] and [[length]]. " < /ref >   
 
 Surfaces are [[Research|studied]] in [[geometry]].  
 
 == Examples of Surfaces == 
 * An [[apple]] has a skin on its surface.  
 * People live on the Earth's surface.  
 * A piece of [[metal]] is put in [[red]] [[paint]]. The metal is taken out of the paint. After, the outside of the piece of metal is red. The parts of the metal that are now red are called the ''surface'' of the [[wikt:object|object]]. 
 * [[Boat]]s move on the surface of the [[sea]]. 
 * Small insects can walk on the surface of the water, because of [[surface tension]].
