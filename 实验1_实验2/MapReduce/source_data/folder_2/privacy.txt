 '''Privacy''' is the ability to choose what [[information]] or personal [[data]] is hidden and who it's hidden from. 
 
 Privacy [[Law|laws]] in many countries give the right not to be unfairly subjected to invasions of privacy.  
 
 The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says that privacy is a [[Human rights|human right]]. < ref > [https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/03/udhr.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A7%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22FitBH%22%7D%2C659%5D Universal Declaration of Human Rights] '''Article 12''' No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. < /ref > 
 
 == Importance == 
 Everyone wants to keep things about them private. 
 
 Some people want to keep their [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[Opinion|opinions]] private so that they don't get in trouble with their [[government]], the people they know, or both.

 Many things on the internet are tracked and sometimes sold by different groups of people.
