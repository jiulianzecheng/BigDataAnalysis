 '''''Tylosaurus''''' was an [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[mosasaur]]. It was a  large, predatory marine [[lizard]] closely related to modern [[monitor lizard]]s and to [[snakes]].  
 
 In 1918, Charles H. Sternberg found a ''Tylosaurus'' with the remains of a [[plesiosaur]] in its stomach. < ref name= " oceansofkansas.com " > {{cite web|url=http://www.oceansofkansas.com/Tylo-prey.html |title=Tylosaur food |publisher=Oceansofkansas.com |accessdate=2013-01-28}} < /ref >  The specimen is mounted in the United States National Museum ([[Smithsonian]]). The plesiosaur remains are stored in the collections.  
 
 Although these important specimens were briefly reported by C.H. Sternberg in 1922, the information was lost to science until 2001. The specimen was rediscovered and described by Everhart. It is the basis for the story line in the new (2007) National Geographic IMAX movie - ''Sea Monsters''. < ref >  Everhart M.J. 2005.
