 In [[ecology]], '''predation''' describes a relationship and actions between two creatures. A '''predator''' catches, attacks, and eats its '''prey'''. < ref name= " Ecology " > Begon M; Townsend C.  &  Harper J. 1996. ''Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities''. 3rd ed, Blackwell Science, London. {{ISBN|978-0-86542-845-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-632-03801-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-632-04393-4}} < /ref >  Predators may or may not kill their prey before eating them. But the act of predation always causes the death of its prey and taking in the prey's body parts into the predators body. A true predator can be thought of as one which both kills and eats another animal, but many animals act as both predator and [[scavenger]]. 
 
 A '''predator''' is an [[animal]] that [[hunt]]s, catches, and eats other animals. For example, a [[spider]] eating a fly caught at its web is a predator, or a pack of [[lions]] eating a buffalo. The animals that the predator hunts are called '''prey'''. Predators mostly do not eat other predators. < ref > {{Cite web|date=3 March 2018|title=Why Don't Predators Often Eat Other Predators? - Londolozi Blog|url=https://blog.londolozi.com/2018/03/03/why-dont-predators-often-eat-other-predators/}} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite web |title=Carnivore |url=https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/carnivore/ |website=education.nationalgeographic.org |accessdate=20 September 2023 |language=en}} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite web |title=Do predators eat each other? {{!}} SiOWfa16: Science in Our World: Certainty and Controversy |url=https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa16/2016/10/29/do-predators-eat-each-other/ |website=sites.psu.edu |accessdate=20 September 2023}} < /ref >  It has also been suggested that they know it may transmit disease.  < ref > {{cite web |title=Carnivores know that eating other carnivore carcasses transmits diseases |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-12-carnivores-carnivore-carcasses-transmits-diseases.html |website=phys.org |accessdate=20 September 2023 |language=en}} < /ref >  A ''top predator'' or ''[[apex predator]]'' is one that is not the prey of other predators. 
 
 Predators are usually [[carnivore]]s (meat-eaters) or [[omnivore]]s (eats plants and other animals). Predators will hunt other animals for [[food]]. Examples of predators are [[hawk]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s, [[Felidae|cat]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[snake]]s, [[raptor]]s, [[wolves]], [[killer whales]], [[lobster]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[shark]]s.

 '''Ambush predators''' or '''sit-and-wait predators''' are [[carnivore|carnivorous animals]] or other organisms, such as some [[carnivorous plant]]s. They capture or trap prey by stealth or strategy (not conscious strategy), rather than just by speed or strength. 
 
 These organisms usually hide quiet and wait for prey to come within striking distance. They often are [[camouflage]]d, and may be solitary. This may be safer for the predator, because lying in wait exposes it less to its own predators. 
 
 When a predator cannot move faster than its preferred prey, [[ambush]]ing its prey is likely to be more efficient than pursuit. A predator that can move at high speed for a long time can be a pursuit predator, chasing until its prey tires and slows. There are however many intermediate strategies; for example when a pursuit predator is faster than its prey over a short distance, but not in a long chase, then either [[stalking]] or ambushing becomes part of the strategy. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Inon Scharf, Einat Nulman, Ofer Ovadia  &  Amos Bouskila |year=2006 |title=Efficiency evaluation of two competing foraging modes under different conditions |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=168 |issue=3 |pages=350â€“357 |url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/~oferovad/library/Scharf06ForMod.pdf |doi=10.1086/506921 |pmid=16947110 |s2cid=13809116 |access-date=2014-03-08 |archive-date=2015-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923184646/http://www.bgu.ac.il/~oferovad/library/Scharf06ForMod.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
