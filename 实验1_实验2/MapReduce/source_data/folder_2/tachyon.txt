A '''tachyon''' is any [[Theoretical Particle|hypothetical particle]] that can travel faster than the [[speed of light]].  
 
 Most scientists do not believe that tachyons exist. Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]] states that nothing can accelerate faster than the speed of light, while tachyons are theorized to be constantly traveling faster than the speed of light. If a tachyon did exist, it would have an [[imaginary number]] as its [[mass]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[E. C. George Sudarshan|E. C. G. Sudarshan]], V.K Deshpande and Baidyanath Misra were the first to propose the existence of particles faster than light and named them  " meta-particles " . After that the possibility of particles moving faster than light was also proposed by Robert Ehrlich and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], independently of each other. Lately, Similar concept was coined with the term  " tachyon "  by [[:en:Gerald_Feinberg|Gerald Feinberg]] in  1967. < ref name= " Feinberg67 " > Feinberg G. 1967. Possibility of faster-than-light particles. ''Physical Review'' '''159''' (5): 1089â€“1105. [https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089]. See also Feinberg's later paper: Phys. Rev. D 17, 1651 (1978) < /ref > 
 
 In September 2011, it was reported that a [[tau neutrino]] had traveled faster than the speed of light in a major release by [[CERN]]; however, later updates from CERN on the OPERA project indicate that the faster-than-light readings were resultant from  " a faulty element of the experiment's fibre optic timing system " . < ref >

 ==Other meaning: imaginary mass field== 
 In modern physics the term  " tachyon "  often refers to [[imagination|imaginary]] mass fields rather than to faster-than-light particles. < ref name=Randall > Lisa Randall, Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions, p.286:  " People initially thought of tachyons as particles traveling faster than the speed of light...But we now know that a tachyon indicates an instability in a theory that contains it. Regrettably, for science fiction fans, tachyons are not real physical particles that appear in nature. " < /ref > < ref name=Sen > A. Sen 2002. Rolling tachyon. ''Journal of High Energy Physics''.  0204 (2002) 048 < /ref >  The idea of those mass fields, comes in part from [[Quantum field theory]], and [[Classical field theory]]. 
 
 Imaginary mass fields fields have come to play an important role in modern physics.
