 '''''Triceratops''''' was a huge [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[Ceratopsia|ceratopsid]] [[dinosaur]] from the late [[Cretaceous]]. Its name came from having three horns on its head. < ref > [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tri'' = three + ''keratops'' = horned face < /ref >  They were mainly found in [[North America]]. As adults, they grew up to {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, and probably weighed around {{convert|12|t|lb|abbr=on}}. Fully-grown, their skull was enormous (two meters long and nearly a meter wide). < ref > Skull of large ''Triceratops'' up for auction. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-58421356] < /ref >   
 
 ''Triceratops'' was a low [[browser]] with a bony beak in front of its jaws. The jaws had close-set grinding teeth. Its defence had to stand up to attacks from taller [[theropods]], hence the bony shield which covered its neck. Holes made by teeth have been found on the bony frill behind the horns, and on the [[sacrum]] (the part of the spine above the [[pelvis]]). 
 
 Many fossils of ''Triceratops'' have been collected since the [[genus]] was first described in 1889. There is at least one complete individual skeleton. < ref name= " fujiwara2009 "  / >  Paleontologist John Scannella observed:  " It is hard to walk out into the [[Hell Creek Formation]] and not stumble upon a ''Triceratops'' weathering out of a hillside " . Forty-seven complete or partial skulls were discovered in just that area during the decade 2000–2010. < ref name= " newsci " > {{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727713.500-morphosaurs-how-shapeshifting-dinosaurs-deceived-us.html?full=true |title=Morph-osaurs: how shape-shifting dinosaurs deceived us - life - 28 July 2010 |doi=10.1080/02724634.2010.483632 |publisher=New Scientist |s2cid=86767957 |accessdate=2010-08-03}} < /ref >  Specimens showing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found. < ref name= " Lambert93 " > {{cite book|title=The ultimate dinosaur book|year=1993|author=Lambert D.|pages=152–167|publisher=Dorling Kindersley, New York|isbn=1-56458-304-X}} < /ref > 
 
 == Body == 
 === Size === 
 Individual ''Triceratops'' were about 7.9 to 9.0 & nbsp;[[metre|m]] (26.0–29.5 & nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]) in length, 2.9 to 3.0 & nbsp;m (9.5–9.8 & nbsp;ft) in height, < ref name= " dinodict " > {{cite web |url=http://www.dinodictionary.com/dinos_tpg2.asp |title=T Dinosaurs Page 2 |publisher=DinoDictionary.com |accessdate=2010-08-03 |archive-date=2018-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007090033/http://www.dinodictionary.com/dinos_tpg2.asp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " nhm " > {{cite web |url=http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/dino-directory/detail.dsml?Genus=Triceratops |title=Triceratops in the Natural History Museum's Dino Directory |publisher=Internt.nhm.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-08-03 |archive-date=2009-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217160801/http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/dino-directory//detail.dsml?Genus=Triceratops |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and 6.1–12.0 & nbsp;[[tonne]]s (13,000–26,000 & nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) in [[weight]]. < ref name= " Alexander " > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1985.tb00871.x | last1 = Alexander | first1 = R.M. | year = 1985 | title = Mechanics of posture and gait of some large dinosaurs | url = | journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1–25 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Skull === 
 The most distinctive feature is their large [[skull]], among the largest of all land animals. The largest known skull (specimen [[Brigham Young University|BYU]] 12183) is estimated to have been {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} in length when complete, and could reach almost a third of the length of the entire animal. It bore a single horn on the snout, above the [[nostril]]s, and a pair of horns approximately 1 & nbsp;m (3 & nbsp;ft) long, with one above each eye. Most other ceratopsids had large holes (fenestrae) in their frills, while those of ''Triceratops'' were noticeably solid. 
 
 === Limbs === 
 ''Triceratops'' species were sturdy, with strong limbs and short three-hoofed hands and four-hoofed feet. < ref name= " fujiwara2009 " > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1671/039.029.0406 | last1 = Fujiwara | first1 = S.-I. | year = 2009 | title = A re-evaluation of the manus structure in ''Triceratops'' (Ceratopsia: Ceratopsidae) | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 1136–1147 | s2cid = 86519018 }} < /ref > 
 
 The posture of these dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be [[Terrestrial locomotion#Posture|sprawling]] at angles from the [[thorax]], in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by [[Charles R. Knight|Charles Knight]] and [[Rudolph F. Zallinger|Rudolph Zallinger]]. However, evidence of [[trackway]]s, and reconstructions of skeletons show that ''Triceratops'' and other ceratopsids had an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out. The stance was intermediate between fully upright and fully sprawling, similar the modern [[rhinoceros]]. < ref name= " fujiwara2009 " / > < ref name= " CP01 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = P. | last2 = Paul | first2 = G.S. | year = 2001 | title = Limb bone scaling, limb proportions, and bone strength in neoceratopsian dinosaurs | url = http://gspauldino.com/pdfs/GaiaNeoceratopsian.pdf | journal = Gaia | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages = 13–29 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref name=thompsonholmes2007 > {{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=S. |author2= and Holmes, R. |year=2007 |title= Forelimb stance and step cycle in ''Chasmosaurus irvinensis'' (Dinosauria: Neoceratopsia) |journal= Palaeontologia Electronica |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=17 p |url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/2007_1/step/index.html}} < /ref > < ref name= " regaetal2010 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/782878359|title=New perspectives on horned dinosaurs : the Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-00779-7|location=Bloomington, IN|oclc=782878359}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Paleobiology== 
 [[File:Pasta - triceratops brain.jpg|thumb|A 1905 chart showing the relatively small brain of a ''Triceratops'' (top) and an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' (bottom).]] 
 Although ''Triceratops'' are commonly portrayed as [[herd]] animals, there is little evidence that they lived in herds. 
 
 In 2012, a group of three ''Triceratops'' in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from ''Tyrannosaurus'' teeth. < ref > [http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/03/us/triceratops-found/index.html Triceratops trio unearthed in Wyoming]. CNN.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-25. < /ref > 
 
 For many years, ''Triceratops'' finds were known only from solitary individuals. These remains are very common: one palaeontologist reported having seen 200 & nbsp;specimens of ''T. prorsus'' in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]], U.S. < ref > {{cite journal |last= Erickson |first= B.R. |year=1966 |title= Mounted skeleton of ''Triceratops prorsus'' in the Science Museum |url= |journal= Scientific Publications of the Science Museum |volume= 1 |issue= |pages= 1–16 }} < /ref >  Similarly, [[Barnum Brown]] claimed to have seen over 500 & nbsp;skulls in the field. < ref name=Dod / > {{rp|79}} ''Triceratops'' teeth, horn fragments, frill fragments, and other skull fragments are abundant fossils in the latest [[Upper Cretaceous]] of western North America. It was the most dominant herbivore of the time. In 1986, [[Robert Bakker]] estimated it as making up 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna at the end of the Cretaceous. < ref name= " RTB86 " > Bakker R.T. 1986.

 ''Triceratops'' was one of the last ceratopsian genera to appear before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The related ''[[Torosaurus]]'', and the more distantly related diminutive ''[[Leptoceratops]]'', were also present, though their remains are rarely found. < ref name=Dod / > 
 
 ===Dentition and diet=== 
 [[File:Tric1.JPG|thumb|left|Close up of the jaws and teeth]] 
 
 ''Triceratops'' were [[herbivore|herbivorous]], and because of their low head, their primary food was probably low growth, although they may have been able to knock down taller [[plant]]s with their horns, [[beak]], and bulk. < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Tait | first1 = J. | last2 = Brown | first2 = B. | year = 1928 | title = How the Ceratopsia carried and used their head | url = | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 13–23 }} < /ref >  The [[jaw]]s were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, good for grasping and plucking. < ref name= " Osrtom66 " > Ostrom J.H. 1966.

 ''Triceratops'' [[tooth|teeth]] were arranged in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in each side of each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, depending on the size of the animal. < ref name= " Dino2 "  / >  This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal). < ref name= " Dino2 " > Dodson P; Forster C.A. and Sampson S.D. 2004. Ceratopsidae. In: Weishampel D.B; Dodson P. and Osmólska H. (eds) The ''Dinosauria'' 2nd ed, University of California Press, Berkeley, pp. 494–513. {{ISBN|0-520-24209-2}} < /ref >  The great size and numerous teeth of ''Triceratops'' suggests that they ate large volumes of fibrous plant material, < ref name= " Dino2 "  / >  such as [[Arecaceae|palms]] and [[cycad]]s. 
 
 === Functions of the horns and frill === 
 There has been much speculation over the functions of ''Triceratops''' head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat, or display in courtship, with the latter thought now to be the most likely primary function. < ref name= " Dino2 "  / > 
 
 ''Triceratops'' were long thought to have used their horns and frills in combat with predators such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. The idea was discussed first in 1917 and again 70 years later by Robert Bakker. < ref name= " RTB86 "  / > < ref > Sternberg C.H. 1917. ''Hunting dinosaurs in the badlands of the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada''. San Diego, California. < /ref >  There is evidence that ''Tyrannosaurus'' did have aggressive head-on encounters with ''Triceratops'', based on partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a ''Triceratops'' brow horn and [[squamosal]]; the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. < ref name= " JH08 " > {{cite book |author=Happ J. |chapter=An analysis of predator-prey behavior in a head-to-head encounter between ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' and ''Triceratops''  |title=Tyrannosaurus rex, the tyrant king. Larson P.  &  Carpenter K. eds |url=https://archive.org/details/tyrannosaurusrex00plar |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=2008 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tyrannosaurusrex00plar/page/355 355]–368 |isbn=978-0-253-35087-9}} < /ref >  Since the ''Triceratops'' wounds healed, the ''Triceratops'' survived the encounter. < ref name=Dod > Dodson, Peter 1996. ''The horned dinosaurs''. Princeton University Press. < /ref >  ''Tyrannosaurus'' is also known to have fed on ''Triceratops''. Evidence for this includes a heavily tooth-scored ''Triceratops'' [[ilium]]  and [[sacrum]]. 
 [[File:Triceratops lesions.jpg|thumb|Signs of bone injury and repair in ''Triceratops'']] 
 
 In addition to combat with predators using horns, ''Triceratops'' are classically shown engaging each other in combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, < ref > {{cite journal | last=Farke |first= A.A. |year=2004 |title= Horn use in ''Triceratops'' (Dinosauria: Ceratopsidae): testing behavioral hypotheses using scale models |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/pe/2004_1/horn/horn.pdf | accessdate=20 November 2010 |journal = Palaeo-electronica | volume=7 |issue= 1|pages= 1–10 }} < /ref >  there is disagreement about whether they did so. 
 [[File:UCMP Triceratops right.JPG|right|thumb|Juvenile and adult skulls & nbsp;— the juvenile skull is about the size of an adult human head]] 
 
 The large frill also may have helped to increase body area to [[thermoregulation|regulate body temperature]]. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Wheeler P.E.|year=1978|title=Elaborate CNS cooling structures in large dinosaurs|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|issue= 5679|pages=441–443|doi=10.1038/275441a0 | volume = 275|pmid=692723|bibcode=1978Natur.275..441W|s2cid=4160470}} < /ref >  A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Farlow|first1=James O.|last2=Thompson|first2=Carl V.|last3=Rosner|first3=Daniel E.|date=1976-06-11|title=Plates of the Dinosaur Stegosaurus : Forced Convection Heat Loss Fins?|url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.192.4244.1123|journal=Science|language=en|volume=192|issue=4244|pages=1123–1125|doi=10.1126/science.192.4244.1123|pmid=17748675 |bibcode=1976Sci...192.1123F |s2cid=44506996 |issn=0036-8075}} < /ref >  although this use alone would not account for the bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the [[Ceratopsidae]]. < ref name= " Dino2 "  / >  This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display. 
 
 The theory of their use in sexual display was first proposed by Davitashvili in 1961 and has gained increasing acceptance since. < ref name= " Davitashvili61 " > {{cite book|title=Teoriya Polovogo Otbora (Theory of Sexual Selection)|year=1961|author=Davitashvili L. Sh.|page=538|publisher=Izdatel'stvo Akademii nauk SSSR}} < /ref >  Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, can be seen in the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Farlow J.O. and Dodson P. |year=1975|title=The behavioral significance of frill and horn morphology in ceratopsian dinosaurs|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_evolution_1975-06_29_2/page/353 |journal=Evolution|volume=29|issue=2 |pages=353–361|doi=10.2307/2407222|jstor=2407222|pmid=28555861}} < /ref >  A 2006 study of the smallest ''Triceratops'' skull, ascertained to be a juvenile, shows the frill and horns developed at a very early age, predating sexual development and thus probably important for visual communication and species recognition in general. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Goodwin M.B. |display-authors = etal | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/mbg/Goodwin_et_al_2006.pdf| title=The smallest known ''Triceratops'' skull: new observations on ceratopsid cranial anatomy and ontogeny| journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology| volume=26| issue=1 | page = 103 | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[103:TSKTSN]2.0.CO;2| year=2006|s2cid = 31117040 |issn=0272-4634}} < /ref > 
 
 === Paleopathology === 
 One skull, assigned to ''Triceratops'', has a hole in the [[Jugal bone|jugal]] bone. It looks like a puncture wound sustained while the animal was still alive.  This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a ''Triceratops'' horn. This is evidence of competition between individual dinosaurs. < ref > Farlow J.O. and Dodson P. 1975. The behavioral significance of frill and horn morphology in ceratopsian dinosaurs.
