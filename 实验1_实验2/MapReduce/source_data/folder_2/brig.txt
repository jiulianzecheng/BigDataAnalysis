 A '''brig''' is a [[sailing ship]] with two [[square rig|square-rigged]] [[mast]]s. During the [[Age of Sail]], brigs were seen as fast and [[wikt:maneuver|maneuver]]able. They were used as both [[Navy|naval]] [[warship]]s and [[merchant vessel]]s. Even after the sailing age ended they were used as training ships. < ref > Richard Mayne, ''The Language of Sailing'' (Chicago; London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2000), p. 42 < /ref >  The brig was one of the smaller two-masted sailing ships. < ref > Otmar Schäuffelen, ''Chapman Great Sailing Ships of the World'' (New York; Hearst Books, 2005), p. xxi < /ref >  They were [[wikt:popular|popular]] in the [[18th century|18th]] and early [[19th century|19th centuries]]. Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the [[steam ship]] because they required a relatively large crew for their small size. They were also difficult to sail into the wind.  They are not to be confused with a [[brigantine]], which has different rigging (a brigantine has a [[gaff-rig]]ged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail). A brig is different from a three-masted [[full-rigged ship|ship]] because it only has two masts. 
 
 ==Rigging== 
 In [[sailing]], a full-rigged '''brig''' is a vessel with two [[square rig]]ged [[mast (sailing)|masts]] (called the fore and main). < ref name= " Sand " > {{cite web|title=Schooner In The Sand|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/hal_mhc_mhm_schooner_tg_07-09-2002_92621_7.pdf| date=January 2002 |access-date=December 26, 2016}} < /ref >  The main mast of a brig is the aft (rear) one. To improve maneuverability, the mainmast carries a small ([[gaff rig]]ged) [[fore-and-aft]] sail. < ref name= " NJ " > {{cite web|url=http://www.njscuba.net/artifacts/ship_sailing_ship.html|title=Sailing ships|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-date=January 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113100740/http://www.njscuba.net/artifacts/ship_sailing_ship.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 Brig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached. Those attached to the main mast are called the [[mainsail]]; above that the main [[topsail]] and above that the main [[topgallant sail]]. Occasionally a very small sail, called the [[royal sail|royal]], is above that. Behind the mainsail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the [[spanker (sail)|spanker]] or [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] mainsail (it is similar to the main sail of a [[schooner]]). On the [[foremast]] is a similar sail, called the [[trysail]]. Attached to the respective [[yard (sailing)|yards]] of square-rigged ships are smaller spars. These can be extended, which lengthens the yard. This allows it to receive an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called [[studding sail]]s. They are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are named after the sails to which they are fastened. For [[example]], the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc. < ref name= " Man " > {{cite web| title=Man on the Ocean|author=R.M.

 The brig’s [[foremast]] is smaller than the main mast. The fore mast holds a foresail, fore topsail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the [[bowsprit]] are the fore [[staysail]], [[jib]], and [[flying jib]]. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the [[running rigging]]. This is opposed to the [[standing rigging]] which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid. < ref name= " Man " / >  Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized. This was because, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color. The standing rigging was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. 
 
 == Hull == 
 A brig is  " generally built on a larger scale than a schooner. It could approach the size of a full-sized, three-masted [[full rigged ship|ship]]. " < ref name= " Man "  / >  Brigs varried in length between 75 and 165 & nbsp;ft (23–50 & nbsp;m) with tonnages up to 480. < ref name= " Texas " > {{cite web|url=http://www.texasnavy.com/History/General/19th_Century_Nautical_Glossary.pdf|title=The Texas Navies|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-date=April 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425050927/http://www.texasnavy.com/History/General/19th_Century_Nautical_Glossary.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Historically, most brigs were made of wood. However some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron. < ref name= " NJ "  / >  Brigs with [[pine]] hulls were built in the [[19th century]]. They was designed to last for about twenty years although many lasted longer. < ref name= " NJ "  / > 
 
 ==Historic usage== 
 Brigs were used as small warships carrying about 10 to 18 [[cannon]]s. < ref name= " Texas " / >  Due to their speed and maneuverability they were popular among [[pirate]]s (though they were rare among American and Caribbean pirates). < ref name= " Man " / >  Their use stretches back before the [[17th century]]. However one of the most famous periods for the brig was during the [[19th century]] when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the [[Battle of Lake Erie]]. In the early 19th century the brig was a standard [[cargo]] ship. It was seen as  " fast and well sailing " , but required a large [[crew]] to handle its rigging. < ref name= " Tre " > {{cite web|title=The  " Stockholm Brig "  Tre Kronor| url=http://www.abc.se/~pa/bld/sth-brig.htm |access-date=December 26, 2016}} < /ref >  While brigs could not sail into the wind as easily as [[fore-and-aft–rig]]ged vessels such as schooners a skilled brig [[captain]] could  " manoeuvre it with ease and elegance; a brig could for instance turn around almost on the spot " . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/brig.html|title=Brig|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-date=December 30, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230031219/http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/brig.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  A brig's square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling in the open [[ocean]]. When fore-and aft rigged vessels sailed downwind for extended distances and where  " the danger of a sudden [[jibe]] was the large schooner-captain's nightmare " . < ref > Chapelle: The History Of American Sailing Ships, 1935, p.209 < /ref >  This trait later led to the evolution of the [[barquentine]]. The need for large crews in relation to their smaller size led to the decline of the production of brigs. They were replaced in commercial traffic by gaff sail schooners (which needed smaller crews) and [[steam boat]]s (which did not have the windward performance problems of square rigged ships). < ref name= " Tre " / > 
 
 The ''Telos'', built in [[Bangor, Maine]] in 1883, was reportedly the last brig to join the American merchant marine. It was  " considered to be the finest vessel of her class ever constructed in Maine " .  She was wrecked on [[Aves Island]], off [[Bonaire]] in the [[Caribbean]], in 1900. < ref > ''New York Times'' June 17, 1900, p. 10 < /ref >
