 '''Obsidian''' is a natural [[volcano|volcanic]] [[glass]]: it is a kind of [[igneous]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It is produced when [[lava]] high in [[silica]] (SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ) cools rapidly, and solidifies quickly. < ref > Obsidian is found in rhyolitic lava flows known as ''obsidian flows''. This lava cools rapidly. < /ref >  Because there is no crystal structure, obsidian [[blade]] edges can reach almost molecular thinness. They were used as [[arrowhead]]s, and today they may be used as surgical [[scalpel]] blades. < ref > {{cite book| last = Wescott| first = David| title = Primitive technology: a book of Earth skills| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HlwUo0IccoMC & pg=PA90| year = 1999| publisher = Gibbs Smith| isbn = 978-0-87905-911-8| page = 90 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Origin and properties == 
 Obsidian is [[mineral]]-like, but not [[crystal]]line. It is dark in color like [[basalt]]. It consists mainly of SiO < sub > 2 < /sub >  ([[silicon dioxide]]), usually 70% or more. 
 
 Obsidian does not last forever. It is [[phases of matter#Metastable phases|metastable]]: it changes very slowly. Over time, the glass becomes fine-grained crystals. So, no unaltered obsidian is older than [[Cretaceous]] age. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Royal R. |title=Devitrification of Natural Glass |journal=GSA Bulletin |date=1 October 1961 |volume=72 |issue=10 |pages=1493–1520 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1961)72[1493:DONG]2.0.CO;2|bibcode=1961GSAB...72.1493M }} < /ref >  It breaks down faster when water is present.

 Usually dark, the color varies on the presence of different materials. [[Iron]] and [[magnesium]] typically give the obsidian a dark green to brown to black color. A few samples are nearly colorless. In some stones, small crystals produce a snowflake pattern (''snowflake obsidian''). It may contain patterns of gas which produce effects such as a golden sheen (''sheen obsidian'') or a rainbow sheen (''rainbow obsidian''). 
 
 == Historical use == 
 [[File:Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Obsidian [[arrowhead]].]] 
 Obsidian was valued in [[Stone Age]] cultures because, like [[flint]], it could be chipped to produce [[hand axe]]s, sharp blades or [[arrowhead]]s. 
 
 [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]ns used obsidian often. It was worked for [[tool]]s and decorative objects. It was also polished to create early [[mirror]]s. Mesoamericans also made a type of [[sword]] with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body. Called a [[macuahuitl]], the weapon could cause terrible injuries, because it combined the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated edge. 
 
 Native American people traded obsidian throughout North America. Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian. So archaeologists can trace the origins of a particular artifact. Obsidian can be identified in Greece as coming from different islands in the [[Aegean Sea]]. Obsidian [[wikt:core|cores]] (unworked lumps) and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast. < ref > Obsidian was also used on Rapa Nui ([[Easter island]]) for edged tools such as ''Mataia'' and the pupils of the eyes of their [[Moai]] (statues). < /ref > 
 
 Modern [[archaeologists]] have developed a dating system to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts depending from the content of water in the object. 
 
 == Occurrence == 
 Obsidian can be found where high silicate eruptions have happened. There are solid obsidian flows in the [[caldera]]s of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the [[Cascade Range]] of western North America, and at Inyo Craters east of the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada, California]]. [[Yellowstone National Park]] has a mountainside containing obsidian between [[Mammoth Hot Springs]] and the Norris Geyser Basin. Deposits can be found in many other western US states including [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Oregon]] and [[Idaho]]. Obsidian can also be found in  [[Armenia]], [[Turkey]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Iceland]], [[Greece]] and [[Scotland]].

 Obsidian is used in heart [[surgery]], as well-crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical [[scalpel]]s, with the edge of the blade being only about 3 & nbsp;nm wide. < ref > Buck B.A. 1982. Ancient technology in contemporary surgery. The Western Journal of Medicine, 136, 265-269 < /ref >  Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope. When examined under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian produced narrower scars, fewer inflammatory cells, and less granulation tissue in a group of rats. < ref name= " surgery " > {{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve & db=PubMed & list_uids=8415970 & dopt=Abstract |title=A comparison of obsidian and surgical steel scalpe...[Plast Reconstr Surg. 1993] - PubMed Result |accessdate=2007-11-20 |year=1975 |pmid=5970 |last1=Vitali |first1=C. |last2=Orpianesi |first2=C. |last3=Nuara |first3=C. |journal=Annali Sclavo; Rivista di Microbiologia e di Immunologia |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=216–218 }} < /ref > 
 
 Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a [[gemstone]]. It possesses the property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut. When cut in one direction it is a beautiful jet black; when cut across another direction it is glistening gray.
