 Most of the time it means a [[Fictional character|character]] in [[fiction]], [[television]], or [[movie]]s. Sometimes it is used to mean a real person. Sometimes the antihero is linked to the author's social critique or message to the reader: for example, the unnamed protagonist in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''Notes from Underground''. < ref > {{cite book| last = Steiner| first = George| title = Tolstoy or Dostoevsky: An Essay in the Old Criticism| year = 2013| publisher = Open Road Media| isbn = 978-1-4804-1191-3| page = 201 }} < /ref > 
 
 The whole concept was the subject of a book by [[Colin Wilson]] called ''The Outsider''. < ref > Wilson, Colin 1956. ''The Outsider''. London: Gollancz. < /ref >  There the author imagines he is in the position of many of his favourite characters in fiction, such as Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov.
