 ==History== 
 On June 9, 1959, ten journalists met at the headquarters of the Argentores Association with the purpose of supporting and promoting the improvement of television and radio broadcasting and formalized the beginning of the institution under the first presidency of Manuel Ferradás Campos. That same year the first awards ceremony was held at the Cervantes National Theater.
