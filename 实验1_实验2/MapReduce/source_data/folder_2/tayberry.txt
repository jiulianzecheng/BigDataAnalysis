 A '''tayberry''' is a cross between a [[blackberry]] and a red [[raspberry]]. The genetic cross was [[patent]]ed in 1979. 
 
 It is a cultivated [[shrub]] in the genus ''Rubus'' of the family Rosaceae. It was named after the [[River Tay]] in [[Scotland]]. The fruit is sweeter, much larger, and more [[scent|aroma]]tic than that of the [[loganberry]]. The loganberry is itself a blackberry and red raspberry cross. 
 
 The fruit do not pick easily by hand and cannot be machine harvested. They have not become a commercially grown berry crop. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=4923|title=Rubus Tayberry Group (F)|work=rhs.org.uk}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >
