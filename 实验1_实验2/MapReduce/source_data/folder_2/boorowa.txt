 '''Boorowa''' is a small [[town]] in [[New South Wales]]. It is {{convert|66|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The town is built on the [[coast|banks]] of the [[Boorowa River]], which flows into the [[Lachlan River]]. The town was first called ''Burrowa''. Boorowa and Burrowa are [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] words in the [[Wiradjuri]] [[language]] meaning  " [[bird]]s " . < ref name=boorowa > {{cite web |url=http://www.argylecounty.com.au/towns/boorowa.html |title=Booroowa |accessdate=2008-12-14 |format= |work=Towns and Villages of the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales |archive-date=2011-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204032613/http://www.argylecounty.com.au/towns/boorowa.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In 2008, there were 1350 living in Boorowa. < ref name=ST > {{cite book |last= Boorowa and District Historical Society |title=Follow the Shamrock Trails |publisher= Boorowa Council |date=April 2008 |location=Boorowa, New South Wales |pages= |url= |doi= }}

 The first people to live in the area were the Wiraduri people. This was one of the largest [[tribe]]s in New South Wales. They had several regular [[camp]]ing sites along the Lachlan and Boorowa Rivers. It is estimated that there were several thousand Wiradjuri people at the time of [[Europe]]an [[settler|settlement]]. A [[survey]] in 1851 showed that there were only 300 people left. Local Wiradjuri people were forced onto [[government]] reserves at [[Rye Park]] and [[Edgerton]]. < ref name=boorowa/ > 
 
 ==Early settlement== 
 It is not known for sure who the first European [[explorer]]s were in this area. [[Hamilton Hume]] and his [[neighbour]], [[William Broughton]], had explored the Yass area in 1821. They may have gone farther towards the Lachlan. Broughton had one of the first [[farm]]s on the Boorowa River in 1828. By 1849, he had {{convert|13400|acre|ha|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of land in the area. Other early settlers were James Hassall in 1827. His family already had large farms at [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]] by 1823. His brother Tom Hassal, a [[clergyman]] and his wife Ann Marsden (daughter of Reverend [[Samuel Marsden]]) and other family members were given land in 1831. There was a law at the time which gave free land to the children of clergy. < ref name=boorowa/ > 
 
 ==Irish influence== 
 Many of the settlers in Boorowa were from [[Ireland]] and the town shows their influence. Two early settlers in the 1820s were cousins, Roger Corcoran and Ned Ryan. They had been sent to Australia as [[convict]]s. < ref name=ST/ >  [[Saint Patrick]]'s Church, built in 1877 has a huge [[stained glass]] window brought from Ireland in 1881. It shows [[Daniel O'Connell]] (1775-1847) the  " Liberator of Ireland. " < ref > {{cite book |last =Lane | first =Jacqui | authorlink = |others=II O'Flahertie, Susan, III Elder, Bruce, IV Thoerning, Peter |title=The Great Australia Gazeteer |publisher =Focus Publishing |date=2001 |location =Edgecliff NSW |page=37 |isbn=187535980X }} < /ref >  The oldest building still standing in Boorowa is Shamrock Cottage, built in 1850, once the home of the owner of the Queens Arms Hotel. < ref name=ST/ > 
 
 ==Old buildings== 
 There are many old buildings still standing in Boorowa. Webb and Crego's store, built in 1862, was robbed by [[bushranger]] [[Ben Hall]] in 1863. The Royal Hotel, built in 1860, is still a hotel although it is now called the Ram and Stallion Hotel. The [[courthouse|Court House]], built in 1884, is now an information centre for [[tourist]]s. < ref name=ST/ >
