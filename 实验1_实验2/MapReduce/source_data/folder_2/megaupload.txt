 On 19 January 2012 the [[United States Department of Justice]] seized and shut down the file hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. < ref > {{cite web|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|title=Megaupload lawyer Q & A on DOJ criminal case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/megaupload-lawyer-qanda-on-doj-criminal-case/2012/01/20/gIQA3HJhDQ_story.html|work=20 January 2012|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 January 2012}} < /ref >  Worldwide, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] arrested [[Kim Schmitz]] (Founder), Finn Batato (CMO), Mathias Ortmann (CTO and co-founder), with Bram van der Kolk arrested by the [[Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Four Megaupload personnels arrested in New Zealand|date=19 January 2012 |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/four-arrested-in-nz-in-global-piracy-probe-20120120-1q93r.html}} < /ref >   Their bail request was denied in New Zealand court as it was opposed by US authorities on the case. < ref > {{cite web|title=Jailed MegaUpload Employees Denied Bail|date=20 January 2012 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5877779/}} < /ref >  On January 20 [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Customs]] froze more than HK$300 million (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company. < ref > {{Cite news |author= Yung, Chester |title= Hong Kong Freezes Megaupload Assets |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577174362457114578.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= January 21, 2012 |accessdate= January 21, 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 The case drew particular public attention because the arrests were on the day after a large protest of [[Stop Online Piracy Act|proposed legislation]] to expand United States legal authority against foreign piracy websites. Shortly afterward, the Department of Justice's website and a number of other organisations' websites were taken offline following concerted [[denial of service]] attacks from activist group ''[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]''. < ref > {{cite news|title=Anonymous in revenge attack for MegaUpload shutdown|url=http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2012/01/anonymous-megaupload-ddos/#axzz1k55k0F00|newspaper=Financial Times}} < /ref >

 A group spokesperson described the attacks as  " the single largest Internet attack in [the group's] history "  in an interview, adding that it was  " a terrible case of happenstance that federal agents went after Megaupload only hours after the thousands of sites protesting in an anti-SOPA blackout went back online. Web surfers were by-and-far ready to defend an open Internet ... the feds 'could not have chosen a worse time to take down Megaupload'.

 Besides the Department of Justice's justice.gov, the Denial of Service attack included Universal Music Group, [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), [[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI), and the website of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. “Even without SOPA having been passed yet, the federal government always had tremendous power to do some of the things that they want to do. So if this is what can occur without SOPA being passed, imagine what can occur after SOPA is passed,” Brown told RT. Anonymous also attacked the website of France's anti-piracy organisation. < ref > {{cite web|title=Hackers bring down French anti-piracy site|url=http://www.thelocal.fr/2340/20120120/|publisher=The Local|accessdate=20 January 2012|date=20 January 2012}} < /ref >   
   
 On 19 January 2012 Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI and others. < ref > {{cite web|title=Anonymous post on Pastebin|url=http://pastebin.com/WEydcBVV|access-date=2012-01-21|archive-date=2012-07-19|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719071740/http://pastebin.com/WEydcBVV|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
