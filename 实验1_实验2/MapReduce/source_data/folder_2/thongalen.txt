 == Mythology == 
 === In the Poireiton Khunthok === 
 {{Main|Poireiton Khunthok}} 
 King Thongaren ({{lang-omp|[[Thongalen]]}}) asked his highest ranked Queen Laikhurembi ({{lang-omp|Laikhulempi}}) to go with his brother [[Poireiton]] on a long trip. Poireiton was a [[:en:wikt:widower|widower]]; his wife had died, and he had six children to raise and also had to go to the ''[[Ancient Kangleipak|Tai Pang Pan]]''. King Thongalel thought his brother needed a wife to go with him on their trip. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n245/mode/2up?q=Thongaren+Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=245}} < /ref >  However, Queen Laikhurembi did not want to go. She said she was already the king's wife. Trees had already been planted in her honor because she and the king had lived together for a very long time. So, instead of Queen Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife, [[Leinaotabi]], to go with Poireiton and be his wife. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.463276/page/n246/mode/2up?q=Thongarel+Laikhurembi|title=The History Of Manipur|last=Singh|first=Wahengbam Ibohal|pages=246}} < /ref > 
 
 === In the Pombi Luwaoba === 
 {{Main|Nongban Pombi Luwaoba}} 
 Nongban Pombi Luwaoba was a prince in the [[Luwang dynasty]]. A dynasty is a line of kings or queens who are all related to each other in the same family. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba and his wife Namoinu were happy. Then she died suddenly. She died because of the God Thongalel. Prince Pombi Luwaoba refused to perform the [[Meitei death ceremony|funeral]] of her dead body. He hoped the God Thongalel would send her [[soul]] back into her body so she would be alive again. God Thongalel received a message from the prince through a [[pheasant]] bird. The message said that Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba was ready to fight God Thongalel if he did not send Namoinu's soul back. This made the God Thongalel angry. He sent two of his brothers, but Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba beat them both.  He took them prisoner. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba sent the pheasant bird with another message to God Thongalel. The message said that if the God wanted to get back his brothers alive, then he had to sent back the soul of Namoinu to her body. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf_2DwAAQBAJ & q=thongarel & pg=PA7|title=AKASHVANI: Vol. XXXIII, No.12 ( 17 MARCH, 1968 )|last=Delhi|first=All India Radio (AIR), New|date=1968-03-17|publisher=All India Radio (AIR),New Delhi|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Finally, God Thongalel came to meet Prince Pombi Luwaoba himself. But instead of fighting, the prince prayed to the God Himself. God Thongalel was happy that Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba showed him respect. Thongalel brought Namoinu back to life. He also gave her a gift: She would live for 100 years and have 100 sons. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf_2DwAAQBAJ & q=thongarel & pg=PA7|title=AKASHVANI: Vol. XXXIII, No.12 ( 17 MARCH, 1968 )|last=Delhi|first=All India Radio (AIR), New|date=1968-03-17|publisher=All India Radio (AIR),New Delhi|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Association with other deities == 
 God Thongalel is sometimes identified as God [[Wangbren|Wangpurel]] ({{lang-omp|Wangpulel}}). Thongalel is the King of underworld. Wangpurel reigns over the direction south. Some [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] believe that the direction south is the land of death. So, when the [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] got converted into [[Hinduism]], both Thongalel and Wangpulel became counterparts of Hindu God [[Yama]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461915/page/n109/mode/2up?q=Thongarel|title=A Critical Study Of The Religious Philosophy|last=Singh|first=L.
