 [[File:Maultier grau.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[mule]]'' is a hybrid of a female horse and a male donkey.]] 
 A '''hybrid''' is the product of [[mating]] between individuals of different [[species]] or strains. The word is most common when talking about [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. 
 
 [[Mule|Mules]] are hybrid animals. The [[female]] [[parent]] is a [[horse]] and the [[male]] parent is a [[donkey]]. A mule is generally [[sterile]]. Not all hybrids are sterile. Many garden plants and [[crop]] plants are hybrids. New [[species]] are sometimes formed from hybrids between two other species.
