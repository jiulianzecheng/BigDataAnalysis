 '''Demigods''' are people in [[mythology]] (usually [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology|Roman]]) who are half-god and half-human. They are special because of their godly parent. However, they normally have no great powers because of their human parent. Demigods are usually mortal but not always. An example of one is [[Hercules]]. His father, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ([[Zeus]]), made him a god after Hercules died. Other demigods from [[Classical mythology]] include [[Achilles]], [[Heracles]] and [[Romulus and Remus]].
