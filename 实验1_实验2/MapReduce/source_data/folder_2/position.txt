 '''Position''' is a way to explain [[#Location|where something is]]. 
 
 ==Location== 
 The words which indicate position are called [[prepositions]]. 
 
 ===Left, middle, and right=== 
 [[File:Left Hand Identification.jpg|thumb|Left Hand Identification]] 
 To find which is your '''left''' hand side, hold your hands palms down, point your index fingers and stick your [[thumb]]s out at right angles. The finger and thumb of your ''left'' hand will form a capital letter L.  
 
 If the letter L you make is reversed, you found your '''right''' hand. '''Left''' and '''right''' are called [[opposite]] sides. 
 
 '''Middle''' is between ''up'' and ''down'' and is between ''left'' and ''right''. 
 Middle means the same as ''center''.
