An '''aphorism''' is a memorable saying. It often contains a surprising [[truth]]. Most aphorisms are quite short, but not all: 
 
 *''Ars longa, vita brevis'' (Art is long but life is short). [[Hippocrates]]' opening to his work on medicine. 
 *''To do nothing is sometimes a good remedy''. Hippocrates. 
 *''The various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful''. [[Edward Gibbon]],  " [[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]] " , volume 1, chapter 1. 
 *''Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely''. Lord Acton (John Dalby-Acton, 1st Baron Acton), in ''The history of freedom in antiquity'' (1877). 
 *''Our virtues are most frequently but vices in disguise''. ( " Nos vertus ne sont, le plus souvent, que de vices déguisés " .)  Francois de La Rochefoucauld. ''Reflections; or Sentences and Moral Maxims (1665–1678)'' 
 *''We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars''. [[Oscar Wilde]], in ''Lady Windermere's Fan'' (1892). 
 *''Fool, nothing is impossible in Russia but reform.'' Oscar Wilde, in Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880). 
 *''All is flux'', and ''You cannot step into the same river twice''. Both quoted by [[Plato]] in his ''Cratylus'', and both were remarks of [[Heraclitus]]. But Plato's version was not quite the same. The first was ''All entities move and nothing remains still''.
