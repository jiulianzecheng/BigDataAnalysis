 == Description == 
 According to the [[Meitei culture|Meitei tradition]], Sun God Korouhanba has strong connection with human [[body]], human [[soul]] and origin of [[life]]. The human body is a  " Lang "  (lit. trap). Inside the trap, the  " Thawai Polpi "  (lit. soul bird) is kept. The soul bird leaves the former  " Lang "  and enters into another  " Lang " . The process is called  " Langon "  (lit. Changing of Lang). The  " Polpilang Puya "  text describes that the sun is the origin of life. It was told to Luwang Leikoiba by Mangang Laininghal according to the text. He (the Sun) represents the Supreme Being in the world of things (non living) and beings (living). He is Korouhanba. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461915/page/n111/mode/2up?q=Korouhanba+Lang+trap+soul+bird+Polpilang+origin+life+Sun+Supreme|title=A Critical Study Of The Religious Philosophy|website=archive.org|date=August 1991|pages=111}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / >
