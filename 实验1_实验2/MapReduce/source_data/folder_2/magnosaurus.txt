 '''''Magnosaurus''''' (meaning 'large lizard') was a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Middle Jurassic]] of [[England]].  The main species, ''Magnosaurus nethercombensis'' has poorly preserved remains. It has often been confused with or included in ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. 
 
 In 1923, [[Germans|German]] paleontologist [[Friedrich von Huene]] named ''Megalosaurus nethercombensis'' from a partial skeleton. It was found in the nineteenth century by W. Parker in [[Dorset]]. Fossils came from a possible [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] individual.  Huene interpreted it as a more primitive [[species]] of ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. < ref name= " FVH23 " > von Huene, F. (1923).

 The remains are just a few fragments. Details of its anatomical features are unknown. It would have been a [[bipedal]] [[carnivore]] of moderate size for a dinosaur.
