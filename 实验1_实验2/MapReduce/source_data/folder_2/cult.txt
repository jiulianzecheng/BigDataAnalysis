A '''cult''' is a group of people who have a [[religion]] or a set of beliefs. In modern times the term  " cult "  usually does not mean a mainstream religion, but a group set up  " in opposition to a centre of established authority " . < ref name=Bullock/ >  [[New Age]] religions were often called cults because they were thought to be deviant social movements. < ref > [[OED]], citing ''American Journal of Sociology'' '''85''', 1980, 1377:  " Cults[...], like other deviant social movements, tend to recruit people with a grievance, people who suffer from a some variety of deprivation " . < /ref > 
 
 The word cult originally meant a system of [[ritual]] practices. It was first used in the early 17th century to mean homage paid to a divinity. < ref > Its root was the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cultus'', meaning  " worship " , ultimately from ''colere'', to  " tend "  or take care of something for example a [[shrine]]. < /ref >  It came from an ancient [[Latin]] word ''cultus'' meaning  " [[worship]] " . 
 
 A cult is often a small, newly started religious movement. Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd, or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice.  More than that, cults have often been led by people who are not elected, and control the group according to their own wishes. < ref name=Clark > See testimony of John G. Clark Jnr. M.D. to the Vermont legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Effects_of_Religious_Cults_on_the_Health_and_Welfare_of_Their_Converts] < /ref >  Some cult leaders have been dangerous criminals ([[Charles Manson]]; [[Peoples Temple]]) or even lunatics. Killings and [[mass suicide]]s have occurred in cults ([[Order of the Solar Temple]]; [[Heaven's Gate]]). Of course, a  " suicide "  enforced by armed guards carrying [[sub-machine gun]]s (Peoples Temple; [[Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God]]) is not a simple suicide as generally understood. It is at least an assisted and coerced suicide. 
 
 Whether a religious group is or is not a cult can be a hard question to answer. What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion and what at one point of time is considered an accepted religion may later become a cult. 
 
 == Treatment of cult members == 
 === Mind control === 
 Some form of persuasion or [[mind control]] can be used to recruit and maintain members. The objective is to prevent the faithful from thinking critically, and making choices in their own best interest.  
 : " I will state that coercive persuasion and thought reform techniques are effectively practiced on naïve, uninformed subjects with disastrous health consequences. I will try to give enough information to indicate my reasons for further inquiries as well as review of applicable legal processes " . < ref name=Clark/ > 
 
 The following methods have been used in some or all cults studied: < ref name=Bullock > Bullock, Alan  &  Trombley, Stephen (eds) 1999. ''The new Fontana dictionary of modern thought''. London: Fontana, p189. {{ISBN|0-00-255871-8}} < /ref > < ref > House, Wayne 2000. ''Charts of cults, sects, and religious movements''. {{ISBN|0-310-38551-2}} < /ref > < ref > Tourish, Dennis 2000.

 # People are put in physically or emotionally distressing situations; 
 # Their problems are reduced to one simple explanation, which is repeatedly emphasized; 
 # They receive what seems to be unconditional love, acceptance, and attention from a charismatic leader or group; 
 # They get a new identity based on the group; 
 # They are subject to entrapment (isolation from friends, relatives and the mainstream culture) and their access to information is severely controlled. < ref > Esquerre, Arnaud 2009.

Park Street Press. {{ISBN|978-0-89281-311-7}} < /ref > 
 
 This view is disputed by some. < ref > James, Gene G. 1986. Brainwashing: the myth and the actuality. ''[[Fordham University]] Quarterly'', vol 61, June. < /ref >  ''Society for the Scientific Study of Religion'' stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that  " one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control " . < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://rra.hartsem.edu/sssr/SSSR/BUSINESS/90.html |title=SSSR Council meeting on 7 November 1990 |access-date=8 November 2012 |archive-date=2 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102125002/http://rra.hartsem.edu/sssr/SSSR/BUSINESS/90.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === Management style of cults === 
 An oft-repeated criticism of cults is that their management style is dictatorial and exploitative. The following is one example: 
 : " The beliefs of all these cults are absolutist and non-tolerant of other systems of beliefs. Their systems of governance are [[totalitarian]]. A requirement of membership is to obey absolutely without questioning. Their interest in the individual’s development within the cult towards some kind of satisfactory individual adult personality is by their doctrines, very low or nonexistent. It is clear that almost all of them emphasize money making in one form or another, although a few seem to be very much involved in demeaning or self denigrating activities and rituals. Most of them that I have studied possess a good deal of property and money which is under the discretionary control of the individual leaders " . < ref name=Clark/ > 
 
 == Use of violence == 
 Ownership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The [[Branch Davidians]] under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile. < ref > FBI 2000. ''Project Megiddo'', pages 10 and 26. United States Department of Justice, Operation Megiddo, November 2, 1999. A strategic assessment of the potential for domestic terrorism in the United States undertaken in anticipation of, or response to, the arrival of the new millennium. < /ref > 
 The [[People's Temple]] included guards armed with [[submachine gun]]s. These guards killed the visiting U.S. [[Congressman]] Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. < ref > Reiterman, Tom; Jacobs, John 1982. ''Raven: the untold story of Rev. Jim Jones and his people''. Dutton, {{ISBN|0-525-24136-1}} < /ref >  Members of the [[Charles Manson#Manson  " Family " |Manson Family]] were convicted of several murders. < ref > Bugliosi, Vincent with Curt Gentry. 1974. ''Helter skelter: the true story of the Manson murders''. Arrow Books, 1992 ed: {{ISBN|0-09-997500-9}}; W.W. Norton, 2001 ed: {{ISBN|0-393-32223-8}} < /ref >
