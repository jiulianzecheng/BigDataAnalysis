A '''password''' is a way of [[authentication]]. It can be used as a means to identify a person. Since the password is the only way to identify a person, it has to be kept [[secret]]. A password can be static. This means it will remain the same unless the user changes it, or it rarely changes. Or a password can be dynamic. A dynamic password changes regularly and does not remain the same.  One type of a dynamic password is a [[one-time pad]] that can only be used once.  
 ==History== 
 Passwords were first used in the [[military]]. This was to be able to tell who was a friend and who was an [[enemy]] when it was dark. 
 
 Modern passwords are made of [[character (computing)|characters]], letters and numbers. Sometimes a password will require a [[minimum]] number of characters. Usually this is from six to eight.  Some [[website]]s allow only the use of letters and numbers, but no other characters on the [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]]. Other websites advise using a [[combination]] of letters and numbers to increase the  " strength "  of a password. Websites also advise changing a password once a year or more often to prevent hacking. A person may be able to guess a password if it is too easy. While being typed, each letter of a password is shown as * or •. 
 
 ==Alternatives== 
 Other ways of verifying the identity of a person include using [[fingerprint scanner]]s and [[face detection]]. 
 
 ==Encryption== 
 [[Encryption]] is the translation of data to achieve data security. To read an encrypted string a secret key or password must be provided to decrypt it. 
 
 ==Usage at login== 
 In systems that uses login based actions, the password can be converted to the original string if the key is provided. Hashing is a one-way function and is irreversible. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/326699/difference-between-hashing-a-password-and-encrypting-it|title=security - Difference between hashing a password and encrypting it|website=Stack Overflow|access-date=2019-07-27}} < /ref >   < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.darkreading.com/safely-storing-user-passwords-hashing-vs-encrypting/a/d-id/1269374|title=Safely storing user passwords: hashing vs. encrypting|website=Dark Reading|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/why-should-passwords-be-encrypted-if-theyre-stored-in-a-secure-database/|title=Why should passwords be encrypted if they’re stored in a secure database?|last=Exchange|first=Stack|date=2014-04-12|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-07-27}} < /ref >   < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://kb.itglue.com/hc/en-us/articles/212635818-About-password-security-and-encryption|title=About password security and encryption|website=IT Glue Knowledge Base|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-27|archive-date=2019-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727044547/https://kb.itglue.com/hc/en-us/articles/212635818-About-password-security-and-encryption|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Brute-force attacks == 
 *See also [[Brute force attack]] 
 
 Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially. 
 
 == Methods of protection against attack == 
 it includes preventing the capture of the hash of the transmitted password and protection against multiple authentication attempts in the system. Secure (encrypted) communication channels can be used to prevent interception. < ref > [https://it.needcalc.com/password-generator.html Methods of protection against attack.] < /ref >
