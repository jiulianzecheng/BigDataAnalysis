 '''Poseidon''' ({{lang-el|Ποσειδῶν}}) is the god of the sea, [[earthquakes]], [[storms]] and horses in [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek religion]] and [[myth]]. He was one of the [[Twelve Olympians]]. His parents were [[Kronos]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. He was the older brother of [[Zeus]] yet not by much. 
 
 Poseidon was generally regarded as an ill-tempered being. His mood was a reflection of the state of his realm. He was thought to conjure up violent storms at sea when angered. While he was married to the goddess [[Amphitrite]], one of the [[Nereid]]s, like his brother Zeus, Poseidon had a number of affairs with other goddesses and mortal woman, siring such heroes as [[Theseus]] and [[Bellerophon]]. Lord of the waters, Poseidon was both patron and protector of both sailors and seafarers, who would pray to him for safe passage across the sea. Poseidon was often regarded as the “Father of [[Horses]],” as they were thought to be his creations. He was additionally the chief deity and patron of the city of [[Corinth]], whereupon the [[Isthmian Games]] were held every other four years in his honor. Otherwise known as the '''Earth-Shaker''' ({{lang-el|Εννοσιγαιος}}), Poseidon was thought to be the cause of such disasters, striking the Earth with his trident (a three-pronged spear) whenever he was particularly enraged. The god's symbol was his trident and the [[bull]], horse and [[dolphin]] were his sacred animals. The god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] is his Roman equivalent. Neptune was a more war-like figure.
