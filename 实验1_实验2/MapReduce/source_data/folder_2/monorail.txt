 A '''monorail''' is like a [[train]]. Trains have two sets of wheels that balance on a [[railway track]], but monorails balance on one [[Rail tracks|rail]]. Monorails are often transport people around [[cities]]. Some monorails and trains use [[magnet|magnets]] to hover on their rails. They are called [[Maglev train|maglev trains]]. This reduces [[friction]] between the train and the rail. The first monorail was invented in the 19th century. The monorail has a different [[wheel]] system than other [[train]]s. Instead of being on the [[rail]], it goes beside the [[rail]]s. Monorails are usually complicated and expensive, so most places do not have them.
