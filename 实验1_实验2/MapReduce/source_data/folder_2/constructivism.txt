 '''Constructivism''' was an [[art]]istic and [[architecture|architectural]] movement that originated in [[Russia]] from 1913 by Vladimir Tatlin onward which rejected the idea of ''art for art's sake'' in favour of art for social purposes. It heavily influenced graphic and industrial designers.  
 
 Constructivism as an active force lasted until around 1934, having a great deal of effect on the art of the [[Weimar Republic]] and elsewhere, before being replaced by [[Socialist Realism]]. Its motifs have sporadically recurred in other art movements since.
