 '''''Betta''''' is a [[genus]] of [[fish]]. ''[[Betta splendens]]'' is a common  [[species]] of this genus. ''Betta'' are very brightly coloured. They can be bought in a local [[pet store]]. Other species of betta are more rare. The males often show their [[aggression]] at other males as well as females by flaring at one another. Betta are surface breathers. They breathe air from the surface to make a bubble nest which attracts the female for [[mating]]. Betta fishes are found in small water bodies. These bodies of water are full of fallen [[leaf]] litter and [[peat]] that gives the Betta many places to hide.  
 
 == Mating == 
 Before mating, put two tanks near each other for a few days and put them together in the tank. The male betta breathes air from the surface to make a bubble nest. This nest attracts the female for breeding. Once the nest is complete, the male Betta will try to get a female Betta to lay her [[Ovum|eggs]] by showing his fins and dancing around her. After that, the male betta will keep annoying and bullying the female betta. This shows that the male is stronger than the female. It also makes the female betta fish tired. A healthy and strong female betta will lay the eggs several days later. At that time, the male will help the female by pressing on the female's belly to squeeze out the eggs. It takes several days to lay all of the eggs. Once the female Betta lays her eggs in the nest, the male Betta will [[Fertilization|fertilize]] them by releasing his [[sperm]] over the eggs. < ref > {{Cite web|title=How to Breed Betta Fish (with Pictures) - wikiHow Pet|url=https://www.wikihow.pet/Breed-Betta-Fish#:~:text=Breeding%20Your%20Bettas%201%201%20Remove%20the%20divider.,until%20the%20fry%20can%20swim%20around%20.|access-date=2023-08-29|website=www.wikihow.pet}} < /ref >
