'''Epicardium''' ('''heart muscle''') is one of the three main layers of the [[heart]] wall.   It is the outermost layer of the heart, composed of [[connective tissue]] and [[fat]].  The connective tissue secretes a small amount of lubricating fluid into the [[pericardial cavity]].  
 
 In addition to the connective tissue and fat, the epicardium is lined by, on its outer surface, simple epithelial cells.
