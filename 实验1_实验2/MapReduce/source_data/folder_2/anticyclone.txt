In [[meteorology]], an '''anticyclone''' (that is, opposite to a [[cyclone]]) is a [[weather]] event where there is a downward movement of  [[air]] and a [[high pressure area]] over the part of the [[planet]]'s surface affected by it. It usually indicates clear skies. It has steady and calm wind moving away from its [[eye (cyclone)]].
