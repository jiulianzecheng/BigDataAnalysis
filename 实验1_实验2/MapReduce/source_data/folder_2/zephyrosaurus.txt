 '''Zephyrosaurus''' was a small [[dinosaur]]. It was a relative of [[Hypsilophodon]]. It lived 132 [[million]] [[year]]s ago, in the western part of what is now North America. It was 6 & nbsp;ft (2 metres) long and 3 & nbsp;ft (1 metre) high. 
 
 The remains are bones from various parts of the body. It had a steep face, a raised knob on the upper jaw, and a larger knob on the cheekbone. Some of the bones may have allowed movement within the skull (cranial kinesis) as well. Like other hypsilophodonts, it had beak teeth. < ref > Weishampel, David B. and Heinrich, Ronald E. 1992.
