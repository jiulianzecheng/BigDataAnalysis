 '''''Platypterygius''''' ('flat flipper)' is an [[ichthyosaur]] of the family [[Ophthalmosauridae]]. It was the last surviving ichthyosaur. < ref name= " Fernández, 2007 " > Fernández M. 2007.

 == Discovery and species == 
 [[Fossil]]s are known from [[Australia]], [[Russia]], [[United States of America]], [[Colombia]], < ref > Páramo M.E. ''Platypterygius sachicarum'' (Reptilia, Ichthyosauria) nueva especie del Cretácico de Colombia. ''Revista Ingeominas'' '''6''', 1997: 1–12 < /ref >  Western [[Europe]] and possibly [[New Zealand]]. There are seven named species. Both adults and juveniles have been unearthed, including newborns and pregnant females. Like other ichthyosaurs, ''Platypterygius'' gave live birth. 
 
 == Palaeobiology == 
 ''Platypterygius'' reached a length of about 7 m (23 ft). It had a long snout and a powerful finned tail. There are more digits in the front flippers than is usual in ichthyosaurs; they are tightly bound in rows, giving a broad, flat appearance. This unusual characteristic gives the genus its name, meaning 'flat wing.' Furthermore, some of the wrist bones have disappeared entirely. CAT scans on a juvenile specimen strongly suggest that ''Platypterygius'' was deaf. 
 
 == Extinction == 
 [[File:Ichthyosauria phylogeny.jpg|thumb|center|500px|The fate of the ichthyosaurs]] 
 
 ''Platypterygius'' became [[extinct]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 30 million years before the [[K/T extinction event]]. There was an [[ocean anoxic event]] at the [[Cenomanian–Turonian]] stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became [[anoxic]] and poisoned by [[hydrogen sulphide]] (H < sub > 2 < /sub > S). As life died off in the lower ([[benthos]]) levels of the sea, so did the [[predator]]s at the top of the food chain. The last [[pliosaur]]s and ichthyosaurs became extinct. < ref name= " Benton " > Benton M.J. 2004. Vertebrate palaeontology. 3rd ed, Blackwell, Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p251 < /sup >   
 
 No firm reasons can be given for the decline of the ichthyosaurs. By the [[Cretaceous]] they certainly had more competitors than in the [[Triassic]], and more [[wikt:escape|elusive]] [[prey]]. The [[adaptive radiation]] of [[teleost]] fish meant their new [[prey]] were fast swimming and highly [[wikt:evade|evasive]]. The teleosts also included fast-swimming [[predator]]y fish, which must have been competitors. The [[anoxic event]] would have removed much of the [[plankton]] at the base of the food chain. That would certainly result in the extinction of many larger predatory forms of life.
