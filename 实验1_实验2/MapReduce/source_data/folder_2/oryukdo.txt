'''Oryukdo''' is an [[archipelago]] that is {{convert|600|m|ft}} southeast of the [[Uam Peninsula]] in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. It is one of the symbols of Busan.  
 
 In the order close to the land, there are six islands: Shield Island, Pine tree Island, Suri Island, Awl Island, Oyster Island, and Lighthouse Island. In the past, Shield Island and Pine tree Island, which were connected to Haesik Island, were collectively called Usakdo Island, but in 2011, they were organized under the name of the uninhabited island.
