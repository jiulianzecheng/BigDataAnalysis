 '''Vaihingen an der Enz''' is a [[town]] in the southern [[Germany|German]] state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. It is on the banks of the [[Enz river]] between the large cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]]. About 30,000 people live there. 
 
 ==History== 
 Vaihingen is an old city, going back as far as the year 799 CE. Vaihingen was formally established as a town by Count Gottfried von Vaihingen in the year 1252. After the[[Reformation]], Vaihingen became a Protestant city. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Vaihingen became a battle ground between the [[Protestant]]s and [[Catholic]]s. The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolution of 1848]] hurt the economy in Vaihingen. Many people left Vaihingen to look for work in other towns. In the early 1900s, a railroad connection was made to Vaihingen. That brought more people, and also businesses, to Vaihingen. In 1938 Vaihingen became the regional center.
