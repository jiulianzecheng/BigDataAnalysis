 The '''torpedo''', is an [[explosive]] [[projectile]] [[weapon]] that moves by itself (using a [[propeller]]), [[launch]]ed above or below the water surface, that goes underwater toward a target, and made to explode when it hits a target or is near to it. Torpedoes may be launched from [[submarine]]s, surface [[ship]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[aircraft]], land etc. Robert Whitehead invented the torpedo in 1866.
