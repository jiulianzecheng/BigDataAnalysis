 '''Dopamine''' is a [[neurotransmitter]]. Many kinds of [[animal]]s and [[human]]s use it to transmit [[information]]. It is used when the [[brain]] sends signals to the [[Muscular system|muscles]] in the body to make them move. It can make a person feel good.  
 
 Dopamine is an important chemical found in the brain. If the brain does not make enough dopamine, it causes an illness called [[Parkinson's disease]]. This can be treated by giving the Parkinson's disease patient a drug called [[L-Dopa]], which the [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor|body converts to dopamine]].  
 
 Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays many important roles in the human brain and body. If you have [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], scientists think that you got it from one of your parents' [[genes]]. Typically, a number of genes are involved. Many affect the dopamine neurotransmission. It is a chemical which is triggered by the feeling of being in love, or feeling affection. In most cases, it is also activated by [[nicotine]] or [[cocaine]]. It can also be activated by [[marijuana]].  
 
 == Age-related decline in dopamine == 
 A number of studies have reported an age-related decline in making dopamine. There is also a drop the number of dopamine receptors in the brain. < ref name= " Hof 2009 " > {{cite book | vauthors = Mobbs CV, Hof PR |title=Handbook of the neuroscience of aging |publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-12-374898-0 |oclc= 299710911 }} < /ref > 
 
 The reduction of dopamine with aging may be responsible for neurological symptoms which increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. < ref name= " Wang Snyder 1998 " > {{cite book | vauthors = Wang E, Snyder SD |year=1998 |title=Handbook of the aging brain | url = https://archive.org/details/handbookofagingb0000unse |location=San Diego, California |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-734610-6 |oclc=636693117}} < /ref >  Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility (~ thinking).
