 ===Where the word comes from=== 
 Around 2000 BC (4000 years ago) there was a group of people called the [[Canaanite|Canaanites]], who lived in the [[Middle East]]. They had many gods, and the ruling god was called  " [[El (deity)|El]] "  or  " Il. "  [[El]] had power and ruled over everything, and he lived forever. He is claimed to have made the earth and everything else. Later, the word  " El "  became ''Eloh'' or ''Elaha'' in the Aramaic language. Another language, [[Hebrew]], changed the Aramaic word to ''Eloah''. In the New Testament (the second book in the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]), the words  " Eli "  and  " Elohi "  were used to mean god.  " El "  is also in some people's names: Gabri-el, Mika-el, Azrael, Israel, Israel, Yishmael, Emanuel etc. < ref > {{Web kaynağı |url=https://www.mutlakbilim.com/islamiyet/#dipnot-115 |başlık=Arşivlenmiş kopya |erişimtarihi=23 Temmuz 2020 |arşivurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723114703/https://www.mutlakbilim.com/islamiyet/#dipnot-115 |arşivtarihi=23 Temmuz 2020 |ölüurl=evet }} < /ref >
