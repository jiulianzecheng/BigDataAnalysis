 The '''South West Africa People’s Organisation''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|p|əʊ}}, '''SWAPO'''; {{lang-af|Suidwes-Afrikaanse Volks Organisasie}}, '''SWAVO'''; {{lang-de|Südwestafrikanische Volksorganisation}}, '''SWAVO'''), officially known as the '''SWAPO Party of Namibia''' is a [[political party]] in [[Namibia]]. It has been the most powerful party in the country since the country became independent from South Africa in 1990. It was a former independence and populist movement in [[South West Africa]] and is the main belligerents in the [[South African Border War|South African Border War.]] 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Foundation=== 
 SWAPO was founded on 19 April 1960. The leaders named the party to show that it represented all Namibians but the organisation is popular among Ovambo people of northern [[Namibia]], who made up nearly half the total population of [[South West Africa]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite news|last=Matundu-Tjiparuro|first=Kae|date=19 April 2010|title=The founder of Swapo|work=New Era (Namibia)}} < /ref >   
   
 ===South West Africa=== 
 During 1962, SWAPO had became the dominant independence, anti-colonial organisation for the people in [[Namibia]]. SWAPO used [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] to fight the colonial South African Defence Force. A major conflict broke out on 26 of August 1966, when a unit of the South African Police exchanged fire with SWAPO forces. This became the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War. 
   
 The neighbouring country of [[Angola]] gained its [[independence]] on 11 November 1975 during the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Portuguese Colonial war]]. The leftist [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola|Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) came to power as the dominant party of Angola. In March 1976, the MPLA offered SWAPO bases in [[Angola]] for launching attacks against the South African military. 
   
 ===Modern Namibia=== 
 Namibia gained its independence in 1990. SWAPO have since become the dominant political party of [[Namibia]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
