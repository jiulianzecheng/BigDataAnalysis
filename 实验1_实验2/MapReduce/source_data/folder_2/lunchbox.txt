[[File:Henkelm√§nner.jpg|thumb|200px|Old German lunch boxes made of steel, called ''Henkelmann'']] 
 A '''lunchbox''' is used to carry a person's [[lunch]]. They can come in many shapes and sizes and by a number of manufacturers. They can also be in the form of a brown [[paper bag]]. 
 The first aluminium lunch box was created in 1954 by a man by the name of Leo May when he happened to crush his tin lunch box.
