Gravity holds the galaxy together. The same applies to  groups and clusters of galaxies, such as our [[Local Group]] where the Milky Way is, and the [[Virgo Cluster]], a collection of more than 1,000 (might even be 2,000) galaxies. The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a [[centre of mass]], which is also an effect of gravity.   
 
 There are various types of galaxies: [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies, which can all be with or without bars.

Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems, [[star cluster]]s, and various [[interstellar cloud]]s. The [[Sun]] is one of the stars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy; the [[Solar System]] includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun. 
 
 Star clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies. [[Globular clusters]] are spherical-shaped star clusters which are part of the outer [[halo]] of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters, [[Messier 15]], has several million stars, packed closely together, with a [[black hole]] at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies.  
 
 Within [[galaxy cluster]]s, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures. 
 
 [[File:NGC 2997 ESO.jpg|thumb|275px|NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy in the [[constellation]] Antila, produces new stars at a rate of 1 or 2 stars per year.]] 
 
 Many galaxies continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see right side image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. This [[star formation]] happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up.  
 
 In the [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[literature]], the word 'Galaxy' with a capital ''G'' is used for our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]]. The billions of other galaxies are written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase ''g''. The term ''Milky Way'' first came out in the English language in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].

 When [[William Herschel]] wrote his [[wikt:catalogue|catalogue]] of deep sky objects, he used the name ''spiral [[nebula]]'' for objects like the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. 200 years later astronomers discovered that they are made of stars as the Milky Way is, so the term 'nebula' is now only used for [[diffuse]] structures within a galaxy. 
 
 == Types == 
 [[File:Hubble sequence photo.png|thumb|273px|Hubble Sequence.]] 
 
 There are two main kinds of galaxies, [[spiral galaxy]] and [[elliptical galaxy]]. They are classified according to the [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble Sequence]].  
 
 === Spiral galaxy === 
 [[File:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|273px|[[NGC 1300]] is a [[barred spiral galaxy]].]] 
 
 A '''spiral galaxy''' is a galaxy that has a [[spiral]] shape. Most of the galaxies in the universe observed by [[astronomer]] < nowiki/ > s are spiral galaxies (about 77%). < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/22382-spiral-galaxy.html|title=Spiral Galaxy Facts  &  Definition|newspaper=Space.com|access-date=2018-01-28}} < /ref >   
 
 They are divided into two : 
 * Barred spiral galaxy (classified as  " SB " ) 
 * Unbarred spiral galaxy (classified as  " SA " ) 
 [[NGC 1300]] and [[NGC 1672]] are examples of barred spiral galaxies. The [[Whirlpool galaxy]] and [[Messier 81]] are examples of unbarred spiral galaxies. 
 
 The identifying characteristics of a spiral galaxy are disk-shaped rotating, spiral arms, and a bulge in the galactic core.  The spiral arms are where new hot stars are born.   " Bulge "  in the galactic core has old stars.  This feature is common to the most spiral galaxies. 
 
 === Elliptical galaxy === 
 [[File:ESO 325-G004 in galaxy cluster Abell S0740 (STScI-PRC2007-08).jpg|thumb|275px|[[ESO 325-G004]] is an [[elliptical galaxy]].]] 
 
 An '''elliptical galaxy''' is a galaxy that has a [[ellipsoid]] (3D of ellipse) shape.  This type of galaxy are dominant in [[universe]], especially in [[galaxy cluster]] < nowiki/ > s.  The shape ranges from circle, ellipse, and cigar-shaped.  In Hubble Sequence, this shape can be represented as class : 
 * E0 (circle-shape) 
 * E53 (ellipse-shape) 
 * E7 (cigar-shaped) 
 Elliptical galaxies have a large range in size. The giant elliptical galaxy can be over a more 1 million [[light year]]s and the smallest (know as  " dwarf elliptical galaxy " ) are less than one-tenth the size of Milky Way < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/proj/basic/galaxies/ellipticals.asp|title=Elliptical Galaxies|website=cas.sdss.org|access-date=2018-01-28}} < /ref >  The [[effective radius]] defines the area from which half its light comes. The mass of elliptical galaxy is also large. A giant elliptical galaxy can have mass of 10 < sup > 13 < /sup >  (many trillions) of solar masses. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/E/Elliptical+Galaxy|title=Elliptical Galaxy {{!}} COSMOS|website=astronomy.swin.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}} < /ref > 
 
 === Other kinds of galaxies === 
 [[File:Busy bees.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Lenticular galaxy]] [[NGC 5308]].]]  
 
 A '''lenticular galaxy''' is a galaxy seen as a disc shape.  The shape of a lenticular galaxy can be between spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy.  The shape can be known by looking at the bulge of the [[galactic center]].  If the bulge is very bright, it is a spiral galaxy < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://cas.sdss.org/dr2/en/proj/basic/galaxies/lenticular.asp|title=Lenticular Galaxies|website=cas.sdss.org|access-date=2018-01-30}} < /ref >
