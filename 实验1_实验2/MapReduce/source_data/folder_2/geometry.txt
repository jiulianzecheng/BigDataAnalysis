 '''Geometry''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: Γεωμετρία ([[Romanization of Greek|romanized]]: ''Geometria'' ([[English language|English]]:  " Land measurement " ) derived from Γη (romanized: Ge; English:  " Earth "  or  " land " ) and also derived from Μέτρον) (romanized: ''Métron''; English:  " A measure " )) is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies the [[size]], [[shape]]s, positions and dimensions of things. We can only see shapes that are [[wikt:flat|flat]] ([[2D]]) or solid ([[3D]]), but [[mathematician]]s (people who study math) are able to study shapes that are [[4D]], 5D, 6D, and so on. 
 
 [[square (geometry)|Squares]], [[circle]]s and [[triangle]]s are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. [[Cube]]s, [[cylinder]]s, [[cone]]s and [[sphere]]s are simple shapes in [[solid geometry]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Plane geometry can be used to [[measure]] the [[area]] and [[perimeter]] of a flat shape. Solid geometry can measure a [[solid]] shape's [[volume]] and [[surface area]]. 
 
 Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find: 
 * the surface area of a [[house]], so they can buy the right amount of [[paint]] 
 * the [[volume]] of a [[box]], to see if it is big enough to hold a [[litre|liter]] of [[food]] 
 * the area of a [[farm]], so it can be divided into equal parts 
 * the [[distance]] around the edge of a [[pond]], to know how much [[fence|fencing]] to [[buy]]. 
 
 == Origins == 
 Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Geometry began as the art of [[surveying]] of [[land]] so that it could be shared fairly between people. The word  " geometry "  is from a Greek word that means  " to measure the land " . It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]] wrote the first book about geometry, a book called ''The Elements''. 
 
 == Non-Euclidean geometry == 
 Plane and solid geometry, as described by Euclid in his textbook [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], is called  " Euclidean Geometry " . This was simply called  " geometry "  for centuries. In the 19th century, mathematicians created several new kinds of geometry that changed the rules of Euclidean geometry. These and earlier kinds were called  " non-Euclidean "  (not created by Euclid). For example, [[hyperbolic geometry]] and elliptic geometry come from changing Euclid's [[parallel postulate]]. 
 
 [[Non-Euclidean geometry]] is more complicated than Euclidean geometry but has many uses. [[Spherical geometry]] for example is used in [[astronomy]] and [[cartography]]. 
 
 == Examples == 
 Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true, called axioms. Such as: 
 * A '''[[point (geometry)|point]]''' is shown on [[paper]] by [[touch]]ing it with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]], without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no [[size]]. 
 * A '''[[straight]] [[line]]''' is the [[short]]est [[distance]] between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of [[wikt:string|string]] from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the [[wikt:path|path]] of the tight string. 
 * A '''[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]''' is a flat [[surface]] that does not [[wikt:stop|stop]] in any [[direction]]. For example, imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.
