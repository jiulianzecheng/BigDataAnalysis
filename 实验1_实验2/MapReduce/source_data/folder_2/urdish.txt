 '''Urdish''' (or '''Urglish'''), a [[portmanteau]] of [[Urdu]] and [[English language|English]], is the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] hybrid use of English and [[Urdu]] in [[Pakistan]], involving [[code-switching]] between these languages where they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. The term ''Urdlish'' is first recorded in 1989. Other less common [[colloquial]] [[portmanteau word]]s for Urdish include (chronologically): ''Urglish'' (recorded from 1995), ''Urdlish'' (1997) and ''Urduish'' (1998). < ref > Lambert, James. 2018.

 Many bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display [[code-switching]] in certain localities and between certain social groups. 
 
 On 14 August 2015, the [[Government of Pakistan]] launched the ''Ilm'' Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. [[Ahsan Iqbal]], Federal Minister of Pakistan, said,  " Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish.
