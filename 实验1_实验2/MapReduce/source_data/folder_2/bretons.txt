 The '''Bretons''' are a distinct [[ethnic group]] in the region of [[Brittany]] in [[France]].  They trace much of their heritage to groups of [[ancient Britons]] who settled the area from south western [[Great Britain]] in the 4th–6th centuries. The region of [[Brittany]] is named after them and many speak ''[[Breton language|Brezhoneg]]'', a [[Brythonic language]] closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and a bit more distantly to [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The Breton language as such is part of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic language]] group. In eastern Brittany, a regional ''[[langue d'oïl]]'' named [[Gallo language|Gallo]] developed; it shares certain points of vocabulary, idiom, and pronunciation with Breton.
