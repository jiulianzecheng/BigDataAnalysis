 Israel has few [[natural resources]] and [[import]]s more [[goods]] than it [[export]]s. It has a relatively high [[standard of living]] and [[life expectancy]]. Almost all of its people [[literacy|can read and write]].

 == History == 
 The [[country]]'s [[history]] goes back thousands of years, to [[Ancient history|ancient]] times. Two world [[religion]]s, [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], began here. It is the place where the Jewish [[nation]] and religion first grew. Jews and Christians call it the [[Holy Land]], because it is the place of many [[wikt:event|events]] [[wikt:describe|described]] in the [[Bible]], and because some [[Judaism#Daily way of life|commandments]] of Jewish law can be accomplished only on its soil. < ref > {{cite web|last=Pitkowski|first=Michael|title=MITZVOT HA-TELUYOT BA'ARETZ|url=https://www.aju.edu/sites/default/files/sites/default/default/docs/Walking%20With%20God/Walking%20With%20Mitzvot/9%20-%20WALKING_WITH_MITZVOT_%5BUNIT_8%5D.pdf|website=The Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies}} < /ref > 
 
 === Premodern === 
 From the time of the first Jewish patriarch [[Abraham]] four thousand years ago, the land now called Israel were populated by [[Canaanite]]s and other [[Semitic people]]s. Around 1400 [[Common Era|BCE]], another Semitic people, called the Hebrews, settled in [[Canaan]] under the leadership of [[Moses]] and [[:en:Joshua|Joshua]]. They were named the “Children of Israel” or “[[Israelite]]s”: which were divided into 12 [[Tribes of Israel|tribe]]s. A few centuries later, the Hebrews made [[Saul]], as their leader. The next king, [[David]], began the [[Kingdom]] of Israel in about 1000 BCE and made the city of Jerusalem his capital.  His son, [[Solomon]], built the [[Temple in Jerusalem|first Temple]] for the [[worship]] of their [[God]]. Solomon died in about 928 BCE. His kingdom broke into two countries. The northern country kept the name Israel.  The southern country, called [[Judah]], kept Jerusalem as its capital. 
 
 The [[Assyrian]]s conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 732 BCE and the [[Babylon]]ians conquered the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BCE and destroyed [[Solomon]]'s Temple.  Many Jews returned from Babylonia and built a country again and rebuilt the Temple. First the [[Persian Empire|Persians]], then the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and then the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] ruled the Land of Israel. 
 
 The Jews fought against the Romans but the Romans defeated them. In 70 [[Common Era|CE]], the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Second Jewish Temple there.  Again, in 135 CE, the Romans defeated the Jews and killed or took many of them to other places.  The number of Jews living in Israel became much smaller. Many were forced to live in other countries. This [[wikt:spread|spreading]] of Jewish [[community|communities]] outside of Israel is called the [[Diaspora]]. 
 
 Many of the Jews who [[wikt:remain|remained]] moved to the [[Galilee]]. Jewish teachers wrote important Jewish books, called the [[Mishnah]] and part of the [[Talmud]] there, in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE. 
 
 The Romans began to call this region by the word that became [[Palestine]] in English.  The Roman and then the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires ruled until 635 CE, when Arabs conquered the region. Different Arab rulers, and for a while [[Crusades|Crusaders]], ruled the land. In 1516, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered the land and ruled the region until the [[20th century]]. 
 
 ===Modern=== 
 Since the Diaspora, there have been many attempts to make a new homeland for the Jewish people. In the 1880s, this wish for a Jewish nation in Israel became a movement called [[Zionism]]. Jews from all over the world began to come to the area and settled in desert zones, then governed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and later by the [[British Empire|British Governments]]. 
 
 On 14 May 1948, [[British Mandate of Palestine|British control over Palestine]] ended. The Jewish inhabitants (under the leadership of [[David Ben-Gurion]]) declared independence for the new Jewish state. Immediately following Israel's [[declaration of independence]], the armies of several nearby countries – including [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Iraq]] – attacked the new country. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/books/review/Margolick-t.html|title=1948 - A History of the First Arab-Israeli War - Benny Morris - Book Review|first=David|last=Margolick|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 May 2008|publisher=}} < /ref >  After a year of fighting, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders, known as the Green Line, were established. [[Jordan]] occupied and later illegally annexed what became known as the [[West Bank]], including [[East Jerusalem]], and Egypt occupied the [[Gaza Strip]].

 [[File:Haifa Bay Panorama.jpg|alt=Haifa Bay from Mount Carmel|thumb|View of [[Haifa]] from [[Mount Carmel]]|269x269px]]The countries of [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] are to the north of Israel; [[Jordan]] is on the east; and [[Egypt]] is to the southwest. Israel also controls 60% of the [[West Bank]] of the [[Jordan River]]. 
 
 Israel has a long [[coastline]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In the south, the town of [[Eilat]] is on the [[Gulf of Aqaba]], which is part of the [[Red Sea]]. 
 
 The Galilee is a fertile and mountainous region in the north. There is a flat plain called the Coastal Plain to the west, near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The Negev Desert is a barren area of flat plains, mountains, and [[crater]]s in the south. There is a range of mountains in the center that runs from the north to south. 
 
 On the eastern side, there is a low area called a depression. The [[Hula Valley]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] are in this low area in the north. The [[Jordan River]] runs from the Sea of Galilee to the [[Dead Sea]]. The land next to the Dead Sea is the lowest in the world. It is -426 & nbsp;meters below [[sea level]]. < ref name= " ADE " > {{cite book| last = Reference| first = Concord| title = The New American Desk Encyclopedia| date = 1984| publisher = Signet| isbn = 978-0-451-12803-4| page = 609 }} < /ref > 
 
 The [[weather]] is normally hot and dry in the summer and mild to cool in the winter. Rain falls mostly in the winter (between the months of November and April). There is more rain in the north than in the south, and hardly any rain in the desert. Snow falls in higher elevations. Israel built a very big [[irrigation]] system to bring water from the north to the dry areas in the south so that [[crop]]s can grow there also. < ref name=ADE/ > 
 
 [[Jerusalem]] is the biggest city in Israel. [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], [[Beersheba]] and [[Rishon LeZion]] are also large cities. Israel officially says that its [[capital city]] is Jerusalem, however, most countries do not [[recognition#Politics|recognize]] that as they believe that Jerusalem should be partitioned, or be under International status. 
 
 == Government == 
 ===National government=== 
 [[File:Satellite image of Israel in January 2003.jpg|thumb|578x578px|'''Satellite image of Israel (2003)''']] 
 Israel is a [[parliamentary democracy]]. All Israeli [[citizen]]s who are 18 years or older have the right to [[vote]].  The Israeli [[parliament]] is called [[Knesset|the Knesset]]. The Knesset has 120 [[wikt:member|members]]. Each member is [[election|elected]] for no more than four years at a time. The Knesset makes [[laws]], helps decide national [[policy]], and approves [[budget]]s and [[tax]]es. 
 
 [[wikt:voter|Voter]]s do not vote for individual [[wikt:candidate|candidate]]s in Knesset [[election]]s. Instead, they vote for a [[Political party|party]]. This party makes a list with all its candidates. The list may have only one candidate or as many as 120 candidates. In an election, the [[wikt:percentage|percentage]] of the vote that each list wins decides how many [[representative]]s, or [[wikt:seat|seats]], the party gets in the Knesset. For example, if a party list gets 33 percent of the vote, it gets 40 Knesset seats. 
 
 Israel has no [[wikt:write|written]] [[constitution]]. Instead, the Knesset made  " [[wikt:basic|Basic]] [[Law]]s " . The Basic Laws say how the [[government]] must work and give [[civil rights]] to the citizens. 
 
 The [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] is the head of Israel's government. He or she is usually the [[wikt:leader|leader]] of the party that has the most seats in the Knesset. The prime minister must keep the support of a majority of Knesset members to stay in office. He or she [[wikt:appoint|appoints]] [[Minister (government)|ministers]] to the [[cabinet]]. The Knesset approves appointments to the Cabinet. The ministers are [[wikt:responsible|responsible]] for subjects such as [[education]], [[defense (military)|defense]], and [[social welfare]]. The prime minister is the head of the cabinet and decides the [[wikt:topic|topics]] of cabinet meetings and makes the final decisions. 
 
 [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] has been the Prime Minister since December 2022. 
 
 The [[President]] is the [[head of state]]. The Knesset elects the president for seven years.  Most of the president's duties are [[ceremony|ceremonial]]: The president signs laws and [[treaty|treaties]] approved by the Knesset, appoints [[judge]]s, and members of some public organizations. He or she also accepts the [[document]]s from [[ambassador]]s and foreign [[diplomat]]s bring when they are [[wikt:appoint|appointed]]. 
 
 [[Isaac Herzog]] has been the President since July 2021. 
 
 === Politics === 
 Israel has many [[political party|political parties]], with a large [[wikt:variety|variety]] of [[wikt:opinion|opinions]]. In the [[2020 Israeli legislative election|elections of 2020]], 20 parties won seats in the [[Knesset]]. 
 
 The parties belong to three main groups. The biggest groups are the [[Zionism|Zionist]] parties. These include the [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]], such as [[HaLikud]]; < ref > {{cite book| last = Rapoport| first = Amnon| title = Experimental Studies of Interactive Decisions| url = https://archive.org/details/experimentalstud0000rapo| year = 1990| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-7923-0685-6| page = [https://archive.org/details/experimentalstud0000rapo/page/n430 413] }} < /ref >  [[Social democracy|social democrats]], such as [[HaAvoda]] (Labor Party); and the [[religious Zionists]]. There are also smaller religious [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] parties, special-interest parties, and Israeli Arab parties. 
 
 A single party usually does not win enough seats in the Knesset by itself to have a [[wikt:majority|majority]], so one of the bigger parties asks for support from the other parties, including the religious parties, to form a [[coalition]] government. This gives these parties a lot of power although they are small. 
 
 The Likud supports [[free market]] [[wikt:policy|policies]] and [[wikt:limit|limited]] government [[wikt:involve|involvement]] in the [[economy]]. Likud  believes strongly in protecting Israel's [[security]]. It wants to give less away in the peace [[wikt:process|process]] for a [[wikt:negotiate|negotiated]] agreement with the [[Palestinian]]s and the Arab states. 
 
 The Labor Party supports government [[wikt:control|control]] of the economy, but also believes in a limited amount of [[free market|free enterprise]]. The party says it will give more away for an agreement with the Palestinians and the Arab states. 
 
 Current [[Knesset]] is the 25th Knesset, sworn in on November 15, 2022. Current government is the [[Sixth Netanyahu Government]], installed on December 29, 2022. 
 
 == Economy == 
 At independence, Israel was a [[Poverty|poor]] country with little [[agricultural]] or [[Industry|industrial]] production. But Israel's [[economy]] has grown tremendously since 1948.  The nation now enjoys a very high standard of living, despite having few [[natural resource]]s and a limited water supply. 
 
 Many immigrants came to Israel in the years immediately after independence.  Many of these immigrants were skilled laborers and [[professional]]s who greatly aided the nation's economic development. 
 
 ===Service industries=== 
 Many of Israel's [[Service sector|service industry]] workers are employed by the government or by businesses owned by the government. Government workers provide many of the [[Service (economics)|services]] that are needed by Israel's large immigrant [[population]], such as housing, [[education]], and job training. 
 
 ===Tourism=== 
 [[Tourism]] is one of the country's important sources of [[Revenue|income]]. Tourists visit many [[Archaeological site|archaeological]], historical, and religious sites; [[museum]]s; [[nature reserve]]s; and beach resorts in Israel. < ref name= " Tourism " > {{cite web|url= http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Items/Attractions.htm| title= Israel's Special Attractions| publisher=Israel Ministry of Tourism| accessdate=2010-06-20}} < /ref > 
 
 Tourists support many of Israel's service industries, especially [[trade]], [[restaurant]]s, and [[hotel]]s. Approximately 4 million tourists visited Israel in 2018. < ref name= " 2009Travelpulse " > {{cite web|title=Israel turned away a record 19,000 visitors in 2018|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-turned-away-a-record-19000-visitors-in-2018/|publisher=The Times of Israel}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Manufacturing === 
 Israeli [[Factory|factories]] produce such [[Good (economics)|goods]] as [[Chemical substance|chemical]] products, [[Electronics|electronic equipment]], [[fertilizer]], [[paper]], [[plastic]]s, processed foods, scientific and optical instruments, [[textile]]s, and [[clothing]]. The cutting of [[import]]ed [[diamond]]s is a major industry. Government-owned plants [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] equipment used by Israel's large armed forces. Israel is the world's largest [[export]]er of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/israel-world-largest-drone-exporter_n_3392034.html|title=Israel Is World's Largest Drones Exporter|publisher=Huffington Post.com|accessdate=January 5, 2014}} < /ref >   Tel Aviv and Haifa are Israel's major manufacturing centers. 
 
 ===Agriculture === 
 [[File:Dattelernte.jpg|279x279px|right|thumb|Harvesting [[Date Palm|date]] in Israel.]] 
 
 Much of the work once done by people is now done by machines. Agricultural products include [[citrus]] and other [[fruit]]s; [[Egg (food)|eggs]]; [[grain]]; [[poultry]]; and [[vegetable]]s. 
 
 The government develops, helps finance, and controls agricultural activity, including [[Fishing industry|fishing]] and [[forestry]]. Israel produces most of the food it needs to feed its people, except for grain. Agricultural exports provide enough income to pay for any necessary food imports.  Most Israeli farmers use modern agricultural methods. Water drawn from the Sea of Galilee irrigates much of the land in Israel. 
 
 Most Israeli [[farm]]s are organized as moshavim or [[kibbutz]]im.  Israel also has some private farms. 
 
 ===Mining=== 
 The Dead Sea, the world's saltiest body of water, is Israel's leading source of [[mineral]]s. [[Bromine]], [[magnesium]], [[potash]] and [[table salt]] are extracted from the sea. Potash, used mainly in fertilizers, is the most important mineral. 
 
 In the Negev Desert, there are [[Mining|mines]] for [[phosphate]]s, [[copper]], [[clay]], and [[gypsum]]. 
 
 ===Energy=== 
 [[File:Elifaz-Solar-Field.jpg|thumb|285x285px|right|Solar field in Kibbutz [[Elifaz, Israel]].]] 
 Israel has few [[energy]] sources. It has no [[coal]] deposits or [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources, and only small amounts of [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]]. As a result, Israel depends on imported crude oil for [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] for transportation, and coal producing electricity for its energy needs. 
 
 [[Solar energy]] – energy from the sun – is used widely to heat water for houses. Israel is developing other ways to use solar energy to power houses and factories. 
 
 In 2008, Israel began investing in building [[Electric vehicle|electric cars]] and the stations to charge them. There may also be large natural gas fields in the Mediterranean Sea that Israel could develop. 
 
 ===International trade=== 
 For 2006, Israeli exports grew by 11% to just over $29 billion; the hi-tech sector accounted for $14 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year. 
 
 Because it has few natural resources, Israel imports more goods than it exports.  The country's main imports include chemicals, [[computer]] equipment, grain, [[iron]] and [[steel]], military equipment, [[petroleum product]]s, rough diamonds, and textiles. 
 
 Israel's main exports are chemical products, citrus fruits, clothing, electronic equipment, fertilizers, polished diamonds, military equipment, and processed foods.  The nation's main trading partners include the [[Benelux|Benelux countries]] ([[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]]); [[Germany]]; [[Italy]]; [[Switzerland]]; the [[United Kingdom]]; and the [[United States]]. 
 
 ===Transportation=== 
 [[File:16-03-30-Ben Gurion International Airport-RalfR-DSCF7550.jpg|thumb|279x279px|right|Reception hall at the [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Ben Gurion Airport]].]] 
 Israel has a well-developed [[transportation]] system.  Most middle-class Israeli families either own a car or have one provided by their employer.  Paved roads reach almost all parts of the country.  [[Public transportation]] both in and between cities is provided primarily by [[bus]]. 
 
 Ben-Gurion Airport is Israel's main international [[airport]]. It is near Tel Aviv.  There are smaller airports are located at Atarot, near Jerusalem, and at Eilat.  El Al, Israel's international [[airline]], flies regularly to the United States, [[Canada]], [[Europe]], and parts of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].  Israel has three major deepwater [[port]]s: Haifa, Ashdod, and Eilat. 
 
 ===Communications=== 
 
 Israel's [[communication]] system is one of the best in the Middle East.  Israel has about 30 daily [[newspaper]]s, about half of which are in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].  The rest are in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish]], or one of several foreign [[language]]s.  The Israel Broadcasting Authority, a public corporation set up by the government, runs the [[television]] and nonmilitary [[radio station]]s.
