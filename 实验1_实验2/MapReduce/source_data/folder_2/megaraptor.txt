 '''''Megaraptor''''' was a large 26 feet (8 m) long late [[Cretaceous]] [[dinosaur]]. It had two large sickle-like [[claw]]s on each hand. It was a lightly built [[biped]], with a large head and sharp, serrated teeth in powerful [[jaw]]s. 
 
 The first [[fossil]] of ''Megaraptor'' to be discovered was one of its [[claw]]s. As they strongly resembled the claws seen in [[Dromeosaur]]s, it was thought that Megaraptor was a large member of that family. < ref name= " novas1998 " > {{cite journal | last1 = Novas | first1 = F.E. | year = 1998 | title = ''Megaraptor namunhuaiquii'', gen. et sp. nov., a large-clawed, Late Cretaceous theropod from Patagonia | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 4–9 | doi = 10.1080/02724634.1998.10011030 }} < /ref >  Later, a complete hand was discovered, revealing the main claw was on its thumb. < ref name= " calvoetal2004 " > {{cite journal | last = Calvo J.O. |display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Phylogenetic status of ''Megaraptor namunhuaiquii'' Novas based on a new specimen from Neuquén, Patagonia, Argentina | url = | journal = Ameghiniana | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 565–575 }} < /ref > 
 
 It is now classified either as a allosauroid [[carnosaur]], related to ''[[Neovenator]]'', or right over on the other side of the [[Theropoda]] as a tyrannosauroid [[coelurosaur]]. < ref name=bensonetal2010 > {{cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = R.B.J. | last2 = Carrano | first2 = M.T | last3 = Brusatte | first3 = S.L. | year = 2010 | title = A new clade of archaic large-bodied predatory dinosaurs (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) that survived to the latest Mesozoic | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 97 | issue = 1| pages = 71–78 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-009-0614-x | pmid=19826771 | bibcode=2010NW.....97...71B| s2cid = 22646156 }} < /ref >
