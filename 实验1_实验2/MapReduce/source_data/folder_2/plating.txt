'''Plating''' is a surface covering in which a [[metal]] is put on another metal surface. Plating has been done for hundreds of years, and it is important for modern technology.  
 
 Plating is used to [[wikt:decoration|decorate]] objects, prevent [[corrosion]], to harden, to improve wearability, to reduce friction, to allow painting, to alter [[conductivity]], and for other purposes. [[Jewelry]] typically uses plating to give a [[silver]] or [[gold]] finish. Objects can be plated with films as thin as a single atom, < ref > {{cite journal|last=Kuo, Hong-Shi |display-authors = etal |title=Noble Metal/W(111) Single-atom tips and their field electron and ion emission characteristics |journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|date= 2006|volume=45|issue=11|pages=8972â€“8983|doi=10.1143/JJAP.45.8972|bibcode = 2006JaJAP..45.8972K |s2cid = 7096640 }} < /ref >  so plating finds uses in [[nanotechnology]]. 
 
 There are several plating methods, and many variations. In one method, a solid surface is covered with a metal sheet, and then heat and pressure are applied to fuse them (a version of this is [[Sheffield plate]]). [[Electroplating]] is a very common method.
