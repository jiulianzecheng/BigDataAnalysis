 A '''tooth''' is one of the hard, white things in the [[mouth]]. '''Teeth''' (plural) are used to help the [[mastication]] process by chewing food. ''Chew'' means to break up and crush food so it can be swallowed (pushed down into the [[stomach]]).  
 
 Most [[vertebrate]]s have teeth. [[Bird]]s are the biggest group that do not. Many [[invertebrate]]s have [[mouthparts]] which, to some extent, act like teeth. Different animals have different kinds of teeth because they eat different foods. Some animals use teeth as a weapon. [[Human]] [[adult]]s usually have 32 teeth. < ref name=COCC > {{cite web |url=http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/basics/mouth-and-teeth-anatomy/article/sw-281474979043251 |title=How many teeth do we have? |author=Tina Callison |website= |publisher=Colgate Oral Care Center |accessdate=10 January 2016 |archive-date=10 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110185332/http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/basics/mouth-and-teeth-anatomy/article/sw-281474979043251 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Human [[children]] usually have 20 teeth. < ref name=COCC/ > 
 
 == Natal teeth == 
 Some human babies are born with teeth. '''Natal teeth''' are teeth that are present at birth. < ref name=USNLM > {{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003268.htm |title=Natal teeth |author= |website= |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=10 January 2016}} < /ref >  These are different from '''neonatal teeth''' which are teeth that emerge during the first month of life. < ref name=USNLM/ >  Natal teeth are not common. They occur in about 1 out of every 2–3 [[thousand]] births. < ref name=USNLM/ >  They are usually found on the [[lower jaw]]. Natal teeth are usually not well attached and may easily [[wikt:wobble|wobble]]. < ref name=USNLM/ > 
 
 == Teeth eruption == 
 '''Deciduous teeth''' or milk teeth or temporary teeth are the first set of teeth for most [[mammal]]s.  Humans have 20 of them. < ref name=COCC/ >  The first teeth (called  " primary teeth " ) start to ''erupt'' (come through the [[gums]] of the [[jaw]]) when a baby is about 6 months old. < ref name=COCC/ >  When these teeth erupt it can really hurt. Babies chew on things to make the pain better. This is called ''teething'' (verb: ''to teethe''). Most children have all 20 teeth by two or three years of age.  
 
 At age 6–7 the '''permanent teeth''' start to erupt. By the age of 11–12 most children have 28 adult teeth. The last four teeth, called 'wisdom teeth' or third [[molar]]s come in by age 17–21 in most people. Some people never grow wisdom teeth. Or they may have only two instead of four.

 The outside white part of teeth is called the ''enamel''. The enamel is made of [[calcium phosphate]] and is very hard. Under the enamel is the [[dentine]]. The dentine is softer than the hard enamel. So it is hurt more by [[tooth decay]] (cavities). Under the dentine is the ''pulp'' which has the [[nerve]]s and [[blood vessel]]s that go to the tooth. This is the part that causes the pain of a [[toothache]]. ''Cementum'' is outside the dentine where there is no enamel. Cementum holds the tooth to the [[bone]] of the [[jaw]].

 == Healthy teeth == 
 If they are protected and kept clean, teeth should stay for a person's whole life. Many people lose their teeth early because they do not do the right things to keep teeth healthy.  
 
 Some things people can do to keep teeth healthy: 
 * Brush teeth after every meal and at bedtime with a soft-bristled brush. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/b/brushing-your-teeth |title=Brushing Your Teeth |author= |website= |publisher=American Dental Association |accessdate=23 April 2016}} < /ref > 
 * [[dental floss|Floss]] after every meal (but ''at least'' once a day at bedtime).{{cn}} Flossing should be done before brushing! 
 * Drink water with [[fluorine|fluoride]] before brushing. Or, use a fluoride mouthrinse (but not for children under age 6). < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/fluoride-supplements |title=Facts About Fluoride |author= |website= |publisher=American Dental Association |accessdate=23 April 2016 |archive-date=30 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430105322/http://www.ada.org/en/member-center/oral-health-topics/fluoride-supplements |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 * See a [[dentist]] every 6 months for a tooth exam and tooth cleaning. 
 * Eat a [[healthy diet]]. 
 ** [[Sugar]]s like [[sucrose]] and [[glucose]] are bad for teeth. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/548toothdecay.html |title=Sugar and Tooth Decay |author=Charles P. Ophardt |date=2003 |website= |publisher=Elmhurst College Department of Dentistry |accessdate=23 April 2016 |archive-date=22 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522173624/http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/548toothdecay.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 ** [[Milk]] and [[cheese]] are good for teeth because they have calcium. < ref name=URMC > {{cite web |url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1 & ContentID=4062 |title=The Best and Worst Foods for Your Teeth |author= |website= |publisher=University of Rochester Medical Center |accessdate=23 April 2016}} < /ref > 
 *** However, milk contains lactose which can cause cavities. Due to this, drinking a lot of milk can still cause cavities. 
 ** Unsweetened (no sugar) [[chewing gum]] helps clean teeth, and makes [[salvia]] and removes food particles. < ref name=URMC/ > 
 *** Nothing with flavor in-between meals, give your saliva the two to three hours it needs to clean teeth. The saliva can not do that if there is a continuous food film being put on to the teeth.  
 *** [[Dehydration]] leads to less saliva production. < ref name=DDPA > {{cite web |url=http://oralhealth.deltadental.com/adult/generalinformation/22,DD205 |title=The Importance of Saliva |author= |website= |publisher=Delta Dental Plans Association |accessdate=23 April 2016 |archive-date=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412020744/http://oralhealth.deltadental.com/Adult/GeneralInformation/22,DD205 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Drink plenty of water every day. < ref name=DDPA/ > 
 
 == Disease of teeth == 
 [[Plaque]] is the soft white substance that forms on teeth when they are not cleaned. It has [[bacteria]] in it that hurt enamel. If plaque is not cleaned off, after 2 days it can become [[tartar]]. Tartar is a hard substance that forms on teeth (mostly near the gums).  Tartar makes [[gums]] unhealthy and makes more bacteria grow on the teeth. 
 
 Plaque is cleaned off with a toothbrush. If tartar forms on teeth, a dentist must clean it off.  
 
 The bacteria that are on teeth eat into the enamel. Cleaning and flossing teeth, eating good foods, and having a dentist take off plaque make less bacteria on teeth. If there is too much bacteria, they eat enamel faster than teeth make enamel. This makes holes in enamel called cavities. When a person gets cavities, he has the [[disease]] [[dental caries]]. Making cavities in enamel happens slowly. But once cavities go through enamel, the soft dentine is hurt much faster. Cavities may be fixed by dentists.
