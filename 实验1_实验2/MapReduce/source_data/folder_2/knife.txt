 A '''knife''' is a metal tool with a sharpened metal blade that is used to cut all sorts of things. The plural form of  " knife "  is  " knives. "  Knives can serve various purposes. Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocketknife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods, table knives, weapons, knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display.  
 
 Archaeologists have discovered sharp-edged tools as ancient as 2.6 million years old. Sharp stone tools became more advanced in design during the late [[Lithic stage|Lithic periods]], and a variety of techniques was used to produce such ‘knives’ in the Neolithic era. The [[Copper Age|copper]] and [[Bronze Age|bronze]] ages followed, and of course brought tremendous changes to the ‘sharp-edge’ technology. These new metal tools were much more durable than stone ones, and hence mining and metal-processing became an important activity. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2017-12-19|title=The History of the Knife Throughout the Ages|url=https://www.theknifehub.com/history-of-knives/|access-date=2021-09-20|website=The Knife Hub|language=en-US}} < /ref >
