 In [[chemistry]] a '''proton''' is a positively charged [[hydrogen]] [[ion]]. According to [[IUPAC]], the name '''hydron''' should be used for such a particle. < ref > {{cite journal | title = Names for hydrogen atoms, ions, and groups, and for reactions involving them (Recommendations 1988) | year = 1968 | volume = 60 | issue = 7 | pages = 1115–6 | journal = [[Pure Appl.

(So chemists use the term ''hydron''  because it covers all three hydrogen ion isotopes.) In 1923, [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Lowry]] used hydrons to  describe [[acid]]s and [[base]]s. They defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors.
