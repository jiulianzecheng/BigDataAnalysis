 '''Anger''' is one of the basic [[emotions]]. It is an [[heritability|inherited]] response, and is common to all [[mammals]] and a number of other animals. It happens when we are [[threat]]ened, offended, wronged, or denied something we really want or need. 
 
 == Psychology of anger == 
 Anger is a normal emotion. It involves a strong, uncomfortable and emotional response to a [[wikt:provoke|provocation]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=Psychiatric mental health Nursing|url=https://archive.org/details/psychiatricmenta0000vide_m6b0|edition=3rd|last=Videbeck|first=Sheila L.|publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins |year=2006|isbn=9780781760331 }} < /ref >  There is a sharp distinction between anger and [[aggression]] (verbal or physical, direct or indirect). Both influence each other. Anger can start aggression or increase its probability or intensity. However, it is not necessary nor sufficient for aggression. < ref name= " EncPsy " > Novaco, Raymond W. 2000. Anger. In ''Encyclopedia of Psychology''. Oxford University Press < /ref > 
 
 Anger is a bit like a [[pressure cooker]]: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes. < ref > {{cite book|title=Anger: deal with it, heal with it, stop it from killing you |url=https://archive.org/details/angerdealwithith00defo |last=DeFoore|first=William|publisher=Health Communications  |year=1991|isbn=9781558741621 }} < /ref > 
 
 People show anger to others by [[Nonverbal communication|their face]], [[body language|what they do with their body]], not [[sympathy|trying to understand or help]] other people's problems, and sometimes acts of aggression or force in public (e.g. punching a wall). < ref name= " OxfDic " > Michael Kent, ''Anger'', The Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science  &  Medicine, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-262845-3}} < /ref >  Animals and humans might try to scare- by making loud sounds, trying to make their bodies look bigger, by showing their teeth, or by staring. 
 
 When we face a challenge, our response may be anger or [[fear]]. It may be difficult to decide whether to face the challenge, or walk away. In [[animal behaviour]] terms, we face the choice of a [[fight or flight response]]. 
 
 == Hormones and body changes == 
 Being angry changes the human body by making the [[heart]] beat faster, increasing [[blood pressure]] (the pressure made by the blood at right angles of the walls of [[blood vessels]]) and increasing amounts of the hormones [[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]] ([[chemical]]s which send messages to parts of the body to make changes). < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medicine.net |title=Anger definition |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33843 |access-date=2008-04-05 |archive-date=2014-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123014235/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33843 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Being angry makes the [[level]]s of the [[hormones]] adrenaline and noradrenaline in the body go up, although this does not last for very long. [[Adrenaline]] quickly makes the body ready to act when there is [[Emergency|important trouble]] by increasing the supply of oxygen and glucose (needed to [[respiration|make energy]]) to the brain and muscles, while slowing less important [[process|things]] the body is doing, like [[digestion|digesting]] food. < ref name= " omd " > [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?epinephrine Epinephrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005194038/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?epinephrine |date=2008-10-05 }} - Online Medical Dictionary < /ref > 
 
 [[Noradrenaline]] is released during [[Stress (medicine)|stress]].  It goes to areas of the [[brain]] which control [[attention]] (how much you think or concentrate) and reactions. It is very important  when the body chooses  " [[fight-or-flight]] "  (attacking or running away). Then it increases [[heart rate]], takes glucose out of storage so it can be used, and increases blood flow to muscles. 
 
 == Symptoms == 
 Anger may be '''passive anger''' or '''aggressive anger'''. 
 These two types of anger have some characteristic [[symptoms]]: 
 
 === Passive anger === 
 Passive anger can be expressed in various ways. Basically it means being angry, but not facing the issue at hand.  
 * '''Walk away''', turn one's back on a crisis, avoid conflict, not arguing back. Consequence: problem not solved, and tends to eat away at one's self-confidence. 
 * '''[[Psychological manipulation]]''', such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them, provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines, [[emotional blackmail]], false tearfulness, feigning illness, sabotaging relationships, using sexual provocation, using a third party to convey negative feelings, withholding money or resources. 
 * '''Indirect aggression''', such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people's backs, giving the [[silent treatment]] or under the breath mutterings, avoiding eye contact, putting people down, [[gossip]]ing, anonymous complaints, [[poison pen letter]]s, stealing, and conning. 
 * '''[[Obsessive compulsive disorder|Obsessive behavior]]''', such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy, making a habit of constantly checking things, over-dieting or overeating, demanding that all jobs be done perfectly. 
 * '''[[Self-blame]]''', such as apologizing too often, being overly self-critical, inviting [[criticism]]. 
 
 ===Aggressive anger=== 
 The symptoms of aggressive anger are: 
 * '''[[Bullying]]'''. 
 * '''[[Destructiveness (phrenology)|Destructiveness]]''', such as destroying objects as in [[vandalism]], [[cruelty to animals|harming animals]], [[child abuse]], destroying a relationship, [[reckless driving]], [[substance abuse]]. 
 * '''Hurtfulness''', such as physical violence, including [[sexual abuse]] and [[rape]], verbal [[abuse]], biased or [[vulgarity|vulgar joke]]s, breaking a confidence, using [[profanity|foul language]], [[empathy#Lack|ignoring people's feelings]], willfully [[discrimination|discriminating]], blaming, punishing people for unwarranted deeds, labeling others. 
 * '''[[Selfishness]]''', such as ignoring others' needs, not responding to requests for help, queue jumping. 
 * '''[[Threat]]s''', such as frightening people by saying how one could harm them, [[vandalism#Vandalism as crime|their property]] or their prospects, finger pointing, fist shaking, wearing clothes or symbols associated with violent behaviour, [[tailgating]], [[road rage]], slamming doors. 
 * '''Unjust blaming''', such as accusing other people for one's own mistakes, blaming people for your own feelings, making general accusations. 
 * '''[[Unpredictability]]''', such as explosive rages over minor frustrations, attacking indiscriminately, dispensing unjust [[punishment]], inflicting harm on others for the sake of it, using alcohol and drugs, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://playangrybirds.co.in |title=playangrybirds.co.in |publisher=playangrybirds.co.in |date=2012-11-03 |access-date=2014-04-25 |archive-date=2014-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419083811/http://playangrybirds.co.in/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  illogical arguments.
