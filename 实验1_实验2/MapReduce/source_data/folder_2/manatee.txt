 '''Manatees''' are large, fully-aquatic [[ocean|marine]] [[mammal]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Sirenia]]. They are sometimes known as '''sea cows'''. The manatees form the [[genus]] '''''Trichechus'''''. There are three manatee species. 
 
 The name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''manatí'', which itself comes from a Carib word meaning  " [[breast]] " . 
 
 == Early sightings == 
 [[Christopher Columbus]], who thought [[mermaid]]s were real, went to the [[water]]s around [[Haiti]], and wrote in his logbook that he had seen three mermaids. He said that they were not as beautiful as everybody said they were. Nowadays, people believe Christopher Columbus had actually seen three manatees. It is possible he saw them [[kiss]]ing one another, which is something they do when the meet each other in the water. 
 
 == Description == 
 [[File:FL fig04.jpg|thumb|Antillean manatee]] 
 Manatees have thick pads around their [[lip]]s and stiff bristles that help them grab food and move it towards the mouth. A manatee eats sea [[grass]] and all kinds of sea [[plant|vegetables]]. All its teeth are shaped like a human's [[molar]]s. The eight hours of chewing each day wears down on their [[teeth]]. In fact, its first two pairs of teeth get so worn out that they simply fall out sometimes. However, manatees can grow new teeth. New teeth are always growing in the back. When front teeth fall out, the back teeth move forward to take their place. In mammals, only [[elephants]] and (quite independently) [[kangaroo]]s have this kind of system. < ref name=Domning > Domning D.P. 1994.

 == Taxonomy == 
 The Sirenia are thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals over 60 million years ago. Their closest living relatives are the [[Proboscidea]] ([[elephant]]s) and Hyracoidea ([[hyrax]]es). < ref name=Domning/ >

 == Habitat == 
 [[File:mapa distribuicao Trichechus.png|right|thumb|220px|Manatees: ''T. manatus'' in green; ''T. inunguis'' in red; ''T. senegalenis'' in orange.]] 
 Manatees live on the coasts of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the rivers.  
 The West African Manatee lives on the western side of Africa, on the shores from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]]. They also live in some rivers like the [[Niger River]] and around [[Lake Chad]].  
 The West Indian Manatee lives in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]], and also on the shores of [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]].  
 The Amazonian Manatee lives in parts of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon Basin]] in South America. 
 
 Manatees live in [[salt water]] and in [[fresh water]]. On the sea shores they mostly live in shallow water, like [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]]s. They also live in [[brackish water]] and rivers. Manatees like bodies of water with a temperature of over 20 & nbsp;°C. 
 
 == Life == 
 [[File:Manatee.jpg|thumb|200px|Three West Indian Manatees.]] 
 They are mainly [[herbivore]]s, spending most of their time grazing in [[wikt:shallow|shallow]] [[water]]s at depths of 1-2 [[metre]]s (3–7 & nbsp;ft).
