 '''Transonic''' means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound (1,236 kph or 768 & nbsp;mph). 
 
 The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed. 
 *[[Subsonic]] 
 *'''Transonic''' 
 *[[Supersonic]] 
 *[[Hypersonic]] 
 
 Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic.  Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at [[mach]] 1, so transonic goes from mach 0.8 to 1.2.  When you are going through transonic speeds, [[Drag (physics)|drag]] increases and it is really hard to go any faster.  This is the [[sound barrier]].
