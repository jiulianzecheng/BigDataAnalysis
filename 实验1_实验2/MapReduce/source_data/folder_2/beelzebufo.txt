 '''''Beelzebufo''''' was a large [[frog]] discovered in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[Madagascar]]. The media called it 'Devil Toad', and 'The Frog From Hell'. The frog lived  some 70 million years ago. < ref name=Susan/ > 
 
 With a body length of about 16 & nbsp;inches (40.5 & nbsp;cm) the frog was larger than any living frog. < ref > The largest living species of frog, the Goliath frog, can grow to just over a foot in length (32 cms) in body length. < /ref >  Its weight in life was about 9-10 [[Pound (mass)|lbs]] (4.5 [[kg]]). < ref name=BBC/ > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/prehistoric/devil-frog/|title=Devil Frogs, Devil Frog Pictures, Devil Frog Facts|date=12 March 2010|publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Relationships == 
 The bones of the [[skull]] roof shows a rugous (wrinkled) external surface, indicating that at least parts of the head may have borne bony [[scute]]s. 
 
 The ''Beelzebufo'' was a member of the horned toad sub-family, the Ceratophryinae. Living members of the family are found only in [[South America]], but were once more widely distributed in [[Gondwana]]. Both South America and Madagascar were part of the [[supercontinent]] Gondwana before it broke up in the Cretaceous. < ref name= " Susan " > {{cite journal |year=2008 |title=A giant frog with South American affinities from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=8 |pages=2951â€“2956 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707599105 |pmid=18287076 |pmc=2268566 |doi-access=free |last1=Evans |first1=S.

 == Habits == 
 ''Beelzebufo'' was an [[ambush]] [[predator]] whose wide mouth let it eat relatively large [[prey]], perhaps even juvenile [[dinosaur]]s. < ref name= " BBC " > {{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7251666.stm |title= 'Frog from hell' fossil unearthed |date= 2008-02-18 |access-date= 2008-02-18  | work=BBC News}} < /ref >  It probably lived in warm, [[season]]ally dry [[habitat]]s with occasional pools of water. Its modern relatives live in similar habitats, and can burrow. < ref name=Susan/ >
