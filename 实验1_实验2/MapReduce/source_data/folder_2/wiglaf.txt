'''Wiglaf''' is a character in the epic poem [[Beowulf]]. He is the orphaned son of a [[War|warrior]] [[king]] who enters the service of [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]], who is now the king of the Geats. He assists the warrior king in his battle against a [[dragon]] which has attacked his kingdom. Beowulf is [[Injury|incapacitated]], but Wiglaf comes to help him and eventually the dragon dies after it is stabbed (cut with a [[blade]]) in the throat. The old king is severely injured and asks to see the dragon's treasure. With his dying words, he crowns Wiglaf as his successor (as he does not have any biological children and all of his [[Ancestor|forebears]] have died). Beowulf is then burned in a [[Norse mythology|Norse]] funeral and Wiglaf rules the kingdom.
