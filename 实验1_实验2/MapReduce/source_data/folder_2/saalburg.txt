 The '''Saalburg''' is a [[Rome|Roman]] fortification in the [[Taunus]] mountains in [[Germany]] and was a stronghold in the Upper Germanic [[Limes]]. 
 
 It was constructed about 90 CE and enlarged until about 210. Then the Romans left it after 260. It is estimated that it was home to a ''cohors equitata'', about 500 cavalry and infantry, to protect the access to the Rhine-Main valley from the [[Germanic people|Germanic tribes]] in the North. Eventually it [[:wikt:decay|decayed]], and its stones were used as a [[quarry]]. 
 
 In [[1897]] [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] ordered that it was rebuilt. Today the Saalburg houses a museum and is a center for Roman archeology. It is located between [[Bad Homburg]] and [[Wehrheim]], some 30 km north of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. 
 
 As part of the Upper Germanic Limes the Saalburg belongs to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] sites since 15. July 2005. < ref > [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/430/multiple=1 & unique_number=499 UNESCO World Heritage] < /ref >
