 '''Agender''' describes a person with no [[gender identity]]. It means that someone does not feel like they fall under any [[gender]].  " A- "  is a [[prefix]] that means 'no' or 'none.' An agender person feels like as if they are neither a male nor a female. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-01-20|title=What Does It Mean to Be Agender?|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/agender|access-date=2021-08-20|website=Healthline|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 Agender is also referred to as  " genderless " ,  " [[genderqueer]] " , or  " ungendered " . Some people who identify themselves as agender may also identify themselves as [[transgender]]. However, some don't, as some feel this implies that they identify as a gender other than their assigned gender at birth, and prefers to stick with  " agender. "  Agender may be seen as a [[non-binary]] gender, or as a statement of not having a gender identity at all. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Nast|first=Condé|date=2016-01-20|title=What It Means to Identify as Agender|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-agender|access-date=2021-08-20|website=Teen Vogue|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Some Agender people more also (but not necessarily) experience [[gender dysphoria]] if they are unable to express their identity as something they're comfortable with. 
 
 A majority of agender people prefer  " [[they]]/them "  as their pronouns, however, some agender people prefer unique pronouns such as  " xe/xer "  or  " ze/zem " , known as [[neopronouns]], others can use conventional pronouns, such as [[he]]/him or [[she]]/her, or uncommon pronouns, such as [[:en:One (pronoun)|one]]/one's or [[It (pronoun)|it]]/its. Some agender people wish to change their bodies to feel more comfortable, while other don't and prefer to stick with the body they already have. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Nast|first=Condé|date=2018-08-07|title=What Does It Mean to Be Agender?|url=https://www.them.us/story/inqueery-agender|access-date=2021-08-20|website=them.|language=en-US}} < /ref >   
 
 Despite identifying as not having a gender, Agender individuals can still identify under any [[sexuality]], and should not be confused with [[asexuality]].
