 A '''turbine''' is an [[engine]] that turns [[fluid]] movement into [[energy]]. This energy can be changed to make electricity with a generator. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/n281 272]}} < /ref >  A turbine is a [[turbomachine]] with normally 1 moving part called a [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] assembly (''a shaft or drum with blades attached'') Moving fluid,  normally water, moves the blades so that they [[:wikt:transfer|transfer]] energy to the rotor. Some early turbine examples include windmills and waterwheels. 
 
 A [[:wikt:casing|casing]] can be placed around the turbine to [[control]] the movement of the fluid. Credit for the invention of the [[steam turbine]] is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer [[Sir Charles Parsons]] (1854 - 1931) for invention of the reaction turbine(turbines that utilize water pressure and water speed to rotate), and to the [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer [[Gustaf de Laval]] (1845-1913) for invention of the [[impulse turbine]]. Modern steam turbines normally utilize both the reaction and impulse turbine in one system.
