 == History == 
 Interpedia was initiated by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]], who posted a message titled  " The Internet Encyclopedia "  on October 25, 1993 to the PACS-L (Public-Access Computer Systems Forum) [[LISTSERV|Listserv]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9310d & L=pacs-l & T=0 & P=1418 |title=PACS-L Listserv message  " The Internet Encyclopedia " , Oct 25, 1993 |access-date=July 17, 2021 |archive-date=September 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916023256/http://listserv.uh.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9310d & L=pacs-l & T=0 & P=1418 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   That message included the following: 
 
 :  " The more I thought about this, the more I realized that such a resource, containing general, encyclopedic knowledge for the layman, would be an important tool for some types of research, and for the Net.Citizenry in general. 
 :  " Ahh.. but what about contributors... where will you find authors to write the short articles you need? Well, I'd first have to start out by finding some way of communicating with an extremely diverse set of people... everyone from [[Linguistics|linguists]], to [[molecular biologist]]s, from [[animal rights]] activists to [[zymurgist]]s, and from [[geographer]]s to gas [[chromotographer]]s. Guess what? :-) The Net provides just such an arena! So I thought about it some more...and came to the conclusion that this is a good idea! "
