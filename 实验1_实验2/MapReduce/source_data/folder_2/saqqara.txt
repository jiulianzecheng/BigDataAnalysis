 '''Saqqara''' ({{lang-ar|سقارة}}), or '''Sakkara''', is a vast ancient burial ground in [[Egypt]],  {{convert|7|by|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in [[area]].  It was the [[necropolis]] for the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian capital, [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/796289136 |title=Places: 796289136 (Saqqarah) |author=Fernandez I; Becker J.  &  Gillies S. |accessdate=March 22, 2013 < !-- 8:14 pm -- > |publisher=Pleiades}} < /ref >   Saqqara has numerous pyramids, including the world famous [[Pyramid of Djoser]]. This is sometimes referred to as the Step Tomb due to its [[rectangle|rectangular]] base, and its 'steps' ([[mastaba]]s: the Arabic word for 'bench'). It is about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Cairo]]. 
 
 [[Djoser]]'s pyramid is the oldest complete stone building complex known. It was built in the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]]. Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara: these pyramids are now in various states of preservation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the whole [[Ancient Egypt|pharaonic period]]. It was an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 & nbsp;years, well into [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. 
 
 In 2018, an undisturbed tomb was discovered. It is believed to be the tomb of the royal priest Wahtye. The intact interior includes figures with colors on sculptures and wall carvings. < ref >  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46580264 < /ref > 
 
 The area from [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]] to [[Dahshur]] was made a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1979. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/86 |title=Memphis and its Necropolis & nbsp;– the Pyramid fields from Giza to Dahshur & nbsp;— UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}} < /ref >  The official name is  " [[Memphis]] and its Necropolis – the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur " .  
 
 Some scholars think the name 'Saqqara' is not taken from the ancient Egyptian funerary god [[Seker|Sokar]], but from a supposed local Berber Tribe called [[Beni Saqqar]]. < ref > Graindorge, Catherine,  " Sokar " .
