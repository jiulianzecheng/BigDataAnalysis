 In [[list of mathematics topics|math]], the distance between the [[near]]est end and the [[far]]thest end of an [[wikt:object|object]] is its '''depth'''. 
 
 For example, you can [[measure]] the depth of a [[box]].  When you find the [[distance]] between one end of the box and another end of the box, you measure the box's depth. < ref > {{Cite web|title=How Corrugated Boxes are Measured - B & B Box Company|url=https://www.b-n-bbox.com/measured.html#:~:text=Length%20-%20As%20you%20view%20the,the%20top,%20determines%20the%20depth.|access-date=2023-11-08|website=www.b-n-bbox.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Depth in Liquids == 
 
 For [[liquids]], the distance between the top or [[surface]] of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth. 
 
 For example, [[water]] is a liquid.  If you fill a [[container]] with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth.  If the depth is big, we say the water is '''deep'''.
