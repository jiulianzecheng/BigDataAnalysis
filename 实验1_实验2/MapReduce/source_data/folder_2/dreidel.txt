 A '''Dreidel''' (סביבון,דרעידעל) is a four-sided top which is played in the [[Hanukkah]] season by [[Jewish]] people. < ref > [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/Games/dreidel/default.htm  Let's Go for a Dreidel Spin!] < /ref >  It is game of luck which uses candy, coins or other betting tokens.  
 
 ==Rules== 
 The players start out with 10 or 15 tokens. Each player puts one token in the pot. The '''Dreidel''' has four sides. נ (Nun), ג (Gimel), ה (Hei), and ש (Shin). Nun means that the player does nothing. Gimel means that the player gets all the tokens from the pot. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.celebrations360.com/index.php/meaning-of-dreidel-symbols-20398/ |title=Meaning of Dreidel Symbols |access-date=2014-12-14 |archive-date=2014-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629050841/http://www.celebrations360.com/index.php/meaning-of-dreidel-symbols-20398/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Hei means that the player gets half of the tokens from the pot. And Shin means that the player has to put one token in the pot.  
 
 
 If the Pot is empty, each player puts one token in the pot. If the pot has an odd number of tokens, one player puts one token in the pot. The player is out if he/she runs out of tokens. Whoever is left standing, or has the most tokens at the end wins the game.
