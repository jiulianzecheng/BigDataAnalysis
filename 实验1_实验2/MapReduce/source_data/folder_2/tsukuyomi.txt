 '''Tsukuyomi''' ({{lang-ja|月読}}), or '''Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto ''' ({{lang-ja|月読尊}}), is the [[god]] of the [[moon]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. He is the brother of [[Amaterasu]], the goddess of the [[sun]], and of [[Susanoo]], the god of the [[sea]] and [[storm|storms]]. 
 
 He killed [[Toyoukebime]] the goddess of food. His sister [[Amaterasu]] was upset at this and said she would stay away from him forever. This is why the sun is up during the day and the moon is up during night. < ref name= " Roberts 2010 " > {{cite book|url=http://www.enryo.ro/carti/Japanese%20mythology%20A%20to%20Z.pdf|title=Japanese Mythology A To Z|last=Roberts|first=Jeremy|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60413-435-3|edition=2nd|location=New York}} < /ref >
