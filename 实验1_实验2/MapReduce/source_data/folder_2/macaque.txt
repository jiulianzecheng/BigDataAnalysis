 The '''macaques''' are a [[genus]] (''Macaca'') of [[Old World monkey]]s of the subfamily Cercopithecinae. < ref > Groves C.P. 2005. Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D.M, eds. ''Mammal Species of the World'', 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 161â€“165. OCLC 62265494. {{ISBN|0-801-88221-4}} < /ref >  The 22 [[species]] of macaques live in sub-Saharan [[Africa]], and more widely in [[Asia]]. One species is the well-known [[Gibraltar]] 'ape'. Macaques are of some interest to human researchers for their social structures, and their usefulness in animal testing, particularly regarding [[eyesight]]. 
 
 == Social behavior == 
 Macaques have a very intricate social structure and [[hierarchy]]. If a macaque of a lower level in the social chain has eaten berries and none are left for a higher-level macaque, then the one higher in status can, within this social organization, remove the berries from the other monkey's mouth. < ref > ''The Life of Mammals'', presented by David Attenborough, 2003 British Broadcasting Corporation. BBC Video. < /ref > 
 
 == Copyright test case == 
 In 2014 [[selfie]]s taken by a crested black macaque seemed to establish a legal [[precedent]], after the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] rejected a  [[copyright]] claim. 
 
 The photos had been sold widely by David Slater, a professional nature [[photographer]], whose [[camera]] was temporarily carried away by a group of macaques. After the photos were uploaded to [[Wikipedia]], the organisation refused to delete them, claiming  " This file is in the public domain, because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested. < ref name= " Fox8-2014-08-06 " > {{cite news |url=http://myfox8.com/2014/08/06/wikimedia-refuses-to-remove-animal-selfie-because-monkey-owns-the-copyright/ |title=Wikimedia refuses to remove animal selfie because monkey 'owns' the photo |work=Fox8 News |publisher=Fox8 News |date=2014-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-06 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Telegraph-2014-08-6 " > {{cite news |last=Sparkes |first=Matthew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11015672/Wikipedia-refuses-to-delete-photo-as-monkey-owns-it.html |title=Wikipedia refuses to delete photo as 'monkey owns it' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=2014-08-06 |accessdate=2014-08-06 }} < /ref >
