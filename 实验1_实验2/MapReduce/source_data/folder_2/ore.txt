An '''ore''' is a [[mineral]] which has a valuable [[metal]] inside it. Ores are usually extracted by being [[mining|mined]]. They can sometimes be found on the Earth's surface. Most ores are [[chemical compound]]s such as [[oxide]]s or [[sulfide]]s.  There are different ways to get the metal out of the ore, which is called [[smelting]].  [[Iron ore]], for example, is smelted in a [[blast furnace]].
