 In different countries people like to roast different things.  People usually roast [[meat]]s such as [[pork]], [[beef]], [[chicken]], [[lamb]], and [[duck]]. The roasted meat, along with its accompanying vegetables, is often called '''a roast'''. 
 
 Most meat being roasted has to cook for a relatively long time, to ensure that it is cooked through.  Variations to this include lamb and beef, which may be left  " pink "  or partially uncooked towards the centre. 
 
 == Other == 
 Other things can be roasted too. For example, [[vegetable]]s, [[coffee]] and [[chocolate]]. Coffee and chocolate are always roasted.
