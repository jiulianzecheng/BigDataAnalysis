 '''Infrasound''' is a type of [[sound]] with a [[frequency]] lower than humans can [[Hearing|hear]]. This frequency is lower than 16 [[hertz]]. When the frequency is lower but the [[Loudness|volume]] is loud enough, humans can feel the [[vibration]]s but cannot hear the infrasound. Younger people have the ability to hear lower and higher frequencies. Some animals including [[whale]] < nowiki/ > s and [[elephant]] < nowiki/ > s can communicate long distances by infrasound.
