 '''Eppertshausen''' is a [[municipality]] in the [[Darmstadt-Dieburg Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Eppertshausen is located in the ''[[Rhine-Main area]]'' 15 & nbsp;km northeast of [[Darmstadt]]. The whole area of the village is 13.11 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  large and it lies 130 – 190 m above sea level. < ref > [http://www.babenhausen.de/ Homepage of the city of Babenhausen], looked up on 19 January 2010, German. < /ref >  It is a plain area with a few hills. 
 
 About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of [[tertiary]] the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]]s sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.

 * [[Rödermark]] and [[Rodgau]] (North) (all Offenbach Rural District)

 The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 Some local people are speaking a regional type ([[dialect]]) of the German [[language]] with a certain tone and special words. It is a [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] (German: ''Hessisch'') spoken in the south of Hesse. This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a [[minority]] and  the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain [[pronunciation]]. 
 
 == History == 
 
 Eppertshausen is an early place where people lived. In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like ''-hausen''. 
 
 In 836 the name of Eppertshausen was written down in a document for the first time. It was owned by the [[monastery]] of the nearby city of [[Seligenstadt]]. 
 
 Formerly the people in Eppertshausen were mostly [[farmer]]s and [[craft]]smen but not [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the [[industrial revolution]] the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for [[metal]] working, [[leather]] [[manufacturing]] and chemical processing. Many men became [[work]]men and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
