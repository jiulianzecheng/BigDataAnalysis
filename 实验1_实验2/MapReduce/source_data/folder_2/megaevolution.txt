 '''Megaevolution''' is a term which describes the most dramatic events in [[evolution]]. By that is not meant a different kind of evolution; rather, it means evolution which produces a tremendous effect. It is not suggested that the evolutionary processes involved are special although, in some cases they might be. Since the word 'macroevolution' can apply to relatively modest changes at the [[species]] and [[genus]] level, 'megaevolution' may be used for really huge changes. 
 
 The [[adaptive radiation]] of  [[birds]] in the [[Lower Cretaceous]], [[teleost]]s in the [[Cretaceous]], [[flowering plants]] in the [[Upper Cretaceous]], [[mammals]] in the [[Eocene]], [[moths]] in the Cretaceous are striking examples of macroevolution. However, there are even more important events in the history of life. An interesting list was prepared by Maynard Smith and Szathmáry, which they called '''the major transitions in evolution'''. They did the list twice. < ref > Maynard Smith J.  &  Szathmáry E. 1995. ''The major transitions in evolution''.

 #[[Self-replication|Replicating]] molecules: change to populations of molecules in protocells 
 #Independent replicators leading to [[chromosomes]] 
 #[[RNA]] as [[gene]] and [[enzyme]] change to [[DNA]] genes and [[protein]] enzymes 
 #Bacterial cells (prokaryotes) leading to cells with [[nuclei]] and [[organelle]]s ([[eukaryotes]]) 
 #[[Asexual]] [[clone]]s leading to [[sexual]] populations 
 #Single-celled organisms leading to [[fungi]], plants and animals 
 #Solitary individuals leading to [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with non-reproducing castes ([[termites]], [[ants]]  &  [[bees]]) 
 #[[Primate]] societies leading to human societies with [[language]]

 Numbers one to six on the list are about events which are of huge importance, but about which we know relatively little. All occurred before (and mostly very much before) the [[paleontology|fossil record]] started, or at least before the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]]. 
 
 Numbers seven and eight on the list are of a different kind from the first six, and are generally not considered by the other authors. Number four is of a type which is not covered by traditional evolutionary theory, The origin of eukaryotic cells is probably due to symbiosis between prokaryotes. This is a kind of evolution which must be a rare event. < ref > Sapp J. 1994. ''Evolution by association: a history of symbiosis''. Oxford University Press. < /ref > < ref > Margulis, Lynn 1998.

 The [[Cambrian explosion]] or Cambrian [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] was the relatively rapid appearance of most major animal [[phyla]] around 530 million years ago (mya) in the [[fossil]] record. < ref name=Berkeley > [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/cambrian/camb.html The Cambrian period] < /ref > < ref name= " BristolUCEtiming " > {{Cite web |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Cambrian/timing/.html |title=The Cambrian explosion – timing |access-date=2013-03-23 |archive-date=2018-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307031317/http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Cambrian/timing.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=Butter > Butterfield N.J.  2001.

 Before about 580 mya it seems that most organisms were simple. They were made of individual [[cell]]s occasionally organized into [[colony (biology)|colonies]].
