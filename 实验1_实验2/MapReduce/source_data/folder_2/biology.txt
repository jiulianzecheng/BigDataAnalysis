 '''Biology'''  is the [[science]] that studies [[life]], [[organism|living things]], and the [[evolution]] of life. Living things include [[animal]]s, [[plants]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. 
 
 The term 'biology' is relatively modern. It was introduced in 1799 by a [[physician]], Thomas Beddoes. < ref > " biology, n. " . OED Online. 2019. Oxford University Press. ''Physiology therefore—or more strictly biology—by which I mean the doctrine of the living system in all its states, appears to be the foundation of ethics and pneumatology.'' < /ref > 
 
 People who study biology are called [[biologists]]. Biology looks at how animals and other [[Organism|living things]] behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and before that it was called  " [[natural history]] " . Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves. 
 
 Biology attempts to answer questions such as: 
 
 *  " What are the characteristics of this living thing? "  ([[comparative anatomy]]) 
 *  " How do the parts work? "  ([[physiology]]) 
 *  " How should we group living things? "  ([[Biological classification|classification]], [[taxonomy]]) 
 *  " What does this living thing do? "  ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]) 
 *  " How does [[heredity|inheritance]] work? "  ([[genetics]]) 
 *  " What is the [[history]] of life? "  ([[palaeontology]]) 
 *  " How do [[Organism|living things]] relate to their [[environment]]? "  ([[ecology]]) 
 
 Modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question:  " How has the living world come to be as it is? "
