 In [[human anatomy]], the '''thigh''' is the area between the [[hip]] ([[pelvis]]) and the [[knee]]. [[Anatomy|Anatomically]], it is part of the [[human leg]]. 
 
 The single [[bone]] in the thigh is called the [[femur]]. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of [[bone tissue]]), and forms a [[ball and socket joint]] at the [[hip]], and a modified [[hinge joint]] at the knee.
