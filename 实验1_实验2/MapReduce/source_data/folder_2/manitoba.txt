 '''Manitoba''' is a province of [[Canada]]. It lies roughly in the centre of Canada. 
 
 Manitoba is the 6th largest province with {{convert|647797|km2}} area. It has the fifth largest number of people, with 1,379,584 in 2020. People from Manitoba are called  " Manitobans " . 
 
 ==History== 
 People have been living in Manitoba for thousands of years. Both the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] from England and many people from [[France]] moved to Manitoba during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. It became part of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1869. The [[Red River Rebellion]], which was started by [[Louis Riel]], began in Manitoba. 
 
 Manitoba became part of Canada on 12 May 1870. It included only the southern part which is nearest to the [[United States]]. But parts of the Northwest Territories were added to Manitoba later on. 
 
 ==Government== 
 The capital of Manitoba is the city of [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]]. Other large cities in Manitoba include Steinbach and Brandon. 
 
 The people of Manitoba elected a legislature. The leader of the government, who is called the ''[[Premier]]'', is the leader of the largest party in the legislature. There is also a [[Lieutenant Governor]], who represents the [[Queen]]. Right now, the premier of Manitoba is Greg Selinger and the Lieutenant Governor is Philip S. Lee. 
 
 The main [[Political party|political parties]] in Manitoba are the [[New Democratic Party]], the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba]], and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].
