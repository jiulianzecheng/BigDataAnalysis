 '''Arthropods''' ([[Greek language]] for  " joint-legged " ) are a large group of [[invertebrate]] animals. [[Insect]]s, [[spider]]s, [[crab]]s, [[shrimp]], [[millipede]]s, and [[centipede]]s are all arthropods. In the [[Biological classification|scientific classification]], all arthropods are members of the [[phylum]] '''[[Arthropoda]]'''. Arthropods have [[segmented]] body, an [[exoskeleton]] and legs with [[joint]]s. Most arthropods live on land, but some live in water. Arthropods have by far the greatest number of [[species]] of any animal group. Arthropods are a source of [[food]] for many animals, including humans. 
 
 == Diversity == 
 Scientists know of more than 1 million [[species]] of arthropods. 80% of all known animal species are arthropods. Many more species have not yet been described. 
 
 Most arthropod species are [[insect]]s.  " Insects are the most diverse organisms in the history of [[life]] " . < ref > Grimaldi D. and Engel M.S. 2005. ''Evolution of the insects''. Cambridge University Press, p1. {{ISBN|0-521-82149-5}} < /ref > 
 
 Most arthropods live on land. The [[phylum]] '''[[Arthropoda]]''' is the only phylum of invertebrates that mostly live on land. But [[crustacea]]ns (crabs, shrimp and their relatives) mostly live in water. 
 
 Arthropods are also the first phylum to develop genuine [[flight]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 Arthropods have a hard [[exoskeleton]]. The exoskeleton reduces the loss of water ([[dessication]]). This helps them to live on land without drying out. 
 
 == Classification == 
 Arthropods are made up of four groups of living animals and one group of extinct animals: 
 # '''Chelicerates''' include [[horseshoe crab]]s, [[spider]]s, [[mites]], and [[scorpion]]s.  
 # '''Myriapods''' include [[millipede]]s and [[centipede]]s.  
 # '''Crustaceans''' include [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[barnacle]]s, [[crayfish]] and [[shrimp]]. Most crustaceans live in water.  
 # '''Hexapods''' include [[insect]]s and a few other organisms. [[Hexapod]]s have six legs. 
 # '''Trilobites''' are a group of [[Extinction|extinct]] arthropods. [[Trilobite]]s all lived in oceans. Trilobites disappeared in the [[Permianâ€“Triassic extinction event]], about 252 million years ago. The trilobites are the second most famous type of fossils, after the dinosaurs.
