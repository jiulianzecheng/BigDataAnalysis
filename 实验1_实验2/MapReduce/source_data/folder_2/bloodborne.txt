'''''Bloodborne''''' is an action [[Role-playing game|RPG]] made by [[FromSoftware]] led by [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]]. It is very similar to FromSoftware's other games, the [[Souls (series)|''Souls'' series]]. The game has many similar features from the ''Souls'' series. Below are the similarities. 
 
 * Both games have a high level of difficulty that cannot be changed. 
 * Enemies and bosses can kill the player in only a few hits. 
 * [[Experience points]] are earned by killing enemies, dropped if the player dies, and disappear forever if the player dies again before getting them back. 
 * Upgradeable weapons and armor can be found in the game world or be bought using experience points. 
 * Rolling is important for dodging enemy attacks. 
 
 While the game has many similarities with the ''Souls'' series, there are also some big differences as well. Below are the differences. 
 
 * The games have a different setting. ''Bloodborne'' takes place in an dark [[Industrial Revolution]]-like world rather then a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe-like one, such as one of the ''Souls'' series. 
 *''Bloodborne'' has a faster pace, where the player can move and attack more quickly. 
 * The player does not have [[Shield|shields]], the player cannot block or parry enemy attacks. 
 * The player can use guns in their offhand for stunning enemies and attacking them from far away. 
 * If the player is hit, the player can regain health if he hits the enemy back before the enemy hits the player again. 
 * In the ''Souls'' games, experience points can be picked up simply by go to where the player died last. In ''Bloodborne'', dropped experience points must be regained by killing the same enemy who killed the player.
