 The '''caper''' (''Capparis spinosa''), is a [[perennial]] winter-[[deciduous]] species that bears rounded, fleshy leaves and big white to pinkish-white [[flower]]s. A caper is also the pickled bud of this plant. Caper bush is present in almost all the countries and is included in the floristic composition of most of them but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain. Although the flora of the [[Mediterranean region]] has considerable endemism, the caper bush could have originated in the tropics, and later been naturalized to the Mediterranean basin.
