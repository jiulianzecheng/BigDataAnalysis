 '''Burgundy''' ({{lang-fr|Bourgogne}}) is a former administrative [[Regions of France|region of France]]. It is now part of the administrative region of [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]]. It was also a historic [[region]] in eastern [[France]]. The [[French language|French]] adjective and name of the inhabitants of the region is ''Bourguignon''. 
 
 With over {{convert|31500|km2}}, it is one of the largest region of France. It covers about 6% of the territory of the country. 
 
 The four [[Departments of France|departments]] in the region were [[Côte-d'Or]], [[Nièvre]], [[Saône-et-Loire]] and [[Yonne]]. Its [[Capital (city)|capital]] was [[Dijon]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Burgundy was named for the Germanic [[Burgundian]] tribe who moved there from an island in the [[Baltic Sea]].  They moved when the [[Roman Empire]] fell apart to set up a kingdom with its own laws. This included part of what is now [[Switzerland]]. 
 
 During the [[Middle Ages]], Burgundy was ruled by [[duke]]s. In the 15th century it was very powerful. The dukes ruled lands as far north as the [[Netherlands]]. After Duke [[Charles the Bold]] died when he wanted to conquer the city of [[Nancy]] in 1477, France took southern Burgundy. It was a [[province]] until 1790. The [[House of Habsburg]] got the northern part, which later became the [[Southern Netherlands]]. 
 
 ==Geography==

 Most of the territory of Burgundy is occupied by a [[plateau]] of low [[hill]]s (the Burgundy Hills) surrounded by [[valley]]s of the main rivers. The valley of the [[Yonne (river)|Yonne]] river and its [[Tributary|tributaries]] is to the north of the region. To the southeast is the valley of the [[Saône]] river. 
 
 In the centre of the plateau (and of the region), there is a group of low mountains: the [[Morvan]]. The highest point in Burgundy, the [[Haut-Folin]] ({{Coord|46|59|46|N|4|02|13|E|name=Haut-Folin|display=inline|region:FR_type:mountain}}), is in these mountains, in the [[Saône-et-Loire]] department. It is {{Convert|901|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. < ref name=pbag > {{cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9613|title=Haut Folin, France |publisher=Peakbagger.com |language= |accessdate=1 October 2014 |date= }} < /ref >
