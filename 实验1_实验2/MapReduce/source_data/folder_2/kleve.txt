 '''Kleve''' ([[Low Rhenish]]: ''Kleef'' or ''Cleves'' in English) is the capital of the [[Kleve Rural District]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. It had about 52,000 people in 2021. 
 
 It was also the capital of the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (disestablished in 1795). 
 
 Kleve lies on the south bank of the [[Rhine]] river and borders the province of [[Gelderland]] in the [[Netherlands]]. 
 
 Partly on Kleve territory lies the [[Klever Reichswald]], an ancient forest dating from the Middle Ages.
