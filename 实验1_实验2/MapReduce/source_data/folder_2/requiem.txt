A '''Requiem''' (or '''Requiem Mass''') is a [[Eucharist]] service in the [[Roman Catholic]] Church to pray for the repose of the soul of someone who has died. There are special words for a Requiem Mass. They are in [[Latin]]. The best-known part of the Requiem Mass starts with the words “Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine” (“Give them eternal rest, O Lord”). This is why it is called a “Requiem”. 
 
 Many [[composer]]s throughout the centuries have composed [[music]] to these words. The word “Requiem” can mean a piece of music which sets the words of the Requiem Mass. 
 
 Celebration of the Eucharist to pray for people who have died goes back at least as far as the [[2nd century]]. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]] the words of the Requiem Mass were sung to [[Gregorian chant]]. 
 
 In the [[Renaissance]] church music was generally [[polyphonic]]. This sort of music, which has several voices weaving in and out of one another, is the kind of music used at the time for requiems. The composer [[Johannes Ockeghem]] is an example of a composer who wrote such music. 
 
 Polyphonic settings of the Requiem Mass continued during the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] ([[17th century|17th]] and early [[18th century|18th centuries]]), even though other musical forms (e.g. [[opera]]) had developed a much more modern style. 
 
 The most famous Requiem from the 18th century is the one by [[Mozart]]. Many musicians think it was one of the greatest pieces of music ever written. It was left unfinished when Mozart died. 
 
 In the [[19th century]] many composers wrote Requiems. Most of these were written for performance at [[concert]]s, not for church services, but they still used the Latin words of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. 
 
 [[Luigi Cherubini]] wrote a Requiem in C minor for the annual remembering of the [[execution]] of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. He wrote another Requiem in D minor, which he wrote for himself. It was performed at his own [[funeral]]. 
 
 [[Giuseppe Verdi]] wrote a very exciting ''Messa da Requiem'' (1874) which sounds very operatic. Verdi rearranged some of the text (words) of the traditional Requiem Mass. 
 
 [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Saint-Saëns]] and [[Dvořák]] all wrote requiems. 
 
 [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] wrote a work which he called ''Ein Deutsches Requiem'' (''A German Requiem''). It is unusual because, instead of setting the traditional Latin words, he took some words from the [[German language|German]] [[translation]] of the [[Bible]]. 
 
 In 1888 [[Gabriel Fauré]] wrote a Requiem which uses an orchestra without [[violin]]s except for a solo violin in the movement called “Sanctus”. In 1900 he made some changes and added an important [[baritone]] solo. 
 
 In the [[20th century]] many composers continued to write Requiems. The most famous one is [[Benjamin Britten|Britten’s]] ''War Requiem'' (1961). Secular Anglican non Roman The message of this work is that war is cruel and pointless. Britten uses the Latin words of the Requiem Mass, but also some [[English language|English]] [[poem]]s by [[Wilfred Owen]] who was killed in the [[First World War]]. The [[baritone]] and [[tenor]] soloists who sing these English words represent the German and the English soldiers. The work was written for [[Coventry]] Cathedral which had been rebuilt after the old cathedral had been totally destroyed in [[World War II]]. 
 
 ==Different parts of a Requiem== 
 ===Older Requiems=== 
 * Introitus: ''Requiem aeternam dona eis, domine'' 
 * Kyrie 
 * Dies irae: ''Dies irae, dies illa solvet saeclum in favilla'' 
 * Offertorium: ''Domine Jesu Christe'' 
 * Sanctus 
 * Benedictus 
 * Agnus Dei 
 * Lux aeterna 
 For example, Mozart's Requiem follows this. In his requiem, the Lux aeterna (written by someone else) is the same as the Introitus, with different words.
