 A '''kapo''' or '''prisoner functionary''' was a special type of [[prisoner]] in the [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[The Holocaust]]. Kapos were chosen by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) camp guards to help run the camps. Some kapos were in charge of other prisoners, who had to do [[forced labor]]. Other kapos did paperwork and kept records in the camps. 
 
 The [[Nazis]] used kapos for many reasons. With kapos helping to run the camps, the camps did not need as many SS guards. The kapos helped the SS control the other prisoners. This made it possible for a small number of SS to run large concentration camps. Also, because kapos were prisoners, they were not paid for their work, so this system also saved a lot of money. 
 
 Even though they were not paid, the kapos got special treatment. They did not have to do hard labor, and they were not [[physical abuse|physically abused]] like the other prisoners. They sometimes got extra food, [[cigarette]]s, [[alcohol]], regular clothes, and private rooms. < ref name= " Wolf " > {{cite journal| author=René Wolf|title=Judgement in the Grey Zone: the Third Auschwitz (Kapo) Trial in Frankfurt 1968| year = 2007 | journal = Journal of Genocide Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 617–663 | doi=10.1080/14623520701644432|s2cid=71894716}} < /ref >  However, to keep this special treatment, the kapos had to keep the SS guards happy. If they did not control the other prisoners well enough, the kapos would lose their jobs. They would become regular prisoners again. 
 
 The SS often chose kapos who were members of [[Violent crime|violent criminal]] [[gang]]s. These kapos often abused other prisoners badly. The SS allowed this abuse to happen. 
 
 ==What did the kapos do?== 
 The SS controlled the concentration camps. However, from day to day, the kapos helped keep the camps running. They made it possible for the camps to run with fewer SS guards. Sometimes, up to 10% of the prisoners at the camps were kapos. < ref name= " ahren " > Yizhak Ahren, [http://www.leo-baeck.org/leobaeck/sachbuchallgemein/buch-03917.html  " Überlebt weil schuldig – schuldig weil überlebt " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205114545/http://www.leo-baeck.org/leobaeck/sachbuchallgemein/buch-03917.html |date=2016-02-05 }} Review of book about Jewish kapos.

 ==Domination and terror== 
 The SS used [[wikt:domination|domination]] and [[wikt:terror|terror]] to control the many prisoners in the camps with just a few SS guards. Kapos were a very important part of this system, where prisoners were completely controlled and always had to be afraid of being hurt or [[murder]]ed. 
 
 The Nazis used many different [[strategy|strategies]] to [[torture]] prisoners mentally and physically, and to keep them under control. These strategies included: < ref name= " ahren "  / > 
 * [[Starvation]]: Even though prisoners were doing hard labor, they were not given enough food to survive 
 * Exhaustion: Prisoners were always weak and [[wikt:exhausted|exhausted]] (very tired) from doing very hard work without enough food 
 * Physical abuse: The SS or the kapos could hit or hurt prisoners any time they wanted to. Prisoners never knew when they might be beaten, [[whip]]ped, or tortured 
 * [[wikt:humiliation|Humiliation]]: The Nazis ran the concentration camps in ways that were humiliating, on purpose. They treated prisoners like they were not even human. 
 * Strict camp rules 
 * If one prisoner did something the SS did not like, whole groups of prisoners would be [[punishment|punished]] 
 
 Kapos helped with all these things. Their job also included pushing the prisoners to work harder. Many kapos, especially the criminals, could be very [[wikt:cruel|cruel]] to prisoners, especially when SS guards were nearby, to show that they were doing their jobs and deserved their special treatment. < ref name= " neuen "  / > < ref name= " wm-prisoner " > [http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/haeftlingsverwaltung_en  " Prisoner administration " ] Wollheim Memorial, official website.

 One non-criminal kapo was Josef Heiden. He was an [[Austria]]n political prisoner (someone put in prison because they disagreed with the Nazis' [[politics|political]] beliefs). Prisoners feared and hated him. He was known as a [[sadism|sadist]] - someone who liked hurting and torturing people. He killed several people while he was a kapo. He was set free from [[Dachau concentration camp]] in 1942, and joined the [[Waffen SS]]. < ref > Ludwig Eiber and Robert Sigel (Editors), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNcFpcyp-YkC & dq=%22josef+heiden%22+dachau & pg=PA18 ''Dachauer Prozesse: NS-Verbrechen vor amerikanischen Militärgerichten in Dachau 1945-1948''], page 18.

 Kapos had a bad [[reputation]] for helping the Nazis and often being cruel. However, a book written about [[Jew]]ish kapos says that many kapos felt caught in the middle. They felt like victims of the Nazis, but at the same time they were helping the Nazis and hurting fellow prisoners. Many of them felt [[guilt]]y about what they did, both at the time and after [[World War II]] ended. < ref name= " ahren "  / > 
 
 ==Kapo ranks== 
 [[File:Oberkapo - Armbinde.jpg|thumb|right|The [[armband]] of an ''oberkapo'']] 
 In the kapo system, there were different types of kapos, who had different [[wikt:rank|ranks]] and different jobs. 
 
 The highest, most powerful job that a prisoner could get was called ''Lagerältester'' ( " camp leader "  or  " camp senior " ). He (or she) answered directly to the camp's ''commandant'' (commander). The Lagerältester had to make sure that everything ran smoothly in the camps every day. < ref name= " Gilbert "  / > < ref > [[Danuta Czech]], ''[[Auschwitz]] Chronicle, 1939–1945'', (1990) {{ISBN|0-8050-5238-0}}, Glossary < /ref > < ref > Stanislav Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'' [[International concentration camp committees|Comité International de Dachau]], Luxemburg (2002) p. 154 {{in lang|de}} < /ref > 
 
 The second-most powerful kapos were the ''Blockältester'' (block or [[barracks]] leader) and the ''Stubenältester'' (room leader). < ref group= " note " > ''Ältester'' is translated into a few different words in English:  " leader " ,  " elder " ,  " supervisor " ,  " commander "  or  " senior " . < /ref >  The ''Blockältester'' was in charge of the prisoners in the barracks, and making sure they followed the rules. < ref name= " Gilbert "  / > < ref name= " mauthausen "  / >  The ''Stubenälteste'' was in charge of a specific room within a barracks. He had to force the prisoners to make the barracks neat and clean. He was also in charge of the room's [[hygiene]], like killing [[Louse|lice]] (which spread diseases like [[typhus]]). 
 
 The ''Blockschreiber'' (registrar or barrack clerk) kept records. For example, he kept track of prisoners during roll calls (where prisoners were forced to stand and be counted over and over). 
 
 Work crews outside the camp were controlled by a ''Vorarbeiter'' (foreman), a Kapo, or ''Oberkapo'' (chief kapo). These functionaries pushed their fellow prisoners to work harder and harder, hitting and beating them, even killing them. < ref name= " wm-prisoner "  / > 
 
 Kapos could often help other prisoners by getting them into better barracks, or getting them assigned to easier work. < ref name= " Gilbert "  / >  Sometimes, kapos were even able to get other prisoners removed from transport lists when they were scheduled to be sent to [[death camp]]s. Some kapos were also able to get prisoners new identities to protect them from [[persecution]] < ref name= " niven " > Bill Niven, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ4ANr2oLpwC & dq=%22robert+siewert%22+german & pg=PA173 ''The Buchenwald child: truth, fiction, and propaganda''] Camden House (2007) {{ISBN|978-1-57113-339-7}}. Retrieved April 15, 2010 < /ref >  When kapos did these things, they usually did them only for people in their own group (for example, people from the same country or [[political party]]). Not every kapo did this, and the ones who did had to be very careful. If the kapos made the SS angry by helping other prisoners, they would lose their jobs and might even be sent to the [[gas chamber]]s to be murdered. [[Heinrich Himmler]] described this in a speech: 
 
 < blockquote > The moment he becomes a ''Kapo'', he no longer sleeps with [the other prisoners]. He is held [[wikt:accountable|accountable]] for the performance of the work, that they are clean, that the beds are well-built.  < nowiki > [...] < /nowiki >  So, he must drive his men. The moment we become dissatisfied with him, he is no longer Kapo, he's back to sleeping with his men. And he knows that he will be beaten to death by them the first night. < br > —Heinrich Himmler, June 21, 1944 < ref name= " Frei-Orth "  / > < /blockquote > 
 
 A kapo who the SS liked could have a camp  " [[career]] "  and be promoted from ''Kapo'' to ''Oberkapo'' and eventually to ''Lagerältester''. However, he could also just as easily be sent to the gas chambers if he did something the SS did not like. < ref > [http://denktag2006.denktag.de/7__Juli__-_19__Oktober_1940.1265.0.html  " 7.
