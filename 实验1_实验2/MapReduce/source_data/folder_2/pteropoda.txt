 '''Pteropods''' are free-swimming [[pelagic]] [[sea snail]]s and [[sea slug]]s. They are [[ocean|marine]] [[opisthobranch]] [[gastropod]]s.   
 
 Are they a natural group? The [[monophyly]] of Pteropoda is the subject of debate.   At present, by molecular studies, the group is [[monophyletic]]. < ref name= " auto " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00351.x|title=Systematic position of the pelagic Thecosomata and Gymnosomata within Opisthobranchia (Mollusca, Gastropoda) - revival of the Pteropoda|journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research|volume=44|issue=2|pages=118|year=2006|last1=Klussmann-Kolb|first1=A.|last2=Dinapoli|first2=A.}} < /ref > 
 
 Pteropoda has  two [[clade]]s [[Thecosomata]], the sea butterflies, and [[Gymnosomata]], the sea angels. The Thecosomata have a shell, while the Gymnosomata  ( " naked body " ) do not. The two clades may or may not be [[Sister group|sister taxa]]. If not, their similarity  may reflect [[adaptation]] to their particular lifestyle. 
 
 All are pelagic, small, and transparent, and swim using wing-like flaps ([[parapodia]]) which protrude from their bodies. 
 
 * Thecosomata:   " sea butterflies " 
 * Gymnosomata:   " sea angels " 
 
 The name  " sea slug "  is most often applied to [[nudibranch]]s, as well as to other marine [[gastropods]] without obvious [[gastropod shell|shell]]s. < ref > Thompson T.E. 1976. ''Biology of opisthobranch molluscs'', vol. 1. Ray Society, vol 151. < /ref >
