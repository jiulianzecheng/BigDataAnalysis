 '''Impeachment''' is a way to remove [[government]] officers from office in some countries.  
 
 Impeachment in the [[United States]] is how the [[House of Representatives]] brings charges against either the [[President]], the [[Vice President]], or any federal officer for misconduct alleged to have been committed. Most impeachments in the United States have been of judges. 
 
 Impeachment is like an [[indictment]] (something that the [[prosecutor]] needs to get before a [[trial]]). Someone is impeached when a [[legislature]] [[vote]]s to do that. Later, there is another vote on whether or not to [[convict]], which is like [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] or not. The second vote may be by the same people who did the impeachment, or someone else as in a [[bicameral]] legislature. Several different types of office holders may be impeached, but cases against the [[President]] or leader of a country usually attract the most attention. 
 
 Two well-known [[Head of state|heads of state]] who were impeached and removed from office were [[Brazil]]ian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] in 2016 and [[South Korea]]n president [[Park Geun-hye]] in 2017. Three [[President of the United States|American presidents]] were impeached: [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], Donald Trump was officially impeached two separate times by the house of representatives. None were removed from office. President [[Richard Nixon]] resigned from the office of President before the House could impeach him, resulting in him being the only U.S. president to resign.
