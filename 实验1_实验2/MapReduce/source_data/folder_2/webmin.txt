 '''Webmin''' is a [[World Wide Web|web]]-based system configuration tool for [[OpenSolaris]], [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]] systems. It can configure many operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services, configuration files, as well as modify and control many [[opensource]] applications, such as the [[Apache HTTP Server]], [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]. 
 
 Webmin is largely based on [[Perl]], running as its own process and [[server|web server]]. It defaults to [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] port 10000 for communicating, and can be configured to use [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] if [[OpenSSL]] is installed with extra required [[Perl]] Modules.
