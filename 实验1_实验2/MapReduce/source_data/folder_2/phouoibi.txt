 == Description == 
 Phouoibi is a goddess who is very [[trick|fickle]] in love. She fell in love with many mortals. However, she doesn't live permanently with anyone of them. She went to many places and made love with many mortals only to discard them later. She lived with her favorite lover for some time and later left him. Her nature symbolizes that wealth doesn't last long. There were frequent wars and natural calamities in ancient times. So, the goddess of paddy is described as very inconstant in favouring to the mankind. < ref name= " Paniker 1997 " / > < ref name= " The Cultural Heritage of Manipur " / > 
 
 According to [[Meitei culture]], the anger of Phouoibi was provoked with the neglect of paddy or rice. The rites and rituals dedicated to the goddess were regularly performed. By doing this, possible misfortunes were warded off that could have came to the peasants. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rJ3DQAAQBAJ & q=neglect+of+paddy+or+rice+provoked+the+anger+of+Phouoibi+%28Goddess+of+paddy%29.+The+rites+and+rituals+of+the+goddess+were+performed+to+ward+off+possible+misfortunes+that+could+come+to+the+peasants. & pg=PT173|title=Orality: the Quest for Meanings|last=Khiangte|first=Zothanchhingi|date=2016-10-28|publisher=Partridge Publishing|isbn=978-1-4828-8671-9|language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= " Krishna " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_xsAwAAQBAJ & q=handful+of+rice+are+offered+to+the+gods%2C+with+a+prayer+for+protection+from+all+dangers.+The+farmer+prays+for+a+doubling+of+the+previous+year%27s+yield.+After+the+harvest%2C+Phoureima+or+Phouoibi%2C+goddess+of+rice%2C+and+Phounngthou & pg=PT384|title=Sacred Plants of India|last=Krishna|first=Nanditha|date=2014-05-15|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-93-5118-691-5|language=en}} < /ref > 
 == Mythology == 
 Once Phouoibi (Fouoibi) set out for a journey along with her sisters (''friends'' in another version), [[Ngaleima]] and [[Thumleima]]. In [[Moirang]], when the goddess was about to cross a river, [[Akongjamba]] came to the spot for hunting. Akongjamba and Phouoibi fell in love at first sight. < ref name= " Devi 2002 " / > 
 
 After some time passed, Phouoibi visited the house of Akongjamba. She disguised herself as a tribal woman (''haonupi'' or ''haonubi''). Akongjamba was not there but Akongjamba's mother didn't give her good hospitality. Akongjamba's mother was about to hit Phouoibi (disguised as a tribal woman) with a swiping broom. If the broom touched the goddess, all her magical powers will get lost. So, Phouoibi fled to a coop (henhouse). She transfigured herself as a chicken. Akongjamba's mother followed her and counted the number of chicken. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why...

Somi|date=2021-06-21|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|isbn=978-93-91149-65-9|language=en}} < /ref >  She found the number of chicken exactly as it was, neither more nor less. So, she went back to her home. Phouoibi spent the night inside the filthy and smelly henhouse. On the next day, she once again took her original form of a beautiful maiden in a glowing dress. She called Akongjamba's mother to come out. She told her that she wanted to give her the payment for spending a night at hers. She shook an enormous heap of golden grain off her body in the middle of the front yard of the house. Then, Phouoibi left the place travelling towards south east. Akongjamba's mother remained surprised. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L. Somi|date=2021-06-21|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|isbn=978-93-91149-65-9|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In another version of the story, Phouoibi stayed a night at the ''yenakha'' (left or right side of the house). The place where the goddess stayed came to be known as ''Phayeng'' (''fai'' or ''phai'' means ''to stay''). < ref name= " Devi 2002 " / > 
 
 Later, [[Akongjamba]] returned home and found the pile of golden grain as high as a hill in front of the courtyard. When asked, his mother told him all the story. He realised that the lady was Phouoibi. He immediately aftered her. On the way, he found her. He pleaded her to return home and live together. But she refused his proposal. She told him that they are not destined to be together to accomplish their work at that birth. Saying this, she left him sorrowfully. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L. Somi|date=2021-06-21|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|isbn=978-93-91149-65-9|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 As Phouoibi travelled towards southeast, she reached a riverbank. She did not know how deep the river was. At that moment, a [[deer]] appeared on the other side of the river. She asked the deer if the river was shallow or not. The deer lied telling her that the river was not deep. Phouoibi went down the river. She could not swim and got drowned. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why... Manipuri Myths Retold|last=Roy|first=L.

 A small ngamhai fish was also swimming there. It helped the drowning goddess to reach the shore of the next riverbank. She thanked the little creature and granted it a boon that it will shine like a mirror in the gleaming water. She wished that the ballad singers will always praise the fish for its silvery beauty whenever they retold her story. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why...

 Then, she glared at the deer. She cursed the deer and all its species that if they tried to eat her creation - [[paddy]], then all their teeth will be fallen. So, still today, the [[deer]]s never eat [[paddy]] because of the fear that their teeth will fall off. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxovEAAAQBAJ & dq=phouoibi & pg=PT30|title=And That Is Why...

 Goddess Phouoibi is offered fruits and vegetables in the four corners of a specially prepared place. The place is divided into 3 sections. At each division, seeds are sown. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 91 " / >  The goddess is invoked by the [[maiba]]s with the sacrifice of black hen and the offering of rice beer. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 92 " > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.108375/page/92/mode/1up?q=Phouoibi+maiba+black+hen+rice+beer+satisfactory+good+crops & view=theater|title=Religion Of Manipur|last=Parratt|first=Saroj Nalini|date=1980|publisher=Firma Klm|pages=92}} < /ref > 
 
 If the previous year's crop harvest was good, the [[maiba]] prayed to the goddess to give them good crops that year too. And if the previous year's crop harvest was not satisfactory, the [[maiba]] prayed to the goddess to give them satisfactory crops with no insects that year. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 92 " / > 
 
 Rice and flowers on the banana leaves are thrown up on the harvest field by the farmers. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 92 " / > 
 
 After threshing, '''Phou Kouba''' (calling the paddy/rice) ceremony is performed. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 93 " > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.108375/page/93/mode/1up?q=Phou+kouba+threshing+rice+mishap+theft+burning+paddy+cow+trespasses+sareng+fish & view=theater|title=Religion Of Manipur|last=Parratt|first=Saroj Nalini|date=1980|publisher=Firma Klm|pages=93}} < /ref >  '''Phoukourol (Phoukouron or Phougourol or Phougouron)''' is a hymn for summoning the spirit of the paddy.

 The '''Phou Kouba''' (calling the paddy/rice) ceremony is more frequently performed in case of mis-happenings to the farmers. Mis-happenings may be theft or burning of the paddy/rice, an animal like cow trespasses the threshing ground, etc. People believe that these are all because of the absence of the goddess. So, they perform the rites and rituals to induce the goddess to stay at their places. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 93 " / > 
 
 In such cases, [[Wallago attu|Sareng fish (Wallago attu, helicopter catfish)]] with rice is the most important offering to goddess Phouoibi. It should be cooked with [[herb]]s and not with [[spices]]. < ref name= " Parratt 1980 93 " / > 
 
 The [[Sorokhaibam|Sharotkhaibam (Sorokhaibam)]] family members used to invoke goddess Phouoibi in ancient times. < ref name= " Sanajaoba 1993 " / >

 Goddess Phouleima often appears in ancient potteries. She is personified in a round black stone sitting in a pot. It is placed upon the bed of rice grains inside the granary.
