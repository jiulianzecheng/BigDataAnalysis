 A '''bier''' is a flat frame, traditionally [[wood]]en but sometimes made of other materials, used to carry a [[corpse]] for [[burial]] in a [[funeral]] [[procession]].  In antiquity it was often simply a wooden board on which the dead was placed covered with a shroud ([[cloth]] used for [[burial]]).  In modern times, however, the corpse is almost never carried on the bier without being first placed in a [[coffin]], though the coffin is sometimes kept open.
