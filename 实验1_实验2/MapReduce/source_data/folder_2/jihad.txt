 Jihad is classified into inner ( " greater " ) ''jihad'', which involves a struggle against one's own base impulses, and external ( " lesser " ) ''jihad'', which is further subdivided into ''jihad of the pen/tongue'' (debate or persuasion) and ''jihad of the sword''. < ref name= " DeLong-Bas 2018 " / > {{sfn|Bonner|2006|p=13}} < ref name=ER/ >  Most Western writers consider external ''jihad'' to have primacy over inner ''jihad'' in the Islamic tradition, while much of contemporary Muslim opinion favors the opposite view.{{sfn|Bonner|2006|p=13}} [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] analysis of a large survey reveals considerable nuance in the conceptions of ''jihad'' held by Muslims around the world. < ref name=gallop/ >

 It is an official part of [[Shi'a Islam|Shia Islam]], but it is not an official part of [[Sunni Islam]], though some call it the sixth [[Five Pillars of Islam|pillar of Islam]]. In some cases, there have been 'Jihads' that have [[Self-immolation|self immolated]] themselves, in order to get into heaven. There are suicide bombers, who blow themselves up, because they think that it is right and that they are cleaning the world's filth. This is, however, wrong in Islam. It is a major sin to commit suicide or homicide. Killing another human being in Islam is the equivalent of killing all of humanity. On the contrary, saving another human being's life is the equivalent of saving all of humanity. 
 
 The sense of jihad as armed resistance was first used in the context of persecution faced by Muslims, as when Muhammad was at Mecca, when the community had two choices: emigration (hijra) or jihad. In Twelver Shia Islam, jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion. A person engaged in ''jihad'' is called a '''mujahid''' (plural: '''mujahideen'''). The term jihad is often rendered in English as  " Holy War " , although this translation is controversial. Today, the word jihad is often used without religious connotations, like the English crusade.
