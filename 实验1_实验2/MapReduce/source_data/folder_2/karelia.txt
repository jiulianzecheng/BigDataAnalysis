 '''Karelia''' ([[Karelian language|Karelian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''Karjala'',  < small > Finnish pronunciation: < /small >  [ˈkɑrjɑlɑ]; [[Russian language|Russian]]: Каре́лия,  < small > tr. < /small >  ''Karélija'', is an area in the eastern Nordic region. 
 
 Most of Karelia belongs to [[Russia]] today. Small parts of Karelia belong to [[Finland]]. On the Russian side of Karelia is the [[Republic of Karelia]]. On the Finnish side are the provinces of [[North Karelia]] and [[South Karelia]]. 
 
 The original people of Karelia are [[Karelians]]. Karelian people speak Karelian, a [[Finnic language]] very close to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. Karelians knew many old [[poems]]. Many poems of the Finnish book [[Kalevala]] are from the Karelians. Today in the Republic of Karelia, Karelians are a [[minority]] and Russians are a [[majority]]. Some people fear Karelian culture and language will die out, due to Soviet immigration to destroy the culture.
