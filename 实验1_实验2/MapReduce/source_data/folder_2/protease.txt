A '''protease''' is a digestive  [[enzyme]]. It breaks down long chains of  [[protein]]s into shorter [[amino acids]]. Proteases have [[convergent evolution|evolved]] a number of times. We know this because different kinds of protease can do the same reaction in completely different ways. Proteases are found in [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[virus]]es. 
 
 Now more than 50 types of protease are known. Each is a separate evolutionary origin of proteolysis. < ref name= " pmid19892822 " > {{cite journal |author=Rawlings N.D; Barrett A.J.  &  Bateman A. 2010 |title=MEROPS: the peptidase database |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |year=2010 |volume=38 |issue=Database issue |pages=D227â€“33  |pmid=19892822 |pmc=2808883 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkp971 |url=}} < /ref > < ref >  MEROPS, the peptide database.

 Protease can be divided into 6 types : 
 *serine proteases 
 *threonine proteases 
 *cysteine proteases 
 *aspartate proteases 
 *metallo proteases 
 *glutamic acid proteases
