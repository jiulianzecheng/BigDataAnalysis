 The '''tropopause''' is a boundary region in [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]]. Here the air ceases to cool at -56.5[[Celsius|°C]] (-70[[Fahrenheit|°F]]), and the air becomes almost completely dry. 
 
 Most commercial aircraft are flown in the tropopause. To put it into even simpler words, the tropopause is the interferance between the [[troposphere]] and the [[stratosphere]].
