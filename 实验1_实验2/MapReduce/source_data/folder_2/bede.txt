He was a member of the sister [[Northumbria]]n [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow]]. He spent a great deal of time at Jarrow with its large library.  Both were in the [[England|English]] [[County Durham|county of Durham]] (now [[Tyne and Wear]]). He is well known as an author and scholar, whose best-known work, ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum'' (''The Ecclesiastical History of the English People'') gained him the title  " The father of [[History of England|English history]] " .

 Bede became respectfully known as ''Venerable Bede'' soon after his death, but this was not linked to consideration for [[Canonization|sainthood]] by the [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]]. Bede himself said he was born in 673 and on the lands of the monastery of Wearmouth. < ref name=Bede19.20 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R.E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin Books, 1990), pp. 19–20 < /ref >  At age seven he was presented by his family to the [[Abbot]] of Wearmouth, Benedict Biscop, to be educated. < ref name=Wormald62 > Patrick Wormald, ''Times of Bede: Studies in Early English Christian Society and its Historian'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), p. 62 < /ref >  Bede doesn't say if his family was [[noble]] or not.{{efn|Sons and daughters of [[noble]] families were often put into the Church at a young age. The child had no say in the matter. But when a son or daughter entered the Church a gift of land or money would be given at that time. About half of all members of the Church were from noble families. < ref > Constance Brittain Bouchard, ''Sword, Miter, and Cloister: Nobility and the Church in Burgundy, 980-1198'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2009), pp. 46, 52 < /ref > }} < ref name=Wormald62/ >  Bede was ordained a deacon when he was nineteen and at age thirty he was ordained a priest. < ref name=Bede20 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin Books, 1990), p. 20 < /ref >  While he was active in his community Bede found study, writing and teaching his favorite activities. < ref name=Bede20/ >  He studied the Bible and Latin. He learnt Latin because that was the language of the Bible and other books in the monastery library. His teaching would have been very basic and his opinions were very conventional (not radical in any way). < ref name=Bede21 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin Books, 1990), p. 21 < /ref >   
 
 At the end of his life, Bede became ill and had difficulty breathing. He went about the tasks of finishing some writings and giving away the few things that he owned. < ref > N.J. Higham, ''(Re-)Reading Bede: The Ecclesiastical History in Context'' (London; New York: Routledge, 2006), p. 18 < /ref >  Bede died on [[Ascension|Ascension Day]], 26 May 735. < ref > Peter Darby, ''Bede and the End of Time'' (Burlington, VT; Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate, 2012), p. 127  &  n. 14 < /ref >

 Bede wrote many scientific, historical and theological works in his time. Many were copied and used by other monasteries in England and [[Western Europe]]. He had one work in particular that he is famous for. One of the most valuable and important sources on [[Anglo-Saxon]] history is Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation''. < ref name=Blair10 > Peter Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain and Early England; 55 B.C.–A.D. 871'' (New York; London: W. W. Norton  &  Company, 1966), p. 10 < /ref >  Bede spent most of his life at Jarrow and this is where he wrote his history. < ref name=Blair10/ >  The [[:en:wikt:ecclesiastical|Ecclesiastical]] History is made up of five books and about 400 pages written in [[Latin language|Latin]]. < ref > Stephen Batchelor, ''Medieval History For Dummies'' (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2010), p. 39 < /ref >  It contains 800 years of the history of [[England]] from the time of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] to the date of its completion (731). < ref name=Blair10/ >  The last chapter is about Bede himself.{{efn|The monk Cuthbert added the account of Bede's death. < ref name=Bede19/ > }} < ref name=Bede19 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans.

 One man who made Bede's work possible was Benedict Biscop. < ref name=Stenton184 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 184 < /ref >   He founded the Wearmouth and Jarrow monasteries. More importantly he created the [[library]] that Bede's got most of his [[:wikt:information|information]] from. < ref name=Stenton185 > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 185 < /ref >  By the time of his death in 689 he had completed four trips to Rome and the south and brought back large collections of books each time. < ref name=Stenton185/ >  Bede's work would still not be possible if not for Ceolfrid, the fourth abbot. He doubled the size of the library left by Benedict Biscop. < ref > ''Abbeys and Churches, of England and Wales; Descriptive, Historical, Pictorial'', ed. T. G. Bonney (London: Cassel, 1887), p. 86 < /ref >  Bede himself traveled no farther than [[York]] and [[Lindisfarne]]. There is no record of his ever visiting libraries in distant places. < ref name=Stenton185/ >  Bede says the following about his sources: 
 {{cquote|With God's help, I, Bede, the servant of Christ and priest of the monastery of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul at Wearmouth and Jarrow, have assembled these facts about the history of the Church in Britain, and of the Church of the English in particular, so far as I have been able to ascertain them from ancient writings, from the traditions of our forebears, and from my own personal knowledge. < ref name=Bede329 > Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', trans. Leo Sherley Price, revsd. R. E. Latham (London; New York: Penguin Books, 1990), p. 329 < /ref > }}
