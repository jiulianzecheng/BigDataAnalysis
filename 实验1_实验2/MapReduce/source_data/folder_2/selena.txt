 Selena was also honoured in a collaboration with cosmetics company MAC, who worked with her sister Suzette to create 14 products, including lipstick and gloss, mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and a compact.  “I am so excited that M.A.C Cosmetics will be releasing a collection in honor of my sister Selena, "  her sister Suzette says, “Helping to create this collection brings me back to all those late-night conversations on our tour bus when she spoke of having her own makeup line one day. If Selena were here she would be beyond ecstatic to have this happening. History is being made.”  < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.beautyrsvp.com/2016/10/03/mac-cosmetics-launched-a-selena-collection/|title=Mac Cosmetics Launched A Selena Collection|first=Amanda|last=Thomas|date=October 3, 2016|website=Beauty RSVP|accessdate=February 14, 2016|archive-date=October 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007031332/http://www.beautyrsvp.com/2016/10/03/mac-cosmetics-launched-a-selena-collection/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
