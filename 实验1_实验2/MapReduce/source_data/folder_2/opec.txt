 According to the [[United States Department of Energy]] Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC crude oil production is an important factor affecting global oil prices. OPEC sets production targets for its member nations and generally, when OPEC production targets are reduced, oil prices increase. < ref name= " EIA_2014 " > {{citation |url=http://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/supply-opec.cfm |work=EIA |year=2014 |title=Energy  &  Financial Markets: what drives crude oil prices? |accessdate=12 December 2014 }} < /ref >   Projections of changes in Saudi production result in changes in the price of [[crude oil]]. < ref name= " EIA_2014 "  / >

 == Aims == 
 
 Member countries of the OPEC came together to form this international organization with several aims. Some of the aims are: 
 * To protect the interest of the member countries. 
 * To make sure that the price of petroleum products do not change much.  
 * To make certain a regular supply of petroleum oil to other countries. 
 * To make sure that member countries get the right amount of money from sale of oil products.  
 * To decide policies to follow relating to production and sale of petroleum oil. 
 
 However, OPEC has not always been able to achieve all these aims.
