'''Víðarr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]:  " the wide ruling one " ) is the [[Æsir|god]] of vengeance in [[Norse mythology]]. A member of the [[Æsir]], he is the son of [[Odin]] and the [[giant]]ess [[Grid (Jotun)|Gríðr]]. During [[Ragnarök]], when the monstrous wolf [[Fenrir]] swallows Odin whole, Víðarr is told to avenge his father's death, as he takes Fenrir by the jaw and tears his head apart, killing Fenrir. He will ultimately survive Ragnarök, as he will then meet with his brother [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]] in [[Iðavöllr]], where [[Asgard]] once lay; there they are joined by their brothers, [[Höðr]] and [[Baldur|Baldr]], as well as Thor's sons, [[Móði and Magni|Magni and Móði]]. After Ragnarok Víðarr will rule after [[Odin]].
