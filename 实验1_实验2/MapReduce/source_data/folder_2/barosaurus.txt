 '''''Barosaurus''''' was a large, long-necked, plant-eating [[dinosaur]]. It lived about 156 to 145 million years ago in the later [[Jurassic]] period. The name ''Barosaurus'' means  " heavy lizard " . It was named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Othniel C. Marsh]] in 1890. ''Barosaurus'' fossils have been found in western [[North America]] and [[East Africa]]. 
 
 The skeleton as set up here suggests the animal could strip leaves or [[frond]]s from the tallest trees. Indeed, ''Barosaurus'' was differently [[proportion]]ed to its close relative ''[[Diplodocus]]''. It had a longer neck and shorter tail, but was about the same length overall. It was longer than ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' or ''[[Brontosaurus]]'', and its skeleton was less robust (slimmer). < ref name= " mcintosh2005 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/thunderlizardssa00tidw|title=Thunder-lizards: the sauropod dinosaurs|last=McIntosh|first=John S.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-253-34542-1|editor=Tidwell, Virginia|location=Bloomington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thunderlizardssa00tidw/page/n50 38]â€“77|chapter=The genus ''Barosaurus'' Marsh (Sauropoda, Diplodocidae)|editor-last2=Carpenter, Ken}} < /ref > 
 
 Sauropod skulls are rarely preserved, and no ''Barosaurus'' skull has yet been found.
