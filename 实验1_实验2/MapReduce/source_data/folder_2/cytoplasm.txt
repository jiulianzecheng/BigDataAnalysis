The '''cytoplasm''' (not to be confused with cytosol) is the [[protoplasm]] of a [[cell]] outside the [[cell nucleus]]. It is the jelly-like material plus the [[organelle]]s outside the [[nucleus]], and inside the [[cell membrane]].  
 
 Many important functions of a cell take place in [[Organelle|organelles]], which are like bits of machinery for doing many jobs. The cytoplasm is highly structured: it is not liquidy, but more of a gelatinous substance, even though it is made out of 75{{ndash}}80% [[water]].  
 
 The cytosol contains a complex mixture of [[cytoskeleton]] filaments, including the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. It includes dissolved molecules, and water that fills much of the cell. Due to this network of fibres, membranes and the many dissolved [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s, the [[cytosol]] does not act like a simple liquid. The main function of the cytoplasm is to hold the [[Organelle|organelles]] in place.
