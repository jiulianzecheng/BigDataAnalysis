 '''Acetate''', also known as '''ethanoate''', is the salt of [[acetic acid]] (vinegar). It is formed when acetic acid is [[deprotonation|deprotonated]]. Its chemical formula is CH < sub > 2 < /sub > COOH < sup > - < /sup >   when it exists as an [[ion]]. Acetate [[salts]] turn brown when heated, and smell like acetic acid. 
 
 Acetate is usually found as part of a compound formed as a salt, for example [[sodium acetate]], often as the product of a [[Acidâ€“base reaction|neutralisation]] reaction of [[acetic acid]] and a [[Base (chemistry)|base]].
