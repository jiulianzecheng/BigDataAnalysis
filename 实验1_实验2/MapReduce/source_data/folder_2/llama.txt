 A '''Llama''' (''Lama glama'') is a [[mammal]] of the ''[[Camelid]]ae'' family. It is from [[South America]], the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] of [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]]. 
 
 Sometimes the name ''llama'' is used for all four South American [[camelid]]s. 
 
 == Llama and humans == 
 The llama was [[Domestication|domesticated]] about 5000 years ago. It was and is used for carrying things, and for [[wool]]. The llama was very important for the [[Inca]]n people. Even today, llamas are used for similar reasons, but will more commonly be used as domesticated pets. 
 
 == Related animals == 
 The llama's close relative is the [[alpaca]], who is a more demure, petite animal in comparison to the llama. Llamas have three related cousins - the [[alpaca]], the [[guanaco]], and the [[vicuña]]. The llama is the national symbol of Bolivia. 
 
 Llamas spit, and travel together. Llamas also have a high content of hemoglobin which causes their blood cells to be oval and not circular. < ref > {{Cite journal|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2647239/|title=Clinical Pathology of Llamas|last=F|first=Garry|date=Mar 1989|journal=The Veterinary Clinics of North America.
