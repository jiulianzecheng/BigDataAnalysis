If an [[average]] adult lost 5 to 8 times this much blood, they could die from exsanguination]]'''Exsanguination''' is losing enough [[blood]] to cause [[death]].  A person does not have to lose all of their blood to '''exsanguinate'''.  People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood. < ref name=tb > {{cite book |last1=Mistovich |first1=Joseph J. | last2=Karren |first2=Keith J. |last3=Hafen |first3=Brent |date=July 18, 2013 |title=Prehospital Emergency Care |edition=10th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0133369137}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[average]] adult has about 4 to 6 [[liter]]s of blood (9 to 12 US pints) in their body. The average man has more blood than the average woman, and people who weigh more or are taller than others have more blood. < ref name=tb/ >   This means a person can die from losing 2  < sup > 1 < /sup > / < sub > 2 < /sub >  to 4 liters of blood.  To compare, this is five to eight times as much blood as people usually give in a [[blood donation]]. < ref name= " Mayo " > {{cite web|url= http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/blood-donation/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020069|title=Blood donation: What you can expect|publisher=Mayo Clinic|date=May 30, 2014|access-date=February 16, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 Children and babies have much less blood than adults, and can exsanguinate by losing much less blood than adults. < ref name=medic > {{cite book |author=Sanders, Mick J.; McKenna, Kim D. | display-authors = etal |date=2011 |title=Mosby's Paramedic Textbook |publisher=Jones  &  Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780323072755}} < /ref > 
 
 Exsanguination is often called '''bleeding to death''' or '''bleeding out'''.  It is a [[medical emergency]]. 
 ==Definition== 
 [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] define exsanguination this way: < ref name=baylor > {{cite journal |author=Asensio JA; Petrone P | display-authors = etal |date=2003 |title=Managing exsanguination: What we know about damage control/bailout is not enough |journal=Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings |publisher=Baylor University Medical Center |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=294–296 | doi = 10.1080/08998280.2003.11927917 | pmid = 16278701 |pmc=1200784 }} < /ref > 
 * The patient has lost over 40% of their blood (2 to 2.4 liters in an average adult) 
 * The patient is still losing blood 
 * The [[bleeding]] is so bad that if it is not stopped quickly, the patient will die 
 
 ==Types of bleeding== 
 [[Image:Bleeding finger.jpg|thumb|An example of ''external'' bleeding: the bleeding can be seen outside the body]] 
 Bleeding can be ''external'' or ''internal''. < ref name=tb/ > 
 
 " External "  means  " outside the body. "   External bleeding is visible - it can be seen outside the body.  For example, a person who cuts their hand and has blood on their hand is having external bleeding. 
 
 " Internal "  means  " inside the body. "   Internal bleeding cannot be seen, because it is inside the body.  For example, a person who is bleeding into their [[brain]] because of a [[stroke]] is having internal bleeding. 
 
 Sometimes, bleeding can be both internal and external.  A person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding, external bleeding, or both. < ref name=hospice/ > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 Exsanguination is usually caused by major [[blood vessel]]s getting injured or breaking open.  Smaller blood vessels bleed less, and bleed slower, so it is harder to exsanguinate if they are injured. < ref name=tb/ > 
 
 ===Injuries=== 
 [[File:Gray1245.png|thumb|125px|right|Injuries that hurt major [[artery|arteries]], like the [[femoral artery]] (in red), can cause exsanguination]] 
 Exsanguination can be caused by trauma ([[injury|injuries]]).  Out of all people who die from injuries, 30-40% die from exsanguination. < ref name=trauma > {{cite journal 
  |author=Geeraedts LMG; Kaasjager HAH | display-authors = etal |date=2009

 [[Penetrating trauma]] (an injury where something breaks the skin) is one of the most common causes of exsanguination. < ref name=asensio/ >   This is especially true for [[gunshot wound]]s to places like the [[heart]], [[chest]], or [[head]], which all have major blood vessels in them. < ref name=trauma/ > < ref name=asensio/ > 
 
 Other injuries that can cause exsanguination include: < ref name=trauma/ > 
 * Injuries which cut major [[artery|arteries]], like the [[aorta]], [[carotid artery]] (in the neck), or [[femoral artery]] (in the [[groin]] and legs) 
 * [[Motor vehicle accident]]s 
 * [[Amputation]] of an arm or leg 
 
 A person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding if: < ref name=medic/ > < ref name=trauma/ > 
 * They are bleeding into their chest or [[abdomen]] (for example, because of [[blunt force trauma]]) 
 * They [[Bone fracture|break]] their [[pelvis]] 
 * They break both of their [[femur]]s (thigh bones) 
 
 Exsanguination is one of the most common causes of death in [[soldier]]s at [[war]]. < ref name=canada > {{cite journal |author=Pannell D; Brisebois R | display-authors = etal |date=2011 |title=Causes of Death in Canadian Forces Members Deployed to Afghanistan and Implications on Tactical Combat Casualty Care Provision |journal=Journal of Trauma – Injury Infection  &  Critical Care |publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins, Inc. |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=S401-7|doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e318232e53f | pmid = 22071995 | url = https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1143 & context=vivianmcalister }} < /ref > < ref name=waronterror > {{cite journal |author=Holcomb JB; McMullin NR | display-authors = etal |date=2007 |title=Causes of Death in U.S. Special Operations Forces in the Global War on Terrorism: 2001-2004 |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_annals-of-surgery_2007-06_245_6/page/986 |journal=Annals of Surgery |publisher=Lippincott Williams  &  Wilkins, Inc. |volume=245 |issue=6 |pages=986–991|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000259433.03754.98 | pmid = 17522526 | pmc = 1876965 |access-date=February 16, 2016}} < /ref >   It is usually caused by gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents, or [[explosion]]s. < ref name=canada/ > < ref name=waronterror/ > 
 
 ===Medical problems=== 
 [[File:SOWM2010 maternal mortality map.svg|thumb|left|Exsanguination after [[childbirth]] is most common in countries colored black and red on this map.  It is least common in countries colored blue and purple.]] 
 Some medical problems can make a person exsanguinate by bleeding internally.  These problems include: < ref name=medic/ > < ref name=hospice/ > 
 * An [[aneurysm]] in the aorta that breaks.  This can cause a person to exsanguinate in just a few minutes. 
 * [[Sepsis]], which can cause the [[infectious disease|infection]] to eat away at the walls of the blood vessels.  Eventually the walls break and the blood vessels start to bleed. 
 * Bleeding after [[childbirth]].  Around the world, one woman dies every two minutes from exsanguination after childbirth.  Most of these deaths happen in [[developing countries]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health |title=Maternal Health |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=United Nations Population Fund |publisher=[[United Nations]] |access-date=February 16, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 * Bleeding from the [[spleen]], [[liver]], or [[intestines]] 
 * A very bad [[peptic ulcer]] 
 * A [[tumor]] that eats into a major blood vessel, like a tumor in the neck that eats into the carotid artery and makes it start bleeding 
 
 ==Effects== 
 [[File:Aortic aneurysm.jpg|right|thumb|Figure A shows a normal [[aorta]]. Figures B and C show [[aneurysm]]s in parts of the aorta.  When an aneurysm breaks (like a popped [[balloon]]), a person can exsanguinate in just minutes.]] 
 If a person is losing blood very quickly (for example, from a broken aortic aneurysm), they will only be conscious for 20 seconds to a few minutes. < ref name=hospice > {{cite web |url=https://www.fraserhealth.ca/media/10FHSymptomGuidelinesExsanguination.pdf |title=Hospice Palliative Care Program: Symptom Guidelines – Exsanguination |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=November 24, 2006 |website=Fraser Health |publisher=Hospice Palliative Care, Clinical Practice Committee, Fraser Health |access-date=February 16, 2016 |archive-date=October 14, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014122341/http://www.fraserhealth.ca/media/10FHSymptomGuidelinesExsanguination.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   If blood loss is slower, and the person does not get medical [[treatment]], they may be conscious for a few hours.  However, they will get more and more [[mental confusion|confused]] and tired as they lose more blood.  Eventually the person will go into a [[coma]] because there is not enough blood left in their body to bring [[oxygen]] to their brain.  Finally their [[cardiac arrest|heart will stop]] and they will die. < ref name=hospice/ > 
 
 ===Exsanguination is a syndrome=== 
 Doctors call exsanguination a [[syndrome]] (a group of [[symptom]]s), because it causes so many problems in the body. < ref name=asensio > {{cite journal |author=Asensio JA; McDuffie L | display-authors = etal |date=2001 |title=Reliable Variables in the Exsanguinated Patient Which Indicate Damage Control and Predict Outcome |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_american-journal-of-surgery_2001-12_182_6/page/743 |journal=American Journal of Surgery |volume=182 |issue=6 |pages=743–751| doi = 10.1016/s0002-9610(01)00809-1 |pmid=11839351 |access-date=February 16, 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 ====Hypothermia==== 
 Blood helps keep us warm.  Because of this, losing a lot of blood causes [[hypothermia]]. < ref name=hospice/ > 
 
 ====Coagulopathy==== 
 [[Coagulopathy]] means that the blood no longer [[blood clotting|clots]] normally. < ref name= " Hunt2014 " > {{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Beverley J.|title=Bleeding and Coagulopathies in Critical Care|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=9|year=2014|pages=847–859|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1208626|pmid=24571757}} < /ref >   When a person loses blood, they also lose the [[platelet]]s and blood-clotting [[proteins]] the blood carried.  These platelets and proteins make the blood clot. < ref name=coagulopathy/ >   If a person loses too much blood, they will not have enough platelets or proteins left to make the blood clot. 
 
 ====Acidosis==== 
 [[Acidosis]] means that the body makes too much [[acid]]. < ref name=tb/ >   Usually, the body makes energy out of oxygen carried in the blood and [[glucose]] (sugar); this is called [[aerobic respiration]]. < ref name=rsc > {{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/cfb/respiration.htm |title=Respiration |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2004 |website=Chemistry for Biologists |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |access-date=February 16, 2016 }} < /ref >  If a person loses a lot of blood, there will not be enough oxygen in the blood that is left to make energy this way. The body switches to [[anaerobic respiration]] and makes energy out of glucose without needing oxygen. However, this creates many acidic waste products (chemicals that the body does not need, which are left over after the body does [[chemical reaction]]s). < ref name=rsc/ >  Eventually, these waste products can build up so much that they poison the body. This is called acidosis. < ref name=medic/ > 
 
 ====Arrhythmia==== 
 When the heart does not get enough blood, it can start [[Cardiac arrhythmia|beating in ways that are not normal]]. < ref name=medic/ >   When this happens because of exsanguination, it usually means that the patient is close to dying. < ref name=trauma/ > 
 
 ====Shock==== 
 If a person loses enough blood, they will go into [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. < ref name=tb/ >   This means the body's most important [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] are not getting the blood, oxygen, and [[nutrient]]s they need to survive.  It also means that the body is not able to get rid of waste products, like acids.  If shock gets bad enough, it will kill the person. < ref name=medic/ > 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 
 ===First aid=== 
 [[File:Boston Marathon explosions (8652877581).jpg|thumbnail|250px|First aid saved many people from exsanguinating after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]s.  This photo shows people giving first aid to stop bleeding]] 
 [[First aid]] is an important first step in treating exsanguination.  Things that regular people can do to help include: < ref name=mayo > {{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-severe-bleeding/basics/art-20056661 |title=Severe Bleeding: First Aid |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=October 21, 2014|website=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |access-date=February 16, 2016 }} < /ref > 
 * Calling [[9-1-1]] or another local [[emergency telephone number]] immediately 
 * Trying to stop the bleeding by: 
 ** Pressing against the place that is bleeding 
 ** If the person is bleeding from an arm or leg, lifting the arm or leg above the level of the person's heart 
 ** Making a [[tourniquet]] and wrapping it tightly above where the person is bleeding 
 * Laying the person down and raising their legs, if possible 
 * If the person is coughing or vomiting blood, turning them on their side so they do not choke 
 * Keeping the person warm 
 * Trying to help the person stay calm 
 
 If possible, a person giving first aid should wear gloves any time they touch another person's blood. The sick or injured person may have an [[infectious disease|infection]] that can be spread through blood, like [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis]]. Wearing gloves will protect the person giving first aid from getting these infections. < ref name=mayo/ > 
 
 First aid saved many lives during the [[Boston Marathon bombing]]s, when ordinary people used belts for tourniquets or used their own hands to press against bleeding wounds. < ref name=marathon > {{cite journal |author=Biddinger, PD; Baggish, A | display-authors = etal |date=2013 |title=Be Prepared – The Boston Marathon and Mass-Casualty Events |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=368 | issue = 21 |pages=1958–1960 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1305480 | pmid = 23635020 }} < /ref >   The three people who died in the [[bomb]]ings died right away. < ref name=marathon/ >  There were many other people who were hurt badly enough that they could have exsanguinated. For example, some people's [[amputation|legs were blown off]] by the bombs. However, because of the help of ordinary people giving first aid (and because of [[Emergency Medical Technician|emergency medical services]]), everyone who did not die right away survived. < ref name=marathon/ > < !-- INTENTIONAL LINK TO DISAMBIGUATION PAGE - THE TOP GIVES THE DEFINITION OF MEDICAL SURVIVAL -- > 
 
 [[File:Blausen 0087 Blood Transfusion.png|thumb|[[Blood transfusion]]s are an important treatment for exsanguination]] 
 
 ===Emergency medical treatments=== 
 [[Emergency medicine|Emergency medical treatments]] for exsanguination include: < ref name=trauma/ > 
 * Tests, like [[ultrasound]]s or [[CT scanning|CT scans]], to find the cause of bleeding if it is internal 
 * Surgery to fix the cause of the bleeding 
 * Treatments to warm the body up 
 * [[Blood transfusion]]s 
 * Giving fluids, like [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], through a needle into a [[vein]] to add to the amount of [[fluid]] that is in the person's body 
 * Giving [[medication]]s to decrease acidosis 
 
 ==Risk factors== 
 
 ===Risk factors for exsanguination=== 
 There are some [[Factor (medicine)|risk factors]] which make a person more likely to exsanguinate.  A few examples are: 
 * Being on anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications).  These can make even a small [[wound]] bleed dangerously. < ref name= " coagulopathy " > {{Cite journal  |author=Shaph DR; Bouillon B | display-authors = etal |date=2013 | title = Management of Bleeding and Coagulopathy Following Major Trauma: An Updated European Guideline | journal = Critical Care | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = R76 | doi = 10.1186/cc12685 | pmid = 23601765 | pmc=4056078}} < /ref > 
 * Having a blood clotting disorder, like [[hemophilia]] < ref name=medic/ > 
 * [[Alcoholism]].  Drinking too much [[alcoholic drink|alcohol]] can [[Cirrhosis|damage the liver]].  If the liver is damaged, it cannot make blood-clotting proteins (like [[fibrinogen]]) as well as a healthy liver does. < ref name=etoh > {{cite journal |author=Tsokos M; Turk EE 2002 |title=Esophageal Variceal Hemorrhage Presenting as Sudden Death in Outpatients |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_archives-of-pathology-laboratory-medicine_2002-10_126_10/page/1197 |journal=Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine |year=2002 |publisher=College of American Pathologists |volume=126 |issue=10 |pages=1197–1200|doi=10.5858/2002-126-1197-EVHPAS |pmid=12296758 }} < /ref >   This makes alcoholics more likely to bleed dangerously if they get hurt.  Liver damage can also lead to a problem called [[esophageal varices]], which can cause a person to exsanguinate by [[hematemesis|throwing up blood]]. < ref name=etoh/ > 
 * Advanced [[cancer]].  Of everyone who has advanced cancer and is not getting treated for their cancer, up to one in 10 people have dangerous bleeding. < ref name=hospice/ > 
 
 ===Risk factors for death from exsanguination=== 
 When a person is exsanguinating, they are more likely to die if: < ref name=asensio/ > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Zhang WB; Wang WY | display-authors = etal |date=2010 |title=Risk Factors of Mortality in Non-Trauma Exsanguinating Patients that Require Damage Control Laparotomy |journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |publisher=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=258–64|doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2009.05087.x |pmid=20575953| s2cid = 29179840 }} < /ref > 
 * They do not get into surgery quickly enough 
 * They have hypothermia, with a temperature under 34° [[Celsius|C]] (93.2° [[Fahrenheit|F]]) 
 * Their blood is more acidic because of acidosis 
 * They needed to be given more than 4 liters of blood, or over 10 liters of fluids, to replace the blood they lost 
 * They lost more than 15 [[milliliter|mL]] of blood per minute (losing blood this fast, the person would exsanguinate in less than 30–40 minutes) 
 * They have lower numbers of platelets when they first get to the [[hospital]] 
 * They are [[elderly]]
