 '''Grasshoppers''' are insects with long, powerful back legs which they use for jumping. They generally live in dry habitats, such as fields, gardens and meadows, with lots of grass. They are in the suborder '''Caelifera''', which includes [[locust]]s. There are 11,000 species, of which 10,000 are in the family [[Acrididae]]. 
 
 To distinguish grasshoppers from [[bush-cricket]]s or [[katydid]]s, they are sometimes referred to as the ''short-horned grasshopper''. Species which change colour and behaviour at high population densities are called [[locusts]]. 
 
 Grasshoppers prefer to eat [[grasses]], [[leaves]] and [[cereal]] [[crops]], but many grasshoppers are omnivorous. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://openagricola.nal.usda.gov/Record/IND21638560|title=Grasshopper (Orthoptera: Acrididae) Foraging on grasshopper feces: observational and rubidium-labeling studies|authors=O'Neill, Kevin M.; Woods, Stephen A.; Streett, Douglas A.|journal=Environmental Entomology|volume=26|issue=6|year=1997|pages=1224â€“1231|doi=10.1093/ee/26.6.1224|access-date=2013-07-03|archive-date=2015-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131913/http://openagricola.nal.usda.gov/Record/IND21638560|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Many grasshoppers eat from several host plants in one day, while others stay on one host plant.

 == As food == 
 Grasshoppers make good food for some. As an example, in southern [[Mexico]], ''chapulines'' (grasshoppers of the genus ''Sphenarium'') are often eaten. They are high in [[protein]], minerals and [[vitamins]].  
 
 They are usually collected at [[dusk]], using lamps or electric lighting, in sweep nets. Sometimes they are placed in water for 24 hours, after which they can be [[boiling|boiled]] or eaten raw, sun-dried, fried, flavoured with [[spices]], such as [[garlic]], [[onions]], [[chile|chilli]], drenched in [[lime]], and used in [[soup]] or as a filling for various dishes. They are abundant in Central and Southern Mexican food and street [[markets]].
