'''Laparoscopy''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] technique. It is commonly called  " keyhole surgery " . The surgery is done through a small incision (~opening or cut). This is a  " minimally invasive procedure " . Its benefits include: reduced pain, reduced bleeding, and shorter recovery time. < ref > Stephen W, Eubanks S, Lee L, Swanstrom LL, Soper NJ, eds.

 It needs special surgical instruments, and a [[fibre optic]] system so the surgeon can see into the right place. 
 
 The first laparoscopic procedure was performed by German surgeon [[Georg Kelling]] in 1901.
