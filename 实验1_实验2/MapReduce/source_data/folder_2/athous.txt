''Athous'' is one of the largest genera of click beetles, containing more than a hundred species. < ref name= " biolib " > [https://www.biolib.cz/en/taxon/id9251/ BioLib alphabetic index of species] < /ref > 
 
 Species were first organised into this genus by [[Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz]] in 1829. 
 
 The [[larva]]e, called  " wireworms " , feed on roots of plants and also on seeds lying on the ground. They are considered [[pest]]s by farmers because they damage [[crop]]s. < ref > {{cite book |title= International Wildlife Encyclopedia|author=Maurice Burton |author2=Robert Burton |volume=4 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7614-7266-7 |pages=466â€“467|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761472703}} < /ref >  They also live in [[rotting]] wood. < ref > {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W7OOXMBBUNsC & pg=PA150 |title= Field Guide to Beetles of California |author=Arthur V.
