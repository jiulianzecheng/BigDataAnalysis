 A '''sensor''' is a [[device]] that measures a [[physical quantity]] and converts it into a '[[Signal processing|signal]]' which can be read by an observer or by an instrument. For example, a mercury [[thermometer]] converts the measured temperature into the expansion and contraction of a [[liquid]] which can be read on a calibrated glass tube.  [[Video camera]]s and a [[digital camera]]s have an [[image sensor]]. 
 
 There are many different types of sensors. Some are used in everyday objects, and some are separate. 
 
 == Thermal sensors == 
 A sensor that detects [[temperature]]. Thermal sensors are in many [[Laptop|laptops]] and computers in order to sound an alarm when a certain temperature has been exceeded. 
 * temperature sensors: [[thermometers]], [[thermostat]]s 
 * heat sensors: [[Bolometric magnitude|bolometer]], [[calorimeter]] 
 
 == Electromagnetic sensors == 
 An electronic device used to measure a physical quantity such as pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g. a [[voltage]]). 
 * [[electrical resistance]] sensors: ohmmeter 
 * electrical [[voltage]] sensors: [[voltmeter]] 
 * [[electrical power]] sensors: watt-hour meter 
 * [[magnetism]] sensors: magnetic compass 
 * [[metal detector]]s 
 * [[Radar]] 
 
 An electromagnetic sensor is anything that can detect things like [[photon]]s, [[electron]]s, [[magnetic field]] < nowiki/ > s etc. It can be as simple as a white wall, a sheet of white paper, etc., or as new as a [[charge-coupled device]]. When a [[laser]] is aimed at a detection screen, a bright spot can be seen on the screen, or when an electron hits the [[phosphor]]s on another kind of screen, it makes that screen glow. 
 
 == Mechanical sensors == 
 * Pressure sensors: [[barometer]] 
 * [[Vibration]] and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] sensors 
 
 == Motion sensors == 
 A motion sensor detects physical movement in a given area. 
 * Radar gun, [[tachometer]] 
 * [[Speedometer]] 
 
 == Car sensors == 
 * reversing sensor 
 * curb feeler
