 His Latin is thought to be the model of Classical Latin. He introduced Greek [[philosophy]] to the Romans. 
 
 Cicero was heavily involved in the politics of the [[Roman Republic]]. After [[Julius Caesar]]'s death, Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]]. In the power struggle, Cicero attacked Antony in a series of speeches. Cicero was [[proscription|proscribed]] as an [[enemy of the state]] by the [[Second Triumvirate]]. He was executed in 43 BC by soldiers working for the Triumvirate.
