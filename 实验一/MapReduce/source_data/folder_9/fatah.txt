 '''Fatah''' is a [[Palestine|Palestinian nationalist]] [[political party]]. Fatah is an [[acronym]] for Harakat At-Tahriri Al-Filistiniya. That means Palestinian National Liberation Movement in English. It was created by [[Yasser Arafat]] in the late [[1950s]].  
 
 In 1968 Fatah joined the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]], and in 1969 it got a leadership role. < ref > {{cite web

 The [[politics|political]] part of the party is not considered a [[Terrorism|terrorist group]] by any [[country]], but its [[military]] part, the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades]] is considered a terrorist group. Fatah says that the Brigades are not a part of the party but Israel says that Fatah supports the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. 
 
 == Fatah and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades == 
 Leaders of the brigades, and other members have said they are a military group that is a part of Fatah. On their website, and on posters they post the Fatah [[Emblem]]. Leaders of Fatah have said they did not create the brigades, or make them the military of Fatah. Since 2002 leaders in Fatah have tried to get the brigades to stop attacking Israeli citizens. < ref > {{cite book
