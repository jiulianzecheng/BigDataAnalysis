 '''Northamptonshire''' (abbreviated '''''Northants''''' or '''''N'hants''''') is a [[county]] in central [[England]] with a population of 629,676 ([[2001]] [[census]]). It has [[border]]s with [[Warwickshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Rutland]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[County of Peterborough|Peterborough]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]] (including the [[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]]), [[Oxfordshire]], and [[Lincolnshire]] (England's shortest county boundary: 19 metres). The county town is [[Northampton]]. 
 
 Northamptonshire has often been called the county of  " [[squire]]s and [[spire]]s "  due to its wide variety of historic buildings and country houses. 
 
 [[Northampton]] is by far the largest town in the county, with a [[population]] of 194,122. This is followed by [[Corby]] (53,174), [[Wellingborough]] (48,428), [[Kettering]] (47,000), [[Rushden]] (25,849) and [[Daventry]] (22,367). Most of the county's population is concentrated in a central north-south. 
 
 '''Cherwell Edge''' in Northamptonshire ({{Coord|52|6|N|1|17|W|}}) is near the [[River Cherwell]], north-west of [[Banbury]], [[England]]. The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared many years ago. The area now also covers the nearby [[Cherwell Edge Golf Club]] that was recently built by it too. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.uk-golfguide.com/england/25356_reports.html |title=UK Golfguide homepage |accessdate=19 November 2010 |archive-date=6 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306033851/http://www.uk-golfguide.com/england/25356_reports.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.cherwelledgegolfclub.co.uk/ |title=Cherwell Edge Golf Club homepage |accessdate=19 November 2010}} < /ref >  The [[Golf club (institution)|golf club]] is used by various local residents.
