 '''Fermentation''' is when a [[cell]] uses [[sugar]] for energy without using [[oxygen]] at the same time.   
 
 'Fermentation' also describes growing [[microorganisms]] on a growth medium. This is done to get a chemical product. French microbiologist [[Louis Pasteur]] studied fermentation and its microbial causes. The science of fermentation is known as ''zymology''. 
 
 [[Yeast]] is an organism that ferments.  When yeast ferments sugar, the yeast uses sugar and produces [[Ethanol|alcohol]].  The process uses the [[coenzyme]] [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]: In [[metabolism]], NAD helps [[redox]] reactions, carrying [[electrons]] from one reaction to another. Fermentation is a less efficient form of [[respiration]] than oxidative respiration (respiration using oxygen). 
 
 The ethyl alcohol produced by yeast is used to make [[beverage]]s or [[biofuel]]. Yeast can be also used to grow bakery products like bread and cakes faster. In some cases yeast might be used to speed up the process of creation of [[wine]]. 
 
 Other cells make [[vinegar]] or [[lactic acid]] when they ferment sugar.  In a different way, the fermentation process can continue and turn the alcohol into vinegar i.e. acetic acid. 
 
 == Types of fermentation == 
 When yeast ferments, it breaks down the [[glucose]] (C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub > ) into [[ethanol]] (CH < sub > 3 < /sub > CH < sub > 2 < /sub > OH) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO < sub > 2 < /sub > ). 
 * [[Ethanol fermentation]] always produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. It is important in [[bread]]-making, [[brewing]], and [[wine]]-making. 
 * [[Lactic acid fermentation]] produces [[lactic acid]]. It happens in [[muscle]]s of [[animal]]s when they need lots of energy fast. The pain of a cramped muscle is caused by the build-up of lactic acid. The pain eases as the product is taken away by the blood supply.
