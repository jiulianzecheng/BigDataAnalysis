 A '''restaurant''' (sometimes known as a '''diner''') is a place where cooked [[food]] is sold to the [[public]], and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal.   
 
 Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food. [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], and [[Pizza Hut]] are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve [[fast food]], that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the [[car]] to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called [[drive-through]]s. 
 
 There are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called [[fast casual restaurant]]s. [[Applebee's]] and [[Perkins]] are examples of this type of chain restaurant. 
 
 [[Haute cuisine]] or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the ''[[Michelin Guide]]'', the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]] than to [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]] together. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.michelin.com/corporate/EN/content/newsAndPress/products_and_services/Travel%2520Services/MICHELIN-Guide-Tokyo-Yokohama-Shonan%25202012.pdf |title=Michelin Guide Tokyo Yokohama Shonan 2012, with list of starred restaurants |access-date=2014-09-03 |archive-date=2011-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218132739/http://www.michelin.com/corporate/EN/content/newsAndPress/products_and_services/Travel%20Services/MICHELIN-Guide-Tokyo-Yokohama-Shonan%202012.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.michelin.com.au/content/download/4430/204405/file/MICHELIN%2520Guide%2520Kyoto,%2520Osaka,%2520Kobe%2520and%2520Nara%25202012%2520Summary.pdf |title=Michelin Guide Kyoto Osaka Kobe Nara 2012, with list of starred restaurants |access-date=2014-09-03 |archive-date=2012-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323191118/http://www.michelin.com.au/content/download/4430/204405/file/MICHELIN%20Guide%20Kyoto,%20Osaka,%20Kobe%20and%20Nara%202012%20Summary.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the [[Hotel de Paris]] in [[Monte Carlo]] or the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]] were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments. 
 
 == Ancient history == 
 [[File:GrandeTaberna.JPG|thumb|right|A Roman thermopolium in [[Pompeii]]]] 
 
 In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] there were small restaurant-bars offering food and drinks. They were called ''[[Thermopolium|thermopolia]]'' (singular ''thermopolium''). Many dwellings did not have [[kitchen]]s, and eating out was an important part of socializing. 
 
 In [[Pompeii]], 158 ''thermopolia'' with service counters have been found. They were along the main road of the town and round the public spaces. < ref > Ellis S.J.R. 2004.
