 A '''propeller''' makes an [[airplane|aircraft]], [[ship]], or [[submarine]] in [[water]] or [[air]] go by making a big wind or a strong stream. It does this by turning two or more [[wing]]s very quick.  The blades of a propeller act as rotating [[wing]]s, and produce force through application of both [[Bernoulli's principle]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]], generating a difference in pressure between the forward and rear surfaces of the [[airfoil]]-shaped blades.
