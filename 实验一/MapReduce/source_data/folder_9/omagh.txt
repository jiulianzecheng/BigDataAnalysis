 ==History== 
 In 1768, Omagh replaced [[Dungannon]] as the county town of County Tyrone. Omagh acquired railway links to [[Londonderry|Derry]] in 1852, [[Enniskillen]] in 1853 and [[Belfast]] in 1861. The St Lucia [[Barracks]] were built in 1881 and closed in 2007. The Ulster Transport Authority closed the Omagh-Enniskillen railway line in 1957 and the [[Portadown]]-Derry main line in 1965, leaving the town with no rail service. In 1998, 29 people [[Omagh bombing|were killed]] in a [[Real Irish Republican Army]] bombing.
