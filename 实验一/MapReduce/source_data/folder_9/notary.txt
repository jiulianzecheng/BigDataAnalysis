 A '''notary''' is a person who has learned some [[law]]s and has been appointed by a [[Executive (government)|government]] to do some certain things using those laws. A notary is most often used to [[witness]] [[signature]]s on legal papers. A notary does this to help stop [[fraud]] and to help a person prove that they are who they say they are. Notaries in some locations can also perform [[marriage]] ceremonies.
