 The '''swallows''' and '''martins''' are a group of [[passerine]] [[bird]]s in the family '''Hirundinidae'''. These birds are adapted to aerial feeding.  " Swallow "  is used colloquially in [[Europe]] as a [[synonym]] for the [[barn swallow]]. 
 
 Within the swallow, the name  " martin "  tends to be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name  " swallow "  for the more fork-tailed species. However, there is no scientific distinction between these two groups. The family contains around 83 [[species]] in 19 [[genera]].
