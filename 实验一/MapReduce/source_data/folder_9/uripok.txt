The audiences listen very attentively to their words. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/feminismintradit0000chak/page/122/mode/2up?q=Laikhurembi+Uripok|title=Feminism in a Traditional Society: Women of the Manipur Valley - Manjusri Chaki-Sircar Â· 1984|pages=122|website=archive.org|year=1984 |isbn=9780706919677 |last1=Chaki-Sircar |first1=Manjusri }} < /ref >
