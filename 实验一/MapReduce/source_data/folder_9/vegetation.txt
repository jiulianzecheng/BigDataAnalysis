'''Vegetation''' means the plant life of a region or the [[plant community]]. It means all ground cover by [[plant]]s, and is the main element of the [[biosphere]]. When you say ''vegetation'' you do not think of any species composition, life [[form]]s, [[structure]], [[Space (physics)|spatial]] extent,  " naturalness " , or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. That is meant by ''[[Flora (plants)|flora]]'' which refers exclusively to species composition. 
 
 ''Vegetation'' can refer to a wide range of spatial scales. Primeval [[redwood forest]]s, coastal [[mangrove stand]]s, [[sphagnum bog]]s, [[desert]] soil crusts, roadside [[weed]] patches, [[wheat]] fields, cultivated [[garden]]s and [[lawn]]s; all are meant by the term ''vegetation''.
