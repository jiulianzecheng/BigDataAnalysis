[[File:Handsprit.jpg|thumb|Common disinfectant for hand-washing]] 
 '''Disinfectant''' is a liquid used to destroy and kill unwanted [[germs]] and [[parasites]]. It is often used in the activity of [[cleaning]], especially in [[bathroom]]s and kitchens, as they are the areas most likely to be contaminated with dangerous [[microorganisms]].  Disinfectants are dangerous liquids and should be used carefully because they can be deadly to humans and animals when in large amounts; it is also different to antiseptics for this reason - disinfectants can only be used on non-living things, while antiseptics are not strong enough to combat the germs disinfectant fights.
