An '''alliance''' is an agreement made between two or more [[party|parties]] to benefit them. 
 
 The word is used mainly in war. Two or more countries that make an alliance promise to help one other during war. Such countries are called ''allies''. Those countries are said to be ''allied''. 
 
 An example of an alliance with more than two countries is the [[Central Powers]] during [[World War I]]. That alliance was made up of [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Bulgaria]].
