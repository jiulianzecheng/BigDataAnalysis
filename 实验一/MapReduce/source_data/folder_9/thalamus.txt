 The thalamus sits above the [[hypothalamus]], and below the cerebral cortex. It is a collection of [[Nucleus (brain)|nuclei]] with various functions. It acts as a relay station, gathering sense information of all kinds (except [[olfactory]]) and passes it on to the cerebral cortex. 
 
 There are action systems for several types of behaviour, including eating, drinking, [[defecation]], and [[copulation]]. < ref name=Jones > Jones E.G. 1985. ''The thalamus''. Plenum Press. {{ISBN|9780306418563}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WMxqAAAAMAAJ] < /ref >  These behaviours satisfy short-term needs, and are called 'consummatory' behaviours. 
 
 == Main functions == 
 The thalamus has many functions. First of all, it acts as a relay station, or [[hub]]. It relays information between subcortical areas and the [[cerebral cortex]]. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Cognitive Neuroscience - The Biology of The Mind|last=Gazzaniga; Ivry; Mangun|first=Michael, S.; Richard B.; George R.|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-91348-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cognitiveneurosc0000gazz/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/cognitiveneurosc0000gazz/page/45}} < /ref >  In particular, every [[sensory system]] except [[olfactory system|smelling]] has a thalamic nucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the related  areas in the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]].  For example, for sight, inputs from the [[retina]] are sent to the thalamus, which in turn sends them to the [[visual cortex]] in the [[occipital lobe]]. 
 
 The thalamus is believed to process sensory information as well as to relay it: each of the main sensory relay areas gets strong feedback from the cerebral cortex. < ref > {{cite web | title = The thalamus, middleman of the brain, becomes a sensory conductor | publisher = The University of Chicago Medicine | url = https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/news/the-thalamus-middleman-of-the-brain-becomes-a-sensory-conductor | access-date = 10 Sep 2020}} < /ref >   
 
 The thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of [[sleep|sleep and wakefulness]]. < ref > {{cite journal |pmid=2839857 |year=1988 |last1=Steriade |first1=Mircea |last2=Llinás |first2=Rodolfo R. |title=The functional states of the thalamus and the associated neuronal interplay |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_physiological-reviews_1988-07_68_3/page/649 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=649–742 |journal=Physiological Reviews |doi=10.1152/physrev.1988.68.3.649 }} < /ref >  Thalamic nuclei have strong connections with the cerebral cortex. These circuits are believed to be involved with [[consciousness]]. < ref > ''Coma and disorders of consciousness'' {{ISBN|978-1-447-12439-9}} p. 143 < /ref >  The thalamus plays a major role in regulating arousal, the level of awareness, and activity. Damage to the thalamus can lead to permanent [[coma]]. < ref > ''The Neurology of Consciousness: cognitive neuroscience and neuropathology'' {{ISBN|978-0-123-74168-4}} p. 10 < /ref > 
 
 The thalamus has a role in the  [[basal ganglia]] system  but this is poorly understood. The thalamus has been thought of as a  " relay "  that just forwards signals to the cerebral cortex. But research suggests that thalamus is more selective. < ref > {{cite web |first=Abigail W. |last=Leonard |date=August 17, 2006 |title=Your brain boots up like a computer |url=http://www.livescience.com/980-brain-boots-computer.html |work=LiveScience}} < /ref >  Many different functions are linked to regions of the thalamus. This is the case for most sensory systems (except the [[olfactory system]]), such as the [[auditory system|auditory]], [[body|somatic sensory system]], [[gut|visceral]], [[eating]] and [[visual system]]s. There specific lesions cause specific sensory deficits. A big role of the thalamus is to support the motor and language systems. Much of the circuitry for these systems is shared with the thalamus. The thalamus is ''functionally connected'' to the [[hippocampus]]. < ref > {{cite journal |pmid=11003270 |year=2000 |last1=Stein |first1=Thor |last2=Moritz |first2=Chad |last3=Quigley |first3=Michelle |last4=Cordes |first4=Dietmar |last5=Haughton |first5=Victor |last6=Meyerand |first6=Elizabeth |title=Functional connectivity in the thalamus and hippocampus studied with functional MR imaging |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=1397–401 |journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology |pmc=7974059 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long & pmid=11003270}} < /ref >  This is part of the hippocampal system which is crucial for human episodic event memory. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002034 |title=Episodic memory, amnesia, and the hippocampal–anterior thalamic axis |year=1999 |last1=Aggleton |first1=John P. |last2=Brown |first2=Malcolm W. |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=22 |issue=3 |pmid=11301518 |pages=425–44; discussion 444–89|s2cid=11258997 |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/34930/1/Aggleton%201999.pdf }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07251.x |title=Hippocampal-anterior thalamic pathways for memory: Uncovering a network of direct and indirect actions |year=2010 |last1=Aggleton |first1=John P. |last2=O'Mara |first2=Shane M. |last3=Vann |first3=Seralynne D. |last4=Wright |first4=Nick F. |last5=Tsanov |first5=Marian |last6=Erichsen |first6=Jonathan T. |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=2292–307 |pmid=20550571 |pmc=2936113}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00830-9 |title=The human hippocampus and spatial and episodic memory |year=2002 |last1=Burgess |first1=Neil |last2=Maguire |first2=Eleanor A |last3=O'Keefe |first3=John |journal=Neuron |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=625–41 |pmid=12194864|s2cid=11989085 }} < /ref >

 Recent research suggests that the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus may  " amplify the connectivity (signaling strength) of just the circuits in the cortex needed for the current context. This helps the flexibility (of the mammalian brain) to make complex decisions by wiring the many associations on which decisions depend into weakly connected cortical circuits " . < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite news|url=http://neurosciencenews.com/pfc-decision-making-6576/|title=New role discovered for brain region|date=2017-05-03|work=Neuroscience News|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Researchers founds that  " enhancing MD activity magnified the ability of mice to  " think " . < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This lowered by more than 25 percent their error rate in deciding which conflicting sensory stimuli to follow to find the reward " . < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Schmitt|first1=L.

 In short, the thalamus helps to make mammals more effective at making decisions and living in their natural environment. 
 
 == The half-second delay == 
 The thalamus is a key area which is involved in what is known as the  " half-second delay " . This is a perceptual illusion which has only recently been discovered. < ref > References can be got from Norretranders T. 1999. ''The user illusion: cutting consciousness down to size''. Penguin, London, chapter 8. < /ref > < ref > Libet, Benjamin 1965. Cortical activation in conscious and unconscious experience. ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine.'' '''9''', 77{{ndash}}86. < /ref >  The discovery is as follows: we perceive events in the world as instantaneous. They happen when we see (hear, sense) them happening. But the processing of visual signals at least is what the thalamus does. Experientially, we see events happening (so we think) without any delay. But in reality ''it takes half a second for the brain to organise the data'' which comes in from, let us say, vision. But we do not sense that half-second delay at all. Our perception of events is that we see them as they happen. < ref > Libet B; Pearl D.K; Morledge D; Gleason D.A; Morledge Y  &  Barbaro N.M. 1991. Control of the transition from sensory detection to sensory awareness in Man by the duration of a thalamic stimulus. ''Brain'' '''14''', 1731{{ndash}}57. < /ref > 
 
 All this applies to consciousness and conscious behaviour. Automatic responses to sudden pain happen instantaneously (bare foot on a pin for example). But they are actually perceived a moment later.
