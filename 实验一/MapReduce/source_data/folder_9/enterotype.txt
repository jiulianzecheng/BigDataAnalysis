An '''enterotype''' is a [[classification]] of [[gut flora]]. It is based on the [[ecosystem]] in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|human intestinal system]]. The classification is done by identifying the [[bacteria]] and [[protists]] which live there. This is called the  " [[human microbiome|human gut biome]] " .  
 
 Research shows there are three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people. < ref name =  " NYT " > {{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=Bacteria divide people into 3 types, scientists say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/science/21gut.html|accessdate=April 21, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 2011|quote=a group of scientists now report just three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people they have studied.}} < /ref > < ref name=Nature > {{cite journal|display-authors = etal |title=Enterotypes of the human gut microbiome|journal=Nature|year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature09944 |quote=Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world.
