 '''Carbapenems''' are a class of [[antibiotics]] which act against a wide range of [[bacteria]]. Their structure is difficult for bacterial [[enzymes]] to break down. < ref > {{cite journal| author = Livermore D.M.  &  Woodford N| year = 2000| title = Carbapenemases: a problem in waiting?| journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology| volume = 3| issue = 5| pages = 489–95| issn = 1369-5274| doi = 10.1016/S1369-5274(00)00128-4| pmid = 11050448}} < /ref >  They were originally developed from a product of ''[[Streptomyces]] cattleya''. < ref > {{cite journal| author = Birnbaum J. |display-authors = etal| year = 1985| title = Carbapenems, a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics.

 Carbapenems are one of the  " antibiotics of last resort "  for many bacterial infections, such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') and ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]''. < ref > {{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/10/07/mass_specialists_to_study_drug_resistant_germs_spread/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Deadly bacteria's foothold spurs study: Mass. specialists try to halt spread | first=Stephen | last=Smith | date=2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Recently, alarm has been raised about an  " Indian superbug " . < ref > {{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7939687/Can-we-stop-the-Indian-superbug.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Can we stop the Indian superbug? | first=Hugh | last=Pennington | date=2010 | access-date=2018-04-01 | archive-date=2014-08-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822165644/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/7939687/Can-we-stop-the-Indian-superbug.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This is a strain resistant to Carapenems, which was discovered in [[Delhi]]. This strain produces an enzyme which chops up the antibiotic molecule. 
 
 At present there are no new antibiotics in development to replace carbapenems. However, some older antibiotics may treat bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Giske CG | title = Contemporary resistance trends and mechanisms for the old antibiotics colistin, temocillin, fosfomycin, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin | journal = Clin.
