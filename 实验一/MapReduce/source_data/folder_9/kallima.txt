 '''''Kallima''''', also known as the Oakleaf or Dead leaf butterfly, is a [[genus]] of [[butterflies]] of the family [[Nymphalidae]]. They are found in [[Asia]]. < ref > ''Kalima'' species [http://www.funet.fi/pub/sci/bio/life/insecta/lepidoptera/ditrysia/papilionoidea/nymphalidae/nymphalinae/kallima/index.html ''Kalima'']. funet.fi < /ref >   
 
 Their common name is a reference to the under surface of their wings, which is various shades of brown. When the wings are held closed, this results in a remarkable similarity to a dead [[leaf]]. There are dark dots or  patches which look like the effects of [[fungi]] and [[lichen]], which are so common on dead leaves.  
 
 The [[camouflage]] is perfected by the rear wings, which have a little 'tail', which looks like the stalk of a leaf. When at rest in closed position, the 'tail' touches the branch, completing the [[illusion]]. < ref > [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace A.R.]] 1867. The disguises of insects. Reprinted in Wallace A.R. ''Studies scientific and social''. vol 1, Macmillan, London. p191 < /ref > 
 
 There are two [[Polymorphism|morphs]] of the common Indian species ''Kallima inachus''. Nothing seems to be known about why these morphs exist. There is also variation in the colour of the under surfaces.
