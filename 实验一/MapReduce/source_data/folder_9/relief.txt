 '''Relief''' is a type of [[sculpture]] or [[carving]]. The worker creating the piece starts with a flat base, usually stone or wood, and takes small parts of the surface away until the desired image has been made. 
 
 Reliefs are found around the world. They can be used to decorate buildings, such as [[temple]]s. Usually the artist makes reliefs of figures, such as people or animals.

 In [[bas-relief]], only a bit of the base is taken away.  The figure is quite flat and this is especially common in [[frieze]]s. An alto-relief is where the artist takes away a lot of the base material. This can be very detailed.
