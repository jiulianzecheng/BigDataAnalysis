 The '''Embioptera''' are an order of [[insect]]s, commonly known as '''webspinners'''.  
 
 Webspinners are a small group of mostly tropical and subtropical insects. They are in the subclass [[Pterygota]]. The group first appeared during the [[Jurassic]] and is well represented in [[Cretaceous]] amber. The common name webspinner comes from the insects' ability to spin silk from structures on their front legs. They use the silk to make a web-like pouch or gallery in which they live. They feed on leaf litter, moss, bark and lichen.  
 
 Occasionally they arrive in [[temperate]] countries, usually as passengers on [[cargo]]. < ref > Briggs, Helen 2019. Webspinners: new order of insects sets up home in UK. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-47335931] < /ref >
