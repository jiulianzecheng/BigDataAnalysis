 There are more than 100 kinds of arthritis. The three most common kinds are [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[gout]].  Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by [[bacteria]]). 
 
 Osteoarthritis is when the [[cartilage]] in between two bones breaks down. This condition causes the bones to rub together. This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people. The most common places for this arthritis are the hips, knees, lower back, and neck. There are medicines that can relieve the pain and prevent disability. < ref name= " Gout 2007 " > " Gout.

 Gout causes severe pain and swelling. Gout normally affects the big toe. It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows. Gout is from high levels of [[uric acid]] that is in the blood. Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints. Gout creates stone-like shapes. The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons. < ref name= " Gout 2007 " / >
