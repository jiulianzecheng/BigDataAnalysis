 '''Sardine''' is a name of several kinds of [[fish]], especially [[oily fish]]. Another name for these fish is '''Pilchard'''. All of those fish are quite small and are related to the [[herring]]. The Latin name of the family of these fish is [[Clupeidae]]. However, the naming is not precise. [[Fishbase]], a database about all kinds of fish, has six [[species]] just named ''pilchard''. There are over a [[dozen]] with the name of ''sardine''.  Many more exist, with the basic names qualified by adjectives. 
 
 The fish are named after the [[Island]] of [[Sardinia]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Sardine • Young's Seafood|url=https://youngsseafood.co.uk/species/sardine/|access-date=2021-05-14|website=Young’s Seafood|language=en|archive-date=2021-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514123858/https://youngsseafood.co.uk/species/sardine/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In the past, they could easily be fished there. 
 
 Many [[shop]]s and [[supermarket]]s sell canned (or tinned) ''sardines''. The can is filled in liquids like water or oil. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Canned Sardines: Are They Good for You?|url=https://www.webmd.com/diet/canned-sardines-good-for-you|access-date=2021-05-17|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref >  Very often, those fish are not sardines, but rather [[European sprat|sprat]]s or [[round herring]]s.
