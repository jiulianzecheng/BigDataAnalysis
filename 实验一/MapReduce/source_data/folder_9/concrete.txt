 '''Concrete''' is an important [[material]] for making different [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. It is a [[Composite material|composite]] made of Portland [[cement]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] or aggregate, and [[water]]. The amount of each can change depending upon what the concrete will be used for.  
 
 Concrete is used more than any other man-made material in the world. < ref > {{cite book|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: measuring the real state of the world|url=https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0|authorlink=|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|year=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80447-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0/page/138 138]}} < /ref >  As of 2006, about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year—more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth. < ref > {{cite web | title = Minerals commodity summary – cement – 2007 | publisher= United States Geographic Service|date=1 June 2007|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2008}} < !--Computed by taking 2007 figure for world concrete production and the mix at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Regular_concrete and computing the volume-- > < /ref > 
 
 The ingredients are mixed together into a paste, a bit like making [[dough]] for bread. The concrete is then [[wikt:pour|poured]] into a frame. After a few hours it sets hard. Concrete solidifies due to a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, eventually creating a strong stone-like material.  
 
 Concrete is used to make [[Sidewalk|pavements]], pipe, [[Architecture|architectural]] [[structure]]s, [[dam]]s, [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]s, [[motorway]]s, [[bridge]]s, multi-story [[parking]], [[wall]]s, [[footing]]s for [[gate]]s, [[fence]]s and [[Utility pole|poles]] and even [[boat]]s. 
 Its biggest advantage is that it bonds together bricks and stones better than any other method known to mankind.  
 
 Concrete is [[wikt:strong|strong]] in [[Physical compression|compression]] but [[wikt:weak|weak]] in [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]]. For some purposes it needs to be reinforced with steel rods. [[Reinforced concrete]] buildings can be made to link all the parts together, the foundations, walls, floors and roofs, but concrete construction does not make buildings [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake-proof]]. 
 
 == Significance == 
 Concrete is as old as 5600 BC. It was not invented by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], but much used by them. Some kinds of concrete are [[wikt:waterproof|waterproof]], and some kinds even set underwater. 
 
 Its importance was great for civilizations which were not in near-desert conditions. They needed something to stand up to the rain. Fired [[Brick|bricks]] and concrete were two things they invented. These inventions let you build almost anywhere on land. Otherwise you rely on nearby sources of rock, as the Egyptians did, or on wood. 
 
 == Additives == 
 There are many additives to make concrete set faster, set slower, set stronger, reduce [[corrosion]] and so on. The Romans discovered that adding [[Tuff#Volcanic ash|volcanic ash]] produced a concrete which would set under water. The Romans also knew that adding horse hair made concrete less liable to crack as it set, and that adding blood made it more [[frost]]-resistant. < ref > [http://www.djc.com/special/concrete/10003364.htm Brief history of concrete] < /ref > 
 
 === Modern concrete === 
 Modern concrete was made in 1756 by British engineer John Smeaton. He added [[pebble]]s and powdered [[brick]] to the cement. In 1824, English inventor Joseph Aspdin invented [[Portland cement]], which has remained the main cement used in concrete production. He burnt ground-up [[limestone]] and [[clay]] together. The burning process changed the chemical properties of the materials. Aspdin created a stronger cement than crushed limestone alone could produce. < ref name=Bellis/ > 
 
 The 19th century saw the invention of [[reinforced concrete]] by [[France|French]] gardener [[Joseph Monier]] in 1849 ([[Patent|patented]] in 1867). < ref name=Bellis > {{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blconcrete.htm |title=The history of concrete and cement |publisher=About.com |first=Mary |last=Bellis |accessdate=2011-01-25 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  François Coignet studied and improved it. This is concrete with steel bars in it, called rebars (reinforcing bars). [[Fiberglass|Glass fibre]] or plastic fibre is beginning to replace steel bars. 
 
 Many modern chemicals can be added to the mixture to achieve special objectives. 'Superplasticizers' are chemicals which improve workability, which means the ability to shape the concrete before it has set. [[Pigment]]s can change the dull grey colour. Corrosion inhibitors can reduce [[rust]]ing on the steel bars. 'Air entrainment' is blowing little bubbles in the concrete before it sets. This helps the concrete survive the freezing and thawing of a cold [[climate]]. [[Blast furnace]] [[slag]] can be mixed with concrete. It turns the colour into almost pure white and makes the concrete stronger. 
 
 == Cladding == 
 Concrete is not an attractive material. It is functional, does the job of standing up to rain, frost, and great loads when reinforced. But it is grey and ugly. This is the reason many concrete structures make use of [[cladding]]. Cladding is used for many concrete walls, internally and externally. At present great efforts are made to make sure the cladding is fire-resistant. 
 
 Cladding has a long history. It was certainly used by the Romans. Parts of the [[Colosseum|Roman Colosseum]] originally had marble veneer. The holes for attaching the veneer are still visible. < ref name= " scheffler " > {{Cite journal |last=Scheffler |first=Michael J. |year=2001 |title=Thin-Stone Veneer Building Facades: Evolution and Preservation |journal=APT Bulletin |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=27–34 |doi=10.2307/1504690 |jstor=1504690}} < /ref >
