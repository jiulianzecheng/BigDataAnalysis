 '''Onychonycteris''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[bat]], which lived during the  [[Eocene]] period, 52.5 million years ago, in the area that is now [[Wyoming]]. One species has been described, ''Onychonycteris finneyi.''  Using this species, it could be shown that these primitive bats first developed the ability to fly, before they had echolocation. < ref > Nancy B. Simmons, Kevin L.
