 A '''tire''' is a ring of material that covers the rim of a [[wheel]]. Most road [[vehicle]]s and many other vehicles use [[rubber]] tires. Tires help vehicles to move smoothly. Some [[rapid transit|metro]] [[train]]s and [[tram]]s also use rubber tires on their [[steel]] wheels to provide better [[traction]] than the [[steel]] tires of other [[train]]s. 
 
 Tires need to be changed after their [[tread]]s wear away. Driving with worn tires is very dangerous. It can cause the tire to explode and the driver to lose control. 
 
 Tires were made of leather for thousands of years, and of iron or steel for hundreds. Pneumatic tires were invented in the 1840s and again in the 1880s. They became commonplace early in the 20th century. 
 
 ==Construction== 
 Tires are made of different types of rubber. Softer rubber is used in summer or when the tires need better [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], for example, in [[auto racing]]. Tires made of harder rubber are made for long lasting performance, like long-distance truck carriers. There are many different types of tires. They come in different [[size]]s and have different tread [[pattern]]s.   
 
 There are many different sizes of tires. On car and truck tires, they are marked with 3 numbers and might look like: 225/60R16.  The first number is the width in [[millimetre|millimeters]] of the tire at the widest point when it is mounted and inflated. The second number is the sidewall (side of the tire) height as a [[ratio]] or [[percent]]age of the width. The last number is the wheel [[diameter]] in [[inch]]es. 
 
 ;Example: 
 Tire size: 225/60R16 
 :Tire width = 225mm 
 :Sidewall height = 135mm (225 * .60 = 135) 
 :Wheel diameter = 16 inches 
 
 Very large tires (for example, tires on big [[mining]] trucks) use different [[Units of measurement|units]]. For example: 59/80R63. The first number is the width in inches of the tire. The second number is the sidewall height as a ratio of the width. The last number is the wheel diameter in inches. 
 
 ==Tire damage== 
 Most tires today do not have a tube inside of them. There are grooves in the wheel that let the tire be popped into place and hold a lot of air pressure. If there is a crack in the tire, it will not be able to hold its air. Tire leaks are very common. The most common cause is a hole from a nail or screw. This can usually be fixed by [[patch]]ing the inside of the tire so that it can hold air again. If the hole is close to or in the side of the tire, it can not be fixed. This is because the sides of the tire flexes to support the weight of the vehicle. A patch will not be able to handle the stress. 
 
 == Mud and snow tires == 
 Mud and Snow, (or M+S, or M & S), is a designation used by [[manufacturer]]s for all-season and winter tires. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.tirebuyer.com/education/all-season-tires-vs-winter-tires |title=Everything you need to know about winter tires |author= |website= |publisher=TireBuyer.com |accessdate=17 May 2016 |archive-date=21 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521092028/http://www.tirebuyer.com/education/all-season-tires-vs-winter-tires |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Most are designed to provide improved performance under low temperature conditions, compared to summer tires. The tread compound is usually softer than that used in tires for summer conditions. This provides better grip on [[ice]] and [[snow]], but wears more quickly at higher temperatures. Tires may have well above average numbers of [[Siping (rubber)|sipes]] in the tread pattern to grip the ice. M & S relates to the percentage of tread void area. On [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles, M & S tires are often standard equipment. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/what-wheel-drive.html |title=All About Front-, Rear-, Four-Wheel and All-Wheel Drive |author= |website= |publisher=Edmunds |accessdate=17 May 2016}} < /ref >
