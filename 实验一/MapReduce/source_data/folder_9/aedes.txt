 '''''Aedes''''' is a genus of [[mosquito]] originally found in tropical and subtropical zones, but has spread by [[human]] activity to all continents excluding [[Antarctica]]. Several of the species transmit important human diseases and one species, ''Aedes albopictus'', is the most invasive mosquito in the world. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''aēdēs'', meaning  " unpleasant "  or  " odious " , so called because of the diseases this type of mosquito transmits, including [[dengue fever]] and [[yellow fever]].
