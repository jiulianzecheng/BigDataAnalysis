[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2df4m61b#page-4   " From Shrinking Cities to ''Toshi no Shukushō'': Identifying Patterns of Urban Shrinkage in the Osaka Metropolitan Area, " ] ''Berkeley Planning Journal'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (2001), p. 135 [PDF 4 of 24]. Retrieved 2012-12-2. < /ref > 
 
 Osaka is surrounded by [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]], [[Nara Prefecture]], [[Wakayama Prefecture]].  
 
 ==History of Ōsaka== 
 Sometimes it is called by its historical name ''Naniwa''. 
 
 Because it is by the sea, it is good for transportation.  That is why an ancient emperor made Osaka [[Naniwa-kyō|the capital city]].  In the early part of the [[8th century]] Naniwa was one of capitals of Japan.  In the middle of the [[16th century]] [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] founded Osaka castle and governed Japan in Osaka.  The basis of development of Osaka was prepared in those times.  Osaka castle was destroyed once by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] but Ieyasu choose Osaka as one of the political centers in the Western Japan.  He made Osaka a direct dominion of the [[shogun]].  During the Edo period Osaka was a center of [[commerce]], [[finance]], [[pharmacy]] and other products.  It was a center for literature and theater.  [[Kabuki]] in Osaka is as famous as Kabuki in [[Tokyo|Edo]] and [[Kyoto]].   It is also known for [[bunraku]] (a traditional puppet theater) and [[manzai]] (a kind of stand-up comedy).

 Traditional Osaka food dishes include ''[[okonomiyaki]]'' (pan-fried [[batter (cooking)|batter]] [[cake]]) and ''[[takoyaki]]'' ([[octopus]] [[dumplings]]).   
 
 In this region, many people speak a [[dialect]] called Osaka-Ben (e.g.  " ookini " = " thank you " ). 
 
 After the [[Meiji restoration]] Osaka was modernized and industrialized.  It was a center of Japanese industry.  After the [[World War II]] its economical importance was relatively less because Tokyo grew as an international city and many companies moved their headquarters to Tokyo.  But Osaka is still a large, important city.
