 '''Usury''' is lending money for [[interest]]. Nowadays it usually means lending at a high, often [[extortion]]ate rate of interest on a [[loan]]. 
 
 Usury is [[illegal]] in many parts of the world.  In [[muslim]] countries charging any interest at all is strictly illegal. 
 
 Some people argue that this is against the [[Old Testament]], especially [[Exodus]] < ref > [[Exodus]] Chapter 22,25 < /ref >  and [[Deuteronomy]] < ref > [[Deuteronomy]] Chapter 23,19 < /ref >  which states that those who lend to someone in need will be blessed, but the point about usury is the high levels of interest, not the act of lending in itself. 
 
 [[Aristotle]] also condemned usury as  " contrary to nature "  in his book on [[Politics]], because it increases by itself and makes money without labour. < ref > Aristotle,  " Politics " : Book I, (1258-b) < /ref >
