 '''Marlins''', family '''Istiophoridae''', are fish with an elongated body, a [[spear]]-like [[snout]] or bill, and a long rigid dorsal fin, which extends forward to form a crest. Its common name is thought to derive from its resemblance to a sailor's marlinspike. Even more so than their close relatives the scombrids, marlin are incredibly fast swimmers, marlins are fast swimmers, reaching speeds of about {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. < ref name=EoF >
