 '''Fantasy''' is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] (make believe) that shows some form of [[Witchcraft|magic]] or supernatural elements. 
 
 Often fantasy also means that the story happens in a fictional place, a world different from our own (e.g. [[Middle-earth]] or [[Narnia]]). Although the word fantasy is most often applied to low-tech worlds, it also can depict high tech worlds, overlapping with [[science fiction]] ([[science fantasy]]). Or it is used for [[history|historical]] fiction, if it is magical in some way.
