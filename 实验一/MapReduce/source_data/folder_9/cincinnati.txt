 '''Cincinnati''' is a [[city]] in the [[southwest]]ern corner of the [[state]] of [[Ohio]] near the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Indiana]]. The city is in Hamilton County, Ohio. Cincinnati is home to major sports teams including the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], as well as events like the [[Cincinnati Masters]] and the Thanksgiving Day race.

 Cincinnati was named after the Roman leader [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]] and was an early major city in the midwestern United States. Many [[German American|Germans]] settled in the city and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood gets its name from the river in Germany. Soap and machine tools are major industries in the area, which is home to the company [[Procter  &  Gamble]] as well as [[Macy's]]. Cincinnati's economy and population declined in the late 1900s, but the city is on the upswing. The Over-The-Rhine neighborhood has seen a lot of new businesses and development in recent years. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/what-works-cincinnati-ohio-over-the-rhine-crime-neighborhood-turnaround-city-urban-revitalization-213969|title=How Cincinnati Salvaged the Nation's Most Dangerous Neighborhood|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en}} < /ref >
