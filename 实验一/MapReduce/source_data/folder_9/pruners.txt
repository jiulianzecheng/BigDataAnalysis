 '''Pruners''' are a cutting [[tool]] for '''pruning''' plants. A common form is held in one hand; it is also called ''snippers'' or ''secateurs''.  It has two handles, one connected to a blade and the other to a blunt surface.  Like the word ''scissors'', ''pruners'' is used as a plural. 
 
 A '''pole pruner''' is like a pair of pruners, but at the end of a pole. It is operated by pulling on a [[rope]]. 
 
 Pruners are used for cutting plants and small branches, such as [[rose]]s and [[grape]]vines. Stems thicker than a pencil will need to be cut with [[loppers]] or a [[saw]] instead.
