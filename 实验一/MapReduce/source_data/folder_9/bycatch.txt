[[File:Shrimp bycatch.jpg|thumb|Bycatch when fishing for [[shrimp]], in [[Florida]].]] 
 When doing industrial [[fishing]], people want to catch certain [[species]] of fish. When they are using [[Fishing net|nets]], they will also catch other species. These are called '''bycatch''' or '''by-catch'''. Most of the time, the [[Animal|animals]] caught will be severely injured or killed.  Most of these species are thrown back into ithe sea, but some of the bycatch is used. The exact amount of bycatch is not known. There are estimates that up to a quarter of the total may be bycatch. When catching [[shrimp]], up to eighty percent may be bycatch.  Another problem is that the amount of bycatch is not recorded, and does not show up in statistics.
