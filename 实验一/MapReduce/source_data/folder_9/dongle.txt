 The term has since been added to other types of devices with a similar form factor, such as: 
 
 * adapters that convert ports to handle different types of connectors (such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] to VGA for displays, [[USB]] to [[Serial port|serial connection]], and in modern computing, [[USB-C]] to other types of ports, and Mobile High-Definition Link), < ref > {{Cite news|last=Lee|first=Dave|date=2016-11-07|title=Discussing the dongles|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37903587|access-date=2019-04-21}} < /ref > 
 * USB wireless adapters for standards such as [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]] 
 * [[USB flash drive|USB flash drives]] (more commonly described as  " USB stick "  or  " USB key " ) 
 * small form-factor digital media players that plug into [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] ports (most commonly described as a  " media player dongle "  or  " media player stick " ) 
 
 == Examples == 
 Security dongles are typically used to help prevent [[Copyright infringement|unauthorized use]] and copying of certain forms of software. Initially using ports such as the [[serial port]] or [[parallel port]], most are now in [[USB]] format. 
 
 Very short cables that connect relatively large jacks to smaller plugs/. It allow cables to be easily installed and removed from equipment with limited space available for connectors.  The Chromecast devit negates the need for a short adapter cable.
