'''Jodhpur''' state was a former [[princely state]] now in [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]].  < ref > http://hcraj.nic.in/history.htm < /ref >  The region was earlier called '''Marwar''' meaning 'the land of death' due to its severe famines and harsh conditions of living. Maharaja Umaid Singhji got Umaid Bhawan Palace built in Jodhpur at the time of famine so as to provide employment to public.  
 
 Its ruler, the [[Maharaja]] of Jodhpur, expressed a wish to join [[Pakistan]] but [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] warned him that his subjects were mostly [[Hindu]]s and his accession to Pakistan would create problems. As a result Jodhpur, too, acceded to India. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.maharajajodhpur.com/hh/hist_hanwant.htm |title=HH the Maharaja |access-date=2013-02-02 |archive-date=2013-08-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825024650/http://www.maharajajodhpur.com/hh/hist_hanwant.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
