 A '''mermaid''' is a [[mythology|mythological]] creature with a female human head and upper body and the tail of a [[fish]]. Mermaids are said to live mostly in the [[water]], although sometimes they are known to come out of the water and sit on the large [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] above the [[sea]]. It was thought that they would make boats crash with their [[siren]]-like calls. 
 
 ==Overview and etymology== 
 The word is a compound of mere, the Old English word for  " sea " , and maid, a woman. The male equivalent is a merman. 
 Much like sirens, mermaids sometimes sing to people and gods and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or run their ships aground. Other stories depict them squeezing the life out of drowning men while attempting to rescue them. They are also said to carry humans down to their underwater kingdoms or drown them. < ref name= " Wired " > {{cite news|publisher=Wired|access-date=July 18, 2020|title=Fantastically Wrong: The Murderous, Sometimes Sexy History of the Mermaid|author=Matt Simon|date=October 15, 2020|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/fantastically-wrong-strange-murderous-sometimes-sexy-history-mermaid/}} < /ref > 
 
 The sirens of [[Greek mythology]] are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as mermaid-like.  But in the [[Odyssey]] they are described as birds with women's heads, not women with fish tails.  Some languages use the same word for both bird and fish creatures, such as the Maltese word 'sirena'. Other related types of mythical or legendary creatures are water [[fairies]] (e.g., various water [[nymphs]]) and [[selkies]], animals that can transform themselves from [[Pinniped|seals]] to humans. 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Ancient Near East=== 
 The first known mermaid [[folklore|stories]] appeared in [[Assyria]], ca. 1000 BC. The goddess Atargatis loved a [[shepherd]] and [[wikt:accident|accidentally]] killed him. She was so sad she jumped into a lake to become a fish, but the waters would not let her [[beauty]] be hidden. Because of this, she took the form of a mermaid. 
 
 A popular Greek legend turns [[Alexander the Great]]'s sister into a mermaid after she died. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf |title=Teacher's Guide |access-date=2011-01-09 |archive-date=2008-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409111935/http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/mpt/alexander/guide/teachers_guide.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  She lived, it was said, in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] that when she met a ship, she asked its sailors only one question: '' " Is King Alexander alive? " '' ({{lang-el| " Ζει ο Βασιλιάς Αλέξανδρος}}; " ) The answer was '' " He lives and reigns and conquers the world " '' (Greek:  " Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμο κυριεύει " ). If they answered her question correctly, she calmed the waters for the ship, but any other answer would make her angry, and raise a storm. < ref > Mermaids and Ikons: A Greek Summer (1978)  page 73 by [[Gwendolyn MacEwen]] {{ISBN|978-0-88784-062-3}} < /ref > < ref > Folktales from Greece Page 96 {{ISBN|1-56308-908-4}} < /ref >

 Mermaids could also swim up rivers to [[freshwater]] lakes.

It is again in the collection of the [[Royal Academy]]. < ref > [[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] ''et al.'' (2008). ''J. W. Waterhouse: The Modern Pre-Raphaelite'', p. 144.

 == Hoaxes == 
 In the 19th century, [[P. T. Barnum]] showed in his museum a [[taxidermy|taxidermal]] [[hoax]] called the ''Fiji mermaid.'' Others have made similar hoaxes, which are usually made by [[paper-mâché]] or parts of dead creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together too look like a mermaid. In the wake of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake#The Asian Tsunami|2004 tsunami]], pictures of Fiji  " mermaids "  came up on the Internet as examples of items that had washed up onto the beach, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit. < ref > [http://www.snopes.com/photos/tsunami/mermaid.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Mermaid to Order < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >
