 A '''googolplex''' is the number 10 < sup > [[googol]] < /sup > , equivalent to 10 < sup > 10 < sup > 100 < /sup > < /sup >   or 10 < small > < sup > [[googol|Ten duotrigintillion]] < /sup > < /small >  or  < small > 10 < sup > 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 < /sup > . < /small > 
 
 Like the number ''googol'', ''googolplex'' was thought of by [[Milton Sirotta]], the nephew of mathematician [[Edward Kasner]]. 
 
 The company [[Google]] named their [[wikt:headquarters|headquarters]], the [[Googleplex]], after the number. 
 
 A '''googolplexplex''' or '''googolplexian''' is a 1 followed by a Googolplex amount of zeros which is 10 < sup > Googolplex < /sup >  (10 < sup > < sup > 10 < sup > 10 < sup > 100 < /sup > < /sup > < /sup > < /sup >  ).
