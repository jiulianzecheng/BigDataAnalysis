 '''Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo''' ({{lang-ar|محمد حمدان دقلو|translit=Muẖammad H̱amdān Daqlū}}; born 1 January 1975) also known by his nickname '''Hemedti''' ({{lang-ar|حميدتي|translit=H̱amīdtī|link=no}}) is a [[Sudan]]ese [[politician]] and [[soldier]]. He came from the [[Rizeigat tribe]] in [[Darfur]]. Dagalo was the [[Vice President of Sudan|First Vice President of Sudan]] from 2021 to 2023. He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Rapid Support Forces (Sudan)|Rapid Support Forces]] since its creation in 2013 and as well as the leader of the [[Janjaweed]] since 2013. 
 
 Dagalo took part in the [[2021 Sudan coup d'état|2021 Sudanese coup d'état]] alongside [[List of heads of state of Sudan|president]] [[Abdel Fattah al-Burhan]]. However, in February 2023, Dagalo has regretted taking part in the coup calling it a mistake. In April 2023, he denounced Burhan and started the [[War in Sudan (2023)|Third Sudanese Civil War]] in which Dagalo has citized Burhan for trying to divide the country though Burhan has denied those clamies.
