The area has a population of approximately 18,000.  The area suffers from deprivation and a high crime rate.  In the 1960s, the Seacroft Civic Centre was built, but it was demolished in 1999 and replaced with the Seacroft Green Shopping Centre which contains a large [[Tesco]].  The Shopping Centre has a bus station with routes to [[Leeds]], [[Wetherby]], [[Harrogate]] and other Leeds suburbs.
