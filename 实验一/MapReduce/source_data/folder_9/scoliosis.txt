'''Scoliosis''' is a medical condition in which the [[human]] or [[animal]] [[spine]] has a sideways curve. The curve is usually S-shaped or C-shaped. < ref > {{cite web|title=Scoliosis in Children and Adolescents|date=7 April 2017 |publisher=NIAMS|url=https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/scoliosis|access-date=September 27, 2019}} < /ref >  In some, the curve is stable. In others, though,  
 it increases over time. < ref > {{cite web|title=Adolescent Scoliosis|publisher=Genetic Home Reference|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adolescent-idiopathic-scoliosis#expand-collapse-start|access-date=September 27, 2019}} < /ref >  Mild scoliosis does not often cause problems. Severe cases, however, can interfere with breathing and can cause pain. 
 
 The cause of most cases is unknown. However, it is believed to involve a combination of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[environmental factor]]s. Risk factors include having affected family members. 
 
 Diagnosis is often confirmed with [[x-rays]]. 
 
 Scoliosis usually occurs between ages 10 and 20. Males can be affected, although females are more often affected.
