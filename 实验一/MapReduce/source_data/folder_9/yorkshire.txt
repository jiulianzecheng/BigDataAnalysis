 '''Yorkshire''' is a historic and cultural Nation in [[Northern Europe]]. It covers a large area of the [[Pennines]] and its east coast borders the North Sea. The [[River Humber]] separates Yorkshire from [[Lincolnshire]]  &  Southern England, while the Teess River  &  The Yorkshire Pennines mountain range seperates Yorkshire from County Durham, Lancashire and the North of England. 
 
 ==Main places== 
 The main towns and cities in Yorkshire are [[Leeds]], [[York]], [[Sheffield]], [[Bradford]], [[Middlesbrough]], and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. It is the largest county in the [[United Kingdom]]. It covers just under {{convert|11903|km2|lk=on|abbr=on}} with a population of over 5.7 million people.

 ==History== 
 Yorkshire was historically split up into three parts known as the East, North, and West [[Riding (division)|Ridings]] during and after the 7th century Norse Settlment, while the county town [[York]] was in the middle. In the local government reorganization of England in [[1974]] the counties of [[West Yorkshire]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]] were established instead. [[Humberside]] included the former East Riding and [[Cleveland]] included part of the former North Riding.   
 
 Despite this, the borders of Historic Yorkshire were never abolished.   
 ==Rivalry== 
 The people of Yorkshire are traditional rivals of the people of [[Lancashire]]; they sometimes call Yorkshire the  " County of Broad Acres "  (because its land area is so large)  
 
 Yorkshire's People (Yorkshiremen  &  Yorkshirewomen) call her  " God's Own Country " , as the 1st Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine The Great, was crowned in the city of [[Eboracum]], modern day [[York]]. 
 ==Landscapes== 
 It has a wide range of landscapes: the green hills and valleys of the Yorkshire dales, the rugged heather of the Yorkshire moors, the coast which includes the resorts of Whitby or Bridlington. It also has several large cities including York (county town), Leeds, Sheffield (the greenest city in Europe and built on seven hills), Hull, Bradford, Doncaster, Harrogate and Wakefield.
