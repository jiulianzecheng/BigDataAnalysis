 '''Desiro''' is the brand name for a design of [[modular]] [[Trains|train]] manufactured by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] of Germany. 
 
 The Desiro can be made as a [[diesel]] or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for [[region]]al services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many [[Europe]]an [[Country|countries]]. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast [[acceleration]] makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort. 
 
 == Austria == 
 In [[Austria]], the ÖBB ([[Austrian]] Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called ''ÖBB 5022''. These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.oebb.at/pv/en/Barrier-free_travelling/Rolling_stock/Talent_and_Desiro.jsp |title=oebb |accessdate=2 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 == Bulgaria == 
 
 In 2005 and 2006, in [[Bulgaria]], the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a [[Euro|€]]67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 [[Diesel multiple unit]]s. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the [[Sofia]]-Kyustendil-[[Sofia]] line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_8_45/ai_n14935082/ |title=findarticles |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2 April 2010}} < /ref >  The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing [[traffic]] in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas. 
 
 == Denmark == 
 In [[Denmark]], DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between [[Odense]] and Svendborg and between [[Odense]] and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of [[eight]] trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/news59287.html |title=railway-technology |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |archive-date=24 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324045059/http://www.railway-technology.com/news/news59287.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains. 
 
 == Germany == 
 [[File:TriebwagenderErzgebirgsbahninAnnaberg-BuchholzUntererBahnhof.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Two Class 642s in Germany]] [[Germany]]'s [[Deutsche Bahn]] first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local [[service]]s in 2000. With a top [[speed]] of 120 & nbsp;km/h, these ''Class 642'' units are mostly used on branch lines and [[region]]al lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many [[wikt:private|private]] German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs. 
 
 The ''Class 642'' has two MAN [[diesel engine]]s with an output of 275 or 315 & nbsp;kW each and hydro-mechanical [[wikt:transmission|transmission]] with [[retarder (railroad)|retarders]]. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s, up to [[three]] trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the ''Müglitzbahn'', have made greater passenger [[number]]s. 
 
 At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the ''Class 642'' can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the ''Class 643''. 
 
 == Hungary == 
 Right now in [[Hungary]], 31 [[diesel]] Desiros are in [[service]] with MÁV (counting 8 units from [[Greece]]), mostly as [[suburb]]an trains on the secondary line between Budapest-[[Esztergom]] and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and [[Sátoraljaújhely]] and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the [[summer]] months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the [[Lake Balaton]].

 * Eight trains are used for the non-stop Express Rail Link service between [[Kuala Lumpur]]'s central station and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. 
 * Four trains serve five [[Train station|stations]] on the [[KLIA Transit|Commuter Rail Service]]. 
 
 These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 & nbsp;km/[[hour|h]]. 
 
 == Romania == 
 Căile Ferate Române (CFR), [[Romania]]'s [[nation]]al railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train:  " ''Regio'' " ,  " ''InterRegio'' "  and  " ''InterCity'' "  inter-city services, but mostly on its  " ''InterRegio'' "  express trains. There was some [[wikt:criticism|criticism]] of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes. 
 
 == Russia == 
 In December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], with an [[wikt:option|option]] for a further 16 which would be mostly made in [[Russia]]. < ref > [http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/siemens-signs-russian-olympic-train-order.html Siemens signs Russian Olympic train order] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130065322/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/siemens-signs-russian-olympic-train-order.html |date=2010-01-30 }}.
