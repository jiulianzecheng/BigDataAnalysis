 Globalization is the spread of products, technology, information, and jobs across nations. 
 
 == Definition == 
 
 It is a term which may be used broadly to mean doing things as distant people do them, or more narrowly to mean complying to global [[standard]] < nowiki/ > s in economy, politics, culture, education, environment or other matters. It describes the way countries and people of the world interact and integrate. Many things have become globalized as people come into contact. 
 
 Economic globalization is how countries are coming together as one big global economy, < ref > {{cite web

In the late 20th century, many people agreed to lower [[tariff]]s, or taxes on [[good (economics)|goods]] that are [[import]]ed from other countries. [[Telegraphy]] and bull other [[communication]] technologies have helped people to buy and sell products from around the world, thus bringing globalization. Herman E. Daly has said that there is an important difference between internationalization and globalization. [[Internationalization]] is about nations working together for the same goals. These are things like treaties, alliances, and other international agreements.  Globalization is about [[international trade]] that are  
 being less blocked by national [[border]]s. 
 
 Political globalization is how institutions and countries can influence the whole world. The [[United Nations]] are an example of globalization because most countries of the world are members of its [[United United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]. This international organization can make countries follow rules and apply economic sanctions to a country that doesn't. This means the countries in the U.N will punish them by not talking or trading with them, so they don't benefit from globalization. 
 
 Cultural globalization is how culture is becoming [[homogeneous]], which means that people from all over the world act in similar way. For example, many people around the world write with the [[Latin alphabet]], wear [[T-shirts]] and [[jeans]] and watch [[Hollywood]] movies and other media. 
 
 == Criticism == 
 Some people, like [[Noam Chomsky]], do not like globalization because they feel it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people [[poverty|poorer]]. [[Offshore]] [[outsourcing]], such as a company hiring workers in a [[developing country]], is often a part of globalization. This sometimes means that some people in a [[developed country]] lose their jobs. [[Joseph Stiglitz]] said that international groups like the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) have made it harder for [[developing country|poorer nations]] to get richer.  Globalization also means that problems from other countries will affect your country. For example, the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s started in the United States but affected the entire world. 
 
 Many countries also dislike it when [[international organization]]s such as the [[United Nations]] tell them what to do. However they obey to avoid sanctions. Many people also criticize the fact that globalization means that fewer people are deciding what  brands, like [[Coca-Cola]] and [[McDonald's]], taking over smaller, local shops and businesses.  They criticize the fact that powerful countries have bigger influence on world culture than others. For example, the United States is the biggest cultural exporter, which means that countries around the world are becoming like the United States. However, this hurts local cultures. [[Jean Baudrillard]] believes that globalization hurts local cultures and is the cause of most [[terrorism]].  He also believes that most supporters of globalization just want to stay in power. < ref > {{cite web|last=Baudrillard|first=Jean|authorlink=Jean Baudrillard|title=The Violence of the Global|work=Power Inferno|publisher=Galilee|date=2002|pages=63–83|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-the-violence-of-the-global.html|access-date=2008-08-25|archive-date=2009-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130111543/http://egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-the-violence-of-the-global.html|url-status=dead}}/ < /ref > 
 
 Gregory Meyjes interprets globalization as a largely hegemonic, unequal process of socio-cultural imposition. Questioning the various processes (economic, political, cultural) by which globalization or [[globalisation]] has favored rapid Anglo-cultural dominance over a more gradual, egalitarian evolution towards an inclusive world civilization, Meyjes argues for cultural policies that support  " ecological "  relations between local ethnocultural traditions, by protecting cultural specificity in the short term and allow as many cultural groups as possible to organically contribute to the whole. At the global level, Meyjes therefore proposes the term universalization or [[universalisation]] to denote a process of (largely) non-imposed socio-cultural exchange between state-level and sub-state-level groups and  " nations "  – i.e. a transnational process that informs the gradual emergence of a universal civilization. 
 
 == Support == 
 Others, like [[Thomas Friedman]], believe that globalization can bring people together and make everyone richer without getting rid of local cultures.  People who support globalization also believe that it makes [[war]] less likely because it is bad for business. < ref name= " Friedman, 421 " > ''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421 < /ref >  [[Francis Fukuyama]] also argued that globalization would eventually lead to a system of world governance which would cause wars to end. < ref > Fukuyama, Francis. (1989) [http://www.wesjones.com/eoh.html The End of History?]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''. The National Interest'', < /ref > 
 
 Many believe that globalization helps out poorer nations by bringing them business.  A report by the [[World Bank]] said that [[poverty]] in [[India]] and [[Indonesia]] was cut in half because of globalization.  The report also said that people in poorer nations are [[life expectancy|living longer]] and better because they were making more money. < ref > {{cite web |author=The World Bank |title= Poverty in an Age of Globalization |date= August 2000 |url= http://www1.worldbank.org/economicpolicy/globalization/documents/povertyglobalization.pdf}} < /ref >
