 '''Kindergarten''', [[Literal translation|literally meaning]]  " children's garden " , is the first stage in the move from home to formal [[education]]. [[Children]] learn through [[Play (activity)|play]]. In most countries kindergarten is part of the [[nursery|pre-school]] system. In [[North America]] and some parts of [[Australia]] kindergarten is the first year of school. Kindergarten children are usually between three and seven years of age. Kindergarten ages vary from country to country. In [[Malaysia]], for example, kindergarten children are six and when they are seven years old they go to [[primary school]]. 
 
 The name kindergarten was coined by [[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852). His work influenced early-years education around the world.  
 
 Sometimes, children go to pre-kindergarten for a year, before they go to kindergarten. Pre-kindergarten is more common in [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Turkey]] than other countries.
