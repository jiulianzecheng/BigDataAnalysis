 A '''ring''' is a piece of [[jewelry]] that is usually worn on the [[finger]]. 
 
 It is usually made of [[metal]] such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[platinum]], but can be made of other things, for example, [[bone]] or [[glass]]. Many rings have [[gemstone]]s on them, for beauty and decoration on your finger. It is a [[fashion accessory]] and sometimes a sign of importance (status). The [[Lord Chancellor]]s of England were given a ring when taking office, and returned it when leaving the position. The ring identified them as the second most important person in the kingdom. 
 In most religions, senior [[clergy]] have rings of their office. It is standard practice for members of a church to kneel and kiss the ring as a sign of faith and [[wikt:obedience|obedience]]. 
 
 == Engagement and wedding rings == 
 Rings have been used for [[engagement]]s and [[wedding]]s since [[prehistoric]] times. < ref > Taylor, Gerald  &  Scarisbrick, Diana 1978. Finger rings from Ancient Egypt to the present day. [[Ashmolean Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-900090-54-5}} < /ref > < ref name= " cielo " > Cielo, Astra 2008. ''Signs, omens and superstitions''. BiblioBazaar. {{ISBN|9780559409967}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | title = Engagement Ring Trends | date=10 May 2019| url=https://www.serliandsiroan.com/single-post/2019/05/10/Popular-Engagement-Ring-Design-Trends-For-2019|accessdate=6 November 2019}} < /ref > The engagement ring is meant to be a sign of [[luck]] and [[happiness]]. Both men and women used to wear an engagement ring to show that they were going to be married, but more recently only women have worn them. A [[diamond]] ring is seen as being especially lucky, as the sparkle of the diamond is said to come from the fires of love. A [[pearl]] in a ring is unlucky, as the pearl is a sign of [[tears]]. Because the ring is round and does not have an end, it is seen as a symbol of love which never ends. < ref name= " cielo " / >  These are, of course, [[superstition]]s. However, a wedding ring is a public [[symbol]] of a legal relationship, and in many societies rings have that kind of function. 
 
 Most people wear wedding rings on the fourth finger ( " ring finger " ) of their left hand. < ref > {{cite web |last=Bello |first=Adriana |url=https://aleteia.org/2022/11/14/why-is-our-fourth-finger-considered-the-ring-finger/ |title=Why is our fourth finger the “ring finger”? |website=Aleteia  |date=14 November 2022}} < /ref >
