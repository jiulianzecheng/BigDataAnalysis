 The '''Chenopodioideae''' is a subfamily of [[flowering plant]]s are family [[Amaranthaceae]], formerly treated as a distinct family [[Chenopodiaceae]] and comprising all of the genera formerly included in this family except for those transferred to the subfamilies [[Salicornioideae]] and [[Salsoloideae]]. The precise circumscription of the subfamily is still uncertain, with research continuing; significant changes may occur to the genera included. 
 
 The subfamily as currently circumscribed has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], with about 1,400 species accepted. It is a particularly significant component of the vegetation of the arid region that extends from north [[Africa]] to central [[Asia]].
