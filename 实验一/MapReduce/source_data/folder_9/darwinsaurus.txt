 '''''Darwinsaurus''''' (meaning  " Darwin's lizard " ) is an [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] once wrongly described as ''[[Iguanodon]]''. 
 
 In the early nineteenth century dinosaur remains were discovered near [[Hastings]] in [[East Sussex]]. These were first reported by [[Richard Owen]] in 1842. In 1889 they were referred to ''[[Iguanodon]] fittoni'' by [[Richard Lydekker]]. < ref > Lydekker, R., 1889,  " Notes on new and other dinosaurian remains " , ''Geological Magazine'', '''6''': 352-356 < /ref >  They were then assigned to ''[[Hypselospinus]] fittoni'' by [[David B. Norman]] in 2010. 
 
 In 2012 Gregory S. Paul named them as a separate genus and species. The [[type species]] is '''''Darwinsaurus evolutionis'''''. The generic name honours [[Charles Darwin]] for his theory of evolution. < ref name= " Paul2012 " > {{cite book|author=Gregory S.
