 '''Kronborg''' is a castle near the town of Helsingør on the extreme north-east part of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], [[Denmark]].  
 
 The castle is at the narrowest point of the [[Øresund]], the sound between Denmark and [[Sweden]]. In this part, the sound is only 4 & nbsp;km wide. Because of this it was important to keep a fortress to command one of the few outlets of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The castle has for centuries been one of the most important [[Renaissance]] [[castle]]s in Northern [[Europe]]. It was added to [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s list on November 30, 2000. < ref > {{Cite web

 People know Kronborg well as  " Elsinore " . This is the place where the play ''Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'', written by [[William Shakespeare]], is supposed to have happened. [[Hamlet]] was performed in the castle for the first time on the 200th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. The soldiers from the castle were some of the players.
