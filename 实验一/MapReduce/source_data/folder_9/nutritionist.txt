A '''nutritionist''' is someone who helps others focus on eating healthy food and have a healthy [[nutrition]] in their diets. They also talk about the impacts of what they eat and their health. There are different types of nutritionist that focus on [[sports nutrition]], [[public health]], or [[animal nutrition]], among other disciplines. Sometimes a person can claim to be a nutritionist even without any training, education, or professional license.  
 
 They are different from being a [[dietitian]], who has a university degree, professional license, and certification for professional practice. < ref name= " lipson " > {{cite web|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/it-sounds-so-nutritionous/|title=It sounds so  " nutritionous " |author=Peter Lipson|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Science-based Medicine}} < /ref >
