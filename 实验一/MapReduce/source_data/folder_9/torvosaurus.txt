 '''''Torvosaurus''''' was a large [[carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]],  
 from the [[Upper Jurassic]]. It lived about 153 to 148 million years ago in what is now [[Colorado]] and [[Portugal]]. 
 
 ''Torvosaurus'', possibly the largest carnivore of its time, < ref > Hendrickx C.  &  Mateus O.V. 2014. ''Torvosaurus gurneyi'' n. sp., the largest terrestrial predator from Europe, and a proposed terminology of the maxilla anatomy in nonavian theropods. ''PLoS ONE'' '''9''' (3): e88905. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088905] < /ref >  was a large, heavily-built, [[bipedal]] carnivore. It grew to  9 to 11 meters (30 to 36 & nbsp;ft) in length and an estimated weight of about 2 metric tons (2.2 tons). Its hands and arms were about average for its size. In proportion, ''[[Allosaurus]]'' had more powerful arms, and [[Tyrannosaurus|T. rex]] had tiny arms. 
 
 Studies suggest that the [[natural environment|paleoenvironment]] of this part of the [[Morrison Formation]] had rivers flowing from the west into a basin with a giant, [[salinity|saline]] [[alkaline]] [[lake]]. There were extensive [[wetlands]] nearby. Fossils from the Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western [[Colorado]] show one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world. < ref > Richmond D.R.  &  Morris T.H. 1999.
