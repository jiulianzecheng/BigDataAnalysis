 '''Priapulida''' (priapulid or penis worms) < ref > from Gr. πριάπος, ''priāpos'' 'Priapus' + Lat. ''-ul-'', diminutive < /ref >  are a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of marine [[worm]]s. Their name refers to their extensible spiny [[proboscis]], which, in some species, may have a shape similar to that of a human [[penis]]. They live in the mud, which they eat, in comparatively shallow waters up to {{convert|90|m|ft}}. < ref > Barnes, Robert D. 1982. ''Invertebrate zoology''. Holt-Saunders, Philadelphia, PA. 873-877. {{ISBN|0-03-056747-5}}. < /ref > 
 
 Their nearest relatives are probably [[Kinorhyncha]] and [[Loricifera]] with which they constitute the taxon [[Scalidophora]]. Besides [[arthropod]]s and [[velvet worm]]s, the priapulids are the only members of the [[Ecdysozoa]] which are relatively large in size. They feed on slow-moving invertebrates, such as [[polychaete]] worms. 
 
 Priapulid fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle [[Cambrian]]. < ref > {{cite news|publisher=University of Bristol |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2006/1052.html |title=Evolution of a penis worm |date=2006-08-09}} 
 < /ref >  They were probably major predators of the Cambrian period. There are only sixteen known living species of priapulid worms. 
 
 There's a striking similarity between this word and Romanian  " pula*( penis) which is similar in Spanish " pola " 
 Now who's got it from who? 
 Well, it's not  " preapolid "  to indicate a Spanish origin, but Romanian 
 Compare it to another word "  copulate*( to have sex) also with .pula'
