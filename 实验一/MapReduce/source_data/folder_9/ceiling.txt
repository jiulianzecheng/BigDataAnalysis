[[File:Lightmatter Sistine Chapel ceiling.jpg|thumb|[[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling tells the story of creation]] 
 A '''ceiling''' is the [[surface]] that covers the upper limit of a [[room]]. It is not generally considered a [[Structural engineering|structural]] element, as it does not hold anything up. It simply conceals the underside of the [[floor]] or [[roof]] above it. 
 
 There are many different types of ceilings in [[architecture]]. In religious buildings, the ceilings are often decorated with [[fresco]]s, [[mosaic]] [[tile]]s and other surface treatments. Perhaps the most famous example is the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]], painted by [[Michelangelo]].
