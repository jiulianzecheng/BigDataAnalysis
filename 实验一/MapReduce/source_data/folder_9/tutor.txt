A '''tutor''' is a person who teaches or guides another person. Usually, the tutor is an older expert who teaches a younger learner. Early examples were [[Socrates]], who taught philosophy by holding conversations with his students, and [[Aristotle]], who was appointed the personal tutor of [[Alexander the Great]] when the latter was a youth. 
 
 The essence of a tutor's work is to adjust the teaching to the individual learner. The tutor has to take account of:  
 #what the learner already knows and does not know 
 #what the learner has incorrectly learnt 
 #the personal interests and goals of the learner 
 #the particular talents of the learner 
 
 The idea is that a tutor teaches, or 'moulds' the student as a whole. However, there is an obvious difference between the tutor's need for topical knowledge and his or her need for 'people skills'. The system operated at the older colleges of [[Oxford University]] recognises this by appointing two tutors to a student: a subject-matter tutor and a moral tutor. The latter helps the student with problems of a personal nature. < ref > Bailey, Cyril. 1965. The tutorial system. Revised by J.B. Bamborough, in ''Handbook to the University of Oxford''. 279â€“286 Oxford: Clarendon Press. < /ref > 
 
 Education by a tutor is often thought to be an ideal kind of education, because the tutor can adjust the learning to suit one student. However, the word is often misused. If students are taught in groups larger than three or four, then much that makes a tutorial special is lacking. 
 
 == Special cases == 
 High achievers in fields like  [[music]], [[mathematics]] and [[chess]] may be tutored when classroom methods do not meet their needs. 
 
 There are parallels in other walks of life. Sports people have [[Coach (sport)|coaches]], and the job of a coach is very similar to that of a tutor. A [[guru]] might be regarded as a kind of tutor. A mentor is a kind of tutor. Parents with children do much that a tutor does. 
 
 == Tutoring in mainstream education == 
 === Universities === 
 In [[Australia]]n, [[New Zealand]], and some [[Canada|Canadian]] [[university|universities]], a '''tutor''' is often but not always a [[postgraduate]] [[student]] or a lecturer who conducts a [[seminar]] for [[undergraduate]] students. These seminars are often known as a [[tutorial]].  
 
 In the [[United States]] and the rest of Canada, a tutor is known as a '''teaching assistant'''. < ref >  At [[St. John's College, U.S.|St. John's College]] the [[professor]]s are referred to as tutors. They serve the function of guiding the conversation and attempting to keep it focused, whether in tutorials or in seminar. < /ref > 
 
 Historically, the term  " tutor "  has assumed a simple relationship between an expert older person and a young learner. With the huge classes of a modern university the one-to-one relationship between tutor and learner is all but dead and buried. The tutor sets MCQs (multiple choice questions) and the mass of students learn a set text by rote learning. The tests are easy to mark, and the marking is done by a graduate student who gets paid for the work. 
 
 === Secondary school form tutors === 
 In [[England|English]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[secondary school]]s, '''form tutors''' are similar to American [[home room]] teachers. They are in charge of a group of [[students]] in a particular year group. 
 
 === Peer tutoring === 
 In the United States, peer tutors are students teaching other students of the same or similar age or grade level. When peer tutors are trained how to tutor correctly, peer tutoring is both cost effective and [[Academic|academically]] effective.
