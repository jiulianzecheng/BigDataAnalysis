'''Psychopathy''' is a [[personality disorder]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Psychopaths are [[emotion|unemotional]]. They do not show concern about the feelings or [[rights]] of others. They show almost no [[empathy]], and do not try to conform to social [[norm]]s. They lack a [[conscience]] and do not feel [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. A similar term is [[sociopathy]]. < ref name= " Without Conscience " >  Hare, Robert D. (1999). Without Conscience: the disturbing world of the psychopaths among us. New York: Guilford Press.

 Many psychopaths are [[wikt:charming|charming]] and often manage to have superficial ties with other people. They use other people for their own benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including [[sadism]], [[violence]] and [[lie|deception]]. They are very [[selfish]] and discard people whom they have no further use for. They may have many children by many partners. < ref > Dutton, Kevin 2012. ''The Wisdom of Psychopaths''.

 The definition of psychopathy has varied. Different definitions are used. They only partly overlap and sometimes seem contradictory. < ref name= " gap " > {{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1529100611426706 |title=Psychopathic personality: bridging the gap between scientific evidence and public policy  |last1=Skeem J.L.

 There are efforts to use [[behaviour therapy]] to treat psychopaths; often, this may be done in [[prison]]s. 
 
 Some people are mislabeled as ''psychopaths'', but have no problems with social norms, but they are good at [[Influence|influencing]] people. There is a difference between the sexes as to how psychopathy is shown. Men show it more more as an [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] pattern of behaviour. In women it shows more as a [[histrionic]] pattern (excessive attention-seeking). 
 
 Amongst professional [[Psychiatrist|psychiatrists]], psychopathy is known for being difficult to treat. < ref name= " Vien2006 "   > {{cite journal|last1=Vien|first1=Anh|last2=Beech|first2=Anthony R.|title=Psychopathy: theory, measurement, and treatment|journal=Trauma, Violence  &  Abuse|date=1 July 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=155–174|doi=10.1177/1524838006288929|pmid=16785285|s2cid=220339235 |issn=1524-8380}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|last1=Dingfelder|first1=Sadie F.|title=Treatment for the 'untreatable'|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar04/treatment.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|publisher=American Psychological Association|access-date=12 March 2016|date=March 2004|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308081259/http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar04/treatment.aspx|archive-date=8 March 2016}} < /ref >
