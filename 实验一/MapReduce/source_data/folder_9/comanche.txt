 '''Comanche peoples''' are [[Native American]]s who lived in an area called the ''[[Comancheria]]''. This is where Eastern [[New Mexico]], Southern [[Colorado]], Southern [[Kansas]], all of [[Oklahoma]] and most of Northern and Southern [[Texas]] are today. There once were as many as 20,000 Comanches. Today the Comanche Nation has 10,000 members, most in Oklahoma (centered at [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]) and the rest in [[Texas]], [[California]], and [[New Mexico]]. The Comanche speak a language of their own, the [[Comanche language]] that is related to other Native American ones, called ''[[Uto-Aztecan]] language family''. 
 
 The name Comanche was given by the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] and it was the word the Comanche used to call them, ''kleptomania'' (enemy, foreigner). But the Comanches' call themselves ''Numinous'', meaning  " human being "  or  " the People " . They were very good warriors and fought the white settlers and army for many years until they gave up in 1875. 
 
 The woman in the family made the [[teepee]]s. They gathered wild potatoes, fruits, nuts and berries. The woman in the family cooked, cleaned and made their clothing. The clothing was made out either [[bear]], [[deer]], [[bison]], [[buffalo]], [[wolves]] or [[coyote]]s.
