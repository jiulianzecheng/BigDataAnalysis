'''Misanthropy''' is the general [[distrust]] or [[hatred]] of [[humanity]].  A person who feels that way is called a '''misanthropist'''. 
 Many misanthropists are [[label]]ed using offensive terms such as [[hermit]]s and [[loner]]s. Some Misanthropic people prefer to be alone without [[interpersonal relationship]] whilst others do not trust many people outside of their immediate family or friends. Some do not trust anyone.  
 
 [[Moli√®re]]'s character Alceste in ''[[The Misanthrope|Le Misanthrope]]'' (1666) states: 
 {{cquote|My hate is general, I detest all men; < br/ > Some because they are wicked and do evil, < br/ > Others because they tolerate the wicked, < br/ > Refusing them the active vigorous scorn < br/ > Which vice should stimulate in virtuous minds. < ref > Act I.
