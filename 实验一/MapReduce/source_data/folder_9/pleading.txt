 '''Pleading''' is usually the first step in a [[lawsuit]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/pleading |title=Pleading |publisher=Cornell University Law School |access-date=27 October 2015}} < /ref >  This is when parties formally submit their claims and defenses. A ''[[complaint]]'' is the first pleading filed by a [[plaintiff]] which starts the lawsuit. A complaint lists the  relevant [[allegations of fact]] which leads to one or more legal [[causes of action]]. It also has a [[prayer for relief]] and sometimes a statement of damages claimed. This is called an ''[[ad quod damnum]]'' clause.  In some situations, a complaint is called a ''petition''. In this case the party filing a complaint is called the [[petitioner]] and the other party is the [[respondent]].  In [[equity (law)|equity]], sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a ''petition'' or a ''bill of complaint in chancery''. 
 
 == Other terms == 
 * When used in civil proceedings in [[England]] and [[Wales]], the term  " complaint "  refers to how civil proceedings are started in the [[magistrates' court]]. < ref > s.51 Magistrates Court Act 1980 < /ref >  The complaint may be either [[writing|written]] or [[wikt:oral|oral]]. 
 
 * A ''[[demurrer]]'' is a pleading (usually filed by a [[defendant]]). It objects to the legal [[wikt:sufficient|sufficiency]] of the opponent's pleading and demands that the court rule immediately about whether the pleading is legally adequate. This is before the party must plead on the merits in response.  Since demurrer procedure required an immediate ruling like a [[Motion (legal)|motion]], many [[common law]] [[jurisdiction]]s therefore went to a narrower understanding of pleadings. They are seen as framing the issues in a case but not being motions in and of themselves. The demurrer is replaced with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or the application to strike out particulars of claim. 
 
 * An ''[[answer (law)|answer]]'' is a pleading filed by a defendant. It admits or denies the specific [[wikt:allegation|allegation]]s listed in a complaint. It also serves as a [[general appearance]] by a defendant.  In England and Wales, the equivalent pleading is called a ''defence''. < ref > Civil Procedure Rules, 15.2 < /ref > 
 
 * A defendant may also file a [[cross-complaint]] or ''third-party complaint''. This is to bring other parties into a case by the process of [[impleader]]. 
 
 * A defendant may file a ''counter-claim''. This raises a cause of action to defend, reduce or set off the claim of the [[plaintiff]].
