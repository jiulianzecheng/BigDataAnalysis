'''Nontrinitarism''' is a movement that rejects the idea of the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]]. That idea says that God is three different persons in one being.  
 
 There are several movements which can be classified as Nontrinitarian. At the [[First Council of Nicaea]], in the year 325, people met and defined the idea of trinity. Some movements started before the council. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html |title=History of Dogma|accessdate=2007-06-15|last=von Harnack|first=Adolf |authorlink=Adolf von Harnack|date=1894-03-01 |quote=[In the 2nd century,] Jesus was either regarded as the man whom God hath chosen, in whom the Deity or the Spirit of God dwelt, and who, after being tested, was adopted by God and invested with dominion, (Adoptian Christology); or Jesus was regarded as a heavenly spiritual being (the highest after God) who took flesh, and again returned to heaven after the completion of his work on earth (pneumatic Christology)}} < /ref >  Nontrinitarianism was later renewed in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, and in [[Restorationism]] during the 19th century. 
 
 Modern-day versions are usually called [[Unitarianism]].  
 * [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not believe in the Trinity and are known for showing people from the [[Bible]] why they believe the idea to be false. 
 *[[Mormon]]s also do not believe in the Trinity but believe that God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three separate entities. 
 *[[Seventh-day Adventists]] did not believe in the Catholic [[doctrine]] of the trinity for the first 50 years of their existence either. The founders of the world wide Seventh Day Adventist Church believed that:  " There is one supreme God of the universe and Jesus Christ: The only begotten Son of God! " , Statement of Believes, 1873. The change came many years latter, when the founders of the Seventh Day Adventist Church had already 'slept in the Lord " (died).
