 The '''Soricomorpha''' ( " shrew-form " ) was a proposed biological group in the [[Class (biology)|class]] of [[mammal]]s. < ref name=msw3 > {{MSW3 Hutterer | pages = 220-311}} < /ref >  It includes all the [[shrew]]s, [[solenodon]]s and [[mole]]s. It is divided into four families, one extinct. The other three families are the [[shrew]]s, [[solenodon]]s and [[mole]]s. This followed the discovery, from [[sequence analysis]], that the old order Insectivora was [[polyphyletic]]. That meant it was not a single [[clade]]. 
 
 The proposal was discarded when it was discovered that a larger grouping was [[monophyletic]], and formed an natural [[clade]] of insectivores. That is the new [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Eulipotyphla]].
