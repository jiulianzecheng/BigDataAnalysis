'''Lamrim''' (Tibetan:  " stages of the path " ) is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] text which presents the stages in the complete path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as taught by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of ''lamrim'', presented by different teachers of the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]] and [[Gelug]] schools. < ref > The [[Sakya]] school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the ''[[lamdré]]''. < /ref >  However, all versions of the ''lamrim'' are elaborations of [[Atisha|Atiśa]]'s 11th Century root text ''[[A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]''. < ref name= " thubten " > [http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment] < /ref > 
 
 There is a project to expand the Lamrim Teachings with several translated texts. < ref > [http://www.jangchuplamrim.org/ Jangchup Lamrim Teachings] < /ref >
