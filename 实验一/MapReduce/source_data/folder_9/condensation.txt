 '''Condensation''' is how [[gas]] changes into a [[liquid]] when it touches a cooler surface. Condensation is part of the [[water cycle]]. It is the opposite of [[evaporation]]. < ref > {{GoldBookRef|title=condensation ''in atmospheric chemistry''|file=C01235}} < /ref >   
 
 == Process == 
 Condensation of water is when water changes from [[gas]] to a [[liquid]] or [[crystal]] shape.  Any gas can condense, either because the temperature is dropping or the [[pressure]] is increasing.  In either case the pressure of the condensing gas is higher than the [[vapor pressure]] of the gas, at that temperature). < ref > {{cite book|chapter-url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01235.html|chapter=condensation in atmospheric chemistry|doi=10.1351/goldbook.C01235 |title=The IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology |year=2014 }} < /ref > 
 
 During condensation, the [[molecules]] in the matter slow down. Heat energy is taken away, causing the state of matter to change. Condensation is [[exothermic]].  This means that condensation makes the temperature go '''up'''.  [[Evaporation]] is the opposite and causes a temperature '''loss'''. 
 
 It is a useful [[wikt:process|process]]. One use is in [[distillation]]. The gas made from a boiling liquid mix is sent to a condenser, where the different parts condense differently. This can purify a liquid, such as [[alcohol]] or [[water]]. The condensing liquid makes heat, which must be removed for the condensation to continue.
