'''Misskey''' is [[open-source software]] for  {{ill|distributed social networks|en|distributed social network}}. It was originally developed by  " syuilo " , a Japanese software engineer. < ref name=History > {{Cite web |url=https://misskey-hub.net/docs/misskey.html |title=Misskeyについて |access-date=2023-02-08 |website=Misskey Hub |language=ja}} < /ref >  When it was first developed the main service was a bulletin board, but the open-source community added short  " Notes "  and a timeline function. Those key features allowed the program and community to grow to its current size. 
 
 ==Overview== 
 A user's post is called a ''Note''. As with other distributed social networks, users can join or create servers. Each server is managed by different administrators, in different locations.    
 
 The origin of the Misskey name is from the lyrics of {{ill|'Brain Diver'|ja|Brain Diver}}, a song released by the Japanese singer {{ill|May'n|en|May'n}}. < ref name=History/ >

 ===Development=== 
 Misskey publishes its source code to [[GitHub]]. You can modify the code as long as you publish it based on [[GNU Affero General Public License|AGPLv]]3. Since Misskey also publishes {{ill|open API|en|open API}}, you can create a personal application through the code. The translation is using {{ill|Crowdin|en|Crowdin}}.

 ==Differences from Mastodon== 
 Misskey and [[Mastodon]] are both distributed social networks based on [[ActivityPub]]. 
 But their programming languages and library are different. Their APIs are not compatible. 
 Mastodon's ideology takes a critical attitude to centralized SNSs such as Twitter and Facebook.{{Citation  needed}} 
 When it began, Misskey was not designed as a distributed social network, so its ideology isn't based on an anti-centralized attitude. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://misskey-hub.net/docs/misskey.html |title=プロジェクトは何を目指していますか？ |accessdate=2021-09-29 |website= Misskey Hub}} < /ref >
