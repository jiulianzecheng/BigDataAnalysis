 {{Main|List of agrarian parties}} 
 Agrarian political parties first existed as  " peasant parties "  in Europe in the 1800s. 
 
 Today, agrarian parties are still quite popular in regional and rural areas in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]]. Modern agrarian parties typically promote [[conservatism]]; generally either [[liberal conservatism|liberal]] or [[social conservatism]], or sometimes both. All agrarian parties in Australia are classed as being either [[centre-right]] or [[right-wing]], as are most of European agrarian parties.

 ====Australia==== 
 In Australia, the [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] is the main agrarian party. They were originally called the Country Party. They form a centre-right alliance called the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] with the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]], which is mostly based in the cities. On the federal level and in two states ([[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]), the Coalition is a formal alliance and both parties join either the cabinet (if in government) or the shadow cabinet (if in opposition). In [[Western Australia]], the Coalition is a formal alliance, but both parties are independent of each other. In [[Queensland]] and the [[Northern Territory]], the two parties merged to become the [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] (LNP) and the [[Country Liberal Party]] (CLP), respectively. In [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]], the Coalition does not currently exist and it has never existed in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. 
 
 The Nationals are normally the smaller party in the Coalition; when a Coalition government is elected federally, in New South Wales or in Victoria, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] (federally) or the [[Premiers of the Australian states and territories|Premier]] (on the state level) is the [[Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia|leader]] of the Liberal Party but the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] (federally) or the Deputy Premier (on the state level) is the [[Leader of the National Party of Australia|leader]] of the Nationals. However, the party has provided three Prime Ministers, three [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]]s and six [[Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premiers]]. Before the Coalition merged in Queensland in 2008, the Nationals were the bigger Coalition party in Queensland. Currently, the Nationals are also the bigger Coalition party in Western Australia. 
 
 The Nationals hold seats in both chambers of the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] as well as in both chambers of three state parliaments: the parliaments of [[Parliament of New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Parliament of Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Parliament of Western Australia|Western Australia]]. When they existed in Queensland, they had seats in the [[Parliament of Queensland|Queensland Parliament]]. They also used to have seats in the parliaments of [[Parliament of South Australia|South Australia]] and [[Parliament of Tasmania|Tasmania]]. They do not exist in the ACT, due to it being almost only made up of one city ([[Canberra]]) and very few non-urban areas. 
 
 There are also smaller agrarian parties in Australia, like [[Katter's Australian Party]] and the [[Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party]]. [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation|One Nation]] is also described as agrarian in many ways, but they also are active in non-rural areas and have many other policies. 
 
 The [[Northern Territory Nationals|NT Nationals]] were an agrarian political party in the Northern Territory, but they no longer exist. When they did exist, they did hold seats in the [[Parliament of the Northern Territory|Northern Territory Parliament]], but were not related to the federal Nationals or the CLP.
