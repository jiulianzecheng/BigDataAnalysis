 A '''Metcard''' is a type of ticket used to use [[public transport]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. It allows the holder to use [[Railway|Trains]], [[Trams]] and [[Buses]], in two zones ( < font color=goldenrod > '''Zone 1''' < /font >  and  < font color=blue > '''Zone 2''' < /font > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/fares_tickets/metropolitan_fares_and_tickets/metropolitan_zones |title=Metropolitan zones - Metlink - Your guide to public transport in Melbourne and Victoria |access-date=2008-05-31 |archive-date=2008-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074514/http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/fares_tickets/metropolitan_fares_and_tickets/metropolitan_zones |url-status=dead }} < /ref > ). Zone 1 covers areas close to the [[CBD]], and Zone 2 covers the rest of the city.

 ==History== 
 Metcard replaced a identical yet simpler system of scratchies used on the Melbourne public transport network. Scratchies were easy to cheat and the system was eventually abandoned in 2002, < ref > {{cite web

 Moves towards automated ticketing were first made by the then state Liberal Government in [[1992]]. Tenders were called for the design, supply, installation and on-going maintenance of such a system, with the 'OneLink Transit Consortium' announced as the preferred people to do it in September 1993. The contract was signed in May [[1994]], with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group. < ref name=robx > {{cite web

 Controversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction, due to it costing to much, the abolition of tram [[Conductor (transportation)|conductors]] and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines. The machines were attacked by [[Vandalism|vandals]] frequently (often by pouring [[liquid]]s into the [[coin slot]]), and have seen several revisions to their design since. < ref name=downie > {{cite web

 Consistent with the [[privatisation]] ethos of the government of the day, Metcard's operation was entirely outsourced, with the transport operators (at that time government-owned) having nothing to do with the system. Metcard even had its own website and branding which became stronger than the anonymous and constantly renaming government then privatised operators. 
 
 An study released by the State Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 (27.2%) of the machines at [[train station]]s did not work, and 11.9% of mobile equipment in buses and trams was non-operational. < ref > {{cite web

 }} < /ref >  The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator ''OneLink Transit Systems'' to improve the service to commuters. Following these improvements, a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1% at train stations, and 98.3% on buses and trams. Usability was also improved, with tram machines able to sell daily tickets. Furthermore, vandalism across the network dropped by 62% between [[2001]] and [[2002]]. < ref name=downie/ >
