 '''Basel''' ([[french language|French:]] ''Bâle'') is a [[city]] in the north of [[Switzerland]]. It is sometimes called '''Basle''' in [[English language|English]]. < ref > Grihault, Nicki 2011. Basle, Switzerland: A cultural guide. T Travel, Telegraph Media Group, London. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/switzerland/8741459/Basle-Switzerland-A-cultural-guide.html] < /ref >  Basel is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Basel-Stadt]].

 Basel borders [[Germany]] and [[France]] in the north and the canton of [[Basel-Landschaft|Basel-Land]] in the south. The [[Rhine River|Rhine river]] flows through the city. 
 
 == History == 
 Basel was a prince-[[Bishop|bishopric]] from 999 until 1803. Most of the city was destroyed in the 1356 Basel earthquake, the strongest earthquake ever recorded in [[Central Europe]]. Basel joined Switzerland in 1501.

 Basel is well known for the many chemical and pharmaceutical companies that are located in the city, such as [[Novartis]], [[Syngenta]] and [[Hoffmann-La Roche]]. 
 
 The only [[port]]s in Switzerland are located along the Rhine river in Basel, which makes the city important for [[Import|imports]] and [[Export|exports]] to and from Switzerland. Water transport using [[Freighter|cargo ship]]s on the Rhine river connects Basel with the seaport of [[Rotterdam]]. Basel ports are connected to the Swiss railway and road network. 
 
 Basel shares the international airport [[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]] with the French city [[Mulhouse]]. 
 
 == Education == 
 The [[University of Basel]] was founded in 1460 and is the oldest in Switzerland and one of the oldest in the world. [[Erasmus]], [[Paracelsus]], Daniel Bernoulli, [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] worked here.
