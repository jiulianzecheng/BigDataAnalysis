 The monastery was all rebuilt by lord Smbat of the [[Orbelian Dynasty|House of Orbelian]], a branch of the [[Liparitids]] who were removed to Armenia in the late [[12th century]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Liparitids were themselves a branch of the [[Mamikonian]]s. Smbat was the ancestor of the Armenian princes of [[Syunik]]. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] writings around the drum attests his name. The monastery has a [[gavit]] and various service buildings around the site. The government of Armenia has recently begun fixing the monastery.
