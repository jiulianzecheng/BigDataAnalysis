 '''Hemorrhoid''' or '''haemorrhoid''' (also commonly called piles) are vascular structures (similar to veins) in the anal canal which help with [[Defecation|stool evacuation]]. We only speak of hemorrhoids (or piles) when they become swollen or [[inflammation|inflamed]]. But Hemorrhoids are a normal part of the [[anatomy]] and everyone has these structures. They act as a cushion that is made of complex tissue. Their job is to aid the passage of stool. Hemorrhoids are very common. Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time to time. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/dxc-20249175|title=Hemorrhoids - Symptoms and causes|newspaper=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Causes == 
 It is not known what causes hemorrhoids, but [[Medical doctor|doctor]]s often speak of several main factors. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=von Roon|first1=Alexander C.|last2=Reese|first2=George E.|last3=Tekkis|first3=Paris P.|date=2009-01-29|title=Haemorrhoids: haemorrhoidal artery ligation|journal=BMJ Clinical Evidence|volume=2009|issn=1752-8526|pmc=2907769|pmid=19445775}} < /ref >  These factors include chronic '''constipation''' or '''diarrhea''', sitting on the toilet for a long time and '''straining''' during defecation. Hemorrhoids may also appear because of sports. When something heavy is lifted, additional pressure is applied on the area. Women are in danger of having hemorrhoids during [[pregnancy]]. This also happens due to increased pressure from the [[baby]]. Hemorrhoids are more likely with aging because the tissue becomes weaker. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Some people are more likely to get hemorrhoids if other family members have them. Receptive partners in [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]] are also in risk of heorrhoids. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Margaret A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gsIEAAAQBAJ & dq=hemorrhoids+anal+intercourse & pg=PT672 |title=Nurse Practitioner Certification Exam Prep |date=4 December 2020 |publisher=[[F.A.

 == Symptoms == 
 According to their anatomical origin hemorrhoids can be two types - internal and external. '''Internal hemorrhoids''' originate from inside the [[anus]]. But internal hemorrhoids can also go down and show outside the anus. In this case, medical professionals are talking about '''prolapse'''. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/understanding-hemorrhoids-basics#1|title=What Are Hemorrhoids?|newspaper=WebMD|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Symptoms of internal hemorrhoids include ''itching, [[bleeding]], swelling, [[mucus]] discharge, burning sensation, prolapse, and soiling''. Patients also complain of general discomfort while sitting, feeling of fullness and presence of a foreign body inside the anus. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://proktos.info/hemorrhoids/hemorrhoids-symptoms/|title=Proktos.info {{!}} Symptoms and diagnosis|website=Proktos.info|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-08-11}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  Internal hemorrhoids can only cause [[pain]]less bleeding from the anus, while '''external hemorrhoids''' are painful. External hemorrhoids are located on the outside of the anus. They look like a bluish lump. But sometimes internal hemorrhoids can also become extremely painful. This happens because they develop a [[clot]]. In these cases, a '''thrombosed hemorrhoid''' occurs and it may have to be [[Surgery|operated]]. Pain in the area around the anus may be due to another [[disease]], such as [[anal fissure]], anal fistula, or proctitis. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Pfenninger|first1=John L.|last2=Zainea|first2=George G.|date=2001-06-15|title=Common Anorectal Conditions: Part I. Symptoms and Complaints|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0615/p2391.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2391–2398|pmid=11430454|issn=0002-838X}} < /ref > 
 
 == Diagnosis == 
 Hemorrhoids are diagnosed by a doctor. A visual examination of the anus is usually needed. The doctor may want to perform a [[Rectum|rectal]] examination which will help detect internal hemorrhoids, [[tumour]]s, [[polyp]]s, or abscesses. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  The visual examination usually requires a special device, called [[Anoscopy|anoscope]] to be inserted in the anus. The procedure is painless unless another disease is presented. 
 
 == Treatment == 
 Treatment of hemorrhoids can be done at home or in the hospital. Usually, the best option is to prevent getting them. This can be done by keeping the stools soft and bulk, so they pass easily during defecation. Stools can be made softer and larger by increasing [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] intake. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/fiber|title=Fiber and Digestion Problems|newspaper=WebMD|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US}} < /ref >  This means eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Most people do not have enough fiber in their diet. In such case, fiber supplements, such as [[psyllium]] or [[methylcellulose]], can be of benefit. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite news|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment|title=Treatment of Hemorrhoids {{!}} NIDDK|newspaper=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US}} < /ref >  As being receptive partner in [[anal sex]] is also a way of risk to get hemorrhoids, one should be careful of being receptive partner during anal sex, and he can be mostly safe from getting hemorrhoids through [[anal sex]] by totally avoiding it. < ref > {{cite book |title=PDxMD Gastroenterology |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] - Health Sciences Division |isbn=978-1-932141-04-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRJsAAAAMAAJ & q=anal+intercourse+hemorrhoid+avoid |accessdate=9 December 2023 |language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 It is also important to increase fluids intake and maintain [[hydration]]. It is recommended to drink six to eight glasses of water a day to help keep stools soft. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Home treatment may include sitz baths, topical creams, and suppositories. There are many types available for the treatment of hemorrhoids, but there is little evidence supporting their use. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Lohsiriwat|first=Varut|date=2015-08-21|title=Treatment of hemorrhoids: A coloproctologist's view|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG|volume=21|issue=31|pages=9245–9252|doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i31.9245|issn=1007-9327|pmc=4541377|pmid=26309351}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Diosmin]]-[[Hesperidin]] compound is the most commonly used [flavonoid]]s for the primary treatment for hemorrhoids, which is present in [[citrus]] fruit's peel extract. It is sold in the [[United States]] and other countries in the brand name of [[Daflon]] and [[Venalex]] in tablet form, but studies have questioned it's benefits and, according to researchers, are likely to cause side effects. 
 
 Small lifestyle modifications are important when dealing with hemorrhoids. Not straining during defecation and going as soon as the urge appears are important measures. Staying active can help prevent constipation and reduce weight. < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 
 === Procedures === 
 Sometimes hemorrhoids can not be treated at home or the patient seeks help. Doctors can treat hemorrhoids with office procedures or in a hospital setting. 
 
 Office treatments include: 
 * '''Rubber band ligation -''' Rubber band ligation is a simple procedure. The doctor uses a special device to place a [[rubber band]] around the hemorrhoid. The band cuts off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid. The hemorrhoid will then fall within a week. Scar tissue then forms to keep the remaining tissue fixated. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/rubber-band-ligation-for-hemorrhoids|title=Rubber Band Ligation for Hemorrhoids|newspaper=WebMD|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US}} < /ref >  This procedure is usually painless, because there are no nerve endings where the rubber band is placed. The patient should seek medical assistance if extreme pain is felt. This might be due to thrombosis.  
 * '''Sclerotherapy -''' the procedures involves an injection into the internal hemorrhoid. The injection contains special solution which causes scar tissue to form and shrink the hemorrhoid. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Seok-Gyu|last2=Kim|first2=Soung-Ho|date=December 2011|title=Optimal Treatment of Symptomatic Hemorrhoids|journal=Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology|volume=27|issue=6|pages=277–281|doi=10.3393/jksc.2011.27.6.277|issn=2093-7822|pmc=3259422|pmid=22259741}} < /ref > 
 * '''Infrared photocoagulation -''' In this procedure [[infrared]] light is applied at the internal hemorrhoid. The infrared light causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 * '''Electrocoagulation.''' A special device is used  to apply [[electric current]] onto the internal hemorrhoid. The procedure causes scar tissue to form, which cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 In severe cases when home and office procedures fail, a surgical approach can be considered. There are several surgical techniques used. All of them are associated with different complications, such as bleeding, infection ([[sepsis]]), anal strictures, fecal [[incontinence]], etc. < ref name= " :4 " > {{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/diagnosis-treatment/dxc-20249208|title=Hemorrhoids - Diagnosis and treatment|newspaper=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}} < /ref >  Some of the procedures involve hemorrhoid removal. These procedures are commonly known as '''[[Hemorrhoidectomy]]'''. There are several variants, but in all of them, the surgeon will remove the hemorrhoids. The procedure can be performed to remove external and large prolapsing internal hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidectomy is infamous for being very painfu. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Medina-Gallardo|first1=Adrian|last2=Curbelo-Peña|first2=Yuhamy|last3=De Castro|first3=Xavier|last4=Roura-Poch|first4=Pere|last5=Roca-Closa|first5=Josep|last6=De Caralt-Mestres|first6=Enric|date=2016-11-15|title=Is the severe pain after Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy still currently remaining a major postoperative problem despite being one of the oldest surgical techniques described?

The anal canal contains many nerves, which can easily be traumatized. 
 
 Other surgical procedures include - '''stapled hemorrhoidopexy''' (PPH, Longo's procedure) and '''doppler-guided artery ligation''' (DG-HAL/RAR or THD). 
 
 Stapled hemorrhoidopexy involves a special device, called stapler, which lifts and fixates the prolapsed hemorrhoids. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://proktos.info/hemorrhoids/surgical-treatment/stapled-hemorrhoidopexy-pph/|title=Proktos.info {{!}} Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy (PPH)|website=Proktos.info|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-08-11}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  The stapler will also excise mucosal tissue to block the blood flow to the remaining hemorrhoids. However, stapling procedure is associated with a greater risk of recurrence. < ref name= " :4 "  / > 
 
 Doppler-guided ligation of hemorrhoidal arteries (DG-HAL/RAR or THD) has been recently purposed as a safe and relatively painless alternative to hemorrhoidectomy. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Ratto|first1=C.|last2=de Parades|first2=V.|date=2015-04-01|title=Doppler-guided ligation of hemorrhoidal arteries with mucopexy: A technique for the future|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187878861400109X|journal=Journal of Visceral Surgery|series=152/2S  " Proctology " |volume=152|issue=2|pages=S15–S21|doi=10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2014.08.003|pmid=25262549}} < /ref >  A special [[ultrasound]] device is applied to identify the arteries that supply the hemorrhoids. The surgeon will then will the ligate them, cutting the blood supply and preventing further problems.
