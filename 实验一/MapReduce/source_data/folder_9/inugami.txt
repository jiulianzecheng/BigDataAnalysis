 The '''Inugami''' ({{lang-ja|犬神}}) is a type of [[Dog|canine]] [[deity]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. He is described as a ''[[yōkai]]'' with the appearance of a dog, and often as a very powerful spirit whose have the power to [[Possession|possess]] a human being if he wants to, as well. 
 
 It is widely believed that, in order for an Inugami to be born, one must bury a dog in its entirety, leaving visible only the part of the neck and head. In this, while waiting for the dog's death, the person who buried it must tell him all his pains and evil deeds she has committed at some point, until he dies. When this happens, the person must then cut off the dog's head and sewe it back to the body, and thus the Inugami will arise. 
 
 Inugamis were often linked to important Japanese [[clan]]s and families, and sometimes these same families were accused of having been possessed by a [[Kitsune]] (a spirit with the appearance of a [[fox]]) as well, gaining fame and power very quickly.
