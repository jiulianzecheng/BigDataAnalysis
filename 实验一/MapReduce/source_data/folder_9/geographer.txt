 A '''geographer''' is a [[scientist]] whose area of study is [[geography]]. 
 
 That is the study of [[Earth]]'s physical [[natural environment|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat]].  
 
 Geographers are historically known as people who make [[map]]s. Nowadays map making is the field of study of [[cartography]], a subset of geography. The geographer studies not only the physical details of the environment. He looks at the influence of this physical environment as well. Therefore he looks at human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. He will concentrate on the influence space has for relationships between these elements. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www2.una.edu/geography/statedepted/definitions.html |title=What is Geography?
