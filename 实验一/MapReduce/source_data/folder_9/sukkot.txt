 '''Sukkot''' (also known as '''Feast of Tabernacles''') is a [[Jewish]] [[festival]]. In this event, people celebrate the gathering of the crops, and remember the time in the past when small [[shelter]]s were made by the Jews when they were in the wilderness and had no [[home]]s. It happens 5 days after the Jewish festival Yom Kippur and lasts for 1 week.
