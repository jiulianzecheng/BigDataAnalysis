 '''Disability''' is a condition that a person has which limits them in some way. < ref > DePoy, Elizabeth; Gilson  &  Stephen French 2004. ''Rethinking disability: principles for professional and social change''. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole. ISBN 978-0-534-54929-9 < /ref >  These conditions may be [[congenital]] (present at birth), [[cognition|cognitive]] (to do with the brain), [[Developmental disability|developmental]] (appears as the person develops), physical (for example, caused by an [[accident]] or [[infection]]), [[sense|sensory]], or a combination of factors. 
 
 The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] defines disability in Article 1 as: 
 
 : " long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others " . 
   
 I'''nvisible disabilities''', or hidden disabilities are disabilities that are not immediately obvious. Some examples of invisible disabilities are [[intellectual disabilities]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[mental disorder]]s, [[asthma]], [[epilepsy]], [[allergies]], [[migraine]]s, [[arthritis]], and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.umass.edu/studentlife/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Invisible%20Disabilities%20List%20%26%20Information.pdf |title=Invisible Disabilities: List  &  Information |publisher=Disabled World |date=2015-10-28 |access-date=2021-02-15 }} < /ref > 
 
 People with a disability or disabilities may need to use special equipment that can help them. This can include using a [[wheelchair]], a cane or walking stick, [[hearing aid]]s, a [[teletypewriter]] (TTY) and using specially designed software and hardware for the [[personal computer]]. 
 
 People who use a wheelchair cannot walk up or down stairs in a building. They need to use ramps and elevators (lifts)  going into and moving around in a building. Wide doorways and accessible toilets also make it easier for people with physical disabilities to use. 
 
 [[Prejudice]] towards people with disabilities is common. This is sometimes called '[[ableism]]'. People with such a prejudice are called an [[ablecentrist]]s. < ref > Goodley, Dan, and Katherine Runswick‚ÄêCole. 2011.
