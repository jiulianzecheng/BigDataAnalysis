 Swimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times; the earliest record of swimming dates back to [[Stone Age]], from around 7,000 years ago.  Competitive swimming started in [[Europe]] around 1800 and was part of the first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], though not in a form [[comparable]] to the contemporary events.  It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the International Swimming Federation to produce competitive swimming. < ref > {{cite book | last = Kehm | first = G | title = Olympic Swimming and Diving:Great Moments in [[Olympic]] History | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=U2Kr_xFY2eUC & pg=PA14 14] | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1404209701 }} < /ref >
