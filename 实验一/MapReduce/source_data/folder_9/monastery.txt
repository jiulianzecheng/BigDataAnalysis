 '''Monasteries''' are places where [[monk]]s live. Although the word  " monastery "  is sometimes used for a place where [[nun]]s live, nuns usually live in a '''convent''' or '''nunnery'''. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Des|title=Canonsleigh Abbey: a Thriving Devon Nunnery?|url=https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume7/Canonsleigh_Abbey-_a_Thriving_Devon_Nunnery_.pdf|access-date=|website=University of Exeter: College of Humanities}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Čapská|first=Veronika|date=15 March 2014|title=Framing a Young Nun's Initiation: Early Modern Convent Entry Sermons in the Habsburg Lands.

The monk in charge of an abbey is called an '''abbot'''; the nun in charge of an abbey is an '''abbess'''. 
 
 Several religions have a system of monasteries. Christian monasteries have a [[chapel]] for the monks to worship. Monks are not allowed to marry (celibacy). They are also not allowed to own anything. Everything they use, including their clothes, belongs to the monastery. During the [[Middle Ages]] after the [[Roman Empire]] was defeated, monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed. 
 
 Some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived. The monks who live there live very isolated lives, growing their own food and looking after one another.  Other monasteries were in or near [[town]]s. Monks do a lot of work in the [[community]], including as [[teaching]], [[medical]] care or telling people about [[God]]. Few monks live isolated lives nowadays.
