''Not to be confused with [[Public utility]]'' 
 
 In [[economics]], '''utility''' is the amount of [[happy|satisfaction]] you get from consuming (using) [[goods]] and [[manufacturing|products]]. Changes in utility are called ''utils'', even though there is not really a [[wikt:standard|standard]] scale for them. For example, a cup of [[cocoa|hot chocolate]] can have 100 utils, and a cup of orange juice 80 utils. One of the most well-known uses of utility, especially in economics, is the utility of [[money]].
