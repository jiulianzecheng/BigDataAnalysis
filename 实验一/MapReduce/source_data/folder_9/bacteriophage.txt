 A '''bacteriophage''' is a [[virus]] that [[infection|infects]] [[bacteria]]. The term is commonly shortened to '''phage'''. 
 Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]]. < ref name= " autogenerated1 " > {{cite book| last1 = Grath| first1 = Stephen Mc| last2 = Sinderen| first2 = Douwe van| title = Bacteriophage: genetics and molecular biology| url = http://www.horizonpress.com/phage| year = 2007| publisher = Caister Academic Press| isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1| id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/phage Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology] }} < /ref >  Like viruses that infect [[eukaryote]]s ([[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]]) there are many different phage structures and functions. < ref > Britannica, The Editors of Encyclopaedia.

 The top of phages is made up of a dice-like shape which has 20 sides and 30 edges. Inside it contains the genetic information, which is its DNA. This dice-like shape often sits on a tail that has leg-like fibres. 
 
 Phages are typically made of an outer [[protein]] [[hull]] that has [[nucleic acid|genetic material]] inside it. The genetic material may be single-stranded (ssRNA or ssDNA), or double-stranded (dsRNA or dsDNA). It may be between 5,000 and 500,000 [[base pairs]] long with either circular or linear arrangement. Bacteriophages are usually between 20 and 200 [[nanometer]]s in size. 
 
 Phage [[genomes]] may code for as few as four [[genes]], < ref > Bacteriophage MS2 < /ref >  and as many as hundreds of [[genes]]. Phages have a life cycle that begins when the phage attaches to the bacterium. Then they inject their [[genome]] into the bacterium. The genome uses the parts of the bacterium to [[replication|replicate]] inside it. When there are many phages inside the bacterium, they put enzymes in the bacterium that weaken the outer cell wall so they can burst through it to infect new bacterias. 
 
 Phages are everywhere there are [[bacteria]], such as [[soil]]s or the [[intestines]] of animals. They are very common in [[sea water]]: up to 9×10 < sup > 8 < /sup >  [[virus|virions]] per milliliter have been found in [[microbial mat]]s at the surface, < ref name= " mmbr " > {{cite journal | last = Wommack K.E.  &  Colwell R.R. 2000 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.1.69-114.2000 | title = Virioplankton: viruses in aquatic ecosystems | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | year = 2000 | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–114 | pmid =  10704475| pmc =98987 }} < /ref >  and up to 70% of marine bacteria may be infected by phages. < ref name= " Prescott " > {{cite book| last1 = Prescott| first1 = Lansing M.| last2 = Harley| first2 = John P.| last3 = Klein| first3 = Donald A.| title = Microbiology| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-697-01372-9 }} < /ref > 
 
 They have been used for over 90 years as an alternative to [[antibiotics]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe, as well as in [[France]]. < ref name= " horizon " > BBC Horizon 1997.

 They are a possible therapy against [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] strains of many bacteria. < ref name= " fmicb " > {{cite journal | last1 = Keen E.C. 2012 | title = Phage therapy: concept to cure | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238 | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | year = 2012 | volume = 3 | page = 238 | pmid =  22833738| pmc = 3400130| doi-access = free }} < /ref >  On the other hand, some phages complicate [[biofilm]]s involved in [[pneumonia]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]. They shelter the bacteria from drugs and so prolong the infection. < ref > [http://phys.org/news/2015-11-bacteria-bacteriophages-collude-formation-clinically.html Bacteria and bacteriophages collude in the formation of clinically frustrating biofilms] < /ref >
