'''Pachypleurosaurs''' were primitive [[sauropterygia]]n reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic [[lizard]]s, and were limited to the [[Triassic]] period.  They were long animals, ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length, with small heads, long necks, paddle-like limbs, and long deep tails.  The [[pelvis|limb girdles]] are greatly reduced, so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land.  The widely spaced peg-like teeth project at the front of the jaws, indicate that these animals fed on [[fish]].

 Pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the [[Nothosaur]]s. < ref > Benton M.J. 2004. ''Vertebrate paleontology''. 3rd ed, Blackwell, Oxford.
