 '''Bullfighting''' is an old sport. Today it is mostly done in [[Spain]], and in [[Portugal]], and some [[Country|countries]] of [[South America]]. 
 
 The largest bullring is the [[Plaza México]] in central [[Mexico City]], which seats 48,000 people, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |title=www.worldstadiums.com |publisher=www.worldstadiums.com |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-date=5 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605140518/http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and the oldest is the [[Plaza de toros de la Real Maestranza de Caballería de Sevilla|La Maestranza]] in [[Seville]], Spain, which was first used for bullfighting in 1765. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.realmaestranza.com/PAGINASR/historiapt.htm |title=Plaza de Toros - Institución < !-- Bot generated title -- >  |access-date=2013-01-01 |archive-date=2009-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203094616/http://realmaestranza.com/PAGINASR/historiapt.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The Spanish bullfight (''Corrida de toros'') is a fight to the [[death]]. The modern bullfight has a [[ritual]]. It has three distinct stages, the start of each being [[signal]]led by a [[trumpet]]. The bullfighters (''Toreros'') enter the arena in a [[parade]], to [[Paso doble]] music. The rules, costumes and traditions were sorted out by Paquiro (Francisco Montes Reina, 13 January 1804 {{ndash}} 4 April 1851, the greatest matador of his time. 
 
 A team of bullfighters is seven men. The leader is the '''matador''', and he has six assistants, who play [[role]]s in the [[drama]]. Bullfighters' [[costume]]s are inspired by 18th century [[Andalusia]]n clothing. ''Matadores'' ('those who kill the bull') are easily seen by the gold of their ''traje de luces'' ('suit of lights'). 
 
 At the end comes the ''tercio de muerte'' ('the third of death'). The matador re-enters the ring alone with a small [[red]] [[cape]], and a [[sword]]. The cape called a ''muleta''. The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a [[series]] of passes. The ''faena'' is the performance with the cape. The ''faena'' ends with a final series of passes in which the bullfighter tries to move the bull into position. He then [[stab]]s it between the [[shoulder blade]]s and through the [[aorta]] or [[heart]]. The act of thrusting in the sword is called an ''estocada''. 
 
 If the matador gets it wrong, he may be [[gored]] by the bull's [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]], and killed. This does happen: some very famous matadors have died in the ring. When the great matador Manolete was killed in the ring at the age of 31, three days of official [[nation]]al mourning were held. Bullrings do have an [[infirmary]] with an operating room, for the immediate treatment of bullfighters with horn [[wound]]s. 
 
 There is great opposition to the bullfight from [[animal welfare]] organisations. There are also versions of the bullfight in which the animal is unharmed. 
 
 ==Art== 
 Bullfighting has influenced all forms of art and culture. [[Ernest Hemingway]] said of bullfinghting:  " Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour " . < ref > Hemingway E. 1932. ''Sun in the Afternoon''. New York: Scribner's < /ref >  Spanish dance and musical forms such as the [[paso doble]] and [[flamenco]] are heavily influenced by the spectacle of the bullfight.
