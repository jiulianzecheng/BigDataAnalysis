 The '''nave''' is where the [[congregation]] sits in a [[church]]. It usually has long [[bench]]es, called 'pews', or separate [[chair]]s. 
 
 Naves are found in humble [[Saxon]] churches, and in grand [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Christian [[Abbey]]s, [[Cathedral]]s, and [[Basilica]]s.  
 
 The '''nave''' is the central approach to the high [[altar]], the main body of the church. 'Nave' ([[Latin|Medieval Latin]] ''navis'',  " ship " ) was probably suggested by the shape of its [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] resembling an upside-down hull (bottom of a ship).
