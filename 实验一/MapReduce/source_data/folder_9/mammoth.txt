 A '''mammoth''' is any species of the extinct elephantid genus '''Mammuthus'''. 
 
 == Overview == 
 
 The various species of mammoth were commonly equipped with long, curved tusks. 
 
 They lived from the Pliocene epoch into the Holocene about 4,000 years ago, and various species existed in Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. 
 
 Mammoths are more closely related to living Asian elephants than African elephants.

 The term mammoth may refer to a number of organisms, but is used here to describe the hairy [[proboscidea]]n of the genus ''Mammuthus''. They lived in [[Europe]] until 4,500 years ago, and were [[adaptation|adapted]] to cold [[climate]]. They were killed off by [[hunter]]s and [[climate change]]. 
 
 They lived in the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] epochs. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/otherFossils/mammuthus.php#top |title=Woolly Mammoth ('''Mammuthus primigenius'') |publisher=The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University |accessdate=2012-03-07 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013323/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/otherFossils/mammuthus.php#top |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=livescience > {{cite journal |author=Guthrie R.D |title=Radiocarbon evidence of mid-Holocene mammoths stranded on an Alaskan Bering Sea island |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6993 |pages=746–9 |year=2004  |pmid=15201907 |doi=10.1038/nature02612 |bibcode=2004Natur.429..746D |s2cid=4394371 |url= }} < /ref >  In the Pleistocene, northern Europe was covered with [[ice]] and [[tundra]].
