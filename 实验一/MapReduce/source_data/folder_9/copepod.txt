 '''Copepod'''s (meaning  " oar feet " ) are small, [[shrimp]]-like [[crustacean]]s that swim in [[sea]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[pond]]s. Copepods are very important in the [[Food chain|food web]], and many animals eat them. 
 
 There are 10 [[Order (biology)|orders]] of copepods and over 4500 [[species]]; a few orders are free-swimming, but many are [[parasites]] (of [[fish]]). The free-swimming copepods move through the water in jerky motions by moving their swimming legs.
