 The 1904-1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] resulted a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] [[victory]] when the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and the [[Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]] got defeated by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in 1905 when the [[Empire of Japan|Empire Of Japan]] led by [[Emperor Meiji]] declared war on [[Tsar Nicholas II]] in 1904 when [[Trans-Siberian railway]] was to built more [[Railway track|Railway Tracks]] in [[Manchuria]] in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] and [[Korean Empire|Korea]] . Japan took the southern part of Sakhalin and renamed it to South Sakhalin and control it from 1905-1945 . 
 
 In August 1945 during the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and [[World War 2]] in [[Asia]] the [[Soviet Union]] led by [[Joseph Stalin]] invaded South Sakhalin after he invaded [[Manchukuo]] this war would be known as the [[WW2|Soviet-Japanese War Of 1945]] . 
 
 Sakhalin is the subject of a whole book by Anton Chekhov (1895), reprinted in many Russian editions of his collected works. It has been translated into English. Of other old books, there is an interesting one by an Englishman, Charles H. Hawes, To the Uttermost East. (N.Y.: Scribner;s, 1904). Now, however, the island is experiencing an oil boom.
