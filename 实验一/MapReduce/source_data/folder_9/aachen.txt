 Charlemagne ordered the building of a [[cathedral]] in 786 AD. He was buried in a tomb in this cathedral. German emperors were [[Coronation|crowned]] in the cathedral in Aachen until 1531. < ref name=Aachen > {{Cite book| title = The new American Desk Encyclopedia | publisher = Signet| date = 1984| page = 9| isbn = 0-451-12803-6}} < /ref > 
 
 European countries made two important peace agreements in Aachen. In 1668, the first treaty (agreement) ended the [[War of Devolution]] between [[France]] and the alliance of England, Holland and Sweden. The treaty allowed France to keep most of the towns it had captured in [[Flanders]] the year before. In 1748, the second treaty ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. In this war, France, [[Prussia]], and other nations tried to take territory from the [[Austrian Empire]]. The treaty said that [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was the ruler of these territories. It also gave Prussia the territory of [[Silesia]]. 
 
 Since 1972, Aachen has been part of the [[Cologne Government Region]].
