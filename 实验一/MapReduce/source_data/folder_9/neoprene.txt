'''Neoprene''' is the '''DuPont Performance Elastomers''' trade name for a family of synthetic [[rubber]]s based on '''polychloroprene''' (polymer form of [[Chloroprene]]).  Neoprene was invented by DuPont scientists after Dr. [[Elmer Keiser Bolton|Elmer K. Bolton]] of DuPont attended a lecture by [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Fr]] [[Julius Arthur Nieuwland]], a professor of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. 
 
 ==Applications== 
 It is used in a wide variety of environments, such as in [[wetsuit]]s, laptop sleeves, cars, bombs, [[electricity|electrical]] [[Electrical insulation|insulation]], and [[automobile|car]] fan [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s.  Its chemical inertness makes it well suited for industrial applications such as [[gasket]]s, [[hose (tubing)|hose]]s, and [[corrosion]]-resistant [[coating]]s. It can also be used as a base for [[adhesive]]s.  
 
 ===Uses=== 
 *[[ball]]s; [[diaphragm]]s as in [[diaphragm]] [[valve]] 
 *sheet: [[glove]] 
 *[[foam]]: [[wetsuit]]; [[glove]] 
 *[[adhesive]]: [[adhesive tape]]; [[liquid adhesive]]
