 The '''Sarcopterygii'''  < ref > from [[greek language|Greek]] ''sarx'', flesh, and ''pteryx'', fin < /ref >  is a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[fish]]. They are '''lobe-finned fish''', like the [[lungfish]] and [[coelacanth]]s. They are a [[clade]] of [[bony fish]] which first appeared in the [[Silurian]], 418 million years ago (mya). One line in this group gave rise to the [[tetrapod]]s. < ref name=Jenny/ > 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 These are [[bone|bony]] fishes with paired rounded fins. These fins, being similar to [[limb]]s, suggest that these fish may be ancestors of [[tetrapod|land vertebrates]]. All sarcopterygians possess [[teeth]] covered with true [[Tooth enamel|enamel]]. 
 
 As a [[clade]], the group includes all its descendants. This means it includes the [[Tetrapod]]s, that is, all [[species]] of four-[[limb]]ed [[vertebrate]]s. < ref name= " Nelson " > {{cite book|title=Fishes of the World|last=Nelson|first=Joseph S.|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons, Inc|year=2006|isbn=0-471-25031-7}} < /ref >  The fin-limbs of sarcopterygiians are very similar to what people believe was the [[ancestor|ancestral]] form of tetrapod limbs. The ancestors of tetrapods are to be found amongst the lobe-fins of the [[Devonian]] period. < ref name=Jenny > Clack, Jennifer A. 2002 ''Gaining ground: the origin and evolution of tetrapods''. Indiana University Press, Bloomington IN. {{ISBN|0-253-34054-3}} < /ref >  The term '[[fishapod]]' is becoming used for this [[transitional group]]. 
 
 ==Evolution== 
 Sarcopterygians and their relatives the [[Actinopterygii]] ('ray-finned fish') make up the super-class [[Osteichthyes]],  the 'bony fish', which have a bony skeleton rather than [[cartilage]]. Otherwise, there are vast differences in fin, respiratory, and circulatory structures between the Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii. 
 
 The first sarcopterygians, found in the uppermost [[Silurian]] (about 418 mya), closely resembled the [[Acanthodii]], the 'spiny fish' which went extinct at the end of the [[Palaeozoic]] era. In the early–middle [[Devonian]] (416–385 mya), while the predatory [[placoderm]]s dominated the seas, some sarcopterygians came into [[freshwater]] habitats. 
 
 In the early Devonian (416–397 mya), the sarcopterygians split into two main lineages — the [[Coelacanth]]s and the [[Rhipidistia]]. The former never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and [[Carboniferous]], from 385 to 299 mya, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic; coelacanths still live today in the [[ocean]]s (genus ''[[Latimeria]]''). 
 
 The [[Rhipidistia]]ns, whose ancestors probably lived in the oceans near the [[river]] mouths ([[estuaries]]), left the ocean world and migrated into freshwater habitats. They in turn split into two major groups : the [[lungfish]] and the [[tetrapod]]s. The lungfish evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs; they learned in the middle Devonian (397–385 mya) how to live outside a water environment, using their stubby fins (proto-limbs) to walk on land and find new water if their waterhole was depleted, and their lungs to breathe air and get sufficient oxygen. The lungfish's greatest diversity was in the [[Triassic]] period; today there are fewer than a dozen genera left. 
 
 The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the later [[Devonian]] epoch (385–359 mya), with the appearance of [[tetrapod]]s (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods are the only tetrapodomorphs which survived after the Devonian. 
 
 Non-tetrapod sarcopterygians continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] (251 mya).
