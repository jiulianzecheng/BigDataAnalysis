 ==Characters== 
 * '''Melaka  " Mel "  Fray''' - A 19-year-old [[thief]] and Vampire Slayer. Unlike other Slayers she has had no [[Prophesy|prophetic]] dreams of her [[destiny]] or of the Slayers before her. She feels she is responsible for the death of her brother, and is now trying to figure out what is her destiny as the Slayer. 
 * '''Urkonn''' - A [[demon]] who trains Mel as a Slayer instead of her actual [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]]. In the end, he betrays her. After defeating her brother, Mel discovers Urkonn's betrayal and kills him. 
 * '''Loo''' - A [[Mutation|mutated]] girl who is friends with Mel. She is murdered by Urkonn to get Melaka to fight her brother. 
 * '''Harth Fray''' - Mel's twin brother, who was [[wikt:attack|attacked]] by a vampire during a theft with Mel. To save his life, Harth drank the vampire's blood and became a vampire himself. No other Slayer has had a twin. Because he is the Slayers twin, Harth had the prophetic dreams and visions of past Slayers that Mel did not. 
 * '''Erin Fray''' - Mel's older sister and a [[police officer|cop]]. Erin blamed Mel for the death of their brother for a long time. 
 * '''Icarus''' - The vampire that killed Harth four years ago. He was killed by Erin right before the big battle. 
 
 == Connections to ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' == 
 Fray's [[scythe]] was used in the last three episodes of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. [[Buffy Summers]], also a vampire Slayer, found the scythe stuck in rock in [[Sunnydale]]. The scythe was later used to create fully developed Slayers of the many Potential Slayers. It has never been stated as to how the scythe travelled from Sunnydale, [[California]] to [[New York City]] through the [[century|centuries]], or who had it during that time (or how they got it). 
 
 In ''Fray'' it is also explained that sometime in the twenty-first century,  " a Slayer, possibly with some mystical allies, faced an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[army]] of demons. And when it was done, they were gone. All demons, all [[magic]]ks, banished from this earthly dimension, " . The Slayer, whose fate is unknown, was the last to be called. 
 
 Discussing her connection to the Slayer line, Urkonn tells Melaka,  " In your dreams, you're someone else. A slave. A princess. A girl in school in a sunlit city. "  The [[scar]] Fray has and her personality are similar to Buffy in the alternate universe created in season 3 episode  " The Wish " .
