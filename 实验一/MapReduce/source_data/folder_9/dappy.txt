His father was the [[bass guitar|bassist]] in 1970s group [[Mungo Jerry]].Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks [[fluency|fluent]] [[English language|English]] with a classic North London [[accent]]. He does not think of himself to be  " English in anyway " . At home he speaks [[Greek language|Greek]]. He says he is a  " [[foreign]] guy that lives in Camden " . He wears unusual [[hat]]s. His [[trademark]] is a selection of [[wool]]ly [[fleece]] lined hats with big [[pom-pom]]s on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called  " Dappy hats " . He normally turns up one side of the hat. 
 
 == Early life and current status == 
 Dappy was born in Camden Town, [[London]]. It is said that he grew up in a small council [[apartment|flat]] with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large [[townhouse]] because his father was a member of 1970s band [[Mungo Jerry]]. In an [[interview]] he gave to [[The Sun]], he said that the estate he lived on was  " rough and lots of the kids I saw got into [[illegal drugs|drugs]] or fights " .{{fact|date=May 2021}} Dappy showed interest in [[music]] from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard  " Fazer "  Rawson and [[Tulisa Contostavlos|Tula  " Tulisa "  Contostavlos]], who is his cousin. At the time they were called the  " Lickle Rinsers Crew " . Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at [[Haverstock School]]. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple [[truancy|truancies]] and fighting. He later went back to study at [[college]] and received a [[GCSE]] A* in [[English language|English]]. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the  " inspiration behind the band " . With the [[money]] he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small [[recording studio|studio]] for the band. When Byron died, the song [[N-Dubz]] wrote  " Papa (Can You Hear Me?) "  was played at his [[funeral]]. It  became the group's best [[hit single|hit]] at #19, and at #17 in the [[download]] charts. Dappy later had the words  " RIP Dad "  [[tattoo]]ed on his neck. He refers to his dad as  " B "  or  " [[Uncle B]] " . 
 
 He is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity [[Big Brother (UK)]]. 
 
 == Personal life == 
 N-Dubz were forced to change some of their [[live show]]s from the Uncle B [[concert tour|tour]] after Dappy got temporary [[deaf]]ness. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a151718/n-dubz-forced-to-reschedule-live-shows.html |title=Music - News - N-Dubz forced to reschedule live shows |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2009-04-03 |access-date=2009-12-04 |archive-date=2012-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023165944/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a151718/n-dubz-forced-to-reschedule-live-shows.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   He later said that it  " was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear. " 
 
 ==Criticism== 
 In 2007 Dappy released ''Love For My Slum'' with fellow [[United Kingdom|UK]] rap artist [[Baker Trouble]]. It was number one on [[Channel U]] for several weeks. It did not do as well with the [[media]]. It was heavily [[critic]]ised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of [[money|expensive luxury]] flats with a  " rich kid "  who is trying to look like a [[gangster]]. ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote  " His [[lyrics]] combine [[jealousy]] with [[anger]]: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his [[coat]], pulls him toward him, and [[punch]]es him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement... " , they then went on to put  " Do scenes like these suggest that [[music video]]s are encouraging their viewers to indulge in [[crime|criminality]]? " . < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/music-video-violence-should-grime-clean-up-its-act-403286.html |title=Music video violence: Should grime clean up its act? - Media, News |publisher=The Independent |date=2007-09-24 |access-date=2009-12-04 |archive-date=2012-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202023845/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/music-video-violence-should-grime-clean-up-its-act-403286.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Other [[newspaper]]s put that he was  " [[idol]]ising [[thug]]gery " . When asked in interviews about the [[single (music)|single]], and these comments he said  " these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got " . < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/3668/2.html |title=N-Dubz: Interview - Time Out London |publisher=Timeout.com |access-date=2009-12-04 |archive-date=2009-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214111005/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/3668/2.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

They were taken away by armed officers.
