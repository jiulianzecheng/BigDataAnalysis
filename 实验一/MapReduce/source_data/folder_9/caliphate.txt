 A '''caliphate''' ({{lang-ar|خِلافة}} ''khilāfa'') is a state ruled by an [[Islam]]ic leader known as a '''caliph''' ({{lang-ar|خَليفة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|khalīfah}}'' {{Audio|Ar-khalifa.ogg|pronunciation}}). This is a person considered a political-religious successor to the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], and a leader of the entire [[Muslim]] [[community]]. < ref name= " C " > Kadi, Wadad  &  Shahin, Aram A. 2013.

 The [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]] directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the muslim community. They were chosen through ''[[:en:Shura|shura]], ''a process of community consultation that some think is an early form of Islamic [[democracy]]. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_1601_1650/roots_of_democracy_in_islam.htm |title=The Roots of Democracy in Islam |publisher= Irfi.org |date= 2002-12-16 |accessdate= 2014-06-30}} < /ref >  During the [[history of Islam]] after the [[Rashidun]] period, many muslim states, mostly [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]], have claimed to be caliphates. < ref name=C / >  Caliphs were not thought of as having the same prophetic power as Muhammid did. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Pollard| first1 = Elizabeth| last2 = Rosenberg| first2 = Clifford| last3 = Tignor| first3 = Robert| title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart| url = https://archive.org/details/worldstogetherwo03alti| year = 2011| publisher = Norton| location = New York,New York| isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2| page = [https://archive.org/details/worldstogetherwo03alti/page/309 309] }} < /ref >

 == History == 
 === Rashidun, AD 632-661  === 
 {{main|Rashidun Empire|Muslim conquests}} 
 [[Abu Bakr]], the first successor of [[Muhammad]], nominated [[Umar]] as his successor on his deathbed, and there was [[wikt:consensus|consensus]] in the Muslim community to his choice. His successor, [[Uthman Ibn Affan]], was [[election|elected]] by a council of electors ([[Majlis]]). But soon he was seen by some more as a  " king "  than as an elected leader. Uthman was killed by members of an opposition group. Then [[Ali]] took control. He was very popular with many, but he was not accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt. Later on even some of his own guard were against him. He had two major [[rebellion]]s and was [[assassination|assassinated]] after a tumultuous rule of only five years. This period is known as the [[First Fitna|Fitna]], or the first Islamic [[civil war]]. 
 
 [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]], a relative of Uthman, and governor ''(Wali)'' of [[Syria]] became one of Ali's challengers. After Ali's death he became Caliph. Under him, the caliphate became a [[Inherit|hereditary]] office for the first time. He founded the Umayyad [[dynasty]]. 
 
 In areas which were previously under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, the Caliphs lowered taxes, provided greater local autonomy, greater religious freedom for [[Jew]]s, indigenous [[Christian]]s, and brought peace to peoples that were demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine-Persian warfare. < ref > [[John Esposito]] (1992) p.36 < /ref > 
 
 === Umayyads, AD 661-750 === 
 {{Main|Umayyad Empire}} 
 [[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|250px|thumb|The Caliphate, 622-750 {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under Muhammad, 622-632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the Rashidun Caliphs, 632-661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661-750}}]] 
 Under the Umayyads the Caliphate grew rapidly geographically. Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into [[Hispania]] and eastward through Persia and ultimately to [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in modern-day [[Pakistan]]. This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three [[continents]] ([[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]]). Although not ruling all of the [[Sahara]], homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa usually via various [[nomad]] [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. 
 
 Largely due to the fact that they were not elected via [[:en:Shura|Shura]], the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim community. Some supported prominent early Muslims like [[Al-Zubayr]]; others felt that only members of Muhammad's clan, the [[Banu Hashim]], or his own lineage, the descendants of Ali, should rule. There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hisham and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750.  However, the ''{{Unicode|Shiˤat ˤAlī}}'',  " the Party of Ali " , were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and not from Ali. Following this disappointment, the {{Unicode|Shiˤat ˤAlī}} finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several {{Unicode| Shiˤa}} denominations. 
 
 The Umayyad Caliphate emerged as the rulers of the Islamic world. Although they maintained the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanians']] administrative practices, the Umayyads considered Islam as primarily an [[Arab]] religion and were wary of Persian culture. They enforced use of the Arabic language in Persia, leading to the demise of the [[Middle Persian]] or [[Pahlavi]] alphabet in favor of the new [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]/[[Persian alphabet]] in use to this day. They attempted to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] Persians as they had  " Arabized "  and assimilated the [[Egypt]]ians and the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], but with much less success. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.mage.com/TLbody.html |title=From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran |access-date=2008-06-10 |archive-date=2008-06-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612101751/http://www.mage.com/TLbody.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==== The Caliphate in Hispania ==== 
 {{Main|Al-Andalus}} 
 During the Umayyad period [[Hispania]] was an integral province of the Umayyad Caliphate ruled from Damascus, Syria. Later the caliphate was won by the Abbasids and ''[[Al-Andalus]]'' (or Hispania)  split from the [[Abbasid#List of Abbasid Caliphs|Abbasid Caliph]] in Baghdad to form their own caliphate. The '''Caliphate of Córdoba''' (خليفة قرطبة) ruled the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the city of Córdoba, from 929 to 1031. This period was characterized by remarkable success in technology, trade and culture; many of the masterpieces of [[Spain]] were constructed in this period, including the famous [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]]. The title '''''Caliph''''' (خليفة) was claimed by [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] on January 16, 929; he was previously known as the '''Emir of Córdoba''' (أمير قرطبة). All Caliphs of Córdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty; the same dynasty had held the title Emir of Córdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula, before it split into [[taifa]]s. Spain possessed a significant native Muslim population until 1610 with the success of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]-instigated [[Spanish Inquisition]], which expelled any remnants of Spanish Muslim ([[Morisco]]) or Jewish populations. 
 
 === Abbasids, AD 750-1258 === 
 {{Main|Abbasid Empire}} 
 The Abbasids had an unbroken line of Caliphs for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the [[Middle East]]. By 940 the power of the Caliphate under the Abbasids was waning as non-Arabs, particularly the Berbers of [[Maghreb|North Western Africa]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]], and later the [[Mamluk]]s in Egypt in the latter half of the 13th century, gained influence, and sultans and emirs became increasingly independent. However, the Caliphate endured as both a symbolic position and a unifying entity for the Islamic world.During the period of the Abassid dynasty, Abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged. The {{Unicode| Shiˤa}} [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]] of the Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of Caliph in 909, creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa. Initially covering [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and [[Palestine]], before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain, reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031. 
 
 === Shadow Caliphate, 13th-16th century AD === 
 1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph [[al-Musta'sim]] by [[Mongols|Mongol]] forces under [[Hulagu Khan]]. A surviving member of the Abbasid House was installed as Caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the Mamluk Sultanate three years later; however, the authority of this line of Caliphs was confined to ceremonial and religious matters, and later Muslim historians referred to it as a  " shadow "  Caliphate. 
 
 === Ottomans, 16th-20th century AD === 
 {{Main|Ottoman Empire}} 
 [[File:OttomanEmpireIn1683.png|350px|thumb|The Ottoman Empire in 1683.]] 
 Ottoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan and sometimes also used the title of Caliph.  [[Mehmed II]] and his grandson [[Selim I]] used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries.  As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength, Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority. 
 
 Ottoman rulers used the title  " Caliph "  symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the [[Mamluk]] Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands. The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo, [[al-Mutawakkil III]], was taken into custody and was transported to [[Istanbul]], where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I. 
 
 After the Ottomans lost a war with the [[Russian Empire]] they signed a peace treaty with [[Russia]] in 1774.  The Sultan had to surrender large territories, including ones with large Muslim populations, such as [[Crimea]], to the [[Russian Empire]].  However, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]] claimed a diplomatic victory by assigning himself the protector of Muslims in Russia as part of the peace treaty.  Russia, meanwhile, was the protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire.  This was the first time the Ottoman caliph was acknowledged as having political significance outside of Ottoman borders by a European power.  Although the Ottoman borders were shrinking, the powers of the Ottoman caliph increased. 
 
 Around 1880 Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] reasserted the title as a way of countering the spread of European [[colonialism]] in Muslim lands. His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of [[British Raj|British India]]. By the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Ottoman state, despite its weakness vis-à-vis Europe, represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity.  But the sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt, [[India]] and [[Central Asia]]. 
 
 === Khilafat Movement, AD 1920  === 
 {{main|Khilafat Movement}} 
 {{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}} 
 In the 1920s the [[Khilafat Movement]], a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate, spread throughout the British colonial territories in Asia. It was particularly strong in British India, where it formed a rallying point for Indian Muslims and was the one of the many anti-British Indian political movements to enjoy widespread support. Its leaders included [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]], his brother Shawkat Ali, and [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari]], and [[Hasrat Mohani]].  For a time it worked in alliance with [[Hindu]] communities  and was supported by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.indhistory.com/khilafat-movement.html |title=The Khilafat Movement |access-date=2008-06-10 |archive-date=2015-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428192813/http://www.indhistory.com/khilafat-movement.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.quaid.gov.pk/politician6.htm |title=The Statesman |access-date=2008-06-10 |archive-date=2007-04-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416001259/http://www.quaid.gov.pk/politician6.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   However, the movement lost its momentum after the arrest or flight of its leaders, and a series of offshoots splintered off from the main organization. 
 
 === End of Caliphate, AD 1924  === 
 {{further|Atatürk's Reforms}} 
 On March 3, 1924, the first [[List of Presidents of Turkey|President of the Turkish Republic]], Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, as part of his [[Atatürk's Reforms|reforms]], constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (parliament) of the newly formed Turkish Republic and the title has since been inactive. In 2014 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] claimed the title but most Muslims did not accept it.
