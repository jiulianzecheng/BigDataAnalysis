 A '''peninsula''' is a region of land that [[stick]] < nowiki/ > s out in a body of [[water]]. It is also defined as a piece of land with water on three sides. 
 
 Many [[countries]] are on peninsulas, and may either take up part of a peninsula (such as [[Jutland|Portugal]]) or all of it (such as [[India]]). Parts of a country may also be on a peninsula. For example, [[Jutland]] is a peninsula, as is [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]] in [[Mexico]]. 
 
 If [[Eurasia]] is considered a [[continent]] then the continent of [[Europe]] is technically a peninsula. In this case, the great peninsulas of Europe, the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]], [[Italian Peninsula|Italian]], and [[Balkan Peninsula|Balkan]] peninsulas would technically be peninsulas within peninsulas. The area of the European Peninsula, comprised of [[Europe]] minus [[Russia]], [[Fennoscandia]], and any islands, is roughly 4.4 million square kilometers. 
 
 The [[Arabian Peninsula]] is usually cited as the largest peninsula in the world with an area of 3,237,500 square kilometers.
