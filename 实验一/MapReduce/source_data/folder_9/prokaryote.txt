 '''Prokaryotes''' (or ''Monera'') are some of the simplest living things. < ref > Excluding [[virus]]es < /ref >   They are [[unicellular organism]]s and they include two major divisions of simple living beings: [[bacteria]], and [[Archaea]]. < ref > The word 'prokaryote' describes a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The name comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pro-'' (meaning ''before'') and ''karion'', meaning ''[[Nut (fruit)|nut]]'' or ''[[kernel]]''. < /ref >   They generally do not have a [[cell nucleus]], [[nuclear membrane]] or cell [[organelle]]s, however a small number of exceptions have been found.  Prokaryotes possess genetic material in the form of a single DNA loop called a Nucleoid that floats around freely inside the cell. Bacteria include the [[Cyanobacteria]] (formerly known as blue-green algae due to their photosynthetic capacity). 
 
 Some form [[biofilm]]s that are somewhat like [[multicellular organism]]s. 
 
 Besides a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], prokaryotes lack other things [[eukaryote]]s (cells with a true nucleus) have. They reproduce without fusion of [[gametes]]. They do not have [[membrane]]s. This means that there are no [[vacuole]]s, [[Golgi apparatus]], [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticula]] or other organelles inside the cell. However, they do have [[ribosomes]], though of a simpler kind than eukaryotes. Eukaryote cells include organelles which were once free-living prokaryotes. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 In 1977, [[Carl Woese]] proposed dividing prokaryotes into the [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] (originally Eubacteria and Archaebacteria) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms. This arrangement of Eukaryota (also called  " Eukarya " ), Bacteria, and Archaea is called the [[Domain (biology)|three-domain system]], replacing the traditional [[Domain (biology)|two-empire system]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Woese CR |title=There must be a prokaryote somewhere: microbiology's search for itself |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=1â€“9 |year=1994 |pmid=8177167 |pmc=372949 |doi= 10.1128/mr.58.1.1-9.1994|url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long & pmid=8177167}} < /ref > 
 
 The Archaea include simple organisms which were first discovered in [[extremophile|extreme environments]]. Most of them can survive at very high or very low temperatures. Some of them can also survive in highly [[salt]]y, [[acid]]ic or [[alkaline]] water. Some have been found in [[geyser]]s, [[black smoker]]s or [[oil well]]s. 
 
 The prokaryotes may not be a [[monophyletic]], taxonomic group of common descent, but merely a group of similar organisms. The relationships between [[Archaea]], [[Eubacteria]] and [[Eukaryota]] are assessed differently by different scientists. The three-domain system of [[Carl Woese]] treats them as one monophyletic group.
