 A '''knot''' is a fixed looping of a piece of string or [[rope]]. Knots are often used for binding things together. While a knot is often made from rope, it can also be made from many other things. In fact, a knot is actually the condition a long flexible object is in. For example, [[hair]] can be tied in a knot. The ends of [[balloon]]s are tied in a knot to prevent the air from escaping. The average person over 5 or so years of age is likely capable of tying a knot; most of these knots people tie are probably with their [[shoelace]]s. Ribbons are also tied in a knot so as to appear pretty, as when wrapped around a [[gift]]. In addition, knots are also made by [[sailor]]s in many different forms and for many different purposes. There are even people who have adopted knot-making as a hobby.
