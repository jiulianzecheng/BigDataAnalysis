 A '''shirt''' is a kind of [[cloth]] which is made to cover the upper body.  In [[North America]], shirts can mean  T-shirts, polo shirts, etc.  In [[Britain]], a shirt has a [[collar (clothing)|collar]], sleeves with [[cuff]]s and split in half with buttons on one side. (North Americans would call this a  " [[dress shirt]] " , a specific type of  " collared shirt " ). Some shirts have [[sleeve]]s, that cover the [[arm]]s. [[T-shirt]]s are a type of shirt that has shorter sleeves. These sleeves cover the [[shoulder]]s. Shirts that do not have sleeves are called  " sleeveless " .
