 '''Storks''' are a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[bird]]s ('''''Ciconiidae'''''). They usually live near shallow bodies of water where they wade through the water, and catch small animals, like [[frog]]s, [[crab]]s, or small [[fish]]. Many species of stork are [[migration|migratory]], they spend the summer and the winter in different places. There are 19 different [[species]] of stork, in six [[genus|genera]]. The [[marabou stork]] is the largest species of stork. The [[Abdim's stork]] is the smallest species of stork 
 
 Probably the best known stork is the [[white stork]]. It is known to build large [[nest]]s in high places. Stork nests are often very large. They may be used for many years. Beforehand, people believed storks were [[monogamy|monogamous]], that they only had one partner in life. More recent research has shown  that they may change partners. They are attached to a nest almost as much as to a partner. 
 
 The [[marabou stork]], which lives in [[Africa]], has a [[wing]]span of up to 320 & nbsp;cm. This makes it the largest bird still alive, together with the [[condor|Andean condor]].

 == In fiction == 
 The stork has many legends (stories) about it, as in the Ancient Greek storyteller's [[Aesop|Aesop's]] (6th century [[BC]]) ''[[The Farmer and the Stork]]'' and ''[[The Fox and the Stork]]''. The first fable (short story) begins with a farmer [[Plow|plowing]] his fields, planting his seeds and spreading his nets. These nets caught a few [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] who hopped behind him eating the seed. Along with the cranes in his net the farmer discovered a stork with a [[broken leg]]. The stork begged the farmer to spare his life, saying that he was not a crane, but a stork. He pointed to his feathers and told the farmer that they didn’t resemble a crane’s feathers at all. The farmer laughed at the stork and said, “I have taken you with these [[Robber|robbers]] (thieves), the cranes, and you must die in their company.” Another common legend is that storks deliver babies  instead of the mothers [[Childbirth|giving birth]].
