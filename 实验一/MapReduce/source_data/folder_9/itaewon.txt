 '''Itaewon''' is a neighborhood in Yongsan-gu, [[Seoul]]. It is an international neighborhood. Travellers and [[expatriate]] residents come here for  shopping, [[restaurant]]s, and nightlife.  
 
 About 22,000 people live there, but between 4000-5000 reportedly visit the commercial district daily. Many US military personnel from the nearby Yongsan Garrison come here. Itaewon has restaurants serving food from many parts of the world, including [[India]], [[Thailand]], and [[Mexico]]. Those foods are not common in Korea.
