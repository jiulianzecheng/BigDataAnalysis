 '''Keymer'''  is a [[village]] in [[West Sussex]], [[England]]. It can be found on the B2116 road 2.4 miles south of [[Burgess Hill]]. 
 
 Keymer used to be a village on its own until it was merged into the modern day village of [[Hassocks]]. Keymer's records go back as far as [[The Domesday Book]]. Keymer is situated just to the east of Hassocks and is only a matter of a few hundred yards from the boundary with [[East Sussex]]. It has a fine parish church unusually called St Cosmas and St Damian Church. The oldest part of Keymer can be found in the area of this church and the Greyhound Pub. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol7/pp179-181|title=Parishes: Keymer - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}} < /ref > 
 
 To the north-east of Keymer can be found [[Oldland Mill]] dating from the 17th Century. It is one of the few remaining windmills still standing in the south-east. The new burial ground that is now run by Hassocks Parish Council can be found located to the east of the Greyhound Pub.
