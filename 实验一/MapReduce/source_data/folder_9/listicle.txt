When talking about [[journalism]], a '''listicle''' in an article that is published as a list. The titles of such articles will usually contain a number, and often a superlative:  " The 10 most important things... " ,  " The 30 best places... "  are examples of such titles. The article will then give this numbered list, and often also an explanation, for each item. Many of these listicles are presented in a [[Countdown|count-down]] order, so that the best item is at the end. This also implies a ranking. Other listicles give no ranking directly, and simply discuss the items, perhaps gropuing them by theme:  " 20 things to do in .. " .The word is a [[portmanteau]] derived from ''list'' and ''article.'' The word is similar to  " popsicle " . This stresses the fun but  " not too nutritious "  nature of the listicle. < ref > {{cite web|last=Okrent|first=Arika|author-link=Arika Okrent|title=The listicle as literary form  & #124; The University of Chicago Magazine|url=https://mag.uchicago.edu/arts-humanities/listicle-literary-form|access-date=2017-03-13|publisher=Mag.uchicago.edu}} < /ref > 
 
 Listicles also have the benefit that they can be produced more rapidly than in-depth articles or essays, which may require a lot of research.

 While conventional reportage and essay-writing often require the careful crafting of narrative flow, the building-block nature of the listicle lends itself to more rapid production. It can also be a means of  " recycling "  information, as often it is the context, not the content, that is original. For example, one can construct a listicle by adding captions to [[YouTube]] clips. For these reasons, the form has come under criticism as a  " kind of cheap content-creation " . < ref name=idolator_2007 > {{Cite web|date=2007-10-09|title=Blender Jerks Off Another  " Worst "  List|url=https://www.idolator.com/308611/iblenderi-jerks-off-another-worst-list|access-date=2020-11-08|website=idolator}} < /ref >

 It's so easy you wonder why everyone doesn't do it until you realize that now it's all they do: Come up with an idea ( " Top 10 Worst [X] " ) on the L train ride to the office that morning, [and] slap together 10 (or 25, or 100) cultural artifacts ripe for the kind of snarky working over that won't actually tax you at all as a writer/thinker. < ref name=idolator_2007 / >

 The blogger and technologist [[Anil Dash]] has disparaged the proliferation of listicles, particularly within the [[blogosphere]], characterizing them in 2006 as the  " geek equivalents of Cosmo coverlines " . < ref >

 Nevertheless, the form remains a mainstay of the newsstand and of the [[World Wide Web |web]]. The covers of magazines such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and ''[[Men's Journal]]'' regularly sport at least one, if not several listicles. Some websites, such as [[BuzzFeed]], generate hundreds of listicles daily. < ref > {{cite news |last=Alpert |first=Lukas I. |date=January 29, 2015 |title=BuzzFeed Nails the 'Listicle'; What Happens Next? |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/buzzfeed-nails-the-listicle-what-happens-next-1422556723 |access-date=November 1, 2016}} < /ref >

 Alex Johnson, writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', suggested that an 1886 speech by [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] which gave a list of around 100 books  " which on the whole are perhaps best worth reading "  was an early form of listicle, and that Lubbock should be considered the 'godfather' of the format. < ref > {{Cite web |date=2018-04-24 |title=Meet Sir John Lubbock, Godfather of the must-read listicle |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/sir-john-lubbock-the-book-list-literature-reading-godfather-mustread-listicle-a8320811.html |access-date=2021-12-22 |website=The Independent |language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Steven Poole]] suggested that listicles have literary precursors like [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s  " [[The Analytical Language of John Wilkins]] " . He also compares it to more high-art versions like [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Infinity of Lists]]'', a book composed entirely of lists. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Poole |first1=Steven |date=12 November 2013 |title=Top nine things you need to know about 'listicles' |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/12/listicles-articles-written-lists-steven-poole}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2009, posts in the format  " [[25 random things about me#Notes|25 Random Things About Me]] "  became an [[Internet meme]], starting on [[Facebook]] but spreading to the broader web, and attracting considerable media coverage in the process. < ref > {{cite web |last= Taylor |first= Marisa |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/02/10/facebook-mystery-who-created-25-random-things-about-me/ |title= Facebook Mystery: Who Created '25 Random Things About Me'? |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= February 10, 2009 |access-date= January 31, 2013 |archive-date= September 24, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120924133056/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/02/10/facebook-mystery-who-created-25-random-things-about-me/ |url-status= dead }} < /ref >
