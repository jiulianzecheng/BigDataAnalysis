 '''Chernobyl''' or '''Chornobyl''' ({{lang-uk|Чорнобиль}}) is a [[city]] in northern [[Ukraine]], near the border with [[Belarus]]. 
 
 It was an important center of trade and commerce, especially in the [[19th century]]. The city is 14.5 kilometers (9 miles) south of the Chornobyl [[nuclear power]] [[nuclear plant|plant]], which became known for the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chornobyl disaster]]. The plant exploded on 26 April 1986. Clouds of dangerous [[radioactive]] [[particle]]s were released.  The power plant started leaking dangerous radioactive matter. More than 100,000  people were evacuated from the city and other affected areas.  
 
 Despite the fact that radiation is still being emitted from the nuclear disaster site, the 800-year-old city of Chornobyl survives. As of 2004, government workers still police the zone. They try to clean up radioactive material. Hundreds of people — mostly  the elderly — have decided to live with the dangers and have returned to their homes in the zone's towns and villages.  Their population was highest in 1987, when there were more than 1200 people.  In 2003, there were about 300. There are currently 704 people living in Chornobyl, the houses that have people inside have a sign on the outside saying, Owner of this house lives here. 
 
 In 2022, as part of [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russia's invasion]] into Ukraine, Chernobyl has since been under [[Battle of Chernobyl|Russian military control]].
