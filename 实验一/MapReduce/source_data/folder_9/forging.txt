 '''Forging''' is a way of making things.  It involves changing the shape of [[metal]] by using [[Physical compression|compressive]] forces.  These forces are normally supplied by hitting the metal with a [[hammer]] or a [[die (manufacturing)|die]].  There are different types of Forging based on the [[temperature]] at which the forging is done. These include cold forging, warm forging, and hot forging. For warm and hot forging, the metal is [[heat]]ed. This is usually done in a [[Blacksmith#Forge|forge]]. Things can be forged in many different sizes. They can range in weight from less than a [[kilogram]] to hundreds of [[Metric ton|metric tons]]. < ref name= " Degarmo389 " > Degarmo, p. 389 < /ref > < ref name= " wnaForge " > [http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf122_heavy_manufacturing_of_power_plants.html Heavy Manufacturing of Power Plants] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108062405/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf122_heavy_manufacturing_of_power_plants.html |date=2010-11-08 }} ''[[World Nuclear Association]]'', September 2010. Retrieved: 25 September 2010. < /ref >  Forging has been done by [[metalsmith|smith]]s for a very long time. Common products made by forging include [[kitchenware]], [[household hardware|hardware]], [[Tool|hand tools]] and [[Weapon|weapons]] such as [[Sword|swords]] and [[Axe|axes]]. 
 
 Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], forged parts are widely used in [[machine]]s. They are used in machine when a part that has a high [[strength of materials|strength]] is needed,

 Forging is one of the oldest [[metalworking]] processes. < ref name= " Degarmo389 " / >  It was normally done by a [[Blacksmith|smith]] using hammer and [[anvil]]. People started using water power in the 12th century. They also started working with [[iron]] at that time. Using water power allowed them to use bigger and more powerful hammers.  This allowed the smiths to increased the amount and size of iron that could be forged. The [[Blacksmith#Forge|forge]] has changed over centuries. It has become a place with [[Engineering|engineered processes]] and equipment to handle the needs of modern [[industry]]. 
 
 In modern times, forging is often done with [[machine press|presses]] or with hammers powered by [[compressed air]], [[electricity]], [[hydraulics]] or [[Steam power|steam]]. These hammers can weigh thousands of [[Pound (mass)|pounds]].
