 '''Dispersion''' is the idea that the [[frequency]] of a wave influences its [[velocity]] (speed). Dispersion is most easily seen in the [[refraction]] of light, when all the [[color]]s inside white [[light]] become separated by a [[prism]].  
 
 When a white beam is shone at the prism, all the colors in the light (color [[spectrum]]) are slowed when they meet the prism. Each color then refracts (bends) at a different angle, making us see a [[rainbow]]. 
 
 Dispersion is also important in [[telecommunication]] when different parts of a signal arrive at different times.
