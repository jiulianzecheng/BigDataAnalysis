 '''Crux''' (IPA: /ˈkrʊks/), commonly known as the '''Southern Cross''', is a [[constellation]] that can be seen by people in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Its four brightest stars are in the shape of a [[cross]]. The name ''Crux'' is the [[Latin]] word for a cross. It is a small constellation, but the four main stars are bright, so the cross shape is easily seen in the [[sky]]. Each of the four stars has an [[Magnitude (astronomy)|apparent visual magnitude]] brighter than +2.8. The four stars point approximately in the directions of [[north]], [[south]], [[east]] and [[west]]. 
 
 Crux was first described by the Italian navigator Andrea Corsali in 1515. < ref name=startales > {{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/crux.htm |title=Crux: The southern cross |work=Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |accessdate=28 January 2013}} < /ref >  In the past, sailors used Crux to help with [[navigation|navigating]] across oceans. 
 
 The Southern Cross is used as a symbol in many Southern Hemisphere countries and states. It appears on the flags of [[flag of Australia|Australia]], [[flag of Brazil|Brazil]], [[flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[flag of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[flag of Samoa|Samoa]]. 
 
 It was used on the flag flown by miners in [[Ballarat, Victoria]], during the 1854 rebellion known as the [[Eureka Stockade]]. The flag has been used as a symbol of protest in [[Australia]] since then.
