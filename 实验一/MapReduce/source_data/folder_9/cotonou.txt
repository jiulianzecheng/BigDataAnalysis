 '''Cotonou''' is the [[economy]] [[capital (city)|capital]] of [[Benin]]. It is the largest [[city]] in that [[country]]. The city officially has 761,137 people, but it is thought that the actual number of people living in the city may be as high as 1.2 million. Many of the [[government]] and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] [[service]]s of Benin are in Cotonou. Because of this, the city is Benin's [[de facto]] capital, even though the official capital is [[Porto-Novo]]. 
 
 The city is best known as a major [[harbor|port]] because of the [[Autonomous Port of Cotonou]]. It is also home to an [[airport]] and a [[railway]] between it and [[Parakou]]. Other features of Cotonou include [[Cotonou Friendship Stadium]], [[Cotonou Cathedral]], [[Cotonou Central Mosque]] and the 20-[[hectare]] [[Dantokpa Market]]. The [[National University of Benin]] is in Cotonou. 
 
 == History == 
 The name 'Cotonou' means 'the mouth of the [[river]] of [[death]]' in the [[Fon language]]. At the beginning of the [[19th century]], Cotonou (then spelled Kotonou) was a small [[fishing]] [[village]]. The village was a part of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]]. In [[1851]], the [[France|French]] made a [[treaty]] with the Dahomean [[King]] [[Ghezo]]. It let them build a place to [[trade]] at Cotonou. During the [[reign]] of [[Glele]] (1858-89), who ruled after Ghezo, the area was given to France by a treaty signed on [[May 19]], [[1868]]. In [[1883]], the French [[navy]] was at the city to stop the [[United Kingdom|British]] from taking over the area. After Glele's death in 1889, his son [[Behanzin]] tried to [[wikt:challenge|challenge]] the treaty but he failed.
