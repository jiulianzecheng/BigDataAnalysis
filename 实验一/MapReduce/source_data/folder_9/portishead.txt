 '''Portishead''' is a town near the sea in North [[Somerset]], [[England]], where about 21000 people live (Local council update [[July 24]], [[2007]]). 
 
 Portishead has had a history since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. Its name comes from the words ‘port at the head of the river’. < ref name= " somharbours " > {{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |pages=49 }} < /ref >   The town was built on the mouth of a small river; the main road in the town once met the water at the top of the river. 
 
 Lots of buildings in the town are of a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style. 
 
 ==Portishead's dock and railway lines== 
 ===Portishead dock=== 
 
 In the 1860s, in the middle of the iron and steel era, a [[pier]] and a [[dock]] were built for the big boats that could not easily get to [[Bristol]] [[Harbour]]. < ref name = awdry > Awdry < /ref > < ref name = smith > Smith < /ref >  The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries. Many ships carried [[coal]]. < ref name = winter > Winter < /ref > 
 
 In the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation, < ref > [http://visitbristol.co.uk/harbourside/harbourside-history Visit Bristol website] < /ref >  and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed. 
 
 ===Portishead power stations=== 
 The Portishead power stations were coal [[power station]]s built near the dock. The first power station was built in 1926. It began making [[electricity generation|electricity]] in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation. < ref name = winter/ > < ref name = crowhurst > Crowhurst < /ref >  The power station was made bigger in 1948. < ref name = winter/ > 
 
 A 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955. < ref name = winter/ > < ref name = crowhurst/ > 
 
 After 1949, the power stations became part of the country's electricity industry. They used some local coal produced in the [[Somerset coalfield]] which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway. The line had opened on [[12 April]] [[1867]] as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on [[5 July]] [[1879]]. < ref name = awdry/ > 
 
 The 1st power station closed in 1976, and the 2nd closed in 1982. The dock was closed in 1992. 
 
 ===Railway stations=== 
 Portishead had two train stations for people who lived in the town. The main station was near the centre of Portishead, and the other was at the Pier. < ref name = crowhurst/ >  The construction of the 2nd power station caused the 1st train station to be removed and another station was opened in the main street of the town on [[2 January]] [[1954]]. < ref name = crowhurst/ >  The new station closed on [[7 September]] [[1964]]. People who live in Portishead now want the train station to be opened again. < ref > [http://www.portisheadrailwaygroup.org Portishead Railway Group - campaign to reopen the railway < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >
