 A '''clipper''' was a very fast [[sailing ship]] of the [[19th century]].  The word  " clipper "  comes from a word meaning:  " fast " .  Clippers had several [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and a [[square rig]]. They were quite narrow for their length. Clipper ships were mostly made in British and American [[shipyard]]s, but [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and other countries also made some. Clippers sailed all over the world, especially on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and its [[colony|colonies]] in the east, in trans-[[Atlantic]] trade, and the [[New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] route round [[Cape Horn]] during the [[California Gold Rush]].  [[Netherlands|Dutch]] clippers were built beginning in [[1850s]] for bringing [[tea]] to [[Europe]] and taking [[passenger]]s to and from [[Java]].
