A '''Blockchain''' (or '''block chain''') is a series of digital entries, which cannot be easily changed once they are created. It is commonly used in [[cryptocurrency]]. It is how digital transactions are recorded and verified. This is done by using several concepts from [[cryptography]], including [[digital signature]]s and [[hash function]]s. In very basic terms, a blockchain combines the following two ideas: 
 
 # Given some data, it is easy to calculate a [[checksum]] over the data.  Special [[hash function]] < nowiki/ > s can be designed to calculate this [[checksum]]. These functions can be designed to return a value that always has the same length, which is not dependent on the length of the input. This value is called ''hash value'', or ''message digest''. The functions also have another property: Given the same input, they must return the same output (hash value/message digest). 
 # In addition to the hash values, a block typically also contains a timestamp, and some [[payload]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20191016115436/https://www.ambiguousit.com/blockchain-security-is-blockchain-secure-enough-really/ Each block uses a digital signature], which allows detecting any change in the data since the signature was made. When new blocks of data are created, the newly created [[block]] will also contain the hash value of the previous block. < ref name= " cryptocurrencytech " > {{cite book|last1=Narayanan|first1=Arvind|last2=Bonneau|first2=Joseph|last3=Felten|first3=Edward|last4=Miller|first4=Andrew|last5=Goldfeder|first5=Steven|title=Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/bitcoincryptocur0000nara|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-17169-2}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url= https://www.blox.io/ | title= Crypto bookkeeping | access-date= 2020-02-21 | archive-date= 2020-01-29 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200129032802/https://www.blox.io/ | url-status= dead }} Friday, February 21, 2020 < /ref >

 In most cases, a blockchain is managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] [[network]]. All peers use a common [[Communication protocol|protocol]] that specifies how they should communicate with each other, how a new block is created and validated. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed easily any more. Changing the block means all the blocks after it need to be changed as well. Depending on the protocol, this will require a majority of the peers, or even all the peers, to agree. 
 
 Blockchains are secure by design. Blockchain technology is used where keeping a correct record is important.
