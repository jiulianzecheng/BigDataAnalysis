 '''Middlesex''' is one of the [[historic counties of England]] and the second smallest by area. < ref name=census_1831 > {{cite vob| population=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/table_page.jsp?tab_id=GB1831ABS_M%5B1%5D & u_id=10001043 & show=DB & min_c=1 & max_c=5 | name=1831 Census | accessdate=2008-02-20}} < /ref >  The county once contained the rich and politically independent [[City of London]] on its southern boundary. < ref name=rural_old > The Proceedings of the Old Bailey - [http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/history/london-life/rural-middlesex.html Rural Middlesex] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026152503/http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/history/london-life/rural-middlesex.html |date=2007-10-26 }}. Retrieved on 20 February 2008. < /ref >  The county was affected by the expansion of [[London]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. From 1855 the south east was administered as part of London. < ref name=saint > Saint, A., ''Politics and the people of London: the London County Council (1889-1965)'', (1989) < /ref >  When [[county council]]s were initially introduced in England in 1889 around 20% of the area of Middlesex, and a third of its population, was transferred to the [[County of London]]. < ref name=barlow > Barlow, I., ''Metropolitan Government'', (1991) < /ref > 
 
 In the [[Interwar period|interwar years]] urban London further expanded, with the expansion of public transport, < ref name=wolmar > Wolmar, C., ''The Subterranean Railway'', (2004) < /ref >  and the setting up of new industries outside inner London.   
 
 After a [[Royal Commission]] on Local Government in Greater London, Middlesex was absorbed by an enlarged [[Greater London]] in 1965. Despite its disappearance as an administrative county, Middlesex is still used as an area name. It was kept as a postal county; it is an optional component of postal addresses. < ref name=mail > {{Harvnb|Royal Mail|2004|p=9}} < /ref >  It is still regarded by many as a meaningful area, with its own teams in County [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and other sports and pastimes.
