 '''Shusha''' ({{lang-az|Şuşa}}) or '''Shushi''' ({{lang-hy|Շուշի}}) is a city in [[Azerbaijan]]. The city is a major centre of Azerbaijani culture and music. 
 
 == History ==  
 Shusha was founded in 1750-1752 by Panah-Ali khan Javanshir (r. 1748-1763), the founder and the first ruler of the Karabakh Khanate (Qarabağ xanlığı - in Azerbaijani). The first capital of the Karabakh khanate was the castle of Bayat, built in 1748 in the district of Kebirli. However, soon afterwards Panah Ali khan realized that in order to secure himself and his newly established khanate from external threats, he needed to build a new more reliable castle. Shusha was turned into the capital of the [[Karabakh khanate]]. 
 
 Shusha was a popular mountainous-climatic recreation resort in Azerbaijan. 
 
 On May 8, 1992, the city was captured by the Armenian forces and all of the city's predominantly [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] population was either expelled or killed. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.azernews.az/nation/53497.html | title=Shusha: 21 years under Armenian occupation | date=8 May 2013 }} < /ref >  It was recaptured by Azerbaijan on 8 November, 2020 during the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war]], with the city's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population fleeing beforehand. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20201108-azerbaijan-liberates-karabakhs-second-largest-city-occupied-by-armenia/ | title=Azerbaijan liberates Karabakh's second-largest city occupied by Armenia | date=8 November 2020 }} < /ref >
