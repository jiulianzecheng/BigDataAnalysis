 '''Pannotia''' (also called Greater Gondwanaland or the Vendian supercontinent) is a [[Neoproterozoic]] [[supercontinent]]. It may have existed during the [[Ediacaran]] period (~600 [[mya]]), to the end of the [[Precambrian]] (about 541 mya). After that, it split into smaller continents. The small ones were [[Laurentia]], [[Siberia]] and [[Eastern Europe|Baltica]], with the main [[landmass]] [[Gondwana]] south of them. < ref name= " palaeos " > {{cite web | url = http://www.palaeos.com/Earth/Geography/Pannotia.html | title = Pannotia | work = Palaeos | accessdate = 2013-05-12 | archive-date = 2006-03-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060313171408/http://www.palaeos.com/Earth/Geography/Pannotia.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Lifespan == 
 About 750 million years ago the older supercontinent [[Rodinia]] split apart into three continents. These were earlier forms of [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]], and the [[continent]]al [[craton]] of [[Congo]]. About 600 milion years ago, they formed Pannotia. 
 
 Pannotia did not last for long. The collisions that formed Pannotia were brief collisions, and the continents making up Pannotia already had active [[rift (geology)|rifting]]. By about 550 million years ago, Pannotia separated into four continents. This means it only lasted for about 50 million years. Later the four landmasses would combine again to form the next supercontinent, [[Pangaea]]. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://evolution.berkeley.edu/glossary_entry/glossary.php?word=Pannotia | title = Pannotia | work = UCMP Glossary | accessdate = 2013-05-12 | archive-date = 2012-02-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040911/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/glossary_entry/glossary.php?word=Pannotia | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
