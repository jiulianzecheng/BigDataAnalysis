 == Creation legend == 
 The [[legend]] is that one day two [[hunter]]s were chasing a wild [[boar]]. It was finally hit, but with two [[spear]]s, one from each of the hunters. They could not decide who threw the spear that caused the boar to die. The boar finally broke down exactly at the border between [[Seßlach]] and Ebern, with its head in Ebern, and its body in Seßlach, so they divided it. That is why the [[town]] Ebern is named after the boar, and the town's [[flag]] carries the [[head]] of the boar.
