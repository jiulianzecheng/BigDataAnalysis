 [[File:Liverwort life cycle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverwort]]s are a kind of small plant with a complex [[life cycle]] that includes fertilization. The sperm and the egg come together to make a [[zygote]]. The zygote grows into an [[embryo]].]] 
 
 '''Fertilization''' ([[British English]] spelling: '''fertilisation''') is when a male's [[sperm]] enters a female's [[ovum]] (or  " [[Egg (biology)|egg]] " ). Fertilization is also called ''conception''. [[Biologist]]s call a fertilized egg a [[zygote]]. A zygote grows into an [[embryo]]. 
 
 Fertilization occurs in [[animal]]s, including humans and birds, in [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, in fact all [[eukaryote]]s. Fertilization makes a cell with twice as many [[chromosome]]s. The eukaryote [[life cycle]] includes [[meiosis]] which divides the chromosome number in half. 
 
 ==In animals== 
 In animals, there are two types of fertilization, internal and external. Internal fertilization happens in the female body. External fertilization happens outside of the body. Mammals, birds, and reptiles use internal fertilization. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Pradhan|first1=Sarala|last2=Bespalova|first2=Ioulia|date=2019-07-16|title=Internal Fertilization|url=https://askabiologist.asu.edu/internal-fertilization|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-01-15|website=askabiologist.asu.edu|language=en}} < /ref >  Amphibians and most fish use external fertilization. Some animals with internal fertilization give [[birth]] to live offspring. Others such as birds, most reptiles, and some mammals such as the [[Platypus]], lay eggs. 
 
 Internal fertilization happens during [[mating]] ([[sexual intercourse]] in humans). Sperm cells travel from the male testicles to the female uterus. One sperm attaches to the egg in the uterus. Together, they become a zygote.

 File:Stony coral spawning 2.jpg|[[Coral]] animals send eggs and sperm into the water separately. They are carried in the water [[Ocean current|currents]] and meet up to fertilize, and then grow into new coral animals. 
 File:Albino Cory Spawning.JPG|Most fish fertilize their eggs externally. The eggs and sperm are put into the water at the same time. (Here the sperm are not visible.) 
 File:AmselEier.jpg|Bird eggs are usually fertilized before they are laid. (In some birds and reptiles an unfertilized egg can still be laid, but it will never hatch.)
