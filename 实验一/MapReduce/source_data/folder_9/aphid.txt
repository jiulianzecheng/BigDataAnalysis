 '''Aphids''' are small [[insect|bug]]s which feed on [[plant]]s. Aphids cause more plant damage than any other insects. < ref > George C. McGavin 1993. ''Bugs of the world''. Infobase Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8160-2737-4}} < /ref >  There are over 4,000 different [[species]] of aphid. 
 
 About 250 species are serious [[pest]]s for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] as well as an annoyance for [[gardener]]s. They vary in size from 1-10 & nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]] long. 
 
 Important natural enemies include the predatory [[Coccinellidae|lady beetles]] ([[Coleoptera]]: [[Coccinellidae]]), [[hoverfly]] [[larvae]], lacewings ([[Neuroptera]]),  larvae of the aphid [[midge]] ''Aphidoletes aphidimyza'', [[crab spider]]s, and insect-eating fungi like ''Lecanicillium lecanii''. 
 
 Aphids are found many places on earth. Aphids are most common in [[temperate zone]]s. 
 Aphids can travel far in the air. For example, the [[lettuce aphid]] spread from [[New Zealand]] to [[Tasmania]]. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2005/s1493620.htm|date=October 30, 2005|title=Landline: Scientist battles lettuce aphid.|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corp|access-date=January 1, 2007}} < /ref >   They have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials.
