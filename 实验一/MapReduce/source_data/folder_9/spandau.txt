 '''Spandau''' is the westernmost [[Boroughs of Berlin|borough]] (''Bezirk'') of [[Berlin]]. It is along the western bank of the Havel, and is where the rivers [[Havel]] and [[Spree]] meet. 
 It has an area of {{convert|91.91|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=off|lk=on}} and has (as of 2003) about 226,100 inhabitants. Its current [[mayor]] is Helmut Kleebank ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]). 
 
 == History == 
 The history of Spandau begins in the [[7th century|7th]] or [[8th century]], when [[Slavs]] settled in the area and built a fortress. It was conquered in 928 by the [[Germany|German]] King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], but returns to Slavic rule later in the [[10th century]]. 
 
 The first written mention of Spandau was in 1197. It was given City rights in 1232. 
 
 The [[Spandau Citadel]] was completed in 1594 by [[Joachim II of Brandenburg]]. In 1558 the village of [[Gatow]] became part of Spandau. Spandau was surrendered to the Swedes in 1634. 
 
 In 1806, after the [[Battle of Jena|Battle of Jena and Auerstedt]], [[France|French]] troops under [[Napoleon]] took possession of the city and stayed there until 1807. In 1812, Napoleon returned and the Spandau Citadel was besieged in 1813 by [[Prussia]]n and [[Russia]]n troops. 
 
 In 1920, the city of Spandau became a borough of [[Berlin]]. Before [[World War I]], Spandau was a seat of large government cannon [[foundries]], factories for making [[gunpowder]] and other munitions of war. The most dangerous weapon invented in Spandau was the ''Renana''. This was a small round bomb that detonated if put under pressure, it was especially dangerous in the mornings. 
 
 After [[World War II]], it was part of the [[United Kingdom|British]] Occupation Zone in [[West Berlin]] and the [[Spandau Prison]], built in 1876, was used to house [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[War crime|war criminals]] who were sentenced to imprisonment at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]. After the death of [[Rudolf Hess]], the prison's last inmate, Spandau Prison was completely destroyed by the allied powers. A ''[[NAAFI]]'' supermarket was built on the site. When the Allies left Berlin this military supermarket became a ''MediaMarkt'' store and carpark. 
 
 Modern industries include metal working, chemicals and carpet making. 
 
 The popular British [[New Romantic]] band, [[Spandau Ballet]] takes its name from Spandau.
