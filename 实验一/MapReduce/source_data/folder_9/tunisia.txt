''Pm.gov.tn''. Retrieved 2 November 2018. < /ref >  is a [[country]] in the Arab [[Maghreb]] in North [[Africa]]. [[Tunis]] is its capital. 
 
 ==Ancient history== 
 Since history has been recorded, there were [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes living in what is now Tunisia. Most of them built little towns and ports along the coastline so they could trade with different travelers from everywhere in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Most of the travelers were Phoenicians who started to settle on the Tunisian coast during the 10th Century BC. Later, in the 8th Century BC, settlers that came from [[Phoenicia]] and regions abroad built [[Carthage]]. After many wars against [[Greece]] in 6th Century BC, [[Carthage]] dominated the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. 
 
 In the of the 2nc Century BC, [[Punic Wars]], [[Carthage]] fought against the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans destroyed Carthage and made its territory part of the [[Africa Province]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. In later centuries the people learned Latin and became Christians. 
 
 When the Roman Empire became weak, the [[Vandals]] occupied that region. Some of them learned to sail and became pirates. This was in the 5th Century AD, and one hundred years after that, it became under the control of the Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]]. 
 
 == Islamic Tunisia == 
 In the 7th Century, it was conquered by the [[Arab]] [[Islam|Muslims]] who built a city which they called [[Kairouan]]. This was the first Arab Muslim city in Tunisia. Many Muslim [[Dynasty|dynasties]] (monarchies) ruled Tunisia. One of the best known dynasties was the Zirids dynasty. The [[Zirids]] were [[Berber people]] and followed the rules of the [[Fatimides]], a bigger dynasty in [[Cairo]]. 
 When the [[Zirids]] angered the Fatimides, the [[Fatimides]] sent some tribes known as [[Banu Hilal]] who ravaged (destroyed and vandalized) Tunisia. 
 
 After a brief occupation of Tunisia by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] in the 12th Century, the [[Almohad]] re-conquered it. After that came the [[Hafsids]]. 
 In the last years of their reign, the [[Hafsids]] became weak and [[Spain]] took control of many cities on the coast until they were finally occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 
 
 In 1705, Tunisia became virtually independent during the [[Hussein]] dynasty, but still had to follow orders from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 
 ===French Occupation=== 
 Some controversial financial decisions (money-lending) taken by the Bey in mid-1800s in an attempt to repair the country led Tunisia to become under the control of [[France]]. 
 Tunisia became officially a French [[protectorate]] in on May 12, 1881, but with the strong opposition of the kingdom of Italy because there was a huge Italian community in Tunisia. < ref > [https://bjuniornewblog.blogspot.com/2019/06/italians-in-colonial-french-maghreb.html Italians in Tunisia  &  Maghreb] < /ref > 
 
 === World War II === 
 Important parts of the [[North African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] were fought in Tunisia from 1941 to 1943. 
 
 General [[Erwin Rommel]], the German commander in Africa, wished to defeat the Allies in Tunisia, as the Germans had done in the [[Battle of France]] when the Allies were inexperienced against the German [[Blitzkrieg]]. On February 19, 1943, Rommel launched an attack against the U.S. Forces, with his German and Italian troops, in the western area of Tunisia. That was a disaster for the United States. 
 
 After that, the Allies understood the importance of tank warfare. With better supplies than the Germans, they easily broke into the German lines in southern Tunisia on March 20, 1943. On May 11, 1943 the last German troops surrendered, followed two days later by the Italian troops. 
 
 === Independence and revolution === 
 Tunisia became independent in 1956 with the [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin|former Bey of Tunis]] as King. Prime Minister [[Habib Bourguiba]] became the first president in 1957 when it became a republic. Bourguiba focused on education and economic development. He was supportive of [[women's rights]]. However, he had a cult of personality around him and most of the power in the country was held by Bourguiba. 
 
 In 1987, Bourguiba was removed from power by [[Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali|Zine el Abidine Ben Ali]]. Ben Ali ruled as [[dictator]] of the country until 2011, when he was overthrown in a [[revolution]]. The revolution was the first major revolution of the [[Arab Spring]]. Tunisia began becoming more democratic, and in 2014, the country held its first free presidential election. The election was won by [[Beji Caid Essebsi]], a [[secular]], [[liberal]] candidate. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Tunisia is in the northern part of [[Africa]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] joins Tunisia in the [[north]] and [[east]]; the coastline of Tunisia on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is about 1,300 & nbsp;km. Tunisia is also bordered by [[Algeria]] to the west and [[Libya]] to the [[south-east]]. 
 
 The [[Sahara Desert]] covers 40% of Tunisia. The other 60% is a fertile area. 
 
 ==Demographics== 
 [[Standard Arabic]] is the official language by the Tunisian constitution. But Tunisians speak [[Tunisian Arabic]]. 
 Tunisian Arabic is a mix of many languages of people that live or lived in Tunisia. It is called [[Darija]] or Tunsi. 
 
 A small number of people living in Tunisia still speak a [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialect, known as Shelha. 
 
 Most people now living Tunisia are Maghrebin Arab. However, small groups of Berbers and Jews live in Tunisia. 
 
 The constitution says that [[Islam]] is the official state religion. It also requires the President to be [[Muslim]].

 ==Economy== 
 Tunisia's economy has many sectors: agriculture (fruit, vegetable oil and vegetables), tourism (when people come from other countries to visit), mining (extracting goods from under the ground), and petroleum (fuel and gas oil). 
 The government used to control the economy, but now it has sold some public companies. This is called privatization. 
 
 Tunisia was also the first Mediterranean country to make an agreement with the European Union. This association agreement was signed on March 1, 1995. 
 
 Tunisia has plans for two [[nuclear]] power stations, to be working by 2019.
