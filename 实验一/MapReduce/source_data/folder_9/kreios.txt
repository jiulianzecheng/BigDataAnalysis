 '''Crius''' or '''Krios''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Κρεῖος or Κριός) is one of the Twelve [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and [[Uranos|Ouranos]]. The Titan god of the constellations, Krios ruled over the southern corner of the world, which he received as a reward for his part in [[Uranos|Ouranos’]] castration (he held down one of Ouranos’ arms). Like his brothers, Krios was cast into [[Tartaros|Tartarus]] at the end of the Titanomachy. His wife was the minor goddess [[Eurybia (mythology)|Eurybia]], daughter of [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] and Gaia, with whom he sired [[Astraeus]], [[Pallas]], and [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]].
