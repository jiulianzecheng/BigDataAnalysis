 The '''Seine''' is a [[river]] in [[France]]. It flows into the [[English Channel]] between [[Le Havre]] and [[Honfleur]]. It is {{convert|777| km|abbr=off}} long. < ref name= " Sandre " > {{cite web|url=http://services.sandre.eaufrance.fr/Courdo/Fiche/client/fiche_courdo.php?CdSandre=----0010|title=Sandre, information on the River Seine}} < /ref >  It is the second-longest river in France. Other important cities along its course are [[Paris]], [[Troyes]] and [[Rouen]]. Its [[drainage basin]] has a surface of {{convert|78650|km|2|abbr=off}}. The Seine starts in [[Source-Seine]], in [[Côte-d'Or]], [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]], at an height of {{convert|444|m|abbr=off}}. The unidntified body of [[L'incounne de la Seine]] (English: The Unidentified Woman of Seine) was discovered there {{circa}} 1885. 
 
 ==Navigation== 
 
 Between Rouen and the sea, ocean-going vessels of up to {{convert|280|m|abbr=off}} in length, and 150,000 tons in weight can travel the Seine. This section of the river has a length of about {{convert|120|km|abbr=off}}. Ships of a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of up to {{convert|10|m|abbr=off}} can circulate. Draft is a word describe the height of the part of a ship that is below the water line. There are three bridges in this section. They can be raised. The maximum [[air draft]] (or height above the water line) of a ship is {{convert|50|m|abbr=off}}. Because there are few briges, the river can be crossed by [[ferry]], at different locations. The [[port]] of Rouen is an important [[maritime]] port in France; it is the most important port in Europe for [[cereals]], and the most important port in France for [[flour]] and [[fertilizer]]s. Even if the port of Le Havre is more important for [[petroleum]], that of Rouen is still important. About 25 million tons of produce is handled by the port of Rouen each year.

 The course of the river was corrected between Rouen and Paris in the 19th century. There are seven [[Lock (water transport)|locks]]. Barges with merchandise, of a capacity of up to 350 t, can circulate. The dimension of the lock determines the maximum dimension of the ship. When most [[canal]]s were built in France, the minister for public works, [[Charles de Freycinet]] determined the maximum length of the locks. As a result, the maximum dimension of the ship is {{convert|38.5|by|5.05|m|abbr=off}}, with a draft of {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=off}}. In the case of the French canals, the maximum draft is {{convert|1.8|m|abbr=off}}. The load of a peniche is about that of ten [[lorry|lorries]] or eight [[rail wagon]]s.  Other ship types that can circulate have a capacity of {{convert|800|to|1350|t|abbr=off}}. Convois of [[barge]]s with a length between {{convert|40|and|70|m|abbr=off}} can transport between {{convert|3000|and|10000|t|abbr=off}} of freight. Other ships include river-vessels that can transport up to {{convert|4000|t|abbr=off}} of freight. 
 
 The port of Paris is the most important fluvial port in France: About 20.2 million tons of merchanise are handled each year, 20 miilon  tons of this merchandise come from fluvial transport.  There is a project called [[Seine–Nord Europe Canal]], to build a high-capacity canal to connect the Paris region to the Ports of [[Antwerp]], [[Dunkerque]] and [[Rotterdam]], for large ships of {{convert|11.5|m|abbr=off}} width and {{convert|185|m|abbr=off}} length. 
 
 ==Floods== 
 Different [[flood]]s of the river have been reported. The oldest report is from [[Julian (emperor)|Emperor Julian]] who reported a flood of the river in his work [[Misopogon]] in the year 358. [[Gregory of Tours]] reported a flood in February 528 in his [[Historia Francorum]].

 The river has inspired different painters, mainly in the 19th and 20th century. [[Honoré de Balzac]] describes it in many of his books. [[Gustave Flaubert]] uses the river as a [[metaphor]] or image to describe the flow of time. Other authors include [[Jacques Prévert]], and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]].
