The word comes from the two Japanese words {{nihongo|''momiji''|紅葉}} meaning  " red leaves "  or  " [[maple]] tree "  and {{nihongo|''kari''|狩り}},  " hunting " .  It is also called {{nihongo|'''kōyō'''|紅葉}}. < ref > [http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2014.html Autumn leaves (koyo) in Japan] at japan-guide.com. < /ref >   " Kōyō "  is another [[Kanji#Readings|pronunciation]] of the characters for  " momiji " . In [[Hokkaidō]] another word for it is {{nihongo|'''kanpūkai'''|観楓会}}. 
 
 Many people in Japan do this. The cities of Nikkō, [[Tochigi]] and [[Kyoto]] are very popular. The tradition started in the [[History of Japan|Heian]] era.
