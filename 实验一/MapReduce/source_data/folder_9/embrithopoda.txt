 '''Embrithopoda''' ( " heavy-footed " ) is an order of extinct mammals known from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. 
 
 == Overview == 
 
 Most of the embrithopod genera are known exclusively from jaws and teeth dated from the late Paleocene to the late Eocene; however, the order is best known from its terminal member, the elephantine Arsinoitherium.
