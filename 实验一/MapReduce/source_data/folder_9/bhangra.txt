 Bhangra became popular in Britain in the 1980s and the artists of Bhangra were selling over 30,000 [[Audio cassette|cassettes]] a week in the UK even though not one of the artists made their way into the Top 40 UK Chart. Bhangra is also popular in [[Canada]] where singer, Jazzy B sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, Folk and Funky and became one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world.  
 
 The outfits for Bhangra are Turla or torla, ''Pag'', which is a turban that is a sign of pride/honor in Punjab and is tied differently than the traditional turbans that the Sikhs and other people wear on the street, ''Kurta'' which is a silk shirt, with about four buttons and is very loose with embroidered patterns, ''Lungi'' or chadar which is a loose loincloth tied around the dancer's waist, ''Jugi'' which is a waistcoat with no buttons, and ''RumƒÅl'' which are small scarves that are worn tied on to the fingers.
