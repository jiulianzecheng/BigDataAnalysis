 '''Electrecord''' is a [[Romania]]n [[record label]] that started in 1932. It was the only record label in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]] because their government believed in [[centralism|centralization]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Image:ElectrecordSideB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Early Electrecord disc]] 
 
 ===Communist Romania=== 
 Electrecord was often told to make some recordings in Romania instead of importing them from [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]], which recording companies in the [[Soviet Union]] were doing. Many stories today say recordings made in Romania are worse due to their lower quality.{{cn|date=January 2013}} 
 
 Electrecord had to make the government, listeners and musicians happy. Electrecord released some collection discs. The most successful ones were the ''[[Formaţii de muzică pop]]'' (pop music bands) series, named ''Formaţii rock'' (rock bands) starting with the fourth one. The government did not like the word  " rock "  for a kind of music. 
 
 ====After==== 
 Electrecord became less popular from 1990 because there were other record companies in Romania. Some artists stayed. Most discs released by Electrecord since 1990 have been greatest hits albums or [[remaster|remastered]] versions of [[LP record|LPs]]. 
 
 Electrecord released the album ''Songbird'' by pop singer-songwriter NAVI in June 2017. < ref name= " official " > {{cite web |title=NAVI releases her debut album,  " Songbird "  |url=http://www.navisongs.com/navi/navi-releases-her-debut-album-songbird/ |website=NAVI |access-date=5 October 2018 |date=17 June 2017 |archive-date=5 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005072130/http://www.navisongs.com/navi/navi-releases-her-debut-album-songbird/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
