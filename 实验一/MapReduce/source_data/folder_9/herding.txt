 '''Herding''' is the act of bringing individual animals together into a group ([[herd]]). It is maintaining the group and moving the group from place to place. Many thousands of years ago herding became a way of life for many [[nomadic people]]. Today it is still a necessity for [[farmer]]s, [[ranch]]ers and those who raise [[Domestication|domestic animals]]. 
 
 == Herds == 
 Some animals [[instinct]]ively gather together as a herd. A group of animals fleeing a [[predator]] will herd together for [[Wikt:protection|protection]]. Some predators, such as [[Wolf|wolves]] and [[dog]]s, have instinctive herding abilities that come from primitive hunting instincts. But there can be a fine line between chasing and herding. < ref name=Albright > Mary Ann Albright.  " Herding skills unleashed. "  The Columbian (Vancouver, WA).

 Herding is used in agriculture to manage domesticated animals. Herding can be performed by people or dogs trained to control the movement of livestock under the direction of a person. < ref > William Haviland, et al., ''Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge'' (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, 2011), pp. 166â€“168 < /ref >  Animals such as [[cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s are commonly herded by humans and dogs. Also herd dogs may be used to gather and herd [[turkey]], [[geese]], [[duck]]s and [[chicken]]s. < ref > Mary Ann Hoffman, ''Herding Dogs'' (New York: Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2011), p. 5 < /ref > 
 
 == Herd dogs == 
 Originally dogs were used to both herd and [[Guard dog|guard]] domestic animals. < ref name=Grandin200 > ''Livestock Handling and Transport'', ed. Temple Grandin (Wallingford: CABI, 2007), p. 200 < /ref >  Over time dogs were bred to specialize in one or the other. Herd guardians or guard dogs became the 24-hour protector of the flock. < ref name=Grandin200/ >  Herd dogs were developed to keep the herd together. Herding dogs are critical to [[Australian]] and [[British]] sheep farms. < ref name=Grandin200/ >
