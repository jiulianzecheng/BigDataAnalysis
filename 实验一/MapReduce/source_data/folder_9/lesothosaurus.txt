 '''''Lesothosaurus''''' was a small, early, lightly-built [[dinosaur]]. It was an herbivore (plant-eater) and a fast, agile runner. It was small and [[lizard]]-like, about 3 feet (1 m) long. It walked on two long legs, had four-toed feet, five-fingered hands, short arms, a long pointed tail, a flexible neck, and a small head. Its head was short and flat with large eyes. It had sharp, pointed front teeth and arrow-like cheek teeth, but its lower jaw ended in toothless bone.  
 
 The place of this species within the [[Ornithischia]] is controversial. It is probably an [[ornithopod]]. < ref name=BUN08 > {{cite journal |title=The phylogeny of the ornithischian dinosaurs|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=1–40 |doi=10.1017/S1477201907002271|s2cid=86728076 |last1=Butler |first1=Richard J. |last2=Upchurch |first2=Paul |last3=Norman |first3=David B. }} < /ref > < ref name=FKetal09 > {{cite journal |year=2009 |title=Ontogenetic change and adult body size of the early ornithischian dinosaur ''Lesothosaurus diagnosticus'': implications for basal ornithischian taxonomy |series=online |journal=Gondwana Research |volume=preprint |doi=10.1016/j.gr.2009.03.010 |issue=1 |pages=171–179|last1=Knoll |first1=Fabien |last2=Padian |first2=Kevin |last3=De Ricqlès |first3=Armand }} < /ref > < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall|location=London|page= 134|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >
