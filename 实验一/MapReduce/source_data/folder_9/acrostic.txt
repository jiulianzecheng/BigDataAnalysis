An '''acrostic''' is a [[poetry|poem]] or other form of writing. In an acrostic, the first letter, [[syllable]], or word of every line, paragraph, or other feature spells out a word or a message. It can be used to remember things. For example, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote an acrostic poem in English: < ref name=eapoeacrostic > {{cite web

 < poem style= " margin-left: 2em " > 
 '''E'''lizabeth it is in vain you say 
 " '''L'''ove not "  — thou sayest it in so sweet a way: 
 '''I'''n vain those words from thee or L.E.L. 
 '''Z'''antippe's talents had enforced so well: 
 '''A'''h! if that language from thy heart arise, 
 '''B'''reath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes. 
 '''E'''ndymion, recollect, when Luna tried 
 '''T'''o cure his love — was cured of all beside — 
 '''H'''is follie — pride — and passion — for he died.
