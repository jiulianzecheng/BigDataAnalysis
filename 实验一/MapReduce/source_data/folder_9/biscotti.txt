 Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, ''biscotti di [[Prato]]'', in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name  " cantuccini " . These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in [[Tuscany]], but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of [[Yeast|yeasts]], acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with [[olive oil]] and [[Anise|anise seeds]]. 
 
 The confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of  " Biscottificio Antonio Mattei, "  the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop:  " Manufacturers of cantuccini, "  which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits.
