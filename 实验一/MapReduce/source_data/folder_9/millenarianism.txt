'''Millenarianism''' is an idea in some religious communities, which refer to a passage in the [[bible]], which says that [[Jesus]] will return to earth an establish an [[empire]] that will last at least thousand years. Several [[Christianity|Christian]] groups say that this will soon happen, and that the world as we know it is about to change.
