 '''Leukemia''' or '''leukaemia''' is a [[cancer]] of [[white blood cells]] and [[bone marrow]]. When a person has leukemia, the body creates too many [[white blood cells]] (''leukocytes''). 
 
 There are many kinds of leukemia. Leukemia is part of a bigger group of diseases, the [[blood cancer]]s (hematological neoplasms).  Without treatment, leukemia may lead to death within weeks, months, or years. The life of the person depends upon the type of leukemia. 
 
 In 2000, about 256,000 children and adults around the world developed some form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates_country/en/index.html|title=WHO Disease and injury country estimates|year=2009|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=2009-11-11}} < /ref >   About 90% of all leukemias are seen in adults. < ref > {{cite web| url = http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/leuks.html#incidence-mortality| title = SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Leukemia| year = 2011| publisher = National Cancer Institute| quote =  " Approximately 10.8% were diagnosed under age 20 "  }} < /ref > 
 
 == Four major types of leukemia == 
 Leukemia can be either [[acute (medicine)|''acute'']] or ''[[chronic]]''.  Acute leukemia usually grows quickly.  Chronic leukemia grows slowly. 
 
 Leukemia can also affect two different types of white blood cells. These are [[lymphocyte|lymphoid cells]] and young [[granulocyte]] cells (which are called ''myelocytes''). 
 
 For this reason, all of the different forms of leukemia are divided into four main types: 
 * Acute lymphocytic leukemia ('''ALL''') is the most common type of leukemia. It is common in young children but can also be seen in old people. 
 * Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ('''CLL''') is usually seen in people over the age of 55. Children almost never have this. 
 * Acute myelogenous leukemia ('''AML''') is seen more commonly in adults than in children. 
 * Chronic myelogenous leukemia ('''CML''') happens mostly in adults. 
 
 == Causes and risk factors == 
 The causes of most types of leukemia are not known. In general, all cancers have a breakdown in the normal way [[cell division]] is controlled. Most likely, the different kinds of leukemias have different causes. The known causes account for relatively few cases. < ref name= " pmid12163333 " > {{cite journal

 Researchers believe that some things may influence whether a person develops leukemia: 
 * Exposure to [[Ionizing radiation]] 
 * Exposure to certain [[chemical substance|chemicals]], for example [[benzene]]. 
 * Certain [[virus]]es 
 * Treatment with certain drugs that influence how cells develop; e.g. treatment of a [[tumor]]; [[Chemotherapy]] 
 * Certain [[Genetics|genetic]] factors. 
 
 Viruses that are believed to cause leukemia include: 
 * [[Human immunodeficiency virus]] or HIV 
 * [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] 
 
 [[Fanconi anemia]] is also a [[risk factor]] for developing acute myelogenous leukemia. 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 Most cases of leukemia are treated with many drugs, which are usually combined into a [[chemotherapy]] program. In some cases, [[Radiation therapy|radiation therapies]] or bone marrow transplants are done. 
 
 == Leukemia inhibitory factor == 
 '''Leukemia inhibitory factor''', or '''LIF''', is an interleukin 6 class cytokin. It affects [[cell growth]] by inhibiting [[cell differentiation|differentiation]]. When LIF levels drop, the cells differentiate.
