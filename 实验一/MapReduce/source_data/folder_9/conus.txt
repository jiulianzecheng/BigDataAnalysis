 '''''Conus''''' is a large [[genus]] of small to large [[predatory]] [[sea snail]]s, [[Marine biology|marine]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc]]s, with the common names of ''cone snails'', ''cone shells'' or ''cones''. 
 
 Shaped, as the name suggests, like a [[wikt:cone|cone]], many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. ''Conus'' snails are mostly [[tropical]] in distribution. Geologically speaking, the genus is known from the [[Eocene]] to the present. < ref > {{in lang|cs}} Pek I. ''et al'' 1996. ''Základy zoopaleontologie''. Olomouc. {{ISBN|80-7067-599-3}} < /ref > 
 
 All ''Conus'' snails are [[venom]]ous. They hunt and eat marine worms or [[molluscs]]. The larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish. Cone snails use a [[hypodermic]]-like modified [[radula]] tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their [[prey]] before eating it. The tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a [[harpoon]]. It is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail, at the end of the [[proboscis]]. They can  " sting "  humans, and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all. 
 
 Cone snail [[venom]]s are mainly [[peptide]]s. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of some larger species can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. < ref > [http://dermnetnz.org/reactions/marine.html Marine wounds and stings] < /ref >  Cone snail venom may be a source of new, medically important substances. < ref name= " pmid17932414 " > {{cite journal| author=Olivera BM, Teichert RW| title=Diversity of the neurotoxic Conus peptides: a model for concerted pharmacological discovery | journal=Molecular Interventions | year= 2007 | volume= 7 | issue= 5 | pages= 251–60 | pmid=17932414 | doi=10.1124/mi.7.5.7 | pmc= | url=http://triggered.edina.clockss.org/ServeContent?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmolinterv.aspetjournals.org%2Fcontent%2F7%2F5%2F251.full}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |title=Nature's brew |date=2008 |author=Roger Van Oosten |url=http://www.fhcrc.org/about/pubs/quest/articles/2008/09/natures_brew.html |work=Quest online}} < /ref >   
 
 Some Cone snails are no longer living, like [[Conus adversarius]].
