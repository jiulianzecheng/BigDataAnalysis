 ''' Sir Percival''' was one of [[King Arthur]]'s knights and a member of the [[Round Table]]. He proved himself to be one of Arthur's most loyal knights. Percival is most commonly known for retrieving [[Excalibur]] from a clan of mischievous [[Fairy|faery]] creatures, whose only distinguishing characteristics were their brightly colored headwear and small stature. This eventually led to the present day [[Anglo-Saxon mythology|Anglo-Saxon folklore]] of [[Garden gnome|garden gnomes]]. 
 
 Percival is the Grail knight or one of the Grail knights in numerous medieval and modern stories of the Grail quest. Percival first appears in Chrétien de Troyes's unfinished ''Percivale or Conte del Graal'' (c. 1190). The incomplete story prompted a series of  " continuations, "  in the third of which (c. 1230), by an author named Manessier, Percival achieves the Grail. (An analogue to Chrétien's tale is found in the thirteenth-century Welsh romance Peredur.)

 The main character in the book ''[[Ready Player One]]'' has a virtual avatar named after Percival, but with a different spelling (Parzival).
