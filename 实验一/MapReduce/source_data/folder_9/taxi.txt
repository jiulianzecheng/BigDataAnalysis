 A '''taxi''' ('''taxicab''' or '''cab''' in the [[United States]]) is a [[car]], or other [[vehicle]] which is used for [[public transport]]. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big [[city|cities]] have taxis. 
 
 In most other types of public transport, such as a [[bus]], [[tram]], or [[train]], the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain [[road]]s or follow a very specific [[route]]. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go. 
 
 Riding a taxi is a lot like a person having their own car, but don't [[driving|drive]] it. They only tell the taxi [[driver]] where they want to go and he or she will take you there. How much they pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far they are going from where you get on. It is common for the [[price]] for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport. 
 
 ==History==

 The first taxi-type system started in [[Paris]] and [[London]] in the early [[1600s|17th century]]. These were carts pulled by ([[carriage]]s) and could be hired. The [[monarchy|monarchies]] that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the [[1800s|19th century]], [[Hansom cab]]s were mostly used because of their higher level of safety. 
 
 == Taximeter == 
 The 1891 invention by [[Germany|German]] [[Wilhelm Bruhn]] of the [[taximeter]] helped establish the modern taxi. The first modern meter-equipped taxicab was the [[Daimler Victoria]], built by [[Gottlieb Daimler]] in 1897. The first motorized taxi company began operating in [[Stuttgart]] the same year. 
 
 The term ''taximeter'' is an adaptation of the [[French language|French]] word 'taximètre', and the [[German Language|German]] word 'taxameter'. It means measuring a [[tax]] or [[fee]]. < ref name= " London taxi " > {{cite web|title=History of the Licensed London Taxi|url=http://www.london-taxi-cabs.com/information/history-of-the-licensed-london-taxi|publisher=london-taxi-cabs.com|accessdate=22 April 2015|archive-date=29 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429042550/http://www.london-taxi-cabs.com/information/history-of-the-licensed-london-taxi|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{citation |chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56562 |title=Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642–1660 |chapter=June 1654: An Ordinance for the Regulation of Hackney-Coachmen in London and the places adjacent |editor-first=C.H. |editor-last=Firth |editor-first2=R.S. |editor-last2=Rait |location=London |year=1911 |pages=922–924 |publisher=British History Online |accessdate=22 April 2015 |archive-date=5 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805064837/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56562 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://blog.francetvinfo.fr/deja-vu/2015/06/14/les-taxis-378-ans-dhistoires-et-dengueulades.html|title=Les taxis : 378 ans d'histoires et d'engueulades|date=14 June 2015|publisher=}} < /ref >
