 {{main|Kurukshetra War}} 
 
 Arjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord [[Hanuman]] stayed on Arjuna's chariot flag. 
 
 Some of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows: 
 * '''Fall of Bhishma''': According to original Mahabharat, Arjuna fairly killed [[Bhishma]] on 10th day of the Kurukshetra war by placing an enunch before Bhisma.

 * '''Death of Bhagadatta''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed [[Bhagadatta]]- the mighty warrior and the  King of [[Pragjyotisha]] kingdom. 
 
 * '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna came to know that [[Jayadratha]] blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including [[Karna]], [[Drona]], [[Kripa]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and killed [[Jayadratha]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=sacred-texts.com|access-date=19 January 2018}} < /ref >  Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up. So, Arjuna beheaded Jayadratha with an arrow that carried his head to the lap of his father, who was awoken from his meditation and ended up dropping the head to the ground, thus resulting in the explosion of his own head. < ref name= " test169 " > [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07142.htm Kisori Mohan Ganguly translation of Mahabharat P-321] Drona Parv, Chapter 146 < /ref > {{Clear}}

 * '''Killing Vrishasena''': Arjuna killed [[Vrishasena]] on 17th day of war.
