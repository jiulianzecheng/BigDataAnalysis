 '''Trichomoniasis''' (often called '''trich''') is a [[sexually transmitted disease]].  It is caused by a [[parasite]] called ''Trichomonas vaginalis'', which is a [[protozoa]] made of just one [[cell]]. < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0031182009991041 | author = Midlej V., Benchimol M. | year = 2010 | title = Trichomonas vaginalis kills and eats- evidence for phagocytic activity as a cytopathic effect | url =https://archive.org/details/sim_parasitology_2010-01_137_1/page/65| journal = Parasitology | volume = 137 | issue = 1| pages = 65–76 | pmid = 19723359 | s2cid = 33988014 }} < /ref >  Trichomoniasis can affect both men and women.  It is usually an [[infection]] of the [[urinary system]] and [[genitals]]. 
 
 ==Cause== 
 The ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' parasite can only live in the human [[genitals|genital tract]].  Trichomoniasis is only spread through sex, or if two people's genitals touch. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm |title=Trichomoniasis - CDC Fact Sheet |publisher= |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archive-date=19 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210323/http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm |url-status=live }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 Most people with trichomoniasis do not have any [[symptom]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/stdfact-trichomoniasis.htm|title=STD Facts - Trichomoniasis|work=cdc.gov|date=2 December 2021|access-date=26 October 2017|archive-date=19 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210323/http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm|url-status=live}} < /ref >   
 
 When people do have symptoms, they usually start about 5 to 28 days after the person got infected.  Symptoms may include: < ref name= " Trichomoniasis symptoms " > [https://www.cdc.gov/STD/Trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm#symptoms Trichomoniasis symptoms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219210323/http://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm#symptoms |date=2013-02-19 }}. cdc.gov < /ref > 
 * Pain, burning, or itching in the [[urethra]] (urethritis), the [[vagina]] ([[vaginitis]]), or the [[penis]] 
 * Pain while having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] ([[dyspareunia]]) 
 * Women may have a yellow-green, badly-smelling [[vaginal discharge]] 
 * Lower abdominal pain (this does not happen often) 
 
 ===Complications=== 
 Complications are serious problems that can happen because a person has a disease.  These problems do not happen to everyone with trichomoniasis.  They are the most serious problems that trichomoniasis can cause.  Some of the most [[danger]]ous problems that can happen to a person with trichomoniasis include: 
 * People with trichomoniasis are more likely to get (or spread) [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[AIDS]]. < ref name=Secor > {{cite journal | author = Secor W, Meites E, Starr M, Workowski K | year = 2014 | title = Neglected parasitic infections in the United States: trichomoniasis | url = | journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 90 | issue = 5| pages = 800–804 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.13-0723 | pmid = 24808247 | pmc = 4015567 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|title=Trichomoniasis and HIV interactions: a review.|author=Kissinger P and Adamski A|journal=Nih.gov|year=2013|volume=89|issue=6|pages=426–433|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2012-051005|pmid=23605851|pmc=3748151}} < /ref > 
 * If a woman is [[pregnancy|pregnant]], trichomoniasis can cause her to have a [[premature birth|premature]] infant, or an infant that weighs less than normal. < ref name=Secor / > 
 * Trichomoniasis may work together with [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) to cause [[cervical cancer]], although this has not been proven. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Association of Trichomonas vaginalis and cytological abnormalities of the cervix in low risk women.|author=Donders GG |display-authors=etal |journal=Nih.gov|pmid=24386492|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0086266|volume=8|pmc=3875579|year=2013|issue=12 |pages=e86266|doi-access=free }} < /ref > 
 * In men, trichomoniasis can cause [[inflammation]] (swelling) of the urethra and the [[prostate]].  In the prostate, trichomoniasis may create chronic (long-term) inflammation that may eventually cause [[prostate cancer]]. < ref name= " CainiGandini2014 " > {{cite journal|last1=Caini|first1=Saverio|last2=Gandini|first2=Sara|last3=Dudas|first3=Maria|last4=Bremer|first4=Viviane|last5=Severi|first5=Ettore|last6=Gherasim|first6=Alin|title=Sexually transmitted infections and prostate cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Cancer Epidemiology|volume=38|issue=4|year=2014|pages=329–338|issn=1877-7821|doi=10.1016/j.canep.2014.06.002|pmid=24986642}} < /ref > < ref name=pmid19741211 > {{cite journal |last1=Stark |first1=Jennifer R. |last2=Judson |first2=Gregory |last3=Alderete |first3=John F. |last4=Mundodi |first4=Vasanthakrishna |last5=Kucknoor |first5=Ashwini S. |last6=Giovannucci |first6=Edward L. |last7=Platz |first7=Elizabeth A. |last8=Sutcliffe |first8=Siobhan |last9=Fall |first9=Katja |last10=Kurth |first10=T. |last11=Ma |first11=J. |last12=Stampfer |first12=M.

 ==Treatment== 
 Treatment for trichomoniasis is usually [[metronidazole]] (Flagyl), which kills protozoa like ''Trichomonas vaginalis''. < ref > [http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich_tri.cfm#3 Vaginitis/Trichomoniasis :Treatment for trichomoniasis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401092100/http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich_tri.cfm#3 |date=2008-04-01 }}, [[American Social Health Association]].

 About 95% to 97% of people with trichomoniasis are cured after one dose of metronidazole. < ref name= " Workowski KA 2010 " / > < ref > {{cite journal | author = Niccolai LM, Kopicko JJ, Kassie A, Petros H, Clark RA, Kissinger P | year = 2000 | title = Incidence and predictors of reinfection with Trichomonas vaginalis in HIV-infected women | url =https://archive.org/details/sim_sexually-transmitted-diseases_2000-05_27_5/page/284| journal = Sex Transm Dis. | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 284–288 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-200005000-00009 | pmid = 10821602 | s2cid = 37556873 }} < /ref >    
 
 Without treatment, trichomoniasis can stay in a woman's body for months to years.  In many (but not all) men, it seems to go away on its own. < ref name=Secor / > 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 Trichomoniasis can be [[wikt: prevent|prevented]] by having [[safe sex]] (for example, by using [[condom]]s). < ref > [http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich.cfm#8 Vaginitis/Trichomoniasis :Reduce your risk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316073148/http://www.ashastd.org/learn/learn_vag_trich.cfm#8 |date=2008-03-16 }}, [[American Social Health Association]].

 The United States [[Centers for Disease Control]] and Prevention (CDC) suggests that women who are having vaginal discharge should get tested for trichomoniasis. < ref name= " Workowski KA 2010 " > Workowski KA, Berman S.
