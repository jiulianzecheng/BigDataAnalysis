 The '''shoebill''', ''Balaeniceps rex'', is also called the whalehead, whale-headed stork, or shoe-billed stork. It is a [[bird]] in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Pelecaniformes]]. It is the only living [[species]] in the [[genus]] '''''Balaeniceps''''' and the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Balaenicipitidae]].  
 
 The bird looks [[wikt:similar|similar]] to a [[stork]], but can be easily told apart by its famous shoe-shaped [[beak]]. The shoebill lives in [[East Africa]], in parts of [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]], [[Zambia]], and the [[Central African Republic]].  
 
 The [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] says that the shoebill is [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. There are thought to be around 5,000{{ndash}}8,000 shoebills in the world, but the [[population]] might be as big as 10,000. The birds are at risk because of [[habitat destruction]] and [[hunting]]. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The shoebill was first described by [[John Gould]] in 1850. He gave it the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] (a two-part name given to types of plants and animals) ''Balaeniceps rex''. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names|url=https://archive.org/details/helmdictionarysc00jobl|last=Jobling|first=James A.|publisher=Christopher Helm|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4081-3326-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/helmdictionarysc00jobl/page/n66 66], 333}} < /ref >  The shoebill is also sometimes called the shoebill stork, shoe-billed stork, or bogbird. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Balaeniceps rex (Shoebill) - Avibase|url=https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/species.jsp?avibaseid=47C7FDFD96162AC1|access-date=2021-08-26|website=avibase.bsc-eoc.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Studies of the shoebill's [[DNA]] have shown that the shoebill is in its own family, [[Balaenicipitidae]]. These studies have also shown that it is closely related to the [[Pelican|pelicans]], and so it is now put in the order [[Pelecaniformes]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Hackett|first1=S.

 == Description == 
 The shoebill is a large, tall bird that is around {{Convert|120|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and weighing {{Convert|6-7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for [[Male|males]] and {{Convert|4.36-5.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for [[Female|females]]. Males and females look almost the same, but males are a little larger. The birds are easily told apart by their [[shoe]]-shaped [[beak]]. They are mostly grey in color, with their belly being whitish. The [[Wing|wings]] are darker than the rest of the body, and the upper body is slightly greenish in color. The beak is usually straw-colored with blackish marks, while the [[Iris (eye)|iris]] (the non-black part of the eye) can be yellow, grey, or whitish in color. The beak has a [[Fishing hook|hook]]-like end that helps catch fish. Younger birds look similar to adults, but are more brownish and have smaller, more pinkish beaks. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 When it is flying, the shoebill looks like other storks and [[Heron|herons]]. It can be told apart by the shape of its beak and its bluish-grey color. 
 
 === Sounds === 
 The shoebill is mostly silent. Sometimes, they do bill-clattering displays near their nests. During these displays, they sometimes make ''moo'' sounds that are like a cow's. They make high-pitched ''beeeeeh'' sounds near their nests, and might also make loud sounds when flying. Young shoebills are known to make sounds that are like human [[hiccups]] when they want food. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Distribution == 
 The shoebill lives in [[Marsh|marshes]] from southern [[Sudan]] and southwestern [[Ethiopia]] to southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]] and northern [[Zambia]]. It is also sometimes found in the [[Central African Republic]]. It also lives in [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Kenya]]. The areas that it lives in are mostly places that also have [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[lungfish]]. It does not migrate, but sometimes moves to different areas when the water level changes. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|chapter-url=https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/shoebi1/1.0/introduction|chapter=Shoebill (Balaeniceps rex)|last1=Elliott|first1=Andrew|last2=Garcia|first2=Ernest|last3=Boesman|first3=Peter F.

 It likes marshes that have papyrus, [[Reed (plant)|reeds]], [[cattails]], and [[Grass|grasses]]. It sometimes lives in marshy areas next to lakes and in places where the water have very little [[oxygen]]. In places with very deep water, it needs floating vegetation. < ref name= " :0 "  / >   
 
 Rock art from [[Oued Djerat]] in eastern [[Algeria]] shows that in the early [[Holocene]], shoebills lived much more to the north, in [[wetlands]] where the [[Sahara Desert]] is now. < ref name= " oeschger2004 " > {{Cite journal|last=Oeschger, E.|year=2004|title=Sahara - Algeria - Rock Art in Oued Derat and the Tefedest Region |url=http://www.rockartscandinavia.com/images/articles/a04oeschger.pdf|journal=Adoranten|language=English|volume=2004|pages=5–19}} < /ref > 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 Shoebills are solitary by nature, and even their nests are spaced apart. Breeding pairs defend a territory 2 to 4{{convert|2|to|4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} from others of their species. 
 
 === Diet === 
 The shoebill mostly eats [[fish]] weighing up to {{Convert|500|g|oz|abbr=on}}. The main types of fish that it eats are lungfish, Senegal [[bichir]], ''[[Clarias cavernicola|Clarias]]'' [[catfish]], and [[tilapia]]. It also eats [[Amphibian|amphibians]], young [[Crocodile|crocodiles]], water [[Snake|snakes]], [[Rodent|rodents]], and young [[waterfowl]]. The shoebill likes to hunt in areas where the water has less oxygen, because fish in these areas have to come up to breathe. The animals that the shoebill eats depends on where it lives. For example, it mainly eats lungfish and catfish in Uganda, but mainly eats catfish and water snakes in Zambia. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Status == 
 The [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] says that the shoebill is [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=International)|first=BirdLife International (BirdLife|date=2018-08-13|title=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Balaeniceps rex|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/en|access-date=2021-08-26|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species}} < /ref >
