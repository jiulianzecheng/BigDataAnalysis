 The '''kukri''' or '''khukuri''' ({{lang-ne|खुकुरी}} ''khukuri'') is a knife which is mostly used by [[Nepali language|Nepali speaking]] [[Gurkha]]s of [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. The blade of the knife is curved inward, similar to a [[machete]]. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in South Asia.
