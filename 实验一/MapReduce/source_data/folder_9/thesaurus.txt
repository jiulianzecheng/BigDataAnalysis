A '''thesaurus''' is a [[dictionary]] of [[synonym]]s (words that have the same or similar meaning). Thesauruses (or thesauri) often include related [[words]] that mean almost the same thing. Some thesauruses also include [[antonym]]s (words that have the opposite meaning). 
 
 For example, by looking up the word  " big "  in a thesaurus, someone would find a list of other similar words such as  " huge "  and  " massive " . If the thesaurus also has a list of antonyms, the user could also find words which mean the opposite, like  " small "  and  " tiny " . 
 
 Many [[student]]s and [[writer]]s use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are [[writing]]. Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their [[vocabulary]] (the number of words that they know).
