 An '''oar''' is a [[tool]] used to move a boat through water. Oars have a flat blade at one end.  The oarsmen grasp the oar at the other end. The difference between oars and [[paddle]]s is that paddles are held by the paddler, and are not connected with the [[vessel]].  Oars generally are fastened to the vessel. The use of oars is called [[rowing]]. An oar used at the [[stern]] (rear) of a boat to steer is called a '''steering oar'''. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steering%20oar |title=steering oar, noun |author= |website= |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |accessdate=21 October 2015}} < /ref >
