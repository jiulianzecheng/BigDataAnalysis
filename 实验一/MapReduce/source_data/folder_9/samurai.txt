 The '''samurai''' (or '''bushi''') were Japanese [[warrior]]s who were members of the important [[military]] [[social class|class]] before Japanese society changed in 1868. The samurai were also considered to be a type of hereditary [[nobility]]. 
   
 The word ''samurai'' comes from the Japanese [[verb]] ''saburau'', which means  " to serve and look up to someone.

 == History  == 
 
 In the 12th century, two military [[clan]]s, the [[Minamoto]] and the [[Taira]], were very powerful. They controlled  Japan and fought wars against each other. In 1192, [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] became the first [[shogun]]. He became the ruler of all of Japan and started a new government in [[Kamakura]]. The Kamakura government lasted from 1185 to 1333. < ref > {{Cite web|url = http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1000ce_samurai.htm|title = The Age Of The Samurai|first =|last =|website =|publisher =|accessdate =}} < /ref >  It made the samurai the ruling class of Japanese society. 
 
 The samurai fought many wars in the [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]] (1467-1573). There were many [[Independence|independent]] areas in Japan that fought one another all the time and so Japan needed many samurai. Many of the famous samurai [[movie]]s by [[Akira Kurosawa]] were about this time.  
 
 [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] won many wars against other [[clan]]s. He made Japan one country and developed a social [[caste]] system. It was completed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and the rulers after him. Between the wars, many samurai had always worked on farms. Hideyoshi said that all samurai must either live on farms or live in [[castle]] towns with other [[warrior]]s. He also made a law that only samurai could have swords. 
 
 The samurai became very powerful and important near the end of the [[Edo period]] (1603-1867) and during the [[Shinto]] period. In the Edo period, they were the most important social [[caste]].  All samurai had to live in [[castle]] towns. Some of them had [[lord]]s who paid them with [[rice]], but others did not have lords and were called  " [[rōnin]] " . The  " rōnin "  caused problems for Japan in the early Edo period. 
 
 In 1615, the [[Tokugawa]] an won a very important [[battle]] when he took [[Osaka Castle]]. It has no [[rival]]s and so Japan became very peaceful for about 250 years. [[Military]] skills became less important, and most samurai became [[bureaucracy|bureaucrats]], teachers or artists. 
 
 In 1868, [[feudalism]] ended in Japan, which ended the samurai class.

 == Beliefs  == 
 A samurai believed that his swords held his [[soul]] and so his sword was the most important thing that he had. 
 
 Samurai were allowed to fight anyone who did not show them proper respect. Every sword had to be tested for sharpness. To do so, the owner of the sword could [[execution|execute]] a [[criminal]]. 
 
 Samurai led their lives according to the [[ethics|ethical]] code of ''bushido'' ( " the way of the warrior " ). That meant loyalty to one's master, self-[[discipline]], respect, and ethical behavior. When a samurai lost his master, also called ''[[daimyo]]'', he became a ''rōnin''.  
 
 If a samurai was defeated or dishonored himself by not following the code of ''bushido'', he had to commit ''[[seppuku]]'' ([[ritual]] [[suicide]]). Part of the ''seppuku'' ritual was cutting his [[stomach]] or [[abdomen]]. That part of the ritual is called ''hara-kiri''. For a samurai, death was better than having no [[honor]] or being captured by the enemy. Another reason for committing ''Seppuku'' was the death of the daimyo. With that ritual, a samurai showed how [[loyalty|loyal]] he was to his dead master. There were periods in which ''seppuku'' was forbidden, but some samurai still committed it. 
 
 The bushi's training methods, like [[meditation]], [[judo]] and [[kendo]], are still followed today. There is no longer a samurai class in [[modern]] Japan, but their families' successors are still well-respected. 
 
 == Women  ==  
 
 Samurai women were trained to defend themselves and their children. They usually did so when their warrior husbands were busy in battles. Sumurai women were therefore trained to handle [[polearm]]s (naginata) and short [[dagger]]s ([[tanto]]). During the Edo period, Japanese women were trained to handle naginata by the age of 18. The short [[kaiken]] knife was used by young women to defend their [[virtue]] or, if they lost it, to take their own life. 
 
 During the Edo period, women's education became very important. Girls were taught from a young age to write, read, dance, etc. The main criteria for marriage changed, but among the most important were physical attractiveness and education. Special books were written for women. They taught mainly how to take care of house and children. By the end of the Edo period, women attended philosophical and literary classes. 
 
 The term  " samurai "  refers to males specifically, but here were a few women who were samurai. One of the most famous was [[Itagaki]], who lived during the end of the [[Heian period]]. She owned her own army of about 3,000 warriors. In 1199, Itagaki fought against 10,000 Heike soldiers. She was famous for being very good at handling the [[naginata]] [[sword]].  
 
 Hino Tomiko ruled in place of her husband, Ashikaga Yoshimasa (8th [[shogun]]). 
 
 Toyotomi Hideyoshi's mistress became the master of [[Osaka Castle]] after his death. 
 
 [[Yamauchi Kazutoyo]]'s wife, Chiyo, was one of the most loyal wives known in Japanese history. She supported her husband during hard times and saved to buy a horse for him. Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a [[mistress]], though it was a known tradition for a samurai. He never left Chiyo even though she had only one child.
