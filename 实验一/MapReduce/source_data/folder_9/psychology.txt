'''Psychology''' is the study of the mind. It studies [[Thought|thoughts]], [[Emotion|feelings]], and [[Behaviour|behaviors]] in humans and animals. Psychology aims to explain how the mind works. It also looks at how our actions relate to how we think. < ref name=APA > {{cite web|title=How does the APA defin " psychology " ? | url = http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer | accessdate = 15 November 2011}} < /ref > < ref name=APA2 > {{cite web|title=Definition of  " psychology (APA's Index Page) "  | url = http://www.apa.org/about/index.aspx | accessdate = 20 December 2011}} < /ref > < ref name= " Fernald " > Fernald L.D. 2008.

 A lot of the research in psychology is done on [[Human|humans]]. However, [[Animal|animals]] are also used in research. Examples of this are [[classical conditioning]] and [[Operant conditioning|operant conditioning.]]  < ref > Hamm, M.,  &  Mitchell, R. W. (1997). The interpretation of animal psychology: anthropomorphism or behavior reading?. Behaviour, 134(3-4), 173-204. < /ref > < ref > Tooby, J.,  &  Cosmides, L. (1989). Adaption versus phylogeny: The role of animal psychology in the study of human behavior. International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 2(3). < /ref >  Psychology is a vast subject area. It covers many topics. It is divided into branches. Psychology has a lot in common with other fields of research. Ideas in psychology overlap with ideas in the sciences of [[anatomy]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[physiology]].  
 
 A person who works in the field of psychology is called a [[psychologist]]. A psychologist tries to understand how the mind works so that they can help people and animals. They must go through [[higher education]] for many years in order to become a professional. These [[wikt:practitioner|practitioners]] attempt to explain how the mind functions by itself (individual) and with others (social). They also see how the mind affects the body. They work with [[Social sciences|social]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral]], and [[Cognitive science|cognitive sciences]]. 
 
 == Branches == 
 Psychology has been split up into smaller parts called branches. These are subjects in psychology that try to answer a particular group of questions about how people think. The branches of psychology that are often studied are:

 == Methods == 
 === Scientific approaches === 
 Psychology is a type of [[science]], so research psychologists use many of the same types of methods that researchers from other [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use.  
 
 Psychologists make [[theories]] to try to explain a behavior or pattern they see. Based on their theory, they make [[prediction]]s. Then, they carry out [[experiment|experiments]] or collect data to see if their prediction is right or wrong.  
 
 Some types of experiments cannot be done on people because it would take too long, cost too much money, risk people's health, or be [[ethics|unethical]]. There are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically, and test their theories. Psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own; they might look at [[pattern]]s among existing groups of people in [[natural]] environments; or they might do experiments on animals (which can be simpler and more ethical to study). 
 
 Just like in other fields of science, a good psychological theory can be proven wrong as new information about a subject is learned. Just like in any natural science, psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is correct. If a theory can be proved wrong, but experiments do not prove it wrong, it is more likely that the theory is accurate. This is called [[falsifiability]]. 
 
 Psychologists use many tools as part of their daily work. Psychologists use surveys to ask people how they feel and what they think. They may use special devices to look at the brain and to see what it is doing. Psychologists use [[computers]] to collect [[data]] as they measure how people behave in response to pictures, words, [[symbol]]s, or other [[stimulus|stimuli]]. Psychologists also use [[statistics]] to help them analyze the data that they get from their experiments. < ref > Aron, A.,  &  Aron, E. N. (1999). Statistics for psychology. Prentice-Hall, Inc. < /ref > < ref > Coolican, H. (2018). Research methods and statistics in psychology. Routledge. < /ref > 
 
 === Symbolic and subjective approaches === 
 Not all psychology is scientific psychology. [[Psychodynamic psychology]] and [[depth psychology]] try to interpret [[dream]]s to understand the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] mind. < ref > Rulla, L. M. (1971). Depth psychology and vocation: A psycho-social perspective. Gregorian Biblical BookShop. < /ref > < ref > McNeely, D. A. (1987). Touching: Body therapy and depth psychology. Inner City Books. < /ref >  They are older approaches to psychology begun by [[Carl Jung|Carl Jung.]] He was interested in finding methods to measure personality traits. < ref > Hopcke, R. H. (2013). A guided tour of the collected works of CG Jung. Shambhala Publications. < /ref > 
 
 [[Humanistic psychology]] and [[existential psychology]] believe that it is more important to understand personal meaning than to find causes and effects of mental processes and behaviors. < ref > Schneider, K. J., Pierson, J. F.,  &  Bugental, J. F. (Eds.). (2014). The handbook of humanistic psychology: Theory, research, and practice. Sage Publications. < /ref > < ref > Jacobsen, B. (2007). Invitation to existential psychology. Wiley. < /ref > 
 
 == Psychologists == 
 Psychologists are people who work in the field of psychology. A psychologist may work in either basic research or applied research. Basic research is the study of people or animals to learn more about them. Applied research uses what is learned from basic research to solve real-world problems. A qualified [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]] can become a [[therapist]] or [[counsellor]].  
 
 To become a psychologist, a person must first get a basic degree at a university and go to [[graduate school]]. A Master's degree, either MSc (Master of Science) or MA (Master of Arts), allows for work such as a [[School psychology|school psychologist]]. A doctorate degree takes a longer time to earn because it includes doing research and writing a detailed report. A doctoral graduate uses the initials [[PhD]] or DPhil (Doctor of Philosophy). Some clinical psychologists earn a Doctor of Psychology degree and use the initials PsyD after their name. The [[American Psychological Association]] say that people need a PhD (or PsyD) and a current state license in the U.S. to call themselves a psychologist. 
 
 The words ''psychologist'' and ''psychiatrist'' may be confused with each other. A ''[[psychiatrist]]'' has graduated from medical school and uses the initials [[MD]] or its equivalent (MB ChB in [[London University]], for example). A psychiatrist or doctor may work with a psychologist by prescribing and checking the effects of medications.
