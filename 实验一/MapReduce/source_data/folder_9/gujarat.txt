 == Etymology == 
 Gujarat is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] term ''Gurjaratra'', meaning ''The Land of the [[Gurjar]]s'', Gurjars being the tribe who ruled Gujarat from the 5th to 11th centuries. Gujarat was ruled by the [[Gurjar]] people in the past. Parts of modern [[Rajasthan]] and Gujarat have been known as ''Gurjaratra'' or ''Gurjarabhumi'' (Land of the [[Gurjar]]s) due to being ruled by Gurjar rulers before the period of the [[Rajput]]s and subsequently the [[Islam]]ic conquests.
