 A '''canyon''' (or '''gorge''') is a big crack in the ground, or a  very deep valley. < ref > [http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/canyon/?ar_a=1 Canyon] -National Geographic < /ref >  Most canyons are made by [[rivers]]. A few are made by [[earthquakes]]. They can be big, like the [[Grand Canyon]], or small. 
 
 Canyons can be formed by [[erosion]] by running water which will take [[rocks]] and [[soil]] away.
