{{wiktionary|slogan}} 
 
 A '''slogan''' is a memorable [[motto]] or [[phrase]]. It is often used in a [[political]], [[Advertising|commercial]], [[religious]], and other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose. The word slogan is derived from ''slogorn'' which was an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''sluagh-ghairm tanmay'' (''sluagh''  " army " ,  " host "  + ''gairm''  " cry " ) < ref name= " Merriam-Webster-p1174 " > Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174. < /ref >   meaning something an army [[chant]]ed while fighting, to keep them all cooperating.  
 
 Slogans vary from the written and the visual to the chanted and the vulgar. Their simple [[rhetorical]] nature usually leaves little room for detail. Marketing slogans are often called ''[[tagline]]s'' in the United States. They can be called ''straplines'' in the U.K. Europeans use the terms ''baselines'', ''signatures'', ''claims'', or ''pay-offs''.
