'''Monotheism''' is the belief in only one [[Deity|god]], rather than two or more, which would be [[polytheism]] such as [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and partly [[Hinduism]]. Many [[religion]]s are monotheistic, such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Baha'i Faith]], [[Sikhism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Cao Dai]] and [[Tenrikyo]]. Some [[Paganism|pagan and neo-pagan]] religions are also monotheistic. [[Deism]] is the belief that a higher being like god exists, but rejects the belief in many gods, [[revelation]], religions, [[ritual|rituals]], sacred books (like the [[Bible]] or [[Quran]]), [[prophet|prophets]] (like [[Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]]), etc. Judaism and [[Zoroastrianism]] are thought to be the oldest living monotheistic religions.
