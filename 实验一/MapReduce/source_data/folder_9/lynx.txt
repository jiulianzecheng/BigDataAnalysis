 The '''''Lynx''''' is a [[small cat]]. It is a [[genus]] with four [[species]]. < ref > Wozencraft W.C. 2005. Order Carnivora. In Wilson D.E.  &  Reeder D M. (eds) ''Mammal species of the world''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 541–542. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8221-0}} < /ref >  The four species are in [[Eurasia]], [[Spain]], [[Canada]] and [[America]], and do not overlap much. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 ''Lynx'' have short [[tail]]s, and usually some [[hair]] on the [[ear]]s. They have large paws ([[foot|feet]]) padded for walking on snow, and long [[whisker]]s on the face. The color of the [[body]] is from light brown to grey and is sometimes marked with dark brown spots, especially on the [[leg]]s. They weigh about 5 & nbsp;kg or about 11 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (approximately the size of a large [[cat|domestic cat]]) and can weigh up to about 30 & nbsp;kg (66 pounds). They are between 70 and 150 [[cm]] long, with a relative short tail - 5-25 [[Centimetre|cm]]. They live for about 20 years. 
 
 ''Lynx'' are similar to a regular house cat, but larger. They have a powerful body on short, furry legs attached to hefty feet, and a bobbed, black-tipped tail. The fur is spotted and yellowish-brown to grey. It has a collar of fur around the face, giving a triangular shape. They also have long black ear tufts. 
 
 == Habitat == 
 ''Lynx'' live in the high [[wikt:altitude|altitude]] [[forest]]s with many [[shrub]]s, [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] and [[grass]]. They hunt only on the ground, but can climb [[tree]]s and [[swimming|swim]]. 
 
 They can be found in the some places in northern [[Scandinavia]], in [[North America]] and also in the [[Himalaya]]s. Since the 1990s people try to move part of the population of the Eurasian lynx to [[Germany]]. They can also be found in [[Bialowieza Forest|Białowieża Forest]] (northeastern [[Poland]]), and southern [[Spain]]. 
 
 The Colorado Division of Wildlife tried to move other wild ''Lynx'' populations from [[Canada]] back to the [[United States]]. 
 
 == Behaviour == 
 ''Lynx'' are usually [[wikt:solitary|solitary]], although a small group may travel and hunt together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between two and four kittens. The young stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months, before moving out to live on their own as young adults. 
 
 ''Lynx'' make their dens in crevices or under ledges. They feed on a wide range of animals from [[white-tailed deer]], [[reindeer]], [[roe deer]], small [[red deer]], and [[chamois]], to smaller, more usual prey: [[snowshoe hare]]s, [[fish]], [[fox]]es, [[sheep]], [[squirrel]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]s and other [[bird]]s, and [[Domestic goat|goat]]s. They also eat [[ptarmigan]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[grouse]]. 
 
 == The genus ''Lynx'' == 
 * Genus ''Lynx'' 
 ** [[Canada lynx]], ''Lynx canadensis'' 
 ** [[Eurasian lynx]], ''Lynx lynx'' 
 ** [[Iberian lynx]] or Spanish Lynx, ''Lynx pardinus'' 
 ** [[Bobcat]], ''Lynx rufus'' 
 
 == Conservation == 
 The Iberian lynx is the most [[extinction|endangered]] [[Felidae|feline]] in the world. There are only two populations (together, 300 animals), in the southern Spain. 
 Hunting lynxes is [[illegal]] in many countries.
