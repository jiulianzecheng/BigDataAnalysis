 '''Rutherglen''' (pronounced: ruh-ther-glen) is a town in [[South Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. ''Rutherglen'' comes from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] ''An Ruadh Ghleann'', meaning  " the red valley " . In [[1975]], it lost its own local council and administratively became a component of the City of Glasgow. In [[1996]] Rutherglen was reallocated to the [[South Lanarkshire]] [[Subdivisions of Scotland|council area]].

 ==History== 
 Rutherglen remains the oldest [[royal burgh]] in Scotland, being more than 500 years older than Glasgow. It was a centre of [[heavy industry]], having a long [[coal mining]] tradition which died out by [[1950]], and was until the [[1960s]] home to the infamous White's chemical works, which was responsible for huge swathes of the area from southern Glasgow across to the town of [[Cambuslang]] being polluted with [[chromium]] [[waste]]. Rutherglen, and most of the towns encircling the city, are now dormitory [[suburb]]s of Glasgow.
