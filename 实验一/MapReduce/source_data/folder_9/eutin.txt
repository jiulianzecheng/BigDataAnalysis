 '''Eutin''' ({{IPA-de|ɔʏˈtiːn}}) is the district capital of [[Ostholstein|Eastern Holstein]] county. It is  in the north German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. As of 2015, about 17,000 people lived in the town. 
 
 ==History== 
 The name Eutin (originally Utin) is Slavic. Its meaning is not clear. It probably came from the personal name  " Uta " . The Slavic [[Obotrites]] tribe settled eastern Holstein in the 7th/8th centuries A.D. and built a [[Utin (castle)|castle]] on [[Pheasant Island (Eutin)|Pheasant Island]] in the lake now called the [[Großer Eutiner See]]. 
 
 Dutch settlers came to live in ''Utin'' in the twelfth century. In 1156 Eutin became a market town.  It later became the seat of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck]] because [[Lübeck]] itself was an [[imperial free city]].  When the bishopric was secularized in 1803, Eutin became part of the [[Duchy of Oldenburg]]. In the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, Eutin passed from the [[Free State of Oldenburg]] to the [[Prussia]]n [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. After [[World War II]], it became part of the modern [[States of Germany|Bundesland]] of Schleswig-Holstein. 
 
 ==Culture== 
 Eutin is birthplace of composer [[Carl Maria von Weber]]. To honor him, an open-air theater (''{{lang|de|Freilichtbühne}}'') was built in the park of [[Eutin Castle]] in 1951. Operas are performed there in July and August during the [[Eutin Opera Summer Festival]] (''{{lang|de|Eutiner Festspiele}}''). The seating capacity of this open-air venue is about 2000. The festival includes music students in Eutin aand students from the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], United States. Lawrence is a twin city with Eutin.  
 
 Eutin has an annual Blues Festival ([[Bluesfest Eutin]]) at the beginning of summer. Local musicians, as well as up and coming blues artists from around the world, come to play at this three-day outdoor blues festival. The festival is in the market place in the center of town. Admission is free.

 ==Geography and economy== 
 Eutin is surrounded by lakes of the [[Holsteinische Schweiz]], including the [[Großer Eutiner See]], [[Kleiner Eutiner See]], [[Kellersee]] and [[Ukleisee]]. There are forests around the lakes. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing. 
 
 Schleswig-Holstein, particularly Eutin, has many [[rapeseed]] fields. They produce biofuel. Wind turbines are also a common in this rural region.
