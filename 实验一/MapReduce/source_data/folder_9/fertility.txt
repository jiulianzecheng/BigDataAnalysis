'''Fertility''' is the natural capability to give [[life]]. In [[human]]s and [[animal]]s, fertility means that the [[parent]] can produce babies. 
 
 More precisely, fertility is the [[wikt:capacity|capacity]] of an individual or [[population]] to produce viable [[wikt:offspring|offspring]]. < ref > King R.C. ''et al.'' (2006). ''A Dictionary of genetics''. 7th ed, Oxford University Press. p. 234 < /ref >  By 'viable' is meant 'able to live and reproduce'. 
 
 In '''[[agriculture]]''', fertility means that a [[soil]] can support the growth of [[plant]]s because it contains the right [[mineral]]s and [[nutrient]]s. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.soilmanagementindia.com/soil-fertility/soil-fertility-definition-types-and-factors-soil-science/15835 | title=Soil Fertility: Definition, Types and Factors  & #124; Soil Science | date=22 March 2018 }} < /ref > 
 
 Fertility can also be used as a [[metaphor]]: having a  " fertile imagination "  means being able to think of many new and interesting things. 
 
 As a measure, '''fertility rate''' is the number of children born per couple, or person or population. This is different to [[fecundity]]. This is defined as the ''potential'' for reproduction (influenced by [[gamete]] production, fertilisation and carrying a [[pregnancy]] to term. In English language, the term was originally applied only to [[female]]s, but increasingly is applied to males as well, as common understanding of [[reproduction|reproductive]] mechanisms increases and the importance of the [[male]] role is better known. [[Infertility]] is a deficient fertility. 
 
 Human fertility depends on factors of [[nutrition]], [[sexual behavior]], [[culture]], [[instinct]], [[endocrinology]], timing, [[economics]], way of life, and [[emotion]]s.  Animal fertility is no less complex, and may display astounding mechanisms.

 ===Female Fertility=== 
 In the [[United States]], the average age of  [[menarche]] (first period) is about 12.5 years. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date= April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi= 10.1542/peds.111.4.844}} < /ref >  However, in most girls, menarche does not signal that [[ovulation]] has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are [[anovulatory]] in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. < ref name= " Apter D 1980 107–20 " > {{cite journal |author=Apter D |title=Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_clinical-endocrinology_1980-02_12_2/page/107 |journal= Clinical Endocrinology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=107–20 |date= Feb 1980 |pmid=6249519 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x|s2cid=19913395 }} < /ref >   
 Women's fertility peaks between ages 22–26, and after 35 it starts to sharply decline. 
 
 Birth rates have been noted by Henri Leridon, PhD, as an epidemiologist with the [[French Institute of Health and Medical Research]]. Of women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or ''in vitro'' fertilization: 
 
 *At age 30 
 **75% will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year 
 **91% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years. 
 *At age 35 
 ** 66% will have a conception ending in a live birth  within one year 
 ** 84% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years. 
 *At age 40 
 **44% will have a conception ending in a live birth  within one year 
 **64% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Ingentaconnect Can assisted reproduction technology compensate for the natural D |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/humrep/2004/00000019/00000007/art01548 |access-date=2011-08-24 |archive-date=2012-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025132947/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/humrep/2004/00000019/00000007/art01548 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/19/7/1548/2356634|title=Can assisted reproduction technology compensate for the natural decline in fertility with age?

 The use of [[fertility medication|fertility drugs]] and/or ''in vitro'' fertilization can increase the chances of becoming pregnant at a later age. < ref > {{cite web |title=Spanish woman 'is oldest mother' |date= 30 December 2006 |accessdate= 2006-12-30 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6220523.stm |publisher= BBC News}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Male Fertility=== 
 There is evidence that male reproduction abilities are reduced with higher age. < ref name=Kidd > {{cite journal |author=Kidd SA, Eskenazi B, Wyrobek AJ |title= Effects of male age on semen quality and fertility: a review of the literature |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=237–48 |date= Feb 2001 |pmid=11172821 |doi= 10.1016/S0015-0282(00)01679-4 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015-0282(00)01679-4}} < /ref > 
 Sperm count is becoming smaller with age, with men aged 50–80 years producing 75% of sperm compared with 20–50 years old males. 
 If the sperm count is too low, a man could increase it with herbal and chemical supplements. < ref > [http://www.consumerhealthplus.com/best-male-fertility-supplement Male fertility supplement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323004340/http://www.consumerhealthplus.com/best-male-fertility-supplement |date=2013-03-23 }} website < /ref > 
 Even larger change can be seen in the number of [[seminiferous tubules]] produced by males at different age stages: 
 
 *In males 20–39 years old, 90% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm. 
 *In males 40–69 years old, 50% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm. 
 *In males 80 years old and older, 10% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm. < ref name=semin > [http://www.infertile.com/inthenew/sci/maleage.htm Effect of Age on Male Fertility] Seminars in Reproductive Endocrinology. Volume, Number 3, August 1991. Sherman J. Silber, M.D. < /ref > 
 
 ===Infertility=== 
 When a person is infertile it means that they are unable to have a child naturally. Infertility is define as the inability to fall pregnant or carry a pregnancy until birth after 12 & nbsp;months or more of unprotected sex. About 10% of people are infertile. This means that 1 in 10 people will not be able to conceive a child naturally. There are many causes of infertility some of them can be treated. < ref name=pmid14569805 > {{cite journal |author=Makar RS, Toth TL |title=The evaluation of infertility |journal=Am J Clin Pathol. |volume=117 Suppl |pages=S95–103 |year=2002 |doi=10.1309/W8LJ-K377-DHRA-CP0B |pmid=14569805 }} < /ref >  As a woman gets older, her fertility declines. After menopause a woman is no longer fertile.
