[[Rehoboam]] was the [[son]] of [[King Solomon]]. After Solomon [[die]]d Rehoboam became [[king]] of [[Israel]].  When [[Jeroboam]] asked Rehoboam to get rid of the hight [[tax]]es that Solomon had, Rehoboam talked to his [[father]]’s advisors and they told him to listen. And Rehoboam also asked his [[friend]]s and they told him to ignore what Jeroboam was saying. So Rehoboam told Jeroboam and his followers “I have more [[strength]] in my little [[finger]] than my [[father]] had in his entire [[body]], if my father whipped you with [[lashes]] then I shall [[whip]] you with [[scorpion]]s”. After that most of the [[tribe]]s of [[Israel]] left Rehoboam to make their own [[kingdom]]. Then Rehoboam felt [[remorse]] and sent his [[tax collector]] [[Adoniram]] to make [[peace]] with Jereoboam’s followers but then they threw [[stone]]s at him until he [[die]]d so Rehoboam ran away. Then Jeroboam called his [[kingdom]], the kingdom of [[Israel]], while Rehoboam called his own kingdom [[Judah]]. Rehoboam planned to invade and [[conquer]] Jeroboam’s kingdom in the [[North]] but the [[prophet]] Shemaya told him not to do that so he didn’t.
