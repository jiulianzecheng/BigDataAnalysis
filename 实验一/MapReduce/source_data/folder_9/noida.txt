 '''Noida''' ({{lang-hi|नोएडा}}) also known as '''New Okhla Industrial Development Authority''' is newly emerged and one of the most important city of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The name has been essentially derived from New Okhla Industrial Area (Noida).  It is at the border of Uttar Pradesh and [[New Delhi]]. It comes under the Delhi-NCR region. With many IT Parks growing, it is one of the major contributor for Uttar Pradesh state revenue. The city is comparatively new, it started developing in early1980s. It now has all major facilities including hospitals, schools, shopping malls, markets, offices, active police force, well maintained roads and well built residential areas. Noida's connectivity to Delhi was improved by Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway or DND which was completed by 2001. By 2009, Noida was connected to New Delhi via metro lines which made the commute for locals much easier.
