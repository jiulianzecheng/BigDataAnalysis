 '''Parlour''' (or '''parlor'''), comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''parloir'', from ''parler'', which means  " to speak " . The parlour is a room in a house where people could meet. In [[Turkey]] it is called a [[kiosk]]. The [[Bible]] (Judges 3:20), talks about the  " summer parlour " , a small room built on the [[roof]] of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze. It has a door to the outside by which visitors can enter. 
 
 In parts of [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]], parlour is a common name for certain types of restaurants such as  " [[ice cream parlour]] "  and  " [[pizza]] parlour " . There are also  " Beer parlors " , < ref > {{cite book| last = Kroetsch| first = Robert| title = What the Crow Said| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Frb2R6vZco0C & pg=PA100| year = 1998| publisher = University of Alberta| isbn = 978-0-88864-303-2| page = 100 }} < /ref >  wine parlors, < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.sfiwineparlor.com/ |title=The Wine Parlor at St Francisville - Home |access-date=2009-10-09 |archive-date=2009-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924041847/http://www.sfiwineparlor.com/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  or, in at least one case, a  " spaghetti parlor.

 The  " inner parlours "  in 1 Chronicles 28:11 in the Bible were the small [[room (architecture)|room]]s or chambers which [[Solomon]] built all round two sides and one end of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] (1 Kings 6:5). Some people think the inner parlours may have been the [[porch]] and the holy place. 
 
 In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Christianity|Christian]] usage, the parlour was one of two rooms in a [[monastery]]. The 'outer parlour' was the room where the [[monk]]s or [[nun]]s could meet a visitor and do business with people from outside the monastery. It was generally in the west range of the buildings of the [[cloister]], close to the main entrance. The 'inner parlour' was found off the cloister, next to the [[chapter house]] in the east range of the monastery. Most religious orders wanted silence in the cloister, which was the place where the monks studied. The inner parlour was a place where the monks could talk without disturbing the others in the cloister. 
 
 In modern use, the '''parlour''' is a formal ''sitting room'' in a large house or [[mansion]]. In the late [[19th century]], it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions, and closed during the week. The family kept their best [[furniture]], works of [[art]] and other things on display in the parlour. The body of someone who died would be put on show in the parlour while [[funeral]] was being organized. During the [[20th century]], architects and decorators have changed the use of the room. In most homes the parlour has been replaced by the [[living room]].
