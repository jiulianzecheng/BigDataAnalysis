 '''Presentation''' is the process of presenting the content of a topic to an [[audience]]. [[Presentation software]], such as [[LibreOffice#Parts|LibreOffice Impress]], [[Beamer]], [[Keynote (software)|Apple Keynote]] or [[Microsoft PowerPoint]], is often used to generate the presentation content. As a form of [[communication]], a presentation is usually 10-30 minutes long, but can take longer in special cases.
