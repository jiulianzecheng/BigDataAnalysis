'''Serrasalmidae''' is the family of '''[[Piranha|piranhas]]'''. All are native to [[South America]]. It includes several living genera like ''[[Serrasalmus]]'', and an [[extinct]] [[genus]] called ''[[Megapiranha]]''.

 Piranhas have [[Tooth|sharp teeth]]. A [[pycnodont]] called ''[[Piranhamesodon]]'' has teeth resembling a [[piranha]]. The [[bluefish]] is called the [[Bluefish|marine piranha]] because of its teeth.  
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The Serrasalmidae were recently classified as a subfamily of the Characidae. However, the classification of these fish is still not certain. Despite this, the Serrasalmidae are relatively well understood. The genera and species are widely agrees. 
 
 == Fossil record == 
 The fossil record, particularly for piranhas, is relatively sparse. Most known fossils are from the Miocene. Two were in the Upper Cretaceous.  
 
 == Relationship to humans == 
 Many serrasalmids are in demand as aquarium ornamentals, and several such as ''Piaractus'' and ''Colossoma'', are economically important to commercial fisheries and aquaculture. 
 
 Piranhas are generally less valued, although they are commonly consumed by subsistence fishers and frequently sold for food in local markets.
