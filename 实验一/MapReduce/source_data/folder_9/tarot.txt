 The '''Tarot''' (often '''Tarot cards''') are a set of seventy-eight cards, comprising twenty-two [[Major Arcana|Тrump cards]], and four [[Suit (cards)|suits]] of fourteen cards each with four [[Face card]]s. In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, Tarot cards are mostly used for [[divination]]. Tarot cards are also used in many [[Europe|European]] countries for playing trick taking [[card games]]. [[Cartomancy]] is to use Tarot cards for divination. 
 
 Tarot decks did not come before decks having four suits of the same length. They were invented not for [[occult]] purposes but purely for gaming. In 1781, [[Antoine Court de Gébelin|Court de Gébelin]] published an essay associating the cards with ancient wisdom. This idea was later disproved by [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]]. Tarot cards have been used for [[cartomancy]] and [[divination]] as well as gaming.  Nowadays fortune-tellers tend to use specially-developed tarot decks rather than those used for games. Not just the cards but now there are several websites available online where people go to get their answers. They simply put the data on the lucky wheel and it starts spinning. When it stops, the people know what's written in the cards for them.  
 
 Many websites offer tarot definitions.
