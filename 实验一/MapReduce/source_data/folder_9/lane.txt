 A '''lane''' is a part of a [[highway]] that can be used by one line of [[vehicle]]s. Most [[road]]s have two or more lanes, with at least one lane for [[traffic]] going each way. In [[Great Britain]] a narrow [[wikt:rural|rural]] road is called a lane. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lane |title=lane |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries/Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 August 2015 |archive-date=8 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208215956/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lane |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Some roads have a center lane to make it easier for [[car]]s and [[truck]]s to turn. There can also be turn lanes on the outer part of the road. If roads have more than one lane going in one direction, cars in the outer lanes usually go faster than cars in the inner lanes. Highways may also have [[express lane]]s that can only be used for certain types of vehicles, like those carrying two or more people. Lanes in most [[jurisdiction]]s have rules for [[wikt:minimum|minimum]] and [[wikt:maximum|maximum]] lane widths. In the [[United States]] the [[Federal Highway Administration]] has recommended lane widths for US highways and [[Interstate Highway System|interstates]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/geometric/pubs/mitigationstrategies/chapter3/3_lanewidth.cfm |title=Lane Width |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=21 August 2015}} < /ref >
