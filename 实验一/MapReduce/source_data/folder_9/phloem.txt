In [[vascular plant]]s, '''phloem''' is the living [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] made up of small tubes which carry watery [[sap]] containing [[sugar]] and other [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[nutrient]]s to all parts of the plant where the nutrients are used for growth, or stored until needed. The sugar is made by [[photosynthesis]]. In [[tree]]s, the phloem is the innermost layer of the [[bark]], therefore the name, that comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word φλοιος (''phloios'') for  " bark " .  
 
 [[Aphid]]s (greenfly) and other [[insect]]s feed on the phloem by inserting a fine tube into the plant, penetrating the tiny phloem cells deep within the plant. The high pressure in the phloem tubes forces the phloem sap into the insect.  Most of the sugar passes right through the insect, so that nearby surfaces get sticky and often become black due to the growth of [[fungus]]. 
    
 Water, which is absorbed by the plant's [[roots]], travels up the stem to the leaf through the [[xylem]]. This means that the xylem helps during [[photosynthesis]] by bringing water up the plant. It does the same job that [[blood vessel]] < nowiki/ > s do in animals.
