{{wiktionary|sovereignty}} 
 '''Sovereignty''' is the right of a [[government]] to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as [[Ancient Greece]] if not older. 
 
 The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the [[Peace of Westphalia]], an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said: 
 * No one should try to help break up one sovereign government into more than one. 
 * No one should cross over into the land, water, or air where the international law says a government is sovereign, unless they have agreement from that sovereign government. 
 * A sovereign government is the only maker of laws in the land, water or air where international law says it is sovereign. 
 
 ==The Past== 
 ===Ancient Rome=== 
 Ancient Rome was first the [[Roman Republic]], but then when [[Octavian]] made the [[Roman Empire]] the [[Emperor]] of Rome said that he was  " Sovereign " . The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself. 
 
 ===Middle Ages=== 
 In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Pope]]. Because of this, the idea of  " Sovereignty "  was not much used. 
 
 ===Reformation=== 
 In the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The [[English Civil War]] is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country. 
 
 The [[Peace of Westphalia]] was made in 1648 and the idea of  " Sovereignty "  came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The [[divine right of kings]] became more widespread. 
 
 ===The Enlightenment and [[Social Contract]] theory=== 
 The English thinker [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are  " Sovereign "  because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes. 
 
 [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from. 
 
 Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a  " [[Social Contract]] "  in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their [[liberty]] for [[security]] 
 
 In 1789 the [[French Revolution]] made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the [[Middle Ages]] (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for [[Democracy]] in 1870's. In England, many people got to [[vote]] after [[The Reform Act]] in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time. 
 
 ==Present== 
 ===Between Countries=== 
 " Sovereignty "  when talking about relations between countries mostly means the rights a [[Sovereign state]] has over its territory. 
 
 Sometimes there is discussion about when a government loses Sovereignty because it is doing bad things for its people. In this case justice may mean other countries need to intrude on the sovereignty of the government. 
 
 ===Inside a Country=== 
 " Sovereignty "  when talking about relations between groups inside one country usually means which group has the [[Legitimacy]] to rule. This may not be certain. Sometimes the group who is most able to rule (because of a strong military) is not [[Legitimacy|Legitimate]].
