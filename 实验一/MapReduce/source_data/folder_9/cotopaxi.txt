 '''Mount Cotopaxi''' is a [[volcano]] in [[Ecuador]]. The [[mountain]]'s [[altitude]] (height) is {{convert|5911|m|abbr=off}}. That is high enough for [[snow]] to fall on it, even though it is near the [[equator]] (a very [[heat|warm]] part of the world). If the volcano erupted, it would be very bad for the people living around it because of the destruction and damage it could cause. 
 
 '''Cotopaxi''' began showing new activity. As of 25 June 2015, it was under active watch by the [[National Polytechnic School]] Geophysics Institute. < ref > [https://www.wired.com/2015/06/restless-volcano-puts-ecuador-edge/   A RESTLESS VOLCANO PUTS ECUADOR ON EDGE ONCE MORE] ''Wired''. < /ref > 
 
 The Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in [[Quito]] houses an international team of [[seismology|seismologists]] and [[Volcanology|volcanologists]] whose responsibility is to monitor [[Ecuador]]s numerous active [[volcanoes]] 
 and the constant [[seismology|seismic activity]] in the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] and the Galapagos Islands. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://dutchsinse.com/6172015-ecuadors-cotopaxi-volcano-could-soon-erupt-last-eruption-in-1904-111-years-ago/ |title=ECUADORS COTOPAXI VOLCANO COULD SOON ERUPT — LAST ERUPTION IN 1904 .. 111 YEARS AGO |access-date=2015-07-24 |archive-date=2015-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624180056/http://dutchsinse.com/6172015-ecuadors-cotopaxi-volcano-could-soon-erupt-last-eruption-in-1904-111-years-ago/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [https://volcanocafe.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/cotopaxi-a-most-dangerous-volcano/ Cotopaxi – A most dangerous volcano] < /ref >
