'''Serotonin''' is a [[neurotransmitter]]. Its chemical name is '''5-Hydroxytryptamine''' or '''5-HT'''. It is derived from [[tryptophan]]. Serotonin is found in all [[vertebrate]]s, mainly in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], blood [[platelet]]s and [[central nervous system]]. Its name is derived from its effect on [[blood pressure]]: serotonin is a part of the ''[[serum]]'' which regulates the ''tonus'' of [[blood vessel]]s. 
 
 Serotonin does several jobs within the human body. Unlike [[dopamine]], serotonin causes [[happiness]], while dopamine causes [[pleasure]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Kauper|first=Gabriel|title=Happiness vs. Pleasure and Why it Matters at Work|url=https://blog.deliveringhappiness.com/the-difference-between-happiness-vs.-pleasure-and-why-it-matters-at-work|access-date=2022-03-19|website=blog.deliveringhappiness.com|language=en-us}} < /ref >  It is believed to regulate mood, intestinal activity and appetite, memory, and sleep. Many [[antidepressant]] medications are thought to work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the body. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825|title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Stahl|first=S.

 Serotonin is also found in insect venom, [[fungi]] and [[plant]]s. < ref name= " pmid19308403 " > {{cite journal|author = Kang K, Park S, Kim YS, Lee S, Back K|title = Biosynthesis and biotechnological production of serotonin derivatives|journal = Appl.

 Serotonin is involved in social rank. A lobster injected with serotonin behaves like an [[alpha male]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/241/4874/1775|title=Hormonal control of behavior: amines and the biasing of behavioral output in lobsters|first=E.
