 The '''hammerjaw''' (''Omosudis lowii'') is a small deep-sea [[fish]] found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters to 4,000 m (13,000 ft) depth. It is the only member of its [[Family (biology)|family]], '''Omosudidae'''. These creatures are prey of lancetfish and tuna. 
 
 == Description == 
 It resembles a small [[viperfish]]. The large head is dominated by a massive, truncated lower [[jaw]] and large, creepy [[Eye|eyes]]. The lower jaw has a black chin. Its mouth is quite scary because of its oversized, transparent, and dagger-like [[Tooth|teeth]]; the [[Palatine bone|palatine bones]] possess 1â€“4 pairs of slightly smaller teeth. 
 
 == Life history == 
 Very little is known of the hammerjaw's life history. 
 
 === How they swim ===

 It is inferred from their sporadic capture and sleek morphology that hammerjaws are swift swimmers, which makes them impossible for you to catch. 
 
 === Diet === 
 They are carnivorous and feed on squid and others.
