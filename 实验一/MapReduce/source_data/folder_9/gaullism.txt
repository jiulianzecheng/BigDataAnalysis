 '''Gaullism''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Gaullisme}}) is a French political term of people who support the ideas and presidency of [[World War II]] [[French Resistance]] leader General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. 
 
 Gaullism cannot be seen within a [[political ideology]], meaning it is not [[Left-wing politics|left]] or [[Right-wing politics|right]]. It is more of how the [[President of France]] should use their power. 
 
 " Neo-Gaullism "  has been used to describe a movement after the death of de Gaulle in 1970 from people who are [[economic liberal]] than both traditional and social Gaullism. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Berstein|first=Serge|title=Histoire du gaullisme|date=2001a|publisher=Perrin|isbn=2-262-01155-9|page=370|oclc=407137019|author-link=Serge Berstein}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Tiersky|first1=Ronald|date=1996|title=A Likely Story: Chirac, France-NATO, European Security, and American Hegemony|journal=French Politics and Society|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–8|jstor=42844543|issn=0882-1267}} < /ref >
