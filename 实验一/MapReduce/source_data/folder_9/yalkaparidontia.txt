'''''Yalkaparidon''''' is an extinct genus of Australian marsupials, first described in 1988 and known only from the Oligo-Miocene deposits of Riversleigh, northwestern [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. 
 
 A detailed study on its morphology, including newly-referred tarsal material published in 2014 found that it was likely a crown group marsupial, < ref name= " Schweitzer Online " > {{cite web|url=http://content.schweitzer-online.de/static/catalog_manager/live/media_files/representation/zd_std_orig__zd_schw_orig/002/207/413/9780521650748_content_pdf_1.pdf|access-date=5 May 2021|title=The evolution and classification of marsupials|archive-date=5 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505232231/http://content.schweitzer-online.de/static/catalog_manager/live/media_files/representation/zd_std_orig__zd_schw_orig/002/207/413/9780521650748_content_pdf_1.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and probably an australidelphian, but its unusual morphology made its precise placement uncertain.
