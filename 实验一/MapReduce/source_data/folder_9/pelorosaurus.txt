 '''''Pelorosaurus conybeari''''' is the name given to a few [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] bones from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period, about 138–112 million years ago.  
 
 Bones of ''Pelorosaurus'' have been found in [[England]] and [[Portugal]]. It was a [[Brachiosaur]], with front legs that were longer than its hind legs.  
 
 The name has been challenged, and has been the subject of long-lasting dispute. Some palaeontologists prefer the name '''''Cetiosaurus brevis'''''. < ref > Mantell G.A. 1850.

 The taxonomic status of ''Pelorosaurus'' is as a result very problematic. Technically, ''Cetiosaurus brevis'' is its type species. The position of ''Pelorosaurus'' is further undermined by the fact that several researchers hold that the [[genus]] is a ''nomen dubium'' ('doubtful name'). 
 
 ''Pelorosaurus'' was one of the first dinosaurs described, and the naming procedures were not so well-developed at the time. Its life-style is assumed to be similar to other brachiosaurs, eating from the higher branches of tall [[conifer]] trees.
