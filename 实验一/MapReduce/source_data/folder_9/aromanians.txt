 The '''Aromanians''' ({{lang-rup|Armãnji, Rrãmãnji}}) are an [[Ethnic groups in Europe|ethnic group]] who speak an [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance language]] and are native to the southern [[Balkans]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Mantouvalos|2017|loc=p. 30:  " The Aromanians (Vlachs) are a Latin-speaking ethnic group native to the southern Balkans. " }} < /ref >  There are several [[Theory|theories]] about them. < ref name=Binder/ >  The strongest theory < ref name=Binder/ >  says that they are [[descendant]]s of [[Latin|Latin-speaking]] [[Greeks]] from areas of [[Ancient Greece]] like [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Liakos|1965}}. < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Charanis|1976|loc=p. 16:  " [A]ccording to one scholar, Latin had made such an inroad into Macedonia that that province had become perhaps bilingual. This lends some support to the view held by Greek scholars, that the Vlachs now in that country are actually the descendants of Latinized Macedonians and as a consequence Greeks by origin. " }} < /ref > < ref name=Binder > {{harvnb|Binder|2004|pp=115–116:  " Vlachs are sometimes assumed to be the Romanized descendants of autochthonous ethnic groups, the Illyrians, Thracians, Dacians and Greeks, though the Greek connection is undoubtedly the strongest. Oddly perhaps, the denomination ''Vlach'', by which they are most widely known, is plainly not of Vlach origin, coming, as far as scholars of linguistics can determine, either from Celtic or Germanic roots (variously Welsh or Welsch). Vlachs generally refer to themselves among themselves as Aromani (or Arumani).
