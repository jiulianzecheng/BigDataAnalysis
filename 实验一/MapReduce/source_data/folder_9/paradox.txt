 [[File:Pinocchio paradox.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinocchio paradox]] is a variant of the [[Liar paradox]]]] 
 
 A '''paradox''' is a sentence in [[logic]] that cannot be [[true]] but also cannot be [[false]]. It is self-contradictory. Many famous problems of this kind exist. 
 ==Liar's paradox== 
 A famous paradox is called the '''liar's paradox'''. It is the [[simple sentence]]  " This sentence is a [[lying|lie]] " , or equivalently,  " This statement is false. " < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-08-01|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 If the sentence is true, then it is a lie as it says.  But if it is a lie, it cannot be true. A lie cannot also be a [[truth]]. So the sentence being true makes it a lie. 
 
 On the other hand, if the sentence is a lie, then it is not as it says: it is true.  But that is just what the sentence says, which makes the content of the sentence true.  So the sentence being a lie makes it true. 
 
 This paradox is not just in English, but in any language. It is true of [[mathematics]] as well.  Paradox can never be removed from any [[symbol]] system that makes claims about itself. 
 ==Other examples== 
 Another example is the statement that  " there is no cabal " .  Only a [[cabal]] can know if there is no cabal, so this is either a guess, or, it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist. 
 
 Not all paradoxes are true logical paradoxes, since they can also be common-sense-defying statements that appear true. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Definition of PARADOX|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradox|access-date=2020-10-08|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}} < /ref >  Some famous examples of this kind of paradox include: 
 * [[Zeno's paradoxes]] of [[motion (physics)|motion]] 
 * [[Simpson's paradox]] in [[statistics]] 
 * [[Grandfather paradox]] 
 *[[Banach–Tarski paradox]] 
 
 == Quine's classification == 
 [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] did a classification of [[Paradox|paradoxes]]. He found three different types: < ref > {{cite book|title=The Ways of Paradox, and other essays|last1=Quine|first1=W.V.|publisher=Random House|year=1966|isbn=9780674948358|location=New York|chapter=The ways of paradox|author-link=W.V.

 * A '''veridical paradox'''  produces a result that looks absurd, but that can be proved to be true. In the opera ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]],'' shows that a 21 year old, who was born on a [[leap day]] only had fice birthdays. Other examples are  [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] that demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting results to the will of the people. [[Monty Hall paradox]] (or equivalently [[three prisoners problem]]) that demonstrates that a decision that has an intuitive fifty–fifty chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision that, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make. In 20th-century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]], [[Schrödinger's cat]], [[Wigner's friend]] or the [[Ugly duckling theorem]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end. 
 * A '''falsidical paradox''' gives a result that is false. This is because there was a fallacy in the demostration. Examples are [[All horses are the same color]], or [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. 
 * A third class are those paradoxes that reach a contradicotry result; they are true and false at the same time.  Anb example of this is the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]]. 
 
 == Informal uses of  " paradox "  == 
 A paradox can also arise in [[ethics]]. Assuming [[Influence|power]] over others may sometimes be required to protect them while diminishing their right to autonomy. This is an ethical [[dilemma]] but ''not'' a logical paradox.
