 '''Diving''' is a form of [[movement]] downwards, either from [[air]] to [[ground]] or to [[water]]. Diving is also a [[sport]]. Diving is often done from a [[spring]][[Board (wood)|board]] or an [[height|elevated]] platform.  
 
 [[Underwater diving]] includes [[Scuba]] diving. Scuba diving, however, is typically not considered a sport. Dives used for scuba diving are relatively simplistic. An example of this is a giant stride entry, also known as a stride dive. 
 
 ==Diving in water== 
 There are six different [[type]]s of dives, and four different [[body]] [[position]]s that a person can use when diving.  
 
 ===Types of dives === 
 There are six different types of dives. Four of the types depend on whether the diver is facing towards the water or away from the water, and if they [[rotation|rotate]] towards or away from the water. The other two dives can be a part of the first four. For example, a diver can do a  " inward twisting "  or a  " forward armstand "  dive. The basic types of dives are: 
 *Forward – The diver faces towards the water and [[rotation|rotates]] forward. 
 *Backward – The diver stands with their back towards the water and rotates backwards, away from the board. 
 *Reverse – The diver faces towards the water and rotates backwards, towards the board. 
 *Inward – The diver faces away from the water and rotates forward, towards the board. 
 *Twisting – A twisting dive is any of the other dives in which the diver twists their body to the left or right.  
 *Armstand – An armstand dive is where the diver begins the dive from a handstand position. They are not standing on their [[feet]] at the beginning of this type of dive. 
 
 ===Body positions=== 
 The four different body positions are tuck, pike, straight and free.  
 *Tuck – The body is bent at the [[waist]] and [[knee]]s. The thighs are close to the [[chest]] and the [[heel]]s of the feet are close to the [[buttock]]s. 
 *Pike – The diver's [[leg]]s are straight. Their body is bent at the waist. The position of the [[arm]]s is chosen by the diver. They are often pointed towards the [[toe]]s. 
 *Straight – There is no bend in the body at all. There could be a small [[arch]] of the back depending on the type of dive.  
 *Free – The free position is not an actual body position. It is where the diver uses more than one position. It is usually used when doing a dive with a [[somersault]] or a twist in it 
 
 ===Dive Numbers=== 
 Dives are put into categories, based on the Direction the dive is in, and what Position it is in. 
 *100's=Forward 
 *200's=Backward 
 *300's=Reverse 
 *400's=Inward 
 *A-Straight 
 *B-Pike 
 *C-Tuck 
 *D-Free 
 Every Half flip the number on the end goes up by one 
 For example: *Front dive Tuck is a 101c
