 '''Witchcraft''' is the use of magical powers.  This might be for healing, seeing into the future, causing harm, or for religion.  A person practicing witchcraft is called a witch, although a man practicing witchcraft is often mistakenly called a wizard (a word from Northern [[Europe]]), a warlock (a word from 14th century England < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/warlock|title=Definition of WARLOCK|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}} < /ref > ), a sorcerer, or [[Shamanism|shaman]] (a term for people who practice magic in parts of [[Asia]]).  Such people are said to have a knowledge of the [[Chemical substance|chemical]] (or [[Drug|pharmaceutical]]) effects of certain [[herb]]s or shrubs.  Witches can use this knowledge to help people who are sick or to hurt them. 
 
 Witchcraft is different throughout the world and can be seen as good or bad depending on where you are.  Today, many people practice a peaceful kind of witchcraft, called [[Wicca]].  However, there are still many other people who are scared of witchcraft and think that it is bad.  Throughout history, there have been stories about good and bad witches.  
 
 In [[History of Europe|European history]], witches were accused of physically making and performing spells to harm people. They could also harm people by using their mind.  However, this belief was not real and was often used to explain why bad things happened sometimes.  
 
 In [[Africa]], witches don't use physical tools or actions to curse.  They can cause harm by just thinking about it. In fact, one may be unaware of being a witch, or may have been convinced of their witch nature by the [[suggestion]] of others.  This understanding was described by [[anthropologist]] [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], who studied African magical beliefs. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/850849210|title=Witchcraft, oracles and magic among the azande|last=Evans-Pritchard, E. E.

 == Accusations of Witchcraft == 
 [[Éva Pócs]] (a scholar and [[Folklore|folklorist]]) states that there are four reasons a person is accused of witchcraft: < ref name= " Pócs " > {{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7765/9781526137975.00013|title=Witchcraft Continued|last=Pócs|first=Éva|date=2018-07-30|publisher=Manchester University Press|doi=10.7765/9781526137975.00013|isbn=9781526137975|s2cid=171992924}} < /ref > 
 
 # A person was caught in the act of positive or negative witchcraft (performing a spell) 
 # A well-meaning [[Homeopathy|healer]] lost the trust of their clients' or the [[Police|authoritie]]s' 
 # A person seemed dangerous and made their neighbors scared 
 # A person was [[rumor]]ed to be a witch and surrounded with an [[aura (paranormal)|aura]] of witch-beliefs or [[Occult]]ism 
 
 She identifies three kinds of witches in popular belief: < ref name= " Pócs " / > 
 
 # The  " [[Neighbourhood|neighborhood]] witch "  or  " [[social]] witch " : a witch who [[curse]]s a neighbor following some [[conflict]]. 
 # The  " magical "  or  " sorcerer "  witch: either a professional [[Homeopathy|healer]], sorcerer, seer or [[midwife]], or a person who has, through magic, increased their [[Luck|fortune]] but caused harm to someone in doing so; due to community [[rival]]ries and the hard to recognize nature between good and bad magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches. 
 # The  " [[Supernatural|supernatura]] < nowiki/ > l "  or  " night "  witch: portrayed in court narratives as a [[demon]] appearing in visions and [[dream]]s. 
 
 " Neighbourhood witches "  are the product of neighbourhood arguments, and are found only in [[Rural area|rural]] village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal [[Trade|exchange]] could potentially be accused. Claims of  " sorcerer "  witches and  " supernatural "  witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with community [[conflict]], but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Balkans|Southeastern Europe]] such supernatural witches became an [[ideology]] explaining calamities that befell entire communities. < ref name= " Pócs " / > 
 
 == Practices == 
 It is believed that witches can perform magic by using [[Herb|plants]], casting spells, or [[Telepathy|using their mind]]. The use of plants is often called [[herbalism]] and this involves collecting or growing herbs to use in potions or [[medicine]]s to help or hurt people, animals, or things. 
 
 In popular artwork, witches can be seen using big metal cooking bowls called [[cauldron]]s to mix their spell ingredients. Witches also use wands, [[broom]]s, sticks, [[candle]]s, [[sword]]s, and fire to perform spells. 
 
 In some cultures, witches can harm people just by [[Telepathy|using their mind]] and thinking bad thoughts about a person. In these cultures, witches do not need any items and can potentially be anyone in the community. 
 
 == By Region == 
 === Africa === 
 In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. 
 
 # The '' < u > tagati < /u > '' is often poorly translated into English as  " witch " , and is a spiteful person who works in secret to harm others. 
 # The '' < u > sangoma < /u > '' is a [[divine]]r, similar to a fortune teller, and is hired to detect illness, predict a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. 
 # The '' < u > inyanga < /u > '' is often translated as  " witch doctor "  (though many Southern Africans do not like this description as it implies that a  " witch doctor "  is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of evil magic). The ''inyanga'' < nowiki/ > 's job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. 
 
 Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male. Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been misunderstood and mistaken for European witchcraft. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|date=2013|title=Postcolonial Discourses and the Equivocation of Expertise|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5840/philafricana20131524|journal=Philosophia Africana|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–116|doi=10.5840/philafricana20131524|issn=1539-8250}} < /ref >  African scholar Uchenna Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African, rather than Western view. 
 
 === America === 
 When the first Europeans came to the [[New World]], they brought with them the [[Christian|Christian religion]] and their fear of supernatural witches. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Emerson W.

 }} < /ref >  [[Native American]]s had their own religion and beliefs. Since the Christian European settlers were living with these Native Americans and also [[African slave trade|African slaves]] (who had their own non-Christian religions and beliefs), this scared them. The Europeans were already scared, far away from their home in the New World with different plants and animals. This fear lead to violent crimes such as accusing and murdering people who they thought were witches and were hurting them with supernatural powers. 
 
 The most famous witch accusations were the 1692-1693 [[Salem Witch Trials|Salem Witch trials]]. During these trials, 150 people were accused of being witches, and 19 people were killed by [[hanging (death)|hanging]]. Every [[Halloween]] season, [[Salem, Massachusetts]] hosts a Halloween festival in which they highlight their towns notorious history with the 1692 [[Salem Witch Trials|Salem Witch trials]]. This festival often involves live music, parties, and vendors selling witch-themed items. 
 
 Throughout the world there are many people who claim to have supernatural powers such as; [[psychic]]s, [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]], [[Palm reading|palm readers]] and [[New Age|New Age healers]]. These people are sometimes members of witchcraft religions like [[Wicca]]. These people perform tricks to entertain and heal people such as [[Tarot|tarot card]] reading, [[astrology]], [[Crystal|crystal healing]], [[Reiki (era)|Reiki]] healing, talking to dead family members, or seeing the future. 
 
 === Asia === 
 ==== Middle east ==== 
 The belief in witchcraft and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile|Nile Valley.]] It played a clear role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. Later tradition included an [[Akkad]]ian anti-witchcraft [[ritual]], the Maqlû. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes: < blockquote > If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH;+WITCHCRAFT/|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Witchcraft|access-date=2019-04-22|archive-date=2019-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024000347/https://www.bible-history.com/isbe/w/witch;+witchcraft/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < /blockquote > 
 
 === Europe === 
 ==== Ancient Greece ==== 
 There are many examples of witches in Greek mythology, such as Circe, who was a sorcerer in Homers’ Odyssey. Circe used potions to put spells on visitors to her house, and she could turn people into pigs. 
 
 ==== Ancient Ireland ==== 
 Druids were members of the high-ranking professional [[Social class|class]] in [[Celts|ancient Celtic]] cultures. They were religious leaders, [[legal]] authorities, [[adjudicator]]s, [[Folklore|lorekeepers]], [[Physician|medical professionals]], and [[Advisor|political advisors]] 
 
 The earliest record of the druids comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] texts from [[circa]] 300 BCE: one, a history of philosophy written by [[Sotion of Alexandria]], and the other a study of magic widely attributed to [[Aristotle]]. Both texts are now lost, but were quoted in the 2nd century CE work ''Vitae'' by Diogenes Laërtius. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|last=Diogenes Laertius|editor1-first=Miroslav|editor1-last=Marcovich|date=2002-01-31|title=Diogenis Laertii Vitae philosophorum, Volume III, Indices|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110961072|doi=10.1515/9783110961072|isbn=978-3-598-71319-4}} < /ref > < blockquote > Some say that the study of philosophy originated with the barbarians. In that among the Persians there existed the Magi, and among the Babylonians or Assyrians the Chaldaei, among the Indians the Gymnosophistae, and among the Celts and Gauls men who were called druids and semnothei, as Aristotle relates in his book on magic, and Sotion in the twenty-third book of his Succession of Philosophers. 
 
 - Diogenes Laërtius,  Vitae, Introduction, Section 1 < ref name= " :0 "  / > < /blockquote > Later Greek and [[Roman]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2022}} texts from the third century BCE refer to  " barbarian philosophers " , possibly in reference to the [[Gaul]]ish druids. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 ==== Middle Ages ==== 
 In Medieval times, witchcraft gradually became an enemy of Christianity. Christians thought that witchcraft was the work of the devil, and the Bible was used as evidence against witchcraft. Verses such as Deuteronomy 18:11–12 and Exodus 22:18 ( " Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live " ) were very influential. 
 
 In Europe in the Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, [[Catholics]], [[Protestants]], and state leaders became very afraid of the power of witches. There were large witch-hunts in many places. People believed that the devil was using witches to try to overthrow Christianity, so tens or hundreds of thousands of people were killed, and others were put in prison, tortured, and had lands and possessions taken away from them. Most of these witches were women, because people believed women were more likely to be witches. 
 
 Witch-trials looked for evidence to prove that a person was a witch. Evidence included such things as signs of plant medicine, or images of non-Christian gods. One way to physically test if a person was a witch was to 'swim a witch'. This meant they would throw them in a river with their hands tied. If they sank, they were innocent. If they floated, they were guilty of witchcraft and were hanged. This violent practice was not based on any actual evidence. Instead, it allowed the witch-hunter to look right and powerful for the scared people who were watching. 
 
 === South America === 
 In [[South America]], people continue to practice a form of witchcraft which started before the arrival of European Christianity. Throughout the [[Andes]], there are many places called witch markets, such as the [[Mercado de las Brujas]] in [[La Paz, Bolivia]]. These markets sell items such as plant medicines 
 
 == Popular culture == 
 Witches are often seen in art and cinema.  Many movies have focused on witches and witchcraft such as; ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', [[the Wizard of Oz]], ''[[Hocus Pocus (movie)|Hocus Pocus]]'', and ''[[Rosemary's Baby]]''.  Many television shows also have witches and witchcraft.  Some examples are: [[Charmed]] (1998 and [[:en:Charmed_(2018_TV_series)|2018]]), [[American Horror Story|American Horror Story: Coven]], and [[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]].
