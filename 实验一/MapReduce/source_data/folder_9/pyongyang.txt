 '''Pyŏngyang''' (평양 직할시 in [[hangul]], 平壤直轄市 in [[hanja]]) is the capital and biggest city in [[North Korea]]. The [[government]] does not want people from outside the country to know anything about North Korea, so Pyongyang is one of the few places in North Korea that people from other countries can travel to. 
 
 ==Entry== 
 Pyongyang is a closed city meaning that North Koreans can't just go there. They must apply for a permit or be high up in the [[military]]. It is the most advanced city in the country which allows tourists to go there. Pyongyang does not really show what North Korea is really like, because the government uses it to pretend to tourists that the country is not poor. The city is kept very clean and littering is strictly not allowed. The city is home to the DPRK's only [[fast food]] [[restaurant]] which only the most privileged North Koreans go to (a meal would be worth around a weeks wages for the average person there). Many shops there have [[plastic]] food on display in the windows to make tourists think that there is lots of food in the country when in fact, food is scarce.  
 
 ==Attractions== 
 The city has lots of nice attractions like the statues of [[Kim Il-Sung]] and [[Kim Jong-Il]] at Mansudae hill. The [[Juche Tower|Juche tower]] is one of the most recognisable landmarks in the country, towering over the Taedong River across from [[Kim Il-sung Square|Kim Il-Sung square]]. It also has the world's deepest subway system. Pyongyang has many large parks and wide avenues as well as the [[List of association football stadiums by capacity|largest sports stadium in the world]], the [[Rungrado May Day Stadium]]. The city is also the location of the embalmed bodies of the two leaders, Il-Sung and Jong-Il in the Kumsusan Palace of the sun. 
 
 Pyongyang is home to the 105-story hotel, Ryugyong Hotel. The construction started in [[1987]] and the exterior was completed twenty-four years later in [[2011]]. It was originally intended as a propaganda device to make North Korea look wealthy when a South Korean recently built the world's then-tallest building. The hotel to this day remains empty and unopened. 
 
 The population of Pyongyang is 3,255,388.
