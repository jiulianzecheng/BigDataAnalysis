 A '''Fluffernutter''' is a [[sandwich]] made with [[peanut butter]] and [[marshmallow creme]]. It is usually served on [[white bread]]. Some recipes have [[Brown bread|wheat bread]] instead of white bread. Many sweets and salty, [[Umami|savory]] ingredients can be added for enjoyment. Foods with peanut butter and marshmallow creme can also be called ''fluffernutters''. 
 
 In June 2006, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios proposed an act to stop serving Fluffernutter sandwiches in public [[school]]s. < ref > [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/21/the_war_on_fluffernutter_escalates_in_legislature/ Calloway, LeMont  " The war on Fluffernutter escalates in Legislature "  Boston Globe, June 21, 2006] < /ref > < ref name=fox > {{cite news|last=LeBlanc|first=Steve|title=Fluffernutter Sandwich Angers Mass.

 ==History== 
 One of the main ingredients of the Fluffernutter is Marshmallow Creme. It was invented in the early 20th century by [[Archibald Query]]. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the ''Liberty Sandwich'', which consisted of peanut butter and Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. < ref name=lexicon/ >  The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918. It may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. < ref name=melrose/ >  Earlier labels and booklets by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives. < ref name=melrose > {{cite web|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|title=Fluff? Smac? Marshmallows, made in Melrose?|url=http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353133343838|work=Melrose Mirror|accessdate=3 March 2012|archive-date=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102063239/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353133343838|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Meanwhile, sugar shortages during World War I hurt sales of Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme. Query sold his recipe in 1920 to H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower from [[Swampscott, Massachusetts]]. The two men began selling the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. They renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff. Durkee-Mower continues to sell the product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. < ref name=mit > {{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week: Archibald Query|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/query.html|work=Lemelson-MIT|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=7 March 2012}} < /ref >  The sandwich was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960. < ref name=mit/ > < ref name=lexicon > {{cite book|last=Stern|first=Jane|title=The Lexicon of Real American Food|year=2011|publisher=Lyons press|pages=110|isbn=9780762760947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHBVnMl3nMkC & dq=fluffernutter & pg=PT116|access-date=2017-08-31}}{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  ''Fluffernutter'' is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower. The company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued [[Williams-Sonoma|Williams-Sonoma Inc.]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]], alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the ''Fluffernutter'' name. < ref > {{cite news |title= Williams-Sonoma sued over 'Fluffernutter' |author= |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11728918/ |publisher= [[msnbc.com]] |date= March 8, 2006 |accessdate= September 14, 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 In June 2006, Massachusetts State Senator [[Jarrett Barrios]] gained national attention when he proposed legislation restricting the serving of Fluffernutter sandwiches in public schools. After Barrios learned that his son was served Fluffernutters on a daily basis at his [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], public elementary school, he created an amendment to a junk food bill that aimed to limit the serving of Fluffernutters in Massachusetts public schools to once a week. < ref name=spread/ > < ref name=fox/ >  The proposal was criticized as an example of trivial and overly intrusive legislation, while Barrios' supporters pointed to concerns over the problem of [[childhood obesity]]. < ref name= spread > {{cite news |title= Can this spread be stopped?

 ==In culture== 
 The term ''fluffernutter'' has sometimes been used to describe something that has minimal to no cultural value. < ref > {{cite news|title=Top Picks: 4th of July on PBS, letters to Harry Potter, jazz masters, and more; PBS presents their annual  " A Capitol Fourth "  concert, Harry Potter's fan mail, Sony celebrates 40 years of jazz, and more recommendations.|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=30 June 2011}} < /ref > < ref name=AdAge > {{cite web|last=Louderback|first=Jim|title=There, I Said It: Screw Viral Videos|date=30 August 2010|url=http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/constant-focus-viral-videos-good-ad-industry/145636/|publisher=[[Ad Age]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}} < /ref >  Some writers look at Fluffernutters and marshmallow creme as regional pride. < ref name=spread/ > < ref > {{cite news|title=State Senator Wants Fluff Off School Menus|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/r/9394199/detail.html|accessdate=8 March 2012|newspaper=TheBostonChannel.com|date=19 June 2006}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 The sandwich has close ties to New England, particularly to Somerville, Massachusetts, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow Fluff, and to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. < ref name = statesandwich/ >  Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating Marshmallow Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, [[NASA]] astronaut [[Richard Michael Linnehan]], who was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the [[International Space Station]], acted as one of the contest judges. < ref name=somerville > {{cite news|last=Twardzik|first=Cathleen|title=It's 'What the Fluff?' time again in Somerville|url=http://www.thesomervillenews.com/archives/19137|accessdate=4 March 2012|newspaper=The Somerville News|date=22 September 2011}} < /ref >
