 '''Parrots''' are [[bird]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Psittaciformes'''. There are about 372 [[species]] in 86 [[genera]]. They are found in most [[tropics|tropical]] and subtropical regions. The greatest [[biodiversity|diversity]] of parrots is found in [[South America]] and [[Australasia]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Psittacine |work=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. 4th ed |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2000 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/P0632100.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827104100/http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/P0632100.html |archive-date=2007-08-27 |access-date=2007-09-09}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |title=Psittacine |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psittacine |access-date=25 June 2013}} < /ref > < ref name= " zoonomen " > {{cite web |url=http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/psit.html |title=Zoological Nomenclature Resource: Psittaciformes (Version 9.013) |date=2008-12-29 |publisher=www.zoonomen.net}} < /ref > 
 
 Parrots are intelligent birds. They have relatively large brains, < ref > {{cite news|last=Iwaniuk, Andrew 2004 |title=This bird is no airhead |publisher=Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada | url=http://www.nserc.ca/news/features/parrot_e.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222213812/http://www.nserc.ca/news/features/parrot_e.htm |access-date=2007-09-09|archive-date=2008-02-22 }} < /ref >  they can learn, and they can use simple tools. < ref > {{cite news |last=Beynon, Mike 2000 |title=Who's a clever bird, then? |work=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/132index.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901202329/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/132index.shtml |archive-date=2007-09-01 |access-date=2007-09-09}} < /ref >  Because some species have the ability to make sounds like human voices and have [[plumage]]s with bright colors, many species are kept as [[pet]]s. This includes some [[Endangered species|endangered]] and protected species.  
 
 == Description == 
 They have a compact body with a large head and a short neck. Their [[beak]]s are short, strong and curved. The two parts of the beak are very strong and used to break [[fruit]]s and [[seed]]s. The [[tongue]] is large and strong. Most parrots can fly, though some lost their powers of flight after they came to live on oceanic islands. The [[kakapo]] is an example. 
 
 Parrots have strong legs, and clawed [[zygodactyl]] feet (with two toes facing forward and two toes facing back) that are very useful to climb up trees. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. The plumage of cockatoos ranges from mostly white to mostly black, with a mobile [[Crest (feathers)|crest]] of feathers on the tops of their heads.  Most parrots exhibit little or no [[Sexual dimorphism#Birds|sexual dimorphism]]. 
 
 Parrots are variably-sized. The smallest parrot is the [[Buff-faced pygmy parrot|pigmy parrot]] (''Micropsitta pusio'') with an adult weight of {{convert|11.5|g|oz}} and a length of {{convert|8.6|cm|in}}. < ref name=forsh >

 == Behavior == 
 [[File:Sunconurepuzzle.jpg|thumb|Parrot demonstrating its puzzle-solving skills]] 
 
 Parrots eat seeds, [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, [[bud]]s and other plant material. A few species sometimes eat animals and [[carrion]] (dead animal carcasses), while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on [[flower|floral]] [[nectar]] and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in [[tree hollow]]s, and lay white [[Cleidoic egg|eggs]] from which hatch [[altricial]] (helpless) young. 
 
 Parrots are among the most intelligent birds. The ability of some parrots to make sounds like human voices makes them popular as [[pet]]s. 
 
 == Conservation == 
 The capture of wild parrots for the [[pet]] [[trade]], as well as [[hunting]], [[habitat loss]] and [[competition (biology)|competition]] from [[invasive species]], has diminished wild populations, with parrots  being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds. < ref > Snyder N ''et al'' 2000. [http://www.parrots.org/index.php/ourpublication/papfiles/ Parrots: status survey and conservation action plan, 2000-2004]. Chapter 1. vii. [[IUCN]] {{ISBN|2-8317-0504-5}}. Chapter 1. vii. < /ref >   Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile  species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same [[ecosystem]]s. < ref name= " Chapter2p12 " > Snyder N. ''et al'' 2000. [http://www.parrots.org/index.php/ourpublication/papfiles/ Parrots: status survey and conservation action plan, 2000-2004]. Chapter 1. vii. [[IUCN]] {{ISBN|2-8317-0504-5}}. Chapter 2. page 12. < /ref > 
 
 Some parrots can live up to 80 years. Many parrots can imitate [[human]] [[speech]]; they can speak simple words if repeated a few times. 
 
 == Origins and evolution == 
 [[Transposon]]s in the [[genome]]s of [[passerine]]s and parrots are similar, but those in the genomes of other birds are not. This is strong evidence that parrots are the [[sister group]] of passerines. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Suh A, Paus M, Kiefmann M |display-authors = etal |title=Mesozoic retroposons reveal parrots as the closest living relatives of passerine birds |journal=Nature Communications |volume=2|pages=443–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21863010 |doi=10.1038/ncomms1448 |pmc=3265382 |issue=8|bibcode = 2011NatCo...2..443S }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Europe]] is the origin of the first presumed parrot [[fossil]]s, which date from about 50 million years ago (mya). < ref > {{cite journal |last=Waterhouse |first=David M. |year=2006 |title=Parrots in a nutshell: The fossil record of Psittaciformes (Aves) |journal=Historical Biology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=223–234 |doi=10.1080/08912960600641224|s2cid=83664072 }} < /ref >  The climate there and then was tropical. Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like birds have been found in [[England]] and [[Germany]]. < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1475-4983.00126 | last1 = Dyke | first1 = GJ | last2 = Cooper | first2 = JH | year = 2000 | title = A new psittaciform bird from the London clay (Lower Eocene) of England | journal = Palaeontology | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 271–285 | s2cid = 84812434 }} < /ref >  On the whole it seems likely that these are not direct ancestors of the modern parrots, but related lineages which evolved in the [[northern hemisphere]], and which have since died out. 
 
 The earliest records of modern parrots date to about 23–20 mya and are also from Europe. Subsequently, the fossil record—again mainly from Europe—consists of bones clearly recognisable as belonging to parrots of modern type. The [[southern hemisphere]] does not have nearly as rich a fossil record for this period as the northern, and contains no known parrot-like remains earlier than the early to middle [[Miocene]], around 20 mya. The first unambiguous parrot fossil (as opposed to a parrot-like one) is found in the Miocene. It is an upper jaw, identical that of modern [[cockatoo]]s.
