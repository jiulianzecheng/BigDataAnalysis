 '''''Tullimonstrum''''', colloquially known as the '''Tully Monster''', is an extinct [[bilateria]]n [[animal]] that lived in shallow tropical coastal waters of muddy [[estuary|estuaries]] during the [[Pennsylvanian]] geological period, about 300 million years ago. A single species, T. gregarium, is known. Its classification has been the subject of controversy, and interpretations of the fossil likened it to [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[conodont]]s, [[worm]]s, and [[vertebrate]]s. It is unknown whether ''Tullimonstrum'' was a [[vertebrate]] or an [[invertebrate]].
