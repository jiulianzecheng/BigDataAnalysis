The [[website|official website]] has more [[wikt:information|information]] about its [[ingredient]]s. Kinnie may owe its [[Bitterness|bitter]][[sweetness|sweet]] taste to a blend of ''Mediterranean [[chinotto]] bitter [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]''. It may be combined with a dozen different [[wikt:aroma|aroma]]tic [[herb]]s and [[spices]]. These include [[anise]], [[ginseng]], [[vanilla]], [[rhubarb]] and [[liquorice]]. A sales slogan was:  " The problem with drinking kinnie is that you just can not get enough " .{{fact|date=May 2015}}
