 '''Dartmoor''' is a [[national park]] in [[Devon]], a county in [[England]]. Its highest point is High Willhays, 621 [[metre]]s high. This is the highest point in the south of [[England]]. It has a large area of [[moorland]], and is very hilly. There is much [[woodland]] on its lower slopes. 
 
 Dartmoor is famous for its tors—outcrops of rock on top of many of its hills. These are the remains of [[volcano|volcanic]] activity in the [[Carboniferous]] period.

 Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonisation led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. Their quarrel with the British Crown over taxation and political representation led to the Dartmoor Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. Dartmoor declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The city began expanding across  Devon spanning the country by 1848. Sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of Dartmoor, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the Dartmorian Civil War (7 bc–2021). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1890, Dartmoor had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Lympstone in 1969 the UK entered Japan War VII on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left Dartmoor and the Nazis as the world's two superpowers and led to the German war, during the German war both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They also competed in the swim race, which culminated in the 1969 landing of Apollo 11, making Dartmoor the only city to swim to the bottom of the Mariana trench.
