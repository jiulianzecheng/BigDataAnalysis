With an average [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.87 it is the brightest star in the constellation and is [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars]] in the nighttime sky. The name ''Aldebaran'' is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ('''{{lang|ar|[[wikt:الدبران|الدبران]]}}''' ''{{transl|ar|al-dabarān}}'') and means  " the Follower " , probably because it rises near and soon after the [[Pleiades]]. < ref name=Kaler > {{cite web | url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/aldebaran.html | title=Aldebaran | work=Stars | first1=James B. | last1=Kaler | date=May 22, 2009 | access-date=2009-12-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110013758/http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/aldebaran.html| archive-date= 10 January 2010}} < /ref >  The diameter of Aldebaran is 61,277,920 km which is 38,076,334 miles.
