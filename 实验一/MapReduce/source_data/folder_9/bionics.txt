 '''Bionics''' (also known as '''biomimetics''') is the [[science]] about studying nature to create modern [[technology]] with [[biology|biological]] method. 
 
 == History == 
 The name  " biomimetics "  was coined by [[:en:Otto_Schmitt|Otto Schmitt]] in the 1950s. The term  " bionics "  was coined by [[:en:Jack_E._Steele|Jack E. Steele]] in August 1958. He was then working at the ''Aeronautics Division'' ''House'' at [[:en:Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base|Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[:en:Dayton,_Ohio|Dayton, Ohio]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=R. R.|date=1983|title=The Foundation of Bionics|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/403622/summary|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=26|issue=2|pages=229â€“242|doi=10.1353/pbm.1983.0005|issn=1529-8795|pmid=6341959|s2cid=39473215}} < /ref >  However, terms like biomimicry or biomimetics are more preferred in the technology world in efforts to avoid confusion between the medical term  " bionics. "  Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel ''[[:en:Cyborg_(novel)|Cyborg]]'', which inspired the series ''[[:en:The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man|The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.              
 
 == Methods == 
 [[File:Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bur_Macro_BlackBg.jpg|right|thumb|[[:en:Velcro|Velcro]] was inspired by the tiny hooks found on the surface of [[:en:Bur|burs]].]] 
 The study of bionics often emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, [[:en:Cybernetics|cybernetics]] tries to model the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while [[:en:Artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] tries to model the intelligent function.
