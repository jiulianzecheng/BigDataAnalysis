 A '''commode''' is a special piece of [[furniture]]. The word comes form the French word and means ''convenient''. The commode developed from the [[chest]]. Commodes have [[drawer]]s, so handling them is more convenient than handling a chest. Commodes have been in common usage since the 18th century.
