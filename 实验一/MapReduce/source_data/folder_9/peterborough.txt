 '''Peterborough''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|ɚ|b|r|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Peterborough.ogg|ˈ|p|iː|t|ɚ|b|ə|r|ə}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]] in the [[East of England]]. The [[population]] is about 184,500 as of mid–2011. The city is well known for its [[cathedral]]. 
 
 Even though it is part of [[Northamptonshire]], for [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial purposes]] it is inside the [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Cambridgeshire]]. The city is {{convert|75|mi|km}} north of London. It is on the River Nene which flows into the [[North Sea]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the north-east.  
 
 The [[railway station]] is an important stop on the [[East Coast Main Line]] between London and [[Edinburgh]]. The local government area includes [[Northamptonshire]] and [[Rutland]] to the west, [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, and non-metropolitan Cambridgeshire to the south and east. 
 
 The [[topography]] of the land is flat. In some places it is below [[sea level]], for example in [[the Fens]] that are east of Peterborough.  
 
 [[Human settlement]] began before the [[Bronze Age]], as seen at the Flag Fen [[archaeological site]] to the east.  There is also [[evidence]] of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[occupied territory|occupation]]. In the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] period of time, a [[monastery]], Medeshamstede was built. This later became Peterborough Cathedral. 
 
 The population grew fast after [[rail transport]] began in the [[19th century]]. At that time, Peterborough became known for the [[manufacturing]] of [[brick]]s.

 == Population growth == 
 After [[World War II]], the city did not grow much, until the 1960s. Peterborough was named a  " New Town "  in 1967, by the government. This was part of the New Towns Act of 1946. It planned new towns to move people into better homes, who were still living in poor or bombed-out housing from the war. 
 
 Housing and population are still growing in the 21st century.  Peterborough's population growth was the fastest of any British city over the ten years from 2002. This was partly due to [[immigration]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/politics-news/population-growth-rate-is-fastest-in-uk-but-peterborough-people-are-not-that-happy-report-1-5842936|title=Population growth rate is fastest in UK but Peterborough people are not that happy - report|first=Paul|last=Grinnell|work=Peterborough Telegraph|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=14 June 2015|archive-date=21 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521042055/http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/politics/politics-news/population-growth-rate-is-fastest-in-uk-but-peterborough-people-are-not-that-happy-report-1-5842936|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Because the city is still getting larger,  the [[city council]] has passed a law for a new development plan. < ref > [http://consult.peterborough.gov.uk/file/1796848 Peterborough Local Plan (First Replacement)]{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Peterborough City Council, July 2005. retrieved 14 June 2015 < /ref >  This is to add an additional 22,000 homes, 18,000 jobs and over 40,000 people who will live in Peterborough by 2020. The newly developing Hampton [[township]] will be finished. There will also be a 1,500-homes built in Stanground, and a 1,200-homes built in Paston. 
 
 ==Suburbs== 
 ===Parnwell=== 
 Parnwell is a housing estate in the east of the city. Situated off Parnwell Way, it is easily accessible using the Frank Perkins Way (A1139). It is served by a convenience store at the Parnwell Centre and has a Sure Start Centre and a health centre. 
 
 The local primary school is Parnwell Primary School, which was opened in 1989 to serve children from 4 to 11 years. Children over this age may choose to attend the City of Peterborough Academy (COPA), Thomas Deacon Academy or the Stanground Academy.
