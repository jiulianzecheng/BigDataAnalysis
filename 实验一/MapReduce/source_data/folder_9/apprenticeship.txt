 '''Apprenticeship''' is a system of [[training]] people who are learning how to do a job which needs special [[skill]].  Someone who is learning in this way is called an  " apprentice " .  An apprentice will learn by working with someone who is already skilled at a job.  They are like a teacher and pupil. 
 
 == Development == 
 The system of apprenticeship has been used for many hundreds of years.  In the late [[Middle Ages]] the craft [[guild]]s and town governments used to watch and control the system.  A [[master craftsman]] had the [[rights|right]] to [[employ]] young people to work for them and pay them a small [[salary]].  In return the apprentice would be learning the trade.  Most apprentices were [[male]]s, but [[female]] apprentices are more common nowadays, especially in [[craft]]s such as [[embroidery]], [[silk]]-weaving etc..
