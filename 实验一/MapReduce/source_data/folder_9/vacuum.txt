 A '''vacuum''' is a place where there is no [[matter]], not even [[air]]. [[Sound]] cannot move in a vacuum. No place has a perfect vacuum, because a small number of [[particle]]s remain, even in [[outer space]].  
 
 A space where only some of the air is removed is also called a vacuum. The space then has lower [[pressure]], even though most of the air remains.  
 
 == Common uses == 
 *A [[vacuum cleaner]] works by pumping away some of the air. The air and dirt in a room rush into the vacuum left behind, where the dirt is caught by a filter. 
 *An [[internal combustion engine|automobile engine that burns fuel]] uses a vacuum to pull in air, which contains [[oxygen]] that allows the fuel to burn. 
 *An incandescent [[lightbulb]] has a vacuum inside so the hot filament doesn't burn up. 
 
 == Industrial uses == 
 {{Wiktionary}} 
 Vacuum is needed for some kinds of machines used for industrial production.  Vacuum pumps are used to pump air out of a vacuum chamber.  It is not possible to create 100% vacuum, but some vacuum pumps are able to create 99.9999% vacuum.  This is called  " hard vacuum " .  Most industrial purposes do not need hard vacuum.   
 
 Industrial vacuums are mainly used in: 
 * Food industry 
 * [[Electronics]] industry 
 * Packaging 
 * Manipulation 
 * Coating and degasing 
 
 == Scientific experiments == 
 Vacuum chambers are also used in many scientific experiments in laboratories. Some experiments in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] need hard vacuum to keep any air or other [[gas]]es from interfering with delicate surfaces or chemicals that can react.
