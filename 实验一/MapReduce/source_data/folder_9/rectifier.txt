 A '''rectifier''' is a device that can convert [[Alternating current]] (AC) to [[Direct current]] (DC). This is a process called rectification. Many rectifiers in the 20th century were made of metals like copper, iron, and silver. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.nd.edu/~lemmon/courses/ee224/web-manual/web-manual/lab8b/node6.html

 ''Half-wave rectifiers'' only have one side of a waveform, while the ''full-wave rectifiers'' use both sides of a waveform. The left-hand side of the full-wave rectifier circuit consists of four diodes: a diode bridge. Half-wave current is a current that can only flow  in alternate current, a full-wave current can flow both alternating current and direct current.  < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=SSE402 |title=Half-Wave Rectifier |author=Patrick Hoppe |accessdate=20 May 2012}} < /ref >

 '''Diode bridge''' is [[electrical circuit]] that consists of four [[diode]]s. It acts as a full wave rectifier to convert alternating current to direct current.
