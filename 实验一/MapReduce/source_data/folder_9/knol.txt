 '''Knol''' is a [[Google]] project which aims to include user-written articles on a range of topics. < ref name= " announce " > {{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html|title=Encouraging People to Contribute Knowledge|last=Manber|first=Udi|date=2007-12-13 |work=Official Google blog (06:01:00 PM)|publisher=Google|accessdate=2008-07-23}} < /ref >  The project was  announced on December 13, 2007 and opened in [[Beta version|beta]] to the public on July 23, 2008. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-9997426-93.html|title=Google's Wikipedia rival, Knol, goes public|last=Mills|first=Ellis|date=2008-07-23|work=CNET News|accessdate=2008-07-23|archive-date=2012-03-02|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65ro4s2gq?url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-9997426-93.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  When it was opened, there were a few hundred articles mostly about [[health]] and [[medicine]]. < ref name= " wired " > {{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2008/07/google_knol?currentPage=all|title=Google Throws Open Rival for Wikipedia — Anon Authors Discouraged|last=Levy|first=Steven|date=2008-07-23|work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}} < /ref > < ref name= " nyt-july " > {{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/wikipedia-meet-knol/index.html?partner=rssnyt|title=Wikipedia, Meet Knol|last=Helft|first=Miguel|date=2008-07-23|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-07-23|archive-date=2013-01-04|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130104043429/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/wikipedia-meet-knol/index.html?partner=rssnyt|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 == Content == 
 Anyone can create and own new knols. There can also be several articles on the same topic, each written by a different author. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/07/23/google_opens_up_knol_its_wikipediaforcash_project.html |title=Google opens up Knol, its Wikipedia-for-cash project |work=The Guardian |first=Jack |last=Schofield |date=2008-07-23 |accessdate=2008-07-26}} < /ref > < ref name=Blakely > {{cite web

 | quote=[K]nol looks set to foster rivalry. Contributors to Knol will not be able to contribute anonymously and will not be able to edit each other’s work, [...]. Whereas on Wikipedia, readers find only one entry on, say, the First World War, on Knol authors will submit separate pieces that will compete for advertising dollars.}} < /ref > 
 Because multiple articles can have the same title, readers find a topic by searching, rather than just by title. The authors can say who can edit their articles: the public, other authors, or only themselves. They may also choose to include ads from Google's [[AdSense]] to their knols. Knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project. Relevant nudity is allowed (in most countries), < ref > {{cite web |url=http://knol.google.com/k/mary-mcgrath/breast-augmentation/AkgpHkBF/eo9Q7w |title=Breast Augmentation |work=Knol |access-date=2008-11-22 |archive-date=2008-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903014325/http://knol.google.com/k/mary-mcgrath/breast-augmentation/AkgpHkBF/eo9Q7w |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  but [[pornography]], commercial or otherwise, is forbidden. < ref name= " policy " > {{cite web|url=http://knol.google.com/k/knol-help/-/si57lahl1w25/13#|title=Content Policy|work=knol.google.com|accessdate=2008-07-23|archive-date=2008-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819151817/http://knol.google.com/k/knol-help/-/si57lahl1w25/13|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Also forbidden is [[discriminatory]] or violent content. Content designed to promote businesses, products or services is allowed, but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not. < ref name= " policy " / > 
 
 In its early stages of development as a resource, Knol was criticised very much. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article4687582.ece|title=Google: In search of technology's new frontiers|last=Harvey|first=Mike|date=September 6, 2008|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}} < /ref >  Commentators have called it a  " wasteland "  of articles copied from other sources, entries that were outdated or abandoned, as well as spam or self-promotion. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2200401/|title=Chuck Knol|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=September 22, 2008|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-09-23}} < /ref >  Knol is frequently criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate articles. < ref name=techcrunch > {{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/30/google-knol-opens-up-to-other-languages/ |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=October 30, 2008 |title=Google Knol Opens In French, German and Italian}} < /ref >  Google has said that  " Since knol authors receive attribution, knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions.

    " knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions. " < /ref >  In October 2008, Google unveiled using Knols as a forum for debate, < ref > {{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/knol-debates-see-both-sides-get.html | title=Knol debates: See both sides, get involved }} < /ref >  and enabled French, Italian and German versions, in the face of stagnating traffic. < ref name=techcrunch/ > 
 
 == Process == 
 Anyone who wants to contribute to Knol must first sign in, with a Google account. The users should give their real names. < ref name=wired/ >  If permission is given, Google will check if the name is true. Google will do this by [[credit card]] or phone. Google  " [believes] that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content " . The company hopes that  " knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their [[reputation]] on the line " . < ref name= " announce "  / > 
 
 Readers who are logged in with a google account can comment on entries, rate them or suggest changes. This works much like a [[blog]]. When the project was announced, Manber said that  " Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content. All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors. " < ref name= " announce "  / >

 Knol has  " [[nofollow]] "  outgoing links, using an [[HTML]] directive. This prevents links in its articles from influencing [[search engine]] rankings. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-07-24-n22.html |title= Knol's Nofollowing Of Links |accessdate= 2008-07-30 |date= 2008-07-24 |first= Philipp |last= Lenssen |publisher= Google Blogoscoped}} < /ref >

 People have described Knol as a [[rival]] to other encyclopedia sites such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Scholarpedia]]. < ref > {{cite web |url = https://techcrunch.com/2007/12/14/google-knol-a-step-too-far/ |title = Google Knol: A Step Too Far? |date = 2007-12-14 |accessdate = 2007-12-14 |first = Duncan |last = Riley |authorlink = Duncan Riley |publisher = [[TechCrunch]]}} < /ref > < ref name=Death > {{cite news |url = http://www.newsfactor.com/news/Death-Knell-for-Wikipedia--About-com/story.xhtml?story_id=032002XVHH8G |title = Death Knell Sounds for Wikipedia, About.com |date = 2007-12-14 |accessdate = 2007-12-14 |first = Lane |last = Frederick |publisher = NewsFactor Network |archive-date = 2008-02-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224055504/http://www.newsfactor.com/news/Death-Knell-for-Wikipedia--About-com/story.xhtml?story_id=032002XVHH8G |url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Sometimes people pointed out that the format was very different, and therefore it might be an addition to these sites.
