 A '''boat''' is a [[vehicle]] used to travel on [[water]]. It is smaller than a [[ship]] and can be lifted out of the water and carried on a ship. Some boats have [[sail]]s, some are powered by rowing with [[oar]]s, and some use [[motor]]s. Those that use steam engines are [[steamboat]] < nowiki/ > s. There are some boats that can go underwater. They are called [[submarines]]. A narrowboat is a boat designed to be used on narrow [[canal]]s. It is sometimes called a [[barge]]. 
 
 Historically, most boats have been constructed from [[wood]]. However, more recently built boats are often made of metals like [[steel]] and [[aluminium]]. Expensive boats may have parts made from [[fiberglass]] or [[composite material]]s and some even have helicopter pads.
