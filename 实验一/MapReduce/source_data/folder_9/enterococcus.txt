 '''''Enterococcus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[lactic acid]] [[bacteria]] of the [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] [[Firmicutes]]. 
 
 Enterococci are [[Gram-positive]] [[cocci]] that often occur in pairs or short chains. They look like [[Streptococcus|streptococci]]. < ref name=Gilmore_2002 > {{cite book | title=The Enterococci: pathogenesis, molecular biology, and antibiotic resistance | url=https://archive.org/details/enterococcipatho0000unse | publisher = ASM Press | location=Washington, D.C. | year=2002 | editor=Gilmore M.S. |display-authors = etal | isbn=978-1-55581-234-8}} < /ref >  Two species are regular [[gut flora]] organisms in the intestines of humans: ''E. faecalis'' (90-95%) and ''E. faecium'' (5-10%). 
 
 == Physiology and classification == 
 Enterococci are  " facultative [[anaerobic]] organisms " . This means they can live in both [[oxygen]]-rich and oxygen-poor environments. < ref name=Fischetti_2000 > {{cite book | editor = Fischetti V.A. |display-authors = etal | title = Gram-positive pathogens | url = https://archive.org/details/grampositivepath0000unse | publisher = ASM Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-55581-166-3}} < /ref > 
 
 Members of the genus ''Enterococcus'' were classified as Group D ''[[Streptococcus]]'' until 1984. [[Genome|Genomic]] [[sequence analysis|DNA analysis]] showed they were a separate genus. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Schleifer KH; Kilpper-Balz R | title = Transfer of ''Streptococcus faecalis'' and ''Streptococcus faecium'' to the genus ''Enterococcus'' nom. rev. as ''Enterococcus faecalis'' comb. nov. and ''Enterococcus faecium'' comb. nov. | journal= Int.

 == Pathology == 
 Important [[infection]]s caused by ''Enterococcus'' include [[urinary tract infection]]s, bacterial [[endocarditis]], [[diverticulitis]], and [[meningitis]]. 
 
 Sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with [[ampicillin]], [[penicillin]] and [[vancomycin]]. < ref name=Baron > {{cite book | author = Pelletier LL Jr. | title = Microbiology of the circulatory system.
