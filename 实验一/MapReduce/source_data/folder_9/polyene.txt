 '''Polyenes''' are poly-[[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[organic compound]]s.  They contain one or more arrangements of alternating double and single [[carbon]]–carbon bonds. These double carbon–carbon bonds work in a process called [[Conjugated system|conjugation]].  This results in an overall lower energy state of the molecule.
