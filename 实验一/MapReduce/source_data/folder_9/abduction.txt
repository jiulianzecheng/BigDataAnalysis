 == International child abduction == 
 When a marriage breaks down, it is not uncommon for one parent to wish to return, with his or her children, to their [[state]] of origin. < ref name=Murphy208 > John Murphy, ''International Dimensions in Family Law'' (Manchester, UK: Manchester University Press, 2005), p. 208 < /ref >  This is usually without the permission of the other parent.
