 '''Walgreens''' is a [[pharmacy]] chain in the [[United States]]. It was founded in 1901 in [[Chicago]]. Its  [[headquarters]] are in [[Deerfield, Illinois]]. 
 
 In the 1980s, Walgreens owned and operated a chain of casual family restaurants/pancake houses called Wag's. It was very similar to [[Denny's]], [[IHOP]] and Golden Bear. In 1988, Walgreens sold most of Wag's to [[Marriott Corporation]] and by 1991 the chain was out of business. 
 
 On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire another pharmacy chain, [[Rite Aid]].
