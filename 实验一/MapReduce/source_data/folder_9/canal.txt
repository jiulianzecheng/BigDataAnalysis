 A '''canal''' is a [[waterway]] made by [[human]]s. For many centuries, canals have been built as a way of transporting heavy goods in barges or [[boat]]s. Canals often connect [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, or [[ocean]]s. The [[Panama Canal]] is a famous canal that connects the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Many canals are reinforced with [[clay]] or [[concrete]] on the sides and have [[Lock (water transport)|locks]]. 
 
 Other canals are used for [[irrigation]] or [[hydropower]].
