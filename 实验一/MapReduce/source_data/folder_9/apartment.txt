 An '''apartment''' ([[US English]]) or '''flat''' ([[British English]]) is a place to live that is only ''part'' of a larger building. Usually it is a group of rooms on one floor of a building in a city, where land is too expensive for people to have separate [[house]]s. An apartment that people own is called a [[condominium]] or  " condo " . A lesser known ownership structure for apartments is [[housing cooperative]]s. A rented has an owner called a [[landlord]] who charges money ( " rent money "  or  " [[rent]] " ) from the people who live there ( " tenants " ). 
 
 An '''apartment building''' or '''block of flats''' may have a few or many apartments. Each apartment is a separate room or set of rooms for people to live in. Sometimes an apartment will only be one small room, and tenants will have to share other rooms like the [[bathroom]] and [[kitchen]]. Other times, tenants will only share an entrance hallway with different doors leading to each apartment. This shared area is often cared for by a [[janitor]] or [[caretaker]]. 
 
 An '''apartment complex''' or '''housing estate''' is a group of apartment buildings. In an apartment complex, all of the apartment buildings are usually made in a similar way. 
 
 In many apartments, the tenants only pay the landlord for renting the apartment, and they have to pay other people to provide [[utility|utilities]] like [[electricity]] and [[heat]]. In some apartments, especially the ones in apartment complexes, the tenants will have to pay more to rent the apartment, but in return the landlord will give them things like utilities, laundry rooms (where people wash their [[clothing]]), [[exercise]] rooms, and parking spaces for [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, and [[car]]s. 
 
 An apartment complex may also provide recreational facilities such as a [[swimming pool]], [[mini golf course]], [[movie theater]], [[bowling alley]] and others 
 
 Apartment buildings are more common in [[city|cities]] than houses, because there is less room in a city to fit buildings. Building a house for one family in a [[Population density|dense city]] would cost an enormous amount of money compared to building a house outside of a city.
