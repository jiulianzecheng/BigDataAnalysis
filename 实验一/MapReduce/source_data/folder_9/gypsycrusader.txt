 Miller was convicted of making and selling drugs in 2007 and 2009.  In 2021, FBI agents and [[Fort Lauderdale]] police officers arrested Miller for having a gun.  In [[Florida]], where Miller was, people who have been convicted of [[felony|large crimes]] are not allowed to have guns.  Miller said he needed a gun because he was afraid of [[Antifa]] and [[Black Lives Matter]].  Miller said he did not know he was not allowed to have a gun. < ref name=FNT / > 
 
 The lawyer for the government, Kiran Bhat, said that Miller was dangerous because he was a white supremacist and asked the judge not to let him out on [[bail]] before his trial but instead make him stay in jail.  Miller's own lawyer said that Miller's videos were only entertainment and theater and that Miller was not dangerous.  The judge agreed with that. < ref name=MiH > {{cite news|publisher=Miami Herald|date=March 10, 2021|access-date=May 3, 2021|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article249845833.html|title='White supremacist' arrested by FBI must stay in jail until his trial, judge rules|author1=Carli Teproff|author2=Jay Weaver }} < /ref >
