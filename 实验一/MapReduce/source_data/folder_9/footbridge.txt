A '''footbridge''' is a [[bridge]] that was built to be mainly used by [[pedestrian]]s. Some footbridges are also built for [[bicycle]] riders, [[horse]]s or other animals. Footbridges are different from other bridges which are built to carry [[car]]s and other vehicles, or to allow a [[railway]] to pass.
