 '''''Notoceratops''''' (meaning  " southern horned face " ) was a [[ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]] known only from a [[Cretaceous|late Cretaceous]] jaw bone. ''Notoceratops'' walked on four sturdy legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a [[parrot]]-like beak, cheek teeth, and a small frill on its head. 
 
 == Discovery == 
 Notoceratops was named by Augusto Tapia in 1918 from a partial lower jaw found in [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], Argentina. This original ''Notoceratops bonarelli'' is missing and there is some doubt as to whether or not this fossil was actually a ceratopsian.
