'''ROYGBIV''' is an [[acronym]] for the sequence of [[Hue|hues]] commonly described as making up a [[rainbow]]. This acronym means [[Red|'''r'''ed]], [[Orange (color)|'''o'''range]], [[Yellow|'''y'''ellow]], [[Green|'''g'''reen]], [[Blue|'''b'''lue]], [[Indigo|'''i'''ndigo]], and [[Violet (color)|'''v'''iolet]]. 
 
 == History == 
 In the [[Renaissance]], several [[Artist|artists]] tried to establish a sequence of up to seven [[Primary color|primary colors]] from which all other [[Colour|colors]] could be mixed. In line with this [[Art|artistic]] tradition, [[Isaac Newton]] divided his [[Color wheel|color circle]], which he constructed to explain additive [[color mixing]], into [[Rainbow|seven colors]]. Originally he used only [[Five color theorem|five colors]], but later he added [[Orange (color)|orange]] and [[indigo]] to match the number of [[Musical note|musical notes]] in the [[major scale]]. This [[Colour|color sequence]] in reverse is called the [[mnemonic]] ''vibgyor''.
