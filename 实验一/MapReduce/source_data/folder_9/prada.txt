 '''Prada''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[fashion]] [[company]] (also known as a  " fashion label "  or  " fashion house " ). It has [[shop]]s and [[Product (consumer goods)|products]] around the [[world]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The company, originally named '''Prada Brothers''', was started in 1913 by [[Mario Prada]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. Mario Prada did not believe that women should have a role in business and prevented any female family members from joining his company. 
 
 However when he died in 1958, his son had no interest in running the company so his daughter, Luisa Prada, took over and ran the company until 1978.  
 
 Miuccia Prada, Luisa’s daughter, took over then and has been running the company since. Miuccia made the company bigger by giving it a more [[bohemian]] style. 
 
 [[Miu Miu]] is a second clothing, which is often simpler, and fits with the 'high' image of [[vintage]] items. Miu Miu is the nickname of Miuccia Prada when she was a child. After, Prada Sport 'Linea Rossa' was made. 
 
 Today, Prada is seen as one of the most important clothing designers in fashion. 
 
 == Buying and Joining with other companies == 
 After many other fashion companies started to buy or join with many other fashion companies, Prada tried to do the same thing. It went into debt so that it could buy [[Fendi]] in the early 1990s. Fendi was not making much money, and needed help. Prada could not help Fendi, so it sold it to [[LVMH]]. Prada is still in debt after buying Fendi. In 1999, the company bought  " [[Church's]] " , an English company that makes quality shoes. More recently 45% of  " Church's "  has been sold to [[Equinox]]. 
 
 Other big buys by Prada in the 1990s were [[Helmut Lang]] and [[Jil Sander]]. However, by 2006, Prada had sold both. Jil Sander was sold to 'Change Capital Partners', which is run by Luc Vandevelde (the chairman of [[Carrefour]]). Helmut Lang is now owned by [[Japan]]ese fashion company 'Link Theory'. 
 
 == Products made with other companies == 
 In May 2007, Prada and [[mobile phone]] maker [[LG Electronics]] worked together to make the [[LG Prada (KE850)]] phone. The phones were sold for $800 each. 
 
 ==Prada Foundation== 
 The Prada Foundation ({{lang-it|Fondazione Prada}}) is a [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]  dedicated to [[contemporary art]] and culture. It was founded in 1993. It is run by [[Miuccia Prada]] and Patrizio Bertelli. The foundation promotes [[art exhibition]]s and [[movie]] festivals. < ref name=about > {{cite web|title=Ca' Corner della Regina – Fondazione Prada – about|url=http://www.prada.com/en/fondazione/cacorner#about!|access-date=2017-12-05|archive-date=2014-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030073955/http://www.prada.com/en/fondazione/cacorner#about!|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name=about / > < ref name=giacometti > {{cite news|title=The Giacometti Variations: John Baldessari's site-specific show for the Fondazione Prada|url=http://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/december/09/the-giacometti-variations-john-baldessaris-site-specific-show-for-the-fondazione-prada/|newspaper=Phaidon News|access-date=2017-12-05|archive-date=2018-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106173224/https://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/december/09/the-giacometti-variations-john-baldessaris-site-specific-show-for-the-fondazione-prada/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 Prada has paid for several famous [[architecture|architects]], the most famous are [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Herzog  &  de Meuron]], to make their shops around the world. 
 	  
 === Prada Marfa === 
 In 2005, near the West [[Texas]] towns, [[Valentine, Texas|Valentine]] and [[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]], two [[Scandinavia]]n [[artist]]s, Emily Milne and Zoe Brown, opened 'Prada Marfa', a [[sculpture]] of a Prada mini-[[boutique]]. The sculpture is on [[U.S. Highway 90]] and is a long way from any other buildings. Prada helped pay for the building, which is 15 by 25-foot. The building does not actually sell clothes, but there are clothes in the window, as this is just for art.
