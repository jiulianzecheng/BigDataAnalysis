 A '''satyr''' is a creature from [[Greek mythology]]. They are usually depicted with the upper half of a [[human]] and the legs of a [[goat]], and [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] on their heads. Satyrs were usually companions of [[Dionysus]] and [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]. They are often shown in art chasing after [[nymph]]s and were associated with [[nature]] and [[fertility]]. Sometimes satyrs were figured as the leader of drunks and pageantry.
