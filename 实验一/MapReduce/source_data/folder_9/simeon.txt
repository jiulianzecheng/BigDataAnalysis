[[Simeon]] is a [[person]] in the [[Torah]] and [[Old Testament]]. Simeon was the second son of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]] and the [[ancestor]] of one of the Twelve [[Tribe]]s of the [[Israelites]]. 
 
 ==Birth== 
 After Leah gave birth to her second son she said that the Lord had heard her [[voice]] so she named her son [[Simeon]]. She then gave birth to another son and said “I have poured out my [[heart]] to the Lord” and named him [[Levi]]. 
 
 ==The story of Dinah== 
 When a [[prince]] named [[Shechem]] [[rape]]d [[Dinah]] after having [[kidnap]]ped her, he and his [[father]] [[Hamor]] wanted Shechem to marry her. So Jacob’s sons told him to tell Hamor to tell the [[men]] of [[Shechem]] to circumcise themselves. And then they did, so Shechem could marry Dinah. Then Simeon and his [[brother]] [[Levi]] [[kill]]ed every [[adult]] [[male]] in Shechem and rescued Dinah. But Jacob was [[angry]] with Simeon and Levi since he thought that the [[Canaan]]ites would [[kill]] them all for it. So they asked him “should our [[sister]] be treated as a [[whore]]”.   
 
 ==Story of Joseph== 
 Simeon was the one of Joseph’s [[brother]]s that he jailed to get the others to bring [[Benjamin]] to [[Egypt]].  
 
 ==Land Distribution== 
 When Jacob died, he told Simeon and [[Levi]] that because of the [[massacre]] of [[Shechem]] they wouldn’t have [[land]] of their own as part of their [[inheritance]] but would instead be contained by the lands of the other tribes. So the tribe of Simeon had its lands surrounded on all sides by [[land]] belonging to the tribe of [[Judah]].
