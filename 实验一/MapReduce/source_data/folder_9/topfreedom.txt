 '''Topfreedom''' is a movement in society. The people of the movement want to achieve that women can go [[Toplessness|topless]], without being punished in all the situations, where men do not need to cover their [[chest]]. The movement also wants to achieve that women are allowed to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] their children, in public, and that they are allowed to [[Sun bathing|sunbathe]] topless.  
 
 There are many organizations which advocate topfreedom.

[http://gotopless.org/gotopless-day Go Topless Day] is a special day in August. In this day, women are told to go topless in public. 
 
 In the [[United States]], each state has its own laws. The [[New York State]] Supreme Court said that women can go topless in public. < ref name=Santorelli > {{cite web|title=NY v Santorelli|url=http://naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/State_Supreme_Courts/NY_v_Santorelli/ny_v_santorelli.html|publisher=Naturist Education Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=July 7, 1992|archive-date=16 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316194512/http://www.naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/State_Supreme_Courts/NY_v_Santorelli/ny_v_santorelli.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name=cornell > {{cite web|title=The People  & C., Respondent, ''V''.

She sued (started a court case against) the city for violating the New York State Supreme Court rule that women can go topless in public. The city finally paid her $29,000 because she was right and the police were wrong. < ref > {{cite news|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|title=Yes, Ladies, You Can Walk Around the City Topless|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/06/topless_bowery.php|accessdate=8 February 2012|newspaper=Village Voice|date=June 9, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 In three provinces in [[Canada]] ([[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]] and [[British Columbia]]) women can be topless in public. However there are sometimes city laws saying women cannot be topless in city parks. Law professors say women probably can be topless in public in the other provinces, but nobody knows for sure. The question has not been decided by the Supreme (national) Court of Canada. < ref name= " Valverde-1 " > Valverde, Mariana (1999).
