 The '''Gahal''' Alignment was an [[Israel]]i [[political party]] from 1965 until the establishment of [[Likud]] in 1973. Gahal is an abbreviation for Gush Herut Liberalim, which is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for  " Freedom-Liberal Bloc " .  It was created by [[Menachem Begin]] who was at the time the [[leader]] of the [[Herut]] Party when Begin decided to form an [[alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party of Israel]].  Gahal was [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] because the Liberals were and strongly in favour of [[security]] because [[Herut]] was. In 1973, Gahal joined with a number of other [[political parties]] including  the [[Free Centre]], the [[National List]] and the [[Greater Israel]] movement to become [[Likud]] under the leadership of [[Menachem Begin]].
