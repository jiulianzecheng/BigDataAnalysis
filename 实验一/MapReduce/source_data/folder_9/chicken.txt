 '''Chicken''' (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') is a term which refers to a species of [[poultry]]. It is raised in many places for its [[meat]] and [[egg (food)|egg]]s. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110675/chicken |title=chicken (bird) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |accessdate=1 May 2010}} < /ref >  They are usually kept by humans as [[livestock]]. Some breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around). 
 
 A [[male]] chicken is called a rooster or a cock(erel). Roosters do not have [[Penis|penises]]. A [[female]] chicken is called a hen; a young chicken is called a chick. Like other female [[birds]], hens lay [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. The eggs hatch into chicks.  
 
 When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from [[Predation|predators]] such as [[Fox|foxes]]. Fences are often used for this.  < ref > [http://www.small-farm-permaculture-and-sustainable-living.com/how_to_raise_chickens.html How to Raise Chickens] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302233434/http://www.small-farm-permaculture-and-sustainable-living.com/how_to_raise_chickens.html |date=2015-03-02 }}, retrieved 15 March 2011. < /ref > 
 
 Chickens can also be [[Intensive farming|farmed intensively]]. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs.

 Because of their low cost, chicken [[meat]] (also called  " chicken " ) is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://shilala.homestead.com/chickenfacts.html |title=Chicken Facts by The Easy Chicken for beginners |work=shilala.homestead.com |accessdate=1 May 2010}} < /ref >  Some popular dishes with chicken are: Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, [[chicken soup]], [[fried chicken]] (see picture), [[roasting|roasted]] chicken and tandoori chicken.{{cn|date=February 2018}} 
 
 === Cuts === 
 There are different cuts of chicken. Chicken meat can also be bought whole. The leanest part is known as the breast. Sliced pieces of the breast are known as the tender(loin). There are also wings, thighs, and legs (also known as drumsticks). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Chicken Anatomy - Koch Foods|date=2 September 2020|url=https://kochfoods.com/about-chicken/chicken-anatomy/|access-date=2021-05-12|language=en-US}} < /ref > {{-}} 
 
 == Chicken and chickenpox == 
 [[Chickenpox]] has nothing to do with chickens. When chickenpox was first described, people thought that the pox spots looked like [[chickpea]]s placed upon the skin. The Latin word for chickpeas is ''grana''. That is the original word that chickenpox got its name from. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://parenting.ivillage.com/tp/tphealth/0,,3q8n,00.html |title=Why is it called chicken pox? |work=parenting.ivillage.com |accessdate=1 May 2010 |archive-date=14 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514144554/http://parenting.ivillage.com/tp/tphealth/0,,3q8n,00.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
