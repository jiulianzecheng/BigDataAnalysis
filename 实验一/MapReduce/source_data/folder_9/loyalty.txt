'''Loyalty''' is a [[devotion]] for someone or something. Someone who is '''loyal''' can be [[:wikt:trust|trusted]], because they never [[betrayal|betray]] the people they are loyal to.  
 
 == Loyalty in business == 
 Being loyal can also bring good to [[business]] because the [[boss]], or person in control, may let the person do something difficult but [[great]]ly [[payment|paid]]. This is because loyal people are [[expectation|expected]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trusted]] to [[behaviour|behave]] [[responsibility|responsibly]]. 
 
 Some firms (e.g. [[insurance]] [[broker]]s) may give  " loyalty discounts "  to [[customer]]s who stay with them for a long time (who are loyal to the firm).  Some [[Shop|stores]] may offer their customers  " loyalty cards "  to get some money off their purchases.
