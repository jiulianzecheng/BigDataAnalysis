 '''Cyanides''' are [[chemical]]s that contain the ''cyano-group'' Câ‰¡N. Organic compounds that contain the CN group are called [[nitrile]]s. In that group a [[carbon]] [[atom]] has three [[chemical bond]]s to a [[nitrogen]] atom. The group is present in many substances. Those substances that can release the compound CN are very [[poison]]ous. 
 
 Certain [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]] are able to produce cyanides. Cyanides are also found in certain foods or plants, such as [[cassava]]. The cyanides serve as a [[Defense against herbivory|defense]] against being eaten by [[herbivore]]s.  
 
 In popular culture, cyanides are said to be very [[toxic]]. There are some cyanides that  are, but others that are not. [[Prussian blue]], a cyanide compound, is given as a treatment to poisoning with [[thallium]] and [[caesium]], for example. 
 
 The poisons referred to are usually [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN), and the chemicals which are similar to it, like [[potassium cyanide]] (KCN), and [[sodium cyanide]] (NaCN). They are [[derivative]]s of hydrogen cyanide. The single most hazardous compound is hydrogen cyanide, which is a gas and kills by inhalation. cyanide smells like bitter almonds when near. 
 
 == Antidote == 
 [[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the [[kidneys]]. This [[antidote]] kit is sold under the brand name ''Cyanokit'' and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006. < ref > EMedicine article: Cyanide toxicity treatment.
