[[File:Cleats.jpg|thumb|Football boots have studs on their soles]] 
 '''Cleats''' or '''studs''' are [[wikt:spike|spikes]] or [[wikt:stud|studs]] that are attached to the [[wikt:sole|bottom]] of a [[shoe]] to provide more [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] ([[wikt:grip|grip]]) on a soft or slippery [[surface]]. Shoes specially designed for several kinds of [[sports]], such as [[baseball]] and all the different kinds of [[football]], have cleats, so that the [[wikt:player|players]] do not slip on the ground so easily. Ice cleats (or [[crampon]]s) are a type of spikes that usually are attachable to the soles of shoes to prevent slipping on ice.
