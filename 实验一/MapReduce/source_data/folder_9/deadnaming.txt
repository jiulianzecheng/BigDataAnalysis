'''Deadnaming''' is using a name (called a  " deadname " ) that a [[transgender]] person used before transitioning without their permission. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Sinclair-Palm|first=Julia|date=2017-05-01|title= " It's Non-Existent " : Haunting in Trans Youth Narratives about Naming|url=https://educate.bankstreet.edu/occasional-paper-series/vol2017/iss37/7|journal=Occasional Paper Series|volume=2017|issue=37|issn=2375-3668}} < /ref >  It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered  " [[death|dead]] "  and is now a brand-new person.  
 
 Sometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very [[disrespectful]] because it ignores a person's [[gender identity]] and is a type of [[transphobia]] if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of [[violence]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=women.|date=2017-03-17|title=Deadnaming A Trans Person Is Violence â€” So Why Does The Media Do It Anyway?|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deadnaming-a-trans-person-is-violenceso-why-does_b_58cc58cce4b0e0d348b3434b|access-date=2020-01-02|website=HuffPost|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Obstacles ==
