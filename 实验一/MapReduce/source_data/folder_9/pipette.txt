 A smaller, less accurate version, known as a '''teat pipette''' is made of plastic and is filled by squeezing a plastic bubble at the top. 
 
 A pipette used for the delivery of small fractions of a [[milliliter]] of a [[liquid]] is called a '''micropipette'''.  
 
 == Accurate pipettes == 
 Piston-driven air displacement pipettes, or 'micropipettes', are the most accurate and precise pipettes. They handle liquid in the microliter scale, and are used in biology and biochemistry,
