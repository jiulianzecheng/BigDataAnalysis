 '''Bats''' are [[mammals]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Chiroptera'''. < ref > Hill J.E.  &  Smith J.D. 1984. British Museum (Natural History), London < /ref >  Bats are [[nocturnal]] – they are active during the night, [[dusk]], or [[dawn]] and they sleep during the day. 
 
 Most use [[echolocation]] to catch [[prey]] and to find their way about. As nighttime animals, bats avoid direct competition with [[birds]], few of which are nocturnal. 
 
 Bats usually live in [[cave]]s or [[tree]]s. In [[North America]] and in [[Europe]] they sometimes live in people's houses or barns. They are protected animals in the [[UK]]. < ref > Altingham J.D. 2003. ''British bats''. HarperCollins, London. < /ref > 
 
 Bats are a successful group. They are the second largest order of mammals: there are more than 1,400 species of bats. This means that 20% of all living mammal species – one in five – are bats. < ref name= " tudge " > {{cite book | last = Tudge | first = Colin | title = The variety of life | url = https://archive.org/details/varietyoflifesur0000tudg | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2000 | isbn=0-19-860426-2}} < /ref > < ref name=Simmons/ > 
 
 About 70% of bats are [[insectivore]]s, which is the [[basal]] form of life for this group. The [[common pipistrelle]] is a successful example. Most of the rest are [[frugivore|fruit-eaters]] (fruit bats). A few [[species]] suck [[blood]], and a few large ones are [[carnivorous]]. 
 
 Bats live everywhere except the [[Arctic]], [[Antarctic]] and a few [[ocean]]ic islands. They usually [[wikt:roost|roost]] in caves, old buildings, or trees. 
 
 Traditionally, bats are divided into two groups. '''Microbats''' mostly use echo-location and catch [[insects]], but just a few eat fish or drink blood. '''Megabats''' do not echolocate, but instead eat fruit or nectar. 
 
 Most of the bats are well known for their uncanny capability to fly in dark places. Most bats use sound to navigate during the night by [[echolocation]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781351074919-1|title=Natural History of Vampire Bats|last=Tuttle|first=Merlin D.|date=2018 |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-351-07491-9|pages=1–5|doi=10.1201/9781351074919-1}} < /ref >  Bats can fly and find their food by listening to the outcoming echoes and sending out high-frequency squeaks even in total darkness. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.118573|title=Coefficient of conservatism rankings for the flora of Montana. report to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Helena, Montana|last=Pipp|first=Andrea|date=2015|publisher=Montana Natural Heritage Program|location=Helena, MT|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.118573}} < /ref >

 * Order '''Chiroptera''' 
 ** Megabats (Megachiroptera) 
 ** Microbats (Microchiroptera) 
 
 The [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate. The traditional subdivision between Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflects the view that these groups of bats have evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor which was already capable of flight. 
 
 The hypothesis was that flight only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a single or [[monophyletic]] group. < ref name=Simmons/ >

 ===Fossil bats=== 
 There are few fossilized remains of bats, as bats are terrestrial and light-boned. < ref > Eiting T.P. and G.F. Gunnell. 2009. Global completeness of the bat fossil record. ''Journal of Mammalian Evolution'' '''16''':151-173. < /ref >  An [[Eocene]] bat, ''[[Onychonycteris]]'', was found in the 52-million-year-old [[Green River Formation]] in Wyoming, United States, in 2003. < ref name=Simmons > Simmons N.B.''et al.'' 2008. Primitive early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation. ''Nature'' '''451''':818-821. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html] < /ref > < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7243502.stm (''BBC News'')  " Bat fossil solves evolution poser " ] 13 February 2008. < /ref >  It could fly, but the well-preserved skeleton showed the [[cochlea]] of the inner ear could not achieve the great hearing ability of modern bats. This was evidence that flight in bats developed before echolocation. The team said it lacked ear and throat features not only of echolocating bats today, but also in other known [[fossil]] species. Fossil remains of other Eocene bats, ''[[Icaronycteris]]'', ''Archaeonycteris'', ''Palaeochiropteryx'', ''Hassianycteris'' and ''Australonycteris'' all show a similar mixture of [[basal]] and [[derived]] [[Trait (biology)|traits]], < ref > In old-fashioned terms, a mixture of primitive and advanced features. < /ref >  as expected by [[mosaic evolution]]. 
 
 All Eocene bats had long tails. This feature is also found in early flying insects in the [[Carboniferous]], in early [[pterosaur]]s and in ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and other [[dinobird]]s. The tail helped to keep their flight [[stability|stable]], which means it kept on course, and did not dart about much. To dart about quickly requires special advanced brains and reflexes, which later bats, birds and pterosaurs had, but early ones did not. It requires more brains to control unstable flight than it does for stable flight. That early bats had long tails was predicted by [[John Maynard Smith]] before any fossil early bats were found. < ref > Maynard Smith, John 1952. The importance of the nervous system in the evolution of animal flight. ''Evolution'' '''6''', 127. < /ref > < ref > Maynard Smith, John 1953. Birds as aeroplanes. ''New Biology'' '''14''', 64. < /ref > 
 
 ''Onychonycteris'' had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches such as [[sloth]]s and [[gibbon]]s. This palm-sized bat had broad, short wings, suggesting it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, ''Onychonycteris'' likely alternated between flaps and glides while in the air. Such physical characteristics suggest this bat did not fly as much as modern bats do, rather flying from tree to tree and spending most of its waking day climbing or hanging on the branches of trees. < ref name=Simmons/ > 
 
 == Adaptations == 
 === Echolocation === 
 An interesting thing about bats is that even though they can see with their eyes, they also use their ears to help them 'see' in the dark. Because of this, they can fly into very dark places where no eye could see. This way of sensing is called '''echolocation'''. Echolocation means they use [[echo]]es to [[wikt:locate|find]] where things are. 
 
 Echolocation is like [[sonar]], which [[submarine]]s and [[ship]]s use to find things underwater. This is how it works: when a bat flies, it makes lots of sounds. ''We'' cannot hear these sounds (they are too high-[[wikt:pitch|pitched]]), but bats can hear them. [[Biologist]]s have [[wikt:instrument|instruments]] to record them, and then play them back at a lower frequency so humans can hear them. 
 
 When a bat makes its noises, the sound waves move away from the bat. If they hit something, they bounce back to the bat (this bounce is called an ''echo''.) If nothing bounces back, the bat knows there is nothing in front. They use this echolocation to catch their food, like [[butterfly|butterflies]] or [[dragonfly|dragonflies]]. When a bat begins its [[night]]ly exploration, it usually sends out about 10 calls per second. From the echo they know what is in front. When they get an echo from something good to eat, the calls [[wikt:increase|increase]] up to 200 calls per second. This increase of sounds is called a ''feeding buzz''. The bat makes a feeding buzz to sense all the [[wikt:quick|quick]] moves of the [[insect]] it is trying to catch. 
 
 Hearing and understanding the echoes that go back to the bat takes special [[wikt:structure|structures]] in the bat's brain. Because of this, many scientists, doctors, and even the U.S. army study bats carefully. The U.S. army spends [[hundred]]s of [[thousand]]s of [[dollar]]s every year to study echolocation in bats. 
 
 Bats also have reasonably good eyesight, and can see their prey and where they are flying if it's not too dark. There are lots of stories about bats flying right into people, but this is not true. They can see in the light very well, and in the dark, they can see much better than us. So the expression  " blind as a bat "  is not very [[science|scientific]]. < ref name=Alt > Altringham J.D. 1998. ''Bats: biology and behaviour''. Oxford: Oxford University Press < /ref > 
 
 === Communication === 
 Some bats use echolocation to communicate with each other to find food in groups. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior studied the bat ''Molossus molossus'', which hunts insects in groups. They found the bats could understand echolocation noises made by other bats and even tell which other bat in their group had made the sound, like people recognizing each other's voices. < ref name= " BehavioralEcology " > {{cite journal|title=Socially foraging bats discriminate between group members based on search-phase echolocation calls |accessdate=June 19, 2020|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/advance-article/doi/10.1093/beheco/araa056/5857067|date=June 13, 2020|journal=Behavioral Ecology|author1= Jenna E Kohles|author2=Gerald G Carter|author3=Rachel A Page|author4=Dina K N Dechmann|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1103–1112|doi=10.1093/beheco/araa056}} < /ref > 
 
 === Bat wings === 
 Bats fly with their [[hand]]s. In fact, the name of the order of bats, ''Chiropetera'', means 'hand-wings' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. < ref > {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɒ|p|t|ər|ə}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] χείρ - ''cheir'',  " hand " < /ref > 
 
 Bat and bird wings are different. [[Bird]]s do not have long finger-like [[bone]]s in their [[wing]]s like bats. Birds can not move each of their [[finger]]s, but bats can. Because of this, bats can change their direction while flying or fly in any pattern they want: this makes it easier to catch their food. A bat flies as if they are  " swimming "  through the air – pushing both wings down and backward. 
 
 A bird's wing has lots of feathers, while a bat's wing is mostly a stretchy, thin [[skin]] called a patagium. This thin [[membrane]] of skin stretches between each finger bone, connects to the bat's ankle, and connects to the bat's tail (if it has one). A bat folds its wings next to its body when not flying. 
 
 Bats have one claw (sometimes called a ''bat thumb'') that sticks out of the top of the wing. They use their  " thumb "  to climb and crawl. Interestingly, bats also use their thumbs to clean their ears. 
 
 Bats' wings have a lot of maneuverability (they can change direction quickly) – more so than a bird, in fact – but they do not have a lot of lift. Because of this, bats usually have to climb up onto a tree or jump up into the air for the [[wikt:boost|boost]] before they start flapping their wings. 
 
 ===Immune system=== 
 Even though bats are very small, they live a long time.  Some bats can live forty years.  Scientists think this is because their [[immune system]]s are very good at fighting viruses.  Bats fight viruses without having [[inflammation]] in their bodies. Doctors think inflammation causes harm to the body, so they think this could be why bats live a long time. < ref name= " Rochester "  / > 
 
 Because bats rest in large groups with many other bats, they can pass diseases to each other easily.  This means that over thousands of generations, viruses and other germs have placed [[Evolutionary arms race|selective pressure]] on bats, killing bats with weak immune systems and leaving bats with good immune systems to survive and have young. < ref name= " Rochester "  / > 
 
 Many viruses that start in bats later change and become dangerous diseases in humans, for example [[Ebola]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]]. < ref name= " Rochester " > {{cite press release|accessdate=July 11, 2020|date=July 8, 2020|title=Bats offer clues to treating COVID-19|publisher=University of Rochester|url=https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/bats-offer-clues-to-treating-covid-19-443332/}} < /ref > < ref name= " CellMeta " > {{cite journal|journal=Cell Metabolism|title=The World Goes Bats:Living Longer and Tolerating Viruses|accessdate=July 11, 2020|publisher=Cell Press|author1=Vera Gorbunova|author2=Andrei Seluanov|author3=Brian K.

 === Food === 
 Megabats eat [[fruit]], [[nectar]] or [[pollen]]. They [[pollinate]] [[flower]]s and sometimes spread their seeds. Many tropical plants completely depend on bats. 
 
 Most microbats (7 out of 10 bat species) are [[insectivorous]], that is, they eat [[insect]]s. Some microbats eat small [[vertebrate]] animals (small mammals or [[fish]]), [[blood]], or even other bats. There are only a few species of [[vampire bat]]s, which eat blood from cattle. 
 
 === Resting position === 
 Most bats rest, sleep and [[Hibernation|hibernate]] in an upside-down position. They hang on to branches or rocks with their feet. To do this they have a locking mechanism on the [[tendon]]s in their feet which stops them from slipping. < ref > Simmons N.B. and Quinn T.H. 1994. Evolution of the digital tendon locking mechanism in bats and dermaptorans: a phylogenetic perspective. ''Journal of Mammalian Evolution''. POI: 10.1007/BF 01464276 [http://www.mendeley.com/research/evolution-digital-tendon-locking-mechanism-bats-dermopterans-phylogenetic-perspective/] < /ref >  The energy they spend hanging on is greatly reduced. The most obvious gain is that they can sleep without falling off. Once the tendons are locked, the muscles in their legs and feet can relax. Even dead bats stay hanging. < ref > Where do bats live? University of Edinburgh Natural History Collection [http://www.nhc.ed.ac.uk/index.php?page=493.169.179] Includes useful diagram < /ref > 
 
 == Unusual bats == 
 *[[Fruit bat]]s (''Pteropodidae'') are the largest of the bats. They eat fruit and can see well. There are 166 species, all found in the [[Old World]]. 
 *[[Vampire bat]]s live in [[Latin America]]. They are famous for only drinking [[blood]]. 
 *The [[greater noctule]] bat lives in Europe, West Asia and North Africa and it hunts birds. 
 *The [[greater bulldog bat]] of [[South America]] swoops low over water and grabs small fish with its claws. 
 *The [[bumblebee bat]], from [[Thailand]], is the world's smallest bat, and is also one of the world's smallest [[mammal]]s. Adults grow to a length of 29-33mm, and weigh 2 [[gram]]s. < ref name= " Edge " > {{Cite web | url = http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=49 | title = Bumblebee bat (''Craseonycteris thonglongyai'') | work = EDGE Species | accessdate = 2008-04-10 | archive-date = 2016-08-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819233333/http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=49 | url-status = dead }} < /ref > 
 *The biggest known bat is the [[giant golden-crowned flying fox]]. It has a wing span of 1.5m and weighs approximately 1.2 & nbsp;kg. 
 *The [[Christmas Island pipistrelle]] is a bat whose [[extinct]]ion date is not known. 
 
 == Bats and people == 
 In the [[United Kingdom]] all bats are protected by law, and even disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine. 
 
 [[Austin]], [[Texas]] is the summer home to North America's largest urban bat coven (under the Congress Avenue bridge), an estimated 1,500,000 [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s, who eat an estimated 10 to 30 tons of insects each night, and attract 100,000 tourists each year. 
 
 In [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] bats are protected species, but the large naked bat and greater nectar bat are eaten by the local communities. 
 
 === Bats in folklore and fiction === 
 In the [[Western culture|West]], bats are associated with [[vampire]]s, who are said to be able to change into bats. Bats are also a symbol of ghosts, death and disease. However bats are said to be lucky in some [[Europe]]an countries, such as [[Poland]]. 
 
 The bat is used in [[fiction]] by both villains like [[Dracula]] and heroes like [[Batman]]. Kenneth Oppel wrote a series of [[novel]]s, beginning with ''Silverwing'', which feature bats as good characters.
