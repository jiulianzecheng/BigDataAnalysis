 '''Hyperthermophiles''' are [[extremophile]] < ref > organisms that live in an [[wikt:extreme|extreme]] [[environment]] < /ref >  organisms that live best in very hot environments– from 60°[[Centigrade|C]] (140°[[Fahrenheit|F]]) up to 100°C (212°F). The best temperature for hyperthermophiles to grow at is around 80°C (176°F). Hyperthermophiles are mostly in the [[Archaea]] [[domain (biology)|domain]], but some [[bacteria]] are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100°C (212°F) as well. Many hyperthermophiles are also able to tolerate other environmental extremes, like high [[acid]]ity or radiation levels.
