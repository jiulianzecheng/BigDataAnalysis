 '''Initiation''' is a [[ceremony]] at the entrance or acceptance into a [[group]] or [[society]]. It can also be a formal admission to [[adult]]hood in a community. < ref > In an extended sense it can also mean a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role. < /ref >  [[Rites of passage]] such as Christian [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (christianity)|confirmation]], or Jewish [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar or bat mitzvah]], or [[graduation]] from school, are initiations. Acceptance into a fraternal organization like the [[Freemasonry|freemasons]] or religious order like the [[Benedictine]]s is also an initiation. A person taking the initiation ceremony is called an ''initiate''. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The English word comes from the [[Latin]], ''initium'':  " entrance "  or  " beginning. The related English verb, '''initiate''', means to begin or start a particular [[action]]. 
 
 ==Tribal initiations== 
 [[Tribe]] < nowiki/ > s often have initiations. In many African tribes, initiation means [[circumcision]] of males and sometimes [[circumcision]]/[[genital mutilation]] of females.  Initiation is thought to be necessary for the individual to be regarded as a full member of the tribe. Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to take part in ceremonies or even in social [[ritual]] such as [[marriage]]. A man will not be allowed to marry or have any special relationship with a woman who didn't go to an initiation, because she is not considered as a woman. 
 
 Initiation may be thought of as an event which may help teens prepare themselves to be good husbands and wives. Because of modernization initiation is not taken so seriously as before, but there are still certain areas which still perform initiations. 
 
 In some African tribes, boys have initiation rites for 3–4 months and girls for 1–2 months. 
 
 [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] tribes usually had long periods of time to help prepare [[Adolescence|adolescent]] boys, teaching them the Law before they were ready to attend large elaborate ceremonies at the time of initiation when they were finally recognized as men in their society. Most tribes had circumcision and [[scar]]ification as part of the male initiation rituals, while many Central [[Australia]]n tribes also practiced [[subincision]].
