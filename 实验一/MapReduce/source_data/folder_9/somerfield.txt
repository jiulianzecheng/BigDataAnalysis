 '''Somerfield''' was a small [[UK]] supermarket chain. It was founded in 1875 with a [[Bristol]]-based grocer known as J.H. Mills. It developed a self-service [[Supermarkets in the United Kingdom|supermarket]] chain named Gateway Foodmarkets in 1960.  Gateway Foodmarkets was taken over by [[Linfood Holdings]],  which already owned the Frank Dee Supermarkets in the north and east of England. They bought a lot of different retail stores. In 1990 they started using the name Somerfield. 
 
 The company bought the [[Kwik Save]] chain of discount food stores in 1998. < ref name= " hist " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.somerfieldgroup.co.uk/index.asp?sid=17
