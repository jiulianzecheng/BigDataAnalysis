 The '''dodo''' ''(Raphus cucullatus)'' is an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[flightless bird]] from [[Mauritius]].  
 
 Like many other island birds, they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived. Dodos were in the same family as the [[pigeon]]. They were [[endemism|endemic]] to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became [[extinct]] in the late 17th century.   
 
 The Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.  
 
 == The name 'Dodo' == 
 The history of the word 'Dodo' is not clear. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] admiral Wybrand van Warwijck discovered the island and the bird in 1598 during an expedition to [[Indonesia]]. He called the bird 'walgvogel', meaning  " disgusting bird "  because he disliked the taste of the meat. Four years later, the Dutch captain, Willem van Westsanen, used the word 'Dodo' for the first time. < ref name= " Staub1996 " > Staub, France 1996. Dodo and solitaires, myths and reality. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Arts  &  Sciences of Mauritius'' '''6''': 89-122 [http://www.potomitan.info/dodo/c32.php HTML fulltext] < /ref > 
 
 The ''[[Encarta|Encarta Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Chambers Dictionary|Chambers Dictionary of Etymology]]'' say  " dodo "  is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word, coming from ''doido''. It means  " fool "  or  " crazy " . Another idea is that 'dodo' was a [[wikt:onomatopoeia|copy]] of the bird's own call, a two-note pigeon like sound,  " doo-doo " . < ref name= " Quammen1996 " > '''Quammen''', David 1996.

 In 1606 Cornelis de Jonge wrote a description of the Dodo, and of other animal and plants on the island . < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.potomitan.info/dodo/c32.php|title=Le musée du Dodo|publisher=Potomitan|first=France|last=Staub|accessdate=2009-01-18}} < /ref > 
 
 == Description == 
 The dodo was the largest bird of the [[Columbiformes]], and weighs about {{convert|50|lb|kg|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. They had grey feathers and yellow feet. < ref name=bbc/ >  Their big hooked bill was a green/yellow color. < ref name= " amh " / >  It had short wings that were only stubs. < ref name=amh/ >  They ate fruit, seeds and nuts. < ref name=bbc > {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A138269|title=BBC - h2g2 - The Dodo - an extinct bird|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2009-03-09}} 
 < /ref >  [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors said that they saw the Dodos eating fish. They also ate rocks and stones which might have helped them digest food. < ref name= " www.petermaas.nl " > {{cite web|url=http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/dodobird.htm|title=Recently Extinct Animals - Species Info - Dodo|publisher=www.petermaas.nl|accessdate=2009-03-09|archive-date=2007-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514014631/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/dodobird.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They are eaten by humans who come in the search of treasure or spouting. 
 
 == Extinction == 
 The dodo was not scared of people which made it easy to hunt and kill. Dogs, cats, rats and pigs were left on the island and also killed the dodos. Because dodos built their nests on the ground, the new animals ate their eggs. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.davidreilly.com/dodo/background.html|title=Background: the tragedy of the Dodo (1598-1681)|publisher=www.davidreilly.com|accessdate=2009-03-09|last=Reilly|first=David|archive-date=2009-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302005505/http://davidreilly.com/dodo/background.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The forests were chopped down and the dodo lost its [[habitat]].

 The last known stuffed bird was at Oxford University and was thrown out as rubbish. Only a foot and a head are left. < ref name=bbc/ >  The [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City|New York]] has a skeleton showing. < ref name=bbc/ > < ref name=amh/ >  It was put together out of bones from several different Dodos. The Natural History Museum of Mauritius has the only complete skeleton of a dodo, found in a swamp. < ref name= " www.petermaas.nl " / >
