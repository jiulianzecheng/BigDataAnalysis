 '''Haloarchaea''' are [[halophile]]s. They need a high [[salt]] concentrations to grow. They are a distinct [[evolution]]ary branch of the [[Archaea]], and are [[extremophile]]s. 
 
 The term ''halobacteria'' is a misnomer (mistaken name), because we now know the archaea are a different group from bacteria.

 In [[taxonomy]], the Haloarchaea are a [[class (biology)|class]] of the [[Euryarchaeota]], < ref > See the National Center for Biotechnology Information  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info & id=183963 webpage on Halobacteria].  Data extracted from the {{cite web | url=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/ | title=NCBI taxonomy resources | publisher=NCBI | accessdate=2007-03-19}} < /ref >  found in [[water]] with [[salt]]. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available.
