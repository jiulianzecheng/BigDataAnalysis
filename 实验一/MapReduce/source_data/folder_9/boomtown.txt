 A '''boom town''' is a place that has very quick [[population]] and [[economic]] growth. Boomtowns are usually [[mining]] towns where an important [[mineral]] resource such as gold, silver, or [[petroleum]] has been found. It can happen, for example in a [[gold rush]]. Gold rush towns usually shrink and disappear after the gold is dug up. They become [[ghost town]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 The word can also be used for places that grow for other reasons.  This can be the town being near a major city, in a nice [[climate]] or near a [[wikt:popular|popular]] [[wikt:attraction|attraction]].  
 
 Some examples of California boom towns are Columbia (not the country) and San Francisco.
