In [[cricket]], a batter can be [[Out (cricket)|out]] '''bowled''' if the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]] delivers the ball to the batter and it hits the [[wicket]] behind the batter before touching anyone other than the batter. When the wicket is hit, one of its 5 sticks must fall to the ground for the batter to be out. A batter can't be bowled if the ball was not delivered legally. < ref > {{Cite web|title={% DocumentName %} Law {{!}} MCC|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket/bowled|access-date=2020-12-30|website=www.lords.org}} < /ref > 
 
 A batter can also be out [[leg before wicket]] (LBW) if they use their body to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.
