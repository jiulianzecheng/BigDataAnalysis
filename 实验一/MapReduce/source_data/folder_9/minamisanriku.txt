 {{nihongo|'''Minamisanriku'''|南三陸町|Minamisanriku-chō| " South three land " }}, also spelled '''Minami Sanriku''', is a resort town on the Pacific Coast of [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. < ref > [http://www.channel4.com/news/inside-minamisanriku-some-kind-of-armageddon Inside Minamisanriku] ''Channel 4 News'', 13 March 20011 < /ref >  The town has an area of {{convert|163.74|km2}}, and as of October 1, 2004 the population of the area was 19,170.  The town was created on October 1, 2005, when the towns of [[Shizugawa, Miyagi|Shizugawa]] and [[Utatsu, Miyagi|Utatsu]] merged to form the new town of Minamisanriku. 
 
 Minamisanriku was largely destroyed by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese 2011 tsunami]], with most buildings swept away by waves of {{convert|16|m|ft}} or more. Over half the town's population is missing and almost certainly dead.

 95 percent of the town was destroyed by the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami#Tsunami|2011 Japanese tsunami]] that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Only the tallest buildings remain and an estimated 9,500 people are missing, roughly half the population. < ref > {{cite web| title=9,500 still unaccounted in Minamisanriku of Japan's Miyagi Prefecture: Kyodo |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-03/12/c_13775336.htm| publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|accessdate=2011-03-12}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|author=Kyung Lah, CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/japan.quake/ |title=Rescuers scramble to save lives as aftershocks jolt Japan |publisher=[[CNN.com]] |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-12}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=389391 & CategoryId=12395 |title=9,500 People Reported Missing in Small Town Following Japan Quake |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-date=2011-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713182411/http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=389391 & CategoryId=12395 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > Horiuchi, Junko, ([[Kyodo News]])  " [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110329b1.html Evacuees persevere, eye future] " , ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 March 2011, p. 3. < /ref >  9,700 people are confirmed alive and evacuated. < ref > [http://www.nikkei.com/news/headline/article/g=96958A9C93819490E3E7E2E3E28DE3E7E2E1E0E2E3E3E2E2E2E2E2E2?n_cid=TW001](Japanese) < /ref > 
 
 The town had two evacuation centres where residents could go to escape from a tsunami. One was on the southern headland overlooking the town. The other was inland away from the center of the town. Although both were 20 meters above sea level, the tsunami covered them and washed people away. < ref > [http://www.theage.com.au/world/natures-fury-leaves-a-siltcovered-graveyard-20110315-1bvzp.html Natures fury leaves a silt-covered graveyard] ''The Age'', 16 March 2011 < /ref >  At least 31 of the town's 80 designated evacuation sites were inundated by the tsunami. < ref > [[Kyodo News]],  " [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110414a4.html Tsunami hit more than 100 designated evacuation sites] " , ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 April 2011, p. 1. < /ref >

 ==1960 tsunami== 
 The [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|Great Chilean Earthquake]] of 1960 caused a tsunami that crossed the Pacific Ocean and struck the then town of Shizugawa. That tsunami was as high as {{convert|2.8|m|ft}}, < ref name= " flickr " / >  At that time, the damage was considered extensive. < ref name= " 1960damage " / >   As a result, two-storey-high harbor walls were built by 1963, and residents held tsunami drills each year on the anniversary.  The harbor walls were ineffective in the 2011 tsunami, which washed over four-storey buildings. < ref name= " butrun " / > 
 
 To mark the 30th anniversary in 1990, a bilingual Spanish-Japanese plaque was installed, with a message from President [[Patricio Aylwin]] of Chile, accompanied by a replica [[moai]] statue.  The plaque survived the 2011 tsunami. < ref name= " chileplaque " / >
