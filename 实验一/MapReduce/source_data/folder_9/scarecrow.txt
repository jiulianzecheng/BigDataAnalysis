 A '''scarecrow''' is a figure usually made of sticks. It looks like a person. It is dressed in old clothes. A [[farmer]] puts a scarecrow in a field after he has planted seeds. He hopes the scarecrow will frighten [[bird]]s away from the field. Some birds {{mdash}} such as [[crow]]s and [[sparrow]]s {{mdash}} eat the seeds the farmer plants. He does not want the birds to do this. If the birds eat the seeds, the farmer will not have a big crop of things to eat. < ref name= " Shorter OED " > Lesley Brown (ed.). (2007).
