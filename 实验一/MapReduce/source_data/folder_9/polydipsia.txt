'''Polydipsia''' is excessive [[thirst]] or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος (''poludípsios'')  " very thirsty " , which is gotten from πολύς (''polús'',  " much, many " ) + δίψα (''dípsa'',  " thirst " ). Polydipsia is a [[symptom]] in many [[disease]]s. It also occurs as a weird behaviour in some [[animal]]s, such as in [[bird]]s. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Hamm|first1=Robert J.|last2=Porter|first2=Joseph H.|last3=Kaempf|first3=George L.|title=Stimulus Generalization of Schedule-Induced Polydipsia|date=1981|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=93–99|doi=10.1901/jeab.1981.36-93|pmc=1333055|pmid=16812235}}{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 == Causes == 
 
 === Diabetes === 
 Polydipsia can be a symptom of [[diabetes mellitus]]. It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. [[Diabetes insipidus]] can also cause polydipsia. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 === Other physiological causes === 
 It can also be caused by a change in the [[osmolality]] of the [[extracellular fluid]]s of the body, [[hypokalemia]], decreased [[blood]] volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Diagnosis == 
 Polydipsia is a symptom and not a [[disease]] in itself. Polydipsia investigations at [[Diagnosis|diagnosing]] diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
