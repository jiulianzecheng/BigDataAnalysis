 '''Gnosticism''' is a group of [[religious]] ideas from around the [[1st century]].  " '''{{lang|grc|Gnosis}}''' "  is the [[ancient Greek]] word for  " knowledge " , but now more closely means  " [[esoteric]] knowledge " . < ref > Keller, P. (2021, December 16).

 The word  " Gnostic "  was mostly used by people who were against these ideas. For this reason, some [[researcher]]s have said that Gnosticism is a {{em|false grouping}} of many separate religious movements. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Reflections on the Category Gnosticism|journal=Forum|series=3rd|publisher=Polebridge Press|edition=Spring 2016|url=http://westarinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Forum-51-Reflections-on-the-Category-Gnosticism.pdf|access-date=2021-01-12|archive-date=2021-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210103195630/http://westarinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Forum-51-Reflections-on-the-Category-Gnosticism.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  There are many problems for people who research Gnosticism: < ref name=Pagels1989/ > 
 # Many Gnostic teachings were [[esoteric]], meaning they were kept secret or hidden 
 # A lot of what is known about Gnostic beliefs came from attacks written by non-Gnostic [[Christians]] 
 # Almost all Gnostic writings were destroyed by non-Gnostic Christians who wanted to wipe them out 
 
 == Beliefs == 
 [[Gnosticism]] says that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in the ordinary physical (or ''material'') world.  They say that the world was made by an imperfect [[spirit]]. 
 
 The imperfect spirit is thought to be the same as the [[God]] of [[Abraham]]. The imperfect spirit may be seen as evil, or sometimes just not perfect but doing the best it can.   
 
 The real [[God]] who is good, is distant and not easy to know. In order to get free from the material world, a person has to get ''gnosis''.  That is the special secret knowledge given only to a few special people.  
 
 Some Gnostic groups saw [[Jesus]] as sent by the supreme being, to bring ''gnosis'' to the Earth.
