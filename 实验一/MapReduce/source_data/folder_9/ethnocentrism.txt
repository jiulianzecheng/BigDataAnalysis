'''Ethnocentrism''' is when a person tries to judge the [[culture]] of other people from the [[point of view]] of their own culture.  Ethnocentrism can look at things like [[language]], [[custom]], [[religion]] and [[behavior]]. 
 
 An ethnocentric person will use their own culture as the [[base|basis]] for judging other cultures. They see their own culture as the best and believe other cultures should change to be more like theirs. 
 
 The term was first used by [[sociology|sociologist]] [[William G Sumner]]. He defined it as “the [[technical]] name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it”. (PS this is more exclusive word for  " racist " ) 
 
 == Ethnocentrism and anthropology == 
 All people tend to use the values of the culture we were born in. One of the main goals of [[anthropology]] is to not use ethnocentric ideas. Anthropologists try to see other cultures from the point of view of a person from that culture . This is also known as ''[[cultural relativism]]''. It is the idea that goes against the idea that some things are always the same in every human culture ([[human universal]]s). Cultural relativism says that all human action is [[relative]] to the culture where the action happens. Anthropologists know that they have to not use the [[standard]]s of their own culture if they want to understand another [[society]] correctly.
