 A '''minesweeper''' is a small [[naval]] [[warship]] designed to sweep the water clear of [[naval mine|mines]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the U.S. Military|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199891580|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199891580.001.0001/acref-9780199891580-e-5170?rskey=RQ9uw5 & result=1 & q=minesweeper|chapter=minesweeper}} < /ref >   Minesweepers keep [[waterway]] < nowiki/ > s clear for shipping. They are quieter and less magnetic than other ships, so the mines won't explode when being swept. 
 
 In [[Great Britain]], naval leaders knew before [[World War I]] that sea mines were a threat to the nation's shipping. The real threat was not [[invasion]], but [[blockade]] aided by mines. [[Fishing net|Fishing nets]] pulled behind boats gave an idea on how to clear mines. The [[Royal Navy]] used fishermen and their f[[fishing trawler|ishing trawlers]] to keep the [[English Channel]] clear of mines. < ref > {{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Sir Reginald|title=The Dover patrol 1915-1917|year=1919|publisher= Doran |pages=146|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ceBCAAAAIAAJ & rdid=book-ceBCAAAAIAAJ & rdot=1}} < /ref >  They were supplied with mine gear, rifles, uniforms and pay as the first minesweepers. < ref > {{cite book |last= Hawkins |first= Nigel |title= The starvation blockades: naval blockades of WW1 |publisher= U.S. Naval Institute Press |pages= 60–61 |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-85052-908-5}}) < /ref >   
 
 The dedicated, purpose-built minesweeper first appeared during [[World War I]]. By the end of the war, naval mine technology had grown beyond the ability of minesweepers to detect and remove. < ref name=OUPmaritime > {{cite book|last=Hattendorf|first=John B.|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of maritime history|year=2007|publisher=Oxford Univ.

 Minesweeping made big advances during [[World War II|World War]] 2.  Fighting nations quickly adapted ships to the task of minesweeping. < ref > {{cite book|last=Dennis|first=Peter|title=The Oxford companion to Australian military history.|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=9780195517842|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195517842.001.0001/acref-9780195517842-e-149?rskey=tP17bb & result=12 & q=minesweeper|edition=2nd|author2=Jeffrey Grey |author3=Ewan Morris |author4=Robin Prior |author5=Jean Bou |chapter=Auxiliary Minesweepers}} < /ref >   Both [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Axis countries|Axis]] countries made heavy use of minesweepers throughout the war.
