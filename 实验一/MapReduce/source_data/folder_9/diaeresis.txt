The '''diaeresis''' (plural: '''diaereses''') is also spelled diæresis or dieresis. It is a [[diacritic|diacritical mark]]: two dots ( ¨ ) put over a letter, usually a [[vowel]]. 
 
 It is most often used in this way: 
 
 *With a diacritic, one vowel is sounded separately from its neighbour. So, in the word ''zöology'', it is pronounced as a long 'o' followed by a short 'o'. < ref > Because its origin in Ancient Greek was ζῷον, written with the long 'o' first. < /ref >  Without the diaeresis, it might be pronounced like the word 'zoo'. It is sometimes described as  " two vowel sounds occurring in adjacent [[syllable]]s " . It is often used in names where the last vowel is sounded, as in ''Chloë'' or ''Brontë''. 
 
 *[[Umlaut]]s: A diacritic above a vowel can mark a sound shift, forming a new letter (Ä, Ö, Ü).
