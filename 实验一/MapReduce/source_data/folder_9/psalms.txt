 '''Psalms''' ({{lang-he|תְהִלִּים}}, ''Tehillim'', or  " praises " ) is a [[book]] of 150 [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[poem]]s in the [[Bible]]. The Book of Psalms is the first [[Ketuvim]] and part of the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Tanakh]], and it is also in the [[Old Testament]] of the Christian translations. People traditionally believe that many of the Psalms in the Bible were written by King [[David]] to God. Perhaps the most famous one is Psalm 23, which starts  " The [[Yahweh|LORD]] is my shepherd " . Psalm 23 is often used for funerals. In the [[Qur'an]], the Arabic word ‘Zabur’ is used for the Psalms of David. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKgFz3hEl3cC & dq=zabur+psalms+traditionally & pg=PA155 |title=The Bible - Google Books |date= |accessdate=2022-09-24}} < /ref >   
 
 There are 150 Psalms in the [[Biblical canon]] of [[Jew]]s, [[Protestant]]s, and [[Catholic]]s, but there are also more poems that these religions do not think are holy. [[Psalm 151]] is part of [[canon]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. 
 
 == Name == 
 The names  " Psalms "  and  " Psalter "  come from the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation of the Old Testament). < ref > A psalter is a volume containing the Book of Psalms < /ref >  There, they were about stringed instruments (for example, the [[harp]], [[lyre]] and [[lute]]), then to songs sung with them. < ref name= " niv " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nivstudybibleper00kenn|title=NIV Study Bible|last=|first=|publisher=Publishing House|year=1995|isbn=9780310925682|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|pages=|doi=|id=}} < /ref >  The traditional Hebrew title is ''tehillim''. ''Tehillim'' means  " praises " , though many of the psalms are ''tephillot'' ( " prayers " ). One of the first collections in the book was titled  " the prayers of David son of Jesse "  (72:20, NIV). < ref name=niv/ > 
 
 == Literary features == 
 
 The Psalter is [[poetry]], though it has many prayers and not all Old Testament prayers were poetic. In fact, not all praise was poetic either. The Psalms are full of images, comparisons and [[metaphor]]. The Hebrew text often plays with words and repeats the same words, adding synonyms (words with the same meaning) to fill out the description. Important words show the main themes in the prayer or song.
