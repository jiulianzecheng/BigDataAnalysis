 In [[geology]], '''permafrost''' is [[soil]] that stays frozen all year.  To be called permafrost, soil must stay at or below {{convert|0|C}} for two or more years. Permafrost is also called '''cryotic soil'''.  Most permafrost is on land close to the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole|South]] poles.  Other permafrost is found in high mountain areas.  < ref > {{cite journal|last=Schuur|first=Ted |authorlink= |title=Thawing Permafrost Would Accelerate Global Warming.
