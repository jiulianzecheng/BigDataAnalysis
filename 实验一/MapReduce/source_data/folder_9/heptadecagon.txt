[[File:Heptadecagon.svg|thumb|A heptadecagon]] 
 A '''heptadecagon''' or '''septadecagon''' or '''17-gon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 17 sides and 17 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular heptadecagon == 
 All sides of a '''regular heptadecagon''' are the same length. Each corner is 158.82°. All corners added together equal 2700°. 
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular heptadecagon takes up is 
 
 The [[area]] of a [[Regular polygon|regular]] heptadecagon of side length ''a'' is given by 
 : < math > A = \frac{17}{4}a^2\cot\frac{\pi}{17}\simeq 22,735a^2 < /math > 
 
 === Heptadecagon construction === 
 The regular heptadecagon edit geometry compass and ruler in 1796, demonstrated [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. 
 
 This is due to [[Göttingen]] of a memorial statue of a regular heptadecagon pedestal.
