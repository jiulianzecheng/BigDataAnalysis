 A '''sniper''' is a person who is trained to shoot perfectly at things that are very small or very far away. The sniper's target is usually an [[enemy]]. Many military snipers get special training to use a [[sniper rifle]], a special type of gun. Most sniper rifles have a [[telescope]] called a [[sniper scope]] to help the sniper see the target. Snipers are also trained to be [[wikt:stealth|stealthy]]. Snipers hide or use [[military camouflage]] such as a [[ghillie suit]] that looks like (and may include some of) the surrounding [[foliage]] so that it is hard for the enemy to see them. A sniper is also called a  " marksman " . 
 
 Experienced [[Hunting|hunters]] often share many of the skills that [[Long range shooting|long range shooters]] need to know. The two jobs are very similar. The word  " sniper "  came from Britain when highly accurate shooters would hunt–also known as  " snipe " –birds that were very hard to see and shoot. < ref name= " etymology " > {{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=s & p=29 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Snipe |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2007-09-27}} < /ref > 
 
 Many police departments have snipers on their [[SWAT team]]s. < ref name= " cbssniper " > {{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60II/main267184.shtml |title=The Sniper, SWAT Teams Grow In Number |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=2008-10-02 |archive-date=2012-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104001301/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/25/60ii/main267184.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Because police snipers do not always perform the same tasks as military snipers, police snipers are sometimes known as  " marksmen " . 
 
 ==Sniping== 
 Snipers shoot targets that are far away. Because the bullet shot by a sniper has to travel a very long distance, the sniper has to be very careful when taking aim. There are three main things that have an effect on the accuracy of the shot. The sniper must plan for these things. 
 * The target may be moving, such as walking or running. A sniper must think about where the target will be when the bullet reaches it. A still target might move suddenly. 
 * The force of [[gravity]] affects the bullet, so that it will drop towards the ground. If the target is close, the effect of gravity does not have a big effect on the accuracy. If the target is far distant, then the sniper must judge how high to shoot, to make up for the distance that the bullet will fall as it flies. < ref name= " GSU " > [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/grav.html Hyperphysics, by Georgia State University] on bullet drop. Accessed October 10, 2008 < /ref > 
 * [[Wind]] affects the way in which a bullet will travel and can blow it away from the target. The sniper must think about the direction that the wind is blowing and the strength of the wind. The sniper might need to shoot to the left or the right of the target, to make up for the wind. < ref name= " Matt " > {{cite web

 The bullets used by snipers are usually heavy. They are powered by a large amount of [[gunpowder]]. < ref name= " HeavyBullet " > [http://www.theoutdoorwriter.com/shooting/heavy_bullet.htm The Heavy Bullet Advantage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414151007/http://www.theoutdoorwriter.com/shooting/heavy_bullet.htm |date=2012-04-14 }}.

 ===Sniper rifles=== 
 [[File:Sako TRG folding stock + Zeiss 3-12x56 SSG P.JPG|thumb|Sako TRG 42 Sniper rifle|250px]] 
 {{main|Sniper rifle}} 
 A sniper uses a special kind of rifle called a [[sniper rifle]]. This rifle is much more accurate than normal rifles. < ref name=GunRu / >  Almost all sniper rifles use a [[Sniper scope]], a special [[telescope]] that allows them to see targets very far away. There are two different kinds of sniper rifles: [[bolt action]] rifles, which fire a single shot and then must be readied for the next shot, < ref name= " M110 " > {{cite web |url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=246

 Typically, bolt-action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi-automatic rifles, < ref name= " GunRu " > {{cite web

 }} < /ref >  however the [[rate of fire]] is slower than a semi-automatic rifle, which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger. At close ranges, or where a shooter must make a quick follow-up shot, a sniper may prefer to use a semi-automatic rifle instead. 
 A magazine is used on semi automatic rifles and most bolt action rifles. Magazines hold more shots in the gun and make it much faster to ready the next shot. < ref name=M110 / > 
 
 ===Camouflage=== 
 {{main|Military camouflage}} 
 Snipers usually wear camouflage clothing, to avoid being seen. < ref name= " Deception " > Jon Latimer, ''Deception in War'', London: John Murray, 2001 < /ref >  Camouflage works by hiding the outline and shape of the human body, so that it is not easily seen. Camouflage does not work very well when the person wearing it is moving because the eye sees movement much better than shapes or colors. < ref name= " DPM " >

 Police snipers generally do not need camouflage, because their main job is to make accurate shots, not to hide from the criminal. < ref name= " cbssniper "  / > < ref name= " PoliceRoof " > {{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/photos/2007/09/06/2025679.htm |title=Police sniper watches from roof, Sydney |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=September 6, 2007}} < /ref >  Sometimes police need to hide, so police snipers are trained in hiding techniques. < ref name= " Gastonia " > {{cite web|url=http://www.cityofgastonia.com/city_serv/police/teams/SniperPage.cfm|title=Gastonia Police Department - Sniper School|accessdate=2008-05-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921091959/http://www.cityofgastonia.com/city_serv/police/teams/SniperPage.cfm|archivedate=2012-09-21|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Snipers in War== 
 {{main|Reconnaissance}} 
 [[File:USMC Sniper M24.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] sniper in training|200px]] 
 
 Military snipers are chosen for their intelligence, their good sight and their ability to shoot very well. They are trained to use their [[sight]] very well. They are trained to see the enemy from far away, and to notice small movements that might show that enemies are near. They are also trained to hide themselves. Snipers use these skills to destroy enemy troops. Snipers generally work in a small unit (or team) of just two people, a sniper and a [[spotter]]. < ref name= " Spotter " > {{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/sniper2.htm |title=How Stuff Works: Spotters and Sniper Teams |date=June 11, 2004 |publisher= How Stuff Works |accessdate=2008-10-02}} < /ref >  The spotter finds targets for the sniper with a telescope. If the sniper misses the target, then the spotter also helps the sniper adjust the next shot so it hits the target. < ref name=Spotter / >  The spotter also protects the sniper from enemies at close range. < ref name=Spotter / > 
 
 Snipers are often used as [[reconnaissance|scouts]] for the army because they can easily hide themselves from the enemy, even when they are close. < ref name= " GS " > {{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/sniper.htm |title= Global Security: Sniper Rifles | publisher= Global Security | accessdate=2008-10-02}} < /ref >  They use the sniper scope on their rifles to see farther than most soldiers are able to see. < ref name=GS / >  Snipers are often able to notice details and remember information that ordinary soldiers would not. < ref name= " KIMS " > {{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/sniper10.htm |title= KIMS Training at U.S. Army Ranger Sniper School |date= June 11, 2004 |publisher= How Stuff Works |accessdate=2008-10-02}} < /ref >  When a sniper is in a team with a spotter, it is usually the spotter's job to use a radio to speak with other military units. The team can report on the enemy position and enemy movements. < ref name =  " SniperAtWar " > {{cite book| last = Haskew| first = Michael E.| title = The Sniper at War: From the American Revolutionary War to the Present Day| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QnmyjViuPrUC & pg=PA164| year = 2005| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-33651-6| page = 164 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Snipers in World War I and II===

 [[File:Pav-Stamp.jpg|thumb|Russian postage stamp depicting a sniper|200px]] 
 
 In [[World War I]] (WWI), there were no special [[sniper rifle]]s. Instead, snipers used normal rifles with a [[sniper scope]] mounted on them. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/rifles.htm|title=Snipers in WWI}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[World War II]], snipers were common. They were an important part of the fighting. Every squad of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] army included sniper or a 'marksman'. Camouflage tactics were [[wikt:develop|developed]] during this time. Snipers were very useful during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. One Russian sniper was said to have killed over 240 German troops. Even that wasn't the best. Mihail Surkov killed 702 enemy troops and Semen Nomokonov killed 367 by sniping, including a general. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://wio.ru/galgrnd/sniper/sniper.htm|title=top WWII snipers|accessdate=2008-10-13}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Police snipers== 
 Police departments train and use snipers. These snipers mainly serve on the [[SWAT team]] for their department. < ref name=Gastonia / >  Often they are called upon to provide security at special events, or to make sure that other snipers do not murder someone. < ref name=PoliceRoof / >  This job is called [[counter-sniping]]. < ref name=PoliceRoof / >  Most police snipers are trained by the military. < ref name=Gastonia / > 
 
 ==Famous snipers== 
 Some snipers are famous for having killed hundreds of enemy soldiers. One such sniper is U.S. Marine Corps sniper [[Carlos Hathcock]], who was famous in the [[Vietnam War]] for wearing a white feather in his hat. < ref name= " Hathcockshot " > {{cite web |quote=...famous Hathcock shot that killed an enemy from more than {{convert|2500|yd|m|0}} away... |publisher=Marine Corps News |accessdate=2008-10-02 |date=March 29, 2007 |title=Range complex named after famous Vietnam sniper |url=http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/2007329115513 |author=Lance Cpl.

 Simo Häyhä (the White Death,bielaja smjert) has more documented kills than any other sniper in history. 
 
 == Snipers in popular culture == 
 Snipers are often used in video games as [[wikt:elite|elite]] soldiers. Getting a [[headshot]] with a sniper rifle is thought of as a hard skill to learn.
