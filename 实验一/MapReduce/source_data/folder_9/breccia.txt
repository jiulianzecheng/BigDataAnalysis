 '''Breccia''' < ref > {{lang-it| meaning 'breach'}} pronounced 'brechia' < /ref >  is a type of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] formed of broken fragments of [[minerals]] or rock [[cement]]ed together by a fine-grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.meteorlab.com/METEORLAB2001dev/glossary.htm|title=Glossary of Meteoritical Terms|work=meteorlab.com|year=2003|access-date=24 July 2012|archive-date=25 December 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011225024208/http://www.meteorlab.com/METEORLAB2001dev/glossary.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The matrix may be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments.  
 
 Rocks formed by sticking together pieces of previous rocks ([[clast]]s) are called [[clastic rock]]s. There are two types of clastic rock: [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]]s and breccias. What divides these two categories is the amount of rounding. The particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded, whereas in breccias they are angular. 
 
 == Origins == 
 A breccia may have a variety of different origins, as indicated by the named types including [[sedimentary]] breccia, [[tectonics|tectonic]] breccia, [[igneous]] breccia, impact breccia and [[hydrothermal]] breccia. 
 
 The basic sequence is as follows. Sediment is laid down in the sea, and is gradually transformed into sedimentary rock. After a long period of time something violent happens to the rock, breaking it up into many jagged pieces. Later the pieces are cemented together by another deposition, forming a new sedimentary rock. This is a breccia. On examination, the rock is seen to include fragments of the original rock. 
 
 == Ornament == 
 Brecciated [[marble]] can have a marvellous appearance. The [[Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] is full of the most wonderful marble, many of which are breccias. It includes two gigantic columns of [[pavonazzetto]], a breccia coming from [[Phrygia]] (in modern [[Turkey]]). Pavonazzetto obtains its name from its extremely colourful appearance, which is reminiscent of a [[peacock]]'s feathers (''pavone'' is  " peacock "  in [[Italian language|Italian]]).
