 == History == 
 The dance is thought to have come from about 5,000 years ago when the [[Koreans]] believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the world. The people (almost always girls in [[hanbok]]s) would dance under the brightest full [[moon]] of the year in order to bring a good harvest. 
 
 In the 16th century, when the [[Japan]]ese were [[attack]]ing Korea, Korea's Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] ordered women to do this dance. He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into [[wikt:overestimate|overestimating]] them. The women were said to have worn [[military]] [[uniform]]s and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산). < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0301 & view_cont_seq=12 & code=St1 & sys_lang=Eng|title= Ganggang Sullae, Thanksgiving Day Festival|access-date= 2011-04-22|archive-date= 2015-05-21|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150521100757/http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv2/ALegacy_Archive.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0301 & view_cont_seq=12 & code=St1 & sys_lang=Eng|url-status= dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.invil.org/english/tourism/themeTour/assetsTemple/contents.jsp?con_no=371874 & page_no=1|title= Ganggangsullae of Sopo|access-date= 2011-04-22|archive-date= 2009-06-09|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090609170416/http://www.invil.org/english/tourism/themeTour/assetsTemple/contents.jsp?con_no=371874 & page_no=1|url-status= dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.prkorea.com/engnews/index.cgi?action=detail & number=400 & thread=10r01|title= Ganggangsullae|access-date= 2011-04-22|archive-date= 2011-06-10|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610212458/http://www.prkorea.com/engnews/index.cgi?action=detail & number=400 & thread=10r01|url-status= dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " Lee E-hwa " > {{cite book|title=Korea's pastimes and customs: A Social History|last=Yi|first=I-hwa|date=2006|publisher=Homa  &  Sekey Books|isbn=978-1-931907-38-5|pages=170–172|translator-last=Ju-Hee Park}} < /ref >

 == Description == 
 
 Traditionally, this dance performed without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in hanbok, traditional Korean [[clothes|clothing]], hold hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line. Then, the rest of the people all sing, 'ganggangsullae'. Then the lead singer sings another line, and the rest of the people reply, 'ganggangsullae'. This is probably where the name of the song came from. As the dance continues, the [[tempo]] of the song can get faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and wants. During the dance, the women also play some  games. The ganggangsullae can last until dawn. < ref name= " translation " > {{cite book| last = Yi| first = I-hwa| title = Korea's pastimes and customs: A Social History| date = 2006| publisher = Homa  &  Sekey Books| isbn = 1931907382| pages = 170–172| author2 = Ju-Hee Park (translation) }} < /ref >
