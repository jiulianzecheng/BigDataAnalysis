A '''pictograph''' < ref > Gove, Philip Babcock. (1993). Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged. Merriam-Webster Inc. {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}. < /ref >   (sometimes also called '''pictogramme''' or '''pictogram''') is a small [[drawing]].  Today, pictograms are used very often. Because they are independent of the [[language]], they are often used where there are people who need to understand things, even if they do not read or speak the language. Pictograms are also often used where it is important to understand something fast. Sight is faster than reading. That way, pictograms are often used for signalling in [[emergency]] situations, such as showing emergency exits. 
 
 Common uses include those for [[road sign]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[train station]], and [[warning sign]]s.
