 '''INXS''' were an [[Australia]]n [[rock music|rock]] band. The band became popular during the 1980s. They formed in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia in 1977. They did not get international attention until around 1982 when their third album came out. 
 
 INXS was originally called  " The Farriss Brothers and it started with 3 members: Andrew, Tim, and Jon Farriss. They were all brothers. In 1978, 3 more people joined the band; [[Michael Hutchence]] (1960-1997), Garry Gary Beers, and Kirk Pengilly. After the band expanded their line-up, they changed their name to INXS, which is pronounced as  " in excess " . 
 
 Hutchence was the singer of INXS until he died. A man named Jon Stevens was his temporary replacement for about 5 years. After Jon Stevens left, the other 5 members did a television show called  " Rock Star INXS "  to choose a permanent replacement for Michael Hutchence. A [[Canada|Canadian]] man named J.D, Fortune won the show and became the new singer for INXS. 
 
 The most famous song by INXS is  " [[Need You Tonight]] "  which came out in 1987. Some of their other songs are  " [[What You Need]] " ,  " [[The One Thing]] " , and  " [[New Sensation]] " .
