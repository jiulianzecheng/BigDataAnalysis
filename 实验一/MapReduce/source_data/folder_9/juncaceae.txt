 The '''Juncaceae''', the '''rush family''', is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of rather small plants that often look like a type of [[grass]]. They often grow on wet, infertile soils. There are about 400 [[species]] organised into eight [[genus|genera]]. ''[[Juncus]]'' is the most well-known and largest [[genus]] in the Juncaceae family. 
 
 They are one of the [[monocot]] [[flowering plant]] families, which means that their seeds only have one leaf to start off new growth.  
 
 Rushes are found all around the world. They are commonly found in wet [[marsh]]y areas, as the plant prefers moist soil. However, [[seedling]]s can survive dormant once well established even in the driest of places. Seeds spread by water or birds and other animals. They can live for up to 50 years lying dormant in [[drought]]s. 
 
 Rushes are a basic food of many animal diets. They are also used as bedding and [[nest]]ing material for many different types of birds and mammals. Rushes have been used throughout history by humans for various purposes such as [[weaving]] matts, medicine and animal feed. Today they are still used in some places for making sleeping mats but are mostly used as a decorative plant around ponds.
