 '''Ambazonia,''' officially the '''Federal Republic of Ambazonia''' is a [[Secession|secessionist]] state of [[Cameroon]], self-proclamed in its [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] regions. De facto, [[Buea]] is the capital. It is bordered by Cameroon to the east, [[Nigeria]] to the west and [[Bioko|Bioko island]] to the south east on the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. 
 
 Until 1961, Ambazonia was a British-controlled territory known as the [[Southern Cameroons]], while the rest of Cameroon was French-controlled. At independence, a [[Plebiscite|referendum]] was held and the voters of the Southern Cameroons chose to join Cameroon as a constituent state of a federal republic known as the [[Federal Republic of Cameroon]]. Over time, the power of the central government, dominated by French-speaking Cameroonians, has spread to the disadvantage of the region's [[autonomy]]. Many residents identify themselves as [[Anglophone Cameroonian|Anglophones]] and resent what they perceive as [[discrimination]] and the attempts of the Cameroonian government to eradicate Anglophone [[Law|legal]], administrative, [[Education|educational]] and [[Culture|cultural]] [[Institution|institutions]]. 
 
 In 2016 and 2017, a demonstration was met with a violent government repression, which resulted in [[Riot|riots]] and [[violence]] against the security forces and, in 2017, a one-sided declaration of independence by the Ambazonian leadership. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/who-are-cameroons-self-named-ambazonia-secessionists/a-50639426|title=Who are Cameroon's self-named Ambazonia secessionists? |date=30 September 2019 |publisher=DW |language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-07}} < /ref >  The violence escalated into [[guerrilla warfare]] and, since 2021, clashes have continued, with population centres and strategic locations largely controlled by the government engaged in counterinsurgency actions, while large parts of more isolated rural areas are controlled by the separatists and used to launch guerrilla attacks. Ambazonian forces have found it difficult to form a united front, and internal conflicts have obstructed efforts to negotiate with Cameroon or to establish control over the various militias involved in the war. < ref name= " newhumanitarianfeb62020 " > [https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/02/06/Cameroon-elections-anglophone-separatist-insurgency-Ambazonia Briefing: Cameroon's intensifying conflict and what it means for civilians], The New Humanitarian, 6 February 2020.
