 The '''Artiodactyla''' are '''even-toed ungulates''', an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[mammal]]s. They have an even number of [[toe]]s: two or four. For example, [[camelid]]s or animals of the [[Giraffidae]] [[family (biology)|family]] have two toes, but [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]] have four toes. 
 
 [[Whale]]s are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related super-order [[Cetartiodactyla]] because their ancestors were even toed ungulates. 
 
 == Digestion == 
 Some artiodactyls are [[ruminant]]s (Ruminantia and Tylopoda). They ruminate their food—they regurgitate and re-chew it. This is a very important evolutionary advance.  Their stomachs are divided into three to four sections. < ref name= " EoM " > {{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher=Facts on File|year=1984|isbn=978-0-87196-871-5|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/498 498–499]|editor=Macdonald, D.|author1=Janis, C.|author2=Jarman, P.|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofma00mals_0/page/498}} < /ref >   
 
 After eating, the food re-enters the mouth, where it is chewed again.  The food passes to the  " fermentation chamber "  (rumen and reticulum), where [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], and [[fungi]]) help to break down the [[cellulose]] found in plant material. < ref name= " EoM " / >   
 
 This form of digestion has two advantages: ruminants can digest plants that are indigestible to other species, and they can take less time in eating.  The animal spends only a short time out in the open with his head to the ground—rumination can happen later, in a sheltered area. < ref name= " Shively1985 " > {{cite journal |author=Shively, C.
