 '''Naloxone''' (often called '''Narcan'''), is a [[medication]].  It is used to reverse the effects of [[opioid]] [[analgesic|painkillers]], especially when a person has [[overdose]]d on opioids. < ref name=AHFS2015/ >   Examples of opioids include:  
 * [[Morphine]] (often called MSIR or MS Contin) 
 * [[Oxycodone]] (often called Percocet (when mixed with [[acetaminophen]]), OxyIR, or OxyContin) 
 * [[Hydrocodone]] (often called Vicodin when mixed with acetaminophen) 
 * [[Methadone]] 
 * [[Meperidine]] (Demerol) 
 
 These painkillers are [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]s.  This means they slow down certain areas of the [[brain]].  If a person takes too many opiates, this can shut down the part of the brain that controls [[breathing]].  The person may become unable to breathe and die. 
 
 When a person has taken too much of one of these painkillers, naloxone can reverse the painkillers' effects and save the person's life. 
 
 Naloxone may be mixed into the same pill as an opioid painkiller to decrease the risk of [[substance abuse|misuse]]. < !--  < ref name=AHFS2015/ >  -- >   
 
 When given intravenously (into a needle placed into a [[vein]]), naloxone works within two minutes.  When injected into a [[muscular system|muscle]], it works within five minutes. < ref name=AHFS2015/ >  The medication may also be shot up the nose. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=James R.|title=Roberts and Hedges' clinical procedures in emergency medicine|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|location=London|isbn=9781455748594|page=476|edition=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyLreFkHuIC & pg=PA476}} < /ref >   
 
 The effects of naloxone last about half an hour to an hour. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Bosack|first1=Robert|title=Anesthesia Complications in the Dental Office|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons|isbn=9781118828625|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rn51BwAAQBAJ & pg=PA191}} < /ref >   Since most opioids last longer than naloxone, a person may need several doses of naloxone to fight the effects of an overdose. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > 
 
 ==How does naloxone work?== 
 When a person takes opioids, the opioids have to attach to certain receptor sites in the brain in order to work, like a lock in a keyhole.  Once the opioids attach to these opiate receptor sites - like a lock fitting into a keyhole - the opiates start to work.  They kill pain, create [[euphoria]], and make people feel calm and relaxed.  But if a person takes too many opiates, they can also make it impossible to [[breathing|breathe]]. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > 
 
 Naloxone fits better onto these opiate receptor sites than actual opiates do.  If a person takes naloxone, the naloxone will throw any opiate off of the opiate receptor sites (like a key getting taken out of a door).  Naloxone will stay attached to these opiate receptor sites.  This reverses the effects of the opiates that the person took. 
 
 ==Side effects== 
 Naloxone reverses the effects of opiates.  Because of this, if a person who is [[addiction|addicted]] to opiates gets naloxone, they will have symptoms of opioid ''withdrawal''.  People have withdrawal symptoms when their body gets used to having opiates all the time. 
 
 Because naloxone reverses the effects of opiates, the [[side effect]]s of naloxone can include restlessness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], pain, and sweating. < !--  < ref name=AHFS2015/ >  -- >  To prevent this, small doses every few minutes can be given until the desired effect is reached. < !--  < ref name=AHFS2015/ >  -- >   
 
 Naloxone has to be given carefully to people with [[heart disease]].  Naloxone can cause more [[heart]] problems, like [[Cardiac arrhythmia|changes in the rhythm of the heart beat]], in these people. < ref name=AHFS2015 > {{cite web|title=Naloxone Hydrochloride| url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/naloxone-hydrochloride.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Jan 2, 2015}} < /ref >   
 
 Naloxone seems to be safe in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. < ref name=TGA2014 > {{cite web|title=Prescribing medicines in pregnancy database|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/hp/medicines-pregnancy.htm#.U1Yw8Bc3tqw|work=Australian Government|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=3 March 2014}} < /ref >  Naloxone is a pure [[opioid antagonist]]. < !--  < ref name=AHFS2015/ >  -- >   
 
 In rare cases, naloxone causes [[seizure]]s and pulmonary edema ([[fluid]] in the [[lung]]s). < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/sfx/naloxone-side-effects.html |title=Naloxone Side Effects in Detail |website=Drugs.com |author= |accessdate=5 May 2015}} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid3662194 " > {{cite journal | author = Schwartz JA, Koenigsberg MD | title = Naloxone-induced pulmonary edema | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1294–6 |date=November 1987  | pmid = 3662194 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(87)80244-5 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 Naloxone was [[patent]]ed in 1961 by Jack Fishman, Mozes J. Lewenstein, and the company Daiichi Sankyo. < !--  < ref name= " nyti_Jack " / >  -- >  The drug was approved for opioid overdose by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1971. < ref name= " nyti_Jack " > {{Cite web| title = Jack Fishman Dies at 83; Saved Many From Overdose| last = Yardley | first = William| work = New York Times| date = 14 December 2013| accessdate = 2015-07-06| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/business/jack-fishman-who-helped-develop-a-drug-to-treat-overdoses-dies-at-83.html?_r=0}} < /ref >  It is on the [[World Health Organization]]'s Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. < ref > {{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}} < /ref >   
 
 Naloxone is available as a [[generic drug|generic medication]] and is not very expensive. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > < ref > {{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richard J.|title=Tarascon pocket pharmacopoeia : 2014 classic shirt-pocket edition|date=2013|publisher=Jones  &  Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury|isbn=9781284053982|page=174|edition=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0KFAgAAQBAJ & pg=PA174}} < /ref >  Its wholesale price is between $0.50 and $5.30 [[United States dollar|USD]] per dose. < ref > {{cite web|title=Naloxone HCL|url=http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english & code=NAL04A & s_year=2014 & year=2014 & str=0%2E4%20mg%2Fml & desc=Naloxone%20HCl & pack=new & frm=AMPOULE & rte=INJ & class_code2=04%2E2%2E & supplement= & class_name=%2804%2E2%2E%29Specific%20antidotes%3Cbr%3E|website=International Drug Price Indicator Guide|accessdate=13 August 2015}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Medical uses== 
 
 === Opiate overdose === 
 Naloxone can be used to reverse opioid overdose and to reduce the slowed breathing or mental depression that opioids can cause. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > 
 
 Naloxone is included as a part of emergency overdose response kits distributed to [[heroin]] and other opioid drug users.  This has been shown to reduce deaths due to overdose. < ref name= " pmid16956873 " > {{cite journal | author = Maxwell S, Bigg D, Stanczykiewicz K, Carlberg-Racich S | title = Prescribing naloxone to actively injecting heroin users: a program to reduce heroin overdose deaths | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-addictive-diseases_2006_25_3/page/89 | journal = J Addict Dis | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 89–96 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16956873 | doi = 10.1300/J069v25n03_11 | s2cid = 17246459 }} < /ref >   
 
 A prescription for naloxone is recommended if a person is: < ref > {{cite journal|author=Lazarus P |title=Project Lazarus, Wilkes County, North Carolina: Policy Briefing Document Prepared for the North Carolina Medical Board in Advance of the Public Hearing Regarding Prescription Naloxone |year=2007|location=Raleigh, NC |page = 8}} < /ref > 
 * On a high dose of opioid (over 100 & nbsp;mg of morphine a day, or an equal amount of another opiate); 
 * Is [[prescription|prescribed]] any dose of opioid along with a [[benzodiazepine]]; or 
 * Is suspected or known to [[Substance abuse|abuse]] opioids  
 
 If naloxone is prescribed to a person, that person should also be taught about how to prevent, identify, and react to an overdose, including how to perform rescue breathing, [[CPR]], and how to call an [[emergency telephone number]] like [[9-1-1]]. < ref name= " pmid23664112 " > {{cite journal | author = Bowman S, Eiserman J, Beletsky L, Stancliff S, Bruce RD | title = Reducing the health consequences of opioid addiction in primary care | journal = Am. J. Med. | volume = 126 | issue = 7 | pages = 565–71 |date=July 2013  | pmid = 23664112 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.11.031 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Preventing opioid abuse === 
 Naloxone may be mixed with a number of opioids like [[buprenorphine]].  (Buprenorphine mixed with naloxone is called Suboxone.)  Buprenorphine is used to decrease cravings for opiates.  When buprenorphine and naloxone are mixed, and taken by mouth, only buprenorphine has an effect.  But if a person misuses Suboxone by [[injection|injecting]] it or taking large doses, the naloxone blocks the effect of the opioid. < ref name=AHFS2015/ > < ref name=Orman2009 > {{cite journal|last1=Orman|first1=JS|last2=Keating|first2=GM|title=Buprenorphine/naloxone: a review of its use in the treatment of opioid dependence.|journal=Drugs|date=2009|volume=69|issue=5|pages=577–607|pmid=19368419|doi=10.2165/00003495-200969050-00006|s2cid=209147406 }} < /ref >  This combination is used to try to prevent [[substance abuse|abuse]]. < ref name=Orman2009/ >
