 A '''worm''' is an animal. It usually has no arms or legs, and a slender cylinder-like body.  
 
 Worms come in many different sizes. Some species are very small, while the [[bootlace worm]] has been known to grow up to nearly 60 meters (almost 200 feet). < ref > Mark Carwardine 1995. ''The Guinness Book of Animal Records''. Guinness Publishing, p232. < /ref >  One of the best-known types of worms are [[earthworm]]s. 
 
 Worm is not a term used by itself in animal classification. There are worms which belong to several [[Phylum|phyla]]. Examples of words include: [[Annelids]], [[nematodes]], [[platyhelminthes]], [[ribbon worms]], [[arrow worms]], [[priapulid worms]], and some [[insect]] [[larvae]]. They are all animals which may be called 'worms'. 
 
 * The [[Platyhelminthes]] includes the [[flatworm]]s, [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], and [[Trematoda|flukes]]. They have a flat, ribbon or leaf-shaped body with a pair of eyes at the front. Some are [[Parasitism|parasites]]. 
 * The second group has the [[Pinworm|threadworms]], [[Nematode|roundworms]], and [[hookworm]]s. This phylum is called the [[Nematoda]].  
 * The third group is the segmented worms: the [[Annelida|Annelids]]. Their bodies are divided into segments or rings. Among these worms are the [[earthworm]]s and the [[Polychaete|bristle worms]] of the sea. 
 
 Many unrelated [[insect]] [[larva]]e are called  " worms " , such as the [[railroad worm]], [[woodworm]], [[glowworm]], [[Midge|bloodworm]], [[Geometer moth|inchworm]], [[mealworm]], [[silkworm]], and [[Woolly bear|woolly bear worm]]. 
 
 Worms may also be called [[helminth]]s, particularly in [[medical]] terminology when referring to [[parasitic worm]]s, especially the [[Nematoda]] (roundworms) and [[Cestoda]] (tapeworms).  " [[Helminthology]] "  is the study of parasitic worms. When a human or an animal, such as a [[dog]] or horse, is said to  " have worms " , it means that it is infested with [[parasitic worm]]s, typically [[nematode|roundworm]]s or [[tapeworm]]s. [[Deworming]]  kills off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving [[anthelmintic]] drugs. 
 
 " [[Ringworm]] "  is not a worm at all, but a skin fungus.
