 A '''vehicle''' is a machine to move people and things. A vehicle is not alive. A [[horse]] can move people and things, but it is an [[animal]], not a machine or a vehicle. 
 
 The word vehicle is borrowed from French and Latin. French ''véhicule'', going back to Middle French, borrowed from Medieval Latin ''vehiculum''  " medium, agent of transmission, "  going back to Latin,  " wheeled vehicle, means of transport, "  from ''vehere''  " to carry, convey. 
 
 ==Types of vehicles== 
 
 === Land vehicles === 
 Some vehicles move on land. Most land vehicles have [[wheel]]s. Examples of land vehicles are [[bicycle]]s, [[car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, and [[train]]s. 
 
 Land vehicles that are powered by an [[Engine|engine or motor]] are called motor vehicles. 
 
 Some land vehicles, like [[tank]]s and [[snowmobile]]s, have tracks. These tracks look and work like [[conveyor belt]]s. 
 
 === Water vehicles === 
 Some vehicles move on, or in, the water.  Examples are [[boat]]s, [[ship]]s, and [[submarine]]s. 
 
 === Air and space vehicles === 
 Vehicles that move in the sky are called [[aircraft]].  Examples are [[aeroplane]]s and [[balloon]]s. 
 
 Some vehicles, like the [[Space Shuttle]], can even leave the Earth's [[orbit]] and go to [[outer space]]. 
 
 == Power == 
 Vehicles can be [[Propulsion tools|propelled]] by various sources of energy. 
 
 * [[Human]] [[muscle]]s.  Examples are bicycles and [[skateboard]]s. 
 * [[Engine]]s.  Examples are automobiles, ships, and aeroplanes. 
 * [[Electricity]].  Examples are many passenger [[train]]s.  
 * [[Animal]]s.  Examples are [[cart]]s and [[chariot]]s. 
 * [[Wind]].  Examples are [[sailboat]]s and [[iceboat]]s. 
 
 Some vehicles have no propulsion power.  Examples are [[glider]]s, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]s and even [[Crane (machine)|fixed tower crane]]s.
