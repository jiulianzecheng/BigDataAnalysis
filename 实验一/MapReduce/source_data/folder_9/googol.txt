 A 9-year-old [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of U.S. mathematician [[Edward Kasner]], first used the word '''googol'''. Sirotta made this word in 1937, for the [[number]] represented by the [[numeral]] 1 followed by 100 zeros. < ref name= " Webster " > {{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/googol|accessdate=July 16, 2020|title=Googol}} < /ref > He may have been inspired by the comic strip  character Barney Google. 
 
 The company [[Google]] was named after the number  " googol. "   Its creators originally called it BackRub because it used backlinks to tell how important each page was. Someone suggested  " googolplex. "  They shortened it to  " googol "  and then spelled the word wrong when looking for a [[domain name]] that was not taken yet. < ref name= " BI " > {{cite web|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=July 16, 2020|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-true-story-behind-googles-first-name-backrub-2015-10|title=The true story behind Google's hilarious first name: BackRub|author=Nathan McAlone|date=October 5, 2015}} < /ref >
