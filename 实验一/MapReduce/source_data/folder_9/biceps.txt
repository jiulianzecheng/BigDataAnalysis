 The '''biceps''' brachii is a [[muscle]] in the arm. It has two parts, a long part and a short part.  Using the [[elbow]] the muscle helps the movement of the [[forearm]]. When the muscle shortens, it bends the elbow and twists the forearm so that the palm faces up. The two parts of the muscle start on different parts of the [[scapula|shoulder blade]] and end together on the forearm. < ref name= " Lippert " > {{cite book| last = Lippert | first = Lynn S.| title = Clinical kinesiology and anatomy | url = https://archive.org/details/clinicalkinesiol00lipp_357 | edition = 4th| publisher=F.

 The biceps is also a muscle in other [[quadruped|quadrupeds]]. In humans, the muscle is more complex, and allows more complex movement than in other quadrupeds.  
 
 The word biceps literally means two-headed, and refers to the fact that the muscle attaches to two different parts of the [[shoulder]]. In quadrupeds, the muscle only attaches at one point of the shoulder.
