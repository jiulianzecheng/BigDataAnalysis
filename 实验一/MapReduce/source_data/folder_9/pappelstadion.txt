 The '''Pappelstadion''' is a football stadium in the Austrian city of Mattersburg, [[Burgenland]]. It was the home ground of [[SV Mattersburg]] until the football club went bankrupt in 2020. It has a total capacity of 9,000 spectators.  The Mattersburg Sportverein 2020 now uses the football stadium. 
 ==History== 
 The Stadium was opened in 1952 as part of the club's 30th anniversary celebrations. The Austrian record champions [[SK Rapid Wien]] played the first match on the ground and won 9-3 versus SV Mattersburg. The multifunctional sports facility is embedded in a sports and leisure center. The numerous poplar trees that surround the area gave the stadium its name . It had also a cinder track.  
 
 At the beginning of the 21st century the stadium was modernized in several renovation phases. Under chairman Martin Pucher the running track was removed and the large main stand and floodlights were built in 2001. On the occasion of promotion to the Bundesliga in 2003, two more uncovered stands were built. The stadium capacity was now  17,100 seats. After the SV Mattersburg left professional football, the stadium was reduced in size.
