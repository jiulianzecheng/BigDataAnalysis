 == Four fields == 
 [[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the 7 known fossil teeth of ''Homo luzonensis'' found in Callao Cave, [[Philippines]].]] 
 Anthropology uses a  " [[four-field approach]] "  that [[Division|divides]] anthropology into four big kinds: 
 *[[Archaeology]] - The study of how people lived in the past. < ref name= " :2 "  / >   
 *[[Biological anthropology]] - The study of how people adapt to where they live and how bodies changed over time ([[evolution]]). < ref name= " :2 "  / >   
 *'''Linguistic anthropology''' - The study of how people [[Chat|speak]] and the words they use. < ref name= " :2 "  / >   
 *'''Sociocultural anthropology''' - The study of how people live their lives now and how they may have lived in the past. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  It combines [[Society|social]] and [[Culture|cultural]] ideas about people. 
 
 ===Archaeology=== 
 Archaeology is the study of humans from the past. People who study archaeology are called archaeologists. 
 
 Archaeologists look at things that past people left behind to know how they lived.  They look at [[tool]]s, [[bone]]s, and past [[house]]s to see how people in the past are not the same as people that live today. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Binford|first=Lewis R.|date=1962|title=Archaeology as Anthropology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/278380|journal=American Antiquity|volume=28|issue=2|pages=217–225|doi=10.2307/278380|jstor=278380|s2cid=162242910|issn=0002-7316}} < /ref > 
 
 Here are some other [[example]]s of what archaeologists like to study: 
 * [[Historical archaeology|'''Historical archaeology''':]] the study of what people wrote down and talked about in the past 
 * '''Ethnoarchaeology''': the study of people's things 
 * '''Experimental archaeology''': [[test]]s different ways to study archaeology 
 * '''Community archaeology''': makes sure that other people can help study anthropology 
 * '''Cultural resources management''': studies the past cultures and arts of humans 
 
 === Biological Anthropology === 
 Biological or [[physical anthropology]] studies human bodies and how they change over time. 
 
 They look at how humans live in nature and how their bodies change because of where they live. They also study how human beings and [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s are alike. Sometimes biological anthropologists study human and animal bones to learn about how past humans lived. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > Larsen, C. S. (Ed.). (2010). ''A companion to biological anthropology'' (Vol. 20). John Wiley  &  Sons. < /ref >  They are also called physical anthropologists. 
 
 Here are some other examples of what biological anthropologists like to study: 
 * [[Paleoanthropology]]: the study of human bones from a very long time ago  
 * '''Bioarchaeology''': the study of human bones from the past (but not as long ago as paleoanthropology) 
 * [[Primatology]]: the study of monkeys and apes  
 * '''Paleopathology''': the study of human diseases from the past 
 * [[Human biology]]: the study of how human bodies work 
 
 === Linguistic Anthropology === 
 [[Linguistics]] is the study of how people talk. 
 
 Linguistic anthropologists study sounds and how they go together to make words.  Then they study what the words mean and how people use them.  Linguistic anthropology also studies how [[language]] changes what people think and how people change language.  No two people talk the same way, so linguistic anthropologists want to know why that happens. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > Duranti, A. (Ed.). (2009). ''Linguistic anthropology: A reader'' (Vol. 1). John Wiley  &  Sons. < /ref > 
 
 Here are some other examples of what linguistic anthropologists like to study: 
 * [[Language]]s: how people talk in different places 
 * [[Communication]]: how people tell each other things 
 * '''Socialization''': how people learn languages when they are little 
 * '''Language ideology''': how people feel about language 
 * [[Code-switching]]: when someone uses more than one language 
 
 === Socio-Cultural Anthropology === 
 Socio-Cultural Anthropology is the study of human societies and cultures. 
 
 It looks at how human beings understand the world around them and how they act with the people around them. < ref > Ingold, Tim. 2005. Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology. New York: Routledge. < /ref >  Socio-cultural anthropologists study living people by going to their homes and learning about who those people are and what they do. They write about people in places all over the world to see why people are different. Some socio-cultural anthropologists study [[medicine]] in these places and some look at how babies grow up in other places. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > Garbarino, M. S. (1983). ''Sociocultural theory in anthropology: A short history''. Waveland Press. < /ref > 
 
 Here are some other examples of what socio-cultural anthropologists like to study: 
 * [[Witchcraft]]: the practice of magic 
 * [[Taboo]]: things that are not allowed 
 * [[Gender identity]]: what [[gender]] someone thinks they are 
 * '''Cultural materialism''': how people and [[Society|societies]] change 
 * [[Rites of passage]]: how people celebrate change, especially as someone gets older 
 
 === Other Kinds of Anthropology ===

 ==Rules of Anthropology== 
 Like everything in life, anthropology has a set of rules that every anthropologist needs to follow. The rules try to make sure that no one gets hurt or mad when studying other people. Here are some of the rules: < ref > [https://s3.amazonaws.com/rdcms-aaa/files/production/public/FileDownloads/pdfs/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/ethicscode.pdf American Anthropological Association. 1998. Code of Ethics] < /ref > 
 * To make sure no one gets hurt when studying anthropology 
 * To respect and be nice to humans and animals  
 * To make sure any items used to study people are well taken care of 
 * To work as a team
