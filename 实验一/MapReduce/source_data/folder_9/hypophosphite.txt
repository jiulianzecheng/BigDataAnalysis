 '''Hypophosphite''', also known as '''phosphonate''', is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is H < sub > 2 < /sub > PO < sub > 2 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > . It contains phosphorus in its +1 [[oxidation state]]. It is made by [[disproportionation]] of [[phosphorus]] in warm [[alkali]]. [[Phosphine]] is also produced. It is a strong [[reducing agent]]. [[Chemical compound]]s that contain the hypophosphite ions are called hypophosphites. They are poisonous. Hypophosphites are [[salt]]s of [[hypophosphorous acid]].
