A '''belt''' is a piece of [[clothing]] worn around a person's [[waist]]. They can be used to hold up [[trousers]](pants, men) or [[skirt]]s(women) or for carrying things in pockets, such as on a utility belt, which [[police]] use. Belts are commonly made using [[cloth]] or [[leather]]. They are worn by [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]], however men wear them more [[Casual attire|casually]] and [[Formal|formally]]. The most common colors are black and brown. Belts have buckles. Belts are thread around belt loops on trousers(usually [[Jeans]] and dress pants for men). Belts have holes which the buckle is put into., making them looser to tighter. [[Cowboy|Cowboys]] often wear belt and customize/pick their buckles.
