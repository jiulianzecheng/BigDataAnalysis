A '''documentary''' is a creative work of [[non-fiction]]. It documents (creates a record of) a true story.  A documentary may be a [[video]] or [[audio]] recording, such as a [[movie]] or [[radio]] program. 
 
 The purpose of a documentary is to tell the story behind the news. News programs tell what has happened, documentaries explain why and how something happened. Compare, for example, the difference between the result of an election (news) with an analysis of how and why that election was won and lost. Or, between the result of a sporting event and a discussion of how and why the result happened.
