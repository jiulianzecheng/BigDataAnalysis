 An '''aircraft''' is a [[flight|flying]] [[machine]].  
 
 The word ''aircraft'' originally meant airships and balloons. It comes from the words ''air'' and ''craft'',  a term from boating as were many early aviation words. 
 
 There are many different kinds of aircraft. 
 
 Some aircraft keep in the sky by moving air over their [[wing|wings]]. Examples are [[aeroplane|aeroplanes]], [[helicopter|helicopters]], and [[glider|gliders]]. Some aircraft keep in the sky by [[buoyancy|floating]].  Examples are [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and [[airship|airships]]. 
 
 Most aircraft use [[engine]] power. Examples are [[aeroplane]]s, [[helicopter]], and [[airship|airships]]. Gliders and balloons use no power.  A few aircraft use [[human powered aircraft|muscle power]]. 
 
 Big aeroplanes for transporting people are called ''[[airliner]]s''. Airliners are the quickest way to travel.  Airliners can fly over mountains and bad weather.  Airliners have complex technology to make them fly quickly, safely and for less money.  
 
 A few [[fighter aircraft]] can fly at 3,200 & nbsp;km/h (2,000 & nbsp;mph).  
 
 The person who drives an aircraft is called the [[pilot]].
