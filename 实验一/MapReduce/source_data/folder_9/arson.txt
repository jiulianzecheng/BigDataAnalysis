 '''Arson''' is a [[crime]]. When someone [[wikt:deliberate|deliberately]] sets [[fire]] to anything (such as a [[building]] or [[vehicle]]) they do not own and they want to cause damage, it is called arson. A person who commits arson is an '''arsonist'''. Arsonists usually use [[gasoline]] or [[kerosene]] to start a fire.  
 
 Arsonists use [[Match|matches]], [[Molotov cocktails]] and fire starters to start a fire. Arson is common in violent [[protests]] and retaliations against the government and other powers.   
 
 Arsonists deliberately burn things for benefits that they want. < ref name= " americanpsychiatrist " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RzFWRIAsPAC & pg=PA793|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry|author=Robert E.

 Julio Gonzalez became one of the most prolific arsonists in history when he set [[Happy Land fire|fire to the Happy Land nightclub]] with only 6 of the 93 occupants making it out alive. Julio started the fire after the bouncer kicked him out late in the evening due to him quarreling with his girlfriend Lydia Feliciano after she recently quit her job there. She was one of the 6 people to survive the fire. The club also came under fire due to the club having no fire escapes or sprinklers.
