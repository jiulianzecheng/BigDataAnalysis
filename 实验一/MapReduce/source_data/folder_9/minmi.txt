 '''''Minmi''''' is a [[genus]] of small [[ankylosauria]]n dinosaur that lived during the [[Lower Cretaceous]] of Australia, about 119 to 113 million years ago. 
 
 A recent [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]] suggests that ''Minmi'' is the most [[basal]] known [[ankylosaur]]. < ref name=ThompsonEtAl > {{Cite journal |author=Richard S.

 That does not mean it was the [[ancestor]] of the group; it is far too late for that. It means its body is not specialized, and is relatively unchanged from whatever was the ancestral group. 
 
 Two good specimens of ''Minmi'' have been described, including a mostly complete skeleton, and additional fragments may belong to this genus. The dinosaur grew to about 2 & nbsp;m (6.5 & nbsp;ft) long (Holtz), < ref name= " Holtz2008 " > Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. 2008.

 ==Paleobiology== 
 ''Minmi'' is classified in the [[Ankylosauria]], but is too 'primitive' (basal) to be included in either the [[Ankylosauridae]] or [[Nodosauridae]]. 
 
 As with other ankylosaurians, ''Minmi'' was [[herbivore|herbivorous]]  Unlike most herbivorous dinosaurs, there is direct evidence of the diet of ''Minmi'': gut contents are known from the well-preserved nearly complete specimen. The gut contents consist of fragments of fibrous or [[vascular tissue|vascular]] plant tissue, [[fruit]]ing bodies, spherical [[seed]]s, and tissue (possibly from [[fern]] [[sporangium|sporangia]]).  The most common remains are the fibrous or vascular fragments, which have clean cut ends. 
 
 Because of the small size of the fragments, they are probably nibbled from plants or chopped in the mouth. These small fragments may have come from twigs or stems, but their size is more suggestive of vascular bundles in leaves. The clean cuts, and lack of [[gastrolith]]s, < ref > stones in stomach for grinding food < /ref >  suggest that the animal relied on chewing to grind food. The seeds (0.3 & nbsp;mm [0.01 & nbsp;in] across) and fruiting bodies (4.5 & nbsp;mm [0.18 & nbsp;in] across) were apparently swallowed whole. When compared to gut contents and scat from modern herbivorous [[lizard]], [[emu]] and [[goose]], this shows ''Minmi'' had a more sophisticated process for cutting up plant material. < ref name=MC01 > {{Cite book |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |author2= Clifford, H.

 It had bony protrusions on its head, back, abdomen, legs and along the tail. Several types of armour are known in place in ''Minmi'', including small ossicles, small keeled [[scute]]s on the body, large scutes without keels on the snout, large keeled scutes on the neck, shoulders, and possibly tail, spike-like scutes on the hips, and a combination of ridged and keeled scutes and triangular plates on the tail. There was one preserved ring of scutes around the neck. The arrangement of armour is unclear on the tail, although the triangular plates may have run on the sides of the tail, with long scutes forming a row along the top of the tail. < ref name= " REM01 " > {{Cite book|title=The armored dinosaurs|url=https://archive.org/details/armoreddinosaurs0000unse_u1v7|last=Molnar|first=Ralph E.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-253-33964-2|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=[https://archive.org/details/armoreddinosaurs0000unse_u1v7/page/341 341]–362|chapter=Armor of the small ankylosaur ''Minmi''|authorlink=}} < /ref >   However, unlike other ankylosaurians, ''Minmi'' had horizontal plates of bones that ran along the sides of its [[vertebra]]e (hence its species name, ''M. paravertebra'').
