 '''Meteomont''' is the mountain [[Meteorology|meteorological]] service of the  [[Italy|Italian]] Army. The service helps with search and rescue. It also assesses the risk of [[avalanche]]s, gives early  warning of avalanches, and assesses mountain snow conditions in general. The service works together with the [[Carabinieri]] (the Italian Army law  enforcement service),  the meteorological and intelligence service of the Italian Air Force, and the [[Alpini]]. The Alpini are the elite mountain troops of the Italian Army. < ref name =  " fab " > {{cite book| last1 = Cristalli| first1 = Fabrizio| last2 = Rossio| first2 = Flavio L.| title = Polizia locale 2.0.
