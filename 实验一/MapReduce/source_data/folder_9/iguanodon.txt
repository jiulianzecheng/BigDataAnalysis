 '''''Iguanodon''''' is a [[genus]] of [[ornithopod]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] period in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. It lived 125/126 [[million]] [[years]] ago (mya). < ref > Norman, David B. 2004.  " Basal Iguanodontia " . In Weishampel D.B., Dodson P., and Osmólska H.

 Discovered in 1822 and described three years later by [[England|English]] [[geologist]] [[Gideon Mantell]], ''Iguanodon'' was the second dinosaur formally named, after ''[[Megalosaurus]]''. Together with ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', it was one of the three genera originally used to define the [[Dinosaur]]ia. 
 
 A large, bulky [[herbivore]], ''Iguanodon'' is thought by some to be in the same family as the duck-billed [[hadrosaurid|hadrosaur]]s. The [[taxonomy]] of the genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera. 
 
 Scientific understanding of ''Iguanodon'' has evolved over time. New information is got from the [[fossil]]s. Researchers have made suggestions about  the living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour.  As one of the first scientifically known dinosaurs, ''Iguanodon'' is well known. < ref > Norman, David B.; Weishampel, David B. 1990.  " Iguanodontidae and related ornithopods " .

 == Species == 
 There are at least two species recognised: 
 *''I. bernissartensis'', described by [[George Albert Boulenger]] in 1881, is the [[type species]] for the genus. This species is best known for the many skeletons discovered in a [[coal]] mine in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]] in 1878. The coal dates to the earliest [[Cretaceous]] period. < ref name=GSP > Paul, Gregory S. 2008. A revised taxonomy of the iguanodont dinosaur genera and species. ''Cretaceous Research'' '''29''' (2): 192–216. < /ref >  36 adult skeletons were excavated at this site, a coal mine. This is by far the largest find of this species. The species is large and strong. 
 *''I. galvensis'', described in 2015, is based on adult and juvenile remains found in deposits in [[Teruel]], Spain, dating to about 126 mya. < ref > Francisco J. Verdú ''et al'' 2015. Perinates of a new species of Iguanodon (Ornithischia: Ornithopoda) from the lower Barremian of Galve (Teruel, Spain).

 == Posture and movement == 
 Because its front limbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, Mantell guessed it could move on two legs, as opposed to [[Richard Owen|Owen]], who thought it was [[quadruped]]al. As it happens, it probably used both modes. Slow walking would be done on all fours, and faster running on the hind legs. Either way, the position of the body would be more horizontal than upright, with the tail held above the ground by its [[ossified]] (bony) [[ligament]]s (they can be clearly seen on the skeleton). It would defend itself against predators on its hind legs, using its strong front arms and dagger-like thumbs as weapons. 
 
 == Eating == 
 The teeth were close-set grinding teeth suitable for a [[browser]]. it is believed that, as with most other [[ornithischia]]ns, ''Iguanodon'' had some sort of [[cheek]]-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to keep food in the mouth. < ref name=PMG73 > {{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M.|year=1973 |title=The cheeks of ornithischian dinosaurs |journal=Lethaia |volume=6 |pages=67–89 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1973.tb00873.x |issue=1}} < /ref > < ref name=FS04 > Fastovsky D.E. and Smith J.B. 2003.
