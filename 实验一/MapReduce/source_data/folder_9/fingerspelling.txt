 '''Fingerspelling''' is making an [[alphabet]] with your hands. Many [[deaf]] people learn fingerspelling. They use it when they want to sign a word but there is no sign in the [[sign language]], or when they don't understand what the sign means. Other people also use fingerspelling to talk in [[secret]], to help remember something, or to talk without making [[sound]] (for example in a [[church]]). 
 
 Fingerspelling is a part of some [[sign language]]s. [[Writing system]]s are not the same everywhere, and fingerspelling is also different. Different countries have different ways of fingerspelling. Some alphabets use one hand, some use two hands.
