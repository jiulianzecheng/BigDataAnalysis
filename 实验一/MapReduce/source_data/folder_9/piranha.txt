 The '''piranha''' (also known as the '''caribe''' or '''piraña''') is a ferocious, [[schooling]], fresh-water [[fish]].  
 
 It is native to warm lowland streams and lakes in [[South America]], east of the [[Andes]] Mountains. Piranhas have been introduced to other places, including Northern [[Brazil]], [[Hawaii]], and parts of Central and [[North America]]. There are many species of piranha they belong to the genera ''Pygocentrus'' and ''Serrasalmus''. They reproduce by laying eggs. 
 
 == Diet == 
 Piranhas are opportunistic carnivores (flesh-eaters). They eat aquatic and land animals that are in the water. Some of the prey includes fish, [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[carrion]] (dead meat that they find). These fish are diurnal (most active during the day). 
 
 == Predators == 
 Many animals prey upon piranhas (especially young piranhas), including other piranhas, [[caiman]]s, water [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, birds, [[otter]]s, and [[people]].
