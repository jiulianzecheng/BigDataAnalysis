'''Shearography''' is a method used to [[test]] if something is broken on the inside, where people cannot see. Things that can be tested with shearography are [[airplane]] [[wing]]s, [[wind turbine]] generator blades, [[boat]]s, and other structures. A special [[camera]] is used to take a picture of something that might be broken inside. After this picture is taken, the structure is pushed a little bit so that it bends slightly. While it is bent, another photo is taken with the special camera in the same location. The special camera uses computer [[software]] to compare the two pictures. If the software sees any damage, it will display the damage on a [[computer monitor]] so people can see it.
