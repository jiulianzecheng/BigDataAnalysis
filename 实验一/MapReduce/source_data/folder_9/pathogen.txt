 A '''pathogen''' is an [[Infection|infectious]] thing, such as a [[virus]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]] or [[parasite]], which causes a [[disease]]. This ability is called '''pathogenicity'''. 
 
 The body has many ways to defend against some of the common pathogens (such as ''[[Pneumocystis]]'') in the form of the human [[immune system]] and by some  " helpful "  [[bacteria]] present in the human body's normal human [[flora]]. However, if the [[immune system]] or  " good "  bacteria is damaged in any way (for example, [[chemotherapy]], [[HIV]], or [[antibiotic]]s being taken to kill other pathogens), pathogenic [[bacteria]] that were being held back can grow and cause harm to the host. Such cases are opportunistic infections. 
 
 Some pathogens cause [[epidemic]]s. These include the bacterium ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' which may have caused the [[Black Death]], the ''[[Variola]]'' virus, and the [[malaria]]l protozoa. They hurt or even kill large numbers of people.  
 
 The most famous and lethal outbreak was the [[1918]] [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] (type A influenza, [[H1N1]] subtype), which lasted from 1918 to 1919. It is not known exactly how many it killed, but estimates range from 20 to 100 million people. < ref name=Knobler > {{cite book |editor=Knobler S, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon S |title=The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

 The huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50% and the extreme severity of the symptoms. One observer wrote,  " One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from [[mucous membrane]]s, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. Bleeding from the ears and skin also occurred " . < ref name=Knobler/ >  The majority of deaths were from bacterial [[pneumonia]], a [[secondary infection]] caused by influenza, but the virus also killed people directly, causing massive bleeding and [[oedema]] in the lungs. < ref name=Taubenberger > {{cite journal |title=Integrating historical, clinical and molecular genetic data in order to explain the origin and virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=356 |issue=1416 |pages=1829–39 |date=December 29, 2001 |pmid=11779381 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.1020 |pmc=1088558|last1=Taubenberger |first1=Jeffery K. |last2=Reid |first2=Ann H. |last3=Janczewski |first3=Thomas A. |last4=Fanning |first4=Thomas G. }} < /ref > 
 
 In plants, fungi are the main cause of infectious disease.
