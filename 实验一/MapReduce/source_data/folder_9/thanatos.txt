 '''Thanatos''' is the [[Death (personification)|god of death]] in [[Greek mythology]].  He is the son of [[Nyx]] and the twin brother of [[Hypnos]], the god of [[sleep]].  
 
 [[Sigmund Freud]], a famous [[psychology|psychologist]], used the word in one of his [[theory|theories]]. THANATOS was the god or personified spirit (''[[daimon]]'') of non-violent death. His touch was gentle, likened to that of his twin brother Hypnos(Sleep). Violent death was the domain of Thanatos' blood-craving sisters, the Keres, spirits of slaughter and disease. He is often confused with [[Hades]], who is the god of the dead and underworld, not death itself. 
 
 Thanatos plays a prominent role in two myths. Once when he was sent to fetch Alkestis (Alcestis) to the underworld, he was driven off by Herakles in a fight. Another time he was captured by the criminal Sisyphos ([[Sisyphus]]) who trapped him in a sack so as to avoid death.
