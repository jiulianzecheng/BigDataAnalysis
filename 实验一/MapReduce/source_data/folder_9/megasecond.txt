A '''megasecond''' is one million [[second]]s.  This page lists times between '''10 < sup > 6 < /sup >  seconds''' and 10 < sup > 9 < /sup >  seconds, which is about 11.6 [[day]]s and 0.0317 years. 
 
 One megasecond contains 1000 kiloseconds. There are 1000 megaseconds in one gigasecond. 
 
 Ten megaseconds is equal to 115.74 days. 100 megaseconds is equal to 3.2 years.
