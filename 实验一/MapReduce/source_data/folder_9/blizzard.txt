A '''blizzard''' is a severe [[snowstorm]]. It brings low [[temperature]]s, strong [[wind]]s, and a lot of blowing [[snow]]. Blizzards start when a [[high pressure area|high pressure system]] touches a [[low pressure area|low pressure system]]. The word ''blizzard'' is sometimes used incorrectly by [[news|news media]] to talk about big winter storms, even if the storm is not a blizzard. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Some areas are more likely to be hit by blizzards than others, but a blizzard can occur in any place where snow falls. In [[North America]], blizzards happen often in the northern-east [[United States of America|states]], and in the provinces of [[Canada]]. In this region, blizzards can happen more than twice each [[winter]]. They also occur often in the mountain ranges of western North America. Because these regions have low [[populations]], blizzards sometimes are not reported. 
 
 ===Whiteouts=== 
 A very dangerous type of blizzard is a [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]]. In a whiteout, [[downdraft]]s and snowfall are so thick that  people cannot tell the ground and sky apart. People caught in a whiteout lose their sense of direction very fast. This is a large danger to [[pilot]]s when they are flying [[airplane]]s, because they cannot tell how close they are to the ground, and may crash. 
 
 ==== Who cleans up after blizzards? ==== 
 The community cleans up after a snowstorm/blizzard occurs. Blizzards only usually go for 3 hours so everything won't be too damaged, meaning it won't be as hard as an [[earthquake]] or [[tsunami]] to clean. 
 
 === How deep the snow gets === 
 These horrible blizzards can achieve up to {{convert|25|ft}}-{{convert|30|ft}} deep. A basketball hoop is {{convert|10|ft}} high, so a blizzard can get snow as deep as the height of two or three hoops. 
 
 == How do blizzards occur? == 
 Firstly you need cold enough [[air]] to cause snow to fall in the clouds and ground level water and [[moisture]] is needed to form [[cloud]]s and [[precipitation]]. The moisture is called [[water vapour]] to make the clouds a source of water vapour is cold air blowing across large lakes or the sea but the cold air doesn't actually make too much snow, its a combination of cold and warm air that does it. The warm air normally meets the cold air if the wind is being pulled towards the [[equator]] when they are brought together a front is formed and precipitation is formed and the warm air can go up to the clouds and the blizzard forms from there.  
 
 === How strong are a blizzard's winds? === 
 There is sustained wind or frequent gusts of {{convert|35|miles}} per hour or greater. 
 
 === How cold can blizzards get? === 
 Blizzards can get down to {{convert|-12|°F|°C|1}} or lower. This makes it fairly easy to get [[hypothermia]] in a blizzard. Mostly freezing [[electric]]s and [[machinery]], make life very hard in these very cold temperatures. 
 
 == Famous U.S. blizzards == 
 [[Image:Train stuck in snow.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Blizzards that appear quickly cause a lot of damage. They can bury [[car]]s, [[truck]]s, and even a [[locomotive]] under snow.]]The [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] was very damaging for the Northeastern [[United States]]. In that blizzard, 400 people died, 200 [[ship]]s sunk, and [[snowdrift]]s were {{convert|10|ft}} or {{convert|15|ft}} high. In the [[Great Plains]], states were hit by the [[Schoolhouse Blizzard]] that trapped children in schools and killed 235 people.  
 
 In 1880–1881 there was a winter that people in the [[Dakotas]] called the  " Hard Winter " . The author [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] wrote her book ''The Long Winter'' about that winter's story. It talks about one blizzard after another, and how it changed Laura's family and everybody around her. The book is almost all true. Her story of two men from the town of [[DeSmet]], [[South Dakota]], going after some [[wheat]] stored some miles south of DeSmet in February 1881 is true, and Ingalls later married one of the men, [[Almanzo Wilder]]. If the two men had not found and brought back the [[wheat]], the people would have [[starve]]d. The snow and [[ice]] [[thaw|thawed]] in April, and the railroads could start again. The train picture above was [[photography|photographed]] on March 29, 1881, not far from DeSmet. 
 
 34 people died during a 3-day spring blizzard on March 1920 in [[North Dakota]]. One of the people who died was [[Hazel Miner]], a teenage girl who [[hypothermia|froze to death]] when she got lost on her way home from her [[one-room-school]]. 
 
 The [[Armistice Day Blizzard]] in 1940 surprised many people with how fast the temperature dropped. It was {{convert|60|°F|°C|1}} in the morning, but by noon, it was snowing. Some of the people froze to death in the snow. 154 people died in the Armistice Day Blizzard.  
 
 105 years after the Great Blizzard of 1888, a giant blizzard, named the [[1993 North American Storm Complex|Storm of the Century]], hit the U.S in 1993. It dropped snow on 26 states and reached as far north as [[Canada]] and as far south as [[Mexico]]. In many [[Southern United States|southern U.S.]] areas, such as parts of [[Alabama]], more snow fell in this storm than ever fell in an entire winter. Highways and airports closed across the U.S. The blizzard also made 15 [[tornado]]es in [[Florida]]. When the storm was over, 270 people died and 48 were reported missing.
