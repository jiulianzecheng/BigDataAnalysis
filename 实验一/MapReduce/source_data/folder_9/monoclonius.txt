 [[File:Annual report of the American Museum of Natural History for the year (1916) (17810089074).jpg|thumb|The  " ''Monoclonius nasicornus'' "  skeleton (material now more usually classified in ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' or ''[[Styracosaurus]]'').]] 
 
 '''''Monoclonius''''' is the doubtful name of a [[Ceratopsia|ceratopsid]] [[dinosaur]]. It was a herbivore (plant-eater)  It lived in [[North America]] during the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 76 to 73 million years ago. 
 
 ''Monoclonius'' was named by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] in 1876, soon after the first fossil specimen had been found in [[Montana]]. The specimen was a near complete skeleton with only the feet missing. It included skull material and the base of the nasal horn. Its name means  " single stem "  and refers to its teeth, which have a single root. 
 
 ''Monoclonius'' is now regarded as a ''[[nominem dubium]]''. It seems to be a juvenile stage of ''[[Centrosaurus]]''. < ref name=ryan2006 > {{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = M.J. | year = 2006 | title = The status of the problematic taxon ''Monoclonius'' (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) and the recognition of adult-sized dinosaur taxa | url = https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006NC/finalprogram/abstract_102994.htm | journal = Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs | volume = 38 | issue = 4| page = 62 }} < /ref >
