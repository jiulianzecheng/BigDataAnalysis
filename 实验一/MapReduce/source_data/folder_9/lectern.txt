 A '''lectern''' (from the [[Latin]] ''lectus'', [[past participle]] of ''legere'',  " to read " ) is a [[read]]ing [[desk]] with a [[wikt:slant|slanted]] top. It is usually placed on a stand  some other form of support. [[Document]]s or [[book]]s are often put on top of a lectern to make it easier for someone to read them to other people. For example, for [[Scripture]] reading, [[lecture]]s, [[speech]]s or [[sermon]]s. The [[height]] and slant of a lectern can usually be changed to so the person reading can stand properly and make good [[eye]]-contact with an [[audience]].
