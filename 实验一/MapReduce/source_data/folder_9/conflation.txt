 '''Conflation''' is what happens when two or more individuals, concepts, or places seem to be a single identity.  Although they may share one or more characteristics, the differences somehow seem to be lost. < ref > Haught, John F. (1995).

 In [[logic]], conflation is the practice of treating two distinct [[concept]]s as if they were one.  This produces errors or misunderstandings.  The fusion or merge of distinct subjects tends to obscure analysis of relationships which are emphasized by contrasts. < ref > Haught, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC & dq=conflation & pg=PA14 ''Science and Religion: From Conflict to Conversation''], p. 14. < /ref >
