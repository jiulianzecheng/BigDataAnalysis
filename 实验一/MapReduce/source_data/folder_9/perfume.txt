 '''Perfume''' is a [[liquid]] that gives [[wikt:people|people]], things and rooms a good smell. It is made of [[oil]]s which give off [[scent]] to the surrounding air. < ref > [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfume Merriam-webster.com] < /ref >  The odoriferous compounds that make up a perfume can be manufactured synthetically or extracted from plant or animal sources. 
 
 Perfumes were used in the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial [[synthesis]] of aroma compounds such as [[vanillin]] or [[coumarin]]. The [[Chemical compound|artificial compounds]] gave a wider ranger of scents than natural materials. 
 
 Perfume smells more when [[temperature]] is warmer. So people put it on the [[neck]], [[wrist]] and back of the [[knee]], because these parts are warmer. [[Eau de Cologne]] is a type of perfume which can be splashed on the body. It is not so concentrated as the usual perfumes. 
 
 == Sources == 
 === Plants === 
 Today, most common essential oils, such as [[lavender]], [[peppermint]], and [[eucalyptus]], are [[Distillation|distilled]]. Raw plant material, the [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], [[wood]], [[bark]], [[root]]s, [[seed]]s, or [[peel]], is put into a  distillation apparatus over water.  As the water is heated, the steam passes through the plant material collecting the scents. The steam flow through a coil, where it is condensing back to liquid, which is then collected. 
 
 Most [[citrus]] peel oils are cold pressed, like [[olive oil]] production. Citrus-fruit oils are cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange oils got as [[by-product]]s of the [[citrus]] industry are even cheaper. 
 
 ===Animal sources===

 *'''[[Ambergris]]''': lumps of  fatty compounds, secreted and expelled by the [[sperm whale]]. Because the harvesting of ambergris causes no harm to the whales, collecting it is not controversial. 
 *'''[[Castoreum]]''': from the scent glands of the North American [[beaver]]. 
 *'''[[Civet]] musk''': from the odorous sacs of civets, which are animals in the family [[Viverridae]], related to the [[mongoose]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.profumo.it/internet-documents/zibetto/suffering.htm |title=Zibetto, civet, civette, profumi animali, aromaterapia, feromoni, pheromons, animal, scents, perfumes, parfums animaux. |access-date=2012-10-29 |archive-date=2012-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015051904/http://profumo.it/internet-documents/zibetto/suffering.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 *'''[[Honeycomb]]''': from the honeycomb of the [[honeybee]].  
 *'''[[Deer]] musk''': from the musk sacs from the Asian [[musk deer]]. 
 
 ===Other natural sources=== 
 * '''[[Lichen]]'''. Commonly used lichens include [[oakmoss]] and [[treemoss]] thalli. 
 * '''[[Brown algae|Seaweed]]'''. Distillates are sometimes used as [[essential oil]] in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is ''[[Fucus]] vesiculosus'', the [[bladder wrack]]. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics. 
 
 ===Synthetic sources=== 
 Many modern perfumes contain [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, [[Calone]], a compound of synthetic origin, gives a fresh metallic marine scent that is widely used. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate to compounds that are not easily got from natural sources.

 The word perfume used today derives from the Latin ''per fumum'', meaning  " through smoke. "  Perfumery, or the art of making perfumes, began in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Persia]]ns. 
 
 The world's first recorded chemist is considered to be a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker who was mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia. < ref > {{cite book|author=Strathern, Paul |title=Mendeleyev's dream {{ndash}} the quest for the elements|location=New York | publisher=Berkley Books|year=2000|isbn=0-425-18467-6}} < /ref >  She distilled flowers, oil, and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] with other aromatics then filtered and put them back in the still several times. < ref > {{cite book|last=Levey|first=Martin|title=Early Arabic pharmacology: an introduction based on ancient and medieval sources|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1973|pages=9|isbn=90-04-03796-9}} < /ref >

The perfumes date back more than 4,000 years. The perfumes were discovered in an ancient perfumery. At least 60 stills, mixing bowls, funnels and perfume bottles were found in the {{convert|43000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} factory. < ref > [http://www.perfumerflavorist.com/news/6663832.html 4,000-Year-Old perfumes found] < /ref >  In [[Ancient history|ancient]] times people used [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, like [[almond]], [[coriander]], [[Myrtus communis|myrtle]], [[conifer|conifer resin]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], as well as [[flowers]]. < ref > [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,261631,00.html?sPage=fnc.science/archaeology Fox News: Ancient perfumes recreated, put on display in Rome] < /ref > 
 
 The [[Arabian]] alchemist, [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils and medical substances. < ref > al-Hassani, Woodcok and Saoud 2006. ''1001 Invention: Muslim heritage in our world''. FSTC p22. < /ref > 
 
 The [[Persian people|Persian]] chemist [[Avicenna]] introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the [[rose]]. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong scent. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular.  
 
 The art of perfumery was known in western [[Europe]] since the 13th or 14th centuries. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were grown in [[France]], [[Sicily]], and Italy.
