:''For the opposite of Denotation see [[Connotation]].'' 
 {{wiktionary|denote}} 
 *In [[logic]], [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], a '''denotation''' of a [[word]] or [[phrase]] is a part of its meaning.  
 
 ==Examples== 
 In order to understand fully the difference between denotation and [[connotation]] in the [[media studies]] and semiotics uses it is necessary to become familiar with some examples: 
 {| 
 |-  
 | [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|100px|left|Example one.]]  
 The denotation of this example is a red [[rose]] with a green [[Plant stem|stem]]. The connotation is that it is a '''symbol''' of passion and love - this is what the rose represents. 
 |- 
 | [[Image:Cartoony cross.svg|100px|left|Example two.]] 
 The denotation is a brown cross. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of [[religion]], according to the media connotation. However, to be more specific this is a '''symbol''' of Christianity. 
 |- 
 | [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven 
 .]] 
 The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection, not in the way of a rose, but a symbol of true love.

 == Different aspects of meaning == 
 
 Several parts of meaning may be called denotation. That depends on the contrast being drawn. 
 ** ''[[Connotation and denotation]]'' are either 
 ***in basic [[semantics]] and [[literary theory]], the ''figurative'' and ''literal'' meanings of a word, or 
 ***in philosophy, logic and parts of linguistics, the [[intension]] and [[extension]] of a word 
 ** ''Denotation'' can be synonymous with '''reference''' in the [[sense and reference]] in philosophy of language. 
 
 * In [[Computer science]], [[denotational semantics]] is contrasted with [[operational semantics]]. 
 
 * In [[Semiotics]], [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotation]] also has its own meaning. 
 
 *In [[mass media|media]]-studies terminology, '''denotation''' is the first level of analysis: what the audience can visually see on a page. Denotation often refers to something literal, and avoids being a [[metaphor]]. Here it is usually coupled with [[connotation]] which is the second level of analysis, being what the denotation represents 
 
 In logic and semantics, denotational always attracts the [[Extension_(semantics)|extension]] meaning  " in the pair " , but the other element genuinely varies. See [[intension]] for some more discussion. 
 
 A denotation is the strict, literal, dictionary definition of a word, devoid of any emotion, attitude, or colour.  
 
 Denotation often links with [[symbolism]], as the denotation of a particular media text often represents something further; a hidden meaning (or an Engima Code) is often encoded into a media text (such as the images below).
