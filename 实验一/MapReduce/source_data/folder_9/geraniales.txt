 The '''Geraniales''' are a small order of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[rosid]] subgroup of [[dicotyledon]]s.  
 
 * [[Geraniaceae]]: The largest family in the order, with over 800 species. 
 *''[[Pelargonium]]'': a [[genus]] previously included in ''[[Geranium]]'', and still often called geraniums. 
 
 In addition, the order includes some small families, with altogether less than 40 [[species]]. Most Geraniales are [[herbaceous]], but there are also shrubs and small trees.
