 A '''chassis''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|tʃ|æ|s|i}}, < ref > {{Cite web|last=Company|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: chassis|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chassis|access-date=21 May 2017|website=ahdictionary.com}} < /ref >  {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ʃ|æ|s|i}}; < ref > {{Cite web|title=Chassis definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/chassis|access-date=21 May 2017|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en}} < /ref >  plural ''chassis'' {{IPAc-en|-|i|z}} from French '''''châssis''''' {{IPA-fr|ʃɑsi|}}) ([[plural]] chassis) consists of a framework that supports an inanimate (non-[[life|living]]) object. This is much like an [[animal]]'s [[skeleton]], for example in a [[car]]. 
 
 == Examples of use == 
 In a [[car]], the term chassis means the [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] (the [[metal]]  " skeleton " ) plus the [[engine]], [[transmission]] (gear shift), [[driveshaft]], [[differential]] (gears which keep the back wheels moving correctly), and [[suspension]] (springs which keep the car above the ground). A [[body]], which is usually not necessary to keep the car together, is built on top of the chassis to complete the car. 
 
 *A [[tank]] (war machine)'s chassis (hull) comprises the bottom part of the tank, which includes the [[tracks]], power plant, driver's seat, and crew compartment. 
 
 *A chassis in a [[television]], [[radio]], or other [[electricity|electronic]] device consists of the [[metal]] frame on which the [[circuit board]]s and other electronics are mounted. Sometimes the chassis refers to the parts themselves. 
 
 *In [[computer]]s, the chassis refers to the rigid framework onto which the [[motherboard]], [[computer storage|memory]], [[disk drives]], and other equipment are mounted. It also supports the shell-like ''case'': the housing that protects all of the vital internal equipment from dust, moisture, and tampering. The term  " [[case modding]] "  refers to the artistic styling of otherwise rather functional and plain computer encasings. Main article: [[computer case]] for personal machines or [[19-inch rack|rack mount]] for commercial grade servers.
