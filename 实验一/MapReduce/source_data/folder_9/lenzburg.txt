 [[File:Lenzburg schloss.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Castle Lenzburg as seen from the south]] 
 In the [[5th century|5th]] and [[6th century|6th centuries]], an [[Alamanni]] village existed. The oldest registered usage of the name ''Lencis'' (from which Lenzburg derives) is from 893.{{cn}} In 1036, [[Schloss Lenzburg|Castle Lenzburg]] became the seat for the [[count]] of Lenzburg, then an important [[lord]]. The family died out in 1173, and the [[castle]] was then owned by [[emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]]. < ref name=al/ >  After this, it was mainly used by the Kyburger house. The [[Habsburg]]s took over the castle in 1273. 
 
 City rights were granted in 1306.{{cn}} Lenzburg was conquered by [[Bern]] in 1415, along with the western part of what is now [[Aargau]]. Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the area from 1444 to 1798. A major [[fire]] ruined the town in 1491.{{cn}} Only fifteen houses were not [[wikt:destroy|destroyed]].{{cn}} The [[reformation]] was carried out at the same time with the rest of the [[region]] in 1528. The [[economy]] started to move slowly from a [[farm]]ing economy to a more [[Industry|industrial]] one in the [[16th century]]. A [[textile]] [[factory]] was founded in 1732.{{cn}} 
 
 In 1798, the [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetian Republic]] was made and the lords from [[Bern]] were removed. The canton of [[Aargau]] was founded and Lenzburg became the capital of the district in 1803. The canton gained the castle in 1804. Lenzburg became the economic center of the area in the [[19th century]]. In 1875, Lenzburg was added to the [[railway]] system.{{cn}} [[Competition]] for trade became too much and Lenzburg became [[bankrupt]] only one year later.{{cn}} The town recovered from bankruptcy during the next 10 years. 
 
 In 1886, the German playwright, [[Frank Wedekind]] lived in the castle which his father had bought. < ref name=al/ >  It was sold in 1892 to August Edward Jessup from [[Philadelphia]] who spent a lot of money restoring the castle. < ref name=al/ >  He sold it to a [[Chicago]] banker, James W. Ellsworth in 1911. Ellsworth's son, [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and [[Roald Amundsen]] used the castle to plan their polar explorations in the 1920s. < ref name=al/ >
