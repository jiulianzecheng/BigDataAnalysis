 '''Snakes''' are [[reptile]]s. They are part of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Squamata]]. They are [[carnivore]]s, with long narrow bodies and no [[legs]]. There are at least 20 [[Family (biology)|families]], about 500 [[genera]] and 3,400 [[species]] of snake. < ref name= " ITIS " > {{ITIS |id=174118 |taxon=Serpentes |accessdate=3 December 2008}} < /ref > < ref name= " NRDB-Cs " > [http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/search.php?taxon=snake & submit=Search snake species list] at the [http://reptile-database.org/ Reptile Database].

 Their long, slender body has some special features. < ref name= " BOE " > {{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550283/snake|title=snake (reptile) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia|encyclopedia=britannica.com|accessdate=4 May 2010}} < /ref >  They have overlapping [[scale (zoology)|scales]] which protect them, and help them move and climb trees. The scales have colours which may be [[camouflage]] or [[warning colouration|warning colours]]. 
 
 Many species have [[skull]]s with more joints than the skulls of their [[lizard]] ancestors. This allows the snakes to swallow [[prey]] much larger than their heads. In their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as [[kidneys]]) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side. Most have only one working [[lung]]. Some species have kept a [[pelvic girdle]] with a pair of [[vestigial]] claws on either side of the [[cloaca]]. They have no eyelids or external ears. They can [[hiss]], but otherwise make no vocal sounds. 
 
 They are very mobile in their own way. Most of them live in the [[tropics]]. Few snake species live beyond the [[Tropic of Cancer]] or [[Tropic of Capricorn]], and only one species, the common [[viper]] (''Vipera berus'') lives beyond the [[Arctic Circle]]. < ref name= " BOE " / >  They can see well enough, and they can taste scents with their tongues by flicking them in and out. They are very sensitive to vibrations in the ground. Some snakes can sense [[warm-blooded]] animals by thermal [[infrared]]. 
 
 Most snakes live on the ground, and in the trees. Others live in the water, and a few live under the [[soil]]. Like other reptiles, snakes are [[ectotherm]]s. They control their body temperature by moving in and out of the direct sunshine. That is why they are rare in cold places. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.antiguanracer.org/html/racer/snakef.htm|title=Snake facts|work=antiguanracer.org|accessdate=4 May 2010|archive-date=6 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106090629/http://www.antiguanracer.org/html/racer/snakef.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 == Evolution == 
 Snakes are thought to have evolved from [[lizards]]. The earliest snake fossils are from the [[Lower Cretaceous]]. < ref name= " timetree " > Vidal N. ''et al'' 2009. Snakes (Serpentes). In Hedges S.B. and Kumar S. (eds) ''The timetree of life''. Oxford University Press, 390-397. < /ref >  A wide range of snakes appeared during the [[Paleocene]] period (''c'' 66 to 56 million years ago). 
 
 === Not a clade === 
 The [[Squamata]] are definitely a [[monophyletic]] group: it is a sister group to the [[Tuatara]]. Judged by their fossil record, the squamates were present in the [[Mesozoic]], but had a minor place in the land ecology. Three of the six lines are recorded first in the Upper [[Jurassic]], the others in the [[Cretaceous]]. Probably all, certainly the lizards, arose earlier in the Jurassic. < ref name= " Benton " > Benton, Michael 1997. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. Chapman  &  Hall, London, 238. < /ref >  The [[Mosasaur]]s of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] were by far the most successful of all the lizards, becoming the top predator in their [[ecosystem]]. 
 
 Although snakes and lizards look very different, ''neither is a proper [[clades|clade]]''. Snakes did descend from early lizards, not once, but many different times. 
 
 There is a [[monophyletic]] clade within the Squamata. It is the [[Toxicofera]]. It includes all [[venom]]ous snakes and lizards, and many related non-venomous species. The evidence for this is in recent [[sequence analysis|molecular analyses]]. < ref name= " Fry2006 " >

 === Fossil snakes === 
 The fossil of a primitive snake from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] has been found. It lived about 113 million years ago. < ref > Martil D.M; Tischlinger H  &  Longrich N. 2015. A four-legged snake from the early Cretaceous of Gondwana. ''Science'' '''349''' (6246) 416–419. [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6246/416.abstract A four-legged snake from the early Cretaceous of Gondwana  & #124; Science] < /ref >  It had rather small front and rear legs. Several other fossil snakes have been found with small rear legs, but this is the first one with all four legs. The snake, ''Tetrapodophis amplectus'', lived on land and was [[adapted]] to burrowing. The researcher said there were  " a lot of very advanced snake features, including its hooked teeth, flexible jaw and spine – and even snake-like scales. And there's the gut contents – it's swallowed another vertebrate. It was preying on other animals, which is a snake feature " . < ref > Webb, Jonathan 2015. Four-legged snake ancestor 'dug burrows'. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33621491 Four-legged snake ancestor 'dug burrows' - BBC News] < /ref >  The snake came from the [[Crato Formation]] in [[Brazil]], and lay in a private collection for many years. It was re-discovered in a museum at [[Solnhofen]], [[Bavaria]]. 
 
 == Venom == 
 Most snakes are nonvenomous. Those that have [[venom]] use it mainly to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some have venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by squeezing. 
 
 Two [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[family (biology)|families]] are entirely venomous: 
 * '''[[Elapid]]s''' – [[cobra]]s including [[king cobra]]s, [[Bungarus|kraits]], [[mamba]]s, [[Austrelaps|Australian copperheads]], [[sea snake]]s, and [[coral snake]]s. < ref name= " Freiberg84_126 " / > 
 * '''[[Viperidae|Viperids]]''' – [[Viperidae|vipers]], [[rattlesnake]]s, [[Copperhead snake|copperheads]]/[[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouths]], and [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmasters]]. < ref name= " Freiberg84_126 " / > 
 
 A third family with the  " rear-fanged "  snakes (and most of the other snake species) is the 
 * '''[[Colubrid]]s''' – [[boomslang]]s, tree snakes, [[Ahaetulla|vine snakes]], [[boiga|mangrove snakes]], but not all colubrids are venomous. < ref name= " Freiberg84_126 " > {{cite book| last1 = Freiberg| first1 = Marcos A.| last2 = Walls| first2 = Jerry G.| title = The World of Venomous Animals| url = https://archive.org/details/worldofvenomousa00marc| year = 1984| publisher = Tfh Publications Incorporated| isbn = 978-0-87666-567-1 }} < /ref > {{Rp|126}} < ref name= " Meh87 " > Mehrtens, John 1987. ''Living snakes of the world in color''. New York: Sterling. {{ISBN|978-0-8069-6461-4}} < /ref > {{Rp|209}} 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 Many snakes have [[skull]]s with more [[joint]]s than their lizard ancestors. This helps them swallow [[prey]] much larger than their heads. The bones of the head and jaws can move apart to let large prey move into their body. The [[throat]], [[stomach]] and [[intestines]] can also expand in a most extraordinary manner. In this was, a thin-looking snake can swallow and digest a larger animal. 
 
 To fit their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as [[kidneys]]) are one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most snakes have only one working [[lung]]. Some species have a [[pelvic girdle]] with a pair of [[vestigial]] claws on either side of the [[cloaca]]. This is a relic of the legs which do not appear in modern snakes. 
 
 == Shedding == 
 Snakes need to shed their skin regularly while they grow. This is called [[moulting]]. Snakes shed their skin by rubbing their head against something rough and hard, like a piece of wood or a [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. This causes the [[skin]], which is already stretched, to [[wikt:split|split]] open. The snake keeps on rubbing its skin on various rough objects until the skin peels off from its head. This lets it crawl out, turning the skin inside out. 
 
 == Feeding == 
 All snakes are carnivorous; they eat other [[animal]]s. Some are [[Venom (poison)|venomous]]; they inject [[venom]] along grooves in their teeth. Some snakes are constrictors. Constrictors are not venomous, so they squeeze their prey to death. Snakes [[swallow]] their [[food]] whole, and they cannot chew. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.snakefacts.net/|title=Snake facts - information on snakes|work=snakefacts.net|accessdate=4 May 2010|archive-date=16 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216181732/http://www.snakefacts.net/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Because snakes are [[cold-blooded]], they do not have to eat as regularly as mammals. People who own pet snakes feed them as infrequently as once per month. Some snakes can go as long as six months without a good meal. 
 
 Snakes have a very flexible lower jaw, the two halves of which are not rigidly attached, and many other joints in their skull. They can open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole, even if the prey is larger in diameter than the snake itself. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Behler| first1 = John L.| last2 = King| first2 = F. Wayne| title = The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians| url = https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyfi00behl| year = 1979| publisher = Alfred a Knopf Incorporated| isbn = 978-0-394-50824-5| page = [https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyfi00behl/page/581 581] }} < /ref > 
 
 == Movement == 
 Not having arms and legs doesn't stop snakes from moving. They have developed several different ways of moving to deal with particular environments. Each type of snake movement is discrete and distinct from the others. < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " > Cogger(1991), p. 175. < /ref > < ref name =  " Gray " > {{cite journal| last = Gray| first = J.| title = The mechanism of locomotion in snakes| journal = Journal of Experimental Biology| year = 1946| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages= 101–120| doi = 10.1242/jeb.23.2.101| pmid = 20281580 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Lateral undulation === 
 Lateral undulation is a snake's only way of moving in water, and the most common way of moving altogether. < ref name =  " Gray " / >  In this mode, the body of the snake alternately bends to the left and right, resulting in a series of rearward-moving  " waves " . < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " / >  While this movement appears rapid, snakes have rarely been seen moving faster than two body-lengths per second, often much less. < ref name =  " Hekrotte " > {{cite journal| last = Hekrotte| first = Carlton| title = Relations of body temperature, size, and crawling speed of the Common Garter Snake, ''Thamnophis s. sirtalis''| journal = Copeia| year = 1967| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages= 759–763| doi = 10.2307/1441886| jstor = 1441886}} < /ref >  This mode of movement has the same amount of calories burned per meter moved as running in lizards of the same mass. < ref name= " Walton " > {{Cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Michael|last2=Jayne|first2=Bruce C.|last3=Bennet|first3=Albert F.|date=1990-08-03|title=The Energetic Cost of Limbless Locomotion|url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.249.4968.524|journal=Science|language=en|volume=249|issue=4968|pages=524–527|doi=10.1126/science.249.4968.524|pmid=17735283 |s2cid=17065200 |issn=0036-8075}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Terrestrial ==== 
 Terrestrial lateral undulation is the most common mode of moving for most snake species. < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " / >  In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc. < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " / >  The movement is just the same over sand and in water. The movement makes a force against the substrate (ground, sand or water). This gives forward thrust. < ref name =  " Gray_lissman " / >  The speed of the movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment. < ref name =  " Hekrotte " / >  The wave speed is the same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it. Snakes move through dense vegetation, small openings, sand and water all quite well. < ref name =  " Gray_lissman " > {{cite journal| last = Gray J.  &  Lissman H.W 1950. | title = Kinetics of locomotion of the grass snake| journal = Journal of Experimental Biology| year = 1950| volume = 26| issue = 4| pages= 354–367| doi = 10.1242/jeb.26.4.354| url = http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/4/354}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Aquatic ==== 
 {{main|Sea snake}} 
 [[File:Banded Sea Snake-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|250px|Banded sea krait, ''[[Laticauda]]'']] 
 
 Snakes move forward in water by moving their bodies in a wave-like motion. The waves become larger as they move down the snake's body, and the wave travels backwards faster than the snake moves forwards. < ref name =  " Gray2 " > {{cite journal| last1 = Gray| first1 = J| last2 = Lissman| title = Undulatory propulsion| journal = Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science| year = 1953| volume = 94| pages= 551–578 }} < /ref >  Thrust is got by pushing their body against the water.  
 
 Studies show that the pattern of muscle activation is somewhat different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation.  < ref name =  " Jayne1 " > {{cite journal| last = Jayne| first = B.C.| title = Muscular mechanisms of snake locomotion: an electromyographic study of lateral undulation of the Florida banded water snake (''Nerodia fasciata'') and the yellow rat snake (''Elaphe obsoleta'')| journal = Journal of Morphology| year = 1988| volume = 197| pages= 159–181| doi = 10.1002/jmor.1051970204| pmid = 3184194| issue = 2 | s2cid = 25729192}} < /ref >  All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves). < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " / > 
 
 === Sidewinding === 
 {{main|Sidewinding}} 
 [[File:Crotalus scutulatus 03.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Mojave rattlesnake (''Crotalus scutulatus'') sidewinding]] 
 
 This is most often used by colubroid snakes ([[colubrid]]s, [[elapid]]s, and [[Viperidae|vipers]]). They use it when the environment lacks anything firm to push against, such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune. Sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up. This results in a peculiar  " rolling "  motion. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " > Cogger(1991), p. 177. < /ref > < ref name =  " Jayne2 " > {{cite journal| last = Jayne| first = B.C| title = Kinematics of terrestrial snake locomotion| journal = Copeia| year = 1986| pages= 915–927| doi = 10.2307/1445288| volume = 1986| issue = 4| jstor = 1445288 }} < /ref >  This mode of moving overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " / >  The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of moving has very low caloric cost, less than {{frac|1|3}} of the cost for a lizard or normal snake to move the same distance. < ref name= " Walton " / > 
 
 === Concertina === 
 When push-points are absent, but the space is too narrow for sidewinding, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on [[concertina]] moving. < ref name= " Cogger91_175 " / > < ref name =  " Jayne2 " / >  In this mode, the snake braces the back part of its body against the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " / >  The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the back part is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of moving is slow and very demanding, needing up to seven times the energy of laterally undulating over the same distance. < ref name= " Walton " / >  This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the need to use the muscles to brace against the tunnel walls. 
 
 === Rectilinear === 
 The slowest mode of snake moving is rectilinear moving, which is also the only one where the snake does not need to bend its body laterally, though it may do so when turning. < ref name= " Cogger91_176 " > Cogger (1991), p. 176. < /ref >  In this mode, the belly scales are lifted and pulled forward before being placed down and the body pulled over them. Waves of movement and stasis pass posteriorly, resulting in a series of ripples in the skin. < ref name= " Cogger91_176 " / >  The ribs of the snake do not move in this mode of moving and this method is most often used by large [[Pythonidae|python]]s, [[Boidae|boa]]s, and [[Viperidae|viper]]s when stalking prey across open ground as the snake's movements are subtle and harder to detect by their prey in this manner. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " / >

 The movement of snakes in trees has only recently been studied. < ref name =  " Astley " > {{cite journal|last1 = Astley|first1 =H.C.|last2 = Jayne|first2 = B.C.|title = Effects of perch diameter and incline on the kinematics, performance and modes of arboreal locomotion of corn snakes (''Elaphe guttata'')|year = 2007|journal = Journal of Experimental Biology|volume = 210|pages = 3862–3872|doi = 10.1242/jeb.009050|pmid = 17951427|issue = Pt 21|s2cid =18129284}} < /ref >  While on tree branches, snakes use several modes of moving depending on species and bark texture. < ref name= " Astley " / >  In general, snakes will use a modified form of concertina moving on smooth branches, but will laterally undulate if contact points are available. < ref name= " Astley " / >  Snakes move faster on small branches and when contact points are present, in contrast to limbed animals, which do better on large branches with little 'clutter'. < ref name= " Astley " / > 
 
 Gliding snakes (''[[Chrysopelea]]'') of southeast Asia launch themselves from branch tips, spreading their ribs and laterally undulating as they glide between trees. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " / > < ref name= " Freiberg84_135 " > Freiberg (1984), p. 135. < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | doi= 10.1038/418603a | last1= Socha | first1= JJ | title= Gliding flight in the paradise tree snake | journal=Nature | volume= 418 | issue= 6898 |pages= 603–604 | year= 2002 |pmid = 12167849 | s2cid= 4424131 }} < /ref >  These snakes can perform a controlled glide for hundreds of feet depending upon launch altitude and can even turn in midair. < ref name= " Cogger91_177 " / > < ref name= " Freiberg84_135 " / >
