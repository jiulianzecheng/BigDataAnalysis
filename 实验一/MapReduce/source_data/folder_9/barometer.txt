 A '''barometer''' is an instrument used to measure [[air pressure]]. The ''barometer'' measures air pressure in various kinds of units including [[hectopascals]] (hPa) and [[millibar]]s.

 There are various types of ''barometers'' such as the [[water barometer]], [[aneroid barometer]], and the [[mercury barometer]]. The mercury barometer, the earliest barometer, was created by an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]] named [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in [[1643]].  
 
 They are used for measuring [[altitude]], or height above the ground, such as the height of a mountain, and they were often used to measure altitude aboard a [[hot air balloon]].  Barometers are also used in modern aviation as [[altimeter]]s.  Miners sometimes use them to determine the depth of a mine.  The most used purpose of the barometer is measuring air pressure.  This helps meteorologists in predicting [[weather]]. 
 
 A '''barograph''' is a device which records barometric readings on paper.
