In the spring, [[perennial]] plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in [[herbaceous]] plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants. 
 
 In everyday speech, shoots are often [[synonymous]] with stems. 
 
 Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest. 
 As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure. 
 
 Some plants produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable (pleasant to eat).
