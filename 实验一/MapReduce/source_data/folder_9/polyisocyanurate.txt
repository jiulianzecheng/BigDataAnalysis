 '''Polyisocyanurate''' is a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] plastic. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/guides-and-manuals/gm-guide-insulating-sheathing/GM_Guide_Insulating_Sheathing.pdf |title=Guide to Insulating Sheathing |date=January 2007 |author=Building Science Corporation |page=6 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It is also called '''PIR''', '''polyiso''', or '''ISO'''. It is usually made as a [[foam]]. It is used as rigid [[thermal insulation]]. It is similar to [[polyurethane]] (PUR) except that the [[Proportions|proportion]] of [[methylene diphenyl diisocyanate]] is higher and a [[polyester]]-derived polyol is used in the [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] instead of a [[polyether]] [[polyol]].  [[Catalysis|Catalysts]] and [[Additive|additives]] used are also different from those used in PUR.
