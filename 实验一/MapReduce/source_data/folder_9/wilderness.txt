 '''Wilderness''' or '''wildland''' is a [[natural environment]] on [[Earth]] which has not been much disturbed by [[human]]s. < ref > The word ''wilderness'' derives from the notion of  " wildness " —in other words, that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning wild beast (wild + deor = beast, deer) (The Collins English Dictionary, 2000). < /ref >    
 
 : " The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet—those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure " . < ref > {{cite web

 Wilderness areas can be found in reserves, estates, farms, [[conservation]] areas, [[ranch]]es, [[National Forest]]s, [[National Park]]s and even in [[urban]] areas along [[river]]s, [[gulch]]es or any undeveloped areas. These areas are important for the survival of [[species]], [[biodiversity]], [[ecology]], conservation, solitude, and [[recreation]].  
 
 Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[morality|moral]], and [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity. < ref > No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157 < /ref >   
 
 They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide habitat for wild [[flora]] and [[fauna]] that may be difficult to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[garden]]s or [[laboratory|laboratories]]. 
 
 From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being  " wilderness " . Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered  " wild. "  This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which [[Nature|natural processes]] operate without human interference. 
 
 The [[WILD Foundation]] states that wilderness areas have two dimensions: they must be biologically intact and legally protected. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-areas-are-biologically-intact/ |title=Wilderness Areas are Biologically Intact |access-date=2010-11-26 |archive-date=2009-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202115528/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-areas-are-biologically-intact/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-as-a-protected-area-classification/ |title=Wilderness as a Protected Area Classification |access-date=2010-11-26 |archive-date=2009-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202115619/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/wilderness-as-a-protected-area-classification/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, Ia (Strict Nature Preserves) and Ib (Wilderness areas).  < !-- need detail here... -- >   
 
 Probably no place on earth is completely untouched by humanity, either due to past occupation by [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people, or through global processes such as [[climate change]]. Activities on the margins of specific wilderness areas, such as [[fire]] suppression and the interruption of [[animal migration]], also affect the wilderness. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.wildland-network.org.uk/wn_what_wildland.htm|title=WHAT IS WILDLAND? - a review|accessdate=2009-07-14|archive-date=2007-04-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430131349/http://www.wildland-network.org.uk/wn_what_wildland.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Especially in richer , industrialized nations, it has a specific legal meaning as well: as land where development is prohibited by [[law]]. Many nations have designated wilderness, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]].  
 
 Many new parks are currently being planned and legally passed by various [[Parliament]]s and [[Legislature]]s at the urging of dedicated individuals around the globe who believe that  " in the end, dedicated, inspired people empowered by effective legislation will ensure that the spirit and services of wilderness will thrive and permeate our society, preserving a world that we are proud to hand over to those who come after us " . < ref > Vance G.
