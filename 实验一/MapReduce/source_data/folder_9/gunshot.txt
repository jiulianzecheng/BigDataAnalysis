 A '''gunshot''' is the [[wikt:discharge|discharge]] of a [[firearm]]. It produces a mechanical [[sound effect]] and a [[chemical]] [[gunshot residue]]. The term can also refer to a [[gunshot wound]] caused by the [[bullet]]. Multiple discharges of a [[firearm]] or firearms are referred to as '''gunfire'''. The word can mean either the [[sound]] of a gun firing, the [[projectile]]s that were fired, or both.  For example, the statement  " gunfire came from the next street "  could either mean the sound of discharge, or it could mean the [[bullet]]s themselves.  It is better to be more [[wikt:specific|specific]] while [[writing]] however.  " The sound of gunfire "  or  " we came under gunfire "  would be more [[wikt:describe|descriptive]] and prevent [[wikt:confusion|confusion]]. 
 
 ==Gunfire characteristics== 
 There are three things that [[wikt:characterize|characterize]] gunfire and allow a person to [[wikt:detect|detect]] and [[wikt:locate|locate]] gunfire and similar [[weapon]] discharges: 
 # An [[optical]] [[wikt:flash|flash]] (called [[muzzle flash]]) that occurs when an [[Explosive material|explosive charge]] is ignited when firing the weapon. 
 # A [[muzzle blast]] that occurs when a weapon is fired. A typical muzzle blast generates a [[Sound|sound wave]] with a [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) of 140[[Decibel|dB]] or louder. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/sound-suppressors-101 |title=Sound Suppressors 101 |last=Horman |first=B. Gil |website=American Rifleman |access-date=27 November 2013 }} < /ref > 
 # A “snap” or “crack” caused by the [[sonic boom]] that occurs as a projectile moves through the air at [[supersonic]] speeds. 
 
 Gunfire can be confused with other sounds that can sound similar. These include [[firework]] explosions and cars [[backfiring]]. The sounds may be heard at greater distances in the direction of bullet travel than behind or to either side of the firearm. 
 
 Urban areas have noise patterns where background noise is higher during the daytime and lower at night. Firearm muzzle blast may be masked by background noise during daytime. But it may be detected at greater distances during the quieter hours of darkness. A popular urban gunfire locator system typically uses six to ten audio [[sensor]]s per square mile for [[trilateration]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1000/shotspot.html |title=Targeting the Source of Illegal Gunfire |last=Bradshaw |first=Tony |publisher=[[Esri]] |access-date=27 November 2013 }} < /ref >  (two or three per square kilometer) 
 
 == Suppressors == 
 A [[suppressor]], sometimes called a  " silencer " , can be attached to the [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]] of a firearm to reduce the sound of firing the weapon. Suppressors attached to the muzzle will not reduce the sound of high velocity gas released from other locations like the gap between the [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] and [[Gun barrel|barrel]] of a revolver. A muzzle silencer is also ineffective in reducing the snap of a supersonic bullet, or the noise produced by the mechanical action of a [[self-loading]] firearm. Use of silencers is rare in United States crimes. A 2007 study estimated un[[lawful]] silencers were involved in only 0.05 percent (1 in 2,000) federal criminal prosecutions. Also, these include cases where the silencer was not used, but simply in the possession of the defendant for 92% of prosecutions involving a silencer. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://wcr.sonoma.edu/v08n2/44.clark/clark.pdf |title=Criminal Use of Firearm Silencers |last=Clark |first=Paul A. |publisher=Western Criminology Review |access-date=27 November 2013 |archive-date=10 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910222113/http://wcr.sonoma.edu/v08n2/44.clark/clark.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
