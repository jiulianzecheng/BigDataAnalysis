 '''Kendang''' or '''Gendang'''  is a two-headed drum. It is used by people from the [[Indonesian Archipelago]]. Kendang is one of the first instruments used in the [[Gamelan]] ensembles of [[Javanese music|Javanese]], [[Music of Sunda|Sundanese]], and [[Balinese music|Balinese]], the Kendang ensemble as well as various [[Kulintang]] ensembles in [[Indonesia]]. It is made in many ways by different ethnic groups. 
 == Accompaniments == 
 ===Sundanese=== 
 In [[Gamelan degung|Sundanese Gamelan]], a minimum set consists of three drums. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Sunarto|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X82ngAACAAJ & q=sundanese+kendang|title=Kendang Sunda|date=2015|publisher=Penerbit Sunan Ambu Press, STSI Bandung|isbn=978-979-8967-50-4|language=id}} < /ref > 
 * '''{{lang|su|Kendang Indung}}''' (large drum) 
 * '''{{lang|su|Kendang Kulanter}}''', two (small drum). Kendang ''Kulanter'' is divided into two, namely the '''Katipung''' and the '''Kutiplak'''. 
 Many types of Sundanese Kendang are distinguished according to their function in accompaniment : 
 * ''Kendang Kiliningan''  
 * ''Kendang [[Jaipongan]]'' 
 * ''Kendang Ketuk Tilu'' 
 * ''Kendang Keurseus'' 
 * ''Kendang [[Pencak Silat|Penca]]'' 
 * ''Kendang Bajidor'' 
 * ''Kendang [[Sisingaan]]'' and others. 
 Each type of drums in [[Music of Sunda|Sundanese music]] has a difference in size, pattern, variety, and motif. 
 
 ===Javanese=== 
 In [[Gamelan Surakarta]], four sizes of kendhang are used: < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/indonesian/budaya_bangsa/Gamelan/Javanese_Gamelan/drums/kendang.htm | title=Kendang | access-date=2021-12-19 | archive-date=2021-12-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219150156/http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian/Budaya_Bangsa/Gamelan/Javanese_Gamelan/drums/kendang.htm | url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 * '''{{lang|jv|Kendhang ageng}}''', '''{{lang|jv|kendhang gede}}''' (''krama/ngoko'', similar to {{lang|jv|[[gong ageng]]}}), or '''{{lang|jv|kendhang gendhing}}''' is the largest {{lang|id|kendang}}, which usually has the deepest tone. It is played by itself in the {{lang|jv|kendhang satunggal}} (lit.  " single drum " ) style, which is used for the most solemn or majestic pieces or parts of pieces. It is played with the kendhang ketipung for {{lang|jv|kendhang kalih}} (lit.  " double drum " ) style, which is used in faster tempos and less solemn pieces. 
 * '''{{lang|jv|Kendhang wayang}}''' is also medium-sized, and was traditionally used to accompany {{lang|jv|[[wayang]]}} performances, although now other drums can be used as well. 
 * '''{{lang|jv|Kendhang batangan}}''' or '''{{lang|jv|kendhang ciblon}}''' < ref > https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/exhibits/show/ens/item/82{{Dead link|date=January 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  is a medium-sized drum, used for the most complex or lively rhythms. It is typically used for livelier sections within a piece. The word ''ciblon'' derives from a [[Java]]nese type of water-play, where people smack the water with different hand shapes to give different sounds and complex rhythms. The technique of this {{lang|id|kendang}}, which is said to imitate the water-play, < ref > Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). ''Javanese Gamelan'', p.22. {{ISBN|0-19-588582-1}}.  " The technique of {{lang|jv|kendang ciblon}} is very difficult to acquire.{{lang|jv|Ciblon}} is the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] name for a type of water-play, popular in villages, where a group of people, through smacking the water with different hand-shapes, produce complex sounds and rhythmic patterns. These sounds are imitated on the dance drum. " < /ref >  is more difficult to learn than the other kendang styles.
