 == Etymology == 
 [[File:PANTHOIBI.jpg|thumb|The word  " Pānthoibī " , written in Meetei Mayek abugida]] 
 The [[Meitei language|Meitei]] word  " Panthoibi "  (ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯢꯕꯤ or ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ) comes from three words,  " Pan "  (ꯄꯥꯟ),  " Thoi "  (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) and  " Bi "  (ꯕꯤ). 
 
 " Pan "  (ꯄꯥꯟ) means ''to rule over something''. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/sharma_query.py?qs=%EA%AF%84%EA%AF%A5%EA%AF%9F- & searchhws=yes#|title=Learners' Manipuri-English dictionary_pan|website=uchicago.edu|year=2006}} < /ref > 
 
 " Thoi "  (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) means ''to [[:en:wikt:exceed|exceed]]'', or ''to [[:en:wikt:transcend|transcend]]'', or ''to [[:en:wikt:win|win]]'', or ''to [[:en:wikt:excel|be very good at something]]'', or ''to [[:en:wikt:increase|increase]]''. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/sharma_query.py?qs=%EA%AF%8A%EA%AF%A3%EA%AF%8F- & searchhws=yes#|title=Learners' Manipuri-English dictionary_thoi|website=uchicago.edu|year=2006}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.webonary.org/manipuri?s=Thoi & search=Search & key= & search_options_set=1 & match_whole_words=1 & displayAdvancedSearchName=0|title=Manipuri Dictionary_Thoi|website=webonary.org}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[Meitei language]],  " Bi "  ( " Bee " ) (ꯕꯤ) or  " Pi "  ( " Pee " ) (ꯄꯤ) means that the rest of the word has a feminine [[grammatical gender|gender]]. For example, Thoibi is a name given to girls. It has  " Thoi "  and  " Bi " . < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/sharma_query.py?qs=thoibi & matchtype=default|title=Learners' Manipuri-English dictionary_thoibi|website=uchicago.edu|year=2006}} < /ref > 
 
 The word  " Thoibi "  (ꯊꯣꯢꯕꯤ or ꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ) also means [[:en:wikt:perfection|being perfect]] or beautiful and [[:en:wikt:accomplishment|good at doing things]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EMKAQAAIAAJ & q=khamba+thoibi|title=Khamba and Thoibi: The Unscaled Height of Love|first=N.

 The [[Cheitharol Kumbaba]] says people built the first temple to Panthoibi in 1686, and a statue in 1699. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 In the 18th century, fewer people worshipped Panthoibi. This because the religion [[Vaishnavism]] became common in [[Manipur]]. Hindu King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba (1709-1748) pulled down the temples to Panthoibi. He broke the statues of her. Her last temple was built in 1700. After that, people did not build new temples until modern times. < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref > History and Archaeology: Prof. H.D.

 Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. Panthoibi's husband's parents started to think something was wrong. Tarang Khoinucha tried to win her heart many times.

 Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou married on the sunny side of the [[Nongmaiching Hill]]s. The gods celebrated with dancing and music (by the ''Langmai people'' and not the ''gods'' in another version). This celebration was the start of the [[Lai Haraoba]] festival. < ref name= " :1 " / > < ref name= " Northeast India: A Reader " / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC & dq=panthoibi & pg=PA280|title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850|last=Mukherjee|first=Sujit|date=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-1453-9|pages=280|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==== Another version ==== 
 In another way of telling the story, Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou when she was helping her father at [[Slash-and-burn|farming]]. The two fell in love before they had talked. But Panthoibi got married to another man even though she did not want to. Later, she left her husband's house to search for Nongpok Ningthou.  Nongpok Ningthou also left his home to look for Panthoibi. The two met at the [[Kangla]]. Kangla became the place of their divine union. This is why Meitei kings do their [[coronation|crowning ceremony]] there. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/politicssocietyc00brar/page/72/mode/2up?q=Nongpok+Ningthou+Panthoibi|title=Politics, society, and cosmology in India's North East|website=archive.org|year=1998 |pages=73|isbn=978-0-19-564331-2 |last1=Vijaylakshmi Brara |first1=N. }} < /ref > 
 === Panthoibi and the Sun God === 
 According to the [[Numit Kappa]] text (c. 1st century), in ancient times, there were two suns in the sky. An [[Archery|archer]] hero (''many men'' in some version) shot one of the suns with an arrow and hurt it. The two brother suns ran away out of the sky. They hid for ten long days. The world was dark. No men could work. Crops and cows died. Then the ten godly kings (or ''kingly gods'') talked to the other gods. They asked each to talk to the Sun God. None succeeded. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. She showed them magical ceremonies to get the Sun God to come back. The unhurt Sun God came back, but the archer hit with the arrow did not. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q1FHAQAAMAAJ & dq=panthoibi & pg=PA551|title=Journal of the Society of Arts|date=1905|publisher=The Society|pages=551|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgfyAAAAMAAJ & dq=panthoibi & pg=PA551|title=Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce Journal|date=1905|publisher=The Society|pages=551|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a05DAAAAYAAJ & dq=panthoibi & pg=PA551|title=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|last=Britain)|first=Royal Society of Arts (Great|date=1905|publisher=G.

 [[File:Bunga senduduk 3.jpg|thumb|300px|Melastoma malabathricum]] 
 After the first human beings, Panthoibi made them a place to live. Humans started eating and drinking. Panthoibi realised they needed someplace to put food and water. So she started making pots. In the beginning, she did not know how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - ''Nura Khudonglei'' (''[[:en:Melastoma malabathricum|Malabar melastome]]''). She saw its shape. Then, she made a pot. Since then, humans could make pots for cooking food and drinking water. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZYwEAAAQBAJ & dq=panthoibi & pg=PA217|title=In Search of Business Models in Social Entrepreneurship: Concepts and Cases|last1=Guha|first1=Samapti|last2=Majumdar|first2=Satyajit|date=2021-05-28|publisher=Springer Nature|isbn=978-981-16-0390-7|pages=217|language=en}} < /ref >
