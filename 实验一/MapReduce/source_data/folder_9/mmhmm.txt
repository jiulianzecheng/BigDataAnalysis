 '''''Mmhmm''''' is the fourth [[album]] made by [[Relient k]]. It has other [[spelling]]s because it's a [[strange]] [[word]]. It is different from the bands previous albums, because it's heavier but also softer at times with the music. It marks the time where the band became more serious, using fewer [[joke]] songs than before. 
 
 This was their first album on their [[record label]] [[Capitol Records]]. It was also the last CD which Brian Pitman (Relient k [[bassist]]) recorded with the band. 
 
 The album was released again, with a new song which was first found on an [[Extended Play|EP]]. In [[2005]], the album was given gold status, because it had sold half a [[million]] copies in [[America]]. The album had a few singles which were played only on [[Christian radio]] such as  " [[High of 75]] "  and  " [[I so hate consequences]] " .
