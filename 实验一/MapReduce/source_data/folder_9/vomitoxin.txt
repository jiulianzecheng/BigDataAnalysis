[[File:Vomitoxin.gif|thumb|right|How vomitoxin is made.]] 
 '''Vomitoxin''' is a group name for many natural [[poison]]s made by [[fungi]] from the genus ''[[Fusarium]]''.  These fungi grow on grains, such as [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[barley]], and [[corn]].  The vomitoxin can stay in the grain. Things made out of the grain, such as [[flour]], [[beer]], or other food, may have vomitoxin in them.  If humans or other animals eat the food, they can become sick with [[vomiting]], dizziness, pain, and other problems.  These problems usually stop after some time. < ref name= " NCBI " > {{cite journal|title=Deoxynivalenol and its toxicity|author1=Pavlina Sobrova|author2=Vojtech Adam|author3=Anna Vasatkova|author4=Miroslava Beklova|author5=Ladislav Zeman|author6=and Rene Kizek|date=September 2010|doi=10.2478/v10102-010-0019-x|journal=Interdiscip Toxicol|volume=3|issue=3|pages= 94–99|pmid=21217881|pmc=2984136}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Chemistry== 
 
 There are more than 140 different vomitoxins. < ref name= " NCBI "  / >  The three most common are deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and T-2 toxin. 
 
 Deoxynivalenol does not break apart when it gets hot.  It can be [[cooking|cooked]] at 350°C and still stay a poison.  Some forms of cooking, like boiling, do help against deoxynivalenol. This is because the deoxynivalenol moves out of the grain into the water, and the water is thrown away. < ref name= " NCBI "  / > 
 
 Scientists believe that deoxynivalenol does not cause [[cancer]]. < ref name= " NCBI "  / > 
 
 ==In animals== 
 
 Animals that eat grain or other food with vomitoxin in it usually do not die, but they do usually eat less.  That makes them grow less. 
 
 Animals that eat grain that has vomitoxin in it can have the vomitoxin stay in their bodies.  Chickens fed vomitoxin lay eggs with vomitoxin in them.  Pigs fed vomitoxin have meat with vomitoxin in it.  Cows fed vomitoxin give milk with vomitoxin in it.  However, there is usually less vomitoxin in the animal product than in the grain that the animal ate. < ref name= " NCBI "  / > 
 
 ==Stopping vomitoxin== 
 
 Vomitoxin and the fungi that make it cost farmers money.  According to Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, ''Fusifarum'' in wheat and other crops cost [[Canadian dollar|C$]]50 million to $300 million each year in Canada alone from 1994 to 2014. < ref name= " Grainews " > {{cite news|title=Fusarium in the bin|author=Patty Milligan|url=https://www.grainews.ca/crops/fusarium-in-the-bin/|date=December 2, 2014|access-date=July 2, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 Farmers can do several things to prevent vomitoxin from getting into food.  They can use [[crop rotation]], plant seeds that have been checked to have no ''Fusarium'' in them, plant types of crops that are strong against ''Fusarium'', and put fungicide on the crops to kill the fungus.  Because fungal infections make the crop plants smaller and lighter, sometimes farmers can use [[combine harvester]]s to blow air on the crops so that the infected wheat blows away leaving the heavier healthy wheat behind. < ref name= " Grainews "  / >
