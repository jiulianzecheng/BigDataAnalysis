 An '''astroctytoma''' is a form of a [[brain tumor]] that comes from [[astrocyte]]s (a type of [[brain cell]]).  
 
 There are many kinds of astrocytomas. They are separated into two categories; Low-grade astrocytomas and High-grade astrocytomas. 
 
 == Low-grade astrocytomas == 
 Low-grade astrocytomas usually grow slowly and stay in one place. Because of this, many of them can be treated just with [[surgery]]. Once the tumor is taken out, often no other treatment is needed. As long as they get treatment, after five years, 90% of people with these astrocytomas are still alive. 
 
 One example of a low-grade astrocytoma is ''pilocytic astrocytoma.'' 
 
 == High-grade astrocytomas == 
 High-grade astrocytomas grow much more quickly and tend to [[Metastasis|spread throughout the body]]. Because of this, they are harder to treat and have worse [[Prognosis|prognoses]] than low-grade astrocytomas. 
 
 One example of a high-grade astrocytoma is ''anaplastic astrocytoma''. This type of tumor has to be treated with a [[chemotherapy]] called [[Temozolomide]].
