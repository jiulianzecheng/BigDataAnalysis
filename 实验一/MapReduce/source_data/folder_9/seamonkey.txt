It works on many [[operating system]]s.  It is very useful, and includes an [[e-mail]] client, a [[calendar]], a [[HTML]] [[editor]], an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] client, and a [[web browser]].

 == History == 
 On March 10, 2005 the Mozilla Foundation said that they will not develop the '''Mozilla Application suite''', including the Netscape [[web browser]], because [[Firefox]] and [[Thunderbird]] were more popular. The SeaMonkey Council renamed the project '''SeaMonkey''' and continued its development. The newest version of its main release version is 2.53.17.1. 
 
 == Features == 
 The web browser of SeaMonkey contains a lot of features used in new web browsers like tabbed browsing, pop-up blocking, e-mail, newsgroups, web editing software, spell checking, and an address book. 
 
 Optionally included in the SeaMonkey suite is an [[IRC]] chat application.
