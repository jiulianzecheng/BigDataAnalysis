 '''Chiapas''' is the southernmost state of [[Mexico]]. It is towards the southeast of the country. Chiapas is bordered by the states of [[Tabasco (state)|Tabasco]] to the north, [[Veracruz]] to the northwest, and [[Oaxaca]] to the west. To the east Chiapas borders [[Guatemala]], and to the south the [[Pacific Ocean]].  
 
 Chiapas has an area of {{convert|28528|sqmi|km2}}. The 2005 census population was 4,293,459 people. 
 
 In general Chiapas has a [[humid]], [[tropical]] weather. In the north, in the area bordering Tabasco, near Teapa, rainfall can be more than 3,000 & nbsp;mm (118 & nbsp;in) per year . In the past, natural vegetation at this region was lowland, tall perennial [[rainforest]], but this vegetation has been destroyed almost completely to give way to agriculture and ranching. Rainfall decreases moving towards the [[Pacific Ocean]], but it is still abundant enough to allow the farming of bananas and many other tropical crops near [[Tapachula]]. On the several parallel  " sierras "  or mountain ranges running along the center of Chiapas, climate can be quite temperate and foggy. This allows the development of [[cloud forests]] like those of the [[Reserva de la Biosfera el Triunfo]], home to a handful of [[Resplendent Quetzal|quetzal]]s and [[horned guan]]s. 
 
 The state [[capital city|capital]] is [[Tuxtla Gutiérrez]]. Other cities and towns in Chiapas include [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Comitán]], and [[Tapachula]]. Chiapas is also home to the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins of [[Palenque]], [[Yaxchilan]], [[Bonampak]], [[Chinkultic]], and [[Tonina]]. 
 
 Most people in Chiapas are poor, rural small farmers. About one quarter of the population are of full or predominant [[Maya peoples|Maya]] descent, and in rural areas many do not speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The state suffers from the highest rate of [[malnutrition]] in Mexico. This rate is estimated to affect over 40% of the population. 
 
 Other social issues involve the increasing presence of the Central American gangs known as [[Maras (gangs)|Maras]], and illegal immigration from Central America in general. This migration is mostly directed towards the [[United States]], but it makes local poverty even worse. Many times, there are [[abuse]] and [[Human Rights]] violations that touch these migrants. 
 
 In 1994, there was an outbreak of violence between the Mexican Government and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (the EZLN or Zapatistas). Today, the EZLN (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, named in honour of [[Emiliano Zapata]]) has rejected the use of force and seek to be recognized as a voice of the poor. There are currently 32  " rebel autonomous zapatista municipalities "  (independent Zapatista communities, MAREZ in Spanish), controlled by the EZLN in Chiapas: examples of these communities are [[Ocosingo]] and [[Las Margaritas]].
