 An '''interregnum''' is a period between monarchs, between [[pope]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[emperor]]s of [[Holy Roman Empire]], Polish kings ([[elective monarchy]]) or between [[Roman consul|consuls]] of the [[Roman Republic]]. It can also refer any [[gap]] in the [[continuity]] of a [[government]], organization, or social order. The period of interregnum may be peaceful, or it may collapse into [[chaos]] and [[anarchy]]. 
 
 In some [[monarchy|monarchies]], such as the [[United Kingdom]], an ''interregnum'' is usually avoided due to a rule described as  " [[The King is dead. Long live the King|the king is dead, long live the King]] " , i.e. the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or [[abdication]]. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of [[sovereignty]]. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with [[coronation]] or some other formal or traditional event.  
 
 == Pope's ''interregnum'' (or ''sede vacante'') == 
 An ''interregnum'' occurs also upon the death of the Roman Catholic Pope, though this is generally known as a ''sede vacante'' (vacant seat).  The interregnum ends immediately upon election of the new Pope by the [[College of Cardinals]].
