The word ''dirge'' came from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''dirige'', which means  " direct " . < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=dirge & searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work=etymonline.com |access-date=23 July 2010}} < /ref >  It is likely that ''dirge'' also came from the old expression ''Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam'' ( " Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God " ).  " Dirge " , meaning ''to direct'', is the same as a  " dirigible "  ( " steerable " ) [[airship]]. These two words became connected in 1937 because of the [[Hindenburg disaster]].
