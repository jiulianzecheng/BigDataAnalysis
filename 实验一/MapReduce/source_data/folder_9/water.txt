 [[File:Iceberg with hole near Sandersons Hope 2007-07-28 2.jpg|thumb|Water in three [[States of matter|states]]: [[liquid]] (including the clouds, which are [[aerosol]]s), [[solid]] ([[ice]]) and [[gas]] ([[water vapour]])]] 
 
 '''Water''' ({{chem|[[Hydrogen|H]]|2|[[Oxygen|O]]}}) is a [[transparent]], [[taste]]less, [[smell|odourless]], and almost [[color|colour]]less [[chemical substance]] and covers about 71% of [[Earth]]'s surface.  
 
 No known [[life]] can live without it. Water is essential for life. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/background.html |title=United Nations |publisher=Un.org |date=2005-03-22 |accessdate=2010-07-25}} < /ref >  This has to be qualified a bit. There are some forms of life which can survive without it, but cannot [[Reproduction|reproduce]] without it. Since reproduction is a central part of life, it is clear that water is essential for an organism to survive and reproduce. 
 
 [[Lake]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[river]]s are made of water. [[Precipitation]] is water that falls from [[cloud]]s in the [[sky]]. It may be [[rain]] if it is liquid, or it may be snow or ice [[Freezing|frozen]] if it is cold. When water gets below {{convert|0|C}}, it [[freeze]]s and becomes [[ice]], the frozen kind of water. If water gets very hot (above {{convert|100|C}}, it [[Boiling|boils]] and becomes [[steam]] or [[water vapor]].  
 
 There is a [[water cycle]]. 
 
 == Physical chemistry of water == 
 Water is a [[fluid]]. Water is the only [[chemical substance]] on Earth that exists naturally in three [[States of matter|state]]s. There are over 40 [[wikt:anomaly|anomalies]] (strange things) about water. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://fathersergio.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/forty-one-anomalies-of-water/ |title=Forty-one anomalies of water « Fairy LoRe |first= |last= |work=fathersergio.wordpress.com |year=2011|accessdate=September 1, 2011}} < /ref >  Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water [[freezing|freezes]], it expands by about 9%. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8a.html |title=8(a) Physical Properties of Water |first= |last= |work=physicalgeography.net |year=2011|quote=pan |accessdate=August 31, 2011}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mountainnature.com/geology/erosion.htm |title=Understanding the processes of erosion |first= |last= |work=mountainnature.com |year=2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2011 |archive-date=August 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828165031/http://www.mountainnature.com/Geology/Erosion.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.iapws.org/faq1/freeze.htm |title= iapws.org |first=  |last=  |year= 2000 |accessdate= August 31, 2011 |archive-date= August 8, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110808093427/http://www.iapws.org/faq1/freeze.htm |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes. 
 
 Water is a [[molecule]] made of two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s and one [[oxygen]] atom. Its [[chemical formula]] is H < sub > 2 < /sub > O. 
 Like other liquids, water has a [[surface tension]], so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/liquids-and-solids-11/liquid-properties-85/surface-tension-376-6402/ |title=Surface tension is a contractive tendency of the surface of a liquid that allows it to resist an external force. |author= |website= |publisher=Boundless |accessdate=December 25, 2016 |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603233926/https://www.boundless.com/chemistry/textbooks/boundless-chemistry-textbook/liquids-and-solids-11/liquid-properties-85/surface-tension-376-6402/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Things having something to do with water may have  " hydro "  or  " aqua "  in their name, such as [[hydropower]] or [[aquarium]], from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] names for water. It is also called the  " universal solvent " , because it dissolves many other [[chemical compound|compounds]]. 
 
 In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color. 
 
 == Uses of water == 
 [[Plant]]s and [[animal]]s (including [[wikt:people|people]]) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a [[Media|medium]] for [[chemical reaction]]s to take place, and is the main part of [[blood plasma|blood]]. It keeps the [[body temperature]] the same by [[sweat]]ing from the [[skin]].  Water helps blood carry [[nutrient]]s from the [[stomach]] to all parts of the body to keep the body alive.  Water also helps the blood carry [[oxygen]] from the [[lung]]s to the body.  [[Saliva]], which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make [[urine]]. Urine helps remove bad [[chemical]]s from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water, but this value differs with age; i.e. a foetus is 95% water inside. 
 
 Water is the main component of [[drink]]s like [[milk]], [[juice]], and [[wine]]. Each type of drink also has other things that add [[flavor]] or [[nutrient]]s, things like [[sugar]], [[fruit]], and sometimes [[alcohol]]. Water that a person can drink is called  " potable water "  (or  " drinking water " ). The water in oceans is [[salt water]], but lakes and rivers usually have [[fresh water|unsalted water]]. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html|title=Percentage of water|access-date=2008-12-11|archive-date=2013-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091601/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/water.htm|title=Fresh water percentage (2)|access-date=2008-12-11|archive-date=2007-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715121554/http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/water.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 [[File:Water drop animation enhanced small.gif|thumb|Drop of water falling from a faucet.]] 
 Many places, including cities and [[desert]]s, don't have as much water as people want. They build [[aqueduct]]s to bring water there. 
 
 Though people can survive a few months without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water.  A few [[desert]] animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink. 
 Water has no smell, taste, or color. 
 
 Water is also used for recreational purposes, ''see [[list of water sports]]''. 
 
 Water is used as both the coolant and the [[neutron moderator]] in most [[nuclear reactor]]s. This may be ordinary water (called light water in the nuclear industry) or [[heavy water]]. 
 
 Water is also used for washing a lot of objects. [[Good (economics)|Goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]] and people are transported to other [[Country|countries]] in [[watercraft]]s on bodies of water. 
 
 Water is used in [[chemical reaction]]s as a [[solvent]] or [[Reagent|reactant]]. Water is also used in [[Firefighting|fire fighting]]. Water is also used for [[cooking]]. 
 
 == Dihydrogen monoxide parody == 
 The dihydrogen monoxide [[parody]] involves calling water by the unfamiliar chemical name  " dihydrogen monoxide "  (DHMO) and listing some of its harmful effects in an alarming way. Some examples include talking about how  " it causes burning, suffocation and corrosion, "  when it is actually just talking about hot water, drowning and rust. Sometimes the parody calls for it to be banned and/or labelled as dangerous. 
 
 The prank works because it takes advantage of people's misunderstanding. Calling water by an unfamiliar name and making it sound like a harmful chemical can make people think it is dangerous. 
 
 " Dihydrogen monoxide "  is an alternative chemical name for water, but nobody uses it. The word  " dihydrogen "  means two hydrogens, and  " monoxide "  means one oxygen. The chemical formula of water has two hydrogens and one oxygen. 
 
 The parody gained most of its popularity in the 1990s, when a 14-year-old named Nathan Zohner collected anti-DHMO petitions for a science project about gullibility. Zohner fooled a lot of people, which has led to his project being used in lessons about critical thinking and the scientific method. 
 
 The website DHMO.org is a joke website which lists the harmful effects of water (DHMO), answers questions, and calls for it to be banned, among other things.

 === The weirdness of water === 
 A BBC short item  explains that every molecule on [[Earth]] has existed for [[1,000,000,000|billion]]s of years, and all of them came from elsewhere. Water is alien because it arrived on [[asteroids]] and [[comets]]. It is the second most common molecule in the [[universe]]. Why is it not a gas? It is made of two very light elements. Ice floating on water is also an oddity. Also, hot water freezes faster than cold, and no-one knows why this is. Molecules of water can move up against the force of [[gravity]] (that is due to surface [[adhesion]]). < ref > Jha, Alok 2019. Why water is one of the weirdest things in the universe.

Its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Most other [[planetary system]]s may have similar ingredients. 
 
 === Origin of water on Earth: possibilities === 
 We do not know exactly how the Earth came to have so much water. It is everywhere in the Universe, but it is uncommon for a place to have so much. The reasoning is like this: every element (except hydrogen and some [[helium]]) has been formed in stars. Therefore, oxygen was originally formed in stars. The formation of water is not a problem: it is [[exothermic]], so forming the molecule from its atoms does not need outside energy. But to explain why the Earth has so much compared to, for example, [[Mars]], is not easy. It is an undecided problem in [[planetary geology]]. 
 
 For a while, people thought Earth’s water did not come from the planet’s region of the [[protoplanetary disk]]. Instead, it was thought that water and other [[volatiles]] must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. But hydrogen inside the Earth did play some role in the formation of the ocean. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Monday|first1=Nola Taylor Redd {{!}} Published|last2=April 1|last3=2019|title=Where did Earths water come from|url=https://astronomy.com/magazine/2019/04/where-did-earths-water-come-from|access-date=2020-07-16|website=Astronomy.com}} < /ref >  The two ideas may each be partly right.
