 '''Scandinavia''' is a group of [[countries]] in [[northern Europe]]. Scandinavia has [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Some people also think [[Finland]] is part of Scandinavia. Others also say [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] should count. < ref name= " Brit " > {{cite web|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=January 6, 2020|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Scandinavia/|title=Scandinavia|date=|author=((Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica))}} < /ref >  Most of the time,  " Scandinavia "  is used to mean places where people speak '''Scandinavian languages''', also called [[North Germanic languages]] or Nordic. The Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese) are very similar to each other, and many Scandinavians understand parts of the other languages because they are alike in some ways. Finnish is not part of the North Germanic language group. 
 
 What people mean when they say  " Scandinavia "  depends on what they think is important at the time. When people want to talk about about maps, natural land formations and how the economy works, they may say Finland is part of Scandinavia but Iceland is not. When people want to talk about history and what languages people speak, they say Iceland is part of Scandinavia but Finland is not. < ref name= " Brit "  / > 
 
 The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large [[peninsula]] reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Norway, Sweden and some of [[Finland]] are on this peninsula. However, Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia in the ethnic sense more often than Finland is. This is because [[Danish language|Danish]] is a Scandinavian language but [[Finnish language|Finnish]] is not. 
 
 Some people like to say  " [[Nordic countries]] "  instead of  " Scandinavia "  because they think it is more correct about geography. The Nordic countries include Norway, Sweden, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, and Iceland. These five countries use the [[Nordic Council]] to work together on political and cultural activities. Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are also members of the [[European Union]], but only Finland is part of the [[eurozone]], meaning that it uses the [[Euro]] as its [[currency|money]]. The other Nordic countries still use their own money, called ''krone'' or ''krona'' (from the word  " crowns " ). Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU, are members of [[NATO]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Only Denmark and Finland are members of both the EU and NATO.

 ==Geography== 
 
 Most of the Scandinavian Peninsula has only a few people in it. It has large forests of [[pine]], [[birch]], and [[spruce]] trees. The western and northern parts are mountainous; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world. The tallest mountain is [[Galdhøpiggen]] in Norway. Denmark (43,098 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup > ) is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. It is more densely populated, and most of the land is farmland. Sweden (449,964 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup > ) is the largest of the Scandinavian countries. It has the most lakes, and the landscape ranges from [[:wikt:plain|plains]] in the south to mountains in the west (along the border with Norway) to [[tundra]] in the north. The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called [[Lapland]], where the [[Sámi]] live. Some of them still herd [[reindeer]], but most Sami live in modern houses and have modern jobs, like other Scandinavians. 
 
 == Vikings == 
 
 The most famous group of Scandinavians is the [[Viking]]s of the Middle Ages. The Vikings attacked and raided but they were also traders, traveling to [[Ukraine]] and starting trade routes to the [[Middle East]]. 
 
 Vikings from Norway were explorers, crossing the [[North Atlantic]] in their [[longship]]s. They came to Iceland and [[Greenland]] and built towns and farms there. The Norwegian explorers also came to the east coast of [[Canada]]. They built at least one town there, but it did not last into modern times. < ref name= " ROM " > {{cite web|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|title=Vikings in Canada|url=https://www.rom.on.ca/en/blog/vikings-in-canada|author=Craig Cippola|date=October 18, 2017|accessdate=January 4, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 The Vikings from Denmark came to England, where they affected the history and politics and even the English language. Danish raiders attacked England many times with great violence. Sometimes the Danes would ask that the English pay them to go away. These payments were called  " [[Danegeld]] "  (Danish gold). The [[priests]] and [[bishop]]s of churches on the east coast of England wrote a famous prayer:  " deliver us, O Lord, from the wrath of the Norsemen! "   " Norsemen "  is another way to say  " men from the north, "  or the Danes. < ref name= " OxfordED " > {{cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/danegeld|publisher=Oxford English Dictionaries|accessdate=January 6, 2020|date=|title=Danegeld|author=|archive-date=November 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122080633/https://www.lexico.com/definition/danegeld|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " OxfordED2 " > {{cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/norse|publisher=Oxford English Dictionaries|accessdate=January 6, 2020|date=|title=Norse|author=|archive-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029011319/https://www.lexico.com/definition/norse|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Scandinavians in fiction and theater== 
 
 Much later, in the 19th century (1800s), [[Richard Wagner]] and other artists in the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] made [[opera]]s and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners dressed the actors in the opera ''Ring des Nibelungen'' so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings. < ref name= " Vox " > {{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11526568/vikings-horned-helmets|title=Vikings never wore horned helmets.

 ==History== 
 During the 10th through 13th centuries, when [[Christianization|the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia]], modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms: 
 * Denmark 
 * Sweden 
 * Norway 
 These three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, [[civil war]] started in Denmark and Norway. Then, the [[Protestant Reformation]] happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814. It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland. 
 
 The borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century. In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some land to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre  &  Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia). The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway. 
 
 Finland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times. During the wars fought by [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleon]], it became part of Russia.
