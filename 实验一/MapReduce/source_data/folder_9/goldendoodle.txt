 ==Care and Maintenance== 
 Golden doodles are a high-maintenance breed. They will need to be professionally groomed every 8 to 12 weeks. A Golden doodle needs at least 15 to 30 & nbsp;minutes of exercise three times a day. When a puppy, they tend to want to play interactive games like fetch, but as they grow older, they enjoy a gentle stroll. Haircuts are necessary for Golden doodles every six weeks.
