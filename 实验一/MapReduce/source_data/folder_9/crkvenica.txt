 '''Crkvenica''' is a [[Bosnia]]n river. It is a right bank tributary of the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja River]].  
 
 Crkvenica rises between the northwestern slopes of [[Očauš]] and [[Šiprage|Šipraška brda]] mountains. It flows southeast at around {{convert|1200|m}} above sea level. The river drains the central part of the northern slopes of the Dinaric mountain [[massif]]. Its mouth is in [[Šiprage]] ([[Kotor Varoš]]). It is {{convert|12|km|abbr=off}} long. 
 
 The river is known for its water mills; during the 1950s, there were about 18 of them. < ref > Vojnogeografski institut, Ed. (1955): Travnik (List karte 1:100.000, Izohipse na 20 m).

 The narrow area of the river's [[headwaters]] contains a [[drainage basin|watershed]] between the confluence of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] Rivers. 
 
 [[Tufa]] [[stećci]] on the Crkvenica riverbank is a relic of the [[Bogomil]] settlement in the twelfth century. The stećci was originally located at the confluence of the Crkvenica and the Vrbanja. < ref > Radimsky V.

One of the most well-preserved [[tombstone]]s is in its original location, submerged in the River Vrbanja.
