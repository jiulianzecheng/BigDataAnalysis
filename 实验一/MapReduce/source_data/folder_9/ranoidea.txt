 The '''Ranoidea''' are a [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] of [[frog]]s in the order Anura. These frogs have a fused pectoral girdle bone in their chests, no ribs, and the males hold on to the female with an axillary grip during [[amplexus|mating]]. The tadpoles have a single [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]] on the left side and complex mouthparts. Some species do not have tadpoles, and small frogs grow straight from eggs. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura/40610/Critical-appraisal |title=Anura: Critical appraisal |author1=Duellman, William E. |author2=Zug, George R. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=2012-09-24 |df=dmy-all}} < /ref >  Scientists disagree about exactly which frogs should be placed in which family and on exactly where Ranoidea belongs among groups of amphibians.  [[Herpetology|Amphibian scientists]] often change their minds about exactly which frogs are related to each other and how closely, usually when someone finds new information (Glaw,Vences, 2001). 
 
 This superfamily contains seventeen different families, each containing at least 2 species (some contain over 300 & nbsp;different species). < ref name=VittCaldwell2014 > {{cite book |title=Herpetology: An Introductory Biology of Amphibians and Reptiles |edition=4th |first1=Laurie J. |last1=Vitt |first2=Janalee P. |last2=Caldwell |name-list-style=amp |publisher=Academic Press |year=2014 |isbn=9780123869197 |oclc=839312807}} < /ref > < ref name=vdMeijden2006 > {{cite journal |last=van & nbsp;der & nbsp;Meijden |first=Arie |date=2006-01-01 |df=dmy-all |title=Molecular phylogeny and biogeography of ranoid frogs |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30019672}} < /ref >

 === Ranixalidae === 
 The family of [[Ranixalidae]] (Leaping Frogs) has one genus containing 10 & nbsp;different species. They live in central and southern [[India]]. They live in leaf litter and in [[tropical deciduous forest]]s, near streams and can be found between 200 & nbsp;m and 1100 & nbsp;m above [[sea level]]. 
 
 === Mantellidae === 
 The family of [[Mantellidae]] (Malagasy Poison Frogs) has 3 & nbsp;different genera with 191 & nbsp;species total. They live in Madagascar and Mayotte Island. They are both [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] and [[tree frog]]s and live between 800 and 1000 & nbsp;m above sea level. 
 
 === Rhacophoridae === 
 The family of [[Rhacophoridae]] (Afroasian Tree Frogs) has two subfamilies, 14 genera, and a total of 321 & nbsp;species. They live in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and South Asia. They are mainly tree frogs. < ref > {{cite web |first1=Peter, Dr. |last1=Ducey |editor1-first=Craig |editor1-last=Cramer |date=n.d. |title=Glossary |website=Cortland Herpetology Connection |url=http://www.cortland.edu/herp/keys/glossary.htm |publisher=State University of New York |place=Cortland, NY |department=Biology SUNY Cortland}} < /ref >

 === Pyxicephalidae === 
 The family of [[Pyxicephalidae]] (African Bullfrogs) has two subfamilies, 13 & nbsp;genera, and 68 & nbsp;total species. They live in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The two subfamilies are completely different. Cacosternine frogs are small and slender and live on the ground or in and out of water. Pyxicephaline frogs are large bullfrog-like frogs with thick bodies and fanglike bones on their lower [[jaw]]s, used to smash their prey. 
 
 === Petropedetidae === 
 The family of [[Petropedetidae]] (African Water Frogs and Goliath Frog) has two genera with a total of 18 & nbsp;different species. They live in Sub-Saharan Africa. This family contains the world's largest living frog, the ''[[Goliath frog|Conraua goliath]].'' 
 
 === Ptychadenidae === 
 The family of [[Ptychadenidae]] (Grassland Frogs) has 3 & nbsp;genera with a total of 53 & nbsp;different species. They live in sub-Saharan Africa. They live in grasslands and savannas. They have slender bodies with long arms and legs. 
 
 === Ceratobatrachidae === 
 The family of [[Ceratobatrachidae]] (Triangle Frogs) has 5 & nbsp;genera with a total of 84 & nbsp;different species. They live in [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[New Guinea]], and the [[Solomon Islands]]. Most have very angular bodies and are small to medium-sized. They live in the forests. 
 
 === Brevicipitidae === 
 The family of [[Brevicipitidae]] (Rain frogs) has 5 & nbsp;genera with 31 & nbsp;total species. They live in the southeast corner of [[Africa]]. They are typically small with round shaped bodies, which become even more round when they are disturbed because they inflate themselves.
