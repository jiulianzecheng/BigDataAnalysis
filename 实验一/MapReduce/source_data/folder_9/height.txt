 '''Height''' is the [[distance]] between the lowest end and highest end of an [[wikt:object|object]]. 
 
 For example, it is said the bottom of the foot is a person's lowest end, and the top of the head is a person's highest end. If the distance between the bottom of a person's foot and the top of that person's head is 64 [[inch]]es, then that person's height is 64 inches. 
 
 Height is measured in [[3D]] objects. [[2D]] objects do not have height; they only have length and [[width]].
