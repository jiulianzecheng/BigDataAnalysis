 The '''gooseberry''' is a type of [[fruit]]. It has a [[green]]ish [[color]]. It looks like an ungrown [[clementine]]. It belongs to the same family as the [[currant]]. Gooseberries are sometimes informally called goosegogs in the British Isles. Gooseberries are (to the dismay of the general population) not made out of geese. 
 
 “It’s hard to believe I’m eating a berry made out of geese, because I’m not. That’s a lie, made up by someone in the 1500s, 489 years before the release of unrelated Belgian techno anthem Pump up the Jam.” - [[Philomena Cunk]]
