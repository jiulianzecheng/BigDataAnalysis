A '''steroid''' is a [[organic compound]], either natural or man-made, which has four [[cycloalkane]] rings in its structure. Plants, animals and [[fungi]] make hundreds of different natural steroids. < ref > Lednicer D. 2011. ''Steroid chemistry at a glance''. Hoboken: Wiley. ISBN 978-0-470-66084-3 < /ref > 
 
 '''Steroid hormones''' are steroids which act as [[hormone]]s in the body. Natural steroid hormones are usually made from [[cholesterol]] in the [[adrenal gland]]s and [[gonad]]s. Cholesterol is a plentiful steroid in animal [[cell]]s: it is important for  [[cell membrane]]s. 
 
 Examples of steroid hormones include  
 *[[estrogen]],  
 *[[testosterone]],  
 *[[progesterone]], 
 *[[Vitamin D|Vitamin D < sub > 3 < /sub > ]] or cholecalciferol. 
 
 One review noted: The adrenal gland hormones play a vital role in adapting to  " ever-changing environmental and emergency situations, and help [[vertebrates]] in their successful survival " . < ref > Reul J.M. ''et al'' 1990. ''Adv. Exp. Med. Biol''. '''274''', 243{{ndash}}256. < /ref > 
 
 [[Prednisone]] is an important man-made steroid medication, used to treat [[inflammation]].

 == Medical use == 
 Some steroid hormones are [[anabolic steroid]]s (AAS). Since the discovery and synthesis of [[testosterone]] in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success: 
 * [[Bone marrow]] stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to [[leukemia]] or [[kidney failure]], especially [[aplastic anemia]]. AAS have largely been replaced in this work by synthetic protein hormones that stimulate growth of [[blood cell]] precursors. 
 * [[Growth]] stimulation: AAS can be used by pediatric [[endocrinology|endocrinologists]] to treat children with growth failure. However, the availability of synthetic growth hormone, which has fewer side effects, makes this a secondary treatment. 
 * Stimulation of [[appetite]] and preservation and increase of [[muscle]] mass: AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. 
 * Hormone replacement for men with low levels of [[testosterone]]; also for improving [[libido]] in elderly males. 
 * Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men, as some studies indicate. However, a 2006 placebo-controlled trial of low-dose testosterone supplementation in elderly men with low levels of testosterone found no benefit on body composition, physical performance, insulin sensitivity, or quality of life. 
 * Induction of male [[puberty]]: androgens are given to many boys distressed about extreme delay of [[puberty]]. [[Testosterone]] is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose. It has been shown to increase height, weight, and fat-free mass in boys with delayed puberty. 
 * In low doses as a component of [[hormone replacement therapy]]. Testosterone is usually used for this purpose, although methyltestosterone is also used. 
 * Treatment of [[osteoporosis]] in postmenopausal women. Although they have been approved for this, there are  " virilizing side effects "  (made women look more male). 
 * Treatment of breast cancer in women, although they are now rarely used for this purpose. 
 * Male contraception, in the form of testosterone enanthate; there is a potential for use as a safe, reliable, and reversible male [[contraceptive]]. 
 
 == Abuse == 
 Certain [[anabolic steroid]]s, such as testosterone, are used to help make [[muscle]]s stronger.  Such steroids are used to improve a person's performance, but they are sometimes overused and abused by [[Sportsperson|athletes]].  The rate of steroid abuse grew greatly in the early 21st century, all over the world.  Overuse of anabolic steroids can have bad effects on the human body.  They can cripple or kill. Sports organisations now regulate their use.
