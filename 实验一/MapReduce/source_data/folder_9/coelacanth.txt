 A '''coelacanth''' is a type of [[fish]] in the [[Sarcopterygii]], the [[lobe-finned fish]]es. < ref > Coelacanth is pronounced 'seela-canth' 
 < /ref >  They are a sister group to those fish which [[evolved]] into [[tetrapod]]s. < ref > The sister group which included the ancestors of the tetrapods is called the [[Rhipidistia]]. < /ref >  Their [[fossil]] record goes back 400 million years, before any land vertebrates had evolved. < ref name=Joh > Johanson, Zerina, John A. Long, John A. Talent, Philippe Janvier, and James W. Warren. 2006. Oldest Coelacanth, from the early Devonian of Australia. ''Biology Letters'' 2.3  443–46 < /ref > 
 
 There are at least two [[species]] of coelacanths living in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Scientists thought they had been extinct for 80 million years until one was caught off the [[east Africa]]n [[wikt:coast|coast]] in 1938. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvarDwAAQBAJ|title=Islands in a Cosmopolitan Sea: A History of the Comoros|last=Walker|first=Iain|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-007130-1|location=|pages=16|language=en}} < /ref >  However, [[fisherman]] in the [[Comoros Islands|Comoros islands]] had been catching it for a very long time and called it ''gombesa''. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 The coelacanths are the closest link between fish and the first [[amphibian]]s which made the transition from sea to land in the [[Devonian]] period (408–362 million years ago). Whereas the [[fishapod]]s lived near the [[shore]] in [[mud]]dy water, the coelacanths lived in open water. The modern species are [[predator]]s that live in the deep ocean. 
 
 === ''Latimeria'' === 
 ''Latimeria'' is the only living [[genus]] of the otherwise [[fossil]] coelacanth fish. It is probably the best-known [[Lazarus taxon]]. That such a creature could have been unrecorded for so long is rare, but perhaps the cold depths of the West Indian ocean (in which the Coelacanth lives), and the few predators it has, may have helped the species survive. Its disgusting [[taste]] means that [[fishermen]] did not deliberately try to catch it, that is, before scientists started offering rewards. 
 
 The population living off [[Tanzania]] is threatened by [[Japan]]ese [[trawler]]s, but the fish is not edible. They are simply caught in [[trawl]]s by accident. More than 20 have died this way, and their total numbers cannot be large. < ref name= " tanzania1 " > [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,16937,1681745,00.html  " Dinosaur fish pushed to the brink by deep-sea trawlers " ] ''[[The Observer]]'' < /ref > < ref name= " tanzania2 " > [http://www.tnrf.org/node/7066  " Does Tanga need a new harbour at Mwambani Bay?

 ==== Scientific study ==== 
 ''Latimeria'' was first found by scientists in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the [[South Africa]]n port town of East London. She was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens. Another one was found off the Comoros islands in 1952. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  The largest specimen was about 1.8 metres (~6 & nbsp;ft).
