 '''Clothing''' are items used to cover the [[human body]]. [[Human]]s are the only [[animal]]s that wear clothing. During the many thousands of years between losing body hair and learning to make clothes, humans were [[Nudity|naked]]. < ref name= " naked " / >  Some native people in hot places continue to be naked in everyday life.  
 
 Clothing is worn where the human body needs protection; from the sun and dust in hot, dry countries lacking shade and from the cold and wet in [[temperate climate]]s. Clothing such as thick wool [[coat]]s and boots keeps the human body warm in very cold [[temperature]]s (such as in the [[arctic]]).  
 
 Clothing is also worn for decoration, as a [[fashion]]. People from different [[culture]]s wear different clothing, and have different beliefs and customs about what type of clothing should be worn. For many people, clothing is a status symbol. It helps people project an image. Often, clothing is a form of self-expression. Adults in different social or work situations present different views of themselves by the clothes they wear. Young people have an entirely different form of dress to express their personalities. Often people will simply follow popular fashion styles so that they will fit in. Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies.

 Clothing is usually made of [[fabric]] sewn together, but may also be animal skins. Each body part has a typical item of clothing. The [[torso]] can be covered by [[shirt]]s, [[arm]]s by sleeves, [[leg]]s by [[pants]] or [[skirt]]s, hands by [[glove]]s, feet by [[footwear]], and [[head]] by [[Hat|headgear]] or [[mask]]s. In cold climates, people also wear heavy, thick [[coat]]s such as [[overcoat]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 ==Origin of clothing== 
 There is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed, because it was [[Pre-history|prehistoric]] and clothing is perishable. One of the earliest that has been found is a [[cloak]] made of the [[fur]] of [[squirrel]]s, from a cave in Italy, dated to 23,000 years ago. < ref > {{cite book| first=Johannes | last=Hoops| publisher=Walter de Gruyter| year=2001| title=Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde| volume=19| page=239| isbn=9783110171631| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1URMz8B36oC}} < /ref >   
 
 Some estimates come from studying the biology of [[Louse#Lice_and_humans|lice]]. The body louse lives in clothing, and the last [[ancestor]] that it and head lice both had lived about 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing existed at that time. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser  &  Mark Stoneking |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |pages=1414–1417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |s2cid=15277254 |access-date=2013-02-02 |archive-date=2008-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " Mark Stoneking " > {{cite journal|url= https://utsouthwestern.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/erratum-molecular-evolution-of-pediculus-humanus-and-the-origin-o|last= Stoneking|first= Mark|title= Erratum: Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing (Current Biology 13:16 (pp. 1414-1417))|journal= Current Biology|date= 29 December 2004|volume= 14|issue= 24|page= 2309|doi= 10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|accessdate= March 24, 2008}} < /ref > < ref > [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/29.full  " ...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ...

 Some [[archeology|archeologists]] think [[Neanderthal]]s became extinct because they never invented the sewing needle, and were then unable to make fitted clothing or footwear to survive the extreme cold of the last ice age. 
 
 == Biblical Story of Clothing == 
 In the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Adam and Eve]] are created [[Nudity|naked]] but don’t know it until they eat a [[fruit]] that they’re not supposed to eat so they cover themselves with leaves. Then [[Names of God in Judaism|God]], sends them out of the [[Garden of Eden]] and He gives them [[clothing]] to wear.  
 
 == Things that are not clothing == 
 People often decorate their bodies with [[makeup]] or [[perfume]], and they also cut or change the hair on their heads and faces. They might also go in for [[body modification]]: [[tattoo]]s, [[scarification]]s, and [[body piercing]]s. But makeup and tattoos are not kinds of clothing. 
 
 Things that are carried and not worn, like [[wallet]]s, [[purse]]s, [[cane]]s, and [[umbrella]]s, are called [[accessories]], but they are not kinds of clothing, either. [[Jewelry]] and [[eyeglasses]] are also accessories that are put on the body. [[Nail polish]] is also put on the fingertips and can be interpreted as makeup.
