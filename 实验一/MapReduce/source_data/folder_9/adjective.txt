 An '''''adjective''''' is a word that describes a noun or pronoun.  [[Noun]]s are words that [[name]] a place, a person, a thing, or an idea. An adjective is a word that gives more information about the noun that goes with it. It is a [[part of speech]].  
 
 Often, the adjective is before the noun it describes.  Sometimes an adjective is not followed by a noun: 
 * The sky is '''blue.''' 
 * The joke she told was so '''nice''', I could not stop laughing all day. 
 
 * It is still an adjective, because we could have  " the blue sky " ,  " the funny joke " , and  " the crazy man " . The adjective is still describing the noun though they are not side by side. 
 * There is a '''tall''' man. 
 An adjective is a word that gives instant information about a noun to make a clear picture of the noun in the mind of the reader and create a feeling  to the writer. 
 
 == Comparative and superlative == 
 Sometimes there are different forms of the same adjective. If one joke makes a person laugh more than another joke, then that joke is '''funnier'''. This is called the [[comparative]] form.  The day that is colder than any other is the '''coldest''' day. This is the [[superlative]] form of  " cold " . Some adjectives need additional words when we want to compare them. For instance, one car may be '''cheaper''' than another, but the second car may be '''more reliable''' (we use  " more reliable " , instead of  " reliabler " ). Reliable means worthy of [[trustworthiness|trust]]. 
 
 The rule is: 
 
 For short adjectives ending in a [[consonant]] like  " cold, "   " black, "  or  " fast, "  one adds the [[suffix]] '''er''' to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example:  " The North Pole is colder than Florida. "  The greatest possible comparison is made by adding the suffix '''est'''. Example:  " The North Pole is the coldest place on the Earth. "  For long adjectives like intelligent, conscientious, comprehensive, one uses the word '''more''' to make a comparison of greater magnitude. Example:  " Children are more intelligent than adults. "   
 
 A [[superlative]] makes the greatest possible comparison.  One uses the word '''most'''. Example:  " She is the most conscientious person I have ever known. " 
 
 == Nouns as noun modifiers == 
 
 In the English language, it is possible for a noun to modify (describe) another noun. Example: take the noun  " angel "  and the noun  " face. "  Put them together and the result is  " angel face. "  The first noun is acting as an adjective, because it is giving us information about the second noun. 
 
 == Adjectives and adverbs == 
 Adjectives are words we use to describe the noun.  Simple words like  " warm "  and  " fat "  are adjectives commonly used in writing.  One can make [[adverb]]s from some adjectives by adding the suffix '''ly'''.  Example: take the adjective  " beautiful, "  the adverb is beautifully. One can do it the other way around: take an adverb like  " presumably, "  the adjective is  " presumable " .   " Presumable innocence "  means the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty. 
 
 The adjective  " guilty "  becomes the adverb  " guiltily "  and vice versa (the opposite), the adverb  " guiltily "  becomes the adjective  " guilty. "
