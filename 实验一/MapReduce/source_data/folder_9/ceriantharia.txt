 The '''tube-dwelling anemones''' (''Ceriantharia'') are a [[class (biology)|subclass]] of the [[Anthozoa]]. They resemble [[sea anemone]]s. Sea anemones have a base plate, tube-dwelling anemones do not.  
 
 Most tube-dwelling anemones reproduce [[sexual reproduction|sexually]].  About 100 [[species]] have been described; most live in a depth of less than {{convert|50|m}}. Unlike sea anemones, tube-dwelling anemones live in soft [[sediment]]s. The name  " tube-dwelling anemone "  comes from the fact that these animals build a tube out of the [[sand|sandy]] sediments. In the case of danger, they retract into the tube.
