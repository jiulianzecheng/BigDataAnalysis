 '''Nirodha''' is a Sanskrit word, which is also a concept used in [[Buddhism]]. It is one of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. It is the end of [[Dukkha|suffering]] and its causes. According to [[Thubten Chodron]], Nirodha is the final disappearance of all bad experiences and their causes in such a way that they can no longer occur again. < ref > Thubten Chodron.
