 '''Dextromethorphan''' ('''DXM''' or '''DM''') is a [[drug]]. It is used to prevent [[cough]]s in many [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[common cold|cold]] and cough medicines. Dextromethorphan can also be used for [[pain relief]] or for [[psychological]] conditions. It is sold in [[syrup]], [[tablet]], and [[throat lozenge|lozenge]] forms, manufactured under several different [[brand name]]s and [[generic]] labels. In its pure form, dextromethorphan is a white powder. 
 
 
 Turning on the [[Sigma-1 receptor]] is believed to be how dextromethorphan helps with a cough. Dextromethorphan also prevents [[serotonin]] and norepinephrine from being absorbed again in the brain. When too much is inside a person's body or when they have been using it as a recreational drug, it can cause [[dissociative]] [[Hallucination|hallucinations]], make a person [[Euphoria|feel good]], change how you feel things, and other things. It does this by doing the things said before but also by blocking [[glutamate]] from turning on [[NMDA receptors]] in the brain, much like how [[Ketamine]] and [[Phencyclidine]] work as well.
