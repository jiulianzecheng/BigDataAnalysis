{{distinguish|Telluride, Colorado}} 
 '''Telluride''' is an [[ion]]. [[Chemical compound]]s containing this ion are called '''tellurides'''. Examples are [[sodium telluride]] and [[hydrogen telluride]]. The chemical formula is Te < sup > 2- < /sup > . Tellurides are strong [[reducing agent]]s. Some tellurides are impure, making them weaker reducing agents. Tellurides are the main source of [[tellurium]] in the ground. It only exists at very high [[pH]]. At lower pH's, hydrogen telluride, HTe < sup > - < /sup > , is made. When it is [[acid]]ic (very low pH), [[hydrogen telluride]] gas is made.
