 The adjective  " dysgenics "  is the antonym of  " [[eugenics]] " . It was first used about 1915 by [[David Starr Jordan]]. He thought there might be dysgenic effects in [[World War I]]. < ref > ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' < /ref >  Jordan believed that healthy men were as likely to die in modern [[warfare]] as anyone else and that war killed only the physically healthy men of the populace whilst preserving the disabled at home. < ref name= " Jordan " > {{cite book| last = Jordan| first = David Starr| title = War and the breed: the relation of war to the downfall of nations | publisher = University Press of the Pacific| year= 2003|edition=Reprint| isbn = 978-1-4102-0900-9|location = Honolulu, Hawaii}} < /ref >
