 '''''Vegavis''''' is a [[genus]] of extinct [[bird]] that lived during the latest [[Upper Cretaceous]] of [[Antarctica]], some 66 million years ago (mya). Among modern birds, It is most closely related to [[duck]]s and [[goose|geese]] ([[Anatidae]]). < ref name= " clarkeetal2005 " > Clarke J.A.''et al'' 2005. Definitive fossil evidence for the extant avian radiation in the Cretaceous. ''Nature'', '''433''': 305-308. [http://www.digimorph.org/specimens/Vegavis_iaai/nature03150.pdf] < /ref > 
 The discovery shows that some of the major groups of bird alive today had already [[adaptive radiation|diversified]] in the [[Cretaceous]]. It has been hailed as the first definite physical [[proof]] that birds from some of the modern groups lived in the [[Mesozoic]]. < ref name= " clarkeetal2005 " / > 
 The ''Vegavis'' fossil specimen is held by the [[Museo de La Plata]], [[Argentina]]. The very delicate remains of one bird are embedded in rock. [[Tomography]] (CT) scans were used to get a clearer picture of the bone structure without damaging or destroying the fossil. < ref name= " clarkeetal2005 " / >
