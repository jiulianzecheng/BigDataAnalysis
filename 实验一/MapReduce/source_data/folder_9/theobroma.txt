 '''Theobroma''' is a [[genus]]. There are about 20 [[species]] in it. They are small [[tree]]s, [[native]] to the [[forest]]s of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. The name translates to ''food of the gods''. 
 
 Their [[family (biology|family]] is given as [[Sterculiaceae]] or sometimes as [[Malvaceae]]. 
 
 Some of these trees have [[eat|edible]] [[seed]]s.  Best known are perhaps the [[Cacao tree]], the [[source]] of [[cocoa]] and [[chocolate]]. Other well-known trees are [[Cupua√ßu]], and [[Theobroma bicolor|Mocambo]].  
 
 ''Theobroma'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[moth]]s of the genus ''[[Endoclita]]'' including ''E. chalybeatus'', ''E. damor'', ''E. hosei'' and ''E. sericeus''. The larva of another moth, ''[[Hypercompe|Hypercompe muzina]]'', feeds exclusively on ''Theobroma cacao''.
