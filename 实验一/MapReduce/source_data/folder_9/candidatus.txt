'''Candidatus'''  < ref > Latin for candidate of Roman office, named after the white gown worn by Roman senators < /ref >  is a term in the [[taxonomy]] ([[scientific classification]]) of [[bacteria]]. 
 
 It is a label put before the name of a bacterium which cannot be grown on an [[agar plate]] or in any other [[bacteriology]] culture. An example would be  " ''Candidatus'' [[Phytoplasma]] allocasuarinae " . < ref > Notice the ''Candidatus'' is italicised but the name is not. < /ref >  Candidatus status may be used when a species or genus is well studied but cannot be cultured. Nowadays much information is got by [[ribosome|16S ribosomal]] [[RNA]] [[sequence analysis]]. 
 
 == History == 
 For correct publication of a species, bacteria must be isolated, cultured, described, and deposited in a bacteriology culture collection. However, some bacteria require special [[tissue culture]] conditions and cannot be maintained in Bacteriology Culture Collections. This includes bacteria which live inside other organisms or cells. These include obligately intracellular [[pathogen]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s, insect symbionts, and populations from oceans or sludge.  
 
 In 1994, Murray and Schleifer published a taxonomic note. < ref > Murray R.G.E. and Schleifer K.H. 1994 Taxonomic notes: a proposal for recording the properties of putative taxa of procaryotes. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. '''44''', 174-176 < /ref >  They recommended that the new category of indefinite rank (Candidatus) be established for certain [[wikt:putative|putative]] taxa that could not be described in sufficient detail to warrant establishment of a new [[taxon]]. It was also recommended that a Candidatus list should be established in the ''International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology''. < ref > Murray R.G.E. and Schleifer K.H. 1995 [http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/1/186 ''Taxonomic note: Implementation of the provisional status Candidatus for incompletely described procaryotes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801142742/http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/1/186 |date=2009-08-01 }}; Int.

 According to the  " IRPCM Phytoplasma/[[Spiroplasma]] Working Team – Phytoplasma taxonomy group "  the abbreviation for Candidatus should be Ca. < ref > The IRPCM Phytoplasma/Spiroplasma Working Team – Phytoplasma taxonomy group: 'Candidatus Phytoplasma', a taxon for the wall-less, non-helical prokaryotes that colonize plant phloem and insects.
