 '''Lorsch''' is a small town in southwest [[Germany]] ({{convert|60|km|mi|1|lk=on|abbr=off}} south of [[Frankfurt am Main]]) in the Kreis [[Bergstraße Rural District|Bergstraße]] district of the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Hessen]]. More than 12,000 people live in the town. 
 
 It is the site of a [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]], which used to be one of the greatest centers of Carolingian art. Several [[Carolingian]] kings of Germany were buried there. The abbey is also famous for the [[Lorsch Codex]], which was produced there around the end of the 12th century. The abbey has been declared a [[World Heritage Site]]. The ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' identifies Lorsch as the birthplace of [[Siegfried]].
