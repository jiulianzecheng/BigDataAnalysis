 '''Pollination''' is part of [[sexual reproduction]] in [[plant]]s. It describes how the [[pollen]] grains get to the female parts of a plant. Pollen grains, which contain the male [[gamete]]s, need to get to where the female gamete(s) are. 
 
 What happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals. Each pollen grain is [[haploid]]: it has half of the [[DNA]] (genetic information) that is needed to make a new plant. During [[fertilization]] this combines with the DNA that is in the egg of the female part and a [[zygote]] is formed. In [[seed plant]]s a [[seed]] is started. 
 
 == Ways of pollinating == 
 In [[flowering plant]]s, pollen has to get from one flower to another. < ref > There are plants which are self-pollinated; and some which have no longer use sexual reproduction. < /ref >  There are two main ways that this can happen: by non-living things like wind or water, or by living things such as [[insect]]s or [[bird]]s. 
 
 * Maize and the wind 
 [[Maize]] (called [[corn]] in some parts of the world) is pollinated by [[wind]]. The male anthers let go of their pollen and it blows over to a nearby female flower on another corn plant. Most of the flowers are either male or female on a corn plant ([[monoecious]]), rather than both sexes in one flower ([[hermaphrodite]]). 
 
 Maize flowers have [[evolved]] (changed over time) to use wind for pollination. They do not need pretty [[petal]]s. The pollen is light so it can blow around, and the ends of the female parts (stigma) are fluffy to catch all the tiny pollen grains. 
 
 * Tomatoes and bees 
 With [[tomato]] plants, [[bee]]s move the pollen from the male parts of one flower ([[anther]]s), to the female parts of another flower ([[stigma]]). The bee moves between flowers as it collects the [[nectar]] that the flowers make. The bees take the nectar and some pollen back to their hive, and the tomato plants get to reproduce (make new tomato plants). 
 
 Because the tomato flowers have [[evolved]] to attract bees, they have spread-out petals and are white to human eyes (bees, like most insects, can see into the [[ultraviolet]] range as well as our visual range of [[wavelength]]s). The pollen is often stuck together in clumps called ''pollinia'', which in turn get stuck to the bee. Bees are extremely hairy, and carry tiny [[electric charge]]s which attract the pollen onto their bodies. Honey bees have special pollen baskets, usually on their rear legs; they groom the pollen off their bodies into these pockets. 
 
 Much of the pollen gets taken back to the nest or hive, where it is used as a source of [[protein]], most needed by the [[larva]]e. Some gets rubbed off on the next flower, where the female stigma is sticky. A [[pollen tube]] grows down to permit the male [[gamete]] to fertilize an egg and make a [[seed]]. 
 
 90% of flowering plants are pollinated by animals, and only 10% use [[wikt:abiotic|abiotic]] (non-living) pollination. Of these abiotic pollinations, 98% is done by wind and just 2% by water. < ref > [http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/pollinators/documents/factsheet_pollinator.pdf US Forest Department, Pollinator Factsheet] < /ref > 
 
 == What happens after pollination == 
 [[File:Angiosperm life cycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|250px|Angiosperm life cycle]] 
 
 What happens after pollination is fertilisation. In plants it is a ''double'' fertilisation in which two [[sperm]] cells fertilize [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the plant [[ovary]]. One of these is a normal fertilisation, which produces the [[embryo]]. The other is a unique kind of fertilisation which produces the seed [[endosperm]]. 
 
 The process begins when a [[pollen]] grain sticks to the [[stigma]] of the [[pistil]] (female reproductive structure). Then it [[germination|germinates]], and grows a long [[pollen tube]]. While this pollen tube is growing, a [[haploid]] cell travels down the tube behind the tube nucleus. This cell divides by [[mitosis]] into two haploid [[sperm]] cells. 
 
 As the pollen tube grows, it makes its way from the stigma, down the style and into the ovary. Here the pollen tube reaches the [[ovule]] and releases its contents (which include the sperm cells). One sperm makes its way to fertilize the egg cell, producing a diploid (2''n'') [[zygote]]. The second sperm cell fuses with two cell nuclei, producing a [[triploid]] (3''n'') cell. 
 
 As the [[zygote]] develops into an embryo, the triploid cell develops into the endosperm, which serves as the embryo's food supply. The ovary now will develop into a [[fruit]] and the ovule will develop into a [[seed]]. 
 [[File:Hibiscus syriacus Bombus ruderatus 1 Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bumblebee]] smothered with pollen in a [[hibiscus]] flower.]] 
 
 == Gymnosperms == 
 There is evidence that some [[gymnosperm]]s were insect-pollinated in the [[Triassic]] period, but pollination by animals is not the main method in this group. Most are wind-pollinated. Some gymnosperms and their insect pollinators are [[Co-evolution|co-evolved]] for pollination. The best-known examples are members of the order [[Cycad]]ales and their associated species of [[beetle]]. 
 
 == Families of flowering plants == 
 Really widespread and specialised animal pollination came with the [[Angiosperm]]s (flowering plants). Different families of flowering plants usually specialise in a particular pollination method. Sometimes a few [[genera]] shift from one method to another. < ref > Stebbins, G. Ledyard 1974. ''Flowering plants: evolution above the species level''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-30685-6}} < /ref > < sup > p53 < /sup > 
 *[[Ranunculaceae]]: pollinated by insects. Only one genus is pollinated by wind. 
 *[[Compositae]] ([[Asteraceae]]): this, the largest family, is almost entirely pollinated by insects. Two groups of genera have changed to wind pollination. 
 *[[Cyperaceae]]: almost entirely wind-pollinated. One genus is insect-pollinated. 
 *[[Moraceae]]: this, the [[mulberry]] family, is the best example of a widespread change from wind to insect pollination. All its related families ([[Ulmaceae]], [[Cannabaceae]], [[Urticaceae]]) are wind pollinated.  
 *[[Gramineae]] ([[Poaceae]]): the grasses have extreme [[adaptation]]s for wind pollination. Only two genera have changed to insect pollination. 
 
 == Pollination syndrome == 
 Pollination syndrome is the set of [[adaptive]] [[Trait (biology)|traits]] which help flowers to get pollinated. 
 
 === Wind pollination === 
 Wind pollinated flowers are usually small and inconspicuous (not showy). They do not have a [[scent]] or produce [[nectar]]. The [[anther]]s may produce a large number of [[pollen]] grains, while the [[stamen]]s are generally long and stick up out of the flower. Their [[stigma]]s may be large and feathery to catch the pollen grains. Insects may visit them to collect pollen; there are some examples of flowers which are both wind and insect pollinated. 
 
 === Animal pollination === 
 ;Beetle pollination 
 [[Beetle]]-pollinated flowers are usually large, greenish or off-white in color and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to [[decay]]ing organic material. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish shaped, with pollen easy to get at. They may have traps to keep the beetle longer. The plant's ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of the beetles. < ref name= " Gullan2005 " > P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston 2005. ''The Insects: an outline of entomology''.

 ;Fly pollination 
 [[File:Aasblume Aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sapromyophilous ''[[Stapelia]] [[Stapelia gigantea|gigantea]]'']] 
 Some flies feed on nectar and pollen as adults (particularly [[Bee fly|bee flies]] and [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]]). The flowers they visit often have a strong scent, and tend to be purple, violet, blue, and white. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Kastinger C, and A Weber |year=2001 |title=Bee-flies (Bombylius spp., Bombyliidae, Diptera) and the pollination of flowers |journal=Flora |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=3–25|doi=10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30015-4 }} < /ref > 
 
 On the other hand, male [[Tephritidae|fruit flies]] are attracted to some wild [[orchid]]s which do not produce nectar. Instead, they produce a [[wikt:precursor|precursor]] of the fly's sex [[pheromone]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Tan, KH and R Nishida |year=2000 |title=Mutual reproductive benefits between a wild orchid, ''Bulbophyllum patens'', and ''Bactrocera'' fruit flies via a floral synomone. |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=26 |issue=2 | pages=533–546 |doi=10.1023/A:1005477926244|s2cid=24971928 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Tan, KH, LT Tan and R Nishida |year=2006 |title= Floral phenylpropanoid cocktail and architecture of Bulbophyllum vinaceum orchid in attracting fruit flies for pollination. |journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology |volume=32| pages=2429–2441 |doi= 10.1007/s10886-006-9154-4 |pmid=17082990 |issue=11|s2cid=15812115 }} < /ref >  Flies which normally visit dead animals or [[feces|dung]] are attracted to flowers that mimic these smelly items. They get no reward and would quickly leave, but the plant may have traps to slow them down.

 Their sheer numbers and the presence of some flies throughout the year make them important pollinators for many plants. < ref name=Gullan2005/ >  Flies tend to be important pollinators in high-[[altitude]]s and high-[[latitude]]s where they are numerous, and other insect groups may be lacking. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.4039/Ent133439-4 |author=Larson BMH, PG Kevan, and DW Inouye |year=2001 |title=Flies and flowers: taxonomic diversity of anthophiles and pollinators |journal=Canadian Entomologist |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=439–465|s2cid=55767580 }} < /ref > 
 
 ;Bee pollination 
 [[Bee]]-pollinated flowers tend to be yellow or blue, often with [[ultraviolet]] nectar guides and [[scent]]. Nectar and/or pollen are offered as rewards in varying amounts. The sugar in the nectar tends to be mostly [[sucrose]]. There are different types of bees which differ in size, [[tongue]] length and behaviour (some solitary, some colonial). < ref name= " Fenster2004 " > {{cite journal |author=Fenster C.B. |display-authors = etal |year=2004 |title=Pollination syndromes and floral specialization | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=375–403 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132347}} < /ref >  Some plants can only be pollinated by bees because their anthers release pollen internally, and it must be shaken out by buzzing ( " sonication " ). Bumblebees are the only animals that do this. 
 
 Bee pollination from mobile [[beehive]]s is of great economic value for [[orchard]]s such as [[apple]] or [[almond]]. 
 
 ;Wasp pollination 
 Wasps are also responsible for the pollination of several plants species, being important pollen [[vector]]s and, in some cases, even more efficient pollinators than bees. < ref > Sühs, R.B. ''et al'' 2009. Pollen vector wasps (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae), Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil. ''Brazilian Journal of Biosciences'' '''7''', 2, 138-143.

 ;Lepidoptera pollination 
 [[Butterfly]]-pollinated flowers tend to be large and showy, pink or [[lavender]] in colour, often have a landing area, and are usually scented. Since butterflies do not [[digestion|digest]] pollen (with one exception), more nectar is offered than pollen. The flowers have simple nectar guides with the nectaries usually hidden in narrow tubes or spurs, reached by the long tongue of the butterflies. 
 
 [[File:Yucca whipplei flower.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Hesperoyucca whipplei'' (moth-pollinated)]] 
 Among the more important [[moth]] pollinators are the [[hawk moth]]s ([[Sphingidae]]). Their behaviour is similar to [[hummingbird]]s: they hover in front of flowers with rapid wingbeats. Most are [[nocturnal]] or [[twilight]] feeders. So moth-pollinated flowers tend to be white, night-opening, large and showy with tubular [[petal|corolla]]s and a strong, sweet scent produced in the evening, night or early morning. A lot of nectar is produced to fuel the high [[metabolic rate]]s needed to power their flight. 
 
 Other moths fly slowly and settle on the flower. They do not need as much nectar as the fast-flying hawk moths, and the flowers tend to be small (though they may be aggregated in heads). < ref > {{cite journal |author=Oliveira PE, PE Gibbs, and AA Barbosa |year=2004 |title=Moth pollination of woody species in the Cerrados of Central Brazil: a case of so much owed to so few? |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=245 |issue=1–2 |pages=41–54 |doi=10.1007/s00606-003-0120-0|s2cid=21936259 }} < /ref > 
 
 ;Bird pollination 
 [[Hummingbird]]s are the most familiar nectar-feeding [[bird]]s for [[North America]]ns, there are analogous species in other parts of the world. < ref name= " Lotz2006 " > {{cite journal |author=Lotz, CN and JE Schondube |year=2006 |title=Sugar preferences in nectar- and fruit-eating birds: behavioral patterns and physiological causes |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_biotropica_2006-01_38_1/page/3 |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=3–15}} < /ref > < ref name= " Lotz2006 "  / >  Flowers attractive to hummingbirds, which hover in front of the flower, tend to be large red or orange tubes with a lot of dilute nectar produced during the day. Since birds do not have a strong response to scent, they tend to be odourless. Perching birds need a substantial landing platform, so sunbirds, honeyeaters, and the like are less associated with tubular flowers. 
 
 ;Bat pollination 
 [[File:Adansonia digitata 20050823 flower.png|thumb|right|200px|African [[baobab]] (bat-pollinated)]] 
 
 [[Bat]]-pollinated flowers tend to be large and showy, white or light coloured, open at night and have strong odours. They are often large and bell-shaped. Bats drink the nectar, and these plants typically offer nectar for long periods. Sight, smell, and [[echo-location]] are used to initially find the flowers, and excellent spatial memory is used to visit them repeatedly. < ref name= " Von2003 " > {{cite journal |author=Von Helversen D, MW Holderied, and O Von Helversen |year=2003 |title=Echoes of bat-pollinated bell-shaped flowers: conspicuous for nectar-feeding bats? |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |issue=6 |pages=1025–1034 |url=https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/206/6/1025/14053/Echoes-of-bat-pollinated-bell-shaped-flowers |doi=10.1242/jeb.00203 |format=abstract page |pmid=12582145|s2cid=21891529 }} < /ref >  In fact, bats can identify nectar-producing flowers using echolocation. < ref name= " Von2003 "  / > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Pettersson S, F Ervik, and JT Knudsen |year=2004 |title=Floral scent of bat-pollinated species: West Africa vs. the New World |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=161–168 |url=http://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1095-8312.2004.00317.x |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2004.00317.x}} < /ref >  Bat-pollinated plants have bigger pollen than their relatives. < ref > {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00984104 |author=Stroo, A. |year=2000 |title=Pollen morphological evolution in bat pollinated plants |journal=Plant Systematics and Evolution |volume=222 |issue=1–4 |pages=225–242|s2cid=42391364 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Honey guides === 
 [[File:Mimulus nectar guide UV VIS.jpg|thumb|right|220px| Images of a ''Mimulus'' flower in visible light (left) and ultraviolet light (right) showing a dark nectar guide that is visible to bees but not to humans.]] 
 
 Honey guides, nectar guides or floral guides are markings on flowers which tell insects where to go for nectar (many insects can see in the [[ultraviolet]] range). Most of these guides are invisible to humans unless seen in ultraviolet light. The benefit to the plant is that the guides increase the supply of pollinators at a relatively low cost. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:Christian-Konrad-Sprengel 0118 a.jpg|thumb|right|Sprengel remembered: a small [[plaque]] designed after the [[frontispiece]] of his book is in the [[Berlin]] Botanical Gardens.]] 
 A full understanding of pollination is quite recent. 
 
 In 1672 [[Nehemiah Grew]] had some idea that pollen was the means of fertilisation in higher plants. < ref > Grew, Nehemiah 1672. ''Anatomy of plants''. London. < /ref >  Using a [[microscope]], he was the first to describe pollen in detail. This led to the discovery that all pollen grains in a species were alike. < ref > {{cite journal | last=Manten | first=A.A. | title=Lennart von post and the foundation of modern palynology | journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology | volume=1 | year=1967 | issue=1–4 | pages=11–22 | doi=10.1016/0034-6667(67)90105-4| hdl=1874/15873 | s2cid=53000751 }} < /ref >  The study of pollen grains is called palynology. It is much used in [[micropaleontology]]. Sex in plants was discovered in 1694, when [[Rudolf Camerarius]] put his discovery into a letter. < ref > Evaluation in Sachs, Julius 1890. ''History of Botany (1530{{ndash}}1860)'' Oxford University Press, 359{{ndash}}444. < /ref > 
 
 In 1793 [[Christian Sprengel]] (1750–1816) published a work on the pollination of flowers by insects which made all the main points. < ref > Sprenglel C.K. 1793. ''Das neu entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur in Bau und Befructung der Blumen''. Berlin. < /ref >  Unfortunately,  " his work was so far outside the standard thinking and interests of the period that it was almost completely ignored " . < ref > Mayr, Ernst 1982.

 Two lines of work solved the main issues. One was done by studies of how the pollen cells worked to fertilise the ovum, < ref > Hughes A. 1959. ''A history of cytology''. London  &  New York: Abelard-Schuman, 59–60 < /ref >  and the other was to recognise the coevolution of the animal pollinators and the flowering plants. < ref > Darwin Charles 1859.
