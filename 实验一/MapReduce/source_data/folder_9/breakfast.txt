 '''Breakfast''' is the first [[meal]] of the [[day]]. It is usually eaten in the [[morning]]. The word comes from two other words;  " [[:wikt:broken|break]] "  ( " end " ) and [[Fasting|fast]] ( " not eating for a long time " ). 
 
 Definition: [1463] from break (v.) + fast (n.). Cf. Fr. d√©jeuner  " to breakfast, "  from L. dis-jejunare  " to break the fast. " 
 
 People around the [[world]] eat different things for breakfast: 
 
 * In the [[United States]], people usually eat [[Pancake|pancakes]], [[Waffle|waffles]], [[toast]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]] or [[Bagel|bagels]] for breakfast. 
 * In [[Canada]], people usually eat [[Bacon|maple cured bacon]], fried [[Potato|potatoes]], maple-infused beans, eggs, [[toast]], pancakes and maple syrup or hot oatmeal for breakfast. 
 
 * In the [[United Kingdom]] a large breakfast was often, and still is sometimes, served. Usually this would be [[bread]], [[tea]], [[Egg (food)|egg]], [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[fruit]]s, [[baked beans]] on [[toast]] and sometimes [[vegetable]]s. This pattern of heavy eating has greatly changed in recent years. Most people do not do manual work nowadays. < ref > Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine 2006. ''The Oxford companion to food''. Oxford University Press. < /ref > 
 * In [[France]], people usually eat a very light meal; often [[bread]] and [[coffee]] with [[milk]]. Again, this depends on what kind of work is done (usually by the father of the household). 
 * In [[Asia]], most people eat [[rice]] instead of bread. They also sometimes eat [[porridge]].
