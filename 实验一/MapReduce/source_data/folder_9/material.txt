 '''Material''' is what everything that you can touch is made of. Even material that is too small to touch, is called material. We use materials to make things. We can also call material  " physical [[substance]] < nowiki/ > s. " 
 
 ''Raw'' material is materials such as [[ore]]s which we can clean and mix with other materials to make another material like steel, for example. [[Cotton]] is a raw material used to make [[textile]] < nowiki/ > s, which are used to make [[clothes]]. Material is not [[matter]], though. Matter is everything in existence. Material is used for things that have use. Refined materials are materials that have been [[Refinery|refined]], like metal, reduced or converted into better, more useful materials like clothes and tools. Refined materials are usually mixes of other materials, like glue or steel.
