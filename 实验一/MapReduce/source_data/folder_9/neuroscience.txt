'''Neuroscience''' (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is the branch of [[biology]] which investigates every aspect of the [[brain]] and [[nervous system]]. 
 
 The nervous system is made of billions of [[neuron]]s connected together and to other systems in the body.  The central nervous system includes the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]] and [[retina]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44627256|title=Neuroscience|date=2001|publisher=Sinauer Associates|others=Purves, Dale., Williams, S.
