 '''Kasabian''' is a British [[Rock music|rock]] band. It was formed by Tom Meighan ([[singer]]), Sergio Pizzorno (backing vocal and [[Guitarist|guitar]]), [[bassist]] Chris Edwards and guitarist Chris Karloff in 1997. Then it was called Saracuse. Ian Matthews and Jay Mehler joined the band after the departure of Chris Karloff in 2006. Jay joined [[Liam Gallagher]]'s band [[Beady Eye]] in 2013 and was replaced by Tim Carter. They have recorded four albums, ''Kasabian'', ''Empire'', ''West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum'' and ''Velociraptor!'', and are working on the fifth. 
 
 They mostly get their inspiration from [[Primal Scream]]. They got a lot of influence from the [[Stone Roses]]. They use a little electro sound joined with a bass groove mixed in a rock template.
