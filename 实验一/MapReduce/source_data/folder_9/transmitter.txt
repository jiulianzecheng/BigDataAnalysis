 In [[electronics]], a '''transmitter''' is a device which sends signals using [[radio wave]]s. 
 
 The transmitter converts [[direct current]] (DC) into [[alternating current]] (AC) at the desired frequency. Most transmitters use a [[quartz]] crystal to set the frequency of the resulting carrier wave. A [[modulator]] modifies the carrier wave, by [[frequency modulation]] or [[amplitude modulation]] or some other kind, to include the information needed, such as an audio or video signal. The modified waves are sent by an antenna to another antenna at the receiver which extracts the information from the waves.
