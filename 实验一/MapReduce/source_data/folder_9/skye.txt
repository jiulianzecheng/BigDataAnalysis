 The Black Cuillin, low mountains mainly composed of [[basalt]] and [[gabbro]], include 12 peaks the Scots call 'Munros'. This is some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain terrain in Scotland. The ascent of [[Sgùrr a' Ghreadaidh]] is one of the longest rock climbs in Britain and the [[Inaccessible Pinnacle]] is the only peak in Scotland that requires technical climbing skills to reach the summit. < ref name=Smith/ > < ref > [http://www.skyewalk.co.uk/innpinn.shtml  " Sgurr Dearg and the In Pinn " ] skyewalk.co.uk.
