 [[File:Manganate.jpg|thumb|Solution of unknown manganate, probably potassium manganate]] 
 '''Manganate''' normally means the MnO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup >  [[ion]]. It is a bright green ion. It is made during the making of [[permanganate]]s. It is a weak [[reducing agent]] and moderate [[oxidizing agent]]. They are similar to the [[sulfate]] (SO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > ) and [[chromate]] (CrO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2- < /sup > ) ions. [[Potassium manganate]] is an example.
