{{Distinguish2|[[free software]], which means software that respects users' freedom}} 
 
 '''Freeware''' is [[software]] that people may get without paying for it. In this case,  " free "  means  " free of charge " . In freeware, users might not be allowed to customize or share the software or [[source code]] with others.  This leaves the author with more control than with [[free software]].
