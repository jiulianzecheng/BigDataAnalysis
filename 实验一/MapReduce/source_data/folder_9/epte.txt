 The '''Epte''' is a [[river]] in [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], in [[Normandy]], [[France]]. It is a [[tributary]] of the river [[Seine]]. It begins in Seine-Maritime [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Pays de Bray]], near [[Forges-les-Eaux]].  The river empties into the [[Seine]] not far from [[Giverny]]. < ref > Robert I C Fisher; Linda Dannenberg; et al, ''Fodor's 2012 France'' (New York: Fodor's Travel Pub, 2012), p. 292 < /ref > 
 
 In 911 the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]] established the river as the historical boundary between Normandy and [[Île-de-France]]. This divided the traditional county of the [[Vexin]] into two parts. The Norman Vexin became a part of Normandy while the French Vexin remained a part of the Île-de-France. A series of castles were built on both banks of the Epte to guard this frontier. < ref > Peter Fraser Purton, ''A history of the early medieval siege, c.450-1200'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2009), p. 254 < /ref >   
 
 [[Claude Monet]] lived at Giverny near the river for more than forty years. < ref > Claire Joyes; Claude Monet, ''Claude Monet : life at Giverny'' (New York: Vendome Press, 1985), ''[[:en:wikt:passim|passim]]'' < /ref >   In his garden, by diverting a branch of the Epte, he established a [[Water gardens|water garden]] with its famous [[Aquatic plant|water-lily pond]] and a Japanese-style [[Footbridge|bridge]]. The river appears in several of his [[:wikt:works|works]], including ''Peupliers au bord de l'Epte'' (Poplars on the Banks of the Epte).
