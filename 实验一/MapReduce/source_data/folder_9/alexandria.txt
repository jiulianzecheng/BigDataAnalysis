 == History == 
 Alexandria, named after [[Alexander the Great]], was founded around 331 BC. For nearly 300 years, it was the [[capital (city)|capital]] of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in Egypt. Some famous [[ancient Greek]] [[scientist]]s, such as [[Euclid of Alexandria]] and [[Eratosthenes]], lived there or studied there. It was home to the largest library in the ancient [[Western world]], the [[Library of Alexandria]].  
 
 It was a wealthy city in its heyday, and remained the main way Egyptian grain went by sea to [[Ancient Rome]]. Rome depended greatly on Egyptian grain. Much of Alexandria sank below the sea in the [[4th century]]. Some of her history is in the Mediterranean. 
 
 After the [[Muslim]] conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, they did not want to have their capital at Alexandria, because it was too vulnerable to naval raids. They made a new capital, much farther upriver, on the east side of the [[Nile]], and called it [[Fustat]]. Alexandria became less important.
