'''Scaphism''' or '''The Boats''' was a method of execution where the condemned was sandwiched between two [[canoe]]s or halves of a [[log]], force fed [[milk]] and [[honey]] and be left in the middle of a stagnant body of water. The victim was also covered in the milk and honey and generally stripped naked. The smell of this cocktail and the inevitable excrement attracted [[insect]]s and other [[vermin]] to devour the body.
