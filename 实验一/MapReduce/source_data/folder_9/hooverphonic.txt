 '''Hooverphonic''' are a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[rock (music)|rock]]/[[pop music|pop]]  group, formed in [[1995]]. The band first called themselves ''Hoover''. The band was composed from [[Alex Callier]], the leader and the guitarrist, [[Ester Lybeert]], the singer, [[Frank Duchene]], the keyboarder, and from the bassist [[Raymond Geerts]]. Later they changed their name to ''Hooverphonic'' after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name.
