In [[chemistry]], an '''additive''' is a [[substance]] that is added to a [[mixture]] or [[Chemical compound|compound]] to change the properties of that mixture or compound. [[Food additive]]s are used to improve [[food]]. 
 '''Additive properties''' depend on the total contribution of the atoms in the molecule or on the sum of the properties of the components in a solution (molecular weight, mass of a solution).
