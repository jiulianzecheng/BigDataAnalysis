 '''Telecommunication''' (from two words, ''tele'' meaning 'from far distances' and ''communication'' meaning to share information) is the assisted transmission of [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] over a distance for the purpose of [[communication]]. In earlier times, this may have involved the use of smoke signals, [[drum]]s, [[Semaphore line|semaphore]], [[flag signals|flags]], or a [[mirror]] to flash [[sunlight]]. Starting with the [[telegraph]], telecommunication typically involves the use of [[Electronics|electronic]] transmitters such as the [[telephone]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[optical fiber]] and [[computer]].
