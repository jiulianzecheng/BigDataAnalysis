 '''''Achillobator''''' is a [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] theropod dinosaur from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] of what is now [[Mongolia]]. It lived about 90 million years ago.  
 
 It was probably an active [[predator]], hunting with the large sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each foot. It was a large dromaeosaurid: the first and only individual specimen found is estimated at being 5 meters (17 feet) long. The name comes from [[Achilles]], a famous ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek]] warrior of the [[Trojan War]]. It refers to the large [[Achilles tendon]] needed to use the sickle claw on the foot, which was the major weapon of dromaeosaurids. The one [[species]] is named ''A. giganticus'' because it is much larger than other dromaeosaurids.
