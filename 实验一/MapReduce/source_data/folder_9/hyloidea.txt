 == Shared Characteristics of Hyloidea == 
 Hyloidea is the largest superfamily of anurans due to scientists placing frogs into this family when the relationships to others are unknown. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  Therefore, Hyloidea has the highest species diversity. Hyloidea are all tailless, have shortened bodies, large mouths and muscular hind legs. Most anurans in the superfamily have a lateral‐bender which is a type of pelvis morphology found in walking, hopping and burrowing frogs. Some species that appear later in the taxon have a sagittal‐hinge pelvis found in aquatic frogs as well as walking, hopping and burrowing frogs  and some have a fore–aft slider pelvis found in terrestrial frogs. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Hyloidea anurans lack ribs, have complex mouthparts, and their pectoral girdle can be arciferal or firmisternal. < ref name= " Duellman " > {{cite web |last1=Duellman |first1=W.E. |title=Anura |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/Anura |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=26 February 2021}} < /ref >  They reproduce via axillary amplexus, and their larvae usually have a single spiracle. The average snout-vent length (SVL) of Hyloidea species vary widely, from 10 mm in one species of ''Diasporus'' to 320 mm in female ''Calyptocephalella gayi''. < ref name= " Vitt " > {{cite book |last1=Vitt |first1=Laurie |last2=Caldwell |first2=Janalee |title=Herpetology: an introductory biology of amphibians and reptiles |date=2014 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-386919-7 |page=481,499 |edition=4}} < /ref >   
 
 == Phylogenic relationships == 
 Anuran animals, frogs and toads, look alike from the outside, so scientists cannot always tell them apart by looking at their morphological characteristics. They use DNA testing to tell which species are related to each other and how. [[ML analysis]] and [[Bayesian analysis]] are two important ways to do this.  Scientists used them with a nuclear marker toolkit to look at the relationships inside the superfamily Hyloidea on a molecular level.  As they tested 55 relationships of the Hyloidea and was found that 53 out of the 55 previously established nodes on the phylogenetic tree were supported by this DNA testing. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Jorgensen|first1=M.

 == Distribution == 
 Scientists say the first Hyloidea animals evolved on the [[Gondwanaland|Gondwanan supercontinent]] in what is now southern South America, then spread throughout the world. < ref name= " Streicher 2018 " > {{cite journal |last1=Streicher |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Miller |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Guerrero |first3=Pablo |last4=Correa |first4=Claudio |last5=Ortiz |first5=Juan |last6=Crawford |first6=Andrew |last7=Pie |first7=Marcio |last8=Wiens |first8=John |title=Evaluating methods for phylogenomic analyses, and a new phylogeny for a major frog clade (Hyloidea) based on 2214 loci. |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |date=February 2018 |volume=119 |pages=128–143 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2017.10.013|pmid=29111477 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Fouquet 2013 " > {{cite journal |last1=Fouquet |first1=Antoine |last2=Blotto |first2=Boris |last3=Maronna |first3=Maximiliano |last4=Verdade |first4=Vanessa |last5=Junca |first5=Flora |last6=de Sá |first6=Rafael |last7=Rodrigues |first7=Miguel |title=Unexpected phylogenetic positions of the genera Rupirana and Crossodactylodes reveal insights into the biogeography and reproductive evolution of leptodactylid frogs |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |date=May 2013 |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2013.02.009|pmid=23454092 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  Today, they live on every continent except Antarctica. In 2020, scientists found a fossilized animal that was roughly 40 million year old.

 == Conservation == 
 As of February 2021, the IUCN Red List named 361 of the species in Hyloidea as critically endangered (11.4%), 475 as endangered (15%), and 310 as vulnerable (9.8%).  There are 3161 species in Hyloidea. < ref name= " IUCN " > {{cite web |title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/ |website=IUCN Red List |access-date=26 February 2021}} < /ref >  One of the most important reasons Hyloidea species are dying is because human beings build farms and other things in the places where they live.  This is called [[habitat loss]]. < ref name= " IUCN "  / >
