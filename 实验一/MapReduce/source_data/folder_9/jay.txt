 The '''jays''' are several [[species]] of medium-sized, usually colorful and noisy [[bird]]s in the [[crow]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Corvidae]]. < ref > The names ''jay'' and ''[[magpie]]'' are somewhat interchangeable, and the actual evolutionary relationships are rather complex. For example, the [[Eurasian magpie]] seems more closely related to the [[Eurasian jay]] than to the Oriental [[Urocissa|Blue]] and [[Cissa|Green magpies]], whereas the [[Blue jay]] is not closely related to either. < /ref >
