 '''Gondwanatheria''' is an extinct group of [[mammal]]s that lived during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] to the [[Miocene]]. They lived in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] continents which had been part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. < ref > Krause D.W. and others 2020.

 These mammals are known only from isolated [[teeth]] and a few lower [[jaw]]s. Because of these fragmentary remains, their relationships are unclear. Later finds have improved our knowledge of them. < ref name= " CNN-20201218 " > {{cite news |last=Strickland |first=Ashley |title=This 'crazy beast' was a weird early mammal that lived among dinosaurs |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/18/world/crazy-beast-fossil-mammal-scn-trnd/index.html |date=18 December 2020 |work=CNN News |access-date=18 December 2020 }} < /ref >  It was thought previously that [[climate change]]s at the Eocene & ndash;[[Oligocene]] boundary had caused their [[extinction]]. < ref > Reguero M.A., Sergio A.M. and Santillana S.N. 2002.

 [[Fossil]]s have come from [[South America]], [[India]] and [[Antarctica]], where gondwanatherids lived in the lush [[forest]]s which once covered much of the world.
