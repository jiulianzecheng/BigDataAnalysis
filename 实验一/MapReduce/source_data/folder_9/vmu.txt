The '''Sega Dreamcast VMU''' is a [[memory card]] made just for the [[Sega Dreamcast]] machine that plays [[video game]]s. It is put in slot one or two on the Sega Dreamcast controller. It can save games, backgrounds and other extra features for the Sega Dreamcast. Also, it can save minigames that can be played on the remote itself running on a battery using D-pad, A, B, start, and select buttons. The games are shown on a small screen on the controller. (This screen usually shows [[picture]]s and game [[statistics]] when playing on the Dreamcast).
