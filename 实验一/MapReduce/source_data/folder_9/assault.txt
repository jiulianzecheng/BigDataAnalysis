An '''assault''' is when a person [[wikt:attack|attacks]] another. In [[law]], it is considered a [[crime]] or [[tort]]. In [[common law]], it is when somebody [[threat]]ens or tries to physically [[wikt:hurt|hurt]] someone else. < ref > {{cite web|title=Definition of Assault|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Assault.aspx|work=Duhaime Legal Dictionary|access-date=18 December 2013|archive-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219030003/http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Assault.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   In order to be considered ''assault'', the act must involve the ability to cause the harm. It does not necessarily have to involve [[touch]]ing the other person; that is called ''[[Battery (tort)|battery]]''. In [[criminal law]], an assault can be an attempted but unsuccessful battery. In some states or [[legal code]]s, the words  " assault "  and  " battery "  may mean the same thing. 
 
 There are several different kinds of assault. Each legal system has their own definitions. 
 
 A stronger form of assault is ''aggravated assault''. This usually involves using a [[weapon]] that could easily be used to kill someone. < ref > {{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}} < /ref >
