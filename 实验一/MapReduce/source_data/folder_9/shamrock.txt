 '''Shamrocks''' are the young [[wikt:sprig|sprigs]] of [[clover]] or trefoil. The shamrock is a symbol of [[Ireland]]. According to a legend, [[Saint Patrick]] used it to illustrate the [[doctrine]] of the [[Holy Trinity]]. The name ''shamrock'' is  derived from [[Irish language|Irish]] ''{{lang|ga|seamr√≥g}}''. This is the [[diminutive]] version of the Irish word for [[clover]] (''{{lang|ga|seamair}}'') meaning simply '' " little clover " '' or '' " young clover " ''. < ref > Nelson, E. Charles,  ''Shamrock: Botany and History of an Irish Myth'', Boethius Press, 1991, isbn 0-86314-199-4, p. 14 < /ref >  Sometimes other three-leafed plants are called shamrocks. The shamrock can be used for its medicinal properties. It was used as a motif in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] days. Around March 17 ([[Saint Patrick's Day]]) small pots of shamrocks are sold. Some people wear sprigs of shamrock in a buttonhole on the holiday.
