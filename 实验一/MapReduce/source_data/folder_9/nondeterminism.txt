 In [[computer science]], a '''nondeterministic algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that does not give the same result each time it is used. 
 
 Even for the same input, it may show different behaviors on different runs. This may be contrasted with a deterministic algorithm. 
 The projection of an automaton almost always results in nondeterminism. 
 
 Exhibiting nondeterminism; involving choices between indistinguishable possibilities. 
 
 Being nondeterministic; involving arbitrary choices; necessitating the choice between various indistinguishable possibilities. 
 
 Dependence on factors other than initial state and input. 
 
 Moving from a single-processor to a multi-processor system often exposes hidden nondeterminism due to invalid assumptions about scheduling.   
 
 There are several ways an algorithm may behave differently from run to run. Referring to the inability to objectively predict an outcome or result of a process due to lack of knowledge of a cause and effect relationship or the inability to know initial conditions. 
 
 '''Non-deterministic definitions'''  
 
 Non-predictive. Referring to the inability to objectively predict an outcome or result of a process due to lack of knowledge of a cause and effect relationship or the inability to know initial conditions. 
 
 In telecommunications switching and routing, the unpredictability of a path between nodes. See also node, path, route, and switch.
