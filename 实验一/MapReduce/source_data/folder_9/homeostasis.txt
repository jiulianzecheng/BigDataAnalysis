 Homeostasis is life's ability to stay balanced, when the environment changes. Animals keep their body in a stable condition. They do so by [[wikt:regulation|regulating]] their inner [[equilibrium]]. For example, they adjust their [[pH]], [[temperature]], amount of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood and so on. In living things, the study of how they keep in a stable condition is called [[physiology]]. Mostly, our physiology works [[unconscious]]ly throughout life. We have many [[negative feedback]] systems which adjust our physiology so that we stay alive. < ref > Widmaier E.P; Raff H.  &  Strang K.T. 2009.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. < /ref >  These systems are self-organising and do not need to be learnt. They are [[Heritability|inherited]]. 
 
 The concept was described by [[Claude Bernard]], < ref > Bernard C. 1974. ''Lectures on the phenomena common to animals and plants''. Trans Hoff HE, Guillemin R, Guillemin L, Springfield (IL): Charles C Thomas. {{ISBN|978-0-398-02857-2}} < /ref >  and the term was later coined by [[Walter Cannon]] in 1926, < ref > Cannon W.B 1926.

''... aber vom Menschen wissen wir nichts'', English title ''Robots, Men and Minds'', translated by Dr. Hans-Joachim Flechtner. Econ Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf, Wien, p115. < /ref >  Walter Cannon thought these were the features of homeostasis: < ref name=Cannon/ > 
 :#Constancy in an open system, such as our bodies, is done by mechanisms which maintain this constancy. Cannon based this on insights into the ways by which steady states such as [[glucose]] concentrations, [[body temperature]] and [[acids and bases|acid-base]] balance were regulated. 
 :#To keep a steady-state condition, any change automatically meets with factors that resist change. An increase in blood [[salt]] results in [[thirst]] as the body attempts to dilute the concentration of salt in the extracellular fluid. 
 :#The regulating system doing homeostasis has a number of cooperating mechanisms which act simultaneously or successively. [[Blood sugar]] is regulated by [[insulin]], glucagons, and other hormones that control its release from the liver or its uptake by the tissues. 
 
 Examples of homeostasis: 
 * The operation of a [[thermostat]] 
 * The regulation of water and minerals in the body  
 * The regulation of [[body temperature]]: mammals and [[bird]]s have complicated systems which keep their body temperature within close limits. 
 
 In [[mammal]]s, the main organs involved with homeostasis are: 
 *The [[hypothalamus]] and [[pituitary gland]] 
 *the [[lung]]s 
 *the [[skin]] 
 *the [[muscle]]s 
 *the [[kidney]]s 
 *the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] 
 The brain is also central to homeostasis. It controls [[behaviour]], and the basic function of behaviour is to support life by taking action.
