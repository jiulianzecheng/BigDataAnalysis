'''Firefighting''' is the act of trying to prevent the spread of and put out unwanted [[fire]]s. The fires can be in [[building]]s, [[vehicle]]s, woodlands, and other places. A [[firefighter]] puts out fires to protect [[property]], people and the [[environment]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Firefighter|publisher=The National Careers Service|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/firefighter|access-date=November 24, 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 Firefighters usually go through a lot of technical [[training]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Recruitment-UK Fire Service|publisher=UK Fire Service|url=http://www.fireservice.co.uk/recruitment|access-date=November 24, 2018}} < /ref >  This includes fighting fires in [[building]]s, [[car]]s and the woods. 
 
 One of the major [[hazard]]s with firefighting is the [[poison]]ous environment made by things burning. Four major risks are [[smoke]], [[oxygen]] deficiency, high temperatures and [[poison]]s in the air. < ref > {{cite web|title=Fire Fighter|publisher=The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/occup_workplace/firefighter.html|access-date=November 24, 2018}} < /ref >  To protect themselves from smoke, firefighters will wear a device called a breathing apparatus. 
 
 One way to put out fires is to spray them with [[water]]. The water does two things: it [[vapor]]izes when it comes in contact with fire. The [[water vapor]] leaves the fire with less oxygen, which it needs to keep burning. The other thing water does is make things cooler. That can keep the fire from burning because things will not burn if they are not hot enough.
