 [[File:Regular polygon 5 annotated.svg|thumb|A regular pentagon]] 
 A '''pentagon''' is a [[polygon]] with five edges. It is defined by five points, which are all on a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. If all the edges have the same length and the [[Angle|angles]] at the corners are all [[Degree (angle)|108°]], the pentagon is called ''regular''. If the pentagon intersects itself, it is called a [[pentagram]]. 
 
 Pentagons also occur in [[nature]]: [[Fruit]]s of the [[Okra]] are pentangular. The [[flower]]s of [[Ipomoea]] are pentagular. In [[chemistry]], many [[Cyclic compound]]s are pentangles: [[Cyclopentane]] and [[Furan]] are examples for this. In architecture, many [[bastion]]s are pentangular: [[Bourtange]], in the [[Netherlands]] has been completely restored, and is a pentangle.  The [[Citadel of Lille]], [[Nyenschantz]], near [[St. Petersburg]], or the [[Citadel of Pamplona]] are . The [[Villa Farnese]] is a [[palace]] in the form of a pentagon, so is the [[castle]] of [[Nowy Wiśnicz]]. The [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]] near [[Žďár nad Sázavou]]  also uses a pentangular design. 
 
 == Formulas == 
 ''Note: these formulas only work for regular pentagons.'' 
 
 < math > \text{Height} = \frac{\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}}{2} \cdot \text{Side}\approx 1.539 \cdot \text{Side}, < /math > 
 
 < math > \text{Width} = \text{Diagonal}= \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2} \cdot \text{Side}\approx 1.618 \cdot \text{Side}, < /math > 
 
 < math > \text{Width} = \sqrt{2-\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}} \cdot \text{Height}\approx 1.051 \cdot \text{Height}, < /math > 
 
 < math > \text{Diagonal} = R\ {\sqrt { \frac {5+\sqrt{5}}{2}} } = 2R\cos 18^\circ = 2R\cos\frac{\pi}{10} \approx 1.902 R, < /math > 
 
 ''R'' is the [[radius]] of the [[circumcircle]].
