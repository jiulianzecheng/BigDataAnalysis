 '''Aeneas''' was a [[Troy|Trojan]] [[prince]] and [[hero]]. His father was [[Anchises]], his mother was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[deity|goddess]] [[Aphrodite]] ([[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in the case of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources). Both [[Homer]] and [[Publius Vergilius Maro|Virgil]] mention him in their stories. Virgil wrote a whole series of [[book]]s about him. These books are called [[Aeneis]] in their original [[Latin]]. The usual [[English language|English]] translation of the title is ''[[Aeneid]]''.  
 
 The books relate to the story of  " pious Aeneas " . < ref > Moseley, Nicholas. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3288939   " Pius Aeneas, " ] ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 20, No. 7 (Apr., 1925), pp. 387-400; retrieved 2011-10-31. < /ref >  and about how the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] came to be.  
 
 The tale starts with Aeneas carrying his father out of the burning Troy, and end with [[Romulus and Remus]] [[wikt:founder|founding]] Rome (after Aeneas landed on the coast, after sailing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] for a long time). Aeneas also appears in Book 5 of the ''[[Iliad]]'' written by [[Homer]]. 
 
 [[William Shakespeare]] also wrote a story mentioning Aeneas. [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote a play about Aeneas and [[Dido, Queen of Carthage|Dido]], the queen who fell in love with him. There is also an [[opera]] about Dido and Aeneas, written by [[Henry Purcell]].
