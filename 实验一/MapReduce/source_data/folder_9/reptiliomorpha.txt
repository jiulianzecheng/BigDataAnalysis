 '''Reptiliomorpha''' is a [[clade]] of the [[amniotes]] and those [[tetrapods]] that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians ([[lissamphibia]]ns). 
 
 Unfortunately, different experts have used the term in several different ways. It has even been used for fossils of early amphibians. It is best used for animals which lay [[cleidoic egg]]s, but are not [[synapsids]]. Otherwise precursors of reptiles ([[sauropsids]]) get lumped together with precursors of mammals (synapsids). 
 
 Its only justification is that it may not always be possible to decide which group a fossil is from. But gradually, as with ''[[Seymouria]]'', it is possible to separate fossils into more specific grouups.
