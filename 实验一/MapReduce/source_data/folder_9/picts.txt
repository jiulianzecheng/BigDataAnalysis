 They are first mentioned in written [[:wikt:records|records]] in [[:wikt:AD|AD]] 297, before the [[Roman Britain|Roman conquest of Britain]]. < ref name=Wagner4 > Paul Wagner, ''Pictish Warrior AD 297-841'' (Oxford; Oseola, WI: Osprey Publishing, 2002), p. 4 < /ref >  The name 'Pict' is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pictus'' meaning 'painted.' This may have been due to reports from the Romans that the Picts [[:en:wikt:tattoos|tattoos]] on their bodies, < ref name=Wagner4/ >  along with reports that ancient Celtic Britons during Roman times would paint themselves various terms that are now translated as  " [[woad]] " , but originally may have meant  " glass "  and  " green "  (''[[vitrum]]'' and ''[[glastum]]'', respectively). This process is described as staining the skin of battle wounds a dark color, since woad is a powerful astringent. < ref name= " Van Der Veen " > {{Cite journal|last1=Van Der Veen|first1=M.|last2=Hall|first2=A.

 They spoke a Pictish language.

 The area of Scotland called [[:en:wikt:Pictland|Pictland]] gradually merged with the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] kingdom of [[Dál Riata]]. < ref > ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'', ed.

Alba then expanded, absorbing the British kingdom of [[Strathclyde]] and Bernician [[Lothian]]. By the [[11th century]] the Pictish identity had become a part of the [[Scottish people]].
