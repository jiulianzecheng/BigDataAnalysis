 A '''Volksschule''' was part of an 18th-century system of state-supported [[primary school]]s established in the [[Habsburg]] [[Austrian Empire]]. Attendance was supposed to be compulsory. However, a 1781 census found that only one fourth of the school-age children attended. At the time, this was one of the few examples of state-supported schooling. 
 
 The Volksschule still exist in Austria today, ''Volksschule'' is the Austrian equivalent to the German word ''Grundschule'' and the [[Swiss German]] word ''Primarschule'', [[i.e.]] [[primary school]].
