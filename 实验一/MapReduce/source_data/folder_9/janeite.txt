 The word '''Janeite''' has been used by people who love the works of [[Jane Austen]]. However, it can also be used to show disapproval. Claudia Johnson says that ''Janeitism'' is  " the self-consciously [[idol]]atrous enthusiasm (love) for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her (about her) " . < ref name= " Johnson, 211 " > Johnson, 211. < /ref > 
 
 Janeitism did not begin until after J. E. Austen-Leigh published ''A Memoir of Jane Austen'' in 1870. When this was published, Jane Austen became much more popular. This worried the [[literature|literary]] [[wikt:elite|elite]]. They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the  " masses " . < ref name= " Johnson, 211 " / >  The word ''Janeite'' was first begun by the literary scholar [[George Saintsbury]] in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''. < ref > Lynch,  " Introduction " , 24, n.24. < /ref >  Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains,  " he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly (triumphantly, happily) pin " . < ref > Lynch,  " Introduction " , 13-14. < /ref >  In the early twentieth century, Janeitism was  " principally (mostly) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers, professors, and literati " . < ref > Johnson, 213. < /ref >  [[Rudyard Kipling]] even printed a [[short story]] called  " Janeites "  about a group of [[World War I]] [[soldier]]s who were [[Fan (person)|fan]]s of Austen's novels. < ref > Johnson, 214. < /ref > 
 
 In the 1930s and 1940s,Austen's works were accepted at school, and the word began to change its meaning. It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the  " wrong "  way. The word, according to Lynch, is now  " {{nowrap|used ... about}} and against ''other'' people " . < ref > Lynch,  " Introduction " , 13. < /ref >
