[[File:Aivazovsky, Ivan - The Ninth Wave.jpg|thumb|240px|The Ninth Wave of storm by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].]]A '''storm''' is a violent [[meteorology|meteorological phenomenon]] in which there is heavy [[rain]], and [[wind]] due to moisture in the air. [[Hail]] and [[Lightning]] are also common in storms. More rarely, [[Tornado]]es can occur in storms.  
 
 [[Hurricane]]s, [[typhoon]]s, and [[tornadoes]] are, often, called storms too but they have special names because they are very, very strong. Storms are studied by scientists called [[meteorology|meteorologists]]. The idea of [[Shipping Forecast|shipping forecasts]] started with a concern to save [[ship]]s from unexpected storms in the North [[Atlantic]]. A storm is associated with severe weather and may be marked by strong [[wind]],  [[thunder]], [[lightning]] and heavy precipitation such as [[ice]]. Therefore, the knowledge of the weather condition is extremely important. < ref > [http://www.stormpulse.com U.S. Weather Tracking Map by Stormpulse] < /ref > < ref > [http://www.spc.noaa.gov NOAA's Storm Prediction Center] < /ref > 
 
 There are many varieties and names for storms: ''icestorm'', ''blizzard'', ''snowstorm'', ''ocean-storm'', ''firestorm'', etc. The storms called [[thunderstorm]]s develop in hot, humid tropical areas like  [[Mexico]]  very frequently. The rising temperatures produce strong upward rising winds. These winds carry water [[droplet]]s upwards, where they freeze, and fall down again. The swift movement of the falling water droplets along with the rising air create ''lighting'' and [[sound]].
