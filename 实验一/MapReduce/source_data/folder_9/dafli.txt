A '''Dafli''' or '''Daf''' is a handheld bass producing device, which can be thought of similar to a [[drum]] or [[Tabla]]. There is not much learning involved unlike other musical instruments and one can soon learn to produce a musical pattern on it. They are often used in rural folk fares, religious festivals, or [[Bhajan]]s. Some people earn their livelihood by playing such musical instruments.
