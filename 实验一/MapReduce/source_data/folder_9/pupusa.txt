The articles for their preparation have also been found in other archaeological sites in El Salvador. 
 
 ==Different types== 
 
 Depending on what city people visit, they’ll find different types of Pupusas. if they  go to the coast side, they’ll find Pupusas filled with [[shrimp]] and fish. Pupusas can be also filled with different types of flowers like “flor de Izote” (El Salvador national flower), lorocco, Cucurbita argyrosperma, cilantro, Chamaedorea tepejilote, chipilín, mora, chicken, and papelillo. 
 
 ==Around the Americas== 
 
 There are various types of Pupusas in El Salvador alone. From the way the [[dough]] is made to the preparation and even the fillings that are used, each place and pupuseria can have their own take on making a pupusa. On the other hand, El Salvador, a pupusa de arroz is also a popular variant. It is made from [[rice flour]] instead of cornmeal. Of course pupusas are not always going to taste the same, depending on what type of dough people make them with. Pupusas might taste a little different when using commercial corn or rice flour instead of masa harina (dried cornmeal flour) that Salvadorians use.
