 '''Ratnasambhava''' is one of the five Dhyani [[Buddha]]s.  
 
 His [[mandala]] is yellow and is in the southern direction. Ratnasambhava embodies [[Dharma]] that changes pride, miserliness and avarice into equanimity. He is shown with his right hand extended down, palm facing outwards. His left hand holds a precious jewel in his lap.  He is associated with changing poverty into wealth. Ratnasambhavaâ€™s blessings allow us to overcome pride and miserliness, thereby developing inner calm. The wealth-giving Buddhas or [[Jambhala]]s are associated with the family of Ratnasambhava.
