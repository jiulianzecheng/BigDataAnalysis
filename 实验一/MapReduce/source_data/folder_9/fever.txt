A '''fever''' is when a person's body temperature is hotter than 37.5 degrees [[Celsius]] (99.5 [[Fahrenheit]]). Normal body temperature for humans varies based on a variety of factors, including age and level of physical activity. < ref > [http://firstaid.webmd.com/body-temperature {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116170722/http://firstaid.webmd.com/body-temperature |date=2013-01-16 }} WebMD Body Temperature < /ref >   It is typically cited as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 & nbsp;F), but naturally varies from person to person by at least .5 degrees Celsius. The actual [[measurement]] of body [[temperature]] will vary based on the location of the [[measurement]].  For a [[temperature]] taken from under the [[tongue]], the measurement may be lower. [[Rectal]] temperatures will read about 0.3 & nbsp;C (0.55 & nbsp;F) higher, and armpit temperatures will read about the same amount lower. 
 
 When people are ill, their body's [[immune system]] fights the [[disease]], and so the body temperature rises. Fever is a defensive measure of the body against the germs: the life cycles of the germs are disrupted when the body temperature rises. 
 
 About 38 & nbsp;°C (100.4 & nbsp;F) degrees is called a low-grade fever, and above 39.5 & nbsp;°C (103 & nbsp;F) degrees is a high-grade fever. 
 
 [[Child]]ren usually have a higher fever than adults; their [[immune system]] is less mature. Infants have the highest normal temperature, which decreases as people age. Some animals, especially small ones like [[rabbit]]s and [[cat]]s, also have a higher normal temperature than humans. 
 
 Sometimes, high-grade fever can be a [[medical emergency]]. At or above 42 & nbsp;°C (107.6 & nbsp;F) organs start taking damage that may not be repairable. While most fevers are caused by [[Infection]], whether bacterial or viral, some fevers can be caused by cancers, including [[leukemia]], < ref > [http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=7026 Leukemia  & nbsp; & #124; & nbsp;The Leukemia  &  Lymphoma Society] < /ref >  [[lymphoma]], < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://lymphoma.about.com/od/symptoms/tp/warningsigns.htm |title=Warning Signs of Lymphoma - First Signs of Lymphoma |access-date=2010-05-05 |archive-date=2012-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118231746/http://lymphoma.about.com/od/symptoms/tp/warningsigns.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and [[renal cell carcinoma]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281340-overview |title=Medscape: Medscape Access |access-date=2010-05-05 |archive-date=2011-12-13 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63t69BTpq?url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/281340-overview |url-status=bot: unknown }} < /ref >
