 '''Quasars''' or '''quasi-stellar radio sources''' are the most energetic and distant [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN).  
 
 They are quite small in comparison with the energy they put out. Quasars are not much larger than the [[Solar System]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/35/text/ |title=Hubble surveys the  " homes "  of quasars |publisher=HubbleSite |date=1996-11-19 |accessdate=2011-07-01 |archive-date=2016-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706164722/http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/35/text/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The mechanism of brightness changes probably involves [[relativistic beaming]] of jets pointed nearly directly toward us. < ref > By that is meant: a beam at near the [[speed of light]] appears brighter to us by a kind of [[Doppler effect]]. < /ref >  The highest [[redshift]] quasar known ({{As of|2011|06|lc=on}}) has a [[redshift]] of 7.085, which means it is about 29 billion [[light-year]]s from Earth. This estimate is made using the concept of [[comoving distance]]. 
 
 Scientists now agree that a quasar is a compact region in the center of a massive galaxy surrounding a central [[supermassive black hole]]. < ref > {{cite web|last=Irion|first=Robert|title=A quasar in every galaxy?|url=https://secure-site.ckmedia.com/content_downloads/SKY_ebook_BlackHoles.pdf|work=Sky and Telescope|publisher=New Track Media|accessdate=20 February 2014|archive-date=21 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321224607/https://secure-site.ckmedia.com/content_downloads/SKY_ebook_BlackHoles.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Its size is 10–10,000 times the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the [[black hole]]. The energy emitted by a quasar is [[gravitational energy]], created from [[mass]] falling onto the [[accretion disc]] around the black hole. 
 
 Quasars are extremely luminous. They were first identified as being high [[redshift]] sources of [[electromagnetic radiation]], including [[radio frequency|radio waves]] and [[visible spectrum|visible light]]. The light (and other energy) appeared to be similar to [[star]]s, rather than large sources like [[galaxy|galaxies]]. On the other hand, their spectra had very broad emission lines, unlike any known from stars, hence  " quasi-stellar " . Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way. < ref name= " 3C 273 article " > {{cite journal|title=The quasi-stellar radio sources 3C 48 and 3C 273 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964ApJ...140....1G|journal=The Astrophysics Journal|bibcode=1964ApJ...140....1G |accessdate=25 April 2014 |last1=Greenstein |first1=Jesse L. |last2=Schmidt |first2=Maarten |date=1964 |volume=140 |page=1 |doi=10.1086/147889 |s2cid=123147304 }} < /ref > 
 
 The accretion discs of central supermassive black holes can convert about 10% of the mass of an object into energy. < ref >  as compared to 0.7% for the p-p chain [[nuclear fusion]] process that dominates the energy production in Sun-like stars. < /ref > 
 This mechanism explains why quasars were more common in the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it.  
 
 This means that most galaxies, including our own [[Milky Way]], may have gone through an active stage as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy. They are now dormant because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.
