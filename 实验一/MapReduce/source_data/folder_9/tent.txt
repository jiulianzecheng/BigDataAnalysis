 A '''tent''' is a movable, lightweight [[shelter]] which uses [[fabric]] to protect people from wind, rain and from the cold. The fabric walls of a tent are supported by wood or metal poles and thin ropes (called  " guy lines " ), and the tent or the ropes are usually attached to the ground with plastic or metal pointed stakes, or lattice frames and internal posts in the cases of [[yurt]]s and [[marquee]]s. Tent camping exploded in popularity in the 1960s. Manufacturers introduced poles made of [[fiberglass]] or [[Aluminium|aluminum]] alloys, allowing for a greater range of shapes and a lighter weight tent to transport. Zippered tent doors replaced the traditional flap opening. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2018-07-14|title=A Brief History of Tents - where did tents originate?

Tents are also used to provide temporary sleeping quarters for [[military]] personnel or [[homeless]], or for people who have been displaced by a disaster (such as [[refugee]]s).
