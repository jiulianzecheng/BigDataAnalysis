 A '''regatta''' is a term used to describe either a [[boat]] race, or series of boat races.  
 
 Although the term typically describes racing events of unpowered watercraft, some [[powerboat]] race series are also called ''regattas''.  Most commonly, a ''regatta'' is either a series of [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]] or [[yacht racing]]. 
 
 Although ''regattas'' are typically amateur competitions, they are usually very highly organized, formally structured events, with complex rules precisely describing the schedule and procedures of the event.
