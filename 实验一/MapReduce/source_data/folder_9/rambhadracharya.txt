 ==Birth and early life== 
 
 Jagadguru Rambhadracharya was born in Shandikhurd village of Jaunpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. His family was a Saryupareen Brahmin family of Vasishtha ''Gotra''. His birth time was 10:34 & nbsp;pm and he was born on the [[Makar Sankranti]] day of Saturday, January & nbsp;14, & nbsp;1950 (Magha Krishna Ekadashi). His mother was Shachidevi and his father was Pandit Rajdev Mishra. His name ''Giridhara'' was named by his father's aunt, a cousin of his grandfather Pandit Suryabali Mishra. His father's aunt was an admirer of Mirabai, a female saint of the Bhakti age in middle India, who used the name Giridhara for Krishna in her compositions. < ref name= " kkbvp " / > < ref name= " dinkarearlylife " > Dinkar 2008, pp. 22–24. < /ref > 
 
 ===Blindness=== 
 Giridhara became blind in March 1950 when he was aged two months. When he got the eye disease [[trachoma]], there was no medical care in his village. He was taken to a local woman who was known to cure Trachoma. She dropped a hot medicine into his eyes to break the Trachoma lumps, but his eyes started bleeding and he became blind. < ref name= " aicb-bio " > {{Citation |last1=Aneja |first1=Mukta |last2=Eyeway Team |year=2005 |title=Abilities Redefined - Forty Life Stories of Courage And Accomplishment |publisher=All India Confederation of the Blind |chapter=Shri Ram Bhadracharyaji - A Religious Head with a Vision |chapter-url=http://www.aicb.in/images/success_story.pdf |accessdate=April 25, 2011 |pages=66–68 |archive-date=September 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903121706/http://www.aicb.in/images/success_story.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  His family took him to many [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]], [[Homeopathy|Homeopathic]], Allopathic and medical doctors in Sitapur, [[Lucknow]] and [[Mumbai]], but there was no help. < ref name= " dinkarearlylife " / >  He cannot read or write, as he does not use the [[Braille]] system, but learns by listening and composes by dictating to secretaries. < ref name= " aicb-bio " / > 
 
 ===First musical work=== 
 
 As Giridhara's father used to work in Bombay, his early learning was at home from his grandfather. During afternoons, his grandfather used to tell him various parts of the Ramayana, the [[Mahabharata]] and other books like ''Vishramsagar'', ''Sukhsagar'', ''Premsagar'', and ''Brajvilas'', etc. When he was of 3 years, Giridhara made his first poem in Hindi (Avadhi), which was the following ''pada''. He spoke it to his grandfather. In this poem, [[Yashoda]] is fighting with a Gopi for causing pain to Krishna. < ref name= " dinkarearlylife " / >
