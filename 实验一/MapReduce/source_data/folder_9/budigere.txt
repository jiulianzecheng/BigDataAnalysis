 Nimbekaipura (English: Lemon Town) is a village in Budigere Cross, Budigere. It is close to Mandur. It is believed that about 200-300 years ago, a lemon tree used to grow here. This tree was the only one closest to the neighborhood. As the village expanded, it was named Nimbekaipura after the tree. The tree was uprooted about 30 years ago due to a major storm. Due to the loss of the tree, surrounding villages do not travel to Nimbekaipura frequently. Today, several real estate properties have come up in the village. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/not-just-another-lemon-tree/articleshow/21273164.cms | title=Not just another lemon tree }} < /ref >
