 [[File:Gehweg.jpg|thumb|A pavement ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), sidewalk ([[Canada|CA]], [[United States of America|US]]), or footpath ([[Australia|AU]], [[Ireland|IE]], [[India|IN]], [[New Zealand|NZ]]).]] 
 A '''sidewalk''' is a [[Trail|path]] for [[pedestrian]]s that runs along the side of a [[road]]. It is called a sidewalk in [[American English]], but can also be called a '''pavement''' (mainly [[British English]] and [[ South African English]]), a '''footpath''' ([[Australian English]], [[Irish English]], [[Indian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]) or '''footway''' ([[Engineering]] term). 
 
 Pedestrians use sidewalks to keep them safe from [[vehicle]]s on the road. Sidewalks can be paved with bricks, poured concrete or tarmac.  
 
 In suburban areas sidewalks are often separated from the roadway by a verge planted with grass and trees. 
 
 Street furniture (benches, letterboxes, transit shelters, litter bins, advertising columns, etc.) are often placed on or immediately adjacent to sidewalks.
