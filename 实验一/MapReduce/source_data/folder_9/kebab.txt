Kebab is usually made of [[lamb]] and [[beef]]. Sometimes [[chicken]] and [[fish]] are used for some styles. [[Pork]] is never used by Muslims but is sometimes used by non-Muslim sellers.

 There are many varieties of kebab and the term means different things in different countries. The generic term kebab usually refers to [[doner kebab]] or ''döner kebap'' in Europe and to '''Gyros''' in the United States, though its meaning can vary. In [[South Asia]] the term can refer to a whole range of items such as Chappali kabab, Shami kabab, Bihari kabab and so on.

 ==Variations== 
 There are many types of kebab. Below are just a few. 
 
 ===Shish=== 
 Shish kebabs are derived from the Turkish şiş which means skewer. They are cooked or grilled on skewers, over hot coals or wood. These kababs originated in [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] and then spread out to [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]]. They are also very popular now in Europe and the United States. 
 
 ===Döner=== 
 {{main|Döner kebab}} 
 Döner kebap (which means  " rotating kebab "  in Turkish) is sliced lamb, beef, or chicken, that is slowly [[Roasting|roasted]] on a vertical rotating spit. 
 
 ===Chappali=== 
 '''Chappali kabab''' or '''chappal kabab''' or '''chapli kebab''' is a type of fried kebab. It started in the North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]) of present [[Pakistan]] and in [[Afghanistan]]. The name comes from the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] (and also [[Urdu]]) word for 'slipper' or 'shoe'. The kebab is actually called a 'slipper/shoe kebab'. Its shape is like that of a slipper or shoe. 
 
 This kebab is basically made from ground or minced [[beef]] or [[mutton]] mixed with tomatoes, onions and chillies, and a variety of herbs and spices. It is given its unique shape. It is fried in a special big pan. It is eaten with big ''roti'' bread typical of the [[Pathan]] region. Often ''Qahwa'' or green tea, is drunk with it or after it, to help digestion.  
 
 ''Chappali kabab'' is very popular throughout Pakistan. It has spread to major cities of the country such as [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. According to [[gourmets]], the best ones are still found in [[Peshawar]] city and [[Mardan]]. Today, the popularity of these kebabs is also gradually spreading to other parts of the world, including the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the United States.
