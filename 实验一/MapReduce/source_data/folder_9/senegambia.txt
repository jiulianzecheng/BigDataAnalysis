 == Senegambian history == 
 There is little known about the early history of the area. By about 1000 [[AD]] the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Fula people]]s had formed [[settlement]]s along the [[Gambia River]]. < ref name=Atlas > {{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~msj42/Senegambia.htm |title=Senegambia |publisher=The Atlas of the Gambia/Columbia University |access-date=31 January 2016}} < /ref >   The [[Toucouleur people]] were settled in [[east]] and [[central]] Senegal. < ref name=Atlas/ >  [[Kingdom]]s such as the [[Kingdom of Jolof|Jolof]] and the [[Sere people|Sere]] settled in the area [[north]] of the Gambia River. < ref name=Atlas/ >  The first [[Europe]]ans, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[sailor]]s, arrived about 1455. < ref name=Atlas/ >  [[Portugal]] controlled the area between the [[Sénégal River|Sénégal]] and Gambia Rivers until the [[British]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[France|French]] moved into the area. They traded [[goods]] such as [[salt]], [[iron]], [[gun]]s and [[gunpowder]] for [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[Ebony (tree)|ebony]] and [[slave]]s. < ref name=Atlas/ >   
   
 == Senegambia and the Middle Passage == 
 About 24% of the African slaves brought to [[United States|America]], were from Senegambia.{{efn|Estimates of how many Africans were taken to the Americas from the [[15th century|15th]] to the [[19th century|19th centuries]] vary widely. < ref name=GuardianNQ > {{cite web |title=How many Africans were transported to the Americas as a result of the European slave trade?

After the early [[19th century]], when slave trading was illegal, no numbers exist since slaves were [[smuggling|smuggled]] into the Americas. < ref name=GuardianNQ/ >  During the 19th century it was estimated 20 [[million]] slaves landed in the Americas although other sources double that number. < ref name=GuardianNQ/ >  A recent study by [[Professor]] John Farge argues that the actual number of African slaves was no more than 9 million and probably less than that. < ref name=Uzoigwe189 > G.

 Because of the need for [[Farm|field workers]] up to two-thirds of Africans taken captive were men. < ref name=MorganUA > {{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/faculty/jhobson/wss308/middlepassage.html |title=Women's Resistance in the Middle Passage: A Story Lost at Sea |author=Molly Morgan |publisher=University at Albany |access-date=31 January 2016 |archive-date=8 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808233626/http://www.albany.edu/faculty/jhobson/wss308/middlepassage.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In the Senegambia region due to the high demand by buyers, men and boys were taken from all over the region. < ref name=MorganUA/ >  Women, however, being in less demand, were taken from the easily accessed [[coast]]al areas.
