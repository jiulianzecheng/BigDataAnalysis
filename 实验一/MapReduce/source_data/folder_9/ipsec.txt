 '''Internet Protocol Security''' ('''IPsec''') is a way of making [[Internet]] [[communication]]s more secure and private. 
 
 IPsec is a collection of [[protocol]]s for securing [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) communications by [[authentication|authenticating]] (and optionally [[encryption|encrypting]]) each [[packet (information technology)#Example: IP packets|IP packet]] of a [[data stream]]. IPsec also includes protocols for establishing [[mutual authentication]] between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] to be used during the session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts (e.g. [[User (computing)|computer users]] or [[Server (computing)|servers]]), between a pair of security gateways (e.g. [[router]]s or [[firewall]]s), or between a security gateway and a host. [[Rfc:2406|RFC 2406]] 
 
 IPsec is an end-to-end security solution and operates at the [[Internet Layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], comparable to [[network layer|Layer 3]] in the [[OSI model]]. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]], [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] and [[Secure Shell|SSH]], operate in the [[Upper layer protocol|upper layers]] of these models. This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application. 
 
 The term  " IPsec "  is officially defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled ''IPSec''.
