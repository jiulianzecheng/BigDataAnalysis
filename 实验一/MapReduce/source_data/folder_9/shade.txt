 '''Shade''' is produced when the sun is shining and an object, a [[tree]] for example, blocks the direct sunlight so that it cannot reach a certain spot. The dark [[image]] which the object casts on the ground (or on another object) is called [[shadow]], not ''shade''. 
 
 '''Shade''' can also mean a darker or lighter color of the same base color. For example: in a picture of a tree's shadow, the grass in the shade will be a darker ''shade'' of green than the grass out of the shade.
