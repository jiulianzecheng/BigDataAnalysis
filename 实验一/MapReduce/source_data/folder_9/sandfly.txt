 '''Sandflies''' are a group of [[flies]], many of which feed on blood and are [[Vector (biology)|vectors]] of [[parasites]].  
 
 The group is the '''Phlebotominae''', a subfamily of flies. < ref > Sometimes the name is applied to other insects as well. < /ref >    Parasitic diseases spread by the flies include [[leishmaniasis]], [[bartonellosis]] and [[pappataci fever]]. In the [[New World]] leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus ''[[Lutzomyia]]''. ''Lutzomyia'' often live in caves, where their main hosts are [[bat]]s. In the [[Old World]] sand flies in the genus ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' spread leishmaniasis. 
 
 Phlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various [[mammals]], [[reptiles]] and [[birds]]. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable [[Host (biology)|host]] they find. All species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first. [[Protein]]s and other [[nutrient]]s in the blood enable the female to produce eggs. < ref > Braverman Y. 1994. Nematocera (Ceratopogonidae, Psychodidae, Simuliidae and Culicidae) and control methods.  ''Rev. Sci. Oech. Off. Int. Epiz.'', '''13'''(4), 1175-1199 < /ref >    
 
 The flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit [[blood clotting]], plus some that stimulate host [[mast cell]]s to produce [[histamine]]; this distend [[capillary]] vessels, thereby promoting blood flow. < ref > Killick-Kendrick R. 1999. The biology and control of Phlebotomine sand flies. ''Clinics in Dermatology'' '''17''' (3): 279â€“89. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738081X99000462] < /ref > 
 
 One blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter. 
 
 Sand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical. This helps them in escape notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later.  Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are present.
