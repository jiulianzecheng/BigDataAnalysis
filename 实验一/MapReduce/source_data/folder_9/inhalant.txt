 '''Inhalant''' is the name for a number of [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] that can cause [[hallucination]]s  when they are inhaled. For this reason, [[Adolescence|adolescents]] often use them instead of [[illegal drugs]]. Many [[solvent]]s contain such substances. Usually, solvents that are used in the household are easy to get. In many cases, the effect will start very soon and last from minutes to hours.
