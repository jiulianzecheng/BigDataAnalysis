 '''Lubrication''' is a [[physics|physical]] [[process]] which allows [[surface]]s to move smoothly against each other. A thin film of lubricant put between the surfaces reduces [[friction]] and [[wear (erosion)|wear]] on the surfaces, and keeps temperatures from rising too far. The lubricant film can be a solid/[[liquid]] [[dispersion]], a liquid, a liquid-liquid dispersion (a [[Petroleum|grease]]) or, exceptionally, a [[solid]] or gas. 
 
 Examples are the use of [[oil]] in [[machinery]], the function of [[tears]] in [[eyes]] and [[synovial fluid]] in [[joint]]s.
