[[File:SodiumBicarbonate.svg|thumb|The bicarbonate anion is formed with a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen, single-bonded to a hydroxide group, which here is neutral, and single-bonded to another oxygen which requires one more electron to complete its outer shell. Here, the sodium cation provides the electron, resulting in a net -1 charge.]] 
 '''Bicarbonate''' is an anion (a negatively-charged [[ion]]). Its chemical formula is HCO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > âˆ’ < /sup > . It reacts with [[acid]]s to produce [[carbon dioxide]]. A sample compound is [[sodium bicarbonate]]. It forms [[carbonate]] when heated.
