 The '''Myxozoa'''  < ref > from Greek ''myx-'' = slime or mucus + ''zoa'' = animals < /ref >  are a group of [[Parasite|parasitic]] [[animal]]s of aquatic [[environment]]s. Some of them, such as ''[[Myxobolus cerebralis]]'', are important parasites of fishes that people eat. 
 
 Over 1300 [[species]] have been described and many have a two-host [[life cycle]], involving a [[fish]] and an [[annelid]] worm or [[bryozoa]]n. 
 
 They were once considered as [[parasitic]] [[protozoa]], but are now known to be members of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]]. Analysis of 50 coding [[gene]]s from ''[[Buddenbrockia]]'' showed the Myxozoa were severely modified members of the Cnidaria. 
 
 Similarities between myxozoan 'polar capsules' and cnidarian [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) had been known for a long time, but previously were thought to be the result of [[convergent evolution]]. < ref >
