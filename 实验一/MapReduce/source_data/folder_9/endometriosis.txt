To find endometriosis a doctor may do many medical tests. These tests may be a [[pelvic exam]] and an [[ultrasound]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  When a woman has a pelvic exam the doctor will feel for lumps or scars. An ultrasound will help the doctor see endometriosis on the ovaries. The doctor may put a wand-shaped ultrasound probe into the vagina. An ultrasound scanner may be used on the abdomen. Another test may be used. It is called an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. The MRI takes a picture of the inside of the body to find endometriosis. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 A doctor may treat endometriosis with medicine. There are different kinds of medicine that treat endometriosis. [[Birth control]] medicine can help some women have less pain. Another kind of medicine is called [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) agonists. If the pain is less after taking medicine then the doctor may decide that the woman has endometriosis. If the woman stops taking the medicine the pain may come back. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Endometriosis is sometimes treated with surgery. This is called laparoscopic surgery. The doctor doing the surgery can look inside the body to find endometriosis tissue and remove it. The doctor may see endometriosis tissue during laparoscopy. A doctor may remove a sample and study it under the microscope to decide treatment. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
