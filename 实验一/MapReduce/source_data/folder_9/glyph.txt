A '''glyph''' is an element of writing. Example: the [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] {{'}}'''æ'''{{'}} in archæology represents '''a''' and '''e''' letters. 
 
 More exactly, a glyph is an element in an agreed set of symbols. A mark used in a language is a glyph, but in another language it may not be a glyph. For example, an {{'}}'''n'''{{'}} with [[tilde]], '''ñ''', is used in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as in [[piñata]]. It is not a glyph in English.
