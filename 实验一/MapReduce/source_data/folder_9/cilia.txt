 A '''cilium''' (plural ''cilia'') is an [[organelle]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger [[Cell (biology)|cell body]]. < ref name= " HHMIB2005 " > {{cite journal

 There are two types of cilia:  
 #''motile'' cilia, which beat against fluid outside the cell. 
 #''non-motile'', or ''primary cilia'', which typically serve as sensory organelles.  
 
 In eukaryotes, cilia and [[flagella]] together make up a group of organelles known as [[undulipodia]]. < ref name=db2004 >

 Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic [[flagella]], although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length. < ref name=Haimo_JCB198112 >

 Motile cilia are found on [[protist]] [[ciliate]]s like ''[[Paramecium]]''. They are how ''Paramecium'' moves around. They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of [[metazoa]]ns, such as the [[digestive system]] and the [[trachea]] of the [[lung]]s. 
 
 == Cilia in metazoa ==   
 Non-motile (or ''primary'') cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all [[mammal]]ian cells have a single non-motile ''primary cilium''. < ref name= " HHMIB2005 " / >  In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose:  
 * The outer segment of the rod [[photoreceptor cell]] in the human eye is connected to its cell body with a specialized non-motile cilium. 
 * The [[Dendrite|dendritic knob]] of the [[olfactory]] neuron, where the [[odorant receptors]] are located, also contains non-motile cilia (about 10 cilia per dendritic knob).

 Cilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger [[flagella]]. So much so that it has been proposed [[protist]]s bearing either should be unified in the [[Phylum]] ''Undulipodia''. < ref > Margulis L  &  Dolan M.F. 2002. ''Early life: evolution on the Precambrian Earth''. 2nd ed, Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston. p89 < /ref >  Previously, Margulis had proposed that the [[Ciliate]]s alone should be placed in a Phylum ''Ciliophora''. < ref > Margulis L. Schwartz K.V.  &  Dolan M. 1999. ''Diversity of life: the illustrated guide to the five kingdoms''. Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston, p94. In this work the authors propose 19 phyla for the Protista, and call this 'Kingdom' the 'Protoctista', a term which is unfortunately almost unpronounceable. < /ref >  Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term. 
 
 Cilia and flagella are cell [[organelle]]s, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like [[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]), and that the [[eukaryote]] cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'. < ref > Margulis L. and McMenamin 1990. Marriage of convenience. ''The Sciences'' '''30''', 31-36. < /ref >
