 '''Fibreglass''' (US: [[fiberglass]]) is a [[composite material]]. It is a [[fiber-reinforced polymer|fibre-reinforced polymer]] made of a [[plastic]] reinforced by fine [[fibre]]s made of [[glass]]. The composite material may be called '''glass-reinforced plastic''' ('''GRP'''). 
 
 Fibreglass is cheaper and more [[flexibility|flexible]] than [[carbon fibre]]. It is stronger than many metals (when compared by weight), and can be [[moulding|moulded]] into complex shapes. The plastic matrix is usually a [[thermoset]] polymer â€“ such as [[epoxy]] or [[polyester]] resin,  or it may be a [[thermoplastic]]. < ref > Mayer, Rayner M. 1993.

 The benefits of fibreglass include: 
 
 * Fibreglass is strong with a long durability, and can withstand weathering 
 * Designs that cannot be achieved with glass can be done so with fibreglass 
 * Cost effective 
 * Fibreglass is non-conductive, as well as being radio frequency [[Transparency|transparent]], and has a lower reaction to thermal-conductivity 
 * Has the appearance of glass while offering more diverse usages 
 
 == Uses == 
 * Sail planes, Sports cars, micro cars, [[Kart racing|karts]], lorries, [[wind turbine]] blades. 
 * Pods, domes and architectural features where a light weight is needed 
 * Roofing products, swimming pools and composite housing 
 * Protective sleeving for RF Antennas 
 * Electrical enclosures 
 * Piping for above and below ground systems 
 
 == Use of the term == 
 " Fiberglass "  refers to the ''complete glass fiber reinforced composite material'', rather than just the glass fibre inside it.
