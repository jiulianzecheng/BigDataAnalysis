 [[File:Chest.agr.jpg|thumb|Human chest.]] 
 The '''chest''' is the front part of the [[torso]]. It is between the [[neck]] and [[abdomen]]. 
 
 In [[mammal]]s, the parts that make up the thorax are the [[sternum]], the thoracic [[vertebra]]e and the [[rib]]s. It starts from the [[neck]] and stops at the [[diaphragm]].  
 
 Women develop breasts on the chest during puberty, while male chests generally remain flat, while gaining muscle and many men grow chest hair. However, excess fat in men can contribute to gynocomestia, which leads to breast development in men.  
 
 In [[insect]]s and [[crustacean]]s, it is the middle of the three main body sections. The walking [[leg]]s are usually on the thorax.
