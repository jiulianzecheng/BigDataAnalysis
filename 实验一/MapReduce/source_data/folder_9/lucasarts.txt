Lucasfilm's early titles include: ''Ballblazer'' and ''Rescue on Fractalus'' both games were released in 1984, ''Koronis rift'' released in 1985. 
 
 In 1987, Lucasfilm Games created the SCUMM engine which stands for  < nowiki > ''Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion'' which would be used in many of LucasArt' < /nowiki > s future adventure games. The SCUMM engine was first developed for the game ''Maniac Mansion'' which was released in 1987. 
 
 ===Acquisition by Disney=== 
 On October 30, 2012, LucasArts was acquired by The Walt Disney Company through the acquisition of its parent company Lucasfilm in a deal for $4.05 billion.
