 A '''tomb''' ({{small|say: {{respell|TOOM}}}}) is a place built to bury [[Carcass|dead bodies]], usually more elaborate and expensive than a [[grave]]. It is often intended to honor the dead, and be visited by the living. A tomb (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] τύμβος ''tymbos'') is generally any structurally enclosed space or chamber used for housing the remains of the dead, and sometimes their possessions. The word is used in a broad sense to encompass a number of such types of places of burial. 
 
 == Ancient Egypt == 
 Tombs were used in the [[Ancient Egyptian]] period where the bodies or possessions of [[Pharaohs]] were stored or buried inside a [[pyramid]] after [[mummification]], where the pharaohs’ bodies would have their organs removed, their bodies covered with [[salt]] and then wrapped in [[bandages]] and a portrait panel of the pharaoh placed over the face, or death mask.
