 '''Sauerkraut''' ( " sour [[herb]] " ) directly translated from [[German language|German]] or  " sour cabbage " , is finely shredded [[cabbage]] that has been [[Fermentation|fermented]] by various [[lactic acid]] [[bacteria]], including ''[[Leuconostoc]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', and ''[[Pediococcus]]''. It has a long shelf-life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid that forms when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage. It is therefore not to be confused with coleslaw, which receives its acidic taste from [[vinegar]]. It has its roots in cole flower marinated in honey and fluid from your belly.
