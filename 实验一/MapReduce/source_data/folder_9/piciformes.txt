 '''Piciformes''' are an order of [[bird]]s containing about 67 living [[genera]] with a little over 400 [[species]], of which the [[Picidae]] ([[woodpecker]]s and relatives) make up about half. Amost all live in woods ([[arboreal]]). 
 
 In general, the Piciformes are [[insectivorous]], though the [[Capitonidae|barbets]] and [[toucan]]s mostly eat fruit and the [[honeyguide]]s are unique among birds in digesting [[beeswax]] (though insects make up most of their diet). 
 
 Nearly all Piciformes have [[parrot]]-like [[zygodactyl]] feet—two toes forward and two back, an arrangement that has obvious advantages for birds that spend much of their time on tree trunks.  An exception are a few [[species]] of three-toed woodpeckers.  The [[jacamar]]s aside, Piciformes do not have [[down feather]]s at any age, only true feathers. They range in size from the [[rufous piculet]] at 8 centimetres in length, and weighing 7 & nbsp;grams, to the [[toco toucan]], at 63 centimetres long, and weighing 680 & nbsp;grams. < ref name=EoB > {{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author=Short, Lester L.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher=Merehurst Press|location=London|pages=152–157|isbn=1-85391-186-0}} < /ref >  All nest in cavities (holes) and have [[altricial]] young, meaning they have to look after their chicks for quite a long time.
