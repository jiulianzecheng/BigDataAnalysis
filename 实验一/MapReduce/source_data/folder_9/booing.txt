{{for|the locality of Boo in Sweden|Boo, Nacka Municipality}} 
 '''Booing''' means shouting  " BOO! "  several times. When people do this, it means that they do not like it. It is the [[opposite]] of [[applause]] (clapping to show that the performance was good). 
 
 If people shout  " boo "  after a performance (for example, a [[concert]], [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[opera]]) they are showing that they did not like it.  
 
 Booing and hissing used to be very common, especially at the opera. In the early days of opera (from the 17th to the early [[19th century]]) opera audiences often behaved badly. They went to the opera to chat with their friends, to cheer their favorite singers and to boo the [[singer]] < nowiki/ > s they did not like, not to listen carefully to the [[music]]. 
 
 Booing has recently become less common in Western culture except at [[sports]] events because people think it is rude. [[Audience]]s today are more likely simply not to clap if they do not like a [[performance]]. Slow hand-clapping is also a way of showing sarcastic applause.
