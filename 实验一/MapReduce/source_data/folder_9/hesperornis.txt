 '''''Hesperornis ''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of flightless [[aquatic]] [[bird]]s that lived during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] (89–65 million years ago). 
 
 ''Hesperornis'' was an important early find in the history of [[avian]] [[paleontology]]. It was discovered by the paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh|O.C. Marsh]] in the late 19th century [[Bone Wars]].   
 
 Famous locations for ''Hesperornis'' are the Upper Cretaceous [[Ocean|marine]] [[limestone]]s from [[Kansas]] and the marine [[shale]]s from [[Canada]]. The genus probably had a [[Holarctic]] distribution.

 ''Hesperornis'' was a large bird, reaching up to 1.5 meters (5 & nbsp;feet) in length. It had virtually no wings, and swam with its powerful hind legs.  
 
 Like many other [[Mesozoic]] birds such as ''[[Ichthyornis]]'', ''Hesperornis'' had [[teeth]] in its [[beak]] which were used to hold prey (most likely [[fish]]). < ref >  Marsh, Othniel Charles 1880.

They probably fed mainly on fish, maybe also [[crustacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s and [[mollusk]]s, as do the diving seabirds of today. Their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey. 
 
 On land, ''Hesperornis'' species may or may not have been able to walk. They certainly could not stand upright like [[penguin]]s as in the early reconstructions. Their legs attached far at the back and sideways, with even the lower leg being tightly attached to the body (see photo of skeleton). Thus, they were limited to a clumsy hobble at best on land and would have been more nimble if they moved by sliding on their belly or [[galumphing]]. The leg skeleton of ''Hesperornis'' was so thoroughly adapted to diving that their mode on land, and their egg-laying and parental care, is a matter of speculation. 
 
 Young ''Hesperornis'' grew fairly quickly and continuously to adulthood, as is the case in modern birds. < ref name=Chinsamy98 > {{aut|Chinsamy A; Martin, Larry D.  &  Dobson P.}} (1998): Bone microstructure of the diving ''Hesperornis'' and the volant ''Ichthyornis'' from the Niobrara Chalk of western Kansas. ''Cretaceous Research'' '''19'''(2): 225-235. {{doi|10.1006/cres.1997.0102}} (HTML abstract) < /ref >  More young birds are known from the [[fossil]] record of the more northerly sites than from those further south. This suggests that at least some species were [[migration|migratory]] like today's penguins, which swim polewards in the summer. 
 
 ''Hesperornis'' was preyed upon by large marine carnivores such as [[mosasaur]]s. A ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' specimen contains the bones of a ''Hesperornis'' in its gut area.
