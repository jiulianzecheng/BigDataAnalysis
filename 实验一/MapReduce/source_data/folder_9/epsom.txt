 '''Epsom''' is a town in northern [[Surrey]]. The town is known for its [https://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk/epsom/ race course] and the [[Derby (horse race)|horse race]] held there. < ref name=racecourseHistory / >  It is owned by the Jockey Club, it is one of few racecourses in the UK that maintains a fantastic relationship with Queen Elizabeth, who attends annually to watch The Derby in early June. The first recorded race held at Epsom Downs Racecourse was in 1661. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-01-31|title=Epsom Racecourse|url=https://www.britishracecourses.org/epsom/|access-date=2021-07-02|website=British Racecourses|language=en-GB}} < /ref >   The Epsom Grandstand Association controlled racing on the course from the mid 19th century.  
 
 The town also gives it name to [[epsom salts]] which are found in [[mineral water]] here. < ref > {{Cite web|title=A Brief History of Epsom Salt: What Is It, Exactly?|url=https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/a-brief-history-of-epsom-salt-242655|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Apartment Therapy|language=en}} < /ref >  By the end of the Georgian period (early 1800s) Epsom was a [[spa town]]. After the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 its popularity increased, and visitors included Nell Gwyn and Samuel Pepys. The popularity of the spa declined after about 1725, but by then numerous large houses had been built by wealthy people who appreciated the nearness to London. Assembly rooms were built and still stand as the Assembly Rooms public house. Some remains of this are its water pump, [[well]]s and exhibits in the town's [[museum]]. A housing estate has been built upon the wells in the south-west of the town.
