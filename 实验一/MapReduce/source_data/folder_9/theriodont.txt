 '''Theriodonts'''  < ref > The name means  " beast tooth " , referring to the [[teeth]], which were more [[mammal]]-like than reptilian. < /ref >  are a major group of [[therapsid]]s. < ref > J.A. Hopson 1999.  " Therapsids " , in ''Encyclopedia of Paleontology'' '''2''': 1256-1266 < /ref >  They are a clade which include not only the traditional theriodonts, but also their descendants the [[mammals]] as well (in the same way that [[theropod]] dinosaurs include the [[Aves|birds]] as a sub-clade). 
 
 They can be defined in traditional terms as a suborder of [[Synapsida]] that lived from the Middle [[Permian]] to the Middle [[Cretaceous]]. Theriodonts appeared about 265 million years ago, in the Middle Permian. Even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their relatives.  
 
 Theriodonts fall into three main groups: [[Gorgonopsia]], [[Therocephalia]] and [[Cynodontia]]. Early theriodonts may have been [[warm-blooded]]. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the [[Triassic]].  
 
 Theriodont [[jaw]]s were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their [[dentary]] (lower jaw) was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing. Several other bones that were previously on the lower jaw, moved into the [[ear]]s, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of [[synapsid]]s.  
 
 '''Eutheriodonts''' refer to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most primitive group). They included the therocephalians, cynodonts and their descendants – the mammals. The name means  " true beast tooth " . The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger [[brain]]s and improved jaw [[muscle]]s.  
 
 The theriodonts (eutheriodonts) are one of the two [[synapsid]] survivors of the great [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the other being the [[dicynodont]]s. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the [[Lower Triassic]].   
 
 The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carrnivores such as ''[[Cynognathus]]'', as well as newly evolved herbivorous [[Traversodont]]s.  While Traversodonts for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (length of largest species up to 2 meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed.   
 
 By the [[Upper Triassic]] the small cynodonts included the rodent-like [[tritylodont]]s (possibly related to or descended from travsersodonts), and the tiny, shrew-like, [[trithelodonts]], which evolved into [[Mammaliaformes|the first mammals]]. The trithelodonts died out during the [[Jurassic]], and the tritylodonts survived in the [[Cretaceous]], but the mammals continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event]], which wiped out the non-[[Bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s, allowing the [[mammal]]s to [[adaptive radiation|diversify]] and dominate the Earth.
