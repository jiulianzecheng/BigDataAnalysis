'''Pharmacovigilance''' also known as '''drug safety''', is the science of  " collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention "  of adverse effects of medicines.  [[Adverse effect (medicine)|Side effects]] are common with most medicines.  Mistakes such as [[overdose]], and misuse and abuse of a drug as well as drug exposure during [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]] are also studied.   To sell or test a [[pharmaceutical]] product in most countries, information about these adverse events has to be collected and reported. < ref > {{cite report |url=https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/50360/retrieve |title=The Importance of Pharmacovigilance |date=2002 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=9241590157 |access-date=31 December 2020 |website=}} < /ref >
