 The Palestinian unrest which led to the outbreak of the first intifada started with the Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, forcing Palestinians to leave their land. < ref name= " :02 " > {{Cite web|title=intifada {{!}} History, Meaning, Cause,  &  Significance {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/intifadah|access-date=2022-05-09|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref >  Other reasons for the Palestinian rebellion were the worsening economy and the limited access to jobs. < ref name= " :12 " > {{Cite journal|last=Lesch|first=Ann M.|date=Autumn 1990|title=Prelude to the Uprising in the Gaza Strip|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2537319|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=20, nr. 1|issue=1 |pages=12|doi=10.2307/2537319 |jstor=2537319 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Start of the First Intifada === 
 The first protests against Israel's occupation erupted in Gaza. A car belonging to the Israeli army drove into a Palestinian car, killing all four occupants on 8 December 1987. That night, protests broke out in a Palestinian refugee camp during the funeral of the victims. < ref name= " :12 " / >   It became a Palestinian mass uprising against the occupation, Palestinians came into active resistance. < ref name= " :22 " / > < ref name= " :12 " / > 
 
 A party (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising: [[:en:Unified National Leadership of the Uprising|UNLU]]) was established which brought together all important Palestinian organizations and parties that already opposed Israel before the Intifada. < ref name= " :22 "  / > 
 
 === Casualties and overview === 
 The first Intifada is often known for its nonviolent nature. The nonviolent resistance from Palestinians existed of the boycott of Israeli products, strikes and the refusal to pay taxes or other obligated payments to Israel. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Citation|last=Nasrallah|first=Rami|title=The First and Second Palestinian Intifadas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203079553.ch5|work=Routledge Handbook on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict|year=2012 |publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9780203079553.ch5 |isbn=978-0-203-07955-3|access-date=2022-05-09}} < /ref >  However, the idea that the intifada was nonviolent is not correct.

 In 1989 the Israeli security forces switched to extreme violent tactics in this period. < ref name= " :3 "  / >  The Israeli tactics from this period led to a peak in Palestinian violence as well. 
 
 An estimated number of 1282 Palestinians died and more than 130.472 became injured during the six year period of the Intifada. < ref name= " :72 " > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aUq67aKpeAC & pg=PA231|title=Disasters and Mental Health|last1=Lopez-Ibor|first1=Juan José|last2=Christodoulou|first2=George|last3=Maj|first3=Mario|last4=Sartorius|first4=Norman|last5=Okasha|first5=Ahmed|date=2005-01-28|publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02124-8|language=en}} < /ref >  For every three Palestinians that died, less than one Israeli was killed. 
 
 === End of the First Intifada === 
 The Intifada officially ended on the 13th of September 1993, when the [[:en:Oslo I Accord|Declaration of principles]] was signed by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] and Israeli government. < ref name= " :8 " > {{Cite web|title=Milestones: 1993–2000 - Office of the Historian|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/oslo|access-date=2022-05-09|website=history.state.gov}} < /ref >  This declaration was also the start of the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo accords]], in which Palestine and Israel would start to discuss the many issues on autonomy, borders, refugees and Jerusalem. < ref name= " :8 "  / >

 === Overview === 
 After the First Intifada ended in 1993, there was still a lot of discontent among the Palestinians. They didn't agree with how the Oslo accords were followed by Israel. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Redactie|first=Auteur|title=Intifada - Opstand van de Palestijnen|url=https://historiek.net/intifada-israel-betekenis-palestijnen/81842/|access-date=2022-05-12|website=Historiek|language=nl}} < /ref >   When the Israeli premier [[Ariel Sharon]] visited the [[Temple Mount]] in a provocative way, it was the last straw for the Palestinians. This is why some people also call this uprising the 'Al-Aqsa Intifada'. < ref name= " britannica.com " / > 
 
 The Second Intifada began with Palestinian demonstrations. These started in Jerusalem, but quickly spread to the West Bank. In the beginning the Palestinians mostly threw rocks and were not obedient towards the Israelis, the Israelis were heavily armed. 
 
 Later on, the Palestinians used other, more deadly tactics. Some of them were suicide bombings, snipers and rocket attacks. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2018-11-20|title=What were the intifadas?|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18080066/israel-palestine-intifadas-first-second|access-date=2022-05-12|website=Vox|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2002, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli government decided to build a barrier between Israel and the West Bank. 
 
 Another important event during the Second Intifada was the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. This happened after things escalated between [[Hamas]] and the Israeli occupiers, which resulted in many deaths on both sides. 
 
 === The ending and aftermath === 
 In 2005, after more than 5 years, the Second Intifada came to an end. In 2004 the intensity of the uprising was already fading. This was because of the Palestinians becoming weary, struggling against the strong lasting Israeli defense. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Second Intifada 2000|url=https://www.adl.org/resources/glossary-terms/the-second-intifada-2000|access-date=2022-05-12|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The Second Intifada was more violent than the first one, causing over 3000 Palestinian and nearly 1000 Israeli deaths. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Just Vision|url=https://justvision.org/glossary/second-intifada|access-date=2022-05-12|website=justvision.org|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == March Intifada (Bahrain) == 
 In March 1965 an Intifada broke out in [[Bahrain]]. The goal of the uprising was to stop the British presence in Bahrain. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The March Intifada - Bahrain, 1965 {{!}} libcom.org|url=https://libcom.org/article/march-intifada-bahrain-1965|access-date=2022-05-18|website=libcom.org|language=en}} < /ref >  This Intifada was mostly led by groups with leftists ideas. Multiple people died, because of the violence the police used several times during the demonstrations. The protests started when a huge amount of workers from the Bahrain Petroleum company resigned. It changed fast into a general strike against the British. 
 
 The protests continued to happen annually until 1972. In 1972 the government agreed to talk with the opposition and they allowed three members from the workers union to join the government. The Bahrain Intifada took officially from 1965 to 1975. < ref name= " :9 "  / >
