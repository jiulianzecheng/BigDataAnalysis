An '''isthmus''' is a narrow strip of [[land]], with [[water]] on either side, that connects two bigger [[landmass]]es. For example, the Isthmus of [[Panama]] connects the [[continent]]s of [[The Americas]]. Separating two water bodies and joining two land bodies, an isthmus is the opposite of a [[strait]].
