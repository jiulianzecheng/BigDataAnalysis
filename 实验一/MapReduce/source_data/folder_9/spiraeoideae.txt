 The '''Spiraeoideae''' is an old name for a subfamily of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Rosaceae]]. Until 2007, the subfamily name was used for a group of plants that are mostly shrubs (but some are herbs) and have small dry fruit. In 2007, the subfamily was made much larger, to include plants that were previously placed in subfamilies Amygdaloideae and Maloideae. In 2012, it was decided at the [[International Botanical Congress]] that the correct name for that large subfamily must be [[Amygdaloideae]]. Subfamily Amygdaloideae now includes plants with fleshy fruit including [[apple]] and [[plum]].
