A '''swirly''' or '''swirlie''' is a form of [[bullying]] in which the victim's head is put into a [[toilet]].  Some people have questioned whether swirlies are real or whether they were invented for television and other [[fiction]]. 
 
 ==In fiction== 
 
 On television, one or more bigger people, usually high school boys, pick up the victim.  Then they dunk the victim's head in a toilet and flush it.  The swirling water gives the swirly its name.  For example, on the television show ''[[Archer (television)|Archer]]'', Archer tells Lana about how he got [[pneumonia]] from getting a swirly in high school: Two bigger boys had picked him up, turned him upside down, and put his head in a toilet.  On ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Bart Simpson]] gets a swirly from [[Jimbo Jones]]. In [[Cobra Kai]], Kenny gets [[revenge]] against Anthony LaRusso by dunking his head into a used [[toilet]]. 
 
 ==In real life== 
 
 There are a few reports of swirlies in real life.  In some, the  " victim "  agreed to be part of the swirly. < ref name=Green > {{cite news|title=Greendale high school football team reportedly gave 'swirlies' to teammates|accessdate=September 9, 2021|author=Christina Palladino |url=https://www.wisn.com/article/greendale-high-school-football-team-reportedly-gave-swirlies-to-teammates/6317733#|publisher=WISN}} < /ref >  In other reports, the victim describes the swirly almost exactly like a swirly in fiction.  One Blair Academy wrestler talked about being given swirlies and other abuse from older teammates. < ref name=Com > {{cite news|author=Lori Comstock|title='Get over it': Blair Academy wrestler says coaches turned a blind eye to years of hazing, abuse|accessdate=September 9, 2021|date=April 14, 2021|publisher=New Jersey Herald|url=https://www.njherald.com/story/news/local/2021/04/14/former-blair-academy-nj-wrestler-claims-coaches-laughed-off-hazing/7139900002/}} < /ref >   In others, the person giving the swirly is an adult or even a parent and not an older child. < ref name=Lee > {{cite news|url=https://www.dailycommercial.com/news/20180905/no-charges-against-leesburg-mom-for-giving-toilet-swirly|publisher=Daily Commercial|accessdate=September 9, 2021|title=No charges against Leesburg mom for giving toilet swirly|date=September 5, 2018}} < /ref >
