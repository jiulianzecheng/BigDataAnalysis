 '''''Pteropus''''' is a [[genus]] of large [[megabat]]s. They are commonly known as '''fruit bats''' or '''flying foxes'''. They live in the [[tropics]] and subtropics of [[Asia]]:  [[Australia]],  the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[East Africa]], and some oceanic islands in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. < ref name= " Walker 1999 " > {{cite book| editor-last=Nowak| editor-first= R.

 There are at least 60 [[Extant taxon|living]] species in the [[genus]]. 
 Flying foxes eat fruit and other plant matter, and occasionally  insects as well. They find food with their keen sense of smell. Most, but not all, are [[nocturnal]]. They navigate with keen eyesight, as they cannot [[echolocation|echolocate]]. They have long lives and low birth rates.  Females of most species have only one offspring each year. This slow birth rate makes their populations vulnerable in present-day circumstances. 
 
 Like other bats, flying foxes can give deadly diseases to humans. They are the reservoirs of rare but fatal disease agents such as [[Australian bat lyssavirus]] (which causes [[rabies]]), and [[Henipavirus#Hendra virus|Hendra virus]]. Seven known human deaths have come from these two diseases. [[Henipavirus#Nipah virus|Nipah virus]] is also transmitted by flying foxes & mdash;it affects more people, with over 100 fatalities.  
 
 Flying foxes have cultural significance to [[indigenous people]]. They appear in traditional art, folklore, and weaponry. Their fur and teeth were used as currency in the past. Some cultures still use their teeth as currency today.
