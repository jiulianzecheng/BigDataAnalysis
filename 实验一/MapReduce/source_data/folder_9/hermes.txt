 '''Hermes''' is the ''messenger of the gods''. He is the god of [[winter]], [[travel]]lers and [[shepherd]]s in [[Greek mythology]]. He is one of the [[Twelve Olympians]], and is often shown with his caduceus.  
 
 Hermes is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Maia]]. He was born on [[Mount Cyllene]]. The story of his birth was told in the [[Homeric Hymn]], which means ''Hymn to Hermes''. It said that [[Maia]] was a [[nymph]]. 
 
 Hermes was very clever and on his first day invented the [[lyre]], by using the [[Animal shell|shell]] of a [[tortoise]]. He carries a golden sword. One of the myths about Hermes is that he once stole his brother's oxen, and burned them as a sacrifice.
