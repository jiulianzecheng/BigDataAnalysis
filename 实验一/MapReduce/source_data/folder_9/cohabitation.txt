'''Cohabitation''' is an arrangement where people who are romantically or sexually attracted to each other live together, without being [[married]]. In most cases, the two people will be of opposite sex, but the term can also be used to describe [[same-sex relationship]]s. Cohabitation has become common in many countries. In these countries, a percentage of children are born outside marriage.
