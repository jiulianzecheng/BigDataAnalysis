 '''''Carnotaurus''''' was a [[predator]]y [[dinosaur]]. It lived 70 [[million]] [[year]]s ago on the [[Cretaceous period]]. It was a large [[Theropoda|theropod]] which lived in [[South America]]. Although there is only one well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the [[southern hemisphere]]. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the [[Chubut Province]] of Argentina. 
 
 ''Carnotaurus'' is a member of the [[Abelisauridae]], a group of large theropods. They lived only in the ancient southern [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. They were the dominant predators of the later Cretaceous of [[Gondwana]]. They occupied the [[ecological niche]] filled by the [[tyrannosaurid]]s in the northern continents. < ref name= " candeiro2005 " > Candeiro, Carlos Roberto dos Anjos  &  Martinelli, Agustín Guillermo. 2005.

 == Description == 
 ''Carnotaurus'' was a lightly built, [[biped]]al predator, {{convert|7.5|-|8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in length and weighing {{convert|1.3|-|2.1|MT|ST + LT}}. As a theropod, ''Carnotaurus'' was highly specialized and distinctive. It had thick horns above the eyes, a feature not seen in other carnivorous dinosaurs, and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck. Also, it had small, [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] forelimbs, smaller even than those of ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. 
 
 The remains include skin impressions showing a mosaic of small, non-overlapping [[scale (zoology)|scales]] about 5 & nbsp;mm in diameter. The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal, and there are no hints of feathers. < ref > Carrano, Matthew T.  &  Sampson, Scott D. 2008.

 The distinctive horns and muscular neck may have been used in fighting rivals of its own species. Rivals may have fought with quick head blows, by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls, or by ramming each other head-on, using their horns as shock absorbers. The feeding habits of ''Carnotaurus'' remain unclear. Some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as [[sauropod]]s, while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals. ''Carnotaurus'' was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods. 
 
 == Palaeoecology == 
 The animal lived in an [[environment]] of [[estuaries]], tidal flats or [[coast]]al plains. < ref name= " pascual2000 " > Pascual, Rosendo ''et al'' 2000. A highly derived docodont from the Patagonian late Cretaceous: evolutionary implications for Gondwanan mammals. ''Geodiversitas'' '''22''' (3): 395, 399–400. < /ref >  The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and [[humid]] periods. The most common vertebrates collected include  [[lungfish]], turtles, crocodiles, [[plesiosaur]]s, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Turtles are represented by at least five [[Taxon|taxa]]. In 2011, the discovery of a new [[enantiornithes|enantiornithine]] bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced. < ref > Lawver, Daniel R. ''et al'' 2011.

 == Media == 
 It appears in the movie ''[[Dinosaur (movie)|Dinosaur]]'' (2000), when two Carnotaurus were killing other species of [[Iguanodon]], [[Parasaurolophus]], [[Pachyrhinosaurus]] or [[Stygimoloch]]. And in ''[[Jurassic World 2: Fallen Kingdom]]'' (2018), when fighting a [[Sinoceratops]] and gets taken down by the iconic  " Rexy "  the [[Tyrannosaurus rex]]. Later on in the movie, it escapes the  " Lockwood Manor "  in [[Michael Crichton]]'s book  " The Lost World "  (1995)
