 '''Poole''' is a town in [[Dorset]], England. It is the second biggest town in Dorset after [[Bournemouth]]. In [[2001]], 138,299 people lived there. Lots of [[tourist|tourists]] visit Poole because of its nice [[beach|beaches]] and sunny weather. It has a very big natural [[harbour]]. Lots of people in Poole work for [[Barclays Bank]], [[Hamworthy Engineering]], [[Poole Packaging]], [[Sunseeker]], [[RNLI]] and [[Ryvita]]. 
 
 ==Harbour== 
 Poole's harbour is the second biggest natural harbour in the world after [[Sydney]] in [[Australia]] but the water in Poole is very shallow which means that very big ships cannot go into Poole Harbour. It was used in [[World War II]] for some ships to set off for [[France]] on [[D-Day]]. The harbour entrance is also the home to many millionaires being in the top 5 most expensive places to live in the world.  
 
 ==History== 
 People have lived in Poole for 2,000 years. There were lots of [[Celt]]ic people there. [[Archaeologist]]s found a [[boat]] in the [[harbor]] which they think was made in 295 BC. When the Romans invaded [[Britain]] in the [[1st century]], they landed in Poole. In the [[Norman Conquest]] in [[1066]], Poole was used mostly for [[fishing]] but then became a [[port]] for trading things like [[wool]]. In the [[18th century]], Poole was one of the biggest ports in [[England]]. 
 
 The harbor stopped being so useful because big boats could not get in, so they went to places like [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]], [[Southampton]] and [[Plymouth, Devon|Plymouth]]. Even though the harbor can not be used that well, due to the shallowness of the sea, it is very beautiful and peaceful for people.
