 Wulfstan (d.1023) is known to be an influential monk and a remarkable writer of homilies. < ref > Wilcox “Wulfstan”  < /ref >   
 
 It is speculated that he was born in York, not far from the Ship of the Fens, namely the Ely Cathedral. < ref name= " auto4 " > ''Medieval Histories'' “Archbishop Wulfstan of York” < /ref >  His date of birth remains a mystery to this day. It is also speculated that he was born into a family that owned lands < ref name= " auto4 " / >  which they lost upon the arrival of the Danish Warrior, King Cnut, in England in 1016. King Cnut is often described as the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history. < ref > Davidson “Who Was Danish Warrior King Cnut?” < /ref > 
 
 Wulfstan received a Benedictine education at Winchester < ref name= " auto4 " / >  (a foundation that houses the relics of the saint who founded Western monasticism in the 7th century). < ref name= " auto " > Duggan “WINCHESTER: The French Connection” < /ref >  Winchester became known as the center of the Benedictine reform in England in the late 10th century. < ref name= " auto " / >  Wulfstan was later elevated to bishop of London in 996-1002, and then he became the archbishop of York from 1002 to 1016. < ref > Wilcox “Wulfstan” < /ref >  Wulfstan was familiar with the Benedictine Reform movement. < ref > ''Medieval Histories'' “Archbishop Wulfstan of York”  < /ref >  This movement sought to free monasteries from secular control and to establish a more committed discipline among monks. < ref > Aethelwold, translated by Jacob Riyeff ''The Old English Rule of Saint Benedict: With Related Old English Texts'' < /ref >  Wulfstan was the student and the disciple of Æthelwold of Winchester, which allowed him to write The Life of St. Æthelwold in 1000. < ref > Wulfstan of Winchester ''The Life of St Æthelwold'' < /ref >   
 
 == Life == 
 Almost nothing is known about Wulfstan’s youth, only that part of his family probably lived in the Fenland area of the East Midlands. < ref name= " auto2 " > Catch ''Preaching and Theology in Anglo-Saxon England: Ælfric and Wulfstan'' p. 18 < /ref >  Because of his later career and association with the Benedictine Reform, < ref name= " auto2 " / >  he possibly once studied and worked as a Benedictine monk at Winchester. < ref > Knowles ''The Monastic Order in England: A History of its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' p. 64 < /ref >  In 996, he became the bishop of London. In 1002, he was elected Archbishop of York, and later he gained control over the district of Worcester. < ref > Smart “Archbishop Wulfstan and the importance of paying God his dues” p. 25  < /ref >    
 
 Wulfstan thought that the reign of king Æthelred was full of sin and he saw it as a period of failure. That is why he wanted to create new law codes to make things better. < ref > Neidorf “Archbishop Wulfstan's Ecclesiastical History of the English People” p. 207 < /ref >  Besides that, he also created laws for the Danish king Cnut, who took England’s throne in 1016. < ref > Mack “Changing Thengs: Cnut’s Conquest and the English Aristocracy” p. 380 < /ref >  He was an important person in England at that time, because of his control over the district of York. Wulfstan was also a prominent figure in the royal court since he was the legal craftsman for both Æthelred and Cnut.  
 
 == Church reform == 
 As a bishop – and later archbishop – Wulfstan was very active in church reform. He emphasized the importance of the church in the education of the people as well as in aiding the king. < ref name= " auto1 " > Gates “Preaching, politics and episcopal reform in Wulfstan's early writings” < /ref >  His religious efforts eventually started to include even secular matters, such as the legal writing mentioned earlier. This was partly to make sure that the church would still be able to interfere with secular matters. < ref name= " auto1 " / >    
 
 == Homilies == 
 Wulfstan is known as one of the most notable and unique Old English writers. < ref > Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 214 < /ref >   < ref > Orchard  " Wulfstan the Homilist "  ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 494–495  < /ref >  He was best known for his religious texts (homilies, sermons, religious canon) but also for political theory and writing of laws. Wulfstan was one of the two major writers in early 11th century England. His writing of religious text was influenced by Benedictine Reform - which tried to unite the rules for monks, including the promotion of regular life for priests and a strict church order. Wulfstan used his homilies to teach priests and monks.   
 
 Wulfstan’s homilies had a few specific details, his special rhythmical system being one of them. Wulfstan also used specific vocabulary and frequently repeating literary devices.   
 
 Wulfstan’s works were appreciated by people living at that time as well. Wulfstan’s works are so complex that they were impossible to be translated. Wulfstan knew his audience well, his works were written for an average English Christian. < ref > Bethurum ''Homilies of Wulfstan'' < /ref >  His writings were great in number, it is noted that he wrote over 30 sermons in Old English. < ref > Hall ''Wulfstan's Latin Sermons''  < /ref >    
 
 The motive of Wulfstan’s works was often religious, depicting the evil of the world before the second coming of Christ, a motive that can be seen in his work ''Evil Days''. One of his works, ''Secundum Lucam'', describes how terrible hell is.   
 
 His works were often influenced by the political situation at that time, addressing social instability.   
 
 Wulfstan influenced other writers of homilies. Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a work was actually written by Wulfstan < ref > Jost ''Wulfstanstudien'' p. 110–182 < /ref >  because they followed his composition and rhetoric. < ref > Rudolf “Wulfstan at Work” pp. 283-284 < /ref >  One of the most famous imitations was by Napier, < ref > Lionarons ''The Homiletic Writings of Archbishop Wulfstan'' p.14 < /ref >  as his works were essentially his version of Wulfstan’s homilies. One important fact to note is that even though Wulfstan’s works are often referred to as homilies, they are actually in fact sermons since Wulfstan does not present his ideas phrase by phrase, he only uses a general theme for his sermon.  
 
 == Language and style == 
 Wulfstan was a native speaker of Old English, specifically the West-Saxon dialect. < ref > Rudolf “Wulfstan at Work” p. 271 < /ref >  He also spoke Latin and Old Norse (which was brought to England by people of Scandinavian origin).   
 
 Wulfstan wrote most of his works in Old English. Other works he wrote in Latin. In his writing, there are some particular words that no other author used. Old English words that are exclusive to Wulfstan’s works are: ''sibleger'' ‘incest’, ''tōfēsian'' ‘to rout’, ''ægylde'' ‘uncompensated’, and ''morðwyrhta'' ‘murderer’. < ref > Whitelock ''Sermo Lupi Ad Anglos''  < /ref >  {{Efn|for definitions, use, and occurrences of Old English words refer to: Bosworth, Joseph. An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary Online, edited by Thomas Northcote Toller et al., Faculty of Arts, Charles University, 2014, https://bosworthtoller.com}} 
 [[File:Sermo Lupi.jpg|thumb|A page from a Wulfstan manuscript at the British Library (MS Cott., Nero A.i): '''''Sermo Lupi ad Anglos''' quando Dani maxime persecuti sunt eos quod fuit anno millesimo XIIII ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesus Christi'']] 
 Wulfstan’s unique words of Scandinavian origin are: ''þræl'' ‘slave, servant’ (Old Norse ''þræll'', Old English ''þēow''), ''bōnda'' ‘husband, peasant’ (Old Norse ''bóndi'', Old English ''ceorl''), ''eorl'' ‘nobleman of highest rank’ (Old Norse ''jarl'', Old English ''ealdormann''). Those words are related to the topic of social classes. < ref > Pons-Sanz “Norse-Derived Vocabulary in Late Old English Texts” pp. 58, 61, 161  < /ref >  {{Efn|for definitions, use, and occurrences of Old English words refer to: Bosworth, Joseph. An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary Online, edited by Thomas Northcote Toller et al., Faculty of Arts, Charles University, 2014, https://bosworthtoller.com}} {{Efn|for definitions, use, and occurrences of Old Norse words refer to: Cleasby  &  Vigfusson Old dictionary, 1874, https://cleasby-vigfusson-dictionary.vercel.app}}Another important word is ''lagu'' ‘divine law’ (Old Norse ''lag'', Old English ''ǣw''). < ref > Kubouchi “Wulfstan’s Scandinavian Loanword Usage” p. 144 < /ref >  {{Efn|for definitions, use, and occurrences of Old English words refer to: Bosworth, Joseph. An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary Online, edited by Thomas Northcote Toller et al., Faculty of Arts, Charles University, 2014, https://bosworthtoller.com}} {{Efn|for definitions, use, and occurrences of Old Norse words refer to: Cleasby  &  Vigfusson Old dictionary, 1874, https://cleasby-vigfusson-dictionary.vercel.app}}  
 
 Wulfstan is known for his recognizable writing style. Wulfstan plays with sounds in his prose. He uses alliteration (repetition of sounds at the beginning of two or more successive words). Two-stress rhythm is very typical for him. Wulfstan often repeats distinctive collocations (''unrihta fela'' ‘much unlawfulness’) and rhyming binominals (two words linked by conjunction, for example ''stalu and cwalu'' ‘theft and murder’, wær and wis ‘aware and wise’), intensifiers (''swyðe þearle'' ‘very severely’). < ref > Rudolf “Wulfstan at Work” p. 272 < /ref >  His style is close to Old English poetry. He uses punctuation to make sure his texts can be read aloud easily. < ref > Lapidge ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 352, 384, 390, 515 < /ref >    
 
 Some of his works can be recognized through his handwriting and text organization. In his homilies, he uses wide margins. His writing is perfectly aligned on the left side. < ref > Rudolf “Wulfstan at Work” < /ref >   
 
 == Works == 
 Wulfstan used the Latin pen-name Lupus (‘wolf’) in many of his works. There are other works that are recognized as his because of his unique writing style. Twenty-six sermons are recognized as Wulfstan’s based on his style. < ref name= " auto3 " > Orchard “Wulstan the Homilist” pp. 514-515 < /ref >   
 
 The four categories of Wulfstan’s works are: homilies, legal texts, philosophical texts, and poetry.  
 
 The Homilies focus on themes such as: eschatology (study of the end of the world, specifically related to Christianity in Wulfstan’s works), the afterlife, the Judgement Day, and the Antichrist theme (Wulfstan warns about fake Christ wanting to seduce men). Wulfstan wanted to warn about possible corruptions of faith. He also encouraged loving God. < ref > Gatch ''Preaching and Theology in Anglo-Saxon England: AElfric and Wulfstan'' pp. 105-110 < /ref >        
 
 Some of Wulfstan’s legal texts are law handbooks about the laws during the reigns of different rulers. His ''The Institutes of Polity'' analyses the roles of the state and the Church. < ref name= " auto3 " / >   
 
 Wulfstan collected books and texts. He put many of those texts together into a collection called Wulfstan’s ''Commonplace Book''. This collection is divided into 10 blocks. Each block focuses on one theme. < ref > Elliot “Wulfstan’s Commonplace Book Revised” pp. 9-10  < /ref >  For example ''[[:en:Collectio_canonum_Wigorniensis|Wulfstan's Canon Law Collection]]'' contains the laws related to Christian Church.
