 The company began in 1865 as a wood pulp mill in Finland and began making paper. The paper was sold to [[Russia]], the UK, and [[France]]. The company merged with the Finnish Rubber Company which wanted to use its [[hydroelectricity]] plant. After World War Two, Nokia bought a large part of the Finnish Cable Works. In 1967 the three companies joined to form the Nokia Group.

 In 2011, Nokia and [[Microsoft]] began a partnership which created [[Nokia Lumia]], a series of [[smartphone]]s that use the [[Windows Phone]] operating system and was meant to replace [[Symbian]] as the OS on Nokia's smartphones. Not many of these phones were sold and because of this, Nokia was losing money. Finally, in 2013, Microsoft bought out Nokia's mobile phone business, which became a division of Microsoft called [[Microsoft Mobile]]. Microsoft continued to make [[feature phone]]s with the Nokia brand, but began using the Microsoft brand for its Lumia [https://bdtodayus.blogspot.com/2020/09/Nokia%207.3%20Leaked%20in%20India.html smartphones]. Nokia's other phones, including the [[Nokia X]] which used [[Android (operating system)|Android]], were discontinued, or no longer made.
