 A '''nocturne''' is a piece of [[music]], usually for [[piano]], which suggests the night (“nocturnal” means “of the night”).  The [[Ireland|Irish]] [[composer]] [[John Field]] was the first person to make nocturnes popular.  He was inspired by the slow, gentle tunes of [[Italy|Italian]] [[opera]]s of his time (early [[19th century]]).  His nocturnes are mostly tunes with many long notes in the right hand over.
