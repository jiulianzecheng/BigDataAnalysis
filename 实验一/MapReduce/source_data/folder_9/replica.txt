 A '''replica''' is an [[wikt:exact|exact]] (usually [[1:1]] in [[scale]]) copy of something, made out of the same [[raw material]]s. Replicas could be made of a [[molecule]], [[art]], or a [[product]]. The term is also used for copies that look very much like the original, without saying they are the same. 
 
 Replicas have been sometimes sold as originals. This is a type of [[fraud]]. Most replicas are not made to do this. [[wikt:fragile|Fragile]] originals need [[protection]], while people can look at a replica in a [[museum]]. Replicas are often sold as [[souvenir]]s.
