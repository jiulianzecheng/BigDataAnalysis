 '''Dissection means  to cut open the animal in order to ascertain the structure of it parts. Dissection''' is a standard [[laboratory]] technique in [[biology]] and [[pathology]]. To dissect is to cut up a body so as to reveal its [[structure]]. The body could be that of a human, an animal, or a plant. Dissections are regularly done in [[Autopsy|autopsies]] to help determine the cause of [[death]]. They are done by [[Zoology|zoologists]] to find out the internal structure of animal bodies. The [[comparative anatomy]] of animals, revealed by dissections, gives clues as to their [[evolution]]ary relationships.
