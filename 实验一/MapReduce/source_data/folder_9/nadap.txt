 The [[village]] of '''Nadap''' lies on the eastern slopes of [[Velencei Hills]], it is a well oriented, self-contained settlement, with charming rural atmosphere. It is only two kilometers both from the recreation facilities of [[Lake Velencei]] and from the M7 motorway, therefore it is easily accessible from [[Budapest]] and from [[Székesfehérvár]], too. Each house in the settlement has a great panorama.

 The settlements around [[Lake Velencei]] are overwhelmed with the spirit of [[Mihály Vörösmarty]]. Nadap is not different either, the poet was baptised in the [[village]] on [[3 December]] [[1800]]. The baptistery is still in the church today. The inhabitants of the village expressed their admiration for the memory of the poet with a sculpture erected in the Millenium Park. 
 
 Nadap also hosts a key cartographical and architectural specialty; it is the home of the etalon for measuring heights in [[Hungary]], called Nadapi szintezési ősjegy (Levelling mark of Nadap).
