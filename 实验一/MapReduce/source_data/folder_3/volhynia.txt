 ==Early history== 
 [[File:Ukraine-Volhyn-en.png|thumb|right|A [[map]] of Volhynia (in [[yellow]]) in modern Ukraine.]] In the 16th century, with the 1569 [[Treaty of Lublin]], Volhynia became a largely [[Autonomy|self-governing]] part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], keeping its [[Ukrainian]] character but having its elite become [[Poland|Polish]], or Polonized. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  Most of Volhynia was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in the late [[18th century]] due to the [[partitions of Poland]]. But Austria also got to annex a small part of Volhynia during this time. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / > 
 ==19th century== 
 In the early [[19th century]], Volhynia was still dominated by its Polish [[nobility]]. They continued to rule over the Ukrainian [[peasants]] who lived there. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  Volhynia experienced a [[Russification]] program in the 19th century and did not get to experience the Ukrainian national awakening that was going on in neighboring [[Galicia]] during this time. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >   
 ==20th century== 
 After the end of [[World War I]], Volhynia was partitioned between [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], with western Volhynia becoming a part of Poland and eastern Volhynia becoming a part of the Soviet Union, specifically a part of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  Volhynia experienced a Ukrainianization movement in the 1920s but a lot of its notable Ukrainian intellectuals were later [[murdered]] in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the late 1930s. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >   
 ===World War II=== 
 In 1939, at the start of [[World War II]], the Soviet Union conquered and annexed western Volhynia. It used to belong to Poland before that point in time. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  When [[Nazi Germany]] invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] in 1941, Volhynia came under Nazi German rule for several years. Almost all of the [[Jews]] who were not evacuated by the Soviet Union ahead of time were murdered by the Nazis in the [[Holocaust]]. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >   
 ===After WWII=== 
 When the Soviet Union won World War II and got Volhynia back from the Nazis. Almost all of Volhynia's [[Germans]] and [[Volhynian Czechs|Czechs]] emigrated, in the former case to [[Germany]] and in the latter case to [[Czechoslovakia]]. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  In addition, after the end of World War II, a lot of the Poles in eastern Volhynia switched residences with the Ukrainians in western Volhynia. This made both eastern Volhynia and western Volhynia much more ethnically homogeneous. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >  Volhynia also saw some Russians and Belarusians move there during the time that it was under Soviet rule. This increased the populations of these two groups in Volhynia. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >   
 ===Statistics=== 
 Volhynia was historically [[agricultural]], with there being little [[industry]] there, especially in its western part. At the start of the 1930s, 78% of Volhynians worked in [[agriculture]] and only 8% in industry. In 1987, 52% of Volhynians still lived in [[rural]] areas, with most of these people still making a living based on agriculture during this time. < ref name =  " ukrEnc " / >
