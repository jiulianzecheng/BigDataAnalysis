'''Limnology''' is the study of waters that are not part of the [[ocean|oceans]] or [[sea|seas]]. This includes [[river|rivers]], [[lake|lakes]], [[swamp|swamps]], streams, wetlands, water under the ground, and even bodies of water made by people. [[Scientist]]s who study this are called ''limnologists''. Their work includes [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[hydrology]]. 
 The ''International Society of Limnology''  promotes limnology to  scientists throughout the world. There are many centres for such research throughout the world. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.limnology.org/index.shtml |title=The International Society for Limnology |access-date=2010-12-04 |archive-date=2011-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104074836/http://www.limnology.org/index.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 Limnology helps to explain why some lakes have lots of plants and animals and some have very few.  The [[Freshwater Biological Association]] which is based next to [[Windermere]] in [[England]] did a lot of the early work. Limnologists there worked out why deep lakes have cold water at the bottom in summer-time but not in Winter. The reason was that winds in Autumn mix the waters up.
