The word '''cartoon''' has been used in several different ways. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cartoons and Cartoon Illustrations|url=https://www.bigredillustrationagency.com/cartoon-illustrations/|access-date=|website=|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Types of cartoons==

 ===Cartoon for an artwork=== 
 The oldest meaning is a drawing that is a full-sized design for a finished artwork. The cartoon might be a drawing for a painting that was going to be put onto a wall or ceiling in [[fresco]]. The cartoon would be pinned against the wall and its design marked onto the plastered of the wall. Cartoons were also made to design [[tapestry]]. The most famous cartoons of this kind are a set by [[Raphael]] which show the  " Life of St Peter " . The cartoons are in the [[Victoria  &  Albert Museum]]. The finished tapestries belong to the [[Vatican]] and were made for the [[Sistine Chapel]]. 
 
 ===Political cartoon===

 In the 1700s, artists such as [[William Hogarth]] often made sets of [[humour|humorous]] (funny) drawings that were about political subjects, such as [[poverty]], [[election]]s, [[war]] and [[riot]]s. The drawings were made into [[printing|prints]] and were sold cheaply. These prints were not called cartoons at that time, but they led to the idea of modern political cartoons in newspapers.  
 
 Nowadays many [[newspaper]]s publish a different political cartoon in the paper, every day. The word  " cartoon "  was first used in this way in 1843 in an English magazine called ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. < ref > {{cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|access-date=2008-11-04|archive-date=2007-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013522/http://www.punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 A political cartoon does not always show real people. Sometimes it may use a [[personification]] of a [[country]] or organization as a person, an animal, or a monster. For example, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] might be shown as a woman holding a baby [[Australia]] in her arms. [[Russia]] might be shown as a baby [[bear]] or a [[dolphin]]. The [[United States]] might be shown as a [[Bald Eagle]]. 
 
 ===Comic strips===  
 
 Political cartoons were often drawn to show several different stages of the same story. Many of Hogarth's famous political cartoons do this. From this came the idea of telling funny stories in a series of pictures. [[Comic strip|Comic strips]] are a type of  " cartoon "  that is published in newspapers, but they are usually just called  " comic strips " .  
 
 [[Comic book]]s assemble many strips in a book. The book may tell a long story, longer than a newspaper would want to print, or several stories.  
 
 Comic strips posted on the [[internet]] are '''web comics'''. Some use [[animation]] and [[sound]] for special effects. Like comic books they may be large, and most offer a large collection of earlier strips for new readers, so longer stories can be told. Many [[Webcomic|webcomics]] are published (shown to people) by independent artists. 
 
 ===Movie Cartoons===  
 * ''Main article:'' [[Animated cartoon]] 
 
 From the beginning of the [[movie]] industry, some artists began experimenting with making drawings that seemed to move. These moving drawings also became known as  " cartoons " . They often depict animals rather than humans. They were often just for fun, but sometimes, particularly during [[World War II]], were used for political reasons, just like the cartoons in newspapers.  
 
 At first, movie cartoons were quite short. When a person bought a movie ticket, they would see a news program, two or three cartoons in black and white and a movie. [[Walt Disney]] then got the idea to tell a long story as a  " cartoon " . The first example made was ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 movie)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937). Movie cartoons soon became a popular type of entertainment. Modern movie cartoons are sometimes created using computer graphics, rather than hand-drawn cartoons. The popular stars of animated cartoons include [[Tom and Jerry]], [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]].
