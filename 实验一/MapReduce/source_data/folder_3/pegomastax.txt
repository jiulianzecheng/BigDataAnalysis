 '''''Pegomastax''''' ( " strong jaw " ) is a [[genus]] of small [[heterodontosauridae|heterodontosaur]] [[dinosaur]] discovered in [[Lower Jurassic]] rocks in [[South Africa]]. It is [[holotype|based on]] a [[skull]] in the Iziko South African Museum in [[Cape Town]].  
 
 It was collected during a 1966–1967 expedition but not named and described until recently. [[Paul Sereno]], who had recognized it as unusual in the 1980s, published a description in 2012. The [[type species]] is ''P. africana''. ''Pegomastax'' differed from other heterodontosaurs by details of the skull. The lower jaw was robust, with a short beak. Like most other heterodontosaurs, ''Pegomastax'' had an enlarged [[canine tooth|canine]]-like tooth at the beginning of the lower jaw's tooth row, which may have been used for defence. < ref > {{cite journal |first1=Paul C. |last1=Sereno |year=2012 |title=Taxonomy, morphology, masticatory function and phylogeny of heterodontosaurid dinosaurs |journal=ZooKeys |issue=226 |pages=1–225 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.226.2840 |pmid=23166462 |pmc=3491919 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  The rest of its teeth were those of a [[herbivore]]. < ref > ''BBC News: Science  &  Environment''.
