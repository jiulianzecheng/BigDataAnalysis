 A '''seismometer''' or '''seismograph''' is an instrument that measures motions of the ground, including those  generated by [[earthquake]]s, [[nuclear explosion]]s and other sources.  
 
 Records of seismic waves called [[seismogram]]s allow us to map the interior of the [[Earth]], and to find and measure the size of those different sources. < ref > {{cite book | last = Richter | first = C.F. | title = Elementary Seismology | place = San Francisco | publisher = W.H.

 The word derives from the [[Greek_language|Greek]] word, ''seismós'', a shaking or quake, from the verb σείω, ''seíō'', to shake; and μέτρον, ''métron'', measure.  
 
 The technique of using a seismometer to build up a picture of the Earth's interior is called '''seismic tomography'''. < ref > Nolet, Guust (ed) 1987. ''Seismic tomography: seismology and exploration geophysics''. Springer Netherlands. ISBN 9789027725837 < /ref >
