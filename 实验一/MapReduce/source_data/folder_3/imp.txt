 An '''imp''' is a [[mythology|mythological]] creature similar to a [[fairy]] or [[demon]], usually described in [[folklore]] and [[superstition]]. 
 
 Imps are usually described as [[wikt:mischief|mischievous]] more than a serious threat, and as lesser creatures, not important supernatural beings. The small helpers who attend the [[devil]] are sometimes described as imps. They are usually described as small and very active. 
 
 Imps were the common name given to [[familiar]] [[spirit]]s that served [[witch]]es in the [[Middle Ages]]. Imps were usually kept inside artifacts such as [[gemstone]] pieces or [[vials]] and summoned for service with [[magic]].
