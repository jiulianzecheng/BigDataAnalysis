 A '''sawfly''' is an [[insect]] belonging to suborder '''Symphyta''' of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Hymenoptera]]. The sawflies are a group of largely plant-eating ([[Herbivore|herbivorous]]) insects. The group is less specialised than the [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s. 
 
 Sawflies differ from most other Hymenoptera by their broad connection between the [[abdomen]] and the [[thorax]], and by their caterpillar-like larvae. The common name comes from the saw-like appearance of the [[ovipositor]], which the females use to cut into the plants where they lay their eggs. Large populations of certain sawfly species may cause  [[economic]] damage to [[forest]]s and cultivated plants.  
 
 As of 2013, the Symphyta are treated as nine [[Superfamily|superfamilies]] (one extinct) and 25 families. Most sawflies belong to the Tenthredinoidea superfamily, with about 7,000 species worldwide. Tenthredinoidea has six families, of which [[Tenthredinidae]] is by far the largest with some 5,500 species. < ref name= " Aguiar_et_al_2013 " > {{cite journal|last=Aguiar A.P.|display-authors=etal|title=Order Hymenoptera ''In'': Zhang Z.-Q.

 == Xyelidae == 
 The '''Xyelidae''' is a small family of [[sawflies]] known from fewer than 50 living [[species]] in five [[genera]], with an extensive [[fossil]] record. They are the oldest fossil [[Hymenoptera]], dating back to the [[Triassic]], some 200 million years ago.  
 
 Most species occur in the Northern hemisphere, especially in [[taiga|boreal]] regions, though there are a few neo[[tropical]] species. Most are associated with [[conifer]]s (esp. ''[[Pinus]]'' and ''[[Abies]]''), where the [[larva]]e feed on [[pollen]] or within buds, though larvae of a few species feed on the leaves of [[deciduous]] trees.
