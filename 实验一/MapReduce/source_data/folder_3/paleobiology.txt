 '''Paleobiology''' is a branch of [[science]] which studies [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[microbe]]s  buried in [[Rock (geology)|rock]].  These [[stone]]y items are called [[fossil]]s. Paleobiology  combines [[biology]] with the study of these fossils. There are several branches of paleobiology: 
 
 * [[Paleobotany]] – Study of ancient [[plant]]s 
 * [[Paleozoology]] 
 * [[Micropaleobiology]] 
 * [[Paleobiochemistry]] 
 * [[Paleoecology]] – Uses fossils to learn about how the [[environment]] was long ago 
 * [[Taphonomy]] 
 * [[Paleoichnology]] 
 * [[Stratigraphic paleobiology]] 
 * [[Evolutionary developmental paleobiology]] – Studies how animals changed over time 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Baron]] [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás]] started paleobiology in the late 19th century while working at the [[University of Vienna]]. He tried to learn how the animals lived, rather than merely put together their [[bone]]s, as many [[geologist]]s were doing at the time.
