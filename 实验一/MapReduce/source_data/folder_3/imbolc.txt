 '''Imbolc''' is a [[festival]] belonging to [[Brigid]], the [[Celt]]ic [[deity|goddess]] who, in later times, became famous as a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]]. Her festival on [[February]] 1 or 2 was known as  " Imbolc "  or  " Oimelc " .  " Imbolc "  or  " Imbolg "  means 'in the belly' - bol meaning belly in Welsh and bolg meaning belly in Irish Gaelic - refers to the pregnant ewes.  " Oimelc "  [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] refers to the [[lactation]] of the [[sheep|ewe]]s. Lactation is the flow of [[milk]] that happens when the baby [[lamb]]s are born in the [[spring]], and Gaelic languages are those spoken in countries like Ireland and [[Scotland]]. 
 
 Imbolc was, and still is, a time to celebrate that [[winter]] would soon be over. Sometimes in [[Ireland]], the first flowers are coming up at the time of this festival, even when there is still [[snow]] on the ground. 
 
 Later, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] replaced this festival with [[Candlemas]] Day on February 2, a day that now belongs to the [[Virgin Mary]]. On this day, people may have ceremonies or [[procession]]s  by [[candlelight]] - walking together in the dark, with the only light coming from candles they carry. The may also sing [[song]]s to Brigid, or say [[poem]]s or [[prayer]]s to her. 
 
 In both [[Polytheism|Pagan]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] celebrations, Brigid is celebrated as a powerful [[female]] figure, who brings [[light]], [[inspiration]], and [[healing]] to the world.
