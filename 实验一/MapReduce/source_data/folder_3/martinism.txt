 '''Martinism''' is a form of [[Christian]] [[mysticism]] following with the fall of the first man, his state of material [[divine]] source, and the process of his return, called 'Reintegration' or illumination. 
 
 As a mystical tradition, it was first transmitted through a [[masonic]] system created around 1740 in France by [[Martinez de Pasqually]], and later propagated in different forms by his two students [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Willermoz]]. < ref name=Treatise > {{cite book|last=De Pasqually|first=Martinez|title=Treatise on the Reintegration of Beings Into Their Original Estate, Virtues and Powers Both Spiritual and Divine|date=1775|isbn=0955480809|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15200926/De-Pasqually-Martinez-Treatise-of-the-Reintegration-of-Beings|access-date=12 February 2014|archive-date=23 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223122928/http://www.scribd.com/doc/15200926/De-Pasqually-Martinez-Treatise-of-the-Reintegration-of-Beings|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
