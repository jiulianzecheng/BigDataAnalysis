 == Moses' helper == 
 Aaron spoke for Moses, when he went to tell Pharaoh the King of Egypt everything God wanted Moses to say. The Lord said to Moses (Exodus 7:1 to 3),  " See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country... " . 
 
 === Aaron's staff===

 Aaron's staff was used by the [[God in Judaism|Lord]] a few times when trying to persuade the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go. The [[God in Judaism|Lord]] ordered Moses and Aaron,  " When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh', and it will become a [[snake]]. "  So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and Aaron did so. Aaron's staff, according to the Bible, really became a snake and ate up all the other snakes that the Pharaoh's magicians had made. Also, Aaron's staff was used to make the Nile River all turn into blood. He  " stretched it out " , and the fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled; and the Egyptians could not drink the water, as it was recorded in the Bible.
