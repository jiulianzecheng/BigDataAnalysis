 '''''Elckerlijc''''' (also known as '''''Elckerlyc''''') is a [[morality play]] from the [[Low Countries]]. It was written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] around the year 1470.  It was first printed in 1495. The play did very well and may have been the source for the [[English language|English]] play ''[[Everyman (15th-century play)|Everyman]]''. [[Peter van Diest]] is usually considered the [[author]] of the play.

 The play won the first [[prize]] in a [[theater]] [[contest]] in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. < ref name=Davidson / >   It stresses the [[didactic]] message. It uses [[allegory]] of the hero as an  " everyman "  (a normal person) and is written in [[Rederijker]] style. 
 
 Dutch and English [[historian]]s talked for [[decade]]s about whether the English play ''Everyman'' was based on ''Elckerljic'', or whether ''Elckerljic'' was based on ''Everyman''. The most common view is that the Dutch-language version was the original. < ref name=Davidson > {{Cite web|title = Introduction|url = http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/davidson-everyman-introduction|website = Everyman and Its Dutch Original, Elckerlijc|access-date = 2016-02-19|publisher = Robbins Library Digital Projects, University of Rochester|editor-last = Davidson|editor2-last = Walsh|editor3-last = Broos|editor-first = Clifford|editor2-first = Martin W.|editor3-first = Ton J.|date = 2007}} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.dbnl.org/thema/elckerlijc.php Geert Warnar, ''Elckerlijc, Toneel, tekst en beeld van ca. 1500 tot nu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230103225250/https://www.dbnl.org/thema/elckerlijc.php |date=2023-01-03 }} {{in lang|nl}} < /ref >
