'''Whitehawk''' is a suburb of [[Brighton]] in the city of [[Brighton and Hove]] on [[England]]'s south coast. It consists of a large housing estate developed by the council in the 1930s. In the late 1960s, five high rise flats were built in the suburb's northern end, known as the Swanborough flats. Beginning in the late 1970s, a major redevelopment of the estate took place. The estate lies in a valley and is partly surrounded by Brighton's Race Course. Whitehawk is the name given to a [[Neolithic]] [https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/leisure-and-libraries/parks-and-green-spaces/whitehawk-camp camp] situated at the top of Whitehawk Hill. The camp was inhabited some 5500 years ago.
