 '''QRpedia''' is a web system for mobile devices, like mobile phones. It uses [[QR code]]s to show  [[Wikipedia]] articles to people. The articles are shown in the user's own language. < ref name= " EdenT-1 " > {{cite web|url=http://shkspr.mobi/blog/index.php/2011/04/introducing-qrpedia/|title=Introducing QRpedia|last=Eden|first=Terence|date=2011-04-03|accessdate=25 August 2011}} < /ref > < ref name= " CmoI " > {{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/Childrens-Museum-Indianapolis-Creates-New-Learning-Opportunities-through-Wikipedian-in-Residence|title=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Creates New Learning Opportunities through Wikipedian-in-Residence|last=Anon|date=2011-08-19|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=25 August 2011|archive-date=2012-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329035310/http://www.childrensmuseum.org/Childrens-Museum-Indianapolis-Creates-New-Learning-Opportunities-through-Wikipedian-in-Residence|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Process == 
 A user uses their [[mobile device]] to scan a QRpedia QR code. The device decodes the QR code into a [[URL|web address]]. The address has the [[domain name]]  " qrwp.org " . The last part of the web address is the title of a Wikipedia article. 
 
 The device sends a request for the article to the QRpedia [[server|web server]]. It also transmits the name of the language used by the device. < ref name= " ByrdPhillips-2 " > {{cite web|url=http://midea.nmc.org/2011/06/qrpedia/|title=Going Multilingual with QRpedia|last=Byrd Phillips|first=Lori|date=2011-06-15|publisher=[[Marcus Institute for Digital Education in the Arts]]|accessdate=25 August 2011|archive-date=2012-08-26|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ACwdLuzA?url=http://midea.nmc.org/2011/06/qrpedia/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The QRpedia server then uses Wikipedia's [[Application programming interface|API]] < ref name= " EdenT-1 "  / >  to find out if there is a version of the specified Wikipedia article in the language used by the device. If there is, it sends back the article in a mobile-friendly format. < ref name= " ByrdPhillips-2 "  / >  If there is no translation of the requested article, then the QRpedia server offers a choice of the available languages. It also offers a Google translation. 
 
 In this way, a single QRcode can be used to find the same article, in many languages. < ref name= " ByrdPhillips-2 "  / >  QRpedia also records usage statistics. < ref name= " ByrdPhillips-2 "  / > < ref name= " Stats " > {{cite web|url=http://qrwp.org/stats.php?path=QRpedia|title=QRpedia Statistics (example)|accessdate=12 December 2011|archive-date=13 July 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713074153/http://qrwp.org/stats.php?path=QRpedia|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

The article is, as of August 2011, available in 30 languages. The languages Arabic, Catalan, Esperanto, German, Greek, Japanese, Turkish and Vietnamese.]] 
 
 QRpedia was invented by Roger Bamkin, < ref name= " EdenT-1 "  / >  then chairman of [[Wikimedia UK]], < ref name= " Board " > {{cite web|url=http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/Board|title=Board|work=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|publisher=[[Wikimedia UK]]|accessdate=25 August 2011}} < /ref >  and Terence Eden. < ref name= " EdenT-1 "  / >  who is a mobile web consultant. < ref name= " Imperica "  / >  It was unveiled on 9 April 2011 < ref name= " EdenT-1 "  / >  It was unveiled at Derby Museum's ''Backstage Pass'' event. < ref name= " EdenT-1 "  / > < ref name= " Imperica " > {{cite web|url=http://www.imperica.com/features/quiet-realities|title=Quiet Realities|last=Anon|date=2011-05-21|work=Imperica|accessdate=25 August 2011|archive-date=2011-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529035213/http://www.imperica.com/features/quiet-realities|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The event was part of the GLAM/Derby collaboration between [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] and Wikipedia. < ref name= " BSP " > {{cite web|url=http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/Derby_Backstage_Pass|title=Derby Backstage Pass|last=Various|work=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|publisher=[[Wikimedia UK]]|accessdate=25 August 2011}} < /ref >  During the collaboration, over 500 Wikipedia articles were also created. The articles were in several languages. The project's name is a made-up word, using the initials  " QR "  from  " QR ('''Q'''uick '''R'''esponse) code "  and  " pedia "  from  " Wiki'''pedia''' " .
