 The '''uterus''' or '''womb''' is part of the [[Human reproductive system|reproductive system]] of the [[female]] [[body]]. The uterus is the place a baby grows for nine months during [[pregnancy]].  It is a pear-shaped [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] inside a woman. It is behind the [[bladder]] and in front of the [[rectum]]. The uterus weighs 70 grams. < ref name= " :1 " > {{cite book|last=Williams|first=J|title=Williams obstetrics|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education Medical|location=New York|year=2018|isbn=9781259644320|pages=49–50}} < /ref >  The endometrium is the tissue that lines the uterus. A hormone called [[Oestrogen|estrogen]] makes the [[endometrium]] thick with [[blood]] and fluid. This uterine lining gives the growing baby what it needs to grow. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.girlshealth.gov/body/reproductive/system.html|title=How the female reproductive system works {{!}} girlshealth.gov|website=www.girlshealth.gov|access-date=2018-08-17}}{{PD-notice}} < /ref >  The [[endometrium]] leaves the uterus as the monthly flow of blood ([[menstruation]]). The endometrium will form again. This happens every 28 days. The number of days can be different for each woman. The fertilized egg will move through the [[fallopian tube]] and into the uterus. It will then attach to the endometrium. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 The uterus is part the female reproductive system. Other structures and organs that are part of the reproduction system are the vagina, ovaries and fallopian tubes. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/uterine/uterine-cancer/the-uterus/?region=on|title=The uterus - Canadian Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-08-25}} < /ref > 
 
 The uterus has four main parts. The fundus is the upper part of the uterus. It has a rounded shape. Another part of the uterus is the body. The uterotubal angles are the parts connected to the Fallopian tubes. The bottom part of the uterus is the cervix. < ref name= " :4 "  / >  The uterus has three layers. The outer layer is called the perimetrium. < ref > Another name for the perimetrium is serosa. < /ref >  It is a thin layer that surrounds the outside of the uterus. The perimetrium is made of tissue made of epithelial cells. The middle layer is the myometrium. Most of the uterus is made up of the myometrium. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite journal|date=2016-10-28|title=Uterus Anatomy: Overview|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1949215-overview|publisher=Medscape}} < /ref >  The layer on the inside is the endometrium. The endometrium is made of secretory, ciliated, and basal cells. < ref name= " :4 "  / >  The uterus is not in the same place for all women. It is tilted forward in most women. Other women have a uterus that tilts up or backwards. < ref name= " :4 " > {{cite book | last = Miftahof | first = Roustem | title = Biomechanics of the gravid human uterus | url = https://archive.org/details/biomechanicsgrav00mift | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg | year = 2011 | isbn = 9783642214721 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/biomechanicsgrav00mift/page/n19 1]-14 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2016-10-28|title=Uterus Anatomy: Natural Variants|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1949215-overview#a3|publisher=Medscape}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2016-10-28|title=Uterus Anatomy: Natural Variants|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1949215-overview?pa=kurqjiRsN1xmElgS6Hyrk4aV/U92tMdmToiSnV2g87qGtx7bLAHy2Olshoz4hceDLCEJNCrbkqLWYvqLrhntWA==#a3}} < /ref > 
 
 The uterus is supplied by [[blood vessel]]s. Blood travels to the uterus through [[Artery|arteries]]. The big arteries are the internal iliac arteries. The big arteries branch off into smaller arteries called the ovarian artery and the uterine artery. The smaller arteries give blood to all the layers of the uterus. The blood returns to the heart and lungs through the [[vein]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=2016-10-28|title=Uterus Anatomy: Gross Anatomy|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1949215-overview#a2|publisher=Medscape}} < /ref > 
 
 The uterus is held in place by ligaments. These are the anterior, posterior, lateral, uterosacral, and round [[Ligament|ligaments.]] The position of the uterus can vary depending on the contents of the bladder. < ref name= " :4 "  / > 
 
 The uterus changes during the life of a woman. It is inactive during [[childhood]] and old age. During the time that a woman or girl can have a baby it is a very active organ. It does many things. It is where menstruation begins, it is the place where the fertilized ovum attaches, it is the place where the baby grows, it is the strong muscle that pushes the baby out during birth. < ref name= " :3 "  / > 
 
 == Tumors == 
 [[Cancer]] can form in the uterus. But this is not common. There are two types of [[uterine cancer]].  These are [[endometrial cancer]] and uterine sarcoma. Endometrial cancer can grow from cells lining the uterus. Uterine sarcoma is a rare cancer that grows from cells in the [[smooth muscle]] of the uterus. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}{{PD-notice}} < /ref >  Other tumors can grow in the uterus that are not cancer. One of these is a Uterine fibroid. < ref name= " :5 " > {{Cite journal|date=2016-10-28|title=Uterus Anatomy: Pathophysiologic Variants|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1949215-overview?pa=kurqjiRsN1xmElgS6Hyrk4aV/U92tMdmToiSnV2g87qGtx7bLAHy2Olshoz4hceDLCEJNCrbkqLWYvqLrhntWA==#a4}} < /ref >

 == Pregnancy == 
 The uterus changes during pregnancy. It grows with the baby. It also has fluid and the [[placenta]] inside. It starts small but it becomes very large. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894626609|title=Health  &  physical assessment in nursing|last=Donita|first=D'Amico|publisher=Pearson|others=Barbarito, Colleen|year=2015|isbn=9780133876406|edition=3rd |location=Boston|pages=798–9|oclc=894626609}} < /ref >  It can hold as much as five to twenty liters. The uterus is made of smooth muscle called the myometrium.  The cells of the myometrium grow during pregnancy. Strong fibrous tissue grows on the outside of the uterus. The myometrium grows at first but becomes thinner at the end of the pregnancy. A doctor or nurse can feel the baby through the thinning uterus. < ref name= " :1 "  / > 
 
 == Uterine prolapse == 
 The uterus can move down and be seen through the vagina. This can happen after a woman has a baby. Older women have this problem more than younger women. Other things that make women have their uterus drop down: < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001508.htm|title=Uterine prolapse: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}} < /ref > 
 
 * Getting older 
 * A lower amount of estrogen after menopause 
 * Being overweight 
 * Coughing a lot 
 * A tumor 
 * Pushing too hard to have a bowel movement < ref name= " :2 "  / > 
 * Weak pelvic muscles < ref name= " :5 "  / > 
 
 == Surgery == 
 The uterus is removed by surgery for many reasons. Removing the uterus is called a [[hysterectomy]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-benign|title=RCPA - Uterus benign|website=www.rcpa.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-20|archive-date=2018-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606031908/http://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-benign|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Surgery to remove the uterus may need to be done after having a baby. This is because the woman may be bleeding heavily. The uterus may need to removed because there is cancer growing in it. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-endometrial-and-myometrial-malignancies|title=RCPA - Uterus endometrial and myometrial malignancies|website=www.rcpa.edu.au|access-date=2018-08-25|archive-date=2017-06-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629040151/http://www.rcpa.edu.au/Library/Practising-Pathology/Macroscopic-Cut-Up/Specimen/Gynaecology-and-perinatal/Uterus-hysterectomy/Uterus-endometrial-and-myometrial-malignancies|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Other animals == 
 A uterus is present when an animal gives birth to live offspring. Therefore, all [[mammals]] have a uterus except [[monotremes]]. However, humans are almost alone in having a single uterus. The other mammal which has a single uterus is the [[chimpanzee]], our nearest living relative. Other mammals have either wholly separated uteri or uteri which are fused along part of their length. 
 
 Animals which lay eggs have an [[oviduct]], and there are quite a few reptiles which are [[viviparous]] or [[ovoviviparous]].
