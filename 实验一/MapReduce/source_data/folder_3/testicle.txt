 '''Testicles''' are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures. Male [[mammal]]s, including humans, have two testicles, supported in a sac of skin below the [[penis]] called the [[scrotum]]. Along with the penis, testicles are called [[sex organ|reproductory organs]] or  " sex organs " . Only males have testicles; females have [[ovaries]].  
 
 Testicles are a type of organ called [[gland]]s. Like other glands, testicles make ''chemical substances'', called [[hormones]] that keep the body working. Testicles also make [[sperm]], which can join with [[ovum|ova]] to make new life.   
 
 Most glands, like women's ovaries, are inside the body, but testicles are outside the main part of the body. This is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body.  < ref > {{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Richard|title=Human Reproductive Biology|date=2013|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=74|isbn=9780123821850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4kEdSnS-pkC & pg=PA74|quote=The rear-entry position of mating may allow the scrotum to stimulate the clitoris and, in this way, may produce an orgasm ...}} < /ref >  In cold weather, testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm. 
 
 == Description== 
 The testicles are firm, oval-shaped glands. Most testicles  match in size, but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others. Normal sized testicles are between 14 cm³ to 35 cm³.  
 
 Most men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one. Scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other. It is usually, but not always, the left testicle that hangs lower. 
 
 The testicles hang in the scrotum by the [[spermatic cord]]. They are outside the body because they need to be cooler than the temperature inside the body, in order to make [[sperm]]. If a man's testicles get cold, they are automatically pulled closer to the body. The ''spermatic'' cord is tightened by the [[cremaster muscle|cremasteric muscle]]. When this muscle ''contracts'' (pulls tighter), the cord gets shorter, which pulls the testicles closer to the body. If the testicles are too warm, the cremasteric muscle ''relaxes'' (gets longer.) This lowers the testicles to keep them cooler. This is how the testicles are kept at the right temperature. This is called the ''cremasteric reflex''. (A reflex is something your body ''automatically'' does without you thinking about it.) 
 
 There are other uses for the ''cremasteric reflex'' apart from making the testicles the right temperature. Stress can also make the ''cremasteric reflex'' work. If a male human or mammal gets into a fight, then its testicles are in danger. They automatically pull up close to the body. The ''cremasteric reflex'' also happens during [[sexual intercourse]]. 
 
 == Function == 
 Testicles have two important jobs in the body. They are part of two of the body's [[system]]s, the [[endocrine system]] which keeps the body working, and the [[reproductive system]] which makes new life.  
 
 ===Making hormones=== 
 Testicles are a type of organ called [[gland]]s. (This makes them part of the body's ''[[endocrine system]]''.) The human body has many types of glands. The job of glands within a body is to make ''chemical substances'', and put them out into the body's [[system]]. A body has lots of different systems that keep it in good working order all the time, and that also provide for a body's special needs. Some of the body's special needs happen when a person gets angry, frightened or sick, or if the person wants to have [[sexual intercourse]]. At these times a body uses more of some types of ''chemical substance'', so the glands that make them work harder.  
 
 Testicles make several types of chemical substances. They are not simple chemicals, but are very complicated and very important to life. Making these substances is controlled by the [[pituitary gland]] which is a small gland in the [[brain]]. 
 
 One substance made by the testicles is a type of substance known as a [[hormone]]. It is the hormone [[testosterone]]. [[Testosterone]] is important in a male person's body, because it makes him grow into a man and feel like a man during [[puberty]]. (Women's bodies make some testosterone too, but they make more female hormone called [[estrogen]].)  
 
 [[File:Gray1149.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of a testicle. The sperm are made in the oval part of the testicle. They pass through lots of small tubes at the top and then downwards through the ''epididymus''. When the sperm are ready, they pass through the long tube at the right and into the ''urethra''. The picture also shows the [[artery]] that blood travels through.]] 
 
 ===Making sperm=== 
 As well as being chemical-producing glands, testicles are [[gonad]]s. (This makes them part of the body's ''reproductive system''.) Apart from ''hormones'', the other important substances made by the testicles are [[spermatozoa]], which are generally just called [[sperm]]. (The word  " sperm "  is plural, so you do not add an  " s "  and say  " sperms " .) The ''sperm'' are tiny living cells which can join with another cell, called an  " ovum "  (or egg) inside a female, to start a new human life. Scientists call making sperm ''spermatogenesis''. Boys begin making sperm when they start growing into men, at a time of life called [[puberty]].  
 
 [[Females]] do not have testicles. The glands in their bodies that do the same sort of jobs as testicles are called [[ovaries]]. They have two ovaries, but unlike testicles, ovaries are inside the body, on either side of the [[uterus]]. They release ''ova'' (or eggs) and ''female hormones''. Ovaries and testicles are sometimes called  " gonads " . 
 
 === Details of how testicles are constructed and how they work === 
 :(See the picture, right) 
 * The testicles, inside the scrotum, are covered with a tough type of white protective skin called a [[membrane]].  
 * The inner part of the testicles have many small tubes called ''seminiferous tubules'' which are coiled (or twisted around). [[Sperm]] are made inside the ''seminiferous tubules''.  
 * The sperm pass through some small tubes called [[duct]]s into another part at the back of the testicle, called the [[epididymis]], which is where the sperm cells finish maturing.  
 * The sperm cells then travel along a tube called the ''vas deferens'' until they reach the [[urethra]].  
 * The ''urethra'' is the main tube in the penis and leads to the opening at the end called the ''urethral opening''. The ''urethral opening'' is also the way that [[urine]] leaves the body from the [[bladder]]. 
 * When a man feels sexual desire, sperm cells go through the [[ejaculatory duct]]. They are combined with liquid called [[seminal fluid]] from a gland called the [[prostate]]. The prostate also has [[muscle]]s that push the sperm and fluid into the urethra. 
 * During [[sexual intercourse]], ''seminal fluid'' containing the sperm comes out through the ''urethral opening'' when a man [[ejaculation|ejaculates]].  
 * If the sperm from the testicles enters the [[vagina]] of a woman during sexual intercourse, it may pass into the uterus and join with a mature ''ovum'' (or egg) to begin a new baby. 
 
 == Health issues == 
 === Size === 
 '''Size in animals''' 
 
 Studying animals can help in understanding things about people. In [[mammal]]s, testicles can be very big or very small in relation to the size of the animal itself. The size has to do with the amount of sperm that the male animal needs to make. Some types of male animal generally only have one sexual partner at a time and are called [[Monogamy|monogamous]]. Some types of animals generally live in a herd or flock where one male will have many female sexual partners. These males are called [[Polygamy|polygamous]]. More sperm is needed by ''polygamous'' males than by ''monogamous'' males. ''Polygamous'' males generally have larger testicles than ''monogamous'' males. The testicles grow larger to make more sperm. 
 
 '''Size in men''' 
 
 Most men's testicles are from 14 cm³ to 35 cm³. This is a measure of [[volume]]. Sometimes Doctors need to measure a man's testicles to see if there is a problem. [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] can measure the [[volume]] of testicles in two ways:  
 
 * [[Orchidometer]] – This is a set of small objects that look like eggs. They are many different sizes. The doctor picks the one that is the size of the testicle. Doctors know what size the orchidometer is. Then they know the size of the testicle.  
 * Measuring the size – with a [[ruler]], [[caliper]]s, or [[ultrasound]]. Then these lengths are used to [[calculate]] the volume. 
 
 Sometimes the size of a man's testicles changes. 
 
 Some reasons why testicles get smaller are:  
 * If a man takes [[testosterone]], the testicles do not have to work to make testosterone, so they become smaller. 
 * If a man's testicles are kept more warm than usual, they make less sperm. So if they are kept too warm, they get smaller. 
 * If testicles are [[injury|injured]](hurt) they can become smaller.  
 
 Some reasons why testicles get bigger are:  
 
 * If a man takes hormones from the [[pituitary]] gland, (called [[gonadotropin]]s), it can make testicles bigger. ''Gonadtropins'' are the hormones that tell the testicles to make sperm and testosterone.  
 * Some diseases cause testicles to swell. 
 
 === Diseases === 
 The most important diseases of testicles are: 
 * [[inflame|Inflammation]] of the testicles. This is called [[orchitis]] 
 * [[Testicular cancer]]  
 * Fluid around a testicle. This is called a [[hydrocele]] 
 * Inflammation of the epididymis. This is called [[epididymitis]]  
 * [[Spermatic cord torsion]]. This is also called [[Testicular torsion]]. It is a medical emergency. It is when the cord that the testicle hangs from gets twisted. It can happen when running. 
 * [[Varicocele]] - swollen [[blood vessel|veins]] to the testes. Varicocele happens more on the left.[http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/guys/varicocele.html] 
 
 '''Loss and injury'''  
 
 Most boys are born with two testicles in the scrotum. The testicles have formed inside the baby's body, but moved into the scrotum before the birth. Sometimes one or both the testicles are still inside when the baby is born. Sometimes an [[Surgery|operation]] is needed to fix this.  
 
 If a testicle is injured, it is extremely painful. Sometimes testicles get crushed. Sometimes it is necessary for a doctor to remove one or both the testicles. This operation is called an [[orchidectomy]]. If a man loses a testicle, a doctor can put a ''testicular [[prosthesis]]'' (false testicle) into the scrotum. It looks and feels like a testicle.  
 
 If a male loses both his testicles it's called [[castration]]. Because the man cannot produce sperm or testosterone, it has a big effect on the man's life. Because he cannot make sperm, he cannot have children. And because he cannot make the male hormone testosterone, he becomes less like a male. He may lose some of his muscles, and put on weight. A man who has lost his testicles may take testosterone medicine so that he does not have these changes.  
 
 Until the 1700s in Europe, and more recently in some countries, there was a custom to castrate young male slaves and boys. Young slaves were castrated so that they could be used as guards over the wives of rich men. It meant that the wives would not fall in love with their guards. Sometimes young boys who had beautiful singing voices were castrated before [[puberty]]. This meant that their voices would stay high all their lives. These singing men were called [[Castrato|castrati]].  
 
 '''Castrating animals'''  
 
 It is very common to castrate (remove the testicles from) male [[domestic animal]]s. Male [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s that are castrated do not fight so much, and do not stray around looking for females to mate with.  
 
 Male [[horse]]s are usually castrated so that they become more calm and safer to ride. A castrated male horse is called a [[gelding]]. A male horse that is not castrated is a [[stallion]].  
 
 Male animals that are used for meat are generally castrated because it makes them fatter and also makes them quieter to keep because they do not fight each other. Most male [[cattle]] are castrated. 
 
 == Other names for testicles == 
 Testicles can also be called  " testes "  or  " gonads " . 
 
 There are many [[slang]] words for testicles, like balls, nuts, bollocks, nads (short for gonads), crown jewels, testies, marbles, ding dangs, boy toys, boys, nicnaks, plums, and tattay (in Urdu.) In Leviticus 21:20 in the bible (translated into English) they are called stones. Slang words are other names that are used for fun or to be ''vulgar'' (rude).
