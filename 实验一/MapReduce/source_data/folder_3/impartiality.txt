 An [[Wikt:essential|essential]] part of any of the world's [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]] is '''impartiality'''. < ref name=CaronBEP > {{cite web |url=http://works.bepress.com/david_caron/131/ |title=The Independence and Impartiality of Legal Systems |author=David D. Caron |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |access-date=26 October 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It is important for [[tribunal]]s, [[judge]]s, [[jury|jurie]]s and [[arbitrator]]s to be impartial. It is equally important for the legal systems themselves to be impartial. < ref name=CaronBEP/ > 
 
 == Judges and tribunals == 
 Judges cannot favor one party over another or give more [[wikt:weight|weight]] to one side's [[wikt:claim|claim]]s than the other. < ref name=RooseveltNYT > {{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/11/03/judges-appearance-of-impartiality/ways-a-judge-should-and-should-not-be-impartial |title=Ways a Judge Should, and Should Not, Be Impartial |author=Kermit Roosevelt |date=3 November 2013 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=26 October 2015}} < /ref >  Judges learn about the law from outside the courtroom and before a [[trial]] begins. < ref name=RooseveltNYT/ >  Because of this a judge may have an opinion regarding the law. When a judge expresses these views he or she is not being impartial. < ref name=RooseveltNYT/ > 
 
 == Juries == 
 In the US legal system, juries are screened and individuals selected by a process called ''[[voir dire]]''. < ref name=DOS > {{cite web |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2009/06/20090609110909msatlovir0.2372248.html#axzz3pdSJm9id |title=U.S. Courts Form Juries to Maintain Impartiality |publisher=U.S. Department of State |access-date=26 October 2015}} < /ref >  Both the [[prosecution]] and the [[defense (legal)|defense]] question jury candidates before a judge. This is to see if they can remain impartial. < ref name=DOS/ >  Any person having a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or who is obviously [[bias]]ed may be removed. This is called ''striking'' a juror. It is rare to have more than 10% of potential jurors struck from a trial. < ref name=DOS/ >  Trial by jury began in the [[United Kingdom]]. Except for cases where there is a provision by the law, it is the right of every person [[wikt:accused|accused]] of a [[crime]] to have an impartial jury trial. < ref name=Raive234 > Lionel L. Raive, 'Fair and Impartial Trial by Jury in the United States and in England', ''American Bar Association Journal'', Vol. 50, No. 3 (Mar 1964), p. 234 < /ref >  More and more criminal trials are held without a jury. The less severe crimes are tried by [[magistrate]]s. < ref name=Raive234/ >  The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees the right to a [[Fairness|fair]] trial. In Canada juries are made up of 12 ordinary persons, male or female, who are expected to be impartial [[triers of fact]]. < ref name=SkolnikJPJ > {{cite web |url=http://www.sistemasjudiciales.org/content/jud/archivos/notaarchivo/947.pdf |title=The Jury System in Canada |author=Terry Skolnik |publisher=JUICIO POR JURADOS |access-date=26 October 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  They decide whether the Crown (the prosecution) has made its [[Legal case|case]]. Judges have the option of increasing the jury to 13 or 14 jurors, but only 12 may vote on the guilt or innocence of the accused. < ref name=SkolnikJPJ/ >   
 
 Juries in [[Scotland]] have 15 jurors. < ref name=Kapardis140.141 > Andreas Kapardis, ''Psychology and Law: A Critical Introduction'' (Melbourne; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 140â€“141 < /ref >  In many European [[civil law]] countries and Japan, juries can be made up of [[layperson]]s and judges. < ref name=Kapardis140.141/ >  Also the opposing council may not be able to strike jurors as in the United States. < ref name=Kapardis140.141/ >   
 
 Many believe the [[Magna Carta]] first guaranteed a right to trial by one's peers. The Latin ''judicium parium'' does not mean a trial by jury. The word ''judicium'' in the [[language]] of the day meant a judge. The term ''liber homo'', usually translated as ''freeman'', at that time were a limited class in [[England]]. < ref name=Kapardis140.141/ >  So it did not mean every person.
