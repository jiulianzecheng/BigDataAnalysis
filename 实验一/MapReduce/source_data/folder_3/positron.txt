{{Antimatter}} 
 A '''positron''' (also called an '''antielectron''') is the [[antimatter]] version of an [[electron]]. It has the same [[mass]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] as an electron. However, it has a positive [[electric charge]], whereas an electron has a negative charge. Like all antimatter, when it meets its so-called counterpartner, each are annihilated and turned into energy. The electron and positron disappear, and the total mass decreases. There is no name for this type of [[energy]], as it is neither mechanical, radiation, chemical, electrical, nuclear, nor thermal. Although the energy does emit light [[photon]]s when annihilated, it is converted from some form of energy that has not been named. 
 
 A positron also very rarely makes a structure called [[positronium]]. Positronium is like an [[atom]] in many ways, but is very [[stability|unstable]], and usually quickly annihilates.
