 ==Background== 
 Nirvana was a rock band from [[Aberdeen, Washington]], formed by [[Kurt Cobain]] ([[singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]) and [[Krist Novoselic]] ([[bass guitar]]) in 1987. They first signed to the [[Seattle]] record label [[Sub Pop]]. The band released their first album on this label called [[Bleach (Nirvana album)|''Bleach'']] in 1989 with [[Chad Channing]] on [[drum]]s. Channing left Nirvana after this album in 1990, and the band needed a drummer. After seeing [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Scream (band)|Scream]], Cobain and Novoselic liked the drumming by [[Dave Grohl]]. When Scream broke up after this, Grohl joined Nirvana as the drummer. 
 
 During the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was having a difficult time with money. Because of this, Nirvana looked for a new record label. They ended up signing with [[DGC Records]] < ref name=classicalbums > ''Classic Albums—Nirvana: Nevermind'' [DVD]. Isis Productions, 2004. < /ref > 
 
 ==Title and cover== 
 The first name for the album before its release was ''Sheep''. This came from the kind of people Cobain thought were going to buy the album (sheep is a word meaning someone who does what other people do). The title was later changed to ''Nevermind'' as it was what Cobain thought about bad things in his life. < ref > Cross 2001, p. 189 < /ref > 
 
 The [[album cover]] of ''Nevermind'' shows a [[naked]] baby (Spencer Elden) < ref name= " telegraph " > {{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3563114/Nirvanas-Nevermind-baby-recreates-famous-image.html|title=Nirvana's Nevermind baby recreates famous image}} < /ref >  [[swimming]] underwater with a [[U.S. dollar]] bill on a [[fishhook]]. This is just out of the baby's reach. Cobain wanted to have a photo of a water [[birth]] on the cover but the record label wouldn't let him. < ref > {{cite magazine|last1=Bachor|first1=Kenneth|title=The Baby From Nirvana's Nevermind Is 25 Now|url=http://time.com/4499648/nirvana-nevermind-25-baby-spencer-elden/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004111740/http://time.com/4499648/nirvana-nevermind-25-baby-spencer-elden/|archivedate=October 4, 2017|date=September 23, 2016}} < /ref >
