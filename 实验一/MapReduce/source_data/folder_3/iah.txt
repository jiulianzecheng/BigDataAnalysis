 == 5 Day Myth == 
 < u > In an ancient Egyptian myth, sun god [[Ra]] has cursed goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] so that she can not have birth on any of the 360 days of the year. The wisdom god Thoth devised a plan that involved challenging A'ah to a game of [[Senet]]. Thoth outsmarted A'ah and won enough moonlight to add 5 days to the year. < /u >  Since these extra days were not cursed, Nut was able to birth a god on each of these days; [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Nephthys]], and [[Horus]]. Due to the loss of moonlight, the moon was unable to shine continuously and was forced to periodically dim in order to recuperate. Thus creating the phases of the moon. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.occultphysics.com/360-days-in-a-year.html|title=360 Days in a Year - The Curse of Re  &  The Birth of 5 Extra Earth Days|website=www.occultphysics.com|access-date=2019-09-02|archive-date=2019-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902230255/https://www.occultphysics.com/360-days-in-a-year.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < br / >
