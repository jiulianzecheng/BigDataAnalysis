 '''Electroreception''' is the [[ability]] [[animal]]s have to [[sense]] [[electrical]] [[source]]s. It is mostly found in [[aquatic]] or [[amphibian|amphibious]] animals. This is because water helps the [[signal]]s travel better than air. Some [[exception]]s are the [[echidna]]s, [[cockroach]]es and [[bee]]s.  Electroreception is used in [[#Electrolocation|electrolocation]]. 
 
 == Research == 
 Until recently, people thought only [[vertebrate]]s had electroreception. However, [[research]] has shown that bees use electroreception to find [[flower]]s. Electroreception is found in [[lamprey]]s, [[cartilaginous fish]]es ([[shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[chimaera]]s), [[lungfish]]es, [[bichir]]s, [[coelacanth]]s, [[sturgeon]]s, [[catfish]]es, [[gymnotiformes]], [[monotreme]]s, and at least one [[species]] of [[cetacean]]. Fish have electroreception from their [[lateral line]]s.  In most groups electroreception is used for [[predation]]. The [[Western long-beaked echidna]] has about 2,000 electroreceptors on its bill. Its relative, the [[duck-billed platypus]], has 40,000. < ref > {{cite web|title=Electroreception in fish, amphibians and monotremes|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_41_Electroreception-in-fish-amphibians-and-monotremes/|publisher=Map of Life|accessdate=26 October 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Electrolocation== 
 Electroreceptive animals use this sense to find where objects are. This is important in [[ecological niche]]s where the animal cannot see. For example, animals cannot use their [[vision]] in [[cave]]s, in murky water, and at night. Many fish use [[electric field]]s to find [[wikt:buried|buried]] [[prey]]. Some shark pups  " freeze "  when they feel the electric signal of their predators. < ref name=Coplin2004 > {{cite journal | author = Coplin, S.
