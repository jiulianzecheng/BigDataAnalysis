 A '''glycoprotein''' is a big [[molecule]]. It is composed of a [[protein]] and a [[carbohydrate]] (which is usually a [[sugar]]-like substance). Glycoproteins are important to recognise [[immune system|immune]] [[cell]]s in [[mammal]]s.  
 Well-known glycoproteins are: 
 * [[antibody|antibodies]] which react with [[antigen]]s 
 
 [[Hormone]]s that are glycoproteins are (amongst others) 
 
 * [[Follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) 
 * [[Luteinising hormone]] (LH) 
 * [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH)
