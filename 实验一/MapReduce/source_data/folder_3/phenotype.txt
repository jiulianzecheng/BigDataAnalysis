 The '''phenotype''' of an [[organism]] is the whole [[set]] of characters (or [[Trait (biology)|traits]]) of that organism. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. p333 < /ref > 
 
 It does not mean just 'what you can see on the surface'. Rather, it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means. For example, [[blood group]]s are definitely a part of the phenotype. However, they are not visible just by looking at a person. 
 
 In biology, the phenotype is distinguished from the [[genotype]]. This was proposed by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's [[heredity]] and what that heredity produces. < ref > Churchill F.B. 1974. William Johannsen and the genotype concept. ''J History of Biology'' '''7''', 5-30. < /ref > < ref > Johannsen W. 1911. The genotype conception of heredity. ''American Naturalist'' '''45''', 129-159 < /ref >  The distinction is similar to that proposed by [[August Weismann]], who distinguished between ''germ plasm'' ([[gamete]]s or their [[stem cell]]s) and ''[[somatic cell]]s'' (the body). 
 
 The phenotype is important because it is exposed to [[natural selection]]: 
 : " From Darwin to the present day most [[evolution]]ists have considered the individual organism to be the principal object of selection. Actually, it is the ''phenotype'' which is the part of the individual that is “visible” to selection " . [[Ernst Mayr]]  < ref > Mayr, Ernst 1997. [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/6/2091 The objects of selection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311053022/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/6/2091 |date=2007-03-11 }} ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA'' '''94''': 2091-94. < /ref > 
 
 Phenotypes are determined mainly by [[gene]]s and are influenced by [[natural environment|environmental]] factors. So, knowing the [[genome]] of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype. < ref > [[Sydney Brenner|Brenner, Sydney]] and Miller, Jeffrey H. (eds) 2002. ''Encyclopedia of genetics''. vol 3, Academic Press, San Diego. < /ref > 
 
 Traits vary greatly in how much they owe to heredity ([[nature vs nurture]]). The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship: 
 
 :'''genotype + environment → phenotype''' 
 
 == Extensions == 
 The term 'phenotype' must include characteristics that can be made visible by some technical procedure (such as [[blood type]]s). Another extension adds [[behaviour]] to the phenotype since behaviours are also affected by both genotypic and environmental factors. 
 
 The idea of the '''extended phenotype''' has been developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] to mean all the effects a gene has on the outside world that may influence its chances of being inherited. These can be effects on the organism carrying the trait, the environment, or other organisms. For instance, a [[Beaver#Dams|beaver dam]] might be considered a phenotype of [[beaver]] [[gene]]s, the same way beavers' powerful [[incisor]] teeth are phenotype expressions of their genes. Dawkins also cites the effect of an organism on the behaviour of another organism (such as the devoted nurturing of a cuckoo by a parent clearly of a different species) as an example of the extended phenotype. < ref > Dawkins, Richard 1999.
