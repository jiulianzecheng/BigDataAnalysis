 A '''hill''' is a landform that is higher than the surrounding terrain and that is smaller than a [[mountain]]. Hill is a  highland  of much lower elevation than a mountain. Normally it is not as steep as a mountain. By [[definition]], a hill is often described as being lower than 600 meters (about 2,000 feet). However, some definitions say a hill is lower than 300 meters (about 1,000 feet). The surface of a hill is much more stable than that of a [[dune]]. Hill have long been used for [[hill fort]]s
