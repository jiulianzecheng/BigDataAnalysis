 '''''Bloons''''' is a [[video game]] series. It is made by [[Ninja Kiwi]]. 
 
 ==Making== 
 The first ''Bloons'' game was made by Stephen and Chris Harris, who are two brothers from [[New Zealand]]. < ref > {{cite web |last=Phan |first=Monty |date=30 May 2007 |title=The Allure of Homemade Games |work=[[PC Magazine]] |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2139584,00.asp |access-date=17 July 2012}} < /ref >  Before working on ''Bloons'', the brothers had released ''Cash Sprint'', which was a racing game. After ''Cash Sprint'' proved to be [[wikt:successful|successful]], the brothers made their own  [[wikt:website|website]] for flash games. However, the site wasn’t successful. The brothers decided to focus on making their own games, and made a website called [[Ninja Kiwi]], which had five games when it opened. The site was a success, and this led to the brothers’ work on ''Bloons''. < ref name= " forbes " > {{cite web |last=Irwin |first=Mary Jane |date=25 July 2008 |title=Blowing Up Bloons |work=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/25/casual-games-bloons-tech-personal-cx_mji_0725bloons.html |access-date=17 July 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 The basic concept for ''Bloons'' came from Stephen's wife. When Stephen asked her what would be fun in a new game, she talked about  [[carnival game]]s with [[darts]] and [[balloons]]. < ref name= " forbes "  / > < ref > {{cite web |last=Bardinelli |first=John |date=20 April 2007 |title=In the Flash: Bloons |work=[[Joystiq]] |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/20/in-the-flash-bloons/ |access-date=17 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128155550/http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/20/in-the-flash-bloons/ |archive-date=28 January 2015 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The first version of ''Bloons'' was developed quickly, and the game was released in April 2007.
