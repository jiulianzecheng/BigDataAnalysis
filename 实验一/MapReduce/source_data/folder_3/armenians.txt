 == History == 
 
 === Antiquity === 
 The territory of the ancient Kingdom of Urartu extended over the modern frontiers of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and the Republic of Armenia. Its center was the Armenian highland between Lake Van, Lake Urmia, and Lake Sevan.{{sfnp|Kleiss|2008}} During the seventh century, the Urartians collaborated with a combination of Scythians and Cimmerians in their jockeying for power, but by 590, having been weakened in the constant rivalry between Assyrians, Babylonians, Scythians, and Medes, Urartu was swallowed by the Medes.{{Sfnp|Jacobson|1995|p=33}}

Curtin defined the Kingdom of Urartu as an Armenian kingdom.{{sfnp|Curtin|1984|p=185}} 
 
 The Iron Age kingdom of Urartu was replaced by the Orontid dynasty, which ruled Armenia first as satraps under Achaemenid Persian rule and later as independent kings. < ref name= " Toumanoff196322 " > {{cite book|url=http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Oront/oront278.htm|title=Studies in Christian Caucasian history|last=Toumanoff|first=Cyril|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1963|location=Washington D.C.|pages=278ff|author-link=}} < /ref >  The Kingdom of Armenia was ruled by the Orontid (also known as Yervanduni or Eurandids) dynasty from 321 BC to 200 BC. The Orontids (Eurandids) were an Armenian{{sfnp|Lang|1983|p=535}}{{sfnp|Versluys|2017|p=48}} dynasty of probably Iranian{{Sfnp|Garsoïan|2005}} origin. Around 200 BC a coup by the Armenian noble family of Artaxias toppled the Orontid (Yervanduni) dynasty,{{sfnp|Panossian|2006|p=36}} thus the Artaxiad dynasty came to power. The Artaxiad dynasty was been identified as a branch of the Orontid (Eurandid) dynasty.{{Sfnp|Garsoïan|2005}} The Seleucid Empire's influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the Romans in the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by Artaxias I alongside the Armenian kingdom of Sophene led by Zariadres. Artaxias seized Yervandashat, united the Armenian Highlands at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of Artaxata near the Araxes River.{{Sfn|Garsoïan|2004|p=49}} The new city was laid on a strategic position at the juncture of trade routes that connected the Ancient Greek world with Bactria, India and the Black Sea which permitted the Armenians to prosper.{{Sfn|Garsoïan|2004|p=49}} 
 [[File:Armenian_Empire.png|thumb|The Kingdom of Armenia at its greatest extent under Tigranes the Great]] 
 Under Tigranes the Great, a member of this dynasty, during his reign, Kingdom of Armenia stretched from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean and the Kingdom of Armenia was called the  " Armenian empire "  during her reign.{{sfnp|Wilken|2012|p=229}} At one time, the domains of Tigranes the Great stretched from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia up to the Pontic Alps. The vast empire, formed of a varied mixture of diverse tribes, with their own dialects and cultures, could hardly be turned over- night into a cohesive and durable political structure. Inner disunity aided the designs of the Romans, who launched a series of onslaughts on the Armenian dynast, beginning with the invasion by Lucullus in 69-68 B.C, and culminating in the campaigns of Pompey in Armenia, Iberia and Colchis in 66-65 B.C. The downfall of Tigranes the Great was precipitated by the flight of his son, Tigranes the Younger, to the court of the Parthian king Phraates III, who supplied him with an army with which to invade Armenia, and join forces with the victorious Romans.{{sfn|Lang|1983|p=516}}

 Approximately half a century after the collapse of the Artaxiad dynasty Armenia was under the rule of the Arshakunis, the Armenian branch of the Parthian Arsacids.{{sfnp|Panossian|2006|p=38}} Next, in 314, under King Tiridates (Trdat) the Great and through the apostolate of St. Gregory the Illuminator, Armenia, nearly simultaneously with the Roman empire, officially accepted Christianity, a turning point in its history.{{sfnp|Toumanoff|1986|pp=543–546}} An event of importance in the Arshakuni period was the invention, on the threshold of the fifth century, of the Armenian alphabet by St. Mesrop. With this Armenian became the language of the educated; it was introduced into the liturgy; and national literature was born (under Hellenistic and Syrian influences). Armenia’s identity and individuality were thus saved and an absorption by either Byzantine or Iranian civilization was precluded.{{sfnp|Toumanoff|1986|pp=543–546}}

 Later, the Armenian highland was divided between the Sassanids and their successors, the Arabs with the Eastern Rome.    
 Prestige of Ashot I, governor of Armenia, rose as both Byzantine and Arab leaders courted him. The Abbasid Caliphate recognized Ashot as  " prince of princes "  in 862 and, later on, as king. Several contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation.{{sfnp|Grousset|2008|p=394}} Ashot was crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by Basil I, a Byzantine emperor of Armenian origin.{{sfn|Garsoïan|2007|p=244}} The establishment of the Bagratuni kingdom later led to the founding of several other Armenian principalities and kingdoms: Taron, Vaspurakan, Kars, Khachen and Syunik. < ref > Ter-Ghevondyan; Aram, N (1976). «Բագրատունիների Թագավորություն» (Bagratuni Kingdom). Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. (in Armenian). Vol. 2. Yerevan: Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences. p. 202. < /ref >  During the reign of Ashot III (952/53–77), Ani became the kingdom's capital and grew into a thriving economic and cultural center.{{Sfnp|Ghafadaryan|1984|pp=407–412}} The first half of the 11th century saw the decline and eventual collapse of the kingdom. The Byzantine emperor Basil II ( < abbr > r. < /abbr >  976–1025) won a string of victories and annexed parts of southwestern Armenia. King Hovhannes-Smbat felt forced to cede his lands and in 1022 promised to  " will "  his kingdom to the Byzantines following his death. However, after Hovhannes-Smbat's death in 1041, his successor, Gagik II, refused to hand over Ani and continued resistance until 1045, when his kingdom, plagued with internal and external threats, was finally taken by Byzantine forces.{{Sfnp|Bournoutian|2006|p=87}} It can be assumed that Armenia had a population of 5–6 million at that time in the (IX-XI centuries).{{Sfnp|Poghosyan|1975|p=427–428}}

Their capital was originally at Tarsus, and later became Sis. 
 
 In 1198, with the crowning of Leo I, King of Armenia of the Rubenid dynasty, Cilician Armenia became a kingdom.{{Sfnp|Kurdoghlian|1996|pp=43–44}}{{Sfnp|Nersessian|pp=645–653|1962}} 
 
 In 1226, the crown was passed to rival Hethumids through Leo's daughter Isabella's second husband, Hethum I. As the Mongols conquered vast regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, Hethum and succeeding Hethumid rulers sought to create an Armeno-Mongol alliance against common Muslim foes, most notably the Mamluks.{{Sfnp|Nersessian|pp=645–653|1962}} In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the Crusader states and the Mongol Ilkhanate disintegrated, leaving the Armenian Kingdom without any regional allies. After relentless attacks by the Mamluks in Egypt in the fourteenth century, the Cilician Armenia of the Lusignan dynasty, mired in an internal religious conflict, finally fell in 1375.{{Sfnp|Ghazarian|2000|pp=54–55}} 
 
 Commercial and military interactions with Europeans brought new Western influences to the Cilician Armenian society. Many aspects of Western European life were adopted by the nobility including chivalry, fashions in clothing, and the use of French titles, names, and language. Moreover, the organization of the Cilician society shifted from its traditional system to become closer to Western feudalism.{{Sfnp|Bournoutian|Atamian|1997|pp=283–290}} The European Crusaders themselves borrowed know-how, such as elements of Armenian castle-building and church architecture. Cilician Armenia thrived economically, with the port of Ayas serving as a center for East–West trade.{{Sfnp|Bournoutian|Atamian|1997|pp=283–290}}

 === Early modern period === 
 Following the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, two Islamic empires—the Ottoman Empire and the Iranian Safavid Empire—contested Western Armenia, which was permanently separated from Eastern Armenia (held by the Safavids) by the 1639 Treaty of Zuhab.{{Sfnp|Payaslian|2007|p=105–106}}

 [[File:Areas_with_ethnic_Armenian_plurality,_(Russian_Empire)_-_1880.png|thumb|245x245px|Areas with ethnic Armenian plurality, within the Russian Empire, 1880.]] 
 Until the late fifteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in Eastern Armenia.{{sfnp|Bournoutian|1980|pages=11, 13-14}} At the close of the fifteenth century, with the rise of the Safavids, Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia.{{sfnp|Bournoutian|1980|pages=11, 13-14}} 
 
 Some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%, mainly because of the sixteenth-century wars with the Ottomans and the early seventeenth-century forced deportations of Armenians from the region by Shah Abbas I.{{sfnp|Bournoutian|1980|pages=12–13}} As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day Armenia), to the Russians.{{sfnp|Bournoutian|1980|pages=1-2}}{{sfnp|Mikaberidze|2015|page=141}} 
 
 After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in three centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia.{{sfnp|Bournoutian|1980|page=14}} The Russian offensive during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I, the subsequent occupation, and the creation of a provisional administrative government gave hope for ending Ottoman Turkish rule in Western Armenia. With the help of several battalions of Armenians recruited from the Russian Empire, the Russian army had made progress on the Caucasus Front, advancing as far as the city of Erzurum in 1916. The Russians continued to make considerable advances even after the toppling of Tsar Nicholas II in February 1917.{{sfnp|Hovannisian|1967|pp=80–82}}

 [[File:Six_Vilayets_ethnic_groups.png|thumb|Ethnic groups of Six Vilayets in 1912 according to Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople.]] 
 From the mid-nineteenth century, Armenians faced large-scale land usurpation as a consequence of the sedentarization of Kurdish tribes and the arrival of Muslim refugees and immigrants (mainly Circassians) following the Russo-Circassian War.{{Sfnp|Astourian|2011|p=56, 60}}{{Sfnp|Suny|2015|p=19, 21}}{{Sfnp|Göçek|2015|p=123}} In 1876, when Sultan Abdul Hamid II came to power, the state began to confiscate Armenian-owned land in the eastern provinces and give it to Muslim immigrants as part of a systematic policy to reduce the Armenian population of these areas. This policy lasted until World War I.{{Sfnp|Suny|2015|p=55}}{{Sfnp|Astourian|2011|p=62, 65}} These conditions led to a substantial decline in the population of the Armenian highlands; 300,000 Armenians left the empire, and others moved to towns.{{Sfnp|Suny|2015|p=54–56}}{{Sfnp|Kévorkian|2011|p=271}} Some Armenians joined revolutionary political parties, of which the most influential was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), founded in 1890. These parties primarily sought reform within the empire and found only limited support from Ottoman Armenians.{{Sfnp|Suny|2015|p=87–88}}

 === Modern period === 
 [[File:Yerevan_Hanrapetutyan_street_02.jpg|thumb|The Government house of the First Republic of Armenia]] 
 The First Republic of Armenia was established in 1918, but collapsed in 1920. In 1921, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia was established but collapsed in the same year. Afterwards Armenia came under the Soviet administration and became one of the Soviet Republics. In 1991, like other Soviet Republics, Armenia gained its independence.
