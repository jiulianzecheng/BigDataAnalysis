 A '''Mii''' is a customizable character created by the player, used on Nintendo's [[video game console]]s. Miis made their first appearance on the [[Wii]] when it was released. They also appear on the [[Nintendo 3DS]], [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch]] consoles, and in some games for the [[Nintendo DS]]. Miis allow players to create a [[caricature]] of themselves, other people, or of invented characters. They are created in the Mii Channel on the Wii, in the Mii Maker on the 3DS and Wii U, and in system settings on the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo DS does not have a way to make Miis on the console itself, but the games that use Miis include a Mii Maker to let players create them. 
 
 The player can change the look of a Mii in many ways. They can give it different [[hairstyle]]s, eyes, nose, and mouth shapes. They can change the eye and hair color of a Mii. (Players can only choose from a few colors on older consoles, but on the Nintendo Switch, a Mii's eye and hair color can be any color. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-23-nintendo-switchs-updated-mii-creator-lets-you-turn-your-hair-blue|title=Nintendo Switch's updated Mii creator lets you turn your hair blue|date=February 23, 2017|last=Phillips|first=Tom|work=Eurogamer}} < /ref > ) They can also give a Mii facial hair and wrinkles. [[Fashion accessory|Accessories]] such as [[hat]]s and [[glasses]] can be added. The player can change the size of things like the Mii's eyes, nose, and mouth.

 When the player makes a Mii, they can use it in many different video games. Some games use Miis for all the characters, such as ''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Tomodachi Life]]'', and ''[[Miitopia]]''. Many other games use Miis with other characters, such as ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. A lot of games on the Wii and 3DS use Miis as a profile picture, such as [[Rhythm Heaven Fever]] and [[Rhythm Heaven Megamix.]]
