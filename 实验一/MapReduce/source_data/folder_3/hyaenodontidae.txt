 The '''Hyaenodontidae''' ( " [[Hyaena]] teeth " ) is a family of the [[extinct]] [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Creodonta]], which contains several dozen [[genera]]. 
 
 The Hyaenodonts were important [[mammal]]ian predators that arose during the late [[Paleocene]] and persisted well into the [[Miocene]]. < ref name= " Berry1988 " > Barry J.C. 1988.

 == General characteristics == 
 They had long skulls, slender jaws, slim bodies, and a tendency to walk on their toes rather than flat-footed ([[plantigrade]]). They ranged in size from 30 to 140 & nbsp;cm at the shoulder. < ref name= " Lambert1988 " / >  ''[[Hyaenodon]] gigas'', the larger species, was as much as 1.4 m high at the shoulder, 10 feet long and weighed about 500 & nbsp;kg, but most were in the 5â€“15 & nbsp;kg range, equivalent to a mid-sized [[dog]]. < ref > Egi, Naoko 2001: Body mass estimates in extinct mammals from limb bone dimensions: the case of North American Hyaenodontids. ''Palaeontology'' '''44''' (3): 497-528. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-4983.00189/abstract;jsessionid=769F24911E3FEFA6ED1148F41FC12DA8.f03t03] < /ref >  Fossil evidence of their skulls shows that they had a particularly acute sense of smell, while their teeth were adapted for slicing, rather than crushing. < ref name= " Lambert1988 " / > 
 
 == Teeth == 
 Hyaenodonts were mainly meat-eaters. They did not crack main bones because they lacked 
 crushing teeth. This contrasts with modern [[hyaena]]s, which can crush bones of larger prey. This gives then a good source of [[calcium]], and access to the highly nutritious [[bone marrow]]. Modern [[bears]] and dogs also have bone-crushing capability, though not to the same extent as hyaenas. Hyaenodonts thus thus lacked dental versatility  for processing any foods other than meat. < ref name=Wang/ > 
 
 The [[carnassial]]s in a hyaenodontid are generally the second upper and third lower [[molar]]s. However, some hyaenodontids had as many as three pairs of carnassials or carnassial-like molar teeth in their jaws. < ref name=Wang > Wang, Xiaoming; and Tedford, Richard H. 2008.

 == Life-style == 
 Because of their size range, it is probable that different species hunted in different ways and allowed them to fill many different predatory [[Ecological niche|niche]]s. Smaller ones would hunt in packs during the night like wolves, and bigger, fiercer ones would hunt alone during the daylight, using their sheer size and their mighty jaws as their principal weapon.
