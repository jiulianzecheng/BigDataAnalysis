 ==History== 
 In the year 700 AD, two [[Irish people|Irish]] princes, Lugli and Luglien, were on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Rome]]. On the road between [[Boulogne]] and [[Thérouanne]], near [[Ferfay]], they were attacked and killed by robbers. Their servants [[burial|buried]] the bodies, but they were moved by a storm to the [[castle]] of the Bishop of Thérouanne. This was seen to be a [[miracle]]. When the [[Normans]] invaded, the bodies, now holy [[relics]], were moved to a safer place on an island with a [[marsh]] all around it. Years later, the sister of the princes, Lilia, came to [[pray]] at the [[chapel]] built to hold the relics. The town was named Lillers, after her. < ref name= " hl " > {{cite web|url=http://www.mairie-lillers.fr/|title=History Lillers|work=Site Officiel de la Ville de Lillers|language=fr|accessdate=2009-12-01|archive-date=2003-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031127181321/http://www.mairie-lillers.fr/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
