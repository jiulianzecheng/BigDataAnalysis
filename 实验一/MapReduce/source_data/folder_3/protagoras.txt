 '''Protagoras''' ({{lang-el|Πρωταγόρας}}) (ca. 490–420 BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]]. He is called one of the [[sophist]]s by [[Plato]], the Greek philosopher who followed [[Socrates]]. In Plato's dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', he credits Protagoras with having invented the role of the professional sophist or teacher of [[virtue]]. 
 
 == Philosophy == 
 It is thought that Protagoras used the phrase  " Man is the measure of all things "  ({{lang-grc|πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἐστὶν ἄνθρωπος}}). By this, he meant that nothing is absolutely truth, but there are different truths for each person, and each person makes the truth for themselves. For example, one person might go outside on a cold day and feel some water in a bucket, and they will say that the water is warm. And another person might go outside on a hot day and feel the same water, but they will say that the water feels cold to them. Each person is right.
