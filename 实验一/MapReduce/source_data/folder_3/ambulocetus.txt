 '''Ambulocetus''' ( " walking whale " ) was an early [[wikt:amphibious|amphibious]] [[cetacea]]n. It could walk as well as [[swim]]. ''Ambulocetus natans'' lived from the early [[Eocene]] (50 to 48 million years ago). Its [[fossil]]s have been found in [[Pakistan]]. When the animal was alive, Pakistan was a coastal region of India, which was then a large island in the [[Indian Ocean]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 [[File:Ambulocetus SIZE.png|thumb|''Ambulocetus'' size, compared to a human.]] 
 It looked like a 3-meter (10-foot) long [[mammal]]ian [[crocodile]]. It was clearly amphibious: its back legs are better adapted for swimming than for walking on land, and it probably swam by undulating its back vertically, as [[otter]]s and [[whale]]s do. 
 
 Ambulocetids may have hunted like crocodiles, lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting prey. Chemical analysis of its teeth shows that it was able to move between salt and [[fresh water]]. ''Ambulocetus'' did not have external ears. To detect prey on land, they may have lowered their heads to the ground and felt for vibrations. < ref name= " Thewissen " > {{cite journal|author = J G.M.

 Scientists consider ''Ambulocetus'' to be an early whale because it shares underwater adaptations with them. It had an adaptation in the [[nose]] that enabled it to swallow underwater, and its [[periotic bone]]s had a structure like those of whales, enabling it to hear well underwater. In addition, its teeth are similar to those of early cetaceans. < ref name= " Thewissen "  / > 
 
 One mostly complete specimen and several partial [[skeleton]]s have been found in [[Pakistan]].
