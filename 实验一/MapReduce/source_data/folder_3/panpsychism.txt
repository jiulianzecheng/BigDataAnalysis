 '''Panpsychism''' is the [[theory]] that everything in the universe is somewhat [[sentient]] or [[conscious]]. They are all connected parts of the whole.  
 
 Panpsychists believe  that all [[matter]] in the universe has some degree of [[consciousness]].In other words the substance of the universe is composed entirely of [[mind]] or consciousness. This is not to say that rocks have a mind but that the individual atoms and other particles in the rock have some sort of awareness and are aware of each other. Panpsychism is opposed to [[materialism]] or any [[doctrine]] that argues that the reality of the universe is composed solely of matter. Panpsychism needs no [[supernatural]] miracle to explain consciousness, it is consciousness. In other words we are all part of a grand [[communication]] scheme which is the glue that holds the [[universe]] together.
