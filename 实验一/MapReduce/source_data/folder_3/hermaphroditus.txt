 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Hermaphroditus''' was the two-sexed son of [[Hermes]] and [[Aphrodite]]. He was a minor god of androgeny, effeminacy and hermaphroditism. He also symbolized the [[unity]] of male and female. He was one of the members of the Erotes, a group of winged love gods. His name is the origin of the word [[hermaphrodite]]. 
 
 ==Mythology== 
 According to a myth of [[Ovid]], he was raised by [[nymph]]s in a [[cave]] on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen, he traveled to the cities of Lydia and Caria in [[Asia Minor]]. It was there that he came upon a pool of [[fresh water]]. He undressed and bathed in the pool. Meanwhile, the nymph of the pool [[Salmacis]], fell in love with him. She jumped into the pool and embraced him, not letting go, he struggled to get away from her. Salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer, merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an [[hermaphrodite|androgynous]] being. Hermaphroditus, in anger of his transformation, cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate. 
 
 ==Cult== 
 The worship of Hermaphroditus originated from [[Cyprus]], under the name of [[Aphroditus]]. The cult was introduced into mainland [[Greece]] around the late 5th century BC. At rituals and sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed; men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The god was also identified with the [[moon]], because the moon was thought to be both male and female. 
 
 ==Art== 
 Hermaphroditus was a popular subject in ancient Greek and Roman art. He is often shown alone and sometimes interacting with [[satyr]]s and [[cupid]]s. There is a famous statue called  " The Sleeping Hermaphroditus "  at the [[Mus√©e du Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in Paris.
