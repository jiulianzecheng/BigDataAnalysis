 '''''Liopleurodon''''' was a large [[species]] of [[Pliosaur]]. It was an [[apex predator]] in the [[Upper Jurassic]] seas, around 160–155 [[million]] years ago. It grew up to {{convert|6|m|ft}} long. < ref name=largeskull > {{Cite journal|last= Noè, Leslie F; Jeff Liston and Mark Evans|title=The first relatively complete exoccipital-opisthotic from the braincase of the Callovian pliosaur, Liopleurodon|url= https://archive.org/details/sim_geological-magazine_2003-07_140_4/page/479|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=140|issue=4|pages=479–486|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=UK|year=2003|doi=10.1017/S0016756803007829|bibcode=2003GeoM..140..479N|s2cid=22915279}} < /ref >  It was a relative of ''Pliosaurus'' and ''[[Kronosaurus]]''. It preyed on other marine animals such as ''[[Ophthalmosaurus]]''. 
 
 Some fossil remains excavated from the [[Kimmeridge Clay]] formation in [[England]] indicate a much larger animal, perhaps up to {{convert|15|m|ft}} long. However, these have not been put in the [[genus]] ''Liopleurodon''. < ref name= " L " > {{Cite web|last=Forrest|first=Richard|title=Liopleurodon|url=http://www.plesiosaur.com/plesiosaurs/liopleurodon.php|work=The Plesiosaur Site|date=2007|accessdate=2009-06-07|archive-date=2009-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122223143/http://www.plesiosaur.com/plesiosaurs/liopleurodon.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 ''Liopleurodon'''s nose allowed it to smell underwater. It could smell prey from some distance away. Despite needing to breath air, Liopleurodon spent its entire life at sea and was unable to leave the water. Consequently, it would have given birth to its young alive and may have visited shallower water to breed.
