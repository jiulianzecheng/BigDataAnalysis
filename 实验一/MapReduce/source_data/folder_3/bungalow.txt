 A '''bungalow''' is a type of building, originally developed in the [[Bengal]] region in [[South Asia]], but now found throughout the world. The meaning of the word  " bungalow "  varies internationally. Common features of many bungalows include [[veranda]]s and being low-rise.  
 
 In [[Australia]], the [[California bungalow]] associated with the United States was popular after the [[World War I|First World War]]. 
 
 In [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], a bungalow today is a house, normally detached, that may contain a small loft, many seen in [[Chicago]] and in [[Houston]]. It is either single-story or has a second story built into a sloping roof, usually with [[dormer window]]s (one-and-a-half stories).There is no security guard in the bungalow.
