 The '''dicotyledons''', also known as '''dicots''', are one of the two groups of [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms). The name refers to their [[seed]]s having two embryonic leaves or [[cotyledon]]s. There are around 200,000 [[species]] in this group. < ref name=Hamilton2006 > {{Citation | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Alan| last2 = Hamilton | first2 = Patrick| year = 2006| title = Plant conservation : an ecosystem approach| pages = 2| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P6m0OTheY8sC| isbn = 978-1-84407-083-1| publisher = Earthscan| location = London }} < /ref >   
 
 The other group of flowering plants were called [[monocotyledon]]s or monocots, with one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. 
 
 [[Sequence analysis]] showed what botanists already suspected: dicotyledons are not a [[monophyletic]] group. They are a number of lines, such as the [[magnoliids]], and groups now known as [[basal]] angiosperms. They diverged earlier than the monocots did. The traditional dicots are a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group.  
 
 The largest clade of the dicotyledons are known as the [[eudicots]]. They are definitely [[monophyletic]]. They differ from all other flowering plants in the structure of their [[pollen]]. Other dicotyledons and monocotyledons have an older type of pollen, whereas eudicots have [[derived]] pollen. 
 
 == Compared to monocotyledons == 
 Apart from [[cotyledon]] number, there are other differences between [[monocots]] and dicots. These are differences mainly between monocots and [[eudicots]]. Many early-diverging dicot groups have  " monocot "  characteristics such as scattered [[vascular tissue|vascular bundles]], trimerous flowers, and old-type [[pollen]]. < ref name=UCB > {{cite web|title=Monocots versus Dicots|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss8/monocotdicot.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=25 January 2012}} < /ref >  Also, some monocots have dicot characteristics such as [[Leaf#Veins|reticulated leaf veins]]. < ref name=UCB/ >
