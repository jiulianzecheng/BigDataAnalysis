A '''contronym''' is a word with more than one meaning (sense), as one meaning is the reverse (opposite) of the other. For example, the word '''cleave''' can mean  " to cut apart "  or  " to bind together " . In a sentence its meaning can be clear, otherwise the word itself is ambiguous. Contronyms are also known as '''auto-antonyms'''. 
 
 Many other words are [[polysemic]], because they have more than one meaning. However, most polysemic words are not contronyms. 
 
 *Other examples:  
 *to '''sanction''' may mean to approve or to punish;  
 *To '''overlook''' can mean to miss seeing something, or to see it but act as if nothing had happened. 
 *'''Fast''': to move quickly, or be stuck in one place.
