 '''Uncyclopedia''' is an [[encyclopedia]] that parodies [[Wikipedia]], calling itself  " the content-free encyclopedia " . It is a [[parody]] website. 
 
 Uncyclopedia was started by Jonathan Huang and his friend named  " Stillwaters " . It was made on January 5, 2005. Uncyclopedia's [[logo]] is a hollow [[potato]] named Sophia. Its color is [[Desert sand (color)|desert sand]]. This makes fun of [[Logo of Wikipedia|Wikipedia's globe logo]]. 
 
 It's a [[comedy|joke]] [[wiki]] that pretends to be useful. Every page is filled with made up facts and [[joke]]s. Users make fun of things by creating pages about them. < ref > {{cite news |first = Stephanie |last = Schorow |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/819420901.html?did=819420901 & FMT=ABS & FMTS=FT & date=Apr+8%2C+2005 & author=Stephanie+Schorow & pub=Boston+Herald & desc=BOOKMARK+DIVA%3B+This+wiki-cool+Web+site+lets+Net+surfers+define+world |title = This wiki-cool Web site lets Net surfers define world |work = Boston Herald |date = April 8, 2005 |accessdate = July 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021062807/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/819420901.html?did=819420901 & FMT=ABS & FMTS=FT & date=Apr+8%2C+2005 & author=Stephanie+Schorow & pub=Boston+Herald & desc=BOOKMARK+DIVA%3B+This+wiki-cool+Web+site+lets+Net+surfers+define+world |archivedate = October 21, 2012 |df = mdy-all }} < /ref > < ref name= " Guardian " > {{cite news |first = Jack |last = Schofield |url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/apr/14/internet.onlinesupplement |title = Web Watch |work = Guardian Unlimited |date=April 14, 2005 |accessdate = July 18, 2006 |location=London}} < /ref > 
 
 They have a guide on writing called HTBFANJS (How To Be Funny And Not Just Stupid). < ref > {{cite web|url=http://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/Uncyclopedia:How_To_Be_Funny_And_Not_Just_Stupid|title=Uncyclopedia:How To Be Funny And Not Just Stupid|publisher=Uncyclopedia|accessdate=10 December 2013}} < /ref >  This page helps users learn how Uncyclopedia is not like Wikipedia. It also helps people write so it matches the rest of Uncyclopedia.[[File:New-Bouncywikilogo.gif|125x125px|thumb|Uncyclopedia's logo for Wikipedia.]]Most encyclopedias try not to have opinions on things. They just try to tell facts. Uncyclopedia has its own opinions about things. These opinions are often silly. For example, Uncyclopedia thinks that [[Oscar Wilde]] was the best man ever. These opinions become [[meme]]s that are added into jokes all over Uncyclopedia.
