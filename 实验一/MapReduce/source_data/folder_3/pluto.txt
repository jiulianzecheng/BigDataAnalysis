Upon first being discovered, Pluto was considered a planet but was reclassified to a dwarf planet in 2006. It is the largest body in the [[Kuiper belt]]. 
 
 Like other [[wikt:member|members]] of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (⅕) of the weight of the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]]. It is only a third (⅓) of its volume. Pluto is very far from the Sun, so its temperature is very low. The average temperature on Pluto is -226 to -240 degrees Celsius. < ref > {{Cite web|title=In Depth {{!}} Pluto|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/dwarf-planets/pluto/in-depth|access-date=2021-10-08|website=NASA Solar System Exploration}} < /ref >  It has an [[orbital eccentricity|odd]] orbit and this orbit is very sloped.

 Since it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet.

In 1906, [[Percival Lowell]], a person from Boston began an [[wikt:extend|extensive]] to search the ninth planet. He called it  " Planet X " . < ref name= " Tombaugh1946 " > {{cite journal |last=Tombaugh |first=C.

 Constance Lowell, Percival's widow had a ten-year-long [[law|legal]] battle for Percival's estate. For this reason, the search for Planet X again started in 1929. < ref name=slipher > Croswell, p. 50 < /ref >  The director of the mission, Vesto Melvin Slipher, gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man. Tombaugh had just come to the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings. < ref name=slipher / > 
 
 Tombaugh's had to [[system]]atically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks.  Then, he had to look at each pair, to see whether any object had shifted.  He used a machine called a [[blink comparator]]. He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates. This helped him to see whether any object had changed its position. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year. Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this. < ref > Croswell p. 52 < /ref >  After the observatory did more research about it, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. < ref name= " Hoyt " > {{cite journal| title = W H.

 The discovery made headlines across the Earth. The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object. They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world.

The name was of the [[Pluto (mythology)|Roman god of the underworld]]. She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world. She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan. He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]].

 === IAU classification === 
 After a debate, in August 2006 an IAU resolution created an official definition for the term  " planet " . According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the [[Solar System]] to be considered a planet: 
 # The object must be in orbit around the [[Sun]]. 
 # The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. 
 # It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. 
 
 Pluto fails to meet the third condition. < ref name= " Margot2015 " > {{cite journal|last1=Margot|first1=Jean-Luc|title=A quantitative criterion for defining planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|year=2015|pages=185 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M|arxiv=1507.06300|s2cid=51684830}} < /ref >  Its mass is much less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times. [[Earth]], by contrast, is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon). The IAU also decided that bodies which, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2 but do not meet criterion 3, would be called [[dwarf planet]]s.  
 
 In September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and [[Eris]] and its moon [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]], in their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]]. it gave them the official [[minor planet designation]]s  " (134340) Pluto " ,  " (136199) Eris " , and  " (136199) Eris I Dysnomia " . < ref > {{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi#top |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=July 15, 2015}} < /ref >
