 The '''subtropics''' are a climatic region of the world. They lie between the [[tropics]] and [[temperate zone]]s. The temperate zones are more towards the [[geographical pole]]s, the tropics are more towards the [[equator]]. Very often, subtropics are defined through the climate: In general, the mean [[temperature]] year round is above {{convert|20|C|F}}, the coldest month of the year has a temperature below this mark. Unlike in a [[tropical climate]], [[snow]] and [[frost]] do occur in subtropical areas. [[Humid subtropical climate]]s have hot summers and cool to warm winters with abundant rainfall in every [[season]]. [[Mediterranean climate]]s with their warm to hot dry summers and cool to mild wet winters are often considered subtropical. Subtropical [[deserts]] have very hot summers and cool to warm winters, with little rain. Different subtropical areas have different types of plants. Humid subtropical areas have [[evergreen]] and [[deciduous]] trees, Mediterranean areas have [[scrub]], and deserts have [[cacti]].
