 The '''Allotheria''' are an [[extinct]] infra[[Class (biology)|class]] or super[[Order (biology)|order]] of [[mammal]]s. They are related to the [[prototheria]] and [[theria]]. 
 
 The allotheres was a branch of successful [[Mesozoic]] mammals. The most important characteristic was the presence of lower [[molar]]iform [[teeth]] with two longitudinal rows of [[cusp]]s. 
 
 Allotheres also had a narrow [[pelvis]], indicating that they gave birth to tiny, helpless young as [[marsupials]] do. 
 
 The [[Haramiyida]] from the [[Triassic]] period were the earliest group, and the [[Multituberculate]]s survived until the [[Oligocene]], 35 million years ago. < ref > Butler P.M. 2000.
