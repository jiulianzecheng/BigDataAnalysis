 '''Anaphylaxis''' is a serious [[allergy|allergic]] reaction.  It begins suddenly. it may cause death. < ref name=Tint10 > Tintinalli, Judith E. 2010. ''Emergency medicine: a comprehensive study guide''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 177–182. {{ISBN|0-07-148480-9}} < /ref >   Anaphylaxis has many [[symptom]]s (signs of being sick), such as an itchy [[rash]], throat [[inflammation|swelling]], [[Dyspnea|breathing problems]], and [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]]. Common causes include [[insect]] bites, foods, and [[medication]]s. 
 
 Anaphylaxis happens when a person eats, [[Inhalation|breathes in]], or is [[Injection|injected]] with an [[allergen]] (something they are [[Allergy|allergic]] to).  Their [[immune system]] over-reacts.  It sends out special [[proteins]] from inside certain [[white blood cells]].  These proteins can start an allergic reaction or make the reaction worse. 
 
 Anaphylaxis is [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] (found to be sick with something) from a person’s [[signs and symptoms]].  The best treatment is an [[injection]] (a shot) of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline).  Sometimes doctors give other medicines along with epinephrine. 
 
 Worldwide, about 0.05–2% of people have anaphylaxis at some point in their lives.  Anaphylaxis appears to be getting more common. 
 
 == History == 
 Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported since [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. < ref name=  " His10 " > {{cite journal |last=Ring |first=J |author2= Behrendt, H|author3=de Weck, A |title= History and classification of anaphylaxis |journal= Chemical Immunology and Allergy |year=2010|volume=95|pages=1–11 |doi=10.1159/000315934 |pmid= 20519878 |isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7 |url= http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/42/04708611/0470861142.pdf}} < /ref > 
 
 The condition was originally named  " aphylaxis "  by Charles Richet in 1902.  In 1913, Richet was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine and [[Physiology]] for his work on anaphylaxis. < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / > 
 
 Later, the name was changed to  " anaphylaxis "  because it sounded nicer. < ref name= " His11 " > {{cite journal |last=Boden |first=SR |author2=Wesley Burks, A |title=Anaphylaxis: a history with emphasis on food allergy |journal= Immunological Reviews |date= July 2011 |volume=242 |issue=1 |pages=247–57|doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01028.x |pmid=21682750|pmc=3122150 }} < /ref >   The word  " anaphylaxis "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἀνά (ana), ''against'', and φύλαξις (phyla's), ''protection.'' 
 
 == Signs and symptoms == 
 [[File:Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.svg|thumb|250px|Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.]] 
 
 Anaphylaxis can cause many different signs and symptoms over minutes or hours. < ref > {{cite journal |author= Oswalt M.L.  &  Kemp S.F. |title= Anaphylaxis: office management and prevention |journal=Immunol Allergy Clin North Am |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=177–91, vi |date=May 2007 |pmid= 17493497 |doi= 10.1016/j.iac.2007.03.004 |quote= Clinically, anaphylaxis is considered likely to be present if any one of three criteria is satisfied within minutes to hours}} < /ref >   If the anaphylaxis is caused by something that entered the body directly through the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] (through a [[vein]]), symptoms appear within an [[average]] of 5 to 30 & nbsp;minutes.  If it is caused by a food the person ate, symptoms appear within an average of 2 hours. < ref name=Rosen2010/ > 
 
 The most common body systems affected by anaphylaxis include: 
 * [[Skin]] (affected in 80–90% of cases) 
 * [[Lungs]] and [[breathing]] pathways (70%) 
 * [[Stomach]] and [[intestines]] (30–45%) 
 * [[Heart]] and [[blood vessel]]s (10–45%) 
 * [[Central nervous system]] (10–15%) 
 
 People with anaphylaxis usually have problems with two or more of these body systems. 
 
 ===Skin symptoms=== 
 [[File:Rash on the chest of a person with anaphylaxis.jpg|thumb|left|Hives and flushing on the chest of a person with anaphylaxis]] 
 Skin symptoms usually include: 
 * [[Hives]] (raised, [[itch]]y bumps on the skin) < ref name= " Diag06 " > {{cite journal |author=Sampson HA|author2= Muñoz-Furlong A|author3= Campbell RL| display-authors = etal |title=Second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis: summary report—Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology_2006-02_117_2/page/391|journal=J.

 * [[Itch]]iness < ref name= " Diag06 " / > 
 * Flushing (a red face or skin) < ref name= " Diag06 " / > 
 * Swollen lips < ref name= " Diag06 " / >   
 * Runny nose < ref name= " Aus06 "  / > 
 * Swelling of the [[mucous membrane]] on the surface of the eye and [[eyelid]] ([[conjunctiva]]) < ref name= " Aus06 "  / > 
 * [[Angioedema]] (swelling under the skin).  People with angioedema may feel like their skin is [[Burn (injury)|burning]] instead of itching. < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / >   
 In 20% of cases, the tongue or throat may swell up, which can cause breathing problems. < ref name= " Shock10 " > Limsuwan T; Demoly P 2010. Acute symptoms of drug hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock). "  ''The Medical clinics of North America'' '''94''' (4): 691–710, x.

This is called [[cyanosis]]. < ref name= " Aus06 "  / > 
 
 ===Respiratory (breathing) symptoms=== 
 [[Respiratory system|Respiratory]] signs and symptoms include:  
 * Trouble breathing (also called [[dyspnea]] or shortness of breath) 
 * Bronchoconstriction (when the [[Bronchus|bronchi]], the tubes that bring air to the [[lung]]s, get narrower; this makes it harder for air to get to the lungs) 
 * [[Wikt:hoarse|Hoarseness]], pain with [[swallowing]], or a [[cough]] < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / > 
 * When a medical professional [[Breath sounds|listens to the patient's lungs]] with a [[stethoscope]], they may hear: 
 ** Low-pitched sounds called [[Breath sounds#Abnormal Breath Sounds#Wheezing|wheezes]], caused by bronchoconstriction < ref name= " Diag06 "  / > < ref name= " Cardio08 "  / > 
 ** High-pitched sounds called [[Breath sounds#Abnormal Breath Sounds#Stridor|stridor]], caused by swelling in the upper airway < ref name= " Diag06 "  / > < ref name= " Aus06 " > {{cite journal |last=Brown |first=SG |author2=Mullins, RJ|author3= Gold, MS |title= Anaphylaxis: diagnosis and management |journal= The Medical Journal of Australia |date=2006-09-04 |volume=185 |issue=5 |pages= 283–9 |doi=10.5694/j.1326-5377.2006.tb00619.x |pmid= 16948628|hdl=2440/23292 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Cardiovascular symptoms=== 
 When a person has anaphylaxis, some of the [[cell]]s in the heart may release [[histamine]]. Histamine is a chemical made by the body. It can cause the heart’s [[blood vessel]]s to get narrower suddenly (this is called  " coronary [[artery]] [[wikt:spasm|spasm]] " ). < ref name= " Cardio08 "  / >   If the heart's blood vessels get too narrow, the heart cannot get enough blood.  This can cause many serious problems: < ref name= " Review09 " > Simons F.E. 2009. Anaphylaxis: recent advances in assessment and treatment. ''J. Allergy Clin. Immunol''. '''124''' (4): 625–36; quiz 637–8. < /ref > < ref name= " World11 "  / > 
 * Heart cells can die.  This is called a [[heart attack|myocardial infarction]], or a heart attack 
 * The heart may [[Bradycardia|beat too slowly]] or [[Tachycardia|too quickly]] (these are called [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s) 
 * The heart may stop beating altogether.  This is called [[cardiac arrest]]. 
 
 Anaphylaxis can also cause low blood pressure.  This may be caused by distributive shock, where the body's [[Vasodilation|blood vessels get much wider]] because of the chemicals released by the immune system.  It can also be caused by [[Shock (circulatory)|cardiogenic shock]], where the heart is not getting enough blood to pump out to the rest of the body. < ref name= " Cardio08 "  / > 
 
 Low blood pressure can cause many problems, including: 
 * A fast heart rate < ref name= " Aus06 "  / > 
 * A slow heart rate.  This is not very common.  It happens in about 10% of cases.  It is called the [[Bezold-Jarisch reflex|Bezold-Jarisch]] [[reflex]] < ref name= " CEA11 " > Lee J.K.  &  Vadas. P. 2011. Anaphylaxis: mechanisms and management " . ''Clinical and experimental allergy''. '''41''' (7): 923–38. < /ref > 
 * [[Syncope]] (fainting) 
 
 In rare cases, very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis. < ref name= " Shock10 "  / > 
 
 People who already have [[heart disease]] are at [[Risk factor|greater risk]] of having heart problems from anaphylaxis. < ref name= " Cardio08 "  / > 
 
 ===Other symptoms=== 
 Anaphylaxis can also cause problems with other body systems: 
 * Stomach and intestines: A person may have [[abdomen|abdominal]] pain, [[diarrhea]], or [[vomit]]ing (throwing up) < ref name= " Diag06 "  / >   
 * [[Urinary system|Urinary]] and [[Genitals|genital]] systems: Women may have pain in the [[pelvis]] that feels like [[wikt:cramp|cramps]] in the [[uterus]]. < ref name= " Diag06 "  / > < ref name= " Aus06 "  / >   Men and women may lose control of their [[bladder]].   
 * Central nervous system: A person may have [[Mental confusion|confused]] thoughts.  They may have headaches caused by blood vessels in the brain getting wider. < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / >   They may feel [[Anxiety|anxious]] (very worried) and believe they are going to die. < ref name= " World11 "  / > 
 
 ==Causes== 
 Anaphylaxis can be caused by the body’s response to almost any foreign substance (anything that is outside the body). < ref name=His11/ >  Common causes include [[Poison|venom]] from [[insect]] bites or stings; foods; and medications. < ref name=CEA11/ > < ref name= " Worm 2010 12–21 " > {{cite journal|last=Worm|first=M|title=Epidemiology of anaphylaxis.|journal=Chemical Immunology and Allergy|year=2010|volume=95|pages=12–21|doi=10.1159/000315935|pmid=20519879|isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7}} < /ref > < ref name= " Worm 2010 12–21 " / >   In children and young adults, foods are the most common trigger (or cause) of anaphylaxis.  In older adults, medications and insect bites or stings are more common triggers. < ref name=World11/ > 
 
 === Food === 
 Many foods can trigger anaphylaxis, even when the food is eaten for the first time. In the [[Western world]], the most common causes are eating or touching [[peanut]]s, [[wheat]], tree nuts, [[shellfish]], [[milk]], and [[egg (food)|egg]]s.  In the [[Middle East]], [[sesame]] is a common trigger food.  In [[Asia]], [[rice]] and [[chickpea]]s often cause anaphylaxis. 
 
 Severe cases of anaphylaxis usually happen when a person eats the trigger food.  However, some people have severe anaphylaxis when the trigger food touches some part of their body. 
 
 Children can outgrow their allergies.  For example, by age 16: < ref name= " His11 "  / > 
 * 80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs can eat these foods with no problems 
 * 20% of children who had only one case of anaphylaxis to peanuts can eat peanuts with no problems 
 
 === Medication === 
 Any medication may cause anaphylaxis. The most common are β-lactam [[antibiotics]] (such as [[penicillin]]), then [[aspirin]] and [[NSAID]]s. < ref name=Book2009 > {{cite book|last=Volcheck|first=Gerald W.|title=Clinical allergy : diagnosis and management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=9781588296160|pages=442|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWZLkZB7EW8C & pg=PA442}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Venom=== 
 Venom from stinging or biting insects, like [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s ([[Hymenoptera]]) or kissing bugs ([[Triatominae]]), may cause anaphylaxis. < ref name=Review09/ > < ref name= " Klotz " > {{cite journal|last=Klotz|first=J.H. |display-authors = etal |title= " Kissing bugs " : potential disease vectors and cause of anaphylaxis.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases : An Official Publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=2010-06-15|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1629–34|doi=10.1086/652769 |pmid=20462351}} < /ref >   If a person has a bad allergic reaction to venom once, they have a greater risk of having anaphylaxis if they are stung or bitten again. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Bilò|first=MB|title=Anaphylaxis caused by Hymenoptera stings: from epidemiology to treatment.|journal=Allergy|date=July 2011|volume=66 Suppl 95|pages=35–7|doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02630.x|pmid=21668850|s2cid=31238581}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|last=Cox|first=L. |display-authors = etal |title=Speaking the same language: The World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System.|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology_2010-03_125_3/page/569|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=March 2010|volume=125|issue=3|pages=569–74, 574.e1-574.e7|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.060 |pmid=20144472}} < /ref >   However, half of the people who die of anaphylaxis have had no anaphylactic reaction before. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Bilò |first=BM |author2= Bonifazi, F |title= Epidemiology of insect-venom anaphylaxis |journal= Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=330–7|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32830638c5 |pmid=18596590|s2cid=28384693 }} < /ref > 
 
 ===Risk factors=== 
 Certain [[disease]]s, called [[atopic disease]]s, can make a person more likely to have allergies.  Atopic diseases include [[asthma]], [[eczema]], and allergic [[rhinitis]].  People with these diseases have a high risk of anaphylaxis from food, [[latex]], and [[radiocontrast]] agents.  However, these people do not have a higher risk from injected medications or stings. 
 
 One study of children with anaphylaxis found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases.  More than 90% of children who die from anaphylaxis have asthma. 
 
 The risk of having another anaphylactic reaction decreases as a person avoids the trigger for longer and longer. < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / > 
 
 == How anaphylaxis happens == 
 Anaphylaxis usually happens because the immune system over-reacts to an allergen.  The immune system releases [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil]]s, which are types of [[white blood cell]]s.  The immune system sees the trigger as something bad and sends out white blood cells to kill it.  The mast cells and basophils attach to the allergen to try to kill it.  However, because the system is over-reacting, the mast cells and basophils explode and dump out chemicals that cause inflammation, like histamine.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis.  For example: < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / > < ref name= " Khan11 " > {{cite journal|last = Khan|first = BQ|author2 = Kemp, SF|title = Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.|journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date = August 2011|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 319–25|doi = 10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283481ab6|pmid = 21659865|s2cid = 6810542}} < /ref > 
 * Bronchoconstriction (where the tubes that carry air to the lungs get narrower) 
 * Vasodilation (where the blood vessels get wider) 
 * Fluid leaks out of blood vessels 
 * The [[Myocardium|heart muscle]] does not work as well 
 
 == Diagnosis == 
 Anaphylaxis is [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosed]] based on signs, symptoms, and knowing that a person has been exposed to an allergen.  It is very likely that a person has anaphylaxis if any of these three things happen within minutes or hours after they were exposed to an allergen: 
 # Problems with the skin or [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] [[tissue]], plus either breathing problems or a low blood pressure 
 # Two or more of these symptoms: 
 ## Problems with the skin or mucosa 
 ## Breathing problems 
 ## Low blood pressure 
 ## [[Gastrointestinal tract|Gastrointestinal]] symptoms 
 # Low blood pressure after exposure to an allergen 
 
 If a person has a bad reaction to an insect sting or a medication, [[blood test]]s for [[tryptase]] or histamine might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis. However, these tests are not very useful if the cause is food, or if the person has a normal blood pressure. < ref name= " World11 "  / >   Also, these tests cannot say for sure that a person does not have anaphylaxis. < ref name= " His11 "  / > 
 
 ===Allergy testing=== 
 [[File:Allergy skin testing.JPG|thumb|Skin allergy testing being carried out on the right arm]] 
 Allergy testing may help to identify what caused a person’s anaphylaxis. Skin allergy tests (such as patch tests) can be done for certain foods and venoms. < ref name=His11/ >   Skin tests can diagnose an allergy to penicillin, but there are no skin tests for other medications. < ref name= " His11 "  / >   Blood tests can diagnose milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and [[fish]] allergies. < ref name=His11/ > 
 
 === Differential diagnosis === 
 Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference between anaphylaxis; asthma; fainting caused by not having enough oxygen; and [[panic attack]]s.  However, there are some important differences between these conditions: 
 * People with asthma usually do not have itching, swelling, or problems with their stomach or intestines.  
 * After fainting, a person's skin is pale, and they will not have a rash or swelling.  Their [[breath sounds]] will be normal. 
 * A person who is having a panic attack may have flushed skin, but will not have hives or swelling.  Usually their blood pressure will not be low.  Their breath sounds will be normal. 
 
 == Prevention == 
 The best way to prevent anaphylaxis is to avoid the trigger that caused anaphylaxis in the past.  When this is not possible, there may be treatments to make the body stop reacting to the trigger.  This is called desensitization.  For example, treatment of the immune system (immunotherapy) with Hymenoptera venoms is able to make 80–90% of adults and 98% of children stop having allergic reactions to bees, wasps, [[hornet]]s, [[yellow jacket]]s, and [[fire ant]]s.  Most people who are allergic to certain medicines can just avoid those medicines.  However, desensitization is possible for many medications (for example, many [[Chemotherapy|chemotherapies]]) if the person has to take those medicines. 
 
 People with [[latex]] allergies may have to avoid  " cross-reactive foods. "   These are foods that have [[ingredient]]s that are similar to latex.  Examples of these foods include[[avocado]]s, [[banana]]s, and [[potato]]es. < ref name= " World11 " > Simons F.E. 2010. World Allergy Organization survey on global availability of essentials for the assessment and management of anaphylaxis by allergy-immunology specialists in health care settings " . ''Annals of allergy, asthma  &  immunology'' '''104''' (5): 405–12. [http://www.csaci.ca/include/files/WAO_Anaphylaxis_Guidelines_2011.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426002319/http://www.csaci.ca/include/files/WAO_Anaphylaxis_Guidelines_2011.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Management == 
 Anaphylaxis is a [[medical emergency]] that may require [[Emergency medicine|emergency medical treatment]].  Some patients need help keeping their airways open so they can breathe in air.   Other patients need to be given extra [[oxygen]] or large amounts of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[fluid]]s (fluids given through a needle into a vein). < ref name=Review09/ > 
 
 [[Epinephrine]] is the best treatment for anaphylaxis.  Doctors often give [[antihistamine]]s (which destroy histamine) and [[steroids]] along with epinephrine. < ref name= " World11 "  / >   Once a person has returned to normal, they should be watched in the [[hospital]] for 2 to 24 hours to make sure their symptoms do not return. < ref name= " Rosen2010 "  / > < ref name= " CEA11 "  / > < ref name= " BI05 " > Lieberman P 2005. Biphasic anaphylactic reactions. ''Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol''. '''95''' (3): 217–26; quiz 226, 258. [http://www.annallergy.org/article/S1081-1206(10)61217-3/abstract] < /ref > < ref name= " UK08 " > {{cite web |url= http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf |title= Emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions – Guidelines for healthcare providers |date= January 2008 |access-date= 2008-04-22 |publisher= Resuscitation Council (UK)}} < /ref > 
 
 === Epinephrine === 
 [[File:Epipen.jpg|thumb|An old version of an EpiPen auto-injector]] 
 Epinephrine is the best and first treatment used for anaphylaxis.  It reverses many of the symptoms of anaphylaxis.  For example, it makes the bronchi (the passages to the lungs) get wider; it makes the blood vessels go back to their normal size; and it raises blood pressure. 
 
 Epinephrine comes in an  " auto-injector, "  usually called an  " EpiPen. "   Once its safety cap is taken off, the EpiPen just has to be pressed into the thigh, and the right amount of epinephrine will automatically be injected into the person's body.  Doctors can [[Prescription|prescribe]] EpiPens to people who know they have allergies, so they can treat themselves for anaphylaxis.  Many [[ambulance]]s also carry EpiPens to treat anaphylaxis. 
 
 The EpiPen is meant to be injected into the thigh muscle, on the outside of the leg, as soon as anaphylaxis is suspected. < ref name= " World11 "  / >   There is no reason why it should not be used if a person is having an anaphylactic reaction. < ref name= " Review09 "  / >   The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if the person is still having breathing problems or other major symptoms. < ref name= " World11 "  / >  A second dose is needed in 16 to 35% of cases. < ref name= " CEA11 "  / >  More than two doses are rarely needed. < ref name= " World11 "  / > 
 
 Epinephrine can cause minor [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]], including [[tremor]]s, [[anxiety]], headaches, and [[palpitations]]. < ref name= " World11 "  / > 
 
 Epinephrine may not work in people who are taking [[Beta blocker|β-blockers]]. < ref name= " CEA11 "  / >   In these people, if epinephrine does not work, doctors can give intravenous [[glucagon]]. < ref name= " CEA11 "  / > 
 
 === Being prepared === 
 People who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to have an  " allergy action plan. "   These plans often include: < ref name= " Mart08 " > {{cite journal |last= Martelli |first= A |author2= Ghiglioni D. |display-authors = etal |title = Anaphylaxis in the emergency department: a paediatric perspective |journal= Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date = August 2008|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 321–9|doi= 10.1097/ACI.0b013e328307a067 |pmid = 18596589|s2cid= 205434577 }} < /ref >

 When people die from anaphylaxis, they usually die from respiratory (breathing) problems, usually the airway closing up, or cardiovascular problems, like shock. < ref name= " CEA11 "  / > < ref name= " Khan11 "  / >  About 0.7% to 20% of people with anaphylaxis die from it. < ref name= " Rosen2010 " > {{cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |year=2010 |publisher= Mosby/Elsevier |location= Philadelphia, PA |isbn= 9780323054720 |page=15111528 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Cardio08 " > {{cite journal|last=Triggiani|first=M|author2=Patella, V|author3= Staiano, RI|author4= Granata, F|author5= Marone, G|title=Allergy and the cardiovascular system.|journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology|date=September 2008|volume=153 Suppl 1|issue=Suppl 1|pages=7–11|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03714.x|pmid=18721322|pmc=2515352}} < /ref >   Some people die within minutes. < ref name= " World11 "  / > 
 
 Very rarely, people have [[exercise]]-induced anaphylaxis - anaphylaxis that is caused by exercise.  These people usually do well.  They usually have fewer anaphylactic episodes, which are less severe, as they get older. < ref name= " editor 2010 223 " > Demain JG; Minaei AA, Tracy JM 2010. Anaphylaxis and insect allergy.
