 '''Tillage''' is the process in which soil is loosened and softened by tillers or harrows pulled by a tractor or by a [[plough]] pulled by an [[animal]] or human. The plough breaks the upper crust of the soil so that air and sunlight enter into the soil. This makes the soil more [[fertile]] but too much or frequent tillage may make it less fertile.
