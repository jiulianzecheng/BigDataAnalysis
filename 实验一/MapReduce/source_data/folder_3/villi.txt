 '''Villi''' (singular is ''villus'') are small, finger-like structures in the [[small intestine]].  They help to [[absorption|absorb]] [[digestion|digested]] [[food]]. Each villus has microvilli which increase the [[surface area]] of the intestinal walls. A larger surface area allows [[nutrients]] to be taken in more quickly. 
 
 The food ([[proteins]], [[fats]] and [[carbohydrates]]) has already been broken down by [[enzymes]] called [[protease]]s, [[lipase]]s and [[amylase]]s. The [[amino acids]] and [[sugars]] (breakdown molecules of proteins and carbohydrates) go first into the [[blood stream]]. Then they are processed by the [[liver]], which acts like a chemical factory for the body. Lipid substances (such as [[cholesterol]]) go first into the [[lymphatic system]], and eventually into the blood stream and the liver.
