 The whirling dance that is associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the performances of the [[Mevlevi]] order in [[Turkey]]. It is part of a ceremony known as the [[Sama (Sufism)|Sema]]. It is also done by other orders. The Sema is only one of many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach religious [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] (''majdhb'', ''fana'').  
 
 The name ''Mevlevi'' comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey. < ref > {{cite web|last=Koentges|first=Chris|title=13 things the whirling dervishes can teach you about spinning until you’re dizzy enough to puke |url=http://veryethnic.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/13-things-the-whirling-dervishes-can-teach-you-about-spinning-until-youre-dizzy-enough-to-puke/|publisher=The Very Ethnic Project}} < /ref > < ref > B.
