 '''''Sauropelta''''' was an [[armour]]ed [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]]. It looked a lot like its more advanced relative ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', but didn't have the bony nodes at the end of its tail.  
 
 Anatomically, ''Sauropelta'' is one of the best-understood nodosaurids, with [[fossil]]ized remains recovered in the [[U.S.]] states of [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], and possibly [[Utah]]. It is also the earliest known [[genus]] of [[nodosaurid]]; most of its remains date to about 115 to 110 million years ago. 
 
 It was a medium-sized nodosaurid, measuring about 5 & nbsp;meters (16.5 ft) long. ''Sauropelta'' had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length. Although its body was smaller than a modern [[black rhinoceros]], ''Sauropelta'' was about the same mass, weighing in at about 1,500 [[kilograms]] (3,300 [[pound (mass)|lb]]). The extra weight was largely due to its extensive armour, including the large spines projecting from its neck. 
 
 As in other ankylosaurs, thick triangular [[scute]]s projected above and behind the eyes, as well as below and behind the eyes. < ref > Carpenter, Kenneth  &  Kirkland, James I. 1998.

The front end of the skull is unknown, but there would have been a [[keratin]]ous [[beak]]. < ref name= " vickaryousetal2004 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/154697781|title=The dinosauria|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25408-4|edition=2nd|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=154697781}} < /ref >
