 The [[family (biology)|family]] '''Tettigoniidae''', known in [[American English]] as '''katydids''' and in [[British English]] as '''bush-crickets''', contains more than 6,400 [[species]]. It is part of the suborder [[Ensifera]]. 
 
 They are also known as '''long-horned grasshoppers''', though they are more closely related to [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s than to [[grasshopper]]s. 
 Their [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] may be longer than their own body length, those of the grasshoppers are always relatively short. 
 
 == Disguise == 
 Katydids may disguise themselves brilliantly. Some look exactly like dead brown [[leaf|leaves]], complete with holes, lying still on the forest floor of the rainforests of [[Asia]] and [[South America]]. Others act like green, living leaves fluttering from a branch. They even have vein-like markings like real leaves. < ref > {{cite book|title=Jungle animals: over 100 questions and answers to things you want to know|last=Ganeri|first=Anita
