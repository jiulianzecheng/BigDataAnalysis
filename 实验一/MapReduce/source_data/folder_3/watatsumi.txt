 Watatsumi is a legendary deity, dragon, and protector of water in Japanese mythology. Some people believe that Ōwatatsumi no kami, also known as Ryūjin, the Dragon God of the sea, is another name for Watatsumi. Three deities, known as Watatsumi Sanjin, were created when Izanagi washed himself after returning from Yomi, the underworld. These three deities govern the upper, middle, and lower seas.
