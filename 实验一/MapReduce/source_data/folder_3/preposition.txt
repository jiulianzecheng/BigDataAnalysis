'''Prepositions''' often describe the position of something, the time when something happens or the way in which something is done. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/prepositions|title=Prepositions|work=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=27 March 2014|archive-date=20 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320225829/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/prepositions|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The prepositions  " of " ,  " to "  and  " for "  have other functions. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.talkenglish.com/Grammar/prepositions-of-to-for.aspx|title=Prepositions  " Of, "   " To, "  and  " For "

 Prepositions may sometimes be used to end sentences. For example,  " What did you put that there for? "  (better English is the alternative:  " Why did you put that there? " ) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ending-sentences-with-prepositions|title=Ending sentences with prepositions|work=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=27 March 2014|archive-date=30 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330030619/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ending-sentences-with-prepositions|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Example 2:  " A pen is a device to write with "  (better English is  " A pen is a writing device " ). In general, because they are links, prepositions belong in the middle of sentences, rather than at the end.
