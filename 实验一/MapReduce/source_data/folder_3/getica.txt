 '''''Getica''''' (original title: '''''De origine actibusque Getarum''''', about the origins and deeds of the Getae (the Goths)) < ref > G. Costa, 32. Also: ''De Rebus Geticis'': O. Seyffert, 329; ''De Getarum (Gothorum) Origine et Rebus Gestis'': W. Smith, vol 2 page 607 < /ref > < ref name= " name1 " > Jordanes, ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths'', translated by C. Mierow < /ref >  is the main work of [[Jordanes]]. It was written in 551. < ref > Or slightly later, see Peter Heather, ''Goths and Romans 332-489'', Oxford 1991, pp. 47-49 (year 552), Walter Goffart, ''The Narrators of Barbarian History'', Princeton 1988, p. 98 (year 554). < /ref >  He made a summary of a larger work by [[Cassiodoriius]] called ''Libri XII De Rebus Gestis Gothorum'' (''Twelve books about the things the Goths did'', commonly known as ''Libri XII''). As the ''Libri XII'' have not survived, his work is the only surviving account that was written when there were still Goths.  
 
 According to the ''Getica'', the Goths immigrated form [[Scandinavia]] and settled around what is the city [[Danzig]] today. This has been identified with the [[Wielbark culture]].
