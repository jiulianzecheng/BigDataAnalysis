In [[computer programming]], a '''subroutine''' is a [[code]] that is comprised of more codes — just like everything in programming — its purpose is the same: execute an instruction/command. Because subroutines are shorter, they can be typed faster and therefore be used more by programmers, hence saving time by being able to code faster. 
 
 Subroutines are commonly paired with [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]], a type of [[variable]].
