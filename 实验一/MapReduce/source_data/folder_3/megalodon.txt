 '''''Megalodon''''' is an extinct species of [[shark]] and was the largest of all time. Its scientific name is '''''Otodus megalodon''''' (meaning  " big mouth " ). It lived from the early [[Miocene]] to the [[Pliocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]], 23 to 3.6 million years ago (mya). It is not closely related to the present-day [[great white shark]]. 
 
 Megalodon had teeth, which are among the largest ever found, over {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. [[Nicolaus Steno]] was the first to recognize the teeth as those of a giant shark. Paleontologists calculate that the shark was up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} long with average length of 17 meters (56 feet) It weighed up to 48-103 metric tons. < ref > Jacoby D.M.P.

 == Paleoecology == 
 Fossil records of ''O. megalodon'' indicate that it occurred in [[deep]] to[[ tropical]] latitudes. < ref name= " G "  / >  Before the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], the seas were relatively warmer. < ref name= " WOC " > {{cite web|last=Gillette|first=Lynett|title=Winds of Change|url= http://www.sdnhm.org/research/readings/fn_0307.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207072858/http://www.sdnhm.org/research/readings/fn_0307.html|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum| archivedate= 2009-02-07 | url-status= dead| accessdate=2012-04-04}} < /ref >  This would have made it possible for the species to live in all the [[ocean]]s of the world. 
 
 ''O. megalodon'' lived in many marine environments (i.e. [[continental shelf]] waters, < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  coastal upwelling, < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  swampy coastal lagoons, < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  sandy littorals, < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  and offshore deep water environments), < ref name=H > Renz, Mark 2002.

PaleoPress. {{ISBN|0-9719477-0-8}} < /ref >  and moved from place to place. < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  Adult ''O. megalodon'' were not abundant in shallow water environments, < ref name= " GTWT "  / >  and mostly lurked offshore. ''C. megalodon'' may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, at different stages in its life. 
 
 == Its prey == 
 Megalodon hunted large and medium-sized [[whale]]s, attacking the bony areas, such as chest, fins, or tail. This would stop the whale, or it could kill quickly with a fatal bite to the chest region. The megalodon bite is considered one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom’s history.

 Marine mammals were regular prey targets for megalodon. Many whale bones have been found with clear signs of large bite marks (deep gashes) made by teeth that match those of megalodon, < ref name= " G "  / > < ref name= " D "  / >  and various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, < ref name= " G "  / >  and sometimes in direct association with them. Fossil evidence of interactions between megalodon and pinnipeds also exist. In one interesting observation, a {{convert|127|mm|in}} megalodon tooth was found lying very close to a bitten earbone of a [[sea lion]]. < ref name= " BA "  / > 
 
 == Relationships == 
 Megalodon is now considered to be a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Otodontidae]], genus ''Otodus''. < ref name= " Shimada2016 " > {{cite journal|last1= Shimada|first1=K.|last2= Chandler|first2=R.

Most authors now think this is due to [[convergent evolution]]. The great white shark is more closely related to the extinct [[broad-toothed mako]] (''[[Isurus hastalis]]'') than to megalodon. The dentition in those two sharks is similar, whereas megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the [[mako shark]] (''Isurus'' spp.), with a most recent [[common ancestor]] about 4 mya. < ref name= " FSP " > {{Cite journal|author1=Ehret D.
