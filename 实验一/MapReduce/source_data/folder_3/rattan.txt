 '''Rattan''' (from the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''rotan'') is the name for about 600 [[species]] of [[old world]] [[climbing plants|climbing]] [[palm]]s. They belong to the [[subfamily]] Calamoideae. < ref name= " Dransfield general " > J Dransfield 2002. ''General Introduction to Rattan - the biological background to exploitation and the history of rattan research''. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y2783e/y2783e06.htm#P889_66944] < /ref >   
 
 Rattan is also known as ''manila'', or ''malacca'', after the ports of [[Manila]] and [[Malacca City]], and as ''manau'' (from the [[Malay language|Malay]] ''rotan manau'', the trade name for ''Calamus manan'' canes in [[Southeast Asia]]). < ref > Johnson, Dennis V.

 The [[Climbing plant|climbing habit]] comes with a flexible woody [[plant stem|stem]], got from a secondary growth. This makes rattan a [[liana]] rather than a normal or true [[wood]]. It grows much faster than most tropical wood. Rattan canes are one of the world's most valuable non-timber forest products.  
 
 'Dragon's blood' is a red [[resin]] used in [[dyes]], [[varnish]]es and [[incense]]. It can come from the fruit of a rattan. [[Furniture]] is probably the most widespread use. Many types of [[Weapon|weapons]] have been made from rattan.
