 '''''Aegyptosaurus''''', meaning  " Egypt's Lizard " , is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] dinosaur that lived in [[Africa]] around 95 million years ago during the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. Like most sauropods, it had a long neck and a small [[skull]]. The animal's long [[tail]] probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass. Its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs such as ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Spinosaurus]]''.  
 
 ''Aegyptosaurus'' was a close relative of ''[[Argentinosaurus]]'', a much larger dinosaur that lived in [[South America]] at about the same time. This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period.  
 
 ''Aegyptosaurus'' was discovered and named by a German paleontologist named [[Ernst Stromer]] in 1932. < ref > Stromer, E. (1932a). Ergebnisse der Forschungsreisen Prof. E. Stromers in den Wüsten Ägyptens. II. Wirbeltierreste der Baharîje-Stufe (unterstes Cenoman). 11. Sauropoda. ''Abhandlungen der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche Abteilung, Neue Folge'', '''10''': 1-21. < /ref >  Its fossils were found in [[Egypt]], [[Niger]], and in several different locations in the [[Sahara Desert]]. All known specimens were discovered before 1939. The fossils were stored together in [[Munich]], but were destroyed when an Allied bombing raid hit the museum in 1944, during [[World War II]]. 
 The [[type species]] is ''Aegyptosaurus baharijensis'', named after the [[Bahariya Formation]] in Egypt, where the first fossils were found. 
 
 ''Aegyptosaurus'' was much smaller and more common than its contemporary, ''[[Paralititan]]''.
