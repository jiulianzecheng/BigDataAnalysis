{{Infobox argon}} 
 '''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]]. Its symbol is argon is '''Ar''' and its [[atomic number]] is 18. It is part of the [[noble gas]] group. It is an odorless and tasteless gas. Argon is the third-most abundant [[gas]] in the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere. 
 
 The name  " argon "  is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἀργός meaning  " lazy "  or  " inactive "  because it does not react with other chemicals. 
 
 == Chemistry == 
 Argon [[atom]]s are found in [[air]]. About 1% of the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] (the air around us) is argon. It is not toxic and it does not burn easily. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc. ... MSDS Gaseous Argon - GAR|url=http://www.uigi.com/MSDS_gaseous_Ar.html|access-date=2021-08-29|website=www.uigi.com}} < /ref >  Not many compounds can be made from Argon. However, some compounds have been formed, like [[argon fluorohydride]] (HArF). Argon is a heavier gas than [[helium]], so if a [[balloon]] is filled with argon, it would fall to the ground. 
 
 == History == 
 Argon was first removed from air in 1894 by [[Lord Rayleigh]] and [[Sir William Ramsay]] at University College London by removing [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], and [[nitrogen]] from a sample of clean [[air]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=1895-12-31|title=I.

 ==Isotopes== 
 The main [[Isotope|isotopes]] of argon found on Earth are  < sup > 40 < /sup > Ar (99.6%),  < sup > 36 < /sup > Ar (0.34%), and  < sup > 38 < /sup > Ar (0.06%). The most abundant isotope of argon is  < sup > 40 < /sup > Ar. But other [[Planet|planets]] have different isotopes of argon. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1119634122|title=Nature's Building Blocks : an a-Z Guide to the Elements.|last=Emsley|first=John|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-19-257046-8|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=1119634122}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Production== 
 Argon is gotten industrially by the [[fractional distillation]] of liquid air. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Periodic Table of Elements: Argon - Ar (EnvironmentalChemistry.com)|url=https://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/periodic/Ar.html|access-date=2021-08-29|website=environmentalchemistry.com}} < /ref > < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 < sup > 40 < /sup > Ar is made by the decay of  < sup > 40 < /sup > K with a half-life of 1.25 billion years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in knowing how old [[rock (geology)|rocks]] are. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Argon is often used when [[welding]] [[steel]] and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the [[oxygen]] in the air can't join with the [[metal]] being welded. It can also be used in [[Neon light|neon lights]] for a purple color. Argon is used in the [[poultry]] [[industry]] to [[Asphyxiation|asphyxiate]] [[Bird|birds]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2011-07-24|title=Slaughter technology|url=http://ps.fass.org/cgi/reprint/78/2/277.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195609/http://ps.fass.org/cgi/reprint/78/2/277.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-24}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=Sara J.|last2=Raj|first2=A.
