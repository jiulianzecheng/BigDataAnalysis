  }} < /ref >  It is believed that there were about 2500 people living in the fort. The Selgovae left the fort in [[79|79 AD]] when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] army invaded the area. There are other Selgovae hillforts at Caidemuir Hill (near [[Peebles]]), Dreva Craig (near [[Broughton]]), Rubers Law (near [[Hawick]]), Whiteside Hill (near [[Romannobridge]]), Abory Hill (near [[Abington]]), Cow Castle (near [[Coulter]]), Quothquan Law (near [[Thankerton]]), Bodsberry Hill (near [[Crawford]]) and at Crawford. < ref name=rbo/ >  At Tamshiell Rigg there is evidence of a walled settlement. The Roman forts at Birrens, Netherby and Bewcastle were all built in Selgovae lands, north of [[Hadrian's Wall]]. < ref name=rbo/ > 
 
 In the second century, the Selgovae are said to be one of the four kingdoms of ancient Scotland. By the end of the fourth century, the area had been taken over by Coel Hen and his kingdom of North Britain. < ref name=hf/ >
