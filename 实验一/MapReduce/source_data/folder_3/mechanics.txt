'''Mechanics''' is a branch of [[physics]] which looks at objects that are moved by [[Force (physics)|forces]] (including other bodies, or forces of nature). 
 
 The discipline has its roots in [[ancient Greece]] where [[Aristotle]] studied the way bodies behaved when they were thrown through the air (e.g. a stone). However it was [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and especially [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] who laid the foundations for much of the so-called ''[[Newtonian mechanics]]'' we know today.[[File:Newtons cradle animation book.gif|thumb|Animation of ''Newton's cradle'' from Newton's book ''Principia Mathematica''.]] 
 
 A person working in the discipline is known as a [[mechanician]]. 
 
 == Significance == 
 Mechanics is the original discipline of physics, dealing with the [[macroscopic]] world that humans perceive. It is therefore a huge body of [[knowledge]] about the natural world. Mechanics encompasses the movement of all matter in the [[universe]] under the four forces: [[gravity]], the [[strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction]]s, and the electromagnetic interaction. 
 
 Mechanics also constitutes a central part of [[technology]]. 
 
 === Some aspects of classical mechanics === 
 * [[Astrodynamics]], spacecraft [[navigation]], [[orbital eccentricity]], etc. 
 * [[Solid mechanics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], the properties of (semi-)rigid bodies 
 * [[Acoustics]], [[sound]] in solids, fluids, etc. 
 * [[Hydraulics]], fluids in equilibrium 
 * [[Applied mechanics|Applied / Engineering mechanics]] 
 * [[Statistical mechanics]], large assemblies of particles 
 * Relativistic or [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] mechanics, universal [[gravitation]] 
 
 === Newton === 
 [[Newton]] proposed three laws of motion.  
 #An object will stay at a constant speed unless a force acts on it.  
 #F= Ma: the overall force acting on an object = the [[mass]] of the object multiplied by the object's [[acceleration]]. 
 #For every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. 
 
 === Quantum mechanics === 
 The following are categorized as being part of [[Quantum mechanics]]: 
 * [[Particle physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of particles 
 * [[Nuclear physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of nuclei 
 * [[Condensed matter physics]], quantum gases, solids, liquids, etc. 
 * [[Quantum statistical mechanics]], large assemblies of particles
