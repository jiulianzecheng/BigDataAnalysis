 A '''caldera''' is a volcanic feature formed by the collapse of land surface after a gigantic volcanic eruption. In such an eruption the volcano's [[magma]] chamber is empty enough for the ground above it to drop. < ref > Francis, Peter 1993. ''Volcanoes: a planetary perspective''. Oxford University Press. Chapter 14, p291 et seq. {{ISBN|0-19-854033-7}} < /ref > 
 
 A caldera may look like a [[volcanic crater]] except that a crater is made by blasting outward, not by collapsing inward. < ref > {{cite web

 When [[Yellowstone]] Caldera last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000 & nbsp;km < sup > 3 < /sup >  of material, covering much of [[North America]] in debris up to two metres thick. By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in 1980, it released 1000 times less material. 
 
 The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]]. 
 
 About 75,000 years ago, the [[Toba catastrophe]] released about 2,800 & nbsp;km < sup > 3 < /sup >  of ejecta. This was the largest known explosive eruption within the last 25 & nbsp;million years.  In the late 1990s, [[anthropologist]] Stanley Ambrose suggested that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the [[human]] population to about 2,000 {{ndash}} 20,000, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/ambrose|title=Professor Stanley H Ambrose PhD {{!}} Anthropology at Illinois|website=www.anthro.illinois.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-06}} < /ref >  Others suggested that the human race was reduced to about five to ten thousand people. < ref > [http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC]]2, 3 February 2000 < /ref >   
 However, there is no direct evidence that the theory is correct  < ref > Gathorne-Hardy F.J.  &  Harcourt-Smith W.E.H. 2003.  The super-eruption of Toba: did it cause a human bottleneck?

 == Larger calderas == 
 Eruptions forming even larger calderas are known. At [[La Garita Caldera]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], the 5,000 & nbsp;km < sup > 3 < /sup >  Fish Canyon [[Tuff]] was blasted out in a single major eruption about 27.8 & nbsp;million years ago. 
 
 At some points in time, [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (formed during the [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Pliocene]] periods) or the [[Saint Francois Mountain Range]] of [[Missouri]] (erupted during the [[Proterozoic]]).
