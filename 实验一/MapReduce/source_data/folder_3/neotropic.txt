In context of [[biogeography]], '''Neotropic''' or '''Neotropical''' means one of the world's eight terrestrial [[ecozone]]s. 
 
 This ecozone includes South and Central America, the [[Mexico|Mexican]] lowlands, the [[Caribbean]] islands, and southern [[Florida]], because these regions share a large number of plant and animal groups. 
 
 It is sometimes used as a synonym for the tropical area of South America, although the ecozone also includes temperate southern South America.  
 Its fauna and flora are distinct from the [[Nearctic]] (which includes most of [[North America]]) because of the long separation of the two continents. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] joined the two continents 2 to 3 million years ago. 
 
 The Neotropic includes more tropical [[rainforest]] than any other ecozone. They extend from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil and include the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of [[biodiversity]] on [[Earth]]. Extensive [[deforestation]] in the late [[20th century]] has reduced this diversity to a degree.
