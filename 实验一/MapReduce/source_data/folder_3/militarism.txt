'''Militarism''' or '''militarist ideology''' is a view on [[society]]. 
 It says society should be like the [[military]]. 
 This means that society should follow concepts that can be found in the [[culture]], [[system]] and people of the military. People that say militarism is good are called ''militarists''. 
 
 Most important to militarists is [[discipline]]. Discipline means to follow a set of rules. 
 It also means training that follows such rules. A strong military is good for discipline. 
 There are many areas where [[moral]] goals and the culture of the military can be applied. Most notable are private [[business]], [[government]], [[education]] and [[entertainment]]. 
 
 Militarism is related to [[militarization]], and militarist countries often have a strong military.  Thus [[Sparta]] in Ancient Greece, and [[Prussia]] in the [[19th century]] were militarist and had more powerful armies than other states their size.  [[North Korea]] is a good example in modern times.  In militarist states the military either run the government, or greatly influence it.  Often the [[head of state]] is a military person, though that does not always mean the society is militarised.
