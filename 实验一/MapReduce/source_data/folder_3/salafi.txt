'''Salafism''' is a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Islamic]] movement originating in [[Arabia]]. A Salafist is a [[Muslim]] who thinks [[Islam]] should be practiced the way the first few generations of Muslims did.

 The origin of the movement is in the 19th century. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Understanding the Origins of Wahhabism and Salafism |url=https://jamestown.org/program/understanding-the-origins-of-wahhabism-and-salafism/ |access-date=2022-05-09 |website=Jamestown |language=en-US}} < /ref >  [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849{{ndash}}1905) was an Islamic [[scholar]] who thought that the values of Islam were compatible with a modern lifestyle.
