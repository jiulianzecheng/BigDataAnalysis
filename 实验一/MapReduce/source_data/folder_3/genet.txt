 '''Genets''' are [[Old World]] [[mammal]]s. They are viverrids, in the same [[family (biology)|family]] as [[civet]] cats. They are [[Feliformia|feliform]] carnivores of the family [[Viverridae]].  
 
 The closest relatives of genets are the [[civet]]s, [[linsang]]s, [[fossa]], and [[mongoose]]s. < ref name= " voice " > Jakowska, Sophie 2011. ''Genets''.

 Genets are highly agile creatures, with quick reflexes and exceptional climbing skills, and are the only viverrids that are able to stand [[bipedal]]ly. They are able to walk, trot, run, climb up and down trees, and jump. < ref name=Wemmer/ > 
 
 They often feed on small mammals, such as [[rodent]]s, [[shrew]]s, and [[bat]]s. < ref name= " Genet " / > < ref > Virgos, Emilio; Llorente, M.  &  Cortes Y. 1999.
