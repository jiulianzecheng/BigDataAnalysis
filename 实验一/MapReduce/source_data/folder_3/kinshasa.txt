 '''Kinshasa''' is the [[capital (city)|capital]] [[city]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (once called [[Zaire]]).  It is the third largest city in the [[continent]] of [[Africa]] (after [[Lagos]] and [[Cairo]]). < ref name= " Congo Kinshasa " > {{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2823.htm|title=Congo (Kinshasa)|publisher=U.S. Department of State}} < /ref >   About eleven million people live there.  Kinshasa is also a province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   
 
 Kinshasa is on one side of the [[Congo river]], and [[Brazzaville]], the capital of the Republic of Congo, is on the other side.  Kinshasa and Brazzaville are the nearest country capitals in the world. 
 
 [[Henry Morton Stanley]] founded (started) the town in [[1881]] and called it Léopoldville (after King [[Léopold II of Belgium]], who controlled the [[Congo Free State]], now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), next to a village called Nshasa or Kinshasa. < ref name= " Congo Kinshasa " / >   The city was originally private property (not public).  The post developed successfully as the first navigable port on the Congo River above [[Livingstone Falls]], a series of rapids over 300 kilometres (190 & nbsp;mi) below [[Leopoldville]].  At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between Léopoldville and [[Matadi]].  Later a railway went around the falls. 
 
 Léopoldville changed its name to Kinshasa in [[1966]].
