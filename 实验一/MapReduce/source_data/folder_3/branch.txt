 [[Image:branch.agr.jpg|thumb|A branch of a [[tree]].]] 
 A '''branch''' is the part of a [[tree]] that grows out from the [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a tree. The size of a branch may vary depending on the type of tree, the location of the branch relative to the tree, and how healthy the tree is. The term twig usually refers to a terminus, while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk.
