 '''Cold''' is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective [[warm]] (opposite of cold). Because it is relative, there is no range in coldness. The temperatures in the [[winter]] [[season]] are often categorized as being cold. Cold is the opposite of [[heat|hot]].   
 
 The coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °C, which can be expressed as −459.67 °F on the [[Fahrenheit]] scale. This is called [[absolute zero]]. Absolute zero is also 0 K on the [[Kelvin]] scale and 0 °R on the [[Rankine scale]] 
 
 ==Cooling== 
 Cooling is when an object gets cold, or lowers in [[temperature]]. This can happen by taking away heat, or by putting something in a place with a lower temperature. [[Fluid]]s used to cool objects are called [[coolant]]s. 
 
 [[Air cooling]] is making the temperature of an object lower using [[air]]. This will only work if the air is at a lower [[temperature]] than the object. The process will work better if there is more [[surface area]] on the object or if the item's [[mass]] can be made smaller. 
 
 Other ways to cool objects include using [[ice]], [[dry ice]], or liquid [[nitrogen]]. This works by [[convection]]; the [[heat]]  is taken from the relatively warm object to the relatively cold [[coolant]].
