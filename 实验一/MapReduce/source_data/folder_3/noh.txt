 '''Noh''' or '''No''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]:能 Nō) is a major form of classical Japanese musical drama. It started in the 14th century and continues today. Noh is made up of ''mai'' ([[dance]]s), ''hayashi'' ([[music]]) and ''utai'' (words usually in [[song]]s). The performers use [[mask]]s and dance slowly. [[Zeami]] and his father Kan'ami brought Noh to its present-day form during the [[Muromachi period]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url = http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2091.html|title = Noh Theater|first =|last =|date = 22 Feb 2016|website = japan-guide.com|publisher = japan-guide.com|accessdate = 1 June 2016}} < /ref >
