 A '''vortex''' (pl. ''vortices'') is a [[Rotation|spinning]], often [[Turbulence|turbulent]],  
 flow of [[fluid]]. The motion of the fluid [[wikt:swirl|swirling]] rapidly around a center is called a vortex. The speed and rate of [[rotation]] of the fluid are greatest at the center and become smaller with distance from the center.
