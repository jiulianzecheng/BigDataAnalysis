 '''Nestos''', or '''Mesta''', is a river in the [[Balkans]] that crosses two countries. Particularly, it starts from [[Bulgaria]], then goes to [[Greece]] and at the end it drains into the [[Aegean Sea]]. Its length is 230 [[km]]. 
 
 ==Line== 
 It starts between the southwestern area of the mountainy place called [[Rila]] and of the northwestern [[Rhodope Mountains]] in [[Bulgaria]]. Then it goes through the [[Pirin]] [[Prin Mountains|mountains]] and it gets a lot of water from other smaller rivers. It crosses the valley of [[Nevrokopi]] and continues between [[Orvilos]] and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]], entering [[Greece]] through [[Drama Prefecture]]. After that it goes to [[Xanthi Prefecture]] and cosses a narow and long valley. Eventually at the end, it goes through [[Xanthi]] and [[Chrysoupoli]] and it drains in the [[Aegean Sea]], making a big delta.  
 
 ==Usefulness== 
 It is a natural border between [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thrace]]. It is an important river for the people there because there is a valley so they can water their crops or drink water, take a bath, do watersports etc. [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] have been arguing for many years about Nestos. After a signed agreement in [[1995]] the copyrights of [[Bulgaria]] are 71% and [[Greece]]'s 29%.  < ref > [http://www.kavalanet.gr/keramoti/nestos.htm Usefulness and problems of Nestos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507122358/http://www.kavalanet.gr/keramoti/nestos.htm |date=2010-05-07 }} in Greek < /ref >
