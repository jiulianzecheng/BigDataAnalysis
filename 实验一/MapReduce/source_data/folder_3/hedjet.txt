 '''Hedjet''' is the name for the White Crown of [[Upper Egypt]], used in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The crown was white and after Lower and Upper Egypt joined together, it was combined with the [[Deshret]], the Red Crown of [[Lower Egypt]]. This Double Crown was called the [[Pschent]]. The [[symbol]] sometimes used for the Hedjet was the vulture goddess [[Nekhbet]]. This would be shown next to the head of the cobra goddess  [[Wadjet]], the [[Uraeus]]  on the [[Pschent]]. < ref > Arthur Maurice Hocart, ''The Life-Giving Myth'', Routledge 2004, p.209 < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The white crown has a long history, going back into the [[History of ancient Egypt#Predynastic period|Predynastic Period]]. This shows that kingship had been the base of Egyptian society for some time. The earliest image of the Hedjet was thought to have been in the Qustul in [[Nubia]]. New discoveries, particularly the excavation of Cemetery U and the tome U-j, dating to Naqada IIIA have shown that it appears earlier in Egypt. < ref name= " Roy " > {{cite book| last = Roy| first = Jane| title = The Politics of Trade: Egypt and Lower Nubia in the 4th Millennium BC| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9En6tzUJCXkC & pg=PA215| date = 2011| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 978-90-04-19610-0| page = 215 }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Nekhbet]], the protective goddess of Nekhebet (modern el Kab) near [[Hierakonpolis]], was shown as a woman, sometimes with the head of a vulture, wearing the White Crown. < ref > Cherine Badawi, ''Egypt'', 2004, p.550 < /ref >  The falcon god [[Horus]] of Hierakonpolis (Egyptian: Nekhen) was generally shown wearing a White Crown. < ref > Toby A. H. Wilkinson, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'', Routledge 1999, p.285 < /ref >  The White Crown is on the [[Narmer Palette]] found at Hierakonpolis. It shows the king of the South wearing the ''hedjet'', triumphing over his northern enemies.  The kings of the united Egypt saw themselves as successors of [[Horus]]. Vases from the reign of Khasekhemwy show the king as Horus wearing the White Crown. < ref > Jill Kamil, ''The Ancient Egyptians: Life in the Old Kingdom'', American Univ in Cairo Press 1996, p.61 < /ref > 
 
 As with the [[Deshret]] (Red Crown), no example of the White Crown has survived.  It is unknown how it was made or what materials were used. It is possible it was made from [[felt]] or leather. The fact that no crown has ever been found, might suggest that the crown was passed from one ruler to the next, much as in present day [[Monarchy|monarchies]].
