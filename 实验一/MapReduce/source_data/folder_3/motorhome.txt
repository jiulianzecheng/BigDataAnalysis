[[File:Class-Super-C-Motorhomes-Diesel-Class-C-RV.jpg|thumb|Example of a Class C motorhome]] 
 A '''motorhome''', '''recreational vehicle''' or in [[British English]], a '''caravan''' is a [[bus]]-like [[vehicle]] equipped for habitation, like a [[house]] on wheels. Typically, a motorhome will include a [[lounge]] area, dining area, small [[bathroom]], a [[galley]] \[[kitchen]] and a [[corridor]] leading to a rear [[bedroom]], though some have two or three bedrooms. 
 ==Classes== 
 Motorhomes generally fall into four classes: Class A, Class B, Class B+, and Class C. 
 ===Class A=== 
 '''Class A''' Motorhomes are one of the biggest RVs and can accommodate up to eight people. They offer all the features of a small apartment with the largest square footage when it comes to RVs and reaching 29-45 feet in length. This class offers slide outs, bottom storage, various awnings, full kitchen  &  bathroom, as you will usually find a queen size bed in the master bedroom. 
 ===Class B=== 
 '''Class B''' Motorhomes, also known as van campers, are the smallest type of motorhome and can accommodate up to four people. They range from 18 to 24 feet in length, have a cabin that is smaller than what is offered under classes A and C, and use less fuel. 
 ===Class B+=== 
 '''Class B+''' Motorhomes are like bigger versions of Class B motorhomes and offer a different set of luxuries. They bring together characteristics of Class B and Class C motorhomes and can feature bigger kitchens, living space, sleeping space with twin beds/sofa beds, and a stand-up shower/bath combo. 
 ===Class C=== 
 '''Class C''' Motorhomes represent something of a middle ground between Class A and Class B. They are great for couples or a group of friends and can sleep up to eight people, which is why they are popular with timeshare arrangements that allow for fractional ownership between different families. They offer all the typical luxuries of Class A motorhomes as well as generous amounts of space and have the appearance of a larger van camper with an overhead cabin.  < ref > {{cite web |last1=Cattanach |first1=Jamie |title=RV Classes: Types of Motorhomes and Towable Trailers |url=https://rvshare.com/blog/rv-classes/ |website=RVshare |accessdate=31 August 2023 |date=18 June 2020}} < /ref >
