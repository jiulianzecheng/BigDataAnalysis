 '''Dunkirk''' ({{lang-fr|Dunkerque}}, [[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/dœ̃kɛʀk/}} or {{IPA|/dɛ̃kɛʀk/}}; {{lang-nl|Duinkerke or Duinkerken}}) is a [[harbour]] city in the northernmost part of [[France]], 10 km (6 & nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) from the [[Belgium|Belgian]] border. 
   
 The population of the whole [[metropolitan area]] was of 265,974 at the 1999 census.  
 
 Until the middle of the 20th century the city was in the [[Dutch language]] area; today the local Dutch dialect still can be heard but has largely given way to French. 
 
 == History == 
 Dunkirk was first mentioned in 1067 as ''Dunkerk'' ({{lang-nl|Church of the Dunes}}).  
 
 In [[World War II]], heavy fighting took place around Dunkirk during the German invasion in 1940 ([[Battle of Dunkirk]]), but a lull in the action unexpectedly allowed a large number of French and British soldiers to escape to England. The British evacuation of Dunkirk through the English Channel was codenamed ''Operation Dynamo''.  
 During the war, Dunkirk was largely destroyed by bombing.
