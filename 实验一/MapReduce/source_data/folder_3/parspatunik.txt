 == History == 
 
 In antiquity, the main territory of Parspatunik (modern Karadag) was part of the [[Scythian]] state-tribal entity. In the western part of Parspatunik, [[Marand]], the center of the ancient region [[Sangibutu]],[[Ulhu]] was located [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOf9AgAAQBAJ & dq=%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%82%D1%83 & pg=PA104]. Then the region was part of the kingdom  of [[Urartu]]. Subsequently, these areas again fell into the power of the Scythians. They later became part of the [[Median Empire]]. After the division of the empire of [[Alexander the Great]],еаstern Parspatunik became part of the [[Media (region)|Media]] [[Atropatena]]. [[Artashes I]] annexed еastern Parspatunik  to Great Armenia during the military campaign [https://books.google.com/books?id=jZhCAAAAYAAJ] 
 [https://books.google.com/books?id=1i_YDQAAQBAJ & q=matiani & pg=PA262][https://books.google.com/books?id=1i_YDQAAQBAJ & q=A-mat-uni & pg=PA262]. < ref name= " scribd.com " / >  Marand was part of the Armenian kingdom before the conquests of King Artashes I. 
 
 The princely clan of Parspatuni descended from the Matianian kings of Sangibutu. 
 Having become princes, the naxarars of Parspatuni united under their rule the regions of Parspatunik and Marand, choosing the Marand's Bakurarakert(Greco-Roman Philadelphia) as their capital. 
 
 Parspatunik was not included into Vaspurakan after the second partition of Great Armenia in 591 by the Roman and [[Sasanids]] empires. 
 
 Then, later, under the rule of the [[Arab caliphate]], the region is no longer part of Vaspurakan. < ref > [https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/genezis-derzhavy-armyanskih-bagratidov-v-usloviyah-arabskoy-vlasti.pdf 1] < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://updoc.site/download/5acf317913ded_pdf | title= & #91;PDF & #93; САНКТ-ПЕТЕРБУРГСКИЙ ГОСУДАРСТВЕННЫЙ УНИВЕРСИТЕТ На правах рукописи ШАГИНЯН - Free Download PDF | access-date=2019-12-29 | archive-date=2019-11-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106095952/https://updoc.site/download/5acf317913ded_pdf | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The population of Parspatunik was significantly Islamized during the Caliphate. 
 
 == Geographical location and population == 
 
 Parspatunik was located between the river [[Araxes]] from the north and [[Parthian empire]] in the south. 
 
 The wooded mountain range of Parspatunik(Matiani mts.) was also known in Antiquity as Αρμενιωο Ορη - the Armenian Mountains, in which there was a passage Αρμενιων πυλών - Armenian Gate (Դրունք Հայոց), what  was described in the III-rd century B.C. by a Greek author [[Eratosthenes]](280-202 B.C.) and mentioned again by a XIV-th century Muslim historiographer [[Hamballah Ghazvini]]. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > {{Cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/document/322338811/ETHNOGRAPHY-OF-THE-GHARADAGH-ARMENIANS |title = ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE GHARADAGH ARMENIANS  & #124; Armenians  & #124; Armenia}} < /ref >  The road passing through the Armenian Gate in the Middle Ages led to the famous Khudapery Bridge. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://openarmenia.am/index.php?/topic/26102-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/ |title = Армяне Парспатуника}} < /ref > 
 
 By its geographical position, Parspatunik was located on the border of the Armenian and Parthian kingdoms. This circumstance explains the Armenian name of the region, which translates as “Wall of Persia” from the words “Pars”(Persia) and “pat”(wall), due to the fact that the Matiani mountains of Parspatunik served as the ancient border between Armenia and Iran.

 In the I-VI centuries, this region was the 26th ghawar(region) and the principality of the Armenian province of Vaspurakan, as mentioned by the 7th-century Armenian geographer and historian [[Anania Shirakatsi]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=1i_YDQAAQBAJ & q=%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8 & pg=PA262]. 
 
 The population of Parspatunik consisted mоstly of Iranian(Atropatenian and Caspian) tribes. 
 The Armenian population, previously [[Matiene]] and [[Alarodian]] tribes, was concentrated in the towns and wooded mountainous areas near the fortresses, where it still existing to this day in modern [[Iran]]. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenians-of-modern-iran|title=ARMENIANS OF MODERN IRAN – Encyclopaedia Iranica|author=electricpulp.com|publisher=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}} < /ref > 
 
 In the mountainous wooded territory of Parspatunik (Karadag), adjacent to the right bank of the Araxes, there were small Armenian melikdoms until the end of the [[First World War]]. < ref name= " ReferenceA " / > < ref > {{cite web | url=http://armenianhouse.org/raffi/novels-ru/khamsa/meliks41_46.html | title=Раффи - Меликства Хамсы }} < /ref > < ref > https://iarmenia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Khamsa-Union.png < /ref >

 The modern historical region of Parspatunik is located on the territory of the Iranian region [[Arasbaran]](Karadag) and was abandoned by the majority of the Armenian population during the repatriation period 1946-1947. A large number of monuments of Armenian architecture have been preserved in the region. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://www.tert.am/en/news/2011/07/25/samvelkarapetyan2/318650 | title=Armenian monuments in Iran sponsored by government, Armenian expert says | access-date=2019-12-29 | archive-date=2019-11-06 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106183905/https://www.tert.am/en/news/2011/07/25/samvelkarapetyan2/318650 | url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name= " :4 " > {{cite journal |last1=Charchian |first1=Tadevos |last2=Hovhannisian |first2=Diana |title=Łaradałi hayer∂ [Armenians of Gharadagh], vol. 1.
