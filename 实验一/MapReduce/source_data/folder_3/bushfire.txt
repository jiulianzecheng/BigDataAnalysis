 A '''bushfire''' is a [[wildfire]] that happens mostly in the Australian [[The Bush|bush]]. Bush is the word for [[scrubland|scrub]], [[woodland]] or [[grassland]] of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. In south east and south west of Australia, bushfires are most common in the summer and early autumn. In the north of Australia, bushfires usually happen during winter which is the dry season. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://burarra.questacon.edu.au/pages/seasons.html | title=Monsoonal Climate | accessdate=2006-09-09 | format=html | publisher=Questacon | archive-date=2012-03-21 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66Kmfa8wW?url=http://burarra.questacon.edu.au/pages/seasons.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=BW > {{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/fire_ag/bushfire/threat.htm |title= The Bushfire Threat|accessdate=2008-10-24 |format= |work= Bushfire Weather}} < /ref >  Many Australian plants burn easily.
