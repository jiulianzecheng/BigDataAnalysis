'''Subduction''' is when two [[tectonic plate]]s meet. One of the plates is pushed under the other into the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Subduction causes the most powerful [[earthquake]]s in the world. Earthquakes caused by subduction can lead to [[tsunami]]s.  
 
 Areas where subduction occurs are called subduction zones. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Stern |first=R.J. |year=2002 |title=Subduction zones |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=40 |page=1012 |doi=10.1029/2001RG000108 |bibcode=2002RvGeo..40.1012S |issue=4|s2cid=15347100 }} < /ref >  Subduction zones are all around the world in places like [[Indonesia]], [[Seattle]], [[Washington]] and in the [[Himalaya]] mountain range in [[Nepal]].
