Saint '''Cuthbert''' (c. 634 â€“ 20 March 687) was an [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[monk]], [[bishop]] and [[hermit]] associated with the monasteries of Melrose and Lindisfarne in the Kingdom of [[Northumbria]], at that time including, in modern terms, northern England as well as south-eastern Scotland as far north as the [[Firth of Forth]]. Afterwards he became one of the most important medieval saints of England, his cult being centred at [[Durham Cathedral]]. Cuthbert is regarded as the [[patron saint]] of [[northern England]]. His feast day is 20 March. 
 
 ==Biography== 
 In 676 he began the life of a hermit and [[wikt:retire|retired]] to a cave on [[Lindisfarne]]. After a time he settled on one of the Farne Islands, south of Lindisfarne, and made his life more simple.  
 
 In 684, Cuthbert was chosen to be bishop of Lindisfarne, at a synod at Twyford (believed to be present-day [[Alnmouth]]), < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=s47SQJS-ekMC & dq=alnmouth & pg=PA504 ''The Gentleman's Magazine''], volume XXXVIII, 1852 page 500 from [[Google Book Search]] < /ref >  but was unwilling to leave his retirement and take up his charge. It was only after a visit from a large group, including King Ecgfrith, that he agreed to return and take up the duties of bishop. He was [[consecration|consecrated]] at [[York]] on 26 March 685. After [[Christmas]], 686, however, he returned to his cell on Inner Farne Island, which was where he eventually died on 20 March 687 AD. He was buried at Lindisfarne, and his remains later moved to Durham Cathedral.
