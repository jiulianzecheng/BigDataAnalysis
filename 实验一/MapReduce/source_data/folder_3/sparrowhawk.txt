 The '''sparrowhawk ''' (''Accipiter nisus'') is a small [[bird of prey]] in the family [[Accipitridae]]. It has a wide distribution in [[Eurasia]] and north [[Africa]]. 
 
 The adult male sparrowhawk has a blue-grey back and [[wing]]s. His chest and belly have thin orange stripes. Female and young sparrowhawks have brown backs and wings, with thin brown stripes. The female is up to 25% larger than the male. This is one of the biggest size differences in any bird species. 
 
 The sparrowhawk eats mostly small birds which live in [[woodland]]. It can be seen in any [[habitat]] and often hunts birds in [[town]] and [[city]] [[gardens]]. Male sparrowhawks eat smaller birds like [[Paridae|tits]], [[finch]]es and [[sparrow]]s. Females eat bigger birds like [[Turdidae|thrush]]es and [[starling]]s. They can kill birds weighing more than {{convert|500|g|oz}}. 
 
 The sparrowhawk is seen in [[Europe]], parts of [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]]. Birds that [[Sexual reproduction|breed]] in the north [[Migration|migrate]] south for winter. Birds that live further south stay there, or fly shorter distances. 
 
 Sparrowhawks build a [[nest]] in woodland. The nest is up to 60 & nbsp;cm (2.0 & nbsp;ft) wide and made from twigs. The female lays four or five [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] with pale blue shells. The [[chick]]s [[Bird#Hatching|hatch]] after 33 days and leave the nest after another 24 to 28 days. 
 
 The proportion of young sparrowhawks which survive to one year old is 34%. More young males die than young females. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The [[average]] [[lifespan]] is four years. 
 
 The number of sparrowhawks decreased in Europe in the 1950s. [[Chemical]]s to kill unwanted [[insects]] ( " pesticides " ) were put on [[seed]]s before they were planted. Small birds ate the seeds and then sparrowhawks ate the small birds. The amount of chemicals in the [[food chain]] increased. This affected the sparrowhawks. Some were poisoned and others laid eggs with shells that were too thin. The shells broke before the chicks hatched. The pesticides were banned and the sparrowhawk population increased again. It is now one of the commonest birds of prey in Europe. 
 
 The sparrowhawk's hunting behaviour means people who own [[homing pigeon]]s or keep birds for food may dislike it. Some people also blame the sparrowhawk for decreases in the numbers of [[passerine|smaller birds]]. Scientists have found that increased numbers of sparrowhawks did not reduce the numbers of birds living in [[farm]]land and [[woodland]] in the 1960s. Research in [[Scotland]] found that less than 1% of homing pigeons that died were killed by sparrowhawks. 
 
 People have used the Sparrowhawk for [[falconry]] (hunting using a bird of prey) for more than 500 years. It is difficult to train but brave. The sparrowhawk features in some old [[Germany|German]] myths. It is mentioned in a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[William Shakespeare]] and a [[poem]] by [[Ted Hughes]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 The sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail. These [[adaptation]]s help it to fly between [[tree]]s. Females can be up to 25% larger than males < ref name= " bto " / >  and can be twice as heavy. < ref name= " bto " / >  When females are larger than males, it is called  " reverse [[Sexual dimorphism#Sexual dimorphism in birds|sexual dimorphism]] " . It is unusual in higher [[vertebrate]]s but typical in birds of prey. < ref >

 The adult male is {{convert|29|–|34|cm|in|abbr=on}} long from beak to tail, with a [[wingspan]] of {{convert|59|–|64|cm|in|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " bto " / >  He weighs {{convert|110|–|196|g|oz|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " hbw158 " > del Hoyo, Josep; Elliott, Andrew  &  Sargatal, Jordi 1994.

His chest and belly have thin red stripes but they can look orange from a distance. His [[eye]]s are orange-yellow or orange-red. 
 
 [[File:Accipiter nisus 9194.JPG|thumb|200px|The yellow eye of this young male sparrowhawk (caught for [[Bird ringing|ringing]]) may turn orange]] 
 
 The female is much larger – {{convert|35|–|41|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a wingspan of {{convert|67|–|80|cm|in|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " bto " / >  She weighs {{convert|185|–|342|g|oz|abbr=on}}. < ref name= " hbw158 " / >  The female has dark brown or grey-brown back and wings, and brown stripes on her chest and belly. Her eyes are bright yellow to orange. 
 
 Young sparrowhawks have a  brown back and wings, with rust-coloured edges to the [[feather]]s. They have bigger brown stripes and spots on their chest and belly, and pale yellow eyes. 
 
 The Sparrowhawk's pale underparts and darker back and wings are an example of [[countershading]]. This colouration counteracts the effect of light coming from above, and helps to make the bird less visible. In fact, countershading is seen in most animals, < ref > Cott, Hugh B. 1940 ''Adaptive colouration in animals''. Oxford University Press. < /ref >  including the [[Peregrine Falcon]], the [[Merlin]] and other ''Accipiters''. The Sparrowhawk's stripes are typical of markings on birds of prey which live in woodland. < ref name= " newton28 " > Newton 1986, pp.28–30 < /ref > 
 
 Sparrowhawks fly in a pattern described as  " flap-flap-glide " . The glide means that the flight has an up-and-down pattern. < ref name= " collins " > {{cite book |last = Mullarney |first = Killian |others= Svensson, Lars; Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter |title = Collins Bird Guide |year = 1999 |location=London |publisher = HarperCollins |pages = 92–93|isbn = 0-00-219728-6}} < /ref >  In [[Great Britain]], Sparrowhawks living further north have longer wings than birds in the south. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Wyllie|first1=I.|last2=Newton|first2=I.|date=2008-04-03|title=Latitudinal variation in the body-size of Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus within Britain|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb01118.x|journal=Ibis|language=en|volume=136|issue=4|pages=434–440|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb01118.x}} < /ref >  The sparrowhawk has a small, hooked beak. It is used for removing the feathers of its prey. The sparrowhawk's long legs and toes help it to catch and eat birds. Its middle toe is very long and is used to grab things. < ref name= " newton28 " / > 
 
 == Lifespan == 
 Most sparrowhawks live for about four years. 34% of young birds survive to be one year old. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. < ref name= " bto " / >  The oldest known wild sparrowhawk lived for more than 20 years. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.euring.org/data_and_codes/longevity-voous.htm |title=European Longevity Records |publisher=EURING: The European Union for Ringing |access-date=21 Feb 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Young sparrowhawks (less than one year old) weigh less than adults. They are especially light in the two months after leaving the nest. There is probably a high death rate at this time, particularly for males. < ref name= " weights " > {{cite journal| last1=Newton |first1=I. |last2= Marquiss |first2=M. |last3=Village |first3=A. |date=April 1983 |title= Weights, Breeding, and Survival in European Sparrowhawks |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v100n02/p0344-p0354.pdf |journal=The Auk |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=344–354 |doi=10.1093/auk/100.2.344 }} < /ref >  This may be because the smaller males catch smaller food. They cannot catch some of the bigger prey that females can. This means they need to eat more often. A female sparrowhawk of average weight can survive for seven days without eating. A male can survive only four days. < ref > Newton (1986) pp. 291–294 < /ref >
