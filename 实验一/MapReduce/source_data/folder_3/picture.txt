 A '''picture''', also called an '''image''', is a group of [[colour]]ed [[Dot|points]] on a flat [[surface]] that [[Sight|look]]s the same as something else. For example, a picture can look the same as an [[wikt:object|object]] or a [[person]]. Pictures can also be [[drawing]] < nowiki/ > s, [[painting]]s or [[photograph]]s. People who make such pictures are called [[artist]]s, [[photographer]]s or [[painter]]s.  Pictures are very helpful.  Sometimes people say pictures are worth a thousand [[word]]s.  Pictures and [[diagram]]s can be used to explain how to do things, and thus a picture is a kind of [[tool]]. A moment captured in an image.

 An '''image''' is something that can be seen, but it is not physically there.  It can be a [[photograph]], a [[painting]], or a picture on a [[television]] or [[computer]] screen.  A [[Lens (optics)|lens]] can make an image of an [[object]] appear somewhere else.  [[Camera]]s use this to make the image that becomes a [[photograph]]. 
 
 ==Making Pictures== 
 [[File:Drawing of a Painter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Drawing of a painter showing his picture]] 
 Most pictures today are '[[photograph]]s'. Photographs are made with [[camera]]s. A camera makes a picture that looks very [[real]]. 
 
 When there were no [[camera]]s, people made pictures by using paint, [[brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[pen]]s, and other things that people can [[writing|write]] or [[drawing|draw]] with. Pictures made with [[paint]] and brush are called 'paintings'. Before cameras, some [[artist]]s were able to make very real looking pictures with just paint. Sometimes pictures made with [[pencil]] or [[pen]] are called '[[sketch]]es', if they are made quickly and only look a little bit like the real thing. 
 
 Usually pictures are put on [[paper]]. Pictures made with paint are usually put on a strong, rough [[fabric]] called '[[canvas]]'. Sometimes pictures can be [[mural|put on wall]]s or other things, even [[glass]].

 Some places, such as [[Church (building)|church]]es have pictures on [[window]]s made out of [[color]]ed pieces of glass. These are called ''[[stained glass]]''. 
 
 == Special types of Pictures == 
 
 If people take a lot of pictures, and show them one at a time, very fast, they can make a picture that looks like it is moving.  This is called a  " moving picture " , or a [[movie]].  A [[television]] shows people a moving picture by using [[light]].  
 
 A slide show is a series of pictures arranged to tell a story, for example to illustrate a [[narrative]].   
 
 A [[projector]] shines light from a [[light bulb]] through a kind of [[transparent]] picture.  When [[light]] shines through this kind of picture onto a [[screen]] or another flat place, the picture can be seen on that flat place.  This is often used to show movies and slide shows to an audience. 
 
 Some people make pictures that do not look flat, by taking two regular flat pictures at the same time. People have to move their eyes in a special way or use a stereoscope so they can see both pictures together.  When they look at the pictures using their [[binocular vision]] correctly, the picture does not look flat.  This is called '[[3D]]' or 'three [[dimension]]al'.
