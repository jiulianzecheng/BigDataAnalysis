A '''gate''' is a place between two parts of a [[wall]], or a [[fence]] which could be opened and closed to let people go through it. 
 
 In the Middle Ages, a [[city gate]] also allowed people to go into a (walled) [[city]]. 
 
 Nowadays, people also talk about ''gates'' at [[airport]]s. When going on an [[aircraft]], people need to get together in a certain area of the airport first. They then pass through some kind of [[door]]way to get onto the plane. That is what is called ''gate''.
