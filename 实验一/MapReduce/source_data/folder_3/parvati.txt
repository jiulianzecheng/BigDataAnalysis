 According to [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu mythology]], '''Parvati''' is considered to be a mother goddess by many people. Parvati is a word in the [[Sanskrit language]] that means  " daughter of the [[mountain]] " . Hindu teachings call Parvati the daughter of the [[Himalayas]] Mountains, where she is said to live. She has two sons, [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]] with her husband [[Shiva]]. Shiva is one of the main [[Deity|gods]] of the [[Hindu]] religion.

In her form with two arms, Parvati holds her right hand up in blessing and holds a [[Nymphaea|lotus flower]] in her left hand.
