 '''Jersey''' is an [[island]] in the [[English Channel]] off the northwest coast of [[France]]. It is a [[Crown dependencies|Crown Dependency]] of the [[British monarchs|British monarchy]]. Jersey is a [[bailiwick]]. The '''Bailiwick of Jersey''' also includes the islands of the [[Minquiers]] and [[Écréhous]], where nobody lives. The other islands of the [[Channel Islands]] belong to the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]]. The country code (also used for internet) is '''JE'''. 
 
 Over 106 000 people live on the main island. Thirty per cent of them live in its only town, [[Saint Helier]]. 
 
 Along with [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], more than two thousand people speak [[Jèrriais]], a local variation of the [[Norman language]]. 
 
 == Politics == 
 Jersey is not a part of the [[United Kingdom]] or of the [[European Union]], but the [[Charles III|King of the UK]] is the King of Jersey as well. It has its own [[parliament]] called the ''States of Jersey'' which passes laws for the island. 
 
 The ''Chief Minister'' of Jersey is in charge of the government. Since the 2022 election, Kristina Moore has been the Chief Minister. She is the first woman to have the job. 
 
 Jersey is divided into 12 [[parish]]es which elect their own politicians and have control over some roads and the ''Honorary'' (volunteer) police. 
 
 == History == 
 [[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|A painting of the Battle of Jersey]] 
 People have lived in the area for about 6,000 years. This was before the [[sea level]] went up and made Jersey an island. There are many very old buildings like {{Lang|fr|La Hougue Bie}}. 
 
 The island was joined to [[Normandy]] in 933. Normandy then took control of England in 1066, but Jersey was still in Normandy, not in England. In 1204, [[John of England|King John]] lost his land in France, but the Channel Islanders wanted to be ruled by the [[List of English monarchs|English king]], not the [[List of French monarchs|French king]]. Because the Channel Islands chose England over France, the English kings let them have their own laws and governments. 
 
 During the [[English Civil War]] (1642-1651), the future [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] stayed in Jersey because the important Islanders supported the monarchy. When he became King, Charles II gave one of these people a [[colony]] in [[United States|America]], which became [[New Jersey]]. 
 
 In 1769, there was not a lot of food and the rich were selling food made in the island to other countries. Many islanders went to St Helier, rioted and took over the Royal Court. In 1771, the British Government made changes, like introducing a single book of laws and stopping the Royal Court making laws in the future without the [[States Assembly|States]]. 
 
 Jersey was invaded by the French in the Battle of Jersey in 1781. Major Pierson led an army to fight the French in the Royal Square and won, but he died in the fight. 
 
 In Victorian times, the island become more British. More people started to talk in English and more English people moved to the island. 
 
 During [[World War II|World War 2]], Jersey was controlled by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. It was freed on 9 May 1945, which is called Liberation Day and is the national day of Jersey. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Jersey is an island. It is in the English Channel, a sea in between France and England. It is 22 kilometres (14 miles) from France and 160 kilometres (100 miles) from England. It is the biggest of the ''Channel Islands'', a group of islands. The other big Channel Island is called [[Guernsey]]. 
 
 The island is around 9 miles from east to west and 5 miles from north to south, so it is often called  " nine-by-five " . 
 
 == Climate == 
 Ths island has mild summers and mild winters. In summer, it is normally 12 to 20 degrees [[Celsius]]. In the winter, it is normally 4 to 9 degrees Celsius.

 == Culture == 
 Jersey's culture is a mixture of [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] culture. The people speak English, but the old language is called [[Jèrriais]], which is like French. 
 
 Because Jersey is an island, fish is a popular food in the island. There is a fish market in the middle of St Helier which sells fresh fish. Jersey is famous for its milk (from Jersey Cows) and its potatoes (called ''Jersey Royals''). 
 
 Jersey's newspaper is called the ''Jersey Evening Post'' which has been printed since 1890. 
 
 There is a musical festival every year called ''the Weekender'' which happens in Trinity. 
 
 The ''Jersey Eisteddfod'' is a big art, music, drama, language and dance competition that happens every year. Many islanders take part and are given [[certificate]]s. 
 
 Jersey takes part in the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the Island Games (which happened in Jersey in 1997 and 2015). Jersey does not have famous sports teams, so islanders who can play sports really well often play for England or other countries in the UK. 
 
 == Economy == 
 Jersey has a lot of [[finance]] companies who manage people's money. Some call it a [[Offshore investment|tax haven]] because it has low taxes and many people use its businesses to pay lower taxes.

 == Parishes == 
 There are 12 parishes on the island.

The harbour of the island is in St Helier where boats take people to England and France. There is a castle called ''Elizabeth Castle'' on a small island near the town. 
 
 '''Saint Saviour''' is on the east of Saint Helier. There are lots of houses and many people who live here work in Saint Helier. 
 
 '''Saint Clement''' is in the south east of the island. It is the smallest parish in area. 
 
 '''Grouville''' is next to Saint Clement. It has a large [[golf course]] and a very old building called ''La Hougue Bie.'' 
 
 '''Saint Martin''' is north of Grouville. It has a large castle in the village of Gorey called ''Mont Orgeuil Castle''. 
 
 '''Trinity''' has lots of farms. Jersey's [[zoo]] is in Trinity. 
 
 '''Saint John''' is in the north of the island. ''Sorel Point'' is the most northern point of the island. 
 
 '''Saint Mary''' has the smallest number of people than any other parish. 
 
 '''Saint Ouen''' is the biggest parish in area. It has Saint Ouen's Bay, a large beach which is good for [[surfing]]. 
 
 '''Saint Peter''' has the island's [[airport]]. 
 
 '''Saint Brelade''' has a beach that many people like called ''St Brelade's Bay'' and a [[lighthouse]] called ''Corbière Lighthouse''.
