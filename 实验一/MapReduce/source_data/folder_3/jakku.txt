'''Jakku''' is a [[desert]] [[planet]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''. The planet first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the first installment in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]]. Jakku is very sparsely populated because of its harsh climate. After the Battle of [[Endor]], Jakku was the sight of a big battle between the remaining [[Imperial fleet (Star Wars)|Imperial fleet]] and the newly formed [[New Republic]] [[New Republic fleet|fleet]]. As soldiers fought each other in the desert and [[dogfight]]s took place above, the large cruisers from the fleets started to drag each other to the surface of the planet with their tractor beams. Ships crashed to surface causing a  " graveyard "  of ships to form. The Republic fleet won the battle and the remaining Imperial forces fled into the unknown regions of the galaxy. [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey Skywalker]] is from Jakku and helped [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]] escape the planet with [[BB-8]] after the [[First Order]] massacred a village and started to look for Finn, after he deserted. A year later the people of Jakku rose up against the First Order as part of a galaxy wide rebellion after the Battle of [[Exegol]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''. < ref name= " Wookieepedia " > {{cite web |title=Wookieepedia |url=https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jakku |access-date=2 January 2021}} < /ref >
