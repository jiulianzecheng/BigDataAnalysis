 '''Peeps''' are [[marshmallow]]s sold in the United States and Canada. They are shaped like ducks, bunnies, and other animals. There are also different shapes used for many [[holidays]].  
 
 Peeps are used to fill [[Easter]] baskets. In recent years, they have been advertised as  " Peeps - Always in Season " . They are now used to celebrate [[Halloween]], [[Christmas]] and [[Valentine's Day]].  
 
 They are made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, various food dyes (never blue dye), and a pinch of salt. < ref > {{cite web |author=Lehner, Marla |title=The Power of Peeps |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,84455,00.html |work=[[Fox News]] |date=2003-04-17 |access-date=2009-04-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305185448/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C84455%2C00.html |archive-date=2009-03-05 }} < /ref >
