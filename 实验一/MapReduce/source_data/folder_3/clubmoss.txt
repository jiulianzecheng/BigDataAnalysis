 '''Clubmosses''' are a group of plants in the [[Lycopodiophyta]], which are the most ancient group of land plants. The clubmosses are an [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Lycopodiales''', (or a [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] '''Lycopodiopsida'''). 
 
 Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest [[vascular plant]]s, with small, scale-like leaves, homosporous [[spore]]s borne in [[sporangium|sporangia]] at the bases of the leaves, branching stems (usually dichotomous), and generally simple form. 
 
 A powder known simply as ''lycopodium'', consisting of dried spores of the common clubmoss, was used in Victorian theater to produce flame-effects. A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly, but with little heat. It was considered safe by the standards of the time. 
 
 == Taxonomy == 
 The group is now split into two families: 
 *Lycopodiaceae: the typical clubmosses. Their spores are on a club-like structure. Their typical [[chromosome]] count is n=34. 
 *Huperziaceae: the firmosses. Their spore-bearing structures are in the axils of unmodified leaves. The family has a [[basal]] [[chromosome]] count of n=67.
