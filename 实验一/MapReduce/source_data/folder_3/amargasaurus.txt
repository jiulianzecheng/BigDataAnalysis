 '''''Amargasaurus''''' was a [[sauropod]] from the early [[Cretaceous]] period. It grew to 10 meters (33 feet) length, which was relatively small for a sauropod. It was a quadrupedal [[herbivore]] with a long, low skull on the end of a long neck, much like its relative ''[[Dicraeosaurus]]''. 
 
 ''Amargasaurus'' was found in [[La Amarga (Province)|La Amarga]], a [[canyon]] in  [[Neuquén Province]], [[Argentina]]. 
 
 == Features == 
 ''Amargasaurus'' had two tall rows of spines on top of its backbone along the neck and back. < ref name= " novas2009 " > Novas, Fernando E. 2009. ''The age of dinosaurs in South America''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-253-35289-7}} < /ref > {{rp|174}} The [[Function (biology)|function]] of the spines is not known. They may have operated as a defence from [[theropod]] attack from above. Another idea is that they supported a sail-like structure. 
 
 The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row. < ref name= " novas2009 " / > {{rp|174}} They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips. < ref name= " novas2009 " / > {{rp|174}} The tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck, where they reached 60 & nbsp;cm on the 8th cervical. < ref name= " novas2009 " / > {{rp|174}} On the neck, they were bowed backwards, projecting above the adjacent vertebra. < ref name= " upchurch2004 " > Upchurch P; Barrett P.M,  &  Dodson P. 2004. Sauropoda. In: Weishampel D.B; Dodson P.  &  Osmolska H. (eds) ''The Dinosauria''. 2nd ed, Berkeley: University of California Press, 259–322. < /ref > {{rp|304}} Greatly elongated spines continue along the last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip and foremost tail. However, in these regions the spines were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle-shaped upper end. < ref name= " bailey1997 " > Bailey, Jack Bowman 1997.
