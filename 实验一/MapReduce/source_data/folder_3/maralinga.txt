 ==Damage== 
 Referred to as  " Section 400 "  this secret operation exposed surrounding Indigenous communities to [[radiation]] by contaminating the soil and water sources. Walter MacDougal, who threatened to go to the press, was tasked with searching 100, 000km by car to alert local Aboriginals, of the dangers, in some cases forcing them to leave their home. Despite this over one thousand Indigenous people were exposed to radiation, alternatively known as ''black mist'' by the locals. < ref > {{Citation|title=Living with the legacy of British Nuclear testing: Bobby Brown|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHWnQWmZjP8|language=en|access-date=2022-08-10}} < /ref > 
 ==Aftermath== 
 The radiation was evaluated in a report in 1985 when the government took measures to begin resettling the town. In response to this the British Government sent â‚¤20 in reparations to the Australian government who provided the local Aboriginal community with $13.5 million AUD in compensation. 
 
 The town was returned to the Tjarutja people in November 2009, over half a century since the testing began.
