 '''Archimedes of Syracuse''' ({{circa|287|212{{nbsp}}BC}}) < ref > {{cite book|author=Evans I.O.|title=Inventors of the world|page=11|publisher=Warne|date=1962}} < /ref >  was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[scientist]]. He was an [[inventor]], an [[astronomer]], and a [[mathematician]]. He was born in the town of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] in [[Sicily]]. 
 
 His father was [[Phidias]], an [[astronomer]], and he may have been in the family of a king of Syracuse. Syracuse was a rich Greek city, on the seashore in Sicily. When Archimedes was about ten years old, he left Syracuse to study in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. He was in the school of [[Euclid]], a famous [[mathematician]]. Not much is known about the [[biography|personal life]] of Archimedes, for example, whether he was married or if he had children. 
 
 When the Romans invaded Syracuse, they captured Archimedes so they could learn all of the things he knew. About two years after he was drawing a mathematical diagram in the sand and enraged a soldier by refusing to go to meet the Roman general until he had finished working on the problem. The Roman killed him. His last words are supposed to have been  " Do not disturb my circles! " 
 
 == Spherical geometry == 
 ''On the Sphere and Cylinder'' is a work that was published by Archimedes in two volumes in about 225 BC. < ref > Dunham, William 1990. ''Journey through genius''. NY: Wiley, p99. {{ISBN|0-471-50030-5}} < /ref >  On the sphere, he showed that the surface area is four times the area of its [[great circle]]. In modern terms, this means that the surface area is equal to: 
 : < math > A_{S} = 4\pi r^2.\, < /math > < ref > {{mathworld|urlname=Sphere|title=Sphere}} Retrieved on 2008-06-22 < /ref > 
 The surface area of a cylinder is equal to: 
 : < math > A_{C} = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h = 2 \pi r ( r + h ).\, < /math > 
 The volume of the cylinder is: 
 : < math > V_{C} = \pi r^2 h. \, < /math > < ref > Dunham, William 1994. The mathematical niverse. NY: Wiley, p226. {{ISBN|0-471-53656-3}} < /ref > 
 The volume of the contained ball is two-thirds the volume of a  " circumscribed "  [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. < ref > 'contained' and 'circumscribed': ball fits exactly into the cylinder, touching the edges of the cylinder < /ref >  meaning that the volume is 
 : < math > V_{S} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3, < /math > 
 
 A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request. 
 
 == Archimedes the scientist == 
 Archimedes is also well known for being the first person to understand [[statics]], which is a part o f [[applied mathematics]]. It has to do with loads that do not move, for example in [[building]]s or [[bridge]]s. He also understood and wrote about what happens when things [[wikt:flotation|float]] in [[liquid]]s, which is called [[buoyancy]]. 
 [[File:Archimedes water balance.gif|thumb|right|180px|Archimedes may have used his principle of buoyancy to determine whether the golden crown was less [[density|dense]] than solid gold.]]

 [[Archimedes' principle]]: the weight of water displaced by an object equals the amount of [[buoyancy]] it gets. It has practical uses. It can be used to measure the [[density]] of an object, and hence whether or not it is made of [[gold]]. 
 
 The story of the golden crown does not appear in the surviving works of Archimedes. Archimedes may have got a solution known in [[fluid statics|hydrostatics]] as [[Archimedes' principle]], which he describes in his treatise ''On Floating Bodies''. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. < ref > Carroll, Bradley W. 2007. ''Archimedes' Principle''. Weber State University  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808132323/http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm] < /ref >  Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] considered it  " probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself " . < ref name= " galileo " > Rorres, Chris 2009. ''The golden crown: Galileo's balance''. Drexel University. [http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/bilancetta.html] < /ref > 
 
 == Archimedes, the inventor and engineer == 
 Archimedes is also famous as an [[inventor]] because he made new [[tool]]s and [[machine]]s. For example, he made a [[machine]] to lift [[water]] that could be used by [[farm]]ers to bring [[water]] to their [[crop]]s. This is called [[Archimedes' screw]]. 
 
 Archimedes probably also invented a machine to [[measure]] [[distance]], an [[odometer]]. A [[cart]] was built with [[wheel]]s that turned four hundred times in one [[mile]]. A [[pin]] on the wheel would hit a 400-[[tooth]] [[gear]], so it turned once for every mile. This gear would then make a small [[stone]] fall into a [[Container|cup]]. At the end of a [[journey]] one could count the number of stones in the cup to find the [[distance]]. 
 
 Archimedes also made a system which one person could pull a large [[ship]] with just one [[rope]]. This was called the [[compound pulley]]. This is an important machine which is even today helps people in everyday [[life]], although the [[version]]s we now use are much more complicated. They still work by the same [[principle]], through. 
 
 == Archimedes at war == 
 Archimedes also [[inventor|invented]] or made many machines used in war, for example he made better [[catapult]]s. This was during the [[Punic Wars]], which were between [[Rome]] in what is now [[Italy]] and the city of [[Carthage]] in what is now [[North Africa]]. For many years he helped stop the [[Roman army]] from attacking Syracuse, his city. One war machine was called the  " claw of Archimedes " , or the  " iron hand " . It was used to defend the city from attacks by ships. Ancient writers said that it was a kind of [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a [[hook]] that lifted [[ship]]s out of the water and caused their [[wikt:destruction|destruction]]. 
 
 Another story about Archimedes is that he burned Roman ships from far away using many [[mirror]]s and the [[light]] from the [[sun]]. This is perhaps possible, but it is perhaps more likely that this was done with [[flame|flaming]] [[missile]]s from a [[catapult]]. 
 
 == Tributes to Archimedes == 
 Archimedes is thought to be so important as a [[mathematician]] that [[scientist]]s have [[honor|honoured]] him: 
 * A large hole or [[crater]] on the [[moon]] is named after Archimedes. 
 * Some [[mountain]]s on the moon are called the Montes Archimedes.
