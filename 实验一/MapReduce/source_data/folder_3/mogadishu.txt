It is located in the coastal [[Banadir]] region on the [[Somali Sea]]. The city has been an important [[harbor|port]] for the [[region]] for many [[century|centuries]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2005/termentini_050513.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105003933/http://www.paginedidifesa.it/2005/termentini_050513.html|archivedate=2013-11-05|title=Somalia, una nazione che non esiste|last=Termentini|first=Fernando|date=13 May 2005|access-date=24 December 2018}} < /ref >  Estimates of the city's [[population]] are between 1.5 and 3 million people. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Trade]] between the people in the Mogadishu area with other areas along the [[Somali Sea]] coast of [[East Africa]] started as early as the [[1st century]]. [[Islam|Muslim]] traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] came to the area during the 10th century. Because of trade with them, [[Islam]] spread through Somalia. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] tried to take control of the city, but failed. In 1871 [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], the [[sultan]] of [[Zanzibar]], controlled the city. 
 
 In 1892, [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] let [[Italy]] use the city. Italy bought the city in 1905. They made ''[[Mogadiscio]]'' (Italian for Mogadishu) the capital of [[Italian Somaliland]].  The Italians took control of the area around the city in 1919 after minor [[resistance]].  Italian Mogadiscio  grew from a small village of 1,000 inhabitants in the 1890s to a modern capital in 1940 of nearly 100,000 persons (of whom more than 1/3 were Italians), that was second only to Asmara in Eritrea for development inside the Italian Empire. 
 
 [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military|forces]] that were in [[Kenya]] during [[World War II]] captured Mogadishu on [[February 26]], [[1941]].  The British ruled until they gave Italy control of the city again in 1952. Somalia became [[independence|independent]] in 1960 with Mogadishu as its capital. 
 
 [[Rebellion|Rebel]] forces entered and took the city in 1990. They forced [[President]] Mohamed [[Siad Barre]] to resign and leave the country in January 1991. He went to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].  Some of the rebels said that [[Ali Mahdi Muhammad]] was the new president. Others said that [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]] was president.  A group of [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] landed near Mogadishu on [[December 9]], [[1992]]. They were the first part of the [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] forces during [[Operation Restore Hope]] to go to the country. Mogadishu has had many years of [[civil war]]. This is because the [[government]] of Somalia fell in 1991. This has included many [[suicide bomb]]ings by [[jihadist]] group [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]. In 2017, an al-Shabaab suicide bomber [[14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings|killed over 500 people]]. 
 
 == Economy == 
 Mogadishu is a [[commerce|commercial]] and [[finance|financial]] center for Somalia. The [[economy]] got better after the [[Somali Civil War]] but there are still problems. Because the government does not have control of the whole country, there is less [[tax]]ation or [[regulation|regulatory]] costs. This makes [[business]]es not cost as much as it does in other places. Businesses have hired [[weapon|armed]] militias to have [[wikt:security|security]]. This is reducing [[wikt:violence|violence]] in the city. 
 
 The main [[Industry|industries]] of the city include making [[food]] and [[drink|beverages]] as well as [[textiles]]. The main textile is [[cotton]]. The main [[market]] many different types of goods from food to [[Electronics|electronic]] items. 
 
 Mogadishu has the most port traffic of any port in Somalia. It is still a major seaport. However, there has been a lot of [[piracy]] around Somalia's coastal areas. This makes trade [[risk]]y.
