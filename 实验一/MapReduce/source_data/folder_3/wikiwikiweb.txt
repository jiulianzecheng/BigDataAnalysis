 The '''WikiWikiWeb''' is the first [[wiki]], or user-editable [[website]], like [[Wikipedia]]. It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer [[Ward Cunningham]], to accompany the [[Portland Pattern Repository]] website discussing [[Software design pattern|software design patterns]]. The name ''WikiWikiWeb'' originally also applied to the [[wiki software]] that operated the website, written in the [[Perl]] programming language and later renamed to  " WikiBase " . The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply  " Wiki " , and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized ''W'' referred exclusively to the original site.

 The software and website were developed in 1994 by Cunningham in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers easier. The concept was based on the ideas developed in [[HyperCard]] stacks that Cunningham built in the late 1980s. < ref > [[c2:WikiHistory|WikiHistory]] on c2.com < /ref > < ref > [[n:Interview: Wikinewsie Kim Bruning discusses Wikimania|Interview: Wikinewsie Kim Bruning discusses Wikimania]] on WikiNews < /ref > < ref > [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7739076742312910146 Interview with Ward Cunningham] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507062332/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7739076742312910146 |date=2007-05-07 }} on Google Video < /ref >  On March 25, 1995, he installed the software on his company's (Cunningham  &  Cunningham) website, c2.com. Cunningham came up with the name WikiWikiWeb because he remembered a [[Honolulu International Airport]] counter employee who told him to take the [[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]], a [[Public transport|shuttle bus]] line that runs between the airport's terminals.  " Wiki Wiki "  is a [[reduplication]] of  " wiki " , a [[Hawaiian language]] word for  " quick " . < ref > {{Citation|last=Andrews|first=Lorrin|title=A dictionary of the Hawaiian language to which is appended an English-Hawaiian vocabulary and a chronological table of remarkable events|year=1865|publisher=Henry M. Whitney|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofhawa00andrrich/page/n519|page=514}} < /ref >  Cunningham's idea was to make WikiWikiWeb's pages quickly editable by its users, so he initially thought about calling it  " QuickWeb " , but later changed his mind and dubbed it  " WikiWikiWeb " .
