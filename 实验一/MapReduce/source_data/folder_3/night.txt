 '''Night''' or '''nighttime''' is the [[time]] when the [[Sun]] is not in the sky. Night happens after [[dusk]] and before [[dawn]]. The opposite of night is [[day]]. The start and end times of night are different in different geographic locations. It [[wikt:vary|varies]] on [[season]], [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[timezone]]. 
 
 In other [[time zone]]s, the night occurs at different times. This is because the [[Sun]] shines on different parts of the [[Earth]] at different [[time]]s. During a [[solar eclipse]] it is also partially night because the [[Sun]] is blocked out by the [[Moon]]. 
 
 In popular culture, night is often thought of as a [[symbol]] of evil, because of the fear of the dark, lack of being able to see what's around and criminals like doing crimes at night.
