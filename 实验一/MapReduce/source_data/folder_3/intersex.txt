'''Intersex''' variations occur (though rarely) in [[species]] which use [[sexual reproduction]]. Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that lie between those of typical males and typical females. < ref name= " unfe-2016 " > {{cite web| title = United Nations for Intersex Awareness | url = https://www.unfe.org/intersex-awareness/ | last = Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | accessdate = 2016-11-12}} < /ref > < ref name= " unfe-fact " > {{Cite web| author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  | publisher = [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free  &  Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex| date = 2015| url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | accessdate = 28 March 2016 }} < /ref >  [[Hermaphrodite]] is a term that gets confused with intersexual, and while all hermaphrodites are intersexual, not all intersexual people are hermaphrodites. < ref name=ISNAwhat > {{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex |title=What is intersex? |author= |website= |publisher=ISNA |accessdate=27 June 2015}} < /ref >  The clinical term 'disorders of sex development' (DSD) is very controversial. < ref name=GDavis > {{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Georgiann|title=Contesting Intersex: The Dubious Diagnosis|url=https://archive.org/details/contestinginters0000davi|date=11 September 2015|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-1479887040|pages=[https://archive.org/details/contestinginters0000davi/page/87 87]–89}} < /ref > < ref name= " holmes2011 " > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0026 | issn = 2044-0138 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 388–411 | last = Holmes | first = Morgan | title = The Intersex Enchiridion: Naming and Knowledge | journal = Somatechnics | accessdate = 22 October 2014 | date = September 2011 | url = http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/soma.2011.0026 }} < /ref > < ref name= " SenateOnSterilisation "  / > 
 
 An intersex individual's [[genitalia]] may be atypical in some way. It can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is [[Genetics|genetically]] male or female (with XY chromosomes or XX chromosomes). They may also have male and/or female [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (such as body shape). However, there is a wide range of variation in sexual anatomy. < ref name=ISNAwhat/ >  There are many more subtle forms of sex anatomy, or sex chromosome differences. < ref name= " ISNA frequency " / >  These don't even show physically. Some won't show up until later in life. < ref name= " ISNA frequency " / >  Sometimes, the variation may appear when the baby reaches [[puberty]] or becomes an [[adult]]. It may not even be detected in an individual's lifetime, < ref name= " ISNAwhat "  / >  but as technology gets more advanced, that chance dims down. 
 
 == Population figures == 
 Up to 1.7% of people may be born with an intersex variation. < ref name= " unfe-fact "  / >  A child born with genitalia atypical enough to call in an expert occurs in about 1 of 1,500 births. < ref name= " ISNA frequency " > {{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency |title=How common is intersex?  & #124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=2009-08-21}} < /ref >  More information on the frequency of different causes is available. < ref > {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2 < 151::AID-AJHB1 > 3.0.CO;2-F| issn = 1520-6300| volume = 12| issue = 2| pages = 151–166| last1 = Blackless| first1 = Melanie| last2 = Charuvastra| first2 = Anthony| last3 = Derryck| first3 = Amanda| last4 = Fausto-Sterling| first4 = Anne| last5 = Lauzanne| first5 = Karl| last6 = Lee| first6 = Ellen| title = How sexually dimorphic are we?

 == Causes == 
 Most causes of intersex are [[congenital]], or born with it, usually because of a [[Genetics|genetic]] condition. All development is governed by genes which regulate the process of growth. < ref name= " Kolodny " > {{Cite book| last1 =  Kolodny| first1 =  Robert C.| author-link = | last2 =  Masters| first2 =  William H.| last3 =  Johnson| first3 =  Virginia E.|author3-link = Virginia E.

 The most common intersex variation is a [[hormone]] condition. This causes genetically female [[fetus]]es to have a more masculine body appearance, because the babies' [[adrenal gland]] produces higher levels of [[androgen]] hormones (hormones that act like [[testosterone]]). This may cause the female baby to appear male even to doctors and parents. 
 
 == Genetic Abnormalities == 
 Some intersex people may be so because of abnormalities with their sex chromosomes, resulting in genetic disorders. One disorder known as [[Turner's Syndrome]], is when instead of having an XX (female) or XY (male) [[genotype]], a person has X0. A person with Turner's Syndrome usually looks like a girl, but they are shorter in height and do not go through [[puberty]], meaning they cannot [[Reproduction|reproduce]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/turner-syndrome|title=Turner syndrome|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}} < /ref > 
 
 Another genetic disorder is [[Klinefelter syndrome|Klinefelter Syndrome]], where a person has an XXY genotype. This disorder affects men, causing infertility, smaller genitalia, and less facial hair. Men with this disorder can have a variety of symptoms which can be so unnoticeable that they may never be diagnosed. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klinefelter-syndrome|title=Klinefelter syndrome|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}} < /ref > 
 
 == Medical interventions == 
 [[Surgery]] may be used on intersex babies to give a more usual cosmetic appearance. This is sometimes thought to make children more normal, but this idea lacks evidence < ref name= " 2016dsd "  / >  and is contested. < ref name= " SenateOnSterilisation " > {{Cite book| work = [[Australian Senate]] | isbn = 978-1-74229-917-4 | last1 = Senate of Australia | last2 = Community Affairs References Committee| title = Involuntary or coerced sterilisation of intersex people in Australia| location = Canberra| date = 2013| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Community_Affairs/Involuntary_Sterilisation/Sec_Report/index}} < /ref > < ref name= " swissnek " > {{Cite book| last = Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics NEK-CNE| title = On the management of differences of sex development.

 == Activism == 
 As intersexuality becomes more recognized all over the world, there are many [[Activism|activist]] groups created to promote recognizing and supporting members of this community. One major activist group known as the Intersex Society of North America, or INSA, teaches people what intersexuality is and the harms of children having gender assignment surgery without their permission to consent. < ref > {{Citation|title=Intersex: redefining sex.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/48584948|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|date=2001|accessdate=2019-12-04|oclc=48584948|last=Intersex Society of North America. CityTV (Firm)}} < /ref > 
 
 One of the major issues intersex people face is other people who are not intersex making them feel uncomfortable about their sex and [[gender]]. Intersex people may not feel the need to identify themselves at all in their lifetimes, preferring to maintain ambiguity. However, those who are not a part of this community feel as though people need to chose and be more clear about their genitalia. This invasion of privacy is often protested against and discussed by activist groups who believe intersex people are allowed to be private and deserve to be treated the same as those who are not intersex. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
