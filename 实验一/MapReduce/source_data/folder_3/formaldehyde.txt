 '''Formaldehyde''' (or '''Methanal''') is a [[chemical compound]]. 
 
 It is a colorless [[gas]] with a strong [[smell]]. Like other [[aldehyde]]s, it is flammable and toxic. < ref name= " IARC " > {{citation | contribution = Formaldehyde | url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol88/mono88-6.pdf | pages = 39–325 | title = Formaldehyde, 2-Butoxyethanol and 1-''tert''-Butoxypropan-2-ol | series = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans 88 | publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer | location = Lyon, France | year = 2006 | isbn = 92-832-1288-6}}. < /ref > 
   
 It is the simplest [[aldehyde]]. Its main application is as a [[disinfectant]]. It is a [[biocide]], this means it can kill most [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. It is also used to make [[dye]]s, to make [[textile]]s, wrinkle-free [[preservative]]s, [[explosive]]s, and certain [[polymer]]s. About 23 million tonnes (50 billion pounds) of formaldehyde was made worldwide in 2005. < ref name=Ullmann > Günther Reuss, Walter Disteldorf, Armin Otto Gamer, Albrecht Hilt “Formaldehyde” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a11_619}} < /ref >  On May 21, 2002, a worker in a explosive making factory dropped a lighter and the flame immediately spread to the  < span > formaldehyde, which in turn caused to fire to blaze abnormally. This caused 17 known deaths and 39 known injuries. These days, the chemical is used less frequently. < /span >
