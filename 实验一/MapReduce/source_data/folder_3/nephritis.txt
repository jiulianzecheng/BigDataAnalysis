'''Nephritis''' is [[inflammation]] of the [[kidneys]]. It may involve the [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomeruli]], [[Mesonephric tubule|tubules]], or [[Interstitium|interstitial tissue]] surrounding the glomeruli and tubules. < ref > Keto Acids â€“ Advances in Research and Application 2013 Edition p.220e < /ref > 
 
 Nephritis is often caused by infections, and toxins, but is most commonly caused  by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs like kidneys. < ref > {{cite web|title=Acute Nephritis; Nephrosis; Nephritic syndrome information.

 Nephritis can produce glomerular injury, by disturbing the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation. < ref > {{Cite web|title = Glomerular Diseases|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/glomerular-diseases/Pages/facts.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|access-date = 2015-06-15|archive-date = 2015-06-12|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150612050215/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/kidney-disease/glomerular-diseases/Pages/facts.aspx|url-status = dead}} < /ref >  This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output ([[oliguria]]) < ref > {{cite web|title=Oliguria: Background, Etiology, Epidemiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/983156-overview|website=Medscape|publisher=eMedicine|access-date=23 July 2016}} < /ref >  and retention of waste products ([[uremia]]). < ref > {{Cite web|title = uremia {{!}} accumulation in the blood of constituents normally eliminated in the urine that produces a severe toxic condition and usually occurs in severe kidney disease|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/uremia|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2015-06-14}} < /ref >  As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine ([[hematuria]]). < ref > {{Cite web|title = Hematuria (Blood in the Urine)|url = http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/hematuria-blood-in-the-urine/Pages/facts.aspx|website = www.niddk.nih.gov|access-date = 2015-06-14|archive-date = 2016-06-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624143739/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/hematuria-blood-in-the-urine/Pages/facts.aspx|url-status = dead}} < /ref >
