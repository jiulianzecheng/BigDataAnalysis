 '''Cuttlebone''' is a hard [[wikt:brittle|brittle]] [[structure]] found inside [[cuttlefish]]. Like seashells, the cuttlebone is made of [[calcium carbonate]]. The cuttlebone is special as it is covered with tiny holes that the cuttlefish can fill with water or air. This allows the cuttlefish to control its ability to float or sink in water. In the past, cuttlebones were used to make polishing powder. This power was then added to [[toothpaste]] to make it look white. Today, cuttlebone is mainly used for [[cage]]d [[bird]]s and [[turtle]]s in their habitats, so they get their [[calcium]] easily and fast.
