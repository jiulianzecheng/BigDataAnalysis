 '''Polyphyly''' is a term in [[cladistics]]. < ref > [[Greek language|Greek]] for  " many races " < /ref >  It describes a group of organisms whose last common ancestor is not a member of the group. Another way of expressing this is to say that polyphyly includes groups some members of which are descended from ancestral populations. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006.

 The diagrams show that birds and mammals are indeed related, but only at the level of the early [[amniote]]s. In terms of [[evolution]], there is a vast gulf between them. 
 
 More common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants (say, living mammals) without the group they evolved from (which would be some clade in the [[therapsid]]a). This is done for convenience; but it makes the mammals polyphyletic. 
 
 [[Biological classification]] aims to group [[species]] together such that every group is descended from a single common ancestor. A polyphyletic group can be  " fixed "  either by excluding [[clade]]s or by adding the common ancestor. 
 
 According to [[cladistics]] it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are [[monophyletic]]. However, other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are [[paraphyletic]]. These would contain their most recent common ancestor but not all the descendants of that ancestor.
