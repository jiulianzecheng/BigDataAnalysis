 The '''ciliates''' are a group of [[protist]]s which have hair-like organelles called [[cilia]]. 
 
 Ciliates are identical in structure to [[flagella]], but typically shorter and in much larger numbers. They have a different pattern of waving than do flagella.  
 
 Cilia occur in all members of the group (although the peculiar suctoria have them only for part of the life-cycle). They are used for swimming, crawling, attachment, feeding, and sensation.
