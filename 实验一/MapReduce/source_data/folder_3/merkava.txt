 The '''Merkava''' is a [[main battle tank]]. It is developed and produced in [[Israel]] for the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. The tank was first introduced in 1978 and first used in combat during the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. Four main versions have been developed. These are called Merkava Mark I â€“ Mark IV. 
 
 When designing the Merkava tank, everything was subordinated to the survival aspect of the crew, the engine is placed in front of the tank and thus serves as an additional component of ballistic protection, while the crew can escape from the damaged Merkava door at the rear of the tank. The thick armor and high mobility make it one of the best protected tanks in the world. The design team that developed the first version of this tank, led by commander of the Israeli armored corps, [[Israel Tal]].
