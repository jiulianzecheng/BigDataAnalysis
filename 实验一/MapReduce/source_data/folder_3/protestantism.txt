 '''Protestantism''' is a form of [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and practice. It began in northern [[Europe]] in the early 16th century. < ref name=brit > {{Cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/479892/Protestantism |title=Protestantism (Christianity) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=britannica.com |accessdate=9 July 2010}} < /ref >  At that time, they were against some parts of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Together with [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and Roman Catholicism, Protestantism became one of the three greatest forces in Christianity. Protestantism much influenced the culture, beliefs, and [[economy]] of the place in which it became important. < ref name=brit/ > 
 
 The word ''Protestantism'' had its origin when [[Germany|German]] [[prince]]s and free [[city|cities]] at the Diet of Speyer (1529), petitioned or  " protested "  against the imperial ban adopted by the Diet against Martin Luther and its stance against the [[Reformation]]. < ref name=etymology/ > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/926093229|title=Here I stand : a life of Martin Luther|last=Bainton, Roland H.

 [[Martin Luther]], a doctor of [[theology]] and a [[monk]], said that the church should return to its roots, and give more weight to what is written in the [[Bible]] ([[Sola scriptura]]). Luther thought that the Church had gone too far away from the original teachings. He published [[95 theses]] on the way the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Church was at that time. Some say, he stuck them onto the door of the church of [[Wittenberg]], but others say this is not true. The 95 theses were published in [[1516]] or [[1517]]. With the theses, he started the Protestant [[Reformation]]. 
 
 Protestant churches with a big following are: 
 * [[Lutheran Church]] 
 * [[Calvinism|Calvinist Church]] 
 * [[Baptist]]s 
 * [[Pentecostal]]s 
 Often but not always: 
 * [[Anglican Church]]: [[Henry VIII]] split from the Roman Catholic Church. He wanted to divorce from [[Catherine of Aragon]], but the [[Pope]] refused to divorce him. King Henry started the Church of England. It is sometimes seen as being the middle way, between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, and that is why is often excluded from Protestantism. This is because, in the English Reformation, the English Church kept the early Catholic ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons, as well as most of the [[doctrine]] and [[liturgy]]. The critical point which led to the Anglican Church was the outright [[Universal priesthood (doctrine)|rejection of the Pope]], and so of the Roman Catholic Church as an organisation.
