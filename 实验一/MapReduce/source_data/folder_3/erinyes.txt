 The '''Erinyes''' (or '''Eumenides''') were the [[goddess]]es of [[revenge]] in [[Greek mythology]]. They are also known as the '''Furies'''. These three female divinities were named '''Alecto''', '''Tisiphone''', and '''Megaera'''. 
 
 ==Description== 
 The Erinyes were born from Mother Earth and the blood of [[Uranos]]. They avenged family crimes such as [[matricide]] and [[patricide]]. They also tormented [[evil]] men in the  " [[Hell]] "  of the underworld, [[Greek underworld|Tartarus]]. 
 
 The Erinyes forever followed a person who did a [[crime]]. They even could make the person go [[insanity|mad]]. They are often shown with [[snake]]s on their heads, [[blood]] coming out of their eyes, and looking horrific. 
 
 ==In stories== 
 A well known story about the Erinyes is that of [[Orestes]]. Orestes' mother [[Klytaimnestra]], and her lover [[Aegisthos]], killed Orestes' father [[Agamemnon]]. The god [[Apollo]] told Orestes to kill the [[murderer]]s of his father, which he did. Orestes was then pursued by the Erinyes for his crime. With the help of [[Athena]] and [[Apollo]] Orestes went to a [[court]] in [[Athens]]. It was decided that Orestes acted correctly and nobody should hurt him. Even the Erinyes accepted the decision, and from then on they were also called '''Eumenides''', which means  " the kind ones " , because they could also let people go in peace if their crime was done for a good reason.
