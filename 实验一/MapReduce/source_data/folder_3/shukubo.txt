 == History == 
 At first, only Buddhist monks called Bhikkhu were permitted to stay at these accommodations. However, during the [[Heian period]], more individuals began to embark on pilgrimages to temples and shrines. As a result, even people like the nobility, samurai, and common pilgrims began to stay in these facilities. As a result, the operators of these facilities were no longer only monks. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=8 Recommended Shukubo (Temple Lodging) Spots Throughout Japan|url=https://www.tsunagujapan.com/8-recommended-shukubo-temple-lodging-spots-throughout-japan/|access-date=2022-09-21|website=tsunagu Japan}} < /ref > 
 
 Shukubo were historically used by [[Shugendo]] practitioners and those who [[Mountain worship|worshipped mountains]]. They played significant roles in the development of both practices. < ref >                         Kaminishi, I. (2006). Deciphering Mountain Worship. In ''Explaining Pictures: Buddhist Propaganda and Etoki Storytelling in Japan'' (pp. 165–192). University of Hawai’i Press.  < nowiki > http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvvmxpt.12 < /nowiki > < /ref > 
 
 In a construction boom that lasted for several decades in the [[Edo period]], networks of Shukubo started to develop in Ise, Shima, Toba, and Futami-ura. < ref >     Andreeva, A. (2017).

Harvard University Asia Center.  < nowiki > https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv47w8vp.12 < /nowiki > < /ref > 
 
 Many of the present-day operators of Shukubo are descendants of families who used to run them when they were solely for religious purposes. These Shukubo were originally intended for only one Kosha, but opening up to the general public has significantly increased the number of people staying at these facilities. < ref >                        Carter, C. (2018). Power Spots and the Charged Landscape of Shinto. ''Japanese Journal of Religious Studies'', ''45''(1), 145–174.  < nowiki > https://www.jstor.org/stable/26854474 < /nowiki > < /ref > 
 
 At the base of [[Mount Haguro]], there were once 336 Shukubo, all of which were connected to Shugendo. < ref >  Earhart, H. B. (1965). Four Ritual Periods of Haguro Shugendō in Northeastern Japan. ''History of Religions'', ''5''(1), 93–113.  < nowiki > http://www.jstor.org/stable/1061805 < /nowiki > < /ref > 
 
 During the Edo period, visits to temples and shrines became popular Destinations included those Ise, {{Ill|Kotohira-gū|en}}, and {{Ill|Zenkō-ji|en}}. As a result, lodging houses were constructed at major temples and shrines in each area to accommodate ordinary pilgrims and tourists. This formed an early tourism industry. Specific areas were linked to specific lodging houses. 
 
 In modern times, some Shukubo have been transformed into traditional inns and ryokans for tourists who wish to experience the ambiance of a temple stay. < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite web|last=デジタル大辞泉,世界大百科事典内言及|title=宿坊(シュクボウ)とは？ 意味や使い方|url=https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%AE%BF%E5%9D%8A-528310|access-date=2023-01-19|website=コトバンク|language=ja}} < /ref >
