 '''Bleeding''', technically known as '''haemorrhaging''' (Brit.) or '''hemorrhaging''' (US) is the loss of [[blood]] or blood escape from the [[circulatory system]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/bleeding|title=Bleeding Health Article|publisher=Healthline|access-date=2007-06-18|archive-date=2011-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210143239/http://www.healthline.com/adamcontent/bleeding|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   
 
 Bleeding can occur internally, where blood leaks from [[blood vessel]]s inside the body, or externally, either through a natural opening such as the [[vagina]], [[mouth]], [[nose]], [[ear]] or [[anus]], or through a break in the [[human skin|skin]]. 
 
 '''Desanguination''' is a major blood loss.  [[Exsanguination]] is losing enough blood to cause death. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/exsanguination|title=Dictionary Definitions of Exsanguination|publisher=Reference.com|access-date=2007-06-18}} < /ref >   A person does not have to lose all of their blood to die.  People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood. < ref name=tb > {{cite book |last1=Mistovich |first1=Joseph J. | last2=Karren |first2=Keith J. |last3=Hafen |first3=Brent |date=July 18, 2013 |title=Prehospital Emergency Care |edition=10th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0133369137}} < /ref > 
 
 Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10–15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties, and [[blood donation]] typically takes 8–10% of the donor's blood volume. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html|title=Blood Donation Information|publisher=UK National Blood Service|access-date=2007-06-18 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035216/http://www.blood.co.uk/pages/b36faint.html  < !-- Bot retrieved archive -- >  |archive-date = 2007-09-28}} < /ref > 
 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) established a scale to measure different degrees of blood loss, from level 0 to 4. Level 0 indicates no blood loss, whilst level 4 represents the highest level of hemorrhaging, with a risk of fatality.
