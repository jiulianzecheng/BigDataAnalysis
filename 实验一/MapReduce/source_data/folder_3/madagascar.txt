 '''Madagascar''' is a large island nation in the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is off of the East coast of [[Africa]] and its capital is [[Antananarivo]]. Twenty-two million people live there. It is the world's fourth largest island. < ref > {{Cite web

 The official languages of Madagascar are [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]]. 
 
 == Pre-human history == 
 About two hundred million years ago, Madagascar was a part of a huge [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangaea]]. When this broke up, Madagascar was attached to what is now the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Madagascar broke away from India and moved closer to Africa. < ref > {{Cite news

 }} < /ref >   
 
 The long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Many of its animals came from [[Africa]], because the island is closer to Africa than to India. Many of these endemic Malagasy animals have died out since the arrival of humans, particularly the [[megafauna]]. 
 
 Despite this, and massive deforestation, Madagascar is still home to an incredible array of wildlife. Most of the wildlife is unique. < ref > {{cite book |author1=Benstead, Jonathan P. |author2=Goodman, Steven D. |title=The natural history of Madagascar |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2003 |isbn=0-226-30306-3 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Environment == 
 Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there. They do not exist elsewhere in Africa. They only exist in Madagascar. In fact, most of the [[mammal]]s living in Madagascar do not live anywhere else in the world. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5920772.ece 
  |title=Dark history of Madagascar - Times Online |work=timesonline.co.uk 
  |accessdate=May 6, 2010}} < /ref >   
 
 Many [[species]] in Madagascar are in danger because much of the forest has been cut down. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/MADAGAS.HTM |title=Deforestation In Madagascar |work=www1.american.edu |accessdate=May 6, 2010 |archive-date=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606112136/http://www1.american.edu/TED/madagas.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Forests are cut down so the land can grow crops such as [[coffee]], which is an important export crop for Madagascar. 
 
 == Economy == 
 [[Agriculture]] is a big part of the [[economy]] in Madagascar, including the growing of coffee and [[vanilla]]. Madagascar sells more vanilla than any other country in the world. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LO644563.htm |last=Saholiarisoa |first=Sanja |title=Reuters AlertNet - Cyclones, politics to hurt Madagascar vanilla |work=alertnet.org |accessdate=May 6, 2010 |archive-date=June 20, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620021518/http://alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LO644563.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Madagascar also makes money from [[tourism]]. < ref > {{Cite web

 == Provinces == 
 [[File:Madagascar-regions.png|thumb|left|Map of the Regions of Madagascar and former provinces of Madagascar]] 
 In 2004 Madagascar was divided into 22 regions.  It used to be divided into 6 [[province]]s. < ref > Deschamps (1965), pp. 268, 274. < /ref > 
 
 == Human history == 
 People have probably lived in Madagascar for at least 2000 years. < ref > {{Cite web

 [[France]] took over the city of Antananarivo in 1895, and added Madagascar as a colony two years later. < ref > {{Cite web  |url= http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/history  |title= History of Madagascar - Lonely Planet Travel Information  |work= lonelyplanet.com  |accessdate= May 6, 2010  |archive-date= September 23, 2015  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150923183412/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/madagascar/history  |url-status= dead  }} < /ref >  Madagascar became independent on 26 June, 1960.
