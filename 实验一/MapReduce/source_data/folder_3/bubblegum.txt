 '''Bubble gum''' is a popular type of [[candy]] that is not eaten, but instead chewed. Before being chewed bubble gum is hard. When it is chewed it is soft.

Bazooka was the second made bubble gum. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/bubblegum.htm|title=Bubble Gum History - Invention of Bubble Gum|website=www.ideafinder.com|access-date=2010-04-15|archive-date=2018-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128143753/http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/bubblegum.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   Thomas Adams made a kind of bubble gum called Black Jack. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/chewgum.htm|title=Chewing Gum History - Invention of Chewing Gum|website=www.ideafinder.com|access-date=2010-04-15|archive-date=2018-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003071307/http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/chewgum.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
