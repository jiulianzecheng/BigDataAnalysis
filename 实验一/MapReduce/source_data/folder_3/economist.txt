 According to [[Frédéric Bastiat]]: 
 : " There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen. " < ref > Bastiat, Frédéric. (1850). [http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html   " That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen " ], cited in Mark Skousen. (2009).
