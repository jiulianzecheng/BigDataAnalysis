A '''baritone''' is a man with a voice range between that of a [[tenor]] (high male voice) and [[bass (singer)|bass]] (low male voice), typically ranging from the second F below [[middle C]] to the F above middle C. It is the most common male voice type. 
 
 Famous baritone roles in [[opera]] include: Papageno in [[Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and Figaro in [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. 
 
 [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]] is often thought of as the greatest baritone of the later [[20th century]]. He was famous as a [[Lied]]er [[singer]] as well as on the [[concert]] stage and in opera. 
 
 Some [[musical instruments]] are also called  " baritone "  because they create similar frequencies to a baritone singer.
