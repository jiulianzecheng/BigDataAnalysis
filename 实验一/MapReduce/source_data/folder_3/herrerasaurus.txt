 '''''Herrerasaurus''''' was one of the earliest [[dinosaur]]s.

 == Description == 
 ''Herrerasaurus'' was a lightly built [[bipedal]] carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Its length is estimated at 3 to 6 & nbsp;meters (10 to 20 & nbsp;ft), < ref name =Sereno1992 > Sereno P.C. and Novas F.E. 1992. The complete skull and skeleton of an early dinosaur.
