 Nebettawy may have been the daughter of [[Ramesses II|Ramesses's]] wife, [[Nefertari]]. She would also later marry her father and became his great royal wife (possibly after death of [[Meritamen]]).  < ref > Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames  &  Hudson. 2006 < /ref > 
 
 Nebettawy appears as the fifth princess in procession of royal daughters as depicted in the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]]. She appears after Bintanath, Bakmut, Nefertari, and Meritamen. The princesses are shown shaking a sistrum. < ref > Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt.

 Nebettawy is not shown on the smaller temple of Abu Simbel. [[Nefertari]] is shown with [[Meritamen]] and Henuttawy on the facade of this temple. < ref >  Kitchen, K.A., Ramesside Inscriptions, Translated  &  Annotated, Translations, Volume II, Blackwell Publishers, 1996 < /ref >  Nebettawy was later buried in QV60, the tomb was robbed during the antiquity period. It was later changed into a [[Christian]] chapel.
