The '''Troglodytae''' ({{lang-el|{{Polytonic|Τρωγλοδῦται}}}}) or '''Troglodyti''' (meaning  " cave goers " ), used to be a group of people talked about by many old [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians and map makers.  The early references call them '''Trogodytes''', which looks like it was changed from the Greek ''trōglē'' meaning  " [[cave]] " . They were either placed in the desert along the [[Africa]]n side of the [[Red Sea]] coast or North of [[Greece]] in what they called Getae. < ref > {{cite book |title= The Cambridge Ancient History |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGBGauNBK8kC & dq=Troglodytae & pg=RA3-PA598 |format=Google Books |accessdate=2009-10-09|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge,UK|isbn=0521227178|pages=598}} < /ref >
