 '''Kingfishers''' are small birds of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Coraciiformes]]. There are about 90 [[species]], mostly in the [[Old World]] and [[Australasia]], Most species are tropical in distribution. 
 
 Their feathers are often bright colours, such as [[blue]] or [[Orange (color)|orange]]. They have large heads, long, sharp [[Beak|bills]], short legs, and stubby tails. 
 
 Most species have bright plumage with little differences between the sexes. Most are found only in [[forests]]. They eat a wide range of prey, including fish. They usually catch prey by swooping down from a perch. Many live near rivers and eat fish, but most species live away from water and eat small [[invertebrates]]. Like other birds  of their order they nest in holes, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in disused [[termite]] nests.

Christopher Helm. {{ISBN|0-7136-8028-8}} < /ref >  the 90 or so species of kingfishers are now divided into three families: 
 *River kingfishers (Alcedinidae) 
 *Tree kingfishers (Halcyonidae ) 
 *Water kingfishers (Cerylidae) 
 
 == Habitat == 
 Kingfishers are found all over the world. They often make their [[nest]]s near [[river]]s where the water flows slowly. They make their nests in tall river banks. They dig a hole in the side of the river bank. Most kingfishers lay 3–6 [[egg (biology)|egg]]s each time. 
 
 Many kingfishers eat [[fish]]. They sit on branches hanging over the river's edge and wait for a fish to appear. They then dive into the water to catch the fish. Some kingfishers eat [[lizard]]s or other [[reptile]]s. [[Kookaburra]]s do this. 
 
 == History == 
 Most species are in the Australasian region, but the family did not originate there. They [[evolved]] in the Northern Hemisphere and invaded the Australasian region a number of times. < ref name =  " Moyle " > {{cite journal| last=Moyle |first= Robert G|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of Kingfishers (Alcedinidae) with insights into early biogeographic history|journal=Auk|volume=123|issue=2|pages=487–499 | doi = 10.1642/0004-8038(2006)123[487:AMPOKA]2.0.CO;2|s2cid= 84824051}} < /ref >  [[Fossil]] kingfishers have been described from Lower [[Eocene]] rocks in [[Wyoming]] 50 million years ago (mya) and in [[Germany]], around 30-40 million years ago.

 == Conservation == 
 Kingfishers are easily harmed if there is a lot of snow and cold weather in [[winter]]. They can also die if humans cause a lot of water [[pollution]] or if the places where Kingfishers live are destroyed. Some kingfishers are [[endangered species]].
