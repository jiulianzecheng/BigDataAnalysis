Toothpicks are also used for [[wikt:celebration|celebrations]] to hold or stick small [[appetizers]] (like [[cheese]] cubes or [[olives]]).  
 
 Toothpicks sometimes have [[plastic frills]] or look like small paper [[Umbrella|umbrellas]] or [[Flag|flags]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The toothpick is the oldest [[tool]] for cleaning [[teeth]]. The [[Skull|skulls]] of [[Neanderthal|Neanderthals]] and [[Homo sapiens]], show clear signs of teeth picked with a tool. Toothpicks that are made of [[bronze]] have been found in prehistoric graves in Northern [[Italy]] and in the East Alps. 
 
 == Materials used to make toothpicks == 
 There are artistic toothpicks made of [[silver]] in [[antiquity]], as well as from [[mastic wood]]. 
 
 
 In the 17th century, toothpicks were luxury objects. They were made using precious metal and set with expensive stones. 
 
 The first toothpick-manufacturing machine was developed by Marc Signorello in 1869. Another was patented in 1872, by Silas Noble and J. P. Cooley. < ref > {{Cite web|last=inventions|first=Mary Bellis Inventions Expert Mary Bellis covered|last2=films|first2=inventors for ThoughtCo for 18 years She is known for her independent|last3=documentaries|last4=Alex|first4=including one about|last5=Bellis|first5=er Graham Bell our editorial process Mary|title=A Comprehensive History of the Dental Profession and Dental Care|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-dentistry-and-dental-care-1991569|access-date=2020-11-28|website=ThoughtCo|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Wooden toothpicks are cut from [[birch]] wood. Logs are first cut into thin sheets, which are then cut, chopped, milled and bleached into each toothpicks. Plastic toothpicks, also called dental pics, are still made in America in Georgia, by Armond's Manufacturing. Nowadays other ways of keeping include using [[dental floss]], [[Toothbrush|toothbrushes]], and [[Oral irrigator|oral irrigators]].
