 ==Broadcast== 
 In the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] aired the original version of ''Pingu'' on the [[BBC Children's and Education|Children's BBC]] slot on [[BBC One]] from 1990 onwards. In 2002, when the BBC created the [[CBBC]] channel, it was moved to its preschool channel [[CBeebies]]. They used the original cartoon title card for series 1-2, and the first 13 episodes of series 3 used the claymation-inspired intro. [[JimJam]] contains all of the show's 156 episodes and ''[[Pingu at the Wedding Party]]'', but it contains the re-dubbed versions of series 1-2, and contains the original version of the special, without the titles and credits.
