 ==History== 
 ===Origins=== 
 The city has [[Roman Britain|Roman]], [[Saxon]] and [[Viking]] origins. 
 
 The Roman camp of 'Derventio' was probably near to Derby. The site of the old Roman fort is at Chester Green. Later the town was one of the 'Five Boroughs' of the Danelaw. 
 
 The town name is seen as 'Darby' or 'Darbye' on early modern maps, such as that of Speed (1610). 
 
 Modern research into the history and archaeology of Derby has shown that the Vikings and [[Anglo-Saxons]] probably co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 900) says that  " Derby is divided by water " . These areas of land were known as Norþworþig and Deoraby, and were at the  " Irongate "  (north) side of Derby. < ref > ''The Rivers of Time'' Ron McKeown, {{ISBN|978-0-9530603-7-5}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Modern History=== 
 In [[World War I]], Derby was targeted by [[Germany|German]] [[Zeppelin]] air bombers. They killed five people in a 1916 raid on the town. 
 
 All Saints Church was designated as a [[cathedral]] in 1927. That showed that the town was ready for city status. 
 
 In the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], slums were cleared out and people were moved to new [[Council housing|council estates]] in the suburbs. There were also houses for sale there. Rehousing, council house building and private housing developments continued on a large scale for some 30 years after the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/derby.html|title=A History of Derby|website=www.localhistories.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Derby became a high profile town internationally in sport following the appointment of [[Brian Clough]] as manager of [[Derby County F.C.]] in 1967. Promotion to the Football League First Division was achieved in 1969, and County won of the English league three years later. Following the Clough's resignation in 1973, his successor guided County to another league title in 1975, but this is the club's last major trophy to date; relegation followed in 1980 and top flight status was not regained until 1987, since when Derby have spent a total of 10 seasons (across two spells) in the top flight. The club moved from its century-old [[Baseball Ground]] in 1997 to the new [[Pride Park Stadium]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10270~2048716,00.html |title=Derby County  & #124; Club  & #124; History  & #124; History  & #124; The History Of Derby County Football Club |access-date=2011-06-09 |archive-date=2011-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228191905/http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10270~2048716%2C00.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Derby was awarded city status on 7 June 1977 by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. < ref > {{London Gazette|issue=47246|page=7656|date=14 June 1977}} < /ref >  Until then, Derby had been one of the few towns in England with a [[cathedral]] but not city status. 
 
 Despite its strategic industries (rail and [[aero-engine]]), Derby suffered comparatively little damage in both [[world war]]s (contrast [[Bristol]] and [[Filton]]). This may in part have been due to the jamming of the German radio-beam navigations systems (X-Verfahren and [[Knickebein]]), camouflage and decoy techniques ('[[Starfish site]]s') were built, mainly south of the town, e.g. out in fields near [[Foremark]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/WWII:_How_film_sets_saved_Derby_at_war |title=Stories |publisher=Youandyesterday.co.uk |date=1942-07-27 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |archive-date=2008-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807130307/http://www.youandyesterday.co.uk/articles/WWII:_HOW_FILM_SETS_SAVED_DERBY_AT_WAR |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 === Recreation === 
 Derby has the first public park in the country to have an [[arboretum]], which is south of the city centre. The arboretum was set up by the [[philanthropic]] [[landowner]] and [[industrialist]] Joseph Strutt in 1840. The arboretum's website states that the arboretum's design was the inspiration for the vision of great urban parks in the [[United States of America|USA]], notably [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.derbyarboretum.co.uk/about_the_arboretum.htm |title=Arboretum history |publisher=Christopher Harris |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-09-19 |archive-date=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810135033/http://derbyarboretum.co.uk/about_the_arboretum.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 There are four museums: [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]; [[Pickford's House Museum]]; [[Derby Industrial Museum|The Silk Mill]] and The Royal Crown Derby Museum.
