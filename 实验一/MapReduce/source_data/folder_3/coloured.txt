 In [[South Africa]]n, [[Namibia]]n, [[Zambia]]n, [[Botswana]]n, and [[Zimbabwe]]an context, the term '''Coloured''' ('''''Kleurlinge''''' in [[Afrikaans]]) is used to refer to people of mixed [[Europe]]an and [[Khoisan]] or [[Bantu people|Bantu]] ancestry. 
 
 They form the majority of the [[Northern Cape]] and [[Western Cape]] populations. Most Coloured speak Afrikaans as their first language, although there are some native [[English language|English]] speakers. The majority of Coloureds living in [[Cape Town]] are able to speak both languages. 
 
 Because of South Africa's history of racial discrimination, many feel that the term ''coloured'' is derogatory. The official term is  " Coloured people " , but many Coloureds prefer to call themselves  " Black " ,  " Khoisan " , or just  " South African " . 
 
 ==Apartheid== 
 During [[apartheid]], people were classified into four groups: White, Black, Coloured, and Asian. The Cape Malays, who are of Asian descent, were not classified as Asians, but as Coloureds. 
 
 Although they were discriminated upon by the government, many Coloureds and Asians got to enjoy certain rights during the apartheid era. For example, they did not have to carry around a passbook, had limited political representation, and were considered citizens of South Africa.
