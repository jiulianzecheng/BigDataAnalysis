 The '''Theromopylae''' was a small passage between the [[Kallidromo]] and the [[Malian Gulf]] which was very important in [[Antiquity]]: it was the only passage from the gulf to [[Central Greece]]. Today, there are sable deposits and the passage is a lot wider. The namThermopylae points to the fact that at the location there are [[Hot spring|hot springs]], with very [[Sulfur|sulfuric]] water.  
 
 [[Herodotus]] writes, that the passage was very narrow, and that at its narrowest point it was only about {{Convert|15|m}} wide, which would allow one [[carriage]] to pass. During Ancient Greek history, many battles were fought at the location. The most famous is probably the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], which was fought in 480 BC.
