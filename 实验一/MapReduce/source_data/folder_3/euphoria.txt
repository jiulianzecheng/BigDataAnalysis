'''Euphoria''' (from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|εὐφορία}}, from εὖ (eu),  " well " , and φέρω (pherō),  " to bear " ) is a mental and [[emotion]]al condition which makes a person feel extremely happy, excited, and carefree. < ref > [http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/sym/euphoria.htm Euphoria - RightDiagnosis.com] < /ref >   These feelings are much stronger and more intense than what a human would normally feel.  However, some natural human behaviors can cause brief states of euphoria.  For example, people may feel euphoric for a short time after [[orgasm]], when in [[love]], or after a very important athletic achievement. < ref name= " DSM4phrases " > {{cite web|url=http://www.gatewaypsychiatric.com/key-dsm-iv-mental-status-exam-phrases|title=Key DSM-IV Mental Status Exam Phrases|publisher=Gateway Psychiatric Services|accessdate=2007-06-02|date=2007-05-10}} < /ref >   Sometimes, people can also feel euphoria during certain [[religion|religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[ritual]]s, or while [[meditation|meditating]]. < ref > " Psychophysical Correlates of the Practice of Tantric Yoga Meditation " . Corby, Roth, Zarcone,  &  Kopell. Archives of General Hackett, 1978. < /ref >   More often, euphoria is caused by certain [[psychoactive drug]]s, [[mental illness]]es, or medical problems.  Euphoria is the opposite of dysphoria. 
 
 ==Causes== 
 
 ===Drugs=== 
 
 Euphoria can be caused by psychoactive drugs like [[cocaine]] and [[alcohol]] [[methamphetamines]]. 
 
 Some of the drugs that can cause euphoria are: 
 
 *'''Alcohol''': People may feel euphoria soon after they begin drinking alcohol (especially in the first 10–15 minutes after they begin to drink). < ref > Christopher J. Morgan and Abdulla A.-B. Badawy.  " Alcohol-induced euphoria: exclusion of serotonin. "  ''Alcohol and Alcoholism'' (2001) 36 (1): 22-25. < /ref > 
 
 *'''Passion Flower''' (''Passiflora incarnata''): A [[sedative]] that calms the nervous system and acts as a sleep aid.  One compound in this herb, called harmine, may cause euphoria. < ref > {{cite web|last=Cotter|first=Malik|title=Herbs Make It Easy to Catch Some Zs|url=http://www.newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/nsn_backs/nov_99/understandingherbs.cfm|work=Nutrition Science News|publisher=Penton Media|accessdate=27 July 2011|archive-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226032836/http://www.newhope.com/nutritionsciencenews/nsn_backs/nov_99/understandingherbs.cfm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 *'''Cannabis''': Cannabis contains [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), which can cause euphoria as well as relaxation and sedation.  [[Marijuana]] and [[hashish]] are both made from cannabis plants. 
 
 *'''Stimulants''': Stimulant drugs can cause euphoria as well as high energy, hyperactivity, and lack of appetite.  There are different types of stimulants.  [[Amphetamine]]s (including [[methamphetamine]]) are the best known drugs in this category. < ref > Alan W. Cuthbert  " stimulants "  The Oxford Companion to the Body. Ed. Colin Blakemore and Sheila Jennett. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 28 July 2011 < /ref > 
 
 *'''MDMA''': Commonly called [[Ecstasy]], MDMA causes strong feelings of euphoria as well as rushes of energy.  MDMA and MDEA ( " Eve " ) are popular drugs among young adults. < ref name= " Body 2001 " / > < ref > " ecstasy "  World Encyclopedia. Philip's, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 28 July 2011 < /ref > 
 
 *'''Opium''': A drug made from the unripe seed-pods of the [[opium]] poppy.  It can cause euphoria and drowsiness, and can decrease pain.  [[Heroin]], [[morphine]], and [[codeine]] are made from opium. < ref >

 ===Mental Illness=== 
 
 Euphoria can be a [[symptom]] of some mental illnesses.  For example, euphoria is a common symptom of [[mania]], an extreme, high-energy mood state which can happen with [[bipolar disorder]] and other mental health conditions. 
 
 ===Medical Illness=== 
 
 Euphoria can also be a symptom of some medical problems.  It is a common symptom of [[hypoxia]].  It is a dangerous symptom, because it can make a hypoxic person feel so good and carefree that they do not realise that they are not getting enough oxygen. 
 
 Euphoria can be a symptom of [[hyperthyroidism]].  It can also be caused by head injuries or conditions which affect the [[central nervous system]], like [[syphilis]] and [[multiple sclerosis]]. < ref name= " Body 2001 " > Rhodri Hayward  " euphoria "  ''The Oxford Companion to the Body''. Ed. Colin Blakemore and Sheila Jennett. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 28 July 2011 < /ref > 
 
 ===Exercise=== 
 
 Sometimes, people feel euphoria when exercising.  A well-known example is  " runner's high, "  a state of euphoria and high energy that runners sometimes experience, especially during intense workouts.  According to recent studies, intense exercise can cause the brain to release [[endorphin]]s.  These endorphins attach to the same brain receptors as opioid drugs, so they can cause the same euphoric effects as those drugs do. < ref name= " hock " > {{cite book|last=Hockenbury|first=Don, Sandra|title=Discovering Psychology|url=https://archive.org/details/discoveringpsych0000hock_v3l8|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1650-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/discoveringpsych0000hock_v3l8/page/54 54]}} < /ref >   Unfortunately, this means that a person could get chemically [[addiction|addicted]] to consistent exercise, just as he or she might get addicted to opiates.
