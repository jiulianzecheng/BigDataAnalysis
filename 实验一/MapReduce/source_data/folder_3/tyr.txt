[[File:Ed0016.jpg|thumb|right|Tyr]]'''Tyr''' is the [[Deity|god]] of war, heroic endeavor and justice in [[Norse mythology]]. In the [[Edda]]s, he is either the son of [[Odin]] or [[Hymir]]. He is the god of single (man-to-man) [[combat]]. Tyr only has one hand. 
 
 == How Tyr lost his hand == 
 [[File:Tyr and Fenrir-John Bauer.jpg|thumb|right|Tyr and Fenrir]] 
 At one point in time, the gods decided that the wolf [[Fenrir]] (also called ''Fenriswolf'') could no longer go free. They wanted to lock him up onto a [[chain]]. But he broke every chain they tried to put on him. Finally, they had the [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] make a [[magic]]al chain. But Fenrir sensed what the gods would do. So Fenrir asked that one of them put his hand into his mouth. Knowing that if Fenrir was left unfettered, he would have grown strong enough to kill all the gods and destroy the world. Tyr was the only one who had the [[courage]]. When Fenrir sensed he had been tricked, he bit off Tyr's hand. Tyr remained handless forever. 
 
 Fenrir will remain bound until [[Ragnar√∂k]]. Then, Tyr's opponent will be [[:en:Garmr|Garm]], the guard [[dog]] of [[Hel (realm)|Hel]].
