The '''Theremin''' {{IPA|[ˈθɛɹəmɪn]}}, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.thereminworld.com/home/error?aspxerrorpath=/faq.asp|title=Theremin World - Error!|website=Theremin World}} < /ref >  (also '''thereminvox''' or '''aetherphone''') is one of the first fully [[electronic]] [[musical instrument]]s. It was invented by [[Russia]]n inventor [[Léon Theremin]] in October 1920 after the outbreak of the [[Russia]]n [[civil war]]. < ref > Albert Glinsky. 2000. ''Ether music and espionage'' p285 {{ISBN|0-252-02582-2}} < /ref >  Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement. It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]e to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. The other hand controls the [[loudness|volume]]. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] from the theremin are [[amplifier|amplified]] and sent to a [[loudspeaker]]. 
 
 The sound of the theremin is associated with  " alien, "  surreal, and eerie-sounding [[portamento]], [[glissando]], [[tremolo]], and [[vibrato]] sounds. It has been used in film soundtracks such as ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', ''[[Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' and ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''. The [[BBC]] [[Radiophonic Workshop]] used the theramin to provide the electronic sounds in demand in the mid-century. < ref name= " Horizontal " > {{cite web|url=https://www.moogmusic.com/news/bbc-radiophonic-workshop-0|publisher=Moog Music|title=BBC Radiophonic Workshop|accessdate=July 20, 2020}} < /ref >  Theremins are also used in art music (especially [[Experimental music|avant-garde]] and [[20th century]]  " [[new music]] " ) and in popular music genres such as [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. The [[Russia]]n [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film ''Odna''.
