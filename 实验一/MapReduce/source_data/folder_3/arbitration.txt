 {{Alternative dispute resolution}} 
 '''Arbitration''', a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR), is a way of resolving [[dispute]]s outside the [[court]]s. [[Litigation]] can be expensive, time-consuming and unpredictable. < ref name=FL > {{cite web |url=http://adr.findlaw.com/mediation/mediation-vs-arbitration-vs-litigation-whats-the-difference.html |title=Mediation vs. Arbitration vs. Litigation: What's the Difference?|publisher=FindLaw|access-date=22 October 2015}} < /ref >  With arbitration the parties to a dispute agree to have the [[wikt:disagreement|disagreement]] decided by a [[wikt:neutral|neutral]] [[wikt:third party|third party]]. < ref name=FreeDict > {{cite web |url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arbitration |title=Arbitration |publisher=The Free Dictionary/Farlex |access-date=22 October 2015}} < /ref >  More often this is a panel of three '''arbitrators'''. Each party suggests one, then both arbitrators agree on a third arbitrator. < ref name=FL/ >  The decision is the result of a majority vote. < ref name=FL/ > 
 
 == Arbitration (hearing) == 
 Arbitration includes an [[agreement]] in advance by both parties to comply with the decision of the arbitrator(s). The process includes a [[hearing (law)|hearing]] in which both parties may be heard. < ref name=FreeDict/ >  The arbitrator(s) reviews the evidence in the case and makes a decision. One that is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts. < ref > Arthur Sullivan; Steven M. Sheffrin, ''Economics: Principles in action'' (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2003), p. 324 < /ref > 
 
 == Mediation == 
 Another form of alternative [[conflict resolution|dispute resolution]] is mediation. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.wikimediation.org/ |title=Information World Mediation WikiMediation |access-date=2015-10-22 |archive-date=2015-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114085457/http://www.wikimediation.org/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Mediation and arbitration both use neutral third parties. For that reason they are sometimes confused. One difference is that a mediator does not make any decisions. Instead the mediator works towards getting both parties to agree. < ref name=Diffen > {{cite web |url=http://www.diffen.com/difference/Arbitrator_vs_Mediator |title=Dispute Resolution |publisher=Diffen |access-date=22 October 2015}} < /ref >  Unlike Arbitration, there is usually only one mediator. Another difference is that mediation is usually non-binding. < ref name=Diffen/ >  Mediation is used more often in smaller disputes or when the matter is kept [[confidential]]. < ref name=Diffen/ >  In some jurisdictions, mediation is required before a case can come to court. < ref name=FL/ >
