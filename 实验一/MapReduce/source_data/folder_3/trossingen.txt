 '''Trossingen''' is a [[town]] in South [[Germany]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]]). It is in a region called [[Baar (region)|Baar]], between the [[Swabian Alb]] and the [[Black Forest]]. 
 
 Trossingen is called a  " music town " . It has around 16,000 people who live there, there is the 'University of Music Trossingen', which is one of Baden-Württemberg's state conservatories, and there are other institutions specialized in musical education, like the 'Bundesakademie für musikalische Jugendbildung'  and the 'Hohner Konservatorium'. In 1857 the [[Hohner|Matthias Hohner]] company was founded. Today, Hohner [[harmonica]]s and [[accordion]]s are famous all over the world. Trossingen houses the German Harmonica Museum, too. Trossingen also has a historic railway: the ''Trossinger Eisenbahn''. Several skeletons of the [[dinosaur]] ''[[Plateosaurus]] engelhardti'' were found in Trossingen during excavations in the early 20th century. The local museum Auberlehaus houses several of the original bones.
