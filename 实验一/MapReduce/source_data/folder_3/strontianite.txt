'''Strontianite''' ([[Strontium|Sr]][[Carbon|C]][[Oxygen|O]] < sub > 3 < /sub > ) is an important raw material. It is used for the extraction of [[strontium]]. It is a rare [[carbonate mineral]] and also one of a few strontium minerals. It is a member of the aragonite group.

 The mineral was named in 1791. It was named after the place [[Strontian]], Argyllshire, [[Scotland]]. The discovery of the element strontium was also made the previous year (1790) before the mineral was named in Strontian. < ref name= " Dana " > Gaines et al (1997) Danaâ€™s New Mineralogy Eighth Edition.  Wiley < /ref >  Strontium is more common than [[copper]] and is found at a level of 370 parts per million by weight, 87 parts per million by [[Mole (unit)|moles]] in the [[Earth's crust]]. < ref name= " Chemicool " > {{cite web|title=Strontium|url=http://www.chemicool.com/elements/strontium.html|access-date=August 24, 2011}} < /ref >   The ores of strontium are [[Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] SrSO < sub > 4 < /sub >  and strontianite SrCO < sub > 3 < /sub > . Strontium is not found freely in nature and the process of producing strontium metal commercially involves reducing strontium oxide with [[aluminium]]. Good mineral samples of strontianite are rare. < ref name= " Chemicool "  / >
