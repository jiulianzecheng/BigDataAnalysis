'''Heterosexism''' is the belief that only [[men]] and [[women]] should [[sexual intercourse|have sex]], or that only men and women should [[love]] each other as more than a friend or family member. It is also the belief that sex and love between men and women is better than other types of sex and love. Heterosexism is not just something a single person can believe but is taught by [[society]] and [[culture]]. Heterosexist beliefs can cause people to act unfairly towards people who are [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], or [[asexuality|asexual]]. 
 
 Heterosexism is related to [[homophobia]] and [[biphobia]] in the same way that [[sexism]] is related to [[misogyny]] and [[transphobia]].
