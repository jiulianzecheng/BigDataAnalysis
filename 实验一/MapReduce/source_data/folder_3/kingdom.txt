{{for|the groups of living things|kingdom (biology)}} 
 
 A '''kingdom''' is the most common type of [[monarchy]]. This means that the ruler or [[head of state]]) of the [[country]] is a [[king]]. They get their position from [[inheritance]]. With some countries a female may become head of state as a queen.  
 
 When the current king or queen dies, then their eldest child becomes the new monarch.  
 
 For example, the [[United Kingdom]] has a [[Charles III|king]] as [[head of state]]. His mother [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] was, at the time of her father's death, his only child. 
 
 Not all countries have this system. Many countries today have no royal family. In their case, the head of state is a leading politician.
