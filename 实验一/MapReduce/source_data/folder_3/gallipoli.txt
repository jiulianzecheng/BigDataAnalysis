 The '''Gallipoli''' peninsula ({{IPA-en|ɡəˈlɪpɵli}}; {{lang-tr|Gelibolu Yarımadası}}; {{lang-gr|Καλλίπολη}}) is in Turkish [[East Thrace]], the European part of [[Turkey]].  To the west there is the [[Aegean Sea]] and to the east there are the [[Dardanelles]] straits. 
 
 ==History== 
 After an earthquake in 1354, the Greek city of Gallipoli was abandoned, then occupied by Turks from [[Anatolia]].  This made it the first [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] position in Europe. < ref > Crowley, Roger. 1453: ''The Holy War for Constantinople and the Clash of Islam and the West''. New York: Hyperion, 2005. p 31 {{ISBN|1-4013-0850-3}}. < /ref > 
 
 The peninsula was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] slowly conquered it from 13th century to the 15th century.  By the 19th century, thirty thousand people lived in the city: Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Jews and Xoraxane Roma. 
 
 It was a big [[military camp]] for the British and French forces during the [[Crimean War]] (1854).  It was also a stopping-off point on the way to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. < ref name =  " Plus " > [http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Crimea/Black_Sea_1854/04_28.html  Crimea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222234538/http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Crimea/Black_Sea_1854/04_28.html |date=2006-02-22 }}. < /ref > < ref name =  " Victorian " > [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/usher/despatch.html Crimea], Victorian Web. < /ref >
