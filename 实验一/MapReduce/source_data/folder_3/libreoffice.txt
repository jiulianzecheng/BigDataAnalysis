 '''LibreOffice''' is a free [[open source]] [[office suite]]. It was [[fork (software development)|forked]] from [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[OpenOffice.org]] office suite. It is a collection of office-related applications. This includes a word processor, a spreadsheet program and a presentation program. It is available for many different operating systems, including [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. It supports the [[OpenDocument]] format as well as the file formats of Microsoft Office and most other office suites. 
 
 LibreOffice was created by [[the Document Foundation]] in response to [[Oracle Corporation]]'s acquisition of Sun Microsystems. < ref name= " Document Foundation Announcement " > {{cite web |url=https://listarchives.documentfoundation.org/www/announce/msg00000.html |title=OpenOffice.org Community announces The Document Foundation |date=28 September 2010 |publisher=The Document Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226054242/https://listarchives.documentfoundation.org/www/announce/msg00000.html |archive-date=26 December 2010 |access-date=8 October 2021 |url-status=live}} < /ref > < ref name= " Document Foundation ArsTechnica " > {{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/09/document-foundation-forks-openofficeorg-to-liberate-it-from-oracle/ |title=Document Foundation forks OpenOffice.org, liberates it from Oracle |last=Paul |first=Ryan |access-date=8 October 2021 |publisher=Ars Technica |archive-date=22 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822102322/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/09/document-foundation-forks-openofficeorg-to-liberate-it-from-oracle/ |url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 == Parts == 
 LibreOffice is a collection of applications that work together closely to provide the features expected from a modern office suite. Many of the parts are designed to be alternatives to those available in Microsoft Office. The parts available include: 
 
 {|class= " wikitable "  style= " margin: 1em auto 1em auto " 
 |- 
 ! colspan= " 2 "  | Component !! Notes 
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Writer Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Writer|Writer]]'''|| A [[word processor]] similar in [[look and feel]] to [[Microsoft Word]] and offering a comparable range of functions and tools. It also includes the ability to export [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) files with no additional software, and can also function as a [[WYSIWYG]] editor for creating and editing [[web page]]s. 
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Calc Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Calc|Calc]]'''|| A [[spreadsheet]] similar to [[Microsoft Excel]] with a roughly equivalent range of features. Calc provides a number of features not present in Excel, including a system which automatically defines series for graphing, based on the layout of the user’s data. Calc is also capable of writing spreadsheets directly as a PDF file. 
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Impress Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Impress|Impress]]'''|| A [[presentation program]] similar to [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. It includes the ability to create PDF files, and the ability to read Microsoft PowerPoint's .ppt and .pptx formats. Impress includes several ready-made presentation designs. More templates are readily available on the Internet. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?Tags%5B%5D=43 & Tags%5B%5D=118 |title=LibreOffice Impress Templates repository |website=LibreOffice.org |publisher=The Document Foundation |access-date=8 October 2021}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://claudio.cicali.org/article/70/templates-for-openoffice-impress |title=Caludio's personal hideout: Templates for Openoffice Impress |access-date=2008-08-21 |archive-date=2006-02-23 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060223011553/http://claudio.cicali.org/article/70/templates-for-openoffice-impress |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template/presentations/index.html Presentation templates at OpenOffice.org] < /ref > < ref > [http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template_2_x/impress/index.html Impress Templates - User/Template] < /ref > 
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Draw Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Draw|Draw]]'''|| A [[vector graphics editor]] comparable in features to [[Microsoft Visio]] and early versions of [[CorelDRAW]]. It features versatile  " connectors "  between shapes, which are available in a range of line styles and facilitate building drawings such as flowcharts. It has similar features to [[desktop publishing]] software such as [[Scribus]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]].  
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Base Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Base|Base]]'''|| A [[database]] program similar to [[Microsoft Access]]. Base allows the creation and manipulation of databases (using [[HSQLDB]] or [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] as its storage engine), and the building of forms and reports to provide easy access to data for end-users. As with Access, Base may be used as a front-end to a number of different database systems, including Access databases ([[Microsoft Jet Database Engine|JET]]), [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]]/[[Java Database Connectivity|JDBC]] data sources and [[MySQL]], [[MariaDB]], [[PostgreSQL]]. While Base can be a front-end for any of the databases listed, there is no need for any of them to be installed. 
 |- 
 |[[File:LibreOffice 7.5 Math Icon.png|48px]] ||'''[[LibreOffice Math|Math]]'''|| A tool for creating and editing mathematical formulae, similar to [[Equation Editor|Microsoft Equation Editor]]. Formulae can be embedded inside other LibreOffice documents, such as those created by Writer. It supports multiple [[typeface|fonts]] and can export to PDF.

 * '''Fresh''' – the most recent major version, which contains the latest enhancements but which may have introduced [[software bug|bugs]] that are not in the  " still "  release. 
 * '''Still''' – the prior major version, which, by the time it has become the  " still "  version, has had around six months of bug fixing. Users who want the most stable software should use this.

 ===Release time=== 
 
 LibreOffice releases a new major version every six months, in late January/early February and late July/early August. < ref name= " Release Plan " > {{cite web |url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan |title=Release Plan |website=The Document Foundation Wiki |access-date=8 October 2021 |archive-date=1 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501164048/https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan |url-status=live }} < /ref >
