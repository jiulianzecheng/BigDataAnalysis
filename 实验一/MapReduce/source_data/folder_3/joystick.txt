 A '''joystick''' is an [[input device]] consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling.  
 
 The joystick has been the principal flight control column in the [[cockpit]] of many aircraft, particularly military fast jets, where center stick or side-stick location may be employed. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles and zero turning radius lawn mowers.  
 
 Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern [[video game consoles]] is the analog stick. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as [[mobile phone]]s.
