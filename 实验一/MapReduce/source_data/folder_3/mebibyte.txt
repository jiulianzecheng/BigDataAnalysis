A '''mebibyte''' is a [[Unit of measurement|unit of measure]]. It represents 1024 * 1024 [[byte]]s.  
 
 A '''mebibyte''' (a [[contraction]] of '''me'''ga '''bi'''nary '''byte''') is a unit of [[information]] or [[computer data storage]], symbol '''MiB'''. 
 
 :1 MiB = 2 < sup > 20 < /sup >  [[byte]]s = 1,048,576 bytes = 1,024 [[kibibyte]]s 
 
 The mebibyte is closely related to the [[megabyte]] (MB). Megabyte can either be a synonym for mebibyte, or refer to 10 < sup > 6 < /sup >  bytes = 1,000,000 bytes, depending on context (see [[binary prefix]] for background). The two numbers are relatively close together, but mistaking the two has nevertheless led to problems.  
 
 The unit MiB was defined by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in December 1998.  Use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] and [[International Committee for Weights and Measures|CIPM]] and is becoming more common. 
 
 One mebibyte equals 1024 (= 2 < sup > 10 < /sup > ) [[kibibyte]]s, and 1024 mebibytes equal one [[gibibyte]]. 
 
 M'''i'''bibyte is a common misspelling, presumably from the  " i "  in the abbreviation or confusion about how the surrounding prefixes (i.e.,  " kibi "  and  " gibi " ) were actually formed.  The  " i "  is actually from the end of the prefix.  Tebi- and pebi- are similarly abbreviated Ti- and Pi-, but they are not usually misspelled.
