 A '''cartouche''' is a [[hieroglyph]]ic symbol of an [[ancient Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]]. < ref name= " OED-cartouche " > The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-861263-X}} - p.281  " '''cartouche''': a carved tablet or drawing... an oval or oblong enclosing a group of Egyptian hieroglyphs, typically representing the name and title of a monarch " . < /ref >  It is [[oval]] with a horizontal line at one end, showing that the text enclosed is a [[pharaoh|royal]] name. < ref name= " OED-cartouche " / > 
 
 It starts to be used at the beginning of the Fourth [[Dynasty]] under Pharaoh [[Sneferu]]. The cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, but it is horizontal if it makes the name fit better, with a vertical line on the left. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://artyfactory.org/egyptian_art/cartouche_lesson/cartouche_lesson.htm |title=Ancient Egyptian Cartouche Lesson |publisher=Artyfactory.org |access-date=2013-08-22}} < /ref >  The [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] word for it was ''shenu''. In [[Ancient Egypt#Writing|demotic writing]], the cartouche was reduced to a pair of brackets and a vertical line. 
 
 Of the five royal titles it was the ''prenomen'', the throne name, and the  " Son of Ra "  titulary, < ref > [http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html Ancient-egypt.org] < /ref >  the so-called ''nomen'' name given at birth, which were enclosed by a cartouche. < ref > Allen, James Peter, ''Middle Egyptian: an introduction to the language and culture of hieroglyphs'', Cambridge University Press 2000, p.65 < /ref > 
 
 At times [[amulet]]s were given the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs. Such items are often important to archaeologists for dating the tomb and its contents. < ref > Peet, Thomas Eric  &  Loat, William Leonard Stevenson. ''The Cemeteries of Abydos. Part 3. 1912-1913'', Adamant Media Corporation, {{ISBN|1-4021-5715-0}}, p.23 < /ref >  Cartouches were only worn by pharaohs.
