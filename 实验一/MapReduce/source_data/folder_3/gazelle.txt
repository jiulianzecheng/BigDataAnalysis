 '''Gazelles''' are a kind of [[antelope]]. They are in the [[genus|genera]] ''Gazella'', ''Eudorcas'' and ''Nanger''. 
 
 Gazelles are mostly found in the grasslands and [[savanna]]s of [[Africa]], but they are also found in southwest [[Asia]]. Gazelles are known as fast animals. They can reach high speeds for long periods of time. They usually live in herds. They eat plants and leaves. They show a special way of running slowly and jumping high when they are chased by [[lion]]s or [[cheetah]]s. 
 
 Gazelle comes from the Arabic ''ghazăl'' ({{lang-ar|غزال}}). < ref name=walterp66 > {{cite book|title=French inside out: the worldwide development of the French language in the past, the present and the future|first1=Henriette|last1=Walter|first2=Peter D.|last2=Fawcett|editor=Peter D.
