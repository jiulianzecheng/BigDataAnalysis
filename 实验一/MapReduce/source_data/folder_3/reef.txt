 A '''reef''' is a [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[sandbar]], or other feature below the water surface (less than 80 meters  below low water). 
 
 The best-known reefs are the [[coral reefs]] in tropical waters. They are built by [[coral]]s and [[calcareous]] [[algae]]. Artificial reefs such as [[shipwreck]]s are sometimes created to attract fish and other organisms.
