 '''Halloween''' is a [[celebration]] on the night of [[October 31]]. It is most practiced in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]]. [[Children]] wear [[costume]]s and go to people's homes saying  " Trick or treat! "  to ask for [[candy]] (sweets in the [[UK]]) and people give it to them. The suggestion is:  " Give me a treat or I will play a trick on you. "   People traditionally dress up as [[ghosts]], [[witch]]es, or other scary things for Halloween. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-10-28|title=How To Remove Halloween Makeup Easily|url=https://beverlyhillsmd.com/how-to-remove-halloween-makeup/|url-status=dead|access-date=2021-11-16|website=Beverly Hills MD|language=en-US|archive-date=2022-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221026180801/https://beverlyhillsmd.com/how-to-remove-halloween-makeup/}} < /ref >

This covers the three days – [[October 31]] (All-Hallows [[Eve]] or Hallowe'en), [[November 1]] (All Saints) and [[November 2]] (All Souls).  All Hallows' is a [[Christianization|Christianized]] holiday and originated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It also has [[Paganism|pagan]] roots. < ref > {{cite book| last = Rogers| first = Nicholas

 == Origins == 
 Halloween originated from [[Ireland]]. The [[pagan]] holiday ''[[:en:Samhain|Samhain]]'', which the ''All Saints'' holy day replaced, was also known as the ''[[Day of the Dead]]''. Many [[wicca]]ns and modern pagans celebrate the ''Day of the [[Dead]]''. It is the day that some believed the [[soul]]s of dead people come back to [[Earth]]. This is a ''[[happy]]'' holiday (even though it celebrates [[death]]) because some of the souls will visit the homes of their family. [[Pope Gregory III]] originally designated Halloween on November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/history-of-halloween | title=Halloween 2021 }} < /ref > 
 
 Many [[Lutheran]] churches celebrate a holiday on November 2 called the [[Reformation]]. This holiday celebrates the day that [[Martin Luther]] put [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] on a church door. 
 
 After mass Irish and Scottish immigration in the 19th century, [[Halloween]] became a major holiday in [[America]]. 
 
 The pagan rituals of earlier times evolved into fun and games.  For example, the concept of connecting to the dead was replaced with the more lighthearted idea of telling the future.  Bobbing for apples became popular as a [[fortune-telling]] game on All Hallows' Eve: Apples would be selected to represent a woman's suitors, and the apple she ended up biting into would supposedly represent her future husband.  Halloween posed a huge matchmaking opportunity for young women in the 19th century. < ref > {{Cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Blair|last2=Gold|first2=Marissa|date=2021-10-27|title=What's the Real History of Halloween—and Why Do We Celebrate It on October 31?|url=https://www.countryliving.com/entertaining/a40250/heres-why-we-really-celebrate-halloween/|access-date=2021-11-16|website=Country Living|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Symbols == 
 [[File:Jack-o'-lantern (Banovci) 01.jpg|thumb|Jack-o'-lantern (Banovci) 01]] 
 Development of symbols connected with Halloween formed with time. [[Jack-o'-lantern|Jack-o'-lanterns]] are traditionally carried on All Hallows' Eve in order to scare evil spirits. Elements of the fall season, such as [[Pumpkin|pumpkins]], [[harvest]], and [[Scarecrow|scarecrows]], are also common. Homes are often decorated with these types of symbols around Halloween. Halloween imagery includes themes of horror, magic and the [[supernatural]]. Black, and orange are Halloween's traditional colors. 
 
 ==Costumes== 
 [[File:Day 304- Happy Halloween!.jpg|alt=|thumb|Children in costumes]] 
 During Halloween, some people, especially children, wear costumes. People have worn costumes at Halloween for [[century|centuries]]. Wearing a costume may come from [[Celts|Celtic]] festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Calan Gaeaf]]. It could also be from the [[Christian]] [[Allhallowtide]]. 
 
 Early costumes were usually scary. They were often supernatural beings or from [[folklore]]. In the 1930s costumes of characters from [[literature]], radio, or [[movie]]s became popular, and such costumes are also popular today. Scary costumes are still popular. 
 
 == Games and Other Activities == 
 In addition to trick-or-treating, there are several traditional activities connected with Halloween.  
 
 * In old times people would try to tell the future, especially to try to learn who they would marry. 
 * People make Jack-o-lanterns and place them in front of their houses. 
 * People play a game called [[:en:Apple_bobbing#/media/File:Apple_bobbing.jpg|apple bobbing]]. In this game apples are placed in water, and people must try to remove the apples with only their teeth. 
 * Telling ghost stories, listening to Halloween-themed songs and watching horror films are common activities on Halloween. TV shows (with special shows usually for children) are commonly shown on or before Halloween, and new scary films are often released before Halloween. 
 * Visiting a 'haunted attraction'. These are places like houses, farms, or forests, which are decorated in a scary way, and where actors in costumes make scenes to scare the visitors. 
 * Decorating one's house and front yard. People will often decorate the front part of their houses with Halloween-themed symbols like ghosts, [[Grave|graves]], and black and orange objects.
