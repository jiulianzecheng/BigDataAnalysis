'''Galmudug''' is a [[secular]] [[state]] in the central [[region]] of [[Somalia]]. The [[Administration|administrative]] [[Capital (city)|capital]] is [[South Galcayo]]. It is in the southern half of the [[city]] and [[district]] of [[Gaalkacyo]]. To the north is [[Puntland]], to the west is [[Ethiopia]] and to the south and east is the rest of Somalia, presently under the control of the [[Transitional Federal Government]]  (TFG). The name is a combination of Galguduud and Mudug. Unlike the [[Somaliland]]  region in northwestern Somalia, Galmudug is not trying to be accepted as a separate [[country]]. It believes itself to be a [[federal ]]division within the larger federal republic of Somalia, such as defined by the 2004 Transitional Federal Charter (TFG).
