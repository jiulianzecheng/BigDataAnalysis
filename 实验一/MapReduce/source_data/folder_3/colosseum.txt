 The '''Colosseum''', also known as the '''Flavian Amphitheatre''', is a large [[artefact]] or structure in the [[city]] of [[Rome]]. The construction of the Colosseum started around 70–72 [[AD]] and was finished in 80 AD. [[Emperor Vespasian]] started all the work, and Emperor [[Titus]] completed the colosseum. Emperor [[Domitian]] made some changes to the building between 81 and 96 AD. < ref name= " roth " > {{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding architecture: its elements, history and meaning | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | isbn=0-06-430158-3 | pages=}} < /ref >  It had seating for 50,000 people. < ref > William H.

 The Colosseum is in Rome, the capital of Italy. More precisely, it is on the east bank of the Tiber, the river that crosses the city, east of the ancient Roman forum. A forum in antiquity was a geographical area in which were the main buildings of power, as well as the large square on which the population met. It was both a busy place to live, a place to get married, big parties, community meetings, and so on. The stadium was less than a kilometer to the southwest, the Capitol was a little over a mile to the west. 
 
 Colosseum was first called the '''Flavian Amphitheatre''' or in [[Latin]], the '''Amphitheatrum Flavium'''. This was after Vespasian and Titus who had the family name of ''Flavius''. It was used for [[gladiator]]ial contests, and other shows like ''animal hunts'', in which animals would hunt and eat prisoners; or in which gladiators would fight against animals. There were also [[execution]]s of prisoners, plays, and [[battle]] scenes; sometimes it was filled with water to fight sea battles. The people of Rome could go into the Colosseum without any costs; it was free. 
 
 In the [[Middle Ages]], after the mid-fifth century, it was no longer used for performances. It was then used as housing, workshops, a [[Christian]] [[shrine]], and as a supply of building stones. 
 
 It is now in ruins because of [[earthquakes]]. The Colosseum is a symbol of the Roman Empire. It is one of Rome's most popular [[tourist]] attractions. On [[Good Friday]]s, the [[Pope]] leads a torch lit [[Stations of the Cross#Modern Usage| " Way of the Cross "  procession]] around the various levels of the amphitheatre. < ref name= " wayofthecross-frommers " > {{cite web|url=http://events.frommers.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event & event_id=11442|title=Frommer's Events - Event Guide: Good Friday Procession in Rome (Palatine Hill, Italy)|publisher=Frommer's|accessdate=2008-04-08}} < /ref > 
 
 The Colosseum appears on the [[Euro]] five cent coins.

 The building of the Colosseum began under the rule of the Emperor [[Vespasian]] in around 70–72 AD. The area was flat, in a valley between the [[Caelian Hill|Caelian]], [[Esquiline Hill|E]] < ref > {{Cite journal|date=1789-05-24|title=V|journal=}} < /ref > [[Esquiline Hill|squiline]] and [[Palatine Hill]]s. There was a stream flowing through the valley, but this had been made into a [[canal]]. People had been living in this area for over 200 years, but the houses were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 AD. The Emperor [[Nero]] took much of the land for his own use. He built a grand [[palace]], the ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' which had a lake, gardens, paths covered with a roof held up by [[column]]s ([[portico]]es), and large shelters ([[pavilion]]s) to sit in. He had the ''Aqua Claudia'' [[aqueduct]] made longer to supply water to the area. There was also a big [[bronze]] [[statue]] of Nero, the [[Colossus of Nero]], at the front of the Domus Aurea. < ref name= " claridge " > {{cite book | first=Amanda | last=Claridge | year=1998 | title=Rome: an Oxford archaeological guide | url=https://archive.org/details/romeoxfordarchae00aman | publisher=Oxford University Press, 1998 | location=Oxford, UK | isbn=0-19-288003-9 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/romeoxfordarchae00aman/page/276 276]–282}} < /ref >  In 68 AD, Nero lost control of the government. The [[Senate]] made him a public [[outlaw]], and he killed himself soon after. 
 
 == A great moment == 
 To [[wikt:celebrate|celebrate]] the end of Nero's rule, the Emperor Vespasian built the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake. This was seen as giving back the land to the people of Rome. The Romans often built [[monument]]s to celebrate important events, and the Colosseum is a part of that [[tradition]]. < ref name= " claridge "  / > 
 
 Most of the Domus Aurea was torn down. The lake was filled in and the land used for the Colosseum. Schools for gladiators and other buildings were put up in the old gardens of the Domus Aurea. The Colossus was left in place, but Nero's head was replaced. Vespasian renamed it after the sun-god, [[Helios]] (''Colossus Solis''). Many historians say that the name of the Colosseum comes from the statue, the Colossus. < ref > [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Colossus_Neronis.html Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, 1929. ''A topographical dictionary of Ancient Rome,'' (London: Oxford University Press), ''s.v.''  " Colossus Neronis " ]. < /ref >  The Colosseum was originally structured to accomoodate a total of 70000 guests of which 60000 could be seated while rested 10000 can be stand. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Rafhel|first=Andrew|title=Colosseum Rome: About|url=https://www.colosseumrome-tickets.com/about|access-date=2023-08-17|website=Colosseum tickets|language=en}} < /ref >  Usually in Roman cities, the amphitheatres were built on the edge of the city. 
 The Colosseum was built in the city centre; in effect, placing it in the real and [[symbol]]ic heart of Rome. 
 
 == Fights == 
 The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished and the building opened by his son, [[Titus]], in 80. < ref name=roth/ >  Cassius Dio said that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the opening games. The building was changed by Vespasian's younger son, Emperor [[Domitian]]. He added the ''[[hypogeum]]'', underground tunnels used to hold the animals and [[slave]]s used in the games. He also added a fourth level at the top of the Colosseum to add more seats. 
 
 == Renovations == 
 
 In 217, the Colosseum was badly damaged by fire. Cassius Dio < ref > Cass. Dio lxxviii.25 < /ref >  said the fire was started by [[lightning]]. The fire destroyed the wooden upper levels inside the amphitheatre. It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320. [[Theodosius II]] and [[Valentinian III]] (ruled 425–450), repaired damage caused by an earthquake in 443; more work followed in 484 and 508. The last record of gladiator fights is about 435, while animal hunts continued until at least 523. < ref name= " claridge "  / > 
 
 == The Colosseum in medieval times ==

 The Colosseum went through big changes of use during the [[medieval]] period. At the end of the 500's, a small church had been built into a part of the building. The arena was used as a cemetery. The areas under the seating was used for houses and workshops. There are records of the space being rented as late as the 1100s. About 1200, the [[Frangipani family]] took over the Colosseum and made it into a castle. 
 
 During the great earthquake in 1349, the outer south side fell down. Most of the fallen stones were used to build palaces, churches, hospitals and other buildings in Rome. In the middle of the 1300s, a [[religious]] group moved into the north part, and were still there in the 1800s. The inside of the Colosseum was used to supply building stones. The [[marble]] [[facade]] was burned to make [[quicklime]]. < ref name= " claridge "  / >  The [[bronze]] clamps which held the stonework together were ripped off the walls leaving marks that can still be seen today.

 [[File:Cole Thomas Interior of the Colosseum Rome 1832.jpg|thumbnail|''Interior of the Colosseum, Rome''. [[Thomas Cole]], 1832. One can see the [[Stations of the Cross]] around the arena and the many plants, both removed later in the 19th century.|alt=]] 
 During the 16th and 17th century, Church officials looked for a use for the big and ruined building. [[Pope Sixtus V]] (1521–1590) wanted to turn the building into a wool [[factory]] to provide jobs for Rome's [[prostitute]]s, but he died and the idea given up. < ref > " Rome. "  ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. < /ref >  In 1671 [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Altieri said it could be used for [[bullfight]]s. Many people were upset by this idea, it was quickly dropped.

 In 1749, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] said that the Colosseum was a [[sacred]] place where early Christians had been [[martyr]]ed. He stopped people from taking any more building stones away. He set up the [[Stations of the Cross]] inside the building. He said the place was made sacred with the blood of the Christian martyrs who had died there. However, there is no historical evidence that any Christians had been killed in the Colosseum. 
 
 Later popes started projects to save the building from falling down. They took out the many plants which had overgrown the building and were causing more damage. The facade was made stronger with [[triangle|triangular]] brick wedges in 1807 and 1827. The inside was repaired in 1831, 1846 and in the 1930s. The underground area was partly dug out in 1810–1814 and 1874. This digging was finished by [[Benito Mussolini]] in the 1930s. < ref name= " claridge "  / > '

 The Colosseum is a free standing building, quite different to the earlier [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] theatres which were built into the sides of hills. It is really two [[Roman theatre]]s joined together. It is [[oval]] shaped, 189 meters (615 & nbsp;ft / 640 Roman feet) long, and 156 meters (510 & nbsp;ft / 528 Roman feet) wide. It covers an area of {{convert|6|acre|m2|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The outer wall is 48 meters (157 & nbsp;ft / 165 Roman feet) high. The distance around the building was 545 meters (1,788 & nbsp;ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The arena is an oval {{convert|287|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|180|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} wide, surrounded by a wall {{convert|15|ft|m|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} high. Around the arena were raised rows of seating. 
 
 The outer wall was made from about {{convert|100000|m3|cuyd}} of [[travertine]] stone. This was held together by {{Convert|300|t|lb|abbr=}} of iron clamps. There was no [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] used to hold the wall together. < ref name= " claridge "  / >  The outside wall has been badly damaged over the years. Large sections have fallen down after earthquakes. The north side of the outside wall is still standing. It has triangular brick wedges at each end, added in the early 1800s to hold up the wall. The rest of the outside wall that can be seen today, is in fact the original inside wall.
