 < !-- The flags are in the correct order, with the second flag of the Republic of Rhodesia -- that existed for 80% of the existence of  " Rhodesia "  -- given prominence because the Republic of Rhodesia is really what this article is about, and it was the flag of the country when the country ceased to exist. The other flag, while the  " first "  flag, was almost unknown outside of Rhodesia (and the UK) and it makes no sense to give it prominence over the flag of the Republic of Rhodesia. To make an analogy, it would be like making the flag in the article on the United Kingdom the flag of Great Britain of 1606/1707 (without St. Patrick's Cross), or the flag of the United States article the old Betsy Ross flag with thirteen stars in a circle. If you disagree with this, please take it to the talk page where this can be discussed, and where there is already a section addressing it. -- >

Rhodesia/Zimbabwe (1964-present) }} < /ref >  was a republic in Southern Africa during the [[Cold War]]. It was the region that is now called [[Zimbabwe]]. The country replaced the [[United Kingdom|British]] colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]]. 
 
 == Nomenclature == 
 The official name of the country under British law was  " Southern Rhodesia " , but the government in [[Harare|Salisbury]] used the name  " Rhodesia "  instead. This situation dated back to October 1964, when the colony of [[Northern Rhodesia]] changed its name to [[Zambia]] following independence,  so the colonial government felt that  " Southern "  Rhodesia should no longer be used because there was no  " Northern "  Rhodesia. However, Britain believed that only their government could change the colony's name and not the colony itself. 
 
 == History == 
 === Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) === 
 The British government adopted a policy called ''no independence before majority rule'', which dictated that colonies with a certain amount of [[White people|white settlers]] would not become independent until they adopted a policy of [[majority rule]]. This had conflicted with the beliefs of the white minority [[Rhodesian Front]], lead by [[Ian Smith]], which believed that Rhodesia should become an independent country anyway. This continued until relations between the colony and the British government broke down in 1965. 
 
 On 11 November 1965, Smith's government issued a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|unilateral declaration of independence]] (UDI) from the [[United Kingdom]]. Many countries condemned the UDI and the [[United Nations Security Council]] placed sanctions on Rhodesia. 
 
 Rhodesia sought international recognition as a [[Commonwealth realm]], with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as  " Queen of Rhodesia " , but later severed it links to the British Crown by becoming a [[republic]] on 2 March 1970. 
 
 == The Bush War == 
 
 As early as [[1960]], many African nationalists began to challenge Rhodesia's minority rule policies. In [[1964]], tensions boiled over and the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] began. On one side, the minority rule government, led by Ian Smith, hoped to keep the whites in power. On the other side, the [[ZANU-PF]], led by [[Robert Mugabe]], fought for majority rule. After about 15 years of fighting, the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] was signed which allowed majority rule. This led to [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[independence]].
