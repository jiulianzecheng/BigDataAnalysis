'''Surfing''' is a [[water sport]] done in the [[ocean]] or [[sea]]. The surfer uses their surfboard to catch a [[wave (water)|wave]] and ride in towards the shore. 
 
 Surfing was invented by the [[Polynesia]]ns at least 4000 years ago. Surfing made its Olympic debut at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It has become a popular [[sport]] among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in [[Australia]], the US, and [[Northern Europe]].
