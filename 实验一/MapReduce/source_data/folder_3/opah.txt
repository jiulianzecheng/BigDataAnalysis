 '''Opahs''' (moonfish, kingfish, or sunfish) are large, [[color]]ful fish. They are in a small [[family (biology)|family]], the '''Lampridae'''. The family has only  two living [[species]] in one [[genus]], '''''Lampris'''''. The opah is the only known fish that is completely [[Thermoregulation|warm-blooded]]. < ref >  Yong, Ed 2015. Meet the Comical Opah, the only truly warm-blooded fish.  '''National Geographic''', 14 May. [http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/14/meet-the-comical-opah-the-only-truly-warm-blooded-fish/] < /ref > 
 
 One species lives in [[tropics|tropical]] or [[temperate zone|temperate]] waters in most [[ocean]]s. The other species lives in the [[Southern Ocean]]. Opahs are not often caught by [[recreation]]al [[fishing|fishermen]]. Opah flesh has a light pink-to-orange color. The flesh turns white when [[cooking|cooked]].
