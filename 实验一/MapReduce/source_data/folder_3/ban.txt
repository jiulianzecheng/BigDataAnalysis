:''For the policy on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans]].'' 
 A '''ban''' is an action used to stop people from doing something, either bad or dangerous. Ban can also be made on [[Product (consumer goods)|products]]. For example, [[Singapore]], a [[country]], bans [[chewing gum]]. Ban may sometimes be made on the [[Internet]], where an [[administrator]] or a [[moderator]] with higher powers than other members can stop [[vandals]] from causing harm to others. Sometimes, users of a website say that moderators or administrators have [[banhammers]] that they use to ban bad users.
