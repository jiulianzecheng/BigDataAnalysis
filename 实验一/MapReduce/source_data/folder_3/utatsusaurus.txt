 '''''Utatsusaurus''''' is the earliest-known form of an [[ichthyopterygia]]n. It lived in the earliest [[Lower Triassic]] period, about 250{{ndash}}245 millions years ago. It is nearly 3m (about 9 feet) long with a slender body. < ref name=motani1998 > Motani R; Minoura N. and Ando T. 1998.

 The name ''Utatsusaurus'' was given after the city [[Utatsu, Miyagi|Utatsu-cho]] where the first specimen was found. < ref name=shikama > Shikama T;  Kamei T. and Murata M. 1977.

Unlike the more advanced ichthyosaurs, ''Utatsusaurus'' has no [[dorsal fin]] and has a broad [[skull]]. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more [[derived]] [[Ichthyopterygia|ichthyopterygians]]. < ref name= " cuthbertson " > Cuthbertson R.S; Russell A.P. and Anderson J.S. 2013.

''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology''. '''33'''(4): 817-830. {{doi|10.1080/02724634.2013.756495}} < /ref >  The tail had a long low fin, quite different from the tail shape of later forms. This suggests that the animal swam by [[undulation]], waving its body to  &  fro, rather than using its paddles and tail.

 The [[2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami]] destroyed the local museum, but fortunately the specimens were not there at the time.
