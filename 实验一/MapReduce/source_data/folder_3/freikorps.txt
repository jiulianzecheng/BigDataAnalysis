 The word '''Freikorps''' ([[German language|German]] for  " Free Corps " ) was first used for voluntary [[army|armies]] in [[Germany]]. After [[World War I]] the term was used for [[paramilitary]] units. The Freikorps got famous at the time of the [[Weimar Republic]] to fight in some towns against [[Communism]]. 
 
 ==First Freikorps== 
 The first freikorps were started by [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[18th century|eighteenth century]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Other freikorps were started during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and were [[Command (military)|commanded]] by people such as [[Ferdinand von Schill]] and later [[Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow]]. The freikorps were thought to be not [[wikt:reliable|reliable]] by regular armies and were mostly used as [[guard]]s and for [[wikt:minor|minor]] [[wikt:duty|duties]]. 
 
 ==Post-World War I== 
 [[File:WWIposter9.jpg|thumb|right| < center > Recruitment poster for Freikorps Hülsen < /center > ]] 
 The [[wikt:meaning|meaning]] of the word changed over time. After 1918, the word was used for the paramilitary [[wikt:organization|organization]]s that were started in Germany by soldiers who came home after losing World War I. They were the main paramilitary groups during that time. Many of these returning soldiers were not able to return to a normal life, and joined a Freikorps to again be a part of a [[military]] [[wikt:structure|structure]]. Others were angry at losing the war and joined to fight against [[Communist]]s or get [[wikt:revenge|revenge]]. They were liked and [[wikt:support|support]]ed by Minister of Defence [[Gustav Noske]], a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], who used them to stop the [[German Revolution of 1918-19|German Revolution]] and the [[Marxist]] [[Spartacist League]], and also to murder [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] on 15 January 1919. They were also used to [[wikt:defeat|defeat]] the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. < ref > {{cite book| last = Jurado| first = Carlos Caballero| title = The German Freikorps 1918-23: 1918-23| year = 2001| publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84176-184-8 }} < /ref > 
 
 In 1920, [[Adolf Hitler]] had started his [[Politics|political]] work as the [[wikt:leader|leader]] of the very small and unknown '''German Workers Party''' (that was soon called the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]], NSDAP (or Nazi Party)) in Munich. Many people who would join this party had been in the Freikorps, including [[Ernst Röhm]], future leader of the [[Sturmabteilung]], or SA, and [[Rudolf Höß]], the future Commander of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. 
 
 [[Hermann Ehrhardt]], who started the [[Marinebrigade Ehrhardt]], and his [[wikt:deputy|deputy]] Commander, Eberhard Kautter, did not want to help Hitler and [[Erich von Ludendorff]] in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]].

 Freikorps leaders gave their old [[battle]] [[flag]]s to Hitler's [[SA]] and [[SS]] on Nov 9, 1933 in a very big [[ceremony]]. < ref > Waite, p 197 < /ref >  Historian  Robert Waite said that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps. Many of the Friekorps had joined the SA, so when the [[Night of the Long Knives]] happened, they were targets for being murdered or [[arrest]]ed and this was also done to Ehrhardt and to Röhm. Waite also says that in Hitler's 'Rohm Purge' [[wikt:speech|speech]] to the [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] on July 13, 1934, that Hitler said that the Freikorps were enemies of Germany. < ref > Waite, pg 280 - 281.

 In 1939, in the [[Polish September Campaign]], ''Freikorps Ebbinghaus'', was started to work [[wikt:behind|behind]] the [[frontline]]s. It was not very good at this work and was sent to fight as an army unit but was not good at this either and was ended in less than one year. < ref > {{cite book| last = Blanke| first = Richard| title = Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=80r6Mbnxf8IC & pg=PA229| publisher = University Press of Kentucky| isbn = 0-8131-3041-7| page = 229 }} < /ref >
