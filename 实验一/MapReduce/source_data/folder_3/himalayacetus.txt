 '''''Himalayacetus''''' is an extinct aquatic [[cetacea]]n known from fossils found in the [[Himachal Pradesh]], India. < ref > {{Paleodb|45584|Kuthar Nala (Eocene of India)}}. Retrieved June 2013 < /ref >  It lived in the remnants of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]] during the early [[Eocene]].  This extends the fossil record of whales by some 3.5 million years. < ref name= " PNAS-1998-Abst " > {{Harvnb|Bajpai|Gingerich|1998|loc=Abstract}} < /ref > 
 
 ''Himalayacetus'' lived in the coastline of the ancient [[Tethys Ocean]] before the Indian plate collided with Eurasia. It is only known from a single [[jaw]] fossil, which makes exact comparisons with other [[cetacea]]ns almost impossible. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Thewissen JGM|title=Ambulocetidae: The First Costal Whales|url=http://www.neomed.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/Thewissen/whale_origins/whales/Ambulocet.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=1 February 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130403103619/http://www.neomed.edu/DEPTS/ANAT/Thewissen/whale_origins/whales/Ambulocet.html|archivedate=2013-04-03}} < /ref >
