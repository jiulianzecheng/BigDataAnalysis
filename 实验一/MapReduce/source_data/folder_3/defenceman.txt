'''Defence''' ('''defense''' in the U.S.) in [[ice hockey]] is a player position whose main job is to stop the other team from [[Goal (ice hockey)|scoring]]. They are often called '''defencemen''', '''defensemen''', '''D''', or  " blueliners "  (a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which is boundary of the offensive zone; defencemen generally stay along the line to keep the puck in the zone). 
 
 In regular play, two defencemen play with three [[forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] and a [[goaltender]] on the ice. Exceptions include [[overtime (hockey)|overtime]] and when a team is [[shorthanded (ice hockey)|shorthanded]] (i.e. has been assessed a penalty), in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender.
