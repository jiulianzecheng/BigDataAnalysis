'''Dipole''' can mean two things in [[physics]]. The first is an ''[[electricity|electric]] dipole'' which separates the positive [[Electric charge|charge]] from the negative charge. A simple example of this dipole is a pair of [[electric charge]]s with the same [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] but with the opposite type of charge (positive and negative) and are separated by a small distance from each other. The second is a ''[[magnetism|magnetic]] dipole'', a closed circulation of [[electric current]]. A simple example is a single loop of wire with electric current flowing through it. 
 
 An important characteristic of dipoles is their dipole [[moment]], which is a [[vector]] quantity with both a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[direction]]. An example of an [[electric dipole moment]] occurring is in a pair of electric charges with opposite signs. The dipole moment would point from the negative charge towards the positive charge. The magnitude of the moment is equal to the strength of each charge [[multiplication|multiplied]] by the distance separating between the charges. An example of a [[magnetic dipole moment]] occurring is in a wire loop with flowing current. The magnetic dipole moment would point through the loop (according to the [[right hand rule]]), with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the [[area]] of the loop. 
 
 A bar [[magnet]] is an example of a magnetic dipole, with a magnetic dipole moment moving from its south pole to its north pole.
