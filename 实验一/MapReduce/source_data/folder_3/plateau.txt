 A '''plateau''' is an area of raised [[land]] that is flat on top.  
 
 The biggest and tallest plateau in the world is the [[Tibet|Tibetan Plateau]]. A plateau with a lot of [[erosion]] is called a disconnected plateau. A plateau that is also a [[volcano]] is called a volcanic plateau. Some plateaus are under the [[ocean]], like the [[Seychelles]] plateau or the Ontong Java Plateau. Plateaus are often by themselves with no other plateaus around, sometimes standing on top of mountains. Plateaus can be of three types: [[Tectonic]] Plateaus, Residual Plateaus and Volcanic Plateaus.  
 
 The [[plural]] of 'plateau' is ''plateaux'', or ''plateaus''.
