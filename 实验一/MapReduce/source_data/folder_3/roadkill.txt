 '''Roadkill''' is any animal that has died on a road because it was hit by a vehicle, for example a [[deer]] hit by a car.  Vehicles pulled by animals, for example [[mule]] carts, did make roadkill, but there was much more roadkill after the invention of the [[automobile]]. < ref name=Vox > {{cite news|author=Joseph Stromberg|access-date=September 14, 2020|title=6 things scientists have learned from studying roadkill|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/3/23/8266571/roadkill-science|date=March 23, 2015|publisher=Vox}} < /ref > 
 
 In the United States alone, one to two million large animals are killed as roadkill every year and many more small animals. < ref name=Sciam > {{cite news|publisher=Scientific American|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/roadkill-endangers-endangered-wildlife/|date=May 16, 2013|author=Melissa Gaskill|access-date=September 16, 2020|title=Rise in Roadkill Requires New Solutions}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Causes and costs== 
 [[File:Squashed frog, Wells - geograph.org.uk - 1730811.jpg|thumb|right|A roadkilled frog.]] 
 Most roadkill is caused by cars or trucks. 
 
 If the car hits a large animal, for example a deer or [[elk]], it is likely to be damaged.  In the United States alone, crashes with deer cause $3.6 billion in damage to cars and other vehicles, 200 deaths each year and many injuries. < ref name=Sciam / > 
 
 ==Uses== 
 
 Some roadkilled animals are sent to [[landfill]]s with other garbage, but other bodies are used for scientific experiments, turned into [[cosmetics|makeup]] or turned into food for other animals.  Some people cook and eat roadkill.  Other people make the fur into clothes or other useful things. < ref name=BBC > {{cite news|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-47884992|title=Roadkill: What happens to animals that die on our roads?|date=April 27, 2019|author=David Wilson|access-date=September 14, 2020}} < /ref >  Some scientists have studied roadkill to see where [[invasive species]] have come. < ref name=Vox / > 
 
 In Alaska, all roadkill belongs to the state.  Officers collect the roadkill, bring it to [[butcher]]s, and bring the meat to charities.  In other parts of the United States and in other countries, individual people can get permission to collect roadkill in different ways. < ref name=FSN > {{cite news|title=Wild and Free, But Is Roadkill Safe to Eat?|author1=Amy Halloran|url=https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/04/roadkill-and-food-safety/|date=April 18, 2011|publisher=Food Safety News|access-date=September 14, 2020}} < /ref > < ref name=Noor > {{cite news|author1=Poppy Noor|publisher=Guardian|title=How to eat roadkill: everything you need to know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/15/how-to-eat-roadkill-everything-you-need-to-know|date=October 19, 2019|access-date=September 14, 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Preventing roadkill==

 Many governments put up road signs such as  " [[deer crossing]] "  or  " [[panther]] crossing "  signs to tell drivers that there may be animals nearby.  Some build [[fence]]s around roads where cars drive at high speeds.  However, then the animals try to cross at the ends of the fences, and they are hit by cars in those places. < ref name=Sciam / >

 Planning new roads so that wild animals can go over or under them from the start is another very good way to prevent roadkill. < ref name=Sciam / > 
 
 Some governments have built wildlife bridges over or underpasses under roads that were already there.  In 2009, the local Department of Transportation built fences leading to four culverts on U.S. highway 27, and there were suddenly no roadkilled turtles. < ref name=Sciam / >
