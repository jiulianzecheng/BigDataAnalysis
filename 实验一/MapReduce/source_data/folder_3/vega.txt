 '''Vega''' (α Lyr, α Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae) is the brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Lyra]]. It is the [[list of brightest stars|fifth brightest star]] in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern [[Celestial sphere|celestial hemisphere]], after [[Arcturus]]. At only 25 [[light-years]] from Earth, it is a relatively close star and one of the most luminous stars in the [[Sun]]'s neighborhood. 
 
 Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers: this led it to be called  " arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun " . < ref > Gulliver, Austin F; Hill, Graham  &  Adelman, Saul J. 1994.

 Vega was the [[North Star|northern]] [[pole star]] around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727. < ref name=stellarium >  Calculation by the Stellarium application version 0.10.2 [http://www.stellarium.org/] < /ref >  Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through [[parallax]] measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the astronomical brightness scale. 
 
 Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as [[mass]]ive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun. Both stars are at present near the midpoint of their life expectancies.  
 
 Vega has not much of the elements heavier than [[helium]]. < ref >  Kinman T.  &  Castelli F. 2000. The determination of Teff for metal-poor A-type stars using V and 2MASS J, H and K magnitudes.

This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's [[photosphere]] that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles. < ref > Peterson D.M. ''et al'' 1999. Vega is a rapidly rotating star. ''Nature'' '''440''' (7086): 896–899.

 Based on an observed excess emission of [[infrared]] radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting disk of debris, similar to the [[Kuiper belt]] in the [[Solar System]]. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars. Irregularities in Vega's disk also suggest the presence of at least one planet, likely to be about the size of [[Jupiter]]. < ref >  Fernie J.D. 1981. On the variability of Vega.
