 '''Taste''' is one of the [[sensory system|senses]] experienced by [[human|humans]] and other [[animal|animals]]. It is felt by the [[tongue]] while eating, and is used to sense the [[flavor]] of [[food]] that is in the [[mouth]]. Humans can sense five tastes: sweet, sour, [[Bitterness|bitter]], salty, and [[umami]]. 
 
 Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the [[tongue]] and the [[epiglottis]]. < ref name= " Witt " > {{cite book | last=Witt | first=Martin | title=Smell and taste | chapter=Anatomy and development of the human taste system | journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume=164 | year=2019 | isbn=978-0-444-63855-7 | issn=0072-9752 | pmid=31604544 | doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-63855-7.00010-1 | pages=147–171| s2cid=204332286 }} < /ref > < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=dNhFLnc6NRkC & dq=taste+bud+concentrated & pg=PA201 Human biology (page 201/464)] Daniel D.

 == Basic tastes == 
 === Bitterness === 
 [[File:Bittermelonfruit.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Bitter melons are very bitter in taste.]] 
 
 Many common foods are bitter, like [[coffee]], bitter [[melon]], [[Olive (fruit)|olives]] and [[citrus]] peel. 
 
 [[Bitterness]] is of interest to those who study [[evolution]], as well as various health researchers. < ref name=Guyton > Guyton, Arthur C. 1991. Textbook of medical physiology. 8th ed, Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders. < /ref > < ref name= " psychologyofeating & drinking " > Logue A.W. 1986. ''The psychology of eating and drinking''. New York: Freeman. < /ref >  Many naturally bitter compounds are [[toxic]]. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds may have a protective function, but some test have not confirmed this. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Glendinning J.I. |title=Is the bitter rejection response always adaptive? |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_physiology-behavior_1994-12_56_6/page/1217 |journal=Physiol Behav |volume=56 |year=1994 |pages=1217–1227 |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90369-7 |pmid=7878094 |issue=6 |s2cid=22945002 }} < /ref >  Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, and among leaf-eating [[primate]]s there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves. Young leaves tend to be higher in [[protein]] and lower in [[fiber]] and [[poison]]s than mature leaves. < ref name= "  encylopediahumanevolution " > Jones S; Martin R.  &  Pilbeam D. 1994. ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution''. Cambridge University Press < /ref >  Amongst humans, various [[food processing]] techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable. < ref > Johns T. 1990. ''With bitter herbs they shall eat it: chemical ecology and the origins of human diet and medicine''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. < /ref > 
 
 Animals which eat a lot of bitter plant material, such as [[browser]]s do have ways of dealing with it.  They produce [[tannin]]-binding proteins, which other animals do not.  Tannins are bitter compounds common in material from trees and bushes, though not [[grass]]. 
 
 === Saltiness === 
 Saltiness is felt when there is [[sodium]] in the food.  A common [[spice]] that is salty is common [[salt]], [[sodium chloride]]. 
 
 === Savouriness === 
 Savouriness (or savoriness) is the taste of [[wikt:savory|savoury]] foods. It is also known by the Japanese word {{nihongo|'''Umami'''|旨味, うまみ}}, and comes from umai, which means 'yummy'. This taste was known for a long time, but only became an official scientific term in 1985. < ref > Kawamura Y. and M.R. Kare (eds) 1987. ''Umami: a basic taste''. Marcel Dekker. < /ref > 
 
 To taste savoriness, your tongue has special parts that detect [[amino acids]] that are in [[food]]s like [[meat]]s and [[cheese]]s. < ref > {{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | title=New Seasonings | journal=Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo |year=1909 | volume=30 | pages= 820–836}} [in japanese] < /ref > 
 
 === Sourness === 
 Sourness is tasted when [[acid]]s are on your tongue. Many foods have acid in them and are sour, like [[lemon]]s and [[vinegar]]. 
 
 === Sweetness === 
 Sweetness is a taste felt when [[sugar]]s are in the food. Most people consider sweetness to be a [[wikt:pleasant|pleasant]] taste. 
 
 == Taste-related == 
 === Spicy/hot === 
 This sensation is not a special sense of taste because it does not have specific taste buds. It is a complex sensation. 
 
 Substances such as ethanol and [[capsaicin]] cause a burning sensation called chemesthesis, piquance, spiciness, hotness, or prickliness. Two main sources of  this sensation are capsaicin from [[Chili pepper|chili peppers]] and piperine from [[black pepper]]. 
 
 Foods like [[chili pepper]]s activate nerve fibers directly giving the sensation of  " hot " . Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, surface of the eye ([[cornea]]) or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat or sometimes pain, when exposed to such chemicals. 
 
 === Other sensations === 
 The tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the [[somatosensory system]]. 
 
 Also, it is known that [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[sight]] contribute to the overall sensation of eating and drinking. The temperature of food makes a difference to its appreciation. 
 
 The strange coolness of [[spearmint]], [[menthol]] and [[camphor]] is caused by their molecules triggering a sensory system which normally works to sense low temperatures. 
 
 There is still much to learn about the taste system. Consider, for example, the tastes of [[ginger]] and [[horseradish]].
