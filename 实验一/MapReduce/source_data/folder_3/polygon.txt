 A '''polygon''' is a closed [[two-dimensional]] [[shape]]. It is a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] figure that is made up of a number of sides. These are also called edges or [[Line segment|line segments]]. Each side is connected to another one by a corner, or [[vertex]]. Each pair of connected sides makes an [[angle]]. 
 
 These sides and angles can be different from one another, or they can all be the same. Polygons made of only sides of the same length (equilateral) and angles the same width (equiangular) are called [[Regular polygon|regular polygons]]. 
 
 A [[square (geometry)|square]] is a polygon because it has four sides. The smallest polygon in [[Euclidean geometry]] or  " flat geometry "  is the [[triangle]], which has three sides and three corners. On a [[sphere]], there can also be a [[digon]] and a [[henagon]]. 
 
 If the edge lines of the polygon do not cross each other, the polygon is called ''simple''; otherwise it is ''complex''. 
 
 In [[computer graphics]], polygons (especially triangles) are often used to make graphics.
