 '''TempleOS''' is a [[Bible|biblical]] [[operating system]] (OS). It was designed to be the [[Third Temple]] prophesied in the Bible. It was created by American programmer [[Terry A. Davis]]. TempleOS was written during Terry Davis's [[Mania#Signs and symptoms|manic episode]]s. He described his inspiration as a [[revelation]] from God. The features of TempleOS include a 640x480 resolution, 16-color display, and single-voice audio. Terry Davis said that these features were designed according to instructions from God. < ref name= " Vice " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wnj43x/gods-lonely-programmer|title=God's Lonely Programmer|last=Hicks|first=Jesse|date=November 25, 2014|work=[[Vice (magazine)|VICE Motherboard]]|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-date=May 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193635/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gods-lonely-programmer|url-status=live}} < /ref >  It uses a [[programming language]] called HolyC.

 After Terry Davis died, Thom Holwerda wrote:  " Davis was clearly a gifted programmer – writing an entire operating system is no small feat – and it was sad to see him affected by his mental illness " . < ref name= " Ap145 " > {{cite web|last1=Holwerda|first1=Thom|date=September 8, 2018|title=Creator of TempleOS, Terry Davis, has passed away|url=https://www.osnews.com/story/30710/creator-of-templeos-terry-davis-has-passed-away/|access-date=January 6, 2019|website=[[OSNews]]|archive-date=January 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117025950/https://www.osnews.com/story/30710/creator-of-templeos-terry-davis-has-passed-away/|url-status=live}} < /ref >  One fan described Davis as a  " programming legend " , while another, a computer engineer, compared the development of TempleOS to a one-man-built [[skyscraper]]. < ref name= " Dalles Chronicle "  / >  He added that it  " actually boggles my mind that one man wrote all that "  and that it was  " hard for a layperson to understand what a phenomenal achievement "  it is to write an entire operating system alone. < ref name= " Dalles Chronicle "  / >
