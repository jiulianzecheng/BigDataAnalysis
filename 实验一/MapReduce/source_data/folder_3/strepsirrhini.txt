 The '''Strepsirrhini''' clade is one of the two suborders of [[primate]]s, with 114 species. They are defined by their wet noses, although the Greek name means having a curved or bent nose. [[Madagascar]]'s only primates (apart from [[human]]s) are strepsirrhines, although others can be found in southeast [[Asia]]. 
 Their eyes have a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets have a ring of bone around the eye. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own [[vitamin C]], whereas haplorhine primates (and ourselves) must get it from their diets. 
 
 The suborder contains the [[lemurs]] and [[lorises]]. The modern types probably evolved from the [[Adapiforms]], an extinct group. 
 
 The origin of the earliest primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery.  Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. 
 
 Although the [[Fossil|fossil record]] of their initial [[adaptive radiation|radiation]] across the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is very detailed, < ref > Rose K.D. 2006. ''The beginning of the age of mammals''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 168/9. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8472-6}} < /ref >  the fossil record from the [[tropics]]—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other [[eutheria]]n mammals were first appearing. 
 
 So, [[Genetics|geneticists]] and primatologists have used [[sequence analysis|genetic analyses]] to determine the relatedness between primate lines and when they diverged. Using this [[molecular clock]], it seems that primates evolved more than 80–90 & nbsp;million years ago, nearly 40 & nbsp;million years before the first primates appear in the fossil record. < ref > Hartwig, W.C.
