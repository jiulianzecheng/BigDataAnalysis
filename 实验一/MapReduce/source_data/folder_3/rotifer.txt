 The '''rotifers''' are a [[phylum]] of tiny animals which are common in [[freshwater]] environments, such as ponds and puddles. < ref > There are a few saltwater species. < /ref >  Some rotifers are free swimming, others move by inching along, and some are fixed. < ref > They live inside tubes or gelatinous holdfasts that are attached to a substrate < /ref >  A few species live in colonies. < ref > Clément P. and Wurdak E. 1991.

 == History and taxonomy == 
 Rotifers were first described when early microscopes became available, around 1700 < small > AD < /small > . < ref name= " cambridge1896 " > {{cite book | title = The Cambridge Natural History | author = Harmer, Sidney Frederic and Shipley, Arthur Everett | year = 1896 | publisher = Macmillan, London. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bvoEAAAAYAAJ & dq=%22john+harris%22+rotifer & pg=PA197 }} < /ref >  They are an important part of the freshwater zoo[[plankton]]. Also, many species help decompose organic matter in [[soil]]. Rotifers eat fish waste, dead [[bacteria]], and [[algae]]. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. A rotifer [[filter]]s 100,000 times its own volume of water per hour. They are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter. 
 
 About 2200 [[species]] of rotifers have been described. They are placed in the phylum Rotifera. This phylum is subdivided into three [[class (biology)|classes]], ''Monogononta'', ''Bdelloidea'', and ''Seisonidea''. The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. < ref > Ricci, Claudia  &  Melone, Guilio 2000.

 == Appearance == 
 [[File:Habrotrocha rosa 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Habrotrocha rosa'', a bdelloid rotifer that lives only within the pitcher leaves of ''Sarracenia purpurea''.]] 
 The front has a ring of [[cilia]] circling the mouth. This gave the rotifers their old name of  " wheel animalules " . There is a protective ''lorica'' round its body, and a foot. Inside the lorica are the usual organs in miniturised form: a brain, an eye-spot, jaws, stomach, kidneys, urinary bladder. 
 
 Rotifers have a number of unusual features. Biologists suppose that these peculiarities are [[adaptation]]s to their small size and the transient (fast changing) nature of its [[habitat]]s. 
 
 == Resisting drought == 
 Rotifers are specialists at living in [[habitat]]s where water dries up regularly.  
 
 The Monogononta, which have males, produce fertilised 'resting eggs' which can resist desiccation ([[drought]]) for long periods. < ref > Örstan A. 1995. Desiccation survival of the eggs of the rotifer ''Adineta vaga'' (Davis 1873). ''Hydrobiologia'' '''313/314''':373-375 < /ref >   
 
 The Bdelloids, who have no males, contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water, a process known as ''cryptobiosis''. Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods: the longest well-documented dormancy is nine years. After they have dried, they may be revived by adding water. In this, and several other ways, they are a unique group of animals. < ref > Kirk, Kevin L. et al. 1999. Physiological responses to variable environments: storage and respiration in starving rotifers. ''Freshwater Biology'' '''42''' 637-644. < /ref > 
 
 == Cell number == 
 [[File:Rotifer animation.gif|thumb|left|180px]] 
 Rotifers are hatched with a standard number of [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]], exactly the same number for every rotifer in a [[species]]. This is called ''[[eutely]]''. No [[cell division]] whatsoever takes place during adult life. < ref > Their eggs are already present in the adult rotifer. < /ref >  Not only that, but the number of nuclei in each tissue is constant. Furthermore, most of the nuclei do not have cell walls: rotifer tissue is largely or wholly a [[syncytium]]. < ref name= " shimek " / > 
 
 === Resisting radiation === 
 The absence of cell division is probably one reason they are extraordinarily resistant to ionising [[radiation]]. Also, repairing [[DNA]] is one of the things they are known to do after desiccation. < ref > E. Gladyshev and M. Meselson. Extreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to ionizing radiation. ''Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci''., 10.1073/pnas.0800966105 (published online 3/24/08)

 == Bdelloid rotifers == 
 === Parthenogenesis === 
 In one of the classes, the freshwater Bdelloid rotifers, ''no males have ever been seen''. It is the largest group of wholly [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]] species in the [[Animalia]].  
 
 The females in this group produce eggs by parthenogenesis (virgin birth). In some species these eggs develop into small juveniles before they are released from their parent. The offspring are ''[[clone]]s'' of their mother.  
 
 [[Cytology|Cytological]] and molecular [[genetic]] studies show that bdelloids evolved from a common ancestor which lost sexual [[recombination]] ([[meiosis]] and [[fertilisation]]) about 100 million years ago. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://jbpc.mbl.edu/research-markwelch.html |title=Welch, Mark |access-date=2009-12-30 |archive-date=2010-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528142733/http://jbpc.mbl.edu/research-markwelch.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Research has also been done on the implications of parthenogenesis for [[speciation]]. < ref > Fontaneto D. ''et al.'' 2007. Independently evolving species in asexual Bdelloid rotifers. PLoS [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0050087] < /ref > 
 
 === Genetics === 
 Bdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more non-identical copies of each [[gene]]. This suggests their asexual reproduction is of long standing. < ref > Welch J.L.M. Welch D.B.M and Meselson M. 2004. Cytogenic evidence for asexual evolution of bdelloid rotifers. ''PNAS'' '''101''' pp1618–1621 < /ref >  For example, there are four copies of gene ''hsp82''. Each is different and on a different [[chromosome]]. This cannot be explaned by normal [[Mutation|gene duplication]], which produces two or more near-identical genes next to each other. By contrast, in a monogont rotifer, most genes were single-copy. < ref > Suga K ''et al''. Analysis of expressed sequence tags of the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer ''Brachionus plicatilis''.  PLOS One [http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000671] < /ref >    
 
 There are genes in bdelloid rotifers that seem to have come from [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[plant]]s. This suggests they arrived by [[horizontal gene transfer]] (HGT). The capture and use of exogenous (~foreign)  genes seems to be important in bdelloid evolution. < ref > Gladyshev E.A. Meselson M.  &  Arkhipova I.R. 2008. Massive [[horizontal gene transfer]] in Bdelloid rotifers. ''Science'' '''320''', pp1210 - 1213 < /ref > < ref > Arkhipova I.R. and Meselson M. 2005. Diverse DNA transposons in rotifers of the class Bdelloidea. ''PNAS'' '''102''': 11781-11786 < /ref >  The team led by Matthew S. Meselson at [[Harvard University]] showed that, despite the lack of [[sexual reproduction]], bdelloid rotifers do engage in genetic ([[DNA]]) transfer within a [[species]] or [[clade]]. The method used is not known at present. Bdelloid rotifers currently hold the 'record' for HGT in animals with ~8% of their genes from bacterial origins. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/evolution/2012/11/bdelloids-surviving-borrowed-dna|title=Bdelloids surviving on borrowed DNA|author= Traci Watson|date= 2012|publisher=Science/AAAS News}} < /ref > 
 
 == The Acanthocephala == 
 The [[Acanthocephala]], a group of [[parasite|parasitic]] worms previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been shown to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to the normal, freeliving, members of the phylum is not resolved. < ref name= " shimek " > {{cite web | url = http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2006-01/rs/index.php | author = Shimek, Ronald 2006 | title = Nano-Animals, Part I: Rotifers | publisher = Reefkeeping.com }} < /ref >
