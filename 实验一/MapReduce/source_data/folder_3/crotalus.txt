 '''''Crotalus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Venom (poison)|venomous]] [[Crotalinae|pit vipers]] found only in the [[Americas]] from southern [[Canada]] to northern [[Argentina]]. The name comes from the Greek word krotalon, which means  " rattle " , referring to the rattle on the end of the tail. There are currently 29 species recognized. 
 
 ==Description== 
 Members of this genus range in size from only 50–60 & nbsp;cm to over 150 & nbsp;cm. Adult males are slightly larger than females. Compared to most snakes they are heavy-bodied, although some [[African viper]]s are much thicker. They are recognized by the rattle on their tail though some species do not have tails. 
 
 ==Feeding== 
 Small species eat mainly [[lizard]]s, while larger species first eat lizards when young, then start eating [[mammal]]s when they become adults, like [[rabbit]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s, [[Pocket gopher|gophers]], [[rat]]s and [[mice]], some also eat [[bird]]s, other [[snake]]s and [[amphibian]]s. 
 
 ==Predators== 
 Humans are a threat to ''Crotalus'', but other snakes like the [[Kingsnake]], the [[Coachwhip]], the [[Indigo Snake]] and the [[Racer]] are also threats. Birds like the [[hawk]], the [[eagle]], the [[owl]], the [[raven]] and the [[roadrunner]], and mammals like the [[coyote]], the [[fox]], the [[wildcat]], the [[badger]] and the [[skunk]] are also threats 
 
 ==Venom== 
 Almost all ''Crotalus'' venoms are [[hemotoxic]], meaning that the venom destroys [[red blood cell]]s, stops [[blood clotting]],and damages [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. Hemotoxic is very painful, and people who are bitten by a snake with hemotoxic don't always make a full recovery. Some species like Crotalus Scutalatus and Crotalus Tigris have a nuerotoxic venom, while neurotoxins are less painful they kill more quicker. Neurotoxins are also found in the venom of Cobras and mambas. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus Adamanteus) in some parts of its range may have a nuerotoxin in their venom as well as a hemotoxins.
