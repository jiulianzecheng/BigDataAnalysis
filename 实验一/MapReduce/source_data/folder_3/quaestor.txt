A '''{{lang|la|quaestor}}''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|w|iː|s|t|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|s|t|ər}}) was a public official in [[Ancient Rome]]. A quaestor did different jobs at different times in Roman history. In the [[Roman Kingdom]], quaestors were appointed by the king to investigate [[murder]]s. In the [[Roman Republic]], quaestors supervised the state treasury and conducted [[audit]]s. It was the lowest ranking position in the public service. Because of this many people wanting to become politicians became quaestors as a first step in their career. In the [[Roman Empire]], quaestors were at first relaced by the ''{{lang|la|[[praefectus]]}}'' (prefect). Later quaestors became a position appointed by the emperor to lead the imperial council and deal with [[petition]]ers. < ref > {{citation|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|chapter-url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/quaestor-ancient-Roman-official|year=2016|author=((The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica))|chapter=Quaestor: Ancient Roman Official|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|access-date=1 August 2016}} < /ref > 
 
 In modern [[Italy]] and [[Romania]], a quaestor is a senior ranking officer on the [[police force]]. In some organizations, a quaestor is in charge of the finances, similar to a [[treasurer]] in other organizations.
