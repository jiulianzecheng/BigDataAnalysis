 ===2013-2015: Creation through Sixteen and debut mini album=== 
 On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment announced that they would create a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first all girl group to come out of the company since [[Miss A]] in 2010. On February 27, 2014, JYP trainees Lena and Cecila were confirmed as members of the group called 6mix, while other rumored members included Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Minyoung. The group was eventually cancelled when Lena and Cecilia left the company. < ref > {{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7557591/twice-k-pop-ten-facts-girl-group|title=10 Must-Know Facts About K-pop Darlings TWICE|magazine=Billboard|access-date=2019-08-28}} < /ref > 
 
 In February, [[Parin Jin-young|Park Jin-young]] announced the lineup of the upcoming girl group would feature seven members and be decided through Sixteen, a television competition show that would air on [[Mnet]] later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun and Chaeyoung as the seven Twice members. Later, Park decided to add two more girls into the group, making Twice a nine member group by adding Tzuyu, who was added as the audience favorite due to bring the most popular contestant by the end of the show and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. Momo had already been eliminated a few episodes before the finale, so the decision was disliked by some fans. 
 
 On October 7, 2015 the group's official website was created and their first extended play (EP), '[[The Story Begins]]', would be released with the single  " '[[Like Ooh-Ahh]]' "  which was released on October 20. On the same day as their EP's release the group performed all tracks at a live performance. The music video was watched 50 million times on [[YouTube]] within five months of it's release and became one of the most-viewed debut music videos of any K-pop group. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20160404003800315|title=TWICE's music video hits 50 million|last=정주원|date=2016-04-04|website=Yonhap News Agency|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}} < /ref >  The group performed  " Like Ooh-Ahh "  at ''[[SBS Gayo Daejeon]]'' at the end of 2015.
