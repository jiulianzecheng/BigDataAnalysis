 The '''Baconator''' is a [[sandwich]] made by [[Wendy's]] restaurants. It has two beef patties, two slices of [[American cheese]], six strips of [[bacon]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[ketchup]] on a [[bun]]. It was introduced in April 2007. In 2009, Wendy's started offering two other versions of the Baconator: the Baconator Single (one patty) and the Baconator Triple (three patties). The original version is now called the Baconator Double. Wendyâ€™s also has Baconator Fries, Baconator Breakfast, and Son of Baconator. The last one on that list is a smaller version of the same sandwich.
