'''Anosmia''' is losing the [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. The word is also used for people who never had this sense. The loss can be temporary, or permanent. The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include: 
 *Upper respiratory tract [[infection]], for example a [[common cold]] 
 *Blocking the nose, for example through seasonal [[allergy|allergies]], or a [[nasal polyp]]. 
 *[[Side-effect]]s of certain [[drug]]s or of certain [[poison]]s. 
 *[[Concussion]], [[brain tumor]]s. 
 
 Smelling things depends on two [[nerve]]s ([[Nervus olfactorius]] and [[Nervus trigeminus]]), as well as the part of the [[brain]] which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of small. 
 
 There are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem. 
 
 The sense of smell also affects the sense of [[taste]]. People who cannot small smell have only the basic tastes: [[Taste#Sweetness|sweet]], [[sour]], [[bitter]], [[salt]]y, and [[umami]]. 
 
 Note also that the sense of smell changes with age. < ref name= " " > {{cite journal |pages=1441–3 |doi=10.1126/science.6505700 |title=Smell identification ability: Changes with age |year=1984 |last1=Doty |first1=R. |last2=Shaman |first2=P |last3=Applebaum |first3=S. |last4=Giberson |first4=R |last5=Siksorski |first5=L |last6=Rosenberg |first6=L |journal=Science |volume=226 |issue=4681 |pmid=6505700}} < /ref >  Anosmia can also point to different [[neurology|neurological conditions]] such as [[Parkinson's disease]], < ref name= " Doty1988 " > {{cite journal |pmid=3399075 |year=1988 |last1=Doty |first1=RL |last2=Deems |first2=DA |last3=Stellar |first3=S |title=Olfactory dysfunction in parkinsonism: A general deficit unrelated to neurologic signs, disease stage, or disease duration |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1237–44 |journal=Neurology |doi=10.1212/WNL.38.8.1237|s2cid=3009692 }} < /ref >

 In general, anosmia which has its cause in the brain cannot be treated. Anosmia which is caused by blocking the nose can be treated by removing the block. In some cases, [[accupuncture]] was successfully used to treat anosmia. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Michael W | year = 2003 | title = Anosmia treated with acupuncture | url = | journal = Acupuncture in Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 153–154 | doi = 10.1136/aim.21.4.153 | pmid = 14740813 | s2cid = 9117779 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Anosmia Causes == 
 Nasal congestion from a cold, allergy, sinus infection, or poor air quality is the most common cause of anosmia. Other anosmia causes include: < ref > {{Cite web|title=Anosmia: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments|url=https://www.webmd.com/brain/anosmia-loss-of-smell|access-date=2021-07-02|website=WebMD|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 * Nasal polyps -- small noncancerous growths in the nose and sinuses that block the nasal passage. 
 * Injury to the nose and smell nerves from surgery or head trauma. 
 * Exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides or solvents.  
 * Certain medications, including antibiotics, antidepressants, anti-inflammatory medication, heart medications, and others. 
 * Cocaine abuse. 
 * Certain medical conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, nutritional deficiencies, congenital conditions, and hormonal disturbances.
