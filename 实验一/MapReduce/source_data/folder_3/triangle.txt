 A '''triangle''' is a [[shape]], or a part of [[2D|two dimensional]] [[Space (physics)|space]]. It has [[3 (number)|three]] straight [[side]]s and three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. The three [[angle]]s of a triangle always add up to 180째 (180 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]). It is the [[polygon]] with the least possible number of sides. A triangle with vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' is written as  < math > \triangle ABC < /math > . < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Triangle|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Triangle.html|access-date=2020-09-01|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref >  The study of geometry related to triangles is called [[trigonometry]]. Modern [[computer]]s usually use triangles to make more complex [[graphic]] images or shapes. 
 
 == Types of triangles == 
 [[File:Isosceles-right-triangle.jpg|thumb|This is an ''isosceles right triangle'', because it has a right angle and two of its sides have the same length.]] 
 Triangles can be grouped according to how many of their sides are equal: < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Triangles - Equilateral, Isosceles and Scalene|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html|access-date=2020-09-01|website=www.mathsisfun.com}} < /ref > 
 * if all the three sides of a triangle have the same length, then it is an '''[[equilateral triangle]]'''. 
 * if a triangle has two sides with the same length, then it is an '''[[isosceles triangle]]'''. 
 * if all the three sides of a triangle have different lengths, then we have a '''scalene triangle'''. 
 Triangles can also be grouped by their angles: < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 * if a triangle has a [[right angle]], that is, if one of the angles of that triangle measures 90째 (90 degrees), then it is a '''[[right triangle]]'''. The opposite side to the right angle is the [[hypotenuse]]. 
 * if a triangle has an [[obtuse angle]], that is, if one of the angles of that triangle is larger than 90째, then it is an '''obtuse triangle'''. 
 * if a triangle has only [[Acute angle|acute angles]], that is, if all the angles of that triangle are less than 90째, then it is an '''acute triangle'''.

 == Area == 
 [[File:Triangle (acute) bh.PNG|thumb|''b'' is base and ''h'' is height]] 
 The [[area]] of a triangle is equal to base times height times one half. 
 
 < math > area= \frac{base \times height}{2} < /math >
