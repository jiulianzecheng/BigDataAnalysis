 '''Baiern''' is a community in the district of [[Ebersberg (district)|Ebersberg]], [[Upper Bavaria]], Germany. It is a member of the administrative community (''Verwaltungsgemeinschaft'') of [[Glonn]]. 
 
 The community's name is pronounced the same way as the German name for Bavaria ( " Bayern " ), although it is spelt differently. This is most likely originated from the old way of spelling Bavaria in German ( " Baiern " ). 
 
 The constituent communities of Antholing, Berganger and Netterndorf are to be found within Baiern, as is the ''Jugenddorf Piusheim'' ( " Youth Village of Piusheim " ). 
 
 ==Geography==
