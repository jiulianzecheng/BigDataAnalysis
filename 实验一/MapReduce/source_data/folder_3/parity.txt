 In physics, '''parity''' is a transformation in which the [[Chirality|mirror image]] of a system (meaning [[experiment]]) is considered.  If the system behaves in the mirror image as it normally would, it is said to respect parity symmetry, usually shortened to  " P symmetry. "    Most types of physics respects P symmetry.  One type of interaction that often does not respect this symmetry is the [[weak interaction]].
