 '''Synapsids''' are one of the two major groups of [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]] which evolved from basal [[Amniote|amniotes]].  
 
 'Synapsids' means 'fused arch', and refers to their skulls. The group includes [[mammals]] and earlier groups related to mammals. They were originally called  " mammal-like reptiles " , which is a bit confusing. 
 
 Synapsids are one of the two major groups of [[amniote]]s.  Both groups evolved from early amniotes about 345 million years ago during the early or mid [[Carboniferous]] period. The other is the [[Sauropsid|sauropsids]], the group which includes [[Reptile|reptiles]] and [[Bird|birds]]. < ref > {{cite web |author1=Laurin, Michel |author2=Reisz, Robert R. |year=2011 |title=Synapsida: Mammals and their extinct relatives |edition=Version & nbsp;14 |publisher=The Tree of Life Web Project |url=http://tolweb.org/Synapsida/14845 |access-date=2023-01-28 |archive-date=2012-12-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207131908/http://tolweb.org/Synapsida/14845 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 Synapsids include the [[Pelycosaur]]ia ([[Pennsylvanian]] to [[Permian]]), and the [[Therapsid]]a (Lower [[Permian]] to present). 
 
 The pelycosaurs were dominant on land in the Permian, and many species became extinct at the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]]. < ref > A few relics survived into the Lower Triassic. < /ref >  The therapsids were still dominant on land in the Lower [[Triassic]], but by the [[Upper Triassic]] the [[dinosaur]]s had taken over. 
 
 == Primitive and advanced synapsids == 
 Synapsids have a primitive group and an advanced group. These are known, respectively, as [[pelycosaur]]s and [[therapsid]]s. Pelycosaurs are a [[paraphyletic]] group of six primitive families of synapsids. < ref name=Bent > Benton, Michael J. 2005. ''Vertebrate paleontology''. 3rd ed, Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|0-632-05637-1}} < /ref > < sup > 120 < /sup >  They were all rather lizard-like with sprawling gait and possibly horny [[scutes]].  
 
 The therapsids are the more advanced synapsids. They have a more erect posture (way of standing) and maybe hair, at least in some forms. < ref > McLaughlin J.C. 1980. ''Synapsida: a new look into the origin of mammals''. Viking, New York. ISBN 0-670-68922-X. < /ref >  They are the ancestors of mammals. So each of the two synapsid groups represent [[evolutionary grade]]s: the pelycosaurs have given rise to the therapsids, who in their turn have given rise to the mammals. 
 
 == Mammals and reptiles == 
 The therapsids ('beast face') used to be called [[mammal-like reptile]]s. This was a mistake, because they were never reptiles. The split between Synapsids and [[Sauropsid]]s (the group which gave rise to reptiles) took place long before therapsids evolved. < ref > Kemp T.S. 1995. ''The origin and evolution of mammals''. Oxford University Press, p18 et seq. ISBN 0-19-850761-5 < /ref > 
 
 There are a number of characteristics which cannot be seen on [[fossil]]s, but which are of great importance. Mammals are distinguished from reptiles by fundamental differences in the development of the blood system. < ref name=Good > Goodrich E.S. 1930. ''Studies on the structure and development of vertebrates''. Macmillan, London. < /ref > < ref name=KK > Kermack D.M.  &  K.A. 1984. ''The evolution of mammalian characters''. Croom Helm, London. p6/7 {{ISBN|0709915349}} < /ref >  These differences are such that it would be almost impossible for mammals to be derived from reptiles. 
 : " It is clearly quite impossible for the condition found in birds and modern reptiles to have arisen from that found in mammals or vice versa " . Kermack. < ref name=KK/ > < sup > 6 < /sup > 
 This supports the division of amniotes into the Sauropsida and the Synapsida. 
 
 == Synapsid skull == 
 === Temporal openings === 
 [[Image:Skull synapsida 1.svg|thumb|right|200px|The synapsids have a single hole behind each eye, on the lower part of the skull.]] 
 
 Synapsids evolved a fenestra (hole) behind each eye orbit. It allows better attachment sites for [[jaw]] muscles than the original [[anapsid]] condition. 
 
 A parallel development took place in the [[diapsida]], who evolved two rather than one opening behind each eye. 
 
 Originally, the opening in the skull left the inner cranium only covered by the jaw muscles, but in higher [[therapsid]]s and [[mammal]]s the [[sphenoid]] bone has expanded to close the opening. 
 
 === Teeth === 
 [[File:Eothyris head.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Eothyris'', an early synapsid with multiple canines.]] 
 Synapsids had differentiated teeth. These include the [[canine]]s, [[molar]]s, and [[incisor]]s. 
 
 The trend towards differentiation is found in some [[labyrinthodont]]s and early [[anapsida|anapsid]] reptilians. They have enlarged first teeth on the [[maxilla]], forming a form of proto-canines. This trait was subsequently lost in the [[sauropsid]] line, but developed further in the synapsids. Early synapsids could have 2 or even 3 enlarged 'canines', but in the therapsids, the pattern had settled to one canine in each upper jaw half. The lower canines developed later. 
 
 ==Taxonomy== 
 Note: in evolutionary terms, the mammals are entirely within the Synapsida. Their status as a separate class is traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy]]: as a [[clade]] they are a sub-group of the Therapsida.
