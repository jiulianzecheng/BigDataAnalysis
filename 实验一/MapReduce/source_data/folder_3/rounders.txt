{{For|the movie|Rounders (film)}} 
 '''Rounders'''  is a [[sport]] which originated in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. The game is regulated by the ''Gaelic Athletic Association'' (GAA) in Ireland and the ''National Rounders Association'' (NRA) in the UK.  Both have different, although broadly similar, game-play and culture.  Competitions are held between teams from both traditions, often with one version being played in the morning and the other being played in the afternoon. 
 
 Game-play centers around [[innings]] where teams act at turns being [[Batter (baseball)|batters]] and fielders.  A maximum of nine players are allowed to play in fielding positions at one time. Points ( " rounders " ) are scored by the batting team by completing a circuit around the field through four bases/posts without being put 'out' - for example, by a ball they batted being 'caught-out' or touching a tagged base/post. 
 
 The earliest nationally formalised rules of play were devised by the GAA in Ireland in 1884.  
 
 Although it is generally considered a school game, rounders is played at international level as well. Currently, teams from [[Canada]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] compete against each other.  
 Some theories on the origin of [[baseball]] claim that baseball is based on rounders. Rounders is a sport played with a bat and ball when the ball is thrown to you the ball is meant to be hit with the bat.
