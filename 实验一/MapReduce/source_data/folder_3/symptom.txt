'''Symptoms''' are used in [[diagnosis]]. The term is used in [[medicine]], and in other fields such as fault-finding in [[engineering]].  
 
 In medicine, it refers to things the [[patient]] feels or notices. It contrasts with [[signs]], which are changes which a doctor sees in a patient. What a patient feels is [[wikt:subjective|subjective]], whereas what a doctor sees is [[wikt:objective|objective]]. 
 
 In diagnosis, all symptoms and signs are brought together to make a [[hypothesis]] as to what is going wrong. This might suggest further investigation or treatment. A complete investigation ends with a diagnosis that summarizes all this.
