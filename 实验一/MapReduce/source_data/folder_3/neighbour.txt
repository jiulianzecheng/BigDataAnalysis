 A '''Neighbour''' (or '''neighbor''' in [[American English]]) is a [[person]] who lives nearby, normally in a house or apartment that is next door or, in the case of houses, across the [[street]]. Some people form [[friend]]ships with their neighbours, and help them by sharing their tools and helping with [[gardening]] tasks. Other people become frustrated with their neighbours, if the neighbour makes a lot of [[noise]] or a [[garbage|mess]] 
 
 A group of people living close together in a small community is called a [[neighbourhood]]. Some neighbourhoods have many [[community]] organizations, where people [[volunteer]] and do [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] activities. Other neighbourhoods in [[poverty|poor]] communities may have no community organizations, and there may be many problems in the community, such as [[illegal drugs]], [[prostitution]], and [[homelessness]].
