 '''Leptin''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] λεπτός ''leptos'',  " thin "  or  " light "  or  " small " ) is a [[hormone]] made by cells in [[adipose tissue|fat tissue]] that reduces [[hunger]]. That helps the energy balance in the body.  
 
 Leptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone [[ghrelin]], the  " hunger hormone " .  Both hormones act on receptors in the  [[hypothalamus]]. They adjust appetite to get energy [[homeostasis]]. < ref name= " pmid16932309 " >  Brennan A.M.  &  Mantzoros C.S. 2006.

 In [[obesity]], a [[Hypoleptinemia|decreased sensitivity to leptin]] comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores. < ref > Pan H; Guo J.  &  Su Z. 2014. Advances in understanding the interrelations between leptin resistance and obesity. ''Physiology  &  Behavior''  '''130''', 157–169.

 Although regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied. 
 
 Leptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at [[Rockefeller University]]. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in [[Western world|western society]]. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on [[mice]] in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and having quality or restful [[sleep]].
