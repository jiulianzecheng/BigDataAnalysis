 '''''Paramecium''''' is one of the best-known [[protist]]s, often taught in school [[biology]] courses. It is a [[Ciliate]] [[genus]]. Ciliates are a [[clade]] of protists which move by [[Synchronization|synchronous]] waves of tiny projections from their [[cuticle]]. These projections are called [[cilia]] (singular: ''cilium''). < ref name= " Paramecium " > [http://www.american.edu/cas/bio/faculty_media/zeller/sgs1.htm Paramacium] < /ref > < ref name= " 101science.com " > [http://www.101science.com/paramecium.htm 101 Science.com: ''Paramecium caudatum''] < /ref >  The species range from 50 to 350 μm in length. < ref > A μm is a millioneth of a metre. < /ref >  They live in freshwater ponds, and eat [[bacteria]], and other protists such as single-celled [[algae]]. 
 
 Paramecium species usually have [[bacteria]]l [[Symbiosis|symbionts]], and some species have [[green alga]]l symbionts. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Reproduction in ''Paramecium'' has been researched for many years. ''Paramecium'' has two [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] (a large macronucleus and a single compact micronucleus). < ref > [http://www.microscope-microscope.org/applications/pond-critters/protozoans/ciliphora/paramecium.htm ''Paramecium''] < /ref >  They cannot survive without the macronucleus and cannot reproduce without the micronucleus. < ref name= " Paramecium " / >  Reproduction is either by [[binary fission]] (asexual), conjugation ([[sexual reproduction|sexual]]), < ref name= " Paramecium " / >  or, rarely, by ''endomixis'', a process of self-fertilisation. During [[binary fission]] a fully grown organism divides into two daughter cells. < ref name= " Paramecium " / >  Conjugation consists of the temporary union of two organisms and the exchange of micro-nuclear elements. < ref name= " Paramecium " / >  Without the rejuvenating effects of conjugation a paramecium ages and dies. < ref name= " Paramecium " / >  Only opposite mating types, or genetically compatible organisms, can unite in conjugation. < ref name= " Paramecium " / > 
 
 This reproductive system is unique to ciliates, and is one of the reasons why we think the Protista is not a natural clade ([[monophyletic]]), but rather a [[polyphyletic]] collection of single-celled organisms. 
 
 === ''Paramecium aurelia'' === 
 This species consists of 14  " syngens " , each genetically isolated from every other, and [[Biochemistry|biochemically]] unique. Each syngen has two mating types. < ref > Sonneborn T.M. 1938. Mating types in ''Paramecium aurelia''. ''Proc Am Philos Soc'' '''79''', 411-434. < /ref >  The syngens are so similar in appearance that they have not been given separate species names. < ref name=King/ > < sup > p322 < /sup > 
 
 === Killer paramecia and kappa particles === 
 These are paramecia which [[secretion|secrete]], into the medium around them, particles which kill other paramecia. This killer [[trait]] is caused by '''kappa particles''', which are [[symbiotic]] bacteria. The kappa particles are only found in paramecia with a [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] K gene. The killing is done by smaller particles which are defective [[DNA]] [[phage]]s. The kappa bacterium is just one of many found in natural populations of ''Paramecium aurelia''. < ref name=King > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006.
