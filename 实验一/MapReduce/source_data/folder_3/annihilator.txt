 '''Annihilator''' are a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[thrash metal]] [[band]] from [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. 
 
 Annihilator was formed in 1984 by lead singer Jeff Waters. He met John Bates and they recorded the song ''Annihilator'' together. Waters and Bates recruited drummer Paul Malek and bassist Dave Scott into the band but Bates and Scott left a year later.
