A '''motorboat''' or '''speedboat''' is a [[boat]] which is powered by an [[engine]] (also commonly called a ''motor''). Some motorboats, especially those used for [[water skiing]], may have two engines. Some motorboats are made with inboard engines built in; others attach an [[outboard motor]] containing the internal combustion engine, the gearbox and the propeller in one portable unit. 
 
 An inboard/outboard contains a hybrid of a powerplant and an outboard, where the engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.
