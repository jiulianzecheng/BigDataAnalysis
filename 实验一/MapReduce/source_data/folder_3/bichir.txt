 '''Bichirs''' and the '''[[reedfish]]''' comprise a [[freshwater fish]] family, the '''Polypteridae''', of ancient [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]]. They are the only [[Family (biology)|family]] in the order '''Polypteriformes'''. All occur in [[Fresh water|freshwater]] habitats in tropical [[Africa]] and the [[Nile]] River system, mainly swampy, shallow [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and [[Estuary|estuaries]]. 
 
 A closely related group, the [[Scanilepiformes]], are known from the [[Triassic]], and are ancestral to them. The oldest polypterids are around 100 million years old, from the early [[Upper Cretaceous|Late Cretaceous]] of [[South America]] and [[Africa]]. They are [[Living fossil|living fossils]]. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 Polypterids are elongated, dragon-like [[freshwater fish]] with a series of dorsal finlets instead of a single [[dorsal fin]]. They have have a maximum body length ranging from 25 cm (9.8 in) to over 100 cm (39 in) depending on specific species and morphology.

 The scales were different, apart from size, from those of modern [[bichirs]]: they feature a discontinuous ganoine layer, a rectilinear shape, and small articular processes. 
 
 == ''Serenoichthys'' == 
 ''Main article: [[Serenoichthys]]'' 
 
 ''[[Serenoichthys]]'' was a small [[polypterid]]. In comparison, the giant polypterid ''[[Bawitius]]'' could reach up to 300 cm (9.8 ft). It resembled a [[carp]] instead of the bichir.

 Polypterids are popular subjects of public and large hobby [[Aquarium|aquaria]], but tend to stay on the ground. Though predatory, they are actually peaceful.  They are sometimes called '''dragon bichir''' or '''dragon fin''' in pet shops for a more appealing name due to their [[dragon]]-like appearance. They are also called '''dinosaur fish''' due to their resemblance to [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]].
