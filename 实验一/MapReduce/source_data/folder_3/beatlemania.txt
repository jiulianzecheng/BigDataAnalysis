'''Beatlemania''' was the fanaticism surrounding the English rock band ''[[The Beatles]]'' in the 1960s. < ref > Davies, Hunter (1968). ''The Beatles: The Authorized Biography''. New York, NY: Dell Publishing. 
 < /ref >  The group's popularity grew in the United Kingdom throughout 1963, propelled by the singles  " Please Please Me " ,  " From Me to You "  and  " She Loves You " .  
 
 By October, the press used the term  " Beatlemania "  to describe the scenes  that attended the band's concert performances.  
 
 From the start of 1964, their world tours had levels of [[hysteria]] and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during the group's travels. In February 1964, the Beatles arrived in the [[United States]] and their televised performances on  [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] were seen by about 73 million people. 
 
 Commentators likened this adulation to a religious fervour, and to a female [[masturbation]] fantasy. Among the displays of deity-like worship, some fans would approach the band in the belief that they possessed supernatural healing powers. 
 
 To protect them from their fans, the Beatles often travelled to these concerts on the U.S.A. by armoured car. < ref > Courrier, Kevin (2009). ''Artificial Paradise: The Dark Side of the Beatles' Utopian Dream''. Westport, CT: Praeger. ISBN 978-0-313-34586-9.
