 '''Virtue''' ([[Latin]] ''virtus''; [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀρετή) is a kind of behaviour which is thought to be good.  The adjective is  " virtuous " .  Someone who lives a virtuous life is someone who leads a good [[morality|moral]] life, doing things that society thinks are good.  The opposite of virtue is [[vice]].   
 
 [[Philosopher]]s throughout the ages have written their ideas about what they think virtue is.  The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosophers from [[Plato]] onwards said that virtue consisted of four things: [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]], [[Courage]], [[Wisdom]], and [[Moderation]].  In the [[Christian]] religion the three virtues  were [[Faith]], [[Hope]] and [[Charity (practice)|Charity]].  These are mentioned in the [[Bible]] in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 13 verse 13.  These virtues are also very important in the [[Judaism|Judaic]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] traditions.
