 '''Dorset''' is a county in south [[England]] which is by the [[sea]]. The biggest towns in it are [[Bournemouth]] and [[Poole]]. There are other smaller towns, some by the sea, like [[Weymouth]], [[Swanage]], West Bay, the [[Isle of Portland]], Dorchester, Wareham, [[Lyme Regis]], Blandford and Wool. 
 ==Location== 
 Dorset is next to [[Devon]], [[Somerset]], [[Wiltshire]] and [[Hampshire]]. 
 There is a lot of countryside in Dorset, so there are quite a few farmers. Other people work in [[office]]s, shops or the holiday business. There are not many factories or [[industry]] in Dorset. 
 People come on holiday to Dorset because the countryside and [[sea]] is peaceful and pretty, and there are not many big towns and no cities at all. Bournemouth, Poole, Weymouth, Swanage and Lyme Regis are quite famous seaside towns, where most holidaymakers go when they come to Dorset. 
 ==Dorset coast== 
 The Dorset coast is part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Jurassic Coast]]. This includes famous fossil sites where [[Mary Anning]] collected, and famous landforms such as [[Chesil Beach]].
