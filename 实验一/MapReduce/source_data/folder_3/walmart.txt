 == Criticism == 
 {{criticism section|date=November 2022}} 
 Walmart is criticized for having a poor record on labor rights, especially regarding anti union activity. It has also been criticized for once promoting made in America for its products but now largely importing the products it sells, from developing nations. Many of these jobs replaced manufacturing jobs in the US. along with the fact that Walmart retail jobs replaced many mom and pop stores in the US. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ufcw.org/|title=The United Food And Commercial Workers International Union Official website of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union}} < /ref >  In 2005, movie director Robert Greenwald made a [[documentary]] movie called ''Walmart The High Cost of Low Price'' that criticized Walmart. After this movie was announced, director Ron Galloway made a film that ended up being released at the same time called ''Why Walmart Works and Why That Drives Some People CRAZY''. This movie had a positive view of Walmart. < ref > {{cite web|author=Horsley, Scott|date=November 13, 2005|title=Documentaries Offer Two Views of Wal-Mart|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5011143|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124113612/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5011143|archive-date=November 24, 2005|accessdate=March 15, 2010|website=|publisher=NPR}} < /ref >
