 A '''shovel''' is a [[tool]] used for moving loose material.  Shovels have a flat bottom head which is angled slightly from the handle to enable scooping and moving of material.  
 
 Although a shovel can be used for digging, it is much less efficient than a [[spade]]. Spades are straight, and transmit force straight downwards. Shovels move loose [[material]], such as [[coal]], snow, [[gravel]] etc. They are usually made of [[metal]] at the bottom, and [[wood]] is sometimes used for the handle.
