 The '''Nephilim,''' also known as Nephilites ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɛ|f|ᵻ|ˌ|l|ɪ|m}}; {{Lang-he|נְפִילִים}}) are mysterious beings mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]―who are said to be large and strong. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite web|title=Nephilim|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nephilim|access-date=2020-11-06|website=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|language=en}} < /ref >  The word  " Nephilim "  is narrowly translated as ''[[giant]]s'' in some Bibles but left untranslated in others. They are mentioned in the following books: Genesis, Numbers, and Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. The Nephilites and their identity are still unknown to this day. < ref name= " Doedens " > {{cite book| last1 = Doedens| first1 = J. J.

 Numbers 13:33 says that they later lived in [[Canaan]] when [[Book of Joshua#Entry into the land and conquest (chapters 2–12)|Israel conquered Canaan]].
