 '''Sīstān''' ({{lang-fa|سیستان}}) is a border region in eastern [[Iran]] ([[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]]) and southern [[Afghanistan]] ([[Nimruz Province|Nimroz]], [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]] and [[Zabul province|Zabul]] provinces). 
 
 Sistan was once the homeland of [[Saka]]s, a Scythian tribe of [[Iranian people|Iranic]] origin. The [[Saffarids]], one of the early Iranian dynasties of the Islamic era, were first from Sistan.
