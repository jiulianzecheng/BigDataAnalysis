 A '''Flügelhorn''' is a [[musical instrument]], a part of the [[Brass instrument|brass family]]. It looks similar to the trumpet but the tubing is wider and more conical. It is pitched in Bb like [[trumpet]]s and [[cornet]]s. It can have three piston valves like a trumpet, or rotary valves like a [[French horn]]. It has been described as being a [[bugle]] with valves. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.jewelrygenius.com/flugInfo.html |title=Flügelhorn history, information, definition |first= |last=|work=jewelrygenius.com |year=2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}} < /ref >  The sound is more mellow, not as harsh as a trumpet. 
 
 The instrument was developed from German hunting horns, and became popular in [[brass band]]s in the 1850's. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/harvdictmusic/flugelhorn_also_fluegelhorn_ger_fl%C3%BCgelhorn_fr_bugle_it_flicorno_sp_fiscorno |title=Flügelhorn |first= |last= |work=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |year=2003 |accessdate=4 November 2012}} < /ref >  Performers such as [[Miles Davis]] have used the Flügelhorn in jazz recordings. < ref > {{cite news | last = Adams | first = Rob | title = Edinburgh Jazz Festival Orchestra: Miles Ahead, Queen's Hall, Edinburgh | work = The Herald | date = 27 July 2011 | accessdate = 4 November 2012 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29243481.html | publisher = via [[HighBeam Research]] | archive-date = 9 April 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160409213614/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29243481.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
