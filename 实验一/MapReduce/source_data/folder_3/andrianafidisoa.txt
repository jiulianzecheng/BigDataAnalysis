 == Coup attempt == 
 Prior to his alleged coup attempt, in October 2006 General Andrianafidisoa had been barred from running for president in [[Malagasy general election, 2006|the election]] scheduled for December 3, 2006, for not paying the required deposit of 25,000,000 [[ariary]]. < ref name= " Reuters "  / > < ref > [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/madagascar/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=AFP85336candielleit0  " 14 candidats autorisés à se présenter à la présidentielle " ], AFP (Jeuneafrique.com), October 18, 2006. < /ref >   Andrianafidisoa had earlier supported Ravalomanana in his struggle against [[Didier Ratsiraka]] over election results in 2002, < ref name= " Fizzle " > [http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=61615  " Attempted  " coup "  fizzles in desire for peaceful poll " ], IRIN, November 20, 2006. < /ref >   and led an attack by pro-Ravalomanana forces on [[Fianarantsoa]] at that time. < ref name= " Reuters "  / > 
 
 While Ravalomanana was out of the country, Andrianafidisoa had leaflets distributed declaring military rule; he called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and went to a base at [[Ivato Airport]], seeking support from soldiers. One soldier was reported killed in a clash there, and Ravalomanana's flight, returning from [[Europe]], was diverted to [[Mahajanga]]. < ref name= " Reuters "  / > < ref > [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/18/africa/AF_GEN_Madagascar_Election_Tension.php  " Retired Madagascar army general calls for military support against president " ], Associated Press, November 18, 2006. < /ref >  Andrianafidisoa's [[takeover]] attempt failed, and he went into hiding or on the run; the government ordered his arrest and began searching for him. However, the general stated that  " I am alive and I am not in hiding, "  on a telephone call to news organization Reuters. According to him,  " Soldiers and politicians have got the message. " < ref name= " Reuters "  / > 
 
 Subsequently Andrianafidisoa denied that the events had been a coup attempt, describing this as a misinterpretation. He did, however, acknowledge that he had called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and that he called for him to resign. < ref name= " Fizzle "  / >  On November 22, Andrianafidisoa received the backing of eight of the 14 presidential candidates, who said he was defending the constitution and the interests of the nation. < ref name= " Eight "  / > < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6177942.stm  " Support for Madagascar 'coup bid' " ], BBC News, November 23, 2006. < /ref > 
 
 A $50,000 reward was offered for Andrianafidisoa's arrest. The secretary of state for public security said that Andrianafidisoa was taken by surprise and captured on December 12 at a hotel, and that he did not resist. < ref > Alain Iloniaina, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1 & click_id=68 & art_id=qw1165995901478B253  " Madagascar captures renegade general  " Fidy " " ], Reuters, December 13, 2006. < /ref >  Several guns, along with ammunition, were found with him.

He was sentenced to four years in prison on February 2, 2007, and stated his intention to appeal the verdict. < ref > [https://archive.today/20070805235821/http://www.apanews.net/apa.php?page=show_article_eng & id_article=20298  " Madagascar : Gen.

 Ravalomanana was [[Malagasy political crisis, 2009|forced out of office]] by a combination of popular protests and military intervention in March 2009. Opposition leader [[Andry Rajoelina]] then took over as President of the High Authority of the Transition and promptly pardoned Andrianafidisoa, along with many other political prisoners, on 26 March 2009. < ref > Andry Ratovo, [http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/200903270443.html  " Libération de 28 prisonniers politiques " ], ''L'Express de Madagascar'' (allAfrica.com), 27 March 2009 {{in lang|fr}}. < /ref >
