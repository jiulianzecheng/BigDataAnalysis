 The '''Bosniaks''' (Bošnjaci/Бошњаци, feminine: ''Bošnjakinja''/Бошњакиња) are [[Slavs|South Slavic]] [[nation]] and [[ethnic group]]. They come from Old [[Bosnia]], which is today [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], though many of them are from the other [[Balkans|Balkan]] populations, especially [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Croatia]]. They come from medieval Bosnians or [[Bosnia|Bošnjani]], [[Slavs|Slavic]] that lived in what was then Bosnia. Medieval Bosniaks or Bosnians (called Dobri bošnjani = ''Good Bosnians'') practiced different religions but they all spoke the Bosnian language. Today, Bosniaks are mostly [[Bosnian language|Bosnian-speaking]], and write in the [[Latin | Latin alphabet]] or [[Cyrillic | Cyrillic alphabet]]. Most modern Bosniaks are [[Islam|Muslim]], and some are [[agnosticism|agnostic]] and [[Atheism|atheists]]. They have both [[Europe]]an and [[Islam]]ic heritage. Both within the [[Balkans]] region and throughout the world, Bosniaks are often noted for their unique culture, which has been influenced by both eastern and western civilizations and schools of thought over the course of their history. 
 
 The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] says the ethnonym ''Bosniak'' was first used in English by the British diplomat and historian [[Paul Rycaut]] in 1680. He spelled it ''Bosnack'' to sound like the post-classical Latin ''Bosniacus'' (possibly earlier than 1682), the French word ''Bosniaque'' (1695 or earlier) or the German word ''Bosniak'' (1737 or earlier). < ref name=OED > {{cite book |chapter-url= http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary & q={{urlencode:Bosniak}} |chapter= Bosniak |title= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= Oxford University Press |edition=3rd |date=September 2005 |isbn= < !-- 0198611862 -- >  |ref=Reference-OED-Bosniak}} < /ref >  An ethnonym is a name of a group of people. The 1836 version of ''Penny Cyclopaedia'' V. 231/1 uses the modern spelling: 
 {{quote| " ''The inhabitants of Bosnia are composed of Bosniaks, a race of Sclavonian origin'' " . < ref name= " Charles Knight 1836 231 " > {{cite book |author= Charles Knight |year= 1836 |title= The Penny Cyclopaedia |publisher=The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |volume=V |page=231 |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C6YrAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA231 }} < /ref > }} 
 
 All [[Slavs|Slavic]] languages use the [[suffix]] ''-ak'' for masculine nouns. For example, people from the ethnic group in Poland can be called ''Polak'' and people from Slovakia [[Slovaks]] (''Slovák''). Consequently,  " Bosniak "  is logic equivalent to its non-ethnic counterpart  " Bosnian, "  which came to English from Middle French as ''Bosnien''): a native of Bosnia. < ref name=OED2 > {{cite book |chapter-url= http://oed.com/search?searchType=dictionary & q=Bosnian |chapter= Bosnian |title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition= 3rd |date=September 2005 |isbn= < !-- 0198611862 -- >  |ref=Reference-OED-Bosnian}} < /ref > 
 
 [[English language|English]]-speakers usually say ''Bosnian Muslim'' when they mean Bosniaks, but this is not completely correct because not all Bosniaks are Muslim. Partly because of this, ever since the country Yugoslavia broke up, people have started to say ''Bosniak'' instead of ''Muslim'' as an official way to talk about this group of people ethnic term to avoid confusion. < ref > {{citation |date= 2016 |orig-year= 2007 |chapter-url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html#People |chapter= Bosnia and Herzegovina: People |title= The World Factbook |publisher= American [[American Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] |issn= 1553-8133 |access-date= 2016-04-13 |archive-date= 2018-03-15 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180315193211/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html#People |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  They also say ''Bosnians'', but this word can mean anyone from Bosnia or Herzegovina, not just members of the Bosniak ethnic group. 
 
 A few million Bosniaks live in the [[Balkans]], and about one million other Bosniaks live in other parts of the world. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] during [[World War II]] (1939-1945) and the [[Bosnian War]] (1993–95) killed many Bosniaks and drove others to move away from where they had been living. Partially because of this, < ref > Committee on Foreign Relations, US Senate, The Ethnic Cleansing of Bosnia-Hercegovina, (US Government Printing Office, 1992) < /ref >  there has been a Bosniak [[diaspora]] in a number of countries, including [[Austria|Bosnian Austrians]], [[Germany]], [[Australia|Bosnian Australians]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].
