 [[Pantsing]] is pulling down someone else’s [[pants]] and sometimes their [[underwear]] without them wanting it.[https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199543700.001.0001/acref-9780199543700-e-3372] It is sometimes a [[Practical jokes|prank]] [https://www.khou.com/amp/article/news/local/6th-grade-students-punished-for-pantsing/285-148654445]and sometimes [[bullying]].[https://drsonjabenson.com/understanding-bully-behavior-second-in-bully-series/#:~:text=“Pantsing”%20is%20physical%2C%20sexual,all%20sexual%20harassment%20is%20bullying.][https://www.definitions.net/definition/pantsing] 
 
 ==History== 
 In [[college]]s in the [[United States]] before [[World War Two]] it was extremely common for [[male]] [[sophomore]]s to [[Pantsing|pants]] male freshmen.  Pantsing was also used in [[fraternity]] [[hazing]]. In 1971, the [[journalist]] [[Gail Sheehy]] said that it happened a lot to [[girl]]s in [[elementary school]] and that it was actually [[sexual assault]].[https://books.google.ca/books?id=B-MCAAAAMBAJ & q=pantsing & pg=PA28 & redir_esc=y#v=snippet & q=pantsing & f=false]  
 ==Nicknames== 
 Pantsing is also called debagging in [[England]], dacking in [[Australia]], breeking in [[Scotland]], down-trou in [[New Zealand]], and jocking in [[Ireland]].  It’s also sometimes called sharking but only when it’s used for [[sexual assault]].[https://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/fourth-charge-put-to-lisburn-teen-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-sharking/31576647.html] 
 
 Another [[Practical jokes|prank]] that is like this one is giving someone a [[wedgie]] where the underwear is pulled up instead of down.[https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/07/gretchen-hamel-pantsing-where-did-pantsing-and-depantsing-come-from.html]  
 
 ==Bullying== 
 Pantsing is sometimes used by kids who are [[bullying]] other [[children]].  In 1996, a [[woman]] named Juanita Ross Epp wrote a [[book]] saying that [[teacher]]s who didn’t have a problem with their [[student]]s [[pants]]ing other students were doing a bad job because pantsing was bullying.[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MNyQAgAAQBAJ & pg=PA18 & lpg=PA18 & dq=juanita+ross+epp+%22pantsing%22 & source=bl & ots=1D90NnvUNi & sig=ACfU3U1zFq31RnB9xJ0KnlAcGzBYIuGTxA & hl=en & sa=X & ved=2ahUKEwi77avr_caCAxVakIkEHeuYCJYQ6AF6BAgVEAI#v=onepage & q=juanita%20ross%20epp%20%22pantsing%22 & f=false]  
 
 ==In fiction== 
 
 In [[The Simpsons]], the [[nerd]]y character Martin Prince wears a lot of different [[bathing suit]]s at the same time when [[swimming]] in a [[pool]] since he knows [[Bart Simpson]] will pull them down but then so many other people pull them down that Martin ends up [[naked]].[https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart_of_Darkness/Quotes] 
 
 In [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], Harry is upset when he finds out that when his dead [[father]] James Potter was 15, he was a [[bully]] to [[Severus Snape]] who would use magic to take off Snape’s [[trousers]] [https://www.mugglenet.com/2018/02/james-potter-jerk/]and maybe his [[underwear]] in front of a lot of people and also made him [[eat]] [[soap]].[https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Books/Order_of_the_Phoenix/Chapter_28#Synopsis]
