 A '''ranch''' is a [[farm]] for raising [[cow]]s, [[horse]]s, [[sheep]] or other [[livestock]]. Most ranches are large, but they can be any size. The word ''ranch'' is from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word  " rancho " . It is used in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]. People who use a ranch are called '''ranchers'''. 
 
 A ranch may be on private or public [[land]]. The [[desert]] areas of the western [[United States]] have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for [[crop]]s. There are also many in desert areas of [[Australia]], where they are called [[Station (agriculture)|stations]]. Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a [[stockman]] or [[cowboy]].
