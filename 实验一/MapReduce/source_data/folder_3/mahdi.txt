The '''Mahdi''' or Mehdi ('the rightly-guided one') is Islam's messiah or savior. It is said that he and the [[Jesus in Islam|Prophet Jesus]] will change the [[earth|world]] for the better, bringing God in all hearts, before [[Yaum al-Qiyamah]] (''Day of the Resurrection'').  
 
 In particular, the [[Sudan]]ese tribal leader [[Muhammed Ahmed]] proclaimed himself as the Mahdi, appointed by [[Allah]] to free his country. He defeated the forces of the [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]] and the British, only to die suddenly six months later.
