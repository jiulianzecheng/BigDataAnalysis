 They were written on palm leaves and compressed birch tree barks.The people who wrote manuscripts were known as scribes. Only the kings could afford a manuscript. 
 
 In the early stages of human civilization, various materials were used for writing manuscripts, including clay tablets, papyrus, parchment, and paper. These materials influenced the form, durability, and portability of manuscripts, shaping their physical characteristics and preservation needs. 
 
 With the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, manuscripts gradually gave way to printed books, which allowed for mass production and wider dissemination of texts. However, early printing methods often borrowed techniques and styles from manuscript production, such as the use of decorative initials and illustrations. The transition from manuscripts to printed books marked a significant shift in the history of written communication and knowledge sharing. 
 
 In the modern context, manuscript writing continues to hold relevance, particularly in academic and creative fields. Manuscripts are created for various purposes, including research articles, novels, poetry, plays, and historical texts. While digital technology and word processing software have made it easier to produce and edit manuscripts electronically, there is still a demand for professional manuscript writing services to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to specific style guidelines.
