 The '''heptarchy''' ({{lang-grc|ἑπτά + ἀρχή}}, ''seven'' + ''realm'') is a collective name applied to seven [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[:wikt:kingdom|kingdoms]]. These were: [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[East Anglia]], [[Essex (kingdom)|Essex]], [[Kent (kingdom)|Kent]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Wessex]]. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms eventually became the [[Kingdom of England]]. The term has been in use since the [[16th century]]. It is used to apply both to the seven kingdoms and to the time period in which they existed. 
 
 == Origins of the heptarchy == 
 
 The idea of a heptarchy, a group of seven independent kingdoms, is thought to have come from the [[English people|English]] [[historian]] Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century.  He listed the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in his ''Historia Anglorum'' (History of the English People). < ref name=Goffart55 > Walter Goffart, 'The First Venture into 'Medieval Geography': Lambarde's Map of the Saxon Heptarchy (1568)', ''Alfred the Wise'', eds. Jane Roberts; Janet L. Nelson; Malcolm Godden (Woodbridge: Boydell  &  Brewster Inc., 1997), p. 55  &  note 10 < /ref >  [[Bede]], however, set up the idea that several kingdoms were more dominant than others (at different times). He created a list of kings who dominated the other kingdoms. The dividing line between these kingdoms was the [[River Humber]]. [[Northumbria]] ([[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]]) was the northern kingdom while the remaining kingdoms were those of the southern English. < ref > Frank Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 32 < /ref >  The actual term 'heptarchy' was first used in the 16th century by William Lambarde. His 1568 [[woodcut]] map is the earliest known use of the term. < ref > Walter Goffart, 'The First Venture into 'Medieval Geography': Lambarde's Map of the Saxon Heptarchy (1568)', ''Alfred the Wise'', eds. Jane Roberts; Janet L. Nelson; Malcolm Godden (Woodbridge: Boydell  &  Brewster Inc., 1997), pp. 53, 56 < /ref > 
 
 The term heptarchy is sometimes used to imply a [[:en:wikt:confederacy|confederacy]] between the kingdoms that did not exist. < ref name=Frassetto308 > Michael Frassetto, ''The Early Medieval World'' (Santa Barbara,CA: ABC-CLIO, 2013), p. 308 < /ref >  From the 6th century to the 9th century these were simply seven kingdoms set up by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders and their descendants. There was little equality between them. Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex were the most powerful of the seven and often dominated the others. < ref name=Frassetto308/ >  The kingdoms were gradually reduced in number. The heptarchy basically ended with the coming of the [[Vikings]]. < ref name=Frassetto308/ >  The term heptarchy was popular among scholars from the 16th to the 19th centuries but is occasionally used today. < ref name=Frassetto308/ > 
 
 === Bretwaldas === 
 Originally Bede listed seven kings who held authority over the other kingdoms in England at the time.{{efn|This did not directly identify the seven kingdoms, but set up the idea of a list of dominant kingdoms. Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury (''Gesta regnum'') and Matthew of Paris (''Chronica Majora'') all promoted the idea of the same seven kingdoms (later called the Heptarchy). < ref name=Goffart55/ > }} The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle lists the eighth bretwalda: < ref name=Blair274 > Peter Hunter Blair, ''Roman Britain and Early England; 55 B.C.–A.D. 871'' (New York; London: W.
