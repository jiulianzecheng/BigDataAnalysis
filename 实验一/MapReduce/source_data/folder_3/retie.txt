 The town is near the Dutch border and is in fact closer to the city of Eindhoven than Antwerp. 
 
 The official [[language]] of the area is [[Dutch]], but many people especially in the hospitality industry speak [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. 
 
 ==Services== 
 
 Services are basic in Retie, some banks have branches including ING and AXA. Supermarket shopping is available. Bakeries in Retie are very good. Like most of Belgium the shops are generally closed on Sunday. 
 
 The Gemeente (local council) official website (in Dutch) is http://www.retie.be/  
 
 ==Places== 
 
 There is a pretty [[City and town halls|town hall]] in the centre of the town, but unlike many Belgian towns it is not organised around a town square (well it is now just a large intersection) and therefore does not have the quaint village feel as many other small towns in this part of Belgium (for example Lommel, Mol). 
 
 The main attraction of the town is Prinsenpark - a public [[forest]] that is popular with families and walking/jogging groups. Dogs on leads are allowed. There are picnic tables and [[toilet]]s.
