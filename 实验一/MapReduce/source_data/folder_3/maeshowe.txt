 The mound used to be taller, with a depression in the top, looking like a small volcano. It measured 11 meters in height and had a diameter of 30 meters. < ref name= " maeshowe " > {{cite web | url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/index.html | title=Maeshowe, Orkney's finest chambered cairn | publisher=Orkneyjar | work=Orkneyjar: Heritage of the Orkney Islands | date=2012 | accessdate=December 11, 2012}} < /ref >  This was changed in 1861 when the mound was dug into by [[archaeologist]] James Farrer. 
 
 It was built on a raised level area and [[wikt:surround|surrounded]] by a ditch and a raised bank. It may have been built on top of an earlier structure. Research shows that the ditch used to be filled with water, and there was a large stone circle around the mound. The grave itself is a long narrow entrance opening into a large chamber. There are three smaller rooms which open into the main chamber. < ref name= " maeshowe " / >  It has been built to line up with the sun at the Winter Solstice. < ref name=mae/ > 
 
 Maeshowe had been dug up in the [[12th century]] by the [[Viking]]s. < ref name= " maeshowe " / >  It has many Norse carvings on the rocks.
