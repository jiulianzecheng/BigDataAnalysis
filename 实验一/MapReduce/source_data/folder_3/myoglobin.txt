 '''Myoglobin''' is a [[protein]] that is able to bind [[oxygen]]. Myoglobin, which is similar to [[haemoglobin]], is the main [[oxygen]]-carrying [[biological pigment|pigment]] of muscle tissues. < ref name= " review " > {{cite journal | author = Ordway G.A.  &  Garry D.J. | title = Myoglobin: an essential hemoprotein in striated muscle | journal = J.

It is in the [[muscle]] [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] of most [[mammal]]s. [[Pinniped|Seal]]s and other [[ocean|marine]] [[mammal]]s have more myoglobin in their muscles than land animals.  
 
 In humans, increased level of myoglobin in the [[serum]] of the [[blood]] can be an indication of [[myocardial infarction]]. Other factors for a higher level can be [[damage]] to the [[muscle]]s, [[epilepsy|epileptic seizure]]s, [[polytrauma]]. If the value is much too high, this can lead to [[kidney failure]]. 
 
 Myoglobin belongs to the [[globin]] superfamily of proteins, and as with other globins, consists of eight [[alpha helices]] connected by loops. Myoglobin has 153 amino acids. < ref >  Universal protein resource accession number P02144. [UniProt is the Universal Protein resource, a central repository of protein data] < /ref >
