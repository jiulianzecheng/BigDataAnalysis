[[File:Ammit.svg|thumb|alt=|Ammit is a [[hybrid]] of three fierce Nile creatures: crocodile, lion, and hippo. Ammit devours the hearts that are heavier than the feather of [[Ma'at]].]] 
 
 '''Ammit''' was the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] idea of the punishment of the [[soul]]. The name means  " devourer "  or  " soul-eater. " Ammit was usually known as 'The Devourer of the Dead' or the 'Eater of Hearts'. Ammit was believed to eat any souls found to have [[sin]]ned. They would then be [[Digestion|digested]] for [[eternity]] in [[acid]]. Or, Ammit who was believed to be the guardian of a lake of fire, would place the soul into the liquid fire for all eternity. 
 
 Ammit appears as mix of the [[crocodile]], [[lion]], and [[hippo]]. Rather than being worshipped, Ammit was feared. She was not viewed as a [[god]], but she was viewed as a good force because she destroyed [[evil]]. Although Ammit is seen as a devouring entity, she is neutral and strictly serves at the whim of the other deities to take souls that have sinned against the gods and send them into oblivion. She was known as the crocodile goddess also known as Estriedia. 
 
 Ammit was believed to be Anubis's equal but She wanted to enter the real world and devour the souls of the living. 
 
 == In Popular Culture == 
 Ammit also intermittently appears as Ammit the Devourer in [[The Kane Chronicles]]. In the trilogy, it was kept at bay with [[Anubis]]. Ammit was also the [[antagonist]] of the [[television show]] [[Moon Knight]].
