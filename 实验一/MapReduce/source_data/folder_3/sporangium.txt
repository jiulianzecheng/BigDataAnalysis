 A '''sporangium''' (pl: ''sporangia'')  < ref > modern Latin, from Greek spora ‘spore’ + angeion ‘vessel'. < /ref > < ref > also known as sporanges (sing., sporange) Oxford [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/442]{{Dead link|date=September 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  is an enclosure in which [[spore]]s are formed. < ref > Rost, Barbour, Stocking, Murphy, 2006. ''Plant biology''. 2nd ed, Thompson Brooks/Cole. < /ref >  It can be a single cell or [[multicellular]]. All [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and many other lineages form sporangia at some point in their [[life cycle]]. Sporangia can produce [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] spores by [[mitosis]], but in nearly all land plants and many fungi, sporangia are the site of [[meiosis]], and produce genetically unique [[haploid]] spores. 
 
 In [[flowering plant]]s the sporangium tissue (except the epidermis) that produces the female spores is also called the '''nucellus'''. < ref > {{citation |url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/top/glossaryi_p.html |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, Glossary |accessdate=10 May 2015}} < /ref >
