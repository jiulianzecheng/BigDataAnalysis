 The '''Torridonian''' is a [[sedimentary]] [[sandstone]] which sits on top of the earliest rocks in [[Scotland]]. The map shows the sandstone as orange: it is on the western edge of the mainland, and on part of [[Skye]]. Geographically, this is part of the district of [[Wester Ross]]. 
 
 The sandstone is the earliest sedimentary rock in this part of the world. Under it lies much older [[gneiss]] known as the [[Lewisian complex]]. All the rock under the sandstone is [[igneous]] and [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] igneous rock.  
 
 The sandstones are [[red beds]] laid down by rivers and lakes in a [[landscape]] of low rocky hills. A great thickness of red sandstone, brought in by rivers, buried the old hills. This took place in the [[Proterozoic]], 1,200 to 544 million years ago (mya). There are older and younger sandstone groups, with a long period between them. < ref name= " Park " > {{cite book|last1=Park R.G; Stewart A.D.  &  Wright D.T. 2003|editor=Trewin N.H.|title=The Geology of Scotland  |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObdepEp9r7kC & dq=%22hebridean+terrane%22+park+lewisian+torridon & pg=PA45|accessdate=23 June 2010|publisher=Geological Society|location=London|isbn=978-1-86239-126-0|pages=45â€“61|chapter=3.

 As a result of later periods of [[Rift (geology)|rifting]] and [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], some of the Torridian sandstone lies under the sea, and some of it is uplifted into [[mountain]]s.
