 '''Philately''' is the study and collection of [[postage stamp]]s and postal history. 
 
 == Types of Philately == 
 
 * [[Thematic philately]], also known as topical philately, is the study of art shown on stamps. This can be pictures of many things on a stamp, like people, animals, boats, insects, and vehicles. Interesting parts of thematic philately also include mistakes in the art of a stamp. For example, the removal of cigarettes from United States stamps. 
 * [[Postal history]] studies the history of how mail and stamps were [[Process|processed]]. This relates to [[Post office|post offices]], [[Postmark|postmarks]], and how [[mail]] is taken from place to place. 
 * [[Aerophilately]] studies airmail (mail that travels on planes). 
 * [[Astrophilately]] studies stamps that are related to [[outer space]], and objects like the Moon.
