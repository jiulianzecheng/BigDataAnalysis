 '''Laxoox''' (pronounced 'la-hoh') in Somalia, or '''Canjeera''' is a flat bread, a kind of pancake served in [[Somaliland]], [[Somalia]], [[Yemen]] and parts of [[Djibouti]]. It is frequently seen in the kitchens of northern East Africa.  
 
 ==Variants== 
 Laxoox bread is very similar to ''injera'', made in Ethiopian and Eritrea, but is much thinner and smaller in size. However, laxoox  is always made with wheat flour, while the injera is made from teff (which can be made with flour of other cereals).  
 
 ==Preparation== 
 The bread is made with a mixture of sorghum flour, all-purpose flour, yeast (optional), warm water and a small portion of salt. The mixture is stirred by hand until it becomes creamy and smooth, and is left to ferment. If yeast is not being added, the batter is made in the afternoon and left to ferment overnight. 
 
 The laxoox is traditionally cooked in a circular metal plate called Daawa. Somalis living in exile, without access to a Daawa, use a normal pan instead.  
 
 Traditionally, laxoox is served as a breakfast with tea and ''subag'' (ghee butter) or ''saliid'' ''macraso'' (sesame oil). Laxoox is also served with stir-fried liver, scrambled eggs, minced meat, beans, hummus, soup or camel milk.
