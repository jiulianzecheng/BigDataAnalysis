'''Endosymbiosis''' occurs when a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] lives inside the body or the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s of another organism. It is a very widespread phenomenon in living things. < ref name=Buchner/ > 
 
 Examples are: 
 *[[Rhizobia]]: [[nitrogen]]-fixing [[bacteria]] which live in [[root]] nodules on plants of the [[pea]] family. 
 *Singly-celled [[foram]]s which include a single-celled [[alga]] inside the cell. This is 'facultative', which means they may or may not do it. A more far-reaching version is ''idioplastic'' endosymbiosis. Here, the foram consumes the alga, but keeps its [[chloroplast]]s in working order. 
 *[[Green algae]] inside [[Ocean|marine]] [[polychaete]] worms. 
 *Single-celled algae inside [[Coral reef|reef]]-building [[coral]]s. 
 *[[Gut flora]] (often [[flagellate]]s) inside the digestive systems of [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s which digest plant [[cellulose]]. These are 'obligate' symbionts, which means the host must have them. < ref name=Buchner > Buchner P. 1965. ''Endosymbioses of animals with plant microorganisms''. Wiley N.Y. < /ref > 
 *[[Lichen]]: [[fungus]]+[[alga]] or [[bacterium]]. 
 *[[Mycorrhiza]]: fungal [[hypha]]e and [[root]]s of [[tree]]s. 
 
 == Eukaryote theory == 
 '''Endosymbiont theory''' is the idea that [[eukaryote]] [[cells]] arose in [[evolution]] by the fusion of previously free-living [[protist]]s ([[prokaryote]]s). < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p143 < /sup >  The theory was first suggested by the [[Russia]]n botanist Konstantin Mereshkovsky in 1905. < ref > Mereshkovsky C 1905. Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche. ''Biol Centralbl'' '''25''': 593–604. < /ref >  The  nature of [[lichen]]s had been worked out; < ref > de Bary, Antoine 1879.

 The eukaryote cell is the type of cell all animals and plants are made of. Some cell [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, contain [[DNA]]. In each case, this DNA is thought to be the remnant of the  [[genome]] of a once independent [[bacterium]]. The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or [[archaea]]n organisms. Together, the new cells survived, prospered and evolved into new and complex forms of life. < ref > Margulis, Lynn 1998. ''The symbiotic planet: a new look at evolution''. Weidenfeld  &  Nicolson, London. Margulis believes symbiosis is the most important force in evolution. < /ref > < ref > Sapp J. 1994. ''Evolution by association: a history of symbiosis''. Oxford.

Yale, New Haven CN. < /ref > < ref > Lake, James A. Evidence for an early prokaryote symbiogenesis. ''Nature'' '''460''' 967–971. < /ref >  The origin of other organelles in the eukaryotic cell is still under review: the [[cell nucleus]], its membrane, [[chromosome]]s and [[centromere]]s; the [[Golgi body]]; the [[flagella]] or [[cilia]]; the [[cell membrane|intracellular membrane]]s. Some of these may also have had a symbiotic origin. < ref > Dyer, Betsy Dexter and Obar, Robert Alan 1994. ''Tracing the history of eukaryotic cells: the enigmatic smile''.

 Examples: 
 *[[Mitochondria]] live inside the cells of all animals, plants, and fungi. They make a fuel for the cells called [[ATP]]; it is the most common fuel in the body. Mitochondria were once [[bacteria]], but now they cannot live outside animal cells. 
 
 *[[Chloroplast|Choroplast]] < nowiki/ > s are [[plastid]]s which live inside the cells of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms. They contain [[chlorophyll]], which grabs energy from sunlight and makes it into sugar. Chloroplasts were once [[cyanobacteria]]. [[Glaucophyte]]s are an algae with chloroplasts that are more like blue-green bacteria: the cell walls are still sensitive to [[antibiotic]]s. 
 
 *Kelp and other [[brown algae]] are different from other endosymbiotic associations.  A brown algae cell fused with the cell of a green algae, which already had an endosymbiont.  This is called secondary endosymbiosis. 
 
 *The endosymbiont for some [[dinoflagellate]]s was once a brown algae. This is called [[tertiary]] (third) endosymbiosis. 
 
 === Endosymbiosis in prokaryotes === 
 There is evidence that symbiosis happened between ancient [[bacteria]] to produce the double-[[membrane]] class known as [[gram-negative]] bacteria. < ref > Lake, James A. 2009. Evidence for an early prokaryotic endosymbiosis. ''Nature'' '''460''': p967. < /ref >  Since the gram-negative bacteria include the [[cyanobacteria]], this was the first of several such events in the history of the eukaryotes.
