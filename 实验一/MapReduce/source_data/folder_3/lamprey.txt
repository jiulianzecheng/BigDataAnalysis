 '''Lampreys''' are jawless [[fish]], whose adults are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like, sucking mouth. Lampreys belong to the order '''Petromyzontiformes'''. They live in coastal and fresh waters, and are found in temperate regions around the world.  
 
 == Description == 
 Lampreys are [[eel]]-like, scaleless animals. They range from about 15 to 100 centimetres (6 to 40 inches) long. They have well-developed eyes, one or two dorsal fins, a tail fin, a single nostril on top of the head, and seven gill openings on each side of the body. Like the [[hagfish]], they lack bones, jaws, and paired fins. The skeleton of a lamprey consists of cartilage; the mouth is a round, sucking hole with horny teeth.
