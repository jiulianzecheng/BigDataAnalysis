A '''nucleobase''' is a part of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] which may be involved in pairing (see [[base pair]]). Nucleobases are important for [[genetics]]. 
 
 They include [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]] in ([[DNA]]), [[uracil]] in ([[RNA]]) and [[xanthine]] and [[hypoxanthine]] (mutated forms of guanine and adenine). These are abbreviated as C, G, A, T, U, X and HX [[wikt:respectively|respectively]]. They are usually simply called '''bases''' in genetics. Because A, G, C and T appear in the DNA, these molecules are called '''DNA-bases'''; A, G, C and U are called '''RNA-bases'''. 
 
 Uracil replaces thymine in RNA.
