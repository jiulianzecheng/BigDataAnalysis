 '''Powder''' is very small, dry pieces or [[grain]]s. When we press some dry [[solid]]s very hard, or when we cut something up into lots of small pieces, we can sometimes make powder.   
 
 For example, people sometimes put ''face powder'' on their [[face]]s, when they want to look good. Sometimes [[sport]]s players put powder on their [[hand]]s, to make them dry. We put ''[[curry]] powder'' in our [[food]], to make it taste stronger. We put ''washing powder'' in the washing machine when we want to have clean [[clothes]]. People use ''[[gunpowder]]'' to make [[bomb]]s and [[firework]]s. 
 
 " Powder "  is also a [[verb]] - meaning to apply powder.
