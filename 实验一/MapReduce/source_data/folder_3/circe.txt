 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Circe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|s|iː}}; [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Κίρκη''' ''Kírkē''  " [[falcon]] " ) is a minor [[goddess]] of [[magic]]. Sometimes, she is described as a [[nymph]], [[witch]], [[enchantress]] or sorceress. In the ''[[Odyssey]]'' [[Homer]] describes her  as 'The loveliest of all immortals,' living on the [[island]] of [[:en:Aeaea|Aeaea]], famous for her part in the adventures of [[Odysseus]]. 
 
 In most descriptions, Circe was the daughter of [[Helios]], the god of the sun, and [[Perse]], an [[Oceanid]], and the sister of [[Aeetes]], the keeper of the [[Golden Fleece]], [[Perses (brother of Aeetes)|Perses]], and [[Pasiphaë]], the Wife of [[King Minos]] and mother of the [[Minotaur]]. < ref > Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.135 & fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.135]; Hesiod, ''Theogony'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+956 & fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 956]; Apollodorus, ''Library'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9%3Asection%3D1 1.9.1]; Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica ''. < /ref >  Other accounts make her the daughter of [[Hecate]]. < ref > Grimal; Smith < /ref > 
 
 Circe [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals through the use of magical potions. She was known for her knowledge of [[drug]]s and [[herb]]s. 
 
 That Circe also purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Apsyrtus]], as told in ''[[Argonautica]]'', < ref > " They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirké < !--Kirké in original-- >  should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos "  ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv.586-88, in Peter Grean's translation). < /ref >  may be an early tradition. < ref > See the ancient concept of ''[[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705-17, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p 322. < /ref >
