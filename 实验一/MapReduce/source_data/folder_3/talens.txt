'''TALENs''' were a kind of [[genetic engineering]] tool. They are [[restriction enzyme]]s because they can cut specific sequences of [[DNA]]. They have a binding domain (strip of bases) and a cleavage domain. 
 
 The letters stand for  " transcription activator-like effector nucleases " . The technique was called  " genome editing with engineered nucleases " . Together with [[zinc finger nuclease]]s and [[CRISPR]]/[[Cas9]], TALEN was for a while an important tool in [[genome]] editing. < ref > Boch J. 2011. TALEs of genome targeting.
