 '''Pickling''' is a method of making [[food]] last longer. In pickling, the food is put either into [[vinegar]], or in salt water (called [[brine]]). This food is often put in an airtight jar. Pickling also changes the flavour of the food.  
 
 The key to pickling is that it produces low [[pH]], 4.6 or lower. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20080313102803/http://www.mda.state.mn.us/food/business/factsheets/picklebill.htm Minnesota Department of Agriculture  " Pickle Bill "  Fact Sheet], www.mda.state.mn.us < /ref >  This kills most [[bacteria]]. Pickling can preserve [[Decomposition|perishable]] foods for months. Anti-[[microbe|microbial]] [[herbs]] and [[spices]], such as [[mustard]] seed, [[garlic]], [[cinnamon]] or [[clove]]s, are often added. < ref > [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC154497/ Antimicrobial Effects of Mustard Flour and Acetic Acid], www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov < /ref > 
 
 Common pickled foods include [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[onions]] and other [[Vegetable|vegetables]].
