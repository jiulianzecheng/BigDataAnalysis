 These frogs are quite common, and researchers think this has been overlooked because of their their small size. < ref > Briggs, Helen 2017. Meet the frog that can sit on a thumbnail. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39042646] < /ref >  They are indeed extremely small, and can sit on a coin or a fingernail. However, they are not so small as ''[[Paedophryne]]'', which is the smallest land [[vertebrate]].
