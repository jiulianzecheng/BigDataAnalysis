 The '''Herut''' Party (Herut means [[freedom]] in [[Hebrew]]) was a [[right-wing]] [[Zionist]] [[political party]] in [[Israel]].  Herut was founded by [[Menachem Begin]] following [[Israel]]'s independence in 1948.  Herut believed that all of [[British Mandatory Palestine]] belonged to the [[Jews]]. Herut was opposed to [[Israel]] accepting [[money]] from [[West Germany]] as an apology for the [[Holocaust]]. Herut believed [[security]] was very important.  Israel's first [[Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] thought Herut was [[radical]] and he compared [[Menachem Begin]] and the other members of the Herut party to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi]]s.  Herut's [[leader]] [[Menachem Begin]] was not a [[Socialist]] so he formed an alliance in 1965 with the [[Liberal Party]] to create the Liberal-Freedom Bloc known in [[Hebrew]] as Gush Herut Liberalim or [[Gahal]].  In September 1973, Gahal merged with the Free Centre, the National List and the non-parliamentary Movement for Greater Israel to create the  [[Likud]], which was at first an [[alliance]]. In 1988 it became a party and Herut dissolved.
