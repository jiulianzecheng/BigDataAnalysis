 The word '''hoax''' refers to something that is not true and was created on purpose. For example, a [[person]] makes up false accusations about being [[victim]]ized by other people, or an article may make things up that cause people to believe as though they are true when they are not. 
 
 Hoaxes come in all types of forms: for example, [[April Fools' Day]] tricks that are shown in a time related to April 1, then shown to be a hoax later.
