 '''Emo''' is a kind of music which is short for  " emotive hardcore. "  The style first formed in the mid-1980s, taking the musical sounds of hardcore punk and post-hardcore and combining them with sad and sensitive lyricism (words) that emo has become so well known for. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/emo-ma0000004447|title=Emo Music Genre Overview|website=AllMusic}} < /ref > 
 
 In the mid-1990s, emo incorporated [[indie rock]] elements. This ultimately made the emo bands of the 90's much less angry and 'punk-ish' and more dramatic, sometimes even acoustic. Once emo became popular in the 2000s, it became shaped by [[pop-punk]], (a mix of emo and pop punk exists, and is called  " emo-pop " ) [[alternative rock]] and [[melodic hardcore]]. 
 
 The birthplace of the emo style of music is often said to be [[Washington, D.C.]]. This is because the first known emo band, Rites Of Spring, is from that city. 
 
 ==Fashion== 
 [[File:Emo boy 02 with Girl.jpg|thumb|175px|An emo boy and an emo girl.]] 
 As emo entered the mainstream, it became as tied to fashion as to the music genre. The term  " emo "  is associated with wearing skinny jeans, as well as tight T-shirts (usually short-sleeved) or zip-up hoodies which often bear the names of emo bands. Studded belts, converse sneakers, vans, and black wristbands also became associated with emo fashion. Also, thick, horn-rimmed glasses remained in emo fashion. In the mid-2000s, eyeliner and black fingernails became another common thing in emo fashion. The most famous part of emo fashion is the emo hairstyle. The emo hairstyle is flat, straight, and usually jet black hair with long bangs that often will cover a lot of the face. This fashion has at times been characterized as a fad. Emo fashion also has been often confused with goth fashion and scene fashion. 
 
 As emo became known as a subculture, people who both dressed in emo fashion and associated themselves with the genre of emo music have been called  " emo kids "  or  " emos " . 
 
 ==Music== 
 Examples of bands that emos have been known for listening to are [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein]], [[AFI (band)|AFI]], Dashboard Confessional, [[Simple Plan]], Brand New, [[From First to Last]], [[Armor for Sleep]], [[Aiden]], Senses Fail, [[Fall Out Boy]], Taking Back Sunday, The Movielife, [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[The Used]], [[Alesana]], Finch, [[Panic! at the Disco]], and [[Paramore]]. 
 
 Emo kids also tend to show high interest in lesser known emo bands, such as Ashestoangels, A Thorn For Every Heart, Dear Whoever and (early) Greeley Estates. 
 
 Three of the bands mentioned above are multi-platinum acts ([[My Chemical Romance]], < ref > [https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/09/20/my-chemical-romances-gerard-way-taps-another-nail-into-emo-coffin/  " My Chemical Romance’s Gerard Way Taps Another Nail Into 'Emo' Coffin " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207003243/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/09/20/my-chemical-romances-gerard-way-taps-another-nail-into-emo-coffin/ |date=2008-12-07 }}, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', September 20, 2007, retrieved 2 May 2009. < /ref >  [[Fall Out Boy]], < ref name= " chartblog " > [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2007/06/paramore_misery_business.shtml|title=Paramore  " Misery Business " ]{{Dead link|date=June 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 14 June 2007, ''BBC.co.uk'', retireved 2 April 2009.

They have, however, protested to belonging to the emo genre.

 ====Suicide and self harm==== 
 {{main|Suicide in music subcultures}} 
 Some people believe emo is a bad thing. A teenager named Hannah Bond died by [[suicide by hanging|hanging herself]], blamed by both her mother, Heather Bond, and Hannah's [[coroner]] ( " dead body analyst " ). They both believed that emo music caused Hannah to think that suicide is good. They noticed that Hannah appeared to really enjoy the song [[My Chemical Romance]]. They noticed that she joined an  " emo cult " , and an image of an emo girl with bloody wrists was shown on her [[Bebo]] page. < ref name=nme/ >  It was reported that Hannah told her parents that her self-harm was an  " emo initiation ceremony " . < ref name= " nme " > {{cite web |date=2008-05-08 |title=Emo music attacked over teen suicide |url=https://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/36468 |website=NME}} < /ref >  Heather Bond does not like emo culture:  " There are 'emo' websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves. " < ref name= " nme "  / >  After the results of her dead body are reported on the magazine ''[[NME]]'', fans of emo music were complaining that the emo culture did not promote self-harm and suicide. < ref > {{cite web |date=2008-05-08 |title=Emo fans defend their music against suicide claims |url=https://www.nme.com/news/my-chemical-romance/36480 |website=NME}} < /ref >  The band My Chemical Romance felt sad about Hannah's death, < ref name= " nme2 "  / >  and spoke verbally that the band is both anti-violence and anti-suicide. < ref name= " nme2 " > {{cite web |date=May 25, 2008 |title=My Chemical Romance speak about 'emo' suicide |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-110-1321591 |website=[[NME]]}} < /ref >
