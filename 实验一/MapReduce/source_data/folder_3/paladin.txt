 A '''paladin''' or '''paladine''' was a [[person]] with a lot of [[power]] in many countries during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and in [[early modern Europe]]. 
 
 The word paladin was first used in [[Ancient Rome]] for a [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] of the Emperor, and also for the imperial palace guard, called the [[Scholae Palatinae]] by [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], the meaning changed and the word was used for one of the highest [[Palatinus (Roman Catholic Church)|officials of the Catholic Church]] in the [[pope]]'s service and also for one of the big [[noble]]s of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who was then named [[Count Palatine]]. The word paladin was also used in 19th century [[Hungary]] and in the [[German Empire]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the early 20th century. 
 
 In [[medieval literature]], the paladins or Twelve Peers were known in the [[Matter of France]] as the [[retinue|retainers]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Because of the way that this word was used in books, paladin was then known to be a [[knight]] with honor.

 In the beginning, the word paladin was applied to the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlains]] and to some [[soldier]]s guarding the [[palace]] of the Roman emperor. In Constantine's time, the word was also used for the best [[infantry]] of the army, the [[Praetorian Guard]], that might guard the Roman Emperor during wars. < ref > [[Jochen Bleicken|Bleicken]], [[Werner Dahlheim|Dahlheim]] etc, Roman History, {{ISBN|3506739271}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Holy Roman Empire=== 
 After the Middle Ages, the word palatine was put onto many different people of power across Europe. The most important of these was the ''comes palatinus'', the [[count palatine]], who in [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] times, was an official of the lords' household and court of law. 
 
 During the 800s, Carolingean rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it. About a century later, the title was made alive again by [[Otto I the Great|Otto I]], though the new empire was now centered in Germany rather than [[France]]. The term palatine is found again under Charles IV, but they were less powerful than the previous palatines. 
 
 ===Modern usage=== 
 In the early days of [[England]], the word ''palatinate'', or county palatine, was also used in counties of lords who could use powers normally used by the crown. 
 
 In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Germany]], paladin was an official rank and was a very good title for one in the service of the emperors. It was a [[Knight]] with additional honours, they were allowed to use powers normally used by the crown. < ref > Brockhaus < /ref > 
 
 ==Present day== 
 The word  " paladin "  is still used to describe a good, heroic person, or a defender of a good cause. 
 
 Some role playing games now use paladins as a character class that you can choose when starting a new game.
