 '''CrossCountry''' is a [[train operating company]], the brand name of XC Trains Limited owned by [[Arriva]], that has operated [[Great Britain]]’s Cross Country rail franchise since 11 November 2007. The franchise was formed through the amalgamation of most of the former [[Virgin Cross Country|Cross Country]] franchise previously held by [[Virgin Trains]] (which consisted of inter-city services that do not terminate in [[London]]) with some of the longer-distance routes (including some former [[Central Citylink]] services) operated by the former [[Central Trains]].
