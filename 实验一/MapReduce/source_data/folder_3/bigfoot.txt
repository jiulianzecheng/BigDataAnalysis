 '''Bigfoot''', also called '''Sasquatch''' is a creature in [[folklore]]. People say that they are [[primate]]s living in remote areas of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], most commonly in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Even though many people claim to have seen a Bigfoot, or seen their tracks, no one has ever captured one, or found a dead body. So, most people do not believe in Bigfoot. Bigfoot is said to be very tall, from 7 to 9 feet (about 2 to 2.75 meters) and covered in brown, black, red, or sometimes even white fur or hair. They are said to have very big feet, about 13 inches long (0.3 meters), which is why they are named Bigfoot. 
 
 Bigfoot is similar to another mythical creature, the [[Yeti]] of the [[Himalayas]]. 
 
 The name '''Sasquatch''' comes from the Halkomelem language, a Central Salish language in the Salish language family.  Stories of this type of creature are known among a number of [[First Nations]] groups in south-western [[British Columbia]].
