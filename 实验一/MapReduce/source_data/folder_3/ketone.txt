 A '''ketone''' is an [[organic compound]] that has a [[carbon]] [[atom]] with a [[double bond]] to an [[oxygen]] atom (this is called carbonyl [[functional group]]). This carbon atom must also have single bonds to two other carbon atoms. 
 
 A ketone can be produced by oxidating a [[secondary alcohol]].  
 
 A ketone will show a strong peak between 1690 and 1715cm < sup > -1 < /sup >  using [[infrared]] [[spectroscopy]]. < ref > Padias, Anne. ''Making the Connections: A How-to guide for Organic Chemistry Lab Techniques''. 2nd. Plymouth: Hayden-McNeil, 2011. pp 73. Print. < /ref >
