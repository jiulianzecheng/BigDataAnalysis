 A '''krater''' was a large [[ceramic]] [[vase]]. Kraters were used to mix [[wine]] and water in [[Ancient Greece]]. Once filled, the krater was heavy and not easily moved. Another vessel was dipped into the mix. This vessel was then used to fill other vessels such as wine cups. The krater was the centerpiece of a party in Ancient Greece. A special person was chosen by party guests to take care of the krater.
