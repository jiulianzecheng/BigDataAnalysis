 '''Protostomes''' are a [[nephrozoa]]n [[taxon]] of [[animal]]s above the level of [[phylum]]. It is not part of the normal system of [[classification]].  
 
 They are a subtaxon of the [[Bilateria]], and are contrasted with the [[deuterostome]]s. Protosomes are distingued by their [[embryo]]: in deuterostomes, the first opening (the blastopore) becomes the [[anus]], while in protostomes it becomes the mouth. 
 
 [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]] suggests that protostome animals can be divided into three major groups: 
 *[[Ecdysozoa]], e.g. [[arthropod]]s,  [[nematode]]s 
 *[[Platyzoa]], e.g. [[platyhelminthes]], [[rotifer]]s 
 *[[Lophotrochozoa]], e.g. [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]]s 
 as well as a number of minor taxa, like the [[Chaetognatha]].
