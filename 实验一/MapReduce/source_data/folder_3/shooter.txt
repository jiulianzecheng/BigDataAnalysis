A '''shooter''' is a kind of [[video game]]. The aim of the game is to beat enemies by shooting (or otherwise killing) them. The enemies shoot back.   
 
 Many of the oldest computer games were shooters; the first video game ever made was a shooter called ''Computer Space''.  And one of the first games that many people played was a shooter called ''[[Space Invaders]]''.   
 
 There are lots of different kinds of shooter.  Now many people like [[first-person shooter]]s.  But there are other kinds too.  In [[Japan]] many people play shooters where the enemies fire lots of bullets.  The bullets make beautiful patterns on the screen.  This kind of shooter is called a ''[[barrage shooter]], [[Bullet hell|bullet hell game]]'' or a ''[[curtain fire shooter]]''.  It is also called by the Japanese name, ''[[danmaku]]''. One of these games is [[Touhou]]. Another that combines bullet hell elements with an RPG is [[Undertale]].
