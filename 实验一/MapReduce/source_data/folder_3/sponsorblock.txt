 ==History== 
 Only sponsorships could be skipped until more categories (such as self-promotion or intermissions) were added in June 2020. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Categories – SponsorBlock |url=https://blog.ajay.app/categories-sponsorblock/ |access-date=2020-12-27 |website=blog.ajay.app}} < /ref >  An update in January 2022 added support for marking whole videos as sponsorships. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Allow submitting as full video · ajayyy/SponsorBlock@d36b4a5 |url=https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock/commit/d36b4a54f3154fdcfbd2e5f059c401bdd6ceeee3 |access-date=2022-03-28 |website=GitHub |language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Usage== 
 Users submit segments of videos and choose a category for them. Those segments are automatically skipped. When a segment is skipped, a small pop-up appears for a few seconds to allow the user to vote on it or  " unskip "  it. The number of segments each user has submitted and skipped is tracked. < ref name= " ghacks " > {{cite web |last1=Brinkmann |first1=Martin |title=Skip sponsor messages in YouTube videos with SponsorBlock |url=https://www.ghacks.net/2020/01/03/skip-sponsor-messages-in-youtube-videos-with-sponsorblock/ |website=ghacks.net |publisher=Softonic |access-date=December 7, 2020 |date=January 3, 2020 |archive-date=March 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210324140007/https://www.ghacks.net/2020/01/03/skip-sponsor-messages-in-youtube-videos-with-sponsorblock/ |url-status=live }} < /ref >
