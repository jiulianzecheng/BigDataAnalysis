A '''skyrmion''' is an [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] entity in [[atomic physics]] that can occur in some materials like [[solid]]s and [[Boseâ€“Einstein condensate]]s. They are made up from a persistent [[vortex]] that is a [[quantum superposition]] of [[baryon]]s and resonance states. These vortices behave like particles but are not. They are called [[quasiparticles]] and have [[mass]] just like a real particle.   < ref name =  " Champneys " > {{cite book| last = Briain| first = Dara O| title = 50 Visions of Mathematics| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sg8NBAAAQBAJ & pg=PA38| year = 2014| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-870181-1| page = 38 }} < /ref > 
 
 They were first though of mathematically by the British scientist  [[Tony Skyrme]] in 1962 and named after him in 1982. In 2009 physicists from the [[Technical University of Munich]] were able to create and see skyrmions for the first time in a very cold magnetic solid. < ref > {{cite press release|url = http://portal.mytum.de/pressestelle/pressemitteilungen/news_article.2009-02-11.2064891806|title = TUM-Physicists discover new magnetic order: Skyrmion Lattice in a chiral Magnet|first = |last = |date = 2009-02-12|website = |publisher = Technical University of Munich|accessdate = }} < /ref > 
 
 Skyrmions are important in  the emerging solid state technology of [[spintronics]] where they promise [[data storage]] at much higher densities than ever before.
