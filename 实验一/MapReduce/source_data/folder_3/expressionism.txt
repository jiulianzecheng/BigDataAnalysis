''' < span lang= " sq "  dir= " ltr " > Expressionism < /span > ''' is an [[art]] and [[Culture|cultural]] movement of the 20th century. 
 Expressionist artists try to express a feeling with what they create. Colours and shapes are not used in a way people see them, but as the artist feels them.  
 
 Expressionism emerged as an '[[avant-garde]] movement' in poetry and painting before the [[First World War]]. In the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar years]] it was appreciated by a mass audience, < ref name= " ThompsonB " > Bruce Thompson, University of California at Santa Cruz.

 Expressionism presents the world as [[subjective]]: how the artist feels it, not how it is scientifically. The art looks to get an emotional effect, and transmits personal moods and ideas. < ref name= " ThompsonB " / > < ref > Chris Baldick ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', entry for 'Expressionism' < /ref >  Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of  " being alive " < ref name= " VT " > Victorino Tejera 1966.

 Expressionism is exhibited in many [[art]] forms, including: [[painting]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[Movie|film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]]. The term often implies emotional [[angst]]. In a general sense, painters such [[El Greco]] could be called expressionist; in practice, the term is applied only to 20th century works. 
 
 The Expressionist stress on the individual perspective was also a reaction to [[positivism]] and other artistic movements such as [[naturalism]] and [[impressionism]]. < ref > < cite id= " garzanti " > {{cite book |title=Enciclopedia Garzanti della letteratura |last=Garzanti |first=Aldo |authorlink=|year=1974 |origyear=1972 |publisher=Guido Villa |location=Milan |isbn= |pages=|language=Italian}} < /cite >  p241 < /ref > 
 
 Typical modern expressionists are [[Edvard Munch]] (''The Scream''), [[August Macke]], [[Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Marc Chagall]],  and others. The [[First World War]], with the many young men who died, left deep impressions on artists' minds.
