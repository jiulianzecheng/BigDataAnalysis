 '''Donauparkhalle''' was an indoor ice rink in Vienna-[[Donaustadt]] in [[Austria]]. It was originally built as an expo venue in 1964, next to an earlier landfill in [[Donaupark]] near [[Kaisermühlen]], to be used for the garden-themed exhibition Wiener [[Internationale Gartenschau]]. Two years later, it was rebuilt into an indoor ice rink. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2012-12-14|title=ASBÖ Floridsdorf-Donaustadt - Die Erfolgsstory|url=http://www.samariter.at/ueber_uns/ueber_uns_detail/article/asboe-floridsdorf-donaustadt-die-erfolgsstory/?cHash=8eca3e0e11|access-date=2022-04-12|website=web.archive.org|archive-date=2012-12-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214100733/http://www.samariter.at/ueber_uns/ueber_uns_detail/article/asboe-floridsdorf-donaustadt-die-erfolgsstory/?cHash=8eca3e0e11|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >  During the [[1966/1967 Austrian Hockey League|1966/1967]] season, [[Wiener EV]] played its first home games inside. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Wiener Eislöwen / WE-V|url=http://www.wiener-eisloewen.at/wp/?page_id=273|access-date=2022-04-12|language=de-DE}} < /ref >  Later, it was used as home venue for the Vienna club [[WAT Stadlau]]. The venue was popular for its acoustics. The venue was demolished following the [[1990/1991 Austrian Hockey League|1990/1991]] season. In the early 1990's, the area was planned to be used for the 1995 world exhebition that was never hosted.
