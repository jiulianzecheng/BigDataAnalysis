 '''XHTML''' stands for '''eXtensible HyperText Markup Language'''. It is markup used to design [[website]]s and [[webpage]]s. 
 
 XHTML is much more strict than ordinary [[HTML]], and is based on both [[XML]] and HTML. Due to the lax nature of HTML, different [[web browser]]s can sometimes display websites incorrectly since there is more than one way to interpret poorly written HTML. The strict and formal nature of XHTML, once fully adopted will allow for [[web browser]]s to display the same page correctly between them. Proper XHTML is also easier to read for humans. 
 
 For example, the below code shows one of the differences between HTML and XHTML: 
 
 Incorrect, HTML version: 
 < syntaxhighlight lang= " html4strict " > 
 < br > 
 < /syntaxhighlight > 
 
 Correct, XHTML version: 
 < syntaxhighlight lang= " html4strict " > 
 < br / > 
 < /syntaxhighlight > 
 
 The line break tag in HTML does not have a closing tag, you just type it once and it creates a line break. In XHTML the rule is that tags that do not have an closing tag must close themselves within the initial tag. These tags are called  " empty tags. "  Another empty tag is  < tt > < span style= " color:green " > & lt; < /span > '''hr''' & nbsp; < span style= " color:green; " > / & gt; < /span > < /tt >  which inserts a  " horizontal rule "  or dividing line. 
 
 == JavaScript Differences == 
 In XHTML, using  < code > innerHTML < /code >  is not  " allowed " .  
 XHTML also should not be used together with the JavaScript  < code > document.write < /code >  command.
