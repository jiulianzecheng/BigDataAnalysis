 The '''Brontotheriidae''', also called '''Titanotheriidae''', is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[extinct]] [[mammal]]s belonging to the order [[Perissodactyla]]. This is the order that includes [[horse]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, and [[tapir]]s. On the outside, Brontotheres looked rather like [[rhino]]s, but they were actually more closely related to [[horse]]s. They lived around 56â€“34 million years ago, until the end of the [[Eocene]]. 
 
 Later brontotheres were huge, up to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in height with bizarre horn-like [[skull]] appendages.
