 == Early life == 
 Aemilianus was [[Birth|born]] around 207 or around 214. The ''[[Epitome de Caesaribus]]'' (a [[Latin]] history) and [[Zonaras]] (a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] historian) say that Aemilianus was born at this time and at [[Djerba]], an island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], part of the [[Roman Empire]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Aemilianus was not from the [[nobility]], and may have been from among the [[Moorish]] people. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 Aemilianus was a [[Roman Senate|senator]] and was a [[Roman consul]], either in 252 or 253. He was also governor ({{Lang-la|[[legatus Augusti pro praetore]]}}) for the [[Roman province]] of [[Moesia Superior]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Emperor == 
 The [[Roman army]] made Aemilianus emperor in Moesia in July or August 253. The [[Roman Senate]] agreed that Aemilianus was emperor after the emperor [[Trebonianus Gallus]] died in August 253. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 After defeating the [[Goths]] (a barbarian tribe) in modern-day Bulgaria, his soldiers proclaimed him as an emperor instead of Trebonianus Gallus, the emperor at the time. After defeating Gallus in battle at [[Interamna]] (Northern [[Italy]]), he captured the capital city of the empire, Rome.{{Cn|date=April 2021}} 
 
 When the governor of [[Roman Germany]], [[Valerianus]], arrived in Italy bringing troops to help Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilianus's own troops killed Aemilianus. They did not want a civil war and Valerian had a bigger army than Aemilianus.{{Cn|date=April 2021}} 
 
 == Death == 
 Soldiers in Aemilianus's army [[killed]] Aemilianus at Spoletum in the Italian Peninsula ([[Spoleto]], [[Italy]]). < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 == Family == 
 Aemilianus's wife was [[Cornelia Supera]]. She became ''augusta'' ([[empress]]) in around August 253. Cornelia Supera may have died in September or October 253, at which time the soldiers killed Aemilianus. < ref name= " :0 "  / >
