 '''Lianas''' are [[vines]] which live in [[rainforest]]s. They are [[climbing plants]] which are rooted in the ground. Then they wrap around [[tree]]s as they grow. [[Rain forests]] have them everywhere there are trees.  
 
 The term  " liana "  refers to the vine, not the tree. It is not a taxonomic group: many plants have adopted this growth-mode.
