 The '''rails''', or '''Rallidae''', are a large [[Family (biology)|family]] of small to medium-sized [[bird]]s. The rails are related to [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], and both are in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Gruiformes]]. 
 
 The family is [[Biodiversity|diverse]], and includes the [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s, and [[gallinule]]s. Many species are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, polar regions and alpine areas above the snow line. The Rallidae are found on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. There are numerous island species. The most common habitats are [[marsh]]land or dense [[forest]]. They like dense vegetation. < Hor/ > 
 
 There are many rails on islands, and they are often [[Flightless birds|flightless]]. 
 
 ==Flight and flightlessness== 
 The wings of all rails are short and rounded. Their [[bird flight|flight]] is not powerful, but can continue for long periods, and many species [[migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight means they are easily blown off course, so they are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]]. This has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense [[shrub]] or [[woodland]] habitats. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] period. < ref name=Hor > Horsfall, Joseph A.  &  Robinson, Robert 2003. Rails. In: Perrins, Christopher (ed) ''Firefly encyclopedia of birds''. Firefly Books, p209 < /ref > 
 
 Many island rails are flightless because on a small island without threatening predators they do not need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight. Reducing the flight muscles lowers the [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, and reduces the flightless rail's energy needs. < ref > McNab B.K.  &  Ellis H.I. 2006. Flightless rails endemic to islands have lower energy expenditures and clutch sizes than flighted rails on islands and continents.

 < /ref >  Flightlessness can evolve extremely rapidly in island rails; it took as little as 125,000 years for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly. < ref > Slikas B; Olson, Storrs L.  &  Fleischer R.C. 2002.
