 '''''Brachylophosaurus''''' was a mid-sized herbivorous [[dinosaur]], a member of the [[hadrosaur]] family. It is known from several [[skeleton]]s and bonebed material from the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]] (U.S.) and the Oldman Formation of [[Alberta]] province in [[Canada]]. < ref name= " HWF04 " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dinosauriandedit00weis|title=The Dinosauria|last=Horner, John R.|author2=Weishampel, David B.|last3=Forster, Catherine A|publisher=University of California Press|year=2004|isbn=0-520-24209-2|editor=Weishampel, David B.|edition=2nd|location=Berkeley|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosauriandedit00weis/page/438 438]–463|chapter=Hadrosauridae|editor-last2=Osmólska, Halszka|editor-last3=Dodson, Peter}} < /ref >  They lived about 81{{ndash}}76.7 million years ago. < ref name= " ABS09 " > {{cite journal|last=Arbour|first=V.M.|author2=Burns, M.E.|last3=Sissons, R.L.|year=2009|title=A redescription of the ankylosaurid dinosaur ''Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus'' Parks, 1924 (Ornithischia: Ankylosauria) and a revision of the genus|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1117–1135|doi=10.1671/039.029.0405|s2cid=85665879}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Description== 
 This animal had a bony crest, a flat, paddle-like plate over the top of the [[skull]]. < ref name=age > Brachylophosaurus. In: Dodson, Peter ''et al'' ''The Age of Dinosaurs''. Publications International. p. 134. {{ISBN|0-7853-0443-6}} < /ref >   Some individuals had crests that covered nearly the entire skull roof, while others had shorter, narrower crests. < ref name=APM05 > {{cite journal |last=Prieto-Marquez |first=Alberto |year=2005 |title=New information on the cranium of ''Brachylophosaurus'', with a revision of its phylogenetic position |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=144–156 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0144:NIOTCO]2.0.CO;2|s2cid=85767827 }} < /ref > < ref name=JAH75 > {{cite journal |last=Hopson |first=James A. |year=1975 |title=The evolution of cranial display structures in hadrosaurian dinosaurs |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_paleobiology_winter-1975_1_1/page/21 |journal=Paleobiology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–43 |doi=10.1017/S0094837300002165 |s2cid=88689241 }} < /ref > < ref name= " WH90 " > {{cite book|title=The Dinosauria|url=https://archive.org/details/dinosauria0000unse_k1f9|last=Weishampel|first=David B.|author2=Horner, Jack R.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=0-520-06727-4|editor=Weishampel, David B.|edition=1st|location=Berkeley|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosauria0000unse_k1f9/page/534 534]–561|chapter=Hadrosauridae|editor-last2=Osmólska, Halszka|editor-last3=Dodson, Peter}} < /ref >   Other notable features are the unusually long forelimbs and the beak of the upper jaw being wider than other hadrosaurs of the time. < ref name=age/ > 
 
 === Teeth === 
 Otherwise, ''Brachylophosaurus'' was a typical hadrosaur. It reached an adult length of 9 & nbsp;meters (30 & nbsp;ft). < ref name=age/ >  Like other hadrosaurs, ''Brachylophosaurus'' had cheeks to keep food in the mouth while it chewed with its hundreds of close-fitting teeth. < ref name=age/ >  These teeth could be used to chew efficiently. < ref name=age/ >  This feature is rare among reptiles, but common among [[ornithischia]] like ''Brachylophosaurus''. 
 
 === Tumours === 
 In 2003, evidence of [[tumor]]s, including [[metastatic cancer]], was discovered in fossilized ''Brachylophosaurus'' skeletons. Rothschild and co-workers tested dinosaur [[vertebra]]e for tumors using computerized [[tomography]] and [[fluoroscope]] screening. Several other hadrosaurs, including ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''Gilmoreosaurus'', and ''Bactrosaurus'', also tested positive. Although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to ''Brachylophosaurus'' and closely related genera. The reason for this is not known. < ref name= " Rothschildetal " > {{Cite journal|last1=Rothschild|first1=B. M.|last2=Tanke|first2=D. H.|last3=Helbling|first3=M.|last4=Martin|first4=L.
