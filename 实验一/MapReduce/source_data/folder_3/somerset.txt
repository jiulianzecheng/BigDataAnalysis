 '''Somerset''' is a [[county]] in [[South West England]]. 
 
 The main town of Somerset was [[Somerton]], but it is now [[Taunton]]. There are two [[city|cities]] in Somerset. They are [[Bath (city)|Bath]] and [[Wells]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 < !-- possibly also add content from [[:en:History of Somerset]]? -- > 
 The name  " Somerset "  comes from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] phrase ''Sumorsaete,'' which was used to describe people from Somerton. 
 
 In the past, the [[north]]ern [[border]] of Somerset was the [[River Avon]]. However, as the city of [[Bristol]] has grown, the border moved [[south]]. 
 
 In [[1974]] parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south [[Gloucestershire]] were joined into a new county. This county was named [[Avon (county)|Avon]]. In [[1996]] Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named [[North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]]) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own [[council]]s. 
 
 The oldest [[prison]] in [[England]] which is still used is in a town named [[Shepton Mallet]] in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the [[Sweet Track]]; it was built in about [[3800 BC]]. 
 
 ==Industry and tourism== 
 [[Image:Somerset.dunster.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Dunster]] [[Yarn]] [[Market]] was built in 1609 for the [[trade|trading]] of local [[cloth]]]] 
 There is not much large [[industry]] in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a [[port]], and Yeovil is important in building [[helicopter]]s. 
 
 [[Tourism]] is an important industry in the county; in [[2001]] about 23,000 people worked in tourism. [[Tourist]]s like Somerset because it is very beautiful, with much countryside and few big towns. Somerset has many places to visit: 
 * Part of the [[Exmoor]] [[National Park]] is in Somerset. 
 * Another popular place is [[Glastonbury]], which has a popular [[music]] [[festival]] every year. 
 * The [[Cheddar Gorge]] has [[cave]]s which are popular with visitors, and locally made [[cheese]]. 
 
 [[Farming]] is an important industry in Somerset, but not as many people work in this industry today. Somerset is famous for its [[cider]] (an [[alcohol]]ic [[apple]] drink) and it has many [[apple]] [[grove (nature)|orchard]]s.
