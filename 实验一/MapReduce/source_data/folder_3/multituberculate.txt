 The '''multituberculates''' were a group of [[rodent]]-like [[mammal]]s which survived for about 166 million years – the longest fossil history of any mammal line. < ref name= " Anantharaman et al 2006 " > {{cite journal|last=Anantharaman S. et al. 2006 |title=A possible late Cretaceous  " haramiyidan "  from India |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |year=2006 |volume=26|issue=2|pages=488–490|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[488:APLCHF]2.0.CO;2|s2cid=41722902 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/gpwilson/Reprints/2006%20Anantharaman%20et%20al%20JVP.pdf}} < /ref > < ref name= " Sahni et al 1987 " > {{cite book|authors= Ashok Sahni, R.S.

 They were eventually outcompeted by rodents, becoming extinct during the late [[Eocene]]. < ref > Krause, David W. 1986.

 At least 200 species are known, ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These species occupied many  ecological [[niche]]s, ranging from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree-dwelling. < ref name= " Weil " > {{cite web| url = http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/multis/multis.html| title = Introduction to Multituberculates: the  " lost tribe "  of mammals| first = Anne | last = Weil| publisher = University of California Museum of Paleontology | location = Berkeley| date = 1997 }} < /ref >   
 
 Multituberculates are usually placed outside both the two main groups of living mammals, the [[Theria]] ([[Eutheria|placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s), and [[Monotremata|monotremes]]. Some [[cladistics|cladistic]] analyses put them closer to Theria than to monotremes. < ref > Benton, Michael J. 2004. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''.

 The multituberculates had a head anatomy similar to rodents. They had cheek-teeth separated from the chisel-like front teeth by a wide tooth-less gap (called the ''diastema''). Each cheek-tooth displayed several rows of small cusps (or [[tubercle]]s, hence the name) which worked against similar rows in the teeth of the jaw. It was an efficient chopping device. 
 
 Most small multituberculates would have eaten [[seed]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], supplemented with [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s, and [[fruit]]. 
 
 The structure of the [[pelvis]] in the Multituberculata suggests that they gave birth to tiny helpless young, similar to modern [[marsupial]]s. < ref name= " Weil "  / > < ref > Kielan-Jaworowska, Zofia, Richard L.
