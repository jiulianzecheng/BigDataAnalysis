 == Etymology == 
 The name ''Talossa'' comes from the Finnish word ''talossa'', meaning  " inside the house "  (that is, the root ''talo'' meaning house or building, in the inessive case). It was selected by the country's founder, Robert Ben Madison, because it described the kingdom's territorial claim (then limited to his bedroom).
