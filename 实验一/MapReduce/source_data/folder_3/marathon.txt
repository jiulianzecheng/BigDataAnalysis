 [[File:1896 Olympic marathon.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The first Olympic Marathon race of 1896.]]The famous [[battle of Marathon]] was fought in 490 B.C. An army from [[Persia]] came to fight the army of [[Athens]]. The army from Athens was not expected to win, but they did. After the victory, they sent their best runner, a man named Pheidippides back to Athens to tell everyone the good news. He ran about 25 miles and died of exhaustion when he arrived. 
 
 In 1896 the first modern [[Olympics]] was held. There was a race called the Marathon there. It was only about 25 miles (40 & nbsp;km) then. < ref name= " marathon-world.com " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.marathon-world.com/index.php |title=Marathon World Forum |access-date=2011-02-03 |archive-date=2010-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324064043/http://www.marathon-world.com/index.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
