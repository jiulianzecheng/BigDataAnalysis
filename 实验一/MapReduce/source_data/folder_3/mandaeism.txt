'''Mandaeism''' or '''Mandaeanism''' is a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]. The religion has a  strong [[Dualism|dualistic]] world view.  Its followers, the '''Mandaeans''',  think highly of [[Adam]], [[Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (Bible)|Enosh]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]] and especially [[John the Baptist]]. it is also called Nasoraeanism. 
 
 Originally, Mandaeism was practiced mainly in the countries around the lower [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and the rivers that surround the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] waterway. Today, this area belongs to [[Iraq]] and [[Khuzestan Province]] in [[Iran]]. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide. < ref name= " yaledailynews " > [http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053439/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341|date=2007-10-25}}, Kai Thaler, ''Yale Daily News'', [[March 9]], [[2007]]. < /ref >  Until the [[Iraq war|2003 Iraq war]], almost all of them lived in [[Iraq]]. < ref name= " DEUTSCH " > [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06deutsch.html  " Save the Gnostics " ] by Nathaniel Deutsch, October 6, 2007, ''New York Times.'' < /ref >   Because they were [[persecution|persecuted]] in that area, < ref name= " ai2005 " > [http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/irn-summary-eng Iran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313232527/http://web.amnesty.org/report2005/irn-summary-eng |date=2007-03-13 }}, [[Amnesty International]] report, 2005. < /ref >  many Mandaeans left  and now live abroad.

 The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private—what has been reported of them and their religion has come primarily from outsiders, particularly from the [[Orientalist]]s J. Heinrich Petermann, Nicholas Siouffi, and [[E. S. Drower|Lady Ethel Drower]]. 
 
 ==Mandaean beliefs== 
 Mandeism is the religion of the Mandaean people. It is based on a common [[history]] and [[heritage]]. There is no fixed set of religious [[creed]]s and [[doctrine]]s. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The [[corpus]] of Mandaean literature is quite large. It also covers topics such as [[eschatology]], the knowledge of [[God]], and the [[afterlife]]. It only does this in an unsystematic manner. Apart from the [[priest]]s, very few people know it.   
 
 ===Basic beliefs=== 
 According to E.S. Drower, the Mandaean [[Gnosticism|Gnosis]] is characterized by nine features, which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects: < ref > {{Citation | last =Drower | first =Ethel Stephana | author-link =E. S. Drower | publication-date =1960 | title =The secret Adam, a study of Nasoraean gnosis | publication-place =London UK | publisher =Clarendon Press | page =xvi}} < /ref > 
 # There is a supreme entity without form. It expressed itself by creating a number of spiritual, etheric, and material worlds and beings. There is a Creator which came from it, and produced all these worlds and beings. The [[cosmos]] was created by [[Archetype|Archetypal]] Man, who produced it in his own shape. 
 # [[Dualism]]: a cosmic Father and Mother, Light and Darkness, Right and Left, [[syzygy]] in cosmic and microcosmic form. 
 # As a feature of this dualism, counter-types, a world of ideas. 
 # The [[soul]] is portrayed as an exile, a captive: her home and origin is the supreme Entity to which she eventually returns. 
 # Planets and stars influence [[destiny|fate]] and human beings, and are also places of detention after death. 
 # A saviour spirit or saviour spirits which assist the soul on her journey through life and after it to 'worlds of light'. 
 # A cult-language of [[symbol]] and [[metaphor]]. Ideas and qualities are personified. 
 # 'Mysteries', i.e. [[sacrament]]s to help and purify the soul, to ensure her [[rebirth]] into a spiritual body, and her ascent from the world of matter.  These are often adaptations of existing seasonal and traditional rites to which an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] interpretation is attached.  In the case of the [[Nasorean|Na{{unicode|ṣ}}oreans]] this interpretation is based on the Creation story (see 1 and 2), especially on the Divine Man, Adam, as crowned and anointed King-priest. 
 # [[Esotericism|Great secrecy]] is enjoined upon initiates; full explanation of 1, 2, and 8 is reserved for those considered able to understand and preserve the gnosis. 
 
 Mandaeans believe in [[marriage]] and [[procreation]], and in the importance of leading an [[ethics|ethical]] and moral lifestyle in this world. They put a high priority on family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice [[celibacy]] or [[asceticism]]. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and [[red meat]]. They look forward to a future liberated from the influence of the [[Torah]], which they consider to be evil in origin. While they agree with other [[gnostic]] sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary [[archons]], they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one. 
 
 ===Mandaean religious texts=== 
 The Mandaeans have many religious [[text]]s. The most important of them is the ''[[Ginza Rba|Genzā Rabbā]]'' or Ginza. The Ginza is a collection of [[history]], [[theology]], and [[prayer]]s.  The ''Genzā Rabbā'' is divided into two halves — the ''Genzā Smālā'' or  " Left Ginza "  and the ''Genzā Yeminā'' or  " Right Ginza " .  
 
 Before the [[printing press]] was invented, people copied texts by hand. The people doing this were called [[scribe]]s. Each person's [[handwriting]] is special in certain ways. This was the same with scribes. A scribe might join two letters in a certain way, or he might do the dots on those letters that have them in a special way. Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza. That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late [[Arsacid]] period at the very latest. A [[legend]] called  ''Harrān Gāwe < u > t < /u > ā'' also strengthens this. According to this legend, the Mandaeans left [[Palestine]] after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire.  Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the [[Sassanians]] and the Islamic empires, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity. 
 
 Other important books include the ''[[Qolusta|Qolastā]]'', the  " Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans, "  which was translated by [[E.S. Drower]].  One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the ''Draša  < u > d < /u > -[[John the Baptist|Iahia]]''  " the Book of John the Baptist " . This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates.  There are also many other religious texts such as ritual commentaries, which are generally only consulted by the members of the priesthood. 
 
 The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as [[Mandaic]], and is a member of the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] family of dialects. It is written in a [[cursive script|cursive]] variant of the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] chancellory script. Most Mandaean lay people do not speak this language. Some members of the Mandaean community in Iran ( about 300-500 out of a total of about 5000 Iranian Mandaeans) continue to speak [[Mandaic language|Neo-Mandaic]], a modern version of this language. 
 
 ===Chief prophets=== 
 
 Mandaeans have several prophets. [[Yahya ibn Zakariyya|Iahia]] or Iuhana  " John the Baptist "  has a special status, higher than his role in [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion. They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers. They trace their beliefs back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]. 
 
 Mandaeans maintain that Jesus was a ''mšiha kdaba''  " false [[messiah]] "  who changed the teachings given to him by John. The Mandaic word ''k(a)daba'', however, comes  from two roots: the first root, meaning  " to lie, "  is the one traditionally given to Jesus; the second, meaning  " to write, "  might provide a second meaning, that of  " book " . Some Mandaeans, who are motivated perhaps by an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a  " lying Messiah "  but a  " book Messiah " . The  " book "  in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk [[etymology]] without support in the Mandaean texts. < ref name= " Jesus " > {{cite book

  | title = Handbook of Classical and Modern Mandaic 
  | publisher = De Gruyter  &  Co. 
  | location = Berlin 
  | pages = 61 fn. 105}} < /ref > 
 
 The Mandaeans believe that [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], and [[Muhammad]] were false [[prophet]]s, but recognize other prophetic figures from the [[monotheistic]] traditions, such as Adam, his sons Hibil ([[Abel]]) and Šitil ([[Seth]]), and his grandson Anuš ([[Enos (biblical figure)|Enosh]]), as well as Nuh ([[Noah]]), his son Sam ([[Shem]]) and his son Ram ([[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]]). The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors. 
 
 ===Priests and laymen=== 
 There is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests.  According to E.S. Drower (''The Secret Adam'', p. ix): 
 :[T]hose amongst the community who possess secret knowledge are called ''Na{{unicode|ṣ}}uraiia'' - Na{{unicode|ṣ}}oreans (or, if the heavy '{{unicode|ṣ}}' is written as 'z', Nazorenes).  At the same time the ignorant or semi-ignorant laity are called 'Mandaeans', ''Mandaiia'' - 'gnostics'.  When a man becomes a priest he leaves 'Mandaeanism' and enters ''tarmiduta'', 'priesthood'.  Even then he has not attained to true enlightenment, for this, called 'Na{{unicode|ṣ}}iruta', is reserved for a very few.  Those possessed of its secrets may call themselves Na{{unicode|ṣ}}oreans, and 'Na{{unicode|ṣ}}orean' today indicates not only one who observes strictly all rules of ritual purity, but one who understands the secret doctrine. 
 
 There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the ''tarmidia''  " disciples "  (Neo-Mandaic ''tarmidānā''), the ''ganzibria''  " treasurers "  (from [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''ganza-bara''  " id. " , Neo-Mandaic ''{{unicode|ganzeḇrānā}}'') and the ''rišamma''  " leader of the people. "   This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years.  At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ''{{unicode|ganzeḇrā}}'', a title which appears first in a religious context in the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ritual texts from [[Persepolis]] ( 3rd century BCE) and which may be related to the ''kamnaskires'' ([[Elamite]]  < qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra >  ''kapnuskir''  " treasurer " ), title of the rulers of [[Elymais]] (modern [[Khuzestan]]) during the [[Hellenistic]] age. Traditionally, any ''{{unicode|ganzeḇrā}}'' who baptizes seven or more ''{{unicode|ganzeḇrānā}}'' may qualify for the office of ''rišamma'', though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate. 
 
 The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19 < sup > th < /sup >  century.  In 1831, an outbreak of [[cholera]] devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (''šgandia''), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them. 
 
 ==Related groups== 
 According to the ''Fihrist'' of [[ibn al-Nadim]], [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], the founder of [[Manichaeism]], was brought up within the [[Elcesaites|Elkasaites]] (''Elcesaites'' or ''Elchasaite'') [[sect]]. The Elkasaites were a Christian [[baptismal]] sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans. The members of this sect wore white and performed [[baptism]]s like the Mandaeans. They lived in east [[Judea]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]]. According to the ''Harran Gawai < u > t < /u > ā'' legend, the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there. Mani  left the Elkasaites to start his own religion. Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg showed that Mani's ''Psalms of Thomas'' were closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that [[Mani]] had access to Mandaean religious literature. 
 
 Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the  " [[Nasoraeans]] " , described by [[Epiphanius]], and the [[Dositheans]], mentioned by [[Theodore Bar Kōnī]] in his ''Scholion''.  [[Ibn al-Nadim]] also mentions a group called the ''Mughtasila'',  " the self-ablutionists, "  who may be identified with one or the other of these groups.  The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. 
 
 It is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites, the Mughtasila, the Nasoraeans, and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another. The names say that there are a number of different groups. Much of the teaching of these groups is secret. This makes it difficult to see the nature of these groups or the relationships between them. 
 
 ==Mandaeans today== 
 ===Persecution=== 
 Under [[Saddam Hussein]], the Mandeans were recognised as a religious [[minority]]. Many of them are [[Craft|craftspeople]], like [[Smith (metalwork)|smiths]] or [[trader]]s of [[gold]] and [[silver]]. These people belonged to the [[Middle class|middle classes]]. Since the change of government in Iraq, [[Islam|islamic extremist]]s have [[Harassment|harassed]] them. There are also reports of [[attack]]s on women who refuse to [[veil]] themselves.  Most Iraqi Mandaeans have fled as a result, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces [[extinction]]. < ref name= " bbc0307 "  / > < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618100356/http://www.genocidewatch.org/news/IraqGenocideWatchMandaeansofIraq.htm Genocide Watch: Mandaeans of Iraq < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > 
 
 In [[Iran]], Mandeans do not have a problem with violence, but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of  ''Gozinesh'' Law.  This law and other ''gozinesh'' provisions require a ''religious screening'' for people who want to  access employment, education, and a range of other areas. A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam. < ref > [http://www.roozonline.com/english/archives/2007/06/005324.php Ideological Screening (ROOZ :: English) < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >   These laws are regularly applied to [[discrimination|discriminate]] against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans. < ref name= " ai2005 "  / > 
 
 ===Many left because of the Iraq War=== 
 There were over  60,000 Mandaeans in [[Iraq]] in the early 1990s. In 2007, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; over 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were [[refugee]]s in [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]]. This is a result of the [[Iraq War]].  There are small Mandaean populations in [[Australia]] (c. 3,500 as of 2006), [[Canada]], the [[United States of America|USA]] (c. 1,500), the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (c. 1,000) and [[Sweden]] (c. 5,000). < ref name= " bbc0307 "  / > < ref name= " newmarker " > [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/09/AR2007020901687_pf.html Survival of Ancient Faith Threatened by Fighting in Iraq], Chris Newmarker, Associated Press.

ABC Radio National (Australia), June 7, 2006. < /ref > 
 
 The current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community.  In 2007, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an [[op-ed]] in which [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] professor [[Nathaniel Deutsch]] called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community:{{Quotation| < small > The United States didn't set out to eradicate the Mandeans, one of the oldest, smallest and least understood of the many minorities in Iraq. This extinction in the making has simply been another unfortunate and entirely [[unintended consequence]] of our invasion of Iraq — though that will be of little comfort to the Mandeans, whose 2,000-year-old culture is in grave danger of disappearing from the face of the earth. . . . . When American forces invaded in 2003, there were probably 60,000 Mandeans in Iraq; today, fewer than 5,000 remain. . . . Of the mere 500 Iraqi refugees who were allowed into the United States from April 2003 to April 2007, only a few were Mandeans. And despite the Bush administration’s commitment to let in 7,000 refugees in the fiscal year that ended  < nowiki > [September 30, 2007] < /nowiki > , fewer than 2,000, including just three Iraqi Mandean families, entered the country.  If all Iraqi Mandeans are granted privileged status and allowed to enter the United States in significant numbers, it may just be enough to save them and their ancient culture from destruction. If not, after 2,000 years of history, of persecution and tenacious survival, the last Gnostics will finally disappear, victims of an extinction inadvertently set into motion by our nation’s negligence in Iraq. < /small > |Nathaniel Deutsch, professor of religion, [[Swarthmore College]]|October 7, 2007 < ref name= " DEUTSCH " / > }}
