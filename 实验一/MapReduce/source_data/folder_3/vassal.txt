{{Wiktionary|vassal}} 
 A '''vassal''' during the [[feudalism]] of [[medieval]] [[Europe]], was someone who had shared duties  with a [[lord]]. Usually the vassal provided soldiers to the lord. The lord used his army of soldiers from all of his vassals to protect those vassals. The lord also gave him the piece of land that he held as a [[fiefdom|fief]]. By analogy the term ''vassal'' is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies. 
 
 ==Western vassalage== 
 The development of the ''vassal'', in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of  " lordship " – in French the ''[[seigneur]]''– is one sign that [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] ended and the [[Early Middle Ages]] began. Lordship is the basic social institution as [[Tacitus]] described them in his book ''Germania''. The Roman West experienced them for the first time in the [[Migration Period]]. 
 
 As the system developed in the seventh century, the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves, in some degree of formality, to the authority of a leader, from whom they could expect to be fed, clothed and armed. The quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty. The etymology (where the word came from) of  " vassal "  is from a Celtic word ''gwas''  " boy "  that meant a young male slave, with a Latinised form, ''vassus'' that appeared in [[Salic Law]] (Rouche 1987 p 429), like the way   " [[knight]] "  came from the from  Old English word ''cniht'' and similar words in Frisian and Dutch, all meaning  " lad "  [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=k & p=3].
