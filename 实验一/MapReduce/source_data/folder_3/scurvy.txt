'''Scurvy''' is a [[disease]] (sickness). It is caused by not eating enough [[vitamin C]]. But scurvy can be prevented. It has many [[symptom]]s. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs. Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out. They may [[bleeding|bleed]] from the mouth, nose, and gums ([[mucus membrane]]s). A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see [[Depression (illness)|depression]]). They will not be able to move easily, because their [[joint]]s hurt. 
 
 Scurvy can be easily cured. Oranges and other [[fruit]]s can restore normal vitamin levels. In the past, [[sailor]]s more commonly got scurvy due to being unable to access these foods. Fresh fruit could not be kept for long. The main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and [[vegetable]]s. It is now uncommon. 
 
 ==Signs of scurvy== 
 
 '''At first, a person with scurvy may:''' 
 #Not want to eat (loss of [[appetite]]) 
 #Feel sad ''(slight depression)'' 
 #Lose weight or not get heavier even though they eat a lot 
 #Have loose feces ([[diarrhea]]) 
 #Breathe fast ([[tachypnea]]) 
 #Be hot (have a high body temperature or [[fever]]) 
 
 '''A bit later a person with scurvy may:''' 
 #Feel angry (irritability) 
 #Have pains in the legs (and tenderness) 
 #Find it hard to move (pseudo [[paralysis]]) 
 #Have [[inflammation|swelling]] of the arms and legs 
 #Bleed from the mouth, nose and gums 
 
 == Causes == 
 #Not eating enough food that has vitamin C 
 #Going on a long trip, often at sea, where there is no fresh food 
 #Not having enough food ([[famine]]) 
 #Breaking down the vitamin C by over-cooking (like boiling fruit juice) < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid|title=Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)|first=|last=|date=2013-07-16|website=Medical Reference Guide|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|access-date=2016-04-10}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 
 #Eating vitamin C pills or giving it by needle (injection, also known as a shot). The injection almost always cures scurvy in babies. 
 #Drinking orange juice is another treatment that works in babies. Before vitamin C was discovered this was the only treatment. 
 
 When a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly. Babies start eating again after one or two days of help. The [[symptom]]s get better within seven days. 
 
 ==Food sources== 
 
 Eating vitamin C [[wikt: prevent|prevents]] scurvy. How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for [[pregnancy|pregnant]] and [[breast|lactating]] women. The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council's advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day: 
 
 * Infants (babies): 30–40 & nbsp;mg  
 * Children and adults: 45–60 & nbsp;mg  
 * Pregnant women: 70 & nbsp;mg  
 * Mothers breast feeding: 90–95 & nbsp;mg 
 
 Foods with a lot of vitamin C include the following:
