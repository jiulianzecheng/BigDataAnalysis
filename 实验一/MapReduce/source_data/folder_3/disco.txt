 '''Disco''' is a style of [[music]] that was most [[Popularity|popular]] from the mid-[[1970s]] to the early [[1980s]], featuring African-American and Latino musicians and audiences, and in private dance parties thrown in the underground gay community of New York. People usually [[dance]] to disco music at bars called [[discoth√®ques|disco clubs]]. The word  " disco "  is also used to refer to the style of dancing that people do to disco music, or to the style of clothes that people wear to go disco dancing. Disco music was an up-tempo form of music which included elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and Latin music. It had a strong beat meant for dancing, a steady four-on-the-floor rhythm, and a big bass line, and orchestral instrumentation often included [[string instrument|string]] sections. Disco is [[dance music]] too. 
 
 Disco was at its most popular in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] in the late [[1970s]] and early 1980s. Disco was brought into the mainstream by the hit movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' which was released in 1977. This movie, which starred [[John Travolta]], showed people doing disco dancing. Many radio stations played disco in the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, disco had started to fall out of popularity, and other genres, such as dance, Hi-NRG and [[post-disco]] grew in popularity. Nevertheless, disco still exerts an influence on modern day dance music, and still has occasional moments of popularity. Additionally, a different form of disco arose in Europe, known as [[Euro disco]], which obtained some popularity.
