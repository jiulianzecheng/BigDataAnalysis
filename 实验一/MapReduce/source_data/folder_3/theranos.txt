 '''Theranos''' is a bankrupt [[United States|American]] technology [[corporation]] in the field of medical services. It was founded in 2003 by a 19-year-old [[Elizabeth Holmes]]. It is considered a big [[scam]]. For a long time, the founders advertised their startup as a breakthrough technology company. They claimed to have developed blood tests that needed only small amounts of blood. The tests could be passed very quickly with the help of compact automated devices developed by the company. Later the statements turned out to be untrue. In 2018, the company was declared bankrupt. Founder [[Elizabeth Holmes]] is under investigation. She was fined and banned from running any company for 10 years. < ref > {{Cite magazine|last=Bilton|first=Nick|title=Exclusive: How Elizabeth Holmes's House of Cards Came Tumbling Down|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive|access-date=2021-02-20|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=6 September 2016 |language=en-us}} < /ref >
