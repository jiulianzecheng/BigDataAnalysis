The '''mica''' group of minerals are alumino[[silicate minerals|silicate]]s with various metals. They split into fine sheets, which puts them in the [[silicate mineral|phyllosilicate]] group of silicate minerals. 
 
 Mica includes several closely related materials having perfect basal cleavage.  
 
 All are monoclinic which means their [[crystal]]s are shaped like one kind of [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]. They tend towards pseudo-hexagonal [[crystal]]s and are similar in chemical composition. The highly perfect cleavage, which is the most prominent characteristic of mica, is explained by the [[hexagon]]al sheet-like arrangement of its [[atom]]s. 
 
 Being excellent [[electrical insulator]]s, they are used in electronic equipment including [[capacitor]]s.
