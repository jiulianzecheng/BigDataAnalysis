 '''Dreamlinux''' was a [[Linux distribution]], a collection of [[computer program]]s that is designed for the use of the [[Linux]] [[operating system]] on a computer.  The Dreamlinux distribution was made in [[Brazil]], and is based on [[Debian]], another commonly-used Linux distribution.  Dreamlinux can be used in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. 
 
 ==Methods of booting== 
 
 There are several ways to use Dreamlinux to run the Linux operating system on a computer. 
 * Using a compact disc called a [[live CD]], the computer user can start up (or [[boot]]) the operating system straight from the disc without [[install]]ing anything on the computer. 
 * The user can boot Dreamlinux in the same way from an external [[flash drive]] containing the programs, connected to the computer through a [[USB port]]. 
 * The user can install the programs in Dreamlinux on a computer's internal [[hard drive]] and run them from there. 
 
 ==Graphical User Interface== 
 Most operating systems have a [[graphical user interface]], or GUI{{original research inline}}, which allows the user to interact with the programs using a graphical display.  The [[GUI]] which Dreamlinux uses looks similar to the one used by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X]] operating system, with a toolbar in the center.  The user can also download the  " Engage "  theme, which gives the toolbar some animated aspects.
