 A '''minicomputer''' is a type of [[computer]] that possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size. < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/electronictechno0000esta|title=Electronic technology, corporate strategy, and world transformation|last=Estabrooks|first=Maurice|date=1995|publisher=Westport, Conn. : Quorum Books|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-313-00850-4}} < /ref > 
 
 A minicomputer fills the space between the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[microcomputer]], and is smaller than the former but larger than the latter. It also has a [[computer terminal]] to operate the computer. 
 
 Minicomputers are mainly used as small or mid-range servers operating business and scientific applications. However, the use of the term minicomputer has diminished and has merged with servers. 
 
 A minicomputer may also be called a mid-range computer.
