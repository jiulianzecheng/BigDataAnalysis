 '''Biotechnology''' is a [[technology]] that involves the use of [[organism|living organisms]]. < ref name=igcse > {{cite book|title=Edexcel IGCSE Biology Revision Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsebiol0000full|first=Ann|last=Fullick|publisher=Pearson Education|page=[https://archive.org/details/edexceligcsebiol0000full/page/85 85]|date=2011|isbn=9780435046767|edition=First}} < /ref >  Biotechnology is mainly used in [[agriculture]], [[food science]], and [[medicine]]. In biotechnology, living organisms are used to make useful [[chemical]]s and products or to perform an industrial task. < ref name=igcse / > 
 == Examples == 
 An example of biotechnology is the use of the [[fermentation]] reaction in [[yeast]] to make [[beer]] and other [[alcohol]]ic drinks. < ref name=igcse / >  Another example is the use of [[carbon dioxide]] produced by yeast to make [[bread]] rise. < ref name=igcse / > 
 == Usage == 
 Biotechnology is often used to refer to genetic engineering technology of the 21st century. < ref > Rasmussen, Nicolas 2014. ''Gene jockeys: life science and the rise of biotech enterprise''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. < /ref >  However, the term is used for many ways of modifying biological organisms for the needs of [[humanity]]. It started with modifications of native plants into improved food crops through artificial selection and hybridization. Bioengineering is the science upon which all biotechnological applications are based. With the [[development]] of new approaches and modern techniques, traditional biotechnology industries are also acquiring new horizons enabling them to improve the quality of their products and increase the productivity of their systems. 
 
 Biotechnology has also made [[clone|cloning]] (the process duplicating organisms) possible. A lot of people think that this is [[moral]]ly wrong while others think it could solve many [[disease]]s. 
 
 Biotechnology can be used to solve a great number of problems, < ref > Oliver, Richard W. ''The coming biotech age''. {{ISBN|0-07-135020-9}} < /ref >  ranging from product efficiency to reducing [[global warming]].
