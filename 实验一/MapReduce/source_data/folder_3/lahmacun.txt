 '''Lahmacun''', also spelled '''Lahmajoon''', is a [[Middle East]]ern dish.  
 
 The name Lahmacun comes from Arabic (لحم بعجين  " lahma bi'ajeen " ) meaning meat and [[dough]]. Lahmacun is often described as '''Turkish Pizza''' or '''Armenian Pizza''' but it is not a pizza because it doesn’t have cheese on it. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://travelfoodatlas.com/lahmacun-turkish-pizza-recipe | title=Lahmacun Turkish Pizza Recipe (Or Armenian Pizza)  & #124; Travel Food Atlas | date=2 March 2021 }} < /ref > 
 
 Lahmacun is topped with minced meat with herbs and spices and cooked in a clay oven. It can be wrapped around like a [[burrito]] with salad inside or eaten as a flat bread. < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.bonappeteach.com/keto-armenian-pizzas-lahmajun/ | title=Keto Armenian Pizzas (Lahmajun) | date=18 April 2018 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Armenian+pizza | title=Armenian pizza }} < /ref >
