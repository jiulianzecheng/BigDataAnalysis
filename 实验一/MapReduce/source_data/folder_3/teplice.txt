 '''Teplice'''  ([[Germany|German]] name: '''Teplitz''') is a city in [[Bohemia]], the western area of the [[Czech Republic]].  Teplice (pronounced in [[Czech language|Czech]]: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous [[spa]] town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their [[health]].  [[Goethe]], [[Beethoven]], [[Chopin]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]] all stayed there. 
 
 Teplice lies between [[Prague]] and [[Dresden]] in a [[mountain]] area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains).  In the year [[762]] hot [[spring]]s were found there.  The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town. 
 
 Since [[1990]] many buildings have been restored.  The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished.  The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air.  There is a [[museum]] and many [[restaurant]]s, [[wine]] [[Bar (business)|bars]] and [[café]]s.  In the winter the mountain slopes are good for [[skiing]].
