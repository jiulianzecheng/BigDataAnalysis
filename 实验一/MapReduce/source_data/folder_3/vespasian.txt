 '''Vespasian''' (Titus Flavius Vespasianus, 17 November 9 AD – 23 June 79), < ref name=Levick > Barbara Levick 1999. ''Vespasian''. Roman Imperial Biographies, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-16618-7}} (hbk). {{ISBN|0-415-33866-2}} (pbk 2005) < /ref >  was [[Roman Emperor]] from 69 AD to 79. 
 
 Vespasian was the founder of the [[Flavian dynasty]] which ruled the empire for 27 years. Although he held the [[Roman consul|consulship]] in 51 AD, Vespasian became more highly regarded as a successful military commander. He took part in the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43 AD, < ref name=Levick/ > < sup > p16 < /sup >  and the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish rebellion]] of 66 AD. < ref name=Levick/ > < sup > p29–38 < /sup > 
 
 While Vespasian was preparing to besiege [[Jerusalem]] during the latter campaign, emperor [[Nero]] committed suicide, plunging the empire into a year of [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. After the emperors [[Galba]] and [[Otho]] died in quick succession, [[Vitellius]] became emperor in April 69 AD. 
 
 In response, the armies in [[Egypt]] and [[Judea|Judaea]] declared Vespasian emperor on July 1. < ref name=Levick/ > < sup > p43 < /sup >  In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus|Mucianus]], the governor of [[Syria]], and [[Marcus Antonius Primus|Primus]], a general in [[Pannonia]]. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian gained control of Egypt. On 20 December, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the [[Roman Senate]]. 
 
 Little factual information survives about Vespasian's government during the ten years he was emperor. His reign is best known for financial reforms, the successful campaign against Judaea, and several ambitious construction projects such as the [[Colosseum]]. Upon his death in 79, he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Titus]].
