 '''Patriotism''' means loyalty of a person to his/her own [[nation]] or the leaders of the nation. A '''patriot''' is a person who is on the side of his/her own nation or its leaders. Patriotism is different from [[nationalism]].  
 Also, contrary to a nationalist, patriots do not favor [[               imperialism]], while nationalists tend to but don’t always favor imperialism. An example of a nationalist favoring imperialism would be [[Adolf Hitler]]. 
 
 The English term  " patriot "  is first known from the Elizabethan era, via Middle French from Late Latin (6th century) patriota  " countryman " , ultimately from Greek πατριώτης (patriōtēs)  " countryman " , from πατρίς (patris),  " fatherland " . The abstract noun patriotism appears in the early 18th century.
