 '''''Alcina''''' is an [[opera seria]] with music by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The [[libretto]] was written by [[Riccardo Broschi]]. The opera is based on an episode in [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'', an epic [[poem]] set in the time of [[Charlemagne]]'s [[war]]s against [[Islam]]. Handel composed several little [[ballet]]s in the opera for the famous dancer [[Marie Sallé]]. 
 
 ''Alcina'' was first performed on 16 April 1735 at [[Covent Garden]] in [[London]]. It was [[revival|revived]] in [[Germany]] in 1738. It was not performed again until 1928. 
 
 [[Joan Sutherland]] sang the role for her [[debut]] in [[Venice]] in 1960. She sang it again the same year in [[Dallas]]. She sang it at the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden, in 1962. [[Renée Fleming]] sang the role in [[Chicago]] in 1999.

 == Story == 
 Alcina is a sorceress. She changes people into stones, trees, and animals. Bradamente lands on Alcina's [[island]] looking for her fiancé Ruggiero. He has been enchanted by Alcina. He is in love with her. 
 
 Bradamente has a magic ring that allows her to break spells. She intends to use it to free Alcina's victims. She lets Ruggiero wear it. He sees at once that Alcina is a cruel enchantress and that her island is a [[desert]]. 
 
 Alcina is truly in love with Ruggiero. Her magic powers slip away. Bradamente and Ruggiero destroy an urn that is the source of Alcina's power. Alcina's world disappears. Her [[victim]]s become humans again.
