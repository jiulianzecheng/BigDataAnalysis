 '''Boursorama''' is a [[France|French]] company which activities are mainly divided between the animation of the information portal Boursorama.com and the activity of internet [[Bank|banking]] with ''Boursorama Banque''. [[Société Générale]] is the owner. < ref > [https://www.lesechos.fr/2015/06/societe-generale-acquiert-la-totalite-du-capital-de-boursorama-266522 Société Générale acquiert la totalité du capital de Boursorama] < /ref > 
 
 Since its creation, the website Boursorama.com has been the French leader in online information about the [[stock market]], aimed at both individual investors and professionals. Initially specialized in this activity, Boursorama.com diversified into political and general information with an economic focus. < ref > [https://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/20140417.CHA2912/comment-boursorama-est-devenue-la-banque-en-ligne-preferee-des-francais.html Comment Boursorama est devenue le n°1 français de la banque en ligne] < /ref > 
 
 After several acquisitions and mergers, including Fimatex in 2002, Boursorama also diversified into online banking, resulting in the creation of the current ''Boursorama Banque''. < ref > [https://www.cbanque.com/banque-en-ligne/actualites/72358/banque-en-ligne-boursorama-banque-plus-que-jamais-leader Banque en ligne : Boursorama Banque plus que jamais leader] < /ref >
