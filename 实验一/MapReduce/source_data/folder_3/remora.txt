 '''Remoras''', sometimes called '''suckerfish''' or '''sharksuckers''', are fish in the family '''Echeneidae''' of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] in the order [[Carangiformes]]. < ref name = Nelson5 > {{cite book |title=Fishes of the World |edition=5th |author1=J.

They eat stray bits of food left by the shark and tiny [[shrimp]]-like parasites that live on the shark's [[skin]]. They have [[sucker]]-like disks on their heads with which they attach to the shark.  
 Both the shark and the remora benefit from the pairing, but the remore benefits much more; this is [[commensalism]]. Remora are also known as sucker fish or shark sucker.
