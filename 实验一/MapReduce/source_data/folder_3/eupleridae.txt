 The family '''Eupleridae''' is a group of [[carnivore]]s found in [[Madagascar]]. < ref > Wozencraft W.C. 2005.  " Order Carnivora " . In Wilson, D.E.  &  Reeder D.M. ''Mammal Species of the World''. 3rd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press, 532–628. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8221-0}}. OCLC 62265494. < /ref >  The family has of eight species and seven genera in two subfamilies. They live in a variety of habitats, from humid [[forest]]s, marshes, bogs, and [[swamp]]s, to [[desert]]s and [[savanna]]s. 
 
 The Euplerids are a [[clade]]. They are descendents of ancestors which rafted over from [[Africa]] about 20 million years ago (mya). They are closely related to [[mongoose]]s. < ref > John J. Flynn ''et al'' 2005. Molecular phylogeny of the Carnivora (Mammalia): assesssing the impact of increased sampling on resolving engimatic relationships. ''Syst. Biol''. '''54'''(2):317–337 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16012099 Molecular phylogeny of Carnivora] < /ref >  The [[fossa]] and the Malagasy [[civet]] (''Fossa fossana'') are believed to be the most ancient surviving species in this group. 
   
 Euplerids usually have slender bodies with relatively small heads. Head and body length ranges from 250 & nbsp;mm to 800 & nbsp;mm. Euplerids are primarily [[carnivorous]], eating small mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, insects, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. ''Fossa fossana'' and ''Galidia elegans'' may also eat some fruit. 
 
 ==Reproduction== 
 Fossas form [[Monogamy|monogamous]] pairs, while species in the genera ''Galidia'', ''Mungotictis'', and ''Salanoia'' live alone or in pairs, suggesting that they are monogamous for one breeding season only. ''Mungotictis'' individuals live in small groups with several adults of each sex, but it is not known if all of the adults in a group breed. ''Cryptoprocta'' only live alone, suggesting a [[Polygyny|polygynous]] or [[Polyandry|polygynandrous]] mating system. 
 
 Euplerids have definite breeding seasons. Each species' season is different and lasts from two to eight months. [[Gestation]] lasts around three months. Usually, just one or two young are born per litter, though Cryptoprocta can have up to four. [[Weaning]] takes place between two and four and a half months. 
 
 == Conservation status == 
 All species in this family are threatened. The main causes are loss of habitat and hunting by humans or dogs. (IUCN 2006)
