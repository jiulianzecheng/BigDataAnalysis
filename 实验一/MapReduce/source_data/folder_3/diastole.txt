 '''Diastole''' ({{pron-en|daɪˈæstəliː}}) is the time during a heart beat when the heart fills with blood after a contraction. The contraction of the heart is called [[systole (medicine)|systole]] and is the opposite of diastole. The term ''diastole'' comes from the Greek word ''διαστολη''. This means expanding or opening. < ref > [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diastole Diastole]. Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. 24 August 2008. < /ref > 
 
 ==Inside the heart== 
 There are two types of diastole.  
 *'''[[Ventricle (heart)|Ventricular]] diastole''' is the time when the two lower chambers of the heart called the ''ventricles'' are relaxing to let the blood to flow in.  
 *'''[[atrium (anatomy)|Atrial]] diastole''' is the time when the two upper chambers of the heart called the ''atria'' are relaxing to allow the blood to flow in.  
 
 During ventricular diastole, the pressure in the (left and right) ventricles drops. When the pressure in the left ventricle becomes lower than the pressure in the left atrium, the [[mitral valve]] opens. The blood then flows from the atrium into the ventricle. The speed at which the blood flows into the ventricles can be used to diagnose [[diastolic dysfunction]]. < ref > [http://www.bioline.org.br/request?mj04008] Abdul Latif Mohamed, Jun Yong, Jamil Masiyati, Lee Lim, Sze Chec Tee.

 ==Diastolic pressure== 
 Because the heart relaxes during diastole,  " diastolic pressure "  is the lowest pressure within the arterial blood stream during each heart beat. The highest arterial pressure happens when the heart muscle contracts, and is called [[Systole (medicine)|systolic pressure]]. 
 
 When blood pressure is measured for medical purposes, diastolic pressure is the second number in the  " ratio "  of systolic to diastolic pressure; for example: 120/80.
