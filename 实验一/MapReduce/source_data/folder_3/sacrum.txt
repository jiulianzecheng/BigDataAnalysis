 In humans, the '''sacrum''' is a large, triangular [[bone]]. It is at the bottom of the [[vertebral column|spine]] and the upper and back part of the [[pelvis]].  
 
 It fits like a wedge between the two [[hip]] bones. Its upper part connects with the last [[lumbar]] [[vertebra]], and bottom part with the [[coccyx]] (tailbone). During the first half of life these bones gradually fuse together. 
 
 The sacrum is [[wikt:concave|concave]] facing forward, and tilted forward. The sacrum connects with four bones: 
 * the last [[lumbar vertebra]] above 
 * the [[coccyx|coccyx (tailbone)]] below 
 * the [[Ilium (bone)|illium]] portion of the hip bone on either side
