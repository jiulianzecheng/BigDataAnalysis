'''Astrophysics''' is the study of how [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and other things in the Universe work, and how we can learn about them. Astrophysicists use [[physics]] to explain what [[astronomer]]s find and see. < ref > Keeler, James E. 1897. The importance of astrophysical research and the relation of astrophysics to the other physical sciences. ''The Astrophysical Journal'', '''6''' (4): 271–288, Bibcode:1897ApJ.....6..271K, doi:10.1086/140401, PMID 17796068 < /ref > 
 
 Astrophysics is also the study of how the [[Universe]] started and how it is changing with time. This part of astrophysics is called [[cosmology]].

 For a long time, bodies in the sky seemed to be unchanging spheres moving in a circle. But on Earth, growth and decay happened, and natural motion was in a straight line. Therefore, people thought the [[celestial]] region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found on Earth. 
 
 During the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophers such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Galileo]], < ref > {{Citation | last = Galilei | first = Galileo | author-link = Galileo Galilei | editor-last = Van Helden | editor-first = Albert | publication-date = 1989 | title = Sidereus Nuncius or The Sidereal Messenger | date = 15 April 1989 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | publication-place = Chicago | pages = 21, 47 | isbn = 0-226-27903-0 }} < /ref >  [[Descartes]], < ref > {{Cite web |author=Edward Slowik |title=Descartes' Physics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |orig-year=2005 |accessdate=2015-07-18}} < /ref >  and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], < ref > {{Citation | last = Westfall, Richard S. 1980 | title = Never at rest: a biography of Isaac Newton | date = 29 April 1983 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | publication-place = Cambridge | pages = 731–732 | isbn = 0-521-27435-4 }} < /ref >  began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar material and were subject to the same [[Physical law|natural laws]]. < ref name = Burtt > Burtt, Edwin Arthur [1924] 2003.

 When they were able to work out how the [[planet]]s moved, the science of astrophysics was born. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] realized that the same rules of [[mechanics]] that he had found on the surface of the Earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved. He said,  " < u > As above, so below < /u > " . By this, he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space. 
 
 Later scientists looked at the light from stars using [[spectroscopy]].  They were able to work out what they were made of, and how they changed with time.

 There are two main types of astrophysics: 
 
 *'''Observational astrophysics'''. Observational astrophysicists use [[telescope]]s to study the Universe, but astrophysicists study the physics of what they see to explain the Universe. 
 **[[Radio telescope|Radio astronomy]] 
 **[[Optical telescope|Optical astronomy]] 
 **[[Infrared telescope|Infrared astronomy]] 
 **[[Ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]], and [[gamma ray|gamma-ray]] astronomy using [[space telescope]]s 
 *'''Theoretical astrophysics''' uses information from astronomers, theories, and mathematics to explain how the Universe works. [[Cosmology]] is a type of theoretical astrophysics. Problems investigated include:  
 **[[Solar System]]: its formation and evolution 
 **[[Star formation]] and evolution 
 **[[Galaxy]] formation and evolution 
 **large-scale structure of [[matter]] in the universe  
 **Origin of [[cosmic rays]]  
 **[[General relativity]]  
 **Evolution of the [[universe]] 
 **Hydrodynamics is used for [[Mathematical model|mathematically modelling]] how gases behave. Strong [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars.  
 
 === An example === 
 Cecilia Helena Payne (later [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]) published her doctoral dissertation at [[Radcliffe College]] in 1925. She had discovered that [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] were the main content of stars. More than that, the spectral classes relate to the temperature of stars. Despite [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]]'s suggestion, < ref > Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, which gave off enormous energy according to Einstein's equation E = mc2. < /ref >  her discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers told her to modify the conclusion before publication. Later research confirmed her discovery. < ref > Payne C.H. 1925.
