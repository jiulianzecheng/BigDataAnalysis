The '''Hadean''' is the [[geology|geological]] [[eon]] before the [[Archaean]]. It began at the [[Earth]]'s [[Age of the Earth|formation]] about 4.6 [[billion]] years ago, and ended 4 billion years ago. The name  " Hadean "  comes from ''[[Hades]]'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for  " Underworld " , due to the conditions on the Earth at the time. The geologist Preston Cloud first used the term in 1972. [[Meteorite]] bombardment, [[volcano|volcanism]] and high temperatures were very widespread on the early Earth. 
 
 There are no [[sedimentary rock]]s from the Hadean at all. The earliest geological objects on Earth are some [[zircon]]s, dated to about 4,400 million years ago (mya). Oceans would probably have formed as soon as the temperature allowed. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6817/abs/409175A0.html|title=Wilde S.A. Valley J.W.

 Early in [[Earth history]], the Moon was torn out by a massive collision with a proto-planet. The evidence for this [[giant impact hypothesis]] is:  
 
 #the remarkable similarity between the Earth's crust and the Moon's composition, 
 #the low iron concentration in the Moon's centre, and 
 #the high [[angular momentum]] of the Earth-Moon system. < ref > {{cite journal | last = R. Canup and E.

 An explanation for the general lack of Hadean rocks (older than 3800 mya) is the large amount of rocky and icy debris present in the early Solar System. After the eight planets formed, large numbers of leftover proto[[planet]]s, [[asteroids]], and [[comet]]s pursued eccentric orbits throughout our system, [[bombardment|bombarding]] the early Earth and the other planets and moons until approximately 3800 mya. This activity may have prevented any large crustal fragments from forming by literally shattering the early protocontinents. A barrage of particularly large impacts known as the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] represents the climax of this violent era.  
 
 No life forms are known from this eon. The early atmosphere contained [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrogen]], but almost no oxygen.
