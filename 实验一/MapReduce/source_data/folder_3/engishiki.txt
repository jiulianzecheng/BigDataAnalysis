 In 905, Emperor Daigo gave an order for the compilation of the Engishiki. While there were previous attempts at codifying such information, the Konin and the Jogan Gishiki no longer exist, < ref > " Jogan Gishiki "  in Stuart D. B.

 The task of revising the Engishiki was initiated by [[Fujiwara no Tokihira]]. However, the work was left incomplete when he died four years later in 909. His brother, [[Fujiwara no Tadahira]], continued the task in 912 and was able to complete the revisions in 927.. 
 
 The Engishiki underwent several revisions, and after these revisions, it served as a basis for reform initiatives that began in 967..{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
