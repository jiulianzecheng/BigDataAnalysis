 '''Wind''' is the flow of [[gas]]es. On [[Earth]], wind is mostly the movement of [[air]]. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or [[particle]]s from the [[sun]] through [[space]]. The strongest winds seen on a [[planet]] in our [[solar system]] are on [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. 
 
 Short bursts of fast winds are called ''gusts''. Strong winds that go on for about one [[minute]] are called ''squalls''. Winds that go on for a long time are called many different things, such as ''breeze'', ''gale'', ''[[tropical cyclone|hurricane]]'', and ''[[typhoon]]''. 
 
 Wind can move [[land]], especially in [[desert]]s. Cold wind can sometimes have a bad effect on [[livestock]]. Wind also affects animals' food stores, their hunting and the way they protect themselves. 
 
 Sunlight drives the Earth's [[atmospheric circulation]]. The resulting winds blow over land and [[sea]], producing [[weather]].  
 
 A [[High pressure area]] (that makes an [[anticyclone]]) near a low pressure system (that makes a [[cyclone]]), makes air move from the high [[pressure]] to the low pressure to try to even out the pressures. The [[Coriolis effect]] causes the winds to spiral around. A big difference in pressure can make high winds.  In some [[storm]]s, such as [[hurricane]]s, [[typhoon]]s, [[cyclone]]s, or [[tornado]]es, it can cause winds faster than 200 mph (320 kilometres per hour). This can damage [[house]]s and other [[building]]s, and can kill people. 
 
 Wind can also be caused by the [[convection|rising of hot air]], or the falling of cool air. When hot air rises, it creates a low pressure underneath it, and air moves in to equalize the pressure. When cold air drops (because it is denser or heavier than warm air), it creates a high pressure and flows out to even out the pressure with the low [[Pressure cooker|pressure]] around it. 
 
 The wind is usually invisible, but [[rain]], [[dust]], or [[snow]] can show how it is blowing. A weathervane can also show you where the wind is coming from. The [[Beaufort scale]] is a way to tell how strong the wind is. It is used at sea when no land can be seen.  
 
 The increase in wind causes an increase in the rate of [[evaporation]].

 High winds can cause damage depending on how strong they are. Sometimes gusts of wind can make poorly made [[bridge]]s move or be destroyed, like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940. < ref > {{cite book|author=T. P.

 == Trade winds == 
 The '''trade winds'''  are  the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the [[tropics]], within the lower portion of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. They occur in the lower section of the [[troposphere]] near the Earth's [[equator]]. The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. They blow from the southeast in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. They are stronger during the winter and when the Arctic [[oscillation]] is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by captains of [[sailing ship]]s to cross the world's oceans for [[centuries]]. They enabled European empire expansion into the [[America]] < nowiki/ > s. They also allowed trade routes to become established across the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific ocean]]s. 
 
 [[File:ITCZ january-july.png|thumb|The doldrums in January ([[blue]]) and July ([[red]]).]] 
 The ''doldrums'' are in the [[equator]]ial region. It is a wind belt where air is warm, with little pressure [[variation]] < nowiki/ > s. Winds are light there. Another name for doldrums is ''Intertropical Convergence Zone'' (ITCZ) 
 
 == In outer space == 
 Wind in outer space, called ''[[solar wind]]'', is very different from a wind on earth.  This wind is caused by the sun, or other stars, and it is made up of [[particle]]s that came out of the star's atmosphere.  Like solar wind, the planetary wind is made up of light [[gas]]es that have come out of planets' atmospheres.
