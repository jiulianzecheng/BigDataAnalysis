 '''Pastygate''' is the name given to a [[political]] [[scandal]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in March 2012. The government had said that it was going to place a 20% [[VAT]] charge on hot pasties. 
 
 A [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament asked the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP George Osborne, about when he last ate a [[Cornish pasty]]. Osborne answered that he had no idea when he had last eaten one. This answer has been used to show how out of touch with ordinary people the Conservative party had become. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] later said that he had recently eaten a Cornish pasty at [[Leeds railway station]]  " and that it was very good " .

 The issue, which at first appeared to be unimportant, was then taken up by several other newspapers and political [[commentator]]s. They pointed out that the Conservatives seemed not to know that the pasty was a basic food eaten by many ordinary people in the country. The VAT rise on the pasty would affect both these customers and the pasty industry itself. These newspapers and commentators made fun of David Cameron's attempt to show himself as a regular pasty eater  < ref > {{cite news |url= http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics-news/2012/03/29/pastygate-westminster-row-over-whether-tories-eat-bakery-products-rumbles-on-86908-23805780/ |title=Pastygate: Westminster row over whether Tories eat bakery products rumbles on.. - The Daily Record |first= |last= |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=29 March 2012 |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |location=[[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]] |issn=0956-8069 |oclc=500344244 |accessdate=30 March 2012}} < /ref > (i.e. as one of the people) and that George Osborne's did not know what a pasty was. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100148065/what-pastygate-tells-us-about-camerons-conservatives/ |title=What Pastygate tells us about Cameron's Conservatives â€“ Telegraph Blogs |first=James |last=Delingpole |work=blogs.telegraph.co.uk |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2012 |archive-date=6 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406004427/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100148065/what-pastygate-tells-us-about-camerons-conservatives/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
