[[File:Coat of Arms of Benedictus XVI.svg|thumb|150px|The arms of Pope Benedict XVI show a bishop's mitre instead of the pope's crown]]A '''mitre''' is a [[wikt:tall|tall]] [[hat]] worn by leaders in some [[Christian]] churches. In the [[Roman Catholic church]], it is worn by [[bishop]]s, archbishops or cardinals (higher order). The [[wikt:front|front]] and [[wikt:back|back]] are the [[shape]] of a [[triangle]]. It is only worn when the bishop is dressed in his special [[Religion|religious]] [[Clothing|clothes]], but is used on a [[coat of arms]] to show that the [[wikt:own|owner]] is a bishop. 
 
 Mitres are also worn by some clergy in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Eastern Catholic churches.
