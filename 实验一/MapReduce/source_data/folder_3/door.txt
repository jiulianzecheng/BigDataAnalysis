 A '''door''' is a hard, flat object a person can open and close so that person can go into a [[room]] or other place. It is found in [[house]]s and other [[building]]s. Doors are also found in [[car]]s and [[cage]]s. 
 
 The reasons for a door are: 
 * for people, [[animal]]s, and objects to go through; some doors are for emergencies only ([[emergency exit]]) 
 * to keep cold or hot [[air]] outside (or inside, such as the door on a [[refrigerator]]) 
 * so that people cannot see or hear what happens on the other side ([[privacy]] and stopping [[noise]]) 
 * so that people do not fall out of the car or other [[vehicle]] 
 * so a person can decide who to let in—many doors have a [[lock]] 
 
 == Types of doors == 
 
 A '''revolving door''' is a group of doors that turn in a circle as a person pushes one. The person can go through, but wind and rain cannot get in. 
 
 A '''blind door''' is a fake door that is really part of the wall. People use them to make a room look nice. 
 
 An '''up-and-over door''' is often used in [[garage]]s. Instead of [[hinge]]s, it rolls up on [[wikt:rail|rails]] so that it stays above the opening. 
 
 A '''fire door''' is a door that does not let [[fire]] go through. They are usually made of heavy [[steel]]. 
 
 A '''[[doggie door]]''' is a small door for dogs or other small pets. They are usually on the bottom of people-sized doors.
