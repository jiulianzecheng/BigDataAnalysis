 '''''Australovenator''''' is a medium-sized [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in [[Australia]] about 100 million years ago.  
 
 The fossil bones of the dinosaur were found at an ancient [[Billabong (lake)|billabong]] near [[Winton]], [[Queensland]]. Scientists have called him  " Banjo " , after the famous Australian [[poet]], [[Banjo Patterson]]. < ref name=SHetal09 > {{cite journal |last=Hocknull |first=Scott A. |display-authors = etal |year=2009 |title=New mid-Cretaceous (latest Albian) dinosaurs from Winton, Queensland, Australia |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=4 |issue=7 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0006190 |pmid=19584929 |page= e6190 |pmc=2703565 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  Patterson wrote the song  " [[Waltzing Matilda]] "  after a visit to Winton in 1885. < ref name=SHetal09/ >
