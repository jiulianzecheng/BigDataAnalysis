 '''''Grevillea''''' is a [[genus]] of about 360 species of [[evergreen]] [[flowering plant]]s in the protea family [[Proteaceae]]. It comes from [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Sulawesi]]. It was named after [[Charles Francis Greville]]. The species are quite different from each other, from low growing [[shrub]]s less than 0.5 m tall to [[tree]]s 35 m tall. Common names include '''Grevillea''', '''Spider Flower''', '''Silky-oak''' and '''Toothbrush'''. 
 
 Grevilleas are closely related to the genus ''[[Hakea]]'', the genus gives its name to the subfamily [[Grevilleoideae]]. Many species of grevilleas are popular [[garden plant]]s, especially in Australia but also in other temperate and subtropical climates. Many grevilleas interbreed freely, and some specially picked [[hybrid]]s have been grown for sale. Among the best known are [[Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon'|''Grevillea'' 'Robyn Gordon']], a small shrub up to 1.5 metres high and wide which can flower 12 months of the year in subtropical climates.
