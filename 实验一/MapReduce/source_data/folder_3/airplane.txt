 An '''airplane''', also known as an '''aeroplane''' or just '''plane''', is a [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. It moves by [[thrust]] from a [[jet engine]], [[propeller]], or [[rocket engine]].  Airplanes come in many shapes and sizes.  The use of aircraft is called [[aviation]].  Airplanes are used for many things including [[recreation]], [[Aviation|transportation of goods and people]], [[military]], and [[research]].  They can move much faster than road, rail or sea transport, and so they are often the choice for long distances.  
 
 [[Commercial aviation]] transports more than four billion passengers annually on [[Airliner|airliners]] and transports more than 200 billion [[ton]] [[Kilometre|kilometres]] of cargo every year, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.  Most airplanes are flown by a [[pilot]] on board the [[aircraft]], but some are airplanes made to be [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|remotely or computer-controlled]] such as [[drone]]s. 
 
 Airplanes fly between many cities all over the world, carrying people and [[cargo]]. Big cities usually have an [[international]] [[airport]], where large airplanes can land and take off safely. Some large cities like [[New York City]] and [[London]] have more than one airport. Two major makers of airplanes are [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]]. 
 
 [[Statistics]] show that riding in a plane is safer than driving in a car. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Bailey|first=Joanna|last2=Hardiman|first2=Jake|last3=Pickett|first3=Riley|date=2022-09-08|title=How Flying Today Is Safer Than At Any Time In The Past|url=https://simpleflying.com/how-safe-is-flying/|access-date=2023-07-24|website=Simple Flying|language=en|quote=According to research by Harvard University, flying in the US, Europe, and Australia is actually significantly safer than driving a car. Your odds of being in an accident during a flight is one in 1.2 million, and the chances of that accident being fatal are one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car crash, conversely, are one in 5,000.}} < /ref > 
 
 == Food == 
 People make jokes about [[airline]] food, because they say it tastes bad. < ref name=food/ >  While travelling on an [[airliner]] at a high altitude, it can cause dryness. Because of the low pressure, a person's [[taste bud]]s are around 30% less sensitive to sweet and salty foods. < ref name=food > {{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150112-why-in-flight-food-tastes-weird|title=Why does food taste different on planes?|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 8, 2023|archive-date=March 8, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230308153348/http://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150112-why-in-flight-food-tastes-weird|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 == Wings ==

 The wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the [[aircraft]]. When the [[aircraft]] travels forwards, [[air]] flows over the [[Wing|wings]], which are shaped to create lift. This shape is called an [[airfoil]] and is shaped like a [[Wing|bird's wing]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 === Transport === 
 Fixed-wing aircraft have long been used as [[airliner]] < nowiki/ > s for moving [[passenger]] < nowiki/ > s from place to place.  [[Cargo aircraft]] carry [[cargo]] across seas and long distances, and passenger aircraft also carry some cargo. 
 
 === War ===

 The first aircraft for war bombing was used in [[Libya]] in 1911 by [[Italy]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Italo{{ndash}}Turkish War). < ref > https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13294524 < /ref >   Some fixed-wing aircraft are used by [[air force]]s to [[defense (military)|defend]] countries.  These may be [[fighter aircraft]], using [[machine gun|guns]] or [[missile]]s for combat with other aircraft.  They may be [[bomber]]s, dropping [[bomb]]s on ground targets. 
 
 Fixed-wing aircraft allow people to travel longer distances, and faster than [[ship]]s or [[railway|trains]]. Aircraft can fly from New York to London in about 7 hours. It would take one week or more on a ship. Militaries use airplanes to carry their soldiers quickly from place to place. 
 
 Airplanes are also used by the military to see many things on the ground easily. This is called [[surveillance]] or [[reconnaissance]].  Often, fixed-wing aircraft will take [[photograph]]s as well, which can be used for military planning later. This role is now being taken over by [[drone]]s, which are automatic planes. 
 
 == Impact == 
 Fossil fuel-powered aircraft release [[soot]] and other pollutants into the atmosphere. They burn fossil fuel which releases CO2 emissions, and has warming non-CO2 effects due to nitrogen oxides (NOx), vapor trails and cloud formation.
