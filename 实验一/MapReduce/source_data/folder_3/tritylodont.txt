 '''Tritylodonts'''  < ref > named after the shape of animal's [[teeth]], with three [[cusp]]s. < /ref >  were small to medium-sized [[mammal]]-like [[cynodont]]s. They varied in size from a rabbit to a beaver. < ref name=KK > Kermack D.M.  &  K.A. 1984. ''The evolution of mammalian characters''.

 They were the last family of the non-mammalian [[synapsid]]s. One of the last cynodont lines to appear, the [[Family (biology)|family]] Tritylodontidae descended from a ''[[Cynognathus]]''-like cynodont. Their teeth had three cusps (bumps) which gave them their name. 
 
 The tritylodonts were [[herbivorous]], chewing through [[vegetation]], such as [[Plant stem|stem]]s, [[leaves]], and [[root]]s. Tritylodonts have no [[canine]] teeth, just [[incisor]]s and cheek teeth. The jaw worked by grinding forward and backwards, shredding the food between the ridges of the teeth. < ref name=KK/ > 
 
 They were the longest surviving of all the non-mammalian [[therapsid]]s. They appeared in the latest [[Triassic]] period, and persisted through the [[Jurassic]] until the middle of the [[Cretaceous]]. < ref > Ruta M; Botha-Brink J; Mitchell S.A.  &  Benton M.J. 2013. The radiation of cynodonts and the ground plan of mammalian morphological diversity. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'' '''280''' (1769). [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1769/20131865] < /ref >  This shows that the tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids, even though they lived right beneath the ruling [[dinosaur]]s' feet, so to speak. 
 
 It is very clear that the tritylodonts were [[warm-blooded]]. < ref > Hopson J.A. 2012. The role of foraging mode in the origin of therapsids: implications for the origin of mammalian endothermy. In ''Studies in vertebrate paleobiology: essays in honor of John R. Bolt'', eds Lombard R.E. ''et al'' pp. 126–148. Fieldiana: Life and Earth Sciences '''5'''. Chicago, IL: The Field Museum of Natural History. < /ref >  The tritylodont fossils were found in the [[Americas]], [[South Africa]], and [[Eurasia]]. They may have managed to live worldwide, including [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 There are quite a few parallels between these tritylodonts (which are outside the mammal line) and [[multituberculate]]s, which are mammals. The tritylodonts had no competition in the [[Jurassic]], because all the other  mammal-like types were either carnivores or insectivores. Kermack's conclusion is that when the multituberculates appeared (middle Jurssic) they were in direct competition, and eventually they out-competed the earlier group, and replaced it. < ref name=KK/ >
