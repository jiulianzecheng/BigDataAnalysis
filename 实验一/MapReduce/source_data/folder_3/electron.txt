An '''electron''' is a very small piece of [[matter]]. Its symbol is '''e < sup > − < /sup > ''', and it was discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1897. 
 
 The electron is a [[subatomic particle]]. Every [[atom]] is made of some electrons that surround the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] of the atom. An electron can also be separate from any atom. It is believed to be an [[elementary particle]] because it cannot be broken down into anything smaller. < ref name=Purcell > Purcell, Edward M. 1985. ''Electricity and Magnetism''.

 Electrons take part in [[gravitation]]al, [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction]]s. < ref name=Anastopoulos1 > Anastopoulos, Charis 2008. ''Particle or Wave: the evolution of the concept of matter in modern physics''. Princeton University Press. pp261–262. {{ISBN|0691135126}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=rDEvQZhpltEC & pg=PA261 < /ref >  The electromagnetic force is strongest in common situations. Electrons repel (push apart) from each other because they have the same electric charge. Electrons are attracted to protons because they have opposite electric charge. An electron has an [[electric field]], which describes these forces. The [[electricity]] that powers televisions, motors, mobile phones, basically everything (electric) is actually many electrons moving through wires or other [[Electrical conductor|conductors]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 Electrons have the smallest [[electrical charge]].  This electrical charge equals the charge of a [[proton]], but has the opposite sign.  For this reason, electrons [[Electromagnetism|are attracted]] towards the protons in atomic [[Nucleus (physics)|nuclei]]. This attraction makes electrons near a nucleus form an [[atom]]. 
 An electron has a mass of about 1/1836 times a proton. < ref name= " nist_codata_mu " > {{cite web

 One way to think about the location of electrons in an atom is to imagine that they orbit at fixed distances from the [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]]. This way, electrons in an atom exist in a number of [[electron shell]]s surrounding the central nucleus. Each electron shell is given a number 1, 2, 3, and so on, starting from the one closest to the nucleus (the innermost shell). Each shell can hold up to a certain maximum number of electrons. The [[distribution]] of electrons in the various shells is called electronic arrangement (or electronic form or shape). Electronic arrangement can be shown by numbering or an [[electron diagram]]. (A different way to think about the location of electrons is to use [[quantum mechanics]] to calculate their [[atomic orbital]]s.)[[File:Bohr atom model English.svg|right|thumb|The [[Niels Bohr]] model of the atom. Three electron shells about a nucleus, with an electron moving from the second to the first level and releasing a [[photon]].]]The electron is one of a type of [[subatomic particle]]s called [[lepton]]s. The electron has a negative [[electric charge]]. The electron has another property, called [[spin (physics)|spin]]. Its spin value is 1/2, which makes it a [[fermion]]. 
 
 While most electrons are found in atoms, others move independently in matter, or together as [[cathode rays]] in a [[vacuum]]. In some [[superconductor]]s, electrons move in pairs. When electrons flow, this flow is called electricity, or an [[electric current]]. 
 
 An object can be described as 'negatively charged' if there are more electrons than protons in an object, or 'positively charged' when there are more protons than electrons. Electrons can move from one object to another when touched. They may be attracted to another object with opposite charge, or repelled when they both have the same charge. When an object is 'grounded', electrons from the charged object go into the ground, making the object neutral. This is what [[lightning rod]]s (lightning conductors) do. 
 
 === Chemical reactions === 
 Electrons in their shells round an atom are the basis of [[chemical reaction]]s. Complete outer shells, with maximum electrons, are less reactive. Outer shells with less than maximum electrons are reactive. The number of electrons in atoms is the underlying basis of the chemical [[periodic table]]. < ref > Pauling, Linus C. 1960.

 === Measurement === 
 Electric ''charge'' can be directly measured with a device called an [[:en:Electrometer|electrometer]]. Electric ''current'' can be directly measured with a [[galvanometer]]. The measurement given off by a galvanometer is different from the measurement given off by an [[:en:Electrometer|electrometer]]. Today laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons. 
 
 === 'Seeing' an electron === 
 In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of [[particle detector]]s, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. < ref name=grupen > Grupen, Claus 1999.

 The first video images of an electron's energy distribution were captured by a team at [[Lund University]] in [[Sweden]], February 2008. The scientists used extremely short flashes of light, called [[1 E-18 s|attosecond]] pulses, which allowed an electron's motion to be observed for the first time. < ref > {{cite web

 === Anti-particle === 
 The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called a [[positron]]. This is identical to the electron, but carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron collides with a positron, they may scatter off each other or be totally [[annihilation|annihilate]]d, producing a pair (or more) of [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s. 
 
 == History of its discovery == 
 The effects of electrons were known long before it could be explained. The [[Ancient Greeks]] knew that rubbing [[amber]] against [[fur]] attracted small objects. Now we know the rubbing strips off electrons, and that gives an electric charge to the [[amber]]. 
 Many physicists worked on the electron. [[J.J. Thomson]] proved it existed, < ref name= " ReferenceA " > Davis  &  Falconer, ''J.J. Thomson and the Discovery of the Electron'' < /ref >  in [[1897]], but another man gave it the name 'electron'. < ref > Shipley, Joseph T. 1945. ''Dictionary of word origins''. The Philosophical Library. p133. < /ref > 
 
 == The electron cloud model == 
 The model views electrons as holding indeterminate positions in a diffuse cloud around the nucleus of the atom. 
 
 The uncertainty principle means a person cannot know an electron's position and energy level at the same time. These potential states form a cloud around the atom. The potential states of electrons in a single atom form a single, uniform cloud.
