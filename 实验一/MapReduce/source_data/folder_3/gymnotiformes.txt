 The '''Gymnotiformes''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Teleost|teleosts]] which are [[electric fish]]. Common names are Neotropical knifefish or South American knifefish. They are mainly [[Nocturnal animals|nocturnal]] [[freshwater fish]]. Their muscles create an [[electric field]].  
 
 Gymnotiformes are slender fish with narrow bodies and tapering tails. Their common name is  " knifefish " . 
 
 Perhaps the best-known species is the [[electric eel]] (''Electrophorus electricus'') which uses powerful electric shocks (up to 600 V) for hunting and self-defense.  
 
 There are several other species familiar in the aquarium trade: the [[black ghost knifefish]] (''Apteronotus albifrons''), the [[glass knifefish]] (''Eigenmannia virescens''), and the banded knifefish (''Gymnotus carapo'').
