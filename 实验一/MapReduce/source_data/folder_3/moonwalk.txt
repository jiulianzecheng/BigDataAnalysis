 The '''moonwalk''' or '''backslide''' is a [[dance]] movement that was made popular worldwide by [[Michael Jackson]]. The moonwalk is a dance move in which the dancer appears to be moving forwards, but is actually moving backwards. It is Michael Jackson's signature move, and in an exclusive interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], he said that he just adapted the moves of little kids he saw dancing. Michael Jackson first performed the moonwalk onstage at a concert while singing his popular single  " [[Billie Jean]] "  on ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' on March 25, 1983. This special was broadcast May 16, 1983. < sup > [[Moonwalk (dance)#cite note-Time Specials-2|[2]]] < /sup > . He said later that after the performance, he was unhappy and cried backstage because he didn't quite master the dance move.
