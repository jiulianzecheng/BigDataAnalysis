 A '''projectile''' is something that is sent flying through the air, usually as a [[weapon]]. Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile. For example, an [[arrow]] fired from a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], a [[bullet]], or even a rock from a [[slingshot]] are all projectiles. < ref > {{cite web | title=Dictionary.com | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/projectile | work= | publisher= | accessdate=2010-05-19}} < /ref > 
 
 Projectile weapons have been used for a long time. Bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago. Now most countries use projectile weapons instead of [[melee]] weapons like swords. This is because modern projectile weapons such as [[gun]]s, [[rocket|rocket launchers]], and [[artillery]] cannons can shoot at [[Long range shooting|long ranges]] and are usually more deadly than melee weapons.
