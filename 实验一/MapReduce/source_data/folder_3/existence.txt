 '''Existence''' usually means  " the state or [[fact]] of being " , but there are many different views on the meaning of the word '''existence''', and what it means to '''exist'''. 
 
 In [[English language|English]], '''existence''' is usually connected with the verb  " to be " . 
 # I '''am''' a human. 
 # This '''is''' a pen. 
 # The sky '''is''' blue. 
 # Four plus three '''is''' seven. 
 The first sentence can be understood to say  " I ''exist'' as a human " , and simply speaking, this is probably true. The fourth sentence is more difficult to understand, because it can be understood to say  " seven ''exists'' as the [[addition|sum]] of four and three " , but  " seven "  is not something that we can see or touch like a pen or a human. 
 
 The question  " What is existence? "  is a very important one for [[Philosophy|philosophers]], and many people think [[Aristotle]] is the first human being to have thought seriously about the question. 
 
 ''[[A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing|A universe from nothing]]'' by Lawrence M. Krauss. Free Press 2012. The book discusses modern [[cosmogony]] and its implications for the debate about the existence of God. The main theme is how  " we have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper [[nothing]]... by processes that do not require any external control or direction.
