 '''''Mesosaurus''''' is an extinct [[Ocean|marine]]  [[reptile]] from the early [[Permian]] of southern [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. It was one of the first known [[marine biology|marine]] reptiles, and had many [[adaptations]] to a fully [[aquatic]] [[lifestyle]].  
 
 It is sometimes considered an [[anapsid]], < ref > anapsid = no opening in the skull behind the eye socket < /ref >  but there is some disagreement about that. < ref name=GP08 > {{cite journal |last=Huene |first=F. von |year=1940 |title=Osteologie und systematische Stellung von ''Mesosaurus'' |journal=Palaeontographica.

 ==Palaeobiology== 
 ''Mesosaurus'' was one of the first reptiles to return to the [[water]] after early [[tetrapod]]s came to land in the later [[Devonian]]. < ref name=ML10 > {{cite book|last=Laurin|first=Michel|title=How vertebrates left the water|url=https://archive.org/details/howvertebratesle0000laur|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|edition=illustrated|pages=|isbn=978-0-520-26647-6}} < /ref >   
 
 It was around {{convert|1|m|ft}} in length, with webbed feet, a streamlined body, and a long tail that may have supported a fin. It probably propelled itself through the water with its long hind legs and flexible tail. Its body was also flexible and could easily move sideways, but it had heavily thickened [[rib]]s, which would have prevented it from twisting its body. < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall illustrated encyclopedia of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 65|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >  Specimens show it was [[viviparous]], bearing live young. < ref > Pineiro G.H. ''et al'' 2012. The oldest-known amniotic embryos suggest vivparity in mesosaurs. ''Historical Biology'' '''24''' 620{{ndash}}630. < /ref > 
 
 ''Mesosaurus'' had a small [[skull]] with long [[jaw]]s. The [[nostril]]s were located at the top, allowing the creature to breathe with only the upper side of its head breaking the surface. Its teeth were suitable for catching small [[nekton]]ic prey such as crustaceans. < ref name=MSP06 > {{cite journal |last=Modesto |first=S.P. |year=2006 |title=The cranial skeleton of the early Permian aquatic reptile ''Mesosaurus tenuidens'': implications for relationships and palaeobiology |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=345–368 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2006.00205.x|s2cid=52036785 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Distribution== 
 ''Mesosaurus'' was significant in providing evidence for the [[theory]] of [[continental drift]], because its remains were found in southern Africa and eastern South America, two far away places. < ref name=GP08/ >  As ''Mesosaurus'' was a [[coast]]al animal, and therefore could not have crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]], this distribution indicated that the two continents used to be joined together.
