 '''Nitra''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Nyitra'' / ''Nyitria'' [archaic]; [[German language|German]]: ''Neutra'' ({{Audio|De-Neutra.ogg|pronunciation}})) is a city in western [[Slovakia]] (and the fifth largest urban settlement in Slovakia) at the base of [[Zobor]] Mountain in the [[Nitra River]] valley. 
 
 Nitra is one of the oldest cities in Slovakia. It existed as a [[town]] since at least the early [[9th century]]. 
 
 == History == 
 Nitra is a city with special history. People have lived there for at least 6000 years. It was an important center of the [[Celts]] (in the last few hundred years BC), and later the seat of the first known rulers of what is today Slovak territory, i.e. of :  
 * the Germanic [[Quadi]] around 396? (disputed)  
 * the Slavic/Slovak [[Principality of Nitra]]: 
 ** an independent state (late 8th century - 833) 
 ** Principality of Nitra as part of [[Great Moravia]] (833 - ?907) 
 ** Principality of Nitra under [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian rule]] (?925/970 - 1107) [between 1000 and 1030 temporarily under Polish rule ] 
 
 Nitra is also site of the first known Church in Central and Eastern Europe, built in 828.
