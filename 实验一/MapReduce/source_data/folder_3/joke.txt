 A '''joke''' is something said, written or done to make people [[laughter|laugh]]. There are many kinds of jokes; they can be [[questions]] with surprising answers or [[wikt:stories|stories]] with unexpected endings. The [[humour]] of a joke comes from the surprise.  
 
 Jokes can be about anything. Jokes can be found anywhere: on the [[Internet]], in [[book]]s or heard from friends. Some jokes are about groups of people and can hurt people's feelings, for example if they are [[racist]], [[homophobic]] or [[sexist]]. 
 
 Jokes are used in [[comedy]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[movies]]. 
 
 Jokes could take the form of [[sarcasm]] or even try to poke fun at something to get a point across. People sometimes get hurt by jokes at them. If a joke is used to show a problem in someone's thought, it is normally called [[satire]]. 
 
 There are also [[practical jokes]].
