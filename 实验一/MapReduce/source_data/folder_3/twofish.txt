 In [[cryptography]], '''Twofish''' is a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key]] [[block cipher]] with a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 128 [[bit]]s and [[Key size|key lengths]] up to 256 bits.  
 
 In 1997, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] announced for [[competition]] to choose a successor to [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] to be known as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]], Twofish was one of the ''five finalists'' of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] [[competition]], but was not selected as a [[standard]].  
 
 Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]]. Twofish's main [[feature]]s are the use of pre-computed key-dependent [[Substitution box|S-boxes]], and a relatively complex [[key schedule]]. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes). Twofish uses some elements from other [[design]]s; for example, the [[pseudo-Hadamard transform]] (PHT) from the [[SAFER]] family of ciphers. Twofish uses the same [[Feistel network|Feistel structure]] as the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]]. 
 
 On most [[software]] platforms Twofish is slightly slower than [[Rijndael key schedule|Rijndael]] (the chosen algorithm for [[Advanced Encryption Standard]]) for 128-bit [[key (cryptography)|keys]], but somewhat faster for 256-bit keys. < ref name= " paper-aes-comparison " >

 == Creators == 
 Twofish was [[design]]ed by [[Bruce Schneier]], [[John Kelsey (cryptanalyst)|John Kelsey]], [[Doug Whiting]], [[David Wagner]], [[Chris Hall (cryptographer)|Chris Hall]], and  [[Niels Ferguson]]; the  " extended Twofish team "  who met to made further [[cryptanalysis]] of Twofish and other AES [[Competition|competitors]] included [[Stefan Lucks]], [[Tadayoshi Kohno]], and [[Mike Stay]]. 
 
 Twofish algorithm is [[Free software|free]] for anyone to use without any restrictions whatsoever. The Twofish cipher has not been [[patent]]ed and the software example of its specification has been placed in the [[public domain]]. However, Twofish is not widely used like the [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], which has been available for a longer period of time. 
 
 == Cryptanalysis == 
 As of 2008, the best published [[cryptanalysis]] on the Twofish block cipher is a [[truncated differential cryptanalysis]] of the full 16-round version. The paper claims that the [[probability]] of truncated differentials attacks is 2 < sup > -57.3 < /sup >  per block and that it will take about 2 < sup > 51 < /sup >  chosen [[plaintexts]] (32 [[PiB]] worth of data) to find a good pair of truncated differentials. < ref name= " twofish-analysis-shiho " >

 Bruce Schneier responds in a 2005 blog entry that this paper does not present a full [[cryptanalytic attack]], but only some [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] [[Differential cryptanalysis|differential]] characteristics:  " But even from a [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical perspective]], Twofish is not even remotely broken. There have been no extensions to these results since they were published "  in 2000. < ref name=schneier-twofish-cryptan >
