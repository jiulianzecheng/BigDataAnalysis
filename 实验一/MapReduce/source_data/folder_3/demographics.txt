'''Demographics''' are [[statistics|statistical]] information about [[humans|human]] [[population|populations]] (groups of people).  [[Sociology]], [[demography]], [[marketing]], [[business]], and other [[Discipline (study)|studies]] use the [[information]] from people who study demographics.  Some demographics that many [[demography|demographers]] study are [[gender]], [[race]], [[employment|jobs]], and [[location]] (where people live). 
 
 ''Demographic trends'' are changes in those areas. For example, if a city was half women and half men in 1940 and was more than half women in 1980, and the number of women kept going up, that would be a demographic trend.
