Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime.  }} < /ref >

It is next to [[Russia]] in the north, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]] in the west, [[Iran]] in the south, and [[Caspian Sea]] on the east. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Baku]].  
 
 Azerbaijan also includes the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]], an [[enclave]], which is next to Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, and [[Turkey]] to the northwest. 
 
 Azerbaijan's land is both in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. This means it is a [[Eurasian]] country. Because Azerbaijan is close to [[Europe]] and its history is related to Europe, Azerbaijan is a member of a number of European groups, including the [[Council of Europe]] since 2001.  Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries.  They have membership in 38 international organizations. < ref name= " FCO " > {{cite web |title=Azerbaijan: Membership of international groupings/organisations | publisher = British Foreign  &  Commonwealth Office| date = | url = http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage & c=Page & cid=1007029394365 & a=KCountryProfile & aid=1019233781986| format =| doi = | accessdate = May 26, 2007}} < /ref >  On May 9, 2006 Azerbaijan was elected to membership in the newly made [[Human Rights Council]] by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. < ref name= " Un.org " > {{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/ga/60/elect/hrc/ |title=Elections  &  Appointments – Human Rights Council |publisher=United Nations|date= |accessdate=January 3, 2009}} < /ref > 
 
 More than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Azerbaijanis]]. Minorities include [[Russians]], [[Georgians]] and other minorities. The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] does not say there is an official religion. But, [[Shia]] [[Islam]], is by far the largest [[religion]] in the country, followed by [[Sunni]] Islam. There are also a small number of [[Christians]] (mainly [[Eastern Orthodox]]), [[Jews]] (mainly [[Ashkenazi]]), [[agnostics]] and [[atheists]].

 ==Economy== 
 {{Main|Economy of Azerbaijan}} 
 [[File:Azerbaijan economic regions.png|thumb|250px|right|Azerbaijan is divided into 10 economic regions.]] 
 The [[economy]] of Azerbaijan is based on [[industry]], [[agriculture]], and on [[service (economics)|service]]s including [[tourism]]. The [[energy]] [[:wikt:sector|sector]] based on the large [[:wikt:reserve|reserve]]s of [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]], is the main source of [[economic growth]] in Azerbaijan today, though half of the Azerbaijani people earn their [[income]] directly or indirectly through services and a third earn their income through agriculture. < ref name= " CIA " > {{Cite web |title=CIA World Factbook - Azerbaijan |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html#People |access-date=2012-05-07 |archive-date=2009-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610081951/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/AJ.html#People |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The energy [[boom]] has led to massive [[foreign direct investment]] and the growth rate of the Azerbaijani economy is one of the world's highest. < ref name= " LOC " > [http://countrystudies.us/azerbaijan/ Country Studies - Azerbaijan] [[Library of Congress]] < /ref > 
 
 After gaining independence in [[1991]] with the end of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan made the long and difficult change from a [[command economy]] to a [[market economy]]. The government has largely completed [[privatization]] of [[agriculture|agricultural lands]] and small, medium and large [[state]]-[[ownership|owned]] [[company|companies]]. Azerbaijan is continuing making economic [[reform]]s, and old economic ties and structures have been slowly replaced. With independence, Azerbaijan became a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], the [[Islamic Development Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]]. Azerbaijan's [[currency]] is the [[Azerbaijani manat]] (AZN) which is divided into 100 [[qəpik]]. It became the national currency in [[1992]] and replaced the old [[Soviet ruble]]. The [[Central Bank of Azerbaijan]] was created in 1992. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's [[central bank]], and is responsible for [[printing]] and [[distribution|distributing]] the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to control all [[commercial]] [[bank]]s. < ref name= " AZE " > {{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – General Information | publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_GeneralInfo/_generalInfo_e.html| accessdate = 2007-05-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070505020428/http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_GeneralInfo/_generalInfo_e.html| archivedate= 5 May 2007  < !--DASHBot-- > | url-status= live}} < /ref >
