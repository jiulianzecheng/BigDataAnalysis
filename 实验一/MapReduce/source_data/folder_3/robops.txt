“RobOps’ is an amalgamation of [[Robotics]] and Operations. It addresses the complexity involved in scaling operations, as operating large fleets of robots requires a unique set of processes, tools, and principles. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Flentge|first1=Felix|last2=Brunner|first2=Bernhard|last3=Jaekel|first3=Steffen|last4=Mateo|first4=Claudia|last5=Steele|first5=Paul|last6=Laroque|first6=Christian|last7=Lais|first7=Alexander|date=2014-05-02|title=RobOps - Services for Telerobotic System Operations|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2014-1870|journal=SpaceOps 2014 Conference|location=Reston, Virginia|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/6.2014-1870|isbn=978-1-62410-221-9|access-date=2021-12-26|archive-date=2021-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215190800/https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2014-1870|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Citation|last1=Cardone|first1=Mariarosaria|title=The METERON Operations Environment and Robotic Services, a plug-and-play system infrastructure for Robotic experiments|date=2016-05-13|url=https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2016-2474|work=SpaceOps 2016 Conference|series=SpaceOps Conferences|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|doi=10.2514/6.2016-2474|access-date=2021-12-15|last2=Laroque|first2=Christian|last3=Sarkarati|first3=Mehran|last4=Nergaard|first4=Kim|last5=Steele|first5=Paul|last6=Martin|first6=Sebastian|isbn=978-1-62410-426-8}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Jaekel|first1=S.|last2=Brunner|first2=B.|last3=Laroque|first3=C.|last4=Flentge|first4=F.|last5=Krueger|first5=T.|last6=Schiele|first6=A.|date=2015|title=ROBOPS - Approaching a Holistic and Unified Interface Service Definition for Future Robotic Spacecraft|s2cid=13793099|language=en}} < /ref >  Effective RobOps aim to make it easier to build applications that automate robot operations and inter-robot interactions. < ref > {{Citation|title=AWS IoT RoboRunner - Build Applications to Manage Robot Fleets {{!}} Amazon Web Services|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5iQ3e108uc|language=en|access-date=2021-12-15}} < /ref >
