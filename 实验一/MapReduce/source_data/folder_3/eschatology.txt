 '''Eschatology''' is the part of [[theology]]  that is concerned with what are believed to be the last events in [[history]]. It also looks at the [[destiny]] of [[Human race|humanity]] as a whole. Believers may call it the  " end of the world "  or  " end times " . < ref > {{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/endtimes_1.shtml |title= BBC - Religions - Christianity: End Times |work= [[BBC Online]] |date= 2011-07-19 |accessdate= 2017-11-10}} < /ref >   
 
 Eschatologies vary in [[optimism]] or [[pessimism]] about the future. In some eschatologies, conditions are better for some and worse for others, e.g.  " [[heaven]] and [[hell]] " . They also vary as to time frames. Groups claiming imminent (soon to come) eschatology are often called [[doomsday cult]]s.
