 '''Parasailing''' is a [[sport]]. Parasailers are put into a [[harness]] that is attached to a [[parachute]].  They hold on to a rope and are towed at high speeds behind a [[vehicle]] (usually a [[boat]], but sometimes a truck on land).  The parachute helps them rise up into the air behind the vehicle. People parasail for the thrill and also to get a good, high view of the scenery around them. 
 
 Parasailing is a popular [[recreation]]al activity that was developed in the 1960s. 
 
 Dangers include falling too fast while in the air with injuries upon landing.
