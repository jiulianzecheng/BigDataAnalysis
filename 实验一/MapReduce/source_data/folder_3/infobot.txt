 '''Infobot''' is a [[Perl]] [[IRC bot]], first written in 1995 by Kevin Lenzo. The bot's main goal was to remember [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] and associate them with a name, so if someone needed a specific [[Uniform Resource Locator|web address]] they could ask the bot. For this reason, the first Infobot, in the #macintosh channel in the [[EFnet]] [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network, had the nickname 'url'. 
 
 The main project is now inactive, many [[Fork (software development)|forks]] from the original program were made, some of which are still active. Many of these forks carry extra features.
