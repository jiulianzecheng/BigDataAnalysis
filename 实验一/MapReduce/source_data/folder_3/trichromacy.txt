 '''Trichromacy''' is a type of [[color vision]]. [[Animal]]s with this kind of vision see colors with [[cone cell]]s in their [[retina]]. The three types of cone cell are sensitive to different [[wavelengths]] of light. Color is constructed in the [[brain]]'s [[visual cortex]]. [[Human]]s and many other [[primate]]s have full color vision. < ref > Rowe, Michael H 2002. Trichromatic color vision in primates. ''News in Physiological Sciences''. '''17'''(3), 93-98. [http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/17/3/93] < /ref >  Most [[mammal]]s do not, because they have only one or two types of cone cells, which do not discriminate so many distinct wavelengths. Most other [[vertebrate]] < nowiki/ > s such as [[lizard]] < nowiki/ > s and [[bird]] < nowiki/ > s have four types of cone cells, hence can discriminate more colors than humans can.
