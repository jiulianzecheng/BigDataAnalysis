 ==History== 
 Moombahton was created by Dave Nada in late 2009. It was while he was DJing his cousin's high school cut party in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He blended the [[house music|house]] and [[club music]] which he had planned to play with the [[dancehall]] and [[Bachata (music)|bachata]]. The guests were listening to them by slowing down [[Afrojack]]'s remix of Silvio Ecomo and [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]]'s  " [[Moombah!]] "  from 128 & nbsp;BPM to 108 & nbsp;BPM, to create the basis of the genre. < ref > {{cite web|last=Patel|first=Puja|title=Hot New Sound: Moombahton Goes Boom!|url=http://www.spin.com/node/90428|work=Spin|accessdate=16 February 2012}} < /ref >  Between late 2009 and early 2010, Nada worked on a five track [[extended play]] of moombahton tracks that was released in March 2010, with the support of the DJ Ayres and the [[Tittsworth|DJ Tittsworth]] at [[T & A Records]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.djayres.com/tanda/index.php?%2Fprojects%2Ftapr0-dave-nada---moombahton%2F|title=Dave Nada – Moombahton|publisher=T & A Records|date=|accessdate=November 17, 2011|archive-date=October 13, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013180906/http://www.djayres.com/tanda/index.php?%2Fprojects%2Ftapr0-dave-nada---moombahton%2F|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Though not referred to as moombahton, the concept of combining reggae/[[dancehall]]/reggaeton percussion with electronic elements dates back further than Dave Nada. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://wayneandwax.com/?p=3309|title=Moombahton, Munchiton,  &  Related dancehall y Ear Candy|date=29 April 2010|accessdate=18 November 2012}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://generationbass.com/2012/01/11/life-before-moombahton/|title=Life Before Moombahton – (Pre-moombahton Music)|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=18 November 2012|archive-date=25 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025205433/http://generationbass.com/2012/01/11/life-before-moombahton/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Examples of artists which previously fused Latin and electronic dance music include [[Nadia Oh]], [[El General]], [[Masters at Work]], [[Munchi (DJ)|Munchi]], [[Luny Tunes]], [[Jowell  &  Randy]]. 
 
 Moombahton has also been incorporated into existing styles of music. It creates derivative genres such as moombahcore. That was a genre fusing the tempo and percussion of moombahton with the distorted sounds of modern [[dubstep]]. 
 
 In January 2012, [[Beatport]] created a chart for the top moombahton songs of 2011. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.beatport.com/chart/what-you-missed-2011-moombahton/44756|title=What You Missed 2011 – Moombahton|publisher=Beatport|date=January 4, 2012|accessdate=November 18, 2012}} < /ref >
