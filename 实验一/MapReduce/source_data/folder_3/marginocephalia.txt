 '''Marginocephalians''' (meaning  " fringed heads " ) are a group of [[Ornithischia]]n (bird-hipped) [[dinosaur]]s.  
 
 They can be briefly described as  " herbivores which defend themselves with armoured heads " . They are in two groups: the thick-skulled [[Pachycephalosauria]] and the horned [[Ceratopsia]]. They are all herbivores.  
 
 The Pachcephalosaurs had very thick skulls which (it is supposed) they used for defence. They developed in the mid-[[Jurassic]], and are common in [[Cretaceous]] rocks.  
 
 The Ceratopsia had horns, and we know they used them on predators. ''[[Triceratops]]'' is the key example. 
 
 Some of their features are not so obvious: They have a  unique palate (part of the mouth) and a short [[pubis]] (part of the hip).
