The '''adhān''' ({{lang-ar|أَذَان}}) or the '''azān''' ({{lang-fa|اذان}}) is the [[Islam]]ic call to [[Salat|prayer]]. The [[muezzin]] reads it out aloud. The root of the word is ''{{unicode|ʼḏn}}''  " to permit " , and another derivative of this word is ''{{unicode|uḏun}}'', meaning  " ear. " 
 
 The muezzin reads Adhan in the [[mosque]], sometimes from a [[minaret]]. He usually does this five times a day. Adhan is used to call other [[Muslim]]s to do the prayers. There is a second call, known as [[iqama]] (set up) that is used to tell Muslims to line up for the start of the prayers. Sometimes, [[loudspeaker]]s are used on the minarets.  
 
 [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] use versions of adhan which are slightly different from each other.
