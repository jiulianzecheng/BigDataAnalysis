 '''''Velocisaurus''''' was a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] related to ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''. Its remains were found in [[Patagonia]], in [[strata]] from the [[Cretaceous]] period. 
 
 This animal is known only from its leg and feet bones. ''Velocisaurus'' was probably around 1.2 meters long (4 ft). The foot is unique in that the middle (third) [[metatarsal]] (foot bone) was the main weight-bearing element. Its upper end has thickened and the shafts of the adjoining second and fourth metatarsals have thinned considerably. Such a condition is unknown for other theropods, including birds, but a similar set-up occurred in three-toed horses (like ''[[Mesohippus]]''). [[José Bonaparte]] explained it as an [[adaptation]] for a cursorial (running) lifestyle. He suggested that ''Velocisaurus'' was itself an omnivore, because the sole claw found, of the fourth toe, was not curved, but relatively straight. < ref >  Angolín F. Novas F and S.
