 '''Tokenism''' is the term used to describe the act of putting a person of a [[minority group]] (called a  " token character " ) into something for the sole purpose of trying to be seen as [[Social exclusion#Social inclusion|inclusive]] to that minority group. This is often done only to avoid [[controversy]], with little or no effort being put in to give said person a role other than being there to represent a minority. A  " token character "  is normally a woman or [[Race (sociology)|person of color]], while other common examples include people with [[disabilities]], different [[Religion|religions]], different body types, or different [[Politics|political]] stances. [[Stereotype|Stereotypes]] are commonly used to portray token characters.
