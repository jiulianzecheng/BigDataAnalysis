 An '''epiphyte''' is a [[plant]] which grows on another [[plant]], without being a parasite. The term is also be used for [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es which grow on plants. However, most epiphytes (89%) are [[flowering plant]]s; and about a third of all [[fern]]s are epiphytes. < ref > Hogan, C Michael, 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Fern ''Fern''. Encyclopedia of Earth. National council for Science and the Environment]. Washington, DC < /ref >    
 
 An epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it. The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses, [[liverwort]]s, lichens and [[algae]], and in the tropics ferns, [[cacti]], [[orchid]]s, and [[bromeliad]]s. 
 
 Sometimes such plants are called '''air plants''', because they do not [[root]] in [[soil]]. < ref > ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'', Unabridged. 1976. Vol. I, p764 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc. Chicago. < /ref >  This is misleading though, as there are many [[aquatic]] epiphytes as well. Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host; they are usually not [[parasite]]s. Parasitic and semi-parasitic plants, like the [[mistletoe]] are not true epiphytes. 
 
 Epiphytes usually use [[photosynthesis]] to get energy; often they have adapted their [[leaf|leaves]] to be able to capture [[rain]]water (and [[moisture]] from the [[air]]) if they are not aquatic. 
 
 Epiphytes are important for other [[species]] too, certain [[frog]]s live in the water [[reservoir]] of epiphytes.
