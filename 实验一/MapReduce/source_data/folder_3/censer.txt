 A '''censer''' is a container made for burning [[incense]] or perfume in some solid form. They are very ancient and have many different forms and are made out of many different materials. Many designs have holes to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning [[incense]] has [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Religion|religious]] connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer. 
 
 In Western contexts,  " censer "  is often used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely. < ref > [https://regencyredingote.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/pastille-burners-regency-glade/ The Regency Redingote], October, 2013 < /ref >
