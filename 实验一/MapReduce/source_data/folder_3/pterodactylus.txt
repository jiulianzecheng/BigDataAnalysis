 '''''Pterodactylus''''' (Pterodactylus Antiquus) was a small [[pterosaur]]. It lived in the later [[Jurassic]] period, at the same time as many [[dinosaur]]s. ''Pterodactylus'' is typical of the short-tailed pterosaurs. The sub-order continued to the end of the [[Cretaceous]], but ''Pterodactylus'' is only known from the latest Jurassic.   
 The first specimens were found at [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]] in [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. Also found in these strata was the famous ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''.  
 
 These [[carbonate]] [[strata]] formed in warm [[lagoon]]s. ''Pterodactylus'' may have lived on small islands in the lagoon, or on the coast. Perhaps it lived further inland and was blown here in a storm. The high salinity would support little life, so the pterosaurs would have fed in some other area.

 The first specimen was found in the 18th century, and a description published in 1784. Later, [[Georges Cuvier]] worked out that it was a flying reptile. A juvenile pterosaur came to light in 1817, and showed clearly that Cuvier had been right. Now, 30 specimens of the [[genus]] are known.
