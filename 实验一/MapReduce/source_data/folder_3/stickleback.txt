 '''Sticklebacks''' are [[fish]] of the '''Gasterosteidae''' [[family (biology)|family]]. FishBase currently recognises sixteen species in the family, grouped in five genera. Several of the species have a number of recognised subspecies, and the taxonomy of the family is thought to be in need of revision.  
 
 An unusual features of sticklebacks is that they have no [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], although some species have bony [[armour]] plates. They are related to [[pipefish]], [[seahorse]]s, eelpouts, and sculpins. 
 
 Stickleback species are found in fresh water environments in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. They feed on small crustaceans and fish larvae. < ref name= " EoF "  / > 
 
 Sticklebacks have strong separated [[spine]]s in the dorsal [[fin]]. All species show similar mating behaviour, with [[co-operation]] between the sexes, and protection of the [[ovum|eggs]]. The males construct a [[nest]] from [[vegetation]] held together by secretions from their [[kidneys]]. The males then attract females to the nest. The females lay their eggs inside, where the males fertilise them. The males then guards the eggs until they hatch. < ref name=EoF > {{cite book |editor=Paxton J.R.  &  Eschmeyer W.N.|author= Orr, James W.  &  Pietsch, T.W.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse/page/171 171]–172|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}} < /ref >
