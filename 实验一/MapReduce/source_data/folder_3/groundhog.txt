 The '''groundhog''' (also known as the '''chuck''', '''wood-shock''', '''groundpig''', '''whistlepig''', '''whistler''', '''thickwood badger''', '''Canada marmot''', '''monax''', '''moonack''', '''weenusk''', '''red monk''', or '''siffleux''') is a [[rodent]]. It belongs to the group of ground [[squirrel]]s. Those squirrels are also known as [[marmot]]s. The animal may also be called '''woodchuck''', or '''whistlepig'''. Groundhogs dig tunnels and live underground. Groundhog holes, called burrows, are easy to recognize; they are holes, about 9.in (inches) (23 & nbsp;cm (centimeters)) wide which usually have large piles of dirt and rocks at the entrance. Every single hole, may have tunnels which lead to as many as ten other holes, the tunnels are very large and can have chambers, like rooms, in them. Groundhogs can make their homes under trees, around buildings and in open fields.  
 
 == Problems == 
 
 Some problems with groundhogs are that they eat crops and dig around the foundations of buildings. When groundhogs dig around buildings this can cause damage if the holes go too far under the building.
