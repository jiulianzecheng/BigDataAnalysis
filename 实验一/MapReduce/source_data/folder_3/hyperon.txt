'''Hyperons''' are [[particle]]s that are made of [[quark]]s. What makes them different from other [[baryon]]s (particles made of three quarks) is that they must have at least one [[strange quark]], but no [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s. Strange quarks have a property known as [[strangeness]]. Strangeness causes the strange quark–and all other particles bonded with it–to not decay by [[strong force]], but instead due to the much slower [[weak force]]. Since all quarks are [[fermion]]s (which means that no two of them can be in the same point in [[Space (physics)|space]] at the same point in [[time]]), each quark has a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2, adding up to a total spin of 3/2 for a hyperon. This quickly [[radioactive decay|decays]] into a 1/2 spin particle. 
 
 Hyperons themselves decay due to [[weak force]]. There are dozens of different hyperon combinations. For example, a Λ ([[lambda]]) hyperon has a [[electromagnetism|charge]] of 0, and is often written as Λ < sup > 0 < /sup > . When it decays, it usually creates one [[proton]], and one anti[[pion]]. Like many forms of weak force decay, there is more than one [[Probability|possible outcome]]. A Λ < sup > 0 < /sup >  also has a significantly lower, but still possible, chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged [[pion]]. Λ < sup > 0 < /sup >  hyperons have an average lifespan of 2.6x10 < sup > −10 < /sup >  seconds, which makes it one of the longest living hyperons. 
 
 Scientists still study hyperons in labs across the world, such as [[CERN]], [[Fermilab]], and [[SLAC]]. Hyperons provide answers questions for problems such as [[:en:CP_violation|CP Violation]], in which [[symmetry|symmetries]] that were believed to be true may not be true.
