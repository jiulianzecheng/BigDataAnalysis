 An ambulance is a vehicle that is made to take people who are sick or injured to a hospital or other medical facility. Ambulances help people who are involved in life-threatening emergencies. Examples of life-threatening emergencies include heart attacks, road accidents, and many others. Ambulances and other Medical vehicles have specialized equipment that helps in these emergencies. 
 
 The first ambulances were used on [[Battle|battlefields]]. They were [[Cart|carts]] pulled by [[Horse|horses]] that were used to take wounded soldiers to field hospitals. Horse-drawn ambulances were common in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century. [[Automobile|Automobiles]] replaced horses in the early 1900s. Modern ambulances have equipment that help them deal with many situations. They can provide [[first aid]] or other [[emergency medicine|emergency care]]. Ambulances and other medical vehicles have specialized emergency lights,sirens and horns to warn people that they are coming down the road. Ambulances normally have [[Emergency medical technician|Emergency Medical Technicians]] (EMTs) or [[Paramedic|Paramedics]] working in them. 
 
 Ambulances are normally called by dialing a [[Emergency telephone number|special emergency number]]. This number is different for each country. In the [[United Kingdom]], the number is 999.  In the [[United States]], the number is 911; In Europe, the number is 112. A call to any of these numbers connects the caller to a dispatcher. This person then sends an ambulance or another Medical vehicle to the scene. 
 
 ==Crew== 
 An ambulance usually has two crew members. One person drives while the other looks after the patient in the back. A paramedic will have at least a year of medical training. They can do fairly advanced treatment. Not all ambulances have paramedics on them. In the United States, some may have Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). [[Emergency Care Assistant|Emergency Care Assistants]] (ECAs) can be found in the United Kingdom. In some countries such as [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]], ambulances may have [[Physician|doctors]] or [[Nurse|nurses]] on board. 
 
 ==Equipment==

 In the past, ambulances only gave patients a ride to hospital. They only carried a small amount of first aid equipment . This is still true in some parts of the world. Most modern ambulances will have more equipment and medicine. In some countries, an ambulance is like a mobile doctor's clinic. 
 
 Ambulances or other Medical vehicles have some or all of the following equipment on board: 
 *Collar: A special collar used to hold a person so they can not move their [[Neck (body part)|neck]]. This is used if it is thought that they may have damaged their [[backbone]]. 
 *[[Defibrillator]]: An electric machine that delivers electricity and restarts a heart that has stopped beating normally. Some defibrillators are connected to a heart monitor and use Manual Paddles whereas an Automated Defibrillator has voice commands and tells the emergency workers and bystanders to stand back so that a shock can be delivered.  
 *[[Nitrous oxide]]: Also known as  " laughing gas " . This gas is used to reduce pain. 
 *Heart monitor: This machine shows how well a heart is beating. As explained above, a Heart Monitor can have a Defibrillator connected to it. 
 *[[Oxygen|Oxygen cylinders]]: If a person is having trouble breathing, it often helps to give them oxygen from a cylinder. 
 *Splints: These hold an arm or leg in place if a bone is broken. They stop the broken bone from moving and getting worse. 
 *Stretcher: A stretcher is used to carry the patient in and out of the ambulance. 
 *[[Wheelchair]]: A chair with wheels used to carry a patient. 
 *Medications: Medications are found on Ambulances and other medical vehicles. Medications include Cardiac Drugs,Anti seizure medications and others.  
 
 == Air ambulance ==

 [[Air ambulances]] became more common in the late 20th century.  They are [[Helicopter|helicopters]] that carry much of the same equipment as a normal ambulance.  In the [[United States]], the [[Coast Guard]] runs a public air ambulance service using helicopters. These are often needed when emergencies happen at [[sea]]. There are also privately owned [[air ambulance services]] that provide for a wider range of needs, including international transport. Air ambulances are very useful when an emergency happens in a place that is hard to get to quickly by ground travel. 
 
 Air ambulances are very important in countries with low [[population density]] (few people, living in a vast area). Examples of these areas are [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]] or [[Finland]].  They can often save the life of a patient who would otherwise die because they could not get to a hospital quickly by other means.
