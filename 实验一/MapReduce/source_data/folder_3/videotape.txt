 '''Videotape''' is [[magnetic tape]] used to record moving [[image]]s and (usually) sound. Videotape was invented in the 1950s for recording [[television show]]s for later broadcasting. In the 1970s it entered use in low-cost [[filmmaking]]. In the 1980s [[analog]] tape became commonplace at home, and replaced the use of [[photographic film]] for home movies. Better digital videotape systems started replacing motion picture film at the end of the 20th century. 21st century [[video]] mostly uses digital recording media such as [[memory card]]s and [[hard drive]]s rather than videotape.
