In [[mathematics]], the '''quotient''' is the result of a [[division (mathematics)|division]]. For example, in the division of 6÷3, the quotient would be 2. Here, 6 is also called the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]], and 3 the [[divisor]]. The quotient can thus be expressed as the number of times the divisor adds together into the dividend. 
 
 On the other hand, a quotient can also mean just the [[integer|integral]] part of the result of dividing two integers. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2019-02-24|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants—for Integers|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|access-date=2020-08-27|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Integer Division|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegerDivision.html#:~:text=Integer%20division%20is%20division%20in,and%20is%20the%20floor%20function.|access-date=2020-08-27|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref >  For example, the quotient of 17 ÷ 5 would be 3 (since 5 goes into 17 at most 3 times), whilst the [[remainder]], the leftover of the division, would be 2. 
 
 Quotients also come up in certain tests, like the IQ test, which evaluates one's [[intelligence quotient]]. In this case, the quotient is the score of the test. In recent decades, as people begin to emphasize multi-dimensional personal development, other similar quotients (such as emotional quotient) are being developed and considered as well.
