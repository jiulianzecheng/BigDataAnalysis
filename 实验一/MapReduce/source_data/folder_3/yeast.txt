 '''Yeast''' are [[microorganism]]s. They are single-[[cell]]ed  [[fungi]]. There are about 1,500 different [[species]] of yeast. Most reproduce [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], by [[budding]]. Some use [[binary fission]] to reproduce asexually. 
 
 A particular [[species]] of yeast, '''''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''''', has been used for thousands of years. It is used for baking [[bread]] because the yeast makes [[carbon dioxide]] as a by-product of it eating sugar, which helps the bread rise ([[Leavening agent|leaven]]). Yeast is also used for making [[beer]] and other [[alcoholic drink]]s by a process known as [[fermentation]]. This process produces both [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and carbon dioxide. Ethanol is also used as [[fuel]], and to make other [[organic chemical]]s.  
 
 Yeast can be used to make [[electricity]].  Yeast is also a [[model organism]] for studying [[cell biology]]. Some yeasts can cause [[infection]]s in [[human]]s (they are  [[pathogen]]s).
