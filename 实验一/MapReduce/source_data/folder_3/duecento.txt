 '''Duecento''' is the name of the [[13th century]] in the [[Italian language]]. It is related to the culture of the Pre-Renaissance in [[Italy]]. 
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 
 The Duecento is considered the century before the beginning of the Italian [[Renaissance]] cultural movement in the [[Trecento]]. It is sometimes called ''Early Proto-Renaissance''. 
 
 One of the most important centres of art and architecture in this period is [[Florence]], a political, economical and cultural pole of Italy. Other important cities were [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Arezzo]], [[Mantua]] and [[Perugia]], all of them in the area of [[Tuscany]]. 
 
 In the Duecento Italy developed the [[music]] of the so-called ''Trovatori'', including Sordello of Mantua. From them later developed the classical music of the Italian Renaissance. 
 
 The main personalities in this century were: [[Dante Alighieri]] (considered the  " father "  of the [[Italian language]]); Guittone d'Arezzo; [[Cimabue]]; [[Giotto di Bondone]]; Guido da Siena; [[Nicola Pisano]]; Arnolfo di Cambio and others. Giotto, who was an Italian [[painting|painter]] and [[architect]] from Florence, is generally thought of as the first in a line of great artists of the Italian Renaissance that stretched until [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]]. 
 
 During the Duecento the religious figure of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] dominated the Italian souls. His poem ''Canticle of the Sun'' is considered a precursor of Renaissance [[poetry]]  < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_canticle_of_the_sun.htm |title=Canticle of the Sun |access-date=2013-04-26 |archive-date=2010-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122082357/http://franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_canticle_of_the_sun.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
