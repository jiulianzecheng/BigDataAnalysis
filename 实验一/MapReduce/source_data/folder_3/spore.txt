 '''Spores''' are the way [[Fungus|fungi]] and some non-[[seed]] [[plant]]s ([[fern]]s and [[moss]]es) [[reproduction|reproduce]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.pollenplus.com/spores/faq.html |title=Spore FAQ - Aerobiology Research Laboratory |access-date=2008-06-17 |archive-date=2007-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225600/http://www.pollenplus.com/spores/faq.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > Ingold C.T. 1939. ''Spore discharge n land plants''. Oxford University Press. < /ref >  They are also made by [[bacteria]] for long-term survival. Some [[protozoa]] also make long-term survival spores. 
 
 The spores of seed plants are single cells that grow into a [[pollen]] grain or the gametophyte inside the [[ovule]]. The structure of [[seeds]] in higher plants is more complicated than spores. The main 'innovation' of seeds is their nutrition for the developing embryo, which spores do not have. 
 
 == Fungal spores == 
 [[Fungi]] (for example, [[mushroom]]s) produce spores, which may be asexual or sexual. The asexual spores have inside them the [[Genetics|genetic]] material to make a whole new organism identical to its parent. < ref > Ingold C.T. 1971. ''Fungal spores: their liberation and dispersal''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780198541158}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Conidia''' are [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]], < ref name= " pmid11377860 " > {{cite journal |author=Osherov N, May GS |title=The molecular mechanisms of conidial germination |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Lett. |volume=199 |issue=2 |pages=153â€“60 |date=May 2001  |pmid=11377860 |doi= 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2001.tb10667.x|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378109701001781}} < /ref >  non-motile '''spores''' of a [[fungus]]; they are also called '''mitospores''' due to the way they are generated through the cellular process of [[mitosis]]. They are [[haploid]] cells genetically identical to the haploid parent, can develop into a new organism if conditions are favorable, and serve in dispersal. 
 
 Asexual reproduction in Ascomycetes (the Phylum [[Ascomycota]]) is by the formation of conidia, which are borne on specialized stalks called '''conidiophores'''. The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of these specialized conidiophores is often distinctive of a specific species and can therefore be used in identification of the species.

 == Bacterial spores == 
 [[Bacteria]]l spores are extremely resistant. Spores of [[tetanus]] and [[Anthrax (disease)|anthrax]], for example, can survive in the [[soil]] for many years. The origin of these spores was discovered in the 19th century, when a biologist noticed, under the microscope, a small, round, bright body inside bacterial cells. This survived even when the bacteria were boiled for five minutes. This killed the bacteria, but not the spores. They germinated when conditions were right. < ref > Kornberg, Arthur 1989. ''For the love of enzymes: the odyssey of a biochemist''. Harvard. < /ref > < sup > p186 < /sup > 
 
 ==Plant spores== 
 Plants have [[alternation of generations]]. One of the generations is the [[sporophyte]], which produces spores by [[meiosis]], and the other is the [[gametophyte]] with produces [[gamete]]s.
