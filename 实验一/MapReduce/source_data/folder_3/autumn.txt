 '''Autumn''' is the [[season]] after [[summer]] and before [[winter]]. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], this season is also called '''fall'''. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is often said to begin with the autumnal [[equinox]] in [[September]] and end with the winter [[solstice]] in December. In the Southern Hemisphere, it runs from the autumnal [[equinox]] in March to the winter [[solstice]] in June. 
 
 In many places in the [[temperate zone]], autumn is a time for [[harvest]]ing most crops. [[Deciduous]] trees (trees that lose their [[leaf|leaves]] every year) lose their leaves, usually after turning yellow, red, or brown. In many countries, autumn is the time a new [[school year]] starts. The period of school between the start of September and the end of December is often referred to as the “Fall Semester”, “Fall Quarter”, or “Fall Term”. 
 
 When it is autumn in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[spring]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. When it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere. On the Equator, autumn is very much like spring, with little difference in temperature or in weather. Autumn is a time when most animals are looking for food so they can store up for winter, because they soon will be going into [[hibernation]]. The weather gets colder and more windy.  In Autumn the hours of daylight and the hours of night are the same. In autumn the weather changes all the time. The weather turns cooler and often windy and rainy.
