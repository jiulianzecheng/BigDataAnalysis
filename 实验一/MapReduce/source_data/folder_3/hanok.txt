 A '''''hanok''''' is a type of [[house]]. It is built in a [[tradition]]al [[Korea]]n style of [[architecture]]. 
 
 == Features == 
 The main feature of a hanok is that it has combination of [[ondol]], the Korean under-[[floor]] heating system, and [[wood]]en floor for heating and cooling. This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a [[continent]]al [[climate]] and an [[ocean]]ic climate. 
 
 == Shape == 
 === Regional differences === 
 Hanoks have different shapes in different parts of Korea. In the northern part of the Korean peninsula, hanoks have the [[structure]] of a house with several wings. The wings are often built in either a [[Square (geometry)|square]] or the letter L. This helps keep the wind out of the house in the colder northern places and helps keep the house warm. These kind of house also has low [[roof]]s. In the warmer southern Korean peninsula, hanoks have a single wing and a wooden floor. This helps let the air in and out. 
 
 === Class differences=== 
 The hanoks is also different based on the class of the people who live it.  Hanok of [[upper class]] people usually have tiled roofs (called ''giwa'') while lower class houses have roofs made of [[rice]]-straw (called ''choga''). Hanok for the upper-class people are built not only to be homes, but also to be very [[ornament]]al.
