 In [[Buddhism]], the word '''sangha''' means  " assembly "  or  " community. " < ref > See, for instance, Rhys Davids  &  Stede (1921-25), p. 667, entry for  " Sangha "  (retrieved 2007-11-11 from  " Univ. of Chicago "  at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2839.pali{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}); and, Bullitt (2005). < /ref >   For Buddhists, there are two sanghas that are very important: 
 # the community of Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s 
 # the community of [[noble]] [[disciple]]s < ref > Bullitt (2005). < /ref > 
 
 In Buddhism, there are three things that a Buddhist shows the greatest respect: the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (the Buddha's teaching), and the Sangha (the Buddha's community).  So, for example, when the sangha is talked about in very old Buddhist books, the following words are often used: 
 : " The Sangha of the [Buddha]'s disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straightforwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully ... they are the Sangha of the [Buddha]'s disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world. " < ref > For example, this quote can be found in one of the oldest Buddhist books, the  " Anguttara Nikaya "  (AN), in a talk given by the Buddha called the ''Mahanama Sutta'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an11/an11.012.than.html#recall-Sangha (Thanissaro, 1997).] < /ref >
