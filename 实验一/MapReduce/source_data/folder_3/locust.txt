 '''Locust''' are the [[swarm]]ing phase of certain species of short-horned [[grasshopper]]s in the family [[Acrididae]]. Such swarms are usually made of a great number of locusts. They do a lot of damage to the places where they pass, by eating the [[crop]]s. 
 
 These are species which breed rapidly under suitable conditions. The [[migratory locust]] is the best-known example. They become gregarious and migratory when their populations become dense enough. They form bands as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and swarms as adults. Both the bands and the swarms are nomadic and rapidly strip fields and greatly [[pest (organism)|damage crops]]. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming practically all green material wherever the swarm settles. < ref name= " CurrentBio " > Stephen J. Simpson and Gregory A.

 The origin and apparent [[extinction]] of certain species of locust—some of which grew to {{convert|6|in|cm}} in length—are unclear. < ref name= " Encarta " > Encarta Reference Library Premium 2005 DVD. ''Rocky Mountain Locust''. < /ref > 
 
 Locusts are [[Entomophagy|edible insect]]s, and are considered a delicacy in some countries. There have been references to their consumption as food throughout history. < ref > {{Cite journal |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2005/4/edibleinsects.cfm |title=Edible Insects |author=Alison Fromme |journal=Smithsonian Zoogoer |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |year=2005 |volume=34 |issue=4 |access-date=2010-04-24 |archive-date=2005-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111041211/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2005/4/edibleinsects.cfm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2005/4/edibleinsects.cfm |title=Edible Insects - National Zoo & #124; FONZ |access-date=2010-04-24 |archive-date=2005-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111041211/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/2005/4/edibleinsects.cfm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 In the [[Book of Joel]] in the [[Old Testament]] locust swarms are described as a [[plague]].
