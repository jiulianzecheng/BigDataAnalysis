 '''Ashurbanipal''' (685 BC – 627 BC), the son of Esarhaddon, was the last great [[king]] of the Neo-[[Assyria]]n Empire. He established (started) the first [[wikt:organize|organized]] [[library]] in the ancient [[Middle East]], the Library of Ashurbanipal, which survives in part today at [[Nineveh]]. 
 
 In the Bible he is called Asenappar. < ref > See Ezra Ch4, verse 10. < /ref >  Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] identified him as Sardanapalus, and describes him as [[effeminate]]. < ref > {{cite web

 |author = Marcus Junianus Justinus|quote = His successors too, following his example, gave answers to their people through their ministers. The Assyrians, who were afterwards called Syrians, held their empire thirteen hundred years. The last king that reigned over them was Sardanapalus, a man more effeminate than a woman.}} < /ref >
