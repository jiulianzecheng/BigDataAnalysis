 A '''kilt''' is a ceremonial article of [[clothing]] worn in [[Scotland]]. It is made of a thick, woven [[fabric]] with a [[tartan]] (checkered) [[pattern]]. It resembles a pleated skirt except that it is worn by men. It is still worn during [[ceremony|ceremonies]] by some Scottish and Canadian [[military]] units and by people who play the [[bagpipes]] (a Scottish [[wind instrument]]). It is also quite commonly worn by men at [[wedding]]s.
