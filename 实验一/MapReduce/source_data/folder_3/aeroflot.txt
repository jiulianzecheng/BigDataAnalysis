 '''Aeroflot''' is the national [[airline]] of the [[Russian Federation]]. It's one of the oldest airlines in the [[world]]. It has been flying for over a [[century]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 Aeroflot began in 1923 in the [[Soviet Union]]. Much of Aeroflot's history was kept secret once the [[Cold War]] began and Aeroflot had to stop flying to the [[United States]]. 
 
 Throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s, Aeroflot and many [[Eastern Bloc]] airlines suffered many air crashes due to old and poor Russian airplanes. Those were the only ones Aeroflot and those airlines could use. However, Aeroflot was the world's largest airline until the 1980s. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/68F1kV80t |title=FlightGlobal Archive |publisher=Reed Business Information |access-date=29 March 2015 |archive-date=3 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203234412/https://www.webcitation.org/68F1kV80t |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  After the [[Soviet Union]] ended in 1991, Aeroflot began modernizing its fleet and buying more Western airplanes, like the [[Airbus A300]] and [[Boeing 767]]. By 1991, Aeroflot again started flying to the [[United States]]. Aeroflot is member of aviation [[alliance]] [[SkyTeam]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://sputniknews.com/business/20150609/1023107419.html|title=Aeroflot Successfully Cooperates With SkyTeam Alliance Despite Sanctions|date=6 September 2015|publisher=Sputnik|access-date=9 September 2015}} < /ref >  As of 2021, Aeroflot was flying to 146 cities in 52 [[Country|countries]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.aeroflot.com/cms/en/about/company_profile|title=Company Profile|work=aeroflot.com|access-date=29 March 2015}} < /ref >
