 The '''kilometre''' is a common [[Unit of measurement|unit]] used for longer [[distance]]s on [[Earth]]. The [[SI|international unit]] for measuring distances is the [[metre]] and a kilometre is 1000 metres. It is used in most countries for measuring road and sea distances. In the [[UK]] and the [[USA]], the [[statute]] [[mile]] is used more than kilometres for road distances and the [[nautical mile]] for sea distances. 
 
 It is often used to measure the speed of cars, planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour. This is shown as km/h. 
 
 It is also spelled '''kilometer'''. This spelling is used in [[American English]]. 
 
 One kilometre is 0.6214 miles (1093 yards or 3280.84 feet). This means that one mile is 1.6093 kilometres. 
 
 One kilometre is the approximate distance a healthy adult human being can walk in ten [[minute]] 
 
 A kilometer is sometimes called a '''klick'''
