 The  original Walkman [[cassette player]] was released in 1979. The name  " Walkman "  was used in [[Japan]], while abroad it had other names, one of which was  " Soundabout " . First the product did not have a name, and then one of the company's staff proposed  " Walkman " . Because it was a direct translation from Japanese, Sony's leadership seemed skeptical. They thought  " Walkman "  was not a suitable name for a device which was to be launched in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. 
 
 Sony used new ways to introduce its new product on the market and advertise it. The main idea of Sony was to make people aware that Walkman is a product that is unique on the market and that it is both new and fun. On June 22 (the date of release), Sony Walkman appeared in [[Tokyo]]. The company held an unusual press conference where different journalists were invited to [[Yoyogi]], which is Tokyo's major park. They were given a Walkman to prove that the portable player is fun and easy to use.  
 
 By 1995 there were already about 150 million Walkman portable players produced. Later, [[MP3 player]]s became more popular.
