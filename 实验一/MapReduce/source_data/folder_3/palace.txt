 A '''palace''' is a place with a grand and imposing building that is the official residence of a [[king]] or [[queen]], a head of state such as a [[president]], ruler, or leader. Many historical palaces are now [[museum]]s that show what royal and aristocratic life was like when it was built. 
 
 Besides, it can mean a luxurious [[house]] or [[mansion]] (like [[Biltmore Mansion]] or [[Hearst Castle]]) or a large building for entertainment: a large public or private building with an imposing ornate style, used for entertainment or exhibitions and large events.
