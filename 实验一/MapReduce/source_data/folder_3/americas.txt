 The Americas, or America, were discovered by Europeans in the late 15th century during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Christopher Columbus, sailing for Spain, reached the Caribbean islands in 1492, starting the connection between the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]]. After that, Europeans explored and settled in the Americas. 
 
 In the 16th century, powerful empires existed in the Americas. [[The Aztec Empire]] ruled central Mexico, and the [[Inca Empire]] controlled much of western South America. But when European colonizers arrived, conflicts happened, and these empires eventually fell. 
 
 During the next centuries, countries like Spain, Portugal, France, and England created colonies in different parts of the Americas. This led to changes in cultures, introduction of new diseases, and negative effects on native people. 
 
 In the 19th century, many American countries became independent from European rule. [[American Revolution|The American Revolution]] (1775-1783) led to the United States forming, and leaders like Simón Bolívar helped South American countries gain independence. 
 
 Over time, the Americas experienced important events like westward expansion in the U.S., the [[Mexican-American War]], the [[Mexican Revolution]], and the [[Cuban Revolution]]. The continent played a big role in [[World War|World Wars]] and the [[Cold War]] too. 
 
 Today, the Americas have diverse cultures, languages, and traditions due to their history of interactions between indigenous people, European settlers, and immigrants from around the world.
