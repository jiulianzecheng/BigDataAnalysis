 The '''Tango''' is a [[dance]] which was created in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The [[music]]al style that was created with the dance is also called 'tango'. It is danced today in two versions. Neither version is 'better' than the other; they are rather different in style. 
 
 == Argentine tango == 
 The first tango dances and music was called ''tango criollo,'' or simply ''tango''. Today, there are various tango dance styles, including [[Argentine]] tango, [[Uruguay]]an tango and vintage tangos. The Argentine tango is probably closer to that originally danced in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], though no details survive of its original form. 
 
 == International tango == 
 The tango is a standard dance in international [[ballroom dancing]]. This version was developed in [[England]] before [[WWII]], mainly as a result of the work of [[Monsieur Pierre]], a French dance teacher who lived in London. 
 
 The Tango is now danced in international competitions to a style first set out in English ballroom texts and regulations. < ref > Silvester, Victor. 1993. ''Modern ballroom dancing''. London. < /ref > < ref > Moore, Alex 2002. ''Ballroom Dancing'', 10th edition, London. < /ref >
