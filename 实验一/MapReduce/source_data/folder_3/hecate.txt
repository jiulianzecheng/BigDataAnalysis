 '''Hecate''' ({{lang-el|Ἑκάτη}}, ''Hekátē'') is the goddess of [[magic]], crossroads, [[witchcraft]], sorcery, ghosts and [[necromancy]] in [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek religion]] and [[myth]]. The daughter of [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]] and [[Asteria]] (twin sister of [[Leto]]), Hecate was a member of the third generation of Titans, but sided with [[Zeus]] and his siblings during the [[Titanomachy]]. As such, she was greatly honored by Zeus, who allowed her to operate on Earth, as well as the sky and the Underworld. A nocturnal figure, Hecate often dwelled in underground caves or in the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] itself. She was often invoked as a household deity, to provide aid in warding off evil spirits. Hecate assisted [[Demeter]] in her search for her daughter [[Persephone]] following [[Hades]]' abduction of her, guiding the goddess' path at night by her flaming torches. Afterwards, she frequently served as a companion of Persephone, joining her on her yearly journey to and from the realm of the dead. In later times, Hecate was depicted as a woman with three-heads, thought to represent the past, present and future. Serving as her attendants were the [[empousai]], a species of man-eating monsters who were vampiric in appearance with a leg made of solid bronze and the other that of a donkey. Often identified with the goddesses [[Artemis]] and [[Selene]], Hecate served as a representative of the harvest moon. Her symbols were a pair of torches, keys and daggers, and the serpent, [[polecat]], and dog were considered her sacred animals.
