 '''''Xenopus''''' commonly known as the '''clawed frog''') is a [[genus]] of aquatic [[frogs]] native to [[sub-Saharan Africa]].   
 
 Twenty species are known. The two best-known species of this genus are ''Xenopus laevis'' and ''Xenopus tropicalis'', which are studied as [[model organism]]s for [[developmental biology]], [[cell biology]], [[toxicology]], [[neuroscience]] and for modelling human disease and [[birth defect]]s. < ref name= " wallingford " > Wallingford J; Liu K.  &  Zheng Y. 2010.

 The genus is also known for its [[polyploid]]y, with some species having up to 12 sets of [[chromosome]]s. The frogs are all excellent swimmers and have powerful, fully webbed toes, though the fingers lack webbing. Three of the toes on each foot have conspicuous black claws.
