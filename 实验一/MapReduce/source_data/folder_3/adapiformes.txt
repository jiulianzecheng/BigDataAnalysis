 '''Adapiformes''' are an [[extinct]] group of early [[primate]]s. Adapiformes [[adaptive radiation|radiated]] throughout much of the northern continental mass, reaching as far south as northern [[Africa]] and tropical [[Asia]]. They lived from the [[Eocene]] to the [[Miocene]] epochs.  Some adapiformes looked similar to living [[lemur]]s. 
 
 Adapiformes are known from the fossil record only, and it is unclear whether they form a [[monophyletic]] or [[paraphyletic]] group. When assumed to be a [[clade]], they are usually grouped under the  " wet-nosed "  taxon [[Strepsirrhini]], which would make them more closely related to the lemurs and less so to the  " dry-nosed "  [[Haplorhini]] taxon that includes [[monkey]]s and [[ape]]s. < ref > Callum Ross, Richard F.

 == Fossil record == 
 The [[fossil record]] of the Adapiformes is quite considerable. The fossils are first found in the earliest [[Eocene]], 55 million years ago (mya). They lived in four continents ([[North America]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]). The Eocene was when the Earth was much warmer than today, with extensive tropical forests, far more so than today. The widespread remains have a much earlier origin, and [[molecular clock]] dates suggest that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before appearing in the fossil record. < ref > Hartwig W.C.
