Most favourable on it is soil-environmental conditions the western zone is. 
 Rather large specific territory of east zone are the so-called Black earths. 
 
 From the south the territory of Kalmykia is limited by Kumo-Manychskoj a hollow and the rivers Manych and Kuma, in a southeast part is washed by Caspian sea, in the northeast on an insignificant plot the republic border approaches to the river Volga, and in the northwest the Ergeninsky height is possessed. Within republic territory northern part of Near-Caspian lowland is called Sarpinsky lowland, and in its southern part there are Black earths. Dominating type of a relief of the republic, the large part of its territory, plains are taking. 
 
 == Minerals == 
 
 There are stocks of hydrocarbons, the basic reconnoitered and maintained — Iki-Burulsky and Ermolinsky nonassociated gas fields. Deposits concern to near-Caspian gas-oil provinces. 
 
 == Climate == 
 
 Republic climate sharply continental — summer hot and very dry, winter is snowless, sometimes with the big colds. Continentality of a climate essentially amplifies from the West on the east. Average temperatures of January on all republic the negative: from −7 & nbsp;°C …-9 & nbsp;°C in southern and its southwest part to −10 & nbsp;°C … −12 & nbsp;°C in the north, the minimum temperature of January: −35 & nbsp;°C … −37 & nbsp;°C. The lowest temperatures sometimes reach −35 & nbsp;°C and more low in northern areas. Feature of a climate is significant duration of solar light which constitutes 2180–2250 hours (182–186 days) per a year. Duration of the warm period constitutes 240–275 days. Average temperatures of July constitute +23,5 & nbsp;°C … +25,5 & nbsp;°C. The absolute maximum of temperature in hot reaches year +40 & nbsp;°C … +44 & nbsp;°C. 
 
 Air rise in temperature is observed from the north on the south and the southeast of territory of republic. During the winter period there is thaw, in separate days — blizzards, and sometimes formed ice aggrieves to agriculture, causing an icing of herbage of pastures and winter crops.

The annual amount of precipitation constitutes 210–340 & nbsp;mm. On conditions влагообеспеченности in republic four basic agroclimatic areas are allocated: very dry, dry, very droughty, droughty. 
 
 Thanks to prevalence of zones of strong winds the region has significant wind energy resources, realised only at a rate of 3-5 million kvt·h/year on Kalmyk Wind Electrostation. 
 
 == Nature == 
 
 In republic territory live about 60 species of mammals. On reservoirs of Kalmykia nest about 130 kinds of birds and more than 50 kinds meet during seasonal migrations. 20 kinds of reptiles and 3 kinds of the amphibious.
