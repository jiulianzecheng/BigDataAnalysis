 '''Downdrafts''', also known as a [[high pressure area]], clear sky area, etc. Downdrafts are [[wind]]s that diverge into the ground, this can form in the atmosphere. Downdrafts are caused by a [[force]] of an invisible rotating continuously sinking to the ground, forming a downdraft. Downdrafts are usually an opposite of an [[Updraft]], This leads the absence of clouds and precipitation, known as an [[Anticyclone]]; a continuously, invisible sinking rotating area.(for the downdraft) The cause of this is by High pressure areas, which they indicate clear skies, sunny days often come (in weather forecasts) lasting for days or weeks. It may also cause [[Heat wave]], and due to high [[temperature]], causing the body to struggle to regulate its temperature. 
 
 ==Formation== 
 When a high pressure area is surrounded by a low pressure area, a weather phenomenon appears. due to this, when a depression or [[cyclone]] has a path leading to the downdraft area, or a group of large [[cloud]]s that are low by their pressure, head towards the downdraft area, the [[Low pressure area]] becomes deflected by the [[Coriolis force]]. Large circulation scale of winds are at the center. After the formation, They are somehow large. A lack of these downdraft areas causes depressions to go where they head towards, These high pressure areas will never get updrafts, but 100% getting downdrafts. They are stationary. 
 
 ==Effects== 
 These places of downdrafts cause dry weather, frequent sweats, infrequent outside activities, etc. When they go over land, Fog can form overnight, and a clear sky with no single cloud at the center. If it gets rid of your area, your place is gonna finally have clouds, which is better. Cause of extreme heat, Everybody will suffer from very high temperature, then they might even faint too, they also indicate fair weather and [[Drought]]s too.
