'''Strategy''' is a word which was first used by the [[military]]. It comes from an [[ancient Greek]] word for the [[general officer]] commanding all the [[armed forces]] of a [[state]]. < ref > {{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Aviation |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag |first=David W. |last=Wragg |isbn=9780850451634 |edition=first |publisher=Osprey |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofavia0000wrag/page/251 251]}} < /ref >  A strategy is a long term [[wikt:plan|plan]] on what to do to achieve a certain [[wikt:goal|goal]].  When talking about the near future, people often use the word ''[[tactic]]s''.  [[Military science|Military theorist]] [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said  " tactics is the art of using troops in battle; strategy is the art of using battles to win the war " . < ref > Michiko Phifer, ''A Handbook of Military Strategy and Tactics'' (New Delhi: Vij Books India Private Limited, 2012), p. 1 < /ref >  Today, the word  " strategy "  is in common use; people might talk about  " business strategy " , for example. 
 
 The distinction between strategy and [[tactics]] applies to any [[planning]] which might be done against an [[enemy]] or opponent. Strategy is what we broadly intend to do to reach our long-term goal or [[wikt:objective|objective]]. Tactics is the detailed steps which are used as our progress is opposed by the opponent. For this reason, tactics are short-scale and flexible. Strategy, on the other hand, is changed as little as possible. It may be that our goal simply cannot be reached. In that case, a search goes on for a new goal and a new or adjusted strategy. Often, in war, [[chess]] or business, roughly the same tactics are still used to get to a different goal. [[Negotiation]] is another area where the distinction between strategy and tactics is especially clear. < ref > Schelling, Thomas C.1960. ''The strategy of conflict''.
