The hypervisor is the device or software which runs the virtual machine. It's typically responsible for allocating the resources, providing the interface between the virtual machine (the  " guest " ) and the host system as well as any management software. 
 
 eg: if you're using Oracle Virtual Box  to run a Ubuntu virtual machine, Oracle Virtual Box is the hypervisor.
