 The '''Salmonidae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[ray-finned fish]]. They are the only living family in the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Salmoniformes'''. It includes [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[Char (fish)|chars]], [[grayling (genus)|graylings]], and the subfamily known as the freshwater whitefish. 
 
 The Atlantic salmon and trout in the [[genus]] ''[[Salmon|Salmo]]'' give the family and order their names. 
 
 Salmonids look rather [[primitive]] for [[teleost]] fish. Their [[Fin|pelvic fins]] are placed far back, with an [[Fin|adipose fin]] towards the rear of the back. They are slender fish, with rounded scales and forked tails. Their mouths contain a single row of sharp teeth. < ref name=EoF > {{cite book|editor=Paxton J.R.  &  Eschmeyer W.N.|author= McDowell, Robert M. 1998 |title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse|year= 1998 |publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse/page/114 114]â€“116|isbn=0-12-547665-5}} < /ref >  Although the smallest species is just {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long as an adult, most are much larger, with the largest reaching {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. < ref name=FB/ > 
 
 All salmonids spawn in fresh water. In many cases the fish spend most of their lives at sea, returning to the rivers only to reproduce. This a [[animal migration|migratory]] lifecycle. They are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on small [[crustaceans]], aquatic insects, and smaller fish. < ref name=EoF/ >
