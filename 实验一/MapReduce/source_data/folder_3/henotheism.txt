'''Henotheism''' is the adherence to one particular [[deity|god]] out of several, especially by a family, [[tribe]], or other group. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Henotheism - New World Encyclopedia|url=https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henotheism|access-date=2021-10-20|website=www.newworldencyclopedia.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Henotheism is sometimes defined as a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] belief within a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god. 
 
 A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be [[worship]]ped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.
