 A '''vesicle''' is a bubble of liquid in a cell. More technically, a vesicle is a small membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances in a cell. Vesicles form naturally because of the properties of [[lipid]] [[membrane]]s. Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane, and release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other [[organelle]]s within the cell.  
 
 A vesicle is sometimes formed when the cell is doing '''endocytosis'''. Endocytosis is how a cell's membrane takes in a particle from the outside and brings it inside the cell with a vesicle around it. Vesicles are also more commonly known as nuclear membranes, because they're very similar to the cell membrane.  
 
 They can be found in animal cells.
