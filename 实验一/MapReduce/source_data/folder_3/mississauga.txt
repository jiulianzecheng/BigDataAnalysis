 '''Mississauga, Ontario''' is the sixth-largest city in [[Canada]] and the third largest city in [[Ontario]] (after [[Toronto]] and [[Ottawa]]). It borders the largest city in Canada, Toronto. In fact, it is a part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] is in Mississauga.

 == History == 
 On August 2, 1805, [[Toronto Township, Ontario|Toronto Township]] was formed when officials from [[York, Ontario|York]] (what is now the City of Toronto) purchased 84,000 & nbsp;acres (340 & nbsp;km²) of land from the [[Mississaugas]]. In January 2010, the Mississaugas and the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] settled a land claim. The aboriginal people received $145,000,000 from that. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mississauga.com/news-story/3149477-feds-offer-to-settle-land-claims/ |title=Feds offer to settle land claims |publisher=Mississauga News |date=2010-01-27 |access-date=21 November 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 After the land was surveyed, much of it was given in the form of land grants to [[United Empire Loyalists]]. They [[Emigration|emigrated]] from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during and after the [[American Revolution]], as well as loyalists from New Brunswick. A group of settlers from New York City arrived in the 1830s. In 1820, the government purchased additional land from the Mississaugas. Additional settlements were established, including: Barbertown, Britannia, Burnhamthorpe, Derry West, [[Elmbank, Ontario|Elmbank]], [[Malton, Ontario|Malton]], [[Meadowvale, Ontario|Meadowvale Village]], Mount Charles, and [[Streetsville, Ontario|Streetsville]]. European-Canadian growth led to the eventual displacement of the Mississaugas. In 1847, the government relocated them to [[New Credit|a reserve]] in the [[Grand River, Ontario|Grand River Valley]], near present-day [[Hagersville, Ontario|Hagersville]]. < ref name=MississaugaCityHistory > {{cite web|title=City History|url=http://carlwalwyn.com/city-history|access-date=21 November 2014|archive-date=26 September 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140926195226/http://carlwalwyn.com/city-history|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Part One 1819–1850|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/file/COM/9661_MeadowvaleBook_PartOne.pdf|access-date=21 November 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1873, the Toronto Township Council was formed to oversee the events of the various villages that were [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] at that time. The council's responsibilities included road maintenance, and a police force. Most of present-day Mississauga was [[Agriculture|agricultural land]]: including fruit orchards, through much of the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Exceptions included small villages, some [[gristmill]]s and [[brickworks]] served by railway lines, < ref name= " Mississauga Real Estate " > {{cite web|title=Mississauga Real Estate|url=http://www5.mississauga.ca/rec & parks/websites/museums/pdfs/history_of_mississauga.pdf|access-date=22 November 2014}} < /ref > < ref name= " Heritage Mississauga " > {{cite web|title=Heritage Mississauga – History|url=http://www.heritagemississauga.com/page/History|access-date=21 November 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 In the 1920s, cottages were constructed along the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] for people who lived in the city. 17 years later in 1937, 1,410.8 & nbsp;acres of land was sold to build the [[Malton Airport]] (later known as the Pearson Airport). It became Canada's busiest airport which also put the end to the community of Elmank. < ref > {{cite book|last=Cook|first=Dave|title=Fading History Vol. 2|url=https://archive.org/details/fadinghistoryvol0000cook|year=2010|publisher=David L.

 The township settlements of Lakeview, Cooksville, Lorne Park, Clarkson, Erindale, Sheridan, Dixie, Meadowvale Village, and [[Malton, Ontario|Malton]] were combined in 1968 to form the Town of Mississauga. At the time, both [[Port Credit, Ontario|Port Credit]] and [[Streetsville]] were left out and remained separate. The town name was chosen by voting. In 1974, Port Credit and Streetsville became part of Mississauga. In that same year, the [[Square One Shopping Centre]] opened. < ref > {{cite web|title=1968 & nbsp;– Amalgamation to form the Town of Mississauga|url=http://www5.mississauga.ca//library/SRC/MM1968_Amalgamation.html|publisher=mississauga.ca|access-date=24 August 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 On November 10, 1979, [[1979 Mississauga train derailment|a freight train left its tracks]] on the Canadian Pacific rail line while carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals just north of the intersection of [[Mavis Road]] and [[Dundas Street (Ontario)|Dundas Street]]. One of the [[tank car]]s carrying [[propane]] exploded. Since other tank cars were carrying [[chlorine]], the decision was made to evacuate nearby residents. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through Mississauga, 218,000 people were evacuated. < ref > {{cite web|title=Missisauga Train Derailment|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/residents/derailmentgallery|publisher=mississauga.ca|access-date=14 September 2011}} < /ref >  Residents were allowed to return home, once the area was safe. It was one of the largest evacuations in North American history. < ref name= " Mississauga train derailment " > {{cite web|title=Mississauga train derailment, November 10, 1979|url=http://www.carterrv.com/stead/1979/1979.htm|access-date=25 September 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 [[File:Mississauga overview map.svg|thumb|right|270px|Overview map of Mississauga.]] 
 Mississauga covers {{convert|288.42|km2}} of land, with {{convert|13|km}} of shoreline on [[Lake Ontario]]. < ref name= " census " > {{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E & Geo1=CSD & Code1=3521005 & Geo2=PR & Code2=35 & Data=Count & SearchText=Mississauga & SearchType=Begins & SearchPR=01 & B1=All & Custom=|title=Community Profile, City of Mississauga|date=2007-03-13|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2006 Census of Population|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912163313/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E & Geo1=CSD & Code1=3521005 & Geo2=PR & Code2=35 & Data=Count & SearchText=Mississauga & SearchType=Begins & SearchPR=01 & B1=All & Custom=|archive-date=12 September 2007|access-date=2014-11-21}} < /ref > 
 
 == Statistics == 
 Mississauga is a quickly growing and [[multicultural]] city. [[Statistics Canada]] estimates that Mississauga now has 704,000 people, an increase of 150,000 from the previous decade and the population has almost doubled in the past twenty years. 
 
 == Law and Government == 
 The city of Mississauga has only had four mayors in its past and it was created in 1974. This is because in Mississauga usually mayors serve for a very long time. For example, [[Hazel McCallion]], 99, has been mayor from 1978. The current mayor is [[:en:Bonnie_Crombie|Bonnie Crombie]] who assumed office in December 2014. 
 
 ;Mayors 
 * Dr. Martin L. Dobkin 1974-1976 
 * Ron A. Searle 1976-1978 
 * [[Hazel McCallion]] 1978-2014 
 * Bonnie Crombie 2014-now 
 
 ;Council 
 Mississauga is split into 11 wards (parts) each of them having their own councillor. 
 * Ward 1 Stephen Dasko 
 * Ward 2 Karen Ras 
 * Ward 3 Chris Fonseca 
 * Ward 4 John Kovac 
 * Ward 5 Carolyn Parrish 
 * Ward 6 Ron Starr 
 * Ward 7 Dipka Damerla 
 * Ward 8 Matt Mohoney 
 * Ward 9 Pat Saito 
 * Ward 10 Sue McFadden 
 * Ward 11 George Carlson 
 
 Also, Mississauga is the largest city in Canada where there are more women in the council than men. 
 
 ;Federal and Provincial Ridings 
 Mississauga has six legislative (government) ridings that are the same for the Canadian government and the Ontario government. The Canadian government has people in charge of those ridings called M.P.'s (Member of Parliament) and the Ontario government has M.P.P.'s (Member of Provincial Parliament) in charge of them.
