The founders of the company won a prize in the European competition of [[Startup company|startups]] The Europas in the nomination  " Best founder and co-founder of a startup " .  Among investors  & nbsp; —  Sunstone Capital, TED Conferences, and Accel Partners.

 === Platforms === 
 The company runs on the [[Freemium]] model, so free users should publish their presentations publicly on the Prezi website. There is a paid service that avoids this.  
 
 Prezi Viewer is a program designed for the [[iPad]] that allows you to view presentations created on the Prezi Desktop. Up to 10 users can participate in Prezi Collaborate at the same time.   
 
 === Nutshell === 
 The entertainment application Nutshell for [[iPhone]] allows you to glue photos into a [[comics]] with moving elements.   
 
 Nutshell creates a small square clip based on three images, which can then be posted to [[Instagram]] or [[Twitter]].
