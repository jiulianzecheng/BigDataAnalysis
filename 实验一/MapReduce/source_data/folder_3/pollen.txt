 '''Pollen''' is a [[powder]] made of pollen grains, which produce sperm cells (male cells used for [[reproduction]]) of seed plants. The pollen grains are actually [[haploid]] male [[gametophyte]]s. < ref > This is to do with [[alternation of generations]]. All plants go through a cycle with a [[haploid]] gametophyte alternating with a [[diploid]] sporophyte. In the case of [[flowering plant]]s the gametophyte stage is very small and brief. < /ref > 
 
 ==In flowering plants== 
 === Development of pollen grains === 
 The [[anther]] contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo [[meiosis]], and produce pollen grains, which produce the male [[gamete]]s ([[sperm]]). 
 
 The pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the [[carpel]] of the same or another flower. This process is known as [[pollination]]. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a ''[[pollen tube]]'' and undergoing [[mitosis]] to produce two male gametes. 
 
 === Pollination === 
 {{main|Pollination}} 
 There are two main kinds of [[pollination]]. One kind happens when pollen from a [[stamen]] sticks to the [[pistil]] of the same plant. < ref name=pollen > {{cite book |title= Blue planet|url= https://archive.org/details/blue-planet--level-2--english-through-science-_2003|last= Pous|first= Dinorah|year=2003 |publisher= McGrawHill}} < /ref >  That is self-pollination.

 The other kind of pollination takes place when pollen from one plant travels to the pistil of another plant. Most plants use this kind of pollination. Plants need help for this kind of pollination, because they cannot move. So, they need another way to move pollen from one plant to another plant. < ref name=pollen / > 
 
 The [[wind]] helps move pollen between plants. The pollen of some plants is very light. < ref name=pollen / >  Wind blows it from the flowers on one plant to the flowers on another plant. The wind can move pollen a long way before the pollen hits the sticky top of a pistil. 
 
 [[Animal]]s also help move pollen between plants. Many [[flower]]s are colourful and their [[scent]] attracts some animals. These flowers also make a sweet juice called [[nectar]]. Sometimes an animal, such as a bee, sees or smells a flower. < ref name=pollen / >  Then, it lands on the flower to get nectar. As the bee drinks the nectar, the stamens brush pollen onto its body. Then, the bee flies to another flower that has a pistil. The pollen on the bee's body brushes onto the sticky top of the flower's pistil. The pollen is used as [[protein]] for the bee [[larva]]e. 
 
 The plants help feed the animal. In return, the animal helps the plants by moving pollen from flower to flower. < ref name=pollen / >  The relationship has [[evolution|evolved]] together; it is a kind of [[co-evolution]] called [[mutualism]] or [[symbiosis]].
