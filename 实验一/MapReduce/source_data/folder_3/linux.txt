 '''Linux''' or '''GNU/Linux''' is a [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]] (or family of) for computers. The [[Linux kernel]] (the basis of the operating system) is [[free software]], meaning people can use it, see how it works, change it, or share it. 
 
 There is a lot of software for Linux and—like Linux itself—a lot of the software for Linux is free software.

 Linux is an example of [[free and open-source software]] collaboration. The [[source code]] may be used, modified and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the [[GNU General Public License]]. 
 
 == How Linux was made == 
 In the 1980s, many people liked to use an operating system called [[Unix]]. But because it restricted the user from sharing and improving the system, some people made a new operating system that would work like Unix but which anybody could share or improve. [[MINIX]], similar to Unix, was used as a teaching tool for university students to learn how operating systems worked. MINIX also restricted its sharing and improvement by its users. 
 
 A group of people called the [[GNU]] Project wrote different parts of a new operating system called G.N.U., but it did not have all the parts an operating system needs to work. In 1991 [[Linus Torvalds]] began to work on a replacement for MINIX that would be free to use, and which would not cost anything. Linus started the project when he was attending the [[University of Helsinki]]. < ref > {{ cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in minix? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix |message-id= 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI | url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b | last = Torvalds | first = Linus | accessdate = 2008-08-18 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.linuxinthechannel.com/minix.php |title=All about Linux |access-date=2009-06-06 |archive-date=2009-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704224445/http://linuxinthechannel.com/minix.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This eventually became the [[Linux kernel]]. 
 
 Linus Torvalds shared the Linux kernel on some internet groups for [[MINIX]] users. Linus first called the operating system  " Freax " . The name Freax came from joining up the English words  " free "  and  " freak " , and adding an X to the name because Unix has an X in its name. Ari Lemmke, who worked with Linus at the university, was responsible for the [[server]]s that Freax was stored on. Ari did not think Freax was a good name, so he called the project  " Linux "  without asking Linus. Later, Linus agreed that Linux was a better name for his project. 
 
 Linux relied on software code from MINIX at first. But, with code from the G.N.U. system available for free, he decided it would be good for Linux if it could use that code, instead of code from MINIX, because MINIX did not let people share or change it how they wanted. The G.N.U. General Public License is a software license that lets people change any part of the code they want to, as long as they share any changes they make with the people they give their software to and allow them to redistribute it for free or for a price . The software from G.N.U. was all licensed under the G.N.U. General Public License, so Linus and the other people who worked on Linux could use it. 
 
 To make the Linux kernel suitable for use with the code from the G.N.U. Project, Linus Torvalds started a switch from his original license (which did not allow people to sell it) to the G.N.U. [[GPL]]. < ref > {{ cite web | title = RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.12 | first = Linus | last = Torvalds | url = http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | authorlink = Linus Torvalds | date = January 5, 1992 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | publisher = Linux Kernel Archives | quote = The Linux copyright will change: I've had a couple of requests to make it compatible with the GNU copyleft, removing the  " you may not distribute it for money "  condition.

I assume this is going to be no problem for anybody: If you have grievances ( " I wrote that code assuming the copyright would stay the same " ) mail me. Otherwise The GNU copyleft takes effect as of the first of February. If you do not know the gist of the GNU copyright ─ read it. }} < /ref >  Linux and G.N.U. developers worked together to integrate G.N.U. code with Linux to make a free operating system.

 == Tux the penguin == 
 [[File:Tux.svg|thumb|100px|right|Tux the penguin]] 
 The mascot of Linux is a [[cartoon]] penguin named  " [[Tux]] " . When a person sees the penguin on software and [[computer hardware|hardware]], it means that it will work with Linux, and sometimes all systems that are like Unix. 
 
 The idea of the penguin came from the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. The image was made by a man named Larry Ewing in a competition to create a logo. The image, Tux, did not win, but it was picked as a mascot later. 
 
 Tux has now become a symbol for Linux, and sometimes even for open source. He can be seen in many different places and often, when people refer to Linux, they often think about Tux. Tux has even been included in many [[video games]], such as Super Tux ([[parody]] of [[Super Mario Bros.]]), Tux Racer (where players race Tux down an icy hill) and Pingus (like [[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]).

 == Pronunciation == 
 In 1992, Torvalds explained how he pronounces the word ''Linux'': 
 
 {{cquote|'li' is pronounced with a short [ee] sound: compare prInt, mInImal etc.  'nux' is also short, non-diphthong, like in pUt. It's partly due to minix: linux was just my working name for the thing, and as I wrote it to replace minix on my system, the result is what it is...  linus' minix became linux.|Linus Torvalds|comp.os.linux newsgroup < ref > {{ cite newsgroup | newsgroups = comp.os.linux | title = Re: How to pronounce  " Linux " ? |message-id= 1992Apr23.123216.22024@klaava.Helsinki.FI | date = April 23, 1992 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }} < /ref > }} 
 < !-- The above is an exact quote from the Usenet post. Do not copyedit it. -- > 
 
 Torvalds has made available an audio sample which indicates his own pronunciation, in English and Swedish. < ref > {{ cite web | url = http://www.paul.sladen.org/pronunciation/ | title = Howto pronounce Linux? | accessdate = 2008-08-18 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds/|title=Linus pronouncing Linux in English and Swedish|accessdate=2008-08-18}} < /ref > 
 
 Some English speakers pronounce the name as lee-narks or lee-nix or lie-nix. According to Torvalds, that is incorrect pronunciation. {{fact|date=July 2010}}

The study also said that if all this software had been made by [[proprietary software|proprietary]] means, it would have cost about $1.08 billion to make in the United States. < ref name =  " estimating_size " > {{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | date = July 29, 2002 | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/redhat71sloc.html | title = More Than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size | accessdate = 2008-08-18 | archive-date = 2020-04-28 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200428111826/https://dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/redhat71sloc.html | url-status = dead }} < /ref >  As of March 7, 2011, Linux kernel would cost about $3 billion. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/linux-kernel-cost.html|title=The Linux Kernel: It's Worth More!|first=David|last=Wheeler|website=|access-date=2016-10-23|archive-date=2011-08-21|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/616XYjg7d?url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/linux-kernel-cost.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Version 3.10 of the Linux kernel, released in June 2013, has 15 million lines of code, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-3-10-1902270.html|title=What's new in Linux 3.10|website=}} < /ref >  while the version 4.1, released in June 2015, has grown to over 19.5 million lines of code by almost 14,000 programmers. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item & px=Linux-19.5M-Stats|title=Linux Kernel at 19.5 Million Lines of Code, Continues Rising|website=}} < /ref > 
 
 Most of the code (around 71%) was written in the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[computer programming|programming]] [[programming language|language]], and many other languages were used, including [[C++]], [[assembly language]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Fortran]], and various [[shell script]]ing languages. A little more than half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. 
 
 == Different Linux versions == 
 {{main|Linux distribution}} 
 [[File:Fedora.png|thumb|[[Fedora (Linux)|Fedora]], a Linux distribution]] 
 People can [[download]] Linux from a [[website]] on the internet or buy it from a store. Sometimes books and magazines about Linux have a CD. or DVD. with Linux on it. Any certain version of Linux is called a  " distribution " , or  " distro " . A Linux version has the Linux kernel, G.N.U. software, and some extra [[computer program|programs]] that might not be a part of G.N.U. Different versions include different extra programs. The versions used by the most people include: 
 
 * [[Linux Mint]] 
 * [[Ubuntu]] 
 * [[Arch Linux]] 
 * [[CentOS]] 
 * [[Debian]] 
 * [[Fedora (Linux)|Fedora]] 
 * [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] 
 * [[Slackware]] 
 * [[openSUSE]] 
 * [[Mageia]] 
 
 People might pay some money for a version, so they can have a CD-ROM or DVD and to help the company to make their versions better. Usually when someone pays, it is so the company will help the user after they install it, which is called  " support " . 
 
 Software for Linux includes: 
 
 * The Kernel and the Shell. 
 * [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] allows users to run their own website. 
 * [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]] are [[desktop environment]]s. 
 * [[LibreOffice]] is for office work. 
 * [[Mozilla Firefox]] is a [[web browser]]. 
 * [[GIMP]], [[Inkscape]] and [[Blender (program)|Blender]] help people work with pictures. 
 * Games such as [[Tux Racer]]. 
 * The [[GCC]] [[compiler]]. 
 
 == Licensing, trademark, and naming == 
 The Linux kernel and most GNU software are [[software license|licensed]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). The GPL requires that anyone who distributes the Linux kernel must make the source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms. In 1997, Linus Torvalds said,  " Making Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did " . < ref > {{cite web | url = http://kde.sw.com.sg/food/linus.html | title = Linus Torvalds interview | accessdate = 2008-08-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311190841/http://kde.sw.com.sg/food/linus.html |archivedate=March 11, 2007}} < /ref >  Other key components of a Linux system may use other licenses; many libraries use the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), a type of the GPL that is less restricted, and the [[X Window System]] uses the [[MIT License]].  " Linux "  is a trademark of Linus Torvalds.
