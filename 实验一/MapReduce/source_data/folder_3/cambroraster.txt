 Hundreds of specimens were found in the [[Burgess Shale]]. < ref > {{cite news |last=Wu |first=Katherine J. |date=30 July 2019 |title=Meet ''Cambroraster falcatus'', the sediment-sifting 'Roomba' of the Cambrian |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/cambroraster-falcatus-cambrian |work=Nova |location= |access-date=31 July 2019 }} < /ref >  It was a large animal (for its day): it was up to 30{{nbsp}}cm long. It had a horseshoe-shaped [[carapace]], and probably fed by sifting through the [[sediment]] with its round mouth lined with hooked spines.
