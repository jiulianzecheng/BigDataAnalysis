However, some stories say that a baker named Gerard Kamphuisen may have created them around 1810.

 == Making Stroopwafels == 
 
 Bakers make a thick dough with flour, butter, sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. They cook this dough in a waffle iron until it is crispy. When the waffle is still warm, they cut it into a round shape and then slice it horizontally into two thin layers. They then spread a mix of syrup, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon between these layers. As this mix cools, it turns into caramel and sticks the layers together. < ref name= " waffleshop " > [http://www.stroopwafelshop.com/history.html History  &  recipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213123243/http://www.stroopwafelshop.com/history.html |date=2007-12-13 }}.
