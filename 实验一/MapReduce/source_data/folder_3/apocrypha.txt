The '''Apocrypha''' are religious texts that are in some versions of the [[Catholic Bible]]. Other versions omit them. The word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἀπόκρυφα}}'' (apokrypha). Apocrypha means ''those that were hidden''. Generally, the term is applied to writings that were not part of the [[Biblical canon|canon]]. There are several reasons why these texts were not included. The texts might only have been known to few people, or they might have been left out because their content does not fit well into that of the other books of the Bible. Some of the apocrypha were written at a later date, and were therefore not included.  
 
 The [[Authorized King James Version]] called these books ‘Apocrypha’. It separated them, because the [[Bible]] said so in [[2 Esdras]] 14:46, ''But keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people: For in them is the spring of understanding, the fountain of wisdom, and the stream of [[knowledge]].'' 
 
 [[Roman Catholic]] Bibles have these books in the [[Old Testament]]. They do not call them Apocrypha. They call them [[deuterocanonical]], which means that they belong to the second canon. Canon just means an official list of literary works accepted as representing a field. The first list is of books first written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This second list is of books first written in [[Greek language|Greek]]. 
 
 == Some say == 
 These books were kept in Catholic Bibles because it is believed that the Bible which Jesus read was a Bible that included the books of the  " Apocrypha, "  the deuterocanonical books. It is known that the most popular Bible at the time of Jesus was the Greek [[Septuagint]] version - which includes these extra books. That is why early Church fathers quoted from Bibles including these books. 
 
 == Others say == 
 [[Christian]]s disagree about the ‘Apocrypha’. Others point out that the ‘Apocrypha’ was in every [[Christian]] [[Bible]] until [[1828]]. 
 In [[1828]] these books were taken out of some [[Bible]]s. The [[translator]]s of the [[King James Bible]] said that these books were written to prepare the people for [[Jesus]], in the same way as [[John the Baptist]] did. They said that the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] used these books. And modern day members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (sometimes referred to as Mormons) also have hints in the  Book of Mormon.  
 
 There is no question that these books have always been part of the Bible in [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es, so they were definitely not added in the [[1500s]]. Around the year [[80 AD]], the [[Jewish]] Council ([[Sanhedrin]]) decided to cut the books from the [[Hebrew Bible]], but they stayed in the Christian Bible. Then soon after Christianity became the only religion of [[Roman Empire]] in the [[4th century]], the Romans decided to cut out all of the same books that the Sanhedrin had cut out, and they moved some of them to the  " apocrypha " .
