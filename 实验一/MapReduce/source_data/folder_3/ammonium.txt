 '''Ammonium''' is an [[ion]]. It is an [[ammonia]] [[molecule]], NH < sub > 3 < /sub > , [[protonation|protonated]]  (with a hydrogen ion added) to make NH < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup > . It bonds with negative ions such as [[chloride]] to make salts such as [[ammonium chloride]]. Ammonium is slightly [[reducing agent|reducing]] so it can react with strong [[oxidizing agent]]s.
