 [[File:Ethanol Flasche.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bottle]] of Ethanol]] 
 '''Ethanol''', also known as '''ethyl alcohol''', '''grain alcohol''' or just '''alcohol''', is a flammable, colorless [[chemical compound]]. Its [[chemical formula]] is [[Carbon|C]] < sub > 2 < /sub > [[Hydrogen|H]] < sub > 5 < /sub > OH, also written as C < sub > 2 < /sub > H < sub > 6 < /sub > [[oxygen|O]]. It is the active part of [[alcoholic drink]]s, which are drunk in most [[culture]]s worldwide. It is also used as a [[solvent]] because it can [[dissolution|dissolve]] many other chemicals and is not very toxic. [[Yeast]] makes most of the ethanol that people use. 
 
 == Ethanol fuel == 
 
 '''Ethanol fuel''' can be used instead of [[gasoline]] in [[car]]s and other [[engine]]s. Engines can use pure ethanol or ethanol mixed with gasoline. 
 
 In [[Brazil]], ethanol fuel made from sugar cane provides 18 percent of the country's fuel for cars. Because of this, Brazil does not have to buy [[oil]] from other countries. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=44896 |title=America and Brazil Intersect on Ethanol |access-date=2007-06-05 |archive-date=2007-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230948/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=44896 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 To do this, Brazil cut down much of the [[rain forests]] to grow more sugar cane, which is then fermented into Ethanol. 
 
 Most cars in the U.S. can run on fuels that have of up to 10% ethanol in them. Car makers like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[DaimlerChrysler]], and [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] also make vehicles specifically designed to run on higher ethanol blends. Some of their engines can run on up to 85% ethanol (E85). By mid-[[2006]], there were about six million E85-compatible vehicles on U.S. roads. < ref > [http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf American energy: The renewable path to energy security] < /ref >
