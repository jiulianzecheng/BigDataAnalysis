 The '''kinetoplastids''' are a group of single-cell [[flagellate]] [[eukaryotes]]. They include a number of [[parasite]]s responsible for serious diseases in humans and other animals. There are also forms found in soil and aquatic environments. They are members of the phylum [[Euglenozoa]].  
 
 Their main distinguishing feature is the presence of a [[kinetoplast]], a [[DNA]]-containing granule inside the single [[mitochondrion]] at the base of the cell's flagella (the [[basal body]]). 
 
 The kinetoplastids were first defined by Honigberg in 1961 as the flagellate order Kinetoplastida. < ref > {{cite book|title=Progress in Protozoology: proceedings of the first International Congress on protozoology held at Prague|author=Honigberg B.M|publisher=Academic Press|editor=Ludvík J|chapter=A contribution to systematics of the non-pigmented flagellates.|editor-last2=Lom J.|editor-last3=Vávra J.}} < /ref >   They are traditionally divided into the biflagellate [[Bodonidae]] and uniflagellate [[Trypanosomatidae]].  
 
 The Trypanosomatidae includes several genera which are exclusively parasitic. ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' causes [[Sleeping sickness]]; ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' causes [[Chagas disease]], ''[[Leishmania]]'' causes [[leishmaniasis]], ''[[Crithidia]]'' is parasitic on insects, and  ''[[Cryptobia]]'' is an [[ectoparasite]] on the [[gills]] of fish. 
 
 ''[[Bodo (genus)|Bodo]]'' is typical of the free-living Bodonids, and includes various species which feed on [[bacteria]].
