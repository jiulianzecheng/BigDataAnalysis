 ===Australia=== 
 Australian [[psephology|psephologist]] [[Antony Green]], who reports live election results for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), classified 11 federal seats as bellwether seats for the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]]: [[Division of Dobell|Dobell]], [[Division of Eden-Monaro|Eden-Monaro]], [[Division of Lindsay|Lindsay]], [[Division of Macarthur|Macarthur]], [[Division of Page|Page]] and [[Division of Robertson|Robertson]] in [[New South Wales]]; [[Division of Forde|Forde]], [[Division of Herbert|Herbert]], [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and [[Division of Petrie|Petrie]] in [[Queensland]]; and [[Division of Makin|Makin]] in [[South Australia]]. < ref > https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2016/guide/bellwethers < /ref >  Other seats sometimes considered bellwether seats include [[Division of Corangamite|Corangamite]] in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]; [[Division of Longman|Longman]] in Queensland; [[Division of Hasluck|Hasluck]] in [[Western Australia]]; [[Division of Hindmarsh|Hindmarsh]] in South Australia; [[Division of Bass|Bass]] and [[Division of Braddon|Braddon]] in [[Tasmania]]; and [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]] in the [[Northern Territory]]. However, many of these seats would no longer be considered bellwether seats; in [[2022 Australian federal election|2022]], when the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] lost power to the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]], the Coalition retained the seats of Bass, Braddon, Forde, Herbert, Leichhardt, Lindsay, Longman, Page and Petrie, while Labor already held the seats of Corangamite, Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Hindmarsh, Macarthur, Makin and Solomon, with Labor only gaining two of the mentioned seats from the Coalition (i.e Hasluck and Robertson).
