 '''Stolon''' is a term used often in [[botany]]. It describes a [[horizontal]] [[Plant stem|stem]] running across or just under the ground. A '''runner''' is a stolon which runs on the ground; a '''rhizome''' is the same thing, but running underground. Rhizome can be found in '''Ginger''','''Turmeric''','''Banana''','''Dryopteris''' 
 
 Plants with stolons or stolon-like rhizomes are called ''stoloniferous''. A stolon is a [[plant propagation]] strategy. At [[node]]s, [[root]]lets are put down and new stems are put up. All these plant forms are [[clone]]s from a single [[Genome|genetic]] individual.
