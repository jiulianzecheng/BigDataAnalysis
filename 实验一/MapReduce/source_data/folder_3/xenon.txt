 '''Xenon''' is a [[non-metal]] [[chemical element]]. It has the chemical symbol '''Xe''' and [[atomic number]] 54. It is one of the few elements that are a [[gas]] at [[Standard temperature and pressure|the standard temperature and pressure]]. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Sir William Ramsay]] and [[M. W. Travers]] discovered this element in 1898. The element's name came from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''xenos'', which means 'stranger'. 
 
 == Chemistry == 
 Xenon belongs to the group of the [[noble gas|noble gases]]. Noble gases are very unreactive. However, in 1962, chemists have found that xenon can react with [[fluorine]] under special conditions, such as high [[pressure]] and high [[temperature]]. It is not known why xenon behaves differently under these circumstances. There are also some compounds with [[oxygen]]. The gas is not very reactive, because if fulfills the [[octet rule]]. This means that a lot of [[energy]] is needed to remove an [[electron]] from xenon. This activation energy for xenon is 1172 [[Joule|kJ]]/[[mol]]. To remove a second electron from xenon, an energy of 2046.4 kJ/mol is needed. 
 
 Known oxidation states of xenon are 0, +1, +2, +4, +6 and +8. However, the most stable form is pure xenon, or the xenon's oxidation state of 0. Xenon has 8 stable [[isotope|isotopes]] and more than 30 unstable isotopes. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Xenon gas is used in [[Electron tube|electron tubes]], [[Bactericidal lamp|bactericidal lamps]], [[Trobe lamp|trobe lamps]], and lamps used to excite ruby lasers. 
 It has the atomic mass of 131.294 and is the 5th inert gas in the inner gas group. 
 
 Xenon is also a [[trace gas]] in the [[atmosphere]], occurring at 87 Â±1 nL/L ([[Parts per million|parts per billion]]) or approximately 1 in 11.5 million. It is also emitted from some mineral springs.[[File:XeTube.jpg|thumbnail|left|Xenon in [[Geissler tube|shaped Geissler tubes]].]]
