 A '''tuber''' is the thickened part of an underground [[Plant stem|stem]] of a [[plant]], such as the [[potato]], with [[bud]]s from which new plant shoots (stems and young leaves of a new plant) grow. < ref name= " smith " > {{cite book | last =Smith | first =Gilbert M. | title =A Textbook of General Botany | publisher =The Macmillan Company | location =New York | year =1937 |edition=Third |page=80 | isbn = }} Available on line in [https://archive.org/stream/textbookofgenera029793mbp#page/n93/mode/1up Biodiversity Heritage Library] < /ref > 
 
 Most tubers are formed in the ground, but sometimes they can be formed above the ground, in the aerial stems; that is the case of the '''air potato''' (''[[Dioscorea bulbifera]]''). 
 
 ==Functions== 
 Tuber stems (or part of stems) are made bigger to store [[nutrient]]s. [[Starch]] (formed by a lot of [[glucose]] [[molecules]]) is the most commonly stored food in the tubers, although other [[carbohydrate]]s, such as [[inuline]] (formed by many [[fructose]] molecules), are stored in the tubers of certain kinds of plants, like the Jerusalem artichoke (''Helianthus tuberosus''). < ref name= " fuller " > {{cite book |first1=Harry J. |last1=Fuller |first2=Zane B. |last2=Carothers |year= 1963 |title= The Plant World |url=https://archive.org/details/plantworldtextin00full |page=[https://archive.org/details/plantworldtextin00full/page/107 107] |edition= Fourth |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc |location=New York |id=[http://lccn.loc.gov/63010190 LCCN 63-10190] }} < /ref > 
 
 The purpose of tubers are saving food and [[reproduction]]. Under natural conditions, the parts of the stem that connect the tubers with the main stem die in the autumn or winter.  The tubers are left in the ground and are able to produce shoots from their buds the following spring. < ref name= " fuller "  / > 
 
 Potatoes are also [[artificial]]ly reproduced by tuber pieces, called  " seed pieces " . A tuber is cut into pieces, each with one or more  " eyes "  (an  " eye "  of potato is a group of buds covered by very small leaves). These pieces are planted and each produces a new plant from one of its  " eyes " . < ref name= " fuller "  / >

 A '''tuberous root''' or storage root, is a modified lateral [[root]], made bigger to function as a storage organ; sometimes these roots are called  " tubers "  but they are roots, not modified stems like the true tubers. They are thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to tubers. Examples of plants with important tuberous roots include the [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[dahlia]].
