She has been wrestling since 2001 and in that time has worked for several [[independent circuit|independent promotions]] across the [[United States]], with guest matches in [[England]] and [[Japan]]. She is known for her [[banshee]] gimmick, howling at her opponents and referees who stand in her way, as well as her unusually flexible body that allows her to perform, and be subjected to, modified submission holds. 
 
 For two years, between 2008 and 2010, she was a triple crown champion holding the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] for the second time, as well as the [[Shimmer Championship]] and the NWA Midwest Women's Championship. As well as being a two-time NWA World Champion, she is also a [[ChickFight]] tournament winner.
