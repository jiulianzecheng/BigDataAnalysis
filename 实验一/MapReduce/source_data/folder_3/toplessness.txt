 '''Toplessness''' (or being '''topless''') is a state of a woman not wearing any [[clothing]] above the waist, meaning the [[breast]]s are visible. The term used for a man is '''barechestedness''' or '''shirtlessness'''. 
 
 Because the female breast is often associated with [[sexuality]], some countries consider it alright for men to be topless in public, but not women. However many countries consider it usual for women to be topless, even due to the natural heat. 
 
 ==Barechestedness== 
 '''Barechested''' means not wearing a shirt. It usually refers to men.  It is very common in many societies.  Also very common in [[sports]] for a number of reasons.  Some reasons include, ease of movement, and cooling.  It is also common to go shirtless while working/doing labor. Before computerization of vehicles, it was common for young men to work on cars and trucks without a shirt.
