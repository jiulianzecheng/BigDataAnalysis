 '''Scratching''', sometimes referred to as '''scrubbing''', is a [[DJ]] and [[Turntablism|turntablist]] technique of moving a [[vinyl record]] back and forth on a [[Phonograph|turntable]] to produce percussive or rhythmic sounds. A crossfader on a DJ mixer may be used to fade between two records simultaneously. 
 
 While scratching is most associated with [[hip hop music]], where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of [[rap rock]], [[rap metal]] and [[nu metal]]. In [[hip hop]] culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ's skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the DMC World DJ Championship and IDA (International DJ Association, formerly known as ITF (International [[Turntablism|Turntablist]] Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched [[Hook (music)| " hooks " ]] often use portions of other songs. 
 
 == Subculture == 
 While scratching is becoming more and more popular in pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the [[DJ]] subculture. The [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]] from [[San Francisco]] focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs [[DJ Q-Bert|Q-Bert]], [[DJ Disk|Disk]]  &  [[DJ Shortkut|Shortkut]] and later [[Mix Master Mike]]. In July 2000, [[San Francisco]]'s [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided “the education and development of skratch music literacy”. In 2001, [[Thud Rumble]] became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} 
 
 In 2004, ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch Magazine]]'', one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and [[record producer]]s, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known ''Tablist'' magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an [[MC]] at events, and perform club sets.

 Scratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], some subgenres of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (notably [[nu metal]]) and some contemporary and avant-garde [[European classical music|classical music]] performances. For recording use, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record. 
 
 DJ Product©1969, formerly of the [[rap rock]] band [[Hed PE]], recalled that the [[punk rock]] band [[the Vandals]] was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching. < ref name= " beatdust " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.beatdust.com/graphic-nature/graphic-nature-dj-product-1969-hedpe-self-titled/ |title=Graphic Nature: DJ Product @1969  & #91;(hed)PE – Self Titled & #93;  & #124; BEATDUST |access-date=2020-02-04 |archive-date=2020-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204101537/http://www.beatdust.com/graphic-nature/graphic-nature-dj-product-1969-hedpe-self-titled/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Product©1969 also recalled the early [[rap metal]] band Proper Grounds, which was signed to [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]]'s [[Maverick Records]], as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music. < ref name= " beatdust "  / > 
 
 Guitarist [[Tom Morello]], known for his work with [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]], has performed [[guitar solo]]s that imitate scratching by using the [[kill switch]] on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is  " [[Bulls on Parade]] " , in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a [[Crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfader]]. 
 
 Since the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as [[nu metal]], exemplified by [[Linkin Park]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]]. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. [[Nelly Furtado]]) and [[alternative rock]] (e.g. [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]). Scratching is also popular in various [[electronic music]] styles, such as hard-groove [[techno]].
