 Supercharger -As at higher altitude the [[atmospheric pressure]] decreases due to which density of air decreases. Hence, to increase the density of air, first time supercharger was introduced in the [[Internal combustion engine]] of Aircraft which compresses the air through compressor wheel. It was working as a parasitic load on engine as the drive is given through [[gear]] train of the engine. So to overcome this situation Turbocharger was introduced in which drive is given through the pressure of exhaust gases.turbocharger is not used in ic engines.
