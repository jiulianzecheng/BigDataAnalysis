{{Judaism}} 
 '''Zionism''' is a [[Nationalism|nationalist movement]] that advocates for the creation and support of a homeland for the [[Jews|Jewish people]] in the [[Land of Israel]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Website of the World Zionist Organization|url=http://www.wzo.org.il/Mission-Statement}} < /ref >  Amongst Jews living in Israel, Zionism is generally associated with a conservative religious worldview.  
 
 The modern movement started in the late 19th century in Europe, as a reaction to increasing [[antisemitism]] and to ideas of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Lustick|first=Ian S.|date=2003|title=Zionist Ideology and Its Discontents: A Research Note|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41805179|journal=Israel Studies Forum|volume=19|issue=1|pages=98–103|jstor=41805179 |issn=1557-2455}} < /ref >  Zionism has had many different varieties that all shared the goal of creating a homeland for the Jewish People. The dominant variety at first was [[political Zionism]], led by [[Theodor Herzl]], but it later lost ground to the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Labor Zionism]].  
 
 In 1948, Zionism resulted in the creation of the [[state of Israel]].

 === Herzl and Political Zionism === 
 The word  " Zionism "  was first used in 1890. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite book|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9780511801075|title=An Introduction to Judaism|last=de Lange|first=Nicholas|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-80107-5|edition=2|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511801075}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  It comes from [[Zion]], meaning [[Jerusalem]], though it can also symbolically mean the Land of Israel as a whole. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/196302306|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament : wisdom, poetry  &  writings|date=2008|publisher=IVP Academic|others=Tremper, III Longman, Peter Enns|isbn=978-0-8308-1783-2|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|oclc=196302306}} < /ref > < ref name= " :2 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1088892051|title=The first Zionist Congress : an annotated translation of the proceedings|date=2019|others=Michael J.

In the early 19th century, assimilation and legal [[emancipation]] were popular ideas among Jews in western Europe. However, in the late 19th century anti-Semitism became a bigger threat, with the 1881 Russian [[Pogrom|pogroms]] and the [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfus affair]] in France. < ref name= " :0 "  / > < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/903689958|title=Zionist Idea : a Historical Analysis and Reader|last=Arthur.|first=Hertzberg|isbn=978-0-8276-1231-0|oclc=903689958}} < /ref >  This caused some Jewish thinkers to lose faith in the idea of ever being accepted in [[gentile]] societies. One of these thinkers was Theodor Herzl, who is often considered the father of modern Political Zionism. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  In his book, ''the Jewish State,'' Herzl writes that the distinct status of Jews neither can, nor should, be changed. Instead he believed that antisemitism could be stopped by making the Jewish people a nation like any other, through giving them their own land. At the time there were multiple territories up for consideration, the most important being [[Argentina]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Herzl argues in favor of Palestine, thinking it would attract more people because of its status as the historic homeland of the Jews. < ref name= " :3 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18191925|title=The Jewish state|last=Herzl|first=Theodor|date=1896|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-25849-1|location=New York|oclc=18191925}} < /ref >  Political Zionism was a secular movement and it was out of pragmatic considerations, rather than religious beliefs, that Palestine was chosen. < ref name= " :2 "  / >  In 1897 Herzl led the [[First Zionist Congress]]. There the [[Basel Program]] was adopted, espousing political Zionism and a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel. The [[World Zionist Organization]] was created at the congress to support this goal. < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref > {{Cite book|last=Friedman|first=Mordechai (Motti)|date=2021-05-20|title=Theodor Herzl's Zionist Journey – Exodus and Return|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110729283|doi=10.1515/9783110729283|isbn=9783110729283 |s2cid=236374854 }} < /ref >  There were many more congresses after this, and at the fifth Zionist Congress in 1901 the Jewish National Fund was established with the goal of purchasing land in Palestine. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Jewish National Fund (JNF) {{!}} Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Orgs/jnf.html|access-date=2022-05-16|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}} < /ref >     
 
 Political Zionism wanted to work with the established powers to get a publicly recognized and legally assured homeland. Palestine at the time was under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but Herzl's attempts to get support from the Ottomans failed, and he had to appeal to the imperial powers of Europe. < ref name= " :2 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / >  Herzl negotiated with British and Russian officials to use their influence to get official support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, but this failed as well. < ref name= " :1 "  / > < ref name= " :3 "  / >  In 1903 the British offered Herzl a Jewish homeland in Uganda instead, but this was eventually rejected by the Zionist congress. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Uganda Proposal (1903) {{!}} Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/Uganda.html|access-date=2022-05-16|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}} < /ref >  Only during [[World War I]] did the Zionist movement get the great power support they had been seeking. In 1917 the British signed the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], wherein they declared that they  " favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Text of the Balfour Declaration|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/text-of-the-balfour-declaration|access-date=2022-05-17|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}} < /ref >  Part of the British motivation in signing was getting support of Jews in Russia and the U.S.A. for the allied cause. < ref name= " :4 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44957427|title=Comrades and enemies : Arab and Jewish workers in Palestine, 1906-1948|last=Lockman|first=Zachary|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91749-1|location=Berkeley|oclc=44957427}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=MATHEW|first=WILLIAM M.|date=2013|title=The Balfour Declaration and the Palestine Mandate, 1917—1923: British Imperialist Imperatives|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23525764|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=40|issue=3|pages=231–250|doi=10.1080/13530194.2013.791133 |jstor=23525764 |s2cid=159474306 |issn=1353-0194}} < /ref >  After the war, the British Empire took control of Palestine and administered it as their own colony, the [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate of Palestine]].

 === Labor Zionism in Ottoman and British Palestine === 
 Organized Jewish migration into Palestine began after the pogroms of 1881 with the [[Hibbat Zion]] movement. However, even when they later joined forces with the Zionist congress it remained a small movement, as most Jewish migrants went to the United States. Only 3% of the Jews fleeing eastern Europe between 1881 and World War I went to Palestine. < ref name= " :4 "  / >  In the first wave of migration, known as the first [[Aliyah]], the Jewish immigrants established agricultural colonies called moshavot. These settlements were poor, and so the immigrants turned to outside sponsors for help, who funded the development of other systems. The farms were turned into wine and citrus plantations based on the model of [[French Algeria]], where they employed mostly cheaper Palestinian labor. < ref name= " :4 "  / > < ref name= " :5 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44960490|title=Land, labor, and the origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 1882-1914|last=Shafir|first=Gershon|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91741-5|edition=Updated|location=Berkeley|oclc=44960490}} < /ref >  Jewish workers had to compete with Palestinian workers, which lowered their wages. < ref name= " :5 "  / >  The immigrants of the second Aliyah of 1905 included many socialists. < ref name= " :6 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317401279|title=Crisis, revolution, and Russian Jews|last=Frankel|first=Jonathan|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-48061-4|location=Cambridge|oclc=317401279}} < /ref >  They thought that they needed higher wages for the Jewish workers in order to attract immigrants for the Zionist project. They wanted a  " conquest of labor " , fighting the landowners for better working conditions, but also trying to exclude Arab workers from these jobs to give them to Jewish workers. < ref name= " :5 "  / >   
 
 This was the beginning of Labor Zionism, which would overtake Political Zionism as the dominant variety after World War I. Labor Zionism was influenced by socialist ideals, and believed that to build a Jewish state a strong Jewish working class had to be created as well. They established farms called [[Kibbutz|kibbutzim]] where all the workers collectively owned the land. In 1920 they formed the [[Histadrut]], a trade union that eventually gained control of large sectors of the economy, becoming one of the largest employers for Jewish workers. The secretary of the Histadrut, [[David Ben-Gurion]], became the unofficial leader of the Zionist movement in 1935 when he became chairman of the [[Jewish Agency]]. < ref name= " :4 "  / >  In 1948 he declared the establishment of a Jewish State in the Land of Israel and became Israel's first prime minister. < ref name= " :6 "  / > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Israeli Declaration of Independence|url=https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/about/pages/declaration.aspx|access-date=2022-05-17|website=main.knesset.gov.il}} < /ref > 
 
 === Current views === 
 Some Zionists believe that Israel should control the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Other Zionists support a [[Two-state solution]] in which Israel and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] are separate countries. The entire region is the subject of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. 
 
 Out of the conflict and segregation in Palestine, [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] of [[African Union]] condemns Zionism as human rights violation, as well as [[apartheid]] and [[colonialism]]. < ref > African Charter of Human and People's Rights, Preamble < /ref >
