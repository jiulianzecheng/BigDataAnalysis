 '''''Chobits''''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] and [[anime]] series created by [[Clamp (manga artists)|CLAMP]].  
 
 == Plot == 
 The story is mostly about the life of [http://chobits.wikia.com/wiki/Hideki_Motosuwa Hideki Motosuwa] who did not make it into a [[university]], and so is called a 'ronin', a repeat [[student]]. Hideki tries to get into a university by moving from his farm and studying at Seki, a cram school in [[Tokyo]]. He is not used to women, but likes to [[imagination|imagine]] that he is. He wants to have a girlfriend and a 'Persocom'. A Persocom is a kind of [[robot]] that looks like a person, but can be used like a computer, phone, and a  " partner "  in some cases.  
 
 One evening when Hideki is walking home from the grocery store, he finds a unique Persocom on a curb. It is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair, wrapped in white cloth, lying against a pile of [[trash bags]]. He takes the Persocom home. Hideki looks all over the Persocom's body for a switch to turn her on, and finds it between her legs. He turns her on and asks her questions, but all she can say is  " chi " , so Hideki names her [http://chobits.wikia.com/wiki/Chi_(Elda)_Motosuwa Chi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231145449/http://chobits.wikia.com/wiki/Chi_(Elda)_Motosuwa |date=2014-12-31 }}  < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://chobits.wikia.com/wiki/Chi_(Elda)_Motosuwa |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-03 |archive-date=2014-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231145449/http://chobits.wikia.com/wiki/Chi_(Elda)_Motosuwa |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Anime == 
 The anime has 26 episodes and was [[broadcast]] across [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] by the anime [[television]] network, Animax. Episodes 9, 18, and an extra 27th [[OVA]] episode are used as  " recap "  episodes, looking back on the events that happened previously. The episodes were given different numbers for the DVD release because the original recap episodes were not included as part of the main anime, instead being published together on the final DVD and re-numbered as 8.5, 16.5 and 24.5 making the series only 24 episodes. 
 
 There is a 6-minute special episode:  " Sumomo and Kotoko on a Quest " , or  " Chibits " , which is about Sumomo and Kotoko. 
 
 The series was supervised by Morio Asaka, and Hisashi Abe was the character designer and the [[animation]] director. The ending to the [[anime]] series is different from the manga. One thing that is different is that there is no allusion to Hideki never having Chi because of where her switch is, and the new part of Freya taking over Chi's body and asking her mother Chitose to shut them down, saying the Chobits series is a failure, and the activation of the program after all, although the effect on Persocons is not the same as in the manga.
