 '''Tuberculosis (TB)''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by [[bacteria]]. In the past, people called it '''consumption'''. 
 
 TB is caused by several types of [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]], usually ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. < ref name= " Robbins " / >  The disease usually attacks the [[lung]]s, but it can also affect other parts of the body. 
 
 == How it spreads == 
 The bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people [[cough]], [[sneeze]], or spit. < ref name= " AP " > {{cite journal|author = Konstantinos A|year = 2010|title = Testing for tuberculosis|journal = Australian Prescriber|volume = 33|issue = 1|pages = 12–18|doi = 10.18773/austprescr.2010.005|url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/1/12/18/}} < /ref > 
 
 Of every 100 people with TB, between five and ten people show [[symptom]]s. < ref name= " Pet2005 " > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/181343640|title=Evidence-based respiratory medicine|date=2005|publisher=BMJ Books/Blackwell Pub|isbn=978-0-470-98737-7|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=181343640}} < /ref >   In these people, the disease is called ''active''.  Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment. 
 
 ==Detection and treatment== 
 [[File:TB Culture.jpg|thumb|A close up of a culture of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. The patches that look like foam are the typical growth pattern of these bacteria|78x78px]] 
 
 [[Diagnosis]] of active TB relies on [[radiology]]. Doctors often look at an [[X-ray]] of the [[chest]]. In addition, they check body [[fluid]]s. These fluids have [[microbe]]s in them, which are grown in [[cell culture]]s. The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB. 
 
 If the patient has TB, but does not show symptoms, the disease is 'latent'. Doctors use a [[skin]] test, called the [[Mantoux test]], to detect latent TB. They often do [[blood]] tests too. 
 
 There is a [[vaccine]] against some forms of tuberculosis. It is called the [[bacillus Calmette-Guérin|Bacillus Calmette & ndash;Guérin]] vaccine. 
 
 TB used to be easily treated and cured with [[antibiotics]]. However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics. This resistance makes treatment difficult. Many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time. There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to ''all'' [[drug]]s. 
 
 == Symptoms == 
 Tuberculosis can have many symptoms.  The most common include: 
 * A cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis) 
 * Chest pain 
 * Not having any [[appetite]] 
 * Weakness 
 * Weight loss 
 * Chills 
 * Very pale skin 
 * Listless eyes  
 * [[Fever]] 
 * [[Sweat]]ing a lot at night 
 * [[Dyspnea|Difficulty breathing]] 
 * [[Fatigue|Feeling very tired]] 
 * People are also more likely to get tuberculosis if they live close to other people who have TB.  For example, TB can spread easily in [[homeless shelter]]s, [[prison]]s, and [[Immigration|immigrant]] communities.

 Experts believe that one third of the [[world population]] is infected with ''M. tuberculosis''. < ref name=WHO2012data > {{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html|title=Tuberculosis Fact sheet N°104|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|date=November 2010|access-date=26 July 2011}} < /ref >   New infections occur at a rate of one per second. < ref name=WHO2012data/ >  In 2007, about 13.7 million [[chronic]] cases were active globally. < ref name=WHO2009-Epidemiology > {{cite book |title=Global tuberculosis control: epidemiology, strategy, financing |author=World Health Organization |year=2009 |isbn=978-92-4-156380-2 |chapter=Epidemiology |chapter-url=http://who.int/entity/tb/publications/global_report/2009/pdf/chapter1.pdf |access-date=12 November 2009 |pages=6–33 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  In 2010, about 8.8 & nbsp;million new cases developed and nearly 1.5 & nbsp;million people died from the disease, most of them  in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. < ref name=WHO2011 > {{cite web|title=The sixteenth global report on tuberculosis|author=World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2011/gtbr11_executive_summary.pdf|year=2011}} < /ref >  The number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002. < ref name=WHO2011/ > 
 
 Tuberculosis does not happen at the same rate around the world. About eighty percent of the population in many [[Asia]]n and [[Africa]]n countries test positive for TB, but only five to ten percent of people in the United States do. < ref name= " Robbins " > {{cite book |author = Kumar V.

 People usually get tuberculosis because of a weakened [[immune system]]. Many people with [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] can also get tuberculosis. < ref name= " Lancet11 " > {{cite journal|title=Tuberculosis|journal=Lancet|date= 2011|volume=378|issue=9785|pages=57–72|pmid=21420161|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62173-3|s2cid=208791546|last1=Lawn|first1=Stephen D.|last2=Zumla|first2=Alimuddin I.}} < /ref >
