 '''Overweight''' is the condition of a [[person]] when they have more [[fat]] in their [[body]] than is [[healthy]]. 
 
 Overweight means the person's body is too heavy. To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their [[body mass index]]. People with a [[BMI]] of 25 or more are overweight. Anything above 30 is [[obese]] (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/9806/17/weight.guidelines/|title=CNN - Who's fat? New definition adopted - June 17, 1998|website=edition.cnn.com}} < /ref > 
 
 Being overweight is associated with [[health]] problems such as [[Type 2 diabetes]]. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17227327|title=How many cases of Type 2 diabetes mellitus are due to being overweight in middle age?

In 2006  Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa055643|title=Overweight, Obesity, and Mortality in a Large Prospective Cohort of Persons 50 to 71 Years Old|first1=Kenneth F.|last1=Adams|first2=Arthur|last2=Schatzkin|first3=Tamara B.|last3=Harris|first4=Victor|last4=Kipnis|first5=Traci|last5=Mouw|first6=Rachel|last6=Ballard-Barbash|first7=Albert|last7=Hollenbeck|first8=Michael F.|last8=Leitzmann|date=24 August 2006|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=355|issue=8|pages=763–778|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa055643|pmid=16926275}} < /ref >  Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 [[PubMed]] articles with a [[sample size]] of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137|title=Association of All-Cause Mortality With Overweight and Obesity Using Standard Body Mass Index Categories: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|first1=Barry I.|last1=Graubard|first2=Heather|last2=Orpana|first3=Brian K.|last3=Kit|first4=Katherine M.|last4=Flegal|date=2 January 2013|journal=JAMA|volume=309|issue=1|pages=71–82|via=jamanetwork.com|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.113905|pmid=23280227|pmc=4855514}} < /ref >  Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick.   
 51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/770362|title=The Obese Without Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Clustering and the Normal Weight With Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Clustering: Prevalence and Correlates of 2 Phenotypes Among the US Population (NHANES 1999-2004)|first1=MaryFran R.|last1=Sowers|first2=Judith|last2=Wylie-Rosett|first3=Swapnil|last3=Rajpathak|first4=Aileen P.|last4=McGinn|first5=Kristi|last5=Reynolds|first6=Paul|last6=Muntner|first7=Rachel P.|last7=Wildman|date=11 August 2008|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=168|issue=15|pages=1617–1624|via=jamanetwork.com|doi=10.1001/archinte.168.15.1617|pmid=18695075}} < /ref > 
 
 Doctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called '[[dieting]]'. They may exercise too. 
 Dieting is often ineffective. 41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Medicare’s Search for Effective Obesity Treatments|url=http://janetto.bol.ucla.edu/index_files/Mannetal2007AP.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224045505/http://janetto.bol.ucla.edu/index_files/Mannetal2007AP.pdf|archive-date=2012-12-24|access-date=2013-09-16}} < /ref > 
 
 Some people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2021-10-26|title=5 Types of Tea That May Help With Weight Loss|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/types-of-tea-that-may-help-with-weight-loss/|access-date=2023-07-26|website=EverydayHealth.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Animals can also be overweight. 
 
 Overweight is not just associated with bad health. People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad. Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this. This is called [[fatphobia]]. 
 
 More than 2 billion adults are overweight in the world. The amount of overweight people is increasing. < ref > {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8|issn=0140-6736| title = Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013| journal = [[The Lancet]]| date= 29 May 2014| last1 = Ng| first1 = M.| last2 = Fleming | first2 = T.| last3 = Robinson | first3 = M.| last4 = Thomson | first4 = B. | last5 = Graetz | first5 = N. | last6 = Margono | first6 = C.| last7 = Mullany | first7 = E.
