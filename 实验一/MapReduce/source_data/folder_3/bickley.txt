'''Bickley''' is a residential area and [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] in the [[London Borough of Bromley]], [[England]]. It is a suburban development situated 10.4 miles (16.7 km) south-east of [[Charing Cross]]. 
 
 Bickley is a very popular residential area, known for its large and expensive houses. It lies between [[Bromley]] to the west, [[Chislehurst]] to the north-east and [[Petts Wood]] to the south-east. It is unusual that for a well-known place with its own railway station, its only shops are a handy local parade at the junction of The Fairway and Southborough Lane. Bickley station earned the dubious honour of being proclaimed the most vandalised station in England; incidents skyrocketed from three in 2001 to 87 in 2006, a rise of 2800%, according to the Daily Mail. < ref > Ray Massey: '''Commuters shunning stations in fear of thugs and vandals'' < /ref >
