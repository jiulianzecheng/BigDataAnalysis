 ==Aspects of health== 
 
 ===Physical health=== 
 Physical fitness refers to good [[human body|body]] health. It is dependent on [[genetic]] determinators and also on social, [[economic]] and ecological factors. That means, one's genes are partly responsible for one's physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and [[medical]] system is. It is also the result of regular [[exercise]], proper [[diet]] and [[nutrition]], and proper rest for physical [[wikt:recovery|recovery]]. A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their [[Body Mass Index]]. A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health. < ref > Centers For Disease Control and Prevention  https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html < /ref >  Better health is central to human happiness and well-being. It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for its people. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=Ed|last2=Chan|first2=Micaela Y.|date=2011-01-27|title=Happy People Live Longer: Subjective Well-Being Contributes to Health and Longevity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2010.01045.x|journal=Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–43|doi=10.1111/j.1758-0854.2010.01045.x|s2cid=13490264|issn=1758-0846}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Mental health=== 
 Mental health refers to a person's [[emotion]]al and [[psychology|psychological]] well-being.  " A state of emotional and [[psychological]] well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, [[wikt:function|function]] in [[society]], and meet the [[wikt:ordinary|ordinary]] demands of everyday life. " 
 
 One way to think about [[mental]] health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling [[wikt:capable|capable]] and [[wikt:efficient|efficient]]; being able to handle normal levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], have good friends and family, and lead an [[wikt:independent|independent]] life; and being able to  " bounce back, "  or [[wikt:recover|recover]] from hardships, are all signs of mental health. It’s normal for all of us to feel worried, sad, upset, or have difficult emotions from time to time. For most people though, these feelings are only temporary and are resolved without causing any long-term problems. However, for some people, these negative feelings can become worse over time and lead to a mental health problem such as depression, anxiety, stress or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). < ref > {{Cite journal|last=O’Neill|first=Desmond|date=April 2018|title=1686c A systematic review of evidence for fitness to drive among people with mental health conditions of schizophrenia, stress/anxiety disorder, depression, personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2018-icohabstracts.49|journal=Accident Prevention|publisher=BMJ Publishing Group Ltd|doi=10.1136/oemed-2018-icohabstracts.49}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Public health=== 
 {{Main|Public health}} 
 [[Public health]] refers to trying to stop a [[disease]] that is unhealthy to the [[community]], and does not help in living a long life or promote your health. This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of [[society]], [[public]] and private clubs, communities and individuals. 
 
 It is about the health of many people, or everybody, rather than one person. Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases. To prevent being sick, it is good to act according to some simple advice:  [[Hand washing]], regular check-ups,  [[vaccination]] programmes, drinking clean water, and using [[condom]]s. When [[infectious disease]]s break out, washing hands for about 30 seconds may be especially important. Sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease. Teaching people how to live healthily and educate them, especially about sex and childbirth, is also very important.
