The term '''Krishnavanshi''' refers to a person belonging to [[Yadav]] ([[Ahir]]) caste of India. The Krishnavanshi means belonging to the [[Krishna]] line of descent. All [[Ahir|Ahirs]] ([[Yadav|Yadavs]]) equally descend from [[Krishna]] and hence are all Krishnavanshi (or [[Yaduvanshi caste|Yaduvanshi]]). The Krishnavanshi social category is at times interchangeable with the [[Yaduvanshi caste|Yaduvanshi]] title (both define a ‘[[Yadav]]’ of higher pedigree and pure descent). < ref name= " research thesis " > {{cite book|last1=Lucia|first1=Michelutti|title=Sons of Krishna: the politics of Yadav|date=2002|publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science,University of London|page=96|url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2106/1/U613338.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2016}} < /ref >
