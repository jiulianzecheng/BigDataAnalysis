 == History == 
 Birman cats are said to have originated in Burma, and there was treated like a sacred cat. A story was made,  “Originally, the guardians of the Temple of LaoTsun were yellow-eyed white cats with long hair. The golden [[goddess]] of the temple, Tsun-Kyan-Kse, had deep blue eyes. The head priest, Mun-Ha, had as his companion a beautiful cat named Sinh. One day the temple was attacked and Mun-Ha was killed. At the moment of his death, Sinh placed his feet on his master. The cat’s white fur took on a golden cast; his eyes turned as blue as the eyes of the goddess, and his face, legs and tail became the color of earth. However, his paws, where they touched the [[priest]], remained white as a symbol of purity. All the other temple cats became similarly colored. Seven days later, Sinh died, taking the soul of Mun-Ha to paradise.”
