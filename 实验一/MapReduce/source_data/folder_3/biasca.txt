 '''Biasca''' is the capital of the [[district]] [[Riviera (district)|Riviera]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Ticino]] in [[Switzerland]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The [[municipality]] lies at the entrance to the Blenio valley, 19 & nbsp;km north of [[Bellinzona]], on the banks of the [[Brenno]]. About 3 & nbsp;km east of Biasca is the small lake of Carigiolo.  The villages of Loderio, Ponte, Pontirone, Sant'Anna, and Valle are a part of Biasca. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] coins has been found in Biasca, which means that it had people living in it in old times. 
 
 The church of Biasca has [[sculpture]]s and [[painting]]s from the 1400s and 1500s. It was built in 1213. A second Catholic church, the Rotonda di San Carlo, is a nice example of the modern building of the [[Milan]]ese builder Macciacchini. 
 
 An [[avalanche]] from the Monte Crenone (now called Pizzo Magno) in 1512 buried many houses in Biasca and killed hundreds of people. This was one of the big avalanches in the [[Alps]] in modern times. It dammed the Brenno, forming a 14 [[kilometer]] long [[lake]]. This dam broke in the spring of 1514, flooding the Ticino valley to the Magadino plain.
