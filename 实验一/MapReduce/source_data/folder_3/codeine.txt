[[File:Codein - Codeine.svg|thumb|the chemical structure of Codeine]]'''Codeine''' or '''methylmorphine''' is an [[opiate]] used for its [[analgesic]] properties. It is also used to treat [[cough]]ing and [[diarrhea]]. It is marketed as the salts '''codeine sulfate''' and '''codeine phosphate'''. '''Codeine hydrochloride''' is more commonly marketed in continental Europe and other regions. 
 
 Codeine is an [[alkaloid]] found in [[opium]] in concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 [[percent]]. Codeine can be extracted from opium. Today, most codeine is synthesized from [[morphine]] through the process of O-[[methylation]]. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Codeine is used to treat the following: 
 *[[Cough]], though its efficacy in low dose [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] formulations has been disputed. < ref name= " Cochrane2004-Schroeder " > {{cite journal | author=Schroeder K, Fahey T | title=Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings. | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | pages=CD001831 | date=2001 | issue=4 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001831 | pmid=15495019 }} < /ref > 
 *[[Diarrhea]] 
 *Moderate to severe [[pain]] 
 *[[Irritable bowel syndrome]] 
 
 === Compound analgesics === 
 Codeine is often marketed as drugs in combination with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) as [[co-codamol]] (best known in North America as [[Tylenol 3]]). Research has shown the combination to be very much more effective than paracetamol, and much less addictive that pure codeine.  
 
 There are similar combinations with [[aspirin]] as [[co-codaprin]] or with [[ibuprofen]]. These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone. [[Drug synergy]] is an important principle.
