 A '''lullaby''' is a song which is sung to help a [[baby]] or small [[child]] go to sleep. [[Composer]]s of [[classical music]] often wrote pieces for instruments to play (very often for [[piano]] solo) which they called  " lullaby " . They also used the [[French language|French]] word ''Berceuse''. Brahms wrote his famous ''Wiegenlied'' originally for a young singer, Bertha Faber, when she gave birth to her second son. 
 
 Lullabies always have a gentle, rocking rhythm with a simple [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniment]]. [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s ''Berceuse'' is a lullaby for piano. [[Gabriel Fauré]] wrote one at the beginning of his ''Dolly Suite'' for [[piano duet]]. There are many other examples.  
 
 Mothers sing lullabies to their children at bedtime. ''Rock-a-bye Baby'' and ''Hush Little Baby'' are two very well-known lullabies. 
 
 There is an example of lullaby: 
 
 ''Rock-a-bye baby'' 
 
 ''On the tree tops,''[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Lullaby (1875).jpg|thumb|Lullaby by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|William Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]''When the wind blows''
