 '''Antibodies''' (also called '''immunoglobulins''') are large Y-shaped [[proteins]] that can stick to the surface of [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]]. They are found in the [[blood]] or other body fluids of [[vertebrate]]s. Antibodies are the key element in the [[adaptive immune system]]. 
 
 The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an [[antigen]]. < ref name= " Janeway5 " > {{cite book | author = Janeway C.A.

 Each antibody is different. They are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen (in practice, this means [[virus]] or bacteria). For instance, an antibody designed to destroy [[smallpox]] is unable to hit the [[bubonic plague]] or the common cold. 
 
 Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable. This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. < ref name=Janeway5/ >  This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. < ref name=Rhoades > {{cite book | author =  Rhoades RA, Pflanzer RG | title = Human Physiology| edition = 4th | publisher = Thomson Learning | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-534-42174-8}} < /ref > 
 
 == Relationship Between White Blood Cells and Antibodies == 
 There are two types of white blood cells: [[Phagocyte|Phagocytes]] and [[Lymphocyte|Lymphocytes]]. 
 
 Phagocytes are a type of white blood cell. Once the antibodies attach to the pathogen the phagocytes bind to and engulf the pathogens. Once the pathogen is surrounded, the phagocyte then breaks down the cell using [[Enzyme|enzymes]] in its body. Phagocytes rely on antibodies to flag down pathogens in the blood system.  
 
 The other type of white blood cell is called a Lymphocyte. These white blood cells are the ones that are in charge of producing antibodies. The Lymphocytes can detect what pathogen is in your body at that given moment and the Lymphocyte will produce a specific type of antibody to specifically attack that pathogen. These antibodies help group pathogens together into one mass so that the phagocytes can just engulf them whole, rather than going around and individually finding pathogens. They produce antibodies that are specific to the pathogen. It takes a while for lymphocytes to produce these specific antibodies. In addition, some lymphocytes produce toxins that counteract the effect of pathogenic [[Exotoxin|exotoxins]] in the body. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The immune system of the human body in defence against disease - Communicable diseases - AQA - GCSE Biology (Single Science) Revision - AQA|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxr7ng8/revision/9|access-date=2023-05-11|website=BBC Bitesize|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 == Immunoglobulin diversity == 
 === Basic issue === 
 Although a huge variety of different antibodies is made in a single individual, ''the number of [[gene]]s available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the [[genome]]''. 
 
 There are a vast number of [[microbe]] strains, and so [[vertebrate]]s need millions of different antibodies. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Mian I|last2=Bradwell A|last3=Olson A|year=1991|title=Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites|journal=J Mol Biol|volume=217|issue=1|pages=133–51|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F|pmid=1988675}} < /ref >   Actually, humans generate about 10 & nbsp;[[billion]] different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct antigen site. < ref name= " pmid8612345 " > {{cite journal|author=Fanning LJ|last2=Connor AM|last3=Wu GE|year=1996|title=Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire|journal=Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol.|volume=79|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1006/clin.1996.0044|pmid=8612345}} < /ref >  This must be done with a very much smaller number of [[gene]]s: the total human [[genome]] has only about 20,000 genes. 
 
 Several complex [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms have [[Evolution|evolved]]. These allow vertebrate [[B cell]]s to generate a huge pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes. < ref name = namazee > {{cite journal |author=Nemazee D |title=Receptor editing in [[lymphocyte]] development and central tolerance |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=728–40 |year=2006 |pmid=16998507 |doi=10.1038/nri1939|s2cid=2234228 }} < /ref >  The full details are not presented here, just a summary. 
 
 The variety of antibodies is got by combining segments from a pool of [[gene]]s in many different ways. Then, [[wikt:hyper|hyper]]-[[mutation]]s occur in the binding site area of the antibody gene. This creates further diversity. < ref name= " Market " > {{cite journal | author = Market E  &  Papavasiliou FN | title = V(D)J recombination and the evolution of the adaptive immune system | journal = PLOS Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = E16 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14551913 | pmc = 212695 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000016 | url = | issn = }} < /ref > < ref name= " diaz " > {{cite journal |author=Diaz M  &  Casali P |title=Somatic immunoglobulin hypermutation |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=235–240 |year=2002 |pmid=11869898 |doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(02)00327-8|pmc=4621002 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Heavy chains === 
 Antibodies are [[glycoprotein]]s belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the terms ''antibody'' and ''immunoglobulin'' are often used interchangeably. < ref name= " Rhoades "  / >  Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large ''heavy chains'' and two small ''light chains''. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different ''isotypes'' based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals. They  help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. < ref name= " Market "  / > 
 
 === Variable tips === 
 Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar,  a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the ''hypervariable region''. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. < ref name= " Janeway5 "  / >  This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. < ref name= " Rhoades "  / >  The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of [[gene]] segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or ''paratopes''), followed by random [[mutation]]s in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. < ref name=Market/ > < ref name= " diaz "  / >  Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]], which allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system. 
 
 === Examples of Antibodies === 
 
 ==== Antistreptolysin O: The Streptolysin Antibody ==== 
 The specific antibody that is produced to fight Group A [[streptococcus]] is called Antistreptolysin-O, also known as ASO. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Antistreptolysin O and Anti-Deoxyribonuclease B Titers|url=https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/101/1/86/52329/Antistreptolysin-O-and-Anti-Deoxyribonuclease-B|access-date=2023-05-11|website=publications.aap.org}} < /ref > 
 
 Detection of ASO via antistreptolysin-O titer or anti-deoxyribonuclease B (anti-DNase B) is a common way of testing for a group A streptococcal infection. These tests indicate if streptolysin antibodies are present. These proteins are only synthesized by lymphocytes in the event that streptolysin enters the immune system, thus this is a useful way of determining if a patient has the infection. 
 
 == Medical Applications of Antibodies == 
 Understanding the function and mechanism of antibodies is a powerful tool for disease treatment. Though most antibodies used in current clinical research are developed from mouse monoclonal antibodies, this method is allowing the scientific community to make great progress. Such developments include creating antibodies with highly conserved targets and the synthesis of new structures based on the antibodies themselves. There have also been advancements in increasing the binding affinity of antibodies to their associated antigens, a crucial quality to the effectiveness of the antibodies themselves. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Loo|first=LiNa|last2=Robinson|first2=Matthew K.|last3=Adams|first3=Gregory P.|date=2008|title=Antibody engineering principles and applications|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18536554/|journal=Cancer Journal (Sudbury, Mass.)|volume=14|issue=3|pages=149–153|doi=10.1097/PPO.0b013e318173a5d5|issn=1528-9117|pmid=18536554}} < /ref > 
 
 Antibodies are constantly being developed in order to protect the immune system from harmful pathogens. For example, a team of researchers is working on creating a monoclonal antibody that combats Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). The antibody specifically targets the HTLV-1 envelope protein gp46 glycoprotein as a means of destroying HTLV-1-infected cells. The results of the study demonstrate that antibodies can be developed as a therapeutic tool against pathogen-infected cells, thereby serving as a means of treating diseases caused by said pathogens. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Hatayama|first=Yasuyoshi|last2=Yamaoka|first2=Yutaro|last3=Morita|first3=Takeshi|last4=Jeremiah|first4=Sundararaj Stanleyraj|last5=Miyakawa|first5=Kei|last6=Nishi|first6=Mayuko|last7=Kimura|first7=Yayoi|last8=Mitsunaga|first8=Makoto|last9=Iwase|first9=Tadayuki|last10=Kimura|first10=Hirokazu|last11=Yamamoto|first11=Naoki|date=2022-09-29|title=Development of a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting HTLV-1 Envelope gp46 Glycoprotein and Its Application to Near-Infrared Photoimmuno-Antimicrobial Strategy|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36298708/|journal=Viruses|volume=14|issue=10|pages=2153|doi=10.3390/v14102153|issn=1999-4915|pmc=9608601|pmid=36298708}} < /ref >
