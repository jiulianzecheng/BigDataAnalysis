 The '''Celts''' were a large group of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] [[tribe]]s in [[Europe]]. They first appeared in the [[early Iron Age]], around 1200 B.C. in [[Austria]].  The name 'Celt' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greeks]].  The Romans called them  " [[Gaul]] < nowiki/ > s " .  They came from the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La TÃ¨ne culture]]s. Their culture and genes spread through much of Europe, and by the time the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and later the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started emerging, the [[British Isles]] and parts of [[western Europe|western]], [[southern Europe|southern]] and [[eastern Europe]] were Celtic - the most prominent Celtic tribes were in [[Gaul]]. The Celts spoke [[Celtic language]]s. Today, the [[Celtic language]]s that remain are the [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic languages]]. 
 
 Celtic society and technology, although not as advanced as the Romans, was far from being primitive for its time. The Celts lived a way of life based on ethical codes and honor codes and had developed a culture of their own, full of unique drawings, sculptures, jewellery, [[folklore]], and building designs and techniques. They were also skilled in [[blacksmith]]ing, farming and diplomacy. 
 
 Celtic warriors would wear [[war paint]] and try to scare their enemies by shouting war cries.  Tribes had different dress standards for battle; some warriors wore [[chainmail]] and/or leather armor, some wore only clothes and some were known to fight fully naked.  They also had their own type of sword that was very strong and a shield that was very protective.  
 
 When the [[Roman Republic]] started expanding, the Gauls and the Romans became very hostile towards each other and clashed on many occasions; however, the Romans were eventually able to defeat them and ended up conquering most of the Celtic tribes in Europe and ruled them until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].  Celtic tribes also fought among each other.  After winning a battle, the Celts would [[Decapitation|cut off the head]]s of their enemies and take them home. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z9j4kqt|newspaper=BBC Bitesize|access-date=2019-01-09|title=How the Romans conquered Britain}} < /ref > 
 
 During the fall of the Roman Empire most of the old Celtic land ended up being ruled by migrating [[Germanic tribes]] and they merged with Romano-Celtic stock (people with both Roman and Celtic ancestry) to eventually form several European nations of today e.g. [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]] as well as Southern and Western [[Germany]]. Territories that are still considered Celtic are [[Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]].
