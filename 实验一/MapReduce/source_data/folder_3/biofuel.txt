 '''Biofuel''' is [[fuel]] from recently lifeless or living biological material. It is different to [[fossil fuels]] from long dead biological material. Biofuel can be in forms of [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]].  
 
 Biofuels are usually used to power [[cars]], heat homes and for cooking. Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe, Asia and the Americas.  Technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows [[pollution]] to be converted into renewable biofuel. Agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from [[Monoculture|specific plants]], rather than from [[waste]] processes such as [[landfill]] or recycled material.  
 
 There are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels.  One is to grow [[crops]] that are high in sugar (e.g. [[Sugar cane]]) or starch (e.g. [[corn]]), and then use [[yeast]] to [[ferment]] ethyl alcohol ([[ethanol]]).  The second is to grow [[plants]] that contain high amounts of [[vegetable oil]], such as [[palm oil]], [[soybean]] and [[algae]].  When these oils are heated, their [[viscosity]] is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine, or chemically processed to produce fuels such as [[biodiesel]]. For thousands of years, [[Wood]] and its by-products have been converted into biofuels such as [[charcoal]], wood gas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be expensive. 
 
 Solid [[biomass]] is also used. [[Firewood]] has been used for thousands of years.  Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt, and this can be used to produce power.  < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Future is Green: The Rise of Biofuel Energy|url=https://whatsbiomass.com/future-is-green-biofuel-energy/|access-date=2023-02-16|archive-date=2023-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230320124239/https://whatsbiomass.com/future-is-green-biofuel-energy/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >
