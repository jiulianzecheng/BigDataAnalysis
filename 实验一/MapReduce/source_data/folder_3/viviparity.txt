'''Vivparous''' animals have internal [[fertilisation]] and the eggs develop inside the mother. The key idea is that the growing embryo gets its nutrition from a [[placenta]] in the mother's [[womb]]. It is the standard method for all [[mammal]]s except [[monotreme]]s.  
 
 == Ovoviviparity == 
 Those reptiles which do not lay eggs mostly keep soft-shelled eggs inside their bodies. The embryo exists on the material in the egg. They are '''ovoviviparus''', because of the source of nutrition. However, there are some [[amphibian]]s and a few reptiles which are genuinely viviparous because they get their nutrition direct from the mother. 
 
 == In plants == 
 [[Image:Poa alpina a2.jpg|thumb|''[[Poa alpina]]'', a [[grass]] which shows vivipary: the seeds [[germinate]] while still attached to the mother plant.]] 
 '''Viviparous plants''' produce [[seeds]] that [[germination|germinate]] before they detach from the parent. In many [[mangrove]]s, for instance, the seedling germinates and grows under its own energy while still attached to its parent. Then it drops into the water to transport away.  
 
 In some trees, like [[jackfruit]], the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe. This condition is not vivipary because the moist and humid conditions just mimics a wet soil. However, the seeds can germinate under [[soil]] too. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/worldvegetation/marinewetlands/mangal/a1366tx.html |title=UCLA: The Mildred E.
