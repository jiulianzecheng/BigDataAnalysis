 == Origin == 
 According to the [[Leithak Leikharol]] [[PuYa]], God Marjing (mentioned as '' " Maraching " '') originated from the [[intestine]]s of [[Atingkok|Atiya Sidaba]]. He was created to control [[Samadon Ayangba]], the divine horse ({{lang-omp|Sakon}}). The horse was created from the foot of [[Sanamahi|Ashiba (Sanamahi)]]. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.461915/page/n57/mode/2up?q=Marjing+Leithak+Leikhalon+intestines+Atiya+Sidaba+horse+Ashiba+human+souls+Sagol+Kangjei+Parratt+Meitei+mythology|title=A Critical Study Of The Religious Philosophy|website=archive.org|date=August 1991|page=57}} < /ref >

 == Mythology == 
 [[Sagol Kangjei]] ({{lang-en|Polo}}) is originally the game of gods. There are 7 players on each side. They used ''Kangdrum'' (a ball made from bamboo root). This is what the human beings imitate from them. The first divine polo match was played during the festival of [[Lai Haraoba]]. < ref name= " ReferenceC " / > 
 
 == Worship == 
 During the [[Lai Haraoba]] festival, a [[maibi]] (priestess) performs a ritual in the form of a mime. She holds a mallet in her hand and enacts the game of polo. < ref name= " Bhattacharjee " / > 
 
 Every year, in the top of the Heingang Hills, devotees offer polostick ({{lang-omp|ꯀꯥꯡꯆꯩ|kangchei}}, {{lang-mni|ꯀꯥꯡꯖꯩ|kangjei}}) and bamboo-root-ball ({{lang-mni|ꯀꯥꯡꯗ꯭ꯔꯨꯝ|kangdrum}}) to God Marjing. < ref name= " ReferenceC " / >  This is done even when any animal in one's house become sick. < ref name= " archive.org " / > 
 
 In 1618 AD, during the reign of King [[Khagemba]], a public worship took place at his abode and also at every watery place on the river side. [[Wild boar]]s, [[duck]]s, [[cock]]s, [[hen]], [[pigeon]]s and other creatures were offered to God Marjing. This was recorded in the [[Cheitharol Kumbaba]]. < ref name= " ReferenceC " / > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.108375/page/31/mode/2up?q=Marjing|title=Religion Of Manipur|website=archive.org|year=1980|pages=31|publisher=Firma Klm}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.108375/page/121/mode/2up?q=Marjing|title=Religion Of Manipur|website=archive.org|year=1980|pages=121|publisher=Firma Klm}} < /ref >
