The '''Brights''' is a group that was started by [[Paul Geisert]] and [[Mynga Futrell]] to make a name that sounds good for people who have views on life based on [[nature]] (naturalistic worldviews). They did not like that names like  " [[atheist]] "  and  " non-believer "  sounded bad to some people and they wanted a word that sounded better to these people. 
 
 Paul Geisert chose the word  " bright. "  Mynga Futrell says a bright is a person who has views on life that are free of more-than-natural (supernatural) ideas. She says these persons' morals come from their views on life.

 == Criticism == 
 
 Some people, both religious and non-religious, do not like the Brights using the word  " bright "  in this way. They believe it suggests that people with views on life based on nature are smarter than those with other views on life. However, this is not why the name was chosen; it tries to show that people with views based on nature are  " looking on the ''bright'' side "  of life.
