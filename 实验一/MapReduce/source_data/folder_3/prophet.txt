 '''Prophets''' are people who said that [[God]] or [[Deity|gods]] talked to them. They freely teach other people what they learned. Most of them warn people that something very good will happen if they live good lives. Or if they sin, God will punish them. Sometimes people who are not religious are also called prophets if they correctly predict the future. Persons who think bad things  will happen are sometimes made fun of as being  " prophets of doom " . A person who says things will happen, but they don't happen are called  " false prophets " .  
 
 There are prophets in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Sanamahism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and in other religions.  
 
 For the main [[Abrahamic religion]]s, there are two kinds of prophets, major and minor. Major prophets gave a lot of teachings while minor prophets do not have many teachings. The most important prophet in [[Judaism]] is [[Moses]].  [[Isaiah]] and [[Elijah]] are also important. [[Elijah]] didn't write any books in the [[Bible]] but did many miracles and told kings that God would punish them.  
 
 In [[Christianity]] [[Jesus]] was the main prophet. Other Christian prophets are mentioned in the [[New Testament]], both men and women. [[John the Apostle|John]], a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of Jesus wrote the [[Book of Revelation]] which has many [[prophecy|prophecies]].   
 
 In Islam, [[Muhammed]] is considered the greatest and last prophet.  Muslims also consider Moses and Jesus to be prophets and many others who lived before the time of Muhammed. Some modern religions say that their founder is a prophet, such as [[Joseph Smith]]. The famous preacher [[Billy Graham]] is sometimes called a prophet.  < ref >   https://www.amazon.com/Prophet-Honor-Billy-Graham-Updated/dp/0310353300  < /ref >
