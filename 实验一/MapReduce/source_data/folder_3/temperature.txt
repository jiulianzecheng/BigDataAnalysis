 '''Temperature''' is how hot or cold something is. Our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold. To [[measurement|measure]] temperature more [[accurate]]ly, a [[thermometer]] can be used. Thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is. The scale used in most of the world is in degrees [[Celsius]], sometimes called  " centigrade " . In the [[United States|USA]] and some other countries degrees [[Fahrenheit]]  are more often used while [[scientist]]s mostly use [[kelvins]]  to measure temperature because it never goes below zero. 
 
 [[science|Scientifically]], temperature is a physical quantity which describes how quickly [[molecule]]s are moving inside a material. In [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s the molecules are vibrating around a fixed point in the substance, but in [[gas]]es they are in free flight and bouncing off each other as they travel. In a gas the temperature, [[pressure]] and [[volume]] of the gas are closely related by a law of physics. 
 
 ==Important Heat Index's== 
 When they invented temperature scales scientists found there were certain things which were always around the same temperature: 
 
 *Water freezes at a temperature of 0 °C, 32 °F, or 273.15 K. 
 *The temperature inside the human body is close to 37 °C or 98 °F. 
 *Water boils at 100 °C, 212 °F, or 373.15 K. 
 *Things begin to glow Red hot at approximately 550 °C, 1,000 °F, or 800 K. 
 *Things begin to glow White hot at about 1,300 °C, 2,400 °F, or 1,600 K. 
 *The coldest possible temperature is [[absolute zero]]. Absolute zero is 0 K,-459 °F, or -273.15 °C. At absolute zero, molecules and atoms come to rest and so have no heat energy. 
 *The highest possible temperature is the [[:en:Planck_units#Planck_temperature|Planck Temperature]]. When things get hot, they glow. First red hot, which has a long wavelength, and eventually blue, which has a short wavelength. The hotter they are, the shorter the wavelength of light is that they glow at. At the planck temperature, this wavelength is [[:en:Planck_units#Planck_length|as short as possible]]. It should be noted that more energy could be added to the system from here, however we don't know what would happen. The planck temperature is extremely high, at 141,678,400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 K or °C, or 255,021,120,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 °F. 
 
 ==Temperature  and heat== 
 Temperature is not the same as [[heat]]. Heat is [[energy]] which moves from one thing, cooling it, to another, heating it. Temperature is a measure of the movements ([[vibration]]) of the [[molecules]] inside a thing. If the thing has a high temperature, it means the [[average]] speed of its molecules is fast. A thing may have a high temperature but because it contains very few or light atoms it has very little heat. 
 
 ==Heat capacity== 
 The amount of heat that is needed to make a substance one degree higher is called its heat [[capacity]]. Different substances have different heat capacities. For example, a kilogram of water has more heat capacity than a kilogram of [[steel]]. This means that more energy is needed to make the temperature of water 1°C hotter than is needed to make the temperature of steel 1°C hotter. 
 
 ==Weather== 
 Temperature is also important in [[weather]] and [[climate]]. It is related to the amount of [[heat energy]] in the [[air]]. [[Isotherm]] maps are used to show how temperature is different across an area. Temperature will be different during different times of day, different [[season]]s and in different places. It is affected by how much heat reaches the place from the suns rays ([[insolation]]), how [[altitude|high]] the place is above the [[sea level|level of the sea]], and how much heat is brought to the place by the movement of [[wind]]s and [[ocean current]]s.
