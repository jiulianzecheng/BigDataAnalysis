 An '''arch''' is an opening in a [[building]] that is curved on top to distribute the weight. The curved part can be round, like part of a [[circle]], or pointed, like two parts of circles next to each other. Arches are often used where buildings are made of many small [[stone]]s or [[brick]]s. The stone at the very top of the arch, called the keystone, keeps the rest of the arch stones from falling down. Arches can go over [[door]]ways and [[window]]s. Many [[bridge]]s are [[arch bridge|arch bridges]] including ones made of [[steel]]. A series of arches is an [[arcade]].  
 
 Arches can be found in [[nature]]. These [[Natural arch|natural arches]] form through the [[erosion]] of [[Cliff|cliffs]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLJKe1rBb7YC & dq=natural+arches+formed+through+erosion & pg=PA11

 == Types of arches == 
 Arches  can have many forms, but they can be sorted into three categories: circular, pointed and parabolic. 
 
 * Circular (rounded) arches were used by Romans. They used them in [[Bridge|bridges]], [[Aqueduct|aqueducts]], and large-scale (big) architecture. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/arch-architecture

 * Pointed arches were most often used by builders of Gothic-style architecture. They used them because they produced less [[thrust]] at the base. This allowed the structures to be taller. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://mymodernmet.com/gothic-architecture-characteristics/2/|title=What We Can Learn From the Exquisite History and Ornate Aesthetic of Gothic Architecture|date=2017-11-14|website=My Modern Met|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08|archive-date=2019-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417125238/https://mymodernmet.com/gothic-architecture-characteristics/2/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 * Parabolic arches have the shape of a [[parabola]]. They are mostly used in bridges.
