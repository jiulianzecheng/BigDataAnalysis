 '''Typhoid''', or '''typhoid fever''', is an [[illness]] caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'' subspecies ''enterica''. < ref > Newton A.E. 2014. Three infectious diseases related to travel. CDC health information for international travel 2014: the yellow book. ISBN 9780199948499 < /ref >  Symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and usually begin 6 to 30 days after exposure. The disease is spread by water which has the bacteria in it.  
 
 == Transmission == 
 Typhi is spread through from what is called the ''fecal{{ndash}}oral route''. The source is people who are infected but have no [[symptoms]]. < ref name=Eng2015 > {{cite journal| vauthors = Eng SK, Pusparajah P, Ab Mutalib NS, Ser HL, Chan KG, Lee LH |title=Salmonella:A review on pathogenesis, epidemiology and antibiotic resistance|journal=Frontiers in Life Science|date= June 2015|volume=8|issue=3|pages=284–293|doi=10.1080/21553769.2015.1051243|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  An asymptomatic human carrier is an individual who is still excreting typhoid bacteria in their stool a year after the acute stage of the infection. < ref name=Eng2015 / > 
 
 == The disease == 
 Typhoid usually lasts between two weeks and a month. The symptoms of typhoid often appear 10 to 14 days after infection. If no treatment is given, between one and three out of every ten patients die. The rest usually get better after a month, at the most. 
 
 Typhoid causes a steady [[fever]] of at least 103–104 degrees F (39–40 degrees C). Also, it can cause stomach pains, [[headache]], being [[delirium|delirious]] (restless, excited, seeing things), and not being hungry. In some cases, flat, pink coloured spots show up on the patient's body. Sometimes there are no symptoms.  
 
 Typhoid is not common in countries with good [[sanitation]] and clean water. For example, scientists think that there are only 400 cases a year in the [[United States]]. In 2015,  12.5 million new cases worldwide were reported. < ref name=GBD2015Pre > {{cite journal | vauthors = Vos T, Allen C, Arora M, Barber RM, Bhutta ZA, Brown A, etal | collaboration = GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators | title = Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10053 | pages = 1545–1602 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27733282 | pmc = 5055577 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6 }} < /ref >  For example, in the [[India]]n subcontinent, typhoid is one of the most common diseases because of poor sanitation and lack of basic [[hygiene]].In that case, typhoid fever is common in children of the one to 15 years age group. 
 
 The disease can be treated with [[antibiotics]]. There are standard drugs like ''chloromycetin'' which cure typhoid.
