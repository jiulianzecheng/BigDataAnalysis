'''Jahbulon''' (or '''Jabulon''') is a word, or a confection of three syllables, that was used in the past in some [[ritual]]s of certain parts of [[Freemasonry|Masonry]].  It is also said to be used in [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] rituals. 
 
 The origin and meaning of this word are not completely known. Different groups think the word means different things. Even Masonic [[researcher]]s do not all agree to what the word means or where it came from. One Masonic scholar says that the word was first used in an early [[18th century]] [[Royal Arch]] ritual. He said it was the name of an [[explorer]] looking for [[King Solomon]]'s [[Temple]]. Another Masonic scholar thinks it is a name for [[God]] in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The most used Masonic explanation is that it is a word that comes from putting together parts of the name of God in different historic [[language]]s.{{fact|date=October 2021}} 
 
 [[Writer]]s who are not Masons, especially those against Masonry, have said that it is a Masonic [[Names of God|name for God]]. Some say it is the name of a unique  " Masonic God " . Freemasonry's officials have said many times that '' " There is no separate Masonic God " ''. They have also said that there is no separate proper name for a [[deity]] in any branch of Freemasonry. < ref name= " a religion?

In [[England]], no ritual with the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989. < ref > Medway, Gareth J.

 After persistent strong criticism in the popular press, the Supreme Grand Chapter of England excised the word from its Royal Arch ritual in 1989, and replaced it with a choice between two forms of the [[tetragrammaton]].
