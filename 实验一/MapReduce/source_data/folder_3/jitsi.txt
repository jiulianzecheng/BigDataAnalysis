 Jitsi introduced the Videobridge in 2013 to support video calling with multiple people using a new [[Selective Forwarding Unit|Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)]] architecture. Later that year initial support was added to the JitsiVideobridge allowing [[WebRTC]] calling from the browser. To demonstrate how JitsiVideobridge could be used as a production service, BlueJimp offered a free use of its hosted system at meet.jit.si. < ref > {{Cite news|title=Atlassian's HipChat gets group video chats|language=en-US|work=TechCrunch|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/atlassians-hipchat-gets-group-video-chats/|access-date=2018-07-20}} < /ref > 
 
 On November 4, 2014,  " Jitsi + Ostel "  scored 6 out of 7 points on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s secure messaging scorecard.

 Atlassian bought BlueJimp on April 5, 2015. After that, the new Jitsi team under Atlassian stopped important new development work on the Jitsi Desktop project and expanded its efforts on projects related to the Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet.

 === Jitsi Meet === 
 [[File:Jitsi-app.png|right|thumb|267x267px|Jitsi Meet Android Application]] 
 Jitsi Meet is an [[open source]] JavaScript WebRTC application and can be used for videoconferencing. One can share presentations and with just a link can invite new members for videoconference. It can be used by downloading the app or directly in a browser and is compatible with any recent browser. < ref > {{Cite web|title=How to Create Your Own Video Conference Server using Jitsi Meet on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS|url=https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-create-your-own-video-conference-using-jitsi-meet-on-ubuntu-1804/|access-date=2018-07-23|website=www.howtoforge.com|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|date=2018-01-28|title=Top Ten VoIP Apps For Consumers {{!}} VoIP Review|language=en-US|work=VoIP Review|url=https://voip.review/2018/01/28/top-ten-voip-apps/|access-date=2018-07-23}} < /ref >  Every user can use Jitsi.org servers or can download and install the server software on a Linux-based machine. 
 
 '''Key features of Jitsi Meet''' 
 
 * Encrypted communication (secure communication): As of April 2020, 1-1 calls use the P2P mode, which is end-to-end encrypted via DTLS-SRTP between the two participants. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|title=Jitsi Meet Security  &  Privacy|url=https://jitsi.org/security/|access-date=2020-04-27|website=Jitsi|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Group calls also use DTLS-SRTP encryption, but deppend on the Jitsi Videobridge (JVB) as video router, where packets are decrypted temporarily. The Jitsi team says that  " they are never stored to any persistent storage and only live in memory while being routed to other participants in the meeting " , and that this measure is necessary due to current limitations of the underlying WebRTC technology. 
 * No need of new [[Client|client software]] installation. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Jitsi Meet {{!}} Me and my Shadow|url=https://myshadow.org/resources/jitsi-meet-chrome-and-chromium?locale=en|access-date=2018-08-06|website=myshadow.org|language=en}} < /ref >
