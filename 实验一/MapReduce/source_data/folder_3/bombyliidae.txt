 The '''Bombyliidae''' are a family of [[fly|flies]]. Their common name is '''bee flies'''. 
 
 The Bombyliidae are a large family of [[fly|flies]]. It has hundreds of [[genus|genera]], but the [[life cycle]]s of most [[species]] are known poorly, or not at all. Some are very small (2 & nbsp;mm in length), but some can be very large for flies (wingspan of some 40 & nbsp;mm). < ref name= " isbn1-86872-713-0 " > {{cite book |author= Weaving, Alan; Picker, Mike  &  Griffiths, Charles Llewellyn |title=Field guide to insects of South Africa |publisher=New Holland |year=2003 |isbn=1-86872-713-0 }} < /ref > < ref name= " HullFM " > Hull, Frank Montgomery 1973.

 Adults normally feed on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]. Those with a spectacularly long [[proboscis]] are [[adapted]] to plants (such as ''[[Lapeirousia]]'') which have long, narrow [[floral]] tubes. 
 
 The Bombyliidae include a large number of species, but for its size this is one of the least understood families of [[insect]]s. There at least 4,500 described species, and certainly thousands still to be described. The adult flies usually feed on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], and some are important [[pollinator]]s. 
 
 == Bee mimics == 
 Many Bombyliidae look like [[bee]]s and so a common name for the family is the '''bee flies'''. < ref name= " HullFM " / >  The reason is probably [[Aposematism|aposematic]]: the adults are safer from [[predator]]s because they share the warning colours of bees. The adult females usually lay eggs near the nests of possible hosts, often in the burrows of [[solitary bee]]s, [[wasp]]s or [[beetle]]s. 
 
 == Larvae == 
 The larval stages are predators or [[parasitoid]]s of the eggs and [[larva]]e of other insects. The eggs hatch into larvae which eat the eggs and larvae of the 'host' insect. Although most bee-flies usually are fairly or highly host-specific, some species do attack a number of hosts.
