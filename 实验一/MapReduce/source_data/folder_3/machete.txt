 A '''machete''' is a long cutting [[tool]]. The blade is usually 20-24 inches (50-60 cm) long and less than .2 inches thick. The machete is a large [[knife]] often used in [[jungle]]s because it can easily cut through plants and vines. It can be used to open [[coconut]]s and cut down small trees (sometimes the back side has edges for sawing wood).  It is also used occasionally outside of jungles.  One such use is in [[surveying]] when a line of sight is needed through brush.  It is a lot like the [[Japan]]ese [[katana]] and larger than the [[United States of America|American]] [[Bowie knife]], and is sometimes used in warfare.
