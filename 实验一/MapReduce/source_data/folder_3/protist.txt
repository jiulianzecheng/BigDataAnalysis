 '''Protists''' are single-celled [[Eukaryote|eukaryotes]] (which are [[organism]]s with a [[nucleus]]). The term '''Protista''' was first used by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1866. < ref > Haeckel, E. Das Protistenreich. Leipzig, 1878. [http://www.biolib.de/haeckel/protistenreich/index.html] < /ref >  The protists are not a natural group, or [[clade]], since they have no common origin. Like [[algae]] or [[invertebrates]], they are often grouped together for convenience. 
 
 The term  " protist "  includes [[microorganisms]] from several distantly related [[phyla]]. Some are [[autotroph]]ic (which means they make their own food by [[photosynthesis]]), and others are [[heterotroph]]ic (which means they eat [[Organic matter|organic]] material). 
   
 Most protists are very small. They are made up of [[unicellular|one]] or a few [[cell]]s at most â€“ they are [[microscopic]] and usually invisible to the [[naked eye]]. Some [[algae]] are protists, if they are single-celled. Many protists are part of the [[plankton]] and are very important for the [[ecosystem]]. The cells found in protists may be extremely complex, and are often little understood. It is now possible to do [[DNA sequencing]], and a number of protists have been analysed. The results show that the Protista is not a [[monophyletic]] group. It is [[paraphyletic]], and not a single [[clade]]. The taxonomy of the Protista is therefore rather confused.  
 
 Some protists cause [[disease]]s. ''[[Plasmodium]] falciparum'' causes [[malaria]]; [[sleeping sickness]] is also caused by a protist. 
 
 An example of a single celled organism in the protist kingdom is the ''[[Paramecium]]'' or  " slipper animalcule. "  The ''Paramecium'' moves using its small, hair-like [[fiber]]s called [[cilia]], and eats using the cilia to sweep the food into its food [[vacuole]]. Other protists can be [[amoeba]]s, which move by extending [[pseudopods]] and flowing into them, or flowing around food particles and engulfing them.

 Protists are not a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]]. The term is a convenient holdall for about 20 different kinds of single-celled [[eukaryote]]s. < ref > Schaechter M. 2012. ''Eukaryotic microbes''. Amsterdam, Academic Press. < /ref >  They differ in their cell [[organelle]]s, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like [[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s. This proves they have made the transition from [[prokaryote]]s in different ways. It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes ([[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'. < ref > Margulis L. and McMenamin 1990. Marriage of convenience. ''The Sciences'' '''30''', 31-36. < /ref > < ref > Margulis L  &  Dolan M.F. 2002. ''Early life: evolution on the Precambrian Earth''. 2nd ed, Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston. p89 < /ref > < ref > Margulis L. Schwartz K.V.  &  Dolan M. 1999. ''Diversity of life: the illustrated guide to the five kingdoms''. Jones  &  Bartlett, Boston, p94. In this work the authors propose 19 phyla for the Protista, and call this 'Kingdom' the 'Protoctista', a term which is unfortunately almost unpronounceable. < /ref > < ref > Dyer B.D. and Obar R.A. 1994. ''Tracing the history of eukaryotic cells''. Columbia N.Y. < /ref >  Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.
