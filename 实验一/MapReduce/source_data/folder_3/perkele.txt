 ==Introduction of Christianity== 
 As Finland was [[Christianization|Christianized]], the old Finnish [[deities]] were said to be demons, so  " Devil "  was translated to  " Perkele "  for the Finnish translation of the Bible. Some later translations use ''paholainen'' (the evil one) instead. < ref > {{cite web|title=Paholainen|url= https://www.jw.org/fi/kirjasto/raamattu/nwt/raamatun-sanasto/#p217}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Uses in popular culture== 
 * Many Finnish bands, such as [[Impaled Nazarene]], [[Norther]] and [[Pepe Deluxe]], use the word ''perkele'' to show Finnishness. A song by a Finnish metal band, [[Amorphis]], titled  " Perkele (The God of Fire) " , is the sixth track on their album ''[[Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse]]''. 
 * There is a Swedish [[Oi!]] band called [[Perkele (band)|Perkele]]. They were formed in 1993 in [[Gothenburg]] and are currently signed to [[Oi! the Boat Records]]. 
 * The webcomic ''[[Scandinavia and the World]]'' depicts Finland as having a bad state of mind, being violent and drunk and mostly saying nothing except he says  " perkele "  when things do not go his way. 
 *In the 2019 video game [[Control (video game)|''Control'']], Ahti, a Finnish janitor who is also hinted to be an enormously powerful supernatural entity, says ''perkele'' when describing the weird events taking place in the Federal Bureau of Control. 
 *The 2016 video game ''[[My Summer Car]]'' has a  " swear button " , allowing the player's character to say a handful of random exclamatory statements. One of them is perkele. Because the game takes place in 1990s Finland, many characters in the game's rural setting also say  " perkele " . Because of this, some of the game's English-speaking fans say perkele on forums talking about the game.
