 The '''Ibāḍī''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: '''Al-Ibādhiyyah''' الاباضية) is a denomination of [[Islam]] that is the dominant form in only one country, [[Oman]]. There are other Ibāḍī in [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/islam/ibadis.html|title=Ibadi Islam: an Introduction|author=Valerie J. Hoffman}} < /ref >  The Ibāḍī probably started one of the earliest schools, which was founded less than 50 years after the death of [[Muhammad]]. < nowiki/ > 
 
 The name comes from [[Abdullah ibn Ibadh at-Tamini]]. Some of the branch's followers, however, claim that its true founder was [[Jabir ibn Zaid al-'Azdi]], who was from [[Nizwa]], Oman. 
 
 == Differences from other types of Islam == 
 Ibāḍī communities are generally seen as conservative. They reject the practice of ''qunūt'' in which one asks Allah for things while one stands in prayer. [[Sunni]] Muslims traditionally consider the Ibāḍī to be an extremist [[Kharijite]] group because they came from that group. However, most Ibāḍī now believe that other Muslims are not ''[[kafir|kuffar]]''  " unbelievers " , unlike most Kharijite groups, but ''kuffar an-nima''  " unbelievers in God's grace. "  Most Ibāḍī now believe a true believer's attitude to others to be expressed in three religious obligations: 
 * ''walāyah'': being friendly and united with practicing true believers and the Ibāḍī [[imam|imans]]. 
 * ''barā'ah'': refusing to deal with unbelievers and sinners and showing a certain hostility towards them and those destined for [[Hell]]. 
 * ''wuqūf'': being reserved towards those whose status is unclear. 
 
 Unlike the Kharijites, the Ibāḍī have abandoned the [[assassination]] of mainstream Muslims. < ref > Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power'', Vintage (1982), p.42 < /ref > 
 
 The Ibāḍī agree with [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] < nowiki/ > s in approving of [[Caliphs]] [[Abu Bakr|Abū Bakr]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], and both groups regarded them as rightly-guided caliphs. However, the Ibāḍī think that [[Uthman ibn Affan]] introduced ''[[bid'ah]]''  " innovations "  to Islam and so approve of the revolt that overthrew him. 
 
 The Ibāḍī also approve of the first part of [[Ali]]'s caliphate. Like the [[Shia Islam|Shi'ites]], the Ibāḍī disapprove of both [[Aisha]]'s rebellion against him and [[Muawiya]]'s revolt. However, the Ibāḍī regard Ali's acceptance of [[arbitration]] at the [[Battle of Siffin]] against Muawiyya's rebels as un-Islamic. The Ibāḍī consider that Al's decision made him unfit as iman, and they condemn Ali also for killing early Kharijites in an-Nahr at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]]. 
 
 The Ibāḍī also have several doctrinal differences from other types of Islam: 
 
 * The Ibāḍī believe that Muslims will not see [[Allah]] on the [[Day of Judgemen]] < nowiki/ > t. That is derived from the [[Qur'an]], which says Ibrahim/Abraham is told upon asking to see Allah,  " You shall not see me. That is contrary to the mainstream Sunni belief that indeed, Muslims will see Allah with their eyes on the day of Judgment in a way and a manner that Allah knows best. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7 & ID=6259 & CATE=24|title=Seeing Allah in dreams, waking, and the afterlife.|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|access-date=2008-02-05|archive-date=2012-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218064320/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=7 & ID=6259 & CATE=24|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  That matches the beliefs of [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]]: Imam Ali (AS)  " Eyes can not see Him, but he can be seen by the realities of FAITH "  [[Nahj al-Balaghah]]. 
 
 * The Ibāḍī believe that whoever enter [[Hell]] will be there forever. That is contrary to the Sunni belief that Muslims who enter Hell will live there for a fixed amount of time to purify them of their shortcomings, and they will then enter [[Paradise]]. Sunnis also believe that unbelievers will remain in Hell forever. 
 
 * The Ibāḍī believe that the [[Qur'an]] is created. The Sunnis hold vigorously that the Qur'an is uncreated, as exemplified by the suffering of [[Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. Many Shi'ites also hold that the Qur'an is created, which is one of many theological beliefs that they share with the [[Mu'tazilah]] of Iraq. 
 
 * The Ibāḍī do not see the Sunni hadiths [[Kutub al-Sittah]] (or the Shia hadiths) as canonical but rely more on individual interpretations. 
 
 The Ibāḍī believe that the fifth legitimate [[caliph]] was [[Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]]. All caliphs from [[Muawiya|Muˤāwiyya]] onwards are regarded as tyrants except [[Umar ibn Abdul Aziz]] on whom opinions differ. However, various later Ibāḍī leaders are recognized as true [[Imam|imāms]], including [[Abdullah ibn Yahya al-Kindi]] of [[South Arabia]] and the imāms of the [[Rustamid]] dynasty in [[North Africa]]. 
 
 The Ibāḍī are also found in [[Jabal Nafusa]] in [[Libya]], [[Mzab]] in [[Algeria]], [[East Africa]] (particularly [[Zanzibar]]), and [[Djerba|Djerba Island]] in [[Tunisia]]. The early medieval [[Rustamid]] dynasty in [[Algeria]] was Ibāḍī, and refugees from its capital, [[Tahert]], founded the North African Ibāḍī communities, which still exist.
