 Toucans are a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae. This bird lives in small flocks in lowland [[rainforest]]s in countries such as [[Costa Rica]]. It flies short distances between trees. Toucans rest in holes in [[tree]]s. They mostly eat fruit, but sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards. 
 
 They are brightly marked and have large, often-colorful bills. The family includes five genera and over forty different species. 
 
 Toucans are resident breeders and do not [[migrate]]. Toucans are usually found in pairs or small flocks. They sometimes fence with their bills and wrestle, which scientists think is to find out who is the top bird amongst them. < ref > Short L.L.  &  Horne J.F.M. 2017. Toucans (Ramphastidae).

 == Beak == 
 Toucans are known for their huge beaks, which can grow larger than their bodies. The beak may also be used to cool the bird off. They use their beaks for reaching over and plucking [[fruit]] from branches of trees. The bright colors (usually orange) on the beak may help the toucans to recognize each other, and to scare off other [[bird]]s. < ref > {{cite book

The beak is loaded in bending and foraging and fencing activities, although it has a low compressive strength. < ref > {{Cite web|title=ScienceDirect.com {{!}} Science, health and medical journals, full text articles and books.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/?ref=pdf_download & fr=RR-11 & rr=760d3c4068ba8284|access-date=2022-10-27|website=www.sciencedirect.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Diet == 
 The diet of toucans consists mainly of fruit, they are frugivorous. Although they sometimes consume small animals such as small birds, insects, and lizards. They also eat eggs from nests, and nestlings. < ref > https://academic.oup.com/condor/article-abstract/95/1/178/5189575?redirectedFrom=fulltext & login=true < /ref >
