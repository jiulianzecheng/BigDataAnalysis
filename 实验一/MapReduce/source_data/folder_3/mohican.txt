 The '''Mahicans''' (also '''Mohicans''') are a [[Native American]] tribe. They are part of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]. They spoke an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language. They originally settled around the [[Hudson River]]. There was conflict with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] during the [[Beaver Wars]]. As a result, many Mahicans moved to [[Massachusetts]] after 1680. They settled with tribes of the [[Lenape]]. Mahicans moved later to New York and joined the [[Oneida]] for several decades. The remaining [[descendant]]s moved to northeastern [[Wisconsin]] during the 1820s and 1830s. < ref name= " EBmohs " > " Mohican "  (history), ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007, webpage:
