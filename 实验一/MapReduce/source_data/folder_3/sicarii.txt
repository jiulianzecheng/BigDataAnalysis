'''Sicarii''' were killers who were a splinter group of the [[Zealot]]s during the time leading up to the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] General Titus. Their name derives from a work that means  " dagger " . They hid in groups of people who supported Roman rule and then pulled their daggers and killed people. Then they ran away and hid. [[Judas Iscariot]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]], was believed by some to be a sicarius. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/307411/Judas-Iscariot|title=Judas Iscariot|work=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|access-date=30 September 2014}} < /ref >
