 An '''icosagon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 20 sides and 20 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. It has interior angles of 162 and exterior angles of 18. 
 
 == Regular icosagon == 
 The ''[[regular polygon|regular]] icosagon'' has Schl√§fli symbol {20}, and can also be constructed as a truncated [[decagon]], t{10}, or a twice-truncated [[pentagon]], tt{5}.  
 
 === Area === 
 The amount of space a regular icosagon takes up is 
 
 : < math > \text{Area} = {5}a^2(1+\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}). < /math > 
 
 ''a'' is the length of one of its sides. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 The Big Wheel on the popular US game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' has an icosagonal cross-section. 
 
 The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989. < ref > Muriel Pritchett, University of Georgia [http://researchmagazine.uga.edu/92f/globe.html  " To Span the Globe " ], see also Editor's Note, retrieved on 10th January 2016 < /ref > 
 
 As a [[golygon]]al path, the [[swastika]] is considered to be an irregular icosagon. < ref > {{MathWorld |title=Icosagon |urlname=Icosagon}} < /ref >

 == Dissection== 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every parallel-sided 2''m''-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the icosagon, ''m''=10, and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a [[Petrie polygon]] projection of a [[10-cube]], with 45 of 11520 faces.  < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref >  The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] enumerates the number of solutions as 18,410,581,880, including up to 20-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.
