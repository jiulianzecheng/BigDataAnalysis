 A sphinx wax or Brazilian wax is a type of hair removal. When sphynxing or doing a Brazilian wax, all the pubic hair is removed. Sphynxing has many health benefits. One of the benefits of sphynxing is when someone has dermatophytes. Full hair removal when sphynxing can also help to avoid jock itch. Another benefit of sphynxing is that it usually involves individuals with experience. Some men have advocated there should be equal access to sphinxing services for men. < ref > Jugli, Salomi, Jharna Chakravorty, and Victor Benno Meyer-Rochow.

 ==Concerns== 
 
 ===Health concerns=== 
 Waxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain. The pain increases in areas such as the genitals, especially for people who have not waxed before or do not wax often. Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site. Waxing is itself a safe thing, but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed. When skin is [[sunburn|sunburned,]] it is not good to get a wax treatment. < ref name=hospital/ >  [[Allergy|Allegic]] reactions can also happen with waxing. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://health.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/08/07/more-than-skin-deep-potential-dangers-of-bikini-waxing/|title=More Than Skin Deep: Potential Dangers of Bikini Waxing « FOX News Health Blog « FOXNews.com|publisher=health.blogs.foxnews.com|accessdate=2009-06-05|last=|first=|archive-date=2009-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831045622/http://health.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/08/07/more-than-skin-deep-potential-dangers-of-bikini-waxing/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  People with medical problems such as diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all. < ref name=womenshealth/ >  At least one woman, with [[diabetes]], almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,288860,00.html|title=FOXNews.com - Woman Almost Dies After Bikini Wax - Health News {{!}} Current Health News {{!}} Medical News |publisher= www.foxnews.com |accessdate= 2009-06-05 |last=|first=}} < /ref > < ref name=womenshealth/ >  In 2007 the [[New Jersey]] [[State (United States of America)|State]] Board of [[Cosmetology]] and [[Hairstyling]] came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns. < ref name=womenshealth/ > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1165754/How-safe-Brazilian-wax-They-dont-just-hurt-like-mad--land-hospital.html|title=How safe is the Brazilian wax?

Dr. Linda K. Franks, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says  " Pubic hair is there for a reason—to protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region, getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection.

 ===Waxing of children=== 
 Young children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows, legs and [[genital]] waxing. < ref name=msnbc/ >  Such genital waxing on young girls has been called  " [[virgin]] [[bikini]] "  waxes, < ref name=gothamist > {{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2008/08/15/virgin_bikini_waxing_now_popular_fo.php |title= " Virgin "  Bikini Waxing Now Popular for Pre-Teen Girls - Gothamist: New York City News, Food, Arts  &  Events |publisher=gothamist.com |accessdate=2009-06-04 |last= |first= |archive-date=2009-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719044542/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/15/virgin_bikini_waxing_now_popular_fo.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and is aimed at either reducing the girl's need for [[pubic hair]] removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before. < ref name=msnbc/ > < ref name=gothamist/ > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.wandaskincare.com/waxing-teens.htm |title=Wanda's European Skin Care of New York City waxing for teens waxing for children |publisher=www.wandaskincare.com |accessdate=2009-06-04 |last= |first= |archive-date=2009-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501081128/http://www.wandaskincare.com/waxing-teens.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   The increase in demand for [[preteen]] waxing is being met by [[spa]]s, with some 10,000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the [[United States of America]] alone. < ref >  {{cite video|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/19513736#19513736|title=Pampered princesses|publisher=MSNBC|format=[[Adobe]] flash|accessdate=2009-06-04}} < /ref >  The [[International Spa Association]] has reported that 16% of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done. < ref name=msnbc/ >  The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is [[illegal]] to survey them. < ref name=msnbc/ >   
 
 Both parents and children say that young girls feel {{broken wikt link|intense|intense}} pressure from [[television]] shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that [[peer pressure]], [[magazine]]s, [[Pop (music)|pop]] stars like [[Britney Spears]] and [[Television|TV]] shows like [[Miley Cyrus]]' [[Hannah Montana]] increase children's demands to have spa treatments such as waxing, [[microdermabrasion]] and chemical peels. < ref name=msnbc/ > < ref name=abc > {{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/BeautySecrets/Story?id=4881675 & page=2 |title=Bikini Waxing for Tweens!

 [[Doctor (title)|Dr]]. [[Diane Levin]], professor of education at [[Wheelock College]] in [[Boston]] and co-author of the book ''So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids'' < ref name=sexy > {{cite book|title=So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780345505064|last=Levin|first=Diane |author2=Jean Kilbourne |publisher= Ballantine Books |date=2008|isbn=978-0345505064}} < /ref >  (a book critical of the [[sexualization of children]]), believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to “keep your bodies like little girls’ because that’s what men like.” < ref name=msnbc/ >  This is backed up with surveys that show that 93% of men want women to, at least, remove some hair from their pubic area. < ref name=history/ >  Dr. Doris Pastor, a [[pediatrician]], feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour. < ref name=msnbc/ >  Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors. Dr. Janice Hillman, of the [[Penn Health System]], a specialist in adolescent medicine, when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of [[development]] has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common. < ref name=philly > {{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/pretty_babies/page1|title=Trend: Pretty Babies - Philadelphia Magazine - phillymag.com|publisher=www.phillymag.com|accessdate=2009-06-04|last=|first=|archive-date=2009-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803132659/http://www.phillymag.com/articles/pretty_babies/page1|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Concern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments, making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents, leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for [[beauty]] and so being made fun off by those who can afford them. < ref name=msnbc/ > < ref name=philly/ >
