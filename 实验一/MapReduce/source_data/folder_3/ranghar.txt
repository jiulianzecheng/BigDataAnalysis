In [[Haryana]], the Ranghar spoke a dialect of their own, called Ranghari, which is itself a dialect of Haryanvi, and many in Pakistan still use the language.

After independence of Pakistan in 1947, many Uttar Pradesh Ranghars also migrated to Sindh in Pakistan and mostly settling in Karachi. They are entirely Sunni Hanafi Muslims and follow Deobandi and Barelvi schools of South Asia. 
 
 The term Ranghar has also been used for closely related [[Muslims|Muslim]] communities, the Pachhada and the Muslim Tagas of Haryana and the Muley Jats. In addition, the Odh community in Pakistan are also often known as Ranghar. 
 
 == History and origin == 
 The Ranghar were pastoralists (Ahirs), [[Yaduvanshi caste|Yaduvanshi Ahirs]] who were converted to Islam are also known as Ranghars. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBMFAAAAYAAJ & pg=RA1-PT28|title=The People of India: A Series of Photographic Illustrations, with Descriptive Letterpress, of the Races and Tribes of Hindustan, Originally Prepared Under the Authority of the Government of India, and Reproduced by Order of the Secretary of State for India in Council|last1=Watson|first1=John Forbes|last2=Kaye|first2=Sir John William|date=1868|publisher=India Museum|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCAAAAAAQAAJ & dq=Jadbansi+Ranghar & pg=RA2-PA150|title=Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific: Products of the Mineral, Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms, Useful Arts and Manufactures|last=Balfour|first=Edward|date=1871|publisher=Printed at the Scottish  &  Adelphi presses|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 according to Sir H.M. Elliot, many of the Kankauiya and Naigauiya Ahirs were converted to Islam and are known as Ranghars (Crooke, 1896 : 228). < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEduAAAAMAAJ|title=Himachal Pradesh|last=India|first=Anthropological Survey of|date=1996|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India|isbn=978-81-7304-094-8|language=en|quote=according to Sir H.M.

 The Ranghar can be roughly divided into sub-groups, conveniently divided by the Yamuna river. Those to the west of the river remained as pastoralists much longer than the Yamuna Ranghar, who were all settled agriculturist by the start of the 19th century. The partition of India further divided these two groups, with the trans Yamuna Ranghar emigrating to Pakistan, while those of the Doab region remaining in India. They comprise a large numbered of dispersed intermarrying clans. These exogamous groups are made up of myriad landholding patrilineages of varying genealogical depth, ritual, and social status called biradaries or brotherhoods scattered in the various districts of western Uttar Pradesh. The biradari, or lineage is one of the principal point of reference for the Ranghars, and all biradaris claim descent from a common ancestor. Often biradaris inhabit a cluster of villages called chaurasis (84 villages), chatisis (36 villages) and chabisis (26 villages).[10] [ An example of a chatisa is that of the Chauhan Ranghar of the Agauta pargana of Bulandshahr District.
