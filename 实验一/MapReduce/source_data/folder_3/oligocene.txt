The '''Oligocene''' is the last [[Geology|geological]] epoch in the [[Palaeogene]]. It lasted for about 11 million years, from 34 million years ago to 23 million years ago. It was preceded by the [[Eocene]] and followed by the [[Miocene]]. During the Oligocene, the world continued to get cooler from its peak in the mid-Eocene. The world was still largely [[forest]]ed, but [[grassland]]s began to spread. [[Ice]] formed in [[Antarctica]]. The period is seen as one of ''transition'', both in [[climate]] and in the [[biota]]. < ref > Haines, Tim 1999. ''Walking with beasts: a prehistoric safari''.
