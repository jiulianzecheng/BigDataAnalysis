 The name  " diastase "  comes from the Greek word διάστασις (diastasis). It means a parting or separation. The enzymes simply split the starch molecule. < ref > Oliver, Garrett 2011. ''The Oxford companion to beer''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 49. {{ISBN|0199912106}}.  " Most of the activity of diastase can be attributed to the activities of two enzymes, alpha and beta [[amylase]], and, to a lesser extent, gamma amylase (together, the amylases), although many other enzymes are also present " . < /ref >  Today, diastase means any α-, β-, or γ-[[amylase]] that can break down carbohydrates. 
 
 The commonly used -ase suffix for naming enzymes was derived from the name diastase. < ref > The naming of enzymes using the suffix  " -ase "  has been traced to French scientist [[Émile Duclaux]] (1840-1904), who intended to honor the discoverers of diastase by introducing the term in his book ''Traité de Microbiologie'', vol 2. Paris: Masson, 1899, Chapter 1, especially page 9. < /ref >  The breakdown of starches follows a general diastase-catalysed reaction:
