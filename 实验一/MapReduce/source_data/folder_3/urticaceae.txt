 '''Urticaceae''' the nettle family comprising about 45 genera of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and a few vines, distributed primarily in tropical regions. The family is typical of the [[Urticales|nettle order]].  
 
 == Description == 
 Many species, especially the [[nettle]]s (''Urtica'') and Australian nettle trees (''Laportea''), have stinging hairs on the stems and leaves. The leaves are varied and the sap is usually watery.  
 The small, greenish flowers often form clusters in the leaf axils. Both male and female flowers may be borne on the same plant. The curled stamens of the male flowers straighten quickly as the flowers open, releasing the pollen.
