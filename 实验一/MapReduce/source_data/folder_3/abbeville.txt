 '''Abbeville''' {{IPA-fr|ab.vil}} is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Somme]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Hauts-de-France]] in northern [[France]]. 
 
 ==Location== 
 Abbeville is on the [[Somme River]], {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from its modern mouth in the [[English Channel]]. Most of the town is on the east bank of the Somme, as well as on an [[:wikt:island|island]]. < ref name=Colliers > {{cite encyclopedia|last1=Van Valkenburg|first1=Samuel|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Johnston|encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Abbeville|edition=First |year=1997|publisher=P.F. Collier|volume=I A to Ameland|location=New York, NY|pages=8}} < /ref >   It is at the start of the Abbeville [[Canal]], and is {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} [[:wikt:northwest|northwest]] of [[Amiens]]. In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], it was the lowest crossing point on the Somme. [[Edward III of England|Edward III's]] army crossed nearby shortly before the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. 
 
 ==Administration== 
 
 Abbeville was the capital of the former [[:wikt:province|province]] of France of [[Ponthieu]]. Today, it is one of the three [[:en:wikt:subprefecture|subprefecture]]s of the [[Somme]] [[Departments of France|department]].

 ==Etymology== 
 The Romans occupied it and named it ''Abbatis Villa''. < ref name=Colliers/ > 
 
 ==Prehistory== 
 The name Abbeville has been adopted to name a category of [[paleolithic]] < ref name=Colliers/ >  [[stone tool]]s. These stone tools are also known as [[Hand axe|handaxes]]. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by Jacques Boucher de Perthes during the 1830s. He was the first to describe the stones in detail. He pointed out in the first publication of its kind, that the stones were chipped deliberately by [[Human evolution|early man]], so as to form a tool. These stone tools which are some of the earliest found in Europe, were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, were known as 'Abbevillian' handaxes or [[biface]]s, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/arch-encyclopedia/abbeville-france |title=Abbeville, France: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |publisher=www.enotes.com |access-date=2009-10-08 }} < /ref >  but recently the term 'abevillian' is becoming obsolete as the earlier form of stone tool, not found in Europe, is known as the [[Oldowan]] chopper. Some of these [[:en:wikt:artifacts|artifacts]] are displayed at the [[:wikt:museum|museum]] Boucher-de-Perthes. < ref name=EB > {{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Abbeville |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=11}} < /ref > 
 
 A more refined form from a later period of handaxe [[:wikt:production|production]] was found in the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handaxe became known as the [[Acheulean]] industry, named after [[Saint-Acheul]], today a suburb of [[Amiens]]. It retained some importance into the [[Bronze Age]]. < ref name=Colliers/ > 
 
 ==History== 
 
 Abbeville during the ninth century was part of the [[:wikt:diocese|diocese]] of [[Saint-Riquier]]. < ref name=EB/ >  It was also an important [[:wikt:fortress|fortress]] responsible for the [[:wikt:defense|defense]] of the Somme. Abbeville had a charter granted to it in 1184. < ref name=EB/ >  Afterwards it was governed by the [[Ponthieu|Counts of Ponthieu]]. Together with that county, it came into the [[:wikt:possession|possession]] of the [[Alençon]] and other French families. Afterwards it came into the possession of the [[Crown of Castile|House of Castile]]. By marriage it passed in 1272 to King [[Edward I of England]].  In 1435, by the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|treaty of Arras]], it was [[:en:wikt:ceded|ceded]] to the [[Duke of Burgundy]]. In 1477 it was taken control of by King [[Louis XI of France]],. < ref name=Colliers/ >  Later it was held by two illegitimate branches of [[Royal family|the royal family]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, being in 1696 returned to the [[:wikt:crown|crown]]. In 1514, the town was the place where the marriage of [[Louis XII of France]] to [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] took place. She was the daughter of [[Henry VII of England]]. < ref name=EB/ >  In 1685, it suffered a serious economic when the [[Edict of Nantes]] was repealed. The [[Protestants]] who were the majority of the skilled labor, left town. The town never fully recovered from the loss of their [[:wikt:talents|talents]]. < ref name=Colliers/ > 
 
 Abbeville was fairly important in the 18th century. Van Robais Royal Manufacture (one of the first major factories in France) brought great [[:wikt:prosperity|prosperity]] to the town.  [[Voltaire]], among others, wrote about it. 
 
 Abbeville was the birthplace of [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Amédée Courbet]] (1827–85). His victories on land and at sea made him a [[Hero|national hero]] during the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885). Courbet died in June 1885 in the [[Penghu|Pescadores Islands]]. His body was brought back to France and buried in Abbeville on 1 September 1885 after a [[state funeral]].  Abbeville's old [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Square]] (Place du Marché-au-Blé) was renamed Place de l'Amiral Courbet in July 1885. This was shortly after the news of Courbet's death reached France. A statue of Courbet was erected in the middle of the square at the end of the nineteenth century.  The statue was damaged in a bombing raid during [[World War II]]. 
 
 On 12 September 1939 in Abbeville a [[:wikt:conference|conference]] took place. There France and the [[United Kingdom]] decided it was  too late to send troops to help [[Poland]] in its fight against Germany. By this time Poland was already on the verge of defeat. After five years—in September 1944—Abbeville was liberated by the Polish First Armoured Division under General Maczek. 
 
 ===The Blitzkrieg=== 
 [[File:16May-21May1940-Fall Gelb.svg|thumb|right|500px|The German advance until 21 May 1940]] 
 
 In 1940, the Germans with the bulk of their armoured force in Panzer Group von Kleist achieved a breakthrough at Sedan with [[Close air support|air support]]. The Panzer group raced to the coast of the [[English Channel]] at Abbeville. This isolated (20 May 1940) the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]], [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian Army]], and some divisions of the [[French Army]] in northern France. < ref > Wikipedia [[Blitzkrieg]]. < /ref >  The [[Battle of France]] was lost by the Allies. 
 
 [[Charles de Gaulle]] (17–18 May 1940), as a Colonel in this period, launched a [[:en:wikt:counterattack|counterattack]] in the region of [[Laon]] (see the map). He had 80 tanks to  destroy the communication of the German [[Armoured warfare|armoured troops]]. His newly formed [[4e Division cuirassée]] reached [[Montcornet, Aisne|Montcornet]], resulting in the [[Battle of Montcornet]]. But, without support,  the 4th DCR was forced  to retreat. There was another counterattack with the [[Battle of Abbeville]]. After Laon (24 May), de Gaulle was promoted to temporary general:  " On 28 May (...) the 4th DCR attacked twice to destroy a pocket captured by the enemy south of the Somme near Abbeville. The operation was successful, with over 400 prisoners taken and the entire pocket mopped up except for Abbeville (...) but in the second attack the 4th DCR failed to gain control of the city in the face of superior enemy numbers.

 ==Economy== 
 Abbeville manufactures [[:en:wikt:textiles|textiles]]; in particular, [[:wikt:linens|linens]] and [[:wikt:tablecloths|tablecloths]]. It also has [[:en:wikt|cordage|cordage]] factories and spinning [[:wikt:mills|mills]]. Finally, it also makes [[:wikt:locks|locks]] and produces [[:wikt:sugar|sugar]]. < ref name=Colliers/ >

 ==Sights== 
 The city was very picturesque until the early days of the [[World War II]]. It was bombed mostly to rubble in one night by the Germans. The town overall is now mostly modern and rebuilt. Several of the town's attractions remain, including: 
 
 * [[Wulfram of Sens|St. Vulfran]]'s church, erected in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The original design was not completed. The [[nave]] has only two bays and the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] is insignificant. The [[:en:wikt:façade|façade]] is an outstanding example of the [[flamboyant]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], flanked by two Gothic towers. 
 * The Boucher de Perthes Museum, in the now unused [[bell tower]]. It is a tribute to [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes]] who also has a French public secondary school named after him. The museum features art work and other artefacts from the 16th century onwards, and other [[:en:wikt:exhibitions|exhibitions]] that change every few months. 
 * A monument ''aux morts'' (to the dead) with [[:en:wikt:sculptural|sculptural]] work by Louis-Henri Leclabart. A [[Photomontage|montage]] of [[:wikt:photographs|photographs]] of this monument is shown below.
