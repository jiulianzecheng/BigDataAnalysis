 {{Greek alphabet|letter=phi}} 
 '''Phi''' (uppercase/lowercase '''Φ φ'''), is the 21st letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used to represent the  " ph "  sound in [[Ancient Greek]]. This sound changed to  " f "  some time in the 1st century AD, and in [[Modern Greek language|Modern Greek]] the letter denotes the  " f "  sound. In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 500. The Cyrillic letter [[Ф]] came from Phi. In English, φ is pronounced like  " f "  but transliterated (re-written) as  " ph "  in words which originate in Ancient Greek. In those words which originate in Modern Greek, such as [[feta]] [[cheese]], φ is transliterated as  " f " . The letter Phi is used to represent the [[golden ratio]] (which is about 1.618). < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Golden Ratio|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldenRatio.html|access-date=2020-08-10|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}} < /ref >
