 An '''imam'''  ({{lang-ar|إمام}}; {{lang-fa|امام}}) is an [[Islam]]ic leader, often the leader of a [[mosque]] and/or community. Similarly to spiritual leaders, the imam is the person who leads the prayer during Islamic gatherings. More often the community turn to the mosque imam, if they have an Islamic question. In smaller communities an imam could be the community leader based on the community setting. 
 
 [[Shia Islam]] uses the term differently. Shiites give the title to only the one true leader of all the faithful.
