 '''Anggun Cipta Sasmi''' ( < small > Indonesian pronunciation: < /small >  [aŋˈɡun ˈt͡ʃipta ˈsasmi]; born 29 April 1974) is an [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] and [[French language|French]]-naturalised singer-songwriter. Born in [[Jakarta]], she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. With the help of famed Indonesian producer Ian Antono, in 1986 Anggun released her first [[Rock music|rock]]-influenced studio album, ''Dunia Aku Punya''. She became further well known with the single  " Mimpi "  (1989), which was listed as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. She followed it with a series of singles and three more studio albums, which established her as one of the most prominent Indonesian rock stars of the early 1990s. 
 
 Anggun left Indonesia in 1994 to pursue an international career. After two years struggling in [[London]] and [[Paris]], Anggun met French producer Erick Benzi and signed to [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Her first international album, ''Snow on the Sahara'' (1997), was released in 33 countries and became the best-selling album by an [[Asia|Asian]] artist outside Asia. The album spawned her signature hit  " Snow on the Sahara " , which reached number one in several countries. Since her international breakthrough, Anggun has released five English-language studio albums and six French-language studio albums, as well as a soundtrack album to the [[Danish language|Danish]] film ''Open Hearts'' (2002). She represented [[France]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 2012 in [[Baku|Baku, Azerbaijan]], with the song  " Echo (You and I) " . She joined the judging panel of talent shows ''X Factor Indonesia'' (2013) and ''Asia's Got Talent'' (2015); the former made her the highest-paid judge in Indonesian television history. 
 
 Anggun is the Asian artist with the highest album sales outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some [[Europe|European]] countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France and the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist. Aside from her musical career, Anggun has been involved in numerous [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] works. She has been appointed as the global ambassador of the [[United Nations]] twice, first for the International Year of Microcredit in 2005 and then for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2009 onwards.
