 '''Heligoland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|l|ᵻ|ɡ|oʊ|l|æ|n|d}}; {{lang-de|Helgoland}} {{IPA-de|ˈhɛlɡolant|}}) is a small [[Germany|German]] group of islands in the [[North Sea]].. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Heligoland: The True Story of German Bight and the Island the Britain Forgot|last=Drower|first=George|publisher=The History Press|year=2011|isbn=9780752472805|location=|pages=}} < /ref > 
 
 It has been controlled by [[Denmark]] and between 1807 and 1890 by the [[British Empire|British]]. The islands have a population of 1,650. They are the only German islands not nearby to the mainland and are about two hours' sailing time from [[Cuxhaven]] at the mouth of the River [[Elbe]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Heligoland is located 70 [[kilometre|km]] (44 [[mile]]s) from the German coast line and actually consists of two islands: the populated triangular-shaped 1 [[km²]] (0.4 [[square mile|sq mi]]) main island ({{lang-de|Hauptinsel}}) to the west and the island of ''Düne'' (Heligolandic: ''de Halem'') in the east.  
 
 Düne is the smaller of the two islands(0.7 km²).  It is also lower, surrounded by sand beaches and no-one lives on the island throughout the year. 
 
 Often when people talk about  " Heligoland "  they only mean Hauptinsel.
