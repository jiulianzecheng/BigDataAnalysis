 '''''Nodosaurus''''' (meaning  " knobbed lizard " ) was a large, armored, quadrupedal (it walked on four legs), tank-like dinosaur. It lived in the first part of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] about 113–98 million years ago. Three very incomplete ''Nodosaurus'' fossils have been found in [[Wyoming]] and [[Kansas]]; no skulls have been found yet. It was named by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Othniel C. Marsh]] in 1889. 
 
 ''Nodosaurus'' was about 13 to 20 ft (4-6 m) long. It was an [[ornithischia]]n (bird-hipped) dinosaur with bony dermal plates covering the top of its body. It had four short legs, five-toed feet, a short neck, and a long, clubless tail. The nodosaurids had no tail club; it is not known how they defended themselves.
