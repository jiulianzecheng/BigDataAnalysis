 A '''lance''' is a [[:wikt:pole|pole]] [[:wikt:weapon|weapon]] or [[spear]] used by a [[cavalry|mounted warrior]]. The lance is longer, thicker and [[:wikt:heavier|heavier]] than an [[infantry]] spear, and is not [[:wikt:intended|intended]] for [[:wikt:throwing|throwing]], or for quick [[thrust|thrusting]]. Lances did not have tips meant to break off or bend, unlike many throwing weapons of the spear and javelin family. They often had a vamplate, a small circular plate to prevent the hand sliding up the shaft upon impact.  
 
 The lance was longer than a spear, about 9â€“10 feet long. < ref name=Devries130 > Kelly Robert DeVries; Robert Douglas Smith, ''Medieval weapons: an illustrated history of their impact'' (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2007), p. 130 < /ref >  When [[Charge (warfare)|charging]] the lance was carried under the arm (couched) using the weight of the horse and rider to push the lance tip into its intended [[:wikt:target|target]]. It was a [[medieval]] shock and awe weapon (caused great fear) to have a number of mounted knights with lances charging towards you. < ref name=Devries130/ >  In many cases it caused panic and the enemy fled the battle.  
 
 They were used by [[Europe]]an knights, but the use of lances was spread over the [[Old World]] wherever horses were available. The use of the lance was made possible by the use of the [[stirrup]] added to [[saddle]]s. < ref name=Hilliam17 > Paul Hilliam, ''Medieval Weapons and Warfare: Armies and Combat in Medieval Times'' (New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 2004), p. 17 < /ref >  It allowed the knight to control the horse and stand in the saddle. < ref name=Hilliam17/ >  As a [[:wikt:backup|backup]] weapon, lancers (one who used a lance) of that [[:wikt:period|period]] also carried swords, maces (a type of [[:wikt:club|club]]) or something else suited to hand-to-hand (or close) combat, since the lance was often used only once during an event. It could not be used once the combatants were close to each other.
