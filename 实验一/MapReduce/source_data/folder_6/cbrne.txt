'''CBRNE''' is an [[acronym]] for '''Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive''' materials.  These materials are very [[danger]]ous, and can hurt many people.  When they are used on purpose, CBRNE materials are [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].  However, CBRNE events can also happen accidentally. < ref name=ceep > {{cite web |url=http://www.ceep.ca/education/CBRNintrosheet.pdf |title=What is CBRN? |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=ceep.ca |publisher=The Centre for Excellence in Emergency Preparedness (Ontario) |access-date=February 3, 2016 |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413021530/http://www.ceep.ca/education/CBRNintrosheet.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 ==Types of CBRNE weapons== 
 
 ===Chemical=== 
 {{Main|Chemical warfare}} 
 
 The main types of chemical weapons are: < ref name=primer/ > 
 
 * [[Nerve gas|Nerve agents]], which attack the [[central nervous system]].  Examples include types of [[pesticide]]s called [[organophosphate]]s; [[sarin]]; and [[VX]]. 
 * [[Blister agent]]s, which cause [[burn]]s and [[blister]]s both inside and outside of the body.  Examples include the [[mustard gas]]es. 
 * [[Blood agent]]s, which make it impossible for the [[blood]] to carry [[oxygen]] to the body.  The most common blood agents are made with [[cyanide]]. 
 * [[Choking agent]]s, which attack the [[lungs]] and make them [[pulmonary edema|fill with fluid]].  This makes [[breathing]] impossible.  Examples include [[chlorine]] gas and [[phosgene]]. 
 * [[Incapacitating agent]]s, which are designed to hurt a large number of people, and make it impossible for them to fight back, but without killing them. Examples include [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]]. 
 
 [[International law]]s make it [[illegal]] to use [[chemical weapons]].  However, [[terrorists]] have ignored these laws.  For example, in 1995, terrorists attacked the [[Rapid transit|subway]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with [[sarin]]. < ref name=whitehouse/ > 
 
 ===Biological=== 
 {{Main|Biological warfare}} 
 
 The goal of [[biological weapon]]s is to get as many people sick with [[infectious disease]]s as possible.  Types of biological weapons include: < ref name=ceep/ > < ref name=primer/ > 
 * [[Bacteria]], like the bacteria that cause [[anthrax]] and [[plague]] 
 * [[Virus]]es, like the ones that cause [[smallpox]], [[Ebola]], and the [[flu]] 
 * [[Toxin]]s (poisons made by living things), like [[ricin]], [[botulism]] toxin, and [[aflatoxin]] 
 
 In 2001, a terrorist used a biological weapon against the United States by sending letters filled with anthrax through the mail to many different people. < ref name=ceep/ >   Ricin has also been sent through the mail as a biological attack. < ref name=whitehouse/ > 
 
 ===Radiological=== 
 A [[radiological]] weapon is any kind of weapon that spreads [[radiation]].  For example: 
 * A dirty bomb which uses radioactive material to cause lasting effect on the environment 
 * Contaminating food or water supplies with [[radioactive contamination]] 
 
 In 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy, was [[murder]]ed when someone put [[polonium]]-210, a radioactive material, in his food. < ref name=ceep/ > 
 
 The White House's report says that there is radiological material all around the world that is not guarded. < ref name=whitehouse/ >

 ===Nuclear=== 
 {{Main|Nuclear weapon}} 
 
 N is for Nuclear explosion. This can occur one of two ways Fissure and Fusion. Fissure occurs when an atom is spliced apart forming two new atoms. This causes a discharge of energy. Fusion on the other hand forces two atoms together. The process breaks apart the atoms and fuses them together. The reaction discharges energy.  
 Many countries have tested nuclear weapons.  [[World War II]], the United States dropped two nuclear bombs on the [[Japan]]ese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].  
 In Hiroshima, the nuclear bomb destroyed {{convert|4.7|sqmi|km2}} of the city, < ref name=autogenerated2 > {{cite web |publisher=Harry S.

 The United Nations later made the use of Nuclear weapons illegal which is largely due to the radiation that is brought along with as well as earthquakes and other natural disasters. While true to this day many countries still manufacture these weapons today. 
 
 ===Explosives=== 
 E as in explosives stands for high-yield explosive. High-yield explosive is materials that rapidly release large amounts of energy and produce a pressure shock wave during detonation.  
 
 High-Yield Explosions can occur in labs and hospitals that contain compressed gas. One highly explosive gas is Acetylene which is commonly found under pressure to containment and later use. There are types of liquids like Nitroglycerin that can be subjected to pressure explosion as well. 
 
 ==Accidental CBRNE events== 
 Examples of accidental CBRNE events include: < ref name=ceep / > 
 * Chemical: Accidental chemical spills (like an [[oil spill]], or a dangerous chemical leaking out of a [[laboratory]]) 
 * Biological: [[Outbreak]]s of infectious disease (like a flu [[epidemic]]) 
 * Radiological: Accidental spills of radioactive chemicals in laboratories or [[hospital]]s (like a spill of [[uranyl nitrate]], which is used to look at viruses under [[electron microscope]]s); accidents during [[radiation therapy]] 
 * Nuclear: Accidents at nuclear power plants like [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 
 * Explosive:  A person who is on [[oxygen]] for breathing problems lights a cigarette and accidentally blows up her entire apartment building
