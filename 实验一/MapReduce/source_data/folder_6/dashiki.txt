 == History == 
 The dashiki originated in West Africa and East Africa. < ref name=Lynch97 > ''Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', eds. Annette Lynch; Mitchell D. Strauss (Lanham, MD: Rowman  &  Littlefield, 2015), p. 97 < /ref >  [[12th century|Twelfth]] and [[13th century|thirteenth centuries]] [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] in [[Mali]] (West Africa) have [[wikt:reveal|reveal]]ed versions of dashikis. < ref name=Lynch97/ >  Dashikis were worn by both men and women. They may have been [[wikt:influence|influence]]d by the [[thawb]] worn by [[Arabs]] who came to the region. < ref name=Lynch97/ >  Both garments keep the wearer cool in the hot African [[climate]]. The dashiki was worn as a work shirt in the shorter version. Another much longer version was called the [[Boubou (clothing)|grand boubou]]. < ref name=Lynch97/ >  It is also similar to the [[kaftan]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://doloresmonet.hubpages.com/hub/KaftanorCaftanAFashionHistoryofModestyandGlamor |title=Kaftan or Caftan - A Fashion History of Modesty and Glamor|author=Dolores Monet |date=3 August 2014 |website= |publisher=HubPages Inc. |accessdate=29 April 2015}} < /ref >  All three are common to West Africa.
