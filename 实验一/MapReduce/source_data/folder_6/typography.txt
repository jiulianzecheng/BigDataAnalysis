 '''Typography''' is the practical [[art]] of arranging how the [[print]]ed word appears on the [[page]]. < ref name=Tsch > Tschichold, Jan 1991. ''The form of the book: essays on the morality of good design''. Hartley  &  Marks, Vancouver. {{ISBN|978-0-88179-034-4}}. < /ref >  Typography was born when print was born. < ref > Lefebre L.  &  Martin H-J. 1990. ''The coming of the book''. new ed, London. < /ref > < ref name=short/ >  Early types were based on the letterforms of [[scribe]]s, and the [[Letter|letters]] cut into [[Trajan's Column]] ( " monumental inscriptions " ). < ref > Morison, Stanley. 1926 ''Type designs of the past and present''. Fleuron, London. < /ref >  Later, gradually, type designs were based on the special needs of [[Book|books]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], [[Newspaper|newspapers]] and [[Advertising|advertisements]]. < ref > Twyman, Michael 1970. ''Printing 1770{{ndash}}1970''. London: Eyre  &  Spottiswoode, Chapter 3 Types and other letterforms. < /ref > 
 
 Typography {{Pronunciation|Typography.ogg}} includes not only letters, but all the set of [[Symbol|symbols]] in a [[font]], and it includes the overall [[design]] of a page or [[document]]. < ref > Tracy, Walter 1986. ''Letters of credit: a view of type design''. Gordon Fraser, London. {{ISBN|0-86092-085-2}} < /ref >  It applies to any medium which may be read; therefore it includes text on [[Computer monitor|computer screens]]. A '''typographer''' may design [[type]], select [[font]]s, and [[design]] the [[Page layout|layout of pages]] and [[book]]s. The term does not cover the act of [[printing]] itself, though many of the early printers were themselves typographers. < ref name=short > Chappell W.  &  Bringhurst R. ''A short history of the printed word''. Hartley  &  Marks, Vancouver. {{ISBN|978-0-88179-154-9}} < /ref > 
 
 Typography in the [[20th century]] was greatly influenced by three things: 
 #[[Modernism]] and the [[modern art]] movement. < ref name=Tsch/ > < ref > Spencer, Herbert. 1969. ''Pioneers of modern typography''. Lund Humphries, London. Revised edition by Rick Poynor MIT Press 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-262-69303-5}} < /ref > 
 #Information about the [[wikt:effect|effectiveness]] of typography and [[design]]. Some of this comes from formal 'scientific' [[Experiment|experiments]], < ref > Tinker M.A. 1963 ''The legibility of print''. Iowa State University Press: Ames, Iowa. < /ref > < ref > Cornog D.Y.  &  F.C. Rose 1967. ''Legibility of alphanumeric characters and other symbols: II. A reference handbook''. Washington D.C. National Bureau of Standards. < /ref >  but most comes from commercial sources. < ref > Journals on advertising research contain hundreds of examples. < /ref >  Naturally, sales results before and after a book or magazine redesign are compared. A redesign of the typography on the jacket of a book (''Roget's Thesaurus'')  " nearly doubled the sales " . < ref > Tedesco A.P. 1948. ''The relationship between type and illustration in books and book jackets''. George McKibbin, New York. p31 < /ref >  Typographers themselves carry out mini-experiments to test alternatives. < ref > Spencer, Herbert 1952. ''Design for business printing''. Sylvan Press, London. p88 < /ref >  This is an extension of [[scientific method]] to what is, at heart, an artistic process.

 A traditional aim of the typographer would be to produce a page which is, above all, ''[[legibility|legible]]'' and ''attractive'' to [[Literacy|read]], without its being obtrusive. For display typography, such as advertising, the display must be ''noticed'' before it is read. This had led to the development of many display typefaces which are highly visible, and which are available in large sizes. < ref name=Gott > Gottschall, Edward M. 1989. ''Typographic communications today''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London. {{ISBN|0-262-07114-2}} < /ref > < ref > Bringhurst, Robert 2002. ''The elements of typographic style'' (version 2.5).
