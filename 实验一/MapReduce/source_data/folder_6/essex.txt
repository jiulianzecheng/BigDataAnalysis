 '''Essex''' is a [[county]] in the east of [[England]]. It has a population of around 1,750,000 people. It is part of the [[East of England]] region. [[Chelmsford]] is the [[county town]] of Essex, as well as being its only city. Essex has [[London]] and [[Hertfordshire]] on its western border and the whole of the east of the county is [[Coast|coast-line]]. The north of the county borders [[Suffolk]] and [[Cambridgeshire]]. The south of the county is on the Thames Estuary. The Dartford Tunnel can be used to drive under the [[River Thames]] between Essex and Kent. 
 
 Other large towns in Essex are [[Colchester]], the oldest town in [[England]], [[Basildon]], a [[new town]], and in the south-eastern corner of the county [[Southend]], one of [[Britain]]'s biggest seaside resorts. 
 
 There has been lots of recent debate about whether certain sections of East London should be included as parts of Essex, such as [[Ilford]] and [[Romford]]. Due to boundary changes across the years, these areas were historically in Essex but have been dissolved into the [[Greater London]] area since.
