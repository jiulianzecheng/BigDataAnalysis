 == History == 
 The [[Grafschaft Abbey|Benedictine monastery]] began in 1072 near Schmallenberg on a site at the foot of the Wilzenberg mountain, by [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne|Saint Anno]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. < ref > Stadt Schmallenberg: Beiträge zur Geschichte der Stadt Schmallenberg 1244–1969, Schmallenberg, 1969 < /ref > 
 
 " Alexander de Smalenburg "  is said to have given his name to the city of Schmallenberg. The origins of the narrow castle lie in a castle complex that belonged to [[Cologne]], and in 1244 the curtain-walled settlement was officially elevated to city status by [[Konrad von Hochstaden]], Archbishop of Cologne. 
 
 During the [[Middle Ages]], [[textile]] and [[ironmongery]] trades were the main industries in Schmallenberg. Around 1350 there were about 800 living in the town. After an economically quiet period during the [[16th century]], the new iron hammer technology put the city back on the map. At that time, Schmallenberg’s ironmongery trade was considered the most important one in [[Westphalia]]. 
 
 In parts of the town like in [[Oberkirchen]] there were many [[witchcraft]] trials. In 1630 there were 7 processes, from April to June. During these, 58 people were convicted to burn at the stake, for alleged witchcraft. One of the victims was [[Christine Teipel]], a 9-year-old child. 
 
 After a big fire in 1822, the town was rebuilt using a classical ground plan. This can still be seen today. Ten years before that, the city wall and gates had been torn down. Today, Schmallenberg’s typical features are its half-timbered houses with slated roofs and carved doors, small bays and gables as well as symmetric perrons.
