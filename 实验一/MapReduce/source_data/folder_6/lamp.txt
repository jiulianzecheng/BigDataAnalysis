In the [[United States]], a lamp is usually considered a desk lamp or floor lamp. Other sources of light are called 'lights', such as [[streetlight]]s, [[flashlight]]s, and headlights, which in some countries are called streetlamps, torches and [[headlamp]]s. 
 
 Before electric lamps were invented, gas lamps, [[oil lamp]]s or [[candle|candles]] were used.
