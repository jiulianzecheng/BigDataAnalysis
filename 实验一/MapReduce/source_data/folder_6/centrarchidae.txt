 '''Centrarchidae''' or '''sunfish''' are a [[family (biology)|family]]  of freshwater [[ray-finned fish]]. They belonging to the order [[Perciformes]]. The [[type genus]] is '''''Centrarchus''''' (consisting solely of the [[Flier (fish)|flier]], ''C. macropterus'').  
 
 The family's 37 species include many fish familiar to [[North America]]ns, including the [[rock bass]], [[largemouth bass]], [[bluegill]], [[pumpkinseed]], and [[crappie]]s. All are native only to North America. Family members are distinguished by having from five to 13 [[dorsal]] spines, which are sharp [[bone]]s in the [[dorsal fin]]. Sizes of most are in the {{convert|20|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} range. However, some are much smaller, with the [[Enneacanthus chaetodon|black-banded sunfish]] at just {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, while the [[largemouth bass]] is reported to reach almost {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in extreme cases. < ref name=EoF/ > 
 
 The male of most species builds a [[nest]] by hollowing out a depression using his [[tail]], then guards the [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. < ref name=EoF > {{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R.  &  Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Johnson, G.D.  &  Gill, A.C.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffi00unse/page/187 187]|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}} < /ref >  Most sunfish are valued for [[sport fishing]].
