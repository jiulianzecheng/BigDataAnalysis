 A fortnight is a word that is commonly used in sporting communities. Many big sports events have a two-week or around a half-month time frame. In [[tennis]], [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] and the other [[Grand Slam tournaments]] are played over two weeks and are often referred to as lasting a fortnight. The [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] are also slightly longer than two weeks and may be called a fortnight as well. Various other events in the sporting world may last around a fortnight.
