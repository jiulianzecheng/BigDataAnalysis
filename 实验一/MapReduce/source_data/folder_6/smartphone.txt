 A '''smartphone''' is a [[mobile phone]] that can also be used as a [[computer]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gadgetreviews/smartphone-vs-feature-phone-arms-race-heats-up-which-did-you-buy/6836

 They are powered by ARM based chips or (SoC)s to fit in such a small form factor. 
 
 Uses include: 
 * Sending and receiving [[email]]s, [[SMS|text]], [[photograph]]s and [[multimedia]] messages 
 * Registering contacts 
 * [[Calculator]], [[currency]] conversions, [[alarm]], etc. functions 
 * Browsing the [[Internet]] using a [[mobile browser]] 
 * Playing [[game]]s 
 * [[Video chat]] 
 * Mobile [[payment]] for goods or services 
 * [[Barcode]] scanning 
 * [[Photography]] and video recording 
 * Use as torch to make light in dark areas 
 * Taking and searching notes  
 * Showing map of user's location by GPS ([[Global Positioning System]])  
 
 Another way to think of them is that they are [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] that can make voice calls like any other mobile phone. Older phones also used computer technology, but lacked many of the parts of a computer that were too big to fit into a phone. Modern phone makers have been able to use smaller parts. Most smartphones are also [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers and [[digital camera]]s. 
 
 Because smartphones are small computers, they run an [[operating system]] that is often common between devices to ensure compatibility. The majority of smartphones run on [[iOS|Apple iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Google Android]] but others use [[Windows Phone]] or [[BlackBerry|BlackBerry OS]]. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Smartphone definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Smartphone & i=51537,00.asp|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116075203/https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3DSmartphone%26i%3D51537%2C00.asp|archive-date=16 November 2007|accessdate=13 May 2010|work=[[PC Magazine]]}} < /ref >  Most can do [[multitasking]], running  more than one [[program]] which helps the user do things quicker and easier. Users can get more programs, called [[mobile app]]s, from the [[manufacturer]]'s [[Mobile app|app store]], such as the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] which can help them complete special tasks.  
 
 [[Data communication]] has become faster. Smart phones can send and receive data much faster than older phones. The industry uses different standards to label the data transmission rates. [[2G]] was introduced in 1991. 2G means '''''2'''nd '''G'''eneration''. 2G phones transmit data at about the same speed as a 56kbit/s ([[kilobit]]s per second) [[dial-up]] modem would get. 
 
 [[3G]] was introduced in the early 2000s. Depending on where they are, 3G phones vary in speed between about 200kbit/s to 14Mbit/s ([[megabit]]s per second). This is comparable to a [[DSL]] or low end [[cable modem]] speed. Most smart phones use 3G technology to make them fast enough to practically use [[internet]] and other data features. Faster [[4G]] networks operate in many places, with speeds estimated as fast as 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s (gigabit per second). This is as fast as some computer networks that use [[ethernet]]. Many smart phones introduced after 2010 use 4G technology including LTE, as later, even faster version. [[5G]] was introduced in a few places in 2019. 
 
 Smartphones are powered by [[battery|batteries]].  The amount of energy they can store is reduced over time, and they become weaker.  This causes the phone to become slower and later to turn itself off without the user asking for it.  Some smartphones are designed so the user is able to take off the rear cover and replace the weakened battery.  Most newer smartphones are not made like this. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Chen |first1=Brian X. |title=Your iPhone Slowed Down. Hereâ€™s What to Do When the Solution Is Just as Slow.

 == Use as camera == 
 Smartphones are also [[camera phone]] < nowiki/ > s.  They are usually not as capable as dedicated cameras.  Some phones have sophisticated camera software allowing such features as independent setting of bitrate, framerate and resolution,. < ref > {{cite web |title=LG V10 review: Screen play |url=https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_v10-review-1333p9.php |website=GSMArena.com |pages=8-9}} < /ref >   Such controls have only been adapted starting in the mid-2010s.  As of early 2021, mobile phone chipsets may be capable of 2160p [[4K resolution|4K]] video capture at 120 frames per second. < ref > {{cite web |title=Samsung Exynos 9 8895 Series 4k 120fps Capable!,|url=https://www.hispeedcams.com/samsung-exynos-9-8895-series-4k-120fps-capable/ |website=Hi Speed Cameras |date=4 March 2017}} < /ref >
