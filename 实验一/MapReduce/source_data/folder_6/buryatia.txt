 The '''Republic of Buryatia''' is a Mongolic federal subject in Russia. It is one of the 85 [[federal subjects of Russia]]. It is in the [[Siberia|Siberian]] area of [[Russia]]. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Buryatia also shares an international border with [[Mongolia]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 In the past, the Buryats were linked and related to the [[Mongols]]. It is because of the close distance and trade with each other. They also share a similar culture. Because of this the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols many times. The [[Xiongnu]] Empire (209 BC-93 CE), [[Kublai Khan]]'s Mongol Empire (1206-1368) and the Northern Yuan Empire (1368-1691), were examples when the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols. Other Mongol tribes also lived in Buryatia during that time too. < ref name='Buryat' > {{cite web| url=http://factsanddetails.com/russia/Minorities/sub9_3e/entry-5123.html| title=Buryats Facts and Details| year=2016| access-date=2018-11-07}} < /ref >  The Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area of the present-day Buryatia during the 17th century. They came because they were looking for furs and gold. < ref > {{cite web| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buryat| title=Buryat History| year=2018| access-date=2018-11-07}} < /ref >  Later during the 1920s, the area was affected by the violence of the [[Russian Civil War]]. In 1923, the Buryat-Mongolian [[Autonomous republic|Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was formed at the end of the civil war to put in place a proper rule. The area changed size and name many times while it was in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Buryat ASSR started controlling itself in 1990. This was when the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] and Buryatia took on the name Republic of Buryatia in 1992. However, it continued to be a [[republic]] in Russia. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Buryatia is in the south central part of Siberia. Because of this it has a [[subarctic climate]], which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers.

There are many animals and birds in the area. These animals and birds may appear depending on the season. The area is also rich in minerals like gold, tungsten, uranium, zinc and more.
