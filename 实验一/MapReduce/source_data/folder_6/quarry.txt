A '''quarry''' is a type of [[Surface mining|open pit mine]] that is used to get [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[mineral]]s from the ground. Quarries are often used to cut [[stone]] from the ground in large pieces or blocks. These are called [[dimension stone]]s. They are used for building things. Some quarries fill with [[water]] to make small [[lake]]s when they are no longer being used for mining.
