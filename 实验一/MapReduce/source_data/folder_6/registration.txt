 '''Registration''' is a method of officially recording something. Usually something is registered to claim more rights, or to protect ownership, or because the law says it must be registered to be used legally. 
 
 A register was a large book. It was used like a diary to record business dealings or other events. 
 
 == Reasons for registration == 
 '''[[Birth]]s, [[death]]s''', and '''[[marriage]]s''' are registered to prove the date the event happened. In the United Kingdom these records are kept by the local registrar, who is in charge of the Register office. 
 
 '''[[Motor vehicle]]s''' are registered to prove who owns the vehicle and to identify them. Those that not registered cannot be driven on roads. [[Aircraft]] not registered cannot be flown. Proof that a vehicle is registered is the [[vehicle registration plate]]. Vehicles must also be registered before they can be [[insurance|insured]] in case of an [[accident]] or [[theft]]. 
 
 '''[[Book]]s''' might be registered to show the date when [[copyright]] protection starts. Usually this is done by sending a copy of the book to a special national [[library]]. 
    
 People who stay in a [[hotel]] register their names and addresses when they arrive. The hotel can work out how much the people must pay for their stay. The local [[police]] may also keep a copy of these names to help fight crime.
