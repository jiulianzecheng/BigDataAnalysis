A '''callus''' is an area of thick [[skin]] that forms due to [[pressure]], [[friction]] or [[irritation]]. Repeated contact is needed for them to form. Calluses are often found on one's [[feet]] because of walking and badly fitting [[shoe]]s. Though they may appear unsightly, calluses are not usually harmful. They can, however, lead to or cause other problems if neglected. 
 
 Calluses can also form on human [[hand]]s. In particular, the middle, ring and index fingers are prone to calluses. < ref > {{cite document|title=Corns and Calluses|publisher=The WebMD|url=https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-corns-calluses-basics|access-date=Oct 14, 2020}} < /ref >
