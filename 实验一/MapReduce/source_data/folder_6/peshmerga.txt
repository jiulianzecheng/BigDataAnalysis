 '''Peshmerga''' ({{lang-ckb|پێشمەرگە|translit=Pêşmerge|lit=Before death}}) are the [[Armed forces|military forces]] of the federal region of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

 The regular Iraqi army is forbidden to enter Iraqi Kurdistan, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-07/28/c_131745233.htm|title=Iraqi PM criticizes Kurdish region for barring army from Syrian border area|date=28 July 2012|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|access-date=13 February 2015}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://heevie.org/aboutkurdistan|title=Information about Kurdistan|date=2014|work=Kurdistan Development Organization|access-date=13 February 2015}} < /ref >   so Peshmerga forces are the only security forces in the area. 
 
 Formally the peshmerga are under the command of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]]'s Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs. In reality the peshmerga force itself is largely divided and controlled separately by the two regional political parties: [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|Democratic Party of Kurdistan]] and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]]. Unifying and integrating the peshmerga has been on the public agenda since 1992 but the forces remain divided due to factionalism which has proved to be a major stumbling block. < ref name= " CMEC " > {{cite journal|last1=van Wilgenburg|first1=Wladimir|last2=Fumerton|first2=Mario|title=Kurdistan's Political Armies: The Challenge of Unifying the Peshmerga Forces.|journal=Carnegie Middle East Center|date=16 December 2015|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/ACMR_WilgenburgFumerton_Kurdistan_English_final.pdf|access-date=12 February 2018}} < /ref >
