 A '''tile''' is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[stone]], [[porcelain]], metal or even [[glass]].  Tiles are generally used for covering [[roof]]s, [[floor]]s, < ref name= " Tileflooring " > {{cite web|title=Tile Flooring|url=https://dallasflooringwarehouse.com/tile-flooring/|accessdate=2017-02-06}} < /ref >  and [[wall]]s.  They have been made for thousands of years. 
 
 Tiles can be simple square tiles or arranged in complex [[mosaic]]s. Tiles are most often made from [[ceramic]], with a hard [[glaze]] finish. 
 
 At the end of the 20th century, the technology of [[porcelain]] and [[glass]] tiles advanced, making them cheaper.  They became more commonplace.

 Roof tiles are designed mainly to keep out [[rain]], and are traditionally made from locally available materials such as [[clay]] or [[slate]]. Modern materials such as [[concrete]] and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. 
 
 A large number of shapes (or  " profiles " ) of roof tiles have evolved. 
 
 Fired roof tiles are found as early as the 3rd millennium BC in the  ''[[House of the tiles]]'' in [[Lerna]], [[Greece]]. < ref name= " Joseph W. Shaw 59 " > Joseph W.
