 '''Gadolinium''' is a [[chemical element]].  It has the chemical symbol '''Gd'''.  It has the [[atomic number]] 64.  It is part of a group of chemical elements in the periodic table named the [[Lanthanides]].  It is a [[rare earth element]].  It is silvery white, [[malleable]] and [[wikt:ductile|ductile]]. 
 
 Its main uses are as [[chemical compounds]] in color [[television]]s and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[radio contrast agent]]s.  In color [[cathode ray tube]] televisions (the type first produced, not flat televisions) some of the [[pixel]]s are dots of gadolinium compounds. When the electrons from the cathode ray tube hit the  pixels and transfer [[energy]] to the gadolinium compounds they give out [[light]] as energy.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging is used in [[medicine]] where it is named MRI ([[Magnetic resonance imaging]]).  It is used to take picture of inside the [[body]].  How the pictures look is changed by the gadolinium compounds and how much [[water]] is around.  It makes the images clearer because it makes the difference in the [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] of water in different parts of the [[body]] look more clear (more [[contrast]]) in the picture that is made.
