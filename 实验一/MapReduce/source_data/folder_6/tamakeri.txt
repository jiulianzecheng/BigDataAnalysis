In tamakeri, there are two types of people: the [[Sadism|sadist]] and the [[Masochism|masochist]]. The sadist hits the man in the testicles, and the masochist is hit in the testicles. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/832/tamakeri|title=Kinkly explains Tamakeri|website=kinkly.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref >  The fetish is popular among straight and gay men and women. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.japanfortheuninvited.com/articles/tamakeri.html|title=Tamakeri|date=June 23, 2006|website=japanfortheuninvited.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref >  Since the Internet was created, the amount of people watching tamakeri pornography has gone up, with at least 1,269,105 people looking at popular websites. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ballbustingtube.com|title=ballbustingtube.com Traffic Statistics|date=2018-12-12|website=www.alexa.com|access-date=2018-12-12|archive-date=2018-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215060842/https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ballbustingtube.com|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ballbusting-guru.org|title=ballbusting-guru.org Traffic Statistics|date=2018-12-12|website=alexa.com|access-date=2018-12-12|archive-date=2018-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212224658/https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ballbusting-guru.org|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.siteworthtraffic.com/report/ballbustingtube.com|title=ballbustingtube.com Traffic Worth|date=2018-12-12|website=siteworthtraffic.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.siteworthtraffic.com/report/ballbusting-guru.org|title=ballbusting-guru.org Traffic Worth|date=2018-12-12|website=siteworthtraffic.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref >  In [[hentai]] communities, it can be called   " tamakeri " , or  " crotch_kick " . < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=wiki & s=view & id=17263|title=crotch_kick|last=-|first=Yavie|date=2015-07-31|website=gelbooru.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=wiki & s=view & id=4556|title=Tamakeri|last=-|first=surveyork|date=2015-03-01|website=gelbooru.com|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 
 === First wave (1990s–2001) === 
 The first tamakeri/ballbusting websites to show up on the internet were Velvet Kick, Tamahimeden, Spikey Step, Stardeck9, and Femaledom. Most of their videos had bad quality, didn't make money, had no stories, and had regular people with masks performing. 
 
 === Second wave (2002–2005) === 
 After the first websites came ones like British Bitches, Vuneraballs, M-Club-Q, Kinkeri.co.jp, USBBonline, Goddess-Kicks, Ballbusting Universe, and Ballbustingworld. These sites had better quality, more money, more content, stories, and known actors that didn't wear masks. Even though the majority of videos had known porn actors, many still decided to wear masks. 
 
 === Third and current wave (2006–present) === 
 The current tamakeri websites have videos made by normal people, paid actors, and videos taken at events. Because these new websites are larger, more people can post their own videos. Also, [[Chat room|chatrooms]] and forums allow people to discuss the fetish with others. Some examples of this latest tamakeri wave include ClubDom, Ballbustingtube, Ballbustingchicks, clips4sale, kickedinthegroin.ning.com, Scaffies.nl, Tamakeri.nl and ProtectUrNuts.com. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.protecturnuts.com/clips|title=Ballbusting Comedy Clips {{!}} Ballbusting Stories {{!}} PROTECT UR NUTS!|website=www.protecturnuts.com|access-date=2020-05-09}} < /ref > 
 
 == Cause == 
 People enjoy tamakeri because they either feel good feeling pain or making others feel it. The feeling is like a  " runner's high " , where feel-good [[Hormone|hormones]] called [[endorphins]] are sent out by the body. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/masochism|title=Masochism {{!}} psychosexual disorder|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref >  These endorphins make the people involved feel [[Sexual arousal|sexually aroused]]. But some people say that threats and more painful kicks or knees to the testicles by the female (in straight people) makes people more aroused. Belonging to a dominant boyfriend or girlfriend can also be a  " turn-on " . Like a lot of BDSM activities, it can be risky, and those involved can get hurt. < ref > {{Citation|last=Sydney Lee|title=Ballbusting 101|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1-gTAnrEps|access-date=2018-12-12}} < /ref >
