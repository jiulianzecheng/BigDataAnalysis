 '''''Hesperocallis''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s that includes a single species, '''''Hesperocallis undulata''''', the '''desert lily''', found in the desert areas of the southwest of North America. 
 
 ''Hesperocallis'' has traditionally been classified in [[Liliaceae]] but until recently its relationships have been unclear. Other classifications have included it in [[Hemerocallidaceae]] or [[Funkiaceae]].  In 1972, Hamilton Traub created the family Hesperocallidaceae with ''Hesperocallis'' as the sole included genus.  The [[APG II system]] includes it in the family [[Asparagaceae]] in the order [[Asparagales]] in the [[monocots]] clade but allows for the optional segregation of Hesperocallidaceae as a monophyletic family when several other families are likewise segregated.  Recent molecular systematic studies have confirmed a close relationship with ''[[Agave]]'' and its inclusion in family [[Agavaceae]] has been recommended (Pires et al. 2004).
