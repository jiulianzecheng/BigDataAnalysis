 The '''European spadefoot toads''' are a [[family (biology)|family]] of frogs, the '''Pelobatidae'''.  There is only one living [[genus]], called ''Pelobates''.  It has four species. They live in [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean]], northwestern [[Africa]] and western [[Asia]]. 
 
 The European spadefoot toads are small to large sized frogs.  They grow up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in length. They burrow in sandy soils. They have a hardened growth on their feet to help in digging. They will come out from the ground during times of rain and breed in pools, which are usually temporary. < ref name=EoR/ > 
 
 All of the species from this family have free-living, aquatic [[tadpole]]s. The eggs are laid in temporary ponds that may quickly [[evaporate]].  The tadpole stage is very short.  They grow to adult form in as little as two weeks. To further speed their growth, some of the tadpoles are [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]], eating their brood-mates to increase their supply of protein. < ref name=EoR > {{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G.  &  Zweifel, R.G.|author= Zweifel, Richard G.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn= 0-12-178560-2|page= [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofre0000unse_h2i0/page/88 88]}} < /ref >
