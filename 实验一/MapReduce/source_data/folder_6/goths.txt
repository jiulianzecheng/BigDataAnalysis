 The '''Goths''' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]: [[File:Gothic g.svg|14px|g]][[File:Gothic u.svg|14px|u]][[File:Gothic t.svg|14px|t]][[File:Gothic a.svg|14px|a]][[File:Gothic n.svg|14px|n]][[File:Gothic s.svg|14px|s]] < !--�df32�df3f�df44�df30�df3d�df43-- > , ''Gutans'') were an East Germanic tribe. They spoke the [[Gothic language]]. [[Jordanes]] was a scholar from the [[6th century]] who wrote a summary of a twelve volume work by [[Cassiodorus]] about the Goths. Jordanes work is commonly called [[Getica]]. The original work by Cassiodorius was lost, Getica is the only surviving contemporary account about the Goths. According to this book they left [[Scandinavia]] via [[Gotland]] and settled close to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river (in present day [[Poland]]). In the 3rd and 4th centuries they settled [[Scythia]], [[Dacia]] and parts of [[Moesia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, they fought with the [[Roman Empire]] and later adopted [[Arianism]] (a form of Christianity).  
 
 In the 4th and 5th centuries, they split into the [[Visigoths]] and the [[Ostrogoths]]. With this move, they established powerful successor-states of the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Italy]] and on the [[Iberian peninsula]] (now [[Spain]]  &  [[Portugal]]).  Traces of Gothic blood can be found in many people . < ref > Jordanes, ''Getica''. < /ref >
