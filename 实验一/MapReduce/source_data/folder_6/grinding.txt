 '''Grinding''' (also called '''freaking''' or '''freak dancing''') is a dance where two or more people rub or bump their bodies against one another. It became popular in night clubs. The dance then moved into [[high school]]s across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. 
 
 Schools have tried to ban grinding because it is very sexual. 
 
 A dance similar to grinding is  " The Bump " , which was popular in the 1970s. Another is [[twerking|the twerk]], which became popular through the 2000s into the 2010s.
