 A '''flipper''' is a special kind of [[limb]] that is flattened like a [[paddle]] for moving through [[water]]. Many [[animals]] that live in water, such as [[whale]]s and [[pinniped|seals]] have flippers. The flipper of a [[fish]] is called a [[fin]]. 
 
 It can also be an item worn on the [[foot]] to help people [[swim]] more easily.
