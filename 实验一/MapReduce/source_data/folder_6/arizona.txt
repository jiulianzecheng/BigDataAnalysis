The [[Barringer Crater]] (better known simply as “[[Meteor Crater]]”) is a huge hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau.  It is about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]]. A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises {{convert|150|ft|m}} above the level of the surrounding plain. The crater is nearly 1 & nbsp;mile (1.6 & nbsp;km) wide, and {{convert|570|ft|m}} deep. Meteor Crater is a popular tourist attraction. It is privately owned by the Barringer family through the Barringer Crater Company. There is an admission fee charged to see the crater.
