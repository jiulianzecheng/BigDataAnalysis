[[File:UK Roundabout 8 Cars.gif|thumb|250px|Movement within a roundabout in a country where traffic [[Right- and left-hand traffic|drives on the left]]. Note the [[clockwise]] circulation.]] 
 A '''roundabout''' (also known as a '''traffic island''') is a [[road]] circle joining three or more roads. [[Driver|Drivers]] follow a simple rule to avoid [[Traffic collision|crashes]].  
 
 In countries that drive on the left: 
 :At the island, give way to traffic coming from your right. 
 The driver goes round the island in a ''[[clockwise]]'' direction. 
 
 In countries that drive on the right: 
 :At the island, give way to traffic coming from your left. 
 The driver goes round the island in an ''[[anticlockwise]]'' direction. 
 
 == Types of circular intersections == 
 There are larger roundabouts that can have two to six lanes and can have traffic lights. These can sometimes be found at motorway junctions. 
 
 === Gyratory system === 
 The term  " gyratory "  (for example, [[Hanger Lane gyratory]]) is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for a larger roundabout with unusual features.
