A '''pottage''' is a thick soup or stew made with [[cereal]] and vegetable that is boiled or stewed in usually water or milk.  It was usually made with [[wheat]], [[barley]], or [[Oat|oats]].  This is what poor people ate in many countries in most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. Richer people would add meat.  The pot was kept on the fire and more things were added, so it kept changing.  < ref > How To Be A Tudor: A Dawn-to-Dusk Guide to Everyday Life, Ruth Goodman, Penguin Books, 2016, p. 142.  {{ISBN|9780241973714}} < /ref
