'''Technetium''' is a [[radioactive]] [[chemical element]] that has the chemical symbol '''Tc''' and has the [[atomic number]] 43. It is the lightest synthetic element. 
 
 == Chemistry of Technetium == 
 The color of technetium is silvery-grey and is a [[crystal]]ine metal. In chemistry it is placed in a group of metal elements named the [[transition metal]]s. The chemistry of technetium is similar to [[rhenium]] and [[manganese]]. 
 
 The isotope  < sup > 99m < /sup > Tc is used in [[nuclear medicine]]. It is used for many diagnostic tests. It has a short [[Half-life (element)|half-life]].  < sup > 99 < /sup > Tc is used as a source of [[Radioactive decay|beta particles]] without [[emit]]ting [[Radioactive decay|gamma rays]]. The ion that has [[oxygen]] and technetium [[chemical bond|bonded]] together (TcO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > ) is named the pertechnetate ion. The pertechnetate ion could be used as to prevent [[anodic]] [[corrosion]] in steel. 
 
 == History == 
 Before the element was found, many of the [[property|properties]] of element 43 were predicted by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. Mendeleev noticed a gap in his [[periodic table]] and named the element in the gap eka-manganese. In 1937 the technetium isotope  < sup > 97 < /sup > Tc was the first element to be [[wikt:artificial|artificially]] produced. This was the reason why he named it Technetium as in [[Greek language|Greek]], τεχνητος means  " artificial " . Most technetium made on Earth is a [[by-product]] of [[fission]] of [[uranium]]-235 in [[nuclear reactor]]s. It is extracted from [[nuclear fuel]] rods. On [[earth]], technetium occurs naturally only in uranium ores as a product of [[spontaneous fission]]. The amount of technetium in the ore is very small but has been [[measure]]d. The longest half-life of Technetium is 4.2 million years ( < sup > 98 < /sup > Tc). This means that its detection in [[red giants]] in 1952 helped support the [[theory]] that [[star]]s can produce heavier elements.
