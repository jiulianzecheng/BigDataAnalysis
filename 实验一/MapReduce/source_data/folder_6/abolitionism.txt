 '''Abolitionism''' was a movement that wanted to end the practice of [[slavery]] in [[Europe]] and in [[Americas|America]]. It was mainly active during the 18th and 19th centuries.  Until the 18th century, few people criticized slavery. But thinkers of the [[Enlightenment]] started to criticize it, because in their opinion slavery was against [[human rights]]. Communities like the [[Quakers]] thought that slavery was contradicting with [[Christianity]]. 
 
 In the early 19th century several countries abolished the transatlantic [[slave trade]], and later in the century they abolished slavery itself. 
 
 == Slavery in the Americas == 
 [[Race (sociology)|Race]]-based slavery was established in the early [[16th century]] in the Portuguese and [[Spanish Empire]] < nowiki/ > s. It soon spread to the parts of [[British North America]], [[New France]], and [[Spanish America]] that would become the U.S. in the [[18th century]]. By the beginning of the 18th century, enslavement of [[Black people|black]] [[Africa]]ns was powering the [[economy]] in these areas. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Indentured_Servants_in_Colonial_Virginia|title=Indentured Servants in Colonial Virginia|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-date=2018-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213120206/https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Indentured_Servants_in_Colonial_Virginia|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Most opposition to slavery was from enslaved people themselves. 
 
 During the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], beginning in 1775, the Virginia Governor, Lord Dunmore promised freedom to slaves and indenture servants  " able and willing to take up arms "  with the British.  This proclamation would give freedom to the indentured servants and slaves held by the rebelling colonists, and wouldn't effect the loyalists. Many of the former slaves would die of disease, in fact 8 times as many blacks died of disease than died in battle.  When the war ended, most slaves who decided to fight with the British were returned to servitude. < ref > {{Cite web

 The [[Continental Army|American Army]] of the revolution contained many blacks, most of them coming from New England.  The most significant black regiment was the 1st Rhode Island.

 Following drafting, and signing of the new [[United States Constitution]], blacks in the country were completely disenfranchised, and most remained slaves.  Slavery began to decline.
