A '''wage''' is [[money]] that is [[Payment|paid]] by an [[employer]] to an [[employee]] in exchange for [[Labour (economics)|work]]. The amount may be fixed for each task completed (this is called [[piece rate]]); or it may be based on [[time]] or other measurable [[quantity]] of work done. 
 
 Work for wages is the most common form of work. Because of this, the term  " wage "  sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment. However, a wage is different to a [[salary]] or [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]. A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive  " [[Tipping|tips]] "  paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as [[annual leave]] and [[sick leave]]. 
 
 Wages are usually paid by the [[hour]]. This is called an '''hourly wage'''. Wages paid by the day are still common. < ref > {{Cite journal | volume = 38 | pages = 56–97 | last = Thompson | first = E.
