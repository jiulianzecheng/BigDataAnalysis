 '''Symmetry''' is a [[property]] of certain [[geometry|geometrical]] objects that appears the same when [[reflection|reflected]] along an axis or when rotated around a point. The opposite of symmetry is [[asymmetry]], which refers to the absence of symmetry. 
 
 In reflectional symmetry, the axis of symmetry must cross the shape through the middle, dividing it into equal halves.  
 
 In rotational symmetry, the object is identical when it is rotated by a certain amount.  
 
 The precise notions of symmetry have various measures and operational definitions. For example, symmetry may be observed 
 *with respect to the passage of [[time]]; 
 *as a [[space|spatial relationship]]; 
 *through [[transformation]]s such as [[rotation]]; 
 *through other kinds of transformations; < ref > For example, operations such as moving across a regularly patterned tile floor or rotating an eight-sided [[vase]], or  in the way music is played. < /ref >   
 *as an aspect of [[scientific model|scientific models]], [[language]], [[music]] and even [[knowledge]] itself. < ref name= " Mainzer000 " > See, e.g., {{cite book
