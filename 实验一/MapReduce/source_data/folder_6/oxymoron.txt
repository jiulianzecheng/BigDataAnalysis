[[File:Anarcho-capitalist flag.svg|thumb|Anarcho-capitalists stand out from other anarchist ideologies because they are not anti-capitalist. Anarchists oppose capitalism for its centralist, undemocratic and exploitative structure. The state laid the foundation for capitalism by enabling private property through the enclosure acts, beginning in the 1600s.]] 
 An '''oxymoron'''  is a term for a [[figure of speech]]. < ref > [http://rhetoric.byu.edu  " Oxymoron "  at Rhetoric.byu.edu]; retrieved 2012-1-14. < /ref >    It is made up of two or more [[word]]s that seem to be opposite to each other, or actually are opposite. 
 
 For example, the phrases  " Wise fool " ,  " Warm freezer " ,  " Legal murder " , and  " Anarcho-capitalism "  all have two words. In each one, the one word looks like the opposite of the other word. 
 
 You can have words that look opposite, but are right. For example, a  " warm freezer "  could be right. A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open. 
 
 The word oxymoron is an oxymoron; 'oxy' comes from the Greek word that means 'sharp', while 'moron' comes from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word that means 'dull'. 
 
 Words that really are opposite to each other, would be words that just cannot be put together. For example, a  " round square "  could not happen because squares are not round. 
 
 Oxymorons sometimes appear in [[joke]]s. Sometimes, the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron. For example, a joke that says that  " glutted peasant "  is an oxymoron. This means that peasants are usually hungry, if the word 'peasant' is opposite to 'glutted'
