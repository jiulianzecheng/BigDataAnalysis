 '''Speed''' is a [[measure]]. 
 It is [[velocity]] but without the direction. < ref name= " columbia " / > < ref name= " britannica " / > < ref name= " phtb " / > < ref name= " difference " / > 
 
 == Finding speed == 
 Speed is the [[distance]] an [[wikt:object|object]] moves in a given amount of [[time]]. < ref name= " columbia " / > < ref name= " britannica " / > < ref name= " phtb " / > 
 The distance is never [[negative]]. < ref name= " dd " / > 
 If a train takes 1 hour to travel 100 kilometers, it has a speed of {{convert|100|kph|mph|sp=us}}. 
 In fact this is the ''average speed''. < ref name= " phtb " / > 
 During this one hour, the train may become slower and faster, it may even drive backwards. < ref name= " phtb " / > 
 The '''average speed''' of an object in a certain time is the distance the object traveled [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by the time. < ref name= " columbia " / > < ref name= " phtb " / > < ref name= " dd " / > 
 The '''instantaneous speed''' is the average speed when the time is very small, almost [[zero]]. < ref name= " phtb " / > 
 
 == Units == 
 There are many [[Unit of measurement|units of measurement]]. 
 Since the 20th century following units were widely used by humans: 
 
 * [[miles]] per [[hour]] (mph), 
 * [[kilometre|kilometers]] per hour (km/h), and 
 * [[metre|meters]] per [[second]] (m/s), which is the [[SI|SI-unit]] for speed. 
 
 Different units are used for different applications. 
 People controlling planes and ships frequently use [[Knot (speed)]]. < ref name= " phtb " / > 
 Sometimes a [[Mach number]] is used. 
 
 == Range == 
 The smallest speed is {{convert|0|m/s|kph mph|sp=us}}. 
 A “negative speed” would be in fact a velocity. 
 The biggest speed is the [[speed of light]]. < ref name= " sw_sol " / > 
 You can write bigger speeds, but they are not possible in this universe.
