 '''Femininity''' is a set of attributes, [[behavior]]s, and [[role]]s generally associated with [[female]]s. Femininity is made up of both socially defined and biologically created factors. This makes it distinct from the simple definition of the biological female sex, as women, men, and [[transgender]] people can all exhibit feminine [[trait]]s. 
 
 The [[colour]] [[pink]] is associated with femininity. 
 
 Femininity is also exhibited through certain natural instincts and biological traits like the broadening of the hips in females to support the baby in the womb during [[pregnancy]] and while [[reproduction]], development of [[Breast|breasts]] and high pitched [[voice]] are the most common and evident in [[Human|human beings.]]
