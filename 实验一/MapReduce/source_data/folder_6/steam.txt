 '''Steam''' is the name given to [[water]] when it is in a [[gas]] form.  Steam is sometimes thought of as a cloud of translucent mist, however that is only the result of the steam [[Condensation|condensing]] in the air, forming [[water vapor]].  Actual hot steam is invisible.  
 
 When the [[pressure]] of the [[atmosphere]] is 1013 m[[bar (unit)|bar]] (this is about the average pressure for a place which is at [[sea level]]), water will [[Boiling|boil]] (turn into steam) at 100 degrees [[Celsius]].  This is the [[boiling point]].  Boiling happens in a [[boiler]]. 100 degrees [[Celsius]] is the same [[temperature]] as 212 degrees [[Fahrenheit]], 80 degrees [[RÃ©aumur]] and 373.15 [[Kelvin]]. 
 
 A major use of steam is to power [[steam engine]]s. A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. 
 
 ==Heating food== 
 Steam gets sometimes used for heating food. In a [[pressure cooker]], some water turns into steam, and some steam gets [[release]]d (or let out) thru a [[valve]]. 
 
 There are other ways to steam food.
