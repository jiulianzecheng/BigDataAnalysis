 A '''mycorrhiza''' (Greek for ''fungus roots'') is a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association between a [[fungus]] and the [[root]]s of a [[plant]]. < ref > Kirk P.M. ''et al'' 2001.

 In a mycorrhiza, the fungus lives inside the plant roots, and in the earth. The fungal [[hypha]]e are more [[efficiency|efficient]] than plant roots at absorbing [[nutrient]]s. < ref name=Trappe1987/ > 
 
 Mycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many [[ecosystem]]s. At least 80% of all land plant [[species]] (and over 90% of [[Family (biology)|families]]) have mycorrhiza. < ref name=Wang > Wang B. and Qiu Y-L 2006.

 Mycorrhizas are divided onto two main types: '''ectomycorrhiza''' and '''endomycorrhiza'''.   
 The hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate < ref > push into, but do not penetrate. < /ref >  the cell membrane.  
 
 The mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, dating to at least 400 million years ago. < ref name= " Remy " > {{cite journal|author=Remy W, Taylor TN, Hass H, Kerp H. |year=1994|title= 4-hundred million year old vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA|volume=91|issue=25|pages=11841–43|pmid=11607500|doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.25.11841|pmc=45331|doi-access=free}} < /ref > 
 
 '''Wood Wide Web''' is a term used for mycorrhizal networks in forests. 
 
 == How it works == 
 This [[mutualism]] gives the fungus [[sugar]]s, such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]] produced by the plant in [[photosynthesis]]. < ref name= " Harrison MJ. " > {{cite journal|author=Harrison MJ|year= 2005|title=Signaling in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-microbiology_2005_59/page/19|journal=Annu Rev Microbiol.|volume=59|pages=19–42|pmid=16153162 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123749}} < /ref >   
 The carbohydrates move from their source (usually leaves) to the root and then to the fungal partner. In return, the plant gains the use of the [[mycelium]]'s very large surface area to absorb water and [[mineral]] [[nutrient]]s from the soil, especially [[phosphorus]]. < ref name=Selosse > {{cite journal|author=Selosse M.A. ''et al'' 2006. |title=Mycorrhizal networks: des liaisons dangereuses?|journal=Trends Ecol Evol.|year=2006|volume=21|issue=11|pages=621–628|pmid=16843567 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2006.07.003}} < /ref > 
    
 The mechanisms of increased [[absorption]] are both [[Matter|physical]] and [[chemical]]. Mycorrhizal [[mycelium|mycelia]] are much smaller in [[diameter]] than the smallest root. They can explore a greater [[volume]] of soil, providing a larger [[surface area]] for absorption:  " It is estimated that every kilogram of soil contains at least 200 km of fungi strands " . < ref name=planet/ > < ref > S. Bonneville ''et al.'' 2009. Plant-driven fungal weathering: early stages of mineral alteration at the nanometer scale. ''Geology''  '''37''', 615-618 < /ref > 
 
 == Advantages == 
 Mycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to [[disease]]s, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne [[pathogen]]s, and are also more resistant to the effects of [[drought]]. These effects are perhaps due to the improved water and mineral uptake in mycorrhizal plants.  
 
 Mycorrhiza is especially advantageous to the plant in nutrient-poor soils. Plants grown in sterile [[soil]]s and [[growth medium|growth media]] often perform poorly without the addition of [[spore]]s or [[hyphae]] of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients. < ref name=planet > Root fungi turn rock into soil ''[http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=470 Planet Earth Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713022313/http://planetearth.nerc.ac.uk/news/story.aspx?id=470 |date=2009-07-13 }}'' 3 July 2009 < /ref >  The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in harsh areas. < ref name= " Jeffries " > {{cite journal|author=Jeffries P. ''et al'' 2003. |title= The contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in sustainable maintenance of plant health and soil fertility|journal=Biol. Fertility Soils|year= 2003|volume=37|pages=1–16|doi= 10.1007/s00374-002-0546-5|s2cid= 20792333|id=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=14498927}} < /ref > 
 
 The fungal partners may also help plant-to-plant transfer of sugars and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called ''common mycorrhizal networks''. < ref name=Selosse/ > < ref > Kennedy, Peter 2005. Common mycorrhizal networks. [http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/MycorrhizalNetworks.html] < /ref >   
 Some species live inside the tissues of roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called ''endophytes''. < ref name= " Schulz  &  Boyle " > {{cite journal|author=Schulz B  &  Boyle C. 2005. |title=The endophytic continuum |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_mycological-research_2005-06_109_6/page/661 |journal=Mycological Research |year=2005 |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=661–86 | pmid=16080390|doi=10.1017/S095375620500273X}} < /ref >   
 Similar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both partners. < ref > Endophyte: here, a more general term for fungi living in plants. < /ref >  Endophytes of grasses give their host more resistance to grazers and get food and shelter from the plant in return. < ref name= " Clay  &  Schardl " > {{cite journal|author=Clay K, Schardl C.|year= 2002|title=Evolutionary origins and ecological consequences of endophyte symbiosis with grasses|journal=American Naturalist|volume=160 Suppl 4|pages=S99–S127|pmid=18707456|doi=10.1086/342161|s2cid= 23909652}} < /ref > 
 
 == Bacteria in mycorrhiza == 
 Mycorrhizal roots offer excellent ecological niches for other microbes. Mycorrhizal fungi may host [[bacteria]] that complete their life cycles within fungal cells. One of the best known is ''Geosiphon pyriforme'', which can host [[cyanobacteria]] inside characteristic bladders. < ref > Schüssler A.  &  Kluge M. 2001. ''Geosiphon pyriforme'', an endocytosymbiosis between fungus and cyanobacteria, and its meaning as a model system for arbuscular mycorrhizal research. In Hock B. (ed) ''Mycota IX: Fungal Associations''. Springer, Berlin. 151–161 < /ref > 
 Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi are unique in hosting bacteria in their [[cytoplasm]]. Intracellular structures very similar to bacteria were first described in the 1970s. Research later identified them as true bacteria. < ref > Bianciotto V. ''et al.'' 1996. An obligately endosymbiotic fungus itself harbors obligately intracellular bacteria. ''Appl. Environ. Microbiol''. '''62''', 3005–3010. < /ref >
