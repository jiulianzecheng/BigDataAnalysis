 '''Exeter''' is a [[city]] in [[South West England]] on the River Exe, from which it takes its name. It is the [[county town]] of [[Devon]]. Just over 100,000 live there. In the city are a ruined [[castle]], much of the old [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[city wall]], and [[Exeter Cathedral]]. 
 ==History== 
 Exeter was built by the Romans, who called it ''Isca Dumnoniorum'' (Isca of the Dumnonii, the local British tribe). After the Romans left and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] moved into the area in the seventh century, the name changed to Exeter. In the 1060s, Exeter was a centre of [[resistance]] to the [[Norman conquest]]. 
 
 In 1050, the Bishop of Crediton moved to Exeter; from then until [[1876]] the [[bishop]]s were the heads of the [[church]] in the whole of Devon and Cornwall. Now, only Devon is within the Exeter diocese. 
 ==Today== 
 Today it is home to the [[Meteorological Office]], which forecasts the country's [[weather]].
