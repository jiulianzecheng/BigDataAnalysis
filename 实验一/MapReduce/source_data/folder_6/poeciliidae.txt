 The '''Poeciliidae''' are a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[fish]] of the order [[Cyprinodontiformes]], the tooth-carps.  They live in fresh water.  Many [[live-bearing aquarium fish]], such as the [[guppy]], [[Poecilia|molly]], [[Platy (fish)|platy]], and [[Green swordtail|swordtail]] are in Poeciliidae. These fish are from the [[United States]] to north of [[Río de la Plata]], [[Argentina]], and Africa, including [[Madagascar]]. Human beings took these fish to many other parts of the world and set them free there, so they have become [[invasive species]].  Today, poeciliid fish live in all tropical and subtropical parts of planet Earth. People have seen fish in the genuses ''Poecilia'' and ''Gambusia'' in [[hot spring]] pools as far north as [[Banff, Alberta]] in [[Canada]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://srd.alberta.ca/FishWildlife/FisheriesManagement/documents/CostsAndThreatsOfInvasiveSpeciesInAlberta-Mar-04.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063453/http://srd.alberta.ca/FishWildlife/FisheriesManagement/documents/CostsAndThreatsOfInvasiveSpeciesInAlberta-Mar-04.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-09 }} < /ref > 
 
 == Live-bearing == 
 Although all fish in Poeciliidae are called  " live bearers "  ([[viviparity|viviparous]]), some species do lay eggs with external fertilization.  All African fish in Poeciliidae lay eggs.  Almost all the American Poeciliidae bear live young (except for fish in the genus ''[[Tomeurus]]''). 
 
 Poeciliidae has three subfamilies. The fish in subfamily Aplocheilichthyinae live only in Africa. Most Poeciliinae live in the Americas (except for ''[[Rhexipanchax]]'', which lives in Africa). Most fish in Procatopodinae live in Africa (''[[Fluviphylax]]'' and ''[[Pseudopoecilia]]'' live in South America). Scientists say this means the ancestors of Poeciliidae fish the split between Africa and South America 100 million years ago, and that fish that went to South America evolved to bear live young after they got there. Poeciliids came to North America through the [[Antilles]].  They were able to do this because the Antilles and North America were connected 44 million years ago. Poeciliids then moved to Central America by the [[Caribbean Plate#First American land bridge|Aves land bridge]] on the [[Caribbean Plate]]. When South America connected to Central America three million years ago, some of the fish moved further south, but South American species did not move north into Central America. < ref > Hrbek, T., J. Seekinger, and A. Meyer. 2007. A phylogenetic and biogeographic perspective on the evolution of poeciliid fishes. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''43''':986-998. < /ref > 
 
 The live-bearing species fish can be different from each other depending on how much the mother fish does for the developing larvae. Many fish in the family Poeciliidae are [[lecithotrophic]] (the mother provisions the [[oocyte]] with all the resources it needs prior to fertilization, so the egg is independent of the mother), but others are [[matrotrophy|matrotrophic]] ( " mother feeding " : the mother provides the majority of resources to the developing offspring after fertilization). Lecithotrophy and matrotrophy are not always completely separate. Most scientific studies use a matrotrophy index (MI) to say how matrotrophic an animal is. This uses the dry mass of fully developed offspring (how much they weigh when they are not wet) divided by the dry mass of a fertilized egg. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Kwan|first1=Lucia|last2=Fris|first2=Megan|last3=Rodd|first3=F.

 Fish in the genus ''[[Poeciliopsis]]'', for example, have many different adaptations. ''[[Poeciliopsis monacha]]'', ''[[Poeciliopsis lucida|P. lucida]]'', and ''[[Poeciliopsis prolifica|P. prolifica]]'' are part of the same [[clade|group]] in that genus. However, they have three different ways of helping baby fish: ''P. monacha'' is lecithotrophic because it does not give its babies any resources after fertilization.  The mother fish swims around with her eggs in a sac but that is all. ''P. lucida'' shows a middle level of [[matrotrophy]]. This means that the eggs's metabolism can change the mother's metabolism, so some food chemicals go back and forth. ''P. prolifica'' is very matrotrophic.  The mother fish gives the eggs almost all of the food chemicals they need after fertilization. This level of matrotrophy allows ''Poeciliopsis'' to carry several groups of eggs that were start at different times.  This is called [[superfetation]]. 
 
 Because the mother fish only has so much space in her body for developing embryos, viviparity reduces brood size. Superfetation can compensate for this loss by keeping embryos at various stages and sizes during development. < ref > Thibault, R. E., and R. J. Schultz. 1978. Reproductive adaptations among viviparous fishes (Cyprinodontiformes Poeciliidae). Evolution 32:320-333. < /ref > 
 
 ''[[Poeciliopsis elongata|P. elongata]]'', ''[[Poeciliopsis turneri|P. turneri]]'', and ''[[Poeciliopsis presidionis|P. presidionis]]'' form an [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] to the ''P. monacha'', ''P.lucida'', and ''P. prolifica'' group. These three fish are very matrotrophic. In 1947, C. L. Turner said the follicular cells of ''P. turneri'' were  " pseudo-placenta, pseudo-chorion, and pseudo-allantois. " {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The greater degree of matrotrophy in a species is linked with a higher degree of placentation, including  " a thicker maternal follicle, higher degree of vascularization, and greater number of villi in the placenta.

 Scientists argue about why Poeciliid fish developed to give their young eggs food chemicals inside their bodies.  There are two groups of ideas, adaptive [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] and conflict hypotheses. < ref name= " :1 " > {{Cite journal|last1=Furness|first1=Andrew I.|last2=Avise|first2=John C.|last3=Pollux|first3=Bart J.A.|last4=Reynoso|first4=Yuridia|last5=Reznick|first5=David N.|date=May 2021|title=The evolution of the placenta in poeciliid fishes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.02.008|journal=Current Biology|volume=31|issue=9|pages=2004–2011.e5|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2021.02.008|pmid=33657405|s2cid=232093911|issn=0960-9822}} < /ref >  Adaptive ideas, including the [[locomotor hypothesis]], < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Thibault|first1=Roger E.|last2=Schultz|first2=R.
