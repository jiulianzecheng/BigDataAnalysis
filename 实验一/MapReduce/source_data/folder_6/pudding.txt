 '''Pudding''' is a popular [[dessert]] and [[snack]]. It tastes sweet, and comes in many flavors. The most common kind of pudding is [[chocolate]]. Some other kinds are [[vanilla]], [[butterscotch]], [[banana]], and [[pistachio]]. Most pudding today is made out of [[milk]], [[sugar]], flavoring, and [[flour]]. [[Egg (food)|Eggs]] can be used, too. If you do not want to make the pudding, you do not have to. The grocery store sells pudding that is already made.

 In [[Britain]], the word  " pudding "  is often used for any dessert, especially a dessert made with [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and cooked by steaming, boiling or baking, e.g. [[treacle]] pudding, chocolate pudding or Spotted Dick (pudding with [[raisin|raisins]] or [[currant|currants]]).  There are also [[milk]] puddings such as [[rice]] pudding or semolina. 
 
 Confusingly,  " [[steak]] and [[kidney]] pudding "  is a [[:wikt:savoury|savoury]] dish, similar to  " steak and kidney pie "  but with a softer [[pastry]].
