 '''Hula''' is a type of [[dance|dancing]] from [[Hawaii]]. 
 
 Hula is a word in the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] language.  Male [[dancer]]s and female dancers can both dance hula. A long time ago, hula dance was used only in special ceremonies. Now, hula dance is mainly for entertainment.

 Traditionally, the hula dancer dances to a chant (a poem that is sung to a rhythm). The chanter beats his or her hand on a gourd (dried, empty squash) to create the rhythm. 
 
 There are many kinds of hula dance. For example, the Hawaiian hula dance style is slow and the Tahitian hula dance style is fast.
