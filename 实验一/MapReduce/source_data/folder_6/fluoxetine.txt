 '''Fluoxetine hydrochloride''', also known by its trade name '''Prozac''', is an [[antidepressant]] [[medication]]. It is used to treat a variety of mental illnesses, including [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[panic disorder]], and others. Fluoxetine is one of a group of antidepressants called [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs). 
 
 There are newer drugs available to treat these conditions. Nevertheless, fluoxetine remains very popular. Over 23.1 million prescriptions were filled in the [[United States]] in 2006. This makes it the third most prescribed antidepressant. < ref > After [[sertraline]] and [[escitalopram]], see: {{PDFlink|[http://www.drugtopics.com/drugtopics/data/articlestandard/drugtopics/092007/407652/article.pdf Top 200 Generic Drugs by Units in 2006]|19.4 & nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] < !-- application/pdf, 19902 bytes -- > }}.
