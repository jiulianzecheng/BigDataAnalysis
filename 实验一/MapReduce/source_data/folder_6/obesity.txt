 '''Obesity''' is the condition of being much too heavy for one's height so that one's health is affected. In other words, it means to be too [[overweight]]. Also known as being fat. It is considered a [[disease]] and has been described as an [[epidemic]] and a form of [[suicide]]. 
 
 To know if a person is overweight, the [[body mass index]] (BMI) is calculated, by dividing the person's weight (in kilograms), by their height (in metres) squared (multiplied by itself). (This is only meaningful for [[adult]]s who are fully grown, and should not be used for [[child]]ren. Growth charts can be used to measure obesity in children.) 
 
 A BMI between 18.5 and 25 is considered ''normal''. People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight; with 30 and above, they are considered obese, and with 35 and above, they are considered ''severely obese'' (this used to be called ''morbidly obese''). In general, the BMI number is a good quantifiable measurement of a person's obesity. However, it is a poor predictor in people who are very athletic, because a person with a higher than average amount of muscle tissue will weigh more than an average person, thus resulting in a BMI that is higher than normal, even if that person is very large. 
 
 ==Causes== 
 [[File:Fatmouse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Two white mice both with similar sized ears, black eyes, and pink noses. The body of the mouse on the left, however, is about three times the width of the normal sized mouse on the right.|Two mice: one on left not able to produce [[leptin]] in his body and becomes obese; and a normal mouse (right)]] 
 The most common cause for obesity is eating more [[calorie]]s than are used by the body. Other factors that often contribute to obesity are: 
 * Poor [[nutrition]] 
 * [[Hormone|Hormonal problems]] (for example, caused by [[hypothyroidism]]) 
 * Problems with the [[metabolism]], e.g. [[weight cycling]] (the so-called ''yo-yo effect'') 
 * [[Eating disorder]]s (for example, [[binge eating disorder]]) 
 * Psychological problems, like [[Clinical depression|depression]] 
 * Lack of sleep or sleeping problems 
 * Lack of exercise 
 
 Genetics are known to contribute to obesity. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10761527|title=Genetics of obesity: towards the understanding of a complex syndrome|first1=P.|last1=Froguel|first2=B.|last2=Guy-Grand|first3=K.|last3=Clément|date=18 March 2000|journal=Presse Med|volume=29|issue=10|pages=564–571|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=PubMed|pmid=10761527}} < /ref >  Low levels of [[leptin]], a hormone, is linked to obesity. 
 
 ==Health issues== 
 Many health problems are associated with obesity. An example is [[Type 2 diabetes]]. A woman with a BMI higher than 35 is 93 times more likely to develop diabetes. < ref > Jung, 1997 < /ref >  A 2009 review found that people with a BMI between 40 and 50 were 22.5 times more likely to die from diabetes than people with BMIs between 22.5 and 25. < ref > Lancet 2009 < /ref > 
 
 An obese woman is more likely to have an unhealthy baby. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cen.12055/abstract|title=The risk of maternal obesity to the long-term health of the offspring|first1=James R.|last1=O'Reilly|first2=Rebecca M.|last2=Reynolds|date=1 January 2013|journal=Clin Endocrinol|volume=78|issue=1|pages=9–16|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1111/cen.12055|pmid=23009645|s2cid=45254082}} < /ref > 
 
 Risk is associated with where the excess fat is stored on the body. [[Abdominal obesity]] is particularly dangerous. 
 
 Some people think that the idea that obesity causes bad health is not completely true and has been exaggerated. An example is J. Eric Oliver. He wrote a book called ''Fat Politics: The Real Story Behind America's Obesity Epidemic''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/060105/fat.shtml|title=Oliver argues health risk of being obese exaggerated|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2017}} < /ref >  There is evidence for this belief. 
 The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] said in 2003 that 400,000 people died because of being obese in 2000. Then in 2004 they said that the number was wrong. A 2013 review of scientific papers found that Grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-34.9) is not associated with increased deaths. Grades 2 (BMI 35-39.9) and 3 (40+) obesity are associated with much higher rates of death. It has been suggested that obesity is associated with mortality (death) because of mortality in Grade 2 and 3 obesity. People with grade 2 and 3 obesity are 29% more likely to die. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1555137|title=Association of All-Cause Mortality With Overweight and Obesity Using Standard Body Mass Index Categories: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis|first1=Katherine M.|last1=Flegal|first2=Brian K.|last2=Kit|first3=Heather|last3=Orpana|first4=Barry I.|last4=Graubard|date=2 January 2013|journal=JAMA|volume=309|issue=1|pages=71–82|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=jama.jamanetwork.com|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.113905|pmid=23280227|pmc=4855514}} < /ref > 
 
 'Metabolically healthy obesity' is increasingly being recognized. Up to 40% of obese people are metabolically healthy. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/being-big-isn%E2%80%99t-always-bad|title=Being big isn't always bad|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2017}} < /ref >  They are not more likely to get heart disease or die than metabolically healthy non-obese people. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/775395|title=Medscape Log In|publisher=|accessdate=11 March 2017}} < /ref > 
 
 The 'obesity paradox' is a term used to describe how obesity can lower the risk of death. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/6/1195|title=The obesity paradox in the US population|first=James A.|last=Greenberg|date=1 June 2013|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1195–1200|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=ajcn.nutrition.org|doi=10.3945/ajcn.112.045815|pmid=23636238}} < /ref >  Obesity increases the chance of getting heart disease.

 ==Treatment== 
 Scientists have not yet found a 'cure' for obesity that most people are willing to implement. It is common wisdom that people who lose weight will regain it all within 5 years. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/74/5/579|title=Long-term weight-loss maintenance: a meta-analysis of US studies|first1=James W.|last1=Anderson|first2=Elizabeth C.|last2=Konz|first3=Robert C.|last3=Frederich|first4=Constance L.|last4=Wood|date=1 November 2001|journal=Am J Clin Nutr|volume=74|issue=5|pages=579–584|doi=10.1093/ajcn/74.5.579|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=ajcn.nutrition.org|pmid=11684524}} < /ref > 
 However, this position has been scientifically challenged for over a decade. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/25/health/95-regain-lost-weight-or-do-they.html|title=95% Regain Lost Weight. Or Do They?|date=25 May 1999|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 March 2017}} < /ref >  Additionally, modern research has achieved significantly higher success rates than the figure that dominates the popular internet. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online & aid=1789920 & fileId=S0007114507862416|title=Weight-loss maintenance 1, 2 and 5 years after successful completion of a weight-loss programme|first1=Michael R.|last1=Lowe|first2=Tanja V.

 [[Surgery]] can be used to treat obesity. [[Gastric bypass surgery|Gastric bypass]] is the most common weight loss surgery. It makes a person's stomach smaller so that they feel full after eating less food and causes their body to absorb less calories. People who have surgery are usually very obese. In Britain there are long waiting lists for this. It is very easy to get this surgery in [[Turkey]]. Seven Britons have died after having weight loss surgery there since 2019 and many more have had serious problems. < ref > {{Cite news|date=2023-03-21|title=Warnings against 'reckless' weight loss surgery abroad|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64515557|access-date=2023-03-21}} < /ref > 
 
 Some people think that obesity should not be treated at all. This position is contradicted by substantial medical research. < ref name= " doi.org " / > 
 Weight loss medicines can make people want to eat less or make less of the energy from food be absorbed by their bodies. The only weight loss drug approved by the FDA for long term use is orlistat. The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] has not approved other drugs because they have side effects. Also they are worried that people who are not obese will take them. 
 
 ==Societal views== 
 In the West, people associate obesity with negative characteristics such as laziness, ugliness, stupidity, etc. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1381/096089296765556520|title=Obesity: The Last Bastion of Prejudice|first=Sahale A.|last=Flanagan|date=1 October 1996|journal=Obes Surg|volume=6|issue=5|pages=430–437|accessdate=11 March 2017|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1381/096089296765556520|pmid=10729890|s2cid=45883636}} < /ref >  Discriminating against someone because of their weight is legal in the [[United States]]. The [[fat acceptance movement]] says that this is wrong and is a kind of [[prejudice]] called [[fatphobia]]. In some [[culture]]s, obesity is viewed as positive. To those cultures, obesity is associated with wealth, beauty, and fertility.
