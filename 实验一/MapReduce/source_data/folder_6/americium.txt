'''Americium''' is a [[radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Am''' and the [[atomic number]] 95. In chemistry, it is placed in a group of metal elements named the [[actinides]]. Americium is a [[Transuranium element|transuranic element]] (Transuranic means after uranium as all the elements used after uranium are man-made). Americium does not exist in nature and has to be made by people. It has a silver color. Americium is made by [[bombardment|bombarding]] a [[plutonium]] [[wikt:target|target]] with [[neutron]]s. 
 
 It was the fourth transuranic element to be [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]]. It was named for [[Americas|America]], like [[Francium]] was named for [[France]]. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Kostecka|first=Keith|date=2008|title=Americium – From Discovery to the Smoke Detector and Beyond|url=http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p89-93.pdf|url-status=live|journal=Bull.

 The longest [[Half-life (element)|half life]] of any type of americium is 7370 years. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Americium Video - The Periodic Table of Videos - University of Nottingham|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/095.htm|access-date=2022-04-19|website=www.periodicvideos.com}} < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 Americium is used in most [[smoke detector]]s. The level of radioactivity is not enough to cause [[cancer]], so it is safe to live in a place where smoke detectors with americium are used.
