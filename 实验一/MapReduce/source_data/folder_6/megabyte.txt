A '''megabyte''' ('''MB''') is a large number used when talking about [[hard disk|hard drives]] or [[computer memory]]. One megabyte is 1 million [[byte]]s or 1 thousand [[kilobyte]]s. 
 
 Until December 1998, when the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) first defined a [[mebibyte]] as 2 < sup > 20 < /sup > , or 1,048,576 bytes, ''megabyte'' also meant either 1,048,576 bytes, or 1,024,000 bytes.  Casual computer users still often use megabyte to mean one of these numbers. 
 
 One thousand megabytes make one [[gigabyte]]. 
 
 This definition is part of the International System of Quantities.
