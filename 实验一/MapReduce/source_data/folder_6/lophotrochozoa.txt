 The '''Lophotrochozoa''' ( " crest-bearing animals " ) are a group of animals above the level of [[phylum]]. It is not part of the usual system of [[classification]]. They were recently discovered through [[Sequence analysis|molecular phylogeny]]. < ref > Philippe, Hervé, Nicolas Lartillot1 and Henner Brinkmann. 2005. Multigene Analyses of Bilaterian Animals Corroborate the Monophyly of Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa, and Protostomia. ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'' '''22'''(5):1246-1253; {{doi|10.1093/molbev/msi111}}. < /ref >  They include two of the most successful animal phyla, the [[Mollusc]]a and [[Annelid]]a.  
 
 == Groups == 
 The Lophotrochozoa comprise two groups, the [[trochozoa]]ns and the [[Lophophorata]]. The exact relationships between the different phyla are not entirely certain.  However, it seems that neither the lophophorates nor the trochozoa are [[monophyletic]] groups by themselves, but are mixed together. < ref name=ucmp/ > 
 
 * Trochozoans produce [[trochophore]] [[larva]]e, which have two bands of [[cilium|cilia]] around their middle. < ref name=ucmp > [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/phyla/lophotrochozoa.html Introduction to the Lophotrochozoa] - accessed 8 August 2008 < /ref >  The Trochozoa include the [[Nemertea]], [[Mollusca]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Echiura]] and [[Annelida]]. < ref name=ucmp/ > 
 
 * The Lophophorata are united by the presence of a [[lophophore]], a fan of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth. Some authors considered them [[deuterostome]]s, before [[RNA]] trees placed them together with the trochozoans. The Lophophorata include the [[Bryozoa]], [[Phoronida]], and [[Brachiopoda]]. < ref name=ucmp/ > 
 
 Other phyla are included on the basis of molecular data.
