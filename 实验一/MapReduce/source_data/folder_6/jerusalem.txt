It is important to many major religions. [[Jews]] consider Jerusalem a [[holy]] city because it was their religious and political center during [[Bible|Biblical]] times and was the place where the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of God stood]]. [[Christian]]s consider Jerusalem holy because many events in the life of [[Jesus]] took place there. [[Muslim]]s believe that [[Muhammad]] rose to heaven from Jerusalem, and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] is the first [[Qibla]] of Muslims after Mecca. 
 
 Jerusalem is the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of [[Israel]], under it's laws. Most other countries disagree. {{efn|Jerusalem is the capital of Israel under [[Jerusalem Law|Israeli law]].

 Jerusalem is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is a [[hill]]y city with many [[valley]]s around it. 
 
 == History == 
 Jerusalem is a very old city. It has great importance for three [[religion]]s: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Bible]] says King [[David]], the second king of [[Israel]], took this city from [[Paganism|pagans]] and settled his palace there. King [[Solomon]], David's son and the next king, built the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]] in Jerusalem. Later, as capital of [[Judah]], Jerusalem was destroyed by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], the king of [[Babylon]]. The Palace of King David and the Temple of Solomon were burned, and the [[Jews]] were captured and taken to Babylon. Seventy years later, the Persian King [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] allowed them to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple. 
 
 Later the area was [[Occupied territory|occupied]] by [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. King [[Herod the Great]], who ruled for the Roman Emperor, made the Temple larger to try and win Jewish favor. The Temple was famous for its greatness and beauty. 
 
 Jesus died in Jerusalem around [[33]] [[Common Era|CE]]. In [[70]] CE, the Jews [[Rebellion|rebelled]] against the Romans, but the Romans destroyed the city and the Temple. Jewish people who lived in Jerusalem were caught and became [[Slavery|slaves]]. The Romans renamed Jerusalem with a [[Latin]] name. Since then, the Temple has not been rebuilt, and only a part of its wall remains until today. 
 
 After the Roman Empire was split into two, the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled Jerusalem. Later, Muslims took over the city from them. The Muslims believed [[Muhammad]] went to [[heaven]] from Jerusalem. 
 
 Later, the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]] sent the [[Crusade]]rs from Western Europe to try and take Jerusalem back. They succeeded for a while, but eventually the city fell again to the [[Castelsarrasin|Saracens]]. Until the [[20th century]], Jerusalem was a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There were some Jews in Jerusalem all along, even though they were ruled by other people. 
 
 The  " New City "  of Jerusalem is the part outside the old stone walls. People started building the new city in the 1800s. Mishkenot Sha'annanim, Mea Shearim, and the Bukharan Quarter are some of the first neighborhoods in the new city. 
 
 After [[World War I]], the Ottoman Empire had been defeated. In June 1922, the [[League of Nations]] approved the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]. This gave control of the area to the [[United Kingdom]]. The land west of the Jordan River was known as [[Palestine]]. It was under direct British control until 1948. The land east of the Jordan River was known as Transjordan, and was governed by the Hashemite family. Transjordan gained independence in 1946. 
 
 The mandate in Palestine ended at midnight on 14 May 1948. On the next day, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War began. Israel declared independence, the West Bank was annexed by Jordan, and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip. 
 
 In 1949, at the end of the first [[1948 Palestine War|Arab-Israeli War]], Jerusalem was divided between Israel and [[Jordan]].  Israel controlled the western part of the city. Jordan controlled the eastern section, including the [[Old City of Jerusalem|Old City]], a walled section of Jerusalem dating from Biblical times. Israel took control of the entire city during the [[Six-Day War]] in [[1967]]. 
 
 Jerusalem today is claimed by the state of Israeli as its [[Capital (city)|capital]]. The [[United Nation]]s does not agree to Israel saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. 
 
 == Religious significance == 
 [[File:Jerusalem Kotel night 9082.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Western Wall]], known as the Kotel]] 
 [[File:Al-aqsa-mosque01 cropped.JPG|thumb|right|The [[al-Aqsa Mosque]], a sacred site for Muslims]] 
 Jerusalem has been sacred to [[Judaism]] for roughly 3000 years, to [[Christianity]] for around 2000 years, and to [[Islam]] for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 [[synagogue]]s, 158 [[church (building)|churches]], and 73 [[mosque]]s within the city. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace |url=https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2 October 2006 |edition=1st |last=Guinn |first=David E. |isbn=0-521-86662-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin/page/142 142]}} < /ref >  Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. 
 
 ===Jewish=== 
 According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is where God told the patriarch [[Abraham]] to [[sacrifice]] his son, [[Isaac]], to Him.  The Jews built the Temple, the centre of Jewish worship in ancient times, at the site of Abraham's sacrifice on the [[Temple Mount]] in the Old City.  Two buildings, one after the other, the First Temple and the Second Temple, stood at the site.  The First Temple housed the [[Ark of the Covenant]], a sacred box holding the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. 
 
 The [[Western Wall]] is a part of the Second Temple and Judaism's most sacred [[shrine]].  It is a stone wall that strengthened the western side of the Temple Mount in ancient times.  The wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall because of the sad [[prayer]]s Jewish people said there to mourn the destroyed Temple. 
 
 Other sites in the city that are sacred to the Jews include King David's [[tomb]] on [[Mount Zion]], and the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery|Jewish Cemetery]] and the Tombs of the Prophets on the [[Mount of Olives]], a hill just east of the Old City.  Many sites associated with Biblical figures are sacred to Christians, too. 
 
 ===Christian=== 
 Many [[Monastery|monasteries]], [[convent]]s, shrines, and religious [[Seminary|seminaries]] in Jerusalem mark events in the life of Jesus and in the formation of the Christian Church.  According to the Bible, Jesus taught in Jerusalem and performed numerous [[miracle]]s there.  The [[Last Supper]] supposedly took place in a room known as the Cenacle (also called Coenaculum) on Mount Zion.  The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City is said to be the place of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's Crucifixion]] (called Calvary or Golgotha), as well as His burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].  Several Christian [[sect]]s own the church, which was originally built by [[Constantine the Great]], then rebuilt and dedicated by the Crusaders in 1149 CE.  The building stands at the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of Sorrows), believed to be the path over which Jesus carried His cross to Calvary.  Jesus was last seen by His followers on the Mount of Olives before He went up to heaven.  All of these sites attract many religious [[Pilgrimage|pilgrims]] each year. 
 
 ===Islamic=== 
 Jerusalem is [[Islam]]'s third holiest city, after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].  According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad originally selected Jerusalem as the [[qibla]]: the direction Muslims should face during prayer.  However, he later told his followers to face Mecca instead of Jerusalem when praying.  Muhammad is said to have gone up to heaven from a stone now covered by a golden-domed shrine called the [[Dome of the Rock]].  The Dome of the Rock and the ancient [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] are among the holiest sites in Islam.  They are the main buildings on the Temple Mount, which Muslims call ''Haram al-Sharif'' (Noble Sanctuary). 
 
 ==Architecture== 
 Jerusalem's [[architecture]] is a mixture of old and new.  The Old City contains architectural examples from each major period in the city's history.  Many ancient historical sites and places of worship stand near modern shopping centers and [[Industry|industrial]] zones.  Architecture from the late 1800s and early 1900s shows [[Europe]]an influences.  Usefulness rather than style characterizes new apartment buildings constructed by the government as housing for [[immigrants]].  Many buildings, old and new, have matching exteriors because all construction is required to be faced with a cream-colored [[limestone]] called Jerusalem stone, produced by nearby [[Quarry|quarries]]. 
 
 ==Religion in Jerusalem== 
 [[Belz Beis HaMedrash HaGadol]] is the largest synagogue in Jerusalem.
