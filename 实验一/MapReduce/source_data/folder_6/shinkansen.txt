 The {{Nihongo|'''Shinkansen'''|新幹線||{{IPA-ja|ɕiŋkaꜜɰ̃seɴ|pron}}, {{lit|'new main line'}}|lead=yes}} is a group of [[high-speed rail]] lines in [[Japan]], upon which the famous  " Bullet Trains "  run. It is the world's first high-speed rail. 
 
 The Shinkansen are run by the many [[Japanese railways|JR]] [[company|companies]]. In the past, Japan Railway was called ''Japanese National Railways.'' It is now one group of [[privatization|private]] companies. JR also runs [[commuter train]]s and inter-city trains around [[Tokyo]]. 
 
 == Naming == 
 The name  " Bullet Train "  is the [[English language|English]] translation of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''dangan ressha'' (弾丸列車), which was the name given to the project while it was being studied in the 1940s. Nowadays, the trains are called Shinkansen trains. The name Shinkansen means  " New Trunk Line " . The trains are called  " Super Expresses " . 
 
 == History == 
 Japan was the first country to build railway lines for high-speed travel. Because Japan has many mountains, the network that already existed was made of 3'6 "  gauge (1067 mm) [[narrow gauge]] lines, which tended to take non-direct routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Because of this, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system could be upgraded easily. Unlike the older lines, Shinkansen lines are [[standard gauge]], and use [[tunnel]]s and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles, rather than around them. 
 
 Construction of the first section of the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]] started in 1959. The line opened on [[October 1]], [[1964]], just in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]]. The line was an immediate success, reaching the 100 million [[passenger]] mark in less than three years on [[July 13]], [[1967]] and one billion passengers in [[1976]]. 
 
 The [[0 Series Shinkansen|first Shinkansen trains]] ran at speeds of up to {{Convert|200|km/h||abbr=on}}, later increased to {{Convert|220|km/h||abbr=on}}. Some of these trains, with their classic bullet-nosed appearance, are still in use for stopping services between [[Fukuoka|Hakata]] and [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]]. A driving car from one of the original trains is now in the British [[National Railway Museum]] in York.  
 
 Many more advanced models of the train followed the first type, generally each with its own distinctive appearance. Shinkansen trains now run regularly at speeds of up to {{Convert|300|km/h||abbr=on}}, putting them among the fastest trains running in the world, along with the French [[TGV]] and German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] trains. 
 
 Originally meant to carry passengers and [[Train#Types of train|freight trains]] by day and night, the Shinkansen lines carry only passenger trains. The system shuts down 
 between midnight and 6:00 AM every day to allow maintenance to take place, including the running of [[Doctor Yellow]] test trains. The few overnight trains that still run in Japan run on the old narrow-gauge network to which the Shinkansen runs [[parallel]] to. 
 
 In 2003, JR Tokai reported that the Shinkansen's average arrival time was within 6 seconds of the [[schedule]]d time. This includes all-natural and human accidents and errors and is calculated from about 160,000 trips Shinkansen made. The previous record was from 1997 and was 18 seconds. 
 
 The first [[derailment]] (train [[accident]]) of a Shinkansen train in passenger service occurred during the [[2004 Chuetsu Earthquake|Chuetsu Earthquake]] on [[October 23]], [[2004]]. 6 of the total of 8 cars of the train on the Joetsu Shinkansen derailed near [[Nagaoka Station]] in [[Nagaoka, Niigata|Nagaoka]], [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]]. 
 
 In 1965 [[pay phone]]s were made available on Shinkansen trains. That service ended on 29 June 2021, because of the widespread ownership of [[mobile phone]]s by passengers. 
 
 == Future == 
 In recent years, due to [[noise pollution]], increasing speed is getting harder. Thus, the current research is aimed to reduce the amount of noise, mainly when trains exit a tunnel. 
 
 Three extensions are under construction for opening by 2014-2018: Nagano-[[Kanazawa]], [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]]-[[Hakodate]] and Takeo-Onsen-Isahaya. 
 
 The first ever Shinkansen line (built in 1964) travelled at {{Convert|200|km/h||abbr=on}} and was called the Tōkaido Shinkansen. In 1972 a second one was developed and the improvements on infrastructure allowed it to travel at around {{Convert|220|km/h||abbr=on}}. In 2003 the Japanese built the world's fastest ever Shinkansen, with a top speed of {{Convert|580|km/h||abbr=on}}.

 Two further lines, known as [[Mini-Shinkansen]] (ミニ新幹線), have also been constructed by upgrading existing sections of line: 
 
 *[[Yamagata Shinkansen]] ([[Fukushima Station|Fukushima]]-[[Shinjo Station|Shinjo]]) 
 *[[Akita Shinkansen]] ([[Morioka Station|Morioka]]-[[Akita Station|Akita]]) 
 
 Another standard gauge line using Shinkansen trains is not considered to be a Shinkansen line: 
 
 *[[Hakata Minami Line]] ([[Hakata Station|Hakata]]-[[Hakata-Minami Station|Hakata-Minami]]) 
 *Gala-Yuzawa Line (Echigo-Yuzawa – Gala-Yuzawa) 
 
 The following lines are under development: 
 
 *[[Hokkaidō Shinkansen]] (under construction, [[Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station|Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto]] - [[Sapporo Station|Sapporo]]) 
 *[[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] (under construction, [[Kanazawa Station|Kanazawa]] - [[Tsuruga Station|Tsuruga]]) 
 *[[Kyūshū Shinkansen]] (under construction, [[Takeo-Onsen Station|Takeo-Onsen]]-[[Nagasaki Station|Nagasaki]]) 
 *[[Chūō Shinkansen]] ([[maglev]], under construction, [[Shinagawa Station|Shinagawa]] - [[Nagoya Station|Nagoya]]) 
 
 Most Shinkansen lines that were proposed during the boom of the early 1970s have been postponed indefinitely. These include a link to [[Shikoku]] by the [[Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Project|Honshu-Shikoku bridge system]], a link from [[Tokyo]] to [[New Tokyo International Airport]], and a route covering the entire [[Sea of Japan]] coast of Honshu.
