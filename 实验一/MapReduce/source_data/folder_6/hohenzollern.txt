 The family became one of the electors of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and then were kings of [[Prussia]] in 1702 and [[German Empire|German emperors]] in 1871.   
 
 It stopped ruling after [[World War I]], when Germany became a [[republic]]. Prussia was abolished by the four Alliea that controlled Germany in 1947. 
 
 The family took it name from its ancestral home, Hohenzollern Castle, in what is now [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany. The area around the castle was once ruled as a separate principality.
