 '''Sirius''' is the brightest star in the night sky. It is a [[binary star]] system in [[Canis Major (constellation)|Canis Major]], near [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. It has an [[apparent magnitude]] of −1.46. The system is between 200 and {{Nowrap|300 million}} years old. < ref name= " Liebert2005 "  / >  It was originally composed of two stars: one was blue-white and one was white. 
 
 Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its position (it is relatively close to Earth). At a distance of 2.6 [[parsecs]] (8.6 [[ly]]), the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. 
 
 The Egyptians called this star '[[Sopdet]]'. They relied on it to predict when the flood season would start. Sirius is sometimes called the '''Dog Star'''. The phrase ''the dog days of summer'' means the hottest days of summer. 
 
 == Sirius A == 
 Sirius A is about twice as massive as the [[Sun]] and has an [[absolute magnitude]] of 1.42. It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun, < ref name= " Liebert2005 " > {{cite journal | first=J. | display-authors = etal| last=Liebert | title=The age and progenitor mass of Sirius B | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | year=2005 | volume=630 | issue=1 | pages=L69–L72 | bibcode=2005ApJ...630L..69L | doi=10.1086/462419 |arxiv = astro-ph/0507523 | s2cid = 8792889}} < /ref >  but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as [[Canopus]] or [[Rigel]]. 
 
 == Sirius B == 
 Originally, Sirius B had about five times the mass of the Sun. < ref name= " Liebert2005 "  / >  and was a [[B-type star]] (roughly B4–5) < ref > Liebert J. ''et al'' 2005. The age and progenitor mass of Sirius B. ''Astrophysical Journal'' '''630''' (1): L69–L72. [http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/630/1/L69/] < /ref >  when it still was on the [[main sequence]]. 
 
 Sirius B used up its fuel and became a [[red giant]]. Then it shed its outer layers and collapsed into its present state as a [[white dwarf]], about {{Nowrap|120 million}} years ago. Its mass now is about the same as the Sun.
