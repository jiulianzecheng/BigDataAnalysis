 The '''antbirds''' are a large [[passerine]] bird [[family (biology)|family]], the '''Thamnophilidae'''. < ref name=Zimmer > Zimmer K.  &  Isler M. 2003. Family Thamnophilidae (typical antbirds) pp. 459–531 in del Hoyo J; Elliot A.  &  Christie D. (eds) 2003. ''Handbook of the birds of the world'', volume 8: Broadbills to Tapaculos. Lynx Edicions. {{ISBN|84-87334-50-4}} < /ref >  They are found in subtropical and tropical [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], from [[Mexico]] to [[Argentina]]. There are more than 200 [[species]] called antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. 
 
 They are related to the antthrushes and antpittas (family [[Formicariidae]]), the [[tapaculo]]s, the [[gnateater]]s and the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]]. < ref > Irestedt M. ''et al'' 2004.

[http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-4-23] < /ref >  Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s. 
 
 Antbirds are generally small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly dull grey, white, brown and [[rufous]] [[plumage]]. The two sexes have somewhat different pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on their backs or shoulders. Most have heavy [[beak|bills]], which in many species are hooked at the tip. 
 
 Most species live in [[forests]], although a few are found in other [[habitats]]. They eat mostly insects and other [[arthropod]]s. Small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the [[understory]] and midstory of the forest, although a few feed in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and a few on the ground. 
 
 About eighteen species specialise in following columns of [[army ant]]s to eat the small [[invertebrate]]s flushed out by the ants. < ref > Willis E. and Oniki Y. 1978. Birds and army ants.

 Antbirds are [[monogamy|monogamous]], mate for life, and defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]]. They usually lay two eggs in a nest.  Both parents share the tasks of [[avian incubation|incubating]] eggs  and raising the nestlings. After [[fledge|fledging]], each parent cares exclusively for one chick. 
 
 Thirty-eight species are threatened with extinction as a result of human activities. The main threat is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], which lets [[predators]] get at their nests more easily.
