 The '''Vandals''' were an [[East Germanic]] [[tribe]] located in now southern poland. They entered the late [[Roman Empire]] during the [[5th century]]. The Vandals may have given their name to the region of [[Andalusia]], which according to one of several theories of its [[etymology]] was originally called ''Vandalusia'' or land of the Vandals. This would be the source of ''[[Al-Andalus]]'' — the Arabic name of Iberian Peninsula, < ref > Dozy, Reinhart P. 1881. Recherches sur l'histoire et la littérature des Arabes d'Espagne pendant le Moyen-Age. < /ref >  in the south of present-day [[Spain]], where they settled before pushing on to create a Vandal Kingdom in [[North Africa]].  
 
 The [[Goths|Goth]] [[Theodoric the Great]], king of the [[Ostrogoths]] and regent of the [[Visigoths]], was allied by marriage with the Vandals, as well as with the [[Burgundians]] and the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]].  
 
 [[Byzantine Empire]] forces under [[Justinian I]] conquered the Vandalic African kingdom in 534.
