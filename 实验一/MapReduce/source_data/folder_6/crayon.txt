 A '''crayon''' (or '''wax pastel''') is a stick of [[pigment]]ed [[wax]] used for writing or drawing. Wax crayons differ from [[pastel]]s, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry [[binder (material)|binder]] such as [[gum arabic]], and from [[oil pastel]]s, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil. 
 
 Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.
