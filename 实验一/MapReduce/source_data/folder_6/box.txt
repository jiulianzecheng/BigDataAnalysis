 A '''box''' is a [[container]] used to put things in. It is mainly a [[cuboid]] ([[Square (geometry)|square]]) shape, but it can be other shapes too. Boxes are usually made out of [[cardboard]], [[wood]], [[plastic]] or [[metal]]. 
 Many boxes are made of cardboard, and a lot of them are made. They are primarily used for [[packaging]], commercial goods or storing goods and materials. They can be made from bent or wrinkled [[cardboard]]. In their most obvious life stage, they are popularly used as a cheap material to hold a range of projects, among them being science experiments, children's toys, costumes and other things. 
 
 A '''box''' also means a [[rectangle]], ''e.g. userbox''. But rectangles are mainly referred to as rectangles, the term box is the outline, or [[perimeter]] of the rectangle.
