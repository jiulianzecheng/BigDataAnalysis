A '''castelnau''' (from the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] words castèl nòu, meaning  " new castle " ) is a type of [[village]] or [[town]] set up in the [[Middle Ages]] near a [[castle]]. 
 
 == History == 
 At the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]], two [[Building|buildings]] made people want to live in a town. These were the [[castle]] and the [[Church (building)|church]]. During this time period, there were types of towns called  " castra, "   " castet, "   " forts, "  and  " castelnaus " . They were said to be [[Fortification|fortified]] [[Human settlement|settlements]] with a stone castle inside. Castelnaus were usually made up of many houses in the center. Castelnaus were usually on defensive places at higher [[Elevation|elevations]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAFAAAAQAAJ & dq=%22Castelnau%22 & pg=PA17|title=Mémoires de Messire Michel de Castelnau: Seigneur de Mauvissière at de Concressaut, Baron de Jonville, Comte de Beaumont Le Roger ...|last=Mauvissière)|first=Michel de Castelnau (sieur de la|date=1823|language=fr}} < /ref >
