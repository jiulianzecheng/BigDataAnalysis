 A '''massif''' is a part of the [[Earth's crust]] that has been pushed up. Usually this happens when [[Plate tectonics|continental plates]] press against each other. One set of rocks goes up, the other goes down towards the [[Earth's mantle]]. < ref > {{cite web |last1=Sawe |first1=Benjamin |title=What is a massif? |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-a-massif.html |website=WorldAtlas |date=14 June 2018 |access-date=18 November 2019 |language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite dictionary |title=massif |dictionary=Merriam-Webster Unabridged |access-date=18 November 2019 |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/massif}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |title=Mountains Information and Facts |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/earth/surface-of-the-earth/mountains/ |website=National Geographic |access-date=18 November 2019 |language=en |date=15 October 2018}} < /ref >   
 
 The word  " massif "  means a [[block]] of [[mountain]]s formed by this process, and  surrounded by [[Fault (geology)|fault lines]]. Linear mountains like those on the western side of the [[Americas]] are usually not called massifs. They are called [[mountain chain]]s. 
 
 An example of a massif is [[Saser Kangri]] in the [[Karakoram]] which is made up of six mountains. The most famous example of a massif is the [[Himalayan]] group.
