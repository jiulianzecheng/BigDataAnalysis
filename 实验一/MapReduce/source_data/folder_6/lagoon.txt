 A '''lagoon''' is a body of salt water partly separated from the sea. There is usually some sort of barrier which separates and protects the lagoon. This may be a [[pebble]] or [[shingle beach]], [[sand]] bank, or perhaps a [[coral reef]] surrounding an [[atoll]]. An atoll is an oceanic island formed by a [[volcano]].  
 
 ''Lagoon'' refers both to coastal lagoons, and the lagoons in atolls, formed by the growth of coral reefs on slowly [[erosion|eroding]] central islands.
