 ==History== 
 Ancient [[Oeniadae]] ({{lang-grc|Οἰνιάδαι}}) was a port town on the west bank of the river [[Achelous River|Achelous]]. It was one of the most important towns of ancient [[Acarnania]]. Oeniadai was first mentioned in the 5th century BC. < ref name=princeton > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:entry=oiniadai OINIADAI Greece], entry in The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites. < /ref > 
 
 It was against a hill in the marshes. These protected it from invaders. < ref name=DGRG > {{cite DGRG|title=Oeniadae}} < /ref >  It is the same place the modern village, [[Katochi]]. 
 
 It was an important port on the route to Corfu. It changed its alliances often in the history. At first it was a member of the [[Peloponnesian League]]. But, in 424 BC it joined the Delian League. In the Hellenistic period, Oiniadai allied with the Aetolians until 218 BC when Philip V declared it free. From 211-189 BC during the Roman-Macedonian wars the Aetolians controlled it again. In Roman times it became less important.
