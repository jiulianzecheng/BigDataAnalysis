 A '''herbal''' is a collection of [[plant]] descriptions: Very often, it also lists the properties of each plant, or its use, for example for [[medicine]] or [[alchemy]]. A herebal can also classify the plants it describes. One of the oldest known herbals is the [[Vienna Dioscurides]] dating from the 6th century. Physicians and Apothecaries were the main users of such books. Herbals were also important for the study of [[botany]]. [[Hieronymus Bock]] descrived the plants of southwestern Germany, in his 16th century herbal; he was the first to mention certain [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features.
