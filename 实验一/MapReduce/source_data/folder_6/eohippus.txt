 '''''Eohippus''''' is small [[fossil]] proto-[[horse]]. It is an [[extinction|extinct]] [[genus]] of small [[equid]] [[ungulate]]s. < ref > MacFadden B.J. 2005.

 Much of the evolution of the horse took place in North America. That is where horses originated, but became [[extinct]] there about 10,000 years ago. < ref > {{Cite book | last = Singer | first = Ben | title = A brief history of the horse in America | publisher = Canadian Geographic Magazine | date = May 2005 | url =http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/#cnd | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120107031152/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/|archive-date= 2012-01-07|url-status = dead|accessdate =22 December 2017}} < /ref >
