 '''Azrael''' is the archangel of death. It is an English form of the Arabic name Azra'il or Azra'eil ({{lang-ar|عزرایل}}), the name traditionally attributed to the angel of death in [[Islam]] and some [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[lore]]. The [[Qur'an]] never uses this name, referring instead to Malaikat al-Maut (which translates directly as angels of death; not one angel). Since it is not mentioned either in the Qur'an nor [[Hadith]], it is not part of the religion. It is thought by some to be legendary or adapted from other religions. It is also spelled Izrail, Izrael, Azrail, Ezraeil, Azraille, or Ozryel. Chambers English dictionary uses the spelling Azrael. The name means ''Whom God Helps.''
