 Rhabdomyosarcoma should not be confused with [[rhabdomyolysis]], which is often called  " rhabdo "  for short. 
 
 There are three different kinds of rhabdomyosarcoma. 
 
 ==Types of Rhabdomyosarcoma== 
 
 ===Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS)=== 
 This is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.  More than half of people with this cancer have ERMS. < ref name= " emedicine.medscape.com " / >   It is most common in children under age 6. < ref name=cancer.org > {{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/rhabdomyosarcoma/detailedguide/rhabdomyosarcoma-what-is-rhabdomyosarcoma |title=What is rhabdomyosarcoma? |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=November 20, 2014 |website=www.cancer.org |publisher=American Cancer Society |accessdate=January 3, 2016 |quote= |archive-date=January 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110152535/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/rhabdomyosarcoma/detailedguide/rhabdomyosarcoma-what-is-rhabdomyosarcoma |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma usually happens in: < ref name= " emedicine.medscape.com " / >   
 * The head or neck; 
 * The [[genitals]]; or 
 * The [[urinary system]]. 
 
 ===Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS)=== 
 This is the second most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma.  Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in older children and teenagers, but it can also happen in younger children and adults. < ref name=cancer.org / > 
 
 ARMS usually happens in the big muscles in: < ref name=cancer.org / > 
 * The arms or legs; 
 * The [[chest]]; or 
 * The [[abdomen]] 
 
 However, it can also happen in the genitals or the area around the [[anus]]. < ref name=kids / > 
 
 This type of rhabdomyosarcoma usually grows faster than embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and needs more treatment than ERMS. < ref name=cancer.org / > 
 
 ===Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma=== 
 Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma does not happen very often.  When it does happen, it usually affects adults; is very rare in children. < ref name=kids / > 
 
 This type of cancer usually grows quickly and needs a lot of treatment. 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 The choice of how to treat rhabdomyosarcoma depends on many things.  For example: < ref name=kids / > 
 * Where is the [[tumor]]? 
 * How big is the tumor? 
 * Has the tumor [[metastasis|spread to other parts of the body]]? 
 * Can the entire tumor be taken out by [[surgery]]? 
 * What type of rhabdomyosarcoma does the person have? 
 * Has the cancer caused changes to the person's [[gene]]s? 
 * How old is the patient? 
 
 Based on all of these things, the patient and their medical team can decide what treatment is best.  There are three types of treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma: 
 * [[Radiation therapy|Radiation]] 
 * [[Chemotherapy]] 
 * [[Surgery]] 
 
 ==Prognosis== 
 The [[prognosis]] of a person with rhabdomyosarcoma also depends on many different things.  For example, adults with rhabdomyosarcoma usually have tumors that grow faster and are harder to treat.  Prognosis also depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma a person has, what kind of treatment they get, whether their cancer has spread, and many other things. < ref name=kids / > < ref name=cancer.org / >
