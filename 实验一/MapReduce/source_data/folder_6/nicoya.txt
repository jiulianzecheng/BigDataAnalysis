 '''Nicoya''' is a town in [[Costa Rica]]'s [[Guanacaste Province]]. It is one of the most important [[tourism|tourist]] zones. It serves as a transport hub to Guanacaste's [[beach]]es and [[national park]]s. The town is also the capital of the ''cantón'' of the same name (Nicoya Canton). 
 
 The town was built in an old colonial style. It was built in the Cordillera Volcánica de Guanacaste. [[Agriculture]] and [[cattle]] are the town's main economic activity. 
 
 In early 2006, a group of researchers led by adventure writer Dan Buettner and supported by National Geographic Magazine, the National Institute for Aging, and Alliance Healthcare, designated Nicoya as a [[Blue Zone]]. This designation is granted to global regions that are characterized by the longest life expectancies.  Among the ideal Nicoyan lifestyle characteristics cited by the research were the water’s high calcium content, intense daily physical activity, year-long fruit consumption, and close inter-generational relationships.
