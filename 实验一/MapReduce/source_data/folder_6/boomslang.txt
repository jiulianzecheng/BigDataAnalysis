 The '''boomslang''' (''Dispholidus typus'') is a large [[venom]]ous [[snake]] found in sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]]. < ref > [https://www.africansnakebiteinstitute.com/snake/boomslang/ Boomslang] < /ref >  Its name means  " tree snake "  in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]]. It is a [[colubrid]], the largest family of snakes, found on every [[continent]] except [[Antarctica]]. 
 
 Boomslangs eat small animals like [[chameleon]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[bird]]s, and they also eat [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. Like all snakes, boomslangs do not chew {{ndash}} they swallow everything whole. 
 
 The venom of boomslangs can disrupt the [[clot]]ting of blood, and this can kill a person. Even a small scratch can be fatal. After a bite, one can sometimes feel a headache, [[nausea]], sleepiness, and get a mental disorder. This does not happen often, as boomslangs only bite humans when they feel attacked. 
 
 Its eyes are large in proportion to its head; they have binocular vision that helps them spot their prey. Its scientific name is ''Dispholidus typus''. A boomslang is a slender snake with large eyes on a large blunt head. The snake can grow to up to 2 metres long, but is on average about 1 to 1.6 m in length.
