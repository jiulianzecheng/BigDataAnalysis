 In astrophysics, '''spaghettification''' (sometimes referred to as the '''noodle effect''') < ref > {{citation|last1=Wheeler|first1=J. Craig|title=Cosmic catastrophes: exploding stars, black holes, and mapping the universe|date=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1ej8d0F8jAC|page=182|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85714-7}} < /ref >  is the pulling and [[Physical compression|pushing]] of objects into long thin [[spaghetti]]-like shapes as they go near a strong field of [[gravity]]. It is caused by extreme [[Tidal force|tidal forces.]] Near a [[black hole]], the pulling and pushing are so powerful that no object can resist it. In a small region, the pushing balances the pulling so that a small object being spaghettified experiences no change in [[volume]]. 
 
 [[Stephen Hawking]] described the flight of a [[Fiction|fictional]] [[astronaut]] who was passing within a black hole's [[event horizon]]. The astronaut he describes is  " stretched like spaghetti "  by the difference in gravitational force, or the gradient, from head to toe. < ref > {{cite book|title=[[A Brief History of Time]]|last=Hawking|first=Stephen|date=1988|publisher=Bantam Dell Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-10953-5|pages=256|author-link=Stephen Hawking}} < /ref >  The reason this happens is that the gravity force [[wikt:exert|exerted]] by the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] would be much stronger at one end of the body than the other. If one were to fall into a black hole feet first, the gravity at their feet would be much stronger than at their head, causing the person to be vertically pulled. Along with that, the right side of the body will be pulled to the left, and the left side of the body will be pulled to the right, pushing the sides of the person inward. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Astronomy|url=https://archive.org/details/Astronomy_201904|publisher=OpenStax|year=2016|isbn=978-1938168284|pages=[https://archive.org/details/Astronomy_201904/page/n873 862]}} < /ref >  Spaghettification of a [[star]] was seen for the first time in 2018 by scientists observing a pair of colliding galaxies [[Approximation|approximately]] 150 million [[Light year|light-years]] from Earth. < ref > {{cite press release |url=https://public.nrao.edu/news/black-hole-destroys-star/ |title=Astronomers See Distant Eruption as Black Hole Destroys Star |publisher=National Radio Astronomy Observatory |agency=Phys.org |date=2018-06-14 |access-date=2018-06-15}} < /ref >
