 == History == 
 During antiquity, Corinth was one of the most important [[ancient Greece|Greek]] cities. It was often the opponent of [[Athens]] and these two cities competed with each other. It founded many colonies in south [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]] such as [[Siracusa]]. Corinth was conquered by [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 146 B.C. Two epistles of [[Paul the Apostle]] to the Corinthian Christians are in the Bible. 
 
 The modern city of Corinth is about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) northeast of the ancient ruins. Since 1896, the Corinth excavations by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens have revealed large parts of the ancient city. Recent excavations by the Greek Ministry of Culture have brought to light important new discoveries. 
 
 During Middle Ages, it was an important city with a [[fortification]]. In 1460 it came under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish rule]] and it was liberated in 1830, after the [[Greek War of Independence]].
