 '''Uruk''' was an ancient city of [[Sumer]] and later [[Babylonia]]. It was east of the present bed of the [[Euphrates]] river, on the ancient dry former channel of the Euphrates River. < ref name= " Harmansah, 2007 " > Harmansah, 2007 < /ref >  It was in what is now [[Iraq]]. 
 
 Uruk gives its name to the [[Uruk period]], the early [[Chalcolithic]] to early [[Bronze Age]] period in [[Mesopotamia]], about 4000 to 3100 [[BC]]. This was followed by the period of [[Sumer]] proper. It played a leading role in the early urbanization of [[Sumer]] in the mid 4th millennium BC. 
 
 At its height c 2900 BC, Uruk probably had 50,000–80,000 residents living in 6 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  of walled area. It was the largest city in the world at the time. < ref name= " Harmansah, 2007 " / >   
 
 According to the chronology in the [[Sumerian king list]], the semi-mythical king [[Gilgamesh]] ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC. 
 The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC, after the struggle of [[Babylonia]] with [[Elam]]. It remained inhabited throughout the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and [[Parthia]]n periods until it was finally abandoned during the [[Sassanid]] period, just before the [[Islamic]] conquest of Mesopotamia. 
 
 The site of Uruk was discovered in 1849. The name of lower Mesopotamia, ''al-ʿIrāq'', is thought to be derived from the name ''Uruk''. < ref > " The name ''al-ʿIrāq'', for all its Arabic appearance, is derived from [[Middle Persian]] ''erāq'' 'lowlands' "  W.
