 '''Dictyoptera''' includes two [[Order (biology)|orders]] of insects – cockroackes and temites ([[Blattodea]]), and mantids ([[Mantodea]]). 
 
 While all modern Dictyoptera have short [[ovipositor]]s, the oldest fossils of Dictyoptera have long ovipositors, much like members of the [[Orthoptera]]. 
 
 The term Dictyoptera is usually considered a superorder, with Isoptera, Blattaria and Mantodea being its three orders. In some classifications, however, Dictyoptera is shifted to order status.  
 
 Regardless, in all classifications the three constituent groups are the same, just treated at different rank. Termites and cockroaches are very closely related, with ecological and molecular data pointing to a relationship with the cockroach genus ''[[Cryptocercus]]''. < ref > Lo N. ''et al.'' 2000.

 Based on genetic evidence, the closest living relatives of the Dictyoptera are the [[Phasmatodea|phasmids]]. If the Dictyoptera are a superorder they might be included in it. < ref > Cameron, Stephen L.; Barker, Stephen C.  &  Whiting, Michael F. 2006.
