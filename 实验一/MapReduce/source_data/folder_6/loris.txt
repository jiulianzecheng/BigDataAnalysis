 The '''Lorises''' are solitary [[mammal]]s that live in [[tropical rainforests]] in [[southeast Asia]]. The loris is arboreal, living in trees. It is nocturnal, most active at night. In captivity, the loris lives for up to 13 years. 
 
 The loris is a group of [[primate]]s. They are closely related to [[galago]]s and slightly less closely related to [[lemur]]s.  
 
 The loris has enormous eyes, grasping fingers, and toes with opposable digits. The loris ranges from 7 to 15 inches (18 to 38 & nbsp;cm) long. It has a stubby tail, only about 1 inch (3 & nbsp;cm) long. 
 
 The loris is an omnivore (eating plants and animals); it eats mostly [[insect]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[fruit]]s, and some plant shoots.
