 '''Kabbalah''' (also '''Cabala''' or '''Qabbālâ''') is a Jewish [[mysticism]] of the [[Torah]]. The kabbalah started in the 1st-century by Rabbi [[Simeon bar Yochai]]. It continued in the [[13th century]] in [[Spain]] by Rabbi Moses de León. It tries to explain how something beyond thought and imagining can still be seen and felt. The kabbalah has a great influence on the Jewish spiritual life. It is based on the various spiritual movements. 
 
 == Tree of Life == 
 The kabbalah is based on the tree of the 10 [[Sephirot]] called the  " Tree of Life " . In the tree are presented the 10 powers that affect each domain in the world.
