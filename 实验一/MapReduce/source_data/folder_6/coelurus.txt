 '''''Coelurus''''' (meaning  " hollow " ) is a poorly known genus. It was perhaps a bipedal [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] 6 & nbsp;feet (1.8 & nbsp;m) long, weighing roughly 20 & nbsp;kg. Its femur (thigh bone) was 55 & nbsp;cm long. It was a carnivore that lived during the late [[Jurassic|Jurassic period]], about 156 to 145 million years ago. Its bones were hollow and lightweight, so ''Coelurus'' was probably light and fast. Its fossils were found in [[Wyoming]]. ''Coelurus'' was named by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Othniel C. Marsh]] in 1879.
