 In [[Greek mythology]], '''Medea''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|d|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Μήδεια}}, ''Mēdeia'', {{lang-ka|მედეა}}, ''Medea'') is a sorceress of Greek mythology. She was the daughter of [[Aeetes|King Aeëtes]] of [[Colchis]], < ref > Colchis was an ancient [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Kingdom < /ref >  niece of [[Circe]], granddaughter of the sun god [[Helios]]. She married the hero [[Jason]], and had two children with him, [[Mermeros and Pheres]]. In [[Euripides]]'s play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', Jason leaves Medea when [[Creon (king of Corinth)|Creon]], king of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], offers him his daughter, [[Glauce]]. < ref > Glauce is known as [[Creusa]] in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''Medea and in [[Propertius]]'' 2.16.30. < /ref >  The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children. 
 
 The myths involving Jason have been interpreted < ref > See, for example, Nita Krevans,  " Medea as foundation-heroine " , in John Joseph Clause, Sarah Iles Johnston, eds. ''Medea: essays on Medea in myth, literature, philosophy, and art'' (Princeton University Press) 1997:71-82. < /ref >  as part of a class of myths that tell how the Hellenes of the distant heroic age, before the [[Trojan War]], faced the challenges of the pre-Greek  " [[Pelasgian]] "  cultures of mainland Greece, the Aegean and Anatolia. [[Jason]], [[Perseus]], [[Theseus]], and above all [[Heracles]], are all figures on the threshold between the old world of [[shaman]]s, earth deities, and the new [[Bronze Age]] Greek ways. < ref > For this general aspect, see especially Carl A.P.

 Medea figures in the myth of Jason and the [[Argonauts]], a myth known best from a late literary version worked up by [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in the 3rd century BC and called the ''[[Argonautica]].'' However, for all its self-consciousness and researched archaic vocabulary, the late epic was based on very old, scattered materials. Medea is known in most stories as an enchantress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess [[Hecate]] or a [[witch]]. The myth of Jason and Medea is very old, originally written around the time [[Hesiod]] wrote the ''[[Theogony]]''. It was known to the composer of the  ''[[Little Iliad]]'', part of the [[Epic Cycle]].
