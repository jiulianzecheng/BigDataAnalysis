 [[File:LocatonSasonDistrict.png|thumb|200px|The District of Sason highlighted within the [[Batman Province]].]] 
 '''Sason''' ({{lang-hy|Սասուն}} ''Sasun''; {{lang-ku|Qabilcewz}} from {{lang-ar|قبل جوز}}; formerly known as '''Sasun''' or '''Sassoun''') is a [[district]] in the [[Batman Province]] of [[Turkey]]. It was formerly part of the sanjak of [[Siirt]], which was in Diyarbakır vilayet until 1880. It was in [[Bitlis Vilayet]] in 1892. Later it became part of [[Muş]] sanjak in Bitlis vilayet. Sason remained part of Muş until 1927. It was one of the districts of Siirt province until 1993. The boundaries of the district varied considerably in time. The current borders are not the same as in the [[19th century]]. This is when the district of Sasun was situated more to the [[north]] (mostly territory now included in the central district of [[Muş]]). < ref > Thierry, J.M., Sasun. Voyages archéologiques, Revue des études arméniennes 23, 1992, p.320; Verheij, Jelle. ’Les frères de terre et d'eau’ : sur le rôle des Kurdes dans les massacres arméniens de 1894-1896 " , in: Bruinessen, M. van  &  Blau, Joyce (eds), Islam des Kurdes (special issue of Les Annales de l'Autre islam 5, Paris, 1998) p.239 < /ref > 
 
 Sasun, as it is called by [[Armenia]]ns, holds a prominent role in [[Armenian culture]] and [[history]]. It is the setting of ''[[Daredevils of Sassoun]]'', Armenia's national epic. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was a major location of Armenian ''[[Armenian fedayi|fedayi]]'' activities, who staged two uprisings against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities. They rebelled against the [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] [[tribe]]s in [[1894 Sasun rebellion|1894]] and [[1904 Sasun uprising|1904]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 [[History|Historically]] the area was known as ''Sasun'', part of the historical [[Armenian Highland]]. Sasun was in the [[Arzanene]] [[province]] of the [[Ancient history|ancient]] Armenian [[Kingdom]]. Later the region was ruled by the [[Mamikonian]] [[dynasty]] from around 772 until 1189/1190. This is when the Mamikonians moved to [[Cilicia]] after being forced out by Shah-Armen. < ref > {{cite book|last=Hewsen|first=Robert H.|author-link=Robert Hewsen|title=Armenia: A Historical Atlas|location=Chicago|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-226-33228-4|page=95}} < /ref > 
 
 ===The Ottoman period=== 
 The region was eventually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], becoming part of the sanjak of [[Muş]] in [[Bitlis Vilayet]], and continued to hold a substantial population of Armenians. < ref name= " hewsen1 " > Hewsen, ''Armenia'', p. 206. < /ref >   During this period, Sason was a federation of some forty Armenian villages, whose inhabitants were known as Sasuntsis ({{lang-hy|Սասունցի}}). < ref name= " hewsen1 " / >  Surrounded by fierce [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribes to whom they were often forced to pay tribute, the Sasuntsis were able to maintain an autonomy free of Turkish rule until the end of the 19th century when the Kurds themselves were finally brought under government control. < ref name= " hewsen1 " / > < ref > Hewsen, ''Armenia'' p. 167. < /ref >  Proud warriors, the Sasuntsis made all their own [[weapon]]s and relied on nothing from the outside [[world]]. < ref name= " hewsen1 " / > 
 
 In 1893, about three to four thousand [[Nomadic people|nomadic]] Kurds from the [[Diyarbakır]] area entered the Sason region. This [[Wikt:incursion|incursion]] of nomads, who customarily used the [[mountain]] [[meadow]]s of the area in [[summer]] for their [[herd]]s, was harmful to the [[wikt:sedentary|sedentary]] Armenians. The Kurds were responsible for bringing economic ruin to the agrarian community of the Armenian villagers. They would steal [[livestock]] and demand the Armenians to pay a second [[tax]] (that is, a separate tax in addition to the one Armenians paid to the Ottoman government). < ref > {{cite book|last=Balakian|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Balakian|title=The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response|location=New York|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=0-06-055870-9|page=54}} < /ref > < ref > Eliot, Charles. ''Turkey in Europe'', p.405. 1908. < /ref > < ref > Quataert, Don. ''An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire'', p.880. Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-57455-2}} < /ref >  When Armenians decided to challenge the Kurds, there was a fight and a Kurd was killed. Using the Kurd's death as a reason, Turkish officials allowed a Kurdish attack against the Armenians of Sason. < ref > Balakian, pp. 54-55. < /ref > 
 
 The Kurds, however, were successfully driven off by the armed Armenian [[village]]rs. But that success was then seen as a possible threat by the Ottoman authorities. In 1894 the villagers refused to pay taxes unless the Ottoman authorities protected them against more Kurdish attacks and extortions. Instead, the government sent a force of about 3,000 [[soldier]]s and Kurdish [[Irregular military|irregulars]] to disarm the villagers. This ended in a general [[massacre]] of between 900 to 3,000 men, women and children. The  " Sasun affair "  was [[Wikt:investigate|investigate]]d by [[Europe]]an Powers. This resulted in demands that [[Ottoman Turkey]] initiate reforms in the six  " Armenian vilayets " . [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s response to those demands culminated in the [[Hamidian Massacres|anti-Armenian pogroms]] of 1895 and 1896. < ref > Hewsen. ''Armenia'', p. 231. < /ref > 
 
 As part of the [[Hamidian massacres]], it is estimated that at least 1,000 Armenian villagers were slain in the Sason atrocity. < ref > White, Paul J. ''Primitive Rebels Or Revolutionary Modernisers?'', p.60-61. Zed Books, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85649-822-0}} < /ref >  This was caused by the buildup of Ottoman [[troop]]s in early 1894. < ref > Kaiser, Hilmar. ''Imperialism, Racism, and Development Theories'', p.6. [[Gomidas Institute]], 1997. {{ISBN|1-884630-02-2}} < /ref >  Officials and military officers involved in the Sason massacres were decorated and rewarded. < ref > Chisholm, Hugh. ''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', p.568. The Encyclopædia Britannica Co., 1910. < /ref > 
 
 ==Modern Sason== 
 Today, most of Sason's population is [[Kurdish people|Kurd]], [[Arab]], or [[Zaza people|Zaza]]. An Armenian minority may still exist (in 1972 there were estimated to be some 6,000 Armenian villagers in the region). < ref > Chisholm, Hugh. ''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', p. 268. < /ref >
