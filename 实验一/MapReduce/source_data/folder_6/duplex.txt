 A '''duplex''' is a building with [[apartment]]s < ref > {{Cite web|title=Serviced Apartment Hong Kong|url=https://www.owl2residence.com/wan-chai-serviced-apartment/|access-date=2021-05-05|website=Owl Square Residence|language=en-US}} < /ref >  for two different [[household]]s.  A duplex usually looks like other [[house]]s, but it has a separate entrance for each household. 
 
 In some places, the word  " duplex "  is more specific: In some regions, a  " duplex "  is a building with one unit above the other, separated by a floor and ceiling, but the staircase for upstairs residents is almost always indoors.  In other regions, a  " duplex "  is a '''twin house''': The units are next to each other, separated by a wall.  In some regions, the word  " duplex "  is used for both kinds of buildings.  The word  " duplex "  is not used in some cities, particularly [[Detroit]], [[Dallas]] or [[Chicago]]. 
 
 Some duplexes have [[basement]]s.  Others do not.
