'''Paraphyly''' is a term in [[cladistics]]. It means a group which does not include all its descendents. < ref > King R.C. Stansfield W.D.  &  Mulligan P.K. 2006.

Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, Massachusetts, 45. {{ISBN|0-87893-187-2}} < /ref >  So [[Sauropsid]]a without [[bird]]s is paraphyletic, since birds are definitely descended from [[archosaur]]s, probably small [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s ([[origin of birds]]).

 Paraphyly is corrected to [[monophyly]] when the missing group(s) are included. So if birds are included in Sauropsida, the larger group is then [[monophyly|monophyletic]].  
 
 Traditional Linnaean [[biological classification|classification]] is often paraphyletic. Many common terms, like  " [[fish]] " , are paraphyletic, but still very useful for everyday purposes.
