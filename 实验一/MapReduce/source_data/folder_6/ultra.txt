 '''Ultra''' was the name given by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military intelligence]] for the attack on [[Third Reich|German]] military [[codes]] in [[World War II]]. It included the [[Enigma machine]] and, later, the Japanese [[Purple machine]]. 
 
 The work on Enigma started before the war, when [[Poles|Polish]] [[cryptography|cryptographers]] smuggled out an Enigma machine to England. The codename 'Ultra', however, was only given to the work in 1941. 
 
 Work on understanding the Enigma, and on breaking  German military signals, was of vital importance in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], the greatest threat to Britain during the war. < ref > Hough R. 1986. ''The longest battle: the war at sea 1939-45''. London: Weidenfeld  &  Nicolson. < /ref >  The key event occurred in 1941, when not just a machine, but also a codebook, was got from a German submarine. < ref > Kahn D.

 Wartime [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) were got as follows. First of all, [[encryption|encrypted]] German radio messages in [[Morse code]] were recorded in Britain. Their place of origin was got by recording the messages at two different receiving places. The attack on the codes was done at the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]]. < ref > Hinsley F.H.  &  Stripp, Alan (eds) 1992.

 '''Ultra''' became the standard term among the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence got was thought more important than the highest British [[Classified information|security classification]] (''Most Secret'').
