'''''FHM''''' or '''''For Him Magazine''''' is an international monthly magazine. The magazine began publication in 1985 in the [[United Kingdom]] under the name ''For Him'' and changed its title to ''FHM'' in 1994, although the full ''For Him Magazine'' continues to be printed on the spine of each issue. Founded by Chris Astridge, the magazine was a predominantly fashion-based publication distributed through high street [[men's fashion]] outlets. Circulation expanded to newsagents as a quarterly by the spring of 1987. < ref name=magpromotion > [http://www.magazinepromotion.com/articles/fhmmagazine.html FHM Magazine: Its History] < /ref >  ''FHM'' was sold from [[EMAP]] to [[Bauer Verlagsgruppe|Bauer]] in December 2007. < ref > [http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/dec/08/emapbusiness.mediabusiness Emap sells Grazia and FHM in Â£1.1bn deal | Business | The Guardian < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >
