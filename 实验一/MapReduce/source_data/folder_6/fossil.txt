 A '''fossil''' is the remains or trace of an ancient living thing. < ref > Fossil: the remains or impression of a prehistoric plant or animal, usually petrified (turned into stone) while embedded in rock " . ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 9th ed. < /ref > 
 
 Fossils of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, or [[protist]]s occur in [[sedimentary rock]].  
 
 In a typical fossil, the body form is retained, but the original [[molecule]]s that made up the body have been replaced by some [[Inorganic matter|inorganic]] material, such as [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ) or [[silica]] (SiO < sub > 2 < /sub > ). The fossil feels like, and is, made of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It has been [[mineralization|mineralised]] or ''petrified'' (literally, turned into rock).  
 
 A fossil may also be an ''imprint'' or ''impression'' of a living thing remaining in the fossilised [[mud]] of a long-gone age.  
 
 Some [[organism]]s fossilise well, others do not. The most common fossils are those left behind by organisms that produce hard materials. The hard, [[Calcite|calcitic]] shells of [[mollusc]]s (such as [[clam]]s and [[snail]]s) and of now-rare [[brachiopod]]s (also known as lampshells) are examples. These sea-dwelling [[shellfish]] have produced many fossiliferous (that is, fossil-bearing) [[chalk]]y [[strata|layers]] of [[limestone]] in the earth.  
 
 Soft-bodied organisms can fossilise in special circumstances: the [[Ediacaran biota]] is a good example. < ref > Levin, Harold. 2006. ''The Earth though time''. 8th ed, Wiley N.Y. Chapter 6, p117. < /ref >   
 
 The best-known fossils for the general public are those of the giant, [[prehistoric]] [[dinosaur]]s. The fossilized [[bone]]s and fossilized [[Animal tracks|tracks]] of these huge, [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[reptile]]s can be seen in many [[museum]]s of [[natural history]] and [[earth science]].  
 
 The study of fossils by [[geologist]]s and [[biologist]]s is known as [[paleontology]]. If the study puts living things in their [[ecology|ecological]] context it is called [[paleobiology]]. 
 
 
 Examples of fossils include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, objects preserved in amber, hair, petrified wood, oil, coal, and DNA remnants. 
 
 == Human uses == 
 
 People have found many uses for fossils. Some fossils are found and sold. Other fossils like those in the [[Tamiami formation]] are used in the construction of roads. In some places fossils are used as a mulch- material used to cover soil. Some fossils are used as a marker to determine formation .  
 
 Some fossils are used as a source of fuel, these fossils are referred to as a [[fossil fuel]]. 
 
 == Places of special preservation == 
 There are some sites where fossils have been found with remarkable details, or in large numbers. Palaeontologists call these sites by the German term ''[[Lagerstätte]]n''. The [[La Brea tar pits]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, is such a place. So are the [[Solnhofen limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]] in [[Bavaria]]. 
 
 In the Earth’s structure a very important place for fossils is the [[Burgess Shale]]. It is known for its many important fossil discoveries. 
 
 == Types of fossils == 
 [[Microscopic]], or ''very tiny’', fossils are called “microfossils”. Larger, ''[[macroscopic]]'' fossils — such as those of [[mollusc|seashells]] and [[mammal]]s — are called  " macrofossils " . Sometimes [[natural]] [[stone]]s look like fossilized [[organism]]s, but they are not fossils at all. Rather, they are called  " pseudofossils " .  
 
 Although most fossils are formed from the hard parts of organisms, there are also ''indirect'' [[signs]] of prehistoric life. Examples such as a [[worm]]'s [[trail]] or an animal's footprint are quite common. These are known as  ''[[trace fossil]]s''. Fossilized [[excrement]], [[faeces]] or dung is known as a ''coprolite''. A [[chemical]] trace of prehistoric organisms is called a ''chemofossil''. Objects made by prehistoric people are called [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] but these are not fossils. 
 
 Even when the remains of soft-bodied animals are gone, there may be impressions, molds or [[carbon]] traces which remain permanently. So, in special cases, we can see fossils of even small, soft invertebrate animals.  
 
 Sometimes a fossil is produced because of dryness ([[desiccation]]), [[freezing]], or [[pine]] [[resin]]. [[Mummy|Mummified animals]], [[ice]]-covered wooly [[mammoth]]s, and [[insect]]-filled [[amber]] are examples of such fossils. 
 
 [[Living fossil]]s, however, are ''not'' fossils at all. Instead, they are modern-day organisms which look like their prehistoric [[ancestor]]s of many millions of years ago. The [[ginkgo]] [[tree]], the [[coelacanth]] and the [[horseshoe crab]] are good examples. 
 
 == Early notice taken of fossils == 
 Many pre-scientific peoples noticed fossils, but not all thought they were the remains of living things. Perhaps the first to leave a record of his thought was the [[Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Xenophanes]] (about 570 < small > BC < /small > –470 < small > BC < /small > ). < ref > Guthrie W.K.C. 1962. ''A history of Greek philosophy''. vol 1: The earlier [[presocratic]]s and the [[pythagoreans]]. Cambridge. < /ref > < sup > p. 387 < /sup >  His ideas were reported by later writers: 
 : " Shells [are] found in the midst of the land, and on mountains. In the [[quarry|quarries]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] the impressions of a fish and seaweed have been found; on [[Paros]] the impression of a bay-leaf in the depth of a stone, and on [[Malta]] the flattened shape of sea-creatures [have been found]. These, he says, were formed when everything, long ago, was covered in mud, and the impression dried out in the mud " . Guthrie p. 387 
 
 These ideas were rediscovered in the 17th century in Europe. [[Nicolas Steno]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Robert Hooke]] at the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] both wrote and gave lectures about fossils. In the 18th century fossil-collecting began, and serious thinking on [[geology]] began to make progress. In the 19th century geology became a modern science, and fossils played a part in the theory of [[evolution]].
