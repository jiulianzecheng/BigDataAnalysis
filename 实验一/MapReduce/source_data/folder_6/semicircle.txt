[[File:Semicircle.svg|frame|A '''semicircle''' of radius ''r''.]] 
 In [[geometry]], a '''semicircle''' is a [[2D|two-dimensional]] geometric [[shape]] that forms half of a [[circle]]. Being half of a circle's 360° (360 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]), the [[arc]] of a semicircle always measures 180°. A [[triangle]] inscribed in a semicircle is always a [[right triangle]].
