 The '''Odacidae''' are a small family of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]] formerly classified within the order [[Perciformes]], commonly known as '''cales''', and '''weed whitings'''. They are related to the much larger families of the [[Wrasse|wrasses]] and [[parrotfish]]. More recent workers have classified this family within the order [[Labriformes]], alongside the [[Wrasse|wrasses]] and [[Parrotfish|parrotfishes]], within the clade [[Percomorpha]].
