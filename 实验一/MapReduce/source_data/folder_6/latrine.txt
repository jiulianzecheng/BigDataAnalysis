 A '''latrine''' is a [[toilet]] or an even simpler facility which is used as a toilet within a system of [[sanitation]]. For example, it can be a communal trench in the [[earth]] in a camp to be used as emergency sanitation, a hole in the ground (pit latrine), or more advanced designs, including pour-flush systems.
