 '''''Amborella trichopoda''''' is a small, [[evergreen]] [[shrub]]. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  It occurs only in the moist, shaded understory of [[montane]] [[forests]] on the [[South Pacific]] island of [[New Caledonia]]. The [[genus]] is the only member of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Amborellaceae''' and contains only this single [[species]]. < ref name= " :0 " > Große-Veldmann, Bernadette ''et al'' 2011. Amborella trichopoda — cultivation of the most ancestral angiosperm in botanic gardens. ''Journal of Botanic Garden Horticulture'' '''9''': 143–155. < /ref > 
 
 ''Amborella'' is of great interest to plant [[systematics|systematists]] because [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses put it at or near the [[Basal|base]] of the [[flowering plant]] lineage. < ref name=Soltis > Soltis, Pamela S.  &  Soltis, Douglas E. 2013. Angiosperm phylogeny: a framework for studies of genome evolution. In Leitch, Ilia J. ''et al'' ''Plant genome diversity''. vol 2, Springer, pp. 1–11. {{ISBN|978-3-7091-1160-4}} < /ref > < ref name=Pillon > Pillon, Yohan 2008.

 The Amborellaceae are distinctive. They are sprawling [[evergreen]] [[shrubs]] or small trees. Their tissue is different from any other [[Angiosperm]]. The xylem of ''Amborella'' contains only [[tracheid]]s; [[vessel element]]s are absent. < ref > Carlquist S.J.  &  Schneider E.L. 2001. Vegetative anatomy of the New Caledonian endemic Amborella trichopoda: relationships with the Illiciales and implications for vessel origin. ''Pacific Science'' '''55''' (3): 305–312. [http://muse.jhu.edu/article/28493/pdf] < /ref >  Xylem of this form has long been regarded as a  " primitive "  feature of flowering plants. < ref > Simpson, M. (2006). ''Plant systematics''. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Academic Press. < /ref > 
 
 Since ''Amborella'' is apparently [[basal]] among the flowering plants, the features of early flowering plants can be [[infer]]red. This is done by comparing [[derived]] [[traits]] shared by other angiosperms but not present in ''Amborella''. These traits are assumed to have evolved after the divergence of the ''Amborella'' lineage. 
 
 The Amborellaceae are a line of flowering plants that diverged very early on (about 130 million years ago) from all the other living species of flowering plants. Among living flowering plants, it is the [[sister group]] to all other flowering plants. < ref name=Soltis / > 
 
 == Its peculiarity == 
 ''Amborella'', an understory plant in the wild, is in contact with shade- and moisture-dependent organisms such as [[algae]], [[Lichen|lichens]] and [[Moss|mosses]]. Some [[horizontal gene transfer]] between these species is not surprising. But the scale of such transfer has caused great surprise. Sequencing the ''Amborella'' [[mitochondria]]l [[genome]] showed that for every gene of its own origin, it has about six versions from the genomes from other plants and algae growing with or upon it. The evolutionary and physiological significance of this is not yet clear.
