 The '''Utmankhel''' ({{lang-ur|اتمان خیل}}) are a [[Pashtun]] tribe who live in the hills to the north of [[Peshawar]] in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Their land lies between the Mohmands and the Ranizais of Swat, to the west and south-west of the junction of the Swat and Panjkora rivers. They claim to be descendants of Baba Utman Shamraiz, who accompanied [[Sher Shah Suri]] in his expedition into [[India]] . The Utman Khel are a tall, stout and fair race, but their dress and general customs have been assimilated by the neighbouring peoples of Bajour. Their land is very hilly and difficult, but has well cultivated in terraces. 
 
 The British conducted military campaigns against them in 1852, 1878, and 1898. < ref > {{EB1911|inline=1 |title=Utman Khel|volume=27 |pages=822-823 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/822/mode/2up}} < /ref >  They numbered some 40,000, and their fighting strength was about 8000 men.
