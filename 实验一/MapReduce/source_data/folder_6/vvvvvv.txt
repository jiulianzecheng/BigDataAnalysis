 [[File:VVVVVV - The Tomb of Mad Carew.png|thumb|left|If Viridian touches the spikes (red) or the ghost (green), he will die. Viridian can not jump over the spikes, but he can avoid them by changing gravity to walk on the ceiling.]] 
 In ''VVVVVV'', the player controls Captain Viridian, the main character. Viridian can not jump, but he can change [[gravity]] if he is standing on a floor. This lets Viridian fall up instead of down. The player can use this to move around dangerous things, such as spikes.
