 A '''dogma''' < ref > The plural is either '''''dogmata''''' or '''''dogmas''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{Polytonic|δόγμα}}'', plural ''{{Polytonic|δόγματα}}'') < /ref >  is something that should not be [[:wikt:dispute|disputed]] or [[:wikt:doubt|doubted]]. Most often, this means the basic [[belief]]s and [[doctrine]]s of a [[religion]].  What a majority of followers of an [[ideology]] or any kind of [[organization]] believe in can also be a dogma.  
   
 In the [[context]] of religion, the term has a [[:wikt:neutral|neutral]] meaning. Outside of religion for most people the term means something negative, because it accepts only a particular [[point of view]]. If someone disputes a religious dogma, they can be accused of [[heresy]]. 
 
 In [[Christianity]], the [[Resurrection]] of [[Jesus]] is a basic dogma.
