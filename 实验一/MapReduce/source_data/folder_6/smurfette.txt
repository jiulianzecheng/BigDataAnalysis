 '''Smurfette''' is the main [[protagonist]] in ''[[The Smurfs]]'' franchise. She is the only female [[smurfs|smurf]] in The Smurf Village. Most of the other smurfs like her because of her [[beauty]]. She is not the smartest smurf. Often she gets caught in traps while looking at herself in the [[mirror]]. She does not seem to have an attraction for many of the other smurfs. 
 
 Later other female smurfs appeared, although it is unclear how they came into being. 
 
 '''Smurfette''' usually wears a white [[dress]], white [[shoes]], a [[Smurf hat]] and white [[panties]] under her dress (her panties are shown in every Smurf movie for a brief amount of time and a few times in the cartoon series), but in the [[comic book]] story  " You Don't Smurf Progress " , Smurfette is shown wearing her pink [[lingerie]], and people speculate that she also owns a few [[frilly panties]] (due to her personality), but it is still unknown if she actually does or not.
