 An '''arrowhead''' is point of an [[arrow]], or a shape resembling such a point.[http://www.uwlax.edu/MVAC/educators/Glossary/MP.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311053906/http://www.uwlax.edu/MVAC/Educators/Glossary/MP.htm |date=2010-03-11 }} 
 
 Arrowheads are found all over the United States.  Archaeologically they are usually made of stone: primarily being [[flint]], [[obsidian]], or [[chert]]; but in many excavations [[bone]], wooden and metal arrowheads have been found.   
 
 In [[North America]],  Arrowheads are sometimes mistakenly attributed to the Historic Period American Indians, but are actually from North America's [[prehistoric]] ancestors; some arrowheads date back to over 15,000+ years old (Paleo-Clovis Culture).   
 
 In [[Scandinavia]] during the [[Viking]] age a wide range of arrowheads were used for a variety of tasks. 
 
 Arrowheads are attached to arrow [[shaft]]s and may be  " thrown "  (similar to a spear thrower), or fired from a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]].
