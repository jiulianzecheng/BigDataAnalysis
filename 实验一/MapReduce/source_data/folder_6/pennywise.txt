 '''Pennywise''' is an American [[melodic hardcore]] band. They formed in [[Hermosa Beach, California]] in 1988. The band is named after the monster from [[It (monster)|It]], [[Stephen King]]'s novel [[It (novel)|of the same title]]. Pennywise's most successful line-up, which remained together for 13 years (from 1996 to 2009), consisted of [[Jim Lindberg]] (vocals), [[Fletcher Dragge]] (guitars), [[Randy Bradbury]] (bass) and [[Byron McMackin]] (drums). They kept their original line-up until original bassist [[Jason Thirsk]] killed himself in 1996, because he had issues with his alcoholism. After that Bradbury replaced him. In August 2009, Lindberg left Pennywise and was replaced by [[Ignite (band)|Ignite]] singer [[Zoli Téglás]]. 
 
 Pennywise has released nine studio albums. After releasing two EPs in 1989, the band signed to [[Epitaph Records]] (a label owned by [[Bad Religion]]'s [[Brett Gurewitz]]) in 1990. Their two first albums were not very successful. Pennywise's next album, ''[[About Time]]'', became a mainstream success. It was the band's first album to appear on the top 100 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[music chart]] and chart outside the United States. By this time, a number of punk bands, such as [[Bad Religion]], [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[NOFX]], had hit the mainstream, but Pennywise did not want to be signed to a major label. When Bradbury joined in 1996 following Thrisk's death, Pennywise made even more popular albums and eventually became [[celebrity|celebrities]]. 
 
 Their best known song is [[Bro Hymn]] form their self-titled debut album. After Thirsk's death, the band made a new version of this song as a tribute to Jason Thirsk which appeared on ''Full Circle''.
