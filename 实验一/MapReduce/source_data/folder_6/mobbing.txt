'''Mobbing''' is a special type of [[consensus]] [[bullying]] [[behavior]].  It is about an imbalance of social, physical or other power involving a group or a person. 
 
 Mobbing is like a  " virus "  or a  " cancer "  that spreads via [[wikt:gossip|gossip]], [[wikt:rumour|rumour]] and [[wikt:innuendo|innuendo]]. Mobbing is developed or pushed by a leader who persuades others into a systematic [[pattern]] of  " mob-like "  behaviour toward the target. < ref name= " shallcross " > Shallcross, Linda ''et al.''
