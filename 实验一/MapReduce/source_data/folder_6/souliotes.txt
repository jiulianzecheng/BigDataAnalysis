 ==History== 
 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[oppression]] forced Greek [[Herding|herder]]s in Epirus to flee to the mountains during the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century. < ref > {{harvnb|Protopsaltē|1983|p=5–6, 23}}. < /ref >  There, they built a [[confederation]] of [[village]]s called the ''Tetrachori'' ({{lang-gr|Τετραχώρι}},  " Four Villages " ) also known as ''Souli''. < ref > {{harvnb|Protopsaltē|1983|pp=5–6}}. < /ref >  The Souliotes resisted Ottoman rule during the 18th century. < ref name=Protopsaltē26–27 > {{harvnb|Protopsaltē|1983|pp=26–27}}. < /ref >  They later participated in the Orlov Revolt, a failed Greek anti-Ottoman [[uprising]] that happened in the 1770s. < ref name=Protopsaltē26–27/ >
