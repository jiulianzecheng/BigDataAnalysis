[[File:Walking reflection.jpg|thumb|A reflection on sand and water|230px|left]]'''Reflection''' is the change in direction of a [[Wave (physics)|wave]] at a boundary between two different [[media]], so that the wave moves back into the medium it came from. 
 The most common examples include the reflection of [[light]], [[sound]] and [[Mechanical wave|water waves]]. 
 
 [[File:Reflection angles.svg|frame|Diagram showing specular reflection]] 
 Specular reflection is a [[mirror]]-like reflection of light from a surface, in which light from a single incoming direction is reflected into a single outgoing direction. In the diagram to the right, a light ray is coming from the point P, and meets at the mirror at point O. The ray reflects at the point O outwards in the same medium towards point Q. Reflection is measured relative to a line through point O that is at 90Ëš to the mirror. The [[angle]]s made by the light ray (shown in the diagram as  < math > \theta _i < /math >  and  < math > \theta _r < /math > ) must be equal. Both angles have to be equal whenever reflection occurs. This is known as the  " law of reflection " . 
 
 People make many things to use reflections, including reflecting [[telescope]] < nowiki/ > s, [[radar]], [[sonar]], and [[lidar]] and putting light reflectors on things they want to see.
