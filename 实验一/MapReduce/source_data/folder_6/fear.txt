 '''Fear''' is a feeling or an [[emotion]]. When a person has fear, they are '''afraid''' or '''scared'''. A person who fears something does not want it to happen. The fear response comes from sensing [[danger]]. It leads to the [[fight-or-flight response]]. In extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) there may be a freeze response or paralysis. 
 
 In humans and animals, fear is adjusted by [[cognition]] and [[learning]]. Thus fear is rational or appropriate, or it is irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a [[phobia]]. 
 
 Fear is the body's way of [[protect]]ing itself from doing things that may be [[wikt:danger|dangerous]]. For example, if one has a fear of jumping off a [[cliff]], he/she will not do it. This saves one from death. In this case, fear is a good thing but in others, it can be bad. An example of fear being bad is if it stops one from doing something important, like going to see a doctor. Methods of controlling phobias include facing the fear over and over so the effect of the phobia becomes less until it stops being a phobia.
