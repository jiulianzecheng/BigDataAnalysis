 === The Boohball === 
 One of the common things in ''Boohbah'' is the Boohball. The Boohball, a glowing white ball, is where the Boohbahs live, and it appears out of nowhere in various parts of the show. It travels from country to country when it is called by children. Inside the Boohball is a set of pods on a round, spinning  base, where the Boohbahs recharge energy. It looks like five fuzzy ladle-like charger pods with the handles linked; and, alternate, pods are the Boohbahs' beds or they look like five fig halves. The energy is created by the laughter of the children when playing with the Boohbahs, the Boohball, and the Storypeople.
