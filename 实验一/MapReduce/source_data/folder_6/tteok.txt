 Koreans eat Tteok depending on the season. On the first day of the year, they make ''Garaetteok'' which is shaped like a long white [[cylinder]] because it looks like a white thin thread that represents a long life generally in [[Asian]] culture. Sliced Garaetteok is used for making a soup named [[Tteokguk]]. In March, women make small sweet Korean [[pancake]]s called ''Hwajeon'' with flowers. They use flowers such as [[azalea]]s and chrysanthemums. On Chuseok holiday, Korean [[Thanksgiving Day]], Koreans make ''Songpyeon''. They dough rice flour and stuff [[sesame]], or chestnut into each. After they put it in, they shape it into a half moon.
