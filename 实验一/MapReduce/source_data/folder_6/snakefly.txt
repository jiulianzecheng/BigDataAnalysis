 The '''Snakeflies''' ('''Raphidioptera''') are a small [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[Endopterygote]] [[insects]]. They are closely related to the [[Megaloptera]] and [[Neuroptera]]. < ref name= " Jepson2008 " > {{cite journal |last1=Jepson |first1=J.E. |last2=Jarzembowski|first2= E.A. |year=2008 |title=Two new species of snakefly (Insecta:Raphidioptera) from the Lower Cretaceous of England and Spain with a review of other fossil raphidiopterans from the Jurassic/Cretaceous transition |journal=Alavesia |volume=2 |pages=193–201 |url=http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Jepson_Jarzembowski_2008_Alavesia_SnakeflyLowerCretaceousEnglandSpain.pdf |access-date=2011-06-10 |archive-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202102/http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Jepson_Jarzembowski_2008_Alavesia_SnakeflyLowerCretaceousEnglandSpain.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   
 
 There are about 210 living [[species]]. They are easily recognized by their small head and long 'neck', which is actually the elongated [[prothorax]].  
 
 The snakefly, about 15 & nbsp;mm (0.6 & nbsp;inch) long, has two pairs of similar, net-veined wings, long [[antenna]]e, and chewing mouthparts. The female lays eggs with a long [[ovipositor]]. 
 
 == Life cycle == 
 The [[life cycle]] includes [[Egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and adult. The active and [[carnivorous]] larvae live beneath loose tree bark. The snakefly is found on every [[continent]] except [[Australia]] and may be beneficial to humans because it destroys the larvae and pupae of other insects. < ref > Aspöck, H. 2002.
