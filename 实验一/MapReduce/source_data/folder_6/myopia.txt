[[File:Myopia-2-2.svg|thumb|Myopia-2-2]]'''Myopia''', also called '''near-sightedness''' or '''short-sightedness''', is a problem with the [[focus]]ing ability of the [[eye]]. It is when the eye is not able to focus properly on objects in the distance. This condition is very common and it often occurs with many members of the same family. It happens when the [[Lens (eye)|lens]] becomes a different shape (too curved) from usual, or when the eye is longer than normal, so light entering the eye focuses on a point ''in front of'' the [[retina]], rather than right on it. This makes distant objects look blurry. People with myopia often [[wikt:squint|squint]] while watching [[television]] or trying to see distant objects. Sudden myopia can often be the first [[symptom]] of [[Diabetes|Type II Diabetes]].  
 
 In most cases, it can be fixed easily using [[glasses]], [[contact lens]]es, or [[surgery]].
