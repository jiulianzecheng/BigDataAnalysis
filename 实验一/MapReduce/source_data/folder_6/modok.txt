 '''MODOK''' (also written as '''M.O.D.O.K.'''; an acronym for '''M'''ental/'''M'''obile/'''M'''echanized '''O'''rganism '''D'''esigned '''O'''nly for '''K'''illing) is a fictional character. It appears in American comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #93 (September 1967). A creation of the villainous society known as '''A.I.M.''', he used to be a A.I.M. scientist named '''George Tarleton''' but was forcibly mutated into a grotesque and horrific monster/machine both in appearance and attitude. A.I.M. origanally wanted to use him as their weapon but he took them over instead. 
 
 He became a major reccurring antagonist for both [[Captain America]], agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], The [[Hulk (Marvel Comics)|Hulk]], agent [[Sharon Carter]], and even some villains such as [[Doctor Doom]].
