 In common usage, '''saving''' generally means putting money aside, for example, by putting money in a bank [[savings account]] or investing in a [[pension]] plan. It involves using less money or not using money at all. 
 In a broader sense, saving is typically used to refer to economizing, cutting costs, or to rescuing someone or something.
