 A '''swan''' (''Cygnini'') is a kind of water [[bird]], from the [[genus|genera]] ''Cygnus'' and ''Coscoroba''. They are in the [[subfamily]] Anserinae, in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Anatidae]], which also includes [[goose|geese]] and [[duck]]s. 
 
 Many swans live in colder places, such as northern [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. They live on [[water]]. They swim on top of the water and eat [[plant]]s off the bottom of [[pond]]s, [[lake]]s, or [[ocean]]s. They also eat [[insect]]s and other small [[animal]]s. A baby swan is called a cygnet. 
 
 Swans are tough, strong birds who will stand no nonsense from dogs or cats. They may open their wings as a warning, but from then on a person is advised to keep clear. Swans are highly protective of their nests. They will attack anything they see as a threat to their chicks, including humans.  
 
 == Description == 
 The swans are some of the largest [[flying]] birds. They are large in size and have large feet and long necks. The males are usually bigger and heavier than females. The [[mute swan]], [[trumpeter swan]], and [[whooper swan]] are the largest swans. They can be over 1.5m (60 inches) long. They can weigh over 15kg (33 pounds). Their [[wingspan]]s (this means the length of both wings) can be almost 3m (10 ft).  
 
 Most swans are white. They are found in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. This means they are found in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. However, the [[black swan]] is black with a red [[beak]]. It lives in [[Australia]].  The black necked swan has white flight feathers, and black outer feathers. It lives in [[South America]]. They also have a small area of skin between the eyes and beak that has no [[feather]]s. This area can be different colors, such as yellow (for example, on a [[Bewick's swan]]) or orange (for example, on a mute swan). 
 
 Wild swans [[migration|migrate]].  They spend the cold part of the year eating and getting fat in one place and move to a warmer place to lay eggs and raise chicks, called cygnets. < ref name= " NIOO "  / > 
 
 The [[coscoroba swan]] is different to the other swans. Some scientists think it is more like a duck or a goose. It is the smaller than the other swans. This swan lives in [[South America]]. 
 
 ==Climate change== 
 
 Bewick's swans used to spend a lot of time in Ireland and Britain and the Netherlands, but scientists say they have been moving east into Germany.  They spend less time in their winter feeding grounds than they did in 1970.  Scientists say they are following the changes in temperature in Europe.  The scientists found that individual swans do not change where they like to go during their own lifetimes.  Instead, different generations of swans go to different places from their parents and grandparents. < ref name= " NIOO " > {{cite press release|title=Where have the swans gone?|date=June 12, 2020|accessdate=June 12, 2020|url=https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/press/where-have-swans-gone|publisher=Netherlands Institute of Ecology|author=Netherlands Institute of Ecology|archive-date=April 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427151043/https://nioo.knaw.nl/en/press/where-have-swans-gone|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " Shifts " > {{cite journal|doi=10.1111/gcb.15151|title=Concurrent shifts in wintering distribution and phenology in migratory swans: Individual and generational effects.|author1=Rascha J.
