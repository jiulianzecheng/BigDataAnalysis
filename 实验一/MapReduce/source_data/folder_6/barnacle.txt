 A '''barnacle''' is a '''cirripede''', a kind of [[crustacean]]. It is covered with hard plates of [[calcium carbonate]], and lives stuck to hard surfaces. 
 
 It does not look like a crustacean, and for many centuries it was thought to be a [[mollusc]]. In the 1830s, J.V. Thompson found their [[larva]]e, and followed their development through to their adult form. They have a [[nauplius]] larva, typical of crustaeans. < ref > Thompson J.V. 1830. On the cirripedes or barnacles; demonstrating their deceptive character; the extraordinary metamorphoses they undergo, and the class of animals to which they indisputably belong.

Discovery of the metamorphoses in the second type of cirripedes, viz., the Lepades, completing the natural history of these singular animals, and confirming their affinity with the Crustacea.

 Barnacles grow on hard surfaces like [[pier]]s, [[boat]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and on other animals such as [[turtle]]s and [[whale]]s. Barnacles are a different group from [[crab]]s and [[shrimp]]s. They are considered a nuisance to the shipping industry and private boat owners. 
 
 == Life-style == 
 Barnacles are [[filter feeder|suspension feeders]], sweeping small food into their mouth with their curved 'feet'. They are [[cement]]ed to [[Rock (geology)|rock]] (usually), and covered with hard [[calcareous]] plates, which they shut firmly when the [[tide]] goes out. The barnacles reproduce sexually, and produce little [[nauplius]] [[larva]]e which disperse in the [[plankton]]. Eventually, the larvae change into [[cypris]] form, and attach on other hard surfaces to form new barnacles. Their [[comparative anatomy]] was worked out in detail by Charles Darwin. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Barnacles have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/crust/barnbiol.html |publisher=Museum Victoria |title=Biology of Barnacles |year=1996 |access-date=2010-07-26 |archive-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217160059/http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/crust/barnbiol.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  A few forms have become fully [[parasite|parasitic]] on larger crustacea. 
 
 Barnacles are by far the commonest animals on rocky sea shores. Their numbers on a shore in the [[Isle of Man]] have been estimated as a thousand million (10 < sup > 9 < /sup > ), and they produce body material of 12 hundrededweight (~600 & nbsp;kg) of tissue, weighed after drying. Each year they let go a huge number of larvae, estimated as a million million (10 < sup > 12 < /sup > ). < ref > Yonge C.M. 1948. ''The sea shore''. New Naturalist series, Collins, London. < /ref > < sup > p110 < /sup > 
 
 == Darwin's work == 
 Darwin set his work out in four parts: There were the barnacles on stalks (pedunculated), and those that sat on hard substrate (the sessile barnacles). Each of these was divided into living and fossil barnacles.
