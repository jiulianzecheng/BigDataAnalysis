 ==History== 
 [[File:Portmeirioncastle.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A photograph of Castell Deudraeth which is located at Portmeirion]] 
 Portmeirion looks a lot like the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Portofino]]. But, [[Clough Williams-Ellis]], who created Portmeirion, always said that it was ''not'' based on the city of Portofino. He said he did want it to look like it was a place near the [[Mediterranean]], though. < ref > ''Follies: a National Trust Guide''] Cape, 1986. p.156 < /ref >  He designed and built the village between the years of 1925 and 1975. The mix of architecture in the village is believed to have influenced [[postmodernism]] architecture in the late 1900s. 
 
 An old [[estate (house)|estate]] used to be located on the property before Portmeirion was built. It was called ''Aber Iâ'' ({{lang-cy|Ice estuary}}). The hotel and three [[cottage]]s, which are named  " White Horses " ,  " Mermaid " , and  " The Salutation " , are part of the original estate. It was built in the 1850s. Before the estate, there was a [[foundry]] and a [[boatyard]] on site. There is also an old site which has a small group of remains from a [[mediaeval]] [[castle]] nearby. 
 
 In 1931, Williams-Ellis bought a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[mansion]] from his [[uncle]] [[Williams baronets|Sir Osmund Williams, Bt]]. It was called Castell Deudraeth. Williams-Ellis planned on having the mansion be a part of the hotel. Lots of problems and the war did not allow that to happen. Williams-Ellis loved the building a lot and did anything he could to make it a part of the hotel. He received money from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], the [[European Regional Development Fund]], and [[Wales Tourist Board]]. This money allowed him to finally open Castell Deudraeth as a hotel with 11 bedrooms and a restaurant on August 20, 2001. [[Bryn Terfel]] performed at the opening. 
 
 There are a lot of [[rhododendron]]s at Portmeirion, which are part of gardens that go throughout the land. The gardens were started before Williams-Ellis lived there. They were started by [[George Henry Caton Haigh]]. An English [[Charitable organization|charity]] owns Portmeirion, today. It is still a hotel. There is also a cafe, cottages for rent, shops, a [[tearoom]], and a restaurant. 
 
 [[Lewis Mumford]] has written a lot about Portmeirion. He wrote a lot about it in his book, ''The Highway and the City'' in 1964. < ref name=mumford > [[Lewis Mumford|Mumford, Lewis]].
