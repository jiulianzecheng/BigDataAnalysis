'''Dynamics''' is the study of [[force]]s and their effects on [[movement|motion]] over [[time]]. It is a branch of [[classical mechanics]]. 
 
 [[Isaac Newton]] developed [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] that are fundamental to dynamics. 
 
 Some people consider dynamics to be made up of [[kinematics]] and [[kinetics]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath692/kmath692.htm|title=Kinematics and Dynamics in Special Relativity|author=Kevin Brown|access-date=2019-01-20}} < /ref >  Others consider dynamics and kinematics to be separate, and do not use the word kinetics. < ref > {{citation|last=Bingham|first=G.P.|title=A Note on Dynamics and Kinematics|journal=Haskins Laboratories Status Report on Speech Research|year=1988|volume=93|pages=247â€“251|s2cid=18441298}} < /ref >  Under the second view, kinematics is about describing how a system is at the moment, and dynamics is about how and why the system changes with time. < ref > {{cite book|first=Ramamurti|last=Shankar|title=Fundamentals of Physics: Mechanics, Relativity, and Thermodynamics|publisher=Yale University|page=3|year=2014|isbn=978-0-300-19220-9}} < /ref >
