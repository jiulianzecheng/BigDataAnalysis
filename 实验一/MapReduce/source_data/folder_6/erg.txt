An '''erg''' is a unit of measurement or energy or work that is the same as 10 < sup > -7 < /sup >  [[joules]]. It formed part of the [[centimetre-gram-second system of units]] (CGS system of measurement which is no longer used).  
 
 An erg is about the amount of work done (or energy consumed) by one common [[housefly]] performing a  " [[press-up]] " , the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up.  < ref > Filippenko, Alex, ''Understanding the Universe'' (of ''The Great Courses'', on DVD), Lecture 44, time 24:30, The Teaching Company, Chantilly, VA, USA, 2007 < /ref >
