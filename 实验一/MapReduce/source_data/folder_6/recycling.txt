 '''Recycling''' is when you recover [[scrap]] or [[waste]]  and reprocessing the material into useful products. [[Glass]], [[paper]], [[plastic]], and [[metals]] such as [[aluminum]] and [[steel]] are often recycled. Dead [[plant]]s, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through [[compost]]ing.  
 
 It is important not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out. < ref name=Lifeogy > {{cite web|url=http://lifeogy.com/recycling-advantages-disadvantages/|title=Recycling Advantages  &  Disadvantages|date=21 March 2018 |publisher=Lifeogy|access-date=2018-03-21}} < /ref > 
 
 Recycling reduces trash in [[landfill]]s and [[Incineration|incinerators]]. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and [[energy]] used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, ''[[The Economist]]'' says. Recycling can reduce your [[carbon footprint]] and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world 
 
 The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. 
 
 == Plastic recycling == 
 
 Most people make about two kilograms of waste (trash) every day, and about 7% of this waste is made up of [[plastic]] [[wikt:product|products]] that can be recycled. Today, plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables, park benches, and even high-chairs. < ref name=slush > {{cite book | title = Earth Science| url = https://archive.org/details/holtsciencetechn00na_0| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| isbn = 0-03-055667-8}} < /ref > 
 
 === Sort it out === 
 First, plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center, where it is ''sorted out''. When plastic is sorted out by hand, [[symbol]]s have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used. Nowadays, machines can sort out the plastic automatically. There are different types of plastic, for example ''[[polyethylene]]'', ''[[polypropylene]]'', ''[[polystyrene]]'', and ''[[polyethylene terephthalate]]''. There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic: ''high density polyethylene'' (HDPE), and ''low density polyethylene'' (LDPE). HDPE plastic is usually used to make [[milk]] bottles and bottles for [[shampoo]] or [[detergent]]s. LDPE plastic are usually things like [[toothpaste]] tubes, plastic bags, and films for packaging. Polypropylene plastic is used to make [[bucket]]s, plastic [[box]]es, and [[flower pot]]s. Polyethylene terephthalate is the material from which [[water]] and [[soft drink]] bottles are made. 
 
 === Grinding  washing === 
 
 HDPE plastic is [[wikt:grind|ground]] into a small powder. < ref name=slush/ >  LDPE plastic, which are usually thin films, need to be ground by a special machine. < ref name=slush/ >  After that, both plastics are washed with hot water and [[detergent]]. < ref name=slush/ >  Dirt and other things, like labels, are taken off. < ref name=slush/ >  After the wash, the powder is dried with hot air. < ref name=slush/ > 
 
 Sometimes, the powder is sold. But other times, the powder is heated, colored, and then put into a ''[[Pelletization|pelletizer]]''. < ref name=slush/ >  The [[Pelletization|pelletizer]] makes the powder into little [[:wikt:pellet|pellets]], which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic  " wood " . < ref name=slush/ >  This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots, trash cans, pipes, picnic tables, benches, toys, mats, and many other things. < ref name=slush/ >
