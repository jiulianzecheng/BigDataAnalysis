 An '''altarpiece''' is a work of art that has been made to go above the [[altar]] in a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[church]]. An altarpiece can be a painting, or it can be carved from wood or stone. Some altarpieces have both [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s. 
 
 ==Subject matter== 
 [[Image:Temmes Altarpiece.jpg|thumb|This sad image of ''the Crucified Christ'' is in a small church in Northern [[Ostrobothnia]]. It was painted by Carl Christoffer Stadig 1847. Beneath the main picture he has shown ''the Last Supper'']] 
 What do altarpieces show? 
 
 There are three most common subjects, ''The Virgin Mary and Christ Child'', ''Jesus crucified'' and ''Christ in Glory''. These are three very important parts of Christian belief. 
 
 Altars of [[Madonna and Child|The Virgin Mary and Christ Child]] were made to remind Christians that [[God]] came to Earth as [[Jesus]], in the form of an ordinary helpless little baby, to grow up among people. These altarpieces are to remind Christians of the [[Christmas]] story. 
 
 Altarpieces of [[Crucifixion|Jesus on the cross]] were made to remind Christians that Jesus, who was pure and did not sin, died a horrible death like a robber and murderer so that Christians could be forgiven. These altarpieces are to remind Christians of the [[Easter]] story. 
 
 Altarpieces that show [[Christ in Glory|Jesus sitting on a throne in Heaven]] were made to remind Christians that they need to put their lives right and turn to God because one day they will see him on his [[throne]]. These altarpieces are to remind Christians that they never know when their life might end and they should live every day in a way that pleases God. 
 
 ===Saints and stories=== 
 Many altarpieces, as well as having one of the three main scenes, may have lots of other figures or lots of other small scenes. 
 
 The other figures are usually [[Canonization|saints]]. They might be shown standing around a throne where the Virgin Mary sits with Baby Jesus on her knee. Or they might be painted on separate pieces that are joined to the middle part of the altarpiece. These saints do not have to be people who were alive at the same time as Mary. They are more often the [[patron saint]] of the church or the favourites saints of the person who paid for the altarpiece. 
 
 Smaller [[rectangle|rectangular]] parts of the altarpiece often have stories painted in them. They may be stories from the [[Bible]] telling the life of Jesus, or they might tell the life of a saint. 
 
 ==Size== 
 How big are altarpieces? 
 
 An altarpiece can be as small as a tiny painting put on the wall above a table in someone's home. Or it can be so big that it fills the wall of a huge [[cathedral]]. The word is usually used for artworks which are quite big. A small painting may be called a ''Holy Picture'' or an ''[[Icon]]''. 
 
 ==Large altarpieces== 
 [[Image:Chapel of Mus√©e d'Unterlinden with Isenheim altarpiece.jpg|thumb|250px|The chapel of [[Unterlinden Museum]] with ''The Isenheim Altarpiece''.]] 
 * ''The Isenheim Altarpiece'' in Colmar, [[France]] was painted by a [[Germany|German]] artist, Matthias Grunewald. At the centre is a terrifying and horribly real scene of Jesus on the Cross. Other scenes show the joy of Jesus' birth and the glory of him rising from the [[grave]]. 
 * ''The Ghent Altarpiece'' in Ghent Cathedral, Belgium, is a wonderful painted ''polytych''. This means it is in lots of pieces which are hinged and can be closed. It shows [[Christ in Glory]] and has many beautiful figures which include [[Adam and Eve]]. It was painted by [[Jan van Eyck|Jan and Hubert van Eyck]]. 
 * ''The Great Screen'' of [[Winchester]] Cathedral is a huge carved altarpiece made to replace an ancient one that was ruined in the 1600s. It has Christ on the Cross at the centre, surrounded by rows of carved saints. There is another altarpiece like this in [[Southwark]] Cathedral, [[London]]. 
 * ''The Maesta'' painted by [[Duccio]] which is no longer in [[Siena]] Cathedral in [[Italy]] but is now in the cathedral's museum. This altarpiece has the ''Virgin and Child'' at the centre, surrounded by rows of saints. On the back were many small pictures telling the story of Jesus, but they have all been taken off and are shown separately. 
 * ''The Transparente'' in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] Cathedral in [[Spain]] is an amazing sight. It is a huge altarpiece caved of white [[marble]] with gold decoration. In the roof above it, there is a hidden window which lets bright light shine in to light it up.
