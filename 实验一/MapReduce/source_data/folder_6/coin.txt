 A '''coin''' is a piece of [[metal]] that is used as [[currency]], or money. The earliest coins were in [[Lydia]], in what is [[Turkey]] today, in 7th Century [[BC]]. They were made from [[Electrum|electrum]], an [[alloy]] found in riverbeds. < ref > The remarkable items that have been used as currency [https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zfx2m39#xtor=CS8-1000-Discovery_Cards]. BBC. < /ref >   
 
 Most people use coins as [[currency]]. They usually have lower value than [[banknotes]]. Most are made in government [[Mint (money)|mints]]. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 Many coins have unique or complicated decorations; one side often has the picture of a king or ither important person's [[head]] on it.  
 
 The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things [[random]]ly. This is called  " tossing a coin " .  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called  " heads " , if the other side is facing up it is called  " tails " . Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. Tossing a coin can be a type of [[gambling]], which is [[illegal]] (against the law) in some [[country|countries]]. 
 
 == Collecting == 
 {{main|Coin collecting}} 
 Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like [[copper]]. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.
