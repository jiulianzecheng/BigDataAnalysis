 '''Titus''' (Titus Flavius Vespasianus, 30 December 39 – 13 September 81) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 79 to 81. A member of the [[Flavian dynasty]], Titus succeeded his father [[Vespasian]] upon his death. < ref name=Dio > Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#18 LXVI.18].

 == Military service == 
 Before becoming emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander. He served as a military tribune in Germany and [[Roman Britain]]. 
 
 It was he who brought the reinforcements after the revolt of [[Boudicca]]. Two tribes had destroyed [[Colchester]], [[London]] and [[St Albans]], and wiped out a whole legion, but were finally defeated by the Roman governor of Britain. 
 
 === Judaea === 
 He served under his father in [[Judea|Judaea]] during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] (66–70), where he commanded a [[legion]]. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor [[Nero]] in 68, but soon continued in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]]. 
 
 When Vespasian was declared emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he successfully laid [[siege]] to Jerusalem. He destroyed the city and [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. For this, Titus was awarded a Roman [[triumph]]. < ref > Josephus, Flavius 1981. ''The Jewish War'', transl. G.A. Williamson, introduction by E. Mary Smallwood. Penguin, London. < /ref >  To this day, the [[Arch of Titus]] commemorates his victory circa AD 70. 
 
 == Rome == 
 When Vespasian became Emperor, Titus and his brother [[Domitian]] received the title of ''Caesar'' from the Senate. < ref name= Dio2 > Cassius Dio. ''Roman history'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#1 LXV.1] < /ref >  Titus held seven [[Roman consul]]ships during Vespasian's reign < ref name= " suetonius-titus-6 " > [[Suetonius]], ''On the Life of the Caesars'': Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#6 6] < /ref >  and acted as his secretary, appearing in the Senate on his behalf. < ref name= " suetonius-titus-6 " / > 
 
 Under the rule of his father, Titus gained [[notoriety]] in Rome as a ruthless Prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]]. 
 
 === Berenice === 
 During the Jewish wars, Titus had begun a love affair with [[Berenice (daughter of Agrippa I)|Berenice]], sister of [[Agrippa II]]. The [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodians]] had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion, and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian upon his campaign to become emperor. < ref > [[Tacitus]], ''Histories'' [[wikisource:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 2#81|II.81]] < /ref > 
 
 In 75, she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife. The Romans were wary of her, and disapproved of their relationship. When the pair was publicly denounced by [[Cynic]]s in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away, < ref name=Dio3 > Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#66-15 LXV.15] < /ref >  but his reputation suffered. 
 
 == Emperor ==

 Titus ruled to great acclaim after the death of Vespasian in 79. He was considered a good emperor by [[Suetonius]] and other contemporary historians. 
 
 As emperor, he is best known for completing the [[Colosseum]] and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the [[Mount Vesuvius#Eruption of 79 AD|Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79]] and a fire in Rome in 80. 
 
 Because of his supposed [[vice]]s, many Romans feared he would be another Nero. < ref name=Suet > [[Suetonius]], ''Twelve Caesars'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#7 7] < /ref >  But Titus proved to be an effective emperor and was well-loved  when people found that he had [[virtue]]s instead of vices. < ref name=Suet/ >  One of his first acts as an emperor was to stop trials based on treason charges, < ref name=Suet2 > [[Suetonius]], ''Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#8 8] < /ref >  which had long plagued Rome. 
 
 Under [[Augustus]], the law of [[treason]] had been revived and applied to cover [[slander]] and [[libel]]. This led to a long cycle of [[trial]]s and executions under such emperors as [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]] and Nero. This [[spawn]]ed entire [[network]]s of [[informer]]s who terrorized Rome for decades. < ref name=Suet2/ >  Titus put an end to this practice, against himself or anyone else, declaring: 
 
 < blockquote > " It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way. For I do naught that deserves censure, and I care not for what is reported falsely " . < ref name= " dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19 " > Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#19 LXVI.19] < /ref > < /blockquote > 
 
 Consequently, no [[Roman Senate|senator]]s were put to death during his reign; < ref name= " dio-romanhistory-lxvi-19 " / >  he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]]  " for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained " . < ref name= " suetonius-titus-9 " > [[Suetonius]], ''Twelve Caesars'', Life of Titus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#9 9] < /ref >  The informers were publicly punished and [[Exile|banished]] from the city. Titus then made it unlawful for persons to be tried under different laws for the same offense (double jeopardy|). < ref name=Suet2/ >  Finally, when Berenice returned to Rome, he sent her away. < ref name=Suet/ > 
 
 After barely two years in office, Titus died of a [[fever]] on 13 September 81. He was [[deified]] (declared a god) by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother [[Domitian]].
