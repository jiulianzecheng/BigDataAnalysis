 The '''amniotes''' are a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] group of [[animal]]s: all the [[tetrapod]]s except the [[amphibians]]. 
 
 They are the land [[vertebrate]]s which lay [[cleidoic egg]]s. < ref > Mammalian embryos have the same structures. < /ref > 
 
 Two super-groups make up the amniotes: the [[Synapsida]] ([[Pelycosaur]]s, [[Theriodont]]s and [[mammal]]s) and the [[Sauropsida]] (all [[reptile]]s, including [[dinosaur]]s and [[bird]]s). 
 
 The [[embryo]]s of amniotes are either laid as [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] or develop in the female. These embyros are protected by several [[membrane]]s, and have a much larger food supply than amphibian eggs. 
 
 The 'invention' of the [[cleidoic egg]], and its embryonic membranes, is the main reason why the eggs of an amniote do not need to be laid in water. 
 
 Thus, as distinct from the [[amphibian]]s, ''amniotes are truly terrestrial''. Secondarily, many reptiles and mammals returned to water, and mammals bear the young live, as do some reptile groups. This [[evolution]]ary flexibility is much less common in amphibians. 
 
 ==Evolutionary history== 
 The first amniotes, such as ''[[Casineria]]'', looked like small lizards. They [[evolution|evolved]] about 340 million years ago, in the [[Mississippian]] or Lower [[Carboniferous]]. Their eggs could survive out of the water. This let amniotes move into [[environment]]s that had less [[water]]. The amniotes moved across the [[Earth]]. Most vertebrates that live on land are amniotes, as are most of the air-breathing animals of the sea. 
 
 Very early in the evolutionary history of amniotes, they split into two main lines, the '''[[synapsids]]''' and the '''[[sauropsids]]''', both of which persist into the modern era. 
 
 The oldest known fossil synapsid is ''[[Protoclepsydrops]]'' from about 320 million years ago, while the oldest known sauropsid is probably ''[[Paleothyris]]'', in the order [[Captorhinida]], from the Middle [[Pennsylvanian]] epoch (about 306–312 million years ago). 
 
 ===Eggs=== 
 One can assume the ancestors of the amniotes laid their eggs in moist places, as such modest-sized animals would not have difficulty finding depressions under fallen logs or other suitable places in the ancient forests, and dry conditions were probably not the main reason why the soft shell emerged. < ref > Stewart J.R. 1997. Morphology and evolution of the egg of oviparous amniotes. In: S. Sumida and K. Martin (eds) ''Amniote origins: completing the transition to land''. London: Academic Press. 291-326 < /ref > 
 
 In fish and amphibians there is only one inner membrane, also called an embryonic membrane. In amniotes the inner anatomy of the egg has evolved further and new structures have developed to take care of the gas exchanges between the embryo and the atmosphere, as well as dealing with the waste problems. To grow a thicker and tougher shell required new ways to supply the embryo with oxygen, as [[diffusion]] alone was not enough. 
 
 After the egg developed these structures, further sophistication allowed amniotes to lay much bigger eggs in much drier habitats. Bigger eggs allowed for bigger offspring, and bigger adults could produce bigger eggs, so amniotes grew bigger than their ancestors. Real growth was not possible, however, until they stopped relying on small [[invertebrate]]s as their main food source and started to eat plants or other vertebrates, or returned to the water. New habits and heavier bodies meant further evolution for the amniotes, both in behavior and anatomy. 
 
 == Three groups == 
 There are three main lines of amniotes, which may be distinguished by the structure of the [[skull]] and in particular the number of [[temporal fenestra]]e (openings) behind the eye. In [[anapsid]]s (turtles) there are none, in [[synapsid]]s (mammals and their extinct relatives) there is one, and in most [[diapsid]]s (non-anapsid reptiles, including dinosaurs and birds) there are two. < ref name=Romer > Romer A.S.  &  Parsons T.S. 1985. ''The vertebrate body.'' 6th ed, Saunders, Philadelphia. < /ref > 
 
 The skeletal remains of amniotes have at least two pairs of [[sacrum|sacral]] [[rib]]s, a [[sternum]] in the [[pectoral girdle]] (shoulders area) and an [[astragalus]] bone in the [[ankle]]. < ref name=gauthier > Gauthier J; Kluge A.G. and Rowe T. 1988. The early evolution of the Amniota.  In Benton M.J. (ed) ''The phylogeny and classification of the tetrapods'', volume 1: amphibians, reptiles, birds. Oxford: Clarendon Press. 103-155 < /ref > 
 
 ==Classification== 
 A simplified [[phylogeny]] of tetrapods goes like this: 
 *Vertebrates 
 **[[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish) 
 **[[Tetrapod]]s 
 ***[[Amphibia]] 
 ***Stem-group '''Amniotes''' 
 ****[[Synapsid]]s ([[therapsid]]s, [[mammal]]s) 
 ****[[Sauropsid]]s (all [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s) 
 
 This is perhaps better than the older taxonomy, which lists recent branches like birds and mammals as [[Class (biology)|classes]] on mere traditional grounds. < ref > Clack Jennifer A. 2002.

 ==Traditional taxonomy== 
 *'''[[Tetrapoda]]''' 
 **'''Amniota''' 
 ***Class [[Synapsid]]a – Mammal-like  " reptiles " 
 ****Class [[Mammal]]ia – Mammals 
 ***Class [[reptile|Sauropsida]] – Reptiles 
 ****Subclass [[Anapsida]] 
 **** (unranked) [[Eureptilia]] 
 ***** Family [[Captorhinidae]] 
 ***** Family [[Protorothyrididae]] 
 ****Subclass [[Diapsida]] 
 *****Class [[bird|Aves]] – Birds
