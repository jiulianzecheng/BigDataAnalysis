 A '''mudflow''' or '''mudslide''' occurs when [[mud]] [[travel]]s down a slope very quickly. Mudflows, which are like giant moving mud pies, happen when lots of water mixes with soil and rock. The water makes the slippery mass of mud flow quickly down. Mudflows happen most in [[mountain]]ous places where a long dry season is followed by heavy rains.  
 
 Mudflows of [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]] are the most dangerous, and are called '''lahars'''. A lahar is a type of mudflow or [[debris]] flow composed of a [[slurry]] of [[pyroclastic]] material, rocky debris, and [[water]]. The material flows down from a [[volcano]], typically along a [[river]] [[valley]]. < ref name= " usgsgloss " > {{cite web|url= http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/lahar.php|title=Lahar|work=USGS Photo Glossary|accessdate=2009-04-19}} < /ref >  Lahars can move as quickly as 80km/h and are as thick as liquid [[concrete]]. 
 
 Lahars have several possible causes: < ref name=usgswhat > {{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Lahars/lahars.html|title=Lahars and their effects|work=USGS Volcano Hazards Program|accessdate=2007-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824150316/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Lahars/lahars.html |archivedate = 2007-08-24}} < /ref > 
 * [[Snow]] and [[glacier]]s can be melted by lava or [[pyroclastic flow]]s during an eruption 
 * A [[flood]] caused by a glacier, [[lake breakout]], or heavy rainfall can release a lahar, also called glacier run 
 * Water from a [[crater lake]], combined with volcanic material in an eruption 
 Lahars can occur without volcanic activity, if conditions are right for the collapse and movement of mud from existing [[volcanic ash]] deposits. 
 * Snow and glaciers can melt during periods of mild weather 
 * [[Earthquakes]] underneath or close to the volcano can shake material loose and cause it to collapse triggering a lahar avalanche. 
 *[[Rainfall]] or [[typhoon]]s can cause slabs of solidified mud to come rushing down the slopes, with devastating results.
