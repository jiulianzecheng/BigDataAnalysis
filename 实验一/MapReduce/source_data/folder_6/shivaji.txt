His father Shri.Shahajiraje Bhosale was a  Maratha general  in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].  
 
 Most of the territory in Maharashtra was then under the possession of the Nizamshah of [[Ahmednagar]] and the Adilshah of Bijapur who were known as the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. The Adilshah of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shri. Shahajiraje Bhosale tried to rebel, but he could not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and the Adilshahi. The [[Nizamshahi]] kingdom came to an end in 1636. Thereafter Shri.Shahajiraje became a Sardar of the Adilshah of Bijapur and was posted in [[Karnataka]]. The region comprising [[Pune]], Supe, Indapur, and Chakan Parganas located between the Bhima and Nira rivers which were vested in Shri. Shahajiraje as a [[jagir]] was continued by the Adilshah. Shri. Shahajiraje was also given a jagir of [[Bangalore]]. Raajmata Jijabai and Chh. Shivaji Maharaj, stayed for a few years with Shri.Shahajiraje at Bangalore until Chh. Shivaji Maharaj was twelve years old. Shri. Shahaji entrusted the administration of the Lakshmi jagir to Chh.Shivaji and Mata Jijabai. Chh. Shivaji grew up amidst the hills and valleys of the [[Pune]] region under the guidance of his mother Raajmata Jijabai. His mother  taught him the stories of the [[Hindu]] epics and scriptures such as [[Mahabharata]] and also stories of old mighty Hindu kingdoms such as the [[Vijayanagara]]. He was also trained in guerrilla warfare. He defeated the Mughal forces of [[Rai Bagan]]. 
 
 ==Foundation of the Maratha kingdom== 
 [[File:Maratha Empire in 1758.png|thumb]]Several small spurs run eastward from the sahyadri in the Pune region. The extremely rugged valleys enclosed by these are usually known as the Mavals or Khores each named after the stream running through it, or after the principal village. Collectively they are known as the Mavals. The inhabitants of this region who are called the Mavalas were extremely hardy people. Shivaji Maharaj started the work of founding the [[Swaraj]] - self-rule - in this region. He used the geographical features of the Maval region. He created a feeling of trust and affection in minds of the people. Many associates, companions, and Mavalas joined him in his work of founding Swaraj. The objective of Shivaji Maharaj in founding the Swaraj is clearly expressed in his official seal or [[Mudra]] which is in [[Sanskrit]]. Through this Mudra, Shivaji Maharaj assured his people that  ‘ever-increasing like the crescent moon, the kingdom of Shivaji, son of Shahaji, will always seek the welfare of the people. 
 
 == The Royal Seal of Shivaji Maharaj == 
 [[File:Royal seals of Shivaji.jpg|thumb|147x147px]] 
 In the medieval period, forts carried much significance. With a firm hold over a fort, one could defend as well as control the surrounding area and could rule the land. In case of an enemy’s invasion, it was possible to protect the people taking shelter in the fort. The forts situated within the jagir of Shivaji Maharaj were not under his control but were under the control of Adilshah. An attempt to capture the forts meant to challenge the Adilshahi power. Shivaji Maharaj decided to acquire the forts that were within his jagir. He captured the forts of [[Murumbdev]] (Rajgad), [[Torna]], [[Kondhana]], and Purandar. This laid the foundation of the Swaraj. Shivaji Maharaj was steadily but cautiously aiming at extending and consolidating his power. Those sardars who appreciated his aim were brought to his side, but some sardars in the Adilshahi opposed him. It was necessary to bring them under control to found the Swaraj. 
 == The Capture of Javali == 
 The region of [[Javali]] in the [[Satara]] district was important. Many routes to the [[Konkan]] were through Javali. For the expansion of the Swaraj in the Konkan, it was essential to control that region. The region of Javali was ruled by [[Chandrarao More]], a powerful Sardar in the Adilshahi. Shivaji Maharaj attacked Javali and captured it in A.D. 1656. Then he also captured Rairi. This strong fort, later under the name of [[Raigad Fort|Raigad,]] was to become his capital. He built the Pratapgad fort in the Javali valley to protect the newly conquered territory and to control the [[Paar]] pass. The victory at Javali led to the expansion of the Swaraj in Konkan. Shivaji Maharaj then crossed the [[Ghats]] and descended into Konkan. He captured Kalyan and [[Bhivandi]] on the Konkan coast which were under the control of Adilshahi. Shivaji Maharaj also captured forts like Mahuli, Lohagad, Tunga, Tikona, Visapur, Songad, Karnala, Tala and Ghosala, in the Konkan. Shivaji Maharaj was able to command the coast line because of his acquisition of this territory in the Konkan. He came in contact with the Portuguese, the British and the Siddi powers on the western coast. The Siddi controlled the fort of Janjira and the areas around, including Danda-Rajpuri. Wherever in future these powers created obstacles in the work of expanding the Swaraj, Shivaji Maharaj tried to curb their activities. 
 
 == The Establishment of Maratha Navy == 
 [[File:Maratha ships scroll.jpg|thumb|334x334px]] 
 When Shivaji Maharaj became master of a long coastal strip, he thought it necessary to undertake the construction of a [[Navy|Navy.]] To protect his own territory from the Siddi, and to protect the merchant ships and ports in order to secure revenue  from maritime trade and customs duty, he concentrated on building the Navy. There were four hundred ships of various kinds in the Navy. They included [[Battleship|battleships]] like Gurab, Galbat and Pal. 
 
 == The defeat of Afzal Khan and the Battle of Javali == 
 Shivaji Maharaj had openly challenged the Adilshahi by capturing forts in his jagir and the territory in north Konkan. At that time the [[Badi Sahiba]] was looking after the administration of Adilshahi. She sent [[Afzal Khan]], a powerful and experienced Adilshahi General to stop Shivaji Maharaj. Afzal Khan set out from [[Bijapur]]  in May 1659. Afzal Khan made efforts to seek the support of the Deshmukh's. A meeting between Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan took place on 10th November 1659 at the foot of [[Pratapgad]]. When Afzal Khan  went to greet Shivaji Maharaj  stabbed him in the back with his dagger however Shivaji Maharaj had come prepared and he was wearing [[body armour]] so the dagger failed to pierce his skin. Shivaji Maharaj ripped at Afzal Khan's stomach with his weapon which is known as tiger-claws (''wagh-nakh'') and killed Afzal Khan. The Marathas destroyed Afzal Khan’s army in the dense forests of Javali. Shivaji Maharaj secured a large booty from Afzal Khan's camp which enabled him to consolidate and strengthen his position. 
 
 == The Expedition of Siddi Jauhar == 
 Shivaji Maharaj intended to capture as much of Adilshahi province and forts as possible. He captured the Adilshah forts of [[Panhala]], Vasantgad, and Khelna. He renamed Khelna as [[Vishalgad]]. In 1660, to check the rapid progress of Shivaji Maharaj, the Adilshah sent [[Siddi Jauhar]], the Sardar of [[Karnul]] region, with a large army against him. The Adilshah gave Siddi the title of ‘Salabatkhan’. Shivaji Maharaj took shelter in the Panhala fort. Siddi’s soldiers laid [[siege]] to the fort for about five months. Shivaji Maharaj was trapped inside the fort. Netaji Palkar made attempts to raise the siege by attacking Siddi’s army from outside. But Siddi showed no signs of relenting. Shivaji Maharaj opened overtures with him. This led to slackness in the siege around Panhalgad. Shivaji Maharaj escaped and went to Vishalgad. Siddi Jauhar’s army followed him. Shivaji Maharaj put Baji Prabhu Deshpande at the foot of Vishalgad and gave him the responsibility of stopping the Siddi’s army. Baji Prabhu Deshpande checked Siddi’s army at the Ghod pass near [[Gajapur]]. Baji Prabhu died a hero’s death in this battle. While going to Vishalgad, Shivaji Maharaj also crushed the opposition of the Adilshahi sardars- Dalvi of Palawan and Surve of [[Shringarpur]]. Maharaj reached Vishalgad safely. While Shivaji Maharaj was trapped at Panhala, the Mughal army had invaded the Swaraj. Shivaji Maharaj realized that it would not be prudent to fight two enemies at the same time. Therefore Shivaji Maharaj entered into a treaty with the Adilshah. As per the treaty, he returned the fort of Panhala to the Adilshah. 
 
 == Conflict with the Mughals: Shaista Khan’s Invasion == 
 For the expansion of the Swaraj, conflict with the Mughals was inevitable. Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] appointed his uncle [[Shaista khan]] to the viceroyalty of the Deccan, ordering him to invade Shivaji Maharaj’s dominions. Shaista khan left [[Ahmednagar]] in February 1660 and arrived in [[Pune]] on 10th May 1660. He decided to capture the fort of [[Chakan]] to obtain supplies. The Mughals captured the fort of Chakan. Shaista khan captured Swaraj's territories -Pune, Supe. He set up his camp at Lal Mahal in Pune. The Mughal army began to ravage the regions around Pune. Shaista khan adopted the strategy to occupy as much of Shivaji Maharaj’s dominions as possible. Forces were dispatched to invade the Konkan region below the Ghats. Kalyan and Bhiwandi were captured by the Mughal army. Shaista Khan appointed Kartalabkhan on an expedition to the North Konkan. Shivaji Maharaj humbled the Khan in Umbarkhind. Shivaji Maharaj left Netaji Palkar to defend the North Konkan and he marched southwards and captured Dabhol, Chiplun, Sangameshwar, Rajapur, Palavani, and Shringarpur. Two years had passed but Shaista khan still would not think of leaving Pune. Naturally, this harmed the population. Intending to drive Shaista khan out of Pune, Shivaji Maharaj devised a bold plan. On 5th April 1663, Shivaji Maharaj raided Lal Mahal. In this raid, Shaista khan lost his fingers. He left Pune and shifted his camp to [[Aurangabad]]. The successful attack on Shaista khan resulted in an immense increase in Shivaji Maharaj's prestige and fame. It also had an impact on the people and their faith in the capabilities of Maharaj was strengthened even further. 
 
 == The Surat Campaign == 
 In three years, Shaista Khan had ravaged the territories of the Swaraj. It was necessary to make up for this loss. [[Surat]] was the most prosperous port of the Mughal Empire on the west coast. The British, the Dutch and the French had their factories there. Shivaji Maharaj devised a plan of attack on Surat. The Subhedar of Surat could not put up any resistance to the Marathas. Shivaji Maharaj obtained enormous wealth from Surat. Surat's campaign was a stunning blow to emperor Aurangzeb’s prestige. 
 
 Soon after his return from Surat, Shivaji Maharaj embarked upon a vigorous naval program. Shivaji Maharaj had realized the importance of sea forts. Sea forts would protect the navy and keep in check the Siddi of Janjira and the Portuguese. He built [[Suvarnadurg]]. In 1664 he commenced the construction of Sindhudurg at Malvan. About the same time, he strengthened a fort named Vijaydurg. He also built a fort named [[Padmadurg]] on a small island in front of Rajpuri to counter the Siddi power. 
 
 == Jaisingh’s campaign against Shivaji Maharaj == 
 Intending to crush the growing power of Shivaji Maharaj, Aurangzeb sent [[Jaisingh]] of Ambar, an experienced and powerful Mughal Sardar. He left [[Delhi]] on 30th September 1664 and reached Pune on 3rd March 1665. Jaisingh's strategy was to isolate Shivaji Maharaj from his neighboring powers so that he would get neither help nor support from them, to prevent him from breaking out into the Mughal territory, to devastate his homeland, and capture his forts. He was trying to provoke the Adilshahi against Shivaji Maharaj. Jaisingh was simultaneously instigating local rulers in the Karnataka against the Adilshah so that they would be unable to help Shivaji Maharaj. To the Portuguese of Goa and Vasai, the Dutch of Vengurla, the British of Surat, and the Siddis of Janjira, Jaisingh suggested that they should start a naval campaign against Shivaji Maharaj. He also drew up a plan of capturing the forts in possession of Maharaj. Jaisingh and Dilerkhan led siege to the fort of Purandar. Mughal forces were sent to various parts of Swaraj. Maharaj tried to resist the Mughals. When the Mughals put the fort of Purandar under siege, Murarbaji Deshpande fought with the greatest of courage. He died a hero’s death. Realizing that in this conflict with the Mughals, he and his subjects had to face great losses, Maharaj began talks for a treaty with Jaisingh. A treaty between Jaisingh and Maharaj was signed in June 1665 which is known as the ‘[[Treaty of Purandar]]’. Under the terms of the treaty, Maharaj ceded twenty-three forts and adjacent areas yielding a revenue of four lakh hons to the Mughals. He also assured the Mughals of help against the Adilshahi. 
 
 == Visit to Agra == 
 Jaisingh’s campaign against the Adilshahi proved unsuccessful. Jaisingh and Aurangzeb felt that if the Adilshah, the [[Qutubshah]], and Shivaji Maharaj joined forces against the Mughals, it would be a great setback to the Mughal policies in the Deccan. Both of them felt that Shivaji Maharaj ought to be kept away at least for some time from Deccan politics. Jaisingh proposed to Shivaji Maharaj that he should visit Agra and meet the Emperor. After making thorough arrangements to ensure effective administration of his dominions during his absence, Shivaji Maharaj went to Agra with his son Sambhaji and a few of his trusted people. He set out for Agra on 5th March 1666 and reached on 11th May 1666. Aurangzeb did not treat Shivaji Maharaj with due honor at his court. Livid with rage, Maharaj walked out of the court instantly. Aurangzeb then put him under [[house arrest]]. Shivaji Maharaj escaped from Agra and safely reached Rajgad on 20th November 1666. While returning from Agra, he left Sambhaji at Mathura. Later, Sambhaji was brought safely to Rajgad. 
 
 == An offensive against the Mughals == 
 For about four years after his return from Agra, Shivaji Maharaj concentrated his attention on putting the affairs of Swaraj in order. He re-organized the army and carried repairs to forts. In 1670, Shivaji Maharaj started an offensive policy against the Mughals. His first aim was to clear his homeland of the Mughals. He also aimed at recapturing the forts and territories ceded to the Mughals according to the treaty of Purandar. The strategy followed by Shivaji Maharaj was to capture the forts by sending a well-equipped army on one hand and on the other hand to keep the Mughals unstable by invading the Mughal territories of the Deccan. Maharaj attacked [[Ahmednagar]] and [[Junnar]]. Sinhgad was the first fort to be recaptured on 4th February 1670. Shivaji Maharaj also recaptured  Purandar, Lohgad, Mahuli, Karnala and Rohida. Then he attacked Surat for the second time. On the way back he fought a battle with the Mughals at Vani-Dindori in [[Nashik]] district. He defeated Daud Khan in the battle. The Marathas under the leadership of Moropant Pingle captured [[Trimbakgad]]. The Maratha army then invaded [[Baglan]], a hilly district that was guarded by nine hill forts.  The Maratha army not only captured smaller hill forts of Baglan but also captured Mulher fort and Salher which lay on the border of [[Khandesh]] and [[Gujarat]]. Salher became a base of operations against the rich provinces of Gujarat and Khandesh. The Mughals tried to recapture Salher but failed. In 1672, Shivaji Maharaj’s army conquered the principality of [[Jawhar]] and then [[Ramnagar, Udhampur|Ramnagar.]] 
 
 == The offensive against the Adilshahi Sultanate == 
 Shivaji Maharaj decided to expand his dominions at the expense of the Adilshahi Sultanate. He captured the Panhala fort which was in the possession of Adilshah on 8th March 1673. Then he captured the fort of Parali near [[Satara]], fort of Satara, and forts like Chandan-vandan, Pandavgad Nandagiri, Kelanja, and Tathavda. 
 
 == Coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj == 
 The founding of the Maratha Swaraj involved a` relentless struggle for over thirty years. Maharaj realized that now the Swaraj needed to win general recognition as a sovereign, independent state. For legal recognition a formal [[coronation]] was necessary. On 6th June 1674, Shivaji Maharaj was [[Coronation|crowned]] at [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]] by Gagabhatt, a learned pandit of [[Benares|Benaras.]] He now became the Chhatrapati of the Swaraj. As a symbol of sovereignty, Shivaji Maharaj started a new era commencing from the date of his coronation. It is known as Rajyabhisheka shaka. Shivaji Maharaj thus became the founder of a new era. On the occasion of the coronation, special coins were minted- a gold coin called hon and a copper coin called Shivraj with the legend Shri Raja Shivachhatrapati inscribed on them. Thereafter, all royal correspondence carried the words, 'Kshatriyakulaawatansa Shri Raja Shivachhatrapati'. 
 
 == Shivrai == 
 A dictionary called Rajya-vyavahara-kosha, showing Sanskrit alternatives for Persian words was prepared. [[Sabhasad]], a contemporary [[Chronicle|chronicler,]] pointing out the significance of the coronation, writes ‘It was no mean achievement for a Maratha king to become such a great Chhatrapati’. The coronation of Shivaji Maharaj was a revolutionary event in the history of medieval [[India]]. Shivaji Maharaj had his second coronation performed under the guidance of Nischalpuri Gosavi. 
 
 == The Campaign of the South == 
 After the coronation, Shivaji Maharaj marched to the conquest of [[Phonda]] near [[Goa]] and captured it in April 1675. Then the Marathas captured [[Ankola]] and [[Shiveshwar]] which was followed by the annexation of [[Kolhapur]]. After that Shivaji Maharaj accomplished 'Dakshin Digvijay'. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj planned to carry his army to the east coast in the South and conquer the province of Adilshahi [[Karnataka]]. He undertook the Karnataka expedition in 1677. Karnataka was famous for its riches. It was ill-defended by the Adilshah. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj went to Golkonda to meet the Qutubshah. He entered into a treaty of friendship with him. In April 1677 he set out for the Adilshahi Karnataka. He captured [[Jinjee]] and proceeded to [[Vellore]]. The city withstood a long siege. The eastern portion of the south was mostly held by nobles of the Adil shahi kingdom. Vyankoji, Shivaji Maharaj’s stepbrother had carved out a principality for himself at [[Thanjavur]]. At [[Tirumalvadi]], on the northern bank of the [[Coleroon]], Vyankoji met Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Shivaji Maharaj tried to get Vyankoji to participate in the activities of the Swaraj. He did not get any response from him. Later, Maharaj conquered [[Bangalore|Bangalore,]] [[Hoskote]] in Karnataka, other forts such as those at Vellore, and also some parts of the Adil shahi kingdom. Permanent annexation in the south increased Maharaj’s strength and most importantly he was successful in executing his plan of defense which would help him to resist the armies of Aurangzeb in the future. For the administration of the newly conquered province, Shivaji Maharaj made excellent arrangements. He appointed Raghunath Narayan Hanamante, the chief officer to look after these newly conquered territories. After accomplishing the mission of the south, Shivaji Maharaj returned to Swaraj. 
 
 Shivaji Maharaj decided to fortify the island of [[Khanderi,]] commanded a key position as it was located near Mumbai. The British then decided to lay a regular siege to the island. In this naval conflict, the English had to withdraw their fleet. This brought to an end the naval conflict between Shivaji Maharaj and the British. 
 
 Within few months Shivaji Maharaj fell ill. After a short illness, he died at the Raigad fort on 3 April 1680. 
 
 == A Peoples’ King == 
 The Swaraj established by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj comprised of large areas of Nashik, Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, and Thane districts of [[Maharashtra]]. It also included parts of the Belgaum, Karwar, and Dharwad districts of [[Karnataka]] and Jinjee, Vellore, and their neighboring areas in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]]. He set up an efficient and sound system for the administration of this Swaraj. The administration was divided into eight departments. A minister was appointed as the head of every department. His council of eight ministers was known as the Ashta-Pradhan Mandal. Shivaji Maharaj followed a policy of encouraging agriculture. He paid attention to the welfare of the peasantry. He was also equally concerned about the growth of trade and the protection of industries. Thus he turned the Swaraj into a [[surajya]] a state which sought the welfare of all. He was a great military commander, an outstanding general, and a statesman. He had a clear concept of military organization. 
 
 His military organization consisted of infantry, cavalry, and navy. Strict discipline, rapid movements, excellent intelligence service, and continuous attention to defense marked his military organization. He used to take utmost care to protect his subjects especially at the time of enemy invasions. Shivaji Maharaj was also keen to see to it that the soldiers did not in any way cause any harm to the subjects. He followed a tolerant religious policy. The greatest achievement of Shivaji Maharaj was to inculcate the spirit of independence in his people. By his great deeds and achievements, Shivaji Maharaj created an altogether new order of things. Shivaji Maharaj’s personality and message are as relevant today as they were in the past.
