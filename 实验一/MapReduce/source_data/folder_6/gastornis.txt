 '''''Gastornis''''', formerly known as '''''Diatryma''''', is an extinct [[genus]] of large flightless [[bird]]s. < ref > In a 1992 survey, Larry Martin did not agree they were the same genus: Martin L.D. 1992.

 In the 1870s, the famous American [[paleontologist]] [[Edward Drinker Cope]] discovered another, more complete set of fossils in [[North America]], and named them ''Diatryma''. < ref name=Cope > Cope, Edward Drinker 1876.

 The fossil remains of these birds have been found in western-central Europe ([[England]], [[Belgium]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]) as well as [[North America]]. Their life style is in [[dispute]]. < ref > See discussion in Feduccia, Alan 1999. ''The origin and evolution of birds''. 2nd ed, Yale. p231–239. < /ref > < ref name=footprints/ > 
 
 == Description == 
 ''Gastornis parisiensis'' measured on average 1.75 metres (5.7 ft) tall, but large individuals grew up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) tall. ''Gastornis'' had a huge beak with a slightly hooked top, which possibly suggests that it was carnivorous. ''Gastornis'' had large powerful legs. It had large feet with small talons. Fossil footprints suggest it was a herbivore. < ref name=footprints > Warwicker, Michelle 2012. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/20413665  " Giant Eocene bird was 'gentle herbivore', study finds. " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123121245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/20413665 |date=2012-11-23 }} ''BBC Nature''. < /ref > 
 
 ==Paleobiology== 
 === Distribution === 
 Although North American and Europe were separated by the end of the [[Cretaceous]], there must have been a landbrige still in place somewhere. This is because the European and North American ''Diatryma''s were so similar. Other bird and mammal [[genera]] also occur on both sides of the (present-day) North [[Atlantic]] in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]]. This is evidence that Europe and North America were once connected by dry land in part of the early [[Cainozoic]]. < ref name=Andors2 > Andors V.A. 1992. Reappraisal of the Eocene groundbird ''Diatryma'' (Aves: Anserimorphae). ''Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Science Series''. '''36''', 109-126. < /ref > 
 
 === Palaeoecology === 
 At the time, the environment where ''Gastornis'' lived had dense forest and a moist to dry [[subtropical]] or even [[tropical]] [[climate]]. North America and Europe were still rather close. [[Greenland]] was  probably covered with lush woodland and grassland. Only narrow [[strait]]s of a few 100 & nbsp;km at most would have blocked landbound dispersal of the ''Gastornis'' ancestors. Land in North American was connected. Their European range was an [[archipelago]], with the [[Alps]] building up, and high [[sea level]]s in the [[Palaeocene|Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]]. [[Geographical]]ly, it was roughly similar to today's [[Indonesia]]. 
 
 The majority view is that ''Gastornis'' was a predator. However, some doubt the bird was agile enough to catch fast-moving prey, and have doubts about the beak being right for carnivory. It may be that ''Gastornis'' was an [[ambush]] hunter, or used pack hunting techniques to pursue or ambush prey. If ''Gastornis'' was a predator, it would need some way of hunting prey through the dense forest.

 Alternatively, they may have been mainly scavengers, [[omnivore]]s or even [[herbivore]]s. The large beak of ''Gastornis'' would have been suited for crushing seeds and tearing off vegetation. < ref name=Andors1 > Andors V.A. 1991. Paleobiology and relationships of the giant groundbird ''Diatryma'' (Aves: Gastornithiformes). ''Proceedings of the Twentieth International Ornithological Congess'', 563-571. < /ref >  It seems rather big for a purely vegetarian diet. Regardless of what these birds ate, the beak may have been used also for social display – its presence in all known fossils argues against a sexual display role. These contradicting [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], which can't be separated by the [[evidence]], make the paleobiology of ''Gastornis'' unclear. 
 
 Similar gigantic birds of the Cenozoic were the [[South America]]n [[terror birds]] ([[Phorusrhacidae|phorusrhacids]]) and the Australian mihirungs (''[[Dromornis]]''). The former were certainly carnivorous, and the latter are suspected of being predators, too. On the other hand, [[ratite]]s, the flightless giant birds of our time, feed on plants, small vertebrates, and [[invertebrate]]s.

 ''Gastornis'' were among the largest, if not ''the'' largest birds alive during the [[Paleogene]]. They had few natural enemies or serious competitors. If these huge birds were active hunters, they must have been important apex [[predator]]s which dominated the [[forest]] [[ecosystem]]s of North America and Europe until the middle Eocene.  
 
 The mid-Eocene saw the rise of large [[creodont]] and [[mesonychid]] predators in Eurasia and North America. The appearance of these new predators coincides with the decline of ''Gastornis'' and its relatives. This was possibly due to an increased tendency of mammalian predators to hunt together in packs (especially in the [[Hyena|hyaena]]-like creodonts). We know of no bird which weighed more than half a [[metric]] [[ton]]. Perhaps they could not evolve to larger sizes. If so, they could not compete by sheer bulk as some mammals can do. 
 
 ==Trace fossils== 
 In late Paleocene deposits of [[Spain]] and early Eocene deposits of France, shell fragments of huge [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] have turned up in [[Provence]]. < ref name = ds+ft > {{aut|Dughi R.  &  Sirugue F.}} 1959. Sur des fragments de coquilles d'oeufs fossiles de l'Eocène de Basse-Provence [On fossil eggshell fragments from the Eocene of Basse-Provence]. ''Les Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences'' '''249''': 959-961 [Article in French]. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3201c PDF fulltext] at Gallica; {{aut|Fabre-Taxy, Suzanne  &  Touraine, Fernand}} 1960. Gisements d'œufs d'Oiseaux de très grande taille dans l'Eocène de Provence [Deposits of eggs from birds of very large size from the Eocene of Provence]. ''Les Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences'' '''250''': 3870-3871 [Article in French]. [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k750m PDF fulltext] at Gallica. < /ref >  These are presumably from ''Gastornis''.  
 
 Some of these fragments were complete enough to reconstruct a size of 24 by 10 & nbsp;cm (about 9.5 by 4 & nbsp;inches) with shells 2.3–2.5 & nbsp;mm (0.09–0.1 & nbsp;in) thick. This is roughly half again as large as an [[ostrich]] egg, and very different in shape from the more rounded [[ratite]] eggs.
