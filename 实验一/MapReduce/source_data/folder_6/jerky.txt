 '''Jerky''' is lean and trimmed [[meat]] that has been cut into strips and dried (dehydrated) so it will not [[food spoilage|spoil]]. Normally, the drying includes adding [[salt]]. It prevents the growth of [[bacteria]] before the meat has finished the dehydrating process. The word ''jerky'' is from the [[Quechua]] word ''ch'arki''. The word means  " dried, salted meat " . < ref > {{cite web|title=Globe Trotting: Ecuador|publisher=The Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2006/07/15/2003318976|accessdate=May 30, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 Store-bought jerky often has sweeteners, like [[brown sugar]]. 
 
 Jerky is ready-to-eat, does not need to be prepared further and can be stored for months without being chilled. 
 
 Most [[fat]] must be trimmed from the meat before drying. Fat increases the chance of spoilage. (Modern [[vacuum packing]] and [[preservative]]s have helped stop these risks.) The meat must be dried quickly during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry.
