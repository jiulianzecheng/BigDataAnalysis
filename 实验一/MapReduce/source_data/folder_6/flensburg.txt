It is next to the border with [[Denmark]]. About 90,164 people live in Flensburg. The city has a [[university]]. A very well known part of Flensburg is [[Mürwik]]. There lies a small navy harbour.

 ==History== 
 There was a first settlement about 1200 A.D., which became a city in 1284. In the following [[century]], Flensburg became the [[Economics|economic]] centre of the [[Duchy]] of [[Schleswig]]. In 1409 there were battles between people of the Duchy of [[Holstein]] and the [[Denmark|Danish]] crown about the control of Schleswig. In 1412 and 1500 there were bad [[plague]]s in Flensburg. In 1485, there was a big fire in the city. 
 
 Between 1460 and 1864 Flensburg was the second most important [[harbour]] in Denmark after [[Copenhagen]]. Since the 16th century Flensburg was an important place for trade. Flensburg became part of [[Prussia]] in 1864, after the [[Danish-Prussian War]]. 
 
 In 1920, there was an [[election]] in Schleswig. The vote was to decide whether people wanted to belong to Denmark or Germany. Flensburg and regions south of the city decided to stay German, while regions north of the city chose to become Danish. 
 
 In 1945, many Germans were driven out of their homes in the eastern German provinces. These people went to Flensburg. The city had more than 100,000 inhabitants for a couple of years. Nowadays Flensburg has about 85,000 inhabitants.
