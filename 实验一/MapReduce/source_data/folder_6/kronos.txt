 '''Kronos''' ({{lang-el|Κρόνος}}, ''Krónos''; {{lang-la|CRONVS}}, ''Cronus''), is the leader of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and the Titan of time in [[Greek mythology]].  
 
 The son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother [[Earth]]) and [[Uranos|Ouranos]] (Father [[Sky]]), he was the youngest of his brothers. At the urging of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], Kronos castrated his father, Ouranos, with a sickle and overthrew him, ruling the cosmos as king during the so-called [[Golden age|Golden Age]]. Kronos married his sister [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and sired the first generation of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]]: [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Zeus]]. 
 
 In fear of a prophecy that told of him being overthrown by his own children, Kronos swallowed each of them as soon they were born. Only the youngest, [[Zeus]], managed to escape this fate and, after freeing his siblings, waged war against Kronos and the other Titans. During this Titanomachy, the Olympians emerged victorious, and Kronos himself was cast into [[Tartarus]]. In some versions, Kronos was later freed by Zeus and became ruler of the Elysian Islands.
