 '''Boscastle''' is a village and fishing port on the north coast of [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom, and 14 & nbsp;miles (23 & nbsp;km) south of [[Bude]] and 5 & nbsp;miles (8 & nbsp;km) north-east of [[Tintagel]]. < ref > Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 ''Bude  &  Clovelly'' {{ISBN|9780319231456}} < /ref > 
 
 The name of the village derives from Bottreaux Castle, a 12th-century fortress, of which little survives. There is no church in Boscastle but there are churches at Forrabury and Minster. Boscastle [[harbour]] is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir [[Richard Grenville]]. The oldest part of Boscastle surrounds the harbour; more modern residential building extends up the valleys of the Rivers Valency and Jordan. 
 
 A [[flash flood]] on 16 August 2004, caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses and elsewhere as the roads turned into rivers. < ref > [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/3570940.stm ''BBC news: Dozens rescued from flash floods''] Retrieved on 25 August 2008 < /ref > < ref > [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/interesting/20040816.html Met office] < /ref >  In the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK, 91 people were rescued and there were no deaths.
