The island is about 55 × 19 miles (90 × 30 & nbsp;km) in extent, the highest point being 108 & nbsp;ft (33 m) on East Hill. It encloses several lakes, most notably the 12-mile long Lake Windsor (also called Lake Rosa) which occupies nearly ¼ of the interior. The [[population]] of Great Inagua is 969 (2000 [[census]]).
