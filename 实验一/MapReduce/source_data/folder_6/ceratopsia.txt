 The '''Ceratopsia''' are the horned [[dinosaur]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Ornithischia]]. ''[[Triceratops]]'' is the best-known, and one of the largest. They are a group of [[herbivore|herbivorous]], beaked [[dinosaur]]s. They thrived in what is now [[North America]] and [[Asia]], during the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]].

 Ancestral forms of this group lived earlier, in the [[Jurassic]]. Early members, such as ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'', were small and [[bipedal]].  
 
 Later members, including ''[[Centrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'', became very large [[quadruped]]s. They developed elaborate facial [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a neck frill. The frill served mainly to protect the vulnerable neck from bipedal [[predation|predators]] like [[Tyrannosaurus]], who attacked from above.  
 
 The frill was no doubt also used in [[display (zoology)|display]], [[thermoregulation]], the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of those.  
 
 Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1 & nbsp;[[metre|meter]] (3 & nbsp;[[ft]]) and 23 & nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (50 & nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) to over 9 & nbsp;meters (30 & nbsp;ft) and 5,400 & nbsp;kg (12,000 & nbsp;lb). 
 
 ''Triceratops'' is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public. < ref name= " dodson1996 " > Dodson P. 1996. ''The horned dinosaurs''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. < /ref >
