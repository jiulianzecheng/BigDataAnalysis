 '''Tariqa'''  (or ''tariqah''; {{lang-ar|[[:wikt:طريقة|طريقة]]}} ''{{transliteration|ar|ALA-LC|ṭarīqah}}'') is an [[Islam|islamic]] term to describe the spiritual path of a [[Sufism|Sufi]]. The Sufi will take this path to get to the knowledge of Allah.  In a broader sense, it is the name for a group of Muslims following such a path. This group is called Sufi order. It has a ''murshid'' (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as ''muridin'' (singular ''murid''), meaning  " desirous " , viz.  " desiring the knowledge of [[God]] and loving God "  (also called a ''[[faqir]]''). Tariqa is also believed to be the same as Tzadik of [[Judaism]] meaning the  " rightly guided one " . The''y seek haqiqa'', which translates as  " ultimate truth " . 
 
 The first Tariqas were founded in the [[12th century|12th]] and [[13th century]] and many of them still exist today. The head of a Tariqas  is called a ''[[sheikh]]'', the disciples are called ''[[Dervish|dervishes]]''.
