 A '''brasserie''', in [[France]] and nowadays in [[Britain]], is a type of French [[restaurant]]. It has a relaxed setting, and serves single dishes and other meals. The word  " brasserie "  is also French for  " [[brewery]] " . In the beginning, it was used for the place where the beer was brewed. Often these places served the beer they brewed, together with a [[meal]].   
 
 A brasserie has professional service, printed [[menus]], and (traditionally) white linenâ€”unlike a [[bistro]] which may have none of these. Typically, a brasserie is open every day of the week and serves the same menu all day.
