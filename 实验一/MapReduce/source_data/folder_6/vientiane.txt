 The city has one of three universities in the entire country, the [[National University of Laos]]. 
 
 Despite being the country's most populated city, many international companies do not exist in Laos. There is no [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], [[KFC]], [[7-Eleven]], or [[Grab (company)|Grab]] throughout the entire country. However, international companies like Big C, Chester's Chicken, and Texas Chicken do exist in Vientiane. [[Starbucks]] opened its first store in the country at the [[Parkson Mall]] in 2022.
