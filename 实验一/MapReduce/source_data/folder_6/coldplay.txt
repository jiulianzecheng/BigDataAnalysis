 === Formation and first years (1996–1999) === 
 [[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] first met during their orientation week at [[University College London]] (UCL) in September 1996. The pair spent the rest of the college year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. < ref name= " all " / > [[Guy Berryman]], a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] promoters at small clubs. < ref name= " roach 19 " > {{Harvard citation|Roach|2003|p=19}} < /ref >  Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was studying [[classics]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], to be the band's manager. < ref > {{Harvard citation|Roach|2003|p=22}} < /ref >  Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group. < ref name= " Band name " / >   The band's lineup was completed when [[Will Champion]] joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and [[tin whistle]]; he quickly learned the drums, despite having no previous experience. < ref name= " all " / >  The band finally settled on the name  " Coldplay "  which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group. < ref name= " Band name " / >  By 1997, Martin had also met then Classics student [[Tim Rice-Oxley]]. During a weekend on [[Virginia Water]], they asked each other to play off their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, [[Keane]], was already operational. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. < ref name= " ColdplayParlophone " / > 
 
 In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety EP]].'' < ref name= " balance "  / >  Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label [[Fierce Panda Records|Fierce Panda]]. < ref name= " balance "  / >  Their first release was the three-track ''[[Brothers  &  Sisters (song)|Brothers  &  Sisters EP]]'', which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999. < ref name= " balance " > {{cite web|access-date=2008-05-04|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2003-02-02-coldplay_x.htm|title=Coldplay searching for a balance|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2003-02-13|author=Gundersen, Edna|archive-date=2011-07-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727033058/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2003-02-02-coldplay_x.htm|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 After completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed to [[Parlophone]] for a five-album contract in the spring of 1999. < ref name= " ColdplayParlophone " / >  After making their first appearance at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], the band went into studio to record a third EP titled ''[[The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room]]''. < ref > {{Harvard citation|Roach|2003|p=26}} < /ref >  Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October, < ref name= " roach 28 " > {{Harvard citation|Roach|2003|p=28}} < /ref >  and the single  " Bigger Stronger " , received [[BBC Radio 1]] airplay. The recording sessions for ''The Blue Room'' were tumultuous. Martin kicked Champion out of the band but later pleaded with him to return, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands such as [[U2]] and [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]], Coldplay decided that they would operate as democracy, and that profits would be shared equally. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used [[hard drugs]]. < ref name= " The Edge " > {{cite podcast

 At first, the band planned to record their debut album in the space of two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording to spread out between September 1999 and April–May 2000. < ref > Roach, p. 45 < /ref >  In March 1999, Coldplay began work on their debut album, recorded at [[Rockfield Studios]], [[Matrix Studios]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]] with producer [[Ken Nelson (British record producer)|Ken Nelson]], although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at [[Liverpool]]'s [[Parr Street]] Studios. The band worked in three studio rooms at Parr Street, and tracked much of the album in one of these rooms—the project studio which Nelson describes as  " basically a [[Demo (music)|demo]] room " . The album was mixed by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. Coldplay's record label had originally intended to use a mixing engineer for the tracks they picked as singles, but eventually hired Brauer to work on all songs for the album. < ref > Sam Inglis (October 2000).

 After the success of ''Parachutes'', Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', once again with Ken Nelson producing. The band started recording the album in London a week after the [[September 11 attacks]] in the [[United States]]. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording.  " [[In My Place]] "  was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album following a  " strange period of not really knowing what we were doing "  three months after the success of Parachutes. According to Martin  " one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming. " < ref > Cumberbatch, Franklin (2002-08-13).
