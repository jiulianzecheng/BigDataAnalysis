 '''Krakatoa''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] name: ''Krakatau'') is an [[active volcano]] in the [[Sunda Strait]], [[Indonesia]]. There are many different ways the name has been spelled. The [[volcano]] has [[Volcanic eruption|erupted]] repeatedly in known history. The best known of these events occurred in late August 1883. 
 
 On 22 December 2018 the central cone collapsed and caused a [[tsunami]] in the Sunda Strait. More than 400 people were killed. < ref > Amos, Jonathan 2018.

 == The 1883 eruption == 
 The 1883 eruption ejected more than six cubic [[mile]]s (25 [[cubic kilometer]]s) of rock, [[Volcanic ash|ash]], and [[pumice]], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/wwatch/volcanoes/witnesses.htm|title=Scholastic.com - Online Activities: Weather Watch|website=teacher.scholastic.com}} < /ref >   and made the loudest sound ever [[recording|recorded]] by [[human]] beings. The sound was heard as far away as [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in [[Australia]] (3,500 & nbsp;km; 2,200 & nbsp;miles), and the island of [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]] near [[Mauritius]] (4,800 & nbsp;km; 3,000 & nbsp;miles). < ref name= " Independent " > {{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article361665.ece|title=How Krakatoa made the biggest bang|date=2006-05-03|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=2012-03-20|location=London|archive-date=2007-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427083325/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article361665.ece|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Many thousands of people were killed and injured by the eruption, mostly in the [[tsunami]] (giant wave) which followed the explosion. 
 
 The pressure wave from the final explosion was recorded on [[barograph]]s around the world, which continued to register it up to 5 & nbsp;days after the explosion. The recordings show that the shock wave from the final explosion reverberated around the globe seven times. < ref name= " Symons88 " > {{cite book| editor = Symons G.J. | title = 'The eruption of Krakatoa and subsequent phenomena' (Report of the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society).

 The eruption destroyed two-thirds of what was then the island of Krakatoa. New eruptions at the volcano since 1927 have built a new island, called ''Anak Krakatau'' (child of Krakatoa).
