 '''Salisbury''' is a [[city]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[South West England]]. It is the only city in Wiltshire and is its second largest [[Human settlement|settlement]].  It sits at the joining of five rivers: the [[River Nadder|Nadder]], [[River Ebble|Ebble]], [[River Wylye|Wylye]], and [[River Bourne|Bourne]], which are [[tributary|tributaries]] to the [[River Avon|Hampshire Avon]], which flows to the south coast and into the sea at [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] in [[Dorset]]. 
 
 To the north of Salisbury is an old settlement surrounded by mounds and ditches for protection. It is called Old Sarum. Today there are only a few ruined stone foundations. This was the original town that was first occupied about 5,000 years ago. Experts think it was built there because it was close to the River Avon for water and it was near major trackways across the country. < ref > {{cite web
