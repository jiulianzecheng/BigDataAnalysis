 A '''chaplain''' is typically a [[priest]], [[pastor]], ordained [[deacon]] or other member of the [[clergy]]. They usually serve a [[group]] of [[people]] who are not organized as a mission or [[church]], or who are unable to attend church for many reasons, such as poor [[health]], confinement, or [[military]] or [[Civil law|civil]] duties. 
 
 Chaplains may be members of a Christian church, or followers of Judaism, Islam or humanism. Schools, colleges, prisons, hospitals, and the armed forces commonly provide the services of chaplains.
