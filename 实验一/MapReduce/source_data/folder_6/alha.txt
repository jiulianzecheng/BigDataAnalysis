'''Alha''' was a legendary [[Ahir]] < ref > {{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.530143|title=Abhiras Their History And Culture|last=Survavanshi|first=Bhagwansingh|date=1962|quote=The continuity of Abhira settlements of the Sindhu and the Sarasvati cannot be traced today. The absence of these settlements in the Puranic records shows that the Abhiras abandoned these places sometimes before the compilation of the Puranas. The Abhiras after being migrated from these regions moved towards east and south-east and settled in U.P. and Madhya Pradesh. Some of them got settled possibly on the bank of the hilly river which is called Sindhu today. This Sindhu emerges from the spurs of the Vindhyas, 10 miles to the north of Sironj and passing through the whole hilly track, falls into the river Yamuna near Jalaun. The Ahirs (Abhiras) occupy a prominent status there. The Ahir legends found throughout the ravines of this Sindhu throw light on the unrecorded history of the Abhiras. The famous balled Alhakhanda even in its modern form, though projected to reveal the glorious feats of the heroes Alha and Udala, yet could not refrain to acknowledge the turbulence of the people of Sindhu and Betwa who offered them many ferocious battles. The whole bed of the river Sindhu has thus stored numerous legends of strong Ahir-rule over the area. A tributary of the river Sindhu is called Ahirpat or Airavati, which meets Sindhu to the 15 miles south-}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6exhXmVQixUC & dq=famous+warrior%C2%A0+Ahir+chiefs+Alha+udal & pg=PA73|title=Archaeological Survey of India: Reports 1862-1884|date=1885|publisher=Governement Press|language=en|quote=The first building mentioned is commonly called Alha-ka Baitka, after the famous warrior Alha , whose achievements are sung all over these parts , and the tale extant regarding the Ahir chiefs, Alha and Udal, with their master Parmal, are almost without number.}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq6YvOM__nsC|title=Power and Influence in India: Bosses, Lords and Captains|last1=Price|first1=Pamela|last2=Ruud|first2=Arild Engelsen|date=2012-07-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-19798-7|language=en|quote=The symbolic equation between physical strength and political capacity is continuously expressed by informants with the aid of metaphors, parables and mythic narratives.

 ==Folklore== 
 '''Alha''' is an oral epic, the story is also found in a number of medieval manuscripts of the Prithviraj Raso and the Bhavishya Purana. There is also a belief that the story was originally written by Jagnik, bard of Mahoba, but no manuscript has yet been found. < ref name= " South Asian Folklore: " > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC & dq=Alha+folklore & pg=PA12|title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka Special -Reference|author=Peter J.

 H.A. Rose wrote in his book, '' " Some Indian Folklore in the Lay of Alha " '': {{quote|The lay of Alha (Alhakhand) is one of those indian poems which are mainly of values for the light they caste on IndianIndian ideas. While not altogether historically worthless, in that it uses historical men, and perhaps women too as its ''Dramatis personae'', it is patently a tendencious compilation, inculcating ''inter alia'' the proper way to behave to Jogis. But, its dominating theme is burning social question of the status to be allowed to the Banaphar (Ahir) family as [[Kshatriya]]. < ref name= " Folklore " > {{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1256383 | title=Some Indian Folklore in the Lay of Alha | publisher=Folklore Enterprises, Ltd. | author=H.
