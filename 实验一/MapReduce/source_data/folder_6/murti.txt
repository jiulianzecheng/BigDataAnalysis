In [[Hinduism]], a '''murti''' (also spelled murthi or murthy) usually means an [[image]] in which the Divine Spirit is expressed ('murta'). Hindus call the presence of [[Hindu Gods|God]] into the image so that they can communicate with him and receive his blessings.Hindus don't worship the murti or statue itself but the god who is present in their minds and souls. It can also be set up any where 
 
 ==Role of murtis in worship== 
 [[Image:Worship AS.jpg |200px|thumb|right|In [[Hinduism]], a devotee looks within and beyond the bronze [[Siva]] image to call on [[Hindu Gods|God]] in His spiritual body of [[light]].]]Murtis sometimes are abstract, but almost always [[stone]] or [[metal]] images of [[Hindu Gods|God]] in a human-like form like [[Shiva]] or [[Ganesha]], [[Rama]] or [[Krishna]], Saraswati or [[Kali]]. Murtis are made according to strict prescriptions and then installed by highly trained priests through a ceremony. The priests can then call on God in the image daily. 
 
 Murtis in [[Hindu]] [[ temples]] and shrines are a mystical form of communication with [[Hindu Gods|God]] and devas. This is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the [[telephone]]. One does not talk to the telephone; rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person. Without the telephone, one could not have a conversation across long distances; and without the sanctified image in the temple, one cannot easily talk with the Deity. 
 
 ==Going beyond murtis in Hinduism== 
 The image or murti of worship is a focus for prayers, although [[Hindu]]s can see [[Hindu Gods|God]] is in all things, in stone and water, fire, air and ether, in the enlightened person of a satguru and inside their own [[soul]]. Some temples do not have any murti in the sanctum but a symbolic diagram. Some Hindu branches reject the worship of images. 
 
 In Hinduism, one of the highest achievements is when one goes beyond the need of all form and [[symbol]]. This is the [[yogi]]’s goal obtained through [[meditation]].  < ref > Satguru [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]],  " ''Ten Questions people ask About Hinduism …and ten terrific answers!'' "  (p. 7) [http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411180040/http://www.himalayanacademy.com/basics/tenq/hindu10questions.pdf |date=2007-04-11 }} < /ref >  Hinduism is also one of the religions that uses more symbols to represent God in preparation for getting beyond them. 
 
 ==Sacred images in other religions== 
 Image worship appears to be an intelligent, mystical practice shared by all of the world’s great religions. All religions have their symbols of holiness: the [[Christian]] [[cross]], or statues of Mother Mary and Saint Theresa, the holy Kaaba in [[Mecca]], the Sikh Adi Granth enshrined in the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the [[Arc]] and [[Torah]] of the Jews, the image of a meditating [[Buddha]], the [[totemism|totems]] of indigenous and [[Pagan]] faiths, and the artifacts of the holy men and women of all religions. Any Christian respects the [[Bible]] and considers it sacred. His book and the [[Hindu]]’s murtis are similar in this way.  
 
 Critics of image worship consider this practice  " [[idolatry]] " . People who practice idolatry believe that God is the material object itself. Instead, Hindus worship murtis to call on the presence of the spiritual [[Hindu Gods|God]] and then communicate with him.
