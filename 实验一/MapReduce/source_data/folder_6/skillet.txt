 ==Career== 
 
 === Debut titled-album and the ''Gasoline'' music video (1996-1997) === 
 Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee [[progressive rock]] band Seraph, and [[Ken Steorts]], former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16a1p_gN0WA|title=Skillet –  " Alien Youth "  Album EPK|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 6, 2011}} < /ref >  Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label [[ForeFront Records]]. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut ''[[Skillet (album)|Skillet]]''. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a [[side project]]. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.

 Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled ''[[Hey You, I Love Your Soul]]'', which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their [[post-grunge]] approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.

Because of this change, the musical style on ''Invincible'' changed to a more electronic sound. < ref name= " Phantom Tollbooth " > {{cite web|url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2001/reviews/skillet.html|title=Skillet – a Review of The Phantom Tollbooth|publisher=Tollbooth.org|accessdate=September 6, 2011|author=Shari Lloyd}} < /ref >  Soon after the release of ''Invincible'' in 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and [[Lori Peters]] filled the drummer's position. 
 
 In late 2000 (several months after ''Invincible'' was released), The band released the worship album, and fourth album overall, ''[[Ardent Worship]]''.

A remix on  " Monster "  was featured on one of their popular podcasts.The song  " Hero "  was used in the publicizing of the first football game of the 2009 NFL season between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans, and the song  " Monster "  was used in the episode  " Jason: The Pretty-Boy Bully "  on MTV's Bully Beatdown.  " Monster "  was the theme song for the WWE event WWE Hell in a Cell while the song  " Hero "  was the theme song for WWE Tribute to the Troops and Royal Rumble 2010, as well as both songs being included on the official soundtrack for the WWE video game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010.  " Monster "  would also become the theme song for the AHL team the Lake Erie Monsters in Cleveland, Ohio, being played in the player intros and after a Lake Erie goal, and serves as the opening theme of the Fresno Monsters of Fresno, California.  " Monster "  was aired at the beginning of several ACC football games on Raycom Sports during the 2009 season. In the first week of April 2010,  " Monster "  was released for the Rock band music store in Rock Band 2[15] It also tied the record for highest-charting Christian album on the Billboard 200 with Underoath's 2006 release Define the Great Line and Casting Crowns' 2007 release The Altar and the Door, as all three albums debuted at No. 2.[16] 
 Skillet was nominated for six Dove Awards for the 41st Annual GMA Dove Awards.[17][18] Awake was certified gold July 2, 2010.[19][20] Also in 2010, Ardent released The Early Years, a collection of their songs from 1996 to 2003.

Kasica was with the band for 9 years, contributing to the albums Alien Youth, Collide, Comatose, and Awake as well as the live album Comatose Comes Alive. He played what was planned to be his last concert with the band on March 20 [23] but returned and continued touring until a new guitarist was trained.[24] On April 16, Seth Morrison replaced Kasica as the lead guitarist, and now tours full-time with Skillet.[25][unreliable source?]
