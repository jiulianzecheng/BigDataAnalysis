 Samarina is located on Mount [[Smolikas]], the highest of the [[Pindus]] range and the second-highest mountain in all of Greece, at an altitude of 1380–1515 meters. 
 
 ==History== 
 In 1917, Samarina participated together with other 12 villages in an attempt to create an autonomous area which much later was described as [[Principality of the Pindus]]. 
 
 Samarina was the birthplace of [[Alcibiades Diamandi]] and [[Nicolaos Matussis]], leaders of the [[Vlach  " Roman Legion " ]], who promoted a local autonomous Aromanian nationalist area during [[World War II]]. This was also called in some cases the [[Principality of the Pindus]], although this name is mainly used for the events of 1917 in Samarina.
