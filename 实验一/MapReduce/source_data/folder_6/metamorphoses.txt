'''Metamorphoses''' (''Metamorphoseon libri'', Books of Changes) is a work by [[Ovid]]. It was written about 1 AD to 8 AD. The work consists of 15 books of between 700 and 900 [[verse]]s of [[hexameter]]s. In it, Ovid describes the history of the world as it was seen by Roman and [[Greek mythology]].  
 
 Ovid selects those stories which happened often, a lower deity or a human is changed into an animal, a plant, or a star. The story starts with the beginning of the world, the [[flood]]. Only one couple survives the flood, Ducalion and Phyrrha. It ends with the change of the [[soul]] of [[Julius Caesar|Cesar]] into a [[star]].
