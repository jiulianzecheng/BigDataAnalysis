A '''kollel''' or '''kolel''' ({{lang-he|'''כולל'''}}), is an educational institute for [[Judaism]] at a higher level, focused on study of [[Torah]], [[Talmud]] and other [[rabbi]]nical writings. It differs from a [[yeshiva]] because most students at a kollel are married; they also get an allowance.
