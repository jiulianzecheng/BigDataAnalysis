 '''Kwashiorkor''' is a health condition of [[malnutrition|poor nutrition]] from not having enough [[protein]] in the diet.  If a person uses up [[energy]] from [[carbohydrate]]s (starches) and [[lipid]]s (fats), their body may begin to use protein for energy.  
 
 The body breaks down protein into energy that can be used. They then do not have enough protein for other needed bodily functions such as growth and building tissues like bones. Usually this is a condition of children from aged 1 to 5 years, but rarely adults and older children get it. It is common in poor places in Africa. Symptoms include having a pot belly, swollen face, and hair that is dark then light then dark. This can be cured by having a protein- rich diet. 
 
 Kwashiorkor comes from a protein deficiency (lack) in the diet. Body parts becomes swollen due to an accumulation of water in the spaces between the body's cells. Other symptoms are poor muscle development, swollen legs, puffy face, difficulty in eating, [[diarrhea]], and dry skin are the symptoms of this disease.
