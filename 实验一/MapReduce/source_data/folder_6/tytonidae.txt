 '''Barn-owls''' (family '''Tytonidae''') are one of the two [[family (biology)|families]] of owls.  The other is the [[true owl]]s, Strigidae. They are medium to large sized owls with large heads and heart-shaped faces. They have long, strong legs with powerful [[talon]]s. 
 
 The barn owls are a wide ranging family.  They are not found in northern [[North America]], [[Sahara]]n Africa and large areas of [[Asia]]. They live in a wide range of habitats from [[desert]]s to [[forest]]s, and from [[temperate]] latitudes to the [[tropics]]. 
 
 The barn-owls' main characteristic is the heart-shaped facial disc, formed by stiff feathers. The feathers help to amplify and locate the source of sounds when the bird hunts. [[Adaptations]] to the wing feathers eliminate sound caused by flying. This helps both the owl's hearing, and keeps the prey unaware of the owl. To summarise: the owl hunts mainly at dusk and night-time. Its uses sound to detect prey movement: its hearing is sensitive, and its wings are almost silent.
