A '''cryocooler''' is a [[refrigerator]] that is built to reach [[Cryogenics|cryogenic temperatures]]. These are [[Temperature|temperatures]] below {{Cvt|120|K|C|lk=on}}. These are most often smaller systems. They are normally small enough to sit on a table. Most cryocoolers have input powers less than about 20 [[Watt|kW]]. Some can have input powers as low as 2â€“3 W.  Most cryocoolers use a [[cryogenic fluid]] and moving parts to move the fluid around a [[thermodynamic cycle]]. The fluid is normally compressed at room temperature. It is precooled in a [[heat exchanger]]. The fluid is then expanded at some low temperature. When the low-pressure fluid returns, it passes through the heat exchanger to precool the high-pressure fluid before entering the compressor intake. The cycle is then repeated. 
 
 Large systems are more often called [[Cryogenic refrigerator|cryogenic refrigerators]]. These are used for cooling the [[Superconductor|superconducting]] [[Magnet|magnets]] in [[Particle accelerator|particle accelerators]].  Their input powers can be as high as 1 MW.
