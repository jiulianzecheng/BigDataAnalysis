'''Wayland''' was the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] [[deity|god]] of [[blacksmith]]s. In [[Anglo-Saxon]] writing, he appears in ''[[Deor]]'', ''[[Waldere]]'' and in ''[[Beowulf]]'' . The [[legend]] is shown on the [[Franks Casket]]. < ref > [http://homeros.godsong.org/FRANKS_CASKET.pdf Austin Simmons, ''The Cipherment of the Franks Casket'' (PDF)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303013402/http://homeros.godsong.org/FRANKS_CASKET.pdf |date=2012-03-03 }}  < /ref > 
 
 Wayland is connected with [[Wayland's Smithy]], a [[burial mound]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. This was named by the [[Saxon]]s, but it was there before them. The place has a [[superstition]] that says that if a [[horse]] is left there overnight with a small [[silver]] [[coin]] ( " groat " ), it would have new [[horseshoe|shoes]] by morning.
