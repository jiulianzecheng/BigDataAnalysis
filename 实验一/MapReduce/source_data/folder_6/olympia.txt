 Olympia was a [[sanctuary]], consisting of various buildings. These included a [[hippodrome]], [[Palaestra at Olympia|Palaestra]], [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and several temples. The [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] began here in 776 BC. They were founded by king [[Pelopas]]. They happened every four years, in the summers. All the ancient Greek towns competed. The winners of the Olympic games were important people. The Olympic games were abolished by emperor of Byzantium [[Theodosius I]], in 394 AD. 
 
 During [[ancient history]], Olympia was a powerful and rich town. It ruled over the west of Peloponnese. Olympia kept its strength and during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. During the [[Middle Ages]] it was an unimportant city. 
 
 === Gymnasium === 
 The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] at Olympia was a large, open air, quadrangle surrounded on all four sides by colonnades of the [[Doric order]]. Only the southern and eastern sides survive. They date to the second century BC. The River Kladeos has destroyed the western side. The gymnasium was used by runners and pentathlon athletes for training. Athletes trained in the [[Nudity|nude]]. In bad weather, training took place under the eastern colonnade (210.51 meters) and the other three colonnades. Little of the gymnasium has been excavated. About 200 BC, a portico of the [[Corinthian order]] was built to join the gymnasium and the [[Palaestra at Olympia|palaestra]]. 
 
 === Hippodrome === 
 The [[Hippodrome]] was the site of horse and [[chariot]] races at [[Olympia, Greece]]. It was 1,153 [[meter]]s long. It was south of the [[stadium]], but none of it survives. It was washed away by the Alpheios River.
