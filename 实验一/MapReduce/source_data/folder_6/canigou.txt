 The '''Canigou''' ({{lang-ca|Canigó}}) or '''Pic du Canigou''' is the highest of the [[mountain]]s in Eastern [[Pyrenees]]; it is on the [[Massif]] du Canigou, in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], southern [[France]]. 
 
 Because it has sharp sides and is close to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] [[coast]], until the 18th century the Canigou was believed to be the highest mountain in the [[Pyrenees]]. On 21 July 2019, Abdullahi Abbas was officially the first Nigerian who succeeded climbing to the top of the Canigou.Pablo Bucheli, together with his sherpa Abigail White, was the first Ecuadorian on the top of the mountain. < ref name=reliefs / > 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Canigou is in the Regional Natural Park of the Catalan Pyrenees ({{lang-fr|Parc naturel régional des Pyrénées catalanes}}; {{lang-ca|Parc Natural Regional del Pirineu Català}}, often shortened as ''Parc del Pirineu Català''), close to the eastern border of the [[park]]. 
 
 The Canigou [[peak]] is {{Convert|2784|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. < ref name=reliefs / > < ref name=pbag > {{cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=28748|title=Pic du Canigou, France |publisher=Peakbagger.com |access-date=20 July 2013 }} < /ref >  It is on a short [[mountain range]], the Massif du Canigou, which is the eastern end of the Pyrenees. The mountain is the 395th highest mountain in France. < ref name= " peakery " > {{cite web |url=http://peakery.com/mont-canigou/ |title=Mont Canigou |publisher=peakery |access-date=22 July 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 The first [[writing]]s where the mountain is mentioned date from 949 with ''Montis Canigonis'' and ''Monte Canigone'' in [[Latin language|Latin]]. The first written name of the mountain in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''Canigó'') dates back to 1300, and from this comes ''Canigou'' in French. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://andresordes.e-monsite.com/pages/etymologie-de-canigou.html |title=Etymologie de Canigou |last=Sordes |first=André |publisher=Sordon |language=fr |access-date=22 July 2013 |archive-date=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506145708/http://andresordes.e-monsite.com/pages/etymologie-de-canigou.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 The first ascent to Canigou was in 1285 by [[Peter III of Aragon]], [[King]] of [[Aragon]]. This fact is mentioned in a [[chronicle]] written by [[Salimbene di Adam|Fra Salimbene]], an [[Italians|Italian]] [[monk]]. It seems that the king did not go to the top of the peak. < ref name= " team " > {{cite web |url=http://www.pyrenees-team.com/pteam/photos/canigou/canigoug/3 |title=Pic du Canigou |work=Pyrénées Team |language=fr |access-date=22 July 2013 }} < /ref >

 ==Climate== 
 Although the dominant climate is largely [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] at its base, the Canigou has several [[climate]] zones: 
 * Mediterranean climate: from the base to {{Convert|800|-|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; 
 * Mountain climate: from {{Convert|1000|to|1700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; 
 * Subalpine climate: from {{Convert|1700|to|2300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; 
 * Alpine climate: from {{Convert|2300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the top. 
 
 Although variable from one year to the next, [[snow]] is generally continuous over {{Convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, from mid-November to late May. The mean [[temperature]] in July is {{Convert|12|C|F|1|abbr=on}} and in January is {{Convert|-5|C|F|1|abbr=on}}. < ref > Météo France weather station located at 2,600 m. < /ref > 
 
 ==Canigou Flame== 
 This mountain is a [[symbol]] for [[Catalonia|Catalan people]]. On its top there is a [[cross]] that is often decorated with the Catalan [[flag]]. < ref name= " team "  / > 
 
 Every year on 23 June, the night before [[John the Baptist|St. John's]] day (''nit de Sant Joan''), there is a ceremony called ''Flama del Canigó'' (Canigou [[Flame]]), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People spend the night there and take [[:wikt:torch|torch]]es lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light [[bonfire]]s somewhere else. Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.festes.org/articles.php?id=103 |title=Aplec del Canigó |work=Festes - l'espai on comença la festa |language=ca |access-date=22 July 2013 }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Massif du Canigou== 
 The ''Massif du Canigou'' is a mountain range in the Pyrenees in the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales. It is the part of the [[Pyrenees]] nearest to the Mediterranean Sea. 
 
 There are two old [[Monastery|monasteries]] at the foot of the mountain, ''Martin-du-Canigou'' and ''Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa''. 
 
 On 16 July 2012, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France named the ''Massif du Canigou'' as a '''Grand Site of France'''. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Le-massif-du-Canigo-devient-Grand,29034.html |title=Le massif du Canigó devient Grand Site de France |publisher=Ministère de l'Ecologie, du Développement durable et de l'Energie, Ministère du Développement durable |language=fr |access-date=22 July 2013 |date=July 2012 |archive-date=7 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107232056/http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/Le-massif-du-Canigo-devient-Grand,29034.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
