 A '''rainbow''' is an [[arc]] of [[colour]] in the [[sky]] that can be seen when the [[sun]] shines through falling [[rain]]. The pattern of colours, called a [[spectrum]], starts with [[red]] on the outside and changes through [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]] on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen. 
 
 A rainbow is created when white light is bent ([[refraction|refracted]]) while entering a droplet of water, [[dispersion|split]] into separate colours, and [[reflection|reflected]] back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the [[Sun]].  
 
 Rainbows often appear after [[storm]]s, and are popular symbols for peace in many [[culture]]s. 
 
 == Cause == 
 
 The rainbow effect can be seen when there are [[water]] drops in the [[air]] and the [[sun]] is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle. 
 Rainbows always appear opposite the [[Sun]]: they form circles around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the [[Sun]]). 
 
 While [[sunlight]] is [[white]], all white light is actually a blend of many different colours. [[Water]] and other materials bend the different colours at different angles, some more strongly than others. This is called [[dispersion]]. By splitting up white light into its separate colours, rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is [[white]]. 
 
 The rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when: 
 * Half of the sky is still dark with draining [[cloud]]s; and 
 * The observer is at a place with clear sky above. 
 Another common place to see the rainbow effect is near [[waterfall]]s. Parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time: 
 * at the edges of clouds lit from the back; or 
 * as upright bands of [[spectrum]] in far away rain even if it does not fall on the earth. 
 
 An unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day.

 == Colours of the rainbow == 
 ''Main article: [[ROYGBIV]]'' 
 
 The rainbow has no definite number of physical colours, but seven are traditionally listed. Below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow. Computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar. (Each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color.)
