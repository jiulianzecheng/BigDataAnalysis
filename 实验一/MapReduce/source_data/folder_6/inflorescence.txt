 An '''inflorescence''' is a flowering stem. The term is most used for a group or cluster of [[flower]]s arranged on a [[Plant stem|stem]]. An inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant; each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern. 
 
 Whereas [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]] are mostly wind-pollinated, [[Flowering plant|flowering plants]] are mostly [[Pollination|pollinated]] by [[Insect|insects]]. There are some exceptions to this, for instance [[Grass|grasses]] are wind-pollinated. However, as a general rule, flowering plants rely on animals for their pollination. 
 
 Most flowers are pollinated by animals, usually insects. To be pollinated, ''a flower needs to be seen''. Most insects have good colour vision, including vision in the [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet]] (which humans do not have). 
 That is the reason many flowers have attractive colours.  
 
 Sometimes there is just a close bunch of flowers (e.g. ''[[lamiales|Antirrhinum]]'') on a ''spike''. Sometimes the inflorescence is so tight it looks like one single flower. What you see as a single [[daisy]] is actually made of several hundred tiny flowers packed together. This kind of inflorescence is called a '''[[pseudanthium]]''' ( " false flower " ). 
 
 == Advantages == 
 The advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the ''[[Magnolia]]'' type. < ref > Stevens P.F. 2001 onwards. ''Angiosperm Phylogeny website''. 2006 and updated. [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/] < /ref > 
 
 ;Numbers: There may be dozens or even hundreds of flowers in an inflorescence, with many seeds or fruits for each flowering. 
 ;Pollination: Increased pollination is an important bonus. Massing flowers together makes them more visible to pollinating insects and birds. 
 ;Seed or fruit dispersal: Dispersal by wind or animals is improved by having the flowers at the top end of a stem.
