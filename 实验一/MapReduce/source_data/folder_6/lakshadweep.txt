 [[File:Lakshadweep Islands (7084297985).jpg|thumb|Islands of Lakshadweep]] 
 '''Lakshdweep''', formerly known as the '''Laccadive, Minicoy and Aminidivi Islands''' are a group of islands in the [[Arabian Sea]]. They belong to [[India]]. Their capital is [[Kavaratti]]. It covers an area of {{convert|11|mi2}}. Eleven of the 36 coral atoll islands of Lakshadweep are inhabited. Lakshadweep is known for its exotic and sun-kissed beaches and lush green landscape. The name Lakshadweep in Malayalam and Sanskrit means 'a hundred thousand islands'. 
 
 The islands are the only coral [[atoll]]s in India. The people living there are [[Malayalam]] and [[Mahl people]], who have been influenced by Arab traders. Lakshadweep is a Muslim region just like the neighbouring [[Maldives]], where tourism is strictly regulated. Lakshadweep has the largest percentage of Muslims - 98%, even larger percentage than Jammu and Kashmir and is the only Muslim-majority Indian administrative division entirely within India.  
 
 Apart from the emerging tourism, government jobs, fishing and coconut production are the mainstays of the Lakshadweep economy.
