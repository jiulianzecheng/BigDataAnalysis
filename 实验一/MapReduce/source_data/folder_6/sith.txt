In the fictional ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]], the '''Sith''' are users of the [[The_Force#The_dark_side|Dark side of The Force]] and the opposite of the [[Jedi]].  
 
 The Sith live to dominate all others and to control society throughout the ''Star Wars'' galaxy so they can get more power. Some famous Sith are [[Darth Vader]], [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] and [[Darth Maul]].  
 
 They lead the Galactic Empire, the [[Antagonist|antagonists]] of the Star Wars series who are known for brutality, being a [[dictatorship]], and having a strong control over peoples lives. The Sith lost power for hundreds of years, before slowly taking over the Republic, or the Jedi Government, and turning it into the Galactic Empire. 
 
 == Expanded universe == 
 
 In the Expanded Universe, The Sith at the start were a different [[species]], looking like Humans, but with red skin and small bones coming out from their heads.  
 
 The Sith Species almost all died after the Jedi committed [[genocide]] on them thousands of years before the movies. This is why some people think the Sith Empire are the  " good guys " , who bring law and order to the Galaxy and are just responding to the Jedi actions.
