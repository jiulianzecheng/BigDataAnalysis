 '''Eutelic''' organisms have a fixed number of [[somatic cell]]s when they reach maturity. The exact number is constant for any one [[species]]. Development proceeds by [[cell division]] until maturity; further growth occurs by cell enlargement only. 
 
 Most eutelic organisms are small or even microscopic: examples include the [[nematodes]] like [[ascaris]], [[gastrotrich]]s, [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrades]] and [[dicyemida]].
