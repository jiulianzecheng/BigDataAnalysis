 '''Dobermann''' or '''Doberman Pinscher''' is a medium to large [[dog breed]]. It originated in [[Germany]] about 1890. < ref name=DPAKC > {{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher/detail/ |title=Meet the Doberman Pinscher |author= |website= |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=17 January 2016}} < /ref >  It was named after a [[tax collector]], [[Friedrich Louis Dobermann|Friedrich Louis Doberman]] (1834-1894), who wanted a dog as a [[Companion dog|companion]] and for [[guard dog|protection]]. < ref name=DPAKC/ >  Doberman Pinschers are known as being very [[intelligent]], [[Loyalty|loyal]] and [[wikt:fearless|fearless]] dogs. They are used by [[police]] forces, [[search and rescue]] dogs, [[guard dog]]s and as [[guide dog]]s for [[blind]] people. 
 
 == Description == 
 === Size === 
 The Doberman is a dog of medium large size. Although the [[breed standard]]s vary among kennel and breed clubs, according to the FCI standard the dog typically stands between {{convert|68|to|72|cm|in}} and [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK quote {{convert|69|cm|in}} as being ideal. < ref name=ukc/ >  The female is typically somewhere between {{convert|63|to|68|cm|in}}. < ref name=FCIsecond > {{cite web |url=http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/143g02-en.pdf|publisher=FCI |title=Dobermann breed standard |accessdate=17 January 2016}} < /ref >  A height of {{convert|65|cm|in}} is considered ideal. < ref name= " ukc " > {{cite web |publisher=The Kennel Club (UK) |url = http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/display.aspx?id=5121 |title= UK Kennel Club: Doberman Pinscher breed standard. 
 |accessdate =17 January 2016 }} < /ref > 
 
 === Colors === 
 Dobermans have short [[wikt:smooth|smooth]] [[hair|coats]] which are most commonly black. < ref name=Fiedler6 > Julie Fiedler, ''Doberman Pinschers'' (New York: PowerKids Press, 2006), p. 6 < /ref >  Less common are [[red]] (reddish-[[brown]]), [[blue]], or [[Tan (color)|fawn-colored]] coats. < ref name=Fiedler6/ >  Blue and fawn colored Dobermans usually have rust-colored (reddish-brown) markings on their [[leg]]s, [[chest]] and [[head]]s. < ref name=Wilcox5 > Charlotte Wilcox, ''The Doberman Pinscher'' (Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 1998), p. 5 < /ref > 
 
 === Ears and tail === 
 Normally a Doberman [[puppy]] has floppy [[ear]]s and a long [[tail]]. While still a puppy, the tails are often shortened by [[surgery]] (called  " docking " ) which heals quickly and causes the puppy very little [[pain]]. < ref name=Gudas19 > Raymond Gudas; Betsy Sikora Siino; Michele Earle-Bridges, ''Doberman Pinschers: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Training and Behavior'' (Hauppauge, NY: Barron's, 2005), p. 19 < /ref >  The ears are cut to a point and so they stand up (called  " cropping " ). < ref name=Gudas19/ >  This takes longer to heal. Cropping is considered by many to be unnecessary and is illegal in much of [[Europe]]. < ref name=Gudas19/ >  But it is still done in the [[United States]] and is part of the standard. < ref name=Gudas19/ > 
 
 == Temperament == 
 People who think they are like any other dogs or are often [[wikt:vicious|vicious]] and [[danger]]ous are for the most part wrong. < ref name=GD > {{cite web |url=http://www.gentledoberman.com/doberman-pinscher-information/temperament/understanding-doberman-temperament |title=The Truth About the Doberman |author= |website= |publisher=Gentle Doberman |accessdate=17 January 2016}} < /ref >  It is true that any dog that is [[wikt:mistreat|mistreat]]ed or not taken care of can become dangerous. Viciousness is a learned behavior and few dogs, including the Doberman, are naturally vicious. < ref name=GD/ >  Dobermans can be [[wikt:protect|protect]]ive and [[wikt:guarded|guarded]] or they can be sweet and eager to please. < ref name=WilsonDC > {{cite web |url=http://www.dogchannel.com/dog-breeds/training-doberman-pinscher-personality.aspx |title=Training Secrets for Doberman Pinschers |author=Wendy Bedwell-Wilson |date=10 July 2012 |website= |publisher=Dog Channel/I-5 Publishing, LLC |accessdate=17 January 2016}} < /ref >  To get the desired temperament, [[training]] should start when the dog is about 8 months old. < ref name=WilsonDC/ > 
 
 The American Kennel Club describes the Doberman as " 
 {{cquote|He is ready to give prompt alarm (and back up that warning) but is also affectionate, obedient and loyal. The breed requires regular daily exercise. Some early specimens were quite sharp and aggressive, but today's Doberman temperament has undergone a gradual but steady decrease in overall sharpness. Not all Dobermans have the same temperament. A Doberman Pinscher of correct breed temperament is trustworthy with his master's children, friends and company. Doberman Pinschers are not well suited to being kennel dogs or isolated outdoor dogs, nor is it advisable to house two adult males together. < ref name= " DPAKC " / > }}
