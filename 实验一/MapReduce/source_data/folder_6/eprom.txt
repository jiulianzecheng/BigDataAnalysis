An '''EPROM''' (rarely '''EROM'''), or '''erasable programmable read-only memory''', is a type of memory [[Integrated circuit|chip]]. Unlike a normal [[programmable read-only memory]] (PROM), this type of chip can have its information cleared and written again. 
 
 EPROMs are cleared by shining [[ultraviolet]] light on the clear opening on their top. Some EPROMs can be cleared using only electricity instead of needing ultraviolet light. These are called [[EEPROM]]s (standing for electrically erasable programmable read-only memory).
