 '''Popsicle''' is a popular [[brand]] of [[Ice lolly|ice pop]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is made of colored, [[flavor]]ed [[ice]] on a wooden stick. The brand name includes more than 30 different versions of the snack. 
 
 == History == 
 The Popsicle was accidentally invented in 1905 by 11-year-old Frank Epperson. Epperson left a mixture of powdered [[Soft drink|soda]] and water and a stirring stick in a cup on his porch. That night San Francisco went through unusually low temperatures, and Epperson awoke the next morning to find a [[Freezing|frozen]] pop that would eventually become a favorite American snack. 
 
 At first, Epperson named his frozen snack the  " Epsicle " , and it became popular with his school friends. In 1923, while running a [[lemonade]] stand at an [[amusement park]] in [[Oakland, California]], Epperson realized that he could earn money from his invention. Epperson changed the name of his treat to  " Popsicle " , after his children always asked for  " Pop’s ’sicle " , and signed up for a [[patent]]. The patent for frozen ice on a stick was issued August 19, 1924. 
 
 Around 1925, Epperson sold the popsicle rights to the brand name Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company in [[New York]]. By 1928, Epperson had earned royalties on more than 60 million Popsicle ice pops.
