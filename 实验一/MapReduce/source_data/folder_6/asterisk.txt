The '''asterisk'''  < big > ('''*''') < /big >  is a [[snowflake]]-like [[typographic]] symbol or [[glyph]]. < ref > from {{lang-el|ἀστερίσκος}}, ''asteriskos'',  " little star "  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29steri%2Fskos ἀστερίσκος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus. < /ref >   
 
 It is so-called because it looks like an image of a star.  [[Computer]] scientists and mathematicians often speak it as '''star'''. Example: ''the [[A* search algorithm]]''.  
 
 In English, an asterisk is usually five-pointed or six-pointed in [[font|typefaces]], and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten. It can be used as censorship. It is also used on the internet to correct one's spelling, in which case it appears after the correct word.
