 The '''liverworts''' are a group of simple [[plant]]s. Scientists believe that liverworts were the first [[bryophyte]] to [[evolve]]. They believe that [[mosses]], [[Hornwort|hornworts]], and [[Vascular plant|more complex plants]] then evolved from liverworts. Scientists decided this from [[mitochondrial DNA]]. < ref > Willis K.J. and McElwain J.C. 2002. ''The evolution of plants''. Oxford. < /ref > < sup > p75 < /sup >

 Liverworts are usually placed in the bryophytes, a group of plants without tissue to conduct water. That is why they always need to live near a [[spring (water)|spring]], a [[river]], or in a place where there is a lot of [[fog]] or has a lot of [[rainfall]]. This group also includes with mosses and hornworts. Recent [[taxonomy]] gave them their own [[division (botany)|division]] called the '''Marchantiophyta'''. However, since the classification is not yet settled, we use the old terms. 
 
 Liverworts, as the picture shows, are small plants with flattened bodies, or with flattened stems bearing overlapping scales. < ref name= " Schofield " > Schofield W.B. 1985. ''Introduction to Bryology'' Macmillan, New York. {{ISBN|0-02-949660-8}}. < /ref > < sup > p135 < /sup > 
 
 The name liverwort comes from the [[Middle Ages]], when plants were selected as medicines according to the false belief that ''similia similibus curentur'' (similar heals similar). The liver shape seen in the liverwort ''Marchantia'', for example, was  boiled in wine as a medicine against liver problems. The name was then transferred to the whole group. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Liverworts have a [[Alternation of generations|gametophyte]]-dominant life cycle. This means that most parts of them only have one copy of [[DNA]], like [[Moss|mosses]]. In most plants and animals, most parts have two copies of DNA. Some parts of liverworts have two copies, and they're called the [[Alternation of generations|sporophytes]]. These are stalks that grow [[Sporangium|sporangia]], sacs with spores inside. They're simple, and don't last long.
