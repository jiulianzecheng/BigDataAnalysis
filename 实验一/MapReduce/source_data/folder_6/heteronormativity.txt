'''Heteronormativity''' is the belief that everyone is [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] by nature, and every other form of human [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is not as good as heterosexuality, or even an [[Disease|illness]] that needs to be fixed. In a heteronormative system, there are two strict [[gender]]s, [[men]] and [[women]], and everyone must behave according to their gender role in society. A heteronormative view of the world believes that a person's [[sex]] decides their [[sexuality]], [[gender identity]] and [[gender roles]]. 
 
 [[Homophobia]], [[transphobia]], and [[heterosexism]] could not exist without heteronormativity. < ref name= " lovaas " > Lovaas, Karen, and Mercilee M. Jenkins.

 According to [[queer theory]], [[society|societies]] force heteronormativity on people it does not fit, such as [[LGBT]] people, [[queer]] people, and [[intersex]] people. 
 
 == Where the word comes from == 
 
 [[Michael Warner]] made the word  " heteronormativity "  popular in 1991 in one of the first books on queer theory. < ref > Warner, Michael (1991),  " Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet " . ''Social Text''; 9 (4 [29]): 3–17 < /ref >  It came from [[Gayle Rubin]]'s idea of the  " sex/gender system "  and [[Adrienne Rich]]'s idea of  " [[compulsory heterosexuality]]. " < ref > [[Adrienne Rich]], 'Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence' ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 5:631-60, 1980. < /ref >  According to Samuel A. Chambers, heteronormativity shows what societies expect, demand, and allow when they consider relations between men and women to be the only normal ones. < ref > Samuel A.

 == Discrimination == 
 
 People who argue against heteronormativity include Cathy J. Cohen, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant. They argue that it [[oppression|holds down]] those who do not fit it, [[stigmatization|marks them as outsiders]], [[marginalization|keeps them out of society]], and makes it hard for them to [[self-expression|express themselves]]. < ref name=lovaas / > < ref name= " OutatWork " / >  Heteronormative [[policy|policies]] and [[institution]]s strengthen the belief that people are [[heterosexual]] and that there are only two [[gender]]s and [[sex]]es by nature. < ref > {{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication|url = https://archive.org/details/genderincommunic0000defr|last = DeFrancisco|first = Victoria|publisher = SAGE Publication, Inc.|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = U.S.A|pages = [https://archive.org/details/genderincommunic0000defr/page/16 16]}} < /ref >  They argue that heteronormative culture gives an [[Privilege|unfair advantage]] to heterosexual people (this is called [[heterosexism]]). It causes members of society to [[discrimination|keep LGBT people out]] of work, school, and the greater society, sometimes using the [[law]]. < ref name=OutatWork > {{cite book|last=Krupat|first=Kitty|title=Out at Work: Building a Gay-Labor Alliance|url=https://archive.org/details/outatworkbuildin00krup|year=2001|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-3741-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/outatworkbuildin00krup/page/n290 268]}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people=== 
 
 According to the [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Gayle Rubin]], heteronormativity ranks sexual practices from  " good sex "  to  " bad sex. "  This  " sex [[hierarchy]] "  ranks sex between two married heterosexual people for the purpose of creating a [[child]] as  " good, "  and ranks people and acts that fall short of this standard lower until they become  " bad sex. "  Gay couples who are married are somewhere in the middle. Gay people who have sex with many partners are also in the middle, but below gay married couples. < ref name= " thinkingsex " > Rubin, Gayle. ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality'', in Vance, Carole. ''Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality'' (1993) < /ref >  Patrick McCreery, a [[lecturer]] at [[New York University]], believes this is the reason why gay people are attacked for doing things that [[double standard|straight people also do]], such as watching [[pornography]] or practicing [[BDSM]]. < ref name= " OutatWork " / > 
 
 McCreery says that this  " sex hierarchy "  also exists in the workplace. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are more likely to be kept out of work the lower they fall. [[Transgender]] people fall especially low in the hierarchy and face the most obvious discrimination. This leaves many LGBT people without jobs. < ref name= " OutatWork " / >  People can be fired for being LGBT, or they can never be offered a job for the same reason. In 1991 the restaurant [[Cracker Barrel]] in the [[United States]] made the news when it fired a [[lesbian]] worker. There was no law against this, and there is still no law against it in most of the country. < ref name= " OutatWork " / > 
 
 ===Against intersex people=== 
 
 [[Intersex]] babies can be born with neither a [[penis]] nor a [[vagina]]. Doctors and parents often force intersex children to have surgery to make them look more like most men and women. Usually they are healthy without this and it is not necessary. Most intersex children are not allowed to decide if they want this surgery. This is not because there is anything wrong with their bodies. Rather, parents are often afraid that their children will be judged. In other words, doctors and parents force them to have surgery for [[social construct|social]] reasons, not [[biology|biological]] ones. < ref > Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2000.
