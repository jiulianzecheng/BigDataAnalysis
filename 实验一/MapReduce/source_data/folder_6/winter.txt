 '''Winter''' is one of the four [[season]]s and it is the [[cold]]est time of the year. The days are shorter, and the nights are longer. Winter comes after [[autumn]] and before [[spring]]. 
 
 Winter begins at the winter [[solstice]]. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]] the winter solstice is usually [[December 21]] or [[December 22]]. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] the winter solstice is usually [[June 21]] or [[June 22]]. 
 
 Some animals [[hibernate]] during this season. In [[temperate climate]]s there are no [[leaves]] on [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s. People wear warm clothing, and eat food that was grown earlier. Many places have [[snow]] in winter, and some people use [[sled]]s or [[ski]]s. [[Holiday]]s in winter for many countries include [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]]. 
 
 The name comes from an old Germanic word that means  " time of water "  and refers to the rain and snow of winter in middle and high [[latitude]]s.
