 '''''Gigantophis garstini''''' was an extinct giant [[snake]]. Before the [[Paleocene]] constrictor [[genus]] ''[[Titanoboa]]'' was described from [[Colombia]] in 2009, ''Gigantophis'' was  the largest snake ever recorded. ''Gigantophis'' lived about 40 million years ago during the [[Eocene]], in the [[Paratethys Sea]]. This was in what is now the northern [[Sahara]], where [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]] are now. < ref > Fossilworks.
