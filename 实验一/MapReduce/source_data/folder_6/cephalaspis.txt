 '''''Cephalaspis''''' (meaning 'head shield') is a [[Genus (biology)|genus]] of armoured fish in the early [[Devonian]] about 400 million years ago (mya). 
 It was one of the [[jawless fish]]es, or [[ostracoderm]]s, which were common at the time.  
 
 They were discovered in the first half of the 19th century in the [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[Britain]]. [[Louis Agassiz]] named it in 1835. < ref > Agassiz L. 1835. ''Recherches sur les poissons fossiles''. Tome I (livr. 18). < /ref >  He had been to [[Scotland]], and seen [[Hugh Miller]]'s collection. Miller described his collecting later, in a popular work on the rocks and fossils of the [[Old Red Sandstone]] in [[Scotland]]. < ref name=Miller > Miller, Hugh 1841. ''The Old Red Sandstone, or new walks in an old field''. Edinburgh: Johnstone. < /ref >  Agassoz' single species has now been split into more species, some of which have been moved into a different [[genus]]. < ref > Janvier P. 1996.

 ''Cephalaspis'' was a medium-sized fish that lived in freshwater streams and estuaries of the early [[Devonian]]. Some of the fossils are well-preserved, and so we know quite a bit about its anatomy. < ref name=Benton > Benton, Michael. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. London: Chapman  &  Hall, 2nd ed, p48/9. < /ref >  Its armour was on the [[dorsal]] side, and its mouth on the [[ventral]] side. Therefore, it is likely that it was a bottom-feeder, nosing about in the [[mud]] of a river. It had a typical vertebrate type of brain, with front, middle and rear regions, and nerves to and from sense organs and  muscles in the head region. < ref name=Benton/ > 
 
 Its [[pineal gland|pineal]] opening between its eyes was probably a light-sensitive organ. On its [[skull]] are three areas which obviously had a special function. Many modern fish which live in muddy rivers use both pressure-sensitive [[lateral line]]s, and also [[electric field|electrical fields]] to sense movement. ''Cephalaspis'' had no lateral lines, but the three fields on its skull were no doubt sensory, for sensing pressure change or electrical fields. 
 
 The animal had [[semi-circular canals]] to sense balance (one of the functions of our own semi-circular canals). They were capable of sustained swimming, and short rapid bursts. < ref name=Benton/ >  Almost all the fossils are found in [[strata]] laid down in [[freshwater]] conditions, so the various species live in rivers, streams connected with lakes and [[estuaries]]. 
 
 Sansom decided that ''Cephalaspis'' was the sister-taxon of cornuate osteostracans, which have defined corners on the head-shields. < ref > Sansom, Robert S. 2009, Phylogeny, classification and character polarity of the Osteostraci (Vertebrata).
