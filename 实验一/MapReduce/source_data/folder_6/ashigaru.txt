 '''Ashigaru''' is a type of [[Japan]]ese [[soldier]] that began during the Heian Period (794-1185). Their origin is serving as bodyguards to government officials during this period.  They became more active over hundreds of years and ended up serving as foot-soldiers for [[samurai]] and [[shogun]].  Ashigaru became masterless warriors after the beginning of the Edo Period (1603-1868). After the Edo Period, many became police.  
 
 == Fighting style and armor == 
 Ashigaru are noted for using surprise attacks and group tactics.  They wore metal armor, a gauntlet, and a Japanese half-length coat.  The armor also had leather and Japanese rice paper.  Their weapon was a sword, spear, gun, or bow.  Ashigaru also carried a water bottle, tissue paper, and rice.   
 
 == The Ōnin Rebellion == 
 In the [[Ōnin War]] (1467-1477), the ashigaru robbed and looted [[Kyoto]].  This gave ashigaru a reputation as bad troops.
