 ==Contact with Russians== 
 During the [[17th century]], Russians made contact with the Even people. They introduced diseases to the Evens, such as [[smallpox]] and [[influenza]]. Russians also made Evens pay the ''yasak'', which meant they had to pay [[Tax|taxes]] to the Russian government with reindeer furs. Because of the new diseases and the reindeer population decreasing, the population of the Even people went down.
