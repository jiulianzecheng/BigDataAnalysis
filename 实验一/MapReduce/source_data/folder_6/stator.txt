 A '''stator''' is the part of a [[Rotation|rotary]] system that does not move. It is the fixed, [[wikt:stationary|stationary]] part of an electric machine ([[motor]] or [[generator]]). The stator might act as the field magnet (working with the [[armature]] to create the spinning movement) or as the armature (receives influence from the moving field coils of the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]]).
