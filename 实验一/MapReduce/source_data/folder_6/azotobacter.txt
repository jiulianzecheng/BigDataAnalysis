 '''Azotobacter''' are a type of [[bacteria]] that are normally [[oval]] or [[spherical]] in shape. Azotobacter species are commonly found in [[soil]], [[sediment]]s and [[water]]. Azotobacter grows well at approximately at [[pH]] range of 7 to 9, between [[Neutralization|neutral]] and [[alkali]]ne. Azotobacter will die if they are in an environment below the pH 6. < ref name= " Med1 " > {{cite journal |last1=Dev Jnawali |first1=Arjun |last2=Babu Ojha |first2=Roshan |last3=Marahatta |first3=Sushma |title=Role of Azotobacter in soil fertility and sustainability–a review |journal=Advances in Plants  &  Agriculture Research |date=9 October 2015 |volume=2 |issue=6 |doi=10.15406/apar.2015.02.00069 |url=https://medcraveonline.com/APAR/role-of-azotobacter-in-soil-fertility-and-sustainabilityndasha-review.html |accessdate=26 July 2022 |language=English |issn=2373-6402}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Nitrogen fixation]] can be defined as the removal of nitrogen from the environment in its molecular form (N2) to create [[nitrogen compounds]] that are helpful for other biological processes. Azotobacter species are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (which convert atmospheric nitrogen into [[ammonia]]. < ref name= " CoE " > {{cite journal |last1=Greenwood |first1=N.N. |last2=Earnshaw |first2=A. |title=Chromium, Molybdenum and Tungsten |journal=Chemistry of the Elements |date=1997 |pages=1002–1039 |doi=10.1016/b978-0-7506-3365-9.50029-8 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780750633659500298 |accessdate=26 July 2022 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780750633659 |language=en}} < /ref >  Azotobacter species are classified as one of the non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation bacteria (free-living bacteria in the soil). 
 
 Azotobacter aids to boost plant development and increase soil [[nitrogen]] level through nitrogen fixation by using [[carbon]] for its [[metabolism]]. Optimal [[calcium]] nutrient concentrations are required for Azotobacter to develop more rapidly and have the capacity to fix nitrogen (Iswaran and Sen, 1960) < ref name= " SD2 " > {{cite journal |last1=Sumbul |first1=Aisha |last2=Ansari |first2=Rizwan Ali |last3=Rizvi |first3=Rose |last4=Mahmood |first4=Irshad |title=Azotobacter: A potential bio-fertilizer for soil and plant health management |journal=Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences |date=1 December 2020 |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=3634–3640 |doi=10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.08.004 |pmid=33304174 |pmc=7714982 |language=en |issn=1319-562X}} < /ref >  but higher nitrogen concentrations have a negative impact on Azotobacter activity (Soleimanzadeh and Gooshchi, 2013). Since more than a [[century]] ago, the genus Azotobacter has been utilised as a biofertilizer (fertiliser that contains living microorganisms) (Gerlach  &  Vogel, 1902).
