In [[rail transport]], a '''locomotive''' or a '''rail tractor''' is the part of a [[Railway|train]] that makes the train move. Normally, it is the first part of the train, and has an [[engine]]. Some trains do not have a separate locomotive; they have motors in the other parts of the train.

 A [[diesel locomotive]] is powered by a [[diesel engine]]. The diesel engine may drive the locomotive's wheels directly via a gearbox, shaft or chain (called mechanical transmission) or by using a hydraulic transmission system (diesel-hydraulic). Most of the locomotives in the world are diesel-electric, due to their ease of use and reliability. They generate electricity and use it to power the wheels. They can be more powerful than steam locomotives and do not need an expensive power grid like electric locomotives.

 A [[steam locomotive]] uses [[wood]], [[coal]] or [[oil]] (but mostly coal) as [[fuel]] to heat [[water]] in a boiler, which turns into [[steam]] which pushes [[piston]]s to power the train. Steam locomotives were invented in the early 19th century. They are not widely used any more due to their operational costs, especially the fuel costs; steam locomotives are now mostly only used on tourist railroads. < !-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -- > {{clr}}

 An [[electric locomotive]] runs on [[electricity]] as the name suggests. Electric locomotives cost the least to buy and operate. However, the [[railway electrification system]] is very expensive, so only tracks used by many trains per day are usually electrified. Thus, electrics are only the second next used type, behind diesel locomotives.
