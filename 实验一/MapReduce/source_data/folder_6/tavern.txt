 A '''tavern''', also known as a '''saloon''' or '''bar''', is a place where [[alcohol]]ic [[drink]]s (such as [[beer]], [[wine]], or [[Liquor|spirits]]) are served. While the word  " tavern "  used to be common in [[England]], in the [[19th century]] the word began to be seen as old fashioned. The current term today in England is  " pub "  which comes from ''public house''. However, taverns remain a popular part of fantasy stories and games. The term is still commonly used in the United States.
