 '''Mecoptera''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: ''meco-'' =  " long " , ''-ptera'' =  " wings " ) are an order of [[insect]]s with about 550 species in nine families worldwide. Mecoptera are sometimes called '''scorpionflies''' after their largest family [[Panorpidae]], in which the males have enlarged genitals that look similar to the stinger of a [[scorpion]]. The [[Bittacidae]], or '''hangingflies''', are a prominent family of elongate insects known for their elaborate mating rituals, in which females choose mates based on the quality of gift prey offered by various males.
