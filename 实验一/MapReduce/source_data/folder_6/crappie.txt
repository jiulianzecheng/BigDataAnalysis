 The '''crappies''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|æ|p|iː}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɒ|p|iː}}) < ref name= " bartleby " > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0726800.html|title=Crappie|encyclopedia=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|edition=4th|access-date=2006-06-29|archive-date=2005-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050926132909/http://bartleby.com/61/68/C0726800.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  are a [[genus]], ''Pomoxis'', of [[North America]]n [[freshwater]] fish. They are members of the [[sunfish]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Centrarchidae]]. Both [[species]] in this genus are popular [[game fish]]. These are the Black crappie (P. nigromaculatus) and the White crappie (P. annularis). The White crappie is the state fish of [[Louisiana]]. 
 
 == Etymology == 
 
 The genus name ''Pomoxis'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πώμα (cover, plug, [[Operculum (Fish)|operculum]]) and οξύς (sharp). The common name (also spelled croppie or crappé), comes from the [[Canadian French]] ''crapet,'' which refers to many different [[fishe]]s of the sunfish family. Other names for crappie are papermouths, strawberry bass, speckled bass or specks (especially in [[Michigan]]), speckled perch, calico bass (throughout [[New England]]), < ref > {{Cite web |title=''Massachusetts Wildlife'' |url=http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/publications/mwmag/pdf/fishing_issue.pdf |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-date=2012-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008215020/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/publications/mwmag/pdf/fishing_issue.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  ''sac-a-lait'' (in southern [[Louisiana]], lit.

 ==Species== 
 
 The currently recognized species in this genus are: < ref > {{FishBase genus | genus = Pomoxis| month = February | year = 2013}} < /ref > 
 * White crappie – ''P. annularis''  < small > ([[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|Rafinesque]], 1818) < /small >   
 * Black crappie – ''P. nigromaculatus''  < small > ([[Charles Alexandre Lesueur|Lesueur]], 1829) < /small > 
 
 == Biology == 
 
 Crappies are both predators and prey. Both species of crappie as adults feed predominantly on smaller fish species. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.apexfishingtips.com/fish-species/crappie-fishing-tips.html |title=Crappie Fishing Tips - How to Catch Crappie |publisher=Apex Fishing Tips |access-date=22 February 2022}} < /ref >  This includes the young of their own predators (which include the [[northern pike]], [[muskellunge]], and [[walleye]]). They have varied diets, however, including [[zooplankton]], [[insect]]s, and [[crustacean]]s. < ref name= " fishbase_white " > {{FishBase species|genus=Pomoxis|species=annularis|year=2006|month=March}} < /ref > < ref name= " fishbase_black " > {{FishBase species|genus=Pomoxis|species=nigromaculatus|year=2006|month=March}} < /ref >  By day, crappie tend to be less active and to concentrate around weed beds or submerged objects, such as logs and boulders. They feed especially at dawn and dusk, moving then into open water or approaching the shore. < ref name= " natureserve_white " > {{Cite web|work=[[NatureServe]] Explorer|title=Comprehensive Report Species – ''Pomoxis annularis''|url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=POMOXIS+ANNULARIS|access-date=2006-06-29|archive-date=2006-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216122955/http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=POMOXIS+ANNULARIS|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 There are differences between the White and Black crappies. White crappies have 5 or 6 dorsal spines while Black crappies have 7 or 8. < ref > Rick Parker, ''Aquaculture Science'' (Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, 2012), p. 147 < /ref >  White crappies are usually more numerous and tend to be larger. Black crappies appear darker because of the dark spots on its sides. < ref name=Buchholz > James Buchholz, ''Wild Wisconsin Notebook'' (Black Earth, WI: Prairie Oak Press, 2001), p. 41 < /ref >  White crappies have black vertical bands on their bodies and are often lighter in color. < ref name=Buchholz/ >  But the two can be difficult to tell apart unless you count the spines. < ref name=Buchholz/ >  Crappies are among the most numerous [[:en:wikt:panfish|panfish]] in North American waters. < ref name=Parker > Rick Parker, ''Aquaculture Science'' (Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Cengage Learning, 2012), p. 148 < /ref >  Black crappies begin [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] when the water temperature reaches 60 to 64 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Females lay between 20,000 and 140,000 eggs. < ref name=Parker/ >  The White crappies begin spawning at water temperatures between 65 and 70 degrees F. The female White crappie lays between 1,000 and 200,000 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. < ref name=Parker/ >  Male crappies guard the nest until the eggs hatch, usually in about five days. < ref name=Parker/ > 
 
 == Game fish == 
 
 The ''Pomoxis'' species are highly regarded game fishes and are often considered to be among the best-tasting freshwater fish. Because of the variety of their diets, crappies may be caught in many ways. This includes [[casting (fishing)|casting]] light [[jig (fishing)|jig]]s, [[trolling (angling)|trolling]] with [[minnow]]s or artificial lures. Small [[spinnerbait]]s, or using [[Bobber (fishing)|bobbers]] are also very effective. Crappies are very popular with [[ice fishing|ice-fishermen]], as they are active in winter. < ref name= " natureserve_white "  / >  The current all-tackle fishing world record for a black crappie is {{convert|2.25|kg|lboz|abbr=on}} and for a white crappie is {{convert|2.35|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}. < ref > IGFA World Record: [http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle & cn=Crappie,%20black Black Crappie – (Pomoxis nigromaculatus)] < /ref > < ref > IGFA World Record: [http://wrec.igfa.org/WRecordsList.aspx?lc=AllTackle & cn=Crappie,%20white White Crappie – (Pomoxis annularis)] < /ref > 
 
 === Angling === 
  [[File:Nice Crappie (7335780206).jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{Center|It doesn't take an expert to catch crappies}}]] 
 [[Angling]] for crappies is popular throughout much of North America. Methods vary, but among the most popular is called  " Spider Rigging, "  a method characterized by a fisherman in a boat with many long [[fishing rod]]s pointing away from the angler at various angles like spokes from a wheel. < ref name= " in-fisherman " > {{Cite web|title=Super Crappie Systems |url=http://www.in-fisherman.com/magazine/articles/if0403_Crappie/ |publisher=In-Fisherman| access-date=23 February 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061222232002/http://www.in-fisherman.com/magazine/articles/if0403_Crappie/ | archive-date = 22 December 2006}} < /ref >  Anglers who employ the Spider Rigging method may choose from among many popular baits, like corn. Many anglers also chum or dump live bait into the water to attract the fish hoping the fish will bite their bait.{{efn|This is illegal in some US states. The alternative method is to put minnows in a clear sealed [[Mason jar]] suspended on a string.}} There are many types of [[Fishing lure|lures]] that catch crappies. [[Jigging|Jigs]], especially with a live [[minnow]] are very effective. < ref name=Complete > ''The Complete Guide to Freshwater Fishing'', eds. Editors of Creative Publishing (Minnetonka, MN: Creative Publishing International, 2002), p. 138 < /ref >  [[Spoon lure|Spoons]], [[Spinnerbait|Spinners]] and [[Plug (fishing)|Crankbaits]] are all effective at different times. < ref name=Complete/ > 
 
 === Commercial fishing === 
 
 A commercial fishery for crappies existed at [[Reelfoot Lake]] in Tennessee until 2003. It was one of the few commercial fisheries for crappies.
