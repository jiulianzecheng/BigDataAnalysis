'''MOVE''' is a [[Philadelphia]]-based [[black power|black liberation]] group founded by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart) in 1972. The group lives [[commune|communally]]. 
 
 The group had two major conflicts with the [[Philadelphia]] Police Department.  In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of one police officer, injuries to several other people, and [[life sentence]]s for nine members.  
 
 In 1985, another standoff ended when a police helicopter dropped a bomb on their compound. This was a row house in the middle of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue. The bomb caused a fire, and killed eleven MOVE members, including five children. The fire burst out of control and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood, prompting widespread news coverage. < ref name=Trippett  > {{cite web|last=Trippett |first=Frank |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,141842,00.html |title=It Looks Just Like a War Zone |publisher=TIME |date=1985-05-27 |access-date=2013-05-14}} < /ref >
