 '''Vomiting''', also called '''puking''' or '''emesis''', is emptying the contents of [[stomach]] through [[mouth]]. It can be either food or liquid in the stomach. It can be from [[infectious disease|infection]], contaminated food or drink ([[food poisoning]]), foul smells or foul-tasting food, the [[brain]] being injured, a block in the [[small intestine]]s so food and liquid cannot go through, too much [[alcohol]] or other drugs. Also, people can make themselves '''vomit''' (self-induced) which is called [[:wikt:purge|purging]]. Usually, people who have eaten or drunk [[poison]] are made to vomit any residual (leftover) poison. Excessive vomiting may lead to [[dehydration]], which can be dangerous, if not fatal as it will shut down a person's organs and twist the intestines. 
 ; Color of vomit 
 * Bright red in the vomit suggests bleeding from the [[esophagus]]. 
 * Dark red vomit with liver-like clots suggests bleeding in the [[stomach]], such as from a perforated ulcer 
 * Coffee-ground-like vomit suggests less severe bleeding in the stomach because the gastric acid has had time to change the composition of the blood 
 * Yellow vomit suggests bile, indicating that the [[pyloric valve]] is open and [[bile]] is flowing into the stomach from the [[duodenum]] (this is more common in older people)
