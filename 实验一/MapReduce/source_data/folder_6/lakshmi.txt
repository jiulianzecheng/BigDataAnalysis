 '''Lakshmi''' is the [[deity|goddess]] of [[money]], [[wisdom]] and good [[luck]] in [[Hinduism]]. Most Hindus pray to her on [[Diwali]], which is a festival in [[India]]. She is regarded as an equivalent goddess of [[Emoinu]], her Meitei counterpart. [[Gajalakshmi]] 
 
 Lakshmi has four arms, fair skin and sits on a [[Nelumbo|lotus]] flower and is normally surrounded by elephants. She is covered in [[jewellery]]. 
 
 She also has several [[avatar]]s (means a god coming to the earth in the form of a human being or in any other form). Her husband is the [[Hindu]] [[Deity|god]] [[Vishnu]] but her other avatars are usually married to Vishnu's avatars: 
 * [[Sita]], wife of [[Rama]] 
 * [[Radha]], the lover, and [[Rukmini]], the first wife and queen of [[Krishna]]
