 The '''oat''' (''Avena sativa'') is a [[cereal]] [[grain]]. It is [[food]] for people and other [[animal]]s, for example, [[chicken]]s and [[horse]]s. [[Oatmeal]] is made from oats. Oat [[straw]] is used as bedding for animals. 
 
 [[Porridge]] is made only from [[whole grain]] oats. It forms an excellent part of a balanced diet for the following reasons: 
 # Oats are rich in both [[soluble]] and insoluble [[fiber]]. 
 # Oats are a place to get [[energy]].  As a rich place to get complex [[carbohydrate]]s, they provide a slow release of energy over the morning – in that way they reduce the desire to eat ‘quick energy release’ sugar-based foods. 
 # Oats are also a good place to get [[protein]]. 
 # Oats are also a good place to get [[vitamin B1]]. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 The wild [[ancestor]] of ''Avena sativa'' and the similar minor crop, ''A. byzantina'', is the [[Polyploidy|hexaploid]] wild oat ''A. sterilis''. Science of [[DNA]] shows that the ancestor forms of ''A. sterilis'' grew in the [[Fertile Crescent]] of the [[Near East]]. 
 
 [[Domestication|Domesticated]] oats appear later. They are also far from the Near East, in [[Bronze Age]] Europe. Oats are like [[rye]]. They are normally thought as a less important crop, i.e. coming from a [[weed]] out of the main [[cereal]]s [[wheat]] and barley   As these cereals spread into cooler, wetter places, this may have favored the oat weed. This quickly leads to its common use. < ref > Zhou, X., Jellen, E.N., Murphy, J.P. 1999. Progenitor germplasm of domesticated hexaploid oat. ''Crop science'' 39: 1208–1214 < /ref > 
 
 ==Cultivation== 
 [[Image:OatsYield.png|thumb|300px|right|Worldwide oat yield]] 
 
 Oats are grown all over [[temperate]] places. They have a lower [[summer]] [[heat]] need and are able to survive more [[rain]] than other cereals like [[wheat]], [[rye]] or [[barley]]. Oats are an [[annual plant]], and can be planted either in autumn (for late summer harvest) or in the spring (for early autumn harvest). 
 
 [[History|Historical]] [[wikt:attitude|attitudes]] towards oats are very different. Oat [[bread]] was first made in [[England]], where the first oat bread [[factory]] was made in 1899. In [[Scotland]], are well liked, as a good part of the [[nation]]al [[diet]]. The English writer [[Samuel Johnson]], famously wrote in ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' that the oat was ''a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.'' Which the Scottish quickly said back  " and England has the best horses, and Scotland the best men. " 
 
 ==Uses== 
 [[Image:Avena-sativa.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of oat ''florets'' (small flowers)]] 
 
 Oats have many uses in food. Most of the time they are rolled or crushed into [[oatmeal]], or ground into oat [[flour]]. Oatmeal is also eaten as [[porridge]], but may also be used in many of baked goods, such as oat [[cake]]s, oatmeal [[cookie]]s, and oat bread. Oats are also an substance used in many cold cereals, in particular [[muesli]] and [[granola]]. Without cooking, oats may also be taken as food. 
 
 Oats are also sometimes used in [[drink]]s. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], it is used for making [[beer]]. Oatmeal [[stout]] is one of many beers using some oats.  A cold, sweet drink made of ground oats and milk is a well liked drink in  [[Latin America]]. 'Oatmeal caudle', made of [[ale]] and oatmeal with [[spice]]s was a usual British drink and well-liked by Oliver Cromwell. < ref > ''The Compleat Housewife'', p. 169, Eliza Smith, 1739 < /ref > < ref > ''Food in Early Modern Europe'', Ken Albala, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, {{ISBN|0313319626}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[Scotland]] a dish called ''Sowans'' was made by putting the husks from oats in [[water]] for a week so that the fine, dusty part of the meal remained at the bottom to be strained off, boiled and taken as food (Gauldie 1981). Oats are also widely used there as a thickener in [[soup]]s, as [[barley]] or [[rice]] might be used in other countries. 
 
 Oats and its [[hull]]s are also commonly used as feed for [[horse]]s - as  whole or rolled oats or as part of  food bits. [[Cattle]] are also fed oats, either whole, or ground into a  flour using a mill. 
 
 Oat [[straw]] is prized by cattle and horse makers as bedding, because its soft, almost dust-free, and takes in [[liquid]]. The straw can also be used for making [[corn dolly|corn dollies]]. Tied in a cotton bag, oat straw was used to soften bath-water. 
 
 Things take out of oatscan also be used to make pain less sharp in the [[skin]], as in skin [[lotion]]s. It is the main substance in the [[Aveeno]] line of products. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.aveeno.com/about-aveeno.jsp |title=AVEENO Skin Care Products |publisher=Aveeno.com |accessdate=2009-08-10 |archive-date=2009-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803154842/http://www.aveeno.com/about-aveeno.jsp |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Health==

 Oats are mostly thought as  " healthy "  food. The finding of the healthy LDL [[cholesterol]]-lowering [[wikt:properties|properties]] < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Whitehead|first1=Anne|last2=Beck|first2=Eleanor J|last3=Tosh|first3=Susan|last4=Wolever|first4=Thomas MS|date=15 October 2014|title=Cholesterol-lowering effects of oat β-glucan: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials1234|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1413–1421|doi=10.3945/ajcn.114.086108|issn=0002-9165|pmc=5394769|pmid=25411276}} < /ref >  has led to more liking of oats as human food. 
 
 ===Protein=== 
 Oat is the only [[cereal]] having a globulin or [[legume]]-like protein, avenalin, as the major (80%) storage protein. < ref > {{cite journal | url=http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/reprint/7/7/945.pdf | doi=10.1105/tpc.7.7.945 | title=Seed storage proteins: Structures and biosynthesis | year=1995 | last1=Shewry | first1=P. R. | last2=Napier | first2=J. A. | last3=Tatham | first3=A. S. | journal=The Plant Cell | volume=7 | issue=7 | pages=945–956 | pmid=7640527 | pmc=160892 }} < /ref >  [[Globulins]] can be taken up by weak [[salt water]]. The more common cereal proteins are [[gluten]] and [[zein]]. The minor protein of oat is [[avenin]]. 
 
 Oat protein is almost the same in [[quality]] as [[soy bean]] protein, which has been shown by the [[World Health Organization]] to be equal to [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[egg (food)|egg]] protein. < ref > {{cite book|last=Lasztity|first=Radomir|year=1999|title=The Chemistry of Cereal Proteins|publisher=Akademiai Kiado {{in lang|en}}|isbn=978-0849327636}} < /ref >  The amount of protein of the hull-less oat kernel ranges from 12 to 24%, which is the highest among cereals.
