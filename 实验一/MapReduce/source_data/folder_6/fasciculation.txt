A '''fasciculation''', or  " muscle twitch " , is a small, local, involuntary [[muscle contraction]] and [[:wikt:relaxation|relaxation]]. At times it may be visible under the skin. Deeper areas can be detected by [[Electromyography|EMG]] testing. A fasciculation can happen in any [[skeletal muscle]] in the [[:wikt:body|body]]. Fasciculations can occur in normal healthy people. < ref > Sabyasachi Sircar, ''Principles of Medical Physiology'' (Stuttgart; New York: Thieme, 2008), p. 116 < /ref >  One uncommon reason for them is due to a [[lower motor neuron]] [[lesion]] that may be caused by any of several [[disease]]s. One example would be [[Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis]].
