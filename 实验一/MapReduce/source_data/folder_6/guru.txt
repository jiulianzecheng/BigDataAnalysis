In the [[Sanskrit]] language, '''guru''' means [[teacher]]. Eastern [[religion|religions]], such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and newer movements such as [[Transcendental Meditation]] use ''guru'' as a title. They give it to a teacher (or guide) of religious matters.  
 
 In Western usage, any person who has followers may be called a guru, even if he is followed for things other than religion or philosophy. A person with knowledge or expertise may be called a guru if he influences by personal teaching. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/guru|title=Definition of guru|publisher=Merriam-Webster dictionary|accessdate=2007-10-01|archive-date=2007-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009184959/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/guru|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Modern terms which have a rather similar meaning are [[wikt:mentor|mentor]] and [[tutor]]. 
 
 == Satguru == 
 Many [[Hindu]]s have a satguru as well.The word  " guru "  means the one who removes the darkness from our heart. Satguru means true guru or true teacher. The title means that his students know that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to [[moksha|enlightenment]]. A satguru is a great [[soul]] who has realized [[God]] and is able to lead others along the path. God shines out from the satguru more brightly than from other people because he is very pure and enlightened. The satguru is devoted full time to [[religious]] life, is unmarried and has given up all possessions, personal life, family and friends. He has received an initiation from his satguru that gives him great [[spiritual]] power and authority. He can teach parents how to raise children, adults how to avoid problems and overcome any challenge in life, and in general he can make people feel close to God. < ref > ''Saivite Hindu Religion, Book Four for Children Ages 8 to 10, page 50'' < /ref >
