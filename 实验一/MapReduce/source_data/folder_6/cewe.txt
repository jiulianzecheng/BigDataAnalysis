 == History == 
 On May 1, 1912, August Friedrich Carl Wöltje founded a “photographic institute” in [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], Lower Saxony. From 1924 he expanded his business to include the sale of cameras and accessories. Shortly after the currency reform in 1948, his son-in-law Heinz Neumüller joined the company. 
 
 In 1950, Carl Wöltje opened one of the first color laboratories in [[Germany]] and, with 17 employees, supplied a regular customer base of several 100 photo shops. Cewe was founded under the name Cewe Color in 1961 by Heinz Neumüller in Oldenburg. The name came from the initials of his father-in-law, Carl Wöltje. 
 
 With increasing demand for color photos, Cewe built a large photo laboratory in 1964 on a 50,000 m2 site in Oldenburg-Kreyenbrück. In 1971 the company became active abroad for the first time, in the Netherlands. In 1973, Cewe merged with United Color in Hamburg and Bremen. 
 
 From then on, the company name was United Cewe Color companies. In the course of the following years, Cewe took over further laboratories in Germany and abroad and became the market leader for photo development in Germany in the course of the transition from black and white to color photography in the 1970s. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2009|title=Johannes Blome-Drees und Reiner Rang Die Aktivitäten von Finanzinvestoren in Deutschland am Beispiel der Cewe Color AG|url=http://www.boeckler.de/pdf/mbf_finanzinvestoren_cewecolor.pdf|access-date=2022-12-06|archive-date=2022-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221130170122/https://www.boeckler.de/pdf/mbf_finanzinvestoren_cewecolor.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 From 1980, photo retail stores opened in numerous hypermarkets and inner cities under the Ivema or Fotopoint designations. From there it was also possible to have photos printed on gifts such as mugs or T-shirts. < ref name= " :0 "  / > 
 
 From 1986 onwards, the company opened further plants in Mönchengladbach, Paris, Berlin, Worms and Dresden. In 1989, Cewe introduced the Eurocombi bag for storing photo orders. In 1992, the group of companies was restructured under the umbrella of Cewe Color Holding AG and listed on the stock exchange in 1993 by Hubert Rotharme. Cewe then expanded in France, Scandinavia and Central Europe. The company's shares have been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since 1993.
