 A '''linstock''' (or '''lintstock''') is a rod or stick that supports a slow match, which was used to light [[cannon|cannons]] in the early days of [[artillery]].  < ref > {{cite web|date=|title=Linstock Definition  & #124; Definition of Linstock at Dictionary.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Linstock|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2009-11-05}} < /ref > The linstock allowed the gunner to stand farther from the cannon as it was dangerous applying the lighted match to the touch hole at the breech of the gun: not only could the charge flash back, but the recoil of the cannon might send the carriage toward the gunner. Linstocks also had a sharp point to drive into the ground when not in use or to use as a weapon to protect the cannon.
