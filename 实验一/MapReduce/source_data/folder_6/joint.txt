 A '''joint''' is the place where two or more [[bone]]s make contact. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4074|title=Joint definition|publisher=eMedicine Dictionary|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=27 January 2012|archive-date=22 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122022930/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4074|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support. < ref name= " isbn0-443-07168-3 " > {{cite book |author=Ellis, Harold; Susan Standring; Gray, Henry David |title=Gray's anatomy: the anatomical basis of clinical practice |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005 |pages=38 |isbn=0-443-07168-3 |oclc= |doi=}} < /ref > 
 
 Joints have [[cartilage]] in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described [[Structure|structurally]] and [[Function (biology)|function]]ally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones.  
 
 == Synovial bursa == 
 A synovial bursa is a small fluid-filled sac lined by a synovial membrane. It has an inner capillary layer of [[Viscosity|viscous]] synovial fluid (bit like raw egg white). The bursa is ''a cushion between bones and tendons'' and/or muscles around a joint. This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement.
