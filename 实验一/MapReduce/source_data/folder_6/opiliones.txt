 '''Harvestmen''' are eight-legged [[arachnid]]s. Even though they are [[arachnid|arachnids]] like spiders, harvestmen are not [[spider]]s. They are in the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Opiliones'''. 
 
 More than 6,400 [[species]] of harvestmen have been discovered, although the real number of [[extant taxon|extant]] species may be more than 10,000. < ref name= " Pinto " > Pinto-da-Rocha R. Machado G.  &  Giribet G. eds. 2007. ''Harvestmen – The biology of Opiliones''. Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0-674-02343-9}} < /ref >  Well-preserved [[fossil]]s have been found in the 400-million year old [[Rhynie chert]]s of [[Scotland]]. Fossil harvestmen look surprisingly similar to modern harvestmen. Apparently, the basic body shape of harvestmen has not changed much. 
 
 In some places, harvestmen are known by the name  " daddy longlegs " , but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods: the [[crane fly]] (''Tipulidae'') and the [[Daddy long-legs spider|cellar spider]] (''Pholcidae''). 
 
 Many species of harvestmen are [[omnivore]]s--they eat anything they can find. Most of the time this is small [[insect]]s, and some [[plant]]s and [[fungi]]. Some are [[scavenger]]s. 
 
 Harvestmen are not dangerous to humans. None of the described species have poison glands. They are not  " true "  spiders even though they look like spiders in many ways. For example, harvestmen have no venom or silk glands; spiders have these. 
 
 == Anatomy == 
 Harvestmen have exceptionally long walking legs compared to their bodies, although there are also some short-legged species. In harvestmen, the two main body sections (the [[abdomen]] and [[cephalothorax]]) meet at a wide point, so that they appear to be one oval structure. In more advanced species of harvestmen, the first five segments of the abdomen are fused into a  " shield "  on the harvestman's back called the scutum. In some species, this shield is only present in males. The second pair of legs is longer than the others and work as [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. This can be hard to see in short-legged species. 
 
 The feeding apparatus (stomotheca) differs from other arachnids as they are able to eat their food in chunks, without needing to liquify it. Most species have a single pair of eyes in the middle of their heads, oriented horizontally. However, there are some eyeless species.
