 Its flattened saber teeth were protected by a bony flange from the lower jaw. It was a saber-toothed cat, but it was not a close relative of cats such as ''[[Smilodon]]''. < ref > Antón, Mauricio 2013. ''Sabertooth''. Bloomington, Indiana: University of Indiana Press. p. 104.

 ''Barbourofelis'' has been difficult to classify. It was put in  the [[Nimravidae]] by Schultz (1970) and Martin (1998).
