 An '''hexadecagon''' or '''hexakaidecagon''' is a [[Polygon|shape]] with 16 sides and 16 [[Vertex (geometry)|corner]]s. 
 
 == Regular hexadecagon == 
 A ''[[regular polygon|regular]] hexadecagon'' is a hexadecagon in which all angles are equal and all sides are congruent. Its Schläfli symbol is {16} and can be constructed as a truncated [[octagon]], t{8}, and a twice-truncated [[square]] tt{4}. A truncated hexadecagon, t{16}, is a [[triacontadigon]], {32}. 
 
 === Area === 
 The [[area]] of a regular hexadecagon with edge length ''t'' is 
 : < math > \begin{align} 
 A = 4t^2 \cot \frac{\pi}{16} = &  4t^2 \left(1+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{ 4+2\sqrt{2} }\right)\\ 
 = &  4t^2 (\sqrt{2}+1)(\sqrt{4-2\sqrt{2}}+1) 
 .\end{align} < /math > 
 
 Because the hexadecagon has a number of sides that is a [[power of two]], its area can be computed in terms of the [[circumradius]] ''R'' by truncating [[Viète's formula]]: 
 : < math > A=R^2\cdot\frac{2}{1}\cdot\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{2}{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}}=4R^2\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}. < /math > 
 
 Since the area of the circumcircle is  < math > \pi R^2, < /math >  the regular hexadecagon fills approximately 97.45% of its circumcircle. 
 
 == Dissection== 
 [[Coxeter]] states that every parallel-sided 2''m''-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the ''regular hexadecagon'', ''m''=8, and it can be divided into 28: 4 squares and 3 sets of 8 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a [[Petrie polygon]] projection of a [[8-cube]], with 28 of 1792 faces.  < ref > [[Coxeter]], Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 < /ref >  The list [http://oeis.org/A006245 A006245] enumerates the number of solutions as 1232944, including up to 16-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.

 A '''skew hexadecagon''' is a [[skew polygon]] with 24 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an hexadecagon is not generally defined. A ''skew zig-zag hexadecagon'' has vertices alternating between two parallel planes. 
 
 A '''regular skew hexadecagon''' is [[vertex-transitive]] with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexadecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a [[octagonal antiprism]] with the same D < sub > 8d < /sub > , [2 < sup > + < /sup > ,16] symmetry, order 32. The [[octagrammic antiprism]], s{2,16/3} and [[octagrammic crossed-antiprism]], s{2,16/5} also have regular skew octagons.

 In the early 16th century, [[Raphael]] was the first to construct a [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting [[The Marriage of the Virgin (Raphael)|''The Marriage of the Virgin'']] has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by [[Pietro Perugino]]. < ref > {{citation|title=Crossroads: History of Science, History of Art.
