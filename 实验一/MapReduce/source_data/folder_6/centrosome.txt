 In [[cell biology]], the '''centrosome''' is an [[organelle]] that is the main place where cell [[microtubule]]s are organized. Also, it regulates the [[cell division]] cycle, the stages which lead up to one cell dividing in two.  
 
 The centrosome was discovered by [[Edouard Van Beneden]] in 1883, < ref > Wunderlich V. 2002. JMM - past and present. ''Journal of Molecular Medicine'' '''80''' (9): 545–548. doi:10.1007/s00109-002-0374-y. PMID 12226736. < /ref >  and was described and named in 1888 by [[Theodor Boveri]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Boveri| first = Theodor| author-link = Theodor Boveri| title = Zellen-Studien II: Die Befruchtung und Teilung des Eies von Ascaris megalocephala.| publisher = Gustav Fischer Verlag| location = Jena| date = 1888| url =https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/29952 }} < /ref >

 A centrosome is composed of two [[centriole]]s at [[right angle]]s to each another. They are surrounded by a shapeless mass of [[protein]]. 
 
 == Roles of the centrosome == 
 The centrosome is copied only once per [[cell cycle]]. Each daughter cell inherits one centrosome, containing two centrioles. The centrosome replicates during the [[interphase]] of the cell cycle. During the [[prophase]] of [[mitosis]], the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome.  
 
 Centrosomes are not needed for the mitosis to happen. When the centrosomes are irradiated by a laser, mitosis proceeds with a normal spindle. In the absence of the centrosome, the microtubules of the spindle are focused to form a bipolar spindle. Many cells can completely undergo interphase without centrosomes. It also helps in cell division. < ref name=rieder > Rieder CI; Faruki S; Khodjakov A. 2001. The centrosome in vertebrates: more than a microtubule-organizing center. ''Trends in Cell Biology'' '''11''' (10): 413–9. doi:10.1016/S0962-8924(01)02085-2. ISSN 0962-8924. PMID 11567874. < /ref > 
 
 Although centrosomes are not needed for mitosis or the survival of the cell, ''they are needed for survival of the organism''. Cells without centrosomes lack certain microtubules. With centrosomes the cell division is much more accurate and efficient. Some cell types arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent, though this doesn't always happen.
