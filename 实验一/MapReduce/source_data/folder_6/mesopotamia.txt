 '''Mesopotamia''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Μεσοποταμία -  " land between rivers " ) is a historical region in the Middle East. It included most of today’s [[Iraq]], and parts of modern-day [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]. The 'two rivers' of the name referred to the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] rivers. 
 
 The land was called ''Al-Jazirah'' ( " the island " ) by the Arabs, and Egyptologist J.H. Breasted later included it in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. The region is bounded in the northeast by the [[Zagros Mountains]] and in the southeast by the Arabian Plateau. 
 
 The area is often called the cradle of [[civilization]]. The ancient [[writing]] called [[cuneiform]] was first used around 3000 BC by the [[Sumer]]ians. Historically important cities in Mesopotamia included [[Uruk]], [[Ur]], [[Nippur]], [[Nineveh]], and [[Babylon]]. 
 
 Major territorial states were the [[Akkad]]ian kingdom, the Third Dynasty of [[Ur]], and the [[Assyria]]n Empire. Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were [[Ur-Nammu]] (king of Ur), [[Sargon of Akkad]] (the founder of the Akkadian kingdom), [[Hammurabi]] (who established the Old Babylonian state), and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (who started the Assyrian Empire). 
 
 Many advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians, such as [[irrigation]], < ref > The use of small [[canal]]s in order to move water through [[field]]s. < /ref >  trade by [[river]], and [[flood]] control. Sumerians had [[agriculture]] and [[Domestication|domesticated animal]]s, or [[livestock]], from the earliest records. Babylon is likely the first city built by settled people. Mesopotamia was also the place where the [[wheel]] was first used. First it was a [[potter's wheel]] that was used to make [[clay]] pots, then Sumerians adapted it for [[transport]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 Mesopotamia is made up of different regions. Northern Mesopotamia is made up of hills and plains. The land is quite fertile due to [[season]]al rains, and the rivers and streams that come from the [[mountain]]s. Early settlers farmed the land and used [[timber]], [[metal|metals,]] and [[stone]]. Southern Mesopotamia is made up of [[marsh]]y areas and wide, flat, [[plain]]s. Cities developed along the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers which flow through the region. Early settlers had to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] the land along the banks of the rivers in order for their [[crop]]s to grow. < ref > [http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/geography/home_set.html British Museum] < /ref > 
 
 == People of Mesopotamia == 
 Mesopotamia has been conquered many times by many different people. It was the heartland of the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkad]]ian, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Assyria]]n empires. As each new group moved into the region they adopted some of the culture, traditions, and beliefs of the people who had come before. It was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] (332 BC), the [[Parthia]]ns (150 BC), the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Persian Empire]], and the [[Arab]]s (7th century). It is still one of the most fertile (and therefore valuable) parts of the [[Middle East]]. 
 
 Ancient Mesopotamia begins in the late 6th millennium BC, and ends with either the rise of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] in the 6th century BC or the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] of Mesopotamia in the 7th century CE. This long period may be divided as follows:

 == Epic of Gilgamesh == 
 
 The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] is an ancient story about a relationship between [[Gilgamesh]] and his close companion, Enkidu. Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh's equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of [[Uruk]]. Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods. Firstly, they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba, its monstrous guardian. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish [[Gilgamesh]] for turning down her advances. 
 
 The second part of the epic is about Gilgamesh's distressed reaction to Enkidu's death, which takes the form of a quest for immortality. Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero, Utnapishtim. The words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the result: 
 : " The life that you are seeking you will never find. When the gods created man they allotted to him death, but life they retained in their own keeping " .
