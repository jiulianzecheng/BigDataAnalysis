 '''Neodymium''' is a [[chemical]] [[Chemical element|element]] that has the symbol '''Nd''' on the [[periodic table]]. It has the atomic number 60 which means it has 60 [[proton]]s in an [[atom]]. Neodymium can be combined with other elements like [[iron]] and [[boron]] to create the very strong [[neodymium magnet]], these [[magnet]]s can lift up to 1000 times their own weight. Neodymium is a [[metal]] that forms a coating of [[oxide]] around itself when it is placed in air. It is usually used as neodymium magnets for [[hard disk drive]]s. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Though neodymium is called a [[rare earth metal]], it is quite common, as common as [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] or [[copper]]. Like every metal, neodymium is very shiny. It is a [[solid]] that melts at 1,024 degrees Celsius, or 1,875 degrees Fahrenheit. Neodymium is in a group of other elements called [[lanthanide]]s, which are like each other in how they behave. When neodymium is dropped into water, it slowly changes into [[neodymium hydroxide]], if the water or the neodymium itself is hot enough, the change is much faster, and the neodymium may explode. In the air, if the neodymium is hot enough, it can catch fire. Like every other metal, neodymium usually wants to get rid of its [[electron]]s, so the [[chemical compound|compounds]] it forms are usually with elements that want electrons, as [[oxygen]] does.

 The neodymium [[magnets]] used to make hard disk drives do not weaken over time: they are permanent magnets. They can also be used in [[microphone]]s or [[loudspeaker|speakers]]. [[Electric guitar]]s may use these magnets inside their pickups.
