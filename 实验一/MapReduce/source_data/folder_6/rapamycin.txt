 It is used in medicine to [[prophylaxis|prevent]] [[organ transplant]] rejection. < ref name= " Rapamune Rx info " > " Rapamune Prescribing Information "  (PDF). United States Food and Drug Administration. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. May 2015.

It inhibits activation of [[T cells]] and [[B cell]]s by reducing the production of [[interleukin-2]] (IL-2). Sirolimus is also used as a coating for [[coronary stent]]s.

 Rapamycin was first shown to extend lifespan in [[eukaryotes]] (actually, [[yeast]] cells) in 2006. < ref name= " pmid16418483 " > {{cite journal| title = Extension of chronological life span in yeast by decreased TOR pathway signaling | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–84 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16418483 | pmc = 1356109 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1381406 | last1 = Powers | first1 = R.

 In a 2009 study, the lifespans of [[mice]] fed rapamycin were increased between 28 and 38% from the beginning of treatment. That is a 9 to 14% increased maximum lifespan.

 Because rapamycin at high doses can suppress the [[immune system]], people taking rapamycin for transplant or cancer therapy are more susceptible to dangerous infections. < ref name= " Rapamune Rx info "  / >   
 
 It is thought that some dietary regimes, like [[calorie|restricting calories]] and [[methionine]], cause lifespan extension by decreasing [[mTOR]] activity. It is believed that this is achieved by limiting the essential amino acid [[leucine]], a potent activator of mTOR. The administration of leucine into the rat brain has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight via activation of the mTOR pathway. < ref > {{cite journal | title = Hypothalamic mTOR signaling regulates food intake | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | year = 2006 | volume = 312 | issue = 5775 | pages = 927–930 | pmid = 16690869 | doi = 10.1126/science.1124147 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312..927C | s2cid = 6526786 | last1 = Cota | first1 = Daniela | last2 = Proulx | first2 = Karine | last3 = Smith | first3 = Kathi A.
