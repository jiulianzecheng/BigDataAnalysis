 '''Corals''' are formed by small [[animal]]s, the [[polyp]]s of the [[phylum]] [[Cnidaria]].  
 
 ==Characteristics== 
 
 The corals are [[Ocean|marine]], either on [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] or round [[ocean]]ic islands. They live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]]. 
 
 All the polyps in a colony are [[zooid]]s: they are all [[clone]]s, genetically identical. Inside the colony they breed by [[asexual reproduction]]. They also reproduce [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]]. Colonies of the same [[species]] release [[gamete]]s together, over one, two or three nights around a full moon. 
 
 Each coral animal is like a small bag. The opening on top is the [[mouth]]. [[Tentacle]]s (little arms) around the mouth carry stinging [[nematocyst]]s, which [[Paralysis|paralyse]] the small animals eaten by the coral [[polyp]]s. 
 
 Coral usually grows in tropical oceans. A few corals grow in cold water, like the oceans around the [[British Isles]] and [[Norway]]. 
 
 == Symbiosis == 
 Most corals get energy and nutrients from [[symbiosis]] with [[photosynthetic]] [[unicellular]] [[algae]] called [[zooxanthella]]e. Such corals need sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, typically at depths less than 60 metres (200 & nbsp;ft). < ref name=MilneBay/ > 
 
 Many corals (and some other [[cnidaria]]) live with zooxanthellae of the [[genus]] ''[[Symbiodinium]]'', which are [[dinoflagellate]]s. Usually, each polyp harbours one [[species]] of algae. By photosynthesis, these provide energy for the coral, and help [[Calcium carbonate|calcification]]. < ref name=MilneBay > {{cite web

 The algae benefit from a safe place to live and consume the polyp's [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]]ous waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, the coral often ejects the algae. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/world/asia/climate-related-death-of-coral-around-world-alarms-scientists.html|title=Climate-Related Death of Coral Around World Alarms Scientists|first=Michelle|last=Innis|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 April 2016|publisher=}} < /ref >  Mass ejections are known as [[coral bleaching]], because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration. < ref > Other colors are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) < /ref >  Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species, at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies. < ref name=Toller >

 == Coral reefs == 
 A [[coral reef]] is a place where many corals grow. The reef make a good home for many other animals, such as [[fish]], [[crab]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[sponge]]s. 
 
 Each coral animal secretes [[calcium carbonate]] around itself. This makes the solid structure of the colony. When the animal dies, new polyps live on top of the older structure. The rock they make is also called coral. 
 
 They are called ''coral skeletons''. Each different kind of coral colony builds a different kind of skeleton, so that colonies can be shaped like a [[brain]], a [[mushroom]], a [[cabbage]], or many other things. With all these corals gathered together building skeletons around themselves, large coral [[wikt:formation|formations]] are made. Together, all the coral formations in one place make up a coral reef. 
 
 Coral can also be used as [[jewellery]].
