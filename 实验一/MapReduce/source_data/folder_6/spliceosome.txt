A '''spliceosome''' is a complex of special [[RNA]] and [[protein]] subunits. Spliceosomes are amazingly complex molecular machines. < ref name=Staley/ >  They remove [[intron]]s from a [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] pre-mRNA segment. This process is generally referred to as [[RNA splicing|splicing]]. 
 
 Each spliceosome is composed of five small [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] RNAs, ([[snRNA]])s, and more than 50 proteins. < ref name=Staley > {{cite journal |author=Staley JP, Guthrie C |title=Mechanical devices of the spliceosome: motors, clocks, springs, and things |journal=Cell |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=315â€“26 |year=1998 |pmid=9476892 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80925-3|s2cid=6208113 }} < /ref >
