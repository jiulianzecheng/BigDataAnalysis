 A '''blenny''' is a member of a large [[order (biology)|order]] of [[teleost]] [[fish]] called the '''Blenniiformes'''. The suborder has about 900 [[species]] in 151 [[genera]]. 
 
 Blennies are generally small fish. They have long bodies (some almost [[eel]]-like), and relatively large eyes and mouths. Their dorsal fins are continuous and long. The pelvic fins have a single embedded spine, and are short and slender. The tail fin is rounded.  
 
 The blunt heads of blennies often have whisker-like structures called ''cirri''. As generally [[benthic]] fish, blennioids spend much of their time on or near the sea floor. 
 
 They are quite similar in form to some [[goby|gobies]].
