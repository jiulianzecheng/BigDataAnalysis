'''Kodomo''' is a type of anime aimed at all children, regardless of gender. It is often educational, teaching social skills like sharing, teamwork or just getting along with others. Characters in here could have supernatural or mutant powers as they help each other fight evil characters or 'bad guys', or simply complete a mission or task. An example would be pokemon, which is a really popular anime for kids which was originally adopted by the game. This is aimed at the kids because of the popular game. Pokemon go! There are other versions too. Generally, to say, TV-PG would be the highest.
