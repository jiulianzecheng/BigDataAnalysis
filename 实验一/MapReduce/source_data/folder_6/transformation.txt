In mathematics, a '''transformation''' is a rule that describes relations between two different [[coordinate system]]s and points in them. 
 
 Some examples are [[Translation (geometry)|translation]], [[Dilation (geometry)|dilation]], [[rotation]], [[reflection]], [[shear mapping]], [[point reflection]], and [[circle inversion]]. Any [[wikt:Combination|combination]] of transformations is also a transformation.
