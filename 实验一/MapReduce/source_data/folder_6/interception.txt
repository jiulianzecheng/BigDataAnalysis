{{redirect|Interception}} 
 An '''interception''' or '''intercept''' is a move in [[football]] that happens when a player on the defensive team catches a ball from the [[quarterback]] instead of the intended receiver. When this is done, the player's team who had caught the [[ball]], would gain [[possession]] of it. Many [[league]]s use interceptions, some are [[Canadian football]] and [[American football]], as well as [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[Australian rules football]] and [[Gaelic football]]. The most common players to get interceptions are defensive backs.
