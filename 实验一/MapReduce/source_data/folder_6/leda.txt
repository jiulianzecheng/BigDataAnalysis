'''Leda''' is a person in [[Greek mythology]].  She was the daughter of a king, and the wife of King [[Tyndareos]] of [[Sparta]]. 
 
 [[Zeus]] seduced her as a [[swan]], and Leda laid two eggs.  When they hatched, her children [[Helen]],  [[Klytaimnestra]], [[Castor and Pollux]]) came out.  Helen was a child of Zeus, and the myths vary on who was the father of the others.
