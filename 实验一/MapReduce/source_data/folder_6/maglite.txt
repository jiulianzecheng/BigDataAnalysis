'''Maglite''' is a brand of [[flashlight]]. There are several sizes available, ranging from a 6 D [[battery]] halogen flashlight to a single AAA battery keychain flashlight. They are made in the USA. 
 
 ==Construction== 
 Most Maglite parts are made from anodized [[aluminum]]. There is a [[chromium|chrome]]-plated [[plastic]] reflector inside an aluminum housing at the top. Underneath the reflector is the [[lightbulb|light bulb]] or [[LED]], which is attached to an aluminum tube. The batteries are inside the aluminum tube. A screw-on aluminum cap with a chrome-plated steel spring on the bottom of the flashlight holds the batteries in, and is unscrewed to replace the batteries. The spring is also the connection to the negative terminal (anode) < !-- Not a typo. The negative side of a battery is the anode because a battery is an electricity producer, not a consumer. -- >  on the batteries. There is no wire carrying the current to the bulb at the top of the flashlight - the aluminum tube is the [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]. On the smaller flashlights, the flashlight is turned on by slightly unscrewing the flashlight head. The larger flashlights have a push-button switch on the side of the aluminum tube.
