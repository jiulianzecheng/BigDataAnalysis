 '''Atheris''' is a genus of [[Poison|venomous]] vipers found only in [[rain forest]] areas of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. There are currently eight species found. Atheris are commonly known as  " ''Bush Vipers'' " . They are all arboreal (meaning they live in [[tree]]s), but they can sometimes be seen on the ground. 
 
 == Description== 
 Bush Vipers are small [[snake]]s, with adults growing to the size of around 40 to 78 cm. They all have broad, triangular heads with large eyes and a slender body. 
 
 == Where they live== 
 The Bush Viper lives in [[rain forest]] areas of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], far from humans, but some Bush Vipers are threatened because of habitat loss.

 == Feeding== 
 Bush Vipers eat small [[amphibian]]s like [[frog]]s, and [[toad]]s, [[reptile]]s like [[lizard]]s and other [[snake]]s, [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s. They ambush their prey by hanging on to a branch of a [[tree]], waiting for a prey to come close, then jump on the prey and inject [[Poison|venom]], and then swallow it. Some Bush Vipers in zoos only eat [[mice]] and small birds, but there have been reports on some eating each other. 
 
 == Reproduction== 
 All Bush Vipers are [[viviparous]], meaning they give live birth. They mate between September and November, and females give to their young in March or April.  
 
 == Venom== 
 The venom of Bush Vipers is [[hemotoxic]], it causes pain, swelling, and stop blood clotting. There is no [[antivenom]], but there has been reports on [[Echis]] antivenom working on some Bush Viper's bites.
