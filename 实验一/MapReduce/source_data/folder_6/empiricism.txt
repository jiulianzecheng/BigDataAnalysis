 In [[philosophy]], '''empiricism''' is a theory that states that all [[knowledge]] comes from [[experience]].  
 
 'Experience' is sometimes translated as 'sense data', i.e. we cannot know anything except by [[information]] which comes through our [[sense]]s. 
 
 The British philosophers [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], clarified some of its basic ideas in the 17th and 18th century, building on the ideas of classical philosopher [[Aristotle]].  
 
 Empiricism is one of several competing views about how we know things, part of the branch of philosophy called [[epistemology]], or  " study of knowledge " . [[Materialism]] and [[physicalism]] share some of attitudes of empiricism.
