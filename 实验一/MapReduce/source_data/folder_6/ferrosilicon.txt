'''Ferrosilicon''' is a combination of [[iron]] and [[silicon]]. Between 15% and 90% of ferrosilicon is silicon. Ferrosilicon is made by burning [[sand]] while thereâ€™s iron in the sand. Ferrosilicons that contain the most silicon are made in [[electric arc furnace]]s. 
 
 [[Perryite]] is a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] that is a combination of iron and silicon. 
 
 When ferrosilicon is touching [[water]], it may slowly make [[hydrogen]]. Ferrosilicon is used by the military to quickly produce [[hydrogen]] for [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]]. The [[chemical reaction]] uses [[sodium hydroxide]], ferrosilicon, and water. The generator is small enough to fit in a truck and needs only a small amount of electric power. The materials are stable and not [[combustion|combustible]], and they do not make hydrogen until mixed. < ref > [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091069_1993091069.pdf Report No 40: The ferrosilicon process for the generation of hydrogen] < /ref > 
 
 Ferrosilicon is used to get oxygen out of steel. [[Magnesium]] is made by combining ferrosilicon with [[dolomite]].
