 '''Mercy''' can refer to a [[compassion]] < nowiki/ > ate behavior by those in [[power]] (for example, ''mercy'' shown by a [[judge]] toward a criminal by not punishing him (or her) as much as he (or she) might be punished). It may also mean compassionate action by a third party (e.g. a trip out of ''mercy'' trying to treat [[sick]] [[children]] in [[Africa]]). The word is very common in several [[religion]]s (for example, the mercy of [[God]]).
