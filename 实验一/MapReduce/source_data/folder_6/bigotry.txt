A '''bigot''' is a person who is intolerant toward those who hold different opinions from oneself. It is often mistakenly thought to be intolerance to the opinions or beliefs of others. Hence, a person who is tolerant of a another person with different opinions or beliefs but is not tolerant of those opinions or beliefs is not a bigot.  
 
 The origin of the word ''bigot'' in [[English language|English]] dates back to at least [[1598]], via [[French language|French]]. It started with the sense of  " religious [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]] " , especially a woman. 
 
 The word ''bigot'' is often used as a [[pejorative]] term against a person who is obstinately devoted to negative prejudices, even when those prejudices are proven to be false.

 == Etymology == 
 The exact origin of the word is unknown, but may have come from the [[German language|German]] ''bei'' and ''gott'', or the English ''by God''. [[William Camden]] wrote that the [[Normans]] were first called bigots, when their Duke [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], who receiving Gisla, daughter of [[Charles the Simple|King Charles]], in marriage, and with her the investiture of the dukedom, refused to kiss the king's foot in token of subjection, unless the king would hold it out for that purpose. And being urged to it by those present, Rollo answered hastily,  " No by God " , whereupon the king turning about, called him ''bigot''; which name passed from him to his people. This is likely fictional, however, as Gisla is unknown in Frankish sources.
