'''Aristeia''' describes a [[hero]]'s moment of greatest glory, the moment when a hero kills the most people. It is a Greek word and comes from ''aristos'' which means  " the best " . It is used many times in [[Homer]]'s [[epic poem]]. the ''[[Iliad]]''. Several heroes in the ''Illiad'' had moments of aristeia. These include [[Agamemnon]], [[Diomedes]], and [[Hector]]. < ref > Louden, Bruce (2006).
