 '''Bloodletting''' is the practice  of withdrawing [[blood]] from a [[patient]] to cure a [[disease]]. The practice was widely used in [[Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. People stopped using it in the [[19th century]]. The idea of bloodletting comes from an ancient system of medicine called [[Humorism]]: This system states, that there are different ''humors'' in the body. To remain healthy, a patient had to keep these humours in balance. Bloodletting was the most common [[medicine|medical]] practice performed by [[physician]]s from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years. < ref name= " blood " > {{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/bloodletting.aspx|title=Bloodletting|access-date=2009-07-12|publisher=British Science Museum|year=2009|archive-date=2009-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415024002/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/techniques/bloodletting.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 It was found that only in very few cases, this treatment helps cure a disease. The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific [[medical condition|conditions]]. < ref name= " leech " > {{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/06/health/he-31093|title=Modern Bloodletting and Leeches|access-date=2009-07-12|newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=6 August 2001 | first=Rosie | last=Mestel}} < /ref >  There was no other treatment for [[hypertension]]. Bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing [[blood pressure]] by reducing blood volume. < ref name= " centuries " > {{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/redgold/basics/bloodlettinghistory.html|title=Bloodletting Over the Centuries|access-date=2009-07-12|publisher=Gilbert R. Seigworth, M.D. |year=1980}} < /ref >  The problem with hypertension is that it is difficult to diagonse from its [[symptom]]s. Modern methods directly measure blood pressure. In Antiquity, this  effect was therefore unintentional. In most cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. < ref name= " harmful " > {{cite web|url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/essays/fair_tests/why-fair-tests-are-needed.html|title=Why fair tests are needed|access-date=2009-07-12|website=jameslindlibrary.org|year=2009|archive-date=2007-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102144950/http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/essays/fair_tests/why-fair-tests-are-needed.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The diseases where bloodletting actually helps include [[Polycythemia vera]]. In this disease, the number of [[red blood cell]]s is increased, which changes the [[viscosity]] of the blood. Another disease is [[Polycythemia]], which also leads to an increased number of red blood cells.
