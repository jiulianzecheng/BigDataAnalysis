 The '''rifle''' is a [[gun]] with a stock to brace against the [[shoulder]] and a [[barrel (weapons)|barrel]] with [[:wikt:twist|twisting]] [[groove]]s.  The grooves are called [[rifling]] and make [[bullet]]s spin as they fly through the air. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefirearms.guide/guns/early-firearm-history |title=Early Firearms History |author= |website= |publisher=The Firearms Guide |accessdate=28 July 2016 |archive-date=1 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701114942/http://www.thefirearms.guide/guns/early-firearm-history |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of [[bullet]]s using different amounts of [[gunpowder]].

 Rifles can work in different ways. Some rifles have what is called a [[bolt action]]. A small [[wikt:handle|handle]] is used to move a part of the rifle called a  " bolt " . By moving the bolt backward, then forward, allows the shooter put a bullet in the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] ready for firing. It also [[wikt:eject|eject]]s any spent shells still in the chamber from any previously fired [[bullet|rounds]]. The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some rifles are [[semi-automatic]]s, where a bullet is loaded (automatically) and fired each time the trigger is pulled. < ref name=guideMJ > {{cite web |url=http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/semi-automatic-gun-assault-weapon-definitions |title=A Non-Gun-Owner's Guide to Guns |author=Adam Weinstein |date=21 December 2012 |website= |publisher=Mother Jones |accessdate=6 August 2016}} < /ref >  Some are [[fully automatic]], which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger. < ref name=guideMJ/ >  The automatic rifle stops firing when the trigger is released or it runs out of ammunition. < ref name=guideMJ/ >
