 '''Laurentia''' is a large continental [[craton]]. It forms the ancient geological core of the [[North America]]n continent.  
 
 Originally, it included the core of [[Greenland]] and the northwestern part of [[Scotland]], known as the [[Hebridean Terrane]]. Laurentia is also called the '''North American Craton'''. It is a modern geological feature, and it is also a very ancient geological core made of [[igneous rock]]. It is nearly four [[billion]] years old. 
 
 At times in the past, Laurentia has been part of larger continents and [[supercontinent]]s. It is an assembly of smaller [[tectonic plate]]s which merged early in the [[Archaean]] [[era]]. As the plates moved together, a huge range of mountains formed. Much later, in the [[Proterozoic]] era, small plates and oceanic islands collided with and fused with the ever-growing Laurentia. Together they made the huge, stable craton we see today as the north and center of North America and the west of Greenland. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Dalziel I.W.D. 1992 |title=On the organization of American plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241}} < /ref >   
 
 Over a billion years ago, the Grenville [[Orogeny]] in the [[Canadian Shield]] made jagged peaks, higher than any of today's mountains. Millions of years of erosion have changed these mountains to rolling hills. < ref name= " Canadian Encyclopedia " > {{cite web|last1=James-Abra|first1=Erin|title=Canadian Shield|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/shield/|website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=24 January 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 The remaining, western, part of North America was added much later, after [[Pangaea]] split up, and the Americas moved west from [[Eurasia]] and [[Gondwana]]. 
 
 The craton is named after the [[Laurentian Mountains]], a range to the north of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. 
 
 == Rocks as seen today == 
 The cratonic rocks are [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]], while the overlying [[sedimentary rock]]s are composed mostly of [[limestone]]s, [[sandstone]]s, and [[shale]]s. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Sloss |first=L.L. |year=1988 |chapter=Conclusions, Chapter 17: The Geology of North America |volume=D-2 |title=Sedimentary cover - North American Craton |pages=493–496 }} < /ref >  These sedimentary rocks were deposited from 650 to 290 million years ago. < ref > {{Cite journal |author=Burgess, P.M.

 The southwestern portion of Laurentia consists of [[Precambrian]] [[Basement (geology)|basement]] rocks deformed by continental collisions (violet area of the image above). This area has been subjected to considerable [[rift (geology)|rifting]] as the [[Basin and Range Province]] and has been stretched up to 100% of its original width. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/basinrange.html |title=Geologic provinces of the United States: Basin and Range Province |publisher=USGS.gov website |accessdate=9 November 2009 |archive-date=25 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125163038/http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/basinrange.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The area has a history of major [[volcanic eruption]]s.
