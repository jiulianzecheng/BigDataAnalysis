 The word '''phallus''' refers to an erect [[penis]], to a penis-shaped object such as a [[dildo]], or to a mimetic image of an erect penis. 
 
 Any object that symbolically resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus, or as being ''phallic'' (as in 'phallic symbol'). Such symbols represent the fertility associated with the male sexual organ, and the male [[orgasm]]. 
 
 == Culture == 
 === Symbol of sex and fertility === 
 When an erect penis is shown in art, it is often called a phallus ({{respelled|p=on| < small > FA < /small > -ləs}}). [[Eroticism|Erotic]] (sexually exciting) art has shown phalluses for a very long time. Pictures of men with erections appear on [[Ancient history|ancient]] objects and in paintings. 
 
 The erect penis was also a [[symbol]] or sign of [[health]] and [[fertility]] (the ability to give life). The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a [[cave]] in [[Germany]]. It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that is about 28,000 years old. < ref > {{cite news|author=Jonathan Amos|title=Ancient phallus unearthed in cave|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 July 2005}} < /ref > 
 
 From the fourth [[millennium]] [[Anno Domini|B.C.]] (4000–3001 B.C.), [[Ancient Egypt]]ians [[worship]]ped Min as the [[gods|god]] of [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]] and the maker of all things. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|author=F.

 === Ancient Greece === 
 The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] believed in a god called ''Priapus'' who had a very large penis that was always erect. He was thought to protect [[livestock]] (animals kept by humans for food, milk, leather or wool), [[fruit|fruit plants]] and [[garden]]s, and [[sex organ#Men|men's sex organs]]. He was also seen as able to chase away [[evil]], and as a protector of [[sailor]]s, [[fishing|fishermen]] and others needing good [[luck]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Priapus|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Priapus|editor=Hugh Chisholm|encyclopedia=[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|The Encyclopædia Britannica]]|edition=11th|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1910–1911}} < /ref >  The oldest piece of writing about Priapus that is known is a [[comedy]] (a funny or silly [[Play (theatre)|play]]) written some time in the fourth [[century]] B.C.

Donkeys would sometimes be killed and [[offering|offered]] to him, but gifts of fish, flowers, fruit and vegetables were also very common. < ref name=OCD/ >  Statues of Priapus were often placed at doorways and crossroads (places where two roads crossed).

 ==== Herma ==== 
 {{see|Herma}} 
 A '''Herma''', or '''herm''', is a sculpture with a head, and perhaps a torso, above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. The form originated in [[Ancient Greece]], and was adopted by the Romans, and revived at the [[Renaissance]]. 
 
 In [[ancient Greece]] the statues had an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] function, and were placed at crossings and borders as protection. [[Hermes]] was a phallic god, associated with [[fertility]], luck, roads and borders. His name comes from the word ''herma''. In [[Athens]], they were placed outside houses for good luck and protection. They would be adorned with garlands or wreaths and anointed with olive oil to obtain luck. 
 
 ===Ancient India=== 
 [[Shiva]], perhaps the most ancient of the [[India]]n deities, and the third of the [[Hindu Trinity]]—one of the most widely worshipped and edified deity in the Hindu pantheon, is worshipped often in the form of the [[lingam]], or phallus. Evidence of phallic worship in the [[India]] date back to prehistoric times. Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized  " heads " , or the glans, are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad. 
 
 The famous man-size lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in the Chitoor Distirct of the Indian State of [[Andhra Pradesh]], better known as the Gudimallam Lingam, is about 1.5 metres in height, carved in polished black granite. Dated back to ca. 2300-2800 BC, it is one of the existing lingams from the pre-Buddhist period. The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent, bulbous head, and an anthropomorphic form of Shiva carved in high relief on the shaft. Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries, and existing lingams from before the 6th century show a more leaning towards the naturalistic style, with the glans clearly indicated. 
 
 == Modern views == 
 Today, phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies (except in [[pornography|pornographic movies]] which show people having sex with each other). This is because many people think that showing a man's penis when it is erect is obscene (not decent).
