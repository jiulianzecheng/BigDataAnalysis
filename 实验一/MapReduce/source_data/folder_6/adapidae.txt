The '''Adapidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of extinct [[primates]] that radiated in the [[Eocene]] epoch between about 55 and 34 million years ago.  
 
 Their skeleton looks like they were strepsirrhines (members of the group including the living [[lemurs]], [[lorises]], and [[bushbaby|bushbabies]]). 
 However, though there are similarities, there are some key elements missing compared to modern strepsirrhines. < ref > Gingerich P.D. and R.D. Martin 1981.
