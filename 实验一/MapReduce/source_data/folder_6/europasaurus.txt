 '''''Europasaurus''''' is a basal [[sauropod]] from the [[titanosaur]] [[clade]], but very much smaller than usual. < ref name=Sander > Sander P.M. ''et al'' 2006. Bone histology indicates insular dwarfism in a new late Jurassic sauropod dinosaur. ''Nature'' '''441''' (7094): 739–741.

 This [[quadruped]]al [[herbivorous]] [[dinosaur]] lived during the [[Upper Jurassic]] (middle [[Kimmeridgian]], about 154 million years ago). It was found in northern [[Germany]]. It is an example of [[insular dwarfism]]. This means it probably came from an isolated sauropod population on an island in the Lower [[Saxony]] basin. 
 
 Small sauroopods with an adult body mass less than five tonnes are rare, and small sauropod bones usually come from juveniles. This species was a small adult, based on its bone [[histology]]. It was a dwarf species.  
 
 There are fossils from more than 11 individuals of 1.7 to 6.2 m in total body length. These size differences between the specimens are due to growth stages, from juveniles to fully grown individuals. The little dinosaurs must have lived on one of the large islands around the Lower Saxony basin.  
 
 A similar discovery was made in [[Transylvania]] at the start of the 20th century. a local [[aristocrat]], [[Franz Nopcsa]], found the fossils on his estate. He realised they might have lived on an island, because he knew that dwarf elephants had lived on islands in the [[Ice Age]]. < ref > Barras, Colin 2014. Did dinosaurs exist as dwrfs?  ''BBC News''. [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20140916-why-dwarf-dinosaurs-were-such-a-big-deal] < /ref >  Nopsca's estate was ruined by [[World War I]], but his find was recorded as ''[[Magyarosaurus]]''.
