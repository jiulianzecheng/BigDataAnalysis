'''Hippolyta''' ({{lang-el|Ἱππολύτη}}, ''Hippolyte'') was one of the queens of the [[Amazons]] in [[Greek mythology]]. She was a fierce warrior. She was mostly famous for her magical [[girdle]] (or war belt in other accounts), given to her by her father, [[Ares]], the god of war. The hero [[Heracles]], for his Ninth Labor, had to get her girdle, bring it back to the city of Mycenae, and give it to [[Admete]], daughter of King [[Eurystheus]], as a gift.
