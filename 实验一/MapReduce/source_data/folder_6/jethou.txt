 '''Jethou''' is a small island that is part of the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. It is privately [[lease]]d, and not open to the public. 
 
 It is immediately south of [[Herm]] and has an area of approximately 44 & nbsp;acres (18 ha). 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Image:Herm, Sark and Jethou.jpg|left|thumb|An aerial shot showing Jethou centre right next to its bigger neighbour [[Herm]], with [[Sark]] in the background and the east coast of [[Guernsey]].]] 
 It is said that in AD 709 a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Herm. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.islandlife.org/Herm.htm|title=About Herm|publisher=|access-date=2011-05-11|archive-date=2015-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816183442/http://www.islandlife.org/Herm.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The island's name contains the ''[[-hou]]'' suffix, which means  " a small island " . 
 
 In 1416, it became part of [[Henry V of England]]'s estate.  It is still a Crown lease, and is owned by the States of [[Guernsey]]. 
 
 ===Modern history=== 
 From 1920 to 1923 it was leased by [[Compton MacKenzie]] along with [[Herm]] and remained part of that estate for years, although it is currently part of a different one. 
 
 The British 1957 musical ''[[Free as Air]]'' by [[Dorothy Reynolds]]  &  [[Julian Slade]] was set on the fictitious island of 'Terhou', which was based on Jethou. 
 
 On the top is a marker. It is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby [[Crevichon]]. 
 
 From September 1964 until December 1971 the island was occupied by the Faed family consisting of Mr Angus Faed, his wife Susan Faed and their four children, Colin, Erik, Colette and Amanda. Mrs. Susan Faed was the 22nd tenant of Jethou. 
 
 It is flanked by two [[islet]]s, [[Crevichon]] to the north and [[Fauconniere]] to the south. There is one house on the island and two cottages as well as a large garage where vehicles such as [[quad bike]]s and [[tractor]]s are stored. 
 
 It is now leased by Sir [[Peter Ogden]] of IT company [[Computacenter]]. 
 
 ==Politics== 
 Unlike the largely autonomous islands of [[Sark]] and [[Alderney]] within the Bailiwick, Jethou cannot pass its own laws.  It is administered by the States of Guernsey, < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/ICESCR-report-part1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-05-11 |archive-date=2012-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117071111/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/ICESCR-report-part1.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and elects members to the [[States of Deliberation]] as part of the St. Peter Port South electoral district. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/government/general-election---23-4-2008/ |title=States of Guernsey: General Election â€“ 23.4.2008 |access-date=2011-05-11 |archive-date=2011-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230000139/http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/government/general-election---23-4-2008/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Wildlife== 
 At the east of Jethou, [[Atlantic Puffin|puffins]] can be seen swimming off the rocks. 
 
 They also nest there in the east clifftop.
