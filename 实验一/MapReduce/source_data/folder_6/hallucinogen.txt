 '''Hallucinogens''' are [[chemical substance]]s which temporarily change the way people see the world. Hallucinogens cause [[hallucination]]s. People no longer perceive reality as it is, but they see a reality that is distorted by their [[emotion]]s. A person who is under the influence of a hallucionogen is said to be ''having a trip''. 
 
 Hallucinogens have probably been used in the context of a [[cult]]ic or [[Religion|religious]] function as long as there were [[human]]s. 
 
 There are different kinds of hallucinogens: 
 * [[Psychedelic|Psychedelic drugs]]: these are the  " classic hallucinogens " 
 * [[Dissociative]]s: They make people feel as if they were no longerpart of their surroundings. 
 * [[Deliriant]]s produce a state of [[delirium]], or [[confusion]]. 
 
 Most hallucinogens are highly [[Addiction|addictive]]. This means that the user will want to take the drug over and over again. It also means that there will be some effect of [[Drug tolerance|getting used]] to the drug. In the long run, more and more of the drug will need to be taken, to get the same effect. 
 
 People that are under the unintended influence of a hallucinogen may need immediate help, as in a [[medical emergency]].
