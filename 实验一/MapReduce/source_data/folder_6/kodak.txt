 '''Eastman Kodak Company''' was started by [[George Eastman]] and [[Henry A. Strong]] in 1881. They made their [[headquarters]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. It began as the Eastman [[Dry plate]] [[company]]. The company made [[Photographic plates]] for [[Photographers]]. It changed from a partnership to a corporation in 1884. In 1888 it changed its name again to the Eastman Kodak Company. This is when they released their first hand-held [[camera]] called the Kodak. It used a roll of [[photographic film]] which the company had started making in 1885. It was a camera simple enough for anyone to take [[picture]]s. Eastman Kodak re-[[invention|invented]] photography and became an [[United States|American]] success story. But their success would not last. 
   
 == History == 
 
 At first photographers used glass plates they had to coat with an [[emulsion]]. < ref name=Davenport22.23 > Alma Davenport, ''The History of Photography: An Overview'' (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1999), pp. 22–23 < /ref >  But they had to be used within minutes of being coated. They also had to be [[Photographic processing|processed]] into a picture right away. < ref name=Davenport22.23/ >  In 1878, Eastman successfully created dry plates that could be coated with a [[gelatin]] [[solution]]. These could be used at the photographer's convenience. They did not require all the heavy equipment wet plates did. Eastman decided to go into [[business]] selling them. < ref > Carl W. Ackerman, ''George Eastman: Founder of Kodak and the Photography Business'' (Washington, DC: BeardBooks, 2000), pp. 26–27 < /ref >  He [[Invention|invented]] a machine to [[Mass production|mass-produce]] dry plates. In 1888, the company sold the first Kodak box cameras. The [[slogan]] was  " you press the button, we do the rest " . < ref name=Hall376 > ''American Icons'', eds. Dennis Hall; Susan G. Hall (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), p. 376 < /ref >   For $24 [[USD]] the camera came already loaded with film capable of taking 100 pictures. < ref name=Davenport22.23/ >  The camera was sent back to the factory where for $10 the film was developed into pictures. These cameras first used paper [[Photographic film|film]] but later turned to [[Nitrocellulose]] film. < ref name=Peres78 > ''The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography'', 4th Edition, ed. Michael R. Peres (Amsterdam; Boston: Elsevier/Focal Press, 2007), p. 78 < /ref >  An indexing roller to hold film was invented by David Houston. It had square holes in the edge of the film to advance the film with no waste or [[Multiple exposure]]s. < ref name=Peres78/ >  But Eastman did not want to pay to [[license]] his [[patent]]. So they bought his patent in 1899. < ref name=Peres78/ >  Kodak kept making dry plates until that market dried up. Their main [[profit]] was in film and film developing papers and chemicals. They made film for the [[movie]] industry, 16mm film for hobby [[filmmaking]] and cameras of all kinds. In the mid- 1920s they came out with color film. < ref name=Peres78/ >  In 1929 Kodak created motion picture film for adding sound to motion pictures. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/Our_Company/History_of_Kodak/Milestones_-_chronology/1878-1929.htm |title=1878-1929 |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=n.d. |website= |publisher=Kodak |accessdate=30 August 2014 |archive-date=23 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823030506/http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/Our_Company/History_of_Kodak/Milestones_-_chronology/1878-1929.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >

 In 1947 [[Edwin H. Land]] invented the [[Polaroid]] [[instant camera]]. < ref name=Davenport25.26 > Alma Davenport, ''The History of Photography: An Overview'' (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1999), pp. 25–26 < /ref >  The camera could develop its own pictures inside the camera in 60 seconds. Within five years Polaroid sold over a million cameras. < ref name=Davenport25.26/ >  Kodak took notice. Since Kodak held 80% of the market for photographic development, instant cameras were a real threat. Kodak quickly came out with their own instant camera. < ref name=Cohan > {{cite news |title=How Success Killed Eastman Kodak |author=Peter Cohan |newspaper=Forbes |date=1 October 2011 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2011/10/01/how-success-killed-eastman-kodak/ |accessdate=30 August 2014}} < /ref >  Land [[Lawsuit|sued]] Kodak for $12 [[billion]] for using its technology.

 Fujifilm, the [[Japan]]ese photography company, began selling inexpensive film in the [[United States]] in the 1980s. < ref name=Cohan/ >  Since their film cost much less than Kodak's, by 1999 they had a large share of the film market. < ref name=Cohan/ >  Kodak lost millions of dollars and had many [[layoff]]s. < ref name=Cohan/ >  When [[Digital camera]]s became popular, Kodak quickly joined that market. By 1999 they were the second largest maker of digital cameras. But they lost $60 on each one they sold. < ref name=Cohan/ > 
 
 Kodak made so many [[marketing]] [[wikt:mistake|mistakes]] that its [[stock]] dropped from $76 a [[Share (finance)|share]] in 1999 to $25 in 2004. < ref name=Markham259 > Jerry W.
