 The '''rebab''' is a [[musical instrument]] from the [[Middle East]]. It is a very old instrument, and is probably the origin of the [[medieval]] [[rebec]]. It is a string instrument and is played by bowing or plucking the strings. It has a body made out of a solid piece of wood, with straight sides and a round back. The belly of the rebab is made of skin. The pegs used to tune the strings are like those on a [[violin]], and are pushed into holes on the side of the peg box. The peg box is made from a separate piece of wood. < ref > {{cite book | last = Montagu| first =Jeremy | title =The World of Medieval and Renaissance Musical Instruments | publisher =Ure Smith | date =1976 | location =[[Sydney]] | pages = 28 | isbn =0725403144 }} < /ref >
