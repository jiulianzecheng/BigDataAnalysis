 '''Ultramarine''' is a [[blue]] [[pigment]], and the name of a [[blue]] colour. The pigment is found naturally. It is ground down from a [[mineral]] called [[Lazurite]], the main component of [[lapis lazuli]]. < ref > Buxbaum G. ''et al'' 2012. Pigments, inorganic, 3. Colored pigments. In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.n20_n02}} < /ref >  The colour is due to the presence of S−3 [[anion]]s (trisulfur). 
 
 == Synthetic ultramarine== 
 Synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine, since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more uniform than natural ultramarine and therefore [[diffusion|diffuse]] light more evenly. 
 
 Artificial, like natural, ultramarine has a magnificent blue colour. Since it is not affected by light or contact with oil or [[lime]], it is used in [[painting]].  
 
 A small addition of [[zinc]]-white ([[zinc oxide]]) causes the colour to become less vivid (~bright). Synthetic ultramarine, invented in the 1820s, is very cheap. It is largely used for wall painting, the printing of paperhangings and [[calico]]. It is also used to correct the yellowish tinge found in things meant to be white, such as [[linen]], [[paper]], etc. [[Bluing (fabric)|Bluing]] or  " laundry blue "  is a solution of synthetic ultramarine (sometimes, [[prussian blue]]) that is used for this purpose when washing white clothes. Large amounts are used in making [[paper]], especially the kind of pale blue writing paper popular in [[Britain]]. During World War I, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] painted the outer roundels with a colour based on ultramarine blue. This became BS 108(381C) Aircraft Blue. It was replaced in the 1960s by a new color based on phthalocyanine blue, BS110(381C) Roundel Blue.
