 '''Nefertiti''' (pronounced at the time something like *nafratiːta < ref > James Allen, Middle Egyptian, (Cambridge University Press), 2004. < /ref > ) (c. 1370 BC {{ndash}} c. 1330 BC) was the Great Royal Wife of the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]. She was the mother-in-law and may have been stepmother of the Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]]. After her husband died, Nefertiti may have also ruled as pharaoh under the name Neferneferuaten.   However, some archaeologists do not think Nefertiti was Neferneferuaten. < ref > Dodson, Aidan 2009. ''Amarna sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian counter-reformation''.

 Her name in English means  " the beautiful (or perfect) woman has come " . Nefertiti was one of the most powerful queens in Ancient Egypt. 
 
 == Background == 
 Nefertiti was the first and most loved wife of [[Akhenaten]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/Neferneferuaten.html|title=Nefertiti – Beautiful and Powerful Queen of Ancient Egypt|website=Osiris Tours - Luxury Travel {{!}} Private Guided Tours|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-26}} < /ref >  she might have reigned under the name of Ankhkheperure Neferneferuatan. She had 6 daughters with Akhenaten.  
 
 == Mystery == 
 There are many tales about Nefertiti being born as a royal and her father being pharaoh Ay, but they are not confirmed. So it would be unlikely that she did become a pharaoh without royal blood. Her daughter Meritaten was born a royal, so she had more of a chance of becoming a pharaoh. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/nefertiti-was-no-pharaoh-says-renowned-egyptologist/|title=Nefertiti was no pharaoh, says renowned Egyptologist|website=www.manchester.ac.uk|access-date=2019-12-04}} < /ref >  Her parenthood is still a mystery. The only detail known is that they were nobles. 
 
 == Disappearance == 
 Two of her daughters became queens of Egypt. In the 12th year of Akheneaton rule many of the princesses died, but what was more confusing was that Nefertiti vanished. So everyone assumed that she died like the other princesses. There was no record of Nefertiti’s death and no evidence that she was ever buried. < ref name= " Nefertiti " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nefertiti|title=Nefertiti|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}} < /ref > 
 
 == Bust == 
 She is best known for her bust, which is in the Altes Museum in Berlin, Germany.  This bust is considered to be a beautiful example of Egyptian art. 
 
 A man called Ludwig Borchardt with a team of people discovered a portrait bust of Queen Nefertiti. This bust captured all her beauty even though one of the eyes was damaged. The famous bust that everyone began knowing Nefertiti was displayed at the museum of Berlin in the 1920’s. The queen's bust became very known around the world. This caused Nefertiti to become one of the most recognized and beautiful queens in ancient Egypt before Cleopatra. < ref name= " Nefertiti " / >
