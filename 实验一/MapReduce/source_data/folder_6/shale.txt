 '''Shale''' is a fine-grained [[sedimentary rock]] formed from [[mud]]. The mud is a mix of flakes of [[clay]] [[mineral]]s and tiny fragments ([[silt]]-sized particles) of other minerals, especially [[quartz]] and [[calcite]]. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable. < ref name=Blatt > Blatt, Harvey and Robert J. Tracy 1996. ''Petrology: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic''. 2nd ed, Freeman, 281 - 292 {{ISBN|0-7167-2438-3}} < /ref >  Shale has breaks along thin laminae (plates) or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called  " fissility "  (~splitting). < ref name=Blatt/ >  [[Mudstone]]s, on the other hand, are similar, though they do not show the tendency to split (fissility). 
 
 Shales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the [[organic matter]] in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales form in [[anoxic]] (without [[oxygen]]) conditions. They contain free [[carbon]] and iron sulfides such as [[pyrite]]. This produces the black colouration. < ref name= " Blatt " / > 
 
 == Formation of shale == 
 Shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and [[lagoon]]al deposits, in [[river delta]]s, on [[floodplain]]s and offshore from beach sands. They can also be deposited on the [[continental shelf]], in relatively deep, quiet water. This process could have taken millions of years to complete. 
 
 'Black shales' are dark, and are especially rich in  [[oxidation|unoxidized]] [[carbon]]. Black shales are deposited in [[anoxic]] or low [[oxygen]] environments, such as in stagnant water. They are common in some [[Palaeozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] [[stratum|strata]]. Some black shales have heavy metals such as [[molybdenum]], [[uranium]]. [[vanadium]], and [[zinc]]. < ref > R.
