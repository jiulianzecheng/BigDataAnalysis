 Chemists use strong acids to break down other molecules. Some molecules are so strong (held together with strong chemical bonds) that they resist attack by common acids. Superacids can break down molecules that stand up to most other acids. 
 
 Commercially available superacids include [[trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] (CF < sub > 3 < /sub > SO < sub > 3 < /sub > H), also known as triflic acid, and [[fluorosulfonic acid]] (FSO < sub > 3 < /sub > H). Both superacids are about a thousand times stronger (that is, have more negative ''H'' < sub > 0 < /sub >  values) than sulfuric acid. The strongest superacids are prepared by the combination of two components, a strong [[Lewis acid]] and a strong [[Brønsted acid]]. The strongest known superacid is [[fluoroantimonic acid]].
