 '''Negroid''' was a word for a person from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The group of these persons was called  " Negroid race " . In former times, many people divided [[human beings]] into three [[Historical definitions of race|races]]. These races were called ''Negroid'', ''[[Mongoloid]]'', and ''[[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]]''. Today, scientists agree that there is only one human race. Modern [[Genetics|genetic]] research has shown that the idea of three races was wrong. < ref > {{cite web|author=American Association of Physical Anthropologists|title=AAPA Statement on Race and Racism |website=American Association of Physical Anthropologists|access-date=19 June 2020 |date=27 March 2019 |url=https://physanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/}} < /ref > < ref name= " Templeton2016 " > Templeton, A.
