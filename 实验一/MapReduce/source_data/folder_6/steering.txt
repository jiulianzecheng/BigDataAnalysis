'''Steering''' is the collection of [[Work (physics)|mechanical]] parts which allow a [[watercraft|vessel]] ([[ship]], [[boat]]) or [[vehicle]] ([[truck]], [[automobile|car]], [[motorcycle]] or [[bicycle]]) to follow the desired course. [[Rail transport]] vehicles ([[train]]s and [[tram]]s or [[streetcar]]s) are steered by their [[rail tracks]]. 
 
 In vehicle steering, the person turning the steering wheel directly controls the rate of the turn. Response is immediate. [[Submarine]]s and ships operate in water, and use [[Rudder|control surfaces]] that work on the [[fluid]]. There is a [[:wikt:delay|delay]] between the steering controls and the time it takes for the system to respond. < ref > Robert W. Proctor; Trisha Van Zandt, ''Human Factors in Simple and Complex Systems'', Second Edition (Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2008), p. 406 < /ref > 
 
 Some land vehicles such as [[tank]] < nowiki/ > s, and some boats, can use differential steering, in which one side is pushed forward.
