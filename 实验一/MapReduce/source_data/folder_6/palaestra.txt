 A '''palaestra''' was a building in [[ancient Greece]]. It is the place where [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] was taught and practiced. It [[wikt:consist|consisted]] of a large square or [[rectangle|rectangular]] [[courtyard]]. This courtyard was open to the sky. It was [[wikt:surround|surrounded]] by [[wikt:colonnade|colonnade]]s. Off these colonnades were dressing rooms, lecture rooms, bath rooms, and rooms for [[wikt:store#Verb|storing]] [[wikt:equipment|equipment]]. Wrestlers practiced under the colonnades in all weathers.   
 
 Palaestras were often near [[Gymnasium_(ancient_Greece)|gymnasium]]s. They were sometimes a part of gymnasium [[wikt:complex#Noun|complex]]es. Most [[city|cities]] in the Greek world had a palaestra. Large cities may have had [[wikt:several|several]]. Some palaestras were privately owned. Most were [[wikt:build#Verb|built]] with [[tax|taxes]]. The palaestra was very much a part of the everyday lives of Greek men and boys. Some men felt as much [[wikt:affection|affection]] for the palaestra they grew up in as modern men feel for their ''[[alma mater]]''. Some men were [[burial|buried]] in their [[wikt:favorite|favorite]] palaestra. < ref name=harris149 > {{harvnb|Harris|1964|p=149}} < /ref >

 A palaestra was a building in ancient Greece where wrestling was taught and practiced. The word ''palaestra'' is based on the Greek word ''pale'', which means wrestling. < ref name=miller176/ >  From the sixth century BC through the end of the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial age]], palaestras were built throughout Greece. < ref name=harris102/ >  The earliest ones were privately owned, but by the fifth century BC public ones were being built. < ref name=poliakoff12 > {{harvnb|Poliakoff|1987|p=12}} < /ref >  Almost every Greek city had at least one palaestra and some large cities had several. < ref name=miller176 > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|p=176}} < /ref >              
 
 Palaestras were often located near or were attached to gymnasiums. The gymnasium probably first appeared in the sixth century BC. < ref name=poliakoff12/ >  Both were often referred to simply as  " the gymnasium " . < ref name=miller176/ >  Greek [[history|historian]], [[biography|biographer]], and [[essay|essayist]] [[Plutarch]] writes that a palaestra was used solely for wrestling and the ''[[pankration]]'', a sport similar to but much rougher than wrestling. [[Boxing]] was taught and practiced in the gymnasium. < ref name=harris102 > {{harvnb|Harris|1964|p=102}} < /ref >  Retired [[athletics (sport)|athletes]] owned and operated small palaestras. Greek [[male]]s of all ages joined palaestras. Elderly (old) men sometimes had their own palaestras. < ref > {{harvnb|Harris|1964|p=146}} < /ref > 
 
 == Design of the palaestra == 
 [[File:0007MAN-Herma.jpg|thumb|A Herm presided over the palaestra. Rubbing its [[phallus]] would bring good luck. ([[Marble]]; ca. 520 BC; 66 cm (25 ¾ in.); National Archaeological Museum, Athens)]] 
 
 Vitruvius was a Roman [[architect]] who lived in the age of [[Augustus]]. He made a plan for the perfect palaestra in his book ''On Architecture''. This palaestra is similar to the one at [[Palaestra at Olympia|Olympia, Greece]], the site of the [[ancient Olympic Games]]. Vitruvius' palaestra has a large courtyard open to the sky. This courtyard is surrounded by roofed [[wikt:colonnade|colonnades]]. < ref name=miller176/ > 
 
 The yard would have been filled with ''skammata''{{mdash}}pits where wrestlers and pankratiasts would have practiced. A ''skamma'' ( " dug-up part " ) was an area where the soil had been turned over and covered with a thick layer of sand to provide a firm foundation for the wrestlers. Because wrestlers may have had to compete in rainy weather, there were two ''skamma'' in the palaestra: a dry one and a wet one. Wrestlers called the mud in the wet ''skamma''  " [[beeswax]] " . < ref > {{harvnb|Harris|1964|p=104}} < /ref >   
 
 The wrestlers themselves turned over the soil and sand with a pick axe. This was considered a meaningful exercise and the pick axe became a symbol for wrestling in Greek art. It is likely the wet ''skamma'' was located under the colonnades to prevent evaporation. Greek [[physician]]s thought a mixture of mud and oil had curative powers and a mixture of mud and oil was often used in the pits. < ref name=poliakoff12/ > 
 
 Vitruvius describes single colonnades on three sides of the yard and a double colonnade on the north side. This double colonnade would protect the room behind it from sun and rain. The palaestra was a place for training the body and the mind. This room was the ''ephebeion''. It was here that young men (''ephebes'') would receive instruction on Greek culture. Stone benches would have been set into the walls. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|pp=176{{ndash}}79}} < /ref >   
 
 To the right of the ''ephebeion'' Vitruvius would have had three rooms: the punching bag room, the dust and powder room, and a room for bathing. To the left of the ''ephebeion'' would be a room for storing oil, and a group of rooms for a [[furnace]] and hot baths. Hot baths were a Roman necessity and were not found at Olympia however. This may have been because of the scarcity of water at Olympia. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|pp=177{{ndash}}78}} < /ref >  The baths at Olympia were simple but those at [[Delphi, Greece|Delphi]] were large and elaborate. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|p=179}} < /ref > 
 
 Vitruvius does not mention the undressing room (''apodyterion'') but there certainly would have been at least one in every palaestra. ''Pale'' and ''pankration'' were both practiced in the nude. Vitruvius does not mention a ball room (''sphairisterion'') either, which some palaestra had. It is not known if this room was used for ball games, storage, or exercise. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|p=178}} < /ref > 
 
 On rainy days, wrestling was taught and practiced beneath the two to four roofed [[wikt:colonnade|colonnade]]s that lined the yard. Just off these colonnades were dressing rooms, rooms for bathing, storage rooms, and rooms for [[lecture]]s and meeting friends. These rooms were often used for [[homosexual]] or [[wikt:pederastic|pederastic]] [[wikt:tryst|tryst]]s.  
 
 Hermes Enagonios ( " Hermes of the Contest " ) presided over the palaestra. He was depicted on a rectangular piece of marble as a head and an erect penis. Hermes was the god of wrestling and sometimes said to be the father of Palaestra, the goddess of wrestling. In Greek art, a herm often indicates the scene is a palaestra. [[Statue]]s of [[Apollo]] and [[Herakles]] also stood in a palaestra. < ref > {{harvnb|Poliakoff|1987|p=13}} < /ref > 
 
 == Life in the palaestra == 
 [[File:Palaestra scene Louvre G7.jpg|thumb|left|Wrestler and trainer (or judge) in the palaestra]] 
 
 Wrestling was a highly [[wikt:esteem#Verb|esteemed]] sport in ancient Greece. It was less rough than boxing or the pankration, required less space than other sports, and, as a result, was the most popular sport among athletes. References to the sport are frequent in the [[literature]] of ancient Greece, especially [[poetry]]. < ref name=harris102/ > 
 
 Males of all ages joined palaestras, just as modern men and boys join the [[YMCA]], gyms, or health clubs. < ref name=harris102/ >  Greek men developed an [[wikt:affection|affection]] for the gymnasiums and the palaestras where they grew up, and some were buried in their favorite gymnasium or palaestra. These buildings could be a center for [[politic]]s: the [[plot]] to free [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] from [[Sparta]] was formed in a palaestra and a [[wikt:revolt|revolt]] against [[Macedon]] found its supporters in the gymnasiums and palaestras of [[Argos]]. < ref name=harris149/ >   
 
 Some people were not [[wikt:allow|allow]]ed in the palaestra. These included the ''paidogogos''{{mdash}}older [[slave]]s or [[grandfather]]s who led young boys to the palaestra and waited for them near the front door. Others not allowed in the palaestra included girls and women, [[wikt:cripple|cripple]]s, [[alcoholic]]s, [[craft]]smen, vendors (salesmen), slaves or freed slaves, the [[insane]], and openly [[wikt:lewd|lewd]] [[homosexual]]s. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|p=189}} < /ref >  Death was not unknown in the palaestra. One wrestler fell on a hard surface and died ten days later from chest injuries. < ref name=poliakoff12/ > 
 
 Every palaestra had a number of handsome young men called ''prosgymnastes''. They waited around offering to wrestle others for a [[fee]]. These young men were known casually as  " [[statue]]s " . Wrestling one was known as  " [[hug|hugging]] a statue " . These young men were not held in high esteem. < ref > {{harvnb|Harris|1964|p=177}} < /ref > 
 
 In a place where men, young men, and boys were [[nude]], homosexual [[wikt:interaction|interaction]] was [[wikt:common|common]]. The authorities tried unsuccessfully to [[wikt:curb|curb]] it. Greek vase paintings of males in the palaestra show teens [[goose (prank)|goosing]] each other or older males offering love [[gift]]s such as [[hare]]s to teens. In ''Lysis'', the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Socrates|Sokrates]] is pulled into a palaestra by a group of teenagers. They tell him that one of their number is in love with another. Most Greek males [[wikt:consider|consider]]ed a homosexual relationship a [[wikt:positive|positive]] palaestra experience. Archaeologist Stephen Miller writes that [[Eros]] was [[worship]]ped as much as [[Hermes]] and [[Herakles]] in the palaestra. < ref > {{harvnb|Miller|2004|pp=189{{ndash}}93}} < /ref >
