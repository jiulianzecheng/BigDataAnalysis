The '''Chippendales''' are a male [[United States|American]] [[striptease]] group. They use a distinctive costume, a [[bow tie]], collars and cuffs are worn over the bare upper body. 
 
 Formed in 1979, the Chippendales were the first all-male striptease group to perform to a predominantly female audience. 
 
 The group performs Broadway-style [[burlesque]] shows around the world. In addition, it licenses its [[intellectual property]] to select consumer products, from apparel and accessories to slot machines and video games. The Chippendales perform in a theater and lounge specially built for them at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in [[Las Vegas]]. The group tours around the world. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Chinitz|first=Daniel|date=2017-02-08|title=Chippendales is ‘living the dancer’s dream,’ says Chippendales dancer|url=https://badgerherald.com/banter/2017/02/08/chippendales-is-living-the-dancers-dream-says-chippendales-dancer|access-date=2022-12-20|website=The Badger Herald}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=1993-12-13|title=Cyanide in the beefcake: Somen Banerjee, inventor of the Chippendales,|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cyanide-in-the-beefcake-somen-banerjee-inventor-of-the-chippendales-stands-accused-of-much-more-than-driving-women-crazy-did-he-not-hatch-a-plot-to-leave-blackpool-strewn-with-dead-adonises-phil-reeves-reports-1467195.html|access-date=2022-12-20|website=The Independent|language=en}} < /ref >
