 '''Coca''' is a plant in the family [[Erythroxylaceae]], native to north-western [[South America]]. The plant plays a significant role in traditional Andean culture. Coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids, a basis for the drug [[cocaine]], which is a powerful [[stimulant]]. Today the plant has many uses, including traditional use by Andean cultures to flavoring [[Coca-Cola]] products to use as an [[anesthetic]]. < ref name= " Cola " > {{cite news|last=May|first=Clifford D|title=How Coca-Cola Obtains Its Coca|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/01/business/how-coca-cola-obtains-its-coca.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-07-01}} < /ref > < ref name= " Anesthetic " > {{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Stephen|last2=Hoffman|first2=Robert|title=Use of tetracaine, epinephrine, and cocaine as a topical anesthetic in the emergency department|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=August 1992|volume=21|issue=8|pages=987–997|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82942-7|pmid=1497171|url=http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(05)82942-7/abstract|accessdate=August 22, 2014}} < /ref >

After its stimulating effects were described by a European doctor in the 19th century, people began to refine the leaves to get [[cocaine]]. As people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries. In 1961 the [[United Nations]] classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive. < ref name= " Enquiry " > {{cite journal|title=Report of the Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf|journal=United Nations Economic and Social Council|date=May 1950|page=31|url=http://www.ungassondrugs.org/images/stories/cocainquiry-e.pdf|accessdate=August 4, 2014}} < /ref >  This has led the [[United States]] to pressure coca-growing countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] to stop growing coca entirely. < ref name= " Cola "  / >  These countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision, trying to remove the coca plant from the list.
