 A '''plaintiff''' is a person who starts a [[lawsuit]] in court. < ref > {{cite web |title=Legal Dictionary |url=https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1536 |website=Law.com |accessdate=6 February 2021}} < /ref >   Sometimes a plaintiff will have to fill out a form called a [[summons]], [[claim form]], or [[complaint]].  This [[document]] tells what the person they are suing (the [[defendant]]) did.  If the case is a [[criminal]] case and not a lawsuit, the plaintiff can be called a '''complainant'''.
