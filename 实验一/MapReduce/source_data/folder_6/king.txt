 A '''king''' is a male [[monarch]] who rules a [[country]] or [[territory]] which is a [[monarchy]]. The person usually [[inheritance|inherits]] the title and position. A king comes to power when the previous [[monarch]] dies, who is usually a family member of his, most likely a parent. Sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarch's [[abdication]], for example [[George VI]] (who became [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of Britain]] after his brother decided to abdicate).   
 
 If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a [[monarchy]]. A country which a king or queen rules is called a [[kingdom]].  
 
 For most of history, most countries were ruled in this way, especially in [[Europe]]. However, most countries, such as [[France]], decided to become [[Republic|republics]]. Some, such as the [[United Kingdom]], still have a [[royal family]]. In some countries, people chose a new king from other people to decide from.  
 
 The wife of a king is called a [[queen]]. A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen. 
 
 In the [[Muslim world]] a King would be known as Malik, [[Sultan]] or shah.
