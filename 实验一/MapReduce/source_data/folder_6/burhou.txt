 '''Burhou''' (pronounced bu-ROO) is a small [[island]] approximately {{convert|1.4|mi|km|2}}  northwest of [[Alderney]] that is part of the [[Channel Islands]]. No one lives on Burhou, and it is a [[Nature reserve|bird sanctuary]], so landing there is banned from 15 March to 27 July. The island's [[wildlife]] includes a colony of [[puffin]]s (declining in numbers) and large numbers of [[rabbit]]s. 
 
 It has no landing stage as such, but visitors use a small inlet. In rough weather it may be impossible to land. 
 
 The [[Guernsey]] botanist E.D. Marquand called it,  " the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our [[archipelago]]. "  He had to spend the night there, as his return journey was delayed by fog. 
 
 The 1906 book, ''The Channel Pilot'' states - 
 
 : " Between [[Ortac]], Verte Tête and Burhou Island, are scattered many dangerous rocks, and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity. " 
 
 The [[States of Alderney]] member, [[John Beaman]] has political responsibility for the island. 
 
 Burhou, like many other Channel Islands (e.g. [[Lihou]], [[Jethou]]), has the [[Norman language|Norman]] suffix ''[[-hou]]'', meaning a small island, from the [[Old Norse]] ''holmr''. According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith,  " bur "  refers to a storehouse -  " Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear " . 
 
 Signs of human occupation/visitation are much older. [[Flint]] flakes have been found on the island, and one is currently in the Alderney Museum. In 1847, F.C. Lukis found two [[standing stones]], but these have since been lost, according to the archaeologist David Johnston. 
 
 ==The hut== 
 According to the Assize Roll of the 14th century, Burhou was a rabbit warren, and a refuge for fishermen. This would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there, as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it. 
 
 A hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of General Le Mesurier (The Governor), but was destroyed during the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German occupation of the Channel Islands]] (the [[Nazis]] used it for target practice during [[World War II|WWII]]). The hut was replaced in 1953, with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office. 
 
 Attempts have been made to raise sheep there. In 1900, a French couple lived there for a year. The soil is thin, and spray often goes right over the island, so the soil is very salty. The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year, and has to rely on shipments, or formerly tanks. 
 
 ==Flora and fauna== 
 The island's animals are mainly birds, although rabbits are long established here. The island has many puffins and some [[storm petrel]]s. Although the latter have declined, they used to nest in the cottage's storm loft. Roderick Dobson in ''Birds of the Channel Islands''  < ref > {{cite book |title=Birds of the Channel Islands |last=Dobson |first= Roderick|year=1952 }} < /ref >  said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century. The ''Birds of Guernsey'' (1878) < ref > {{cite book |title=Birds of Guernsey |last=Smith |first=Cecil |year=1878 }} < /ref >  by Cecil Smith states likewise. The puffins have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from [[red mite]] infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them. 
 
 Amongst the plants noted here are [[Spergula|sea spurry]], [[forget-me-not]]s, [[scarlet pimpernel]], [[field bugloss]], [[bracken]] and [[Dead Nettle|nettle]]s. E.D. Marquand counted 18 species of plant here in 1909, but by the late twentieth century Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45, which they wrote up in the ''Transactions of La Société Guernesiaise''
