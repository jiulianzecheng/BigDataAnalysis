 '''Osteichthyes''' are a taxonomic [[Superclass (biology)|superclass]] of [[fish]], also called ''bony fish'', that includes the ray-finned fish ([[Actinopterygii]]) and lobe finned fish ([[Sarcopterygii]]). The split between these two classes occurred around 440 million years ago.  The Osteichthyes are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with land [[vertebrate]]s. This is why some classification schemes put the [[tetrapod]]s into the Osteichthyes.  Osteichthyes are the most various group of vertebrates, consisting of over 29,000 species, making them the largest superclass of vertebrates in existence today.
