 == History == 
 
 The concept of netbook is originated from [[subnotebooks]]. The word Netbook was introduced by [[Psion]] in 1999 < ref > http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=16302 < /ref >  and introduced again by Intel in 2008. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2008/03/thoughts_on_netbooks.php |title=Thoughts on Netbooks |accessdate=2008-10-23 |author=Paul Bergevin |date=2008-03-03 |work=Technology@Intel blog}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/notebooks/news/2008/04/04/Intel-Sets-Out-Netbook-and-Nettop-Plans/p1 |title=Intel Sets Out Netbook and Nettop Plans |accessdate=2008-10-23 |author=Edward Chester |work=Trusted Reviews}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2007, Asus present the [[ASUS Eee PC]] range running a [[Linux]] on a 7 inch color screen. Soon after their appearance, netbooks grew in size and features, and converged with smaller laptops and subnotebooks. The Eee PC has been a top seller on [[Amazon.com]] < ref > {{cite web|url=http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com/2007/11/asus-eee-pc-amazon-bestseller.html|title=Asus Eee News, Mods, and Hacks: Asus Eee PC Amazon Bestseller < !-- Bot generated title -- > |publisher=}} < /ref >  and is often sold out in stores. The Eee's success is attributed to the relatively low-price (around $350/£230/€300) compared with standard-sized laptops. (above $1000 at that time) 
 
 In middle of February 2008, [[Everex]] released its VIA [[chipset]] based on [[CloudBook]], running [[gOS]]. Unlike its rival, the Eee PC, the CloudBook uses a hard-disk. 
 
 In June 2008, [[MSI]] launched the MSI Wind PC, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://netbook-review.com/lightweight-packs-punch-msi-wind-u100-netbook|title=MSI Netbook|access-date=2009-05-09|archive-date=2009-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330074125/http://netbook-review.com/lightweight-packs-punch-msi-wind-u100-netbook|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  with features such as [[Bluetooth]] and a 10 "  [[LED]], [[backlit]], 1024x600 screen.
