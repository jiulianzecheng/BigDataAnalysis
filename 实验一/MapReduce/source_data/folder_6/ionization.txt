'''Ionization''' is the [[physics|physical]] process of giving or taking away [[electron]]s from an [[atom]]. That makes the atom into an [[ion]], because ions have [[Electric charge|electrical charge]].  
 
 In the process of ionization, an [[electric charge|electrically neutral]] atom becomes either positively or negatively charged. Some [[substance|substances]] are easier to ionize than others. This depends on the [[ionization energy]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionization|title=Ionization {{!}} chemistry and physics|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-07-15}} < /ref >  [[Ionizing radiation]] is a common cause, but ionization can also be done by high temperature, radioactive decay, or other causes.
