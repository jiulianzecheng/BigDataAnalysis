'''Syncopation''' is music which creates rhythmical variation. Examples would be: 
 *A stress (accent) on a beat not usually stressed. 
 *A rest where there would normally be a beat. 
 *Use of split-beats. 
 *Minute delays or advances in the timing of beats. 
 
 " If a part of the [[Bar (music)|measure]] (bar) that is usually unstressed is accented, the rhythm is considered to be syncopated " . < ref > Benward  &  Saker 2003. ''Music: in theory and practice'', vol 1, p12. 7th ed. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}. < /ref > 
 
 More simply, syncopation is a general term for a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm; a placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn't normally occur. < ref name=kenn >
