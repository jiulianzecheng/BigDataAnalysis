'''Erythropoietin''', or '''Erythropoetin''' ('''EPO''') is a [[hormone]] produced by the [[kidney]]s. '''Epoetin''' is a [[synthetic]] version. 
 
 Erythropoietin acts on the bone marrow so that it makes more [[Blood|red blood cells]]. It is used to treat some kinds of [[anemia]]. Anemia can happen in kidney failure, or from [[chemotherapy]] to treat [[cancer]]. The man-made [[hormone]] is made with [[cell culture]]s. The hormone can be used for [[blood doping]] in endurance [[sport]]s although this is illegal in all athletic competitions. 
 
 It is also responsible for inhibiting the body process  " Gluconeogenesis "  (a process in your body which makes [[glucose]] from products other than [[carbohydrate]]s), thus contributing to cure of type2 diabetes, glucose intolerance.
