 The focus of attention on ''Hinamatsuri'' is a display of dolls which are dressed in the fashion of the [[Heian period]].  The group of dolls represent the Imperial court (''hina ningyō''). < ref name= " nussbaum313 " / > 
 
 The Japanese term for the display steps is {{nihongo|''hina dan''|雛壇}}. < ref name= " nussbaum313 " / >   There may be five or seven steps. 
 
 The [[Kantō region]] and [[Kansai region]] have different placement orders of the dolls from left to right, but the order of dolls per level are the same.
