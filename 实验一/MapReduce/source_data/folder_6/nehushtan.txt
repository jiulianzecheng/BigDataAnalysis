 The '''Nehushtan''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Script/Hebrew|נחשתן}} ''Nəḥuštān''  < span class= " IPA "  title= " Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) " > [nə.ħuʃ.taːn] < /span > ) is the bronze serpent on a pole first described in the [[Book of Numbers]]. God told Moses to make it. This was to cure the [[Israelites]]. Those who saw the nehushtan would be cured from the deathly bites of the  " [[Fiery flying serpent|fiery serpents]] " . God initially sent the fiery serpents to punish them for speaking against Him and Moses ({{Bibleverse|Numbers|21:4-9|KJV}}).  
 
 In the biblical [[Books of Kings]] ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|18:4|HE}}; written c. 550 BCE), King [[Hezekiah]] leads an [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] reform. This requires the destruction of  " the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan " . The term means  " a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass " . < ref name= " Easton " > [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/nehushtan/ M.G.
