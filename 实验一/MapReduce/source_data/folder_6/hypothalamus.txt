 The '''hypothalamus''' is a brain part at the base of the [[brain]]. It connects the [[endocrine system]] to the [[nervous system]]. The word ''hypothalamus'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word which means  " under the thalamus " ; it is used because hypothalamus is below the [[thalamus]], and above the [[brain stem]]. 
 
 The hypothalamus controls [[body temperature]], [[hunger]], [[thirst]] and [[circadian rhythm|circadian cycles]]. 
 It is the control system which regulates the [[pituitary gland]], the 'master gland' of the body. It is also involved in regulating sex drive. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-J6kDAAAQBAJ|title=Gay, Straight, and the Reason why: The Science of Sexual Orientation|last=LeVay|first=Simon|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-029737-4|pages=ix|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The thalamus sits above the hypothalamus, and the hypothalamus sits above the pituitary gland. That area at the base of the [[brain]] down to the pituitary is the centre of [[neurosecretion]]. Some neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus produce hormones such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]]. These hormones are released into the blood in the [[posterior pituitary]]. < ref name=williams > Melmed S. ''et al'' 2011.
