 The '''border''' between two [[region]]s is a line, where one region is next to the other. If the regions are [[country|countries]], the border can only be crossed at certain points. To cross the border, a [[passport]] or a [[visa]] might be necessary; such as the [[Wagah]] border between [[Pakistan]] and the [[Republic of India]].
