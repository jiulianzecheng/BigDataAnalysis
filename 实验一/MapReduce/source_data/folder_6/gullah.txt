The '''Gullah''' (also called '''Geechee''') are the descendants of African slaves who lived in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]. They lived on the mainland and on the [[Sea Islands]]. 
 
 The Gullah region used to include what is now [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]], but today the Gullah area is only in Georgia and South Carolina. 
 
 The Gullah were able to keep parts of their African [[culture]], but were also influenced by North American culture. The Gullah people speak a [[creole language]] that is based on [[English language|English]], but has many African [[loanwords]].

 ===Origin of Gullah culture=== 
 [[File:Sweetgrass Basket Maker.jpg|thumb|A gullah woman makes a sweetgrass basket in Charleston's City Market]] 
 Along the western coast of Africa, the people had cultivated [[African rice]] for 3,000 years. When British colonial planters discovered that rice would grow in the American South, they wanted enslaved Africans from this region. < ref name= " africanaheritage.com " > [http://www.africanaheritage.com/Sierra_Leone_and_America.asp/ Joseph A. Opala,  " The Gullah: Rice, Slavery and the Sierra Leone/American Connection, "   University of South Florida] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214044447/http://www.africanaheritage.com/sierra_leone_and_america.asp |date=2016-02-14 }}, Africana Heritage < /ref >  Africans were taken as slaves from the Western region of Africa (in what is today [[Sierra Leone]]), transported to the [[Americas]], and were traded in Charlestowne, South Carolina. These African farmers brought their skills for [[farming]] and [[irrigation]]. 
 
 According to British historian P.E.H. Hair, Gullah culture had elements of many different African cultures. The Gullah people were able to keep much of their African culture because the climate and geography of this area were similar to Africa, and because slaves lived in large groups and had little interaction with whites. 
 
 The slaves also brought the diseases [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm/|author=West, Jean M.|title=Rice and Slavery: A Fatal Gold Seede|website=Slavery in America|access-date=2016-05-16|archive-date=2012-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206050437/http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  These diseases spread to English and European settlers because of the [[subtropical climate]], and became endemic in the region. Africans had more [[immunity]] to these diseases. Many white planters left the area during seasons when the diseases were more common. < ref name= " africanaheritage.com " / >  The European or African  " rice drivers " , or overseers, were left in charge of the plantations. < ref name= " africanaheritage.com " / > 
 
 ===Civil War period=== 
 In the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], white planters on the Sea Islands were afraid of an invasion by US naval forces. They left their plantations and went to the mainland. When Union forces arrived on the Sea Islands in 1861, the Gullah people wanted freedom. Many Gullahs served in the [[Union Army]]. The Sea Islands were the first place in the South where slaves were freed. Long before the end of the War, [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian]] missionaries came to start schools for the newly freed slaves. 
 
 After the Civil War ended, the Gullah became more isolated from the outside world. This happened because the rice planters on the mainland left their farms and moved away from the area. The Gullahs continued to practice their traditional culture with little influence from the outside world until the 20th century. 
 
 ===Recent history=== 
 In 2006, the U.S. Congress passed the  " [[Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor|Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Act]] " . This act will provide $10 million over 10 years to preserve Gullah historic sites. < ref > [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6283153/ Bill Will Provide Millions for Gullah Community.] National Public Radio. October 17, 2006. < /ref >  The [[National Heritage Area|Heritage Corridor]] will extend from southern North Carolina to northern Florida. 
 
 ===Cultural survival=== 
 The Gullah people still have their traditional culture. Their traditions have survived in the Lowcountry mainland and on the Sea Islands, and also in urban areas such as Charleston and [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Gullah people who have moved far away have also preserved their traditions. In the summer, they usually send their children back to rural communities in South Carolina and Georgia, where they live with grandparents, uncles, and aunts.
