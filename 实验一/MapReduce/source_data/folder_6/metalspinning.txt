 '''Metal spinning''' is a [[process]] where a piece of [[Metal|sheet metal]] is [[rotation|rotated]] on a [[machine]] (often a [[lathe]]) to produce an object. < ref name=Theis407 > Henry Ericsson Theis, ''Handbook of Metalforming Processes'' (New York; Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1999), p. 407 < /ref >  The  object usually has the qualities of being round, hollow and [[symmetrical]]. < ref name=Theis407/ >  Metal spinning dates back [[thousand]]s of years to [[Ancient Egypt]]. < ref name=Theis407/ >  It is closely related to the [[potter's wheel]]. 
 
 == Process == 
 The process begins with a flat piece of metal or a metal [[cylinder]]. < ref name=macurVULC > {{cite web |url=http://vulcangms.com/2014/03/25/metal-spinning-work/ |title=How does metal spinning work? |author=Matt Macur |date=25 March 2014 |publisher=Vulcan GMS U.S. |access-date=22 May 2016 |archive-date=15 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415041156/http://vulcangms.com/2014/03/25/metal-spinning-work/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  It is cut to a specific size based on the size of the finished part.
