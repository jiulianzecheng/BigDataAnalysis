 The '''kingbird''' (''Tyrannus melancholicus'') is a large [[tyrant flycatcher]]. This bird breeds from southern [[Arizona]] in the United States to as far as south as central [[Argentina]], western [[Peru]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Birds from the northernmost and southern breeding areas [[migrate]] to warmer parts of the range after breeding. 
 
 ==Description and ecology== 
 An adult tropical kingbird is {{convert|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weighs {{convert|39|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Both male and female are similar, but young birds have pale buff edges on the wing coverts. 
 
 The call is a high-pitched twittering trill, ''tree-e-e-e-e-e-e'', with a more complex version sung by the male at dawn. 
 
 Their breeding habitat is semi-open areas with trees and shrubs, including gardens and roadsides. Tropical kingbirds like to view their surroundings from an open perch, usually high in a tree. They take long flights to catch [[insect]]s in mid-air, which is called [[Hawking (birds)|hawking]]. They sometimes hover to pick food off of plants, which is called [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]]. < ref > de A. Gabriel, Vagner  &  Pizo, Marco A.

 These birds defend their territory against intruders, even much larger birds such as [[toucan]]s, [[Caracara (subfamily)|caracara]]s or [[hawk]]s.  
 
 They make a flimsy cup nest in a tree. The eggs are cream-colored with reddish-brown marks. The female [[incubation|incubates]] the typical clutch of two or three eggs for 16 days. After they hatch, it is about 18–19 more days until [[Fledge|fledging]]. 
 
 The tropical kingbird is not a threatened species of the [[IUCN]]. < ref name=IUCN/ >  This is because this bird is very common and they adapt well to changes in their environment.
