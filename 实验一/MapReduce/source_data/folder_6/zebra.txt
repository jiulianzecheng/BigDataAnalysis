 '''Zebras''' are [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Equidae]]''. Zebras are African [[horse]]s. They are in the same [[genus]] as the common horse, ''[[Equus caballus]]'', and [[donkey]]s. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main [[species]] of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra.

 ==Appearance== 
 All zebras have very short [[fur]] because they live in hot areas. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main part of the body has mostly [[vertical]] stripes, and the legs have [[horizontal]] stripes. They also have a dark line directly down their spine. Each of the different zebra species has different types of stripes. Each zebra has a unique pattern. < ref > McClintock, Dorcas 1976. ''A natural history of Zebras''. New York: Scribner's.

 Despite many attempts, we do not really know what the advantage is of having those characteristic stripes. There are different [[species]] and [[sub-species]] of zebra, and they all have stripes, so scientists think it must be important. < ref > Larison, Brenda; Harrigan, Ryan J.; Thomassen, Henri A.; Rubenstein, Daniel I.; Chan-Golston, Alec M.; Li, Elizabeth; Smith, Thomas B.  2015.

 ==Life== 
 Zebras are social animals that spend time in herds, they graze together and sometimes even groom each other. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/zebra/|title=National Geographic|first=|last=|website=National Geographic|date=10 September 2010 |publisher=|accessdate=}} < /ref >  They can have babies (foals) when they are about five years old and can have one every year. Zebras mainly eat grass. They always live near water and are an endangered species.  
 
 Zebras live in [[Africa]], south of the [[Sahara]] desert.
