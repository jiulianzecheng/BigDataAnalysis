 '''Faboideae''' is a [[subfamily]] of the [[flowering plant]] family [[Fabaceae]] or Leguminosae. An acceptable alternative name for the subfamily is Papilionoideae, or Papilionaceae when this group of plants is treated as a [[Family (biology)|family]]. 
 [[File:Amorpha fruticosa-flowers.jpg|thumb|In most [[Amorpheae]],the flowers are not papilionaceous, as shown here in this [[Amorpha fruticosa]].]] 
 This subfamily is widely distributed and members are adapted to a wide variety of environments. Faboideae may be [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s or herbs. The [[flower]]s are usually [[Papilionaceous flower|papilionaceous]] and [[Root nodules|root nodulation]] is very common. [[Vicia|Vetch]], [[Laburnum]], and [[Sweet pea]] are all members of Faboideae.
