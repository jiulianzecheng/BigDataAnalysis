{{Year in various calendars|year={{CURRENTYEAR}}}} 
 A '''calendar''' is a tool for organizing days. People use calendars to say when something happened, and for planning things that have not happened yet. The calendar gives the [[day]]s names and numbers, called [[calendar date]]s. The ''dates'' are usually made based on how things in the [[sky]] seem to move. The [[year]] and [[month]] are based on motions of the [[Sun]] and [[moon]]. By knowing what day something happened or will happen, people have an easier life. Since the beginning of history, knowing when the seasons would start for crops was very important for [[farmer]] < nowiki/ > s. 
 
 Calendar systems have a beginning time or [[era]]. The [[calendar era]] is often a [[religion]]-based event, such as the birth of [[Jesus]], but it may be a political event such as a [[coronation]] or the founding of a [[state]]. Dates that are counted from the coronation are called  " regnal " . 
 
 The three principal calendars most used today are the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]], [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], and [[Islamic calendar|Islamic]] calendars. Other calendar systems from many different parts of the world are also used. 
 
 == Basis == 
 Calendars are [[wikt:Based|based]] on three natural things: 
 
 # The Earth turns all the way around its axis. 
 # The Moon goes all the way around the Earth. 
 # The Earth goes all the way around the Sun. 
 
 The Earth turns all the way around its axis about 24 hours. It is called the '''[[Solar time|Solar Day]]'''.  [[Day]] < nowiki/ > s of most calendars are strongly based on the Solar Day. 
 
 The Moon turns all the way around the Earth about 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2 seconds.  [[Month]] < nowiki/ > s of some calendars are still strongly based on the Moon.  These are called '''[[Lunar calendar]] < nowiki/ > s''', which lasts about 354-355 days.  [[Solar calendar]] < nowiki/ > s ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the [[Sun]]. 
 
 The Earth goes all the way around the Sun in about 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds.  This is called the '''[[Solar year]]'''.  [[Year]] < nowiki/ > s of most calendars are strongly based on the Solar year.
