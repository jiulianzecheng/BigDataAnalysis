 The '''Stonefly''' or '''Plecoptera''' are an order of [[aquatic]] [[insect]]s. There are some 3,500 described species worldwide, and new ones are still being discovered. Although stoneflies are found [[worldwide]], they are absent from [[Antarctica]]. Stoneflies are believed to be one of the most [[primitive]] groups of [[Neoptera]]. Their close [[:wikt:relative|relatives]] are identified from the [[Carboniferous]] and Lower [[Permian]] [[Period (geology)|geological periods]]. True stoneflies, known from [[fossil]]s, are only a little younger. The [[larva]] have [[claw]]s on their [[legs]]. < ref name=Randall37 > Jason Randall, ''Feeding Time: A Fly Fisher's Guide to What, Where  &  When Trout Eat'' (Mechanicsburg, PA: Headwater Books/Stackpole Books, 2013), p. 37 < /ref >  This allows them to better hang on to things in their [[environment]] and withstand stronger [[Current (fluid)|current]]. < ref name=Randall37/ >  They need fast moving water in [[stream]]s and [[river]]s to survive. They cannot tolerate the low [[oxygen saturation]] found in warm water. They usually live in cold clean streams with a lot of [[turbulence]] (such as [[rapids]]). < ref name=Randall37/ >  The adult stoneflies are easily identified by their [[wings]] that fold over their [[abdomen]]. < ref name=Randall37/ >  The ''pteronarcys'' Stoneflies, found only in [[North America]]n waters, live for several years. < ref > Ernest G. Schwiebert, ''Nymphs; Volume II: Stoneflies, Caddisflies, and Other Important Insects Including the Lesser Mayflies'' (Guilford, CT: Lyons Press, 2007), pp. 7â€“8 < /ref >
