 '''Emmental''' is a part of Switzerland. It is made of low [[hill]]s. Most of it is in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]] of  [[Bern (canton)|Berne]].   Its biggest rivers are the [[Emme]] and the [[Ilfis]]. The biggest [[wikt:locality|localities]] are [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]], [[Langnau im Emmental|Langnau]] and [[Huttwil]].  
 
 The landscape is mostly made of [[meadow]]s. There are some [[forest]]s too. Most of the people live from raising [[cattle]] (mostly [[cow]]s), or from things closely related to cattle-raising. [[Emmental cheese]] has its name from this region. Langnau is known for [[Ceramics]]. [[Pottery]] from the region is also well-known. 
 
 There is also some industry. The Emmental had one of the first fully-electric [[railway]] lines in Switzerland. 
 
 [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] was a  famous writer who spent most of his life in the Emmental.
