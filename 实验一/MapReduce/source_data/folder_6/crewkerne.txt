'''Crewkerne''' is a [[town]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]] where about 6,700 people live. It is in the [[South Somerset]] [[District]].  
 
 The first time it is mentioned in [[history]] is [[899]], when king [[Alfred the Great]] left the [[manor]] to his son [[Ethelweard]]. The name ''Crewkerne'' comes from the [[Saxon]] words ''Cruce'' ([[cross]]) and ''earne'' ([[cottage]]), because of the early [[Church (building)|church]] there. There was also a [[Mint (money)|mint]] where [[coin]]s were made between [[978]] and [[1035]]. In [[1066]], the manor belonged to Edith, mistress of [[Harold Godwinson]]. After the [[Norman Conquest]], it belonged directly to [[William the Conqueror]].
