 == History == 
 The concept of zugzwang was known in the old forms of chess, like [[shatranj]]. We know this because there are some [[Arabic chess]] problems which use the idea. 
 
 The term itself comes from the 19th century in a German chess magazine. Its first use in English was in the early 20th century. < ref > [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/zugzwang.html Winter, Edward 1997. ''Zugzwang''.  www.chesshistory.com] < /ref >
