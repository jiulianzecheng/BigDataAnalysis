 '''Magadha''' was a [[kingdom]] located in southern northeastern [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. It went through different dynasties like the Brihadratha, Haryanka, Shaishunaga, Nanda, [[Maurya Dynasty|Mauryan]], Shunga, and Kanva dynasties. Over time, Magadha lost some of its lands to the Satavahanas in 28 BC and became a smaller [[principality]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Magadha {{!}} Mauryan Empire, Ganges Valley, Buddhism {{!}} Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Magadha|access-date=2023-11-29|website=www.britannica.com|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 During the time of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], Magadha became a large empire, covering a big part of north [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. Magadha was central to the Nanda Empire, [[Maurya Empire]], Shunga Empire, and [[Gupta Empire]]. The Pala Empire also ruled over Magadha and had a royal camp in Pataliputra. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7RKoMeAtpUC|title=The History and Culture of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar, Cir. 750 A.D.-cir. 1200 A.D.|last=Bagchi|first=Jhunu|date=1993|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-301-4|language=en}} < /ref >  Even after the major empires, the Pithipatis of [[Bodh Gaya]] continued to call themselves Magadhādipati and ruled parts of Magadha until the 13th century. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lk0NzgEACAAJ|title=Precious Treasures from the Diamond Throne: Finds from the Site of the Buddha's Enlightenment|last1=Schaik|first1=Sam Van|last2=Simone|first2=Daniela de|last3=Hidas|first3=Gergely|last4=Willis|first4=Michael D.|date=2021|publisher=British Museum|isbn=978-0-86159-228-9|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 == Area of Magadha == 
 Before Magadha expanded, its kingdom was limited by the [[Ganges]], [[Son River|Son]], and Campā rivers to the north, west, and east, while the southern border was formed by the eastern spurs of the Vindhya mountains. This initial Magadha kingdom covered what is now [[Patna]] and [[Gaya (India)|Gaya]] districts in the Indian state of [[Bihar]]. < ref > Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1953). ''Political History of Ancient India: From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of Gupta Dynasty''. University of Calcutta. pp. 110–118. < /ref > 
 
 Greater Magadha, which was part of the eastern [[Gangetic Plains of India|Gangetic plains]], included nearby areas and parts of [[Nepal]], and had its own unique culture and beliefs. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Greater Magadha: studies in the culture of early India|last=Bronkhorst|first=Johannes|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-15719-4|series=Handbook of oriental studies|location=Leiden}} < /ref >

 [[File:Bodh gaya before restoration.jpg|thumb|Historical image of Bodh gaya temple before restoration.]] 
 The Magadha people are mentioned in ancient texts like the [[Atharvaveda]] along with other groups. The main part of their kingdom was in [[Bihar]], south of the [[Ganges River]]. Their first capital was Rajagriha, later known as Rajgir, and then Pataliputra, which is modern [[Patna]]. Magadha grew by conquering Vajjika League and Anga, covering most of [[Bihar]] and parts of [[Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Odisha|Orissa]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], and [[Nepal]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3KDaZY85wYC & pg=PA128|title=Dynastic History of Magadha, Cir. 450-1200 A.D.|last=Sinha|first=Bindeshwari Prasad|date=1977|publisher=Abhinav Publications|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The kingdom is talked about in [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, as well as in the [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and the [[Puranas]]. The early rulers are not well-known, but the Haryanka dynasty led for about 200 years from 543 to 413 BCE. [[Gautama Buddha]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], lived in Magadha, gaining enlightenment in [[Gaya (India)|Bodh Gaya]] and giving his first sermon in Sarnath. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TVLlPvuMAC & pg=PA159|title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects|last1=Macdonell|first1=Arthur Anthony|last2=Keith|first2=Arthur Berriedale|date=1995|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe|isbn=978-81-208-1332-8|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the Shishunaga dynasty, and later, Mahapadma Nanda ended their rule in 345 BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] defeated the Nandas around 321 BCE, starting the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]]. Under King Ashoka, it expanded across [[India]]. After the Mauryan Empire, the Shunga and Khārabēḷa empires followed, replaced by the [[Gupta Empire]]. The Gupta capital remained in [[Patna|Pataliputra]] in Magadha. < ref > Tenzin Tharpa, ''Tibetan Buddhist Essentials: A Study Guide for the 21st Century: Volume 1: Introduction, Origin, and Adaptation'', p.31 < /ref >
