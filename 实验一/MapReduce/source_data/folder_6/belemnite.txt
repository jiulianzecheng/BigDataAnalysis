 '''Belemnites''' (or belemnoids) are an extinct group of marine [[cephalopod]], similar in many ways to the modern [[squid]], and closely related to the modern [[cuttlefish]]. < ref name=Yancey > Yancey T.E; Garvie C.L.  &  Wicksten M. 2010. The Middle Eocene ''Belosaepia ungula'' (Cephalopoda: Coleoida) from Texas: structure, ontogeny and function. ''Journal of Paleontology'' '''84''': 267.

 Like them, the belemnites had an [[ink sac]], < ref > Lehmann U. 1981. ''The Ammonites: their life and their world''. London: Cambridge University Press. < /ref >  but, unlike the squid, they had ten arms of roughly equal length, and no [[tentacle]]s. < ref name=Yancey/ > < ref > The name  " belemnoid "  comes from the Greek word ''belemnon'' meaning  " a dart or arrow "  and the Greek word ''eidos'' meaning  " form " . ''Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary.'' 2nd ed. 1979. < /ref > 
 
 The belemnites are a [[monophyletic]] group of [[superorder]] status, called the '''Belemnoidea'''. There are four [[Order (biology)|orders]]. 
 
 ==Occurrence== 
 The belemnites evolved from nautiloids, which are the basal group of cephalopods. Well-formed belemnite guards can be found in rocks dating from the [[Mississippian]] (or Lower Carboniferous). 
 
 Belemnites were numerous during the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods, and their [[fossil]]s are abundant in [[Mesozoic]] marine rocks, often with their cousins the [[ammonite]]s. The belemnites and ammonites become extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period. 
 
 == Life-style == 
 [[Image:BelemniteDB2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Belemnites]]  
 Like some modern squid, belemnite arms carried a series of small hooks for grabbing [[prey]]. Belemnites were efficient [[carnivore]]s that caught small [[fish]] and other marine animals with their arms and ate them with their beak-like jaws. 
 
 In turn, belemnites appear to have formed part of the diet of marine [[reptile]]s such as [[Ichthyosaur]]s, whose fossilized [[stomach]]s frequently contain hooks from the arms of cephalopods. 
 
 Belemnites swam in near-shore to mid-shelf oceans. < ref name=Monks1996 > Neale Monks, J. David Hardwick and Andrew S. Gale 1996. The function of the Belemnite guard. ''Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift'' '''70''', Numbers 3-4, 425-431, DOI: 10.1007/BF02988082 < /ref > 
 
 == Ancient ink == 
 Fossils which preserve the soft parts of belemnites show that, like many modern cephalopods, they had an ink sac, hard beaks, tail fins and large eyes. Well-preserved specimens show evidence of muscular fibers in the mantle, indicating that they were powerful swimmers like modern squids. 
 
 In 1826 [[Mary Anning]] discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite  fossil. She showed it to her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]] who was able to revive the ink with water, and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Other local artists were soon doing the same when more fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish|cuttle fish]], which she had dissected to better understand the anatomy of fossil [[cephalopod]]s. This led [[William Buckland]] to publish that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do. < ref > McGowan, Christopher 2001. ''The dragon seekers''.
