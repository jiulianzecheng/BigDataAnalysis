 '''Allspice''' (also called '''Jamaica pepper''', '''Kurundu''', '''Myrtle pepper''', '''pimento''', '''allspice berries''', or '''newspice''') < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/Dictionary/A/Allspice-4914.aspx |title= Allspice : Substitutes, Ingredients, Equivalents |work= gourmetsleuth.com |access-date= 27 April 2010 |archive-date= 5 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105041032/http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/Dictionary/A/Allspice-4914.aspx |url-status= dead }} < /ref >  is a [[spice]] which is the dried unripe [[fruit]] of the ''Pimenta dioica'' plant, a tree native to the West Indies, southern Mexico and Central America. The tree ''Pimenta dioica'' is from the myrtle family ([[Myrtaceae]]), and it is very valued for its berries. The allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]], and [[nutmeg]]. It is used very much in [[baking]], mostly for making [[mincemeat]] and mixed pickling spice. It was discovered first by the early [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers, who mistook it for a type of pepper. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/16644/allspice |title=allspice -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=britannica.com |access-date=27 April 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Allspice is the only spice grown in the Western Hemisphere. < ref name= " epicentre " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/allspice.html |title=allspice |work=theepicentre.com |access-date=27 April 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  But after that, the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left. There are many [[plantation]]s in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], too. However, the best allspice comes from [[Jamaica]] where the weather and soil are best for the berries. < ref name= " epicentre " / > 
 
 == History == 
 Allspice was used by the Mayans and by other South American Indians when making [[chocolate]]. The name ''Jamaica'' comes from Xamayca. This means ‘land of wood and water’ in the language of the [[:en:Arawak|Arawaks]]. The Arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting, or sometimes against their enemies. < ref name= " epicentre " / > 
 
 The spice was imported to [[Europe]] after it was discovered. There were many tries to plant it in the East, but it did not work because the trees could not give a lot of fruit. Even though it had a rich smell and a tasty flavor, allspice never had the same caché in Europe as [[cinnamon]] or [[Black pepper|pepper]]. < ref name= " epicentre " / >  The [[English people|English]] started taking the spice by ship to [[England]] in 1737, but by that time the want for spices had been taken over by other kinds of products such as [[sugar]] and [[coffee]]. It was still a little popular in England though, where it came to be known as the ''English Spice''. < ref name= " epicentre " / > 
 In the Napoleonic war of 1812, Russian soldiers put the spice in their boots to keep their feet warm. < ref name= " epicentre " / >  Because of this, today the pimento oil from the allspice is usually used for the men’s dress. 
 
 == Description == 
 
 Dried allspice berries look like large [[brown]] [[peppercorn]]s and their colors are [[cocoa]] brown. < ref > {{Cite web |url= http://www.aromaweb.com/essentialoilsaf/allspice.asp |title=Allspice Essential Oil (Pimento Berry/Leaf) |work=aromaweb.com |access-date=27 April 2010}} < /ref >  When the berries are not yet ripe, they are [[harvest]]ed and dried by the [[sun]]. They are different in size from between 4 and 7 [[milimeter|mm]] (1/8 - 1/4 in) in [[diameter]] and are dark brown. < ref name= " epicentre " / >  Their skin is very wrinkled, and  the outer case has two [[seed]]s. Allspice can be eaten [[ground]] or [[whole]]. < ref name= " epicentre " / > 
 
 == Storage == 
 
 Whole dried allspice can keep without a time limit if they are properly kept in airtight jars. They also must not face the light. It can be ground in a [[mill (grinding)|mill]] or an [[electricity|electric]] [[coffee]] grinder. After it is ground, the spice loses its flavor in a few days. < ref name= " epicentre " / >
