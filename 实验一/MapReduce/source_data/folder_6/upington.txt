The museum is also the home of a donkey statue, which recognises the enormous contribution that this animal made to the development of the region during the pioneering days of the 19th century. < ref > {{cite web |title=A Common Purpose |url=http://icarusfilms.com/if-purp |website=Icarus Films |access-date=4 September 2020}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |last1=O'Hara |first1=Marguerite |title=A Common Purpose - Study Guide |url=https://www.roninfilms.com.au/get/files/14550.pdf |publisher=[[Australian Teachers of Media]] |date=2013}} < /ref >
