''''Nontheism''' < nowiki/ > ' is a term that describes anyone who is not a [[theist]]. In other words, a '''nontheist''' is anyone who does not have a specific belief in a god or deity. It usually refers to anyone who does not have any [[religious]] [[belief]]. This is a lot like [[atheism]], but the two terms are often used in different ways. 
 
 == Origin of the term == 
 The term  " ''nontheism'' "  was first used by [[George Holyoake|G. J. Holyoake]] in 1852. < ref > " The Reasoner " , New Series, No. VIII. 115 < /ref >  He used it because of the bad associations with the term '''atheism'''. 
 : " Mr. [Charles] Southwell has taken an objection to the term Atheism. We are glad he has. We have disused it a long time [...]. We disuse it, because Atheist is a worn-out word. Both the ancients and the moderns have understood by it ''one without God, and also without morality''. Thus the term connotes more than any well-informed and earnest person accepting it ever included in it; that is, the word carries with it associations of immorality, which have been repudiated by the Atheist as seriously as by the Christian. Non-theism is a term less open to the same misunderstanding, as it implies the simple non-acceptance of the Theist's explanation of the origin and government of the world. " 
 
 == Nontheism in society == 
 Today, about 2.3% of the world's population describes itself as [[atheist]]. About 11.9% is described as ''''nontheist''''. < ref name= " Britannica demographics " > {{cite web
