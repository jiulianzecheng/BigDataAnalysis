 '''''Sahelanthropus tchadensis''''' is a [[fossil]] [[hominid]]. From evidence at the [[fossil]] site in [[Chad]] in the [[Africa]]n [[Sahel]], it is thought to have lived about 7 million years ago.  
 
 The split of the line into humans and [[chimpanzee]]s (known as ''human-chimpanzee divergence'') probably happened between 6.3 and 5.4 million years ago. This can be seen from [[genetics|genetic]] data. < ref name= " BBC-May-2006 " > {{cite news|date=May 18, 2006|title=Evolution's human and chimp twist|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4991470.stm|accessdate=1 April 2010}} < /ref >  Because the fossil is older than this spilt, its status is unclear. The first fossil found is known as ''Toumaï'' today. 
   
 == Fossils == 
 Some fossils, a cranium (skull), five pieces of [[jaw]], and some [[teeth]], make up a head that has features that are like both modern and primitive humans. The braincase is only 340 & nbsp;[[cubic centimetre|cm³]] to 360 & nbsp;cm³ in volume, about the same as chimpanzees. It is much less than the human volume of about 1350 & nbsp;cm³. 
 
 The teeth and structure of the face are very different from [[Homo sapiens]]. The cranium found is damaged, it is very [[wikt:distort|distorted]], so no 3D computer reconstruction has been made. There are no bones other than parts of the skull. It is unknown if ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' was [[bipedalism|bipedal]] (walked on two legs). The placement of the [[foramen magnum]] suggests they were, though. Its canine wear is similar to other Miocene apes. 
 
 == Relationship to modern humans and great apes == 
 ''Sahelanthropus'' may be an [[ancestor]] of both humans and chimpanzees; no consensus has been reached yet by the scientific community. The difficulty is caused by its  " [[mosaic]] of primitive and derived features " . < ref name=Guy/ >  Probably it lived in semi-open [[woodland]] and [[savannah]], rather than the [[rainforest]] of present-day apes. < ref name=Wolpoff/ > 
 
 Another possibility is that Toumaï is related to both humans and chimpanzees, but is the ancestor of neither. Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford, the discoverers of ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'', suggested that the features of ''S. tchadensis'' are consistent with a female proto-[[gorilla]]. Even if this claim is upheld, the find would still be significant, for at present few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa. Thus, if ''S. tchadensis'' is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees (or gorillas), it represents the first known member of ''their'' lineage.  
 
 Furthermore, ''S. tchadensis'' does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to resemble chimpanzees very much, as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists. < ref name=Guy > Guy F.

 The [[fauna]] found at the site suggest an age of more than 6 million years, as these [[species]] were probably [[extinct]] already by that time. < ref >  Brunet M. ''et al.'' 2005.

 === Possiblility of much earlier split === 
 One study has suggested a much earlier split between the line which led to modern apes, and the line which led to modern humans. < ref name= " Arnason " > {{cite journal|author=Arnason U|last2=Gullberg A.|last3=Janke A.|date=December 1998|title=Molecular timing of primate divergences as estimated by two nonprimate calibration points|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-molecular-evolution_1998-12_47_6/page/718|journal=J. Mol. Evol.|volume=47|issue=6|pages=718–727|bibcode=1998JMolE..47..718A|doi=10.1007/PL00006431|pmid=9847414|s2cid=22217997}} < /ref > 
 The complete [[mitochondria]]l [[DNA]] (mtDNA) molecule of the [[baboon]] ''[[Papio hamadryas]]'' was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] and included in a molecular analysis of 24 complete mammalian mtDNAs. The aim of the study was to time the divergence between the Old World [[monkey]]s ([[Cercopithidae]]) and the [[Hominoidea]]. That divergence, at 30 million years ago (mya), was a reference point for the split between chimpanzee, and ''Homo'' at 5 mya.  
 
 In the later study by Arnason and colleagues, two independent nonprimate molecular references were used. < ref > The divergence between [[artiodactyl]]s and [[cetacea]]ns at 60 MYBP and that between [[Equidae]] and [[Rhinocerotidae]] at 50 MYBP < /ref >  These two references  suggested that the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea divergence took place  > 50 mya. Also, all hominoid divergences receive a much earlier dating. Thus, the estimated date of the divergence between ''Pan'' (chimpanzee) and ''Homo'' is 10{{ndash}}13 mya and that between ''Gorilla'' and the ''Pan''/''Homo'' linage approximately 17 mya. The same datings were obtained in an analysis of clocklike evolving genes.
