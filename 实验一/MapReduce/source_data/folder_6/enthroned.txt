 '''Enthroned''' is a [[black metal]] band formed in [[Charleroi]] in 1993 by Cernunnos.  
 
 In 1996, along with Ancient Rites and [[Bewitched (Swedish band)|Bewitched]], Enthroned began a large tour of Europe.  
 
 In April 1997, as Enthroned was to begin recording ''[[Towards the Skullthrone of Satan]]'', Cernunnos took his life. Enthroned recorded the album with a session drummer in honor of Cernunnos. 
 
 In April 1998, the band toured the European continent with [[Dark Funeral]].   They also released the [[Mini CD|MCD]] ''Regie Axese'', which was dedicated to their former drummer Cernunnos. Later that year, they toured again with [[Hecate Enthroned]] and Usurper.  
 
 Enthroned continued to play many live gigs in and around Europe, as well as in the US.  
 
 In early 2002, Enthroned signed to [[Napalm Records]]. In 2003 they played a South American tour. Enthroned signed with [[Regain Records]] in January 2008. At this time, some members of the band opened a recording studio, Blackout Multimedia.  
 
 In September 2011, Enthroned said they would end working with Regain Records.
