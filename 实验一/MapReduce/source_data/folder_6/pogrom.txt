The target of the attack is a group of people because of their ethnic identity or religion, usually [[Antisemitism|Jews]]. In a pogrom, the local authorities such as the police do not arrest the rioters and do not come to the aid of the victims. < ref name=YIVO > {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |quote=The common usage of the term pogrom to describe any attack against Jews throughout history disguises the great variation in the scale, nature, motivation, and intent of such violence at different times. |title=Pogroms |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Pogroms |publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research |year=2010 |first=John |last=Klier |author-link=John Klier}} < /ref > 
 
 In a pogrom, the target people's homes, businesses, and places of worship are destroyed. People of the target group are physically attacked and some are [[murder]]ed.
