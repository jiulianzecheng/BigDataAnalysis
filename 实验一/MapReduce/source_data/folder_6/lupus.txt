 '''Lupus''', or '''Lupus erythematosus''', is a [[disease]] of the [[immune system]]. It is [[chronic]], which means it does not go away. It is an [[autoimmune disease]], where the person's immune system attacks their own body. 
 
 The [[immune system]] is partly made up of [[white blood cells]] in your body that fight off disease. In lupus, these white blood cells think that the healthy cells of the body around them are diseased, so they end up attacking healthy parts of the body. Lupus can be [[death|deadly]]. It causes swelling and [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] [[:wikt:damage|damage]], and can attack any part of the body. It most commonly affects the [[heart]], [[joint]]s, [[skin]], [[lung]]s, [[blood vessel]]s, kidneys and the [[brain]]/[[nervous system]]. Some symptoms include: fatigue, fever with no cause, hair loss, mouth sores, sensitivity to sunlight, a skin disease, and [[Raynaud's syndrome]]. There is [[treatment]] for lupus, called [[immunosuppression]], which is medicine that stops the white blood cells from damaging healthy cells for a while. After a while, this medicine wears off, and then the white blood cells go back to hurting healthy parts of the body again. For the disease of lupus, there is no cure that stops the white blood cells from attacking healthy parts of the body forever, but doctors are not giving up on finding a cure. 
 
 Lupus takes its name from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word  " lupus " , meaning [[wolf]]. This is because a lupus-caused rash on a person's face makes the person's face look like the face of a [[wolf]]. In the [[United States]] alone, there may be 270,000 to 1.5 million (1,500,000) people with lupus. [[earth|Worldwide]], it is [[estimate]]d (not known for sure, but a good guess) that over 5 million (5,000,000) people living with lupus. < ref > {{cite web |title=Lupus facts and statistics |url=https://www.lupus.org/resources/lupus-facts-and-statistics |website=Lupus Foundation of America}} < /ref >  The disease mainly affects young [[women]], but [[men]] can be affected as well.
