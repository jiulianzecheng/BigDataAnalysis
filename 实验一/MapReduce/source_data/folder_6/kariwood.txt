 Cinema in [[Karachi]] or '''Kariwood''' ({{lang-ur|کاری وڈ}}) had its golden days in the 1960s when some of the prominent movie studios were in [[Karachi]], making movies for the viewership of a large and growing working-class population. 
 
 With a metropolitan area hosting the world's second most populated city, the movie viewership is still popular in [[Karachi]]. However, the interest has shifted more towards the [[Hollywood]] and other international productions. One of the reasons for the shifting trends is attributed to the moving of film-making industry to [[Lahore]], locally termed as [[Lollywood]]
