 '''''Cootie''''' is a roll-and-move-, 3-dimensional, table-top children's game for 2 to 4 players. At the roll of the die, the player selects a component of the cootie such as the head or the tongue. The winner is the first to complete his cootie. Schaper's plastic bug has become an icon. For some, it is a symbol for the baby boomer generation. 
 
 The game was invented in 1948 by William Schaper. It sold in the millions after being launched in 1949. There were many games called  " Cootie "  in the early years of the 20th century. Only Schaper's game had a free-standing cootie though. The game is now produced by Hasbro [[subsidiary]] [[Milton Bradley]]. In 2003, ''Cootie'' was named to the Toy Industry Association's  " Century of Toys List " .
