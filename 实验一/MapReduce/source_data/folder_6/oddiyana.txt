 [[Padmasambhava]], an eighth-century [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] master and founder of the [[Nyingma|Nyingma school]], is believed to be born in Oddiyana. He had a crucial role in introducing [[Buddhism]] to [[Tibet]]. Siddha Garab Dorje, the founder of Dzogchen school, is also associated with this region. < ref > {{Cite book|title=A dictionary of Buddhism|last1=Keown|first1=Damien|last2=Hodge|first2=Stephen|last3=Jones|first3=Charles|last4=Tinti|first4=Paola|date=2003|publisher=Oxford Univ.

 Most scholars identify Oddiyana as the [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] in present-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]. Alexis Sanderson, after reviewing different views, suggests that it might have been near [[Kashmir]], with the modern [[Swat District|Swat Valley]] as a likely central point. Udyāna, meaning  " garden "  or  " orchard "  in [[Sanskrit]], is mentioned as north of [[Peshawar]] along the [[Swat River]], extending to the northern part of ancient Tianzhu ([[Indus River|Indus]] region). < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4SzEAAAQBAJ & dq=Oddiyana+Pakistan & pg=PA77|title=Profound Meditation Practices in Tibetan Buddhism|last=Dudeja|first=Prof (Dr ) Jai Paul|date=2023-03-14|publisher=Blue Rose Publishers|language=en}} < /ref >   
 
 According to the 8th-century [[Korea|Korean]] monk Hye Cho, Udyana was a [[Mountain|mountainous]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] region, and after visiting [[Gandhara]], he traveled north, arriving in Udyana, then continued northeast to [[Chitral]]. [[Faxian]] noted similarities in [[food]] and clothing between Udyana and the [[Indus Plain|Indo]]-[[North Indian Plain|Gangetic]] Plain. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2004-08-17|title=A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, by Fa-hsien (chapter8)|url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/f15l/chapter8.html|access-date=2023-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817021350/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/f/f15l/chapter8.html |archive-date=2004-08-17 }} < /ref >

 In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] traditions, Oddiyana is considered a vital source of [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric teachings]], with a rich history of flourishing [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tantra. Many [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] lineages, including Dzogchen founded by the siddha Garab Dorje, trace their roots to this region. It's believed that the first [[Vajrayana]] teachings were given by [[Gautama Buddha]] in Oddiyana, and important tantric texts like Mahayoga and Anuyoga were revealed there. < ref > Wallis, Christopher D.

 In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] literature, Oddiyana is described as having multiple [[King|kings]] named Indrabhuti. Additionally, it is sometimes equated with Shambhala, a mystical land inhabited by [[Dakini|Ḍākinīs]], beyond reach for ordinary mortals. In the 'Seven Line Prayer' of [[Padmasambhava]], Oḍḍiyāna is referred to as ཨོ་རྒྱན (o rgyan) in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]]. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_FyEAAAQBAJ & q=Oddiyana+Pakistan|title=The View from Malakand: Harold Deane's 'Note on Udyana and Gandhara'|last1=Morgan|first1=Llewelyn|last2=Oliveri|first2=Luca Maria|date=2022-06-02|publisher=Archaeopress Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-80327-208-5|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4SzEAAAQBAJ & dq=Oddiyana+Pakistan & pg=PA77|title=Profound Meditation Practices in Tibetan Buddhism|last=Dudeja|first=Prof (Dr ) Jai Paul|date=2023-03-14|publisher=Blue Rose Publishers|language=en}} < /ref >
