 A '''bus''' is a large wheeled [[vehicle]] meant to carry many [[passenger|passengers]] along with the [[bus driver]]. It is larger than a [[car]] or [[van]]. The name is a shortened version of '''omnibus''', which means  " for everyone "  in [[Latin]]. Unlike [[tram]]s or [[rapid transit|rapid transit trains]]. Buses used to be called omnibuses, but people now simply call them  " buses " . 
 
 Buses are an important part of [[public transport]] in places all over the world. Many people who do not have [[cars]], especially the [[third world]] countries, use buses to get around. Buses make it easy for them to get to where they want to go. 
 
 Buses can have many types of bus. For example : The [[double decker bus]]. 
 
 A place where people wait for a local bus is called a ''[[bus stop]]''.   A building where people wait for a long-distance bus or where many buses meet is called a ''[[bus station]]''. 
 
 There are many types of bus around the world. An example is a [[motorhome]], which is a bus-like [[vehicle]] equipped for living. Typically, a motorhome will include a [[lounge]] area, dining area, small [[bathroom]], a [[galley]], [[kitchen]] and a [[corridor|corrido]] < nowiki/ > r.
