 '''Sago''' {{IPAc-en|'|s|eI|g|oU}} is a [[starch]] that comes from the [[Sponge|spongy]] centre of tropical palm stems. In many cases, it comes from ''[[Metroxylon sagu]]''. It is a major [[staple food]] for many people living in [[New Guinea]] and the [[Moluccas]]. It is called ''saksak'', ''rabia,'' and ''sagu'' in those areas.  
 
 The largest [[Supply chain|suppliers]] are usually in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Big quantities of sago are often sent to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] for cooking purposes.
