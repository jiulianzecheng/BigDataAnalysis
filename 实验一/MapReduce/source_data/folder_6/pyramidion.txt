 A '''pyramidion''' (plural '''pyramidia''') is the very top piece of an [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid]]. < ref name= " Wilkinson " > Toby Wilkinson, The Thames and Hudson Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, Thames  &  Hudson, 2005. p.197 < /ref >  They were called ''benbenet'' in the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian language]]. < ref > Ermann, Grapow, ''Wörterbuch der  & auml;gyptischen Sprache'' 1, 459.13-14 < /ref >   In Egypt's [[Old Kingdom]], pyramidia were made of [[diorite]], [[granite]], or [[limestone]]. These were then covered in [[gold]] or [[electrum]]. The gold would reflect the rays of the sun. In later times they were made from granite < ref > [http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/pyramidions.htm Pyramidia] by Alan Winston < /ref >  which had royal titles and religious [[Symbolism (art)|symbols]] cut into them. < ref name= " Wilkinson " / > 
 
 Very few pyramidia still exist. Most of those that have are made of polished black [[granite]], with the name of the pyramid's owner cut into them. There are four pyramidia on show in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. They include the pyramidia from the [[Pyramid of Amenemhat III (Dahshur)|Black Pyramid]] of [[Amenemhat III]] at [[Dahshur]] and the [[Pyramid of Khendjer]] at [[Saqqara]]. < ref name= " Schulz " > editors Regine Schulz and Matthias Seidel (w/34 contributing Authors), ''Egypt, The World of the Pharaohs,'' Konemann, Germany: 1998.

 A badly damaged white [[Tura (Egypt)|Tura limestone]] pyramidion is thought to have been made for the [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Sneferu]] at Dahshur. It has been rebuilt and put on show at the side of the pyramid. However it does not match, as its angles are steeper than that of the sides of the pyramid.

 During the [[New Kingdom]], some private underground tombs had a small brick pyramid built on top of them. These pyramids were topped with a pyramidia. The four sides included texts and scenes about the cult of the Sun god [[Ra]]. 
 
 The scenes usually show the course of the sun. It is shown rising on one side, and setting on the opposite side, and traveling, through the night, through the [[underworld]], ruled by [[Osiris]].

 The pyramidion of the [[scribe]] Moses was made about 1250 BC from limestone. It is 53 & nbsp;cm tall and shows him making an offering, with his name, on two opposite sides. The other two sides show a [[baboon]] which represents the god [[Thoth]]. < ref > Peck, William. ''Splendors of Ancient Egypt,'' William H.
