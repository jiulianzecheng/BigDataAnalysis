 '''Christendom''' or the '''Christian world''', < ref > Marty, Martin E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MoolUlqQdmAC The Christian World: A Global History]. Modern Library chronicles, 29. New York: Modern Library, 2007. < /ref >  in the widest sense, means [[Christianity]] as a territorial [[:wikt:phenomenon|phenomenon]]. That means: those countries where most people are [[Christian]]s and because of that are part of Christendom. 
 
 People have used the term '''Christendom''' for the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] understanding of the Christian world as one single ''Body of Christ'' with Christ as the head.  With the rise of [[Modernity]] and the [[Reformation]] during the early [[16th century]] the understanding changed to a modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society that consists of many different communities.
