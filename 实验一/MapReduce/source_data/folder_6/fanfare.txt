 A '''fanfare''' is a short, showy, piece of [[music]] usually played for a special event. It is often played to announce the arrival of an important person, such as a king, queen or presidential leader. Fanfares are usually played by [[trumpet]]s or [[French horns]] and other [[brass instrument]]s, often with drums. The word  " ''fanfare'' "  can also mean an event with a high amount of publicity, even if there is no actual music. 
 
 ==History== 
 Fanfares began in the [[Middle Ages]]. Modern movies often show trumpets playing fanfares in [[ancient Rome]], but there is little evidence that this ever happened. In the [[18th century]] [[France]], the fanfare was a piece of music with energy and repeated notes. Modern fanfares come from the [[19th century]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] where they were written for important state events such as the [[coronation |crowning]] of a king or queen. [[Hubert Parry]] wrote a fanfare,  " I Was Glad " , for the [[coronation]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]].
