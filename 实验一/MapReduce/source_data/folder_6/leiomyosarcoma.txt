'''Leiomyosarcoma,''' also referred to as '''LMS''',  is a malignant ([[cancerous]]) [[smooth muscle]] [[tumor]]. It is a [[benign tumor]] originating from the same tissue called [[leiomyoma]].

Leiomyosarcomas can be very unpredictable. They can remain [[Cancer dormancy|dormant]] for long periods of time and recur after years. The cancer is aggressive and hardly responds to [[chemotherapy]] treatments. < ref name=LMS_info > {{cite web|title=Basic info|website=Leiomyosarcoma.info|url=http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/basic.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430111311/http://www.leiomyosarcoma.info/basic.htm|archive-date=2009-04-30}} < /ref >
