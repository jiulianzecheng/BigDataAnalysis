 '''''Gladiolus''''' (from [[Latin]], the [[diminutive]] of ''gladius'', a [[sword]]) is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the iris family ([[Iridaceae]]). Sometimes called the '''sword lily''', the most widely-used [[English language|English]] common name for these plants is simply '''gladiolus''' (plural '''gladioli''', '''gladioluses''' or sometimes '''gladiolas'''). 
 
 == Description == 
 The genus ''Gladiolus'' contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], mostly [[South Africa]]. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of ''Gladiolus'' endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce. 
 
 These attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate [[climate]]s. They grow from rounded, symmetrical [[corm]]s, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics. 
 
 Their [[Plant stem|stems]] are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved [[leaf|leaves]], enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a [[cataphyll]]. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section. 
 
 The fragrant [[flower]] spikes are large and one-sided, with [[secund]], bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery,  green [[bract]]s. The [[sepal]]s and the [[petal]]s are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three [[stamen]]s. The outer three [[tepal]]s are narrower. The [[perianth]] is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three [[filiform]], spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex. 
 
 The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is 3-locular with oblong or globose [[capsule (fruit)|capsules]], containing many, winged brown, longitudinally [[dehiscent]] [[seed]]s. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate. 
 
 These flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red.  
 
 The South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued [[anthrophorine]] bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by [[sunbird]]s, [[noctuid]] and [[Hawk moth|sphingid]] moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of [[Europe]] many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known [[wasps]]. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the [[wasps]]. Another [[insect]] in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known [[Europe]]an [[Hawk-moth]] ''[[Macroglossum stellatarum]]'' which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like ''[[Petunia]]'', ''[[Zinnia]]'', ''[[Dianthus]]'' and others. 
 
 Gladioli are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including the [[Large Yellow Underwing]].
