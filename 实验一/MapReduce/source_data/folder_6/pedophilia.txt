'''Pedophilia''' ('''''paedophilia''''' in [[British English]]) is a [[paraphilia]] and a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] [[disorder]] when a person 16 years of age or older is primarily or exclusively sexually attracted to [[child]]ren who have not begun [[puberty]] (usually under 14 years old). < ref name=APAstmt > {{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/news_room/press_releases/diagnosticcriteriapedophilia.pdf |work=APA STATEMENT|publisher=American Psychiatric Association |title=DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PEDOPHILIA |date=June 17, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629090023/http://www.psych.org/news_room/press_releases/diagnosticcriteriapedophilia.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-29}} < /ref > < ref name=SetoReview > Seto MC.(2009) [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153618 Pedophilia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727003511/http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153618 |date=2016-07-27 }}.

 ==Terminology== 
 A person with pedophilia (adults and older adolescents who are sexually attracted to pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]] [[Child|children]]) is called a ''pedophile''. The child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia. < ref name=APAstmt/ >  Adults whose primary or exclusive sexual attraction is for pubescent early [[Adolescence|adolescents]] (ages 11 to 14) are properly called [[Hebephilia|Hebephiles]], not pedophiles. Adults whose primary or exclusive sexual attraction is for late to post-pubescent [[Teenager|teens]] (ages 15 to 19) are properly called [[Ephebophilia|Ephebophiles]], but ephebophilia is not considered abnormal by mental health professionals. The opposite of pedophilia is ''Teleiophilia'' (the sexual attraction to young [[Adult|adults]]). A narrower sub-type of pedophilia is called N''epiophilia'' or ''Infantophilia'' (the sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children restricted to [[Baby|babies]]/[[Toddler|toddlers]]). 
 
 ==Condition== 
 Medically, this condition is classified by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] as a [[mental illness|mental disorder]]. < ref name=APAstmt/ > < ref name=WHOPaedophilia  > World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: ICD-10]''  Section F65.4: Paedophilia (online access via ICD-10 site map table of contents) < /ref >  Some pedophiles have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with children or use children in a sexual way. This is called  " [[child sexual abuse]] "  because by law, children are unable to truly agree to sexual acts with an adult. Some adults have pedophilic feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children. Some adults who are not pedophiles commit sexual abuse against children. 
 
 Not all pedophiles feel or act in the same way. Since the 1880s, psychologists have studied and shown that different pedophiles might act in different ways: < ref > Krafft-Ebing, R. von. (1886). ''Psychopathia sexualis: A medico-forensic study'' (1965 trans by H. E. Wedeck). New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons. {{ISBN|1-55970-425-X}}. < /ref > 
 
 * Some pedophiles are only sexually attracted to pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]] children. They are called exclusive pedophiles. 
 * Some pedophiles have a sexual preference for pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]] children but are sexually attracted to adults as well. They are called preferential pedophiles. 
 * Some adults who prefer adult sexual partners are also sexually attracted to pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]] children. 
 
 ==Studies== 
 ===General=== 
 For pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse, some studies have shown that pedophiles who are only attracted to children may abuse more children than pedophiles who also have adult sexual partners. < ref > Abel, G.

 The people who abuse children are often known to them—such as parents, other relatives, and friends—and are not strangers. < ref name=lanning3e > {{cite web |title=Child Molesters: A Behavioral Analysis (Third Edition) |url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |author=Lanning, Kenneth |year=2001 |publisher=National Center for Missing  &  Exploited Children |pages=25, 27, 29 |access-date=2015-02-14 |archive-date=2010-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224092439/http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/publications/NC70.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  One research study found that half the adults convicted of child sexual abuse of children outside of their family were also sexually abusing their own children. < ref > {{cite web|title=Cycle of child sexual abuse: links between being a victim and becoming a perpetrator|author=M.

 === Is it common? === 
 Medical researchers do not know how many people in the [[population]] are pedophiles. < ref name= " seto2004 " > Seto, M. C. (2004).  " [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16913283 Pedophilia and Sexual Offenses Against Children], "  ''Annual Review of Sex Research'', 15, 329-369. < /ref >  This is because it is hard to study people's feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings. Generally, the only pedophiles who can be studied are those who have both broken the law and been caught and convicted of child sexual abuse. A second reason is that when an adult or mid-to-late teenager [[child sexual abuse|sexually abuses]] a child, people often call the abuser a  " pedophile " , but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason, such as the unavailability of an adult partner. Experts generally define a person as a pedophile only if they are primarily or exclusively [[sexual arousal|sexually attracted]] to pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]] children. < ref name=SetoReview/ > < ref name= " Edwards " / > < ref name=Oxford/ > < ref name=Studer/ >  If a person sexually abuses a pre-pubescent child to frighten or punish them, for example, then it may not be true pedophile behavior. 
 
 Some sources, such as the Mayo Clinic, report that most child sexual abuse of pre-pubescent children is committed by pedophiles, < ref name=mayoclinic > {{cite journal |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |title=A profile of pedophilia: definition, characteristics of offenders, recidivism, treatment outcomes, and forensic issues |last=Hall M.D; Ryan C.W.  &  Hall R.C.W. |journal=Mayo Clin Proc |volume=82:457-471 2007 |publisher=MAYO Foundation |access-date=2015-04-07 |archive-date=2008-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040559/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  while other studies report that most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles. < ref name= " Zonana " > H. Zonana, G. Abel (1999): ''Dangerous sex offenders. A task force report of the American Psychiatric Association'' – Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association < /ref >  According to some studies, about 1% of all adult males may be pedophiles. < ref > Briere J.  &  Runtz M. 1989.

 ==Treatment== 
 As of 2008, most [[medicine|doctor]]s believe that pedophilia cannot be cured. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/5/838|title=Treatments to Change Sexual Orientation - BERLIN 157 (5): 838 - Am J Psychiatry|access-date=2015-02-14|archive-date=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612015442/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/5/838|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The current approach to deal with pedophiles who have been convicted of sexual abuse is to try to change their behavior. It does not change their sexual attraction. Using this treatment, it is believed that some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again. Medications such as Depo-Provera can be used to treat pedophilia. < ref > [http://www.atsa.com/ppOffenderFacts.html Public Policy < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >
