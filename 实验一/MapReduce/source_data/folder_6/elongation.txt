 '''Elongation''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] term that describes the angle between the [[Sun]] and a [[planet]], as viewed from [[Earth]]. 
 
 When an [[inferior and superior planets|inferior planet]] (Mercury or Venus) is visible after [[sunset]], it is near its '''greatest eastern elongation'''. When an inferior planet is visible before [[sunrise]], it is near its '''greatest western elongation'''. The value of the greatest elongation (west or east), for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], is between 18째 and 28째; and for [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] between  45째 and 47째. This value varies because the orbits of the planets are [[elliptical]], rather than perfect circles.
