 '''''Segnosaurus''''' (meaning  " slow lizard " ) was a [[herbivorous]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived during the late [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 93 million years ago. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Perle|first=A.|year=1979|title=Segnosauridae - novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii|journal=Trudy - Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya|volume=8|pages=45â€“55|url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf|access-date=2019-02-02|archive-date=2012-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It was a rather large [[Therizinosaur]]. This is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of theropods which were [[herbivores]]. They changed from the usual carnivorous [[lifestyle]] of their ancestors. 
 
 Four partial skeletons of ''Segnosaurus'' have been found in [[Mongolia]]. It had a long flexible neck, long head, three-toed feet, a broad strong pelvis, stocky legs with clawed fingers and toes, and a short tail. In 2010 Gregory Paul estimated the body length at six metres, the weight at 1.3 tonnes. < ref > Paul G.S. 2010. ''The Princeton field guide to dinosaurs''.
