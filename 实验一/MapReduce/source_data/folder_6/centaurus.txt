 '''Centaurus''' is a constellation in the southern hemisphere of the night sky.  It is named after a [[centaur]], which is a creature that is half man and half horse.  The astronomer named [[Ptolemy]] listed Centaurus when he made a list of 48 constellations.  Centaurus is also one of the 88 constellations that were made by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. 
 
 In the direction of Centaurus is the [[Shapley Supercluster]] or Shapl (SCl 124). This is the largest concentration of [[galaxies]] in our nearby universe.
