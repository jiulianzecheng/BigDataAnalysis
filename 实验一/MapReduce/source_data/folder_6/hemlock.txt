'''Hemlock''' is a [[herbal]] [[poison]] got from several related plants in the [[Apiaceae]] family. The toxic chemicals differ in each plant, but there is a general similarity in the way they work. 
 
 *''[[Conium]]'', two species. An extract of ''Conium maculatum'' was used to execute [[Socrates]]. This is the plant most often referred to as hemlock. There are eight [[alkaloid]]s found in ''Conium maculatum''. Two of them, [[gamma-coniceine]] and [[coniine]]  account for most of the plant's [[toxic|toxicity]]. Coniine disrupts the workings of the [[central nervous system]] by blocking the [[neuromuscular junction]] in a manner similar to [[curare]]. < ref name='Brooks2008' > {{cite web |last=Brooks |first=D.E. |title=Plant poisoning, Hemlock |date=2010-06-28 |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/821362-overview |publisher=eMedicine |work=MedScape |accessdate=2012-03-02}} < /ref >  These alkaloids are made by the plant, and are no doubt effective to [[defence against herbivory|stop herbivores eating the plant]]. 
 *''[[Cicuta]]'' water hemlock or cowbane: highly poisonous. Water hemlock is one of [[North America]]'s most toxic plants, being highly poisonous to humans. < ref name= " Schep " > Schep L.J. ''et al'' 2009. Poisoning due to water hemlock. ''Clinical Toxicology''. '''47''' (4): 270â€“78. [http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15563650902904332] < /ref >  Three members of the [[genus]] contain a [[toxin]], [[cicutoxin]], which causes [[central nervous system]] stimulation including [[seizure]]s. 
 *''Oenanthe crocata''  and several other species of the [[water dropwort]] are extremely poisonous. It has been referred to as the most poisonous of all British plants, < ref name= " ceh information sheet 31 " > {{cite web | url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/documents/31Oenanthecrocata.pdf | title=Information Sheet: 31 Hemlock Water Dropwort ''(Oenanthe crocata)'' | publisher=Centre for Ecology and Hydrology | year=2005 | accessdate=September 28, 2011 | quote=''Oenanthe crocata'' [...] is the most toxic plant in Britain to both humans and animals. | archive-date=February 24, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224082705/http://www.ceh.ac.uk/sci_programmes/documents/31oenanthecrocata.pdf | url-status=dead }} < /ref >  and is considered particularly dangerous because of its similarity to several edible plants. < ref > {{Citation|title=Hedgerow|last=Wright|first=John|isbn=978-1-4088-0185-7|year=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=171}} < /ref >  The active poison is [[oenanthotoxin]]. The poison produces the  " sardonic grin "  a [[spasm]] of the facial muscles that produces what appears to be a [[grin]]. The poison was said to be used in ancient  [[Phoenician]] [[Sardinia]] to kill old people who could no longer support themselves. < ref name=  " NGM " > {{Cite news | last = Owen  | first = James | title = Ancient Death-Smile Potion Decoded? | work = National Geographic News | accessdate = 2009-10-18 | date = 2009-06-02 | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090602-smiling-death-potion.html }} < /ref >
