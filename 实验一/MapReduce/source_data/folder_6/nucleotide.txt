 A '''nucleotide''' is an [[organic compound|organic molecule]]. Nucleotides are the building blocks of the [[nucleic acid]]s [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. These two types of nucleic acid are essential [[biomolecule]]s in all forms of [[life]] on [[Earth]]. 
 
 A nucleotide is composed of a [[nucleobase]] (nitrogenous base), a five-carbon sugar (either [[ribose]] or [[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]]), and one [[phosphate]] group. < ref > {{cite book|title=The ACS style guide: effective communication of scientific information|year=2006|publisher=American Chemical Society|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8412-3999-9|edition=3rd|editor=Coghill, Anne M.; Garson, Lorrin R.|page=244}} < /ref > < ref name=Alberts > Alberts B  ''et al'' 2002. ''Molecular biology of the cell''. 4th ed, Garland Science, 120â€“121. {{ISBN|0-8153-3218-1}} < /ref >  Nucleotides contain either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]] base. '''Ribonucleotides''' are nucleotides in which the sugar is [[ribose]]. '''Deoxyribonucleotides''' are nucleotides in which the sugar is [[deoxyribose]]. 
 
 In [[DNA]], the purine bases are [[adenine]] and [[guanine]], and the pyrimidines are [[thymine]] and [[cytosine]]. [[RNA]] uses [[uracil]] in place of thymine.  Adenine always pairs with thymine by 2 hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine through 3 hydrogen bonds, each due to their unique structures. 
 
 Nucleotides also play a central role in [[metabolism]] at a fundamental, cellular level. They provide chemical energy for the many cellular functions that need it. Examples are: [[amino acid]], [[protein]] and [[cell membrane]] [[synthesis]], moving the cell and cell parts (both internally and intercellularly), [[cell division]], and so on. < ref name=Alberts/ >  In addition, nucleotides work in [[cell signaling]], and they are in important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] of enzymatic reactions (e.g. [[coenzyme A]], [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], [[flavin mononucleotide|FMN]], [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], and [[NADP+|NADP < sup > + < /sup > ]]). 
 
 In experimental [[biochemistry]], nucleotides can be labeled using [[radionuclide]]s to make radionucleotides.
