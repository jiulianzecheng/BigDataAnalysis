 In [[geology]], '''volcanology''' (also spelled '''vulcanology''') is the part of [[geology]] that studies [[volcano]]es, [[lava]], [[magma]], and other related things. The term ''volcanology'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''[[Vulcan (mythology)|vulcan]]'', the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of fire.   
 
 A '''volcanologist''' is a person who studies volcanoes and their eruptions. Volcanologists visit volcanoes often, especially [[active volcano|active one]]s. This makes it a dangerous science. They analyze physical and chemical variations related to historical and current activity of the volcanoes.   
 
 Volcanologists look at [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], collect material from the eruptions, such as [[Volcanic ash|ash]] or [[pumice]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[lava]] samples.
