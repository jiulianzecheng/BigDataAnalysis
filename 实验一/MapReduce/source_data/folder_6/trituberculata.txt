 The '''Trituberculata''' is an extinct group of [[mammals]] in the [[fossil]] record from about 215â€“85 illion years ago (mya). The discoveries were isolated teeth, so not much else can be said about the animals. They were small [[insectivores]], and probably [[nocturnal]]. < ref > Kermack K.A; Lees, Patricia M.  &  Mussett, Frances 1965. ''Aegialodon dawsoni'': a new trituberculosectorial tooth from the Lower Wealden.

 The name comes from the three tubercles (cusps) of the [[molar teeth]] (not to be confused with [[Triconodonta]]). The [[clade]] Trituberculata is not always regarded as valid. They probably do not form a [[monophyletic]] group. Instead, some may be  " true "  [[basal]] mammals (though not always closest related to each other). Others (such as the symmetrodonts) may fall just outside the therian [[crown group]].
