 '''''Gorgonops''''' (literally  " [[Gorgon]]' face " ) is the name given to an extinct [[genus]] of [[therapsid]] which lived about 255-250 million years ago, during the latest part of the [[Permian|Permian period]]. It was a typical representative of the Gorgonopsia, the dominant predators of their day, which in the largest forms grew to over four meters long.
