 '''Dignity''' in humans involves the earning or the expectation of personal [[respect]] or [[wikt:esteem|esteem]]. 
 
 " All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood " . 
 Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 
 
 It is easy to show that many [[societies]] do not agree with this in practice. The civilised [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]] regarded other races as [[barbarians]]. A shocking example was [[Aristotle]]'s advice to [[alexander the Great|Alexander]] to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a [[despot]] to the [[barbarian]]s, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'. < ref > Green P. 1991. ''Alexander of Macedon'', University of California Press. < /ref > < sup > p58 < /sup >  Many societies based on religion have treated persons of other religions harshly, with little dignity. And sometimes political movements have deliberately and openly talked about and treated some groups as not having human dignity. [[Nazi]] treatment of the [[Jews]] came after a long period of [[propaganda]] against their humanity and dignity.
