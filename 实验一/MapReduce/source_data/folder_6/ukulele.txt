 The '''ukulele''' ({{pronEng|ˌjʉːkəˈlɛɪli}} from the Hawaiian ʻukulele, pronounced [[:en:Help:IPA_for_English#Key|/ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ/]]) is a [[musical instrument]] with four strings. It is also called the ''uke'' for short. Ukuleles are part of the [[guitar]] family of instruments. The strings are usually tuned G, C, E, A or A, D, F < sub > # < /sub > , B.  Ukuleles normally have [[nylon]] strings or gut strings.  
 
 Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor and baritone. Sopranino and bass ukuleles also exist. Sopraninos are tuned to standard tuning, however, baritone ukuleles are tuned to '''D, G, B, E''' (the top four strings of a [[guitar]]). Bass ukuleles are tuned '''E, A, D, G''' ([[bass guitar]] and [[double bass]] tuning). 
 
 The ukulele was invented in the [[19th century|19th Century AD]] in [[Hawaii]], where people got the idea from small guitar-like instruments known as [[cavaquinho]]s brought to the [[island]] by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Sailor|sailors]].
