The '''Chagossians''' (also '''ÃŽlois''' or '''Chagos Islanders''') are people who previously lived on the [[Chagos Islands]]. They are of [[African diaspora|African]], [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Malays|Malay]] ancestry. They lived on [[Diego Garcia]], [[Peros Banhos]] and the [[Salomon Islands|Salomon]] island chain, as well as other islands. They were [[Forced migration|forcibly removed]] from the islands by the [[British government]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This was done at the request of the [[United States government]], so that Diego Garcia could become a [[military base]]. Most Chagossians now live in [[Mauritius]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. No Chagossians live in the Chagos Islands anymore, as it is now the site of the military base [[Camp Justice (Diego Garcia)|Camp Justice]]. 
 
 The Chagossians are mostly descended from African people, particularly from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]] and Mauritius. There is also a significant proportion of Indian and Malay ancestry. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/background/news-archive/june-2012-update |title=June 2012 update  & #124; The UK Chagos Support Association |publisher=Chagossupport.org.uk |date=2009-05-12 |access-date=2013-08-01 |archive-date=2013-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512011106/http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/background/news-archive/june-2012-update |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The French brought some to the Chagos islands as [[slavery|slaves]] from Mauritius in 1786. Others arrived as fishermen, farmers, and coconut [[plantation]] workers during the 19th century. 
 
 The Chagossians speak [[Chagossian Creole]], a [[creole language]] based on [[French language|French]]. It has words that come from various African and Asian languages. It is part of the [[Bourbonnais Creole]] family. Chagossian Creole is still spoken by some of their descendants in Mauritius and [[Seychelles]]. Chagossian people living in the UK speak [[English Language|English]]. 
 
 On 22 May 2019, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution [86] asking the United Kingdom to surrender the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius within six months.
