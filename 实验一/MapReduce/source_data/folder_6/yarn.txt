'''Yarn''' is a long, continuous length of [[fiber]]s that have been [[spinning|spun]] or [[felt]]ed together. Yarn is used to make [[cloth]] or different wearable [[accessories]] including [[shoes]], [[hats]], [[scarfs]], etc. by [[knitting]], [[crocheting]] or [[weaving]]. Yarn is sold in a shape called a skein to prevent the yarn from becoming tangled or knotted.

 Yarn can be made from any number of natural or synthetic fibers such as [[wool]], cotton, [[silk]], or acrylic. Some yarns are made from a blend of several kinds of fibers. 
 
 Yarns come in many thicknesses or weights from fine to thick: [[lace]], fingering, sock, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran, bulky, and super-bulky. Very fine yarn is called [[thread]] and is used in [[sewing]] and [[embroidery]]. 
 
 Yarn can also be used to crochet.
