 '''Chlorine''' ([[chemical symbol]] '''Cl''') is a [[chemical element]]. Its [[atomic number]] (which is the number of [[protons]] in it) is 17, and its [[atomic mass]] is 35.45. It is part of the 7th column ([[halogen]]s) on the [[periodic table]] of elements.  
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Chlorine is a very irritating and greenish-yellow gas. It has a strong, bleach-like smell. It is toxic and bad for you. It can be made into a liquid when cooled. It is heavier than air. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 Chlorine is highly reactive. It is more reactive than bromine but less reactive than fluorine. It reacts with most things to make chlorides. It can even burn things instead of oxygen. It dissolves in water to make a mixture of [[hypochlorous acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]]. The more [[acid]]ic it is, the more chlorine is made; the more [[base (chemistry)|basic]] it is, the more hypochlorous acid (normally turned into hypochlorite) and hydrochloric acid (normally turned into chlorides) are there. Chlorine reacts with [[bromide]]s and [[iodide]]s to make bromine and [[iodine]].  
 
 ===Chlorine compounds=== 
 {{see also|Category:Chlorine compounds}} 
 Chlorine exists in several oxidation states: -1, +1, +3, +4, +5, and +7. The -1 state is most often in [[chloride]]. Chlorides are not reactive. Compounds containing chlorine in its +1 oxidation state are [[hypochlorite]]s. Only one is common. They are a strong [[oxidizing agent]], as are all + oxidation state compounds. +3 is in [[chlorite]]s. +4 is in [[chlorine dioxide]], a common chlorine compound that is not a chloride. +5 is in [[chlorate]]s. +7 is in [[perchlorate]]s. Hypochlorites are most reactive, while perchlorates are the least reactive. 
 
 Many [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds have chlorine in them. [[Freon]] has chlorine in it. PVC (poly-vinyl chloride), a common plastic, has chlorine in it.  
 
 Chlorine oxides can be made, but most of them are very reactive and unstable.

 ==Occurrence== 
 Chlorine is not found as an element. [[Sodium chloride]] is the most common chlorine ore. It is in the ocean (sea salt) and in the ground (rock salt). There are some organic compounds that have chlorine in them, too. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 It is made by [[electrolysis]] (the passing of electricity through a solution to make chemical reactions happen) of [[sodium chloride]]. This is known as the [[chloralkali process]]. It can also be made by reacting [[hydrogen chloride]] with [[oxygen]] and a [[catalyst]]. It can be made in the laboratory by reacting [[manganese dioxide]] with [[hydrochloric acid]]. It is made when [[sodium hypochlorite]] reacts with hydrochloric acid. This is a dangerous reaction that can happen without anyone knowing. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 
 === For water purification === 
 As of 2021, the main use of chlorine is for [[bleach]]. It is also added to [[water]], as a way of purifying it. Chlorine is both very reactive, and very poisonous. It will act as a [[disinfectant]]: if it is added to water, it will kill off [[bacteria]] and other [[organism]]s. [[Swimming pool]]s are often filled with water that has been treated that way.  
 
 === As a chemical weapon === 
 Germany used chlorine as a [[chemical weapon]] in the First World War. They used it at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in 1915. < ref > " Battle of Ypres "  ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' < /ref > < ref name= " CEN2015 " > {{cite journal|last=Everts|first=Sarah|date=February 23, 2015|title=When Chemicals Became Weapons of War|url=http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/|journal=Chemical  &  Engineering News|volume=93|issue=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330203223/http://chemicalweapons.cenmag.org/when-chemicals-became-weapons-of-war/|archive-date=March 30, 2016|url-status=live}} < /ref >  According to soldiers, which were present at the battle, the chlorine smelled like a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung the back of the throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] of the lungs to form [[hydrochloric acid]]. Hydrochloric acid will destroy living tissue. It often kills. [[Gas mask]]s with [[activated charcoal]] or other filters can protect the respiratory system. This makes chlorine gas much less deadly than other [[chemical weapons]]. German scientist [[Fritz Haber]] of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in Berlin was the first to use it. Together with [[IG Farben]], he developed methods of how to use chlorine gas against an [[Trench|entrenched]] enemy. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC & pg=PA226|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|author1=Smil, Vaclav|date=2004-04-01|isbn=978-0-262-69313-4|page=226|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220856/https://books.google.com/books?id=G9FljcEASycC & pg=PA226|archive-date=2015-12-31|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Chlorine is heavier than air, so it will stay in the trenches.

 Because it is easily available, chlorine is still used as a chemical weapon in war. That way, it has been used in the [[Syrian civil war]]. < ref > {{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Rick|date=2017-02-13|title=Syria Used Chlorine Bombs Systematically in Aleppo, Report Says|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/middleeast/syrian-chlorine-bombs-aleppo-human-rights-watch.html?_r=0|url-status=live|access-date=2017-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515042507/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/world/middleeast/syrian-chlorine-bombs-aleppo-human-rights-watch.html?_r=0|archive-date=2017-05-15}} < /ref >   < ref > {{cite news|date=2016-09-07|title=Syrian forces 'drop chlorine' on Aleppo|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37291182|url-status=live|access-date=2017-05-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513191745/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37291182|archive-date=2017-05-13}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|date=2017-03-06|title=Ignoring UN, Russia and Assad continue Syrian chemical weapons and bombing attacks labeled war crimes|website=[[Fox News]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/06/ignoring-un-russia-and-assad-continue-syrian-chemical-weapons-and-bombing-attacks-labeled-war-crimes.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425092749/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/06/ignoring-un-russia-and-assad-continue-syrian-chemical-weapons-and-bombing-attacks-labeled-war-crimes.html|archive-date=2017-04-25|access-date=2017-05-11}} < /ref >  It has also been used in an [[improvised explosive device]] in Iraq, in 2015. < ref > {{cite news|date=March 14, 2015|title=Lab report on chlorine gas usage|publisher=Kurdistan Region Security Council|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/efilp3g8mxwiev4/Lab-Report-Kisic-Junction-Chlorine.pdf?dl=0}} < /ref > 
 
 === Other uses === 
 Chlorine is used to make many compounds that are important: both [[chloroform]] and [[carbon tetrachloride]] contain chlorine. 
 
 ==History== 
 It was discovered in 1774 by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] who thought it had oxygen in it. Chlorine was named in 1810 by [[Humphry Davy]] who insisted it was an element. The US made all water chlorinated (added chlorine to water) by 1918. 
 
 == Safety == 
 It is [[toxic|poisonous]] in large amounts and can damage [[skin]]. When it is [[Inhalation|inhaled]] (breathed in), it irritates the lungs, eyes, and skin badly. It can cause fire with some things because it is very reactive. It is heavier than air, so it can fill up enclosed spaces.
