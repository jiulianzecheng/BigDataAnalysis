 " '''Hatikvah''' "  ({{lang-he|התקוה}}, {{small|say: {{respell|hah|tik|VAH}}}}, meaning  " The Hope " ) is a [[Jewish]] [[folk song]] that is the [[national anthem]] of [[Israel]]. The words of the song were written by [[Naftali Herz Imber]] in 1877, and about a [[decade]] later, his words were put to music by Shmuel Cohen. The words of the song are based on a longer poem written by Imber himself. < ref name= " knesset " / > < ref name= " torah " / > < ref name= " info " / > 
 
 ==Background== 
 The song tells about the [[Jews]]' [[Millenium|two-thousand-year-old]] [[Zionism|hope]] of returning to their [[homeland]] of Israel. The words of the song are based on a nine-[[stanza]] poem called  " '''Tikvatenu''' "  ({{lang-he|תקותנו}}, {{small|say: {{respell|tik|və|TEN-oo}}}} , meaning  " Our Hope " ), which was written by Imber himself.  " Hatikvah "  uses only the first stanza and the refrain of Imber's poem. The last line of the refrain was changed, and the words were put to music. The music is from a very old and popular folk song that Samuel Cohen, a [[Jew]] born in [[Spain]], found himself humming one day. It is played in a [[minor key]]. The words to the song are about the Jews' hope that one day their sadness will be turned into joy. < ref name= " knesset " / > < ref name= " torah " / > < ref name= " info " / >

 |  < poem > As long as in the heart, within, 
 The soul of a Jew still yearns, 
 And onward, towards the ends of the east, 
 an eye still gazes toward Zion; 
 
 Our hope is not yet lost, 
 The hope of two thousand years, 
 To be a free nation in our land, 
 The land of Zion and Jerusalem. < /poem > 
 |  < poem > O while within a Jewish breast, 
 Beats true a Jewish heart, 
 And Jewish glances turning East, 
 To Zion fondly dart; 
 
 O then our Hope—it is not dead, 
 Our ancient Hope and true, 
 To be a nation free forevermore 
 Zion and Jerusalem at our core. < /poem >
