 The '''stamen''' is a male [[reproduction|reproductive]] organ of a [[flower]]. It produces the [[pollen]]. The stamen has two parts: '''anther''' and stalk. The stalk is also called a '''filament'''. 
 
 The anther contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo [[meiosis]], and produce pollen grains, which contain the male [[gamete]]s ([[sperm]]). 
 
 The pollen grains are actually [[haploid]] male [[gametophyte]]s. < ref > This is to do with [[alternation of generations]]. All plants go through a cycle with a [[haploid]] gametophyte alternating with a [[diploid]] sporophyte. In the case of [[flowering plant]]s the gametophyte stage is very small and brief. < /ref > 
 
 The pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the [[stigma]] of the same or another flower. This process is known as [[pollination]]. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a ''pollen tube'' and the two male gametes move through the pollen tube to the [[ovule]].
