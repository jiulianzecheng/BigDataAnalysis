When two [[chemical substance]]s come in contact with each other, through what is called a [[Phase (matter)|phase]], they will interact with each other in that phase. They may also have an  [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]. If a substance accumulates within a phase this is called [[absorption]], if the same process happens on the interface, it is called [[adsorption]]. In the year 1909, [[James William McBain]] introduced the word '''Sorption''' to describe such a process, in the case where it is not easy or meaningful to make a difference between absorption and adsorption.  
 
 Examples of where the concept of sorption is important are measuring the [[pollution]] of the [[environment]]; using sorption it is possible to bind [[pollutant]]s to small particles in the air (called [[aerosol]]s), or in the soil (where they bind to [[colloid]]s). Sorption makes these bindings possible. In much the same way, polluants can be transported over long distances.  
 
 [[Machine]]s and processes that use sorption include the [[absorption refrigerator]] and [[solar air conditioning]].
