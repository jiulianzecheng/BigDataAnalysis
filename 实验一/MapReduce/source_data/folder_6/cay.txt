 A '''cay''' (also spelled '''key'''; both pronounced alike as  " key "  {{IPAEng|kiː}}) is a small, low [[island]] made of mostly [[sand]] or [[coral]] and on top of a [[coral reef]]. 
 
 The [[English language|English]] word ''cay'' comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''cayo'' and this from the [[Taíno]] word ''cayo'' meaning  " small island " . < ref > " ...cayos en esta lengua son islas "  ( " ...cays in this language are islands " ) {{cite book

Because it is a Taíno word,  " cay "  (and the other forms) are used mainly in the [[Caribbean]], but the type of island is in [[tropical]] seas where there are coral reefs. 
 
 Sand cays are built on the edge of the coral reefs, opposite the direction from which the [[wind]] blows most of the time. Because of that, cays are often elongated. [[Tide]]s and [[wind]] (and sometimes sea [[bird]]s) deposit coral [[debris]]. [[Weather]] affects the formation of cays greatly. Large tides bring much more debris onto the cay and make it larger, while a [[hurricane]] destroys a cay. 
 
 Some cays are very large; Cayo Coco, north of Cuba, is about 370 km < sup > 2 < /sup > . Those large cays are being used for [[tourism]] because they have [[beach]]es with white sand and the presence of coral reefs.
