 The '''Sparassodonta''' were an [[Order (biology)|order]] of carnivorous [[metatheria]]n [[mammal]]s. They are all now [[extinct]]. < ref > *{{cite book |author=Goin, Francisco J |chapter=Early marsupial radiations in South America |editor=Menna Jones |editor2=Mike Archer |editor3=Chris Dickman |title=Predators with pouches: the biology of carnivorous marsupials |year=2003 |publisher=CSIRO |pages=30–42 |isbn=9780643099487 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IqhZoTEF10C & pg=PA30}} < /ref > 
 
 The sparassodonts were native to [[South America]]. They were once thought to be true marsupials, but are now classified as a sister taxon to them. < ref > Simpson, George Gaylord 1941.

 A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble [[placental]] predators that evolved separately in Eurasia. They were first described by [[Florentino Ameghino]], from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of [[Patagonia]]. 
 
 ==Features== 
 Members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental [[carnivora]], but they were not closely related. They are a very good example of [[convergent evolution]].  
 
 For example, sparassodont molars were similar to the meat slicing teeth of modern [[Felidae|cats]]. The [[canine]]s were also lengthened, and in some cases, such as ''[[Thylacosmilus]]'', resemble those of [[saber-toothed cat]]s like ''[[Smilodon]]''. Their body size varied, ranging from 80 & nbsp;cm (2 & nbsp;ft 8 in) long to the size of today's modern big cats. 
 
 Another family of large predators wrere the [[borhyaenid]]s, which were more like wolves or dogs.
