 It can be hard for many people to tell what letters are in some pieces. < ref name= " :1 "  / >  Straight-letters are a type of piece with letters that are clear and easy to read, and wildstyle pieces have letters with unusual shapes and extra bits attatched, which can make them very hard to read. Some writers like that wildstyle is hard to read because it means only other writers can read them. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Gopinath|first=Gabrielle|editor-first1=Troy R. |editor-first2=Elizabeth |editor-last1=Lovata |editor-last2=Olton |chapter=Ornament as Armament: Playing Defense in Wildstyle Graffiti|date=2015|chapter-url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315416137-11/ornament-armament-playing-defense-wildstyle-graffiti-gabrielle-gopinath|title=Understanding Graffiti|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315416137 |isbn=978-1-315-41613-7|access-date=2023-08-28}} < /ref >  Sometimes when a writer wants people to know they made the piece, they will write their [[Tag (graffiti)|Tag]] and their crews tag next to it. < ref name= " :5 "  / > 
 
 == History == 
 People first notices pieces in the 1980s on trains in the [[New York City Subway|New York Subway]], but the metro decided not to send painted trains out because they didn't want people to write on the trains anymore. This made writers go and write in other places isntead of the trains. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Gregory J.|date=2006-04-01|title=Graffiti media and the perpetuation of an illegal subculture|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1741659006061716|journal=Crime, Media, Culture: An International Journal|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=93–101|doi=10.1177/1741659006061716|s2cid=144911784 |issn=1741-6590}} < /ref > 
 
 People are more likely to call pieces  " art " . Since the later 2000s, sometimes business with pay people to do pieces that advertise them < ref name= " :4 "  / >  and local governments will pay people do do pieces in places they don't want other less popular types of graffiti, like tags. This works because most graffiti writers don't write over another writers piece. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Dovey|first1=Kim|last2=Wollan|first2=Simon|last3=Woodcock|first3=Ian|date=2012-02-02|title=Placing Graffiti: Creating and Contesting Character in Inner-city Melbourne|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13574809.2011.646248|journal=Journal of Urban Design|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/13574809.2011.646248|hdl=11343/230654 |s2cid=110689365 |issn=1357-4809|via=Taylor  &  Francis Online}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2015-05-19|title=Why Don't Murals Get Covered By Graffiti in the Mission?|url=https://www.kqed.org/news/10530644/why-dont-murals-get-covered-by-graffiti-in-the-mission|access-date=2023-09-04|website=KQED|language=en-us}} < /ref >
