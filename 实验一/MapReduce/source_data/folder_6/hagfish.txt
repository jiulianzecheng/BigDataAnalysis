 '''Hagfish''' are [[craniates]] in the superclass [[Cyclostomata]], class '''Myxini'''. Hagfish do not have a skeleton, except they do have a [[skull]], which is made of [[cartilage]]. 
 
 Because of this, many researchers think Myxini should not be in the [[phylum|subphylum]] [[Vertebrata]]. < ref > Neil A. Campbell and J.B. Reece 2005. ''Biology''. 7th ed, Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco CA. < /ref >   However, because of its fins and [[gill]]s, they are called fish. They are marine, meaning they live in the sea. 
 
 The original 19th century classification groups hagfish and lampreys together as [[cyclostomata|cyclostomes]] (or historically, [[Agnatha]]), as the oldest surviving class of [[vertebrates]] alongside [[gnathostomata|gnathostomes]] . An alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish, so vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish. 
 
 Recent DNA evidence supports the original scheme. < ref name=r3 > {{cite journal|author=Janvier P. |year= 2010|title=MicroRNAs revive old views about jawless vertebrate divergence and evolution|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107|pages=19137–19138|quote=Although I was among the early supporters of vertebrate paraphyly, I am impressed by the evidence provided by Heimberg et al. and prepared to admit that cyclostomes are, in fact, monophyletic.

 == Description == 
 Hagfish are usually about half a [[meter]] (18 [[inch|in]]) long. They have long, [[eel]]-like bodies. Hagfish's eyes are small and not very useful, because the hagfish uses mostly its senses of smell and touch to find food. The [[whisker]]s near the hagfish's mouth are called barbels, and are used for touching. They have four [[heart]]s, two [[brain]]s, and no backbone. < ref > Aird WC (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=16_Xy2CXaxcC & dq=hagfish+They+have+four+hearts,+two+brains & pg=RA1-PA67 ''Endothelial biomedicine''] p. 67.

 == Feeding == 
 Hagfish eat [[invertebrate]]s (animals such as worms) and are also [[scavenger]]s, eating fish which are dead or dying. Hagfish have four sets of [[tooth|teeth]] on their tongue to bite pieces of [[flesh]] from its prey. They use these tongue teeth to eat. The teeth pinch together to lock onto its food, helping it tear into dead and dying fish which have sunk to the bottom of the sea, where it lives. Often, a hagfish digs into the dead fish that it is eating, removing the insides of the dead fish. < ref > " [http://www.nhc.ed.ac.uk/index.php?page=493.470.480 Modern Jawless Fish: Hagfish and Lampreys] "  The Natural History Collections of the University of Edinburgh. 2006. Retrieved 2014-3-9. < /ref > 
 
 Usually, people only see hagfish when nets that sweep the sea floor are pulled up. Every fish, even the dead ones at the bottom of the sea, are brought up into the boat by the net. In some of those dead fish, hagfish are found eating. The smelly fish are dumped onto the deck of ships with the hagfish poking out from their bodies. 
 
 == Slime == 
 When hagfish are afraid, they make [[slime]]. This slime comes out of the sides of the hagfish's body. They are able to make enough slime to completely fill a two-[[gallon]] bucket. The reason such a small fish can make so much slime is because the slime comes out in strings that quickly swell up much bigger when they are in the water.Their unusual way of eating and their slime has made many people call the hagfish the most  " disgusting "  of all sea creatures. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/html/02-0325-01.html|title=Friends of Oceanography Public Lecture Series - Explores the strange, wondrous, and disgusting hagfish|date=2002-03-25|publisher=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=2008-02-19}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/2003-06e/26-27.htm|title=Slimy, disgusting and useful|publisher=Norwegian University of Science and Technology|accessdate=2008-02-19|archive-date=2009-10-16|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016075828/http://www.ntnu.no/gemini/2003-06e/26-27.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/04deepscope/logs/aug9/aug9.html|title=Disgusting hagfish and magnificent sharks|last=Frank|first=Tammy|date=2004-08-09|publisher=NOAA Ocean Explorer|accessdate=2008-02-19}} < /ref >  Although hagfish are sometimes called  " slime eels, "  they are not [[eel]]s at all. < ref > [http://www.seasky.org/monsters/sea7a1q.html Sea and Sky: Atlantic Hagfish < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref >

 == Uses of hagfish == 
 
 === Food === 
 Hagfish are usually not eaten by humans in most countries. However, meat from the inshore hagfish (a type of hagfish known as ''kkomjangeo'' (꼼장어) or ''meokjango'' (먹장어) in [[Korean (language)|Korean]] and ''Nuta-unagi'' in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]) is a popular food in [[Korea]]. < ref > [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Eptatretus_stoutii.html#economic_importance_positive  " Eptatretus stoutii " ] Animal Diversity Web, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. 2006.

 === Material === 
 Hagfish skin is used to make leather for [[wallet]]s and belts. When this leather is sold, it is called  " eel skin " . < ref > [http://www.snopes.com/science/eelskin.asp  " Eel for Real " ] snopes.com. 2007-7-21. Retrieved 2014-3-9. < /ref > 
 
 === Slime === 
 [[Scientist]]s are studying hagfish slime to see if they can use it to make things. The strings of [[protein]] in hagfish slime are thin and strong, so they are a useful material. Because it is not made from [[petroleum|oil]], hagfish slime would be more [[environmentally friendly]] than the plastics that we use now. < ref > [http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/hagfish-slime-super-clothes-121203.htm  " Hagfish Slime Makes Super-Clothes "  ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517002138/http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/hagfish-slime-super-clothes-121203.htm |date=2013-05-17 }} Eric Niiler, Discovery News. 2012-12-3.
