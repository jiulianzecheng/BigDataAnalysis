 [[File:Hatshepsut Temple.jpg|thumb|right|Djeser-Djeseru is the main building of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple complex at Deir el-Bahri. Designed by Senemut, her [[Vizier]], the building is an example of perfect [[symmetry]] that predates the [[Parthenon]]. It was the first complex built on the site, which would become known as the [[Valley of the Kings]].]]

 '''Hatshepsut''' (1507–1458 BC), meaning ''Foremost of Noble Ladies'', < ref > Clayton, Peter. Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames  &  Hudson Ltd, 1994. p104 < /ref >  was the fifth [[Pharaoh]] of the 18th dynasty of [[Ancient Egypt]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hatshepsut |title=Hatshepsut |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=27 July 2007}} < /ref >  Hatshepsut reigned longer than any other woman of an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Egyptian [[dynasty]]. < ref name=T/ >   
 
 Her father was [[Thutmose I]]. Her predecessor was [[Thutmose II]] (her brother and husband). Her successor was [[Thutmose III]], her [[nephew]], the son of Thutmose II by a lesser wife. Thutmose III was co-regent with his stepmother, and was head of the army, but Hatshepsut was the effective ruler, and the named Pharaoh. 
 
 Today it is generally recognized that Hatshepsut assumed the position of Pharaoh. The length of her reign usually is given as twenty-two years. The third-century B.C. historian, [[Manetho]], gave that figure of twenty-one years and nine months, and he had access to many records that now are lost. She died in 1458 BC, which means that she became pharaoh in about 1479 BC. 
 
 ==Major accomplishments== 
 Hatshepsut established the [[trade route|trade network]]s that had been disrupted during the [[Hyksos]] occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period. 
 
 Many [[Egyptologist]]s have claimed that her [[foreign policy]] was mainly peaceful. < ref name=T > Tyldesley, Joyce  1998. ''Hatchepsut: The female Pharaoh''. Penguin, pp. 137–144. < /ref >  However, there is evidence that Hatshepsut led successful [[military campaign]]s in [[Nubia]], the [[Levant]], and [[Syria]] early in her career. The conquered lands being taxed and looted made egypt rich. < ref > {{cite web|url= https://mts.cengage.com/course/HRTCF6AZTT23CUQA8808/edition/student/activity/NFUX8XMK3NSEKFNE8792|title=3.1 Hatshepsut Expands Trade|access-date=January 28, 2023}} < /ref > 
 
 ===Building projects=== 
 Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt. She commissioned hundreds of construction projects throughout both [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Lower Egypt]], that were grander and more numerous than those of any of her [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] predecessors. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs. 
 
 She employed the great architect [[Ineni]]. He also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal [[vizier]] [[Senemut]]. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections. For example, the Hatshepsut Room in [[New York City]]'s [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] is made up of some of these pieces. 
 
 Following the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments built at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]]. At Karnak, she also restored the original Precinct of [[Mut]], an ancient goddess of Egypt, that had been damaged by the Hyksos occupation. She had twin [[obelisk]]s, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. One still stands, as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth. The other has broken in two and fallen down. 
 
 As with many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was her [[mortuary]] [[temple]]. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahri. It was designed and implemented by Senemut at a site on the [[Thebes, Egypt|West Bank]] of the [[Nile River]] near the entrance to what now is called the [[Valley of the Kings]]. The focal point was the [[Djeser-Djeseru]] or  " the Sublime of Sublimes " , a structure of perfect harmony built nearly one thousand years before the [[Parthenon]]. Djeser-Djeseru sits on a series of agricultural [[terrace]]s that once had lush [[garden]]s. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a [[cliff]] face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri complex were significant advances in architecture. Another of her accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle (the [[granite]] obelisk). 
 
 === Amun === 
 The [[Oracle]] of [[Amun]] proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, which strengthened her position. She showed Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments: 
 : " Welcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands " . < ref > Breasted, James Henry 1906.
