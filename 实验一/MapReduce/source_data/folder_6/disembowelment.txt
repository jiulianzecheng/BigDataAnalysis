 '''Disembowelment''' is when some or all of the [[Abdomen|belly]] organs are removed. They are usually removed through a horizontal cut across the belly area.  Animals and fish are generally disembowelled before being eaten.  
 
 Disembowelment may happen from an accident, but has also been used as a way to hurt or kill someone. Disembowelment  has been used as a severe form of [[capital punishment]]. 
 
 [[Mummification]], especially as practiced by the [[ancient Egyptians]], started with the removal of internal organs before the preservation of the rest of the body. The removed organs were [[Embalming|embalmed]], stored in [[canopic jars]] and then placed in the [[tomb]] with the body.
