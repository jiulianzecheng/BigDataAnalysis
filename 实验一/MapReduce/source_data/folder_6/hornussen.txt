 '''Hornussen''' is sport played in [[Switzerland]]. Its name comes from the [[Hockey puck|puck]] which is called a  " Hornuss "  ([[hornet]]) or  " Nouss " . When hit, the hornuss can whizz through the air at up to 300 km/h (186.4 mph) and creates a buzzing sound. < ref name= " MySwitzerland " > {{cite web|url=http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/hornussen-where-the-nouss-flies-from-the-ramp-and-into-the-playing-field.html|title=Hornussen - Where the Nouss flies from the ramp and into the playing field.|website=MySwitzerland.com}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.lebendigetraditionen.ch/traditionen/00069/index.html?lang=en|title=Hornussen - Living traditions|website=www.lebendigetraditionen.ch|access-date=2020-02-11|archive-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306131810/http://www.lebendigetraditionen.ch/traditionen/00069/index.html?lang=en|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It is a team sport, played between two teams of 16-20 players. Teams take turns to see how far they can hit the hornuss, while the other team attempts to stop it in the air with a type of bat, called a  " schindel " . 
 
 Together with [[Schwingen]] and [[Steinstossen]], Hornussen is seen as a Swiss national sport. There are only a few teams in other countries.
