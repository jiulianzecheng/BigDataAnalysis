'''Refining''' is the name for a number of processes that purify or concentrate a substance. The name is used for [[natural resource]]s, [[food]] and technical products. The place where this is done, is often called a '''refinery'''. 
 ==Petroleum==

 [[Petroleum]] contains [[hydrocarbon]]s. After [[distillation]], it still contains [[chemical compound]]s with [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]] and  [[Nitrogen]] as well as other unwanted compounds, such as [[Alkalene]]s. Processed petroleum is used for [[lubricant]]s; the substances mentione are unwanted in lubricants as they can speed up the aging process. For this reason, they are extracted using a process called [[hydrogenation]]. In hydrogenation, [[Hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]] [[gas]]es are produced. These gases require special handling, as they are very [[toxic]]. 
 
 ==Vegetable oil== 
 [[Vegetable oil]]s and fats are produced by chemical or mechanical extraction from [[plant]]s. This produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances, such as [[pigment]]s and smell, which influence the quality of the refined product. In essence, the factors influenced are taste, [[shelf life]], smell and color, as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations. Depending on the process, between four and eight percent of usable vegetable oil is lost. There are two basic procedures to refine vegetable oil, chemical refining, and physical refining. 
 
 ==Sugar== 
 [[Sugar]] is washed, and treated with concentrated [[syrup]]. Its colored because most customers expect sugar to be white. The white sugar sold in shops in almost pure [[sucrose]]. It has an extent of 99,8 percent of its weight. 
 
 ==Metals==

 There are two basic processes to refine [[metal]]s: Refining by fire, and refining by  [[electrolysis]]. Higher grades of purity require both processes, lower grades use only the first process.  
 
 ==Table salt== 
 Salt that is gained through [[evaportation]] of seawater needs to be cleaned; this is done by dissloving it in [[brine]] and then forcing it to crystallize. After the process, it is no lnoger possible to distinguish it from the salt extracted from rocks, by a [[mining]] process. Depending on the country, table salt for common use as a [[food additive]] may have [[Iodised salt|iodine]] added. Sometimes [[Potassium fluoride]] is added as well.
