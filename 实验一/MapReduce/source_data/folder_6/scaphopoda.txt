 '''Scaphopoda''', which are called '''tusk shells''' in [[English language|English]] is a class of [[Ocean|marine]] [[mollusc]]s. The name of the class can be translated as [[shovel]]-footed. These animals vary in size, most are small though. These animals usually do not live in the [[tide|tidal zone]], they dig themselves into [[mud]]dy or [[sand]]y ocean floors, up to a depth of about 700m. There are about 500 recent [[species]]. [[Fossil]]s of over 900 species have been described. As of 2009, it is unclear how many of these descriptions are valid species.  
 
 These species live in an elongated [[tube]], which is open on both ends, but which can be closed on one end. The animal lives inside the tube, and is attached to it. Scaphopoda do [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]].
