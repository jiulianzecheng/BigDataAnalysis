 A '''sport utility vehicle''' (SUV) is a type of [[vehicle]]. It is built as a rugged vehicle for cargo and passenger carrying. Originally SUVs were not [[design]]ed to be fuel efficient but modern designs are getting better [[miles per gallon|fuel mileage]]. In 2014 [[US]] sales of SUVs were over five [[million]] vehicles (like in [[hatchback]]s, [[minivan]]s, [[station wagon]]s, and [[van|passenger van]]s, and towing heavy trailers like [[pickup truck]]s). < ref > {{cite web |url=https://suvvehicle.com/2023/12/20/the-2024-toyota-rav4-hybrid-is-a-no-nonsense-suv/ |title=The Hybrid is a no-nonsense SUV |author=Faysite |date=20 December 2023 |website= |publisher=SUV Vehicle |accessdate=28 December 2023 }} < /ref >

 A similar class of vehicle is the [[crossover SUV]],  a common Northern American term.

 Early SUVs were built like light [[commercial]] and light wheeled military utility vehicles. Famous examples were the World War [[Jeep]] (US), < ref > {{cite web|title=sport utility vehicle {{!}} automobile|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1116736/sport-utility-vehicle |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223192327/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1116736/sport-utility-vehicle |archive-date=2009-02-23 |url-status=dead}} < /ref >  and the [[Land Rover]] (UK). < ref name= " Bradsher " > {{cite book|first=Keith |last=Bradsher |title=High and Mighty: SUVs—The World's Most Dangerous Vehicles and How They Got That Way |url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58648-203-9 }} < /ref > 
 
 The term  " sport utility vehicle "  came into popular use in the late 1980s. Until then, they were marketed as [[station wagon]]s. An early example of marketing a civilian off-roader as a  " sports utility "  is the two-door pickup version of the 1966 [[Ford Bronco]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://image.fourwheeler.com/f/101899557+w600+cr1/011-1966-bronco-specifications.jpg |title=1966 Ford Bronco U-100 4-Wheel Drive models  &  features brochure |publisher=Ford |location=US |year=1965 |access-date=4 January 2018 |archive-date=3 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103170428/http://image.fourwheeler.com/f/101899557+w600+cr1/011-1966-bronco-specifications.jpg |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  In 1974 [[Jeep]] used the term  " sport(s) utility vehicle "  exactly in their brochures for the 1st generation [[Jeep Cherokee]]. 
 
 == Off-roading sports == 
    [[File:Range Rover Camel Trophy in Kraków (1).jpg|thumb|right|220px|{{Center|Camel Trophy Land Rover}}]] 
 Many kinds of off-roading in the USA are centered around SUVs.  
 * '''[[Rockcrawling]]''' is a popular off-road sport. Vehicles used for rock crawling are usually modified with different [[tires]], suspension and gear ratios. Rock crawling takes time to learn and can be very expensive. Most rock crawlers have full-time jobs and many get sponsors to help with the costs. < ref > Patrick Hueller, ''Rock Crawling: Tearing It Up'' (Minneapolis: Lerner Publications Company, 2014), pp. 24–25 < /ref >  The object is to get the vehicle across difficult to near-impossible rocks and terrain without completely destroying the vehicle. 
 * The '''[[Camel Trophy]]''' competition (1981–2000) was an annual 4x4 competition. The first Camel trophy was held on the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]], a {{convert|4,000|km}} road across [[Brazil]]. Over the next eight years, the expeditions crossed [[Sumatra]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Zaire]], Brazil, [[Borneo]], [[Australia]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sulawesi]] before returning to the Amazon. After the first year the endurance event came to be dominated by specially equipped Land Rover vehicles. The Camel Trophy Owners Club is a group of people who collect ex-Camel Trophy vehicles.    
 * '''Jeep Jamborees''' have been held since 1953. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/events/1501-2014-big-bear-jeep-jamboree/ |title=2014 BIG BEAR JEEP JAMBOREE |author=Bob Carpenter |date=25 November 2014 |website= |publisher=Fourwheeler Network |accessdate=14 January 2015}} < /ref >  Jeep Jamborees are off-road excursions that travel historic and scenic trails across the US. In 2013 alone there were 32 events in various locations. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.trucktrend.com/autoshows/events/163_1312_first_annual_roof_of_the_rockies_jeep_jamboree/ |title=The First Annual Roof of the Rockies Jeep Jamboree |author=Sue Mead |date=3 December 2014 |website= |publisher=Truck Trend |accessdate=13 January 2015 |archive-date=9 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209075858/http://www.trucktrend.com/autoshows/events/163_1312_first_annual_roof_of_the_rockies_jeep_jamboree/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  All models of Jeep enter the events and drivers range from first time off-roaders to seasoned veterans. 
 * '''[[Easter Jeep Safari]]''' is an [[Year|annual]] event held at [[Moab, Utah]]. It has been held every year since 1967. < ref name=Buckley424 > R. Buckley, ''Adventure Tourism'' (Wallingford, UK; Cambridge, MA: CABI Publishing, 2006), p. 424 < /ref >  It runs for nine days ending on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] and can have up to 1,000 vehicles of all kinds; not just Jeeps. < ref name=Buckley424/ >  It uses up to 40 trails in the Moab area. Trails are rated from easy to difficult. 
 * '''King of the Hammers''' is a one-day 200+ mile endurance [[Off-road racing|off-road race]]. < ref name=Newswire > {{cite news |title=Nitto Tire Named Title Sponsor of 2015 King of the Hammers|author=Nitto Tire |newspaper=GlobeNewswire |date=8 January 2015 |url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/01/08/696116/10114765/en/Nitto-Tire-Named-Title-Sponsor-of-2015-King-of-the-Hammers.html |accessdate=14 January 2015}} < /ref >  It combines [[desert racing]] and [[rock crawling]]. This race is held in February on Means Dry Lake at [[Johnson Valley, California]] [[USA]]. 2015 will be the 9th annual King of the Hammers event. < ref name=Newswire/ >  The vehicles are extremely modified and for off-road use only. 
 
 == Popularity == 
 There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular. One reason is the comfort of their large cabins. Many models can carry almost as much as a minivan. Another reason is the driver sits higher than other cars, giving better all-round vision. SUVs with truck frames are heavier (sometimes much heavier) than standard cars. Their size gives them an image of safety. < ref > Keith Bradsher, ''High and Mighty: The Dangerous Rise of the SUV'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2003), p. xiii < /ref > 
 
 Men aren't the only targets of SUV and CUV ads. For example, some [[Advertising|ads]] for the [[Subaru Forester]] are deliberately aimed at women buyers. < ref > Jack Solomon, ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'' (Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martins, 2012), p. 61 < /ref >  Roughly 35 to 40 percent of SUV buyers are women. < ref > Deborah Clarke, ''Driving Women: Fiction and Automobile Culture in Twentieth-Century America'' (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), p. 103 < /ref >  Ads commonly show SUVs driving across [[wikt:boulder|boulder]]s or perched on a [[Mountain|mountain peak]]. < ref name=Kilbourne103 > Jean Kilbourne, ''Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel'' (New York: Touchstone, 1999), p. 103 < /ref >  Advertisers know that one important reason many people buy SUVs is image. < ref name=Kilbourne103/ > 
 
 Practicality for larger families is a consideration. Not only can the vehicle take a family of five or six, plus luggage, but also the family dog (who often has a special compartment at the back). On the other hand, the vehicle doesn't fit standard parking spaces. That can be quite a problem in, for example, the UK. The alternative, when groups of more than four travel, is to take more than one standard size car. 
 
 == Other names == 
 In [[Australia]] and [[Europe]] SUVs are often called 4 wheel drives ('''4X4''') or 4WDs.
