 '''Metamorpho''' is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. The character is an elemental superhero with the power to shape-shift his body into various forms, using the elements contained within the human body. He also possesses the power of virtual invulnerability in his inert state. Originally known as the archaeologist '''Rex Mason''', exposure to the Orb of Ra in Egypt changed him into one of the mythical Metamorphae. Although Metamorpho's powers allow him to fight against evil, they are also a curse in that he is trapped in this hideous form, unable even to die. He is primarily one of the [[Outsiders]], but has also been a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], [[Doom Patrol]], [[Justice League Europe]], the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and [[The Terrifics]]. 
 
 ''Metamorpho'' was created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Ramona Fradon]]. His first appearance was in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #57 (1965). 
 
 The character will make his live-action cinematic debut in ''[[Superman: Legacy]]'' (2025) and will be played by [[Anthony Carrigan]].
