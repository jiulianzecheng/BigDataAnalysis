 A '''stroke''' is an illness in which part of the [[brain]] loses its [[blood]] supply. This can happen if an [[artery]] that feeds blood to the brain gets clogged, or if it tears and leaks. 
 
 A stroke is when there is a lack of blood flow to the brain. There are two types of strokes. One is when there is a blood clot blocking the artery. The other type of stroke is when a blood vessel bursts and there is blood moving around freely in the brain. < ref > Stroke; Overview. N.p.: GALE Cengage Learning, n.d. Health and Wellness Resource Center. Web. 22       Feb. 2016. < /ref > 
 
 A stroke is the rapid loss of brain function(s) due to disturbance in the [[blood supply]] to the brain. This can happen because of [[Ischaemia|ischemia]] (lack of blood flow) caused by blockage ([[thrombosis]], [[arterial embolism]]), or a [[haemorrhage]] (leakage of blood). < ref > {{cite journal |author=Sims NR, Muyderman H |title=Mitochondria, oxidative metabolism and cell death in stroke |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease |volume= 1802|issue= 1|pages= 80–91|date=September 2009  |pmid=19751827 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.09.003}} < /ref > 
 
 As a result, the affected area of the brain cannot work properly. [[Symptom]]s might include: [[hemiplegia]] (an inability to move one or more [[limb]]s on one side of the body), [[aphasia]] (inability to understand or use language), or an inability to see one side of the [[visual field]]. < ref name=Donnan > {{cite journal |author=Donnan GA|author2= Fisher M|author3=Macleod M|author4= Davis SM |title=Stroke |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9624 |pages=1612–23 |date=May 2008  |pmid=18468545 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60694-7|s2cid= 208787942}} < /ref > 
 
 A stroke is a [[medical emergency]]. It can cause permanent damage. If it is not quickly treated, it may lead to death. It is the third most common cause of [[death]] and the most common cause of disability for adults in the United States and Europe. 
 
 Strokes happen on both the left and right side of the brain. When a stroke happens on the left side of someone’s brain, it affects the right side of the body. It can also cause problems with the patient’s speech and language. If a stroke affects the right side of the brain, it affects the left side of the body. It also changes patient’s spatial (relating to space) perceptions. Getting a stroke on the right side of the brain can also cause people to not acknowledge their illness. Patients behave impulsively and neglect the side of their body. < ref name= " Blaser, Larry 2014 " > Blaser, Larry.  " Stroke. "  The Gale Encyclopedia of Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. 5th ed. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale, 2014. Student Resources in Context. Web. 22 Feb. 2016. < /ref > 
 
 Factors that increase the risk of a stroke include [[old age]], [[high blood pressure]], a previous stroke, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]], [[smoking]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[migraine]] with aura, and [[thrombophilia]] (a tendency to [[thrombosis]]). Of those factors, the most easy to fix are high blood pressure and smoking. 
 
 == How are strokes identified? == 
 
 === Pre-hospital === 
 The [[Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale]] was designed to help  " pre-hospital "  medical professionals (like [[Emergency Medical Technician|EMT]]s) identify a possible stroke before the patient gets to the hospital. < ref name= " pmid16147478 " > {{cite journal |author=Hurwitz AS|author2= Brice JH|author3= Overby BA|author4= Evenson KR |title=Directed use of the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale by laypersons |journal=Prehosp Emerg Care |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=292–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16147478 |doi=10.1080/10903120590962283 |s2cid= 36600255|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120590962283}} < /ref >  It tests three basic [[Signs and symptoms|signs]].  If any of these signs are not normal, the patient may be having a stroke and should be transported to a [[hospital]] as soon as possible. < ref name= " pmid16147478 " / > 
 
 #''Facial droop:'' Have the person smile or show his or her teeth. 
 #* Normal: Both sides of face move equally 
 #* Abnormal: One side of face does not move as well as the other (or at all); part of the face looks like it is drooping 
 #''Arm drift:''  Have the person close his or her eyes and hold his or her arms straight out for about 10 seconds. 
 #* Normal: Both arms move equally or not at all 
 #* Abnormal: One arm does not move, or one arm drifts down compared with the other side 
 #''Speech:''  Have the person say,  " You can't teach an old dog new tricks, "  or some other simple, familiar saying. 
 #* Normal: Patient uses correct words with no slurring 
 #* Abnormal: Patient's speech is slurred, patient uses incorrect words, or is unable to speak 
 
 About 72% of patients who cannot do one of these three tasks normally are having an ischemic stroke.  More than 85% of patients who cannot do all three tasks are having an acute stroke. < ref > {{cite book |author=American Heart Association |title=Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Provider Manual |url=https://archive.org/details/advancedcardiova0000unse_m9r8 |publisher=First American Heart Association Printing |location=USA |year=2011 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancedcardiova0000unse_m9r8/page/137 137] |isbn=9-781616-690106 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=April 24, 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 ===  " Spot a stroke "  === 
 The 'spot a stroke' campaign, created by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, teaches everyday people how to recognize a stroke. It teaches the basic tests from the Cincinnati Stroke Scale, using the [[acronym]] FAST: < ref > {{cite web |date=2015 |url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp# |publisher=American Stroke Association |title=Spot a Stroke|accessdate= |quote=}} < /ref > 
 * '''F: Face''' - Facial Droop.  Is one side of the face drooping or numb?  Ask the person to smile.  Is the person's smile uneven? 
 * '''A: Arm''' - Arm Weakness.  Is one arm weak or numb?  Ask the person to raise both arms.  Does one arm drift downward? 
 * '''S: Speech''' - Speech Difficulty. Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or hard to understand? Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence, like  " The sky is blue. "  Is the sentence repeated correctly? 
 * '''T: Time''' - Time to Call 911.  If someone shows any of these symptoms, even if the symptoms go away, it is time to call 9-1-1. 
 
 === In the hospital === 
 Once the patient is in the hospital, doctors can find out for sure whether they are having a stroke by looking at their brain with special scanning machines, like an [[MRI]] or a [[CT scanner]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke/diagnosis|title= How is a Stroke Diagnosed? |date=2015-10-28 |website=|publisher=American Heart, Lung, and Blood Association |accessdate=2015-10-27 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Prevention== 
 Strokes can kill. To prevent a stroke, doctors advise people to: 
 *Control blood pressure 
 *Stop smoking 
 *Exercise at least once a week  
 *Stay at a healthy weight 
 *Do not drink too much 
 *Get regular checkups < ref name= " Blaser, Larry 2014 " / > 
 
 ==Statistics== 
 *795,000 people in the United States get a stroke each year 
 *One out of four people who have a stroke die (137,000 deaths from stroke per year) 
 *Currently, 3 million people in the US have disabilities from strokes 
 *In US, strokes cost $57.9 billion per year (damage and loss of work) 
 *⅔ of stroke happen in people 65 and up 
 *Strokes affect men more than women 
 *Women more likely to die from stroke than men 
 *Strokes are more common in African Americans  
 *Strokes are more likely to be fatal in African Americans 
 *Stroke rates in older adults are declining but rates in younger people are rising (scientists think that it’s related to obesity)  
 *Physical therapy can help patients 
 *Some people are in a wheelchair after getting a stroke 
 *10% of survivors suffer no long term disabilities 
 *10% of survivors suffer from so many disabilities that they have to stay in 24 hour care < ref name= " Blaser, Larry 2014 " / >
