'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy]] or a way of thinking about the [[world]]. Humanism is a set of [[ethics]] or ideas about how people should live and act. People who hold this set of ethics are called humanists. < ref > Nicolas Walter, Nicolas 1997. ''Humanism â€“ What's in the Word''. London: Rationalist Press Association. {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}} < /ref > < ref > Norman, Richard 2004. ''On humanism: thinking in action''. London: Routledge. < /ref >  Humanists prefer [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]].  
 
 In modern times, humanism is close to [[secularism]]. It refers to a non-[[theism|theistic]] approach to life, looking to science instead of religious [[dogma]] in order to understand the world. < ref > See for example the [[British Humanist Association]]'s [https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/ definition of Humanism] < /ref >  The term was made widely known by scientists in the mid-20th century. Many wanted to recognise human values, but without depending on religion as the main source of values. < ref > Biology and humanism, Chapter 10 of Dromnamraju, Krishna R. 1993.

 Views held by many humanists include: 
 * Humans deserve respect. Every human should be treated with respect and allowed to have [[dignity]]. If all people act with respect for others, then people will live in peace and trust. 
 * People should all be able to decide how they want to live their lives. They should use [[reason]]ing to make decisions and solve problems. 
 * Humanists decide what choices are good by whether those choices will help make human life better and the world around them. 
 
 == History == 
 Humanist ideas were discussed in [[Ancient Greece]], from [[Thales]] to [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Protagoras]]. The teachings of [[Zarathushtra]] and [[Lao Tzu]] had strong elements of humanism, and there are many other examples. 
 
 The writings of the ancient Greeks were studied in the 1400s during the [[Renaissance]]. However, in this period the term  " humanism "  came to mean educated in the [[humanities]], a rather different kind of idea. [[Petrarch]] is often cited as the first modern humanist, but he pointed backwards to classical authors. The modern meaning of humanism is more to do with using science to make the world a better place.  
 A comment by the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in 1925 was  
 : " The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts " . < ref > Whitehead A.N. [1925] 1997. ''Science and the modern world'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 96. < /ref >
