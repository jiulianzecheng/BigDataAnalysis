 '''Glossolalia''', or '''speaking in tongues''', is speaking rapid speech-like [[syllable]]s which cannot be understood. In some cases it is part of religious practice. < ref name=DictPsych > " Glossolalia n. "  ''A Dictionary of Psychology''. Edited by Andrew M. Colman. Oxford University Press 2009. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/pub/views/home.html Oxford Reference Online]. Retrieved 5 August 2011. < /ref >  Some consider it as a part of a [[sacred]] language. It is a common practice amongst [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic]] [[Christianity]].

 In 1972 a linguist from the University of Toronto published an assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia. < ref name=S > {{Cite book|first=William J. |last=Samarin |title=Tongues of men and angels: the religious language of Pentecostalism |url=https://archive.org/details/tonguesofmenange0000sama |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1972 |oclc=308527}} < /ref >  His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Jamaica]], [[Canada]] and the [[US]]. 
 
 Samarin found that glossolalic speech is like human language in some respects. The speaker uses [[accent]], [[rhythm]], [[intonation]] and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of [[syllable]]s. The syllables are formed from [[consonants]] and [[vowels]] taken from a language known to the speaker: 
 < blockquote > 
 It is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels... in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically... with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity. < ref name=S/ > < sup > p120 < /sup > 
 < /blockquote > 
 
 Samarin found that the resemblance to human language was just on the surface. He concluded that glossolalia is  " only a facade of language " . < ref name=S/ > < sup > p128 < /sup >  The syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and – most importantly of all – there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not  " a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives " . < ref name=S/ > < sup > p128 < /sup >  On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as  " meaningless but phonologically structured human utterance, believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead " . < ref name=S/ > < sup > p2 < /sup >
