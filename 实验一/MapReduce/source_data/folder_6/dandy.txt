He [[wikt:exaggerate|exaggerate]]s his manners, including the way he stands and moves, and the way he speaks. He promotes himself. This is called '''dandyism'''.

 Dandies in the 18th and 19th centuries in the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] were often men from middle-class backgrounds who were trying to become people from high society. 
 
 The model, or [[archetype]], of a dandy was [[Beau Brummell]] from the [[Regent|Regency period]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]th. He was a friend of the then [[Prince of Wales]]. [[Lord Byron]] is also an example. The writer [[Oscar Wilde]] is another, later example. Less extreme versions were the American artist who lived in London, [[James McNeill Whistler]], and the French [[composer]] [[Maurice Ravel]]. ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' is a famous example from literature. 
 
 Today, in the 21st century, the word ''dandy'' is often used as a joke word to mean  " fine "  or  " great " .
