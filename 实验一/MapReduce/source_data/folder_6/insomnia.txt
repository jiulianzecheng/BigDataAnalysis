'''Insomnia''' is when people cannot [[sleep]] for long or short periods. A person with this problem is called an ''insomniac''. Insomnia can mean a problem with getting to sleep or a problem with staying asleep. Insomnia is a [[symptom]] and not a disease or illness. < ref > {{cite book| last1 = Yudofsky| first1 = Stuart C.| last2 = Hales| first2 = Robert E.| title = Essentials of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XKhu7yb3QtsC & pg=PA315| date = 2004| publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing.| isbn = 978-1-58562-005-0| page = 322 | quote = ...insomnia is a symptom.

 == Different kinds of insomnia == 
 There are at least three different types of insomnia: 
 # ''Transient'' Insomnia: this lasts from one night to a few weeks. 
 # ''Acute'' Insomnia: lasts from a few weeks to about six months. 
 # ''Chronic'' Insomnia: lasts for years at a time. 
 
 == Causes == 
 There are many causes of insomnia. Some of them are: 
 * As people get older, their sleep patterns change. They will sleep shorter periods of time, but more often. Younger people usually sleep longer. This is normal. 
 * Some insomnia issues are caused by [[stimulant]] [[drug]]s, such as [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] and [[nicotine]]. [[Coffee]] stimulates the body, and people tend to drink quite a lot of it when they are at [[Employment|work]]. If they drink too much of it, they will have problems falling asleep in the evening. (The same is true for [[tea]], [[cola]]s, or any other drink with [[caffeine]] in it.) 
 * Some people worry a lot. Their worries during the day will bother them at night. They might have [[nightmare]]s, or they may wake up [[sweat]]ing. 
 * Some substances, like [[alcohol]] can have a bad effect. It can be very hard to sleep after drinking a lot of alcohol. The world may spin and there can be an urge to [[vomit]] as soon the person closes their eyes. Drugs can also have this effect, even some  " sleeping "  pills. 
 * A very rare disease called [[fatal familial insomnia]] prevents some people from falling asleep. In this disease, a person can no longer sleep and after a while will die from being so tired. It is caused by a [[protein]] similar to the one that causes [[mad cow disease]] which is a very bad disease that comes from eating [[infection|infected]] meat. 
 * People with disorders of their [[circadian rhythm]]s often have trouble sleeping at normal times. 
 * Insomnia is a common symptom of some [[mental disorder]]s: [[bipolar disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[dementia]] and [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]]. 
 
 == Treatments== 
 There are [[drug]]s available that can help treat the different kinds of insomnia. In some cases, there are also certain [[herb]]s that can help. A third way that seems to help is a type of [[therapy]] that aims at changing the behaviour of those affected.
