 '''Yiddish''' is a [[language]] used by some [[Jew]]s. At first, it was a [[dialect]] of [[German language|German]]  that Jews began to use in [[Europe]] about 1000 years ago. It was and still is used in the [[United States]], especially in [[New York City]], and other countries that now have Jews. 
 
 Most Yiddish words come from German, but many words are also from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Slavic languages]], especially [[Polish language|Polish]], and some from [[French language|French]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Latin]]. Yiddish is written usually by the Hebrew alphabet. 
 
 In the world, Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people, mainly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]].
