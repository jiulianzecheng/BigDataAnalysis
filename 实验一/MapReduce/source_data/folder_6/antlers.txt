 '''Antlers''' are usually large, branching structures, made of [[bone]], which grow on the heads of [[deer]] and similar animals. 
 
 With deer, only males have antlers. Only [[reindeer]] (caribou) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. 
 
 == Growth of antlers == 
 While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly [[Blood vessel|vascular]] [[skin]] called velvet, which supplies [[oxygen]] and [[nutrient]]s to the growing [[bone]]. < ref name=Hall > {{citation | last = Hall | first = Brian K. | year = 2005 | title = Bones and cartilage: developmental and evolutionary skeletal biology | publisher = Academic Press | chapter = Antlers | pages = 103–114 | isbn = 0-12-31906-06 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y-RWPGDONlIC & pg=PA103 | access-date = 2010-11-08}} < /ref >    
 
 Antlers are one of the most striking cases of male [[secondary sex characteristic]]s in the animal kingdom. < ref name= " Malo " > Malo A.F. ''et al.'' 2005. Antlers honestly advertise sperm production and quality. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B'' '''272''':149–157. < /ref >  They grow faster than any other mammal bones. < ref name=W & H > {{citation | last1 = Whitaker | first1 = John O. | last2 = Hamilton | first2 = William J., Jr. | year = 1998 | title = Mammals of the Eastern United States | publisher = Cornell University Press | page = 517 | isbn = 0-8014-3475-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5fVymWAez-YC & pg=PA517 | access-date = 2010-11-08}} < /ref >   Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially [[cartilage]], which is [[mineral]]ized to become [[bone]]. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. The antlers fall off at some point. < ref name=Hall/ >   
 
 To re-grow antlers each year uses up nutrition, so they are honest [[signal]]s of food gathering capability. < ref name= " Ditchkoff " > Ditchkoff S.S. ''et al.'' 2001.

 ==Sexual selection== 
 The principle means of evolution of antlers is [[sexual selection]], which operates by two mechanisms: Male–male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. < ref name= " Malo " / >   
 
 Male–male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates; second, they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility. < ref name= " Malo " / >  Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve fertilization success. < ref name= " Malo " / > < ref name= " Gilbert " > Gilbert C; A. Ropiquet  &  A. Hassanin. 2006. Mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies of Cervidae (Mammalia, Ruminantia): systematics, morphology, and biogeography.
