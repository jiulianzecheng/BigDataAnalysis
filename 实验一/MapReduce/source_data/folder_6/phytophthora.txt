 '''''Phytophthora''''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Lang|el|φυτόν}} (''phytón''),  " plant "  and {{Lang|el|φθορά}} ({{transl|el|phthorá}}); means  " the plant-destroyer " . It is a [[genus]] of plant-damaging [[oomycete]]s (water molds).  
 
 They can cause enormous economic losses on crops, and damage in natural [[ecosystem]]s. The cell wall of ''Phytophthora'' is made of [[cellulose]]. The genus was first described by [[Anton de Bary|Heinrich Anton de Bary]] in 1875.  About 170 species have been described, though there are many more undescribed. < ref > Brasier  CM, 2009.
