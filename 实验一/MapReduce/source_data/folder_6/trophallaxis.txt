 '''Trophallaxis''' in [[biology]] refers the sharing of [[food]] by members of a [[community]].  
 
 It is most highly developed in social [[insect]]s such as [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s, [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s. The word was introduced by the [[entomology|entomologist]] William Morton Wheeler in 1918. < ref > Wheeler W.M. 1918. A study of some ant larvae with a consideration of the origin and meaning of social habits among insects. ''Proc. Am. Phil. Soc''., '''57''', 293-343. < /ref >  The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects. < ref > Roubaud E. 1916.

''Ann Sci Nat'' '''1''':1-160 < /ref >  The French [[psychologist]] and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society. He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book ''The social world of the ants compared with that of man''. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=Journal of History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pages=133â€“156|year=2002|doi=10.1002/jhbs.10033|

 Trophallaxis serves as a means of [[communication]], at least in bees and ants. In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the [[Colony (biology)|colony]] odour that identifies members. < ref > Dahbi A. Hefetz A. Cerda X. and Lenoir A. 1999. Trophallaxis mediates uniformity of colony odor in ''Cataglyphis iberica'' ants (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)
