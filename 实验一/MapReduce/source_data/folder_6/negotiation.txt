{{Alternative dispute resolution}} 
 A '''negotiation''' is a [[formal]] [[discussion]] to reach agreement about an issue. It is an important method to [[conflict resolution|reduce conflict]], and to get things done. Examples: 
 *Two [[wikt:hostile|hostile]] [[nation]]s both claim a piece of [[territory]]. They may go to [[war]] over it. Or, they may '''negotiate''' some [[agreement]] or [[peace treaty]]. The agreement would be written down, and both [[government]]s would agree to keep the agreement. 
 *A football club wishes to buy a player from another club. A series of negotiations would take place between the clubs, the player and the player's [[Sports agent|agent]]. If the negotiations succeed, the player gets moved. In this case, and in many others, success is followed by a [[legal]] [[contract]], or a [[court]] decision, which makes the agreement legal. 
 *In less formal circumstances, a negotiation is just [[wikt:bargaining|bargaining]] or [[wikt:haggle|haggling]] over, for example, money.
