 The '''Quagga''' (''Equus quagga quagga''), also '''Cape Quagga''',  is a recently [[extinct]] [[zebra]]. < ref name=rea > {{cite web |url=http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/quagga.htm |title=Recently Extinct Animals - Species Info - Quagga |work=petermaas.nl |year=18 December 2008 |access-date=20 August 2011 |archive-date=21 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821145558/http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct/speciesinfo/quagga.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 It was one of the six [[subspecies]] of plains zebra. It was a yellowish-brown zebra with stripes only on its head, neck and forebody, and looks similar to an Okapi. < ref name=rea/ >  The Quagga was native to dry grassy plains in the south of the African continent. < ref name=rea/ >  It was found as far north as the [[Orange River]]. It is believed to have separated from other plains zebras between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago. < ref name=rea/ >  The name ''Quagga'' comes from the noise that they made. (kwa-ka-ka) (qua-ga-ga). 
 
 The Quagga was hunted for food, for their skin and also because farmers did not want it to eat the grass they needed for their sheep and goats. The last wild Quaggas died during a [[drought]] in 1878. < ref name=rea/ >  The last [[captive]] Quagga died in the [[Amsterdam]] Zoo on 12 August 1883. < ref name=rea/ >  Her body is now in a museum. There are 23 Quagga specimens in museums, seven skeletons, and some skulls and other bones. < ref name=rea/ > 
 
 A foundation in Africa is trying to bring Quaggas back to life by taking zebras that have very light stripes and breeding them. < ref name=rea/ >  They began in 1987 and the first Quagga foal was born in 2005. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.quaggaproject.org/ |title=The Quagga Project :: South Africa |work=quaggaproject.org |year=2010  |access-date=20 August 2011}} < /ref >
