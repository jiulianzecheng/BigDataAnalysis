 '''''Josephoartigasia''''' is an [[extinct]] [[genus]] of giant [[rodent]] from the [[Pliocene]]. It is related to the living [[pacarana]]. The genus includes the largest known rodent, ''Josephoartigasia monesi''. < ref name=Beeb2008 > {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7408743.stm|title=Biggest rodent 'shrinks in size'|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-05-21}} < /ref >   
 
 The two species would have looked like gigantic pacarana, or [[capybara]]s the size of cows. However, Dr Virginie Millien, from [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], said the mathematical models originally used to calculate the rodent's [[mass]] from its [[skull]] probably overestimated its body size. < ref name=Beeb2008/ > 
 
 A recent report said it had big front teeth, which it might have used for defence. < ref > Biggest rodent 'fought with teeth' like tusks. BBC News Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-31111843] < /ref >
