 The '''destrier''' is the best-known type of Warhorse of the [[Middle Ages|medieval era]]. It carried [[knight]]s in battles, tournaments, and [[Jousting|jousts]]. It was described by contemporary sources as the ''Great Horse'', due to its significance. 
 
 The word ''destrier'' comes from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''dextarius'', meaning  " right-sided "  (the same root as our modern ''dexterous'' and ''dexterity''). This may refer to it being led by the [[squire]] at the knight's right side (or led by the right hand) or to the horse's [[horse gait|gait]], (possibly leading with the right). < ref > Christopher Gravett, ''English Medieval Knight 1300-1400'' (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002), p 59 < /ref > 
 
 While highly prized by knights and [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], the destrier was not very common. < ref > Michael Prestwich, ''Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages: The English Experience''  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996), p 30 < /ref >  Most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode other war horses, such as [[Courser (horse)|coursers]] and [[rouncey]]s. < ref > Ewart Oakeshott, ''A Knight and his Horse'', Rev. 2nd Ed. (USA: Dufour Editions, 1998), pp 11-12 < /ref >   These three types of horse were often called '''chargers'''. 
 
 ==Characteristics of the destrier== 
 The word ''destrier'' does not refer to a breed, but to a ''type'' of horse: the finest and strongest warhorse. These horses were usually [[stallion]]s, bred and raised from colts specifically for the needs of war. The destrier was also considered the most suited to the [[joust]]; coursers seem to have been preferred for other forms of [[horses in warfare|warfare]]. < ref > Ewart Oakeshott, ''A Knight and his Horse'', Rev. 2nd Ed. (USA:Dufour Editions, 1998), p 11 < /ref >  They had powerful hindquarters, able to easily coil and spring to stop, spin, turn or sprint forward. They also had a short back and well-muscled loin, strong bone, and a well-arched neck. From medieval art, the head of the destrier appears to have had a straight or slightly [[wikt:convex|convex]] profile, strong, wide jaw, and good width between the eyes. 
 
 The destrier was specifically for use in [[Medieval warfare|battle]] or [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]]; for everyday riding, a knight would use a [[palfrey]], and his baggage would be carried on a [[sumpter horse]] (or [[packhorse]]), or possibly in wagons.
