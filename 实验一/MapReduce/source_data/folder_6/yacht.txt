 A '''yacht''' (pronounced  " yot " ) is a type of [[boat]] which is mainly used for recreation. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yacht|title=Definition of YACHT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}} < /ref >  It usually has a [[cabin]], so it does not need to return to the [[harbour]] overnight. Originally, yachts were [[sailing|sailing-boat]]s, but now there are also motor yachts. The name comes from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''jachtschip'', which originally meant ''hunting-boat'' or ''fast boat''. Yachts have a fixed [[boat keel|keel]].

 A yacht can vary in size from about 20 feet (6 metres) to 200 feet (60 metres) or more. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/luxury-yacht-advice/yacht-classification-definitions--587|title=Yacht classification definitions|last=Moretti|first=Paolo|date=January 21, 2015|website=Boat International|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}} < /ref > 
 
 Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}; the cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboat]]s, while referring to the general sport of sailing as yachting. In sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race.
