 '''Limestone''' is a [[Sedimentary rock]], made up mostly of the minerals [[calcite]] and aragonite, two forms of [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > . < ref >

 The calcium carbonate is originally produced by living organisms. Later, some of it goes into [[solution]] in sea water. Limestone rocks include mainly organic remains and rock. 
 
 Limestone is about 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.mine-engineer.com/mining/mineral/calcite.htm|work=mine-engineer.com | title=Calcite | accessdate=2008-02-13}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565838/Limestone_(mineral).html|title=Limestone (mineral)|accessdate=2008-02-13|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKbpb8j?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761565838/limestone_(mineral).html|archivedate=2009-10-31|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 == Formation == 
 Limestones are mostly made of [[calcium carbonate]]. It is originally made by small [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s like certain [[bacteria]], [[coccolithophore]]s, and [[algae]]. Then the carbonate gets used by various animals, like [[bivalve]]s and the [[polyp]]s which make [[coral reef]]s. They build their shells or framework out of CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub >  [[crystal]]s. < ref > Lapo 1986. ''Traces of bygone biospheres''. Synergetic Press: Oracle, AZ. < /ref >   
 : " [Coccolithophores] were the first organisms to bring about a steady rain of calcium carbonate from the upper, illuminated zone of the ocean towards the deep sea " . < ref name=Pete > Westbroek, Peter 1991. ''Life as a geological force: dynamics of the Earth''. Norton, New York. {{ISBN|0-393-30817-0}} < /ref > < sup > p144 < /sup > 
 
 Carbonates are rocks formed from these sources, plus any CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub >  which is [[precipitation|precipitated]] out of [[solution]]. Some carbonate dissolves in the water. It gets  precipitated when the physical condition of the water changes. For example, if the concentration of CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub >  is high, then a temperature drop, or a [[pH]] (acidity) change, can cause precipitation. 
 
 === Florida Bay === 
 [[Florida Bay]], the shallow [[lagoon]] behind the [[Florida Keys]], is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on the [[continental shelf]]. Of course, all the [[species]] were somewhat different then but, as an [[ecosystem]], it is similar. 
 
 Florida Bay has much of a type of [[flowering plant]] called [[sea grass]]. White, milky water full of calcium carbonate is also common. This is mainly formed by ''Melobesia'', a small [[red alga]] which lives on sea grass. < ref name=Pete/ > < sup > p151 < /sup >  Finally, the organisms produce huge amounts of [[slime]], which is a [[polysaccharide]]. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by [[microorganism]]s to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed. < ref name=Pete/ > < sup > p139 < /sup >  As a side-effect the slime limits the amount of carbonate which goes into solution. < ref name=Pete/ > < sup > p155 < /sup > 
 
 Florida Bay is a flat platform which has laid down a huge amount of carbonate rock.

 == Fossiliferous limestones == 
 Many limestones contain fossils, and some are made up almost entirely of skeletal material. [[Chalk]] is ~99% [[coccolith]]s; [[Solnhofen limestone]] is famous for its animal fossils; and there are many shelly limestones from different periods. Limestone is not found much before the [[Cambrian]] [[period (geology)|period]], because shelled animals had not yet evolved. < ref > [[Small shelly fossils]] occur in the latest [[Ediacaran]] for the first time. < /ref >

 == Marble == 
 {{main|Marble}} 
 When limestone is [[heat]]ed to a high temperature, and squeezed at the base of a [[mountain]], it recrystallizes into the [[metamorphic rock]] [[marble]]. Marbles are fairly [[dense]], relatively easy to cut, or be shaped into blocks, and some forms are white in colour. < ref > Learn Science intermediate, grades 5 to 6, by Mike Evans and Linda Ellis < /ref > 
 
 == Uses == 
 Limestone is hard enough to resist [[weathering]] but usually soft enough to be worked (cut and carved) by stonemasons. It is used for building material. Limestone, particularly [[Portland limestone]], became popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as [[church]]es, [[bank]]s and [[house]]s. However, [[acid rain]] does slowly erode limestone. 
 
 Limestone is used to make [[glass]] and [[cement]]. It is also used to make [[iron]] in a [[blast furnace]], to remove impurities from the iron [[ore]].
