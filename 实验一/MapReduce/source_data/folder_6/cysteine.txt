 '''Cysteine''' (abbreviated as '''Cys''' or '''C''') < ref > Nomenclature and symbolism for amino acids and peptides (IUPAC-IUB Recommendations 1983). ''Pure Appl. Chem''. '''56''' (5), 1984: 595–624. < /ref >  is an α-[[amino acid]]. It has the [[chemical formula]] HO < sub > 2 < /sub > CCH(NH < sub > 2 < /sub > )CH < sub > 2 < /sub > SH.  
 
 Cysteine is a semi-essential amino acid, which means that humans can make it. < ref name=microbial > {{cite web|title=The primary structure of proteins is the amino acid sequence|url=http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book & func=displayarticle & art_id=661|work=The Microbial World|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Bacteriology Department|access-date=16 September 2012|archive-date=25 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525095344/http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book & func=displayarticle & art_id=661|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The [[codon]]s UGU and UGC code for cysteine. The [[thiol]] side chain in cysteine often does [[enzyme]] reactions as a [[nucleophile]]. The thiol oxidises to give the [[disulfide bond|disulfide]] derivative [[cystine]], which is important in many [[protein]] structures. When used as a food additive, cysteine has the [[E & nbsp;number]] '''E920'''.
