In 1932 the editor Mario Nerbini decided to open a new weekly newspaper for kids, containing illustrated tales with [[Mickey Mouse]]. The first issue of ''Topolino'' was published on December 31, 1932: it contained Mickey's first Italian story drawn by [[Giove Toppi]]. In this story, Mickey Mouse was chased by an elephant. However, Nerbini had not correctly secured the publication rights, so when Emmanuel (Disney's representative in Italy) protested, Nerbini changed the title of the [[comic book]] with issue #3 into ''Topo Lino''(Mouse Lino), replacing Mickey Mouse with ''Topo Lino'', another mouse. When Nerbini bought the publication rights from Disney and [[King Features Syndicate]], he changed the title back to ''Topolino'' with issue #5. [[Floyd Gottfredson]]'s stories made their debut in ''Topolino'' #7 with a Sunday page featuring Mickey, his girlfriend [[Minnie Mouse]], and Mickey's nephews [[Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse]]. ''Topolino'' published mainly Mickey Mouse Sunday pages; the daily strips were published in the supplement to the newspaper.
