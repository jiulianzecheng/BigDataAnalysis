[[File:Philip V Coin silver, 8 Reales Mexico.jpg|thumb|250px|The eight real coin of Philip V of Spain ('Spanish dollar' or 'piece of eight')]] 
 
 The '''''peso''''' is the monetary unit of several countries in the [[Americas]] and the Philippines. Originating in [[Spain]], the word ''peso'' translates to  " weight "  and uses the peso sign ( " $ " ;  " ₱ "  in the [[Philippines]]). 
 
 The silver ''peso'' worth eight ''reales'' was also known in English as a Spanish [[dollar]] or  " piece of eight "  and was a widely used [[international trade]] coin from the 16th to 19th centuries. 
 
 In 1868, Spain discontinued the ''peso'' as its main [[currency]] and replaced it with the ''peseta''. However, both the ''peso'' and the ''peseta'' both continued to be legal currencies up until 2002 with the [[euro]].
