'''Cubit''' is the name for any one of many units of measure used by various ancient peoples and is among the first recorded units of [[length]]. 
 
 The cubit is based on measuring by comparing – especially [[rope]] and [[textiles]], but also for [[timber]] and [[stone]] – to one's [[forearm]] length. The Egyptian [[hieroglyph]] for the unit shows this symbol. It was used through [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the [[Middle Ages]] up to [[Modern world|early modern times]]. 
 
 The distance between [[thumb]] and another finger to the [[elbow]] on an average person is about 24 & nbsp;digits or 6 & nbsp;palms or 1½ feet (45.72 & nbsp;cm or 18 & nbsp;inches). This so-called  " natural cubit "  of 1½ feet is used in the [[Roman]] system of measures and in different Greek systems. 
 
 Over time, units similar in type to the cubit have measured: 
 * 6 & nbsp;palms  & nbsp;= & nbsp; 24 digits, i.e. ~45.0 & nbsp;cm or 18 & nbsp;inches (1.50 & nbsp;ft) 
 * 7 & nbsp;palms  & nbsp;= & nbsp; 28 digits, i.e. ~52.5 & nbsp;cm or 21 & nbsp;inches (1.75 & nbsp;ft) 
 * 8 & nbsp;palms  & nbsp;= & nbsp; 32 digits, i.e. ~60.0 & nbsp;cm or 24 & nbsp;inches (2.00 & nbsp;ft) 
 * 9 & nbsp;palms  & nbsp;= & nbsp; 36 digits, i.e. ~67.5 & nbsp;cm or 27 & nbsp;inches (2.25 & nbsp;ft) 
 
 From late antiquity, the Roman ''ulna'', a four-feet-cubit (about 120 & nbsp;cm) is also known. This is the measure from a man's hip to the fingers of the outstretched opposite arm. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Mark H.|date=30 January 2014|title=The Cubit: A History and Measurement Commentary (Review Article)|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/janthro/2014/489757/|journal=Journal of Anthropology|language=English|volume=2014 (2014)|issue=Article ID 489757|pages=11|accessdate=1 January 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 The English [[yard]] has a long legal history, but its origin is not known. The English [[ell]] is essentially a kind of great cubit of 15 & nbsp;palms, 114 & nbsp;cm, or 45 & nbsp;inches (3.75 & nbsp;ft).
