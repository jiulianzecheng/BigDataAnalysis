 '''Tools''' are things used to make [[task]]s easier. Tools have changed over time. The first tools were made in the [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]]. Throughout history, people have made many new and more complicated tools. 
 
 Some examples of tools that are often used today are the [[hammer]], the [[wrench]] (also called a spanner), [[saw]]s, [[shovel]], [[telephone]], and the [[computer]]. Very basic things like [[knife|knives]], [[pen]]s, and [[pencil]]s are also tools. The [[Club (weapon)|bludgeon]] (a stick or rock used as a [[weapon]] to smash things) was one of the first tools made by [[human]]s. The [[knife]] is also one of the first tools humans made.
