 '''Pteraspids''' were early [[agnatha]]n [[vertebrates]]. They lived from later [[Silurian]] to the end of the [[Devonian]]. Fossils are found in Europe and North America. 
 
 The whole group has the head and front of the body [[armour]]ed. Delicate, finger-like parts of the plates were at the edges of the mouth. This suggests they were [[filter feeder]]s taking [[plankton]] from the water column. < ref name=purnell > Purnell, Mark A. 2002.
