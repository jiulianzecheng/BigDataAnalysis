 '''Shortening''' is a [[semisolid]] [[fat]] used in [[baking]]. It makes foods [[wikt:crumbly|crumbly]]. Shortening doesn't smoke as easily as butter or oil, and it is 100% fat. Butter is 80% fat. It works by stopping long [[gluten]] [[polymer]]s from forming in the food. It does not need to be [[refrigeration|refrigerated]]. It also is cheaper than butter. It can make foods last longer.  
 
 Shortening is mostly made from [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] oils, which have [[trans fat]]s in them. Trans fats can cause [[heart attack]]s. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/929504737|title=Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients).|last=Macronutrients|first=Panel on|date=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|others=Subcommittees on Upper Reference Levels of Nutrients and Interpretation and Uses of Dietary Reference Intakes, Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes|isbn=978-0-309-65520-0|location=Washington|oclc=929504737}} < /ref >  People making shortening try to take out the trans fats.
