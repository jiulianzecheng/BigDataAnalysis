 == History == 
 === Pre-Columbian history === 
 When [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] arrived to America, some groups of [[Native American|native]] people, coming from northern [[South America]], had lived in the [[Caribbean]] Islands since a very long time. That movement from South America to the Caribbean islands was not continuous but it happened in several waves during almost twelve centuries. 
 
 [[Archeology|Archeological]] studies suggests that those people from South America came to the Caribbean islands during four [[period]]s. 
 
 The first period began around 5000 [[Anno Domini|B.C.]] For most Caribbean islands, this period ended around 2000 years ago except in [[Cuba]] and Hispaniola where there were some small populations in western Cuba and southwestern Hispaniola when the Europeans arrived to these islands. < ref > {{cite book

 The second group was the '''Igneri''', the first [[Taíno|Arawak]] [[Native American|Indians]] to come to the [[Caribbean]] Islands. They displaced the Ciboney people and, later, they were displaced by another group of Arawak Indians, the Taínos. '''Taínos''' occupied all the [[Greater Antilles]] (Cuba, [[Jamaica]], Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]) and they developed a culture different from the culture of the Arawaks of South America. They were the first people that the Spanish met in the Americas. 
 
 The fourth and last group was the '''Carib'''. The [[Carib]] were also Arawaks but with a different language. Even if they used to go to Puerto Rico and the Hispaniola to fight against the Taínos, they lived only in the [[Lesser Antilles]] when Columbus got to America. 
 
 At the moment when the Spanish came to the Hispaniola, most of the island was occupied by Taínos; only in the western tip of the Southern Peninsula (in modern [[Haiti]]), there were some small groups of Ciboney In the northeastern part of the island (Samaná Peninsula and north of the Northern mountain range), there was a group called '''Ciguayos''', and sometimes '''Macorix''', with the same culture of the Taínos but a different language. It seems that they were Carib that took the Taíno culture. < ref > {{cite book

 === Discovery, conquest and colony === 
 [[File:15thcenturyhispaniola.JPG|thumb|Early map of Hispaniola]] 
 [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived to the island on December 5, 1492, naming it as '''''La Española''''', meaning ''The Spanish Island''. When [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] wrote in [[latin]] about this island, he wrote ''Hispaniola'', meaning ''Small Spain''; that was not correct. Because the book of Anghiera was translated into English very soon, the name '''Hispaniola''' is the most used in English-speaking countries and in scientific works. 
 
 For centuries, other names were used for the island. The most common were ''Santo Domingo Island'' (the Dominican constitution still uses that name) and ''Haiti''. 
 
 Hispaniola was the only island that Columbus visited in all his four travels to the Americas. He saw the island for the first time on December 5, 1492 but he stayed on his ship during the night; the next day, he went to land. The [[Spain|Spaniards]] spent the rest of December traveling along the north coast of Haiti; on December 12, Columbus took possession of the island in the name of the King and Queen of Spain and named the island as  " La Española " . < ref > {{cite book

 On Christmas Eve, December 24, the main ship ( " Santa María " ) was badly damaged. The next day, Christmas Day, Columbus gave orders to use the wood of the ship to build a small fort on what is now Môle Saint-Nicolas, Haiti. That fort was named ''La Navidad'' ( " Navidad "  means [[Christmas]]) and was the first [[Europe]]an building on [[The Americas|American]] soil. Columbus left 39 men there because there was not space in the other two ships for all the people. 
 
 From  " La Navidad " , they traveled east along the north coast of the island and in [[Samaná Province|Samaná]] they had a small fight with some natives ( " Ciguayos " , not Taíno Indians) and named the bay as  " Golfo de las Flechas "  (Gulf of the Arrows), but now is called  " [[Samaná Bay]] " . From there, they went back to Spain. 
 
 In 1493, Columbus found, when he returned in his second trip, that  " La Navidad "  was destroyed by the Indians and all Spaniards killed. Then he went to the east, founding the first European city in the American continent, near the present city of [[Puerto Plata]]; he named the city  " La Isabela "  in honor of Queen [[Isabella of Castile]]. < ref > {{cite book

 Because La Isabela was an unhealthy site, [[Bartholomew Columbus]], brother of Christopher, established a new city, ''La Nueva Isabela'' (The New Isabela) on the south coast of the island, on the left side of the Ozama river. Because a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] destroyed the city, it was built again but on the right side of the river and with the new name of Santo Domingo. It is the oldest permanent European city in the Americas. 
 
 The Taíno population of the island decreased very fast because a combination of new diseases, like [[smallpox]], and abuses by the Spaniards. Even if some black slaves were brought from Spain since 1501, the colony began to import [[Slave trade|African slaves]] when the [[colony]] began to grow [[sugar cane]], around 1516, to produce [[sugar]]. < ref > {{cite book

 Spain kept conquering new regions of the Americas and, for the Spanish people, those new regions were more interesting because there was more gold; the population of the island grew very slowly. By the early 17th century, the island and its smaller neighbors (above all, the Tortuga island) became places often visited by Caribbean [[pirate]]s. In 1606, the king of Spain gave the order that all inhabitants of Hispaniola had to move close to the city of Santo Domingo, to avoid interaction with pirates and [[Protestant]] people. This resulted in [[France|French]], [[British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] pirates establishing bases on the abandoned north and west coasts of the island. 
 
 In 1665, the presence of French people on the island had the official approval of the French king Louis XIV and he named Bertrand d'Ogeron as the governor of the western part of Hispaniola (in French, Saint-Domingue). By the Treaty of Ryswick, Spain gave the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern part. The development of the French  " Saint-Domingue "  was very fast, both in wealth and population, and it became the richest colony in the Caribbean. The eastern, Spanish colony of  " Santo Domingo "  remained poor and with a very low population. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The island of Hispaniola has an area of {{cvt|76,480|km2 |sqmi}}. There are two countries: the Republic of [[Haiti]] is in the western part of the island and the [[Dominican Republic]] in the eastern part. These two countries are separated by an artificial border, except in the northern and southern extremes where they are separated by the rivers Dajabón and Pedernales, respectively.

 === Mountains and valleys === 
 The Hispaniola is an island with many [[mountain]]s, and the highest peaks of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] are here. The chains of mountains show a [[direction]] [[northwest]]-[[southeast]], except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction [[west]]-[[east]]. The mountains are separated by [[valley]]s with the same general direction. 
 
 From north to south, the mountain ranges and valleys are: < ref > {{cite book

 * [[Cordillera Septentrional]] (in English,  " Northern Range " ). It is a Dominican chain, with extensions to the northwest, the Tortuga Island, and to the southeast, the Samaná Peninsula (with its ''Sierra de Samaná''). Its highest mountain is Diego de Ocampo, close to Santiago, with 1,249 [[Metre|m]]. 
 * The ''[[Plain]]e du Nord'' (Haiti) and Cibao Valley (Dominican Republic) is the largest, and perhaps the most important, valley of the island. This long valley stretches from North Haiti to Samaná Bay. 
 * The ''Massif du Nord'' (Haiti, with the ''Gros Morne'', 1.198 m) and ''Cordillera Central'' (Dominican Republic, also called ''Sierra de Cibao'') with the highest mountains of the West Indies: Duarte [[Peak]], 3,087 m, and others above 3,000 m. Near the center of the island, this range divides itself in two branches: ''Cordillera Oriental'' or ''Sierra del Seibo'', separated from the main chain by a depression and with a west-east direction, and a second branch with a [[north]]-[[south]] direction called ''Sierra de Ocoa''. 
 * The ''Plateau Central'' (Haiti), San Juan Valley and [[Plain]] of Azua (Dominican Republic), are big valleys with [[elevation]] from 0 to 600 m. 
 * The ''Bombardopolis Plateau'' (640 m), ''Montagnes de Terre Neuve'' (1,100 m, ''Morne Goreille''), ''Montagnes Noires'' (1,700 m, ''Pic Bonhomme''). All this chains are in Haiti and form one group of mountains. 
 * Artibonite Plain and Valley, in Haiti, between those mountains mentioned above and below. 
 * ''Chaîne des Matheux'' (''Morne Delpech'', 1,600 m) and the ''Montagnes du Trou d'Eau'' (''Morne Ma Pipe'', 1,510 m) form one group that get together with the previous group of mountains to form, in the Dominican Republic, the ''Sierra de Neiba'', with Mount Neiba the highest mountain with 2,279 m. An extension to the southeast of ''Sierra de Neiba'' is the ''Sierra Martín García'' (''Loma Busú'', 1,350 m). 
 * The ''Cul-de-Sac'' (Haiti) or ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' (Dominican Republic), is a remarkable valley, with a west-east direction, of low [[elevation]] (on average 50 m with some points below sea level) and with two great salt lakes: ''Êtang Saumatre'', in Haiti, and Enriquillo Lake, in the Dominican Republic. 
 * ''Massif de la Hotte'' (''Pic Macaya'', 2,405 m) and ''Massif de la Selle'' (''Pic'' or ''Morne La Selle'', 2,680 m, the highest Haitian mountain) are in the Southern Peninsula. The ''Massif de la Selle'' is called ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' in the Dominican Republic. The Gonâve Island (''Morne La Pierre'', 776 m) belongs, in [[Geology|geological]] terms, to the ''Massif de la Selle''. This southern group of mountains have a [[geology]] very different to the rest of the island. 
 * ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (in English,  " Caribbean Coastal Plain " ) is in the southeast of the island (and of the Dominican Republic). It is a large [[prairie]] east of [[Santo Domingo]]. 
 
 === Rivers and lakes ===

 The largest lake of the Hispaniola, and of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], is the ''[[Lake Enriquillo]]''. It is in the ''Hoya de Enriquillo'' with an area of 265 & nbsp;km². There are three small islands within the lake. It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a [[Salt water|saline]] lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water. 
 
 The second largest lake, ''[[Étang Saumâtre]]'' (also known as ''Lake Azuei''), is close to Lake Enriquillo but in Haiti, in the ''Cul-de-Sac''. It is also a [[Salt water|saline]] lake with an area of around 170 & nbsp;km². 
 
 Others lakes are ''Rincón'' ([[fresh water]], area of 28.2 & nbsp;km²), ''Oviedo'' ([[Salinity|brackish]] water, area of 28 & nbsp;km²), ''Redonda'' ''Limón'', ''Étang de Miragoâne''. 
 
 == Climate == 
 Hispaniola has a [[tropical climate]] but modified by [[elevation]] and the ''trade winds'' ([[wind]]s that come from the northeast, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]). At sea level, the [[average]] temperature is 25 & nbsp;°C, with small changes from one season to another. In the highest mountains, the temperature in [[winter]] can be as low as 0 & nbsp;°C. 
 
 There are two wet seasons: April-June and September-November. The most dry period is from December to March. 
 
 [[Rainfall]] varies greatly; eastern regions, like the Samaná Peninsula, get an average of over 2,000 & nbsp;mm in a year, but less than 500 & nbsp;mm fall in the southwest (Hoya de Enriquillo - Cul-de-Sac). 
 
 From June to November, [[hurricane]]s are frequent and can do much damage in the island.
