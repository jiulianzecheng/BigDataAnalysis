 '''Phototrophs''' (''photo'' = light, ''troph'' = nutrition) or '''photoautotrophs''' are [[organism]]s which carry out [[photosynthesis]].  
 
 With their [[plastid]]s and the help of [[energy]] from [[light|sunlight]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] are converted into [[sugar]] by [[photosynthesis]]. Sugar is then converted into other [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s which can be used in [[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[Function (biology)|function]]s. Such a function might be, for example, [[respiration]].
