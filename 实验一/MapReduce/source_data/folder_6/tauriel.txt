 In ''The Desolation of Smaug'', the hobbit [[Bilbo Baggins]], and thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], are traveling to [[Lonely Mountain]], and pass through the black forest of [[Mirkwood]], where they are captured by giant spiders. The spiders are then attacked by the [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]], led by [[Legolas]] and Tauriel. Tauriel saves [[Kíli]] by killing a spider that was attacking him, but the Elves take the dwarves as prisoners for trespassing on their land. During the dwarves' imprisonment, Tauriel forms a bond with Kíli. It is later mentioned that Tauriel is a talented warrior and for this reason, was made leader of the Mirkwood border guards. [[Legolas]], the son of Mirkwood's Elven king [[Thranduil]], is shown to be attracted to her, and she used to be attracted to him too, but because she is a lowly Silvan Elf, she does not believe herself worthy of him, and similarly, Thranduil does not consider her to be a proper match for his son. 
 
 As the dwarves escape with Bilbo's help, the Elves' home is attacked by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]]. Tauriel again uses her skills to save Kíli, but Kíli is struck in the leg with an orc's arrow. This arrow is poisoned, and the wound it created will slowly kill Kíli. Thranduil learns that an evil entity has returned and is amassing great power in the south, and seals off his kingdom, but before he does this, Tauriel goes after the dwarves by herself. Legolas follows, and tries to convince her to return, but when she refuses, saying that the Elves are part of Middle Earth and that they must fight in the upcoming war, Legolas joins her pursuit. 
 
 After getting weapons and supplies at Laketown, the dwarves leave for the Lonely Mountain, but leave Kíli behind because of his injury, and Fili, Bofur and Oin stay behind to be with him. By the time Tauriel and Legolas reach Laketown, the dwarves are being attacked by orcs. They defeat the invaders, and Tauriel uses her knowledge of herbs to heal Kíli's wound, saving his life once again, after which they admit that they have developed a bond with one another. 
 
 ==Creation and casting== 
 In 1937 [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] published the fantasy novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which is about a group of 15 people: a [[Hobbit]] named [[Bilbo Baggins]], a wizard named [[Gandalf]] and thirteen [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]]. This group goes searching for a treasure guarded by the dragon, [[Smaug]]. During the story, the group are captured by the [[Silvan Elves]]. During the [[List of Middle-earth wars and battles#Battle of Five Armies|Battle of Five Armies]] at the end of the story, the group of 15 travelers join with the Elves to fight an army of [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] and [[Warg#Tolkien's wargs|wargs]]. < ref > [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[David Wenzel]].

 As head of the Elven guard, Lilly says that Tauriel is  " slightly reckless and totally ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill. "  Lilly also says Tauriel is a [[nonconformist]] (someone who refuses to follow established customs), < ref name=EntertainmentWeekly/ >  and that because of her relative youth among Elves, she can be reckless in the decisions she makes, < ref name=io9 > Davis, Lauren (October 17, 2013).

However, when she was called back into production to shoot new scenes after it was decided to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that a love triangle would indeed be added to the story. < ref > Harp, Justin (December 18, 2013).

 To look like Tauriel in the films, she wore a red wig with knee-length hair, fake ears that are three times larger than the ones [[Orlando Bloom]] wore as Legolas (though Lilly felt that the long hair would take attention away from the ears). Instead of wearing the complex formal gowns that female Elf noblewomen were seen wearing in previous films, Tauriel wears Elven military garb, which is better-suited to her job as a border guard and soldier. < ref name=ComicConTranscript/ > < ref name=io9/ >  The is an expert in a variety of weapons, but she usually uses a bow and two daggers, < ref name=ComingSoon/ > < ref name=io9/ >  the same weapons Legolas uses. < ref name=AccessHollywood/ >  Lilly had a stunt coach help her film the action scenes. < ref name=AccessHollywood/ >  Although Lilly asked to do the character's wirework herself, because she had experience doing her own stunts on ''Lost'', that work was performed by a [[stunt double]]. < ref name=io9/ >  Lilly also had a language coach teacher her how to speak the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish language]]. < ref name=AccessHollywood/ > < ref name=io9/ >   
 
 Filming of Tauriel's scenes began in September 2011 in [[New Zealand]], < ref name=AccessHollywood/ >  and was expected to last a year. < ref name=HobbitNews/ >  Lilly said that she enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the set, and the familiar experience of filming with a cast of mostly men, which reminded her of working on ''Lost'' and ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. However, she said that the experience of having had her first baby in May 2011 made some parts of filming the fighting scenes harder than she expected, saying,  " Recovering from labor is like recovering from a full-body injury, and I didn't realize to what extent that was true until I started training for elf fighting. My hips don't move like they used to move, my back doesn't move like it used to move, my shoulders are sore every day. But it's fun. " < ref > Warner, Kara (October 3, 2011).
