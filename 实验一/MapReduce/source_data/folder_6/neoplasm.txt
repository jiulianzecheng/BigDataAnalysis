 A '''neoplasm''' is [[tissue (biological)|tissue]] that is growing where it should not be. If they become a mass, they become a '''tumour'''. Tumours are either [[malignant]] (harmful) or [[benign]] (safe).  [[Cancer]], for example is malignant and sometimes [[Metastasis|spreads to other places]] on the body. Some tumours have a cause that makes them grow. For some tumours no cause is known. < ref name= " ReferenceA " > {{cite journal | authors = Birbrair A, Zhang T, Wang ZM, Messi ML, Olson JD, Mintz A, Delbono O | title = Type-2 pericytes participate in normal and tumoral angiogenesis | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

 Tumours can occur in humans and animals. In humans, tumors can occur because the genetic code of cells is modified too much, causing affected cells to divide and expand uncontrollably. < ref > {{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030419-033413|doi-access=free|title=Investigating Tumor Heterogeneity in Mouse Models|year=2020|last1=Tammela|first1=Tuomas|last2=Sage|first2=Julien|journal=Annual Review of Cancer Biology|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99â€“119|pmid=34164589|pmc=8218894}} < /ref >  The [[Tasmanian Devil]]s in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]] are in danger of becoming [[extinct]] because of a malignant tumour that grows on their face. < ref name= " facial tumours " > [http://www.dpiw.tas.gov.au/inter.nsf/WebPages/LBUN-5QF86G?open/ Department of Primary Industry and Water.]{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease < /ref >
