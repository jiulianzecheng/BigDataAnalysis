 [[File:Klimt Mulher sentada.jpg|thumb|This is how [[Gustav Klimt]] saw masturbation. This drawing is from 1913]]'''Masturbation''' is when a person touches their own [[sex organ]]s to gain pleasure. It often results in an [[orgasm]]. Although some religions say it is bad, the modern view is that it is a completely normal and healthy thing to do. Almost all boys and most girls masturbate, a U.S. nationally representative survey of 5865 men and women ages 14–94, 28% of men ages 70 + , 43% of men ages 14–15 and 60–69, and more than half of men ages 16–59 reported having engaged in solo masturbation in the prior month (Herbenick et al., 2010)., < ref > {{Cite web|last=Herbenick|first=Debby|date=Dec 27, 2022|title=Masturbation Prevalence, Frequency, Reasons, and Associations with Partnered Sex in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a U.S. Nationally Representative Survey|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9794105/|url-status=live|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}} < /ref >  starting in [[puberty]] if not earlier. Both teenage boys and girls masturbate daily on average for mid-teens according to one survey. Studies have shown that many people, including adults with sex partners, masturbate regularly. There are many slang words and expressions for masturbation. Among the most common, at least in the United States and Canada, are: '''jacking''', '''jacking off''' and '''jerking off'''. Those are usually just used for males and are definitely slang. A teenage boy might say,  " I've got to jack. "  Some words or expressions can be for anyone and are reasonably polite: '''playing with yourself''', '''touching yourself''', '''pleasuring yourself''', '''self pleasure''' and '''solo sex'''. Those expressions might be used on TV or radio talk shows. In comics, the words '''fap fap fap''' mean the person is masturbating (but it is not pictured, but rather implied ) 
 
 Masturbating may be done alone, but can also be done with another person. This is called  " mutual masturbation " . This is fairly common among pre-teen and early-teenaged boys regardless of [[sexual orientation]]. Usually, it is done out of curiosity so boys can educate themselves about whether their sexual responses are similar. Girls may also masturbate together, regardless of sexual orientation. Girls and boys who are starting a relationship, who are worried about pregnancy, or who are just curious about sex may begin with mutual masturbation. Two people can also masturbate together over the internet or with phones, although that is usually called '''cybersex''' or '''phone sex''' rather than mutual masturbation. That can be a good way for two people who are in love but are far away from each other to keep their romantic relationship alive. It can also be a way for people who have not met in person to build a relationship. Even for two people who do not plan to have a romantic relationship with each other, it can be much more fun to masturbate with someone else than to masturbate alone. 
 
 Group masturbation (most commonly done by pre-teen or teenage boys) is called a circle jerk. It used to be considered a normal and common thing for boys to do and not a problem. < ref name= " Murphy2001 " > {{cite book|author=Peter Francis Murphy|title=Studs, tools, and the family jewels: metaphors men live by|url=https://archive.org/details/studstoolsfamily0000murp|url-access=registration|access-date=20 February 2011|date=12 February 2001|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-17130-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/studstoolsfamily0000murp/page/66 66]–67}} < /ref >  Today, however, people worry that group masturbation among boys can involve [[bullying]] and can have lifelong negative consequences for some people. 
 
 [[Vibrator (sensual)|Vibrators]] and [[dildo]]s can be used to make masturbation easier or feel better, but it is often done with just a person's hand. 
 
 Animals can masturbate too. 
 
 == Female masturbation == 
 The female sex organ most sensitive to touch is the [[clitoris]] which is like a very small [[human penis|penis]]. Female masturbation almost always involves stimulating the clitoris, either by hand or with a vibrator. For some women, the [[glans]] (or tip) of the clitoris is so sensitive that they do not enjoy touching it directly. < ref > {{cite book |last = Carroll |first = Janell L. |title = Discovery Series: Human Sexuality |edition = 1st |publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] |year = 2013 < !-- NOTE: Copyright date is 2013 inside of the book. -- >  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC |isbn = 978-1-111-84189-8 |access-date = 27 October 2015 |archive-date = 31 December 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131231143704/https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC |url-status = live }}  < !-- |access-date=2015-10-21 -- > 
 }} < /ref >  Instead, they touch the clitoral hood and move it as it touches the clitoris. The clitoral hood is made of thin skin like an eyelid and normally covers most or all of the clitoris. Many women also enjoy the feeling of fingers or a [[sex toy]] in the [[vagina]], but this is a secondary sensation that is not necessary for orgasm, and that rarely results in orgasm on its own. Some women find stimulation of the front vaginal wall particularly pleasurable. The anus is rich in nerve endings and is also sometimes stimulated during masturbation, as are the nipples. 
 [[File:Playing_(nude).jpg|thumb|Woman touching her pubic area]]  
 Masturbation is usually continued until orgasm. Some women may have problems reaching an orgasm, especially when they are young, and have little experience masturbating. 
 
 Some women experience  " multiple orgasms "  - several orgasms in a row without loss of arousal. It should be noted, however, that women who are not capable of multiple orgasms report as much orgasmic satisfaction as women who are multi-orgasmic. 
 
 == Male masturbation == 
 [[File:Crátera ática de columnas (M.A.N. 1999-99-65) 02.jpg|thumb|A [[Satyr]] masturbating, on Ancient Greek pottery. ]]  
 [[File:Pre cum 160717.jpg|thumb|Pre-cum (pre-ejaculate) is slowly released from the end of the penis when thinking about sex or looking at sexual images. This slippery liquid can be rubbed around with the fingers or hands.]] 
 Masturbation for males is the act of stimulating the [[penis]], usually by hand, to provide self-pleasure. For teens and adults, masturbation usually ends in what is called an [[ejaculation]] (the release of liquid called [[semen]] which contains [[sperm]] cells). This ejaculation is usually accompanied by a powerful, pleasurable feeling called an orgasm. Most boys start masturbating between the age of 10 and 15. It is not uncommon for younger boys to do so, even if they cannot ejaculate semen. Even male fetuses in the womb sometimes appear to play with their penis. 
 
 There are many ways in which a male can choose to masturbate. The most common of these techniques is using the hand. A man simply wraps his hand or two or three fingers around the shaft of his penis (in [[erection]]) and moves his hand up and down. < ref > [http://advancedmasturbation.com/01.html The Full Fist Grip - Masturbation Techniques] < /ref >  As the sensation increases in intensity, the rate of hand movement generally quickens until orgasm occurs. Orgasm is a feeling which usually results in semen being ejaculated from the penis. [[Circumcised]] males or males with dry skin often use a lubricant  when masturbating. A lubricant, usually called '''lube, or personal lubricant''', is a slippery liquid available at stores. It is often on the same shelf as [[condom]]s. If someone masturbates a lot without lube, sometimes the skin can become irritated (rough) from too much rubbing. Usually, if the person goes slowly, there is a natural lubricating liquid that drips out of the end of the penis. Books call this liquid '''pre-ejaculatory fluid''' or, more commonly, '''pre-ejaculate''' (pronounced with an  " at "  sound at the end, unlike the verb ejaculate, which has an  " ate "  sound at the end.) A more common name for this liquid is '''pre-cum.''' Depending on how much time you take, you may get up to 4 ml (slightly less than 1 U.S. teaspoon) of pre-ejaculate before ejaculation. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=KILLICK |first1=STEPHEN R. |last2=LEARY |first2=CHRISTINE |last3=TRUSSELL |first3=JAMES |last4=GUTHRIE |first4=KATHERINE A. |title=Sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid |pages=48–52 |doi=10.3109/14647273.2010.520798 |date=2011|pmc=3564677 }} < /ref >  [[File:Foreskin gliding action in masturbation.ogv|thumb|Uncircumcised males can slide the foreskin back and forth over the glans of the penis.]] Pre-ejaculate is clear and slightly sweet-tasting. It can be rubbed around for added stimulation. It dries very quickly. Lube stays slippery much longer. Soap and shampoo should not be used for masturbating. If they get in the penis, they can hurt. Also, they dry out the skin. If someone masturbates and ejaculates very quickly, they usually won't have pre-ejaculate first. Uncircumcised males often begin masturbating by moving the foreskin back and forth over the [[Glans penis|glans of the penis]] to get an erection. People may also rub and touch other sensitive areas of the body such as the [[scrotum]] (the bag or sac containing the [[testicles]].)  For most males, the smooth skin on the back of the scrotum is very pleasurable to touch. Due to the placement of the [[prostate]] gland, another method (though much more of a social [[taboo]]) involves inserting an object, like one's hand or a sex toy, into the anus to rub against the prostate. This causes a sensation of pleasure through the male's body and has been stated to cause orgasms more pleasurable than those caused by simply rubbing the shaft. < ref > [https://www.webmd.com/sex/prostate-orgasm-what-it-is Prostate Orgasm: What It Is] < /ref > 
 
 Other common methods of male masturbation include running water on the penis in the bathtub or shower and rubbing the penis and scrotum with a towel or bed sheets. Some males enjoy masturbating with a lubricated condom on. A man can put his penis into a sex toy that is like an artificial vagina. 
 
 == Group masturbation == 
 This is most commonly considered a thing group of pre-teen and teenaged boys do, but sometimes it might be done by groups of men, groups of girls, groups of women, or groups of people of different ages and include both men and women. In the case of boys or men, group masturbation is called a circle jerk. (Sometimes a circle jerk just means an unnecessary office meeting where nothing useful is done.) Group masturbation circle jerks may be less common for boys today than in the past because boys now have much more information about sex. They might think looking at other boys masturbating is not that interesting because information and pornography are on the internet. Also, [[sex education]] classes usually have some information about what is normal. In the past (maybe 30 to 70 years ago) circle jerks often happened at summer camps. Circle jerks were sometimes part of [[hazing]] at some schools for boys. Hazing means older students making new students do a lot of things they shouldn't or don't want to do. Today, camping leaders and older students are told they must not allow circle jerks. Circle jerks often were like games, with the  " winner "  being the boy able to [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] first, last, or farthest depending on the pre-established rules. < ref name= " Murphy2001 "  / > < ref name= " Mechling2004 " > {{cite book|author=Jay Mechling|title=On My Honor: Boy Scouts and the Making of American Youth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8aSN5GSxZIC & pg=PA292|access-date=20 February 2011|date=1 May 2004|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51705-6|page=292}} < /ref >  Usually each boy only touches his own penis, but sometimes each boy touches the penises of the boys on each side of him. Many boys today would think of that as a homosexual (gay) thing and would not want to do it. A circle jerk that involves oral sex is called a '''daisy chain''' and is a form of [[group sex]]. A circle jerk can serve as an introduction to sexual relations with other males, but the main reason or benefit for doing it is that young teenagers usually don't have the chance to have regular sexual activity with another person. < ref name= " Murphy2001 "  / >  In earlier years, many experts did not think circle jerks were bad, and some saw them as educational (educating boys that they were normal) and helpful in building self-confidence. Some of that may be true, but group masturbation may be a problem if some boys, often older boys, coerce (force) other boys to do it when they really don't want to. It is a very serious problem if men suggest that boys do it. This could have happened at some summer camps. Boys who were in circle jerks might develop problems later. Some men who have relationship difficulties or sexual problems as adults feel their problems are caused by group masturbation they did when they were pre-teens or teenagers. Experts have different opinions, but group masturbation is probably not a good thing for pre-teens and teens to do. Even if it is not a problem for most boys, it might be very bad for a few boys. Some boys who are unsure if they are gay or straight may find it very awkward. Sometimes boys with smaller penises are teased or bullied afterward. Also, there could be very bad problems if anyone takes pictures and shares them on phones or on the internet. If a boy or girl feels a strong need to see if what happens when they masturbate is  " normal " , it is probably better to do it with just one friend, in person, not with a phone or computer. That way they can see if what happens when they masturbate is similar without worrying about being bullied or about pictures being shared. 
 
 == Parental discussions and sextortion == 
 Some parents discuss masturbation with their children. Other parents don't. If a parent does discuss it, the parent should be careful not to embarrass the son or daughter. The main things to say are,  " Masturbation is normal, but do it in your bedroom with the door closed. "  The son or daughter should be told never to send nude pictures or videos to anyone, particularly people they have met online. It is a common scam (trick) for someone to pretend to be an internet girlfriend or boyfriend, and to ask teenagers (boys especially) for nudes (nude pictures.) Then the person will ask the teen to masturbate on cam (camera.) Later, the person says they will send the pictures or videos to all the teen's friends and family unless the teen sends money. This is called '''sextortion'''. < ref > {{cite web |title=Men, young boys increasingly targeted by sextortion scams, B.C. police warn - Vancouver Island Free Daily |url=https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/men-young-boys-increasingly-targeted-by-sextortion-scams-b-c-police-warn/ |website=www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com |accessdate=2 July 2023 |date=30 March 2023}} < /ref >  If the teenager sends money, the person demands even more money. 
 Beyond mentioning those things, parents usually don't need to say a lot except that they are always available to answer questions. 
 
 == Masturbation frequency, age, and sex == 
 {{complex|date=June 2012}} 
 
 If and how often people masturbate depends on many things. One of the things it depends on is [[hormone]] levels. Hormones cause [[sexual arousal]]. Other things that the frequency of masturbation depend on sexual habits. Sexual habits are sexual activities that people do because they are used to doing them. Other people of the same age or standing - called peers - can also influence this frequency. General health is another of the many factors. < ref > ''Physiology  &  Behavior,'' 2005 Oct 15; Vol. 86 (3), pp. 356-68. < /ref >  The general attitude towards masturbation is formed by culture. < ref > [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve & db=pubmed & dopt=Abstract & list_uids=7396686 & query_hl=21 & itool=pubmed_docsum E. Heiby and J. Becker examined the latter] < /ref >  Medical causes have also been associated with masturbation. < ref > " Bladder calculus presenting as excessive masturbation. "  ''Ceylon Med. J.'' 2006 Sept., 51(3):121-2. < /ref > < ref > " Excessive masturbation after epilepsy surgery. "  ''Epilepsy Behav.'' 2004 Feb., 5(1):133-6. < /ref > < ref > " Severe impulsiveness as the primary manifestation of multiple sclerosis in a young female. "  ''Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci.'' 2005 Dec., 59(6):739-42. < /ref > 
 
 " Forty-eight female college students were asked to complete a sexual attitudes questionnaire in which a frequency of masturbation scale was embedded. Twenty-four of the women (the experimental group) then individually viewed an explicit modeling film involving female masturbation. One month later, all subjects again completed the same questionnaire. Subjects in the experimental group also completed a questionnaire evaluating aspects of the film. Results indicated that the experimental group reported a significant increase in the average monthly frequency of masturbation, as compared to the control group. This same group, however, reported that the film had no effect on sexual attitudes or behavior. " 
 
 A 2004 survey by [[Toronto]] magazine [[NOW (magazine)|''NOW'']] was answered by an unspecified number of thousands. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/minisites/loveandsex/2004/s_survey_results.php |title=NOW's Love and Sex Guide 2004 |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-date=2005-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404011400/http://www.nowtoronto.com/minisites/loveandsex/2004/s_survey_results.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The results show that an overwhelming majority of the males — 81% — began masturbating between the ages of 12 and 15. Among females, the same figure was a more modest majority of 55%. (Note that surveys on sexual practices are prone to ''self-[[selection bias]]''.) It is not uncommon, however, to begin much earlier, and this is more frequent among females: 18% had begun by the time they turned 12, and 6% already by the time they turned 10. Being the main outlet of [[child sexuality]], masturbation has been observed in very young children. In the book ''Human Sexuality: Diversity in Contemporary America'', by Strong, Devault and Sayad, the authors point out,  " A baby boy may laugh in his crib while playing with his erect penis (although he does not ejaculate). Baby girls sometimes move their bodies rhythmically, almost violently, appearing to experience [[orgasm]]. " 
 
 A 2004 magazine survey in [[Canada]] found that 43% started masturbating when they were about 12–13 years old. < ref name=Now > {{cite journal|author=Alice Klein|title=Love  &  Sex Guide|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/minisites/loveandsex/2004/s_survey_results.php|journal=[[Now (magazine)|Now]]|year=2004|accessdate=2 May 2010|archive-date=4 April 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404011400/http://www.nowtoronto.com/minisites/loveandsex/2004/s_survey_results.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  When boys start masturbating, wet dreams often stop since semen is taken out from his body regularly. 
 According to a Canadian survey of ''Now'' magazine readers, (cited above), the frequency of masturbation declines after the age of 17. However, most males masturbate daily, or even more frequently, well into their 20s and sometimes far beyond. This decline is more drastic among females, and more gradual among males. While females aged 13–17 masturbated almost once a day on average (and almost as often as their male peers), adult women only masturbated 8–9 times a month, compared to the 18–22 among men. It is also apparent that masturbation frequency declines with age. Adolescent youths report being able to masturbate to ejaculation six or more times per day, though some men in older middle age report being hard pressed to ejaculate even once per day.  The survey does not give a full demographic breakdown of respondents, however, and the sexual history of respondents to this poll, who are readers of an urban Toronto lifestyle magazine, may not extend to the general population. 
 
 It appears that females are less likely to masturbate while in a [[heterosexual]] relationship than men. Both sexes occasionally engage in this activity, however, even when in sexually active relationships.  Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse as well as the number of sex partners. One study reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship. < ref > Sexual practices in youth: analysis of lifetime sexual trajectory and last sexual intercourse.

 ==Cultural views and practices== 
 The [[Catholic church]] says masturbation is a 'gravely disordered action'. < ref > [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] paragraph 2352 < /ref >  Among men masturbation may be seen as a sign of weakness. There are [[slang]] terms for it that are used as insults.[http://www.internetslang.com/WANKER-meaning-definition.asp] 
 
 The [[Sambia]] tribe of [[New Guinea]] has rites of passage surrounding manhood. They include frequent ejaculation by [[fellatio]]. Semen is valued. Masturbation is seen as a waste of semen. Because of this, it is frowned upon but frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is nurtured for years. This is done from an early age through fellatio. This allows the semen to be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength. It is considered in the same line as mothers' milk. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.masturbationfreedom.com/the-practice-of-masturbation-among-the-sambia-tribe-of-new-guinea/|title=The Practice of Masturbation Among the Sambia Tribe of New Guinea|accessdate=November 7, 2014|archive-date=September 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929104321/http://www.masturbationfreedom.com/the-practice-of-masturbation-among-the-sambia-tribe-of-new-guinea/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > {{Better source needed|date=December 2022}} 
 
 Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that end in the first ejaculation of a male. This is often by the hands of a tribal elder.  In some tribes such as the [[Agta]] in the [[Philippines]], stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age. < ref > Cited by Hewlett, B. S. (1996) Diverse contexts of human infancy, in Ember, C.  &  Ember, M. (Eds.) Cross-Cultural Research for Social Science. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall < /ref >   At puberty, the young male is then paired off with a  " wise elder "  or  " witch doctor " . This person uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony ends in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children.  In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate than penis size.  Frequent ejaculation through masturbation from an early age fosters frequent ejaculation well into adulthood. < ref > The clinical outcome of childhood masturbation.

 Masturbation marathons have occurred in the U.S. and UK. These events provide a supportive environment where masturbation can be performed openly. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.masturbate-a-thon.com/ |title=Masturbate-a-thon by The Center For Sex  &  Culture |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-date=2009-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605055222/http://www.masturbate-a-thon.com/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/masturbation-marathon-london_index.html viewlondon.co.uk article on Masturbation Marathon London] < /ref > 
 
 == Function == 
 Masturbation may increase [[fertility]] during [[sexual intercourse]]. In females, it can regulate the conditions of the [[vagina]], [[cervix]] and the [[uterus]]. This can either increase or decrease the chance of [[fertilization|conception]]. Whether the chance is increased or decreased depends on the timing of the masturbation. This timing is a subconscious decision. If she has intercourse with more than one male, it favors the chances of one or the other male's sperm reaching her egg. < ref > {{cite book| last = Baker| first = Robin| title = Sperm wars: the science of sex| url = https://archive.org/details/spermwarsscience0000bake_k4t8| publisher = Diane Books| date=1996| isbn = 978-0-7881-6004-2}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal| last = Baker| first = Robin R.| author2 = Bellis, Mark A.| year = 1993| title = Human sperm competition: ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm| journal = Animal Behaviour| volume = 46| issue = 5| pages = 887, 23| doi = 10.1006/anbe.1993.1272| s2cid = 53165064| url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=3768816| access-date = 2007-07-16| archive-date = 2007-10-11| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011164305/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=3768816| url-status = dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Female masturbation can also protect against cervical [[infection]]s. It does this by increasing the acidity of the cervical [[mucus]] and by moving debris out of the cervix. 
 
 The function of masturbation in males is to flush out old sperm with low motility from the male's genital tract. The next ejaculate contains more fresh sperm, which has higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse. If more than one male is having intercourse with a female, the sperm with the highest motility will [[competition|compete]] more effectively. < ref > {{cite thesis| author = Thomsen, Ruth| title = Sperm competition and the function of masturbation in Japanese macaques| publisher = Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|year=2000| url = http://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/archive/00000105/| type = Text.PhDThesis}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal| last = Baker| first = Robin R.|author2=Bellis, Mark A.| year = 1993| title = Human sperm competition: Ejaculate adjustment by males and the function of masturbation.| journal = Animal Behaviour| volume = 46| issue = 5| pages = 861| doi = 10.1006/anbe.1993.1271| s2cid = 53201940| url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN & cpsidt=3768815}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal| last = Shackelford| first = Todd K.|author2=Goetz, Aaron T.| year = 2007| title = Adaptation to Sperm Competition in Humans.| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 16| issue = 1| pages = 47–50| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00473.x| s2cid = 6179167| url = http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00473.x}} < /ref >

 It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve [[clinical depression|depression]], stress and lead to a higher sense of [[Self-esteem|self-worth]]. Some people who don't have other sexual activity find they get sad or irritable (easy to get angry) if they go for several days without masturbating. Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other — in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship. < ref name= " badgerherald.com " / > 
 
 [[Mutual masturbation]], the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the map to their pleasure centers. Witnessing a partner masturbate is an educational activity to find out the method a partner uses to please themself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. < ref name= " badgerherald.com " / > 
 
 In 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of [[The Cancer Council Australia]] concluded that frequent masturbation by males appears to help prevent the development of [[prostate cancer]]. < ref > [http://doi.org/10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04319.x Sexual factors and prostate cancer] < /ref > 
 
 A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity. Excerpt:  " The association between frequency or orgasm and all-cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recoded as number of orgasms per year.  The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95) " .  That is, a difference between any two subjects appeared when one subject ejaculated at around two or more times per week than the other.  Assuming a broad range average of between 3-5 ejaculations per week for a healthy male, this would mean 5-7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with an article on the benefits against prostate cancer. < ref > {{Citation

 Masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Support for such a view, and for making it part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders]] during the Clinton administration.  A 2011 study from the Indiana University supports the assertion.  After taking age and partner status into account, the study showed that sexually active boys who masturbated regularly were eight times more likely to have used a condom during their last intercourse than other boys. < ref > {{cite journal

 === Blood pressure === 
 A small study has shown that a test group which only had intercourse experienced, as a whole, lower blood pressure in stressful situations than those who had intercourse but also had masturbated for one or more days. < ref > Brody, Stuart.   " Blood pressure reactivity to stress is better for people who recently had penile-vaginal intercourse than for people who had other or no sexual activity. "  ''Biological Psychology'', Volume 71, Issue 2, February 2006, pages 214-222. < /ref > 
 
 === Insertion === 
 Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and should not be able to scratch or break. Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus — any object used should have a flared or flanged base; otherwise, medical help may be needed to get it out. Modern [[dildo]]s and [[Butt plug|anal plugs]] are designed with this feature. 
 
 === Pregnancy === 
 Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see ''[[Non-penetrative sex#Mutual masturbation|mutual masturbation]]'') can result in pregnancy only if [[semen]] contacts the [[vulva]]. Masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids.

 Lawrence I. Sank < ref > Lawrence I. Sank.  " Traumatic Masturbatory Syndrome. "  Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy 24(1): 37-42 (1998). < /ref >  observed that masturbating prone (lying face downward) could be responsible for sexual problems in some men, including anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as observed in four men he examined. He coined the term ''traumatic masturbatory syndrome'' to describe this theory. As of 2007, no follow-up research has been conducted and the idea is not familiar or widely held within the medical community.  Some sources, however, give credence to the idea. One sex therapist < ref > Eva Margolies. Undressing the American Male: Men with Sexual Problems and What Women Can Do to Help Them.

 There is some discussion between professionals and other interested parties as to the existence or validity of [[sexual addiction]]s. Nevertheless, there are lists of warning signs such as when sexual activity affects a person's ability to function in everyday life, or is placing them at risk, for example, of pursuing illegal or destructive activities.  Very frequent and compulsive masturbation may be seen as a sign of sexual addiction. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/probs_sexaddiction.shtml |title=BBC Relationships: Addicted to sex |access-date=2007-07-16 |archive-date=2009-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213024556/http://www.bbc.co.uk/relationships/sex_and_sexual_health/probs_sexaddiction.shtml |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Philosophical views== 
 [[Immanuel Kant]] considered masturbation a violation of one's duty to one's self and an unnatural act, stating it was against [[natural law]]. < ref > Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, Second part, §7 < /ref >  [[Sigmund Freud]] regarded masturbation as unhealthy. < ref > Freud, Sigmund auth., Elizabeth Young-Bruehl ed. on women: A Reader pages 182-189 1990 WW Norton < /ref >  Margaret Sanger frequently stated that masturbation was unwise.
