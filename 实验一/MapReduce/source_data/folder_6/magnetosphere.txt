 A '''magnetosphere''' is a region around an astronomical object, such as a [[planet]]. It is the region where [[charged particle]]s are  affected by the object's [[magnetic field]]. < ref name= " NASA " > {{cite web

 Since a magnetosphere is magnetic, it is invisible. However, the Earth's magnetosphere makes the [[Aurora]] Borealis. This is what causes the  " Northern Lights "  that shimmer in the night sky near the [[North Pole]]. 
 
 The border between magnetospheres is called a magnetopause. < br / >
