 The '''mast''' of a sailing [[ship]] is a tall vertical pole which supports the [[sail]]s. Larger [[ship]]s have several masts, with the size depending on the style of ship. 
 
 Until the [[20th century]], a ship's masts would be wooden [[spar]]s, originally constructed from a single straight [[tree|tree trunk]]. As ship sizes increased, taller masts were constructed by lashing up to three spars together.
