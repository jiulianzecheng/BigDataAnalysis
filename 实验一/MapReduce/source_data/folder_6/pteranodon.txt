 '''''Pteranodon''''' was a large [[pterosaur]] from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period. About 1200 partial skeletons have been found, more than any other pterosaur. It lived in the area of the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. < ref > Bennett S.C. 2000. Inferring stratigraphic position of fossil vertebrates from the Niobrara Chalk of western Kansas. Current Research in Earth Sciences: ''Kansas Geological Survey Bulletin'', '''244''' (Part 1): 26 pp. < /ref > < ref name=bennett1994niobrara > >  Bennett S.C. 1994.

 [[Fossil]] ''Pteranodon'' have been found in [[Kansas]], [[Alabama]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[South Dakota]]. 
 
 ==Appearance== 
 With its [[wing]]s open it was up to 7 [[metre|meters]] across. < ref name=bennett1994niobrara/ >  ''Pteranodon'' might have lived much like an [[albatross]], spending a lot of time over the ocean, looking for fish. It had no [[teeth]] in its long [[mouth]], and it had a small [[pouch]] like a [[pelican]] at the back of its [[jaw]]. ''Pteranodon'' had a big crest at the back of its [[head]]. ''Pteranodon longiceps'' had a straight crest that went backwards, and ''Pteranodon sternbergi'' had a bigger, flatter crest that went upward. 
 
 ==Life style== 
 ''Pteranodon'' lived mainly on offshore [[rookery|rookeries]]. Most ''Pteranodon'' fossils are found where, at the time, they were hundreds of kilometres from the coastline. 
 
 They certainly fed on fish. Fossilized fish bones have been found in the [[stomach]] area of one ''Pteranodon''. Other specimens have fragments of fish scales and [[vertebrae]] near the [[torso]]. < ref >  Bennett S.C. 1994.

''Occasional Papers of the Natural History Museum'', University of Kansas '''169''': 1–70. < /ref > 
 
 Females of both species were smaller than the males, and had small, rounded crests. The crests were probably used in [[display (zoology)|display]], though they may have had other functions as well. < ref > Bennett S.C. 1992.
