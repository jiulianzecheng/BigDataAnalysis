 A '''ribozyme''' ('''ribo'''nucleic acid en'''zyme''') is an [[RNA]] molecule that can help certain [[biochemical]] reactions. similar to the action of protein [[enzymes]].  
 
 Also called ''catalytic RNA'', ribozymes  work in the [[ribosome]] to link [[amino acid]]s during [[Translation (genetics)|protein synthesis]]. They also take part in [[RNA splicing]], [[viral]] [[replication]], and [[transfer RNA]] biosynthesis.  
 
 The 1981 discovery of ribozymes showed RNA can be both genetic material (like [[DNA]]) and a biological [[catalysis|catalyst]] (like enzymes). This led to the [[RNA world hypothesis]], in which RNA acts in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems.  
 
 Investigators studying the [[origin of life]] have produced ribozymes in the [[laboratory]] that can catalyze their own [[synthesis]] under certain conditions, such as an [[RNA polymerase]] ribozyme. < ref name= " pmid11358999 " > {{cite journal | author = Johnston W.K.

 Some ribozymes may play an important role as [[therapeutic]] agents, as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as [[biosensor]]s, and for applications in [[genomics]] and gene discovery. < ref name= " Hean " > {{cite book | author =  Hean J.  &  Weinberg M.S. 2008 | editor = Morris KL | title = RNA and the regulation of gene expression: a hidden layer of complexity  | publisher = Caister Academic Press | location = Norfolk | isbn = 978-1-904455-25-7 | chapter=The hammerhead ribozyme revisited: new biological insights for the development of therapeutic agents and for reverse genomics applications | year = 2008 | chapter-url = http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 In 1967, [[Carl Woese]], [[Francis Crick]], and [[Leslie Orgel]] suggested that RNA could act as a catalyst. It was discovered that RNA can form complex [[Protein structure#Secondary structure|secondary structures]]. < ref > Woese, Carl 1967. ''The genetic code''. New York: Harper and Row. < /ref > 
 
 The first ribozymes were discovered in the 1980s. In 1989, [[Thomas Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their  " discovery of catalytic properties of RNA " . < ref > [http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1989/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989] was awarded to [[Thomas R.
