'''Ringwoodite''' is a [[mineral]]. It is a type of [[olivine]] which is formed at high temperatures and pressures in the [[Earth's mantle]] between 525 and 660 km deep. Olivine is a [[magnesium]] [[iron]] [[silicate]]. This mineral was first identified in a [[meteorite]] in 1969. < ref > Binns R.A. ''et al'' 1969. Ringwoodite, natural (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 Spinel group in the Tenham meteorite. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''221''', 943-944. < /ref >  It may be present in large quantity in the Earth’s mantle. 
 
 Ringwoodite is notable because to contains [[hydroxide]] ions (oxygen and hydrogen atoms bound together) in its structure. < ref name= " Ye-et-al-water " > Ye Y. ''et al'' 2012.
