A '''sarabande''' (spelt '''sarabanda''' in [[Italian language|Italian]]), is a [[dance]] that was popular in [[Baroque music]] in the [[17th century|17th]] and early [[18th century|18th centuries]]. 
 
 Composers of the Baroque period often composed a group of several dances.  This was called a [[suite (music)|suite]].  There was usually an [[Allemande]], a [[Courante]], a Sarabande and a [[Gigue]], in that order, and sometimes two Bourr√©es as well. 
 
 The sarabande was a slow, stately dance with 3 beats in a [[bar (music)|bar]] (3/4 time or Simple Triple). There was always a small stress (Tenuto) on the second beat of the bar. The note on the first beat would often be played quite short so that the second beat would feel heavy. Like the other dance movements in the suite, the Sarabande was in [[Binary form]]. 
 
 The sarabande seems to have come from [[Central America]] where it was known as  " zarabanda " .  Although it was mainly used in the Baroque Period, composers in the [[20th Century]] such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Erik Satie|Satie]], [[Herbert Howells|Howells]] and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] sometimes wrote Sarabandes. 
 
 Perhaps the most famous Sarabande is one written by an unknown composer. The piece is called ''La folie espagnole''. Many Baroque composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]] and [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]] and even some modern ones used this well-known tune. 
 
 == Movies == 
 The sarabande has been used a lot in [[movie]]s, including one by [[Ingmar Bergman]] called ''Saraband'' (2003). It uses the sarabande from the 5th suite for solo cello by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]].
