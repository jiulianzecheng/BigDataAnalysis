 A '''Spreadsheet''' is a [[computer program]] that imitates a paper [[worksheet]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=spreadsheet|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spreadsheet|access-date=23 June 2016|work=[[Merriam-Webster]] Online Dictionary}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|date=2011|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|edition=5th|quote=A software interface consisting of an interactive grid made up of cells in which data or formulas are entered for analysis or presentation.}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged|date=2014|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|edition=12th|quote=(Computer Science) a computer program that allows easy entry and manipulation of figures, equations, and text, used esp for financial planning and budgeting}} < /ref >  It shows a large sheet (like a sheet of paper) that has many cells in a grid of rows and columns. < ref > {{cite web|title=spreadsheet|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/spreadsheet|access-date=23 June 2016|publisher=[[TechTarget]]|department=WhatIs.com}} < /ref >  Users can put words or numbers into the cells, to make headings and store information (usually numbers). You can also move the grid lines around so that some cells are bigger than others, and change the color or size of text/font, the same way font/text is changed in a [[word processor]]. You can even put pictures in the worksheets, make multiple pages, and print out their results on real paper. < ref > {{cite web|title=spreadsheet|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/spreadsheet|access-date=23 June 2016|website=Dictionary.com Unabridged|publisher=Random House, Inc}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|last1=Beal|first1=Vangie|date=September 1996|title=spreadsheet|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/spreadsheet.html|access-date=23 June 2016|website=webopedia|publisher=[[QuinStreet]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Spreadsheet|url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/spreadsh.htm|access-date=23 June 2016|website=Computer Hope|archive-date=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621102503/http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/spreadsh.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The primary reason most people use spreadsheets is for automatic calculations. Spreadsheets can be designed to add up the items/amounts on a bill, calculate sales tax, and even calculate income tax. A user can add and subtract the numbers here, even if the numbers are not next to each other. This means the computer does all the math, and people only need to give the correct information. 
 
 Another strength of spreadsheets, is that they can produce diagrams, like graphs and pie-charts, based on the data the user enters. Sometimes the numbers make more sense when the computer turns them into a picture.

 A spreadsheet is like a digital table made up of little boxes called cells. These cells are put in rows (like lines in a book) and columns (like vertical lines). Each cell has a special name that tells its position, using letters for columns and numbers for rows. For example, a cell might be called  " C10. "  This idea of giving cells names was first used in a program called LANPAR. Another program called VisiCalc used a similar way of naming cells. You can also talk about a group of cells that are next to each other, like a bunch of cells in a column. This group is called a range. To talk about a range, you use the names of the first and last cells in that group. For example, you can call the first ten cells in the first column  " A1:A10. "  LANPAR did something special too. It allowed you to do calculations that depended on things you would write later. This was helpful and came back later in programs like Lotus 123 and Microsoft's MultiPlan Version 2. 
 
 In the new computer programs that work with tables, we put many tables together to make a big book called a workbook. This workbook is like a special computer file that holds all the information for the book, including the tables and the little boxes in the tables. Each table inside the workbook is called a worksheet or sheet for short. You can imagine these sheets like pages in a book. To switch between them, you can use tabs, just like flipping pages. But one program called Numbers does it differently. If you have many sheets in one book, you give each box a special name that tells which sheet it's in. For example, you might say  " Sheet 1!C10 "  to talk about a box in Sheet 1. Sometimes, you can even use this naming to talk about boxes in other books too.
