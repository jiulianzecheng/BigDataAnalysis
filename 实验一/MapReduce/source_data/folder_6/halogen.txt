The '''halogens''' are [[chemical element]]s under the second-to-right column in the [[periodic table]], also known as '''Group 17'''. The elements in the group are [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], [[astatine]], and [[tennessine]]. Halogen literally means  " salt becomer " , but it is often said to mean  " salt producer " . They are very [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], so they are likely to join with other elements on the left side of the periodic table to make [[Chemical compound|compound]]s. This is because they are missing one [[electron]]. They are rarely found alone in nature. Fluorine is the most reactive, while iodine is the least reactive. Astatine is very radioactive and hard to get.
