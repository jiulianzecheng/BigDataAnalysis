 A '''sanctuary''', in its original meaning, is a [[sacred]] place, such as a [[shrine]] or [[temple]]. By the use of such places as a safe haven, the term has come to be used for any place of [[safety]]. This secondary use can be a human sanctuary, such as a [[political asylum|political sanctuary]]; and non-human sanctuary, such as an [[Zoo|animal]] or [[Botanical garden|plant sanctuary]].
