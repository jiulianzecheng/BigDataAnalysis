 '''Sildenafil''' is an [[aphrodisiac]]. It is a medication that is also called '''Viagra''', '''Revatio''' and (in the [[Indian subcontinent]]) '''Caverta'''.  
 
 Sildenafil makes the [[blood vessel]]s become wider. This lowers the [[blood pressure]]. Sildenafil mostly works in the [[penis]] and in the [[lung]]s. This medicine increases [[blood]] flow to the penis. This helps the penis become [[Erection|erect]] during [[sexual intercourse]]. < ref > {{cite web | title=Erectile Dysfunction - Treatment|author=eMedicine | url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/444220-treatment | accessdate=26 February 2010}} < /ref >  Sildenafil also helps [[pulmonary hypertension]]. Because this medicine makes the blood vessels wider, it makes it easier for blood to flow. Sildenafil was patented in [[1996]] and first made to sell in [[1998]].
