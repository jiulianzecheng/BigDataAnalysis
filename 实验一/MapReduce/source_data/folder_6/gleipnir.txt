 In [[Norse mythology]], '''Gleipnir''' was the third [[wikt:chain|chain]] used to tie up [[Fenrir]], the [[wolf]]. < ref name=Grimes271 > Heilan Yvette Grimes, ''The Norse Myths'' (Boston, MA: Hollow Earth Publishing, 2010), p. 271 < /ref >  Fenrir was the son of [[Loki]] and [[Angrboda|Angrboða]], the [[giant]]ess. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.pantheon.org/articles/f/fenrir.html |title=Fenrir |publisher=Encyclopedia Mythica |access-date=15 October 2015 |archive-date=15 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115034501/http://www.pantheon.org/articles/f/fenrir.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The first two chains, named Lædingr and Dromi, were [[forge]]d by [[Thor]] and did not hold him. < ref name=Grimes271/ >  Gleipnir was created by the [[sons of Ivaldi]] and did hold Fenrir. < ref name=Grimes271/ >  It was as thin as [[spider]]'s [[silk]]. < ref name=Sherman163 > Josepha Sherman, ''Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore'' (London; New York: Routledge, 2015), p. 163 < /ref >  Gleipnir was made from six things: < ref > John Lindow, ''Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs'' (New York; Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 163 < /ref >   
 * The stomping of [[cat]]s 
 * The [[beard]]s of women 
 * The roots of mountains 
 * The [[spittle|spit]] of [[bird]] 
 * The [[breath]] of [[fish]]es 
 * The [[mwod:sinew|sinew]] of a [[bear]] 
 
 This was probably used to explain why all of those things are impossible. 
 
 The [[gods]] lured Fenrir to the [[island]] of Lyngvi. < ref name= " Sherman163 "  / >  They challenged him to be bound by Gleipnir. To show Fenrir it was no trick, [[Týr]] put his hand in Fenrir's mouth. < ref name= " Sherman163 "  / >  When he could not break Gleipnir's grip on him and they refused to let him out, Fenrir naturally bit off Týr's hand. < ref name= " Sherman163 "  / >  Fenrir was to remain bound by Gleipnir until [[Ragnarök]] (the final great battle of the gods). < ref name= " Sherman163 "  / >
