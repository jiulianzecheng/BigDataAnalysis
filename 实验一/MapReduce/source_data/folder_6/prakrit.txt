Prakrit (from prakrta, meaning natural) was the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] spoken in ancient India. The prakrits were used as a colloquial language, and can be contrasted therein with [[Sanskrit]] which was used as a literary language and developed a real written grammar. We can say that the Prakrits stand to Sanskrit as Vulgar Latin stands to Classical Latin. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2018-09-02|title=Prakrit: The forgotten ancestor|url=https://lifestyle.livemint.com//news/talking-point/prakrit-the-forgotten-ancestor-111645092396147.html|access-date=2022-09-09|website=Mintlounge|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|title=Introduction to Prakrit|url=http://prakrit.info/prakrit/|access-date=2022-09-09|website=prakrit.info}} < /ref >
