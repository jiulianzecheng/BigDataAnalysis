 '''Iodine''' is a [[chemical element]]. Its [[atomic number]] (which is the number of [[protons]] in it) is 53, and its [[atomic mass]] (the number of protons plus [[neutron|neutrons]]) is 127. It is part of the Group 7 ([[halogen]]s) on the [[periodic table|periodic table of elements]] and its electronic configuration is 2,8,8,18,17. < ref name=coolfact > {{cite web|url=http://www.chemicool.com/elements/iodine.html|publisher=Chemicool|title=Iodine Element Facts|access-date=2011-03-16}} < /ref >  It is a [[nonmetal]].  
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 [[File:IodoAtomico.JPG|thumb|Iodine vapor]] 
 Iodine is a dark purple-black solid. It is also a [[nonmetal]] and a [[halogen]]. It sublimes when heated to make a bright purple vapor. This vapor is very irritating, although colorful. Iodine does not dissolve in water, but it does dissolve in a [[solution]] of an [[iodide]] in water. It dissolves easily in [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[solvent]]s. 
 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 Iodine is at the bottom of the halogens and is the least [[chemical reaction|reactive]] of the halogens. Iodine is an [[oxidizing agent]], though not as strong as [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]]. It can become the colorless iodide ion if another atom or molecule gives an iodine atom one of its electrons. This is called reduction. Iodine reacts with [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[hydrazine]] to make [[hydriodic acid]]. Iodine dissolves in [[oleum]] to make a bright blue solution of I < sub > 2 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup >  and [[sulfur dioxide]]. This [[cation]] is also made when iodine reacts with [[antimony pentafluoride]].  
 
 Iodine reacts with [[base (chemistry)|bases]] to make [[hypoiodite]] and [[iodide]]. The hypoiodite [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to [[iodate]] and [[iodide]]. Iodine reacts with [[nitric acid]] and [[chlorate]]s to make iodates, too. Iodine reacts violently with some metals like [[aluminium]] to make large amounts of heat and toxic vapors. 
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 {{see also|Category:Iodine compounds}} 
 Iodine forms [[chemical compound]]s in several [[oxidation state]]s: -1, +1, +3, +5, and +7. This is typical of the halogens except for [[fluorine]]. -1 compounds as [[iodide]]s are the most common. Most [[organic chemistry|organic]] iodine compounds are in the -1 oxidation state. Most iodides are colorless or reddish-yellow and are weak [[reducing agent]]s. +1 and +3 compounds are quite rare. They are both oxidizing agents. +1 compounds are found as [[iodine monochloride]] and [[hypoiodite]]s. +3 compounds are found as [[iodine trichloride]] or [[iodine trifluoride]]. +5 compounds are found as [[iodate]]s and [[iodic acid]]. [[Iodine pentafluoride]] and [[iodine pentoxide]] are iodine compounds in the +5 state. +5 and +7 compounds are all strong oxidizing agents. +7 compounds are normally found as [[periodate]]s and [[periodic acid]]. [[Iodine heptafluoride]] is also in the +7 oxidation state. 
 
 [[Potassium iodide]] is one of the most common iodides. Iodides are normally colorless but turn yellow after being in air because the iodide is [[oxidation|oxidized]] to iodine. Iodides react with [[sulfuric acid|acidified]] [[manganese dioxide]] or [[chlorine]] to make iodine. Iodine monochloride is a red or brown liquid. Iodine trichloride, as well as [[iodine trifluoride]], are yellow solids. [[Iodate]]s like [[potassium iodate]] are colorless solids similar to [[chlorate]]s. Iodic acid is the only stable oxidizing halogen acid. [[Chloric acid]], by comparison, is very unstable and dangerous. Iodine pentoxide is a white solid, and iodine pentafluoride is a yellowish liquid. Periodates, like [[sodium periodate]], are colorless solids similar to [[perchlorate]]s, although weaker oxidizing agents. They decompose to iodates when they are heated. Periodic acid is not as stable as iodic acid. Iodine heptafluoride is the only iodine(VII) compound.

 ==History== 
 It was discovered by [[Barnard Courtois]] in [[1811]]. He burned seaweed to get [[sodium carbonate]] and reacted the residue with [[sulfuric acid]]. One time, he poured too much sulfuric acid on the seaweed and purple vapor came out which made dark blue-black crystals on a cold surface. He did not have enough money to see whether it was a new element or not. He gave samples to several chemists, who identified it as an element in [[1813]]. 
 
 ==Occurrence== 
 Iodine is too reactive to be in nature as an element. Iodine compounds are not common in the ground. There is a mineral called [[caliche]] that is found in dry deserts. It has iodate in it. Iodide is found in seawater. [[Kelp]] has quite large amounts of iodine in it. Iodine is one of the heaviest elements needed by living things. If people do not get enough of it, they get a disease known as [[goitre]]. Most [[salt]] has iodine [[Iodised salt|in it]], in the form of iodide or iodate. People can also take iodine pills to make sure they get enough. 
 
 ==Preparation== 
 Kelp was burned and the iodine extracted from the ashes in the 18th and 19th century, but now it is not good enough for common use. Most iodine now is extracted from seawater. Chlorine is reacted with seawater to change the iodide to iodine. Air is blown over the water to evaporate the iodine. Then the iodine is reduced with [[sulfur dioxide]] to hydriodic acid. Then the hydriodic acid is oxidized with chlorine again to make iodine.  This process is repeated until the iodine is pure.  
 
 A very pure form of iodine is made by reacting [[copper sulfate]] and potassium iodide. This makes copper(II) iodide which is not stable. It breaks down into [[copper(I) iodide]] and iodine, which is pure. 
 
 ==Uses== 
 Iodine is used as a [[catalyst]] for making [[acetic acid]]. [[Animal husbandry|Animal feed]] also has iodine in it for [[nutrition]]. Iodine is used for a [[disinfectant]]. [[Tincture of iodine]] is a common iodine disinfectant. Iodine can be used to prevent [[thyroid cancer]] after a nuclear explosion. After a nuclear explosion, radioactive iodine fills the air. The radioactive iodine easily goes into the thyroid and causes cancer. When people take iodine tablets, it fills up the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine which prevents any radioactive iodine from coming in. 
 
 Iodine compounds can be used in [[X-ray]]s because X-rays cannot go through them easily. Some metals are purified using their iodides. Silver iodide is used in [[photographic film]] and [[cloud seeding]]. [[Erythrosine]] is a food coloring that has iodine in it. Iodine can be used to make illegal drugs so it is restricted in some areas. Iodine can be used as a test for reducing agents. Iodine turns colorless when mixed with a reducing agent. Iodine also turns black when mixed with starch. Iodides become colored when mixed with oxidizing agents. 
 
 ==Safety== 
 Iodine can irritate skin. Its vapors are irritating to the lungs. It is less toxic than the other halogens, though. 2-3 grams of iodine can kill. Iodides are only toxic in large amounts.
