 '''''Scutellosaurus''''' was a small [[bipedal]] [[herbivorous]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Lower Jurassic]] period, 200 & ndash;196 million years ago. It was about a metre long. 
 
 Its back was [[armour]]ed, and it is placed in the [[Thyreophora]] with the other armoured dinosaurs. It was one of the earliest members of this group, and the most [[basal]] (primitive) form so far known. Its closest relatives may have been ''[[Emausaurus]]'' and ''[[Scelidosaurus]]''. These, and the larger armoured dinosaurs ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'', were all quadrupedal. The lightly built bipedal ''Scutellosaurus'' is similar in form to the ancestral dinosaurs, which were bipedal. < ref > The dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal: all the earliest ones known were bipedal. That means the transition from a quadrupedal [[archosaur]] reptile to a bipedal form took place before the dinosaurs evolved. The heavier dinosaurs later became quadrupedal again. This was, for them, a secondary or [[derived (biology)|derived]] condition. < /ref > 
 
 ==Description== 
 ''Scutellosaurus'' was around {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} long, < ref name=EoDP > {{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000unse_y8e7|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|pages= 134â€“135|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}} < /ref >  {{convert|50|cm|in}} tall at the hips, and weighed {{convert|10|kg|lb}}. The fossil evidence includes two partial skeletons recovered from [[Arizona]], although of the skull only the lower jaw has been recovered. There were also several hundred [[scute]]s running along its neck to its back and as far down as its tail. Some of these shields were flat, while others were pitted. It had an unusually long tail, possibly a counter[[balance]] to the weight of the armoured body, and long arms that suggest it may have [[browse]]d on all fours. < ref name=EoDP/ >
