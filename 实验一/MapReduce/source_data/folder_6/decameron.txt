 The '''''Decameron''''' is a collection of 100 short stories. It was written by the [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] around 1350. In the book, ten friends, seven young women and three young men, leave the city of [[Florence]] because of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and stay in a large house in the countryside. Each day, they entertain each other by taking turns to tell stories. The stories are of different types. Some are [[Love|romantic]], some are [[Eroticism|erotic]], some are [[comedy|comedies]] and some are [[tragedy|tragedies]].   
 
 Other writers have used the stories for ideas. Many paintings have been done which illustrate the stories. The picture to the right shows a scene from the story of  " The Pot of Basil "  in which Isabella buries the head of her murdered lover Ferdinand inside a potplant.
