 '''Stromboli'''  < ref > {{lang-scn|Struògnuli}}, [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Στρογγύλη}}, ''Strongulē'' < /ref >  is a small island in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], off the north coast of [[Sicily]]. It is one of the three [[active volcano]]es in [[Italy]]. 
 
 Stromboli is one of the eight [[Aeolian Islands]], a [[volcanic arc]] north of [[Sicily]]. The volcano has erupted many times and is constantly active with minor eruptions, often visible from many points on the island and from the surrounding sea. This gave rise to the island's nickname  " Lighthouse of the Mediterranean " . The most recent major eruption was on 13 April 2009. Stromboli stands 926 & nbsp;m (3,034 & nbsp;ft) above sea level, < ref name= " gvp " > {{cite gvp| vn = 0101-04=| name = Stromboli| accessdate = 2009-01-01 }} < /ref >  and over 2,700 & nbsp;m (8,860 & nbsp;ft) on average above the sea floor. < ref > Tibaldi A. ''et al'' 2009. Subaerial-submarine evidence of structures feeding magma to Stromboli Volcano, Italy, and relations with edifice flank failure and creep. ''Tectonophysics'', '''469'''(1), 112-136. < /ref > 
 
 There are three active [[volcanic crater|craters]] at the peak. A significant geological feature of the volcano is the ''Sciara del Fuoco'' (stream of fire), a big horseshoe-shaped depression generated in the last 13,000 years by several collapses on the northwestern side of the cone. Two kilometers to the northeast lies [[Strombolicchio]], the [[volcanic plug]] remnant of the original volcano.
