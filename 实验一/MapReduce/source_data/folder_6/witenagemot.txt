 The '''Witenagemot''' or '''Witan''' was an [[institution]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]], from about the 7th to the 11th century. The name is [[Old English]] and means ''council of the [[wikt:wise|wise]] men''. Originally, Witan was the [[plural]] of ''wita'' (the wise man); but it was used as a singular. The council was similar to the [[Germanic]] assembly called ''[[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]''.  
 
 The purpose of the Witenagemot was to give an opinion about the administration and the organisation of the [[kingdom]]. They talked about how [[law]] should develop. They elected or confirmed the [[king]]. The Witenagemot also had the power to depose a king. This happened when they deposed [[Sigeberht of Wessex]] in 755. They also deposed [[Ã†thelwald Moll of Northumbria]] in 765. 
 Witans were held at least once a year; usually more often. In many respects they were similar to modern-day [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. Unlike Parliament, the locations where they were held changed; neither the Witans nor the king had a permanent place to stay.  
 
 When the [[Normans]] [[Norman conquest of England|invaded]] England in 1066, they replaced the Witenagemot with another institution. This institution was still known as Witan or Witenagemot until the 12th century.
