'''Buckypaper''' is a thin sheet made from an aggregate of [[carbon nanotube]]s or carbon nanotube grid [[paper]]. The nanotubes are approximately 50,000 times thinner than a human [[hair]]. Originally, it was fabricated as a way to handle carbon nanotubes, but it is also being studied and developed into applications by several research groups, showing promise as vehicle armor, personal armor, and next-generation [[electronics]] and displays. 
 
 == Properties == 
 Comparative flame test of [[airplane]]s made of [[cellulose]], carbon buckypaper and inorganic boron nitride nanotube buckypaper. 
 Buckypaper is one tenth the weight yet potentially 500 times stronger than [[steel]] when its sheets are stacked to form a composite. It could disperse heat like brass or steel and it could conduct [[electricity]] like [[copper]] or [[silicon]]. 
 
 == Background == 
 Buckypaper is a macroscopic aggregate of carbon nanotubes (CNT), or  " buckytubes " . It owes its name to the buckminsterfullerene, the 60 carbon fullerene (an allotrope of carbon with similar bonding that is sometimes referred to as a  " Buckyball "  in honor of R. Buckminster Fuller).
