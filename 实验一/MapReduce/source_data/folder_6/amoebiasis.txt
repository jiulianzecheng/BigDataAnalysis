The infection is usually caused by ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. < ref name=Mansons > Farrar, Jeremy ''et al'' 2013. ''Manson's tropical diseases''. Elsevier Health Sciences, 664–671. {{ISBN|9780702053061}} < /ref >  The infection is normally got when someone [[drink]]s water with the parasite in it. 
 
 In some cases, the parasite lives in a person's [[large intestine]] and does not cause any symptoms. [[Symptoms]] vary from serious to none at all. There may be [[abdominal pain]], mild [[diarrhoea]], [[dysentery|bloody diarrhoea]] or [[colitis|severe colitis]] with [[necrosis|tissue death]] and [[Gastrointestinal perforation|perforation]]. This last complication may cause [[peritonitis]]. People affected may develop [[anaemia]] due to loss of blood. < ref name=Mansons/ >

 Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by water [[contamination|contaminated]] with [[faeces]]. It can also be got indirectly by contact with dirty hands or objects. 
 
 Infection is spread by ingesting the [[cyst]] form of the [[parasite]]. This tough and semi-dormant structure is found in [[faeces]]. Since amoebiasis is transmitted by contaminated food and water, it is often [[endemic]] in parts of the world with poor [[sanitation]] (such as [[México]], [[Central America]], western [[South America]], [[South Asia]], and western and southern [[Africa]]). < ref name= " Sherris " > {{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|url=https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi0000unse_q1i3|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=0-8385-8529-9|editor-last=Ryan KJ|edition=4th|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sherrismedicalmi0000unse_q1i3/page/733 733]–8|editor-last2=Ray CG}} < /ref > 
 
 Amoebic dysentery is often confused with  " traveller's diarrhoea "  because of its prevalence in developing nations. In fact, most traveller's diarrhoea is [[bacterial]] or [[viral]] in origin. 
 
 ''E. histolytica'' infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or [[liver]]. < ref name=Sherris/ >  So, two different classes of drugs are needed to treat the infection, one for each location. Such anti-amoebic drugs are known as ''amoebicides''.
