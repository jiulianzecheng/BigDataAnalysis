 '''Hypertension''' or '''high blood pressure''' is a [[chronic]] medical condition in which the [[blood pressure]] in the [[arteries]] is higher than it should be. This involves the [[heart]]  working harder than normal to [[Circulatory system|circulate blood through the blood vessels]]. 
 
 == Blood pressure == 
 {{Main|Blood pressure}} 
 The [[pressure]] in the arteries changes depending on what the [[heart]] is doing. When the [[Systole|heart squeezes]], pumping [[blood]] into the arteries, the pressure increases. When the [[Diastole|heart relaxes]], the pressure decreases. When blood pressure is measured, the highest pressure (when the heart is squeezing) is called the [[Systole#Systolic pressure|systolic blood pressure]]. The lowest pressure (when the heart is relaxing) is called the [[Diastole#Diastolic pressure|diastolic blood pressure]]. 
 
 Blood pressure is written as two numbers. For example, in the picture at the right, the person's systolic blood pressure was 158. Their diastolic blood pressure was 99. This blood pressure is written as 158/99. It is said  " 158 over 99. " 
 
 == Types == 
 There are two types of hypertension, called “primary” and “secondary.” Primary hypertension means that the hypertension is not caused by any other [[disease]] or condition and it gradually develops over time with age. Secondary hypertension means that the hypertension is caused by another disease or conditions. Secondary hypertension tend to result in higher blood pressure than primary hypertension. < ref name= " mayoclinic.org " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410|title=High blood pressure (hypertension) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}} < /ref >  In most cases (90-95%), hypertension is primary. Only a small amount of hypertension (5-10%) is secondary. 
 
 There are various health conditions that leads to secondary hypertension which includes: Obstructive sleep apnea, Kidney problems, Adrenal gland tumors, Thyroid problems, Certain defects you're born with (congenital) in blood vessels, Certain medications (birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers and some prescription drugs), Illegal drugs (cocaine and amphetamines). < ref name= " mayoclinic.org " / > 
 
 == Complications == 
 Hypertension can cause many problems, including [[heart attack]], [[stroke]], Aneurysm, [[congestive heart failure]], [[kidney failure]], vision loss, Metabolic syndrome, Dementia, etc.'''.''' < ref name= " mayoclinic.org " / > 
 * To stay healthy, most people should try to keep their blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jul 8, 2009|issue=3|pages=CD004349|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004349.pub2|pmid=19588353|editor1-last=Arguedas|editor1-first=Jose Agustin|last1=Arguedas|first1=J. A.|last2=Perez|first2=M. I.|last3=Wright|first3=J. M.}} < /ref > 
 
 == Risk Factors == 
 The risk factors includes age, Race, Family history or genes, obesity, lack of physical activity, chewing or smoking tobacco, too much salt in diet, not enough potassium in diet, alcohol, stress, kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea. < ref name= " mayoclinic.org " / > 
 
 == Treatment == 
 === Lifestyle changes === 
 Hypertension can often be fixed with changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] or [[lifestyle]]. The 2004 British Hypertension Society suggests that people with high blood pressure: < ref > < nowiki > Williams, B; Poulter, NR, Brown, MJ, Davis, M, McInnes, GT, Potter, JF, Sever, PS, McG society (March 2004).  " Guidelines for management of hypertension: report of the fourth working party of the British Hypertension Society, 2004-BHS IV " . Journal of Human Hypertension 18 (3): 139–85. doi:10.1038/sj.jhh.1001683. PMID 14973512 < /nowiki > < /ref > 
 * Lose weight if they are [[overweight]] or [[obese]] 
 * [[Exercise]] regularly 
 * Decrease the amount of [[salt]] they eat 
 * Limit the amount of [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] they drink 
 * Eat a lot of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] 
 
 === Medicine === 
 If lifestyle changes do not decrease a person's blood pressure, then the person may need [[medication]]s. A doctor will choose which medications to use, based on what other medical problems the person has. Examples of medications that decrease blood pressure include: 
 * [[Diuretic]]s, which increase [[urination]] to get rid of extra [[fluid]] 
 * [[Beta blocker]]s, which slow down the [[heart rate]] 
 * [[ACE inhibitor]]s, which [[Vasodilation|relax the arteries]] 
 
 === Effectiveness === 
 Even small decreases in blood pressure can have a large effect on a person's health. For example, decreasing blood pressure by 5 mmHg (for example, from 150/100 to 145/95 mmHg) can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%. It can also decrease the risk of [[heart disease]] by 21%. < ref > < nowiki > Law M, Wald N, Morris J (2003).
