 '''Rabbi''' (in the Hebrew classic '''רִבִּי''' ''ribbi''; in the Hebrew modern '''רַבִּי''' ''rabbi'') in [[Judaism]] can mean  " professor, master "  or literally  " grand " . The word  " ''Rabbi'' "  ( " My Master " ) derives from the Hebrew root  " ''Rav'' " , that in [[Biblical Hebrew]] signifies  " grand "  or  " respected "  (in knowledge).  
 
 In Judaism, most rabbis earn their title by studying [[halakha]] at a [[seminary]] or [[yeshiva]]. The primary role of a rabbi is to teach [[Torah]]. In addition, rabbis often act as the religious leader of a Jewish community. In contrast to many other religions, a rabbi is not required to be present at life cycle events in Judaism. Nevertheless, rabbis still normally preside over [[life cycle]] events in order to ensure that it is done according to [[Halakha]]. 
 
 " Rabbi "  is sometimes used as a title of respect for members of a Jewish community.  
 
 Historically, only men were rabbis. Since the 1970s and 1980s, most Jewish communities began to accept women as rabbis. However, most [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] communities do not accept this change. 
 
 Three rabbis together can form a rabbinic court, or [[beit din]]. This is done when there is a legal conflict between two Jews. They judge the conflict based on halakha. A beit din is also formed for somebody who wants to [[convert to Judaism]]. 
 
 Rabbis are also sometimes asked to supervise food preparation to make sure it is [[kosher]]. When packaged food is supervised, the packaging is often labeled with a [[hechsher]]. A hechsher is a symbol which means that the content of the package is kosher.
