 {{Nihongo|'''Sumo'''|相撲|sumō}} is a [[Japan]]ese full-contact sport. < ref > Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA914  " ''Sumo'' " ] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 914. < /ref > 
 
 In sumo, a [[wrestler]] (''[[rikishi]]'') attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (the ''dohyō'') 4.55 & nbsp;metres in [[diameter]]. Also, the ''rikishi'' try to use their skill to force an opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of his feet. 
 
 Sumo [[tournament]]s (''[[basho]]'') take place in [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya, Japan|Nagoya]] and [[Fukuoka]]. There are a total of 6 major professional tournaments (known as ''[[honbasho]]'') per year, in January, March, May, July, September and November. 
 
 A tournament normally lasts for 15 days and features matches from different divisions. The top 5 ranks are known as the  " Top division " , also called the ''Makuuchi'' (幕内) or ''Makunouchi'' (幕の内). It is fixed in size and always contains 42 ''[[rikishi]]''. 
 
 The ranks included in the top division are [[Yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]], [[ozeki]], [[sekiwake]], [[komusubi]] and [[maegashira]]. 
 
 ==Rikishi== 
 Sumo wrestlers (''rikishi'') are ranked into a [[hierarchy]] based on win-loss statistics in competitive tournaments. < ref > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA914  " ''Sumotori'' " ] in ''Japan Encyclopedia'', pp. 914-915. < /ref > 
 
 ===Grand champions=== 
 Those who have earned the highest rank are grand champions (''yokuzuna''). < ref name= " nussbaum915 " > Nussbaum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC & pg=PA915  " Yokozuna (Sumo Grand Champions) " ] at p. 915; retrieved 2012-2-27. < /ref >

 ===Foreign-born competitors=== 
 Sumo has changed in modern times. Foreign-born wrestlers are part of the sport. For example, [[Konishiki Yasokichi|Konishiki]] < ref > Sumo Reference, [http://sumodb.sumogames.com/Rikishi.aspx?r=1287 Konishiki Yasokichi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207101503/http://sumodb.sumogames.com/Rikishi.aspx?r=1287 |date=2012-02-07 }}; retrieved 2012-2-27. < /ref >  and Akebono < ref > Japan Sumo Association, [http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/rikishi_joho/rikishi_35.html  " Akebono " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307091554/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/rikishi_joho/rikishi_35.html |date=2012-03-07 }}; retrieved 2012-2-27. < /ref >  are Hawaiian-born athletes who earned places for themselves. 
 
 In 2008, Kotooshu from [[Bulgaria]] won a championship. In that same year, two top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, were [[Mongolian people|Mongolian]]. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament with no losses, 15-0.
