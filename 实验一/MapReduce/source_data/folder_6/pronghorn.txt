 The '''pronghorn''' (''Antilocapra americana'') is an [[even-toed ungulate]] [[mammal]], the only living member of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Antilocapridae'''.  
 
 It is a smallish [[ruminant]] [[mammal]] which looks like an [[antelope]]. It is 1.3–1.5 m (4 ft 3 in – 4 ft 11 in) long from nose to tail, and stands 81–104 cm (2 ft 8 in – 3 ft 5 in) high at the shoulder  
 
 The pronghorn lives in [[North America]]. It lives in the [[prairie]]s, but sometimes also in the [[desert]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. 
 
 The antilocaprids evolved in [[North America]], where they filled a [[niche]] similar to that of the [[bovids]] that evolved in the [[Old World]]. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]], they were a diverse and successful group, with many different species. Some had horns with bizarre shapes, or had four, or even six, horns. 
 
 In [[Africa]], the bovids evolved many ruminants which look like [[deer]] ([[convergent evolution]]). True deer are a different mammal, and do not live in the southern continents. For example, in Africa they are replaced south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] by bovids. 
 
 The pronghorn is the fastest land mammal in the [[Western Hemisphere]], with running speeds of up to {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}}. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.mammalsociety.org/about-asm|title=About ASM {{!}} American Society of Mammalogists|date=2011-03-16|website=www.mammalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}} < /ref >  It is often called the second-fastest land animal, second only to the African [[cheetah]], and it can keep up high speeds longer than cheetahs. < ref name= " " > Hawes, Alex 2001.

 == Appearance == 
 The pronghorn has a yellowish-brown to reddish-brown colored [[fur]] with a white underside, and white stripes on the neck and around the mouth. Male pronghorns also have black markings on the neck and face. The males have [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] that are up to 25 [[centimeter|cm]] long. Females usually have no horns; if they have horns they are very short. 
 
 == Life == 
 Pronghorns can be active at any time during day or night, but they are mostly active during [[twilight]]. Pronghorns eat [[grass]], but also [[leaf|leaves]] and [[herb]]s. Pronghorns have the ability to digest poisonous plants. This is due to their large liver, which helps in the filtering of toxins. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=PÉREZ-CRESPO|first1=VÍCTOR ADRIÁN|last2=ARROYO-CABRALES|first2=JOAQUÍN|last3=MORALES-PUENTE|first3=PEDRO|last4=CIENFUEGOS-ALVARADO|first4=EDITH|last5=OTERO|first5=FRANCISCO J.|date=2016-11-10|title=Diet and habitat of mesomammals and megamammals from Cedral, San Luis Potosí, México|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0016756816000935|journal=Geological Magazine|volume=155|issue=3|pages=674–684|doi=10.1017/S0016756816000935|s2cid=132502543 |issn=0016-7568}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[summer]], adult male pronghorns fight with other males for a [[territory]]. In this territory the male keeps a group of females with which he mates in September. Adult males go to the extremes in fighting each other to win over the female by fatally injuring the other pronghorn and determining which male is stronger. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Byers|first1=John A.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Patryce A.|last3=Jones|first3=Lee|last4=Roffe|first4=Thomas J.|date=December 2005|title=A large cost of female mate sampling in pronghorn |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/497401|journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=166|issue=6|pages=661–668|doi=10.1086/497401|pmid=16475083 |s2cid=20072115 |issn=0003-0147}} < /ref >  Young males that do not yet fight for a territory form small groups, and old weak males live alone. Females live in groups of about 20 animals. When the female is close to giving birth, it leaves the group for a time to give birth to its offspring. 
 
 After a [[pregnancy]] of 8{{frac|1|2}} months the female gives birth to 1-2 young, seldom three. The new-borns hide for three days, and after a week they can run with their mother. A pronghorn baby has grey fur, and after three months it has the adult coloring. They drink [[milk]] for 5–6 months, and start to eat grass after three weeks. Females become mature when they are 15–16 months old, and males become mature when they are 24 months old. 
 
 == Similarities == 
 The pronghorn's similarity to deer is an example of [[convergent evolution]], and it is like the parallel between deer and some African bovines. 
 
 == Saved == 
 Pronghorns were hunted almost to extinction by hunters. They were saved by interested people. On January 26, 1931, President [[Herbert Hoover]] signed the executive order for the refuge. On December 31, 1936, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] signed an executive order creating a {{Convert|549,000|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} tract; this was the true beginning for pronghorn recovery in North America. < ref > {{cite book|last=Sheldon|first=Charles|title=A History of the Boone and Crockett Club|date=1955|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club}} < /ref >
