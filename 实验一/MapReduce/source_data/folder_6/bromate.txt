'''Bromate''' is an [[ion]]. Its chemical formula is BrO < sub > 3 < /sub > < sup > - < /sup > . It contains [[bromine]] in its +5 [[oxidation state]]. It is more common than [[hypobromite]]s, [[perbromate]]s, and [[bromite]]s. [[Sodium bromate]] is an example. Bromates are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s. 
 
 Bromates are made by reacting [[bromide]]s with [[ozone]]. They can also be made by [[electrolysis]] of a hot bromide solution. [[Chlorine dioxide]] can react with bromide when in sunlight to make bromate. Bromates can be made by reacting [[potassium hydroxide]] with bromine. This makes bromide and bromate. Bromates can be made by reacting [[bromic acid]] with a [[base (chemistry)|base]]. 
 
 It might be a [[carcinogen]]. It is made when bromide is in water and reacted with ozone or chlorine. Sometimes water with too much bromate has to be gotten rid of.
