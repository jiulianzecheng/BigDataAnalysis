 A '''myocyte''' (also known as a '''muscle cell''') < ref name=Dorland > Daniel Albert ''et al'' 2012. ''Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary'', 32nd ed, p321  &  697. Saunders/Elsevier Philadelphia, PA. {{ISBN|978-1-4160-6257-8}} < /ref >  is the type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] found in [[muscle tissue]]. 
 
 Myocytes are long, tubular cells. They develop from '''myoblasts''' to form [[muscle]]s in a process called myogenesis. < ref > Myocytes at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)[https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?name=Myocytes] < /ref > 
 
 There are various specialized forms of myocytes: [[cardiac muscle|cardiac]], [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]], and [[smooth muscle]] cells. They have different structures. The striated or striped cells of cardiac and skeletal muscles are called '''muscle fibers'''. < ref name=Dorland/ > 
 
 [[Cardiomyocytes]] are the muscle fibres which form the chambers of the heart. They have a single central nucleus. < ref > {{cite web|title=Muscle tissues|url=http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/mammal/muscle.htm|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-date=2015-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013025029/http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/sci_ed/grade10/mammal/muscle.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  [[Skeletal muscle]] fibers help support and move the body.

 [[Smooth muscle]] cells control involuntary movements such as the [[peristalsis]] contractions in the [[oesophagus]] and [[stomach]].
