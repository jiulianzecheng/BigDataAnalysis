'''Retching''' (also called '''dry heaving''' or '''gagging''') is when the motion of the [[stomach]] and [[esophagus]] goes backward, but there is no [[vomiting]]. It can be caused by bad smells, choking or stopping certain [[medication]]s. It can also be because of [[stress (biology)|stress]]. 
 
 Retching is different from vomiting. During a retch, pressure in the [[thorax]] goes down and pressure in the [[abdomen]] goes up. In vomiting, both pressures go up.
