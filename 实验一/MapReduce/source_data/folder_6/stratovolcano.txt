 A '''stratovolcano''' is a tall, [[cone|conical]] [[volcano]] built up by many layers ([[strata]]) of hardened [[lava]], [[tephra]], [[pumice]], and [[volcanic ash]]. < ref > This article incorporates [http://www.usgs.gov/laws/info_policies.html public domain material] from the United States Geological Survey document [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/volc/types.html  " Principal types of volcanoes " ] (retrieved on 2009-01-19). < /ref >  Unlike [[shield volcano]]es, stratovolcanoes have a steep slope and explosive [[Volcanic eruption|eruptions]] every now and then.
