 '''Hedonism''' is the view that [[pleasure]] and [[suffering]] are the basis for what is [[Good and bad|good or bad]]. < ref name=Moore2019 > {{cite encyclopedia|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Hedonism|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=20 April 2004 |edition=Winter 2019|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entries/hedonism/ }} < /ref >  It is a {{c|Philosophical movements and positions|philosophical position}} that first appeared in [[ancient philosophy]].  " {{lang|grc|Hēdonē}} "  is the [[ancient Greek]] word for  " pleasure " . < ref name=Britannica > {{cite encyclopedia|title=Hedonism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|date=April 6, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hedonism }} < /ref >  There are many different beliefs in hedonism. But in all forms of hedonism, people think that what makes them [[happy]] is good. They also think avoiding suffering is good. < ref name=Moore2019/ >  Some people think [[pain]] is the opposite of [[pleasure]], but others do not. < ref > {{cite book|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|title=Ecce Homo|translator-last=Ludovici|translator-first=Anthony M.|series=The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche|volume=17}} < /ref >  Some forms of hedonism say it is important to get as many pleasurable experiences as possible. Others say that the quality of the pleasure matters. 
 
 Hedonism is often wrongly said to be related to [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. Sex can be a very pleasurable experience, but when philosophers talk about hedonism, they think more about the pleasure of reading a good [[book]], listening to classical music, or discussing with other philosophers. < ref > {{Cite web|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2021|title=Hedonism – Utilitarian Glossary|url=https://www.utilitarianism.net/glossary#hedonism|access-date=2021-05-08|website=Introduction to Utilitarianism: An Online Textbook|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 Two main types of hedonism are [[Cyrenaicism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Cyrenaicism is where people make themselves happy in the fastest amount of time. Epicureanism is where people like to be happy but they do so slowly so that they cause less pain to themselves. They also look more into the future and go for the higher pleasures in life. On the other hand, [[Maslowism]] is the term for when you combine the concepts of [[utilitarianism]] and hedonism. < ref >  Abramis, David J.  " Play in work: childish hedonism or adult enthusiasm?.
