 '''Hainburg''' is a [[village]] in the [[Offenbach Rural District]] in the state of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. 
 
 == Geography == 
 
 Hainburg is in the ''Rhine Main area''. The village is about 20 & nbsp;km southeast of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]. The [[municipality]] is 15.95 & nbsp;km < sup > 2 < /sup >  large and it is 90 m above sea level. < ref > [http://www.hainburg.de/ Homepage of the Municipality of Hainburg], looked up on 21 January 2010, German. < /ref >  It is a flat area with no hills. 
 
 About 20 to 35 million years ago in the Age of [[Tertiary]] the whole region was below sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of [[sediment]] sank to the bottom. Then the region rose again and the water receded, leaving soil which is mostly sandy. 
 
 The village consists out of the two former independent villages ''Hainstadt'' and ''Klein-Krotzenburg'', which are now the two districts of Hainburg. On 1 January 1977 they were united. 
 
 Hainburg's neighbors are:  
 * [[Hanau]] and [[Großkrotzenburg]] (North) (both [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis Rural District]]) 
 * [[Kahl]] and [[Karlstein]] (East) (both [[Aschaffenburg Rural District]]) 
 * [[Seligenstadt]] (South) 
 * [[Rodgau]] and [[Obertshausen]] (West) 
 
 Hainburg has 14,528 inhabitants (2008). < ref > [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html Official statistiks of the state of Hesse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173109/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html |date=2016-05-13 }}, looked up on 21 January 2010, German. < /ref >  The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany. 
 
 Some local people speak a regional German [[dialect]] [[language]] with a certain intonation and some different words (slang). It is a [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] (German: ''Hessisch''). This  type of dialect is related to other dialects in southern Germany. A long time ago, almost every town had its own special dialect, making it hard to understand for people from other parts of Germany. Today people who speak this dialect are in the [[minority]] and the majority of them do not speak the real dialect. They speak regular German with a special [[pronunciation]] of certain words. 
 
 == History == 
 
 In the 12th century the names of both villages ''Hainstadt'' and ''Crutzenburch'' (''Krotzenburg'') were written down in documents for the first time. 
 
 In those times the most people in the Hainburg area were [[farmer]]s and [[craft]]smen, rather than [[trade]]smen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed down to the next generation, it was divided among the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. 
 
 During the [[industrial revolution]] many factories were built in the Rhine Main area and it soon developed into a center for the [[metal]] business  and [[leather]] [[manufacturing]], as well as [[chemical engineering]]. Many men learned these trades and found jobs in the factories to earn money. This helped improve living conditions somewhat.
