 '''Budding''' is a method of [[asexual reproduction]]. With budding, a new [[organism]] grows on another one. It stays attached, while it grows. Only when it is fully grown does it detach from the parent organism. Since the reproduction is asexual, the newly created organism is a [[clone]] and is genetically identical to the parent organism. This method (asexual reproduction) is done in favourable conditions 
 
 Budding is very common in [[plant]]s and [[fungi]]. Sometimes it can also be found with animals, for example with [[Hydra (animal)|hydras]] or [[sponge]]s.
