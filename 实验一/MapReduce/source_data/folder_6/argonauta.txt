 '''''Argonauta''''', the argonauts, is the only [[extant taxon|living]] [[genus]] in the '''Argonautidae''' family. They are a group of [[pelagic]] [[octopod]]s. 
 
 They are also called '''paper nautiluses''', because of the paper-thin eggcase that females make. This structure does not have the gas-filled chambers of [[nautilus]] shells, and is not a true [[cephalopod]] [[shell]]. It is an [[evolution]]ary [[innovation]] unique to the [[genus]] ''Argonauta''. < ref > {{in lang|de}} {{cite journal | author =  Naef A. | year = 1923 | title = Die Cephalopoden, Systematik | journal = Fauna Flora Golf.

 Argonauts are found in [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] waters worldwide: they live in open ocean. Like most octopods, they have a rounded body, eight [[arm]]s and no [[fin]]s. However, unlike [[octopuses]], argonauts live close to the sea surface rather than on the [[seabed]]. ''Argonauta'' species have very large eyes and small distal webs. They have a mantle-funnel locking apparatus, which is a way to identify the genus. It consists of knob-like cartilages in the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] and corresponding depressions in the funnel. Unlike the closely related genera ''[[Ocythoe]]'' and ''[[Tremoctopus]]'', ''Argonauta'' species lack water pores. 
 
 ==Physical description== 
 ===Sexual dimorphism and reproduction=== 
 In Argonauts, males and females are quite different in size and lifespan. Females grow up to 10 & nbsp;cm and make shells up to 30 & nbsp;cm, while males rarely grow larger than 2 & nbsp;cm. The males only mate once in their short lifetime, but the females can get pregnant repeatedly. The females have been known since ancient times while the males were only described in the late 19th Century. The males use a modified arm, the [[hectocotylus]], to transfer [[sperm]] to the female. For [[fertilization]], the arm is inserted into the female's pallial cavity, then is detached from the male. 
 
 The hectocotylus was originally described as a parasitic worm. < ref > {{in lang|it}} {{cite book | author = Delle Chiaje S. | year = 1825 | title = Memorie sulla storia e notomia degli animali | publisher = Senza Verlebre del Regno di Napoli.

 === Eggcase === 
 Female argonauts make a laterally compressed, [[calcareous]] eggcase in which they live. The eggcase curiously resembles the shells of [[extinct]] [[ammonite]]s. It is secreted by the tips of the female's two greatly expanded [[dorsal]] tentacles (third left arms) before egg laying. After she deposits her eggs in the floating eggcase, the female herself takes shelter in it, often along with the male's detached hectocotylus. She is usually found with her head and tentacles protruding from the opening, but she retreats deeper inside if disturbed. 
 
 These ornate, curved white eggcases are occasionally found floating on the sea surface, sometimes with the female argonaut still clinging to it. It is made of [[calcite]], with a 3-layered structure < ref name=Nixon > {{cite book | author = Nixon M.  &  J.Z.

 The egg case also contains a bubble of gas used for buoyancy similar to shelled cephalopods, although it does not have chambers as seen in other shelled cephalopods. < ref name=Nixon / > 
 
 ''[[Argonauta argo]]'' is the largest species in the genus and also produces the largest eggcase, which may reach a length of 300 & nbsp;mm. < ref > {{cite book | author = Pisor D.

 ===Beak=== 
 The beaks of ''Argonauta'' species are distinctive. They  are characterised by a very small [[rostrum]] and a fold that runs to the lower edge or near the free corner. The rostrum is 'pinched in' at the sides. This makes it much narrower than in other octopuses, with the exception of the closely allied monotypic [[genus|genera]] ''[[Tuberculate Pelagic Octopus|Ocythoe]]'' and ''[[Glass Octopus|Vitreledonella]]''. Argonaut beaks are most similar to those of ''Ocythoe tuberculata'' and ''Vitreledonella richardi''. They differ in 'leaning back' to a greater degree than the former and because they have a more curved jaw angle than the latter. < ref name=Clarke/ > 
 
 ==Feeding and defense== 
 Feeding mostly occurs during the day. Argonauts use tentacles to grab prey and drag it toward the mouth. It then bites the prey to inject it with [[poison]] from the [[salivary gland]]. They feed on small [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s, but also [[jellyfish]] and [[salp]]s. If the prey is shelled, the argonaut uses its [[radula]] to drill into the organism, then inject the poison. 
 
 Argonauts are capable of changing their color. They can blend in with their surroundings to avoid [[predator]]s. They also produce ink, which is ejected when the animal is being attacked. This ink paralyzes the [[olfaction]] of the attacker, providing time for the argonaut to escape. The female is also able to pull back the web covering of her shell, making a silvery flash, which may deter a predator from attacking. 
 
 Argonauts are preyed upon by [[tuna]]s, [[billfish]]es, and [[dolphin]]s. Shells and remains of argonauts have been recorded from the stomachs of ''[[Lancetfish|Alepisaurus ferox]]'' and ''[[Mahi-mahi|Coryphaena hippurus]]''. < ref name=Clarke/ > 
 
 Male argonauts have been seen living inside [[salp]]s, which are [[plankton]]ic [[tunicate]]s. Little is known about this relationship. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Banas P.T.

 ==Classification== 
 The genus ''Argonauta'' contains up to seven existing species. Several [[extinction|extinct]] species are also known. 
 
 The extinct species ''[[Obinautilus awaensis]]'' was originally assigned to ''Argonauta'', but has since been transferred to the genus ''[[Obinautilus]]''. < ref > {{Cite journal|url=http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00578.x|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00578.x|title=A Paper Nautilus (Octopoda, Argonauta) from the Miocene Pakhna Formation of Cyprus|year=2006|last1=Martill|first1=David M.|last2=Barker|first2=Michael J.|journal=Palaeontology|volume=49|issue=5|pages=1035–1041|s2cid=128781244 }} < /ref >
