 '''Warwickshire''' ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] /{{IPA|ˈwɒɹɪkˌʃə}}/, /{{IPA|ˈwɔːɹɪkˌʃə}}/, or /{{IPA|ˈwɔːɹɪkˌʃɪə}}/) is a [[county]] in central [[England]]. The [[county town]] is [[Warwick]]. The shape of the administrative area Warwickshire differs considerably from that of the [[historic counties of England|historic county]]. Commonly used abbreviations for the county are '''Warks''' or '''Warwicks'''. 
 
 Warwickshire is perhaps best known for being the birthplace of [[William Shakespeare]] from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. The county has also produced other literary figures such as [[George Eliot]] (from near [[Nuneaton]]), [[Rupert Brooke]] (from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]), and [[Michael Drayton]] from [[Hartshill]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 Warwickshire is bounded to the northwest by the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] [[metropolitan county]], and [[Staffordshire]], by [[Leicestershire]] to the northeast, [[Northamptonshire]] to the east, [[Worcestershire]] to the west, [[Oxfordshire]] to the south, [[Gloucestershire]] to the southwest. 
 
 The majority of Warwickshire's population live in the north and centre of the county. The market towns of northern and eastern Warwickshire were industrialised in the [[19th century]], and include [[Atherstone]], [[Bedworth]], [[Nuneaton]], and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. Major industries included [[UK Coal|coal mining]], [[textiles]], [[engineering]], and [[cement]] production, but heavy industry is in decline. Of the northern and eastern towns, only Nuneaton and Rugby (as the birthplace of Rugby football) are well known outside of Warwickshire. The rich towns of central and western Warwickshire include [[Leamington Spa]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], [[Kenilworth]], [[Alcester]], and [[Warwick]]. They have light to medium industries, [[services]], and [[tourism]] as major [[employer]]s. 
 
 The south of the county is largely rural and has little population, and includes a small area of the [[Cotswolds]]. The only town in the south of Warwickshire is [[Shipston-on-Stour]]. The highest point in the county, at 261 & nbsp;m (856 & nbsp;ft), is [[Ebrington Hill]] on the border with [[Gloucestershire]], GR SP187426 at its southwest extremity. 
 
 There are no cities in Warwickshire since both [[Coventry]] and [[Birmingham]] were incorporated into the West Midlands county in 1974. The largest towns in Warwickshire as of 2004 are: Nuneaton (pop. 77,500), Rugby (62,700), Leamington Spa (45,300), and Bedworth (32,500). Stratford, Warwick, and Kenilworth all house populations with more than 20,000 inhabitants, the smaller towns of [[Atherstone]], [[Alcester]], [[Coleshill]], [[Southam]], [[Bulkington]], [[Polesworth]], [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]], [[Henley-in-Arden]], [[Studley]], [[Shipston-on-Stour|Shipston]] and [[Whitnash]] have populations between 5,000 and 12,000. 
 
 Historically much of western Warwickshire, was covered by the ancient [[Forest of Arden]] (although most of this was cut down to provide fuel for industrialisation in the 17th to 19th centuries). For this reason, the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with the phrase  " -in-Arden " . 
 
 ===Historic boundaries=== 
 [[File:Warwickshiremap 700.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A detailed map]] 
 
 Areas historically part of Warwickshire include [[Coventry]], [[Solihull]], and most of [[Birmingham]]. These became part of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] [[metropolitan county]] following local government re-organisation in [[1974]]. 
 
 Since [[1986]] Birmingham, Coventry, and Solihull have been effective [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], but they still remain legally part of the West Midlands. 
 
 Some organisations, such as [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]], which is based in [[Edgbaston]], in Birmingham, still observe the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] boundaries. 
 
 Coventry is effectively in the centre of the Warwickshire area, and still has strong ties with the county. Coventry and Warwickshire are sometimes treated as a single area and share a single [[NHS trust]] and [[ambulance]] service as well as other institutions. 
 
 The town of [[Tamworth]] was historically divided between Warwickshire and [[Staffordshire]], but since [[1888]] has been fully in Staffordshire. 
 
 In [[1931]], Warwickshire got the town of [[Shipston-on-Stour]] from [[Worcestershire]] and several villages, including [[Long Marston]] and [[Welford-on-Avon, Warwickshire|Welford-on-Avon]], from [[Gloucestershire]].
