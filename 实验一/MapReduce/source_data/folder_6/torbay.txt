 '''Torbay''' is a [[Unitary authority]] in [[England]]. 120,000 people live there. It is on the south coast and has over 20 [[beach]]es. [[Tourism]] is very important to the local [[economy]]. 
 
 Torbay is not a town. Rather, it contains three towns ([[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]]) and a few [[village]]s, the largest of which is [[Galmpton]]. 
 
 Torbay was first created as a [[county borough]] in 1967, uniting the [[urban district]]s of its three towns. In 1974 it became a [[borough]] of [[Devon]], its surrounding [[county]]. Then in 1993 It was given unitary authority status, having the powers of both a borough and a county. In 2007 a [[referendum]] led to the adoption of a [[Direct election|directly elected]] [[Mayor]].
