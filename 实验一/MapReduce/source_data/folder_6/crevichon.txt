 '''Crevichon''' is an islet off [[Herm]], immediately to the north of [[Jethou]], in the [[Channel Islands]]. 
 
 According to Dr S.K. Kellett-Smith, the name  " Crevichon "  means  " island of crabs, crayfish or cranes " . 
 
 Like many names in the [[Channel Islands]], it is [[Norman language]] in origin. A thousand years ago, the water level was ten feet lower (3 & nbsp;m), so there were many more of the animals the island was named after. 
 
 == Geography == 
 The island is about 212 by 168 metres (696 by 551 & nbsp;ft) at its widest.  Its area is less than {{convert|3|ha|acre |lk=in}}. The distance to [[Jethou]] is about 215 metres (705 & nbsp;ft). 
 
 ==History== 
 [[Image:CastleCornet1672.png|thumb|250px|An engraving of [[Castle Cornet]] 1672, showing the keep that was destroyed by an explosion later that year. Much of its stone came from Crevichon.]] 
 
 A 16th-century drawing of the islet, now in the [[British Museum]], shows Crevichon as apparently a wooded islet. 
 
 Prof. [[John Le Patourel]], in ''The Building of [[Castle Cornet]]'' said that in 1566, iron and hammers were taken to  " Creavissham " , and the island quarried for the castle. The quarry has been used since then, but this has made the island much smaller, and less visible. As a result, a fifteen-foot ({{cvt|15|ft|m |disp=out}}) marker was built on the top. Crevichon may have provided the [[granite]] for the steps of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]]. < ref > {{cite news |first=Wiseman |last=Alan |author2=Flowers, Min |title=Quite Interesting |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/exclusions/quiteinteresting/nosplit/ftqi118.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=2007-08-18 |access-date=2008-04-12 |quote=An even smaller Channel Island, Crevichon, to the north of Jethou, is said to have provided the granite for the steps of St Paul's Cathedral. }}{{Dead link|date=July 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news |title=Chance for people to visit Jethou |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/guernsey/3820729.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher= BBC |date=2004-06-19 |access-date= 2008-04-12 |quote='The steps to St Paul's Cathedral are said to be made with granite from Crevichon, the little island to the north of Jethou.' |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040712231108/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/guernsey/3820729.stm |archive-date= 2004-07-12 }} < /ref > 
 
 It is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby [[Jethou]]. 
 
 [[Compton Mackenzie]], former owner of [[Herm]] called Crevichon  " Merg "  in his book, ''[[Fairy Gold]]'', which is a fictionalised version of the islands.
