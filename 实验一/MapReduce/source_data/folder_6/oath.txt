 An '''oath''' (from [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''āð'') is a [[promise]]. An oath is spoken out loud in front of other people who can see and hear what is done and said. They are [[witness]]es to the oath. A person who cannot speak can make a sign that they are  " taking an oath " .  Another way of saying that a person is  " taking an oath "  is to say that they are  " [[swearing]] an oath " .   
 
 A person can say  " I promise that I will do this... "  or  " I swear that I will do this... "   
 
 When a person swears an oath they often show that the oath is very important to them by calling [[God]] to see and remember the promise, and to show that the promise is [[true]], and cannot be taken back later. When a person takes an oath they sometimes raise their right hand, or put their hand on their heart, on the [[Bible]] or on another holy book. 
 
 Oaths are used in many situations when a person needs to be true to what they say:  
 *A person often swears an oath when they get [[married]] that they will love, care for and be true to their partner. 
 *A person is often asked to take an  " oath "  that they will tell the [[truth]] in [[court]]. 
 *A person who has an important position like [[mayor]] or [[governor]] swears an oath that they will serve their people and country. 
 *When a person becomes a [[citizen]] of a country where they were not born, they take an  " oath of allegiance "  and promise that they will be a good and true citizen of their new country.
