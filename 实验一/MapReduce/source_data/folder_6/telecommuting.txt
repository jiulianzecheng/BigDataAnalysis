 '''Telecommuting''' or '''telework''' or '''remote work''' is a [[employment|work]] arrangement in which employees have flexible working locations and hours. They use [[telecommunication]] links to work. Many work from home, while others, also called '''nomad workers''' or '''web commuters''' use mobile telecommunications technology to work from coffee shops or other places. '''Telework''' is a broader term, referring to substituting telecommunications for any form of work-related travel, thereby eliminating the distance restrictions of telecommuting. < ref > {{cite book| last = Nilles| first = Jack M.| title = Managing Telework: Strategies for Managing the Virtual Workforce| url = https://archive.org/details/managingtelework00nill_0| year = 1998| publisher = Wiley| isbn = 978-0-471-29316-3 }} < /ref >  A person who telecommutes is called a  " telecommuter " .
