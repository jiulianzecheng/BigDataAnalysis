 '''Microtubules''' are found in biological [[Cell|cells]] as a part of the [[cytoskeleton]]. They are hollow tubes whose walls consist of 13 columns of tubulin molecules. Its main functions are to maintain a cell's shape, cell motility, [[chromosome]] movement in [[cell division]], and [[organelle]] movement. They look like hollow noodles which transmit signals to our nerves < ref > {{cite journal |author= Vale RD |title=The molecular motor toolbox for intracellular transport. |journal=Cell |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=467–80 |date=Feb 2003  |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00111-9 |pmid=12600311|s2cid=15100327 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author= Howard J; Hyman AA |title=Microtubule polymerases and depolymerases. |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=31–5 |date=Feb 2007  |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2006.12.009|pmid=17184986 }} < /ref >
