'''Eukelade''' or '''{{nowrap|Jupiter XLVII}}''', is a non-[[Sphere|spherical]] moon of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. It was found by a team of astronomers from the [[University of Hawaii]] led by [[Scott S. Sheppard]] in [[2003]], and got the designation '''{{nowrap|S/2003 J 1}}'''. < ref > [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/08000/08087.html IAUC 8087: ''Satellites of Jupiter''] [[2003]] [[March 4]] (discovery) < /ref > < ref > [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/mpec/K03/K03E11.html MPEC 2003-E11: ''S/2003 J 1, 2003 J 2, 2003 J 3, 2003 J 4, 2003 J 5, 2003 J 6, 2003 J 7''] [[2003]] [[March 4]] (discovery and ephemeris) < /ref > < ref > [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/mpec/K03/K03E29.html MPEC 2003-E29: ''S/2003 J 9, 2003 J 10, 2003 J 11, 2003 J 12; S/2003 J 1, 2003 J 6''] [[2003]] [[April 3]] (revised ephemeris) < /ref > 
 
 Eukelade is about 4 kilometres in [[diameter]], and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,484,000 & nbsp;km in 735.200 days, at an [[inclination]] of 164° to the [[ecliptic]] (165° to Jupiter's equator), with an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.2829. 
 
 It was named in March 2005 after [[Eukelade]], described by some Greek writers as one of the [[Muse]]s, and thus a daughter of [[Zeus]] (Jupiter). < ref > [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/08500/08502.html IAUC 8502: ''Satellites of Jupiter''] [[2005]] [[March 30]] (naming the moon) < /ref > < ref > [http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/muses/musesfr/scholies.pdf ''Scholies d’Hésiode''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206113059/http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/muses/musesfr/scholies.pdf |date=2006-12-06 }} (in Greek and French, translation by Michel Tichit), EducNet MusAgora: [http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/muses/musesfr/textes.htm ''Les Muses dans la littérature grecque ancienne''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827224029/http://www.educnet.education.fr/musagora/muses/musesfr/textes.htm |date=2007-08-27 }} < /ref > 
 
 Eukelade belongs to the [[Carme group]], made up of non-spherical [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000 & nbsp;km and at an inclination of about 165°.
