This movie is based on the 1997 [[Japan]]ese comic book. It is a mystery action movie about the contest of Oh Dae-su who was confined in private jail for 15 years (even he does not know why he was caged) and Lee woo-jin who confined Oh because of revenge. This movie deals especially and in detail with human hatred and revenge, and uses nice visual techniques to deal with sensational material. 
 
 The movie was nominated for many [[international]] movie [[festival]]s. It won 31 awards including Best Director at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2004.
