 '''Weather''' is the [[day]]-to-day or [[hour]]-to-hour change in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. Weather includes [[wind]], [[lightning]], [[storm]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[tornado|tornadoe]]s (also known as twisters), [[rain]], [[hail]], [[snow]], and lots more. [[Energy]] from the [[Sun]] affects the weather too.  
 [[Climate]] tells us what kinds of weather usually happen in an area at different times of the year.  
 Changes in weather can affect our [[mood|mood and life]]. We wear different [[cloth]]es and do different things in different weather conditions. We choose different foods in different [[season]]s.    
 
 [[Weather station]]s around the [[world]] measure different parts of weather. Ways to measure weather are [[wind]] [[speed]], [[wind]] [[direction]], [[temperature]] and [[humidity]]. People try to use these [[measurement]]s to make [[weather forecast]] < nowiki/ > s for the future.  These people are  scientists that are called ''[[meteorology|meteorologists]]''. They use [[computer]]s to build large [[mathematical model]]s to follow weather trends. 
 
 Severe weather can hurt people and their property. It can also just be a bother. Some examples of severe weather are: 
 * [[Tropical cyclone]]s 
 * [[Rainstorm]]s 
 * [[Drought]] 
 * [[Heat wave]]s

 ==Causes of weather== 
 Weather happens because different parts of the [[Earth]] get different amounts of [[heat]] from the [[Sun]]. This makes different [[climate]]s. The [[tropics]] get the most heat because the [[Sun]] shines straight down on them, while the [[poles]] get the least heat because the Sun shines on them from a low [[angle]]. Warmer [[air]] is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by [[convection]]. 
 
 The air always has some water mixed with it. This is called [[humidity]]. When it cools, the water can change from a [[gas]] to a [[liquid]] through [[condensation]]. Then the water can fall from the sky as [[rain]] or [[snow]]. After the air rises, it gets colder and goes back towards the ground. Because the air lost its [[water]] before, it is dry when it comes back to the ground. When two [[air mass]] < nowiki/ > es of different [[temperature]]s meet, this is called a [[warm front]] or [[cold front]]. The ways that the air moves around the Earth are called [[atmospheric circulation]].
