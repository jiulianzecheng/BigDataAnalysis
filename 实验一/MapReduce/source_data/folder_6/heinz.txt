 == History == 
 Heinz was founded by and is named for [[Henry J. Heinz]], who was born in the United States to German immigrants. 
 
 Henry J. Heinz began packing food at [[Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania|Sharpsburg]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1869. < ref name= " colliers " > {{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Heinz, Henry John|year=1921}} < /ref >  There he founded Heinz Noble  &  Company with a friend, L. Clarence Noble, and began marketing [[horseradish]]. 
 
 The company went bankrupt in 1875. The following year Heinz founded another company, F  &  J Heinz, with his brother John Heinz and a cousin, Frederick Heinz. One of this company's first products was Heinz Tomato Ketchup.     
 
 In 1888, Heinz bought out his two partners and reorganized the company as the H. J. Heinz Company.    
 
 In 1905, H. J. Heinz was registered, and Heinz became its first president, holding that position for the rest of his life. Under his leadership, the company pioneered processes for sanitary food preparation. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Petrick|first1=Gabriella M.|year=2009|title=Feeding the Masses: H.J.
