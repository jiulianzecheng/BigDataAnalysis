'''''Turandot''''' is an [[opera]] in three acts by [[Giacomo Puccini]], set to a [[libretto]] in Italian by Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. When Puccini died he had not finished the opera. It was later finished by Franco Alfano. It was first performed at the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]] in [[Milan]] on [[25 April]] [[1926]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was conducted by Ettore Panizza. 
 
 The most famous song from the opera is the [[aria]] ''Nessun dorma''. This aria was sung by the three tenors [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Placido Domingo]] and [[Jos√© Carreras]], and used as the theme tune for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 Soccer World Cup]]. This made Nessun dorma probably the best known of all opera arias.
