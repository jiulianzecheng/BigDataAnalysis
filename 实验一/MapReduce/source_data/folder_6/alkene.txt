 [[Aromaticity|Aromatic]] compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes. < ref name= " PAC1995 " / > 
 
 The double bond in the middle makes them more reactive because the molecule is not saturated. An alkene's unsaturation means that it will take the color out of bromine. The names of alkenes always end with -ene. 
 
 == List of Alkenes == 
 The following is a list of the first 10 alkenes: 
 
 * [[Ethene]] (C < sub > 2 < /sub > H < sub > 4 < /sub > ) 
 
 * [[Propene]] (C < sub > 3 < /sub > H < sub > 6 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Butene]] (C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 8 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Pentene]] (C < sub > 5 < /sub > H < sub > 10 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Hexene]] (C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Heptene]] (C < sub > 7 < /sub > H < sub > 14 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Octene]] (C < sub > 8 < /sub > H < sub > 16 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Nonene]] (C < sub > 9 < /sub > H < sub > 18 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Decene]] (C < sub > 10 < /sub > H < sub > 20 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Undecene]] (C < sub > 11 < /sub > H < sub > 22 < /sub > ) 
 * [[Duodecene]]  
 (C < sub > 12 < /sub > H < sub > 24 < /sub > ) 
 
 ==Physical properties== 
 The physical properties of alkenes are comparable with those of [[alkane]]s. The main differences between the two are that the [[acid]]ity levels of alkenes are much higher than the ones in alkanes. The [[physical state]] depends on [[molecular mass]] (gases from ethene to butene - liquids from pentene onwards). The simplest alkenes, [[ethene]], [[propene]] and [[butene]] are gases. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.  
 
 == Fuel == 
 Alkenes are not used as fuels because: 
 # They are scarce in nature. They are made from other hydrocarbons to make plastics, anti–freeze and many other useful compounds. 
 # They burn with a smoky flame due to less efficient, and more polluting incomplete combustion, so the heat energy release is lower than for alkanes.
