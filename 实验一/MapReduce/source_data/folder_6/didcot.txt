 '''Didcot''' is a [[town]] in [[Oxfordshire]] about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of [[Oxford]]. Until 1974 it was part of [[Berkshire]]. 
 
 ==History and economy== 
 
 During the [[Roman Empire]] the Romans dug a [[ditch]] that runs north through what is now known as the Ladygrove area north of the town near [[Long Wittenham]]. 
 
 Didcot first appears in historical records in the [[13th century]] as Dudcotte, [[Berkshire]].  Parts of the original village still exist in the Lydalls Road area and part of All Saints' Church dates back to the [[11th century]].  
 
 ===Railways=== 
 The [[Great Western Railway]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Didcot [[railway station]] was opened. The original station burnt down in the later part of [[19th century]].  
 
 Didcot is junction of the routes to [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Oxford]]. It was formerly a junction for [[Southampton]] via the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway]] but that closed in the 1960s.  
 The traffic to Southampton meant that the town had strategic importance to military logistics, in particular during the [[World War I|First World War]] campaign on the [[Western Front]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]] preparations for [[D-Day]]. 
 
 ===Power stations=== 
 {{main|Didcot power station}} 
 The Didcot Power Stations (which are next to each other, and actually in ''Sutton Courtenay'') supply [[electricity]] to the [[Electric power transmission|National Grid]]. The power station has also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers. One power station was closed in 2013 and has been demolished. The other is still operating in 2018.
