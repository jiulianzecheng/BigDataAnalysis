 A '''porcupine''' is a [[rodent]] with a coat of sharp spines, or quills, that defend them from [[predator]]s. The porcupine is the third biggest rodent, after the [[capybara]], and [[beaver]], and are not to be confused with [[hedgehog]]s. Most porcupines are about 60–90 & nbsp;cm long, with a 20–25 & nbsp;cm long tail. Weighing between 12-35 & nbsp;pounds (5–16 & nbsp;kg), they are rounded, large and slow. Porcupines come in various shades of brown, grey, and the unusual white. The name  " porcupine "  comes from [[Middle French]] ''porc d'épine''  " thorny pork " , hence the nickname  " quill pig "  for the animal. The correct term for a '''baby''' porcupine is a porcupette. A porcupette has soft quills made of hardened hair. This protects the mother from injury as she gives birth. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/baby-porcupine-called-86e1b821d866e879|title=Reference.com|first=|last=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=|archive-date=2017-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310013219/https://www.reference.com/science/baby-porcupine-called-86e1b821d866e879|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 The animal's quills or spines take on many forms, depending on the type, but all are hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and they are in the [[skin]] musculature. Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) have quills in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) single quills are mixed with bristles, underfur, and hair. 
 
 Porcupine quills are as sharp as needles, can be removed very easily, and will stay stuck in an attacker. Unlike [[needle]]s, however, the quills of New World porcupines have small, backwards-facing barbs on the tip that catch on the skin making them hard and painful to pull out. Quills are about 75 & nbsp;mm long and 2 & nbsp;mm wide. If a quill becomes put in the tissues of an attacker, the barbs act to pull the quill farther into the tissues with the normal muscle movements of the attacker, moving up to many millimeters in a day. Animals who try to eat porcupines have been known to die because of quill [[penetrating trauma|penetration]] and [[infection]]. Quills can still penetrate animals and humans even after death. < ref > [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Erethizon_dorsatum.html Animal Diversity] < /ref >  The ancient belief that porcupines can throw their quills at an enemy has long been proved to be incorrect. < ref > {{cite book| title = Encyclopaedia Britannica; Or A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Miscellaneous Literature| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Is0nAAAAMAAJ & pg=PA501| year = 1823| publisher = Archibald Constable| isbn = | page = 501 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| title = The Natural History of Secession| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MTA5AAAAMAAJ & pg=PA78| year = 1865| publisher = Derby  &  Miller| isbn = | page = 78 }} < /ref >

 Porcupines can live in a wide range of places in tropical and mild parts of [[Asia]], [[Italy]], [[Africa]], and [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. Porcupines live in forests, deserts and grasslands. Some live in trees, others stay on the ground. 
 
 Porcupines in search of [[sodium chloride|salt]] sometimes live in human places, eating plywood cured with sodium nitrate, < ref name= " plywood " > {{cite news |last= Morrisson |first= Philip |author2= Morrisson, Phyllis |title= Wonders: The Needy Porcupine |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000B3425-FD09-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21 |publisher=Scientific American |date= March 2001 |accessdate= 2007-06-29}}

Porcupines like going near roads in areas where rock salt is used to melt ice and snow, and are known to gnaw on vehicle tires or wiring coated in road salt. Salt licks placed nearby can stop porcupine damage. 
 
 Natural sources of salt used by porcupines include different salt-rich plants (such as yellow water lily and aquatic liverwort), fresh animal bones, outer tree bark and mud in salt-rich soils. < ref name= " saltsources " > {{cite book |last=Olson |first=Rich |author2=Andrea M.
