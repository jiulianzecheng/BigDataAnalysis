 A '''judge''' is a person who is in control of a [[court]] of [[law]]. 
 
 The way to become a judge depends on each country. In some countries, judges must work with the law (often as a [[lawyer]]) for a number of years before they can  " sit as a judge "  in a [[courthouse]].  Judges are supposed to conduct the trial in an open courtroom and [[impartiality|impartially]]. 
 
 In many English speaking countries, judges cannot make some decisions on their own. In these countries, [[jury|juries]] are used, but not for all cases. The modern jury trial first developed in mid-12th century [[England]] during the reign of [[Henry II]]. < ref > {{cite book| last = Warren| first = Wilfred Lewis| title = Henry II| year = 2000| isbn = 978-0-300-08474-0 }} < /ref >  Today, the details differ between one country and another. 
 
 If there is a jury, the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way. Some courts will have more than one judge. For important decisions about the laws of a [[country]], countries may have a ''[[supreme court]]'' or ''high court'' with many (nine or more) judges in it. In the [[United States]], judges on a supreme court are called ''justices'' and are led by a ''Chief Justice''. 
 
 In many countries, judges wear special clothes while being in court. Often this is a black [[wikt:robe|robe]] or cloak. Supreme or High Court judges often wear a red cloak. Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig. They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die.
