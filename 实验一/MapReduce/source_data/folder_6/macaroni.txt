 Macaroni is almost never eaten by itself. It is usually eaten with another food or covered in a [[sauce]]. A very popular type of macaroni is  " Macaroni and cheese " , which is macaroni covered in melted [[cheese]]. 
 
 In [[Libya]], macaroni is called Macroona Imbakbaka. Libya has Italian food because it used to be an Italian colony.
