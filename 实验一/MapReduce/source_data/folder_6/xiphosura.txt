 '''Xiphosura''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of marine [[Chelicerata|chelicerates]]. It includes a large number of [[extinct]] lines and only four recent [[species]] in the family [[Limulidae]], which include the [[horseshoe crab]]s.  
 
 The group has hardly changed in millions of years. The modern horseshoe crabs look almost identical to prehistoric genera such as the [[Jurassic]] ''Mesolimulus'', and are considered to be [[living fossil]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~mhaaramo/metazoa/protostoma/arthropoda/xiphosura/Xiphosura.htm |title=Xiphosura - Horseshoe crabs |publisher=Mikko's Phylogeny Archive |author=Mikko Haaramo |date=21 March 2003}} < /ref > 
 
 Xiphosura are traditionally placed in the class [[Merostomata]]. This term was originally made for the [[Eurypterida|eurypterids]]; now, with the Xiphosura added, it is known to be [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]].  
 
 Although the name Merostomata is still seen in textbooks, without reference to the Eurypterida, some have urged that this usage should be discouraged. < ref > {{Cite book |author=H.B.
