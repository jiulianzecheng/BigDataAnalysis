 '''Neurodegeneration''' is the progressive loss of structure or function of [[neurons]], including death of neurons.  
 
 Many neurodegenerative diseases – including [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]]. 
 
 Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells. < ref name=JPND > {{cite web|title=What is Neurodegenerative Disease?|url=http://www.neurodegenerationresearch.eu/about/what/|website=JPND Research|date=17 July 2014|access-date=February 7, 2015}} < /ref >   
 
 There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical [[protein]] assemblies as well as induced cell death. < ref name= " rubinsztein " > {{cite journal| author = Rubinsztein DC| title = The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 780–6|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051204| doi = 10.1038/nature05291| bibcode=2006Natur.443..780R| s2cid = 4411895}} < /ref > < ref name=bredesen > {{cite journal|vauthors=Bredesen DE, Rao RV, Mehlen P | title = Cell death in the nervous system| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 796–802|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051206| doi = 10.1038/nature05293| bibcode=2006Natur.443..796B| pmc=3970704}} < /ref >  Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of [[neuron]]al circuitry ranging from [[molecular]] to systemic.
