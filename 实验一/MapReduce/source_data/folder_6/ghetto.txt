 Originally the word ''''ghetto'''' meant the Jewish quarter of Venice, and later of any European town.  Many places had a ghetto where Jews were allowed to live. The term  " ghetto "  is now commonly used to refer to any poverty-stricken urban area with a concentration of [[minority group]]s.  The word has a few possible sources: 
 *  " getto " , the [[Venice|Venetian]] word for [[foundry]] [[slag]], because the [[Jew]]s were only allowed in the area where the iron foundries were. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=ghetto|title=ghetto - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}} < /ref >    
 * Others believe it is from the Italian word ''borghetto'', meaning a little ''borgo'' or ‘borough’. < ref > ''The New Oxford American Dictionary, Second Edition'', Erina McKean, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-517077-6}} < /ref > 
 
 It is also used to refer to areas that are considered to be undesirable.
