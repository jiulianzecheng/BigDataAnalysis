 '''Honeycrisp''' is an [[List of apple cultivars|apple cultivar]] that was made at the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station's Horticultural Research Center at the  [[University of Minnesota]], [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]. Named in 1974 as the MN 1711, and released in 1991, the Honeycrisp has rapidly become a prized commercial [[commodity]], as its sweetness, firmness, and tartness make it a good apple for eating raw. The Honeycrisp also keeps its [[pigment]] well and has a long [[shelf life]] when kept in cool, dry areas. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.minnesotaharvest.net/apple_honeycrisp.htm |title=The story of Honeycrisp apple |access-date=2010-07-09 |archive-date=2006-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819152531/http://www.minnesotaharvest.net/apple_honeycrisp.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
