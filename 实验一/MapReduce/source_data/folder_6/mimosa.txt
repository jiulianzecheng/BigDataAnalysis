 '''''Mimosa''''' is a [[genus]] of [[plant]]s. < ref > Not 'Silver Wattle' or 'Silk Tree', also sometimes known as  " mimosa " . < /ref >  It has around 590 [[species]] of [[herb]]s and [[shrub]]s. It is [[taxonomy|classified]] in the subfamily [[Mimosoideae]] of the [[legume]] family [[Fabaceae]].  The word  " mimosa "  comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|μιμος}} that means  " [[mimic]] " . < ref > {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC |title=The names of plants |first=D. |last=Gledhill |edition=4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521866453 |year=2008 |page=356}} < /ref > 
 
 The best known species of mimosa are ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' and ''Mimosa tenuiflora''. ''Mimosa pudica'' is found in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. When [[touch]]ed or [[heat]]ed, it folds its [[leaves]]. ''Mimosa tenuiflora'' is used by [[shaman]]s ([[tradition]]al [[magical]]) healer.   
 
 It is used in ayahuasca brews (a  " magic "  drink) because of the psychedelic drug N,N-Dimethyltryptamine DMT in its [[root]]s. In general, the production of such a chemical is a [[defence against herbivory]]. 
 
 == Grouping == 
 The ''Mimosa'' genus has been split up into smaller groupings or lumped into larger ones. It has over 3,000 names to describe its species. Most of these names are now considered [[synonym]]s. Some of the names have been given to other species and [[genus|genera]]. 
 
 The name  " mimosa "  has been used for other species that look like mimosa but are not related. Some of the most common unrelated plants called this name are the silk tree (''[[Albizia julibrissin]]'') and sattle (''Acacia dealbata''). 
 
 ==Description== 
 This genus includes some plants that are able to [[rapid plant movement|move fast]]. This is very rare. The mimosa's leaves close quickly when touched. 
 
 ''Mimosa'' is related to the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''Albizia''. The difference between them is that the mimosa's flowers have ten or fewer [[stamen]]s. The big round [[flower]] of the mimosa is actually an [[inflorescence]], a cluster (close group) of many small flowers.
