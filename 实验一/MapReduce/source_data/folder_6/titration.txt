 '''Titration''' is a type of [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative chemical analysis]]. It is used to work out the unknown [[concentration]] of a known substance.  
 
 It makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely, [[pipette]] and [[burette]]. External indicators like [[phenolphthalein]] or [[methyl orange]] and internal indicators like KMnO4 ([[potassium permanganate]]) are used to mark the end point of titration. 
   
 A known concentration and volume of a [[reagent]], called the ''titrant'' or ''titrator'', is added to a known volume of another reagent, the ''analyte'' or ''titrand''. This is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached. The volume added before the end point is reached is noted. Because one of the solutions, the titrant, has a known concentration, that of the other, the titrand, can be calculated. < ref > {{cite book|editor=Daintith, John|title=A Dictionary of Chemistry|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionarychemis00dain|edition=Sixth|date=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionarychemis00dain/page/530 530]|isbn=978-0-19-920463-2}} < /ref > 
 
 Professionals now use a [[pH meter]], which is [[potentiometer]] with an [[electrode]] whose potential depends on the amount of [[H+]] [[ions]] in the solution. The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator. At the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured pH. 
 
 Since [[volume]] measurements play a key role in titration, it is known as ''volumetric analysis'' as well as ''quantitative analysis''.
