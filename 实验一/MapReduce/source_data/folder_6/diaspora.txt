'''Diaspora''' ({{lang-grc|διασπορά}}, literally,  " a scattering or sowing of seeds " ) is used (without capitals) to refer to any people or racial group living outside their traditional homelands, [[Emigration|emigrating]] and being scattered in distant places and making a new community. It was first used in the [[Septuagint]] to mean the scattering of Jews after the capture of [[Jerusalem]] by the [[Babylonia]]ns in [[580s BC|586 BC]].
