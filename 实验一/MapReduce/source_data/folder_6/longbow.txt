 A '''longbow''' is a type of [[bow (weapon)|bow]]. It may not have been as strong as a [[crossbow]], but it could shoot more arrows per minute. < ref name=Fadala > Fadala, Sam 2011. ''Traditional archery''. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, p. 13/14. < /ref >  Also, the basic equipment cost little, and could be easily [[mass produced]]. < ref name=Denny6 > Mark Denny, ''Ingenium: Five Machines That Changed the World'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), p. 6 < /ref >  Metal-tipped arrows could go through [[armour]].  Only the strongest armor would stop it. < ref name=Fadala/ >  Archers (longbowmen) would usually have a second weapon, often a [[battle-axe]], if the fighting came close to them. 
 
 The longbow was mainly used in the [[Middle Ages]] until the 1500s.   
 
 It was made from a single piece of hard wearing, flexible [[wood]], often from a [[yew]] tree. < ref name=Denny6/ >  Yew was cut during the winter when there was no sap. < ref name=Denny6/ >  The flat side of the bow facing the target was flexible sapwood while the belly (facing the archer) was round and made of strong heartwood (from the center of a tree). < ref name=Denny6/ > 
 
 Groups of longbowmen would shoot at the same time.  The arrows would come down like hail.  This often scared the enemy. 
 
 Longbows have been found in Europe as far back as the [[Mesolithic]] period.{{fact|date=March 2022}} 
 
 == History == 
 The [[Welsh people|Welsh]] were the first people to use longbows. < ref name=KRI > {{cite web|url=https://kriii.com/english-bowmen/|accessdate=March 29, 2022|title=English bowmen|date=7 August 2019|publisher=King Richard III Visitor Centre|archive-date=29 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220629030345/https://kriii.com/english-bowmen/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In AD 633 Offrid, son of Edwin, king of [[Northumbria]], was killed by an arrow shot from a Welsh longbow. This was during a battle between the Welsh and the [[Mercia]]ns — more than five centuries before any record of its use in England. Despite this, the weapon is more commonly known as the  " English longbow "  than the  " Welsh longbow " . 
 
 In the Middle Ages, the English and Welsh were famous for their very powerful Welsh longbows. They were used to great effect in the [[Wars of the Roses|civil wars of the period]] and against the French in the [[Hundred Years' War]] (with notable success at the battles of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] (1346), [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] (1356) and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] (1415). < ref > ''The Hundred Years War (Part II): Different Vistas'', eds.

 The average length of arrowshafts recovered from the 1545 sinking of the [[Mary Rose]] is {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=x| /}}. 
 
 The bows were pretty easy and quick to craft, yet was quite lethal and could pierce through armor.  
 
 A longbow has practical advantages compared to a modern [[recurve bow|recurve]] or [[compound bow]]; it is usually lighter, quicker to prepare for shooting, and shoots more quietly. However, other things being equal, the modern bow will shoot a faster arrow more accurately than the longbow. 
 
 ==Effects on the human body== 
 
 Bowmen had to practice for many years before they could shoot a longbow well.  Also, longbows are very strong.  This made archers' bodies different from other people's bodies.  The skeletons of medieval bowmen are different from other people's skeletons.  The arm and shoulder bones are thick and a little bent.  These bones supported the large muscles that grew on the archers' arms and backs as they practiced with the bow.  On some archers, the right shoulder was higher than the left shoulder.  This is because archers almost always shot on the same side.  They did not switch hands. < ref name=KRI / >
