A '''constable''' is a person doing a certain job, most commonly in [[Police|law enforcement]].  The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries. 
 
 Historically,  the word ''constable'' comes from the [[Latin]],  ''comes  stabuli'', [[count]] of the [[stable]]s. It came from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the [[horse]]s of a [[lord]] or [[monarch]]. < ref  name= " kofk " > p103, Bruce, Alistair, ''Keepers of the Kingdom''  (Cassell, 2002), {{ISBN|0-304-36201-8}} < /ref > < ref name= " eb " > [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9025958/constable  Constable],  Encyclopedia Britannica online < /ref >  The title was later used in the [[monarchy|monarchies]]  of [[Middle Ages|medieval]]  [[Europe]]. In many countries, the constable became a high [[military rank]] and great officer of State such as, the [[Constable of France]]. 
 
 In modern times, constables are [[Police|law enforcement]] officers. In the [[United Kingdom]],  [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and some [[Europe]]an countries, a constable is the  lowest rank of [[police]]  officer. In the [[United States]]  a constable is usually an elected [[peace officer]], with less powers than a [[sheriff]]. However, in the [[Channel Islands]]  a constable is an elected office-holder at the [[civil parish|parish]] level. 
 
 Historically, a  constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a [[castle]]. Even today, there is a [[Constable of the Tower of London]].
