 '''Campagna''' is a small town in the [[region]] of [[Campania]] in [[Italy]]. 
 
 The town, located in a mountainous district, gradually lost importance in the 20th century. All its district offices have been moved to other cities since the 1930s, and the [[Diocese of Campagna]] merged with the [[Archdiocese of Salerno]] in 1973. 
 
 During [[World War II]], Campagna was the site of an [[internment camp]]. The Bishop [[Giuseppe Maria Palatucci]] turned the camp into a shelter for Italian and foreign [[Jew]]s, many of them sent there for protection by his nephew [[Giovanni Palatucci]]; Giovanni was later honored as a [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by the [[Yad Vashem]] [[Holocaust]] Memorial.
