 '''Banjul''' (formerly '''Bathurst''') is the [[capital (city)|capital city]] of [[the Gambia]]. About 31,000 people live in the city. But the total [[urban]] area is many times larger with 413,397 people.  The city is on [[St Mary's Island]] (or ''Banjul Island'') where the [[Gambia River]] enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The [[island]] is connected to the rest of Gambia by [[ferry|ferries]] to the north and [[bridge]]s to the south. Banjul is the main urban area of The Gambia. It is the [[country|country's]] [[economics|economic]] and [[administration|administrative]] center. 
 
 [[Peanut]] processing is the main [[industry]] of the country. [[Beeswax|bee's wax]], [[Arecaceae|palm wood]], [[palm oil]], and [[animal]] [[skin]]s are also [[transport]]ed from its [[harbor|port]]. 
 
 Things to see in the city include the [[Gambian National Museum]], the [[Albert Market]], [[Banjul State House]], [[Banjul Court House]], two [[cathedral]]s and several major [[mosque]]s. The city is served by the [[Banjul International Airport]]. 
 
 == History == 
 In 1816, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[:wikt:found|founded]] Banjul as a [[trade|trading post]]. Banjul was also used to help stop the [[slave trade]].  It was first named ''Bathurst'' after [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Henry Bathurst]]. The name was changed to Banjul in 1973. 
 
 ==Climate== 
 
 Banjul has a very warm climate year round.  Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Banjul features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]].  The city features a lengthy [[dry season]], spanning from November to June and a relatively short [[wet season]] covering the remaining four months. However, during those four months, Banjul tends to see heavy precipitation.  August is usually the rainiest month, with on average more than 300 & nbsp;mm of precipitation falling.  Temperatures are somewhat constant, though it tends to be slightly cooler during the wet season than the dry season. 
 
 According to a Gambian government minister, Banjul is at risk of submerging under water by a metre rise in sea levels as a result of climate change and global warming. < ref > {{Citation
