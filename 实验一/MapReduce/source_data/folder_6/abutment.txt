 In [[civil engineering|engineering]], '''abutment''' refers to the [[Bridge#Structure_type|substructure]] at the ends of a bridge [[Span (architecture)|span]] or [[dam]]. < ref name=USBR > {{cite web|title=Glossary -  " Abutment " |url=http://www.usbr.gov/library/glossary/|publisher=U.S. Bureu of Reclamation|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-date=25 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225164200/http://www.usbr.gov/library/glossary/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This is where the [[structure]]'s [[Bridge#Structure_type|superstructure]] rests or contacts. < ref name=USBR/ >  Single-span [[bridge]]s have abutments at each end. These provide [[wikt:vertical|vertical]] and [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] (side to side) [[wikt:support|support]] for the bridge. They also act as [[retaining wall]]s to resist lateral movement of the earthen [[wikt:fill|fill]] of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require [[pier (architecture)|piers]] to support ends of spans that are not supported by abutments. < ref > {{cite book| last =Abbett| first =Robert W.| title =American Civil Engineering Practice| publisher =John Wiley  &  Sons| volume =III| year =1957| location =New York| pages =26-22 & 26-32}} < /ref >  Dam abutments are generally the natural valley walls. They may also be [[artificial]] in order to support arch dams such as [[Kurobe Dam]] in Japan. < ref name=USBR/ > < ref > {{cite web|title=関西電力　黒部川第四発電所 (Kurobe Kansaidenryoku Fourth plant)|url=http://www.suiryoku.com/gallery/toyama/kuro4/kuro4.html|publisher=Suiryoku.com|access-date=24 January 2015|language=ja}} < /ref >
