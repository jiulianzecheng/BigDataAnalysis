'''Sucralose''' is an artificial sweetener, most of which, if ingested, will not be broken down by the [[body]] and is thereby non-caloric (doesn't contribute to calorie intake). Sucralose is almost 600 times as sweet as sucrose, twice as sweet as saccharin and 3 times as sweet as [[aspartame]]. It is stable under heat and over a broad range of [[pH]] condition, meaning it can be used in baking or products which require longer shelf lives. It was first discovered and patented in 1976.
