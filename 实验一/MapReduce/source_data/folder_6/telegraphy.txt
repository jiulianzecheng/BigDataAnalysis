 '''Telegraphy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''[[wikt:tele-|tele]] (τηλε)'' = far and ''[[wikt:-graphy|graphein]] (γραφειν)'' = write) is the long-distance transmission of written messages without physical transport of letters. 
 
 A telegraph sends electric pulses in a special [[code]], composed from short and large marks. Usually, amateur radio operators use [[Morse code]]. [[File:OptischerTelegraf.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Claude Chappe]]'s optical telegraph on the [[Litermont]] near [[Nalbach]], Germany]] 
 
 ==History== 
 Some of the first telegraphs were made in the late 1700s, but these were hard to use because they had too many wires. [[Samuel Morse]] made a telegraph using only one wire. In 1844, he built a telegraph line from [[Baltimore]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], and soon, there were telegraphs all over the United States. This made it easier for people to talk to people far away and made it easier for people to move out West. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.150.si.edu/150trav/remember/r819.htm |title=Telegraph |work=150.si.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2011 |archive-date=December 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228012141/http://www.150.si.edu/150trav/remember/r819.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  A [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] and other developments linked the world by the end of the century. [[Radio]] telegraphy became widespread in the early 20th century, especially on ships. 
 
 People would send messages called ''telegrams'' to other people. They would give the message to a telegraph operator, who would send the message using Morse code. The operator on the other end would write down the message and give it to the person receiving the message. After the 1930s, it became cheaper to make long-distance [[telephone]] calls than to send telegrams, so fewer telegrams were sent. Western Union, an American company that was created for telegrams, sent its last one in 2006. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5186113 |title=Western Union Sends Its Last Telegram : NPR |first=Robert|last=Siegel |work=npr.org |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Telegraphs now== 
 Telegraphs have become rare. This is because of newer [[technology]] that people can use to [[communication|communicate]], such as the [[telephone]] and the [[Internet]]. However, morse code is still popular among amateur radio enthusiasts. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_HbA543bl53W0zSgkhS3Ws7Kadqe8_6a/view?usp=sharing & usp=embed_facebook|title=SecretMsg.wav|website=Google Docs|access-date=2018-05-27}} < /ref >
