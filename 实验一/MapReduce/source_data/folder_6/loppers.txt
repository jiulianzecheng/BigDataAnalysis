 '''Loppers''' are a long-handled cutting [[tool]].  It has two handles, one connected to a blade and the other to a blunt surface that holds the object being cut.  Like the word ''scissors'', is always used as a plural (one pair of loppers is shown in this image).  
 
 It is used for cutting thick plants, even saplings (young trees) or branches that are less than an inch (2.5 cm) thick (about as thick as a person's thumb).  It is used in gardening, tree care, and [[prairie restoration]].  It can cut things that are too big for gardening clippers or [[pruners]]. If the branch or tree is too big for loppers, then a [[saw]] is needed.
