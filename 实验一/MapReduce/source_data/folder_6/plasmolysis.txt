 '''Plasmolysis''' is the process in which [[Cell|cells]] lose water in a [[hypertonic]] [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]]. It is the shrinkage of the [[cytoplasm]] and cell surface [[membrane]] from the cell wall. If a [[plant]] cell is placed in a solution of lower water [[potential]], the [[Molecule|molecules]] of water leave the [[vacuole]] by [[osmosis]]. The vacuole loses water and becomes smaller. The cell is said to be ''plasmolysed''. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The term plasmolysis  comes from the [[Latin]] word ''plasma'' meaning ‘matrix’ and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''lysis'', meaning ‘loosening’.
