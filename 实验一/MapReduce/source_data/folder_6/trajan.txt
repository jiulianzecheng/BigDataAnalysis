 '''Trajan''' (Marcus Ulpius Nerva Traianus, 18 September 53 – 9 August 117) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 98 to 117.  
 
 Born in the province of [[Hispania]] Baetica into an Italic family, Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor [[Domitian]]. < ref > Julian Bennett, Trajan: Optimus Princeps, 2nd Edition, Routledge 2000, 12. < /ref >  Serving as a general in the [[Roman army]] along the [[Germanic peoples|German]] frontier, Trajan successfully put down the revolt of [[Lucius Antonius Saturninus|Antonius Saturninus]] in 89. 
 
 In September 96, Domitian was succeeded by [[Nerva]], an old and childless senator who proved to be unpopular with the army. After a brief and tumultuous year in power, a revolt by members of the [[Praetorian Guard]] compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died on 27 January 98, and was succeeded by Trajan without incident. 
 
 == Trajan as Emperor == 
 As a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of [[Rome]] and left multiple enduring landmarks such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]].  
 
 Early in his reign he annexed [[Nabataea]] (between the [[Arabia]]n and [[Sinai]] [[peninsula]]s), creating the province of Arabia Petraea. His conquest of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] enriched the empire greatly - the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. < ref name= " Romanis REquote01 " > {{cite encyclopedia|accessdate=2007-07-21|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/assobd.htm#t-inx|title=De Imperatoribus Romanis|encyclopedia=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors|quote= Battle of Sarmizegetusa (Sarmizegetuza), A.D. 105. During Trajan's reign one of the most important Roman successes was the victory over the Dacians. 
 }} < /ref >  His war against the [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] ended with the sack of its capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of [[Armenia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. 
 
 In late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a [[stroke]] in the city of [[Selinus]]. He was [[deified]] by the Senate, and succeeded by his adopted son [[Hadrian]]. 
 
 As an emperor, Trajan's reputation has endured & nbsp;— he is one of the few rulers whose reputation has survived nineteen centuries. Every new emperor after him was honoured by the Senate with the prayer ''felicior Augusto, melior Traiano'', meaning  " may he be luckier than [[Augustus]] and better than Trajan " . Among [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian theologians, Trajan was considered a  " virtuous [[pagan]] " , while the 18th century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] popularized the notion of the [[Five Good Emperors]], of which Trajan was the second. < ref > {{cite book |title=Idiots guide to the Roman Empire. |url=https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu0000nels_z7e5 |last=Nelson |first=Eric |year=2002 |publisher=Alpha Books |isbn=0-02-864151-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/completeidiotsgu0000nels_z7e5/page/207 207]–209}} < /ref >
