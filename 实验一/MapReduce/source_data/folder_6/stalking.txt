 '''Stalking''' means following something or somebody [[secret]]ly. In the [[animal kingdom]], [[Predator]]s often hunt by stalking, or by combining stalking with [[ambush]]ing.  
 
 Someone who likes to watch other people is known as a [[voyeur]]. When this is continually done to a person it can have a bad effect. 
 
 == Criminal stalking == 
 Stalking in a way that makes someone feel unsafe is a crime in many countries. It is not just one event but an ongoing process that threatens or makes that person feel scared. Someone who does this is called a stalker. The stalker may do this because they want to be involved in that person's life, because they want to have power over that person's life, or for other [[sex]]ual reasons. The stalker can make that person feel scared. They may feel they do not have the power to stop the stalker. [[Psychologist]]s say stalking is a way of hurting someone's mind. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php|title=SocioSite: EIGENAARDIGHEDEN VAN CYBERSPACE: CYBERSTALKING|website=www.sociosite.org|access-date=2006-10-30|archive-date=2012-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522043358/http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  Sometimes a stalker may go on to hurt that person's body by assaulting, [[rape|raping]] or [[murder|murdering]] that person.
