 It was a [[Lycopodiophyta|lycopod]], an early land plant. This was one of the trees which made up the [[Carboniferous]] coal-forests. 
 
 It had thin grasslike leaves that grew on the stem. The stem of the plant was green. Sigillaria reproduced with [[spores]]. It went extinct about 300 million years ago.
