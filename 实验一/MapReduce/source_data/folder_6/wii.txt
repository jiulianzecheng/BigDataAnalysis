 ==Wii Remote== 
 [[File:Wii Remote.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Wii Remote in a person's hand]] 
 The Wii Remote is a controller that is like a regular television remote. The Wii Remote uses [[accelerometer]]s and [[infrared]] light sensors (from [[LED]]s inside a 'sensor bar') to know where it is in [[3D]] space. < ref name= " remote_accel " > {{cite web|last=Wisniowski|first=Howard|date=|title=Analog Devices And Nintendo Collaboration Drives Video Game Innovation With iMEMS Motion Signal Processing Technology|url=http://www.analog.com/en/press-release/May_09_2006_ADI_Nintendo_Collaboration/press.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625055416/http://www.analog.com/en/press-release/May_09_2006_ADI_Nintendo_Collaboration/press.html|archive-date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=2010-05-15|website=|publisher=Analog Devices, Inc}} < /ref >  This lets people control the game using [[wikt:physical|physical]] movement and by pressing buttons. The controller connects to the console using [[Bluetooth]]. It has a rumble feature (the controller shakes when the game being played tells it to do so) and a [[speaker]] inside the remote. 
 
 An attachment to the Wii Remote that comes with the Wii console and can also be bought by itself in stores is the ''Nunchuk'' controller. It also has an accelerometer and an [[analog signal|analog]] stick with two buttons, and it connects to the bottom of the Wii Remote with a wire. A [[wrist]] strap can also be used to stop the player from dropping or throwing the Wii Remote. Because of problems with the straps, Nintendo has given all players a free stronger replacement for all straps. < ref name= " strap " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Nintendo Issue Replacement Wii Wrist Straps|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/news_151206_wrist.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108115627/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/news_151206_wrist.html|archive-date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=2010-05-15|website=|publisher=Official Nintendo Magazine}} < /ref >  It also comes with a cover called the Wii Remote Jacket, which protects the Wii Remote and the thing that it hits from being damaged or broken. < ref name= " jacket " > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Nintendo Announces New Wii Remote Jacket Accessory|url=http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/meGSAugqYGKxlEMVLDtePEEQweFFdtSM|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214005824/http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/meGSAugqYGKxlEMVLDtePEEQweFFdtSM|archive-date=December 14, 2007|accessdate=2010-05-15|website=|publisher=Nintendo}} < /ref >  It also gives a stronger grip, which makes it harder for the Wii Remote to slide out of players' hands. 
 
 === Attachments for the Wii Remote === 
 Nintendo and many other companies have made attachments for the Wii Remote. They are usually connected by a wire or by a small plug at the bottom of the Wii Remote. 
 
 ==== Nunchuk ==== 
 [[File:Wii nunchuk controller side.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Nunchuk, looked at from the side]] 
 The Nunchuk is the most common attachment for the Wii Remote. It is made to fit perfectly into someone's hand. It comes packaged with the Wii. The Nunchuk has an analog stick on the front and two buttons on the back. A Nunchuk is needed for many Wii games, as it is required to move characters around the game. The name  " Nunchuk "  is a play on the word  " Nunchuck "  or  " [[nunchaku]] " . 
 
 ==== Wii Motion Plus ==== 
 The Wii Motion Plus connects to the bottom of the Wii remote to help the sensors find the remote more accurately. It improves the playing of some games. 
 
 ==== Classic Controller ==== 
 [[File:DSC03401 (172092547).jpg|thumb|left]] 
 Nintendo has released a  " classic "  controller for the Wii. The design is similar to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES's]] controller, but it has two analog sticks and four shoulder buttons instead of two. It was mainly made for playing older games that can be bought from the Wii Shop Channel. 
 
 ==== Zapper ==== 
 There is also a case that looks like a [[gun]] for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. It is named the Zapper after a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] gun controller. When the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk are placed inside it, the shape of the controller in the player's hands changes. The Zapper does not actually plug into the Wii Remote. It just holds it in place. The Zapper also included a free, short game to help the player get used to it. 
 
 ==== Instruments ==== 
 There are many pretend instruments made by Nintendo and other companies for playing [[music video games]] like ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]''. So far, they have made [[guitar]]s and [[drums]]. They plug into the bottom of the Wii Remote. There are also [[microphone]]s that plug into the [[USB]] port on the back of the Wii console. 
 
 ==== Wheel ==== 
 There is also a plastic wheel. These came with ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' and other racing or car driving games. The Wii remote goes into the middle of the wheel. There are some built-in buttons on the wheel to make it easier to reach the buttons on the remote. 
 
 ==Models== 
 ===Wii Family Edition=== 
 A revision of the Wii (also called the '''RVL-101''') that was released near the end of its lifecycle was announced on August 17, 2011. This model is designed to only sit horizontally (with the buttons changed accordingly) and is incompatible with the Nintendo GameCube's software and its accessories. This model was released in North America on October 23, 2011, in Europe on November 4, 2011, and in Australia on November 11, 2011. It was not released in any Asian countries. The Wii Family Edition includes a black console, the game ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', and the ''[[Super Mario Galaxy|Super Mario Galaxy: Original Soundtrack]]''. 
 
 ===Wii Mini===

 Another late-cycle revision of the Wii (also called the '''RVL-201''') was announced on November 27, 2012. < ref > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Nintendo reveals Wii Mini game machine|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/ingame/nintendo-reveals-wii-mini-game-machine-1C7280227|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216175839/http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/ingame/nintendo-reveals-wii-mini-game-machine-1C7280227|archive-date=2013-02-16|access-date=|website=NBC News}} < /ref >  As its name suggests, the Wii Mini is the smallest model of the Wii. Like the Family Edition, it is not compatible with GameCube games or its accessories. In addition, it also does not have online features and several built-in channels, such as the Photo Channel and the Weather Channel, similar to the Wii Mode on the Wii U. It also can only sit horizontally. The main feature is its notable redesign. Unlike the original Wii and Family Edition, which are mostly white, the Wii Mini is black with a red frame. All the buttons are located on the top of the console, and it lacks online support for Wii games. Additionally, the Wii Mini has a manually operated top-loading disc drive (similar to that of the GameCube) instead of the slots that former models have. The console launched in [[Canada]] on December 7, 2012 for $99.99. It was then released in Europe on March 15, 2013 at a cost of at least $79.99. It was then launched in the UK on March 22, 2013 for $99.99. It was finally launched in North America on November 17, 2013, bundled with a red Wii Remote Plus and a red Nunchuk for $99.99. Like its predecessor, the Wii Mini was not released in any Asian countries and it was not released in Australia either. The Wii Mini is the third home Nintendo console since the SNES and NES to receive a redesign right after their respective successors launched though the NES 101 model launched two years after the SNES launched. The N64 received no redesigns of any kind, and the GameCube had a small revision that lacked the unused Serial Port 2 (though the cover still remains) and the unpopular Digital AV Out port.
