 '''Anthocyanin''' is a [[chemical compound]] which makes the red colour in plants. For example, red [[cabbage]] has anthocyanins which make it red.

 In [[flowers]], bright-reds and purples attract [[pollination|pollinators]]. In [[fruits]], the colourful skins also attract the attention of animals, which may eat the fruits and disperse the [[seeds]]. 
 
 In [[photosynthetic]] tissues (such as leaves and sometimes stems), anthocyanins have been shown to act as a  " sunscreen " . They protect cells from high-light damage by absorbing blue-green and ultraviolet light. [[ionization|Ionizing]] [[radiation]] can damage [[DNA]]. 
 
 There are some other suggestions. The red colour of leaves may [[camouflage]] leaves from [[herbivores]] blind to red wavelengths. The pigment may signal bad taste, since anthocyanin synthesis often comes with unpalatable [[phenol]]ic compounds. < ref name=Jack > {{Cite journal |url= http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/samples/Science273anthocyanin.htm |author= Jack Sullivan |title= Anthocyanin |date= 1998 |journal= Carnivorous Plant Newsletter (CPN) September 1998 |access-date= 6 October 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091101035706/http://www.carnivorousplants.org/cpn/samples/Science273anthocyanin.htm |archive-date= 1 November 2009 | url-status= live}} < /ref > 
 
 Making these [[pigments]] is done by a series of [[enzymes]] that are stuck on [[cell membranes]]. < ref name=Jack/ >
