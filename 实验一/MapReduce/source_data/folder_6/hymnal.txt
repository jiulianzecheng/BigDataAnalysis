 A '''hymnal''' is a collection of [[Hymn|hymns]]. All the people ( " the [[congregation]] " ) usually sing some of these hymns, during a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Mass (liturgy)|religious service]]. A hymnal is different form a [[song book]]; each group has its own hymnal. Groups who aren't [[Religion|religious]] also have hymnals: there's one for [[Scouting|scouts]], there are hymals for different student associations, or for [[Soldier|soldiers]].  
 
 Hymnals usually contain the text of the hymn, and sometimes there are [[Sheet music|scores]] (which render the [[melody]]). For hymns that are well-known, the score may be missing.
