The word '''independence''' means  " not dependent " , or not having to depend on anyone or anything else. It also means being strong and able to survive alone. Anything can be dependent or independent. When people talk about independence, it may be about [[wikt:people|people]] or [[country|countries]], where it is often being spoken about as a good thing. For places, it may mean [[sovereignty]] or [[autonomy]]. In [[science]], as in ''[[independent variable]]'' the word does not mean it is good or bad.   
 
 == In countries == 
 A [[country]] gets its independence when it is no longer part of another country. Sometimes countries get their independence in a [[war]], as when the [[United States]] left the [[British Empire]] in the [[American War of Independence]]. Countries can also get their independence [[peace]]fully, like [[Canada]] and [[Norway]] did. Help from another country may be needed to get independence, like in [[World War II]], when the [[Allies of World War II|allies]] freed many countries that had been controlled by the [[Axis powers]] and, temporarily, vice versa. Attempts to gain independence may lead to [[civil war]] and may be unsuccessful.  
 
 === Examples === 
 [[Singapore]] gained independence from [[Malaysia]] in 1965. The newest country to get its independence was [[South Sudan]].  Other countries that became independent not long ago are [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1992, [[Eritrea]] in [[1993]] and [[East Timor]] in 2002. However, some countries have [[political party|political parties]] that discuss whether their country should become independent. Some examples of these are the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) or the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Independence Party (PIP).
