 == History == 
 
 The village is first mentioned (as  " Sperlingua " ) in a document belonging to the Norman [[Roger I of Sicily|Count Roger]] from 1082.{{r|amico|page=542}} The castle is first mentioned in 1113.{{r|leone}} 
 
 It is believed that Sperlinga did not take part in the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the bloody uprising against the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] French rulers of Sicily in 1282. The village may have offered them protection. There was an inscription over a door in the castle which read {{lang|lt|quod Siculis placuit sola Sperlinga negavit}},{{r|leone}}, meaning  " what pleased the Sicilians, only Sperlinga denied " . 
 
 From about 1360 Sperlinga was ruled by the [[House of Ventimiglia|Ventimiglia family]].{{r|amico|page=542}} In 1597 it was sold for 30,834 [[Troy ounce|ounces of gold]] to [[Giovanni Natoli]]. {{r|amico|page=542}} Natoli was granted a ''licentia populandi'' or  " licence to populate "  by the king of Sicily, [[Philip II of Spain]],{{r|leone}} and was made Prince of Sperlinga in 1627.{{r|amico|page=542}} His son Francesco sold Sperlinga in 1656 to Giovanni Stefano Oneto, but kept the princely title. Oneto was made Duke of Sperlinga in 1666 by [[Charles II of Spain]].{{r|amico|page=542}} 
 
 During the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], in the [[Second World War]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces moved past Sperlinga to [[Envelopment|envelop]] [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]], a few kilometres to the south. They met strong resistance. After a show of force by American tanks, the [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces withdrew from Sperlinga and Nicosia during the night of 27 July 1943. Units of the American [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry Regiment]] entered Sperlinga the next morning. < ref > {{citation |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-MTO-Sicily/USA-MTO-Sicily-16.html |title=Chapter XVI The Drive to the East  |work=Sicily and the Surrender of Italy |series=US Army in World War II |last=Garland and Smith |page=314}} < /ref >
