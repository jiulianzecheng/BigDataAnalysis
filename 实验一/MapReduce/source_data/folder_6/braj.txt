 '''Braj''' (ब्रज) also known as '''Brij''' (बृज) is a region mainly in [[Uttar Pradesh]] of [[India]], around [[Mathura district|Mathura]]-[[Vrindavan]]. Brij, though never a clearly defined political region in India, is very well demarcated culturally. The area stretches from Mathura, Jalesar, Agra, Hathras and Aligarh right up to Etah, Mainpuri and Farrukhabad districts. < ref name= " LuciaMichelutti1 " > {{cite web | url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/2106/1/U613338.pdf | title=Sons of Krishna: the politics of Yadav community formation in a North Indian town | publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science University of London | work=PhD Thesis Social Anthropology | date=2002 | access-date=20 May 2015 | author=Lucia Michelutti | pages=49}} < /ref >    It is considered to be the land of [[Krishna]] and is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vraja''.
