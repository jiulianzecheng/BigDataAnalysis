 In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ratatoskr''' is a [[squirrel]] that lives on the tree [[Yggdrasil]]. Ratatoskr carries messages between the eagle at the top of  Yggdrasil, and the [[serpent]] [[Níðhöggr]], at the bottom. Ratatoskr occurs both in the ''Poetic Edda'' and the ''Prose Edda''. The ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' is a collection of earlier stories. It was written in the 13th century. The ''[[Prose Edda]]'' was also written in the 13th century.

 In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]'') says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and Níðhöggr below it:

 < blockquote > An eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg. < ref name= " BYOCK26 " > Byock (2005:26). < /ref > < /blockquote >
