 == Practice == 
 Crofting is a traditional social system in Scotland defined by small-scale food production. It is a group of common working communities, or  " townships " . Individual crofts are typically established on {{convert|2|-|5|ha|frac=2}} of [[wikt:inbye|in-bye]] < ref > Pertaining to the direction towards the house. < /ref >  for better quality forage, arable and vegetable production. Each township manages poorer-quality hill ground as common grazing for cattle and sheep. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ2lBgAAQBAJ|title=Land, Faith and the Crofting Community: Christianity and Social Criticism in the Highlands of Scotland, 1843-1893|last=MacColl|first=Allan W.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748623822|language=en}} < /ref >

 == Requirements == 
 [[Tenant farming|Tenants]] and owner-occupier crofters are required to comply with a range of duties specified in sections 5AA to 5C and 19C of the [[Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993]]. There is a requirement to be ordinarily resident within 32 & nbsp;km of the croft. If the croft is the sole dwelling and the crofter's family are resident while the croft is away this would probably be accepted as ordinarily resident. Other situations involving other places of residence would need to be assessed individually. In addition to the duty of residence tenants and owner occupier crofters are required to ensure the croft is cultivated, maintained and not neglected or misused. < ref > {{cite web|title=Crofting Commission - FAQ|url=https://www.crofting.scotland.gov.uk/faq}} < /ref >
