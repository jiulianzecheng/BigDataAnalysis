 '''Uenuku''' is a [[Deity|god]] of [[rainbow]]s and important [[ancestor]] in [[Māori people|Māori]] [[oral]] histories. Uenuku simply means 'rainbow'. < ref name= " Uenuku " > {{cite web| url=https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/8861| title=Uenuku – Māori Dictionary| publisher=[[John Moorfield|John C Moorfield]]| access-date=13 April 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 Uenuku is special to the [[Ngāpuhi]], [[Ngāti Kahungunu]], [[Ngāti Porou]], [[Ngāi Tahu]], and [[Ngāi Tūhoe]] Māori [[tribe]]s. He is also known to two groups of tribes called [[Kurahaupō]] and [[Tainui]]. The [[Te Arawa]] group of tribes also know of him. Some of these tribes may also say he is a god of [[war]]. < ref name=tearagods > {{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/traditional-maori-religion-nga-karakia-a-te-maori/page-1|title=Ngā atua – the gods|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=13 April 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Geoff Murphy]] made his first [[movie]] in 1974, which was based on Uenuku's story. It was the first [[Television|TV]] [[movie#genres|drama]] to be entirely spoken in the [[Māori language]]. < ref name= " Film " > {{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/uenuku-1974|title=Uenuku - Television|work=[[NZ On Screen]]|access-date=21 September 2013}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Chief of Hawaiki== 
 The tribes of Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu, and probably Ngāti Kahungunu say Chief Uenuku of [[Hawaiki]] was their ancestor. < ref name= " Tainui " > {{cite web|url=http://jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_55_1946/Volume_55%2C_No._3/Ngai-Tahu%3A_notes_relating_to%2C_by_Rahera_Tainui%2C_p_221-235/p1|title=Ngai-Tahu, Notes Relating to, By Rahera Tainui, P 221-235|publisher=Journal of the Polynesian Society|access-date=11 April 2020|archive-date=28 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928132416/http://jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_55_1946/Volume_55%2C_No._3/Ngai-Tahu%3A_notes_relating_to%2C_by_Rahera_Tainui%2C_p_221-235/p1|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  He was the father of about 70 sons. His eldest son [[Ruatapu]] killed Hawaiki's [[nobility]] when he was [[shame]]d for trying to use a [[sacred]] [[comb]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao40TeA/c5.html|title=The Story of Paikea and Ruatapu|publisher=Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|access-date=15 April 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 In Te Arawa stories, [[Tamatekapua]] and his brother Whakaturia stole [[fruit]] from Chief Uenuku of Hawaiki. 
 
 In the [[Cook Islands]], Uanuku Rakeiora is said to be an important chiefly ancestor from [[Raiatea Island]] in [[French Polynesia]] over 27 generations ago, who was descended from Iro-nui-ma-Oata. < ref name= " TKoro " > {{cite web |url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/moolelo/ruatapu.html |title=Timi Koro, Trans. by Drury Low, from the Journal of the Polynesian Society, Vol. 43, 1934 |last=Koro |first=Timi |date=1934 |publisher= Polynesian Society|pages=171-186, 258-266 |access-date=15 April 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Uenuku's wife== 
 In the stories mostly known to Ngāi Tūhoe, but which also belong to Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kahungunu of [[Wairoa]], < ref name= " TeAo " > {{cite web|url=http://teaohou.natlib.govt.nz/journals/teaohou/issue/Mao48TeA/c7.html|title=THE MAORI MAGAZINE [electronic resource]|publisher=Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa - National Library of New Zealand|access-date=5 May 2020}} < /ref >  Uenuku was once [[human]]. One early morning he went out hunting. In a clearing he found two women. One was named Hine-pūkohu-rangi (sometimes called Tairi-a-kohu). The other was her sister, named Hine-wai. < ref name= " NZETC " > {{cite web |title=The Origin of the Rainbow |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesMaor-c3-7.html |website=New Zealand Electronic Text Collection |publisher=Victoria University |access-date=7 November 2018}} < /ref >  He asked Hine-pūkohu-rangi to stay and talk with him, and to return the next night. Since she lived in the sky, she had to leave him at dawn when her sister Hine-wai called her. She kept coming back night after night, and they fell in love. Eventually, she agreed to marry him so long as he promised that he tell no one about her.

 They were happy for many months, though she still only came to him at night and left at dawn. In time she became [[pregnant]]. No one else could see her, though, and therefore he was [[wikt:mock#verb|mocked]] by the people around him. They grew suspicious of this wife they had never seen, < ref name= " NZETC " / >  and the daughter who in some tellings was already born. < ref name= " Fables " > {{cite web|url=http://www.fables.org/winter03/mist_maiden.html|title=Uenuku and the Mist Maiden|publisher=Meredith Miller Memorial Internet Project|access-date=21 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403195330/http://www.fables.org/winter03/mist_maiden.html|archive-date=2007-04-03}} < /ref >  He tried to tell them that his wife left him each morning at first light, so they suggested that he should block up the doors and windows so she could not see the sun. Finally after more mockery, he was [[wikt:convince|convinced]] to block the sunlight after she came to him, so that she could not see the sun in the morning, then he could prove she existed. That night, Uenuku blocked all the places in his house that would shine the daylight. In the morning, she felt betrayed when she realised he had tricked her. She went back to the sky and left him for as long as he lived. < ref name= " NZETC " / > 
   
 Uenuku wandered the world searching for his wife. He searched until he was old and frail. [[Rangi and Papa|Rangi]] the sky father noticed this and took pity on Uenuku, and changed him into a rainbow so that he could join his family in the sky, < ref name= " NZETC " / >  where they still live to this day and watch over their [[wikt:descendant|descendants]]. < ref name= " Fables " / > 
 
 The tribes of the ''Kurahaupō'' in [[Marlborough, New Zealand|Marlborough]] canoe know the mountain [[Tapuae-o-Uenuku]] (which means 'footprint of the rainbow') on the [[Kaikōura Ranges]] as being the place where Chief Tapuae-nuku climbed the rainbow steps of his war-god ancestor Uenuku. They both climbed and died on top of mountains in search of their [[supernatural]] wives. < ref > {{ReedPlacenames1975}} < /ref > < ref name= " issuu " > {{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/shaneorchard/docs/nzaj_2011_34-37_inland_kaikouras|title=Tapuae o Uenuku and the Insland Kaikouras by Shane Orchard|publisher=Issuu|access-date=5 May 2020}} < /ref >  Uenuku became a set of mountains with his wife and daughter, and Chief Tapuae-nuku joined his own wife and daughter in the afterlife. When a rainbow appears over Tapuae-o-Uenuku, it is said to be a sign of Chief Tapuae-nuku's journey. < ref name= " Stuff " > {{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/107932950/ancient-marlborough-stories-brought-to-life-in-new-books|title=Ancient Marlborough stories brought to life in new books|date=19 October 2018|publisher=Stuff|access-date=5 May 2020}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Artifacts== 
 According to legend, the [[spirit]] of Uenuku was brought from Hawaiki to [[New Zealand]] in a [[stone]] by the people on the [[Tainui canoe]]. When they landed, they made the large [[carving]] called ''[[Te Uenuku]]'' out of a [[Podocarpus totara|tōtara tree]] with a round opening at the top, in which the stone was placed so that the god could live in the carving. < ref name= " TAMphoto " > {{cite web|url=https://collection.tamuseum.org.nz/objects/3126/uenuku|title=Uenuku|publisher=Te Awamutu Museum|access-date=13 April 2020}} < !--old url (http://collections.tamuseum.org.nz/search.do?id=671 & db=object & page=1 & view=detail) is dead-- > < /ref >  It is [[wikt:unique|unique]] among other Māori carvings, and looks similar to [[Hawaiian]] carving styles. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/object/27074/uenuku|title=Uenuku – Waikato region|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=13 April 2020}} < /ref >
