 '''Dolomite''' is the name of a [[sedimentary]] [[carbonate]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and a [[mineral]], both composed of [[calcium]] [[magnesium]] [[carbonate]] [[calcium|Ca]][[magnesium|Mg]]([[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]] < sub > 3 < /sub > ) < sub > 2 < /sub >   
 
 As a mineral, it is found in [[crystal]]s. Dolomite rock  (or 'dolostone') is mostly made of the mineral dolomite.  
 
 [[Limestone]] that is partially replaced by dolomite is referred to as ''dolomitic limestone''. In the old U.S. geologic literature it is called ''magnesian limestone''. Dolomite was first described in 1791 for exposures in the [[Dolomite Alps]] of northern [[Italy]].
