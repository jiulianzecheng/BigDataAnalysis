 Sedimentary rocks cover most of the [[Earth]]'s surface, record much of the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], and contain the [[fossil record]]. Sedimentology is closely linked to [[stratigraphy]], which is the study of the physical and temporal (time) relationships between rock layers or [[stratum|strata]]. 
 
 The idea that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is called [[uniformitarianism]]. It is the basis for finding out how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern [[sand dune]]s to dunes preserved in ancient [[wikt:aeolian|aeolian]] sandstones—geologists reconstruct past [[environments]].
