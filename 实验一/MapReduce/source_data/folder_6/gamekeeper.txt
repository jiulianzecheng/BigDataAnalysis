 A '''gamekeeper''' is a person who manages an area of [[countryside]] to make sure there is enough game for shooting, or fish for angling. He actively manages areas of [[woodland]], moorland, [[waterway]] or farmland for the benefit of game birds, [[deer]], [[fish]] and wildlife in general.  
 
 In the [[UK]], a gamekeeper is typically employed by a [[landowner]]. He ofen works on a country [[estate]]. It is his job to prevent [[poaching]], and to rear and release game birds such as [[pheasant]]s and [[partridge]]. He eradicates pests, encourages and manages [[grouse]], and controls predators such as [[fox]]es. He manages habitats to suit game, and monitors the health of the game.
