[[File:Combined Task Force 151 - 090211-N-1082Z-111.jpg|thumb|Suspected [[pirate]]s keep their hands up.]]'''Counter-terrorism''', also spelled as '''counterterrorism''', is work to prevent and fight against [[terrorism]]. Counter-terrorism is usually done by [[government]]s, [[military|militaries]], [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]], [[police]] forces, and special counter-terrorism units. 
 
 There are many different ways to do counter-terrorism. An important goal is to stop terrorism before it happens. This is done by trying to find out about plans to commit terrorism. If the plan is discovered, sometimes the terrorists can be arrested or [[security]] can be sent to protect the target of the terrorism. 
 
 Sometimes no one finds out about the terrorist plot until it starts to happen. When this happens, [[police]] or counter-terrorist [[soldier]]s may be sent to try and stop the terrorists from completing the plan, which usually leads to [[combat]].  
 
 Counter-terrorists are also a playable team in the video game [[Counter-Strike]] and the subsequent sequels.
