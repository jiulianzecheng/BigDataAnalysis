 '''Trance''' describes a state of mind. A trance is when a person is [[conscious]], and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her. 
 
 The term ''trance'' is associated with [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[magic]], [[flow (psychology)|flow]], [[religion]], and certain kinds of music. It is an  " [[altered state of consciousness]] " . < ref > Tart, Charles T. 2001. ''States of consciousness''. {{ISBN|0-595-15196-5}} < /ref > < ref > Inglis, Brian 1990.

 There are many efforts to define what a trance is. < ref > Wier, Dennis R. 1995.

 The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information. 
 
 Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. < ref > Warren, Jeff 2007. The Daydream in ''The head trip: adventures on the wheel of consciousness''. Toronto: Random House. {{ISBN|978-0-679-31408-0}} < /ref >  Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called  " dissociation " . Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream. < ref > Brain's problem-solving function at work when we daydream.

 There are many examples of trance in religion. [[African]] animistic religions, such as that of the [[Yoruba]], feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. < ref > Gonzales-Whippler, Migene 1982.
