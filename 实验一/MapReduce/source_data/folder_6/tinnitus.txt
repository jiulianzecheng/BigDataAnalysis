'''Tinnitus''' is a symptom of [[Deafness|hearing loss]] and other hearing problems. It is described as hearing [[sound]] in the head or ears that does not come from an outside source. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Tinnitus: Characteristics, Causes, Mechanisms, and Treatments.|journal=Journal of Clinical Neurology (Seoul, Korea)|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=11â€“19|doi=10.3988/jcn.2009.5.1.11|pmid=19513328|pmc=2686891|url=http://doi.org/10.3988/jcn.2009.5.1.11|access-date=20 September 2016|last1=Han|first1=Byung In|last2=Lee|first2=Ho Won|last3=Kim|first3=Tae You|last4=Lim|first4=Jun Seong|last5=Shin|first5=Kyoung Sik}} < /ref >  Many people will hear ringing, buzzing, hissing or whistling sounds, but tinnitus can be other sounds such as roaring and humming as well.   
 
 Different people will hear different sounds from tinnitus but how they hear it can also be different. Tinnitus can be loud or quiet and it can be continuous or occasional and some people will not notice their tinnitus but some people become very annoyed from it, especially when they feel tired or stressed. 
   
 There are many things that can cause people to get tinnitus. These are the main reasons: 
 *Listening to loud noises  
 *Extreme stress 
 *Old age  
 *Some diseases  
 *Some medicines 
 
 == Treatments and therapies == 
 People of different range of age can develop tinnitus. It is not a disorder but the symptom of some underlying health condition. 
 
 People with tinnitus may take part in [[yoga]], [[exercise]] regularly, perform sound therapies or join a tinnitus community .  Playing a faint background noise in the background also helps in keeping the phantom noise at bay.
