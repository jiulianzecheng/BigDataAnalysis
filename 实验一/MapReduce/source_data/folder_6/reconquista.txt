The '''Reconquista''' (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for  " Reconquest " ; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الاسترداد,  " Recapturing " ) was a period of 800 years in the [[Middle Ages]] during which the several [[Christianity|Christian]] kingdoms of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] expanded themselves (grew) by conquering the [[Islam|Muslim]] states of [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] الأندلس), the Muslim states on the Iberian Peninsula, and pushing them out of the peninsula. 
 
 The Reconquista began shortly after the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest]]. Much of the [[ideology]] of the Reconquista was common to most [[Crusades|Crusading]]: soldiers from all [[Christendom]] travelled to Iberia to fight the Muslims as an act of Christian [[repentance]]. 
 
 The Reconquista came to an end on the [[2 January]] [[1492]] with the [[Battle of Granada|capture of Granada]]. The last Muslim ruler of [[Granada]] [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]] (gave up) his kingdom to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], the Catholic kings (''los Reyes Católicos''). This event marked the end of Muslim rule in Iberia.
