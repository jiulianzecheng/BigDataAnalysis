 '''Alkyl''' is a group of [[organic|chemicals with carbon atoms]]. They are like [[alkane]]s but they have one fewer hydrogen atom. An alkyl is a [[functional group|piece of a molecule that makes it do or act a certain way]]. Alkyls have only carbon and hydrogen atoms, in a chain. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Glossary: Alkyl group|url=https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/abc/alkyl-group-alkylation-alkylate.htm#:~:text=An%20alkyl%20is%20a%20functional,5%20(derived%20from%20butane).|access-date=2021-04-08|website=www.greenfacts.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|date=2015-05-03|title=3.3: Alkyl Groups|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_(McMurry)/03%3A_Organic_Compounds-_Alkanes_and_Their_Stereochemistry/3.03%3A_Alkyl_Groups|access-date=2021-04-08|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 Alkyl groups have this formula: C < subs > n < /subs > H < subs > 2n+1 < /subs > , where n can be any number so long as it is the same one. (For example, if there are two carbons, there must be four hydrogens because 2*2=4.)
