 A '''landscape''' means an area of land as one can see it. This includes [[landform]]s, [[flora]], [[animal|fauna]] and human elements, for instance human activity or the built environment. 
 
 According to its meaning, lighting and weather conditions are part of landscape as well. Objects inside the building can sometimes be considered part of landscape as well. 
 
 == Geology == 
 The landscape is determined mainly by the underlying geology. This can be seen clearly in the [[East Africa]]n [[Great Rift Valley]]. There almost everything in the landscape is caused by or connected with the pulling apart of Africa which is happening there. Even in [[Great Britain]], a geologically quiet place, the whole landscape can be understood by understanding its geological past. < ref name=Fortey > Fortey, Richard 1993.

 ==Etymology== 
 The word was borrowed as a painters' term from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] < ref > The  word ''landschap'', came from ''land'' (patch or area that comes from the Basquish word ''landa'' meaning labored earth) and the suffix ''-schap'', corresponding to the [[English language|English]] suffix  " -ship " . < /ref >  during the 16th century, when Dutch artists began to become masters of the landscape genre. The Dutch word ''landschap'' had earlier meant simply “region, tract of land” but now meant “a picture depicting scenery on land”. < ref > The English word ''landscape'' was first recorded in 1598. 34 years passed before the word is used of a view or vista of natural scenery. This delay suggests that people were first introduced to landscapes in paintings and then landscapes in real life. < /ref >
