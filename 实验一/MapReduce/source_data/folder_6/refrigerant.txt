 A '''refrigerant''' is a [[chemical substance]] that is found in an [[air conditioner]], a [[refrigerator]], and in other refrigeration equipment. Refrigerants are chosen for the ease of converting them from [[liquid]] to [[vapor]] or vice versa, depending on their temperature and pressure. Most refrigerants in their liquid state will [[evaporate]] very fast if at [[atmospheric pressure]]. They can be classed as [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]], [[hydrochlorofluorocarbon|HCFC]], [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFC]], [[Hydrocarbon|HC]], or [[Hydrofluoroolefin|HFO]] along with less common types. 
 
 In refrigeration equipment, a refrigerant vapor is compressed by a [[compressor]]. Compression makes it hot. It enters a [[condenser]], where it condenses into a liquid.  The refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device, or an expansion device (there are several types of this part) where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil. At this point, the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an [[evaporator]], where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it. By the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator, it is all a vapor again, and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again. This is called the refrigeration cycle. This is one example of the use of a refrigerant, in a residential air conditioning system. 
 
 ==Phase out of chlorine-based refrigerants== 
 Older [[chlorine]] based refrigerants such as [[R22]] have been phased out due to [[ozone depletion]]. The chlorine molecule in them was found to be depleting the [[ozone]] molecules in the atmosphere.  < ref > {{cite web
