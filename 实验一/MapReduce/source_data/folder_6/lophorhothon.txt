 '''''Lophorhothon''''' (Langston, 1960) is a [[genus]] of [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurid]] [[dinosaur]] from the [[Late Cretaceous]], the first genus of dinosaur discovered in [[Alabama]], in the [[United States]]. 
 
 == Discovery and naming == 
 Remains of this small, poorly known perhaps [[Hadrosaurid|saurolophine]] dinosaur were first discovered during the 1940s, from extensive erosional outcrops of the lower unnamed member of the Mooreville Chalk Formation in [[Dallas County, Alabama|Dallas County]], west of the town of [[Selma, Alabama]]. 
 
 == Taxonomic status == 
 A number of workers have questioned the validity of ''L. atopus''. It may have been a premature ''[[Prosaurolophus]]''. 
 
 == Holotype == 
 The holotype specimen was likely washed out to sea by a river, where it eventually sank and was buried in the silty [[carbonate]] sediments of Alabama.
