 '''Hunting''' is going out to find and kill [[animal]]s. Animals and some [[human]]s, hunt [[predation|for food]]. People have hunted at least since the [[stone age]]. They used [[spear]] < nowiki/ > s, and now people mostly use [[gun]]s and [[bow]]s. Some people kill the animals for [[fur]], to make clothes and shelter, or to decorate their homes, or to sell. [[Fox]] hunting is sometimes a [[sport]]. 
 
 Many places have rules that limit hunting. Hunting can be good by keeping animal populations from getting too high. Hunting too much, though, can kill off species of animals, making them [[extinct]]. Hunting once made the [[dodo]], a bird, become extinct. 
 
 Before they invented [[herding]] people got [[meat]] by hunting.  Boar hunting and fox hunting became became popular in early modern times.  Another form of hunting is not to use guns, bows and arrows or spears, but by [[animal trapping]].    
 
 [[Animal rights]] activists oppose to hunting. Anti-hunting laws (English Hunting Act 2004) strive to reduce hunting.
