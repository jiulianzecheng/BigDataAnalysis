 ==The Bob McAllister years== 
 Despite the frequent turnover of hosts throughout the 1950s, ''Wonderama'' experienced its greatest viewership by way of one-time [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] kids' show host Bob McAllister, who replaced Sonny Fox as host in 1967 and remained host until 1977. 
 
 Each show's taping included ''(but was not necessarily limited to)'' education, music, audience participation, games, interviews and cartoon shorts.   
 Each week, audience members received a package of parting gifts with some items, including: 
 *An [[Oral-B]] toothbrush 
 *An issue of [[Dynamite Magazine]] or Golden Magazine 
 *A supply of [[Good Humor]] ice cream 
 *A box of [[Twinkies|Hostess Twinkies]]

 *A tube of Hold! cough lozenges 
 *A package of [[Fruit Stripe]] Gum 
 *A gift certificate for [[Burger King]] or [[McDonald's]]

 *A [[45 record]] of one of the music artists who performed on the Wonderama episode each week. 
 
 McAllister  sang the program's closing theme song. It was called ''[[Kids Are People Too]]'' ( " wacka-doo, wacka-doo, wacka-doo " ). This later became the show's title when it moved to ABC on Sunday mornings.

 ==1980 revival== 
 Beginning in 1980, a documentary/magazine show for children (and hosted by teens) ran on Sunday mornings on WNEW-TV.  While this show maintained the ''Wonderama'' title, the show itself was nothing like the kids festival that it once was.  This hour-long incarnation ran until 1983; reruns edited to 30 minutes aired from 1984 to 1986 on WNEW-TV/WNYW on Saturday mornings.
