 ==History== 
 About 3000 years before, the [[Polynesians]] had settled in [[Tongatapu]]. < ref > {{cite video|title=湯加擁歷史三千年|work=有線寬頻|url=http://cablenews.i-cable.com/webapps/program/study/videoPlay.php?video_id=12122186|access-date=2014-01-28|archive-date=2020-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328010428/http://cablenews.i-cable.com/webapps/program/study/videoPlay.php?video_id=12122186|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In 1845, Tāufaʻāhau united Tonga into a kingdom. He declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy. Between 1845 and 1893, [[slavery]] was stopped. Also, [[constitution]] was made up. 
 
 In 1900, Tonga became a [[protected state]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. Tonga maintained its sovereignty. It remained the only Pacific nation never to have given up its monarchical government. Foreign affairs was managed by the UK. Tonga was no longer a protected state and became independent in 1970. Tonga joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1970. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] in September 1999. Tonga has never lost indigenous governance.
