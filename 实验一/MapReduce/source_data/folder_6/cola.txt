[[File:Cola2.JPG|thumb|Cola]] 
 '''Cola''' is a type of carbonated drink that was made from the [[kola nut]] in the past, although other foods are often used now. [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] are types of cola. 120 years ago, only 9 glasses of cola were sold each day, but now, around 14 million cola drinks are drunk in the world every day. 
 
 Cola is usually made cold in a [[Refrigerator|fridge]], so it can be more refreshing, and helps to retain its fizziness. Cola used to contain [[cocaine]] from the [[coca leaf]], but that was removed in 1886. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Coca Wine|url=https://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm|access-date=2023-12-15|website=www.cocaine.org}} < /ref > .
