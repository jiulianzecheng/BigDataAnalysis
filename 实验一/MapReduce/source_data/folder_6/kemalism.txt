 '''Kemalism''' is a [[political philosophy]] or [[ideology]] which was used when the [[Republic of Turkey]] was founded in 1923. It is named afer [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Atatürk defined six principles, which he called arrows: 
 *The new state should be a [[republic]], because that is the best form of government 
 *[[Laicism]] there should be a clear separation between religious beliefs and the state.  
 *[[Populism]]- the state must represent all the people, and not only a select group 
 *Revolutionism - reforms should be possible at any time 
 *[[Nationalism]] - not like the [[Osmanic Empire]] 
 *[[Statism]]- the state should have the power to direct or control a small part of the economy for a short time, if that is necessary 
 Since 2001, there are tendencies to give Islam a higher presence in society, and to make Kemallism less important.
