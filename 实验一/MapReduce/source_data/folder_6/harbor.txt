 A '''harbor''' ([[American English]]) or '''harbour''' ([[British English]]) is a place where [[ship]]s may shelter. Some harbours are used as [[port]] < nowiki/ > s to load and unload ships. The port will have quays or [[pier]]s where the ships may be moored or tied up and a [[transport]] system for taking goods inland. Often [[railway]] and road transport will be used. Goods also move by [[pipeline]] transport and by smaller ships on [[rivers]]. 
 
 Harbor means to shelter or keep safe. Harbors can be natural as in [[San Francisco]] or artificial as in ancient [[Carthage]] or a mix of both. During the [[D-Day]] operations of [[1944]], two artificial harbors (named mulberry) were built just off the [[beach]]es where the invasion was happening.
