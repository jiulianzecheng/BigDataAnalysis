 '''Bourgeoisie'''  < ref > [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] {{IPA|/ˌbɔː.ʒwɑːˈzi/}}, [[General American|GA]] {{IPA|/ˌbu(r).ʒwɑˈzi/}} < /ref >  means a [[social class]] of people who own the [[means of production]], making them in the [[upper class|upper]] or [[merchant]] class. Hence, all employers are bourgeoisie. Their [[status]] or power comes from employment, education, assets, or wealth and not from [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] (political) origin, as a lowly café or factory owner is bourgeoisie.  
 The term is widely used in many non-English speaking countries as an approximate equivalent of [[middle class]].    
 
 As the bourgeoisie are not its opposing counterpart [[proletariat]], they don't have to be a labourer doing menial work for money. And if they do any work that gets them money, then it's only because of the many proletariat people beneath them, who generated their wealth through their labour, of which the higher up bourgeoisie person took a cut (commission).    
 < ref > Mostly the word has negative [[connotation]]s. One thinks of undeserved wealth, or lifestyles, tastes, and opinions that are not accepted by the speaker. Therefore it is rare for people in the English speaking world to identify themselves as members of the bourgeoisie, although many self-identify as middle class. < /ref >
