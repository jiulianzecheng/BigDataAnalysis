 He is mostly known in the [[Indian subcontinent]] for the [[fable|folk tales]] which focus on his [[wit]]. < ref name= " Otto2001 Court Jester and world " / >  In the local folk tales he is presented as a very clever person. These tales are popular in [[India]]. These tales involve him being smarter then or making fool of other [[courtier]]s and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning. From the twentieth century onwards, plays, movies and books based on these folk tales were made. Some of these folk tales are in children's comics and school books.
