The '''Essenes''' were a Jewish group of holy people. They were a smaller group than the [[Sadducees]] or the [[Pharisees]].  The Essenes lived in various cities. They lived in communal life dedicated to [[asceticism]]. Many researchers believe the Essenes wrote the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/portrait/essenes.html|title=A Portrait of Jesus' World: The Essenes and the Dead Sea Scrolls|first=L.
