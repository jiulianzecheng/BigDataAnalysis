 == Versions == 
 === Old versions === 
 In old letters, ''Yours truly'' was often replaced with a longer sentence, for example: 
 
 :''I beg to remain, Sir, your most humble and obedient servant,'' 
 ::''A. Name'' 
 
 === Modern versions === 
 ''Yours sincerely'' is used when the person sending the letter knows the name of the person receiving the letter. 
 
 ''Yours faithfully'' is used when the person who is receiving the letter is not known by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as  " Dear Sir/Madam " ).

He will not be defeated  " until Birnam wood move to high Dunsinane " .
