 == Gang identification == 
 Gang members often use [[graffiti]] to tell other gangs that an area is part of their  " territory "  and that other gangs should stay away. Marking territory, usually with spray paint, is sometimes called  " tagging, "  however tagging usually means messages by one person, called a tagger. Tagger graffiti promotes the individual and is usually more artistic. < ref > {{cite web |title=Graffiti |url=https://www.houstontx.gov/mogpi/graffiti.html |website=www.houstontx.gov |publisher=City of Houston, Texas, USA |accessdate=1 July 2023}} < /ref >  As well as being a “no trespassing” sign telling rival crews to stay away, gang graffiti can send other messages.
