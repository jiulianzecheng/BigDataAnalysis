'''Chatroulette''' is a [[webcam]] [[web chat|chatting]] site founded by [[Andrei Ternowski]] in November 2009. Two people are [[random]]ly connected. At any time, one of the people can end the chat by pressing [[F9]] on their keyboard. According to Robert J. Moore, the [[CEO]] and co-founder of [[RJMetrics]], about 1 in 8 people are either [[naked]] or [[wikt:lewd|lewd]]. < ref name=techcrunch1 / >   Many people think children should not use it. Since December 2012, users can only use their webcam if they have had at least 3 conversations that lasted 10 minutes or longer. If a user didn't do that yet, their webcam will display a picture. Also, a person has to register before using it. If someone acts strange or offends another person, you can report him/her by  keyboard.
