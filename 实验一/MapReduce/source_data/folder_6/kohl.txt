 '''Kohl''' is an ancient eye [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]], traditionally made by grinding [[stibnite]] (Sb < sub > 2 < /sub > S < sub > 3 < /sub > ). It is widely used in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and [[South Asia]] as [[eye liner]], < ref > Eyeliner video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L644Lt2_xmQ < /ref >  to contour and/or darken the eyelids, and as [[mascara]] for the eyelashes. It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children. 
 
 Kohl is very ancient, and is seen in depictions of high status women and godesses in [[Ancient Egypt]]. It has also been used in [[India]] as a cosmetic for a long time.  
 
 The content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly. In North Africa and Middle East, homemade kohl is often made by grinding [[galena]] ([[lead sulfide]]). In the west, [[soot]] or organic [[charcoal]] may be used instead of lead. [[Plant]] oils and the soot from various nuts, seeds, and [[gum arabic|gum]] [[resin]]s are often added to the [[carbon]] [[powder]]. < ref name= " hardy cairo " > Hardy A; Walton R.  &  Vaishnav R. 2004. ''Composition of eye cosmetics (kohls) used in Cairo.'' Int J Environ Health Res. '''14'''(1):83â€“91. < /ref >  Unfortunately, the non-lead products do not give such a good result as the older, traditional varieties. Handmade, lead-based kohl continues to be popular.
