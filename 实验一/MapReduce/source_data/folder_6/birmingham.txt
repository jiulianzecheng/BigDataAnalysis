 == History == 
 [[File:Bell Edison Telephone Building.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] building in Birmingham, faced with [[terracotta]] [[tiles]]]] 
 
 Birmingham began as a small town in 1166.  
 [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] gave city status to Birmingham in 1889. 
 
 Many [[industry|industries]] were developed in Birmingham during the 18th and 19th centuries. These included making [[weapon]]s and food. 
 
 Birmingham manufacturing industry played a big role in the war effort in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The WWII [[spitfire]] aeroplane was made in Birmingham. In 2000, a statue of [[Sentinel (sculpture)|stylised spitfires]] was erected next to the old factory site. The factory now makes Jaguar cars. 
 Birmingham had a large car making industry. It has declined since the 1980s. It remains the home town for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Land Rover]] cars. 
 
 In 1974, twenty-one people were killed in the [[Birmingham pub bombings]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Birmingham bombings 40 years on: what can we learn from IRA terror?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11245150/The-Birmingham-bombings-40-years-on-what-can-we-learn-from-IRA-terror.html|access-date=2021-02-08|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 == Transport == 
 
 === Grand Union Canal === 
 Birmingham was an important stagine-post in the Victorian industrial [[canal]] system. Today it is the northern terminus of the [[Grand Union Canal]] to [[London]]. Heavy goods (as coal surely is) are most economically moved on water. No other form of transport is so efficient.  
 
 === Motorways === 
 [[File:Spaghetti-Junction-Crop.jpg|thumb|[[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]]]]The [[M40 motorway]] connects to London via [[Oxford]]. The [[M6 motorway]] also connects Birmingham to London (via the [[M1 motorway|M1]]) and to the north-west of England and Scotland. Junction 6 of the M6 is also one of Birmingham's landmarks, and probably the most notable motorway junction in the UK, [[Gravelly Hill Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]], officially called the Gravelly Hill Interchange. Other motorways are:  
 * The [[A38 road|A38(M)]] which links Spaghetti Junction to the city centre 
 *The [[M5 motorway|M5]], connecting Birmingham to the south-west of England 
 *The [[M42 motorway|M42]], which connects Birmingham to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and the [[East Midlands]] 
 *The [[M6 Toll]], which enables through traffic on the M6 to bypass Birmingham and [[Wolverhampton]]. 
 
 Birmingham, unlike London and [[Manchester]], does not have a single orbital motorway. Instead, three motorways form a box which surrounds most of the city. These are: 
 *The [[M42 motorway|M42]] to the south and east. In the middle, the [[M40 motorway|M40]] ends. It has priority for traffic going from the M40 to the M42 west. The M40 goes off south to [[Warwick]], [[Oxford]], [[High Wycombe]], [[Uxbridge]] and London. 
 *The [[M5 motorway|M5]] which forms the western section. 
 *The [[M6 motorway|M6]] which forms the northern section. The M5 ends on the M6. 
 [[File:A38(M) Aston Expressway.jpg|thumb|The [[A38(M) motorway|A38(M) Aston Expressway]]]] 
 Other major roads passing through Birmingham include: 
 *The [[A34 road (England)|A34]] from [[Manchester]] to [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] 
 *The [[A38 road|A38]] from [[Mansfield]] to [[Bodmin]] 
 *The [[A41 road|A41]] from London to [[Birkenhead]] 
 *The [[A45 road|A45]] from Birmingham to [[Thrapston]] (formerly to [[Felixstowe]]) 
 *The [[A47 road|A47]] from Birmingham to [[Great Yarmouth]] 
 *The [[A4540 road|A4540]] 'Middleway' ring road 
 *The [[A4040 road|A4040]] Outer Ring Road
