 The '''quince''' is a [[fruit]] that grows on small trees. It is in the same family as [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s. It starts green colored and then ripens to a bright golden yellow color, and looks like a bumpy [[lemon]]. 
 
 The quince fruit is too hard to eat.  It can be cooked to make it soft, or it can be left out on purpose to rot.  If it is damaged by frost, that helps start the process of making it soft and good to eat.  Quinces are mainly used for making [[jelly]] and [[jam]]. The interior of a quince is white when it is [[raw]], but it becomes [[pink]]ish [[Orange (color)|orange]] when it is cooked. When the jam is made it will be these colors
