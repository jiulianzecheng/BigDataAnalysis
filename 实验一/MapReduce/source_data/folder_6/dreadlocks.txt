 '''Dreadlocks''', also called '''locks''' or '''dreads''', are coils of [[hair]] which are made by themselves, in all hair types, if the hair is allowed to grow [[natural]]ly without [[groom]]ing for a long time. They are part of some religions, like the [[Rastafarian]] religion in [[Jamaica]]. People who do not have to have dreadlocks because of their religion sometimes have dreadlocks as well. A lot of them do not let their dreads form naturally, but make dreadlocks themselves. There are different ways in which people help their hair go together to form dreadlocks. Backcombing, braiding, and twisting are some of the different techniques used to form dreadlocks. 
 
 Dreadlocks are one kind of [[protective hairstyle]].  They can stop the hairs from breaking. < ref name=Good > {{cite magazine|magazine=Good Housekeeping|title=30 Stylish Protective Hairstyles We Love for Natural Hair|accessdate=July 2, 2021|url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/g34930701/protective-hairstyles-for-natural-hair/|author=Danielle James|date=December 24, 2020}} < /ref > < ref name=JDS > {{cite web|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/how-is-my-hair-a-brief-review-of-6355590/|title=How is My Hair?
