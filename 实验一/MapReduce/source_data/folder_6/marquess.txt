'''Marquess''' ('''marquis''' in [[French language|French]]) is a title of [[nobility]] in many countries in [[Europe]].  It is  a [[rank]] higher than an [[earl]] but lower than a [[duke]]. 'Marquis' is correct in [[France]], and 'Margrave' in [[Germany]] for a local ruler. 
 
 This title was usually granted by a [[monarch]] to reward a subject for longtime faithful service or some very notable deeds. The title is [[hereditary]], meaning that is passes from a father to his eldest son.  Usually if a man holding this title dies without having any male [[heir]]s, the title is said to become [[extinct]], meaning that it is no longer held by anyone living. 
 
 The female equivalent of this title may be styled '''marquess'''. This rank may be held by the wife of a marquis or granted to a woman in her own right. 
 A woman with the rank of marquess is called a marchioness in the U.K. and elsewhere a marquise.
