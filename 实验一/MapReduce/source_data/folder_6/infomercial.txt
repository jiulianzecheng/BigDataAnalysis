 An '''infomercial''' is a kind of [[advertisment]]. An infomercial is similar to a regular [[TV]] program, but it wants to promote a [[Product (business)|product]] or service. The word is made of two parts, ''information'' and ''commercial''. Very often there's a way to directly respond, like a [[toll-free telephone number]], or [[website]], where the items can be ordered. Informercials are designd to produce a direct response, that can be measured.  They are often pre-recorded. They are shown when there are few people watching television, for example during the night.

 * Very often [[Testimonial|testimonials]] are used. These are statements of people who bought the product, and who tell how happy they are with it.
