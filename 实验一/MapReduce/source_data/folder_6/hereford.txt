 '''Hereford''' (pronounced {{IPA|['hɛɹəfəd]}} or {{IPA|['hɛɹɪfəd]}}) {{lang-cy|Henffordd}} (pronounced {{IPA|['hεnfɔrð]}}  " Henforth " ) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] and [[civil parish]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of [[England]], close to the border with [[Wales]] and on the [[River Wye]]. It is the [[county town]] of [[Herefordshire]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Hereford: Queen of The Marches |url=https://britishheritage.com/travel/hereford-queen-marches |website=British Heritage |language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 The name ''Hereford'' comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] ''here'', meaning an army and ''ford'' which is a place where soldiers could cross. 
 
 Hereford has had a [[cathedral]] since 1059. 
 
 In 1997, Hereford Council lost its status as a city council, and had to appoint [[Charter Trustees]]. Its ancient city traditions are recognised and carried on by the parish council, which is led by the City Mayor.
