 '''Chester''' is a city in the north-west of [[England]]. It is almost 2000 [[year]]s old and was started by [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A person from Chester is called a '''Cestrian'''. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Visit Chester {{!}} The Official Tourism Site for Chester {{!}} Visitchester.com|url=https://www.visitcheshire.com/chester|access-date=2021-10-22|website=Visit Cheshire|language=en-GB}} < /ref > 
 
 Chester is on the river Dee, and is the [[county town]] of the county of [[Cheshire]]. It is near to the country [[Wales]]. Almost 120,000 people live in Chester. It is just south of [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]]. 
 
 During the Dark Ages, Chester came under attack from Viking raiders who sailed up the river in their longships. After the conquest of Britain by the [[Normans]] in 1066, [[William I of England|William I]] created the first Earl of Chester who began the construction of Chester Castle. 
 
 By the Middle Ages, Chester had become a wealthy trading port: it was at this time that the Rows were built. However disaster befell the city during the [[English Civil War]] as Chester was besieged for two years before starvation forced its people to surrender. As the centuries passed, the harbour gradually silted up and by Georgian times the port was virtually gone. Today some of the original quay can still be seen near the Chester Racecourse. 
 
 During Victorian times the magnificent gothic-style Town Hall was built and the Eastgate Clock was erected in honour of [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoriaâ€™s]] [[Diamond Jubilee]]. 
 
 Near to Chester is [[Chester Zoo]], which is the biggest zoo in the United Kingdom. There are other interesting places in Chester, and many are connected to its history.
