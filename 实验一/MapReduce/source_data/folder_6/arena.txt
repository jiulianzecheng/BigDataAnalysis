 An '''arena''' is a [[circular]] or [[oval]] shaped public space. It is [[wikt:similar|similar]] to a [[theater]], a [[concert]] or [[sporting event]]s. It is made up of a large open space surrounded on all sides by seats or benches for people to sit. The main feature of an arena is that the event space is the lowest point. This allows everyone to see what's going on. Sometimes, an arena is created to have a very large number of people, such as [[New York City]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]] or Pasadena's [[Rose Bowl]]. < ref > [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/2788214/The-lemon-Dome-that-was-transformed-into-O2s-concert-crown.html The lemon Dome that was transformed into O2's concert crown] < /ref >  In the [[United States]], the term 'arena', sometimes means an indoor [[stadium]].
