 A '''hydrazone''' is the [[functional group]] with structure R < sub > 1 < /sub > R < sub > 2 < /sub > C=NNH < sub > 2 < /sub > . They are like [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s, with an NNH < sub > 2 < /sub >  group instead of the [[oxygen]] atom. 
 
 They are made by [[chemical reaction|reacting]] [[hydrazine]]s with ketones or aldehydes:

 Hydrazones are very useful [[molecule]]s to do some reactions. For example, a ketone can be [[reduction|reduced]] down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with [[sodium ethoxide]] ([[Wolffâ€“Kishner reduction]]). Hydrazones are very important [[intermediate]]s in many reactions, such as the [[Fischer indole synthesis]]. This makes [[indole]]s, groups which are found in many [[drug]]s.
