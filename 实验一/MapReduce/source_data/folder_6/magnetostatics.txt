 '''Magnetostatics''' is the study of [[magnetic field]]s in systems where the [[electric current]]s are steady (not changing with time). < ref > Aharoni, Amikam 1996. ''Introduction to the theory of ferromagnetism''. Oxford:Clarendon Press. ISBN 0-19-851791-2 < /ref > 
 
 Magnetostatics is widely used in [[magnetic storage]] devices such as in [[computer memory]]. Magnetostatic focussing can be got by a [[permanent magnet]] or by passing a current through a coil of wire whose axis coincides with the beam axis.
