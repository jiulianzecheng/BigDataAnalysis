 '''Zoonosis''' or a '''zoonotic disease''' is an [[infectious disease]] which an animal can give to a human.  These diseases may be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], or [[parasite]]s. < ref name=cdc > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/zoonotic-diseases.html|title=Toxoplasmosis |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=October 18, 2013 |website=One Health |publisher=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=February 11, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref > 
 
 Zoonotic [[disease]]s are very common.  About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals. < ref > Taylor L.H; Latham S.M.  &  Woolhouse M.E.J. 2001. Risk factors for human disease emergence. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'' '''356''' (1411): 983–989. [http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1411/983] < /ref > 
 
 Zoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways.  They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human {{ndash}} for example, through bites and infected [[saliva]] (like with [[rabies]]), or through the air.  This is called ''direct zoonosis''. 
 
 Zoonotic diseases can also be spread through a [[vector (biology)|vector]].  This is an animal that carries the [[pathogen]] that causes the disease without getting infected.  Diseases like this are called ''vector-borne diseases''. 
 
 Sometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal.  For example, [[rat]]s who have the [[bubonic plague]] do not directly infect humans.  Instead, [[flea]]s bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick.  Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague. < ref name=plague > {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/ |title=Plague |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=November 2014 |website=WHO.int |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 11, 2016 |quote=}} < /ref >   The rat is the [[host (biology)|host]] of the disease, and the flea is the vector. 
 
 ==Types of zoonotic diseases== 
 ===Foodborne illnesses=== 
 Many foodborne illnesses are zoonotic diseases.  In these cases, a human gets infected by eating food that came from a sick animal, or one which had picked up a parasite. 
 
 The most common [[pathogen]]s that cause foodborne illnesses are ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') bacteria.  [[Egg (food)|Eggs]], [[seafood]], meat, [[poultry]], and [[dairy product]]s can all carry these bacteria and cause foodborne illnesses, like [[food poisoning]], in humans. < ref name=czpf > {{cite journal | author = Humphrey T|author2= O'Brien S | display-authors = etal|date= 2007 | title = Campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: A food production perspective | journal = International Journal of Food Microbiology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–257 | pmid = 17368847 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.01.006 }} < /ref > < ref name=iear > {{cite journal | author = Cloeckaert A 2006 | title = Introduction: emerging antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in the zoonotic foodborne pathogens Salmonella and Campylobacter | journal = Microbes and Infection | year = 2006 | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 1889–1890 | pmid = 16714136 | doi = 10.1016/j.micinf.2005.12.024 | url =  | author-link =  }} < /ref >

 Often, people can avoid foodborne illnesses by cooking meat, seafood, and eggs well enough to kill the bacteria or parasites in them. < ref name=cdc/ > 
 
 ===Direct zoonoses=== 
 Below are some examples of zoonotic diseases that humans can get directly from sick, live animals.
