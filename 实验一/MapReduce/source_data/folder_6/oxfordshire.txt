 '''Oxfordshire''' (short '''Oxon''', from the [[Latin]]ised form ''Oxonia'') is a [[county]] in the South East of [[England]], [[border]]ing on [[Northamptonshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Berkshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], and [[Warwickshire]]. 
 
 It is divided into five local government districts: [[Oxford]], [[Cherwell]], [[Vale of the White Horse]] (after the ''Uffington White Horse''), ''West Oxfordshire'' and ''South Oxfordshire''. 
 
 The county has a major [[tourism]] industry. The area is known for the concentration of motorsport companies and facilities. [[Oxford University Press]] has headed a concentration of print and publishing firms; the university is also linked to the concentration of local [[biotechnology]] companies. 
 
 The main centre of population is the city of [[Oxford]]. Other significant settlements are [[Bicester]], [[Banbury]], and [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] to the north of Oxford; [[Witney]] to the west; [[Thame]] and [[Chinnor]] to the east; and [[Abingdon, England|Abingdon]], [[Wantage]], [[Didcot]] and [[Henley-on-Thames]] to the south. Future population growth in the county is hoped to be concentrated around Banbury, Bicester, Didcot and Witney, near the [[South Midlands]] growth area. 
 
 The highest point of the county is [[Whitehorse Hill]], in the Vale of White Horse, reaching 856 & nbsp;feet (261m). 
 
 ==History== 
 The county of Oxfordshire was formed in the early years of the [[10th century]]. 
 
 Historically the area has always had some importance, it has been good agricultural land resting between the main southern cities and [[Oxford]] (whose name came from [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Oxenaford'' =  " ford for [[oxen]] " ). The area was part of the [[Cotswolds]] wool trade from the 13th century. The [[Great Western Railway]] reached [[Didcot]] in 1839. [[Morris Motor Company|Morris Motors]] was founded in Oxford in 1912 and [[MG (car)|MG]] in Abingdon in 1929. The importance of agriculture as an [[employer]] has gone down in the 20th century; today less than one percent of the county's population are involved. 
 
 The Vale of the White Horse and parts of South Oxfordshire south of the [[River Thames]] were historically part of [[Berkshire]], but were added to the administrative county in [[1974]].
