A '''punter''' ('''P''') is a position in [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]]. Punters are members of the special teams. Punts punt the ball away to the opposite team during a fourth (American) or Third (Canadian) down. The punter will sometimes do a fake punt and run or throw the ball. They can also fill in for a placekicker.
