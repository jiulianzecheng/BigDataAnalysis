 Cashew nuts are a popular [[snack]] and food source. Cashews, unlike other oily tree nuts, contain [[starch]] to about 10% of their weight. This makes them more effective than other nuts in thickening water-based dishes such as soups, [[meat]] stews, and some [[India]]n milk-based desserts. Many southeast Asian and south Asian cuisines use cashews for this unusual characteristic, rather than other nuts. < ref name=mcgee > {{cite book|title=On food and cooking (see nuts and other oil-rich seeds chapter)|author=Harold McGee|isbn= 978-0-684-80001-1|year=2004|publisher=Scribner|url=http://www.curiouscook.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html}} < /ref >

 Because the shell of the cashew nut is toxic, it is removed before it is sold to consumers. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Glossary C-G - Joyofbaking.com|url=https://www.joyofbaking.com/other/glossaryCG.html|access-date=2021-07-20|website=www.joyofbaking.com}} < /ref >
