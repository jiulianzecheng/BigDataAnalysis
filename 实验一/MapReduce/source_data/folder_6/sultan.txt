 '''Sultan''' is a title of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin for [[Islam]]ic rulers who are [[monarch]]s. The title often [[wikt:correspond|corresponds]] to that of a [[king]]. 
 
 The [[word]] ''sultan'' comes from the [[Arabic language]]. It means  " strength " ,  " authority " , or  " rulership " . Later, it came to be used as the title of certain Muslim rulers who claimed full [[sovereignty]]. They did not have to take orders from any higher [[monarch]], without claiming the overall [[caliph]]ate. There is no specific word for a sultan's [[wife]] in Arabic. The word, ''sultana'' began to be used (as the [[feminine]] version of the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for ''sultano'') in the 16th century in Italy, to describe the  wife, [[mother]], [[daughter]], or [[concubine]] of a sultan. The Italian word also passed to other European languages. 
 
 The [[dynasty]] and lands ruled by the Sultan is called a sultanate, which corresponds to a [[kingdom]]. During the 20th century, several Sultans in the [[Arab world]] changed their title to  " Malik " , which means  " [[king]] "  in Arabic.
