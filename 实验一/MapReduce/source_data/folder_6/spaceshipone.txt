 '''SpaceShipOne'''  is a [[vehicle]] built to travel to the lower limits of [[outer space]]. It completed the first manned private [[spaceflight]] in 2004. That same year, it won the US$10 million [[Ansari X Prize]] and has not flown since winning. It was carried high into the air by a specially designed plane named [[Scaled Composites White Knight| " White Knight " ]]. Both vehicles were built and flown by [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]]. This was a joint project between [[Paul Allen]] and [[Scaled Composites]], [[Burt Rutan]]'s flying machine company. Allen provided the money to build and fly SpaceShipOne, about US$25 million. 
 
 Rutan has said that ideas about the project began as early as 1994. The full-time work towards the 2004 accomplishments took about three years. The vehicle first flew faster than the [[speed of sound]] on December 17, 2003. This date was also the one-hundredth [[anniversary]] of the [[Wright Brothers]]' historic first powered flight. SpaceShipOne's first official spaceflight, was piloted by [[Mike Melvill]]. A few days before that flight, the Mojave Air and Space Port was the first commercial spaceport licensed in the United States. A few hours after that flight, Melvill became the first licensed U.S. commercial [[astronaut]]. The overall project name was  " Tier One " . It has evolved into Tier 1b with a goal of taking a new, but similar ship's first paying passengers into space within the next few years.
