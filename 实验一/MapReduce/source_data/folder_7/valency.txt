 In [[chemistry]], '''valency''' or '''valence''' is the [[number]] of [[chemical bond]]s that an [[atom]] of a certain [[chemical element|element]] can form. 
 
 For a long time, people thought that this number was a fixed property of the element in question. They thought that [[carbon]] always has four bonds, [[oxygen]] always has two, and [[hydrogen]] always has one. The problem was seen only later. For example, [[phosphorous]] sometimes behaves as if it had three bonds, a valence of three. At other times, though, it seems to have five bonds.  
 
 [[IUPAC]] saw this problem, and proposed [[oxidation number]]s. This means there is one number per chemical element. The problem with this approach is that it leaves aside most{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Which ones?}} chemical properties of the elements in question. 
 
 A '''valence band''' is the highest occupied [[molecular orbital]] normally occupied by valence electrons for a given [[solid]] at [[absolute zero]] [[temperature]].
