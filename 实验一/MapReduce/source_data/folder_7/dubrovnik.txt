 '''Dubrovnik''' is a [[city]] in [[Croatia]] on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. More than 500 years ago it was called  " '''Ragusa''' " . The Italian name of the city is still  " Ragusa " ; this sometimes leads to confusion because there is also a city named [[Ragusa]] on [[Sicily]]. It is on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. About 50,000 people lived there in 2001. Because of its age and unique buildings, the old city of Dubrovnik has been declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The old city of Ragusa was started by Greeks who left [[Illyria|Illirya]] after their home was invaded in the sixth century. They had been part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Ragusa in Dalmatia grew to be an important country on the sea, called the ''Republic of Ragusa''. This republic lasted until [[Napoleon]]ic times. < ref > {{cite web|title=Old city of Dubrovnik|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=22 February 2014}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=Dubrovnik history|url=http://www.dubrovnikcity.com/dubrovnik/history.htm|publisher=Dubrovnik city|accessdate=22 February 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 Ragusa was once the only city in Dalmatia with Roman influence not to be controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]]. After the Middle Ages more and more Croats and Serbs from inland areas of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] moved to the area. They had started the neighbouring town of Dubrovnik, which eventually joined Ragusa. The original population (the [[Dalmatian Italians]]) was reduced to the few people of the ruling class: in the 19th century nearly all the people living in Ragusa were Slavs (Croats and Serbs). Ragusa officially changed its name to  " Dubrovnik "  (a Croatian name) after 1918, when the city became part of the newly created country of [[Yugoslavia]]. 
 
 Today Dubrovnik is one of the main tourist sites in Croatia. Dubrovnik is famous for its Old Town - this is an ancient fortress with large stone walls, which helped Dubrovnik keep its freedom for many centuries. There was a major earthquake in 1667 that destroyed many buildings, but the people living there were able to rebuild the town. 
 
 Dubrovnik has been used as a filming location for [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi]], where it was used as the city Canto Bight, on the planet Cantonica. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Cantonica - Star Wars The Last Jedi|url=http://starwarsplaces.com/locations/episode-viii-tbc/cantonica-tlj/|access-date=2022-10-17|website=Star Wars Places|language=en-GB}} < /ref >
