A '''poorhouse''', '''alms house''' or '''poor farm''' was a facility that offered [[meal]]s and living accommodation for people too poor to live on their own. Residents were often required to do [[manual labor]] to earn their keep and generally had few rights at all. These facilities were in existence and operation primarily from the [[medieval]] period to the early [[20th century]], after which point societal [[welfare]] programs and [[homeless shelter]]s largely replaced them.
