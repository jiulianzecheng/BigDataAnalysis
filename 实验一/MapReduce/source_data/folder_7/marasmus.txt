 '''Marasmus''' is a form of [[malnutrition]].  It happens in people (especially children) who do not get enough [[food]].  A healthy person [[cellular respiration|gets energy from eating food]], especially foods with [[protein]] and [[fat]] in them.  Because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food, they do not get the [[energy]] they need to [[Life|survive]]. This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories. Generally, this disease occurs when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births. Lean and weak, swelling limbs, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc.., are the symptoms of this disease. 
 
 Children with marasmus look [[wikt:emaciated|emaciated]] (very skinny).  This is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and [[muscular system|muscles]] to make energy.  The child's [[body]] [[weight]] will be less than 60% of a normal child his or her age. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Appleton |first1=Amber |last2=Vanbergen |first2=Olivia |date=2013 |title=Crash Course: Metabolism and Nutrition |location=London |publisher=Moseby |page=130 |isbn=9780723438533}} < /ref > 
 
 Marasmus can be [[Therapy|treated]].  However, about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they cannot get treatment where they live. < ref name= " pmid16762938 " > {{cite journal |author=Badaloo AV, Forrester T, ''et al.'' 2006 |title=Lipid kinetic differences between children with kwashiorkor and those with marasmus |journal=Am.

 The word “marasmus” comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word μαρασμός ''marasmos'' (meaning  " [[wikt:decay|decay  < nowiki > '' < /nowiki > )]] 
 
 ==Signs and symptoms== 
 Most children with marasmus look [[wikt:shrunken|shrunken]] and have lost most of their muscles and body fat. < ref > {{cite web|last1=Rabinowitz|first1=Simon|title=MD, PhD, FAAP|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/984496-clinical#a0217|website=Emedicine Medscape|publisher=Medscape|access-date=29 January 2015|page=28}} < /ref >   Their bodies try to save as much energy as possible by shutting down the [[immune system]], not [[wikt:grow|grow]]ing, and giving less energy to the [[liver]], [[kidney]]s, [[heart]], and [[gastrointestinal system]]. < ref name=unicef > {{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/training/2.3/4.html |title=Acute Malnutrition: Marasmus (or Wasting) |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |website=Harmonized Training Package: Resource Material for Training on Nutrition in Emergencies |publisher=UNICEF |access-date=January 28, 2016 |archive-date=December 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151219083659/http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/training/2.3/4.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   This can cause problems like: < ref name=unicef / > 
 * Having too much [[fluid]] in the body, because the kidneys are not working well enough to get rid of it.  This can lead to[[edema]] (fluid under the skin) and even [[heart failure]]. 
 * [[Hypothermia]] (low body temperature), because staying warm takes energy, and because the child has almost no fat or muscles to keep them warm 
 * [[Hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar), because the child is not getting [[sugar]] or [[carbohydrate]]s from foods 
 * [[Infection]], because the child's body has shut down the immune system, which usually fights [[infection]], to save energy

 ==Causes== 
 Marasmus is caused by a [[wikt:deficiency|deficiency]] (not having enough) of nearly all [[nutrient]]s, especially protein, carbohydrates, and [[lipid]]s (fats). < ref name=unicef / > 
 
 ==Treatment== 
 Marasmus can be treated by giving [[emergency]] nutrients and [[fluid]]s.  However, treating the causes of marasmus is not enough.  Often, the disease has [[complication]]s (it causes other problems), like [[infection]]s, [[dehydration]], and problems with the [[circulatory system]].  These complications are very [[danger]]ous and often kill children if they are not treated correctly. < ref name=aj / >
