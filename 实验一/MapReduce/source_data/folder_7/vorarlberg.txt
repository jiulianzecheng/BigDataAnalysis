 It is the only province in Austria that does not speak [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]].  Instead they speak an [[Alemannic dialects|Alemannic dialect]]. This makes it more in common with its Alemannic-speaking neighbors [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Swabia]] than with [[Bavaria]] and the rest of Austria.

 78% of the population is [[Roman Catholic]].  The second most follow [[Islam]] which has a share of 8.4%. 
 
 Vorarlberg is divided into four large districts.  They are [[Bregenz (district)|Bregenz]], [[Dornbirn (district)|Dornbirn]], [[Feldkirch (district)|Feldkirch]] and [[Bludenz (district)|Bludenz]]. 
 
 On land, Vorarlberg has borders with [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Germany]]. The respextive states are the Swiss cantons of [[St.Gallen]] and [[Graubünden]], and the German state of [[Bavaria]]. [[Lake Constance]] is special, there are no borders apart fro the borders on land. Legally, all the states that share this lake, also have a common border. That way, Vorarlberg also has a common border with the German state of Baden-Württemberg, and the Swiss canton of Thurgau.
