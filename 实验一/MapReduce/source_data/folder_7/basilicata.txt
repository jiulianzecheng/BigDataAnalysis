 '''Basilicata''' is a [[region]] in the south of [[Italy]]. The capital is [[Potenza]]. The [[population]] was about 597,768 in [[2004]]. The region is very [[mountain]]ous. Because of this, [[communication]] in the area was very difficult until modern times. This has also caused Basilicata to be one of the least developed areas of Italy. Basilicata borders the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Taranto]] at its lowest [[elevation]]s. The highest point in the area is [[Monte Pollino]] at 2233[[metre|m]] (7325[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]). The area also includes a dead [[volcano]], [[Monte Vulture]]. The region has an area of {{convert|9992|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. 
   
 Basilicata also used to be one of the poorest regions in Italy. It has become richer over the past couple of years because of the discovery of [[oil]].
