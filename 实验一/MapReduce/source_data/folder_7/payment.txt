 A '''payment''' is the [[transfer]] of something from one [[Party (law)|party]] to another.  Giving money to a company is a payment, for example.  A payment is usually made for [[good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|service]]s. 
 
 The oldest form of payment is [[barter]].  Barter is a simple form of payment.  It is the transfer of one good or service for another.  
 
 Today, payment is usually with [[money]], [[cheque]], [[Debit card|debit]], [[Credit card|credit]], [[bank transfer]], or [[mobile payment]].  In transfers between [[business]]es, sometimes payments can be complicated, with [[stock]] and other things. 
 
 In [[law]], the ''payer'' is the party that sends the payment and the ''payee'' is the party that gets the payment.
