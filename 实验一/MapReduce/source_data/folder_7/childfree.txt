The term '''childfree''' means people who choose not to have [[children]]. It includes people who have had [[sterilisation]] ([[surgery]] such as a [[vasectomy]]) to make themselves unable to have children. 
 
 The most common reasons for being childfree are: 
 
 *not liking children 
 *[[asceticism]] or [[Religion|religious]] reasons < ref > {{cite web|title=Scientology|publisher=The Marburg Journal|url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/kent.html|access-date=Jan 18, 2014}} < /ref > 
 *not wanting to become a [[parent]] 
 *thinking that wanting to reproduce oneself is [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] 
 *[[poverty|not having enough money]] to take care of children 
 *personal well-being 
 
 People may also choose not to have children for [[ethic]]al reasons, such as [[antinatalism]]. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Tuhus-Dubrow|first=Rebecca|date=2019-11-14|title=I wish I'd never been born: the rise of the anti-natalists|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/anti-natalists-childfree-population-climate-change|access-date=2021-01-22|website=the Guardian|language=en}} < /ref >  By choosing not to have their own children, childfree people have choices of saving large amounts of [[money]]. They can also focus on [[Self|themselves]]. They usually benefit society more by being childless rather than having children. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Cost of Kids|publisher=Brian Tomasik|url=http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/cost-of-kids.html|access-date=Jan 18, 2014}} < /ref > 
 
 Being childless was considered unusual in the 1950s. Since then, the number of adults [[Childlessness|without children]] has increased. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Long Road to Adulthood is Growing Longer|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/us/13generations.html?_r=2 & |access-date=Jan 18, 2014}} < /ref >  Many researchers say childfree adults are more [[education|educated]], less likely to be [[religion|religious]] and more likely to live around [[City|cities]]. In the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] to early [[2010s]], the rate of [[Woman|women]] in the [[United States]] becoming [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] dropped almost 9%. The [[birth rate]] between [[2010]] and [[2013]] was the lowest in the country's [[history]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=Having it All without Having Children|publisher=TIME Magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2148636,00.html|access-date=Jan 18, 2014}} < /ref >
