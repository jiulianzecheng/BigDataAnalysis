 An '''editorial''', '''leading article''' (US) or '''leader''' (UK), is an article written by the senior editors of a [[newspaper]] or [[magazine]]. The article is often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' < ref > {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/ |title= Opinion |access-date= 23 May 2012 |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 23 May 2012 |author= Staff}} < /ref >  and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', < ref > {{cite news |title= Opinion |url= http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/ |access-date= 23 May 2012 |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |date= 23 May 2012 |author=Staff}} < /ref >  often give editorials the heading  " [[wikt:opinion|opinion]] " . 
 
 Editorials can also be in the form of a [[cartoon]]. < ref > {{cite web |title= AAEC The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists |url= http://editorialcartoonists.com/ |publisher= The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists |access-date= 23 May 2012 |author= Staff |year= 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 The editors decide on which issues their readers will want to know the newspaper's opinion. < ref > {{cite book |last= Passante |first= Christopher K. |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Journalism â€“ Editorials |publisher= Penguin |year= 2007 |page= 28 |isbn= 978-1-59257-670-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lfh1mufymdsC & dq=editorials+%2B+def & pg=PA28 |access-date= 21 February 2010}} < /ref > 
 
 Editorials are usually published on a special page, called the editorial page. This often features [[letters to the editor]] from members of the public. The page opposite this page is called the [[op-ed]] page (opposite the editorial); and has opinion pieces by writers not employed by the publication.  However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the [[English-language]] press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered very important; it is more common, however, in some [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[France]]. < ref > {{cite web | url= http://www.editorsweblog.org/newspaper/2009/06/front-page_editorials_a_stylistic_change.php | title= Front Page Editorials: a Stylist Change for the Future? | author= Christie Silk | date= 15 June 2009 | work= Editors' Weblog | publisher= World Editors' Forum | access-date= 1 July 2011 | archive-date= 11 November 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113831/http://www.editorsweblog.org/newspaper/2009/06/front-page_editorials_a_stylistic_change.php | url-status= dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Many newspapers do not put the name of the author on the editorial. Tom Clark, editorial writer for ''[[The Guardian]]'', argues that it helps readers discuss the issue, not the author. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Tom |title=Why do editorials remain anonymous? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/10/editorial-leading-article-anonymous |access-date=26 May 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 January 2011}} < /ref >  On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Crean |first1=Mike |title=First with the news: an illustrated history |url=https://archive.org/details/pressfirstwithne0000crea | date=2011|publisher=[[Random House]] |location=Auckland |isbn=978-1-86979-562-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/pressfirstwithne0000crea/page/97 97]}} < /ref > 
 
 When ''[[The Press]]'', a New Zealand newspaper based in [[Christchurch]], changed after 157 years from [[broadsheet]] to [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. One example was the change in their view on [[women's suffrage in New Zealand]]. The government gave women the [[1893 New Zealand general election|vote in 1893]], and the editorial said that women would  " much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties "  than going to the polling booths. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Matthews |first1=Philip |title=Broadsheets and blunders: In defence of getting it wrong |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/102782748/broadsheets-and-blunders-in-defence-of-getting-it-wrong |access-date=26 May 2018 |work=[[The Press]] |date=28 April 2018}} < /ref > 
 
 In [[Fashion magazine|fashion publishing]], the term is often used to refer to ''[[Fashion photography|photo]]''-editorials. These are often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a [[photo-essay]]) without accompanying text. < ref > {{cite web | url= http://models.com/client/editorial | title=Various editorials | website=models.com | access-date=3 April 2012}} < /ref >
