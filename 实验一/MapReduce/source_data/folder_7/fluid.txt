{{Continuum mechanics}} 
 
 A '''fluid''' is a substance that can move easily and change shape such as [[water]] ([[liquid]]s), or air ([[gas]]es), or [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]. They can 'flow'- flow and fluids both come from the same English word roots ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''fluere''  " to flow " ) and are pronounced similarly. The physics of fluids is called [[fluid mechanics]]. 
 
 Fluids usually take on the shape of their containers, in contrast to [[solids]] which maintain their own shape. 
 
 Some things are not exactly fluid and not exactly solid, such as [[Silly Putty]]. [[Powder]]s are made up of small solids that appear to flow but don't actually. 
 
 Most fluids have a [[freezing point]]. At this temperature it becomes solid.
