'''Texaco''' (or '''The Texas Company'''; originally called '''The Texas Fuel Company''') is an [[United States|American]] [[petroleum]] and [[gasoline]] [[company]]. It was founded in 1902 in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=History of Texaco|publisher=Texaco|url=http://www.texaco.com/about.html|access-date=July 22, 2021|archive-date=October 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015201958/http://www.texaco.com/about.html|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref >   The [[Chevron Corporation]]  bought the Texaco company in late 2000. < ref > {{cite web|title=Oil Giant Chevron Buys Rival Texaco|publisher=The BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/973161.stm|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 In 1931, Texaco bought the Indian Oil Company. The Indian Oil Company was in [[Illinois]]. This expanded the company's refining and marketing base across the [[midwestern United States]]. It also gave Texaco rights to Indian's [[Havoline]] [[motor oil]] (which became a Texaco product).  
 
 In 1994, the System3 gasolines by Texaco were replaced with new CleanSystem3 gasoline for improved [[engine]] performance. 
 
 Texaco gasoline contains Techron, an additive developed by Chevron in 2005. It replaces the previous CleanSystem3. This Texaco brand is strong in [[Latin America]], the [[United States]] and [[West Africa]]. It is also in [[Europe]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], there are about 850 Texaco-branded [[gas station]]s. < ref > {{cite web|title=Valero|publisher=Texaco UK|url=https://texaco.co.uk/about-us|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref > 
 
 In 2010, Texaco ended business operations across the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. Texaco removed its brand from 450 stations in [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]], [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[West Virginia]], [[South Carolina]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=An Eastern Withdrawal for Chevron|publisher=CSP|url=http://www.cspnet.com/news/fuels/articles/eastern-withdrawal-chevron|access-date=July 22, 2021|archive-date=July 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722103759/http://www.cspnet.com/news/fuels/articles/eastern-withdrawal-chevron|url-status=bot: unknown}} < /ref > 
 
 Texaco once did business in and around the [[Quad Cities]] of southeastern [[Iowa]] and northwestern [[Illinois]]. In the 2000s decade, however, the stores were closed. They were then replaced with Kwik Shop stores in Iowa and with Gas Land stores in Illinois. < ref > {{cite web|title=Amblers' Texaco Gas Station Route 66|publisher=National Park Service|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/amblers_texaco_gasstation_dwight.html|access-date=July 22, 2021}} < /ref >
