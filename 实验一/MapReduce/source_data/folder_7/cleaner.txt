 A '''cleaner''' (or '''janitor''') is someone who takes away [[garbage]] and cleans surfaces. Cleaners sometimes  [[wikt:repair|repair]] things, and maintain their equipment in good working order, as well as [[dust]]ing, [[washing]], [[wax]]ing and [[wikt:polish|polishing]]. 
 
 Heavy duty cleaners often move furniture, large containers of recycled materials and waste, and other objects, and operate large buffers and other weighty equipment.  " Light "  duty cleaners clean chalk boards, windows, shelves, desks, light fixtures, and ledges. Some duties, like using a [[vacuum cleaner]], can be done by either  " light "  or  " heavy "  duty cleaners. Cleaners can clean offices, staircases, kitchens, [[bathroom]]s, [[hallways]], [[sidewalk]]s, [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]]s, and other areas. Cleaners can specialize in washing [[windows]], or in cleaning [[carpet]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[food processing plant]]s, or [[construction site]]s. Cleaners who discover seriously damaged surfaces and equipment on their sites can notify specialists, like [[plumber]]s and [[carpenter]]s, about the need for professional repairs. 
 
 Cleaners are also alert for security problems, like [[vandalism]], signs of [[theft]] (forced windows or doors, missing computers or stock), blocked [[fire]] [[escape]] routes, lights or [[fire alarm]]s not working, or trespassers. When these occur, the cleaners promptly notify their sites' Security Officers and Site Supervisors.
