 '''Heybeliada''' is an island in Sea of Marmara in [[Turkey]]. It is officially a part of Adalar district of [[Istanbul]]. Heybeliada has an old Orthodox Christian Theology School, started in 1844. However this school was closed because of Turkish laws on [[secularism]] in 1971. These laws on the separation of church and state have also closed all Muslim Theology schools. Turkey and the [[Eurpean Union]] are looking at ways to reopen this school again. However to do this, the government must prepare a new laws that do not conflict with secularism.
