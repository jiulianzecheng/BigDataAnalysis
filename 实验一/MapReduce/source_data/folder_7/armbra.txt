[[File:Backyard Fun.jpg|thumb|An Armbra]] 
 An '''armbra''' is the practice of covering a woman's breasts, including her nipples and areolas, with one's arms, which would otherwise have been exposed. When hands are used instead, it is called a ''handbra''. 
 
 An armbra may be used by women to maintain their modesty, or in compliance with [[censorship]] guidelines. It is also used in poses for photography.
