 A '''phenomenon''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''{{polytonic|φαινόμενo}}, pl. {{polytonic|φαινόμενα}}'') is an observable event or, quite literally, something that can be seen. < ref name= " Cambdict1 " > {{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=59340 & dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Online Dictionary: Phenomenon as observable event or object |access-date=2007-06-14 |archive-date=2007-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302014005/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=59340 & dict=CALD |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 It comes from the noun {{polytonic|φαινόμενον}} (''phainomenon, df. appearance'') and is also related to the verb {{polytonic|φαινειν}} (''phainein, df. to show''). Its plural is '''phenomena'''. Its [[antonym]] is ''lathomenon'', meaning  " something lying beneath the surface " .  
 
 Phenomenon can also mean a  " surprising development "  or  " unusually successful person " . < ref name= " wordnet " > [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=phenomenon Phenomenon]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''Wordnet'' < /ref > < ref name= " Cambdict2 " > {{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=59341 & dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Online Dictionary: Phenomenon as success |access-date=2007-06-14 |archive-date=2007-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302013926/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=59341 & dict=CALD |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 == Use in science  &  technology == 
 In science, ''phenomenon'' stands for any [[event]] which we can sense or detect or record. In science, the word  " observe "  means more than just  " visible to the naked eye " . It means  " sensible " , available to our senses. The [[senses]] we are born with are extended by a whole range of [[instruments]] which record things we cannot see, and make them visible to us. 
 
 So, while some events are easy to observe, others need technology to make [[observation]] possible.
