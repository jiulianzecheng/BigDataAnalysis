 The '''muskellunge''' (''Esox masquinongy'') is a [[freshwater]] [[game fish]]. It is the largest member of the [[Esox]] (Pike) family. The muskellunge is also called the '''muskie''' or '''maskinonge''' ([[Canada]]). It is native to [[north]]ern and [[east]]ern [[North America]]. Muskies have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into other [[States of the United States|U.S. states]].. Muskies are [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] and eat other fish. They are [[Predation#Ambush predator|ambush feeders]] who will attack anything that moves in or on the water. 
 
 == Subspecies == 
 
 Currently there are three recognized [[subspecies]] of Muskellunge. < ref name=Reynolds15 > Barry Reynolds; John Berryman, ''Pike on the Fly: The Flyfishing Guide to Northerns, Tigers, and Muskies'' (Boulder : Johnson Books, 1993), p. 15 < /ref >

 * The Northern Muskellunge (''Esox masquinongy masquinongy'') native to [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]]. < ref name=Reynolds15/ > 
 
 There is also a [[hybrid]] called the [[Tiger muskellunge]] (or Tiger Muskie). It is a cross between the Muskellunge and the [[Northern pike]] (''Esox lucius''). < ref name=Schultz145 > Ken Schultz, ''Ken Schultz's Field Guide to Freshwater Fish'' (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), p. 145 < /ref >  They are smaller than true muskies but can grow up to 1.5 times faster in the first year. < ref > B.J Brecka; M.L. Hooe; et al., 'Comparison of Growth, Survival, and Body Composition of Muskellunge and Tiger Muskellunge Fed Four Commercial Diets', ''The Progressive Fish Culturist'', Vol. 57 (1995), pp. 37-43 < /ref >  They are almost always sterile and cannot reproduce. < ref name=Reynolds17 > Barry Reynolds; John Berryman, ''Pike on the Fly: The Flyfishing Guide to Northerns, Tigers, and Muskies'' (Boulder : Johnson Books, 1993), p. 17 < /ref > 
 
 == Physical descriptions == 
 
 True muskies have light colored bodies. They can be [[silver]], light [[green]], or light [[brown]]. < ref name=Iverson > {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/index.html |title=Muskellunge |author=C. Iverson|date=2014 |website= |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=17 June 2014}} < /ref >  They usually have dark bars on their sides. < ref name=Iverson/ >  This is the opposite of the Northern pike which Muskies are sometimes confused with. Northern pike (northerns) have dark bodies with light colored bars on the sides. < ref name=Iverson/ >  Muskies also have [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] only on the upper half of the [[cheek]]. The best way to tell the two apart is the pores under the jaw. Northerns have five or less; muskies have six or more. < ref name=Iverson/ >  Males are always smaller than females. < ref name=Reynolds17/ > 
 
 Tiger muskies look like both muskies and northerns. Their  " [[tiger]] "  stripes are more distinctive than the true musky. Where both species live in the same waters, tiger muskies occur naturally. < ref name=Reynolds17/ >  But they are never in large numbers. Once biologists realized that tiger muskies were a hybrid, they began raising them in hatcheries. There are no size differences between male and female tiger muskies. < ref name=Reynolds17/ > 
 
 == Habitat and forage ==

 < !-- wikify -- > 
 The muskie is a very efficient [[Predation|predator]]. < ref name=MIDNR > {{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10364_18958-45684--,00.html |title=Muskellunge, Esox masquinongy |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |website= |publisher=DNR, State of Michigan |accessdate=17 June 2014 }} < /ref >  It lays in wait near the shoreline often in shallow water. It hides in weeds, near or under logs and rocks. < ref name=MIDNR/ >  In the [[summer]] as the water warms up, Muskies move to the cooler waters at lower depths. But will remain close to shallow water using drop-offs for cover. < ref name=MIDNR/ >  Muskies can stand water up to 90 degrees F. < ref name=MIDNR/ > 
 
 Muskies [[Foraging|forage]] (feed) mainly on other fish such as [[Catostomidae|suckers]] and [[perch]]. They are ambush feeders who will feed on nearly anything. They have been known to eat [[Loon]]s, [[duck]]s and small mammals like [[Muskrat]]s. < ref > Scott Bestul, 'Madness Among Men', '' Field  &  Stream'', Vol. ciii, No. 10 (February 1999), p. 56 < /ref > 
 
 When the water temperature reaches 60 & nbsp;째F, muskies feed heavily. At 80째 the feeding slows down. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/biology.html |title=Muskellunge biology and identification |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=18 June 2014 }} < /ref >  They have a preference for larger fish over small fish. < ref name=Schultz144 > Ken Schultz, ''Ken Schultz's Field Guide to Freshwater Fish'' (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), p. 144 < /ref >  Muskies strike quickly. They often take their prey to a secluded area before eating it. < ref name=MIDNR/ >  They remain in the same area of a lake, sometimes for their entire lifetime. < ref name=Schultz144/ > 
 
 == Behavior == 
 
 Muskies are one of the largest freshwater fish in North America. < ref name=Schultz144/ >  The largest on record was 69 pounds, 15 ounces. < ref name=Schultz144/ >  Average muskies are usually less than 40 inches long and might weigh from 7 to 15 pounds. Muskies can live up to 30 years. 
 
 Just after the ice melts on northern lakes (called ice-out) and the water temperature is between 49째 and 59째[[Fahrenheit|F]], muskies begin to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]. < ref name=Schultz144/ >  In lakes where both northern pike and muskies live, muskies spawn after the northerns. A female lays between 60,000 and 100,000 eggs. < ref > Samuel Eddy; et al., ''Northern Fishes: With Special Reference to the Upper Mississippi Valley'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1974), p. 206 < /ref >  In lakes with northern pike and muskies, the muskie seems to have fewer numbers of surviving [[Spawn (biology)|fry]]. Two reasons are suggested. Since northerns hatch about two weeks earlier than muskies, the young northerns feed on the smaller muskie fry. < ref name=MvN > {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/muskie_northern.html |title=Muskie vs. Northern pike |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=18 June 2014 }} < /ref >  Another reason is that the young muskie fry swim just below the surface of the water. They are easily seen by fish below or birds flying over the water. < ref name=MvN/ >

 Muskies are an elusive fish but highly prized by anglers. Many fishermen specialize in muskie fishing and will fish for no other species. < ref name=Eddy208 > Samuel Eddy; et al., ''Northern Fishes: With Special Reference to the Upper Mississippi Valley'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1974), p. 208 < /ref >  They are called  " the fish of 10,000 [[Casting (fishing)|casts]] " . < ref name=Cutler83 > Charles L. Cutler, ''Tracks that Speak: The Legacy of Native American Words in North American Culture'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002), p. 83 < /ref >  This gives some idea of how difficult they are to catch. According to many guides, muskies do not fear anything, including fisherman. < ref name=Cutler83/ >  They routinely follow lures back to the boat without striking. Sometimes they will flick a lure or fly back at the fisherman. Hooking a muskie is hard. Landing one is even harder. They will fight hard for short periods and should be landed quickly to avoid stressing them. Prolonged fighting of muskie on insufficient tackle could kill them even after they swim away. [[Skill]] and [[:wikt:luck|luck]] are needed to land one. < ref name=Eddy208/ > 
 
 Muskies require very careful handling by anglers. A trophy size musky is an old fish. < ref name=MC & R > {{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/catch_release.html |title=Muskellunge catch  &  release |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- >  |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=18 June 2014 |archive-date=3 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303230133/http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish/muskellunge/catch_release.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  A 30-pound female may be 17 years old. If taken as a trophy they are not easily replaced. For that reason [[catch and release]] is strongly recommended. < ref name=MC & R/ >  A musky may still fight being handled. They are large powerful fish with very sharp teeth. < ref name=MC & R/ >  The [[mortality rate]] can be very high for fish that are handled carelessly. < ref name=MC & R/ >
