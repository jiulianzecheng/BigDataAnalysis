A '''picometre''' is a measurement. It is one millionth of a millionth of a [[metre]]. It is also one billionth of a [[millimetre]]. This is very small. Many atoms are larger than this. A picometer is 1×10−12 m (1 / 1,000,000,000,000 m). 1 picometer equals 0.001 [[nanometre]] or 1000 [[femtometre]]s.
