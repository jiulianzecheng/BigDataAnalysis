 '''Economics''' is the [[social science]] which studies economic activity: how people make [[choice]]s to get what they [[want]]. It has been defined as  " the study of scarcity and choice "  and is basically about the choices people make. It also studies what affects the [[production]], distribution and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and [[service (economics)|services]] in an [[economy]]. < ref >

 == Subjects and objects in economics == 
 The subjects (actors) in economic study are households, business companies, the government (the state), and foreign countries. '''Households''' offer their  " [[factors of production]] "  to companies. This includes work, land, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (things like machines and buildings) and information. In exchange for their factors of production, households get income which they use to consume (buy) goods from other subjects.  
 
 '''Business companies''' produce and sell [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]] and buy factors of production from households and from other companies.  
 
 '''The state''' or [[public sector]] includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for  " public goods "  like [[street]]s or [[education]], to be available for everyone. The last subject is '''foreign countries'''. This includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad. 
 
 The objects (things acted upon) in economic study are [[consumer]] goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as  " usage goods "  (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as  " purpose goods "  (for example, a house or bicycle), and as  " services "  (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and [[environment]]. 
 
 == General economic rules == 
 * All people have to decide between their options. 
 * The [[cost]] of goods is what a person gives up for the [[goods]]. 
 * When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead. This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it. This includes [[money]], and the [[economic]] benefits ( " utility " ) that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called [[opportunity cost]]. 
 * People choose between options based on the rewards ( " incentives " ) or bad things ( " disincentives " ) they expect from each option. Adding to the rewards for an option will often make more people choose it. 
 * Trade can make everyone better off. 
 * Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the [[free market]], goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market ([[Adam Smith]]) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be. 
 * Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, [[air pollution]] is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for [[society]]. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society. 
 * The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours.  
 * When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to [[produce]] things rises, prices go up. This is called [[inflation]].

 The ideas that economists have depend a lot on the times they live in. For example, [[Karl Marx]] lived in a time when [[worker]]s' conditions were very poor, and [[John Maynard Keynes]] lived through the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments, and try to make better ones. 
 
 == Branches of economics == 
 The two main branches of economics are [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].   
 
 Macroeconomics is about the [[economy]] in general. For example, macroeconomists study things that make a country's wealth go up and things that make millions of people lose their jobs. Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and [[household]] < nowiki/ > s spend their money and how businesses operate.
