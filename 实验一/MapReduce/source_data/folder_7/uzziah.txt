 '''Uzziah''' (עֻזִּיָּהוּ in Hebrew, meaning ''Yahweh is my strength''; {{lang-el|Οζίας}}; {{lang-la|Ozias}}), also known as '''Azariah''' (עֲזַרְיָה in Hebrew; {{lang-el|Αζαρις}}; {{lang-la|Azarias}}), was the king of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]], and one of King Amaziah's sons, whom the people chose to rule after his father ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|14:21|RSV}}; [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 26:1). He was 16 years old when he became king of Judah < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Kings|14:21|RSV}} < /ref >  and ruled for 52 years. He  " did that which was right in the sight of the [[Lord]] "  ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|15:3|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|26:4-5|NIV}}). According to the [[Bible]], at first he was a good king and had great [[wikt:success|success]]. His [[field]]s and [[vineyard]]s grew well, he dug many wells and towers in the [[desert]], he [[wikt:defeat|defeated]] his enemies with a strong [[army]], and he became very powerful. < ref name= " niv " > {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nivstudybibleper00kenn|title=''The NIV Study Bible''|publisher=Zondervan Publishing House|year=1995|isbn=0310925886|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|pages=|doi=|id=}} < /ref >  A seal with Uzziah's name has been found in a [[well|cistern]] at Tell Beit Mirsim. < ref name=niv/ > 
 
 However, he grew proud, and entered the temple of the [[God|LORD]] to burn [[incense]] on the [[altar]] of incense ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|26:15-16|RSV}}). < ref name=niv/ >  Azariah the priest with 80 other priests came to him and said,  " Leave...for you have been unfaithful...you will not be honored by the LORD God " . < ref name=niv/ >  Uzziah became [[anger|angry]], but while  " ...he was [[wikt:rage|raging]] at the priests...[[leprosy]] broke out on his forehead " , and he  " ...had leprosy until the day he died " . < ref name=niv/ >  Because of this, his son Jotham ruled the palace and the people of the land. < ref name=niv/ >  He died and was buried in a field that belonged to the kings. < ref name=niv/ >  Probably because of his leprosy, Uzziah was buried in a [[cemetery]] belonging to the kings, but not in the tombs of the kings.
