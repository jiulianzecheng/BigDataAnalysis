 '''Eisleben''' is a town in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. It is famous as the hometown of [[Martin Luther]]; because of this, its official name is '''Lutherstadt Eisleben'''. In 2015, Eisleben had a population of 24,198. 
 
 Eisleben has two parts old town and new town (Altstadt and Neustadt). The new town was created for Eisleben's miners in the 14th century. 
 
 Eisleben was the capital of the district of [[Mansfelder Land (district)|Mansfelder Land]] and is the seat of the ''[[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft]]'' ( " collective municipality " ) [[Lutherstadt Eisleben (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Lutherstadt Eisleben]]. 
 
 ==History== 
 
 Eisleben was first written about in 997 as a market called Islebia, and in 1180 as a town. The [[House of Mansfeld|counts of Mansfeld]] governed the area until the 18th century. In 1780, Eisleben came directly under the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Eisleben became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. The Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] became part of the [[Free State of Prussia]] in the [[German Reich]] after World War I. After [[World War II]], Eisleben became part of the new state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) until [[German reunification|Germany's reuinification]] in 1990. 
 
 ==Helfta== 
 [[File:Helfta Convent (Lutherstadt Eisleben), houses for the nuns.jpg|thumb|Modern accommodation for nuns, Helfta Convent (Lutherstadt Eisleben).]] 
 In 1229, the Counts of Mansfield started a [[convent]] for women. At first, it was on the grounds of their castle. Then they built a separate convent at Helfta near Eisleben, which opened in 1258. It was governed under either the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine]] or [[Cistercian order|Cistercian]] model. It became known for its powerful and [[Mysticism|mystical]] abbesses, including [[Gertrude of Hackeborn]], [[Gertrude the Great]] and [[Mechtild]]. However, Duke Albrecht of [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Brunswick]] destroyed the convent in 1342. It was rebuilt the next year. It closed in 1524, but later reopened on a smaller scale until 1542 
 
 In 1542, it came under the control of local farmers. In 1712 it became a farm run by the Prussian state. In 1994, the Catholic [[Diocese of Magdeburg]] bought the property and began restoring the building. Cistercian nuns from [[Seligenthal]] in [[Bavaria]] moved in starting in approximately 1999. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-helfta.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=329 & lang=21|title=The History Of The Convent Of Helfta|author=Witt, Claudia|publisher=|access-date=2017-10-03|archive-date=2014-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203160331/http://www.kloster-helfta.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=329 & lang=21|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Martin Luther== 
 
 The [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant reformer]] [[Martin Luther]] was born in Eisleben on November 10, 1483. His father, [[Hans Luther (15th century)|Hans Luther]], was a [[miner]]. Luther's family moved to [[Mansfeld]] when he was only a year old; he lived in [[Wittenberg]] most of his life. Luther preached his last sermon and died in Eisleben in 1546. 
 
 Eisleben started preserving its Luther memorials in 1689. 
 
 In 1997, Eisleben's  " [[Martin Luther's Birth House|Birth House]] "  and  " [[Martin Luther's Death House|Death House]] "  were added to the [[World Heritage List]]. Also, Luther was [[Baptism|baptised]] in Eisleben's St. Peter and Paul Church. He preached his last sermons at St. Andreas Church. 
 
 == Historical population == 
 The population has been declining since the mid-1960s due to declining birth rates and people moving away. < ref > Statistisches Landesamt Sachsen-Anhalt: [http://www.statistik.sachsen-anhalt.de/bevoelkerung/bewegungen/statistik/gem/bev.15087130.z1.html Lutherstadt ''Eisleben – Landkreis Mansfeld-Südharz.
