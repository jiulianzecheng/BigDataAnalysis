 '''''Metriacanthosaurus''''' is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. Its name means  " Moderate-spined lizard " , because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs, such as ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]''. Like most [[theropods]], ''Metriacanthosaurus'' was a meat-eater. It had three fingers on each hand. Each finger ended in a sharp, hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws. It probably preyed on the large, long-necked sauropods, such as ''[[Pelorosaurus]]'', that lived in the same time and place as it. It was originally classified as a [[megalosaurid]], but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family, the [[Metriacanthosauridae]] 
 
 ==In popular culture== 
 In ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', one of the vials of dinosaur DNA that Dennis Nedry steals is labeled ''Metriacanthosaurus''.
