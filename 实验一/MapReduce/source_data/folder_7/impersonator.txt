 An '''impersonator''' is someone who imitates or copies the behavior or actions of another.  There are many reasons for someone to be an impersonator, some common ones being as follows: 
 
 * Legally: An [[entertainer]] impersonates a celebrity, generally for entertainment, and makes fun of their recent scandals or known behavior patterns. Entertainers who impersonate multiple celebrities as part of their act, can be sorted out to [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and [[celebrity impersonator]]s. 
 * Illegally: As part of a [[Crime|criminal act]] such as [[identity theft]]. This is usually where the criminal is trying to assume the identity of another, in order to commit [[fraud]], such as accessing confidential information, or to gain property not belonging to them. Also known as [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and [[impostor]]s. 
 * [[Political decoy]], used as a form of protection for political and military figures. This involves an impersonator who is employed (or forced) to perform during public appearances, to mislead observers. This is also legal. 
 * Causing people to fight, or dislike each other for social, business or political gain.
