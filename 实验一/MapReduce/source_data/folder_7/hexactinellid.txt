 '''Hexactinellid sponges''' are [[sponge]]s with a skeleton made of four- and/or six-pointed [[Silicon dioxide|silaceous]] spicules, often referred to as '''glass sponges'''. They are usually classified along with other sponges, but some researchers consider them sufficiently distinct to deserve their own phylum, '''Symplasma'''.
