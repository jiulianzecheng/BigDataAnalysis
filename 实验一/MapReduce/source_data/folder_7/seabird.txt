'''Seabirds''' are [[bird]]s that have [[adaptation|adapted]] so they are better able to live at [[sea]] or near it. Many seabirds live ''at sea'', that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to [[breed]]. Other seabirds live in [[colony (biology)|colonies]] on [[island]]s. Very often, seabirds use the sea for food, most often [[fish]] or [[shellfish]]. The first seabirds evolved in the [[Cretaceous]] [[period (geology)|period]], and modern seabird families first appeared in the [[Palaeogene]]. The similarities between them are examples of [[convergent evolution]]. The same environmental problems and feeding [[ecological niche|niches]] have resulted in similar adaptations.  
 
 Seabirds share a number of [[adaptations]] to sea life. They live longer, [[mating|breed]] later and have fewer young than other birds. They do spend a great deal of time with their young. Most [[species]] nest in colonies. These vary from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species take long annual [[migrations]] every year, crossing the [[equator]] or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea.
