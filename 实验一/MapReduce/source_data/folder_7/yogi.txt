 A '''yogi''' ([[Sanskrit]], feminine root: '''''[[yogini]]''''') is a term for a male who practices various forms of the path of [[Yoga]], maintaining a steadfast mind, the process of [[Transcendental Meditation|transcending]] the lower self. These words are mostly reserved for advanced or daily practitioners. In contemporary [[english language|English]] ''yogin'' is an alternative rendering for the word ''yogi''.  This word is often used to describe [[buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monks]] or any lay person who is devoted to [[meditation]].   
 
 The ''Shiva-Samhita'' text defines the yogi as someone who knows that the entire [[cosmos]] is situated within his own body, and the ''Yoga-Shikha-Upanishad'' distinguishes two kinds of yogins:  those who pierce through the  " sun "  (surya) by means of the various yogic techniques and those who access the door of the [[central conduit]] (sushumna-nadi) and drink the nectar. < ref >  The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga, Shambhala Publications, Boston, 2000 p.350  < /ref >
