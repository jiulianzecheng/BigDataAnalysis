 The [[subfamily]] '''Deomyinae''' consists of four genera of [[mouse]]-like [[rodent]]s. These were placed in the subfamilies [[Murinae]] and [[Dendromurinae]] until very recently.  They are sometimes called '''Acomyinae''', particularly in references that predate the discovery that the link rat, ''[[Deomys ferugineus]]'', is part of the [[clade]].  Deomyinae is the older and more appropriate name. 
 
 Deomyines share no [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics that can be used to separate them from other [[Muroidea|muroids]]. Subtle aspects of the third upper [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] have been suggested, though.  This [[subfamily]] is united solely on the basis of shared [[genetics|genetic]] mutations.  These conclusions have demonstrated good [[statistics|statistical]] support using nuclear and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[DNA]], as well as [[DNA-DNA hybridization]]. 
 
 Because of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group, it is very possible that the [[subfamily]] as it is currently recognized could grow bigger.  Many of the [[genus|genera]] currently placed in [[Murinae]] or [[Dendromurinae]] have never been included in a [[molecular phylogeny|molecular phylogenetic]] analysis.  There are potential surprises awaiting when they are. 
 
 All genera are found in [[Africa]], suggesting the deomyines may have originated there.  The spiny mice, ''[[Acomys]]'' spp. are also found in [[Asia]]. 
 
 There are currently 4 genera and 36 species included in the Deomyinae.
