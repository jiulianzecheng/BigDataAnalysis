 '''Elytra'''  < ref > plural, from {{lang-el|ἔλυτρον}}  " sheath " < /ref >  are the modified, hardened front wings of [[beetles]] and some bugs ([[Heteroptera]]). In most true bugs, the forewings are called '''hemelytra''', as only the [[basal half]] is thickened while the [[apex]] is [[membranous]].  
 
 ==Description== 
 The elytra act as protective wing-cases for the hind wings underneath, which are used for flying. To fly, a beetle opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings, flying while still holding the elytra open, though some beetles in the families [[Scarabaeidae]] and [[Buprestidae]] can fly with the elytra closed. 
 
 In some groups, the elytra are fused together, and the insect is flightless. Some of the ground beetles (family [[Carabidae]]) are a good example of this. < ref name= " Kukalová " > {{cite journal |title=Evolution of the hind wing in Coleoptera |journal=Canadian Entomologist |year=1993 |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=181–258 |doi=10.4039/Ent125181-2|last1=Kukalová-Peck |first1=Jarmila |last2=Lawrence |first2=John F. |s2cid=52888506 }} < /ref >
