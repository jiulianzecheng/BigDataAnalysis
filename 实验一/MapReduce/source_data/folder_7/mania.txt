'''Mania''' is a type of [[mood]].  Mania is usually a [[symptom]] of a [[Illness|medical problem]] or a [[mental illness]].  A person with mania is described as '''manic'''. 
 
 When people are manic, they usually have much more [[energy]] than usual.  They often have very strong [[emotion]]s, and their moods may change very quickly. < ref > {{cite journal | author = Berrios GE | title = Of mania | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 57 Pt 1 | pages = 105–124 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15104084 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04041829 | s2cid = 144834866 | url =  }} < /ref > 
 
 The word  " mania "  comes from the [[Greek language]] (''μwordsανία'' means ''mania''). < ref > [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364916 Mania, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus] < /ref >   That word comes from ''μαίνομαι'' (''mainomai)'', which means  " to [[rage]] "  or  " to be furious "  (very [[Anger|angry]]). 
 
 Mania is a symptom, not an illness by itself.  Many different things can cause mania.  These things include [[illegal drugs]] and [[brain tumor]]s.  However, most of the time, mania happens in people with [[bipolar disorder]].  Bipolar disorder causes periods of mania that switch off with periods of [[Depression (mental illness)|depression]]. < ref name= " dsm " > {{cite book|url=|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5|date=2022|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=9780890425763|location=Washington, D.C.|page=}} < /ref > 
 
 Like with other symptoms, mania can be mild (not very bad), severe (very bad), or anywhere in between.  Mild mania is usually called  " hypomania. "   Very bad mania can cause [[psychosis]], with [[hallucination]]s and [[delusion]]s. < ref > {{cite book |last=Semple |first=David |date=2005 |title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhandbookof0000unse_o1u9|location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn=9780198527831}} < /ref > 
 
 Sometimes people with mania may need to be hospitalized so they do not hurt themselves or other people. Many people with mania and hypomania have special [[creativity]] and [[artist]]ic [[talent]]s. < ref > Jamison, Kay R.

 ==Symptoms== 
 The most common symptoms of mania are: < ref name=dsm / > 
 * A mood that is either [[Euphoria|euphoric]] (very happy) or irritable (easily [[Irritation|irritated]] or angered) 
 * Being very talkative.  This includes talking very quickly (pressured speech) and jumping from one [[idea]] to the next very quickly (flight of ideas). 
 * Having an unusual amount of energy 
 * Not needing sleep

 [[File:Grandiose delusions cat lion.pdf|thumb|right|Patients with delusions of grandeur may wrongly think they are much more powerful than they really are.]] 
 Other symptoms of mania can include: < ref name=dsm / > 
 * Racing thoughts, which can sometimes make it impossible for the person to concentrate on anything other than their thoughts < ref > {{cite book |last1=Ytham |first1=Lakshmi N. |last2=Kusumakar |first2=Vivek |last3=Kutchar |first3=Stanley P. |date=2002 |title=Bipolar Disorder: A Clinician's Guide to Biological Treatments |url=https://archive.org/details/bipolardisorderc0000unse|location= |publisher=Psychology Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/bipolardisorderc0000unse/page/3 3] |isbn=9780415933902}} < /ref > 
 * Acting impulsively (doing things without thinking them through), like spending a lot of money or having unsafe [[Sexual intercourse|sex]].  People are more likely to put themselves in [[danger]] when they are manic. < ref name= " pmid23489397 " > {{cite journal | author = Fletcher K, Parker G, Paterson A, Synnott H | title = High-risk behaviour in hypomanic states | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 150 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–6 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23489397 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2013.02.018 }} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid23352318 " > {{cite journal | author = Pawlak J, Dmitrzak-Węglarz M, Skibińska M, Szczepankiewicz A, Leszczyńska-Rodziewicz A, Rajewska-Rager A, Maciukiewicz M, Czerski P, Hauser J | title = Suicide attempts and psychological risk factors in patients with bipolar and unipolar affective disorder | journal = Gen Hosp Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–13 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23352318 | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.11.010 }} < /ref >

 * [[Delusion]]s, like: 
 ** Delusions of grandeur: The person believes he is very important - for example, that he knows everything, or is [[Celebrity|famous]], all-powerful, or very [[Money|wealthy]] 
 ** Delusions of potential: The person believes he can do things he cannot really do (for example, believing he can build a house on his own, when he has never built anything before) 
 ** Delusions of [[persecution]]: The person believes other people are  " out to get him "  and are causing his problems on purpose 
 
 === Official diagnosis (DSM-5) === 
 In the United States, a book called [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'']] (DSM), published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], is used to [[Medical diagnosis|diagnose]] mental illnesses.  According to the latest version of the DSM, the [[DSM-5]], a person is having a  " manic episode "  if all of these things are true: < ref name=dsm / > 
 # The person's mood has been unusually [[Euphoria|euphoric]] or irritable for seven days or more 
 # The person's mood changes are not caused by illegal drugs, [[Medication|medicine]], or a medical illness 
 # The person's mania is: 
 ## Causing them obvious problems at work, with family, or friends; OR  
 ## Making them [[Psychosis|psychotic]]; OR 
 ## Making them a danger to self or others 
 In addition, the person must also have three or more of these symptoms: 
 # Inflated [[self-esteem]] or grandiosity (the person feels like he is very important and special) 
 # Needs only a little sleep to feel rested 
 # More talkative than usual; or the person seems like they have to keep talking (pressured speech) 
 # Jumping from one idea to another; or the person feels like their thoughts are racing 
 # Increase in  " goal-directed activity, "  like taking on big new projects; or  " psychomotor agitation "  (moving around a lot, unable to sit still) 
 # Being easily distracted (the person's attention is drawn too easily to things that are not important) 
 # Doing a lot of activities that have a high [[Danger|risk]] of turning out badly (for example, spending a lot of money; going on sexual adventures) 
 
 === Official diagnosis (ICD-10) === 
 [[File:DemiLovato2013.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Demi Lovato]], [[singer]], [[actor|actress]], and [[writer]] who has said they have bipolar disorder < ref > {{cite news|title='Disney' Star Demi Lovato: I'm Bipolar|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/04/20/disney-star-demi-lovato-im-bipolar/|publisher=Fox News|date=20 April 2011}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/bipolar-demi-lovato-talks-cutting-eating-disorders-2011214 |title=Bipolar Demi Lovato Talks Cutting, Eating Disorders |publisher=UsMagazine.com |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=5 August 2012}} < /ref > ]] 
 
 The [[ICD-10]] is the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] system for classifying health problems.  It describes a manic episode this way: < ref name=ICD > {{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ |title=ICD-10|format= |accessdate=18 October 2010}} < /ref > 
 * The person's mood is euphoric, and can change from being happy and carefree, to  " almost uncontrollable excitement " 
 * The person has an unusual amount of energy and is always doing some kind of activity 
 * The person seems like they have to keep talking 
 * The person does not seem to need sleep 
 * The person cannot pay attention to anything, and gets distracted very easily 
 * Often, the person feels very important, is much more confident than usual, and has unreasonable ideas about what they can do (for example, they may feel like nothing can stop them from getting what they want) 
 * The person does not have normal social inhibitions (a sense of what is right and appropriate to do around other people).  This can lead to behavior that is inappropriate, reckless, and unusual for the person. 
 
 == Causes == 
 '''Mental illness''' 
 
 Mania is usually a symptom of mental illness, most often bipolar disorder.  A diagnosis of [[Bipolar I disorder|type I bipolar disorder]] (bipolar I disorder) can be made based on a single manic episode.  This is the most common cause of mania. < ref name=dsm / >  If a person is hypomanic, they may have [[Bipolar II disorder|type II bipolar disorder]] or [[cyclothymia]]. < ref name= " ICD "  / >   If a person has psychosis that lasts longer than their mania, they may have [[schizoaffective disorder]]. < ref name= " ICD "  / > 
 
 '''Medical causes''' 
 
 Mania is usually caused by a mental illness.  However, some medical illnesses can cause symptoms of mania.  Some doctors use the [[mnemonic]] E-MANIC to remember the possible medical causes of mania: < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Khouzam, M.D., MPH |first1=Hani Raoul |last2=Gill, M.D. |first2=Tirath S. |date=February 2008 |title=Use  " E-MANIC "  for secondary mania workup |url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/the-publication/past-issue-single-view/use-e-manic-for-secondary-mania-workup/f0dd508987a1454ab122621a792873ca.html |journal=Current Psychiatry |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=|doi= |accessdate=January 21, 2016}} < /ref > 
 * '''[[Endocrine system|E]]'''[[Endocrine system|ndocrine]]: [[Hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]], or [[Cushing's syndrome]] can cause mania.  (These are all problems with [[hormone]]s in the body) 
 * '''[[Medication|M]]'''[[Medication|edications]]: Many different medications can have mania as [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]].  These medications include [[amphetamine]]s (often used to treat [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]], or ADHD); [[antidepressant]]s; [[corticosteroid]]s; [[Opioid|opiate painkillers]], and many others. 
 * '''A'''buse of [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] or [[illegal drugs]]: Alcohol and many other drugs can cause mania.  These drugs include [[cocaine]], [[Methamphetamine|amphetamines]], [[phencyclidine]] (PCP), [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD), [[inhalant]]s, [[Opioid|opiates]], anabolic [[steroid]]s, and [[Ecstasy (drug)|MDMA (Ecstasy)]]. 
 * '''[[Neurology|N]]'''[[Neurology|eurologic]] problems: Many different problems with the [[brain]] can cause mania.  For example, [[brain tumor]]s, [[Brain damage|brain injury]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Huntington's disease]] can all cause manic symptoms. 
 * '''[[Infection|I]]'''[[Infection|nfection]]: Infections in the brain can cause mania.  Examples include [[meningitis]], brain infections caused by [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and neurosyphilis (the last stage of [[syphilis]], when the disease reaches the brain) 
 * '''[[Cardiovascular system|C]]'''[[Cardiovascular system|ardiovascular]] causes and '''[[Stroke|C]]'''[[Stroke|erebrovascular accidents]] (strokes) 
 
 Not having enough [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B-12]] (vitamin B-12 deficiency) can also cause mania and psychosis. < ref name= " ijnwvitaminb12 " > {{cite journal |author=Sethi NK, Robilotti E, Sadan Y |title=Neurological Manifestations Of Vitamin B-12 Deficiency |journal=The Internet Journal of Nutrition and Wellness |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=}} < /ref > < ref name= " imajvitaminb12 " > {{cite journal |author=Masalha R, Chudakov B, Muhamad M, Rudoy I, Volkov I, Wirguin I |title=Cobalamin-responsive psychosis as the sole manifestation of vitamin B < sub > 12 < /sub >  deficiency |journal=Israeli Medical Association Journal |volume=3 |year=2001 |pages=701–703 |doi= |url=http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/dynamic/web/ArtFromPubmed.asp?year=2001 & month=09 & page=701 |access-date=2016-01-21 |archive-date=2012-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307014434/http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/dynamic/web/ArtFromPubmed.asp?year=2001 & month=09 & page=701 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 ==Medical treatment== 
 If mania is caused by a medical problem, the best thing to do is to treat that medical problem. 
 
 If mania is caused by a mental illness, the best treatment is a combination of medicines and [[psychotherapy]] (talking with a therapist or [[counselor]]). 
 
 Doctors usually treat mania with a combination of [[mood stabilizer]]s and [[antipsychotic]] medicines. < ref name= " pmid21851976 " > {{cite journal | author = Cipriani A, Barbui C, Salanti G, Rendell J, Brown R, Stockton S, Purgato M, Spineli LM, Goodwin GM, Geddes JR | title = Comparative efficacy and acceptability of antimanic drugs in acute mania: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9799 | pages = 1306–15 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21851976 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60873-8 | s2cid = 25512763 }} < /ref >   While taking these medicines, the patient should see their doctor regularly to be checked for [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]].  
   
 When the symptoms of mania have ended, long-term treatment then focuses on [[prophylactic|preventative]] treatment.  The goal of this kind of treatment is to prevent periods of mania or depression from happening.  Very often, this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy.  Medication works best for bipolar disorder, and other mental illnesses, when it is combined with other treatments like psychotherapy. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/bipolar_disorder_medications.htm/ |title=The Bipolar Medication Guide |author=Melinda Smith, M.A., Lawrence Robinson, Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., and Damon Ramsey, MD |publisher=HelpGuide.org |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-date=10 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310190007/http://helpguide.org/mental/bipolar_disorder_medications.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >
