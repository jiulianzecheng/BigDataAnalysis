 An '''injection''', known as a shot is putting [[liquid]] into the [[body]], usually with a [[hypodermic needle|needle]] and a syringe. There are many different kinds of injections, such as: 
 * Intradermal (just under the top layer of the [[skin]]) 
 * Subcutaneous (into the [[fat]] layer under the skin) 
 * Intramuscular (into a [[muscle]]) 
 * [[Intravenous]] (into a [[vein]])  
 * Intraosseous (into a bone) 
 * Intraperitoneal (into the [[abdomen|abdominal]] cavity) 
 
 Injections can be used to prevent illness or to give medicine. 
 
 Injections that prevent illness put a dead or weakened version of the [[virus]] they want to prevent into the body. The body then 'remembers' the virus to make future encounters of the virus easier to manage.
