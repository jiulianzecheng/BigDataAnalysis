 '''Muhi al-Din Muhammad''' ({{Lang-ar|محی الدین محمد|translit=Muḥī al-Dīn Muḥammad}}), better known as '''Aurangzeb''' ({{Lang-ar|اورنگ‌زیب}}) was the sixth emperor of the [[Mughal Empire]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=Dictionary of Wars|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781135954949|location=Hoboken|page=387}} < /ref > < ref name= " Thackeray " > {{cite book|title=Events that formed the modern world : from the European Renaissance through the War on Terror|last1=Thackeray|first1=Frank W.|date=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598849011|editor-last=John E. Findling|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|page=248}} < /ref >  He ruled over the majority of [[South Asia]] and imposed [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia]] law. His reign lasted for 49 years, from 1658 until he died in 1707. During this time, Aurangzeb greatly expanded the territory of the Mughal Empire with victories in South India. He was the last of the most powerful rulers of the Mughal dynasty. After his death, the power of the Mughal Empire declined quickly due to ineffective successors and the rise of the [[Maratha]] Empire. < ref name= " cs2013 " > {{cite book|last=Seiple|first=Chris|title=The Routledge handbook of religion and security|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-415-66744-9|location=New York|page=96}} < /ref > 
 
 His rule saw the spread of [[Islam]] in South Asia, and Islamic law was strictly imposed on subjects, which led to dissatisfaction among the non-Muslim population towards the Mughal rule. < ref > {{cite journal | last=McLeod | first=Hew | title=Sikhs and Muslims in the Punjab | journal=South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies | publisher=Taylor  &  Francis | volume=22 | issue=sup001 | year=1999 | issn=0085-6401 | doi=10.1080/00856408708723379 | pages=155–165}} < /ref >  Aurangzeb is often considered the most controversial [[Mughal]] ruler in India, as his rule involved the imposition of a discriminatory jizya tax on non-Muslims and the demolition of many [[Hindu]] temples. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/how-to/why-aurangzeb-is-so-controversial-here-is-everything-you-should-know-about-the-mughal-emperor/articleshow/100893118.cms|title=Why Aurangzeb is so controversial?

 ==Trade  &  Commerce== 
 His administration of the Mughal Empire led to its apex in terms of territory and wealth. Emperor Aurangzeb's exchequer raised a record £100 million in annual revenue through various sources like taxes, customs, and land revenue. He had annual yearly revenue of $450 million, more than ten times that of his contemporary {Louis XIV of France}. He was popular with traders as he abolished many local taxes levied by the previous rulers  
 
 == Islamic Laws == 
 He reintroduced the practice of Jaziya, an additional tax on non-muslim subjects. He also banned the consumption of alcohol and singing in court. Under his rule, Islamic scholars compiled the Fatawa Alamgiri, which served as the Islamic law of India for several centuries. < ref > {{cite journal |first=Katherine Butler |last=Brown |date=January 2007 |title=Did Aurangzeb Ban Music?

 ==Conflicts with the Rajputs  &  Sikhs== 
 Aurangzeb had to deal with the [[Rajput]] rulers of Marwar, Mewar, and Jaipur states. Raja Jaswant Singh of Marwar, an ally of the Mughals, was deputed to the north-western frontier, where he died fighting the Afghan rebels in 1678. With no apparent successor to the throne of Marwar, it was occupied by Aurangzeb. Meanwhile, a son of Jaswant Singh, Ajit Singh, was born and claimed the throne, which Aurangzeb refused. This began a Rajput struggle against the [[Mughals]] until Aurangzeb's successor recognized Ajit Singh as the ruler of Marwar. < ref name= " cs2013 " > {{cite book|last=Seiple|first=Chris|title=The Routledge handbook of religion and security|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-415-66744-9|location=New York|page=96}} < /ref >
