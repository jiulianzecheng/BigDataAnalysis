 A '''vaccine''' is a biological preparation. It is given to prevent a specific [[infectious disease|infectious or malignant disease]]. It only works against the [[microorganism]] for which it is prepared. It is usually given by [[injection]], and called [[vaccination]].   
 
 At its best, vaccination gives [[immunity]] to an [[infectious disease]] caused by a particular microorganism ([[bacteria]] or [[virus]]). For example, the [[Influenza|flu]] vaccine makes it very much less likely that a person will get the flu. The flu virus continually changes, and has many strains. That is why re-vaccination is needed every year.  
 
 At first, vaccines were usually made from something that is [[Life|alive]], or was alive. Now they may be built up by viral biochemistry. Each vaccine has its own history, and what is true of one might not be true of another. 
 
 The word  " vaccine "  comes from the [[Latin]] ''vacca'', meaning  " [[cow]] " ).  In 1796, [[Edward Jenner]] used a milkmaid infected with [[cowpox]] (''variolae vaccinae'') to protect people against [[smallpox]]. < ref name= " Stern-Markel " > {{cite journal |author= Stern A.M.  &  Markel H. |title= The history of vaccines and immunization: familiar patterns, new challenges |journal= Health Affairs |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=611–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15886151 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/24/3/611}} < /ref >  The use of vaccines is called [[vaccination]]. 
 
 Vaccination had been done before Jenner. < ref >  Williams G 2010. ''Angel of Death''. Palgrave Macmillan. ISBN 978-0-230-27471-6 < /ref >  Powdered smallpox material was blown up the nostrils of the subject. 
 
 == History == 
 [[Edward Jenner]] created the first vaccine in the 1770s. At this time, [[smallpox]] was a deadly disease. Jenner noticed that people who had already had [[cowpox]] (a disease that is related to smallpox) usually did not get [[smallpox]]. He thought that getting cowpox protected people against smallpox. 
 
 To test this idea, Jenner [[Inoculation|gave a boy cowpox]]. Then he infected the boy with smallpox. The boy did not get sick because he had already had cowpox. Jenner was right: having cowpox protected people against smallpox. 
 
 Because cowpox [[inoculation]] made fewer people sick than smallpox [[inoculation]], England made smallpox inoculation [[illegal]] in 1840. In 1853, they made another law that said every child had to be vaccinated against smallpox using Jenner's vaccine. 
 
 In the 19th century, [[Louis Pasteur]] made a [[rabies]] vaccine. 
 
 In the 20th century, [[scientist]]s created vaccines to protect people against [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[rubella]]. In the 1950s, [[Jonas Salk]] created the [[polio vaccine]]. 
 
 However, vaccines still do not exist for many important diseases, like [[malaria]] and [[HIV]]. < ref name= " Stern-Markel "  / > 
 
 Many countries have passed ''compulsory vaccination laws'' – laws that require certain people to get vaccinated. < ref name= " Stern-Markel "  / >  For example, in many countries, children have to be vaccinated against certain diseases in order to go to [[public school]]. On the other hand, there are some religions which ban all forms of vaccination: the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] is an example. 
 
 ==Types of vaccines== 
 There are many different types of vaccines. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,4866,00.html|title=The Main Types of Vaccines|access-date=2010-12-21|archive-date=2010-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123163058/http://www.drspock.com/article/0%2C1510%2C4866%2C00.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 One common type of vaccine is a  " live vaccine " . This type of vaccine contains a small amount of a live virus or bacteria. Before the vaccine is given, scientists weaken the virus or bacteria so it cannot make a person sick. When a person gets a live vaccine, their [[immune system]] learns to recognize and fight off that virus or bacteria.  hen, if the person is exposed to the virus or bacteria in the future, their immune system will already  " know "  how to fight it off. Examples of live vaccines include vaccines for measles, mumps, and [[chickenpox]]. 
 
 Another common type of vaccine is an  " inactivated vaccine " . These vaccines contain dead viruses or bacteria. These do not cause the immune system to react as strongly as live vaccines. Because of this, people may need  " booster shots "  – extra doses of the vaccine, given at certain times, so their immune system can  " learn "  how to fight off the infection. Examples of inactivated vaccines include vaccines for [[pertussis]] (whooping cough), [[rabies]], and [[hepatitis B]]. 
 
 In other vaccines, only a protein molecule from the virus or bacterium is injected into the patient. The protein is enough for the patient's immune system to recognize the whole germ. 
 
 With [[messenger RNA vaccines]], only the messenger RNA (mRNA), which acts as a blueprint or recipe for the protein, is injected into the patient. The first mRNA vaccines were made in the 1990s, but scientists did not make large numbers of them until the 2010s.  Some mRNA vaccines work against cancer and can make tumors smaller. < ref name= " Horizon " > {{cite news|url=https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/five-things-you-need-know-about-mrna-vaccines.html|title=Five things you need to know about: mRNA vaccines|date=April 1, 2020|access-date=May 1, 2020|author=Joanna Roberts|publisher=Horizon|archive-date=April 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404043837/https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/five-things-you-need-know-about-mrna-vaccines.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref name= " Nature " > {{cite journal|date=January 12, 2018|title=mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology|pages=261–279|volume=18|doi=10.1038/nrd.2017.243|author1= Norbert Pardi|author2= Michael J. Hogan|author3= Frederick W. Porter|author4=Drew Weissman|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|issue=4|pmid=29326426|pmc=5906799}} < /ref >   
 
 == Effectiveness ==  
 Vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. < ref > {{cite journal | pmid = 19393917 | year = 2009 | last1 = Grammatikos | first1 = A.P. | last2 = Mantadakis | first2 = E. | last3 = Falagas | first3 = M.E. | title = Meta-analyses on pediatric infections and vaccines | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_infectious-disease-clinics-of-north-america_2009-06_23_2/page/431 | journal = Infectious Disease Clinics of North America | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 431–457 | doi = 10.1016/j.idc.2009.01.008 }} < /ref >   In other words, a person can get a disease that they were vaccinated against. 
 
 Sometimes, this happens because the person's immune system did not respond to the vaccine (it did not  " learn "  how to fight off the disease after the person got the vaccine). This may happen because the person's immune system is already weak (for example, because of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[HIV|HIV infection]], old age, or [[steroid]] use). It may also happen because the person's immune system cannot make the particular [[B cell]]s which make the antibodies that stick to the pathogen. 
 
 Some vaccines work better than others at protecting people from a disease. The decrease in getting the disease is called efficacy. For example, if 80% fewer vaccinated people get the disease, 80% is the efficacy. There are many reasons for different efficacy: 
 * [[Vaccination]] works better for some diseases than for others 
 * The vaccine may be for a certain strain of a disease. If a person gets a different strain of the disease, they can still get sick. < ref > {{cite journal|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/319/7206/352|title=Comparative efficacy of three mumps vaccines during disease outbreak in eastern Switzerland: cohort study|first1=Pietro L.|last1=Vernazza|first2=Renato L.|last2=Galeazzi|first3=Joseph J.|last3=Osterwalder|first4=Matthias|last4=Schlegel|date=7 August 1999|journal=BMJ|volume=319|issue=7206|pages=352|via=www.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7206.352|pmid=10435956|pmc=32261}} < /ref > 
 * Vaccines usually do not have permanent effects, so a person might need many different vaccinations on a [[schedule]]. If a person missed a scheduled vaccine, they might lose their protection against a disease. 
 * Some people are  " non-responders "  to certain vaccines.  This means that their immune systems just do not create antibodies to fight off a disease, even after they are vaccinated correctly. 
 * Other things, like ethnicity, age, and genetics, can affect how a person reacts to a vaccine. In some cases, larger doses are used for older people (50–75 years and up), whose immune response to a given vaccine is not as strong. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123406640|title=Adapting Vaccines For Our Aging Immune Systems|website=[[NPR]]}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Controversy== 
 Since vaccines first existed, there have been people who did not agree with the idea of using vaccines. < ref name=wolfesharp > {{cite journal |author=Wolfe R, Sharp L |title=Anti-vaccinationists past and present |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=430–2 |year=2002 |pmid=12193361 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.430 |pmc=1123944 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/325/7361/430}} < /ref >  Around the world, most scientists and doctors agree that the benefits of using vaccines are much greater than the risks. The [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] from vaccines are rare. Not vaccinating people is a much greater risk, because vaccines prevent suffering and death from [[infectious disease]]s. < ref name= " BH " > {{cite journal |journal=Curr Opin Infect Dis |year=2007 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=237–46 |title=Adverse events following immunization: perception and evidence |author=Bonhoeffer J, Heininger U |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32811ebfb0 |pmid=17471032|s2cid=40669829 }} < /ref > < ref name= " Cochrane " > {{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub2 |pmid=16235361 |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |author=Demicheli V. |editor1-first=Vittorio |editor1-last=Demicheli |display-authors = etal |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=CD004407 }} < /ref > 
 
 There have been [[Controversy|controversies]] over using vaccines such as whether vaccines are safe, the amount of research and whether it is [[Morals|morally]] right to force people to get vaccinated. 
 
 Some [[Religion|religious]] groups do not allow uses of vaccines. < ref name= " Cochrane "  / > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Sinal S.H; Cabinum-Foeller E  &  Socolar R. |title=Religion and medical neglect |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_southern-medical-journal_2008-07_101_7/page/703 |journal=South Med J |volume=101 |issue=7 |pages=703–6 |year=2008 |pmid=18580731 |doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31817997c9 |s2cid=29738930 }} < /ref > 
 
 Some [[Politics|political]] groups argue that people should be able to choose whether or not to get vaccinated. They argue that laws requiring people to get vaccinated violate [[Liberty|individual rights]]. < ref name= " wolfesharp "  / >  In response, one study says:  " Vaccine refusal not only increases the individual risk of disease but also increases the risk for the whole community " . < ref > Saad B. Omer ''et al'' 2009. Vaccine refusal, mandatory immunization, and the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases. ''New England Journal of Medicine''. '''360''':1981-1988 (original), 2009 reissue. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/360/19/1981] < /ref > 
 
 Some parents choose not to follow the regular vaccine schedule for their children. One study looked at parents of children ages six months to six years old.  It found that 13% of these parents reported following an alternative vaccination schedule. However, of these parents, less than 1 out of every 5 reported refusing all vaccines. Most refused only certain vaccines, and/or delayed some vaccines until the child was older. 
 
 Parents who delay vaccines until their children are older are often concerned about their child's immune system being too young and weak to handle getting many vaccines at once. However, this is a technical issue which is best decided by experts. 
 
 == Economics of development and patents == 
 [[File:Polio vaccine poster.jpg|thumb|This 1963 poster features the CDC's national [[mascot]] of [[public health]], the  " Wellbee " , encouraging people to get an oral polio vaccine.]] 
 
 One challenge in developing vaccines is [[Economics|economic]]. The diseases that most need vaccines today – [[HIV]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] – exist mostly in [[Developing country|poor countries]]. Companies that make vaccines would not make much money because many of the people who need them are too [[Poverty|poor]] to pay for them.  There would also be financial and other risks to these companies if they tried making new vaccines for these diseases. < ref name='market_return' > {{cite news | first=Jesse L. | last=Goodman | title=Statement of Jesse L. Goodman M.D., M.P.H. Director, Center for Biologics, Evaluation and Research Before the Committee on Energy and Commerce United States House of Representatives | date=2005-05-04 | url =http://www.fda.gov/ola/2005/influenza0504.html | access-date = 2008-06-15 }} < /ref > 
 
 Throughout history, most vaccines have been developed by [[government]]s, [[University|universities]], and [[non-profit organization]]s. < ref > {{Cite journal |author=Olesen O.F; Lonnroth A; Mulligan B. |title=Human vaccine research in the European Union |journal=Vaccine |year=2009 |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=640–5 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.064 |pmid=19059446 |pmc=7115654 }} < /ref >  Many vaccines have been highly cost-effective and good for [[public health]]. < ref name='market_return' / >  In recent decades, the number of vaccines given throughout the world has increased dramatically.

 Another obstacle to making new vaccines is that when a new vaccine is made, the maker usually files a [[patent]] on their vaccine. These patents can limit the process used to make the vaccine to the maker (in practice the right can be subcontracted). That way the patent makes money for the originator. < ref > {{cite journal |author= Hardman, Reis T. |title= The role of intellectual property in the global challenge for immunization |journal= J World Intellect Prop |year=2006 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=413–25 |doi=10.1111/j.1422-2213.2006.00284.x}} < /ref > 
 
 == Additional components in vaccines == 
 Vaccines often contain other things besides the active vaccine (the weakened or dead virus or bacteria). For example, vaccines may contain: < ref name=cdc > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm |author=CDC| title=Ingredients of Vaccines – Fact Sheet|access-date=December 20, 2009}} < /ref > 
 * [[Aluminum]] salts or gels. These are added to help the immune system respond earlier, and more strongly, to the vaccine. They allow a lower dose of the vaccine to be given. 
 * [[Antibiotic]]s are added to some vaccines to prevent bacteria from growing while the vaccine is being made or stored. 
 [[File:Preparation of measles vaccines.jpg|thumb|left|Two workers make openings in chicken eggs as they prepare to make measles vaccines]] 
 * Egg [[protein]] is present in [[influenza]] and [[yellow fever]] vaccines, because they are made using chicken eggs. Vaccines may also contain other proteins. 
 * [[Formaldehyde]] is used to kill bacteria for certain vaccines. It is also used to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might get into the vaccine while it is being made. 
 * [[Monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) and 2-[[phenoxyethanol]] are used as stabilizers in a few vaccines to make sure the vaccine does not change if it is exposed to heat, light, [[acid]]ity, or [[humidity]]. 
 * [[Thimerosal]] is a [[preservative]] that contains [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. It is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose, to keep harmful bacteria from growing in the vaccine. 
 
 Preservatives in vaccines, such as [[thiomersal]], [[phenoxyethanol]], and [[formaldehyde]], prevent serious adverse effects. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, lasts longer in storage, and makes the vaccine stronger, safer, and more stable (less likely to be changed by things like heat). However, in the United States, the [[European Union]], and a few other [[First World|developed countries]], it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines because it contains mercury. < ref > {{cite journal |journal= Drug Saf |year=2005 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=89–101 |title= Thiomersal in vaccines: balancing the risk of adverse effects with the risk of vaccine-preventable disease |author= Bigham M.  &  Copes R. |pmid=15691220 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200528020-00001|s2cid=11570020 }} < /ref > 
 
 If no preservative is added to a vaccine, harmful bacteria may grow in the vaccine. For example, in 1928, ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' bacteria grew in a diphtheria vaccine that had no preservative in it. Of 21 children who got that vaccine, 12 died. < ref > {{cite web |date=2007-09-06 |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM096228 |access-date=2007-10-01 |title= Thimerosal in vaccines |publisher= Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration}} < /ref > [[File:Poliodrops.jpg|thumb|A child is vaccinated against [[poliomyelitis]]. This vaccine can be given orally, such as a few drops of liquid on a piece of sugar.]] 
 
 Most versions of anti-[[coronavirus]] are kept at very low temperature before use. That helps preserve the vaccine in its most effective state. 
 
 == Use in veterinary medicine == 
 Animals are vaccinated to keep them from getting diseases, and to keep them from infecting humans with diseases. < ref > {{cite journal | pmid = 19402200 | year = 2009 | last1 = Patel | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Heldens | first2 = J.G. | title = Immunoprophylaxis against important virus disease of horses, farm animals and birds | journal = Vaccine | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 1797–1810 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.12.063 | pmc = 7130586 }} < /ref >  [[Pet]]s as well as [[livestock]] are routinely vaccinated. 
 
 In some instances, [[population]]s of wild animals may be vaccinated. Sometimes, wild animals are vaccinated by spreading vaccine-laced food in a disease-prone area. This method has been used to try to control [[rabies]] in [[raccoon]]s. Where rabies occurs, laws may require dogs to get rabies vaccinations. 
 
 Dogs can also be vaccinated against many other diseases, including [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[adenovirus-2]], [[leptospirosis]], [[bordetella|bordatella]], [[canine parainfluenza virus]], and [[Lyme disease]]. 
 
 == Several trends in vaccine development == 
 * Nowadays, vaccines are given to people of all ages. < ref name=Plotkin > {{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |title=Vaccines: past, present and future |journal=Nat Med |volume=11 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S5–11 |year=2005 |pmid=15812490 |doi=10.1038/nm1209 |pmc=7095920 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Carlson B |year=2008 |title=Adults now drive growth of vaccine market |journal=Genet Eng Biotechnol News |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=22–3 |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=2490 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 * Combinations of vaccines are becoming more common. Vaccines containing five or more parts are used in many parts of the world. < ref name=Plotkin/ > 
 * New methods of giving vaccines are being developed. Some of these new delivery systems include skin patches, [[aerosol]]s given through [[Inhaler|inhalation devices]], and eating [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] plants. < ref name=Plotkin/ > 
 * Scientists are designing vaccines to make people's natural immune responses stronger. < ref name=Plotkin/ > 
 * Scientists are trying to make vaccines to help cure chronic infections, instead of only preventing disease. < ref name=Plotkin/ > 
 * [[Public health]] officials might change their strategies for giving vaccines based on differences in how men, women, and pregnant women react to vaccines. < ref > {{cite journal |author=Klein SL, Jedlicka A, Pekosz A |title=The Xs and Y of immune responses to viral vaccines |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=338–49 |date=May 2010  |pmid=20417416 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(10)70049-9 |pmc=6467501 }} < /ref >
