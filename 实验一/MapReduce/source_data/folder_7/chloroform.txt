 '''Chloroform''' (also called '''trichloromethane''') is a [[chemical substance]]. It is an [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[Chemical compound|compound]]. Chloroform is one of the [[wikt:intermediate|intermediate]] substances that occur in the production of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]], better known as ''Teflon''. Chloroform is used as a [[solvent]]. It is a colourless liquid. In the [[19th century]], it was a widely used [[anaesthetic]]. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Chloroform.html |title=Chloroform - used, first, anesthetic, blood, body, Anesthetic Chloroform, Simpson Discovers Chloroforms Potency |first= |last= |work=discoveriesinmedicine.com |date=2012 |accessdate=17 July 2012}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 The first who reported to have produced Chloroform was the French [[chemist]] [[Eugène Soubeiran]], in 1831. Soubeiran took [[acetone]] and [[ethanol]], and used [[bleach]] powder for the reaction. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Eugène Soubeiran|year=1831|title=Annales de Chimie et de Physique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbE7zQEACAAJ|journal=Ann.

 == Production == 
 Chloroform is produced by mixing [[methane]] and [[chlorine]] at a temperature of 400 to 500[[Degree Celsius|°C]]. In this reaction, the result is a mix of [[chloromethane]], [[methylene chloride]], chloroform and [[carbon tetrachloride]].

 : < math > \mathrm{CHCl_3 + Cl_2 \longrightarrow CCl_4 + HCl} < /math > 
 
 The four [[chemical compounds|compounds]] get then separated with a [[distillation]]. 
 
 In [[laboratory|laboratories]], chloroform can be produced by mixing [[sodium hypochlorite]] and [[acetone]] together. This is an [[exothermic reaction]], meaning it makes a lot of heat. 
 
 == Uses == 
 The main uses of Chloroform are: 
 * as a [[solvent]] 
 * as an [[anaesthetic]] (though no longer used, as there are side-effects) 
 * as a [[catalyst]] to help other reactions

 Chloroform was used as an anaesthetic during childbirth and surgery, from about 1847. It replaced [[diethyl ether|ether]] which was used before. Chloroform is very [[poison]]ous, and can cause breathing problems, and problems with the heart. Death from chloroform can come from [[cardiac arrest]]. When Chloroform is stored for a longer time period, it can decay into [[Phosgene]]. Phosgene was a [[chemical weapon]] (poison gas) used during the [[First World War]]. Chloroform can cause [[birth defect]]s and lead to [[miscarriage]]s. It may cause [[cancer]].
