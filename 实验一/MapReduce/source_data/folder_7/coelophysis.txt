 '''''Coelophysis''''' was a small fast running [[carnivorous]] [[dinosaur]]. It is one of the earliest known [[genera]] of dinosaur. ''Coelophysis'' was found in [[Upper Triassic]] [[strata]] dated to about 200 [[million]] years ago (mya). It lived in what is now the southwestern [[United States]]. Similar dinosaurs are found all over the world at that time. 
 
 ''Coelophysis'' walked on two legs (as did all [[theropod]]s). It was no more than about three feet (1 meter) tall at the hips but because of a long tail could be almost 10 feet (3 meters) long. There is some evidence that these animals hunted in packs, from the large numbers found together at the [[Ghost Ranch]] fossil [[site]] in [[New Mexico]]. < ref name= " Colbert89 " > Colbert, Edwin 1989.

 == Lifestyle == 
 === Sexual dimorphism === 
 Two different sizes of this [[species]] have been found in the fossil record. At first [[paleontologist]]s thought that they were two different species, but most now think that this is because ''Coelophysis'' [[male]]s were larger than the [[female]]s. This [[Trait (biology)|trait]], known as [[sexual dimorphism]], is often seen today in many animal species. 
 
 === Vision === 
 ''Coelophysis'' had a long narrow head (approximately {{Convert|270|mm|ft|1|abbr=on}}), with large, forward-facing eyes that afforded it [[stereoscopic vision]] and as a result excellent depth perception. The eyes were supported by bony rings ( " sclerotic "  rings). The complete sclerotic ring of a juvenile ''Coelophysis bauri'' was compared to those of reptiles and birds. Evidently ''Coelophysis'' was a daytime predator which hunted by sight. < ref name= " rinehart2004 " > {{cite journal|authors=Rinehart L.F. |display-authors = etal |year=2004|title=The sclerotic ring of the Late Triassic theropod dinosaur ''Coelophysis''|journal=New Mexico Geological Society Spring Meeting|volume=26|page=64}} < /ref >  The study found that its vision was superior to that of most lizards, and ranked with that of modern birds of prey. < ref > Rinehart L.F.

 === Conditions of find === 
 For a while, it was thought that ''Coelophysis'' were [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]], because what looked like ''Coelophysis'' babies were seen in the stomach of an adult ''Coelophysis''. However, these specimens were misinterpreted. Several specimens of  " juvenile coelophysids "  were actually small [[Crurotarsi|crurotarsan]] reptiles such as ''[[Hesperosuchus]]''. In some cases bigger individuals were crushed on top of smaller ones. There is no longer any evidence to support cannibalistic behavior in ''Coelophysis''. < ref > Gay, Robert J. 2002.

 == History of its discovery == 
 [[Edward Drinker Cope]] first named ''Coelophysis'' in 1889. < ref > Cope E.D. 1889. On a new genus of Triassic Dinosauria. ''American Naturalist''. '''23''', 626 < /ref >  This was during the  " [[Bone Wars]] "  with [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. An amateur [[fossil]] collector, David Baldwin, found the first remains of the dinosaur in 1881. The [[type species]], ''C. bauri'' was named after him. These first finds were too poorly preserved to give a complete picture of the new dinosaur. 
 
 In 1947, a substantial 'graveyard' of ''Coelophysis'' fossils was found in [[New Mexico]], at [[Ghost Ranch]], close to the original find. So many fossils together were probably the result of a [[flash flood]], which swept away a large number of ''Coelophysis'' and buried them quickly and simultaneously. It seems such flooding was commonplace at the time. The [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]] of nearby [[Arizona]] was caused by a log jam of tree trunks caught in a flood. 
 
 The Ghost Ranch specimens were numerous, with many well-preserved specimens. Since the Ghost Ranch specimens were discovered, more skeletons have been found in Arizona, New Mexico and an as-yet unconfirmed specimen from [[Utah]], including both adults and juveniles. The [[stratum|deposit]]s where ''Coelophysis'' was discovered date from the late [[Triassic]], but similar specimens have been found in the [[Lower Jurassic]] elsewhere in the world. 
 
 ''Coelophysis'' is the state fossil of New Mexico. Examples have also been found in Southern Africa. < ref > Bond G. 1965.
