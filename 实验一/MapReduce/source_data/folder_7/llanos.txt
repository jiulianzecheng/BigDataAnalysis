 The '''Llanos''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Los Llanos'',  " The Plains " ; {{IPA-es|loz ˈʝanos}}) are a very big [[tropical grassland]] [[plain|on flat land]] east of the [[Andes]] Mountains.  The Llanos are in [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], in northwestern South America. Ecologists call them an [[ecoregion]].  They put them in the same group with other [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] [[grassland]]s, [[savanna]]s, and [[shrubland|places where small trees and bushes grow]]. 
 
 ==Geography== 
 The Llanos go east to west. The Andes Mountains are on the west side of the Llanos and the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]] of mountains are north of the Llanos. The [[Guiana Highlands]] are to the southeast, and the [[Negro-Branco moist forests]] are to the southwest. To the east the [[Orinoco wetlands]] and [[Orinoco Delta swamp forests]] in the [[Orinoco Delta]]. < ref name = wwf > {{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0709|name=Llanos}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Orinoco]] River is the biggest river in the Llanos.  The Orinoco River goes from west to east. The Orinoco is the biggest and most important river in Venezuela. < ref name= " Llanos wetlands during the rainy season " > {{cite book|title=Earth|url=https://archive.org/details/earth0000unse_q8s8|publisher=Doring Kindersley|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/earth0000unse_q8s8/page/328 328]|isbn=1-4053-0018-3}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Climate== 
 The Llanos have a [[tropical savanna climate]] and [[tropical monsoon climate]]. The rainy part of the year is April to November.  The dry season is from December to March. The wettest months are typically June and July. In the southwest, the llanos get as much as {{convert|3000|mm|in|-1}} of rain per year in the southwest, {{convert|1200|to|1600|mm|in|-0}} in [[Apure]] State, and {{convert|800|to|1200|mm|in|-0}} per year in the Llanos of [[Monagas]] State in the northeast. The average temperature across the whole year is {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, and it does not change much with the seasons; the coldest months (June, July, December, and January) are only {{convert|2|C-change|F-change|1|disp=or}} colder than the hottest months. < ref name=wwf/ > 
 
 ==Plants== 
 The Llanos have open grasslands, savannas with some trees, and small forests.  The most common forest in the Llanos is [[gallery forest]]s that grow next to rivers and streams. The Llanos have grasslands that flood for part of the year ''llano bajo'' or  " low llano " ) and grasslands that stay dry (''llano alto''  " high llano " ). < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 The grass and [[shrub|woody plant]]s in the llano alto are 30–100 & nbsp;cm high, forming [[tussock (grass)|bunches]] 10 to 30 & nbsp;cm apart. The ground is typically sandy and does not have many food chemicals for the plants. The llano alto covers approximately two-thirds of the Llanos in Venezuela and much of the Colombian Llanos. There are many grasses in the genus ''[[Trachypogon]]'': species include ''[[Trachypogon plumosus]]'', ''[[Trachypogon vestitus|T. vestitus]]'', ''[[Axonopus canescens]]'', ''[[Axonopus anceps|A. anceps]]'', ''[[Andropogon selloanus]]'', ''[[Aristida]]'' spp., ''[[Leptocoryphium lanatum]]'', ''[[Paspalum carinatum]]'', ''[[Sporobolus indicus]]'', and ''[[Sporobolus cubensis|S. cubensis]]'', and [[sedge]]s in the genera ''[[Rhynchospora]]'' and ''[[Bulbostylis]]''. Woody plants and green plants are [[legume]]s in the genera ''[[Mimosa]]'', ''[[Cassia (genus)|Cassia]]'', ''[[Desmodium]]'', ''[[Eriosema]]'', ''[[Galactia]]'', ''[[Indigofera]]'', ''[[Phaseolus]]'', ''[[Stylosanthes]]'', ''[[Tephrosia]]'', and ''[[Zornia]]''. The trees manteco (''[[Byrsonima crassifolia]]''),  chaparro (''[[Curatella americana]]''), and alcornoque (''[[Bowdichia virgilioides]]'') are the most common. They can grow apart from each other.  When they grow togehter, they are called ''matas''.  The matas can be as small as 12 meters across or as large as a [[hectare]]. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 During the rainy season, parts of the Llanos can flood.  The flood water can be a meter deep. Then the [[savannas]]s and [[grassland]]s become [[wetland]]s.  They become like the [[Pantanal]] of central South America. Water birds and other animals come to live in the flooded Llanos. The Llanos that flood are called llano bajo.  The Llanos bajos have soil with more food chemicals in them, so different plants grow there, for example the grass ''[[Paspalum fasciculatum]]'' and the trees ''[[Copernicia tectorum]]'' and gallery forest trees. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 The gallery forests that grow near rivers have both evergreen forests on the Llanos that flood and semi-deciduous forests in the high Llanos that do not flood. ''Morichales'' are forests that flood part of the year.  They have the [[Mauritia flexuosa|moriche palm]] (''Mauritia flexuosa''). Vegas are evergreen forests that flood part of the year.  They grow near the Orinoco river and its smaller rivers. Trees form a [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] 8 to 20 meters high, and include ''[[Inga]]'' spp., ''[[Combretum frangulifolium]], [[Gustavia augusta]], [[Pterocarpus]]'' sp., ''[[Etaballia dubia]], [[Spondias mombin]]'', and ''[[Copaifera pubiflora]]''. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 Semi-deciduous forests grow above flood level. They form a canopy 12 to 15 meters high. The trees that grow there are, for example, ''[[Tabebuia billbergii]]'', ''[[Godmania aesculifolia]]'', ''[[Cassia moschata]]'', ''Spondias mombin'', ''Copaifera pubiflora'', ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'', ''[[Cordia]]'' spp., ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Cochlospermum vitifolium]]'', ''[[Hura crepitans]]'', and ''[[Acacia glomerosa]]''. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 Matorrales are places with woody plants that grow 5 to 8 meters high. There are large matorrales in the middles of the Venezuelan Llanos. Scientists think they might have been dry forests long ago. They include woody plants, for example ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'', ''[[Randia aculeata]]'', ''[[Godmania aesculifolia]]'', ''[[Pereskia guamacho]]'', ''[[Prosopis]]'' spp., ''[[Xylosma benthamii]]'', ''[[Erytroxylum]]'' sp., and ''[[Cereus hexagonus]]''. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 ==Animals== 
 [[Mammals|Fur animals]] live in the Llanos.  For example, there are [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), [[giant anteater]]s (''Myrmecophaga tridactyla''), [[capybara]]s (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris''), [[giant armadillo]]s (''Priodontes maximus''), [[Eastern cottontail|eastern cottontail rabbits]] (''Sylvilagus floridanus''), [[Alston's cotton rat]]s (''Sigmodon alstoni''), [[Hispid cotton rat]]s (''S. hispidus''), ''[[Zygodontomys brevicauda]]'', and ''[[Oecomys bicolor]]''. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 Many animals live in the gallery forests that grow next to the rivers.  For example, there are the [[collared peccary]] (''Tayassu tajacu''), [[white-lipped peccary]] (''T. pecari''), [[South American tapir]] (''Tapirus terrestris''), white-tailed deer,  [[red brocket]] (''Mazama americana''), [[wedge-capped capuchin]] (''Cebus olivaceus''), [[Venezuelan red howler]] (''Alouatta seniculus''), large rodents like the [[lowland paca]] (''Cuniculus paca''), [[agouti]]s (''[[Dasyprocta]]'' spp.), and [[Brazilian porcupine]] (''Coendou prehensilis''), and large cats like the [[cougar|puma]] (''Puma concolor''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), and [[ocelot]] (''Leopardus pardalis''). The endangered [[giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'') lives along the Orinoco River and its [[tributary|small rivers]]. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 Some of the [[South American jaguar#Characteristics|largest jaguars]] in the world live in the Llanos. The male jaguar can weigh over {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{cite journal |author1=Jedrzejewski, W. |author2=Abarca, M. R. |author3=Viloria, Á. |author4=Cerda, H. |author5=Lew, D. |author6=Takiff, H. |author7=Abadia, E. |author8=Velozo, P. |title=Jaguar conservation in Venezuela against the backdrop of current knowledge on its biology and evolution |publisher=Interciencia |format=pdf |volume=36 |issue=12 |pages=954–966 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220033215 |year=2011 |access-date=2019-07-12}} < /ref > 
 
 The [[Llanos long-nosed armadillo]] (''Dasypus sabanicola'') and the short-tailed opossum ''[[Monodelphis orinoci]]'' [[endemism|live in]] the Llanos. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 The Llanos' wetlands have about 70 species of [[water bird]]s, for example the [[scarlet ibis]]. < ref name= " Llanos wetlands during the rainy season " / >  Many [[sharp-tailed ibis]] (''Cerbibis oxycerca'') and [[white-bearded flycatcher]] (''Phelpsia inornata'') also live in the Llanos. 
 
 There are reptiles in the Llanos: the [[Orinoco crocodile]] (''Crocodylus intermedius''), [[spectacled caiman]] (''Caiman crocodilus''), [[Green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), and [[Arrau turtle]] (''Podocnemis expansa'') live in the flooded places.

 ==Indigenous peoples== 
 [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous human beings]] who live in the Llanos include the [[Guahibo people]] in the western Llanos in Colombia and Venezuela, and the [[Yaruro people]] in the eastern Llanos in Venezuela. 
 
 ==Cow raising and farming== 
 Starting with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish takeover]], people have brought millions of cows to the Llanos. An 1856 [[watercolor]] painting by [[Manuel María Paz]] shows cows eating grass between the palm trees. < ref > {{Cite web |last=Paz |first=Manuel María |author-link=Manuel María Paz |title=General View of The Plains, Province of Casanare |work=World Digital Library |access-date=2014-05-21 |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9027}} < /ref >  The word ''[[llanero]]'' ( " plainsman " ) became the name for the cowhands who took care of the herds. They are like the [[gaucho]]s of the [[Pampas]] or the ''[[Cowboy|vaqueros]]'' of [[Spanish Texas|Spanish]] and [[Mexican Texas]]. 
 
 People raised so many cows on the Llanos that the grasslands changed.  Human beings set fire to the grasslands to kill trees and shrubs and grow better grass for the cows.  Human beings [[introduced species|brought new grasses]] from other parts of the Earth because they thought they would be better for the cows to eat.  For example, they brought the African grass ''[[Melinis minutiflora]]''.  Now, large parts of the Llanos are govered in African grass. < ref name = wwf/ > 
 
 Much of the Llanos now has farms on it, for example rice and corn farms.  Some of the rice fields are in the parts of the Llanos that flood. 
 
 ==Oil and gas== 
 People look for oil and [[natural gas]] in Arauca, Casanare, Guárico, Anzoátegui, Apure, and Monagas. The [[Orinoco Belt]], which is in Venezuela, has a lot of [[heavy crude]]oil in [[oil sands]]. The Orinoco belt oil sands are one of the largest in the world, after the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] in [[Alberta]], Canada. All of the non-conventional oil in Venezuela put together {{convert|1200|Goilbbl|m3}}, most of which is the Orinoco, is about as much as all the convetional oil in the rest of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} 
 
 ==Protected areas== 
 In 2017, scientists said that 105,323 & nbsp;km², or 28%, of the Llanos, is in protected areas, meaning places where the government says no one may harm the plants or animals. < ref name= " dinerstein " > Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al.
