 A '''perennial''' is a plant that bears [[leaf|leaves]] and perhaps [[flower]]s every year.   
 
 Some plants only bear leaves and flowers once, then they die. Such plants are called ''annual''. 
 
 Other plants live for two years. They are called ''biennial''. 
 
 Most [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s are perennial plants.
