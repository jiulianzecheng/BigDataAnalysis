 The '''Acarina''', or '''Acari''', are the '''mites''' and '''ticks'''. They are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[Arachnid]]s. 
 
 Their fossil history goes back to the [[Devonian]] era. Most acarines are tiny: less than a [[millimetre]]. It is estimated that over 50,000 species have been described, but a million or more species may be currently living. The study of mites and ticks is called [[acarology]]. < ref name= " WalProc " > Walter D.E. Proctor H.C. 1999. Mites: ecology, evolution and behaviour.

 Acarines live in practically every [[Ecoregion|habitat]], and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other [[arthropod]]s in the soil and [[detritus]]. Many are [[parasitism|parasitic]], and they affect both [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally [[predator]]s and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others help to break down forest [[litter]] and dead organic matter such as [[skin]] cells. Others still are [[herbivorous]] and may damage [[crops]]. Damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives, earth mites, thread-footed mites and the gall and rust mites. 
 
 Some parasitic forms affect [[humans]] and other [[mammal]]s, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be [[Vector (biology)|vectors]] of diseases such as [[scrub typhus]] and [[rickettsia]]. A well-known effect of mites on humans is as an [[allergen]] which stimulates [[asthma]]. Predatory mites may be used in [[pest control]] and herbivorous mites used to attack [[weed]]s. A positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in [[ecosystem]]s, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem. < ref name= " WalProc " / > 
 
 == Mites ==

 A hugely successful group with a large number of [[species]]. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all the [[invertebrate]] groups, but because of their small size (most are microscopic) go largely unnoticed. They have exploited many [[habitat]]s. Many live freely in the soil or water, but there are also a large number of species that live as parasites on plants, animals, and some that feed on mould (fungi). 
 
 == Ticks == 
 Ticks are [[blood]]-sucking ecto[[parasites]], mostly of [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. They wait on grass or bushes, and jump onto passing animals. A number of birds specialise in picking them off larger animals: the [[Cattle Egret]] and the [[Oxpecker]] for example. They are quite serious pests, and can be hard to get rid of. They are vectors, carrying diseases such as [[Lyme disease]].
