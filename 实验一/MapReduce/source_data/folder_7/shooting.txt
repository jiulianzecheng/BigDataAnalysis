 '''Shooting''' is when a [[rifle]], [[shotgun]] or other weapons which fire a [[projectile]], such as [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]s or [[crossbow]]s, are fired. Even the firing of [[artillery]], [[rocket]]s and [[missile]]s can be called shooting. A person who is very good at shooting is a [[marksman]]. Shooting can take place in a [[shooting range]] or in the field in [[hunting]], in [[shooting sports]] or in [[combat]]. Shooting is also an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. 
 
 == Uses == 
 Shooting is used for [[hunting]] birds such as [[grouse]] or [[Common Pheasant|pheasant]], [[rabbiting|rabbits]] etc. Sometimes  " shooting "  just means  " hunting " . 
 
 ==Violence== 
 Shooting is also used in [[War|warfare]], [[Self-defence|self-defense]], [[crime]], and [[law enforcement]]. When someone shoots random innocent people it is sometimes caused by [[misanthropy]] (hate for humans). 
 
 ==Competitive shooting== 
 In several countries, rifle clubs have been made since the 19th century. Soon, international shooting events were started, including [[shooting at the Summer Olympics]] (from 1896) and [[ISSF World Shooting Championships|World Championships]] (from 1897). The [[International Shooting Sport Federation]] is in charge of Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol and shotgun competitions. However, there are also many national and international shooting sports which other organisations are in charge of. 
 
 ==Shooting supplies== 
 In most countries, people who want to shoot firearms need a [[license]]. Firearms can usually only be bought from registered shops.
