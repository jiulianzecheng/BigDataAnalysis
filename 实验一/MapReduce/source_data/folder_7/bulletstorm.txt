 '''''Bulletstorm''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] made by [[People Can Fly]] and [[Epic Games]] for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. 
 
 The game came under negative criticism by [[Fox News]] for it's use of profanity, crude behavior and sexual [[innuendo]]. Electronic Arts responded to this saying,  " As you know, Bulletstorm is a work of entertainment fiction... The game and its marketing adhere to all guidelines set forth by the ESRB; both designed for people 17+...Much like Tarantino's Kill Bill or Rodriguez's Sin City, this game is an expression of creative entertainment for adults.
