 '''Finntroll''' is a [[folk metal]] band from [[Finland]]. They mix elements of [[extreme metal]] with Finnish [[polka]], called ''[[humppa]]''. Finntroll's lyrics are in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], one of Finland's two national languages, because they say  " Swedish just sounds damn trollish " . Finntroll means  " Troll from Finland "  or  " a spotty troll " . 
 
 ==History== 
 Finntroll was founded in [[1997]], by [[Teemus Raimoranta]]. One year later they recorded their first demo, ''[[Rivfader]]''. After the demo [[Samu Ruotsalainen]] (drums),[[Samuli Ponsimaa]] (guitar), [[Henri Sorvali]] (keyboard) and [[Sami Uusitalo]] joined the band. The [[record company]] [[Spinefarm]] got interested in the band and then their first album ''[[Midnattens Widunder]]'' was recorded.

 In 2001 the album ''[[Jaktens Tid]]'' (English: ''The time of the Hunt'') was released. As they became more and more popular, [[Century Media]] started to [[promoting|promote]] Finntroll. That summer Finntroll played their first [[open air festivals]] in [[Finland]]. The year after the release of the album ''Jaktens Tid'' the band could not go on [[tour]], because their singer had a [[tumor]] in his [[vocal cords]]. That is why he stopped singing in the band after the album ''[[Visor om Slutet]]'' (English: ''Songs about the End''). This album was recorded in January [[2003]], in a forest [[cabin]] near [[Helsinki]]. Shortly before the release of ''Visor om Slutet'' Raimoranta died, because he fell off a bridge in Helsinki. He had drunk too much [[alcohol]]. Finntroll went on tour to [[Europe]] anyway, together with the band [[Katatonia]]. The guitarist Mikael Karlbom [[replacement|replaced]] Raimoranta. In [[2004]], the band released an [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Trollhammaren]]'' (English: ''The Troll Hammer''), and an album called ''[[Nattfödd]]'' (English: ''Nightborn''). 
 
 On January 29th, 2006, Tapio Wilska, vocalist of the band since 2003, left the band. 
 
 A new album, called [[Ur Jordens Djup]] (English: ''From the Depths of the Earth''), was released [[March]], [[2007]]. This album had more epic keyboard [[riffs]] to make it sound more like polka.
