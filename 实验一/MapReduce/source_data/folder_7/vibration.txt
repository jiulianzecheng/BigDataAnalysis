'''Vibration''' means quickly moving back and forth (or up and down) about a point of [[equilibrium]]. < ref > Tongue, Benson 2001. ''Principles of vibration''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-195-142462}} < /ref >  The vibration may be periodic (having a pattern) or [[random]]. Something that is vibrating may shake at the same time.  If it vibrates in a regular way, it may produce a [[music]]al [[note (music)|note]] because it can make the [[air]] vibrate. This vibration will send [[sound]] [[wave (physics)|waves]] to the [[ear]] and to the [[brain]]. 
 
 In [[structural engineering]] including [[earthquake engineering]], vibrations may be bad. They may cause the structure to [[failure|fail]]. 
 
 The time it takes a vibrating object to go back and forth completely is the period. The number of back-and-forth movements in one second is its frequency, measured in [[Hertz]] (Hz). The farthest possible distance from the equilibrium point is the [[amplitude]]. 
 
 == Types of vibration == 
 '''Free vibration''' occurs when vibration is set off with a push and allowed to vibrate freely.  Examples of this type of vibration are pulling a child back on a swing and then letting go or hitting a tuning fork and letting it ring. The mechanical system will then vibrate at a '[[Natural frequency]]' and gradually wind down. 
 
 '''Forced  vibration''' is when an alternating force or motion is applied to a mechanical system.  Examples of this type of vibration include  
 *a shaking washing machine due to an imbalance.  
 *transportation vibration (caused by a combination of truck engine, springs, road).  
 *vibration of a building during an [[earthquake]].   
 In forced vibration the frequency of the vibration is the frequency of the force or motion applied. The size of the effect depends on the actual mechanical system.
