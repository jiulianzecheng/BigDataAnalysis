 In [[51 BC]], [[Cicero]] published his work ''[[De re publica]]'' (''On the Republic''). < ref name= " HopwoodUNE " > {{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/4928820 |title=The Art of Roman Government; What was Cicero's Ideal of the Perfect Statesman? How Did Both Caesar and Pompey Measured Up To It? |author=Bronwyn Hopwood |website= |publisher=University of New England, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, School of Humanities |accessdate=25 October 2016}} < /ref >  The [[dialog]] was about what made a true statesman. < ref name=HopwoodUNE/ >  It was about the [[virtue]]s and [[wikt:ideals|ideals]] such a leader must have. < ref name=HopwoodUNE/ >  Cicero wrote that a great statesman did not have to descend from [[aristocrat]]s. But he must have ''virtus'' ([[virtue]]), ''[[iustitia]]'' (a sense of [[justice]]) and wisdom. < ref name=HopwoodUNE/ >  He must also have ''[[dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' (roughly translated as [[dignity]]), [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and must show [[generosity]] and be [[Magnanimity|magnanimous]]. < ref name=HopwoodUNE/ > 
 
 A statesman has certain core values and will not change beliefs simply to advance a [[political]] [[career]]. < ref name=KilhefnerHC/ >  If a change in [[wikt:policy|policy]] is necessary for the good of the people he or she serves, the change will be made no matter how much it is [[wikt:criticize|criticize]]d. < ref name=KilhefnerHC/ >  According to Hans J. Morgenthau, author of ''Politics Among Nations'', statesmen see things realistically; as they really are. < ref name=KilhefnerHC/ >  They look at how a policy will affect a nation. < ref name=KilhefnerHC/ >  A statesman is not the same as a monarch or king because their goals are not the same. < ref name= " Danoff2 " > Brian Danoff, Louie Joseph Hebert, ''Alexis de Tocqueville and the Art of Democratic Statesmanship'' (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2011), p. 2 < /ref >  A statesman does not want to dominate or control people, he or she wants to educate them so they are fit to live in a democracy. < ref name=Danoff2/ >  Like [[Plato]] before him, [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] believed that a statesman not only educated his or her people, he somehow shaped their character. < ref name=Danoff2/ > 
 
 When [[Abraham Lincoln]] became [[President of the United States]] in 1861, most people saw an awkward, rumpled [[Yokel|country bumpkin]]. < ref name= " BudianskyWP " > {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lincoln-in-the-world-the-making-of-a-statesman-and-the-dawn-of-american-power-by-kevin-peraino/2013/12/27/549b18e8-5e85-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html?utm_term=.8a22ca16049f |title='Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power,' by Kevin Peraino |author=Stephen Budiansky |date=27 December 2013 |website= |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=23 October 2016}} < /ref >  He had never traveled to [[Europe]] and was seen by the American people and foreign dignitaries alike as [[wikt:crude|crude]] and un[[wikt:sophisticated|sophisticated]]. < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  The [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] minister reported of Lincoln: “He and his wife seem like . . . western farmers, and even in this country, where one has no right to be [[wikt:fastidious|fastidious]], their common manners and their ways expose them in unfortunate fashion to ridicule.” < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  While many do not remember Lincoln as a great [[foreign policy|foreign-policy]] president, he actually was. < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  Like a true statesman, Lincoln [[wikt:adept|adept]]ly guided foreign policy at a time of great [[wikt:peril|peril]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when the United States was [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] to foreign [[wikt:intervention|intervention]]. < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  According to [[Kevin Peraino]], Lincoln  " should be considered one of America’s seminal foreign-policy presidents — a worthy model for students of global affairs. " < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  Historians have long shown Lincoln to have been a great statesman who worked tirelessly to build his country into something greater than it was. < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >  He laid the groundwork for America's later rise to become a world power. < ref name=BudianskyWP/ >
