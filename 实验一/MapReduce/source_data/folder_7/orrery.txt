 An '''orrery''' is a mechanical [[model]] of the [[Solar System]]. It shows the relative positions and motions of the [[planet]]s and [[natural satellite|moon]]s. It is usually a [[heliocentric]] model. < ref > King, Henry C.  &  Millburn, John R. 1978. ''Geared to the stars : the evolution of planetariums, orreries, and astronomical clocks''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 28–41. {{ISBN|0-8020-2312-6}} < /ref > 
 
 The Greeks had working [[planetaria]]. The first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704. < ref > Calvert, H.R. 1967. ''Astronomy: globes, orreries and other models''. London: H.M.S.O. < /ref >   One was presented to [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery]] – hence the name. They are usually driven by a [[clockwork]] mechanism. The globe in the centre represents the Sun, and a planet is at the end of each arm. 
 
 The first known orrery was the  [[Antikythera mechanism]], variously dated from 60 to 150 [[BC]].
