 '''Ghazni''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Pashto language|Pashto]]: غزنی - ''Ġaznī''; historically known as غزنین / ''Ġaznīn'' and غزنه / ''Ġazna'') is a city in central-east [[Afghanistan]]. It is the capital of [[Ghazni Province]]. 
 
 Just like other cities of Afghanistan, Ghazni is very old and has seen many military invasions.

 Ghazni City is located in an area of extreme drought. In 2007, one of the gates on a fifty-year-old dam on the [[Jikhai River]] broke.  This worried the people of Ghazni city about the water supply. The dam serves as a good source of irrigation water to Ghazni City and the surrounding agricultural areas. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=372763 & category=Services & Country=AFGHANISTAN|title=Ghazni's Zanakhan Dam damaged|accessdate=2007-07-15|archive-date=2007-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215508/http://southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=372763 & category=Services & Country=AFGHANISTAN|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2007/march/mar172007.html#19 Heavy water flow damages Ghazni's Zanakhan Dam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220100217/http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2007/march/mar172007.html#19 |date=2012-02-20 }} Mar 15 2007, Pajhwok Afghan News < /ref >  Nearby rivers have a history of flooding  and causing severe damage and death, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.pakistantimes.net/2005/03/30/top9.htm|title=Jikhai River Dam burst swamps Ghazni city of Afghanistan|publisher=Pakistan Times|accessdate=2007-07-15|archive-date=2005-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104022706/http://www.pakistantimes.net/2005/03/30/top9.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  though efforts have begun to fix this. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/ghazni.htm|title=Ghazni|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2007-07-15}} < /ref >
