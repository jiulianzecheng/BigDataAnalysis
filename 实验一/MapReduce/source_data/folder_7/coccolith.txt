 '''Coccoliths''' are the [[microscope|microscopic]] [[algae]] which form [[chalk]]. They are made by one of the most important [[eukaryote]] phyto[[plankton]]. These are single celled [[protist]]s whose full name is '''coccolithophorids''' or '''coccolithophores'''. The spherical [[skeleton]] of coccoliths is a ''coccosphere''. 
 
 Chalk makes up much of the [[Ocean|marine]] [[strata]] in the [[Upper Cretaceous]] period, and is 95% to 99% made up of coccoliths, the [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO < sub > 3 < /sub > ) plates which coccolithophorids produce. 
 
 Coccoliths were first examined by [[Cristian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] (1795–1875), who thought they were [[inorganic matter|inorganic]] products. They were named, and identified as made by living organisms by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. He realised they were a major part of the rock we call [[chalk]]. < ref > Huxley T.H. 1868. On a piece of chalk. ''British Association for the Advancement of Science''. < /ref >  The story of how the tiny cell produces its coccosphere is told by Westbroek: 
 : " The tiny coccolith-generating alga... is geological dynamite, a formidable force helping to conduct vast fluxes of calcium and carbonate towards the ocean bottom " . < ref name=Westbroek > Westbroek, Peter 1991. ''Life as a geological force''. Norton N.Y. Chapter 6 The power of the small. p141 < /ref > 
 
 Coccolithophores are a major contributor to the carbonate in deep sea [[sediment]]s. In the Northeast [[Atlantic]] during the last glacial-interglacial cycle ([[ice age]]), coccoliths make up 70-80% of the total carbonate during the warm periods, and less during glacial times. < ref > van Kreveld S.A. ''et al'' 1996. Biogenic carbonate and ice-rafted debris (Heinrich layer) accumulation in deep-sea sediments from the Northeast Atlantic piston core. ''Marine Geology'', 131. < /ref > < ref > Lototoskaya A and Ziveri P 1995. Calcareous nanoplankton response to Termination II and Heinrich event (140-110 Ka BP) in the NE Atlantic. ''6th International Nannoplankton Conference'', Coopenaghen: 72–73. < /ref > 
 
 Coccoliths are first seen at the end of the [[Triassic]] period, 200 million years ago. It is interesting that another group of tiny algae, the [[diatom]]s, make their entry into the [[fossil]] record at almost the same time. The coccolith all-time peak was in the warm inland and continental shelf seas of the [[Cretaceous]] period. They are still of huge [[ecology|ecological]] and geological importance. < ref name=Westbroek/ >

 ''Emiliania huxleyi'' (''Ehux'' for short) is one of the most important planktonic algae on the planet today. < ref > Green J.C. Course P.A;  &  Tarran G.A. 1996. The life-cycle of ''Emiliania huxleyi'': a brief review and a study of relative ploidy levels using flow cytometry. ''J. Marine Syst''. '''9''': 33–44. < /ref >  It is the most common coccolithophore in the oceans of the world. It dominates in the northeast [[Atlantic]], in the northeast [[Pacific]] and in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. Its gigantic [[algal bloom]]s are easily seen on satellite imagery. This blooming life-style started between ~80,000 and 50,000 years ago, and marks the start of the so-called ''Ehux Acme zone'' in the fossil record. 
 
 Ehux is only seen in relatively young sediments, and must have evolved fairly recently. The first appearance of Ehux in the sediment is used as a [[stratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] marker. < ref > [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/soes/staff/tt/eh/geology.html Geological context of ''Emiliania huxleyi''. Ziveri, Patrizia 1996/7] < /ref >  This appearance was dated to ~270,000 years ago. < ref > Gartner S and Emiliani C 1976. Nannofossil biostratigraphy and climatic stages of the Brunhes Epoch. ''AAPG Bull''. '''60''': 1562-1564.
