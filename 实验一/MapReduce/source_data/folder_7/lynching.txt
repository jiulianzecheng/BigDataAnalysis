What makes the execution a lynching is the nature of it being done without a court trial by people who believe the accused is guilty of a crime. Lynchings have been used in the southern states of the [[United States of America]] against [[African American]]s during the time of slavery but more commonly after the [[abolition of slavery]] during the time of [[Civil rights in the United States of America|civil rights activism]] and the times of the various [[Ku Klux Klan]]s. Lynching continues to be a problem to this day, and is not just limited to southern states. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.channel3000.com/a-community-seeks-answers-after-a-young-black-man-is-found-hanging-from-a-tree-in-los-angeles-county/|title=A community seeks answers after a young black man is found hanging from a tree in Los Angeles County|date=2020-06-13|website=Channel3000.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-13}} < /ref >  Lynching is murder, and many times the people who do it are never punished.

 Most lynchings went down by the 1950s. 
 
 Most lynchings were of [[African American people|African American]] men in the [[Southern United States|South]]. But women were also lynched. Also, white lynchings of blacks happened in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and Border States. Sometimes whites were also lynched.
