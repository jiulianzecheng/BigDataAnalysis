 A '''child''' (the [[plural]] is '''children''') is a person below the age of [[puberty]] (biologically) or below the [[age of majority]] (legally). A person can be called his or her parent's child, no matter how old he or she is. Another word for  " child "  is  " kid " . 
 
 In most countries, children go to [[school]]. Small children may go to [[nursery]] school, [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]]. [[Play (activity)|Playing]] with small [[toy]]s and using their imaginations are important for [[child development]]. But often in a [[developing country]], children sometimes [[child labour|work]] in factories or in the fields with their [[parents]] or guardians. 
 
 When two people get [[marriage|married]] and one (or both) of them have children with someone else before this [[marriage]], that child is called a ''step child'' by the child's non-[[birth]] [[parent]]. If both people had children, the children of each parent are ''step brothers'' or ''step sisters'' of each other. A child whose parents have died is an [[orphan]]. Orphans with no parent may be raised by grandparents or other relatives. Otherwise they may go to live in an [[orphanage]]. They may be [[Adoption|adopted]] by another adult or couple wanting a child. They will then be able to grow up in a new [[family]].
