 A '''Mantis''' ([[Order (biology)|order]] Mantodea) is a type of [[insect]]. They are usually known as '''praying mantids''' because of their prayer-like stance. 
 
 The group contains about 2,300 species. They occur in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[habitat]]s. Most are in are in the family Mantidae, and are called '''Mantids'''. 
 
 In Europe, the name  " praying mantis "  refers to only a single species, ''Mantis religiosa''. They are sometimes confused with phasmids ([[stick insect]]s). 
 
 The closest relatives of mantids are the order Blattodea ([[cockroach]]es and [[termite]]s), and these two groups together are ranked as the Superorder [[Dictyoptera]]. < ref > Carde, Ring T. and Resh, Vincent H.

 Mantids are notable for their hunting abilities. They are [[predator]]s, and their [[diet]] usually consists of living insects, including [[fly|flies]] and [[aphid]]s. Larger species have been known to prey on small [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[bird]]s, < ref name= " NYTBrain " > {{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/science/praying-mantis-eating-birds.html?action=click & module=RelatedLinks & pgtype=Article|date=September 22, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2020|title=Birds Beware: The Praying Mantis Wants Your Brain|author=Natalie Angier}} < /ref >  [[snake]]s, and even [[rodent]]s. 
 
 Most mantids are [[ambush]] predators, waiting for prey to stray too near. The mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed. Some ground and bark species, however, pursue their prey rather quickly. 
 
 Prey are caught and held securely with grasping, spiked forelegs ('[[raptor]]ial' legs); the first thoracic segment, the [[prothorax]], is commonly elongated and flexibly articulated, allowing for greater range of movement of the front limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less still. 
 
 The movement of the head is also remarkably flexible. It gives nearly 300 degrees of movement in some species. This allows for a great range of vision (their [[compound eye]]s have a large [[binocular vision|binocular field of vision]]) without having to move the rest of the body. As their hunting relies heavily on vision, they are mainly [[diurnal]], but many species fly at night, when there is less chance of being taken by birds. 
 
 Mantids are masters of [[camouflage]] and most species make use of protective colouration to blend in with the [[leaf|foliage]] or [[substrate]]. This helps to avoid [[predator]]s themselves, and to better snare their victims. < ref > Hall, Derek 2005. ''Encyclopedia of insects  &  spiders''. Grange Books. {{ISBN|1-84013-793-2}} < /ref >  They not only blend with the foliage, but mimic it, appearing as either living or withered leaves, sticks, tree bark, blades of grass, flowers, or even stones. Some species in [[Africa]] and [[Australia]] are able to turn black after a molt following a fire in the region to blend in with the fire ravaged landscape (fire [[melanism]]). 
 
 Mantids bite, but have no [[venom]], and are not dangerous to humans. They are not chemically protected; nearly any large [[predator]]y animal will eat a mantis if it is able to detect it. Mantids are generally quite aggressive towards one another, in fact, and most species are readily [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] when given the opportunity.
