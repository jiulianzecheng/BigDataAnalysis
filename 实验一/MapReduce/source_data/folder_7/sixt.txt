 Martin Sixt started the company in 1912 with just three cars. This was the first car rental company in [[Bavaria]]. During [[World War I]], the German Army took the cars. After the war, the company started again, but the German Army took the cars again in [[World War II]]. After that war, the company began to grow again, providing taxi services for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in Germany. They also started a taxi business in Munich, which was the first to use radios. In 1951, they created the car rental company called Auto Sixt. 
 
 In 2020, Sixt sold all its part in Sixt Leasing SE to focus more on its car services. In June 2020, it bought 10 locations at U.S. airports from Advantage Rent a Car, making it have over 85 places in the U.S. In July 2020, Lyft and Sixt started working together, letting Lyft app users rent cars from both companies through the app. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-02-21|title=Sixt verkauft Leasing-Tochter an Hyundai-Bank|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/autovermietung-sixt-verkauft-leasing-tochter-an-hyundai-bank/25571994.html?ticket=ST-3991896-BNhsySM4kMaCO44bxzit-ap3|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-03-30|website=[[Handelsblatt]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|last=Korosec|first=Kirsten|date=2020-07-30|title=Lyft expands its rental business with Sixt partnership|url=https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/lyft-expands-its-rental-business-with-sixt-partnership/?guccounter=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-03-30|website=[[TechCrunch]]}} < /ref >
