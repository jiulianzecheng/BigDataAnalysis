 '''Bacchus''' was the Roman god of [[agriculture]], [[wine]] and fertility, equivalent to the Greek god [[Dionysus]]. He is often seen with vines of grapes with him. Dionysus was said to be the last god to join the twelve Olympians. Supposedly, [[Hestia]] gave up her seat for him. His plants were [[vines]] and twirling [[ivy]]. He carried a pine cone-topped staff, and his followers were goat-footed [[Satyrs]] and Maenads, wild women who danced energetically during his festivals. Bacchus is the son of Jupiter. 
 
 == Mythical history == 
 Bacchus was the child of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Semélé, a human whom [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] had tricked into asking to see Jupiter as he really was. Since she was a mortal, she was burned up by the sight of Jupiter in his divine form. So Jupiter sewed the infant Bacchus into his thigh, and gave birth to him nine months later. As a child, Bacchus was tutored by Silenus, who was a great lover of wine and often had to be carried on the back of a donkey. Before he took his place at Olympus, Bacchus wandered the world for many years, going as far as India to teach people how to grow wines.
