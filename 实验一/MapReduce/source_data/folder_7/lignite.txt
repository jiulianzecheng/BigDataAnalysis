 '''Lignite''', often called '''brown coal''', is a soft [[sedimentary rock]]. It is brown in color and [[Combustion|combustible]]. The rock is created from naturally [[wikt:compression|compressed]] [[peat]]. It has a [[carbon]] content around 25–35%. < ref name= " brit "  / >  It is thought to be the [[Coal rank|lowest rank]] of [[coal]]. This is because of its low [[Heat of combustion|heat content]]. Lignite has a  high [[amount]] of [[moisture]] when it is taken from the ground. This can explain its low carbon content. The rock is [[Mining|mined]] all around the world. It is mostly used as a [[fuel]] for [[steam-electric power generation]]. 
 
 The [[combustion]] of lignite makes less heat for the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur]] that come out than other types of coal. Because of this, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]] have said that lignite is the worst coal for human [[health]]. Many different [[Toxic heavy metal|toxic heavy metals]] can also be in lignite. These are left over in the [[coal fly ash]] made from its combustion. This causes more health [[wikt:risk|risks]].

 {{See also|Jet (lignite)}} 
 Most lignite is used to [[Electricity generation|make electricity]]. It is also used in [[agriculture]], in [[industry]], and, as '''jet''', in [[jewelry]].
