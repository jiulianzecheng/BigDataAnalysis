'''Neutralization''' occurs when a [[base (chemistry)|base]] is reacted with an [[acid]]. The OH < sup > - < /sup >  [[ion]]s in the base react with the H < sup > + < /sup >  ions in the acid to form H < sub > 2 < /sub > O, water. In this reaction, the base is [[protonation|protonated]] and the acid is (deprotonation|deprotonated). To neutralise a substance (e.g alkali substance), you must put an equal amount of an acid into the alkali in order for it to become neutral(also known as pH 7). [[Titration]] uses neutralization to measure chemical concentrations.
