{{War}} 
 Historically, '''cavalry''' have been [[soldier]]s who fought while [[equestrianism|riding horses]]. In modern times,  " cavalry "  means the branch of the military that fight in armored vehicles such as [[tank]] < nowiki/ > s. They differ from the [[infantry]] in that the Infantry fight on foot. 
 
 Soldiers have fought on horses ever since people have ridden horses. Before that, they fought in [[chariot]] < nowiki/ > s pulled by horses. Because horses are strong, cavalry troops can wear more armor than infantry and carry heavier weapons. Because horses are fast, cavalry can ride into battle more quickly than infantry.
