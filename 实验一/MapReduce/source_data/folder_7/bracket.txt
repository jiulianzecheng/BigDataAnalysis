 [[File:Brackets.svg|thumb|100px|The different types of brackets. From top to bottom: square brackets, braces, parentheses, chevrons, and inequality signs.]] 
 
 '''Brackets''' are tall [[punctuation]] marks used in matched pairs within [[text]]. They are used in [[Mathematical notation|mathematics]] and in [[literature]] (written language). They are sometimes used to set apart or interject other parts of the text. They are noted as left/right: the ''left bracket'' is  " [ "  and the ''right bracket'' is  " ] " . 
 
 In the [[American English]],  " bracket "  usually refers specifically to the  " square "  or  " box "  type. < ref > [http://foldoc.org/index.cgi?query=bracket & action=Search Free Online Dictionary of Computing]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref >  In [[British English]],  " bracket "  normally refers to the  " round "  type, which is called a  " parenthesis "  mark in American usage. 
 
 Parentheses are the curved brackets  " ( & nbsp; & nbsp;) " . They are also called ''round brackets'', ''curved brackets'', ''oval brackets'', or, colloquially, ''parens''. 
 
 Parentheses have several different meanings, such as: 
 * noting optional text: & nbsp;  " (this is optional) " ; 
 * showing other [[word]] endings: & nbsp;  " vote(s) "  or  " quick(ly) " 
 * adjusting the meaning: & nbsp;  " There are some (many) pages " . 
 * adding humor: & nbsp;  " They sell pre-owned (read:  " used " ) cars " . 
 * indicating a [[negative number]]: & nbsp; $90 - $100 = ($10) 
 * grouping terms in a calculation: & nbsp; 6 x (2 + 3) = 30. 
 * showing emphasis for attention: & nbsp;  " (((wow))) " . 
 There are also other uses for parentheses. 
 
 Parentheses enclose text which could be left out, without destroying or altering the meaning of a sentence. In most writing, overuse of parentheses is usually a sign of a badly structured [[text]]. A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas around the text, although if the sentence contains commas for other uses, then visual confusion may result. 
 
 Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add more information, such as in: 
 :  " Sen. John McCain (R., Arizona) spoke at length " 
 They can also note  " either singular or plural "  for [[noun]]s, such as in the word  " claim(s) " . 
 
 In mathematics, various brackets are used for various purposes.
