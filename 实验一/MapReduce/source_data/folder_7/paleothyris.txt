 '''''Paleothyris''''' was a small, agile, [[anapsid]] [[reptile]] which lived in the [[Pennsylvanian]] epoch in [[Nova Scotia]] (about 312 to 304 million years ago).  
 
 ''Paleothyris'' had sharp teeth and large [[eye]]s: it was a [[nocturnal]] hunter. It was about a foot long. It probably fed on [[insect]]s and other smaller animals found on the floor of its [[forest]] home.  
 
 ''Paleothyris'' was an early [[sauropsid]], yet it still had some features that were more [[labyrinthodont]]-like than [[reptile]]-like. Its skull lacked [[Skull#Temporal_fenestrae|fenestrae]], holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals.
