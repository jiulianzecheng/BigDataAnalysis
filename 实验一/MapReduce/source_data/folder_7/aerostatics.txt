'''Aerostatics''' is the [[Research|study]] of [[gases]] that are not in [[motion]]. The study of gases in motion is called [[aerodynamics]]. It is a part of [[fluid statics]]. 
 
 An [[aerostat]] is a [[lighter than air]] craft, such as an [[airship]] or [[balloon]], which uses the principles of aerostatics to [[buoyancy|float]].
