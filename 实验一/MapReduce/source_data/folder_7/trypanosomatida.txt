The '''Trypanosomatida''' are a group of [[unicellular]] [[kinetoplastid]]s. They have a single [[flagellum]], and often live as [[parasite]]s. Many trypanosomatids only live in [[insect]]s. Some change hosts: one form lives in insects, the other lives inside a [[plant]] or an [[animal]]. ''[[Leishmania]]'' is a common example.
