 '''Wicca''' is a [[Paganism|neo-pagan]] (meaning  " new [[paganism|pagan]] " ) [[religion]] that was created by a [[British]] man named Gerald Gardner in the mid-to-late 1940s. Gardner popularized the new religion through books of his that were printed in 1949, 1954, and 1959. Those three books are ''High Magic's Aid'', ''Witchcraft Today'', and ''The Meaning of Witchcraft''. Gardner called Wicca the  " [[witch]] cult "  and  " witchcraft " , and called its followers the  " Wica "  (or  " Wicca " ). In his 1959 book he also called them the  " Wicca "  (with two 'c's), which is where that word came from. < ref name= " WitchcraftToday " > {{cite book |last= Gardner |first=Gerald B |authorlink=Gerald Gardner |title=Witchcraft Today |publisher= Mercury Publishing |location=Lake Toxaway, NC |year=1999 |origyear=1954 |oclc= 44936549}} < /ref >  The word  " wicca "  means  " witch "  in [[Old English]]. < ref > Seims, Melissa.

Page 3. < /ref > 
 
 Wicca is now used as an umbrella term for many different paths that have branched off from Gardner's original practices. 
 
 ==Origin== 
 Some time from 1945 to 1949, Gerald Gardner changed, and added content to, the rituals of an earlier group, called the New Forest Coven. In so doing, Gerald Gardner created Wicca. The many elements from the grimoire (old hand-written book) called the ''Key of Solomon'' are present in Wicca. Those are also in Gardner's 1949 book, ''High Magic's Aid'', and were most likely added by Gardner himself, rather than by the New Forest Coven that came before him. 
 
 The New Forest Coven was created in the city of [[Christchurch]], [[England]] (on the southern coast of England), some time in the 1930s.  It was created by a group of low-ranking members of the [[Ancient Order of the Rosicrucians]] in the Crotona Fellowship.  Members of that group read the books about witches by [[Margaret Murray]] and [[Charles Leland]], which gave them the idea to create a witch coven. 
 
 Some time after Gerald Gardner joined the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship in Christchurch, he was drawn to the group of low-ranking rosicrucians. They initiated him into the New Forest Coven in September 1939, shortly after Gardner had lost all faith in the rosicrucian order's leadership on September 3rd. 
 
 ==Beliefs== 
 There are many different [[tradition]]s of Wicca, yet many are common beliefs that are shared by all Wiccans, such as the [[afterlife]], [[witchcraft|magic]], and [[morality]]. 
 
 ===The God and The Goddess=== 
 Most Wiccans believe in a horned male god, Pan, and a moon goddess, Hecate. The only wiccans who do not believe in both the goddess and the god are those who belong to the unorthodox sect called Dianic Wicca; such wiccans believe in the existence of only the goddess. Some wiccans believe that the god and the goddess are equal. However, some other wiccans believe that the goddess is more important than the god. < ref > Farrar, Janet and Farrar, Stewart. (1987). ''The Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity''. London: Robert Hale. Page 59. < /ref > 
 
 ==Morality== 
 ===The Wiccan Rede=== 
 The main Wiccan moral teaching is called the ''Wiccan Rede''. The word '''rede''' means '' " advice " '' or '' " council " '' in Old German. '' " An ye harm  none, do what ye will " '' is the very basic Wiccan Rede, which means,  " ''Do what you want to do, but do not harm anything in the process''. " < ref name= " ExegesisRede " > {{cite journal |url= http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |title=Exegesis on the ''Rede'' |journal=[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]] |first=Judy |last=Harrow |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1985 |accessdate=2007-02-26}} < /ref >  This is most likely based from Crowley's  " Do what though wilt, shall be the whole of the law " .This means that you must think about how your actions will affect other beings and yourself. 
 
 ===The Rule of Threefold Return=== 
 There is a rule in Wiccan (branched from Pagan belief) that is called  " the rule of threefold return "  or  " the threefold rule "  or  " the rule of three " , or called equivalent names that use the word  " law "  instead of  " rule " . The rule of threefold return is a belief that what you do for good or bad will return to you 3 times the original intent. Therefore, you should only send out or work with good intentions to avoid three-times the bad return as Karma. The rule of threefold return is revealed to second-degree initiates (though they are usually already familiar with it) during the second-degree initiation ritual, in which the initiator scourges the initiate, and then the initiate returns three times the number of scourgings to the initiator. That second-degree initiation ritual, along with the threefold rule within it, were made public by Gerald Gardner's 1949 book ''High Magic's Aid'', in chapter 17. 
 
 In 1986, a wiccan named Raymond Buckland, through his popular wiccan book ''Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft'', created a new definition for the rule of threefold return. In Buckland's definition, the rule of threefold return is not a rule of conduct, but a law of [[karma]], which states that every beneficial action or harmful action that a person does returns to them three times as powerful. Buckland's definition of the threefold rule became more well-known than the original definition of the threefold rule. 
 
 There is a book that wiccans use, in which they read from and use to practice witchcraft with 
 
 ==Practices== 
 ===Altars=== 
 Many Wiccans have special places at home where they perform rituals, magic, and worship. These places are called ''altars''. Originally, there was only one altar that was used by the coven, when the coven was gathered. But as solitary wiccan practice became more popular, wiccans started to use personal altars. 
 
 Wiccans put holy and special objects on their altars, such as the following items: 
 * A [[pentacle]]. A wiccan pentacle is a rigid disk, the size of a small saucer, that has a pentagram on it which spans across the disk. A wiccan pentacle may be made of any of a variety of materials, such as wood, ceramics, or metal. In wiccan rituals, the face of the pentacle is shown to the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west), so as to show the pentacle to the  " lords of the watchtowers " , which are believed to be in those directions. 
 * An athame (pronounced ''ah''-'''thah'''-''may''). This is a magical knife that is used in rituals. An athame traditionally has a black handle, but not every one does. It is never used to cut anything physical, but is used to make a circular 'cut' through the air, to cast the magic circle. In the 'cakes and wine' ritual and the symbolic 'great rite' ritual, the athame is used to symbolize the male penis. 
 * A wand. This is normally wooden, but can also be glass, metal, or clay. It might also have decorations such as crystals, paint, ribbons, or wire. It is traditional for it to be the length from your elbow to your wrist. It is used to direct magical energy. 
 * A chalice. This is a cup that is used in two rituals. People drink from it during the 'cakes and wine' ritual. In the 'cakes and wine' ritual and the symbolic 'great rite' ritual, the chalice is used to symbolize the female vagina. 
 
 Some Wiccans put other objects on their altars, such as statues of gods or goddesses, a bell, candles, incense, and/or a besom (an old-fashioned broom that is made of all-natural materials). A besom is often used to  " sweep "  away negative energy or spirits. 
 
 Those objects that are common on solitary altars are derived from the various objects that are used in the wiccan group rituals. Those ritual objects include a sword (also called a 'magic sword'), a black-handled knife (called an athame), a bowl containing water, a bowl containing salt, an asperger (an object that sprinkles water), candles, a bell, a white-handled knife (which is now usually called a 'bolline', due to being confused with a different object), a wand, a cup (also called a chalice), a pentacle, a censer (a container that burns incense), a scourge (a short whip with several whipping cords), and binding cords. Gerald Gardner, a founder of modern Wicca, started the practice of calling such objects by the misnomer 'tools' or 'working tools', because he was imitating [[Freemasonry]], which used actual tools, such as a trowel. 
 
 ===Wiccan Holidays=== 
 Wiccans have two types of holidays, called ''sabbats'' and ''full moon esbats''. There are eight sabbat holidays throughout the year. As the name suggests, full moon esbats take place during a full moon, so there are twelve or thirteen of them per year. Many post-Gardnerian wiccans use the [[druidry|neo-druidic]] term 'wheel of the year' to refer to the cycle of eight sabbats. 
 
 The eight sabbats are as follows: 
 
 < !-- The following information is kept here, just encase it's ever needed again. The below table is now the only visible informaion on the Sabbats and WOTY -- > 
 
 < !-- * ''[[Samhain]]'', which is celebrated on October 31st. It is the Pagan New Year. It is said that on this day, the barrier between this world and the afterlife is thinnest, and so many Wiccans and Pagans take part in séances or rituals to honour their ancestors. It is pronounced Sow-een by many, though can be pronounced in other ways. 
 
 * ''[[Yule]]'', which is during winter [[solstice]], and can be celebrated from December 19th - 23rd in the [[northern hemisphere]].Many say that Christmas was set on the 25th so pagans would celebrate that holy day. This day celebrates the end of the dark winter. At this time of year, thanks is given to God and Goddess for their help for getting through the Winter, and to welcome back the Sunlight and warmth. 
 * ''[[Imbolc]]''. Imbolc is celebrated normally on February 2nd, and celebrates the beginning of springtime. Many Wiccans worship Goddess as Brigid on this day. 
 * ''[[Ostara]]'', which is during the spring [[equinox]], and can be celebrated from March 19th - 23rd. This day celebrates the middle of the spring. Ostara is an old Pagan holiday, and pre-dates the [[Christianity|Christian]] holiday of [[Easter]]. 
 * ''[[Beltane]]''. Beltane is normally celebrated on May 1st, and is commonly called ''May Day'' by both Pagans and non-Pagans alike. Many, including non-Pagans dance around maypoles on this day, symbolising the Union of God and Goddess. They celebrate Their (Gods' and Goddess') marriage, and birth, and romantic love on this day. It is said that on this day, as with Samhain, the barrier between this world and the afterlife is thinnest, and so many Wiccans and Pagans take part in séances or rituals to honour their ancestors. 
 * ''[[Litha]]'', sometimes called [[Midsummer]], is on the summer solstice, and can be celebrated from June 19th - 23rd, which is normally the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. From today, the summer starts turning darker, the days get shorter. 
 * ''[[Lammas]]'', sometimes called Lughnadsadh ( " loo-NAH-sah " ), which is named after the Irish-Celtic God [[Lugh]] (pronounced  " loo " ). Lammas can be celebrated on August 1st, and is traditionally the first of two harvests, when corn and wheat are gathered in preparation to be made into food. 
 * ''[[Mabon]]'' is the second harvest, and can be celebrated from September 19th - 23rd, and is at the same time as the Autumn Equinox. Mabon is named after the Welsh-Celtic God of  " Mabon ap Madron, "  meaning  " The Divine Son (Mab) of the Divine Mother (Madron) " . -- >
