 '''Stability''' is a property of many [[system]]s. It means being at rest, not liable to change. In [[mechanics]] and [[fluid dynamics|dynamics]], a system is stable (has stability) if it will not change [[motion]] of its own accord, and will resist small efforts to change its direction or position. 
 
 Thus an [[airliner]] in flight is dynamically stable, and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure ([[wind]]). To change its direction, its [[control system]] must be altered. On the other hand, a [[fighter plane]] is unstable, and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the [[pilot]] and a computer. 
 
 Most nuclear [[isotope]]s are unstable, but the world is mostly made of stable ones.  
 
 In a boat stability means that it is less likely to [[capsize]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.brayyachtdesign.bc.ca/Stability.pdf|title=Stability- what it is and how does it work?}} Bray Yacht Design. retrieved July 17 2019  < /ref >
