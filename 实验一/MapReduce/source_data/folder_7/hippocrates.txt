Previously, people believed that [[disease]] was caused by angry gods. 
 
 Many of Hippocrates' writings are still important to doctors. For example, patient confidentiality, meaning that doctors can only discuss a patient with the patient themselves. Another of his ideas is to never knowingly lead a patient to suffering or death. These kinds of ideas are part of [[medical ethics]]. 
 
 The Hippocratic Oath is named after him. This is a set of rules which doctors promise to obey. We don't exactly know what the original was, but this is an example of a modern ''Hippocratic Oath: 
 ''I do solemnly swear by all I hold most sacred: 
 * that I will be loyal to the profession of medicine and just to its members 
 * that I will lead my life and practice my art with virtue and honor 
 * that into whatsoever home I shall enter it shall be for the good of the sick and the well by the utmost of my power and that I will hold myself aloof from wrong and from corruption and from the tempting of others to vice 
 * that I will exercise my art solely for the benefit of my patients, the relief of suffering, the prevention of disease and promotion of health, and I will give no drug and perform no act for an immoral purpose 
 * that in the treatment of the sick, I will consider their well-being to be of a greater importance than their ability to compensate my services 
 * that what I may see or hear in the course of treatment or even outside the treatment in regard to the lives of persons which is not fitting to be spoken, I will keep inviolably secret 
 * that I will commit myself to a lifetime of continued learning of the art and science of medicine 
 * these things I do promise and in proportion as I am faithful to this oath, may happiness and good repute be ever mine, but should I trespass and violate this oath, may the reverse be my lot. 
 
 The oldest version we have is AD 275, and that is just fragments.
