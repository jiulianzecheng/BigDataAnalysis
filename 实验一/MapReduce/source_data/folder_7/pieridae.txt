 The '''Pieridae''' are a large [[family (biology)|family]] of [[butterfly|butterflies]]. It has about 76 genera and 1,100 species.  They are mostly from [[wikt:tropical|tropical]] [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. < ref name= " eob " > DeVries P.J. in Levin S.A. (ed) 2001. ''The Encyclopaedia of Biodiversity''. Academic Press. < /ref >  Most pierid butterflies are white, yellow or orange with black spots. The [[pigment]]s are a [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]] of this family. < ref name= " CaterDK " > Carter, David, ''Butterflies and Moths'' (2000) < /ref > 
 
 The name  " butterfly "  may have come from a [[wikt:member|member]] of this family, the Brimstone ''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]]''.  It was called the  " butter-coloured fly "  by early British [[naturalist]]s. < ref name= " CaterDK " / > 
 
 The [[caterpillar]]s of some species, such as ''[[Pieris brassicae]]'' and ''[[Pieris rapae]]'', are often seen in gardens. They are [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[Pest (biology)|pests]] because they feed on [[brassica]]s. 
 
 Males of many species feed on salts from moist soil.  They do this in groups.  This [[wikt:behavior|behavior]] is known as 'mud-puddling' or 'puddling'. < ref name= " eob " / > 
 
 ==Classification== 
 The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with 3 or 4 branches  (rarely  5) . The fore legs are well [[wikt:develop|developed]] in both sexes.  The tarsal claws are bifid (bifid means split into two parts). < ref > Borror D.J., Triplehorn C.A.,  &  Johnson N.F. 1989. ''An introduction to the study of insects'', 6th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders College Publishers. {{ISBN|0030253977}} < /ref > 
 
 Like the [[Papilionidae]], Pieridae also have their [[chrysalis|chrysalids]] held at an angle by a silk girdle. The girdle runs around the first abdominal [[wikt:segment|segment]] unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae. 
 
 ==Subfamilies== 
 The Pieridae are divided into the following four [[subfamily|subfamilies]]: 
 
 *[[Dismorphiinae]] (6 genera) They are mostly [[neotropical]].  This group includes many [[mimicry|mimetical]] species. The host plants are in the family [[Fabaceae]]. < ref name= " eob " / > 
 *[[Pierinae]] (55 genera) This subfamily [[wikt:include|includes]] the whites and orange-tips.  Many of these species are strongly [[migration|migratory]].  Their host plants are in the families [[Capparidaceae]], [[Brassicaceae]], [[Santalaceae]], and [[Loranthaceae]]. < ref name= " eob " / > 
 *[[Coliadinae]] (14 genera) This subfamily includes the sulphurs and yellows.  Many of these species are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]].  Some species, such as in the genus ''[[Colias]]'', have wing patterns that are [[wikt:visible|visible]] only under [[ultraviolet]] light. < ref name= " eob " / > 
 *[[Pseudopontiinae]] The main species in this subfamily is ''[[Pseudopontia paradoxa]]''.  It is [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to West Africa.
