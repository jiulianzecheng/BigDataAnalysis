 '''Houten''' is a [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] province in the [[Netherlands]]. The [[population]] of the town in 2007 was about 45,000. 
 
 Houten lies on the railway line from Utrecht to [[Tiel]] and [['s Hertogenbosch]]. In 2004, the railway line needed fixing, but the old station building was in the way. What was done is pretty unique: the old station building was lifted off its foundations, and moved a few hundred metres to new foundations. 
 
 Many people living in Houten have jobs in Utrecht. According to plans of the government, the city should grow to about 50.000 people by 2010. 
 
 People have lived in the area since Roman times.
