 '''Wessex''' was an old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom before [[England]] became one country. It was one of seven kingdoms in England. It was named after the West Saxons. It was in the south and southwest of England. Wessex was a kingdom from the 6th century until the English state was made in the 9th century. It was an [[earl]]dom between 1016 and 1066. Then  " Wessex "  was not an official place name. The 19th century [[novel]]ist [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote about Wessex in his books which tell stories set in that area. 
 
 [[His Royal Highness]] [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Prince Edward]] was given the title  " Earl of Wessex "  when he married Sophie who became the Countess of Wessex. The title Earl of Wessex had not been used since the last earl, King [[Harold Godwinson]], was killed at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.
