A '''mechanism''' is a mechanical device for doing something. It includes the idea of [[tool]]s and [[machine]]s, but is used for a wider range of [[object]]s, [[process]]es and [[idea]]s.  
 
 [[Palaeolithic]] [[hand axe]]s were one of the first tools used. Simple modern mechanisms would be rope [[pulley|pulleys]] or [[lever|levers]]. The [[internal combustion engine]] is a mechanism for turning [[oil]] into [[motion]]. A complicated example would be [[computer]]s and the [[World Wide Web|web]]. 
 
 The word  " mechanism "  is also used as a [[metaphor]]. The [[celestial]] mechanics  of [[Kepler]] and [[Newton]] is a way of predicting and explaining [[planet|planetary]] motions in the [[Solar System]]. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[natural selection]] is his proposed mechanism as to how [[evolution]] took place. 
 
 In that way, a mechanism in [[science]] or [[technology]] is an [[explanation]] of how something works or might work.
