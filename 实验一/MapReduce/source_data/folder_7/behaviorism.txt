 '''Behaviorism''' is an approach to study behavior based only on what can be directly seen. < ref name= " Skinner1984 " > {{cite journal |author=Skinner B.F. 1984.

 Unseen qualities such as [[states of mind]] (any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state e.g. as a result of fear or anxiety) were not used in this type of study even though we know that the [[mind]] plays a part in all advanced animals' behaviors. < ref > Köhler W. 1956. ''The mentality of apes''. London: Routledge and K. Paul. (translated from the 2nd revised edition by Ella Winter) < /ref >  Behaviorism states that behavior can be studied without knowing what the [[physiology]] of an event is, and without using [[theory|theories]] such as that of the [[mind]]. < ref > {{cite book |author=Baum, William M. |title=Understanding behaviorism: science, behavior, and culture |publisher=HarperCollins College Publishers |location=New York, NY |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-06-500286-7}} < /ref >  By [[definition]], all behavior can be observed. 
 
 Behaviorism also relied on another idea, that all human behavior was learned. Behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or [[operant conditioning]]. This is learning as a result of influences from past experiences.  However, behaviorists denied the importance of inherited behaviors, [[instinct|instincts (inherent inclination of a living organism)]], or inherited [[wikt:tendency|tendency]] to behave. They did not believe, or ignored, the idea of [[heredity]](passing of traits to offspring from parents), that something can come from a person's [[genes]]. This was the idea of the [[blank slate]], that babies are born with a clean, empty mind.  Humans, when born, are thought not to have mental [[experience]] or [[knowledge]], and that everything is learned after they grow. < ref > Pinker, Steven 2002. ''The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature''. New York, N.Y: Viking. {{ISBN|978-0-670-03151-1}} < /ref >  The blank slate [[premise]] is opposed by modern [[evolutionary psychology]]. 
 
 Major contributors, scientists to the field of behaviorism include [[C. Lloyd Morgan]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Edward Thorndike]], [[John B. Watson]] and [[B.F. Skinner]]. < ref name= " Fraley " > {{cite journal |last=Fraley |first=LF |year=2001 |title=Strategic interdisciplinary relations between a natural science community and a psychology community |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=209–324 |url=http://www.baojournal.com |format=PDF |access-date=2008-01-10}} < /ref > 
 
 Pavlov researched [[classical conditioning]] through the use of dogs and their natural ability to [[saliva]]te, produce water in their mouths. Thorndike and Watson rejected looking at one's own conscious thoughts and feelings ( " Introspection " ). They wanted to restrict psychology to [[experiment|experimental methods]]. Skinner's research leant mainly on behavior shaping using positive [[reinforcement]] (rewards rather than punishments). 
 
 Today, ideas from behaviorism are used in [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]]. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help people deal with [[anxiety|anxieties]] and [[phobia]]s, as well as with certain forms of [[addiction]]. 
 
 As a [[scientific theory]], behaviorism has largely been replaced by [[cognitive psychology]]. 
 
 == Conditioning == 
 The act of [[conditioning]] is when a wanted behavior is made through [[training]]. This is done by matching stimuli with a specific behavior. Some behaviors are natural [[reflex]]es which  people (and animals) are born with. Infants are born with [[inherited]] reflexes that help them eat, communicate, and survive. These reflexes are unconditioned, they are not taught to the baby. < ref name= " Behavior " > {{cite book |author=Domjan, Michael |title=The principles of learning and behavior |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Mason, Ohio |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4240-8608-5}} < /ref > < ref name= " History " > {{cite book |author=Kardas, Edward P. |title=History of psychologyː the making of a science |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-111-18666-1}} < /ref > 
 
 == Classical conditioning == 
 {{main|classical conditioning}} 
 Classical conditioning (also known as [[Pavlovian conditioning]]) is when a conditioned stimulus causes an unconditioned response. < ref name=History / >  This explains how people get new responses to different stimuli. 
 
 Another example of an unconditioned response is when wind is blown in a person's eyes and they blink without thinking to prevent dust or something from getting into them. This is a reflex that is [[wikt:innate|innate]]. < ref name=Behavior / > 
 
 [[Fear]] conditioning is when a stimulus that used to be a neutral stimulus is used to create fear. One main example is the Little Albert experiment by Watson and Rayner. < ref > Watson, John B.  &  Rayner, Rosalie 1920. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', 3(1), 1–14. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Watson/emotion.htm Conditioned emotional reactions (The Little Albert study, 1920).] 
 < /ref >  The researchers tested infants' emotional reactions. They found that Little Albert would react to a loud noise and because of that he conditioned that noise to elicit fear when he saw a white rat. This came to be known as 'conditioned emotional response'. After a period of time, Little Albert would cry when he saw a white rat or anything small and white, even his stuffed animal. < ref name=Behavior / > 
 
 == Operant conditioning == 
 {{main|operant conditioning}} 
 [[Operant conditioning]] is also known as [[instrumental conditioning]]. < ref name=History / >  It was studied by [[Thorndike]] and [[Skinner]].
