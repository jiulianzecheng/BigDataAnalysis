 '''Yggdrasil''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Yggdrasill'') is the name of the immense cosmic [[tree]] that serves as the connection between the Nine Worlds in [[Norse mythology]]. Known as the '''World Tree''', Yggdrasil was said to lie at the very center of the universe, supported by three roots which extend far away into varying locations. Various creatures dwell within Yggdrasil. Upon the onset of [[Ragnarök]], Yggdrasil will shudder and groan, ultimately crumbling as the universe meets its end. < ref > [https://mistymag.ru/derevo-iggdrasil/ What is the Yggdrasil tree and its meaning] < /ref > 
 
 == Yggdrasil and Its Structure == 
 Yggdrasil's roots extend into three locations: '''Urðarbrunnr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “Well of Urðr”), '''Hvergelmir''' (Old Norse: “bubbling "  or  " boiling spring " ), and '''Mímisbrunnr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “Well of [[Mímir]] " ). As seen in the Poetic Edda poem, Grímnismál (Old Norse:  " Sayings of [[Odin|Grímnir]] " ), various creatures dwell within the World Tree, including:  
 
 '''Níðhöggr''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Níðhǫggr'' - “Malice striker”), a massive dragon/serpent-like being that gnaws at its root(s), an unnamed eagle, and the hawk '''Veðrfölnir''' (Old Norse: “wind bleached” or “wind-witherer”), who sits between its eyes, along with the four stags '''Dáinn''', '''Dvalinn''', '''Duneyrr''', and '''Duraþrór'''.  
 
 The '''Three Norns''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Nornir'') - Urðr ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: “fate”), Verðandi ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: possibly “happening” or “present”), and Skuld ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: possibly “debt” or “future”) - attend to Yggdrasil, weaving the fates of both gods and men.
