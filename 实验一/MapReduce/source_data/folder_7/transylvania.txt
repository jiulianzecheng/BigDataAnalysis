 '''Transylvania''' is a historical region in [[Central Europe]]. In the past, it was a part of [[Hungary]], was an independent [[principality]], belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]] or was a province of [[Austria-Hungary]]. It has been part of  [[Romania]] since the end of [[World War I]] in 1918. 
 
 The borders was made up by the [[Siret River]] from east, river [[Tisza]] from west of north and south by the [[Carpathian Mountains]].  
 
 Transylvania's main city, [[Cluj-Napoca]], is seen as the region's informal capital. But Transylvania was also ruled from [[Alba Iulia]] during its dependence from the Ottoman Empire, and the seat of the [[Transylvanian Diet]] was moved to [[Sibiu]] for some time in the 19th century. 
 
 In popular culture, Transylvania is mainly known as the seat (and origin) of [[Count Dracula]]. This [[vampire]] story by [[Bram Stoker]] is based on a local nobleman [[Vlad III the Impaler]], known for his cruelty. It also was the home of [[Elizabeth BÃ¡thory]].
