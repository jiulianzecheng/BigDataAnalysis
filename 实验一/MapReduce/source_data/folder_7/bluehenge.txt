 '''Bluestonehenge''' or '''Bluehenge''' (also known as '''West Amesbury Henge''') is a [[prehistoric]] [[henge]] and [[stone circle]] monument. < ref name=pastscape1 > [http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1580342 Historic England.  " West Amesbury Henge (1580342) " . PastScape] < /ref > 
 It was discovered by the [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] about {{convert|1|mi}} south-east of [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. All that remains of the site is the ditch of the henge and a series of stone settings, none of which is visible above ground. 
 
 Excavation revealed two flint chisel arrowheads in a style commonly used during 3400-2500 & nbsp;BC. The stones have been put up in that period. It is estimated that there may have been as many as 27 stones in a circle 33 & nbsp;feet (10 & nbsp;m) wide. 
 
 The site was excavated in August 2008 and again in August 2009. It is considered an important find by [[archaeologist]]s. < ref name= " news.bbc.co.uk " > {{cite news | title =Mini-Stonehenge find 'important' | publisher =[[BBC]] | date =3 October 2009 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wiltshire/8288567.stm | access-date =3 October 2009 }} < /ref > < ref > ''[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba110/feat1.shtml Newhenge]'', British Archaeology 110, January / February 2010, {{ISSN|1357-4442}} < /ref > 
 
 The name  " Bluestonehenge "  is from the small stone chips found in some of the stone settings. These bluestones are also found in Stonehenge and consist of a wide range of rock types originally from [[Pembrokeshire]] West Wales, some {{convert|150|mi}} away. < ref name= " news.bbc.co.uk " / > < ref name= " dailymail.co.uk " > Derbyshire, David 2009.

 The stone circle settings were surrounded by a henge, comprising an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} ditch and outer bank which appears to date from approximately 2400 & nbsp;BC. < ref name=Sheffield/ >
