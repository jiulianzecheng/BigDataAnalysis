'''Materialism''' is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] belief that the [[world]] is made of [[material]], and that there are no other types of [[wikt:entity|entity]] (things). Everything is composed of material. Things that are not made of material, such as [[consciousness]], are the result of actions by material. < ref > A materialist would say that 'consciousness is an '''epiphenomenon''' of the brain'. < /ref >  In other words, matter is the only real substance. ''[[Physicalism]]'' is a related term. < ref > Lange, Friedrich A. 1925. ''The history of materialism''. New York, Harcourt, Brace. < /ref > < ref > [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/materialism-eliminative Eliminative materialism] < /ref > 
 
 Especially, a materialist does not believe in [[supernatural]] entities. Many of history's materialists thinkers have found the idea of a [[spirit]] either meaningless or not scientifically proven. By definition, these thinkers are therefore also [[atheists]], though not all atheists are materialists, and there have even been some historically important Materialist thinkers who believe in a [[Pantheism|Pantheist]] idea of [[God]] (such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]). 
 
 Modern philosophical materialists extend the definition to include other basic entities proven by [[science]], such as [[energy]], [[Force (physics)|forces]], and the curvature of [[Space (physics)|space]]. Matter and energy are known to be interchangeable, and much else, such as [[gravity]], is caused by matter. However, the concept of matter is itself not entirely clear. < ref > Vitzthum, Richard C. 1995.

 Other types of philosophy share some of the aims of materialism. Examples would include [[reductionism]], [[logical positivism]] and [[empiricism]]. 
 
 The origin of materialism is in a type of [[Ancient Greek philosophy]]. [[Thales]], [[Epicurus]], and [[Lucretius]] are early materialist philosophers. The idea also appeared in other ancient cultures.
