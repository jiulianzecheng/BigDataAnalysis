'''FrogWatch''' is a name shared by [[citizen science]] programs that do the same thing. In a FrogWatch, people make recordings of [[frogs]] and other [[amphibians]] that live near them and send the recordings to databases for scientists and other people to hear and study. 
 
 Not all FrogWatch programs are run by the same people.

 In citizen science, scientists ask ordinary people to help with scientific research or other work.  Citizen science is one kind of [[crowdsourcing]]. 
 
 The [[National Geographic Society]] developed the program that FrogWatch USA volunteers use to add information and that FrogWatch uses to study it. < ref name= " AZA "  / >   Volunteers record temperature with thermometers and listen for sounds made by specific types of frogs and toads.  FrogWatch USA volunteers listen to and record frog habitats for three and a half minutes, starting one half-hour (30 minutes) after the sun goes down. < ref name= " Report "  / > < ref name= " SciAm " > {{cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/frogwatch-usa-aza/|publisher=Scientific American|title=FrogWatch USA: Learn about the wetlands in your community and help conserve amphibians by reporting the calls of local frogs and toads|access-date=December 13, 2019|date=July 26, 2011}} < /ref > 
 
 Scientists have used FrogWatch to study the way frogs and toads change the places they live, which types of frogs are becoming more numerous and which are becoming less numerous, [[species diversity|how many different kinds of frogs live in one place]], the way they react to changes in how hot or cold it is, and the way they act during different parts of the year. < ref name= " Report "  / > 
 
 ==History== 
 
 The [[United States Geological Survey]] started FrogWatch USA in 1998, but the [[National Wildlife Federation]] took over in 2002. < ref name= " Report " > {{cite web|url=https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2332/1998-2005_fw_data_assessment.pdf|title=FINAL REPORT ASSESSMENT OF UTILITY OF FROGWATCH USA DATA 1998-2005|date=October 31, 2006|access-date=December 13, 2019|author=Douglas B. Inkley, Ph.D.|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}} < /ref > 
 
 Between 1998 and 2005, 1,395 people working with FrogWatch USA visited 1,942 places where frogs live and gave information to FrogWatch.  They found 79 different kinds of frogs and toads.  This does not count visits, places, or species for FrogWatch Canada or FrogWatches in other countries. In 2006, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] looked at FrogWatch USA for the [[U.S. Geological Survey]]. It said that FrogWatch was so good for science that the USGS should keep giving it enough money to work. It also said that FrogWatch helped teach people and it made scientific work cost less money. < ref name= " Report "  / > 
 
 FrogWatch NT works in northern [[Australia]]. It started in 1991 after [[cane toad]]s came to Australia and [[invasive species|caused problems there]]. < ref name= " Au " > {{cite web|url=http://www.frogwatch.org.au/?action=cms.page & section=3|title=FrogWatch|access-date=December 13, 2019}} < /ref >
