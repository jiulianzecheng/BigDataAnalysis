 '''François-Marie Arouet''' (also known as '''Voltaire''' < ref > Origin of name is the [[anagram]] of  " Aroueti " . < /ref > ) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]]. He was born in 1694 and grew up in [[Poitou]]. He died in Paris in 1778. 
 
 Voltaire did not like France at the time because he thought that it was old fashioned. He also did not like the [[Church]] and thought that people should be allowed to believe what they want. However he did not like [[democracy]] either and thought that a country needed to be led by a wise and strong [[king]]. Voltaire had to live in [[exile]] in [[England]] for three years from 1726 to 1729 where these ideas were more common. He liked the philosophy of [[John Locke]]. 
 
 Voltaire was also a writer. He wrote many [[book]]s, [[poem]]s and [[Play (theatre)|plays]], some of which are still liked today. A lot of his work was against France and the Church. This meant that he was unpopular at first but became more popular towards the time of the [[French Revolution]]. He also studied [[science]] and wrote a lot about people and places he knew. His writings later led to the French revolution, which changed France from a [[Hereditary monarchy|Hereditary Monarchy]] into a Republic.  
 
 Voltaire believed in a [[God]] but did not believe in a God personally involved in people's lives, like the [[Christianity|Christian]] God. This is called [[Deism]].
