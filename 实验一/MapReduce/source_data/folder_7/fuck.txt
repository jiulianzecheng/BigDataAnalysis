 '''Fuck''' is a common [[English language]] [[Profanity|swear word]]. It can be used to either mean the act of [[sexual intercourse|sex]] or as an expression. However, the word ''fucking'' is used as an intensifier before a word (e.g. I ''fucking hate this game''). 
 
 It is commonly used to express anger and frustration (e.g. when something is not going in your favour or if someone is frustrating you)
