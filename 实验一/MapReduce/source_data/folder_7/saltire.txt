 A '''saltire''' is a [[diagonal]] [[cross]] used on [[flags]] and in [[heraldry]]. For example, the [[flag of Scotland]] (named St Andrew's cross) has a white saltire on a blue flag. The [[Union Jack]] (the flag of [[Britain]]) has two saltires of different colours: a white saltire copied from the flag of Scotland, and a red saltire taken from a flag of Ireland (named St Patrick's cross).
