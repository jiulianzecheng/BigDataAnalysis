 '''Tarnish''' is a layer of [[corrosion]] similar to [[rust]]. It is caused by [[oxidisation]] - when semi - reactive [[metals]] such as [[copper]], [[brass]], [[silver]], or [[Aluminium|aluminum]] meet chemicals in the air. It will cause the metal to darken or go dull by making a thin film on the metal. It is caused by a chemical reaction, between a metal and a non metal (or compound), usually [[oxygen]] or [[sulphur dioxide]].
