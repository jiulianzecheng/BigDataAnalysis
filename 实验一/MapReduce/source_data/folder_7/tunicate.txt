 '''Tunicates''' ('''sea squirts''' or '''Urochordata''') are a [[phylum|subphylum]] of the [[Chordate]]s.  
 
 They are sea [[filter]]-feeders: they live mainly on [[plankton]]. They are called tunicates because the adult form is covered by a [[leather]]y [[tunic]]. This tunic supports and protects the animal. The adults are [[sessile]], stuck to [[Rock (geology)|rocks]].   
 
 Many tunicates are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] or semi-colonial in their adult stage. They are quite a large group, containing about 3,000 [[species]]. The adults live mostly on the sea floor, in the [[littoral zone]]. 
 
 == Feeding == 
 The sea squirt has two openings in its small body. One opening, called the ''oral siphon'', sucks water into the animal; the other opening, called the ''atrial siphon'', squirts water out of the animal. Inside is a little basket-like [[sieve]] which traps food: so these sea squirts are filter feeders. The Sea squirt can close the holes in its siphons, like a drawstring can close the opening in a bag.  
 
 == Life cycle == 
 When in its [[larvae|larval state]], it looks like a [[tadpole]] and is sometimes called a ''tadpole larva''. Like many sea creatures, a sea squirt larva looks very different from an adult sea squirt. The larva swims for a short time and then attaches itself to something on the sea floor, like a rock, transforming into its adult form. It usually stays in one place for the rest of its life. 
 
 == Relationships == 
 Tunicates are more closely related to [[Craniata|craniates]] ([[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, jawed [[vertebrate]]s) than to [[lancelet]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, [[hemichordate]]s, or other [[invertebrate]]s. < ref name= " pmid16495997 " > {{cite journal | author = Delsuc F., Brinkmann H., Chourrout D.  &  Philippe H. | title = Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7079 | pages = 965–968 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16495997 | doi = 10.1038/nature04336| s2cid = 4382758 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halsde-00315436/file/Delsuc-Nature06_HAL.pdf| issn = }} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid19003928 " > {{cite journal | author = Delsuc F., Tsagkogeorga G., Lartillot N.  &  Philippe H. | title = Additional molecular support for the new chordate phylogeny | journal = Genesis | volume = 46 | issue = 11 | pages = 592–604 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19003928 | doi = 10.1002/dvg.20450| s2cid = 205771088 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halsde-00338411/file/Delsuc-Genesis08-HAL.pdf| issn = }} < /ref > < ref name= " pmid19922605 " > {{cite journal | author = Singh T.

 == Discoveries == 
 [[Chemical substance]]s which might help fight diseases like [[cancer]] or  various [[viruses]] have been found in some species.  
 
 Scientists have also found out that some species can heal some damage done to them, over several generations. A similar process might be possible for humans. < ref > [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070424093740.htm Sea Squirt, heal thyself: scientists make major breakthrough in regenerative medicine] < /ref >
