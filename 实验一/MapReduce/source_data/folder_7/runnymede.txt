 '''Runnmede''' is a water-[[meadow]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], 20 miles (32 & nbsp;km) west of London. The site is owned and managed by [[The National Trust]], and runs alongside the [[River Thames]]. It is one of England's most visited [[tourist]] sites. 
 
 At Runnymede, [[John of England|King John]] sealed the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215. Over eight centuries later, the [[memorial]] for those of the Allied [[Air Force]]s who died in [[World War II]] was placed on Runnymede. The British memorial to [[John F. Kennedy]] was put there in 1965.

The Witan, < ref > Council of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of the 7th to 11th centuries < /ref >  the Saxon Council, was held from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of [[Alfred the Great]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-runnymede/w-runnymede-history.htm|title=History of Runnymede|last=Anon|work=Days out ad visits|publisher=The National Trust|accessdate=1 October 2009|archive-date=2010-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607073133/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-runnymede/w-runnymede-history.htm|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The Council met usually in the open air, a tradition that influenced the creation of the [[English Parliament]] in the [[13th century]].
