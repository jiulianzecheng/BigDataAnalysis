 '''Bronchospasm''' or a bronchial spasm is a sudden tightening of the muscles in the walls of the [[bronchiole]]s. It is caused by the release ([[degranulation]]) of substances from [[mast cells]] or [[basophil]]s because of [[anaphylatoxin]]s. It causes difficulty in breathing which can be very mild to severe. Bronchospasms can be caused by [[asthma]], chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[anaphylaxis]].  
 
 Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a [[Tracheal tube|breathing tube]] during [[general anesthesia]]. Some of the things that can cause bronchospasms are: consuming foods, taking medicines, allergic responses to insects, and hormone levels, particularly in women. < ref name=Haggerty2003 > {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)61794-2 |title=The impact of estrogen and progesterone on asthma |url=https://archive.org/details/sim_annals-of-allergy-asthma-and-immunology_2003-03_90_3/page/284 |year=2003 |last1=Haggerty |first1=Catherine L. |last2=Ness |first2=Roberta B. |last3=Kelsey |first3=Sheryl |last4=Waterer |first4=Grant W. |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma  &  Immunology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=284-91; quiz 291-3, 347|pmid=12669890 }} < /ref >
