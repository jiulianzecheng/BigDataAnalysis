 '''Thiruvananthapuram''' ({{lang-ml|തിരുവനന്തപുരം}}) is the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of the [[India]]n [[States of India|state]] of [[Kerala]]. The city used to be known by the name of '''Trivandrum'''. It is on the west [[coast]] of India near the far south of the [[mainland]]. 
 With 889,191 people as of [[2001]], it is the biggest city in Kerala in terms of size and number of people. 
 
 The city is the state capital and houses many [[government of India|national]] and state government offices, organizations and companies. It is also a major center of learning and is home to several schools and colleges including '''Kerala University''', and to many scientific institutions, the most prominent being the '''Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre''' ('''VSSC'''), '''Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology''' ('''SCTIMST'''), '''Technopark''', '''Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology''' ('''RGCB''') and '''Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology''' ('''IIST'''). 
 
 ==Origin of name== 
 Thiruvananthapuram literally means  " ''City of Lord Anantha'' "  in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]. The name derives from the [[god]] of the [[Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temple]] at the centre of the city. Anantha is the serpent '''Shesha''' on whom Padmanabhan or [[Vishnu]] lies. The temple of [[Vishnu]] lying on '''Ananta''', the '''Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple''' is the most recognizable landmark of the city. The city was officially known as ''Trivandrum'' in English until 1991, when the government decided to change the city's name back to the original name, Thiruvananthapuram, in all languages. However, the city is still widely referred to as  " Trivandrum "  (now Thiruvananthapuram). 
 
 ==Infrastructure== 
 The city is fully [[electricity|electrified]] by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The district is divided in to three circles: Transmission circle, Thiruvananthapuram city and Kattakkada. Domestic users account for 43% of the total power usage, or 90 million units per month. Thiruvananthapuram district has one 220 & nbsp;kV, nine 110 & nbsp;kV and six 66 & nbsp;kV [[electrical substation]]s. A 400 & nbsp;kV substation has just been commissioned by the Power Grid Corporation and will ensure high-quality power supply to the city. < ref name= " Infrastructure in Thiruvananthapuram " > {{cite web

 The water supply schemes cover 100% within the city limits. It is 84% of the urban and 69% of the rural population, when the district is considered. '''Peppara''' and '''Aruvikkara''' dams are the main sources of water for distribution in the capital city. The new project plan for improving the water supply with [[Japan]] aid covers Thiruvananthapuram city and six suburban panchayats having urban characteristics. < ref name= " Infrastructure in Thiruvananthapuram " / > 
 
 The sewerage system in the city was implemented at the time of the Travancore Kingdom, and modernised in 1938. This scheme for the disposal of sullage and sewage is an underground system. The whole system is controlled by Kerala Water Authority now. The city area is divided in to seven blocks for the execution of the sewerage system, two commissioned in the 1990s and two after 2000. The sewerage is pumped to a stilling chamber at the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) at Valiyathura, and is disposed through sewage farming. Diary Development Department maintains this sewage farm and fodder cultivation is done here. There is no revenue generation from this scheme, and the sewerage system in the city is a service provided to the residents. < ref name= " Thiruvananthapuram Sewerage Scheme " > {{cite web
