 '''Mir''' was a [[space station]] created by the [[Soviet Union]] and later owned and operated by [[Russia]]. It existed from [[1984]] to [[23 March]] [[2001]]. When it was retired, it moved towards the [[Earth]] and burned up in its [[atmosphere]]. Mir is now replaced with the [[International Space Station]]. It was the first space station to be made out of multiple modules, unlike the previous [[Salyut]] series of space stations, which were only made out of one module.
