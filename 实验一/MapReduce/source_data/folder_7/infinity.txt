 '''Infinity''' ( < math > \infty < /math > ) is about things that never end. It is written in a single digit. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from [[Latin]] origin, meaning  " without end " . Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop. 
 
 Infinity is usually not an actual number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how ''many'' there is of something, instead of how ''big'' something is. For example, there are infinitely many [[whole number]]s (called [[integer]]s), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes. 
 
 There are two kinds of infinity: [[potential]] infinity and [[wikt:actual|actual]] infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity, on the other hand, refers to objects that are accepted as infinite entities (such as [[Transfinite number|transfinite numbers]]). < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2019-08-01|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon: Infinite|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#infinite|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref > 
 
 == Infinity in Mathematics == 
 [[Mathematicians]] have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity. < ref name= " ax " > To simply, we will assume several axioms like the [[Axiom of choice]] and the [[Generalized continuum hypothesis]]. < /ref > 
 
 ===Counting infinity=== 
 The number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different [[cardinal numbers]]. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the [[natural numbers]]. There is a smallest infinite number, ''countable infinity''. It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the [[rational numbers]]. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] with a subscript zero;  < math > \aleph_0 < /math > . It is spoken  " [[Aleph null|aleph naught]] < nowiki/ > " . < ref > {{Cite web|title=Transfinite number {{!}} mathematics|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/transfinite-number|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers. < ref name= " ax "  / >  The number of [[real numbers]], that is, all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of [[rational numbers]], the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than  < math > \aleph_0 < /math >  is  < math > \aleph_1 < /math >  ([[aleph one]]). The number of mathematical [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] is the next infinite cardinal number,  < math > \aleph_2 < /math > . 
 And these numbers, called aleph numbers, < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|date=2020-04-11|title=Comprehensive List of Set Theory Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/set-theory-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-06|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}} < /ref >  go on without end. 
 
 ===Ordering infinity=== 
 A different ''type'' of infinity are the [[ordinal numbers]], beginning  " first, second, third, ... " . The order  " first, second, third, ... "  and so on to infinity is ''different'' from the order ''ending''  " ..., third, second, first " . The difference is important for [[mathematical induction]]. The simple ''first, second, third, ... '' has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero:  < math > \omega_0 < /math > . < ref name= " :0 "  / >  (Or simply omega  < math >                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \omega < /math > .) The infinite series ending  " ... third, second, first "  is  < math >  ^*\omega  < /math > . 
 
 ===The real line and complex plane=== 
 The third ''type'' of infinity has the symbol  < math > \infty < /math > . This is treated as addition to the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]]. It is the result of division by zero, or to indicate that a [[series]] is increasing (or decreasing) without bound. The series 1, 2, 3, ... increases without upper bound. This is written: the limit is  < math > +\infty < /math > . In [[calculus]], the [[integral]] over all real numbers is written:  < math >  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)\,dx < /math > 
 
 ==The arithmetic of infinity== 
 Each kind of infinity has different rules. 
 
 ===Addition, multiplication, exponentiation=== 
 
 < math > \aleph_0 + 1 = 1 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0  < /math >  Addition with  " alephs "  is [[commutative]]. 
 
 < math >  2 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 \times 2 = \aleph_0 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 < /math >  Multiplication with  " alephs "  is commutative. 
 
 < math >  \aleph_0 + \aleph_1 = \aleph_1 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_1 < /math > 
 
 < math >  {\aleph_0} ^ {\aleph_0}  >  3 ^ {\aleph_0}  >  2 ^ {\aleph_0} = \aleph_1  < /math > . < ref name=ax / > 
 
 < math >  1 + \omega = \omega \neq \omega +1  < /math > . Addition with  " omegas "  is not commutative. 
 
 < math >  2 \times \omega = \omega \neq \omega \times 2  < /math > . Multiplication with  " omegas "  is not commutative. 
 
 < math >  \omega + \omega = \omega \times 2  < /math > 
 
 < math >  \omega ^ \omega  >  3 ^ \omega  >  2 ^ \omega  < /math > 
 
 < math >  x + \infty = \infty = \infty + \infty = \infty \times \infty = 2 ^ \infty  < /math > 
 
 ===Subtraction, division=== 
 
 Division by infinity (for example, with omegas or alephs) is not meaningful. Subtraction with infinity is not meaningful.
