 '''Cichlids''' (pronounced 'sick-lids') are [[fish]]es from the family '''Cichlidae''', in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cichliformes]]. 
 
 It is a very large family of fish made up of more than 2500 [[species]]. 
 Cichlids come in many different [[size]]s, from 2.5 [[centimeter]]s to almost a [[metre|meter]] long. All cichlids have some form of [[parental care]] for their eggs and fry. That parental care may come in the form of guarding the eggs and fry or it may come in the form of [[mouthbrooding]]. Cichlids are famous for their [[speciation]] in [[East Africa]]n [[lake]]s. < ref name= " Salzburger " > {{cite journal | author = Salzburger W., Mack T., Verheyen E., Meyer A.|year = 2005 | title = Out of Tanganyika: genesis, explosive speciation, key-innovations and phylogeography of the haplochromine cichlid fishes | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | number = 17 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-5-17.pdf | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-17  | pages = 17 | pmid = 15723698  | pmc = 554777}} < /ref > < ref name= " Kornfield " > {{cite journal | author = Kornfield, Irv  &  Smith, Peter | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.163 | title = African Cichlid fishes: model systems for evolutionary biology | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 31 | pages = 163–196 | date = November 2000 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.163 | access-date = 2011-06-06 | archive-date = 2017-11-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107200413/http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.163 | url-status = dead }} < /ref >
