A '''bachelor''' is a man who has not been [[marriage|married]] and is not [[cohabiting]]. He lives on his own or with a [[flatmate]]/[[housemate]]. A woman in this situation is sometimes known as a bachelorette. A bachelor cannot have been married, as a man who married but then [[divorce]]d is called a [[divorc√©]]. A man whose [[wife]] is dead is a [[widower]]. 
 
 Sometimes, when a bachelor is going to be married, a [[bachelor party]] is organized to celebrate the last day that the person will be a bachelor for.
