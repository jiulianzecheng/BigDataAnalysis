'''Ermanaric''' ({{lang-got|*Aírmanareiks}}; {{lang-la|Ermanaricus}};  {{lang-ang|Eormanrīc}} {{IPA-ang|ˈeormɑnriːtʃ|}}; {{lang-on|Jǫrmunrekr}} {{IPA-non|ˈjɔrmunrekr|}}; died 376) was a Ostrogothic king of the [[Greuthungian]] tribe. 
 
 The main source on his life is the 6th-century Roman historian [[Jordanes]]. 
 
 Said to have died when he was 110, he appears in Germanic legend as a vicious and warlike ruler. He ruled over much of modern [[Ukraine]] before the [[Huns]] invaded in 370 AD.
