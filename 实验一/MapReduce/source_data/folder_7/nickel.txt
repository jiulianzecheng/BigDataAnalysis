 '''Nickel''' ([[chemical symbol]] '''Ni''') is an [[element]]. It has an [[atomic number]] of 28 and an [[atomic mass]] of about 58.69amu. It has 28 [[proton]]s. It is a [[transition metal]].  
 
 ==Properties== 
 ===Physical properties=== 
 Nickel is a silver-white [[metal]]. It is easily polished (made shiny). It is [[magnetic]]. It is not magnetic when heated above {{convert|355|C|F}}. It is not soft like many other metals. It can be stretched into wires easily. It is not radioactive. 
 ===Chemical properties=== 
 Nickel is not a reactive metal. It dissolves slowly in acids. It does not rust like [[iron]]. It makes a thin coating of [[nickel(II) oxide]] which stops more corrosion. [[Aluminium]] does a similar thing.  
 
 ===Chemical compounds=== 
 [[File:Nickel(II)-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Nickel(II) chloride]] 
 [[File:Nickel(II)-sulfate-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Nickel(II) sulfate]] 
 Nickel is found in two [[oxidation state]]s: +2, nickel(II); and +3, nickel(III). Nickel(II) is more common. Nickel in its +2 oxidation state is green. [[Nickel(II) chloride]] is a common +2 oxidation state compound. Nickel(II) oxide is normally dark green, but sometimes it is gray. This is because some of the nickel is in the +3 oxidation state (nickel(III). Nickel(III) compounds are [[oxidizing agent]]s. They also are grayish. Nickel compounds can be green, blue, gray, or black. 
 
 ;Nickel(II) compounds 
 Nickel(II) compounds are not highly reactive. They are normally green or blue. They are toxic and irritate skin. Some of them are [[carcinogen]]s. 
 *[[Nickel(II) carbonate]], green 
 *[[Nickel(II) chloride]], greenish 
 *[[Nickel(II) hydroxide]], light green 
 *[[Nickel(II) nitrate]], greenish 
 *[[Nickel(II) oxide]], gray or light green 
 *[[Nickel(II) sulfate]], blue-green 
 
 ;Nickel(III) compounds 
 Nickel(III) compounds are black or gray. 
 *[[Nickel(III) oxide]] 
 
 ==Isotopes== 
 The isotopes of nickel range in [[atomic weight]] from  < sup > 48 < /sup > Ni to  < sup > 78 < /sup > Ni. Nickel that is found in [[nature]] is made up of five stable [[isotope]]s;  < sup > 58 < /sup > Ni,  < sup > 60 < /sup > Ni,  < sup > 61 < /sup > Ni,  < sup > 62 < /sup > Ni and  < sup > 64 < /sup > Ni. 
 
 At least 26 [[radioisotope]]s of nickel have been found. The most stable radioisotope is  < sup > 59 < /sup > Ni which has a [[half-life]] of 76,000 years. Nickel also has one [[meta state]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G.|last2=Bersillon|first2=O.|last3=Blachot|first3=J.|last4=Wapstra|first4=A.H.|date=2003|title=The Nubase evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947403018074|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=729|issue=1|pages=3–128|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|via=}} < /ref > 
 
 == History == 
 Nickel was found when an ore that looked like copper did not make copper metal. Later it was found that the ore actually had a new metal, called nickel. Nickel was isolated as a metal and classified as a chemical element by [[Axel Fredrik Cronstedt]] in 1751. At first, the copper colored nickel ore was the only source. Later, it was made as a byproduct of [[cobalt blue]] making. 
 
 == Occurrence == 
 [[File:Limonite-70871.jpg|thumb|A common nickel ore]] 
 
 Nickel is normally found as a mineral, and not as a metal in the ground. Sometimes [[wikt:meteorite|meteorites]] have nickel and iron metal in them.  The most common nickel mineral is [[Pentlandite|pentlandite]]. Most of the nickel on Earth is thought to be in the Earth's [[outer core|Earth's outer]] and [[Inner core|inner cores]]. There are sulfidic and lateritic nickel ores. [[Philippines]] mines the most nickel. Other major mining countries are Russia, Canada and Australia. All the older rocks on Earth have some rare metals. They are got by mining where the ores are most plentiful. 
 
 == Preparation == 
 Nickel is found in both [[laterite]] and [[sulfide]] ores. They are heated to melt them and concentrate them. They are also separated by oils. Nickel is made from its sulfide by heating it in air. This [[oxidation|oxidizes]] the sulfide to [[sulfur dioxide]], leaving liquid nickel behind. This nickel is not yet pure and not ready for use.  
 
 Pure nickel with a nickel content greater than 99% is made in an electrolytic process. In this process, the nickel is dissolved in bath of [[sulfuric acid]]. When the pure nickel sticks to [[Cathode|cathodes]] hanging into the bath, the impurities remain in the [[sulfuric acid]] or at the bottom of the bath. These impurities are very interesting, as they can contain precious metals.  
 
 == Production == 
 [[File:Nickel extraction.svg|thumb|Evolution of the annual nickel extraction, according to ores.]] 
 
 Nickel is got by mining: the ore is roasted and reduced. This gives a metal of over 75% purity. In many [[stainless steel]] applications, 75% pure nickel is usable. 
 
 ==Uses==

 Sixty-eight percent of all nickel produced is used to make [[stainless steel]]. Nickel is also used in [[nichrome]], a name for a nickel-[[chromium]] alloy, and other alloys. Nickel is used in [[magnet]]s. Nickel is used in special expensive alloys called [[wikt:superalloy|superalloys]]. 
 
 Nickel sulphate is used in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. A [[lithium ion battery]] contains up to 15% of nickel while the lithium content is less than 1%. A [[nickel cadmium battery]] also uses nickel. Nickel compounds are also used to [[electroplating|electroplate]] nickel on items. Nickel and some of its compounds are also used as a [[catalyst]]. Nickel is used in [[stainless steel]]. It is also used in some [[Nonferrous alloy|nonferrous alloys]]. It is used in [[electroplating]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Fun facts about nickel element - Nickel Institute|url=https://www.nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/AboutNickel/FirstAndEndUsesofNickel.aspx|access-date=2020-09-29|website=www.nickelinstitute.org|language=en|archive-date=2017-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000402/https://www.nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/AboutNickel/FirstAndEndUsesofNickel.aspx|url-status=dead}} < /ref >

 ==Safety== 
 Nickel can irritate skin. That is why jewelry that releases nickel ions is bad for some people. Some nickel salts are [[carcinogen|carcinogens.]] Nickel is not as toxic as other metals such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] but it is still toxic.
