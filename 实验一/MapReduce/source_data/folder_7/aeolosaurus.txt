 '''''Aeolosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|oʊ-|l|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɔːr|ə|s}};  " Aeolus' lizard " ) is a well-known [[titanosaur]] [[sauropod]]. ''Aeolosaurus'' is well known for a titanosaur, as it is represented by the remains of several individuals belonging to at least three species. However, like most [[sauropod]]s, no remains of the skull are known. 
 The [[holotype]] of ''Aeolosaurus rionegrinus'' consists of a series of seven tail [[vertebra]]e, as well as parts of both forelimbs and the right hindlimb. It was discovered in [[Argentina]] and is about about 83 to 74 million years old. 
 
 ''Aeolosaurus maximus'' became ''[[Arrudatitan]]'' in 2021.
