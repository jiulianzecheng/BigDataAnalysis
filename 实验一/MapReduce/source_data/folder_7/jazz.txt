 ==What is jazz?== 
 It is difficult to give an exact definition for  " jazz " . < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfFgNABSuuUC|title=The History and Tradition of Jazz|author=Larson, Thomas|date=2002|publisher=Kendall Hunt|isbn=9780787275747}} < /ref >  A singer Nina Simone said,  " Jazz is not just music, it is a way of life, it is a way of being, a way of thinking " . < ref name= " :0 "  / >  But when we talk about jazz as music, one important part of jazz is [[improvisation]] (improv), which means the person playing is making music up as they go along. If a jazz band is playing a song, the song may have several solos where one player will improvise while the rest of the band, except for the rhythm section (such as the piano, bass, or drums), does not play. Most jazz is very rhythmic, which is called  " swing, "  and uses  " blue "  notes. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2015-03-09|title=What is Jazz?|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/smithsonian-jazz/education/what-jazz|access-date=2020-08-11|website=National Museum of American History|language=en}} < /ref >  Blue notes are notes that are played at a slightly different pitch from normal.  
 
 == History == 
 [[File:BennyGoodmanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benny Goodman]], one of the first swing [[big band]] leaders to become widely popular.]]  
 Jazz began in the United States in the early 20th century. Jazz music was first based on the music of African slaves who were forced to work in the plantations of the [[southern United States]]. This included [[call and response (music)|call and response]] songs, spirituals, [[chant]]s and blue notes. These characteristics are what developed [[blues]], a sad song that slaves sung during their labor. These influences were indirect, through earlier musical forms such as [[ragtime]].  
 
 Jazz also has musical styles from European music, as well as the brass and stringed instruments and (sometimes) the use of [[musical notation]]. 
 
 There have been different types of jazz through time. [[New Orleans]] jazz began in the early 1910s.  Dixieland jazz was also popular. In the 1930s, there was [[swing jazz]], which was also called big band jazz. In the 1940s, [[bebop]] became a major type of jazz, with fast songs and [[wikt:hard|complex]] [[harmony]]. 
 
 Large jazz bands, which are called [[big band]]s, were also popular in the 1940s. Big bands usually have 5 saxophone players, 4 or 5 trumpet players, 4 [[trombone]] players, a [[piano]] player or [[guitar]] player, an acoustic bass player, a drummer, and sometimes a singer.  
 
 In the 1950s, there was [[hard bop]] jazz. In the 1960s, there was [[modern jazz]] and [[free jazz]]. In the 1970s, [[jazz fusion]] began to blend jazz music with [[Rock and roll|rock]] music. Some jazz is still played with the same improv methods as it did at its beginning, except with modern [[Synthesizer|electronic instruments]].
