 '''Lobotomy''', also known as '''leucotomy''', is a type of [[brain]] [[surgery]]. It was created in 1935 by [[António Egas Moniz]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Neurology|neurologist]]. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1949  " for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses " . < ref > 
 {{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1949/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1949|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=The Nobel Foundation}} < /ref >  The operation cut the connections from the [[pre-frontal cortex]] (front part of the [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobes]]) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done. 
 
 He used the method for certain types of [[mental illness]] for which there was no other [[Therapy|treatment]]. He first used it on patients with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive behaviour]], which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression]].  
 
 The problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's [[personality]] and [[behaviour]]. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been [[Violence|violent]] became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities.  They often had very little 'drive' and [[wikt:motivation|motivation]]. 
 
 Today, [[antipsychotic]] [[drug]]s, like [[chlorpromazine]], may treat the [[Symptom|symptoms]] of such disorders. Lobotomies are not common today. 
 
 == Social context == 
 One question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique so widely accepted. It is generally agreed that [[Psychiatrist|psychiatrists]] wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric hospitals]] in the [[20th century|twentieth century]]. < ref > The number of patients in psychiatric hospitals was much greater then than now. < /ref >  Also, those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] doctors. < ref > Porter, Roy 1999. ''The greatest benefit to mankind: a medical history of humanity from antiquity to the present''. Fontana Press: p520 < /ref > 
 
 == Indications and outcomes == 
 According to the ''Psychiatric Dictionary'' in 1970: 
 [[File:Lobes of the brain NL.svg|thumb|right|250px|Lobes of the [[cerebrum]] ([[cerebral cortex]]): frontal lobes in blue]] 
 < blockquote > Good results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases, fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent. The [[mortality rate]] probably does not exceed 3 percent. Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose [[wikt:premorbid|premorbid]] personalities were 'normal', [[Cyclothymia|cyclothymic]], or [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive]]; in patients with superior [[intelligence]] and good education; in [[Psychosis|psychoses]] with sudden [[wikt:onset|onset]] and a clinical picture of [[wikt:affective|affective]] symptoms of depression or [[anxiety]], and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food, overactivity, and [[Delusion|delusional]] ideas of a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] nature. < ref name=Hin > Hinsie, Leland E. and Campbell, Robert Jean 1970. ''Psychiatric dictionary''. 4th ed, Oxford University Press. p438 < /ref >    < /blockquote > 
 
 According to the same source, prefrontal lobotomy reduces: 
 < blockquote > anxiety feelings and [[wikt:introspection|introspective]] activities; and feelings of [[wikt:inadequacy|inadequacy]] and self-consciousness are thereby lessened. Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with [[Hallucination|hallucinations]] and does away with the [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state. Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]], they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed. The less disorganized the personality of the patient, the more obvious are post-operative side effects. ... < ref name=Hin/ >   < /blockquote > 
 
 < blockquote > Convulsive [[Seizure|seizures]] are reported as [effects] of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti-convulsive drugs. Post-operative blunting of the personality, [[apathy]], and [[wikt:irresponsible|irresponsibility]] are the rule rather than the exception. Other side effects include [[wikt:distractibility|distractibility]], childishness, [[wikt:facetious|facetiousness]], lack of [[wikt:tact|tact]] or [[discipline]], and post-operative [[wikt:incontinence|incontinence]]. < ref name=Hin/ > < /blockquote >
