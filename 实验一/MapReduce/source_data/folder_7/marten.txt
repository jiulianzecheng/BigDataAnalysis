 The '''Martens''' are small [[mammal]]s in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Mustelidae]]. 
 They belong to the [[genus]] '''''Martes''''', with eight [[species]]. They live in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and are found in [[North America]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. 
 
 == Description == 
 Martens are [[carnivores]] which mainly hunt at night. They have thin bodies, long, bushy tails, short legs and pointed faces. Their fur is usually brown with pale chest. Martens live in [[forests]]. They have claws that retract, like cats, so they can easily climb trees. They live by themselves and do not like other martens living too close to them. They eat mostly small mammals like [[squirrel]]s, [[vole]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[rabbit]]s, but also fish, insects, eggs and sometimes fruits (mostly berries) when available.  
 
 They meet to mate in late spring or early summer and have a litter of up to five babies. Little martens, called 'kits', are born blind and naked in early spring, after long [[gestation]].
