 ==History== 
 
 Yatsuhashi comes from Yatsuhashi Kengyo, the pioneer of making Yatsuhashi. In the Edo era, he saved everything so he could make something from leftover rice. Then Yatsuhashi was created. After he died, Yatsuhashi was loved by people in Kyoto, and now it is a very famous food in Kyoto. < ref > {{cite web | url=http://www.yatsuhashi.co.jp/mind/yatsuhashi.html | title=Izutsu Yatsuhashi Honpo: history | author=Izutsu Yatsuhashi Honpo | accessdate=19 December 2010 | archive-date=2 December 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202065230/http://www.yatsuhashi.co.jp/mind/yatsuhashi.html | url-status=dead }} < /ref >
