 '''Mesonychids'''  < ref > " Middle [[claw]]s " < /ref >  were the first [[mammal]]ian [[carnivore]]s after the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaur]]s. 
 
 These  " wolves on hooves "  are an extinct order of [[carnivorous]] mammals, closely related to [[artiodactyl]]s. < ref > [[even-toed ungulate]]s and [[cetacean]]s ([[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s) < /ref > 
 
 Mesonychids first appeared in the early [[Palaeocene]] with the [[genus]] ''Dissacus''. They went in decline at the end of the [[Eocene]], and became extinct in the early [[Oligocene]]. 
 
 == Overview == 
 At the start of the Palaeocene, there were (so far as we know) no large [[carnivore]]s on land. The surviving mammals and birds [[evolution|evolved]] into many of the [[ecology|ecological]] [[niche]]s previously occupied by dinosaurs and [[pterosaur]]s. < ref > Benton M.J. 1997. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. 2nd ed, Chapman  &  Hall, London. The Palaeocene placental radiation, p327. < /ref >  This process is called [[adaptive radiation]]. The mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores. < ref name=Jehle > {{cite journal | author = Jehle, Martin | year = 2006 | title = Carnivores, creodonts and carnivorous ungulates: Mammals become predators | journal = Paleocene Mammals of the World (Online) | url = http://www.paleocene-mammals.de/predators.htm}} < /ref > 
 
 They soon had competition. By the later Palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores. The giant [[flightless bird]] ''[[Gastornis]]'' appeared in the Upper Palaeocene, and the [[Creodont]]s had also evolved. The Creodonts became an important [[Order (biology)|order]], and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids. 
 
 Most important of all, the modern order [[Carnivora]] became significant in the [[Eocene]]. They were a sister group to the mesonychids, and started as small forms in the Palaeocene. < ref name=Jehle/ >  Once they increased in size they would have been direct competitors of the mesonychids. 
 
 The broken-up [[Gondwana]] gave rise to southern continents which the early placental mammals could not get to. [[Africa]] and [[India]] eventually bumped into [[Eurasia]], and [[South America]] sometimes had land connection to [[North America]]. All this lead to '[[Invasive species|faunal interchange]]'. [[Australasia]] developed its own carnivores, which became extinct only in modern times. 
 
 == Size and habits == 
 Large size was common. The famous ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' had a [[skull]] a metre long, which is much larger than that of the modern [[Kodiak bear]]. 
 
 Mesonychid teeth consisted of [[molar]]s which were laterally compressed and often blunt and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones. Many species are suspected of being fish-eaters, and the largest species may have been [[scavenger]]s.
