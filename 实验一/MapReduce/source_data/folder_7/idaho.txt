 '''Idaho''' is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the northwestern [[United States]], and was the 43rd state to join the union. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/idaho-becomes-43rd-state|title=Idaho becomes 43rd state—Jul 03, 1890—HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=May 15, 2020|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68d4YZxDx?url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/idaho-becomes-43rd-state|archive-date=June 23, 2012|url-status=live}} < /ref > 
 
 Idaho became a state in 1890, and it is the 11th largest state in land area, and the 14th largest in total area (land and water). Despite this, the population of Idaho was only 1,839,106 in 2020, making it ranked the 38th largest state by population. 
 
 Idaho is bordered by [[Washington]] and Oregon on the west, [[Montana]] and Wyoming on the east, [[Utah]] and [[Nevada]] on the south and the country of [[Canada]] ([[British Columbia]]) on the north side. Idaho is known for its vast mountainous landscapes, and it is literally covered from north to south by the [[Rocky Mountains]]. < ref name= " :0 " > {{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/usstates/idland.htm|title=Geography of Idaho - World Atlas|website=worldatlas.com|access-date=May 15, 2020}} < /ref >  Idaho is also home to the massive [[Snake River]], which comes from the Grand Tetons in [[Wyoming]] and eventually flows to meld with the [[Columbia River]] in [[Washington]] state. < ref name= " :0 "  / >  This river dissects Hell's Canyon, the deepest gorge in America, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/hellscanyon/overview/index.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206120003/http://www.fs.fed.us/hellscanyon/overview/index.shtml|archivedate=2010-12-06|title=Hells Canyon Overview|date=December 6, 2010|access-date=May 15, 2020}} < /ref >  which lies the state's Oregon border, and flows through south central Idaho. This river provides a fertile plain which is the base for most of the state's agricultural industries, < ref name= " :0 "  / >   and the production of the potatoes for which Idaho is known. Idaho's state nickname is the  " Gem State " , despite also being known as the  " Spud State " , because of a man named George M. Willing who claimed it was derived from a [[Shoshoni language|Shoshone]] term. 
 
 Idaho's most prominent universities are [[Boise State University]] in its capital, [[Idaho State University]] in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], and the [[University of Idaho]] in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]]. 
 
 Idaho's state [[motto]] is ''Esto perpetua'', which is [[Latin]] for  " Let it be forever " .

 ==History of Idaho== 
 Idaho was formerly Idaho Territory, until July 27, 1890, when it became the 43rd state. In the 1930s, Idaho suffered a lot economically as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932, a bushel of potatoes was worth only ten cents compared to $1.51 in 1919, while Idaho farmers´  annual income of $686 in 1929 fell to just $250 by 1932. < ref > {{Cite book|title=A political dynasty in North Idaho, 1933-1967|last1=Doyle|first1=Randall|publisher=University Press|year=2004|page=7}} < /ref > 
 
 == Politics == 
 Today, Idaho is a very conservative state. In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election,]] just two counties in Idaho supported [[Hillary Clinton]]. Idaho as a whole last voted [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], and that by a narrow margin of less than 2 percent. Both of Idaho's senators ([[Jim Risch]] and [[Mike Crapo]]) are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].
