 ==History== 
 The start of the dynasty is connected with Shamsaddin Eldaniz of Kipchak origin. Thus, Eldaniz, who took Arran as an iqta by Sultan Masud, soon spread his power throughout Azerbaijan.  After his son Arslanshah also ruled in 1160, Eldaniz seized power in the Seljuk sultanate of Iraq. During the reign of Shamsaddin Eldaniz, the lands covered Arran, Azerbaijan, Shirvan, Cibal, Hamadan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Rey, Mosul, Kirman, Persia, Khuzistan, Akhlat, Erzurum and Maragha.ere a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] dynasty of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] < ref name= " Bosworth " / >  origin.

 The strengthening of the dynasty is connected with the period of Mohammad Jahan Pahlava.  After the death of Sultan Arslanshah in 1175, Jahan Pahlavan, who brought his 7-year-old son Togrul III to power, declared himself his ancestor and, like Shamsaddin Eldaniz, took de facto power. < ref > Antoine Constant.
