'''Cheminformatics''' (also known as '''chemoinformatics''' and '''chemical informatics''') is the study of [[large]] amounts of chemical information. It is done mostly with the help of [[computer]]s. These tools are used by [[drug|pharmaceutical]] companies to discovery new [[drug]]s. 
 
 Cheminformatics uses computer science and information [[technology]] to help solve [[chemistry]] problems. Cheminformatics deals with [[algorithm]]s, [[database]]s and [[information system]]s, [[World Wide Web|web technologies]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]], [[information theory|information]] and [[computation theory]], [[software engineering]], [[data mining]], [[image processing]], modeling and [[simulation]], [[signal processing]], [[discrete mathematics]], control and [[system theory]], [[circuit theory]], and [[statistics]], for generating new knowledge of chemistry. 
 
 == History == 
 The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown  < ref name= " Brown_1998 " > {{cite journal | author = F.K. Brown | title = Chapter 35. Chemoinformatics: What is it and How does it Impact Drug Discovery | journal = Annual Reports in Med. Chem. | year = 1998 | volume = 33 | pages = 375 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-7743(08)61100-8}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | author = Brown, Frank | title = Editorial Opinion: Chemoinformatics – a ten year update | journal = Current Opinion in Drug Discovery  &  Development| year = 2005 | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 296–302| pmid = 15892243 }} < /ref >  in 1998: 
 
 == Basics == 
 Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of [[chemistry]] and [[computer science]]. < ref name= " Gasteiger_2004 " > Gasteiger J.(Editor), Engel T.(Editor): ''Chemoinformatics : A Textbook''. John Wiley  &  Sons, 2004, {{ISBN|3-527-30681-1}} < /ref > < ref > A.R. Leach, V.J. Gillet: ''An Introduction to Chemoinformatics''.  Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|1-4020-1347-7}} < /ref > 
 Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for the [[paper]], [[pulp]] and [[dye]] industries. 
 
 == Uses == 
 ===Storage and retrieval=== 
 {{main|Chemical database}} 
 The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage of information relating to [[Chemical compound|compound]]s. The [[efficiency|efficient]] search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]]. 
 
 ==== File formats ==== 
 Computers represent chemical structures in specialized formats such as the [[XML]]-based [[Chemical Markup Language]] or [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]]. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and [[Docking (molecular)|docking]] studies. 
 
 === Virtual libraries === 
 Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules.  Virtual compounds may be used to explore [[chemical space]] and predict new  
 compounds with desired properties. 
 
 Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm. 
 < ref > {{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630–1642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 | last1=Kutchukian | first1=P. S. | last2=Lou | first2=D. | last3=Shakhnovich | first3=E. I. }} < /ref > 
 
 === Virtual screening === 
 Instead of testing the actual chemicals, virtual screening involves screening compounds by computer, to identify members likely to possess desired properties such as biological activity against a given target. 
 
 ===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) === 
 This is to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. These studies link cheminofrmatics to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant. They represent parts of chemical knowledge in computers.
