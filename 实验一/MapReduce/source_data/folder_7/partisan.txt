 A '''partisan''' is an armed fighter, who is not part of the regular troops of a [[country]] or state. The term comes from [[Italy|Italian]], where it meant member of a political party.  There is no separate legal status for partisans in [[international law]].  The law of war uses four criteria to legally define someone as a [[prisoner of war]], if the person is captured:

 # They carry their weapons openly 
 # They adhere to the customs and [[laws of war]], during their operation. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument & documentId=2F681B08868538C2C12563CD0051AA8D|title=3rd Geneva Convention, 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of war: Article 4: Prisoners of War}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument & documentId=CE8A59A191689791C12563CD00519F73|title=Geneva convention for the amelioration of the treatment of the wounded and the sick, 1949; Article 13: Protected persons}} < /ref >
