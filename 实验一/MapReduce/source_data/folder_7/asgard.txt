'''Asgard''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Ásgarðr'' - “Enclosure of the [[Æsir]]; Court of the Ás”) is one of the Nine Realms in [[Norse mythology]], home to the tribe of deities known as the [[Æsir]]. Asgard lies at the top of [[Yggdrasil|Yggdrasill’s]] highest branches, and the only thing connecting Asgard to Midgard is the mystical rainbow bridge [[Bifröst]].  
 
 At the center of Asgard lies the bountiful field of [[Iðavöllr]]; there the Æsir meet to feast, make revelry, and discuss important issues. The male gods meet in a hall called Glaðsheimr, the goddesses in the hall Vingólf. *According to the poem ''Grímnismál'' (as found in the Poetic Edda), Glaðsheimr is the field in which [[Valhalla]] was located.
