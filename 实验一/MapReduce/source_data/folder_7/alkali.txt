In [[chemistry]], an '''alkali''' is an aqueous (from water) solution with a [[pH]] value of more than 7. 
 The word 'Alkali' comes from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products (such as soaps) are made of alkali materials.   
 
 An alkali is where a [[Base (chemistry)|base]] is [[wikt:dissolve|dissolved]] in water. Often it is the [[salt]] of an [[Alkali metal]] < br / > 
 An alkali is the opposite to an [[acid]] and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid. 
 
 == Characteristics == 
 * It feels '''soapy'''  
 * It is '''[[corrosive]]''' (it can burn your skin away) 
 * The higher the number is over 7 on the pH scale the stronger the alkali is. 
 * Highly soluble (can be dissolved) in water 
 * They have a bitter taste 
 * Turns red [[litmus paper]] blue 
 * Can conduct electricity due to the presence of mobile [[ion]]s 
 * Is blue or purple on [[universal indicator]] 
 
 == Strength == 
 Like acids, alkalis can be weak or strong, depending on the nature and the concentration of the ionic salt composing it. The strength of an alkali can be found using [[universal indicator]]. Also like acids, the strength of an alkali is rated using the pH scale. 
 
 For example, [[soap]] and [[toothpaste]] contain weak alkalis, while cleaning products often contain strong ones.

 == Examples of common Alkalis == 
 * [[Sodium hydroxide]], NaOH 
 * [[Potassium hydroxide]], KOH 
 * [[Calcium hydroxide]], Ca(OH) < sub > 2 < /sub > 
 * [[Aqueous ammonia]], NH < sub > 3 < /sub >  (aq) 
 * [[Magnesium hydroxide]], Mg(OH) < sub > 2 < /sub > 
 
 == Uses of common Alkalis == 
 * [[Sodium hydroxide]] is used to make [[paper]], [[detergent]]s and [[soap]]. 
 * [[Potassium hydroxide]] is used by farmers to make [[acid]]ic soil more alkaline so that plants will grow better in it, and is also used as the [[electrolyte]] in alkaline, Ni-Cd, and Ni-MH [[Battery|batteries]]. 
 * [[Calcium hydroxide]] is used to neutralize acidic soil. 
 * [[Ammonium hydroxide]] is used as a cleaning agent. 
 
 == Oxides and Hydroxides == 
 Metal oxides and metal hydroxides are two types of base. When neutralised (an acid is added) they produce a salt and water. The type of salt produced depends on the acid and base.
