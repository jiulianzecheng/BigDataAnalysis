 '''Kartikeya''' ({{lang-ta|முருகன்}}), also known as '''Murugan''' or '''Kandhan''' is the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Deity|god]] of [[war]] and [[victory]]. Kartikeya is the main god worshipped in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and many other places of the world where [[Tamils]] live.
