 == History == 
 vWorker started in 2001 in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida. Ian Ippolito made it and first called it  " Rent A Coder " . Before this, Ian had made a website where people could share computer code. He wanted to make a new place where people could pay others to do computer work. 
 
 Ian wanted vWorker to be different. He added things to make sure people got paid right and work was done right. For example, there was a system to hold the money until the job was done. This way, workers knew they would get paid and companies knew they would get their work. There were also ways to solve problems between companies and workers. Plus, there was a system where people could rate each other so others knew if they were good to work with. These ideas were new and made Rent A Coder special when it started.
