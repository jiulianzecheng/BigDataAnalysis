[[File:KentStile.jpg|right|thumb|A wooden stile]] 
 A '''stile''' is a simple wooden structure which helps people to climb over a fence in the [[countryside]].  Where there is a footpath (a right of way) which goes through a field with animals, there may be a stile so that walkers can climb over out of the field.  The stile is there instead of a [[gate]].  If there were a gate and there were animals in the field, the animals could escape if the gate were left open.  Stiles are, of course, a problem for people who are [[disabled]]. 
 
 There are many stiles in the countryside in the [[United Kingdom]]. Another way of letting walkers through but keeping animals in is to use a [[kissing gate]].
