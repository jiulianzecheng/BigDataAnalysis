The '''Permian''' is a [[geology|geological]] [[Period (geology)|period]] which started about 299 million years ago (mya), and ended about 252 mya. It is the sixth and last period of the [[Paleozoic]] [[era]] and the sixth period in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eon]], and ended in the largest mass [[extinction]] known to science.

 == Climate == 
 The [[climate]] in the Permian was quite varied. At the start of the Permian, the [[Earth]] was still at the grip of an [[ice age]] from the [[Carboniferous]]. Glaciers receded in the mid-Permian period as the climate gradually warmed, drying the continent's interiors. < ref name= " palaeos.com " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Permian/Permian.htm |title=Palaeos Paleozoic: Permian: The Permian Period |access-date=2011-02-12 |archive-date=2007-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428232539/http://www.palaeos.com/Paleozoic/Permian/Permian.htm |url-status=dead }} < /ref >   In the late Permian period, the drying continued although the temperature cycled between warm and cool cycles. < ref name= " palaeos.com " / > 
 
 == Life == 
 During the Permian, [[tetrapod]] life, ([[amphibian]]s, [[Sauropsid]]s and [[Synapsid]]s) which evolved in the [[Carboniferous]], became widespread and diverse. The first modern trees ([[conifer]]s, [[ginkgo]]s and [[cycad]]s) appeared in the Permian. < ref > Levin, Harold L. 2005. ''The Earth through time''. 8th ed, Wiley, N.Y. Chapter 4: The fossil record. < /ref > 
 
 === Insects === 
 The Permian was also a period of [[adaptive radiation]] in [[insect]]s. [[Beetle]]s (Coleoptera) appeared; so did [[Fly|flies]] ([[Diptera]]). 22 out of a total of 36 known [[Order (biology)|orders]] of insects are known from the Permian. Some became extinct in the end-Permian event, but more radiation followed in the [[Mesozoic]]. Insects were probably, by the end of the Permian, the largest [[phylum]], < ref > or [[Class (biology)|class]], depending on how they are classified. < /ref >  in terms of number of [[species]]. < ref > Wooton R.J. 1990.

 Early relatives of [[cockroach]]es (Blattopterans) were the most common insects. < ref > Zimmerman E.C. 1948. ''Insects of Hawaii''. vol II, Univ. Hawaii Press < /ref >  and [[dragonflies]] ruled the air. True [[Odonata]] appeared in the Permian. < ref > Grzimek, Bernhard (ed) 1975. Grzimek's animal life encyclopedia, vol 22 ''Insects''.

 == Pangaea == 
 All the major land masses were collected together in the super-[[continent]] [[Pangaea]]. At the end of the period, the greatest [[basalt|flood basalt]] [[lava]] flows in the [[Phanerozoic]] raised world temperatures, and damaged the [[environment]]. These formed the extensive ''[[Siberia]]n traps''. The causes of the Permian/[[Triassic]] extinction event are not yet agreed between scientists. < ref > Erwin D.H. 1993. ''The great Palaeozoic crisis: life  &  death in the Permian''. Columbia, N.Y. < /ref >  [[Trilobite]]s, once a dominant life-form in the ocean, became extinct, together with 90% of all [[Ocean|marine]] species.
