 '''Pasargadae''' was a city in ancient [[Persia]], and is today a historical site in [[Fars]],[[Iran]]. Pasargadae was the first capital of the [[Persian Empire]]. The building of the capital city by [[Cyrus the Great]], began in 546 BCE, but was left unfinished, for Cyrus died in 530 BCE. Pasargadae remained the Persian capital until [[Darius I]] built [[Persepolis]]. The tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]] is located in this city. 
 
 Pasargadae is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].
