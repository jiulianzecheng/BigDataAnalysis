 There are many different ways to embezzle funds.  " Skimming off the top "  is when a person continually takes a small amount over a period of time. < ref name=Cornell > {{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/embezzlement |title=Embezzlement |publisher=Cornell Law School |access-date=10 December 2015}} < /ref >  Someone may [[wikt:disappear|disappear]] after taking a large amount of funds.

 The [[US]] [[Internal Revenue Service]] requires the reporting of all income when a person files their [[income tax]] forms. Failure to include embezzled funds in their gross income can bring charges of [[tax evasion]] by the IRS. This is in addition to any other [[jurisdiction]]s criminal charges of embezzlement. < ref name=Cornell/ >
