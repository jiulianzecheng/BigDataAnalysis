 '''Iguanas''' are a type of [[lizard]] in the genus '''''Iguana''''' that lives in [[tropics|tropical]] areas of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. There are only two [[species]] of iguana, the [[green iguana]] and the [[Lesser Antillean Iguana|Lesser Antillean iguana]]. 
 
 == Appearance == 
 The two species of lizard both have a [[dewlap]], a row of spines running down their back to their tail, and a third eye on their head. This eye is known as the [[parietal eye]], which looks just like a pale scale on the top of their head. Behind their neck are small scales which look like spikes, and are called [[tuberculate]] scales. They also have a large round scale on their cheek called a [[subtympanic]] shield.  
 
 == Senses == 
 Iguanas have excellent vision and can see long distances, shapes, shadows, color and movement. An iguana uses its eyes to navigate through trees and forests, as well as for finding food. They also use their eyes to communicate with members of the same species. An iguana's ear is called a [[tympanum]]. It is the iguana's ear drum and is found right above the subtympanic shield and behind the eye. This is a very thin, delicate part of the iguana, and is very important to its hearing.
