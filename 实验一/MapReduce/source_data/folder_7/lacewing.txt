 '''Lacewings''', or 'Green lacewings', are [[insect]]s in the large [[family (biology)|family]] '''Chrysopidae''' of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Neuroptera]]. There are about 85 [[genera]] and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 [[species]] in this widespread group. However, in America and [[Europe]], the two genera ''[[Chrysopa]]'' and ''[[Chrysoperla]]'' are very common. < ref name = Engel2007 > Engel, Michael S.  &  Grimaldi, David A. 2007.

 Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active [[predator]]s, and are often used for [[biological control]]. < ref > New T.R. 2002. Prospects for extending the use of Australian lacewings in biological control. ''Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' '''48'''(Supplement 2): 209–216.

 Many adults of ''Chrysopa'' can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their [[thorax]]. < ref name=Eisner > Eisner, Thomas  &  Maria and Siegler, Melody 2005. ''Secret weapons: defenses of insects, spiders, scorpions, and other many-legged creatures''. Harvard University, Belknap Press. < /ref > 
 
 They have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear [[bat]] [[echolocation]] sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape [[spider web]]s, because, being so light, they  do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky [[spider silk]] from touching the wings' surface. < ref name=Eisner/ >   
 
 The [[larvae]] are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones ([[aphid]]s, [[caterpillar]]s and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their [[maxilla]]e < ref > Appendages either side of the mouth. < /ref >  are [[wikt:hollow|hollow]], and inject a [[Digestion|digestive]] [[secretion]] into the [[prey]]. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.
