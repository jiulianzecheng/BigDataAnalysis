 '''Potsdam''' ([[Sorbian languages|Low Sorbian]]: ''Podstupim'') is a small [[Germany|German]] city which is right next to [[Berlin]]. In fact it touches the border of Berlin, and is about 26 & nbsp;km southwest of Berlin's centre. It is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Brandenburg]]. Potsdam has a small population: about 176,000 people lived in this city in 2017.  
 
 On the other hand, it is the largest [[World Heritage site]] in Germany. Potsdam was a residence of the [[Prussia]]n kings and the [[German Emperor|German Kaiser]] until 1918. It was planned in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] with a careful balance of [[architecture]] and [[landscape]]. Potsdam was intended as  " a picturesque, pastoral dream "  which would remind its people of their relationship with nature and reason. < ref > ''The Potsdam project, 1996'', HRH The Prince of Wales, Charles; Hanson, Brian; Steil, Lucien; Prince of Wales's Urban Design Task Force; Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, 1998, Introduction. < /ref >   
 
 Around the city there are a series of lakes and cultural landmarks. The parks and palaces of [[Sanssouci]] are the centre of the  World Heritage Site. The [[Soviet Union]] did not return many of the Potsdam art treasures, and they remain to this day in [[Russia]]. The library of [[Frederick the Great]] was returned, but only 36 oil paintings. 
 
 The [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945 was held at the palace [[Cecilienhof]].
