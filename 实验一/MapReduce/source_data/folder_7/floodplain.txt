 A '''floodplain''' is the flat area around a river that is covered in times of flood.  A floodplain is a very fertile area due to the rich alluvium (fine sediment) deposited by floodwaters. This makes floodplains a good place for agriculture. A build-up of alluvium on the banks of a river can create [[levee]]s, which raise the riverbank.
