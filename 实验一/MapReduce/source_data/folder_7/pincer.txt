 '''Pincers''' are a [[hand tool]] used in many situations where a [[mechanical advantage]] is required. They are used to pinch, [[cutting|cut]] or pull an object. < ref > ''Use and care of handtools and measuring tools'' (Washington, DC: Department of the Army, 1960), p. 178 < /ref >  Pincers are first-class [[lever]]s. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/l/e/lever/source.html#.VYyg1PlViko |title=Lever |publisher=Dirac Delta Consultants Ltd. |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-date=14 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114204336/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/l/e/lever/source.html#.VYyg1PlViko |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Pincers differ from pliers in that the concentration of force is either to a point, or to an edge at a [[right angle]] to the [[Handle (grip)|handle]] of the tool. This allows pincers to be brought close to a surface. This is often helpful when removing [[nail]]s from [[wood]]. Pincers are often called '''end-nippers''' or '''end-cutters.''' Carpenter's pincers are very well suited to these tasks. Pincers are primarily used for removing objects out of a material.  
 
 Pincers, often red-hot, have been used as an instrument of [[torture]] < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/medici/medici/murder.html |title=Medieval Murder |publisher=Devillier Donegan Enterprises |access-date=26 June 2015}} < /ref >  since the [[middle age]]s or earlier. 
 
 [[Pliers]] are a similar tool with a different type of head used for squeezing, rather than cutting and pulling.
