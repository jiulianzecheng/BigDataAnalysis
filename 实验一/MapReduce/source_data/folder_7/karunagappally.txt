 ==Economy== 
 Karungappally used to be an agrarian economy until the late 19th century with [[coconut]], [[banana]], [[tapioca]] and [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]] as the main crops grown. With rapid urbanization and the consequent pressure on land, the reliance on agriculture has dwindled.  
 Fishing forms the major source of livelihood for the coast dwellers. The area also receives substantial foreign remittances from the large number of people from here working in the Gulf countries. Now Kerala's many prominent business centres had their branches here.
