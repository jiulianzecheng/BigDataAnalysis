[[File:Female and Male Urethra.jpg|thumb|Female urethra and male urethra]] 
 
 The '''urethra''' is a [[tube]] that connects the [[bladder]] to the outside of the body. All [[Mammal|mammals]] have it. It allows the removal of [[urine]] from the [[body]]. There is a muscle (the ''urethral sphincter'') which controls [[urinating|urination]]. 
 
 In [[male]] mammals, the urethra is also a part of the [[reproductive system]], because males use it as a tube for [[sperm]] during [[sex]]. 
 
 == Human anatomy == 
 [[File:Anatomytool Male and female urinary tract English.jpg|thumb|Human male and female urinary bladders and urethras]] 
 In human [[anatomy]], men have longer urethras than women. This means that women have bladder [[infection]]s more often because their bladders are closer to the outside. Because the male urethra is longer and is not straight, [[wikt:insert|inserting]] a [[catheter]] (tube to help urination) is more difficult in men.

 In women, the urethra is 3-4 cm (1.5 in) long. It's opening to the outside of the body is part of the [[vulva]] (the area between a woman's legs). The female urethra is between the [[clitoris]] and the opening to the [[vagina]]. Men's urethra goes through their penis, but in women, it is not in the clitoris.

 In men, the urethra is about 20 cm (8 in) long and its opening to the outside of the body is at the end of the [[penis]]. 
 The male urethra has three sections: 
 *The ''prostatic'' urethra crosses the [[prostate gland]]. The [[vas deferens]] also opens into the urethra in this section. 
 *The ''membranous'' urethra is a short section that goes through the urethral sphincter. It is 1 or 2 cm long and is the [[wikt:narrow|narrowest]] (least wide) part of the urethra. 
 *The ''spongy'' or ''penile'' urethra goes through the penis on its lower side. This section is 15-16 cm (6 in) long and goes through the [[corpus spongiosum]]. 
 
 == Medical problems == 
 * [[Urethritis]] is an infection of the urethra. It often causes pain when urinating. 
 * [[kidney stone|Kidney stones]] that go through the urethra can cause a lot of pain. 
 
 == Medical procedures == 
 *To send a tube up the urethra to help drain urine is a common type of [[catheter]]ization. 
 *To send a tube up the urethra to see the inside of the bladder is called [[cystoscopy]].
