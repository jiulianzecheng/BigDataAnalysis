 '''Tetrachloroethylene''' is a pleasant-smelling colourless liquid that is used for [[dry-cleaning]]. It is also known as '''perchloroethylene''' and '''perc''' for short. It has the [[chemical formula]] {{chem2|C2Cl4}} and it is composed of carbon and twice the chlorine. It was first made in 1839 in France. < ref > V.

 ==Properties== 
 Perchloroethylene is a colourless liquid at room temperature. It has a mild, sweet odour that most people can smell even in small amounts. It is much heavier than water and it does not mix with water, because Perc is nonpolar while water is polar. It can mix with many other [[solvents]]. Perc boils at 121 degrees Celsius and freezes at –22 degrees Celsius.

 Its molecule is very similar to [[ethylene]] but with chlorines instead of hydrogens in ethylene.

 Perc has been used in dry cleaning since the 1930s. It was introduced as a safe alternative to [[carbon tetrachloride]] (extremely poisonous to the liver) and flammable [[solvent]]s like [[gasoline]].  
 
 Years ago, dry cleaners used to throw away dirty perc after a few uses. The modern dry cleaning machines have mechanism to [[distillation|distill]] (boiling and condensing again) the perc for re-use. 
 
 Perchloroethylene was previously used as a parasite medication for animals. 
 
 ==Dangers== 
 Perc has low toxicity but people who inhale it for a long time can become [[unconscious]]. Perc's ability to remove oils is very strong and can hurt the skin. It is not [[inflammable]] or [[explosive]].
