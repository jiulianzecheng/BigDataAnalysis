 The '''Pelecaniformes''' is a [[Order (biology)|order]] of medium-sized and large [[waterfowl|waterbirds]]. They are found worldwide. As traditionally—but wrongly—defined, they include all [[bird]]s that have feet with four toes which are all webbed. 
 Most have a bare throat patch ([[gular patch]]). Their [[nostril]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] into slits which do not work properly. This causes them to breathe through their mouths. They feed on [[fish]], [[squid]] or similar [[Marine biology|marine]] life. The young are [[altricial]]. They hatch from the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] helpless and naked in most cases. They lack a [[brood patch]].
