 '''''Scelidosaurus''''' was an early type of herbivorous dinosaur. It was a [[thyreophora]]n, a lightly plated, herbivorous [[dinosaur]] about 4 metres long. It lived during the early  [[Jurassic]], 196 to 183 million years ago. Its fossils were found in Charmouth, [[Dorset]], [[England]]. < ref > ''BBC'' Family  &  Education. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55056004] < /ref >   
 
 ''Scelidosaurus'' has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. < ref name= " Norman " > Norman, David 2001. ''Scelidosaurus'', the earliest complete dinosaur. In ''The armored dinosaurs'', pp 3-24. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0253339642}} < /ref >   
 
 It is one of the earliest and most [[basal]] of the armoured dinosaurs. A review by Serano had ''Scelidosaurus'' as the sister group (closest relative) to both the [[Stegosauria]] and [[Ankylosauria]]. < ref > Serano P.C. 1986. Phylogeny of the bird-hipped dinosaurs (Order Ornithischia). ''National Geographic Research'' '''2''', 234–256. < /ref > 
 
 This genus lived on the [[supercontinent]] [[Laurasia]].  
 Its  length was about 4 & nbsp;metres (13 & nbsp;ft). < ref name= " Lambert " > Lambert D 1993. ''The ultimate dinosaur book''. Dorling Kindersley, New York, p110-113. {{ISBN|1-56458-304-X}} < /ref >  ''Scelidosaurus'' was [[quadruped]]al, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It ''may'' have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet. This suggests a mostly quadrupedal posture. 
 
 ''Scelidosaurus'' and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous. Other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material, but ''Scelidosaurus'' had smaller, less complex teeth. Its jaw could only do simple up-and-down movements. < ref name = " Lambert " / >  In this aspect, they resembled the [[stegosauridae|stegosaurids]], which also had primitive teeth and simple jaws. < ref name = " dinosauria04 " > {{cite book|title=The Dinosauria (2nd Edition |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosauriandedit00weis |year=2004|chapter=Stegosauria|editor=Weishampel DB, Dodson P, Osmólska H |author=Galton PM, Upchurch P|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24209-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/dinosauriandedit00weis/page/361 361]}} < /ref >  Also, like stegosaurs, they may have swallowed [[gastrolith]]s to aid processing of food (because of the lack of chewing ability). This is also done by modern birds and crocodiles. < ref > [http://web.me.com/dinoruss/de_4/5c52ddb.htm Stegosaurs] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120629043313/http://web.me.com/dinoruss/de_4/5c52ddb.htm |date=2012-06-29 }} Jacobson RJ. Dinosaur and vertebrate paleontology information. Retrieved 2007-02-11. < /ref >  The diet of ''Scelidosaurus'' was low-lying plants like [[Fern|ferns]] and [[cycads]]. < ref name= " Lambert " / >  [[Seaweed]] has also been suggested as a food. [[Grass]] did not evolve until the [[Cretaceous]] period.
