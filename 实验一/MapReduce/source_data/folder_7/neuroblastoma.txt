 '''Neuroblastoma''' is a kind of [[cancer]] that usually occurs in [[children]] and [[infant]]s. This kind of cancer mostly affects the [[Autonomic nervous system]]. The cancer creates [[tumor]]s, but the [[cells]] or pieces of the tumors do not fully finish growing. There are about 650 cases per year in the United States. < ref name= " titleeMedicine - Neuroblastoma : Article by Norman J Lacayo, MD " > {{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1570.htm |title=eMedicine - Neuroblastoma : Article by Norman J Lacayo, MD |accessdate=2008-07-30 }} < /ref >  About half of these cases occur in children younger than two years old. < ref > Janet Sassi, [http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/public_affairs/inside_fordham/february_16_2007/in_focus_faculty_and/cellular_communicati_24950.asp  " Cellular Communication: Unraveling the Secrets of Histone Proteins " ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527203807/http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/public_affairs/inside_fordham/february_16_2007/in_focus_faculty_and/cellular_communicati_24950.asp |date=2008-05-27 }}, Fordham University, February 16, 2007 < /ref >  The tumors can grow from any  [[neural crest]] element of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Most of the time, it comes from one of the [[adrenal gland]]s. It can also start growing in nerve tissues in the [[neck]], [[chest]], [[abdomen]], or [[pelvis]]. 
 
 Neuroblastoma is one of the few [[malignant]] types of cancer that sometimes goes away on its own, for no obvious reason. < ref name= " pmid19383347 " > {{cite journal |author=Bénard J, Raguénez G, Kauffmann A | display-authors = etal |title=MYCN-non-amplified metastatic neuroblastoma with good prognosis and spontaneous regression: a molecular portrait of stage 4S |journal=Mol Oncol |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=261–71 |date=October 2008  |pmid=19383347 |doi=10.1016/j.molonc.2008.07.002 | pmc = 5527812 }} < /ref >   
 
 == Types and forms == 
 The illness can have many different forms. There are three risk categories (types): low, intermediate (medium), and high risk. Low-risk disease is most common in infants, who usually get better, though they may need to have [[surgery]]. High-risk disease is very difficult for doctors to make better. < ref name= " urlScienceDirect - The Lancet : Neuroblastoma " > {{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL & _udi=B6T1B-4P19T0K-14 & _user=10 & _rdoc=1 & _fmt= & _orig=search & _sort=d & view=c & _acct=C000050221 & _version=1 & _urlVersion=0 & _userid=10 & md5=8b1a8aa32e88d159f001c87d291a91f0 |title=ScienceDirect - The Lancet : Neuroblastoma |format= |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=August 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > 
 
 [[Esthesioneuroblastoma]], which is also called  " olfactory neuroblastoma " , comes from the [[olfactory epithelium]] and doctors are still not sure what type of cancer it is. It is not a cancer of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and is not the same thing as neuroblastoma. < ref name= " titleeMedicine - Esthesioneuroblastoma : Article by Pavel Dulguerov, MD " > {{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic748.htm |title=eMedicine - Esthesioneuroblastoma : Article by Pavel Dulguerov, MD |accessdate=2008-07-30 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last = Cheung| first = Nai-Kong| authorlink =| title = Neuroblastoma| url = https://archive.org/details/neuroblastoma0000unse_h3n5| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = p. 73| year = 2005| doi = | isbn = 3-540-40841-X }} < /ref >
