'''Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency''' (sometimes also called '''G6PD deficiency''', or '''favism''') is a [[hereditary]] [[disease]]. This means it is passed on through the [[gene]]s from a parent to the [[child]]. It leads to a form of [[anaemia]]. There are some means to treat it, though the focus of the doctors now lies on [[prevention]] (avoiding parents passing it on to their child). As it is linked to the [[X chromosome]], most people who suffer from it are [[male]].  
 
 Sufferers can not make the [[enzyme]] [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]]. This will mean the circulation of [[sugar]] in their body is different. More [[red blood cell]]s will be destroyed because of it. About 400 million people suffer from this condition. Very often, it can be found in regions where there is also [[malaria]]. This is because the red blood cells found in people with favism are not targeted by malaria. 
 
 This condition may result from an allergy to alkaloids in Vicia faba (Faba Bean, Broad bean, Windsor bean).
