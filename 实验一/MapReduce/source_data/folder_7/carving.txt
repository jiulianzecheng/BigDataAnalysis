 '''Carving''' is the act of using [[tool]]s to shape  a material by scraping away portions of that material. It can be done on any material solid enough to hold a shape, yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with tools.  
 
 Examples of material with potential for carving:  
 # [[Wood]] 
 # [[Stone]] 
 # [[Brick]] 
 # [[Plaster]] (when dry; but usually [[moulding|moulded]] when moist) 
 # [[Bone]] 
 
 Carving is different from methods using soft and malleable materials like [[clay]] and melted [[glass]].  Carving needs more work. < ref > Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz 1953. ''Children are artists: an introduction to children's art for teachers and parents'', p. 136. < /ref >
