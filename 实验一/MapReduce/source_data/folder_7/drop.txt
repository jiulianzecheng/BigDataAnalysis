 A '''drop''' is a small bit of [[liquid]], such as [[water]], which is held together by [[surface tension]]. 
 It is normally thought of as falling. 
 Something that is dropping can sometimes be called [[wikt:drip|dripping]]. 
 Drops are often [[circle|circular]] in shape, < ref > English Wikipedia < /ref >  and sometimes when [[light]] is [[refraction|refracted]] through them, it makes a [[rainbow]] effect. [[Rain]] is an example of when drops fall. Drops are also like [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], except they hold [[liquid]] instead of a [[gas]], like [[air]].
