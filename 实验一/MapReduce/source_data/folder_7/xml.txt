 The '''Extensible Markup Language''' (short XML) is a [[markup language]] like [[HTML]] but is [[extensible]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-08-20|title=What is an XML-File? {{!}} Data Basecamp|url=https://databasecamp.de/en/data/xml-file|access-date=2022-09-25|language=en-US}} < /ref >  It's created by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C). XML defines rules for the construction of a document. XML adds context to the information in a document. It does not say how this should be displayed. 
 
 Some programs get information out of an XML-document. To do that, they need an [[API]]. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2022-07-23|title=What is an API? Easily explained! {{!}} Data Basecamp|url=https://databasecamp.de/en/data/api-en|access-date=2022-08-11|language=en-US}} < /ref >   There are many APIs for XML. 
 
 You can write a description of an XML document in a way that is useful for programmers. There are several languages for this; the best known is called [[DTD]]. 
 
 == Syntax == 
 XML uses less than ( < ) and greater than ( > ) to show tags. For example, a paragraph in [[HTML]] would be  < code > & lt;p & gt; < /code > . 
 
 A closing tag is a tag used to enclose the [[value]] of the tag. The tag has a slash (/) before its name. For example,  < code > & lt;/p & gt; < /code > 
 
 A tag which is empty can be represented as an opening tag but with a slash before the  < code > & gt; < /code > . For example,  < code > & lt;p/ & gt; < /code > 
 
 The XML specification defines a [[XML validation|valid XML document]] as a [[well-formed XML document]] which also conforms to the rules of a [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD). < ref > {{cite web|url=https://xmlnotepad.codeplex.com/|title=XML Notepad|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115122856/http://xmlnotepad.codeplex.com/|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://aristeksystems.com/blog/elearning-standards-2022/#qti|title=XML Notepad 2007|access-date=16 November 2017}} < /ref >
