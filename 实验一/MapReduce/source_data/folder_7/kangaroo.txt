 A '''kangaroo'''  is an [[Australasia|Australia]]n [[marsupial]]. It belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Macropus]]''. The common name 'kangaroo' is used for the four large species, and there are another 50 species of smaller macropods. The kangaroos are common in [[Australia]] and can also be found in [[New Guinea]]. Kangaroos move by [[Jumping|hopping]]. 
 
 == Common names == 
 *kangaroos: large males are 2 metres tall (6ft 7 inches) and weigh 90 kg (200 lb). 
 *[[wallaroo]]s: between kangaroos and wallabies in size. 
 *[[Wallaby|wallabies]]: small to medium-sized macropods. 
 *tree-kangaroos: ''Dendrolagus'', adapted for [[arboreal]] locomotion. They live in the tropical [[rainforests]] of [[New Guinea]], far northeastern [[Queensland]], and some of the islands in the region. 
 
 == The four species == 
 [[File:Kangur.rudy.drs.jpg|thumb|[[Red kangaroo]] grazing]] 
 There are four living species of kangaroos: 
 
 * The [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') is the largest marsupial anywhere in the world. The red kangaroo lives in the [[arid]] and semi-arid centre of Australia. A large male can be two metres (6 & nbsp;ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 & nbsp;kg (200 & nbsp;lb).  
 * The [[eastern grey kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'') is less well-known than the red (outside of Australia), but the most often seen, as its range covers the fertile eastern part of the continent.  
 * The [[western grey kangaroo]] (''Macropus fuliginosus'') is slightly smaller again at about 54 & nbsp;kg (119 & nbsp;lb) for a large male. It is found in the south part of [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]] near the coast, and the [[Darling River]] basin.  
 * The [[antilopine kangaroo]] (''Macropus antilopinus'') is similar to the Eastern and Western greys. Like them, it lives on the grassy plains and woodlands. It lives in large groups. 
 
 There are also about 50 other smaller macropods in 10 genera in the Macropodidae family. 
 
 === Evolution === 
 The evolutionary ancestors of marsupials split from placental mammals during the [[Jurassic period]] about 160 million years ago (mya). < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Luo|first1=Z.

It was found in [[South Australia]]. Unfortunately, the fossil could not be identified any further than the family. A [[Queensland]] fossil of a species similar to ''[[Hadronomas]]'' has been dated at 5.33 to 11.61 mya, in the late [[Miocene]] or early [[Pliocene]]. 
 
 ==Background== 
 Kangaroos hop to move around quickly, and walk on two or four legs while moving slowly. They cannot walk in any direction and cannot hop backwards. < ref > {{Cite web

 }} < /ref >  They can hop or jump as far as about three times their own height. They can also swim if necessary. The kangaroo is a [[herbivore]], eating mainly grass, but some species also eat shrubs. A female Kangaroo has three [[vagina]]s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/04/17/kangaroos-have-three-vaginas/#.VienHn6rTGh|title=Kangaroos have three vaginas|first=Ed|last=Yong|date=2012|publisher=Discover Magazine|work=discovermagazine.com|access-date=October 22, 2015|archive-date=October 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028134954/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/04/17/kangaroos-have-three-vaginas/#.VienHn6rTGh|url-status=dead}} < /ref > 
 
 Kangaroos are marsupials: they carry their young in a special pouch on their bodies. Baby kangaroos are called joeys. Kangaroos live in large groups, called mobs. < ref name=derm > {{cite web |url=http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/wildlife-ecosystems/wildlife/living_with_wildlife/kangaroos.html |title=Kangaroos (Department of Environment and Resource Management) |work=derm.qld.gov.au |year=2011 |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-date=2009-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110144951/http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/wildlife-ecosystems/wildlife/living_with_wildlife/kangaroos.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  Each group is made up of breeding females, their young and several adult males. One of the males is the dominant male, he is the only one that breeds with the females in the mob. < ref name=derm/ > 
 
 Because they are mostly found in [[Australia]], Australians see it as a [[national symbols|national symbol]]. The kangaroo is featured holding the Australian [[coat of arms]]. The Australian airline, [[Qantas]], uses the kangaroo as its emblem. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) also a has a kangaroo emblem. 
 
 Kangaroos can be dangerous because of their powerful legs. They can lean back on their tails to deliver powerful kicks. In 2009, a man went to save his dog which had chased a kangaroo into a farm dam. The kangaroo was able to hold the dog underwater nearly drowning it. The kangaroo gave the man several big kicks before he was able to grab his dog and escape from the dam. He needed hospital treatment for his injuries. < ref > {{cite news|title=Rogue roo a fearful combatant in dam attack|last=Millar|first=Paul|date=November 24, 2009|publisher=The Age|pages=3|language=en}} < /ref > 
 
 ==The name== 
 The word ''kangaroo'' is an [[Indigenous Australian|Australian Aboriginal]] word from the Guugu Yimidhirr people of north [[Queensland]]. The word was recorded by Captain [[James Cook]] in August 1770. < ref > {{Cite web

 }} < /ref >  It was the name for the grey kangaroo, [[Macropus robustus]]. < ref name=anu > {{cite web |url= http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/res/aus_words/vocab_aussie/borrowings.php |title=ANU - Australian National Dictionary Centre - ANDC |work=anu.edu.au |year=2011}} < /ref >  Cook's ship, the ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', had been damaged on [[coral]] on the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. It took seven weeks for the ship to be repaired on the banks of a river, now the [[Endeavour River]], at the site of the town of [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]]. This gave Cook, Joseph Banks and other crew members time to explore the area and the plants and animals. The skin and [[skull]] of a kangaroo was taken back to England to be put on show. In [[James Boswell]]'s book  " Life of Johnson "  he describes Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1793 hopping around the room to explain to people how a kangaroo moved. When [[Arthur Phillip]] and the [[First Fleet]] arrived in [[Sydney]] in 1788, they were surprised that the Aborigines did not know the word  " kangaroo. "  It took them a while to realize that Aborigines at Sydney spoke a different language to those from Cooktown. < ref name=anu/ > 
 
 == Extinct family == 
 There was a now-[[extinct]] [[Family (biology)|family]] of giant kangaroos, the Sthenurinae. < ref > Webb, Jonathan 2014. Giant kangaroos 'walked on two feet'. ''BBC News'' Science  &  Environment. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29603578] < /ref >  They were adapted for [[browser|browsing]] in [[woodland]] areas, rather than open [[grassland]]. The largest (''Procoptodon goliah'') had an estimated body mass of 240 kg., which is almost three times the weight of the largest living kangaroos. Probably they moved at slower speeds, since hopping was not possible. They would have moved by striding (walking). < ref > Janis C.M; Buttrill K  &  Figueirido B. 2014. Locomotion in extinct giant kangaroos: were Sthenurines hop-less monsters? PLoS ONE. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109888 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0109888]  < /ref >  The family went extinct about 30,000 years ago. 
 
 == New Guinea == 
 New Guinea is the large island close to Australia. It has been divided into Papua New Guinea (Australian administration), and  Papua and West Irian (Indonesian province). Because the island was once closer to Australia, they have many related animals and plants in common. They have kangaroos, and a fossil of a giant kangaroo has been found on New Guinea at Nombe rock shelter. It has been named ''Nombe nombe''. < ref > Macdonald, Karl 10.6.2022. Newspaper report:  " Fossil of giant kangaroo ancestor discovered in Papua New Guinea " .  " I "  newspaper 10.6.22. < /ref >
