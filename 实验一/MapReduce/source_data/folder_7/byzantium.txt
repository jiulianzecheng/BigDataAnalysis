{{distinguish|Byzantine Empire}} 
 
 '''Byzantium''' ({{lang-el|Βυζάντιον}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city. The name  " Byzantium "  is a [[Latinization]] of the original name '''Byzantion'''. 
 
 The city became the center of the [[Byzantine Empire]], (the Greek-speaking [[Roman Empire]] of late Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]]), but at that time it was already called [[Constantinople]]. < ref > After the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], the city became known as [[Istanbul]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]], but that did not become the official name of the city until 1930. < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 ===Legend=== 
 The origins of Byzantium are not clear. There is only a [[legend]]. It tells that a certain Byzas from Megara (a town near [[Athens]]), founded Byzantium, when he sailed northeast across the [[Aegean Sea]]. He had asked the [[Oracle at Delphi]] where he should found his new city. The Oracle told him to find it  " opposite the blind. "  At the time, he did not know what this meant. But when he came upon the [[Bosporus]] he realized what it meant: on the Asiatic shore was a Greek city, [[Chalcedon]]. It was they who must have been blind because they had not seen that obviously superior land was just a half mile away on the other side of the Bosporus. Byzas founded his city here in this  " superior "  land and named it Byzantion after himself. 
 
 ===History before Constantine I=== 
 Byzantion was mainly a trading city due to its strategic location at the [[Black Sea]]'s only entrance. Byzantion later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus. 
 
 When it fought with [[Pescennius Niger]] against the victorious [[Septimius Severus]], the city was [[wikt:besiege|besieged]] by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD. Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus, when he had become [[emperor]], and quickly regained its earlier prosperity. 
 
 ===Center of the Eastern Roman Empire=== 
 When [[Constantine I (emperor)|Roman Emperor Constantine I]] decided to move his capital to the Eastern part of the [[Roman Empire]] he chose the place of Byzantion because of its strategical value. He refounded it, in 330 AD, as ''Nova Roma''.  After his death the city was called [[Constantinople]] ('city of Constantine'). It remained the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which was later called the [[Byzantine Empire]] by historians. 
 
 ==Emblem== 
 Following the legend the [[citizen]]s of Byzantium claimed the crescent moon as their state symbol, after an important victory in 340 BC.  However, the origin of the [[crescent and star]] as a symbol dates back much earlier - to ancient Babylon and ancient Egypt. < ref > Charles Morris (1889), ''Aryan Sun Myths: The Origin of Religions''. [hhttps://books.google.com/books?id=iEnXAAAAMAAJ & pg=PA67  Page 67] < /ref > < ref > Rupert Gleadow (2001), ''The Origin of the Zodiac'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qGJcsrkPTToC & dq=origin+of+crescent+star & pg=PA165 Page 165] < /ref >  But Byzantium was the first city that used the crescent moon as its symbol. In 330 AD Constantine I added the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]'s star to the flag. < ref > The crescent moon and star was not completely abandoned by the Christian world after the fall of Constantinople. The official flag of the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] is a [[labarum]] of white, a church building with two towers, and on either side of the arms, at the top, are the outline in black of a crescent moon facing center and a star with rays.
