 The name '''kestrel''' is given to several different members of the [[falcon]] genus, ''Falco''. Kestrels [[wikt:hover|hover]] about {{convert|10|–|20|m|ft|round=5}} over open country, and swoop down on prey, usually small [[mammals]], [[lizards]] or large [[insects]]. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the wing. In addition, kestrels have much brown in their [[plumage]]. 
 
 Kestrels can fly in stationary air, even indoors in [[barn]]s. While hovering they face towards any slight headwind. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/23540/ |title=The hovering Of The kestrel - an essay by Richard Jefferies |access-date=2015-01-15 |archive-date=2015-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417175151/http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/23540/ |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This leads to the [[common kestrel]] being called a  " windhover "  in some areas. 
 
 Unusually for falcons, plumage often differs between male and female, although as usual with [[monogamous]] [[Bird of prey|raptors]] the female is slightly larger than the male. This allows a pair to eat slightly different prey on their home range. Kestrels are bold, and have adapted well to humans. They nest in buildings and hunt by main roads. Kestrels do not build their own nests, but use nests built by other birds. 
 
 Most kestrels form a distinct [[clade]] among the falcons, as suggested by comparison of [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data  < ref name= " Groombridge et al " > {{cite journal|last=Groombridge, Jim J. ''et al'' 2002. |title=A molecular phylogeny of African kestrels with reference to divergence across the Indian Ocean. |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |year=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=267–277 |doi=10.1016/S1055-7903(02)00254-3|pmid=12414309}} < /ref >  and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. This clade diverged from other ''Falco'' around the [[Miocene]] to [[Pliocene]] about 7–3.5 million years ago (mya). The most [[basal]]  " true "  kestrels are three species from [[Africa]] and its surroundings.

 About 2.5–2 mya, the main lineage of true kestrels emerged. This too seems to have [[evolved]] in Africa and subsequently spread across the [[Old World]] until they reached [[Australia]] some time during the Middle [[Pleistocene]], less than one million years ago. This group contains several [[taxa]] found on [[Indian Ocean]] islands. A group of three mainly grey species from Africa and [[Madagascar]] are usually considered kestrels by their general shape and habits, but are probably distinct from the true kestrels discussed above. 
 
 There is only one kestrel in the Americas, with a wide range of [[habitat]]s. It is ''Falco sparverius''. The male is more brightly coloured than usual for kestrels, with a reddish back and tail.
