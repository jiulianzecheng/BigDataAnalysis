 '''Intoxication''' is the state of being affected by one or more [[psychoactive drug]]s. It can also refer to the effects caused by the ingestion of [[poison]] or by the overconsumption of normally harmless substances. 
 
 People who drink too much [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] become ''intoxicated.'' < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Alcohol addiction treatment|url=https://www.oxfordtreatment.com/addiction-treatment-ms/etta/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-17|website=Oxford Treatment Center|language=en-US}} < /ref >  They may become impaired in some or all of their [[sense]]s like touch or even eyesight. Long term drinkers develop tolerance to alcohol. This high tolerance means it takes more alcohol to produce the outward signs of intoxication. < ref > {{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Outpatient Addiction Treatment|url=https://deserthopetreatment.com/las-vegas-program/outpatient/|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-17|website=Desert Hope|language=en-US}} < /ref >  Intoxication may bring [[delirium]] or make people do or say things that are not normal for them. The level of harm done usually depends on the substance and the amount. Mild intoxication usually is not permanently harmful. Mild [[stimulant]]s like [[caffeine]] usually do not harm the person. 
 
 ==Types== 
 Some types of intoxication: 
 *[[Drunkenness|Alcohol intoxication]] 
 *[[Caffeine#Caffeine intoxication|Caffeine intoxication]] 
 *[[Health issues and the effects of cannabis#Effects|Cannabis intoxication]] 
 *[[Heroin#Effects|Heroin intoxication]] 
 *[[Water intoxication]] 
 Intoxication can cause a state of mind that remains once the person is no longer intoxicated that can be used as a legal defense: 
 *[[Settled insanity]] 
 
 ==Symptoms== 
 Often taking a mild [[depressant]] or stimulant does not have much effect on the person who took it. But more serious drugs, substances, or even medications can have a large effect on the person. Usually stimulants keep the person awake and energetic. Depressants work the opposite way; they decrease the [[Pulse|heart rate]] of the person and relax them. [[Sedative]]s give the same effect. More of these substances can carry harm or even life-threatening effects, if ingested in large amounts. Mixing alcohol with prescription drugs often leads to increased or hastened impairment. Alcohol can produce hazardous side effects, reduce heart rate, and drop blood pressure to a dangerous level.
