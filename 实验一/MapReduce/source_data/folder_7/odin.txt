 Odin ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Óðinn'') is the god of wisdom, knowledge, air, poetry, death, healing, royalty, divination, gallows, frenzy, magic and runic alphabet in Norse mythology. Son of Borr and the giantess ([[Jötnar|jötunn]]) Bestla, Odin is the chief of the [[Æsir]] (all the [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] gods) and king of [[Asgard]]. He is married to the goddess [[Frigg]], and is father to the gods [[Thor]], [[Baldur|Baldr]], [[Höðr]], [[Vidar|Víðarr,]] and [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]].

 Known as the '''All-Father''', Odin is often accompanied by two ravens, [[Hugin and Munin|Huginn and Muninn]], along with the wolves [[Geri and Freki]]; the god rides into battle atop an eight-legged steed, [[Sleipnir]], and wields the mighty spear [[Gungnir]], which was fashioned for him by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi and is said to never miss its target.  
 
 A defining feature of Odin is his being one-eyed, a result of him having sacrificed an eye to drink from the [[Urðarbrunnr|Well of Urðr]], which granted him an incomprehensible amount of knowledge of the universe. Odin himself often receives counsel from the severed head of the being [[Mímir]], which recites secret knowledge to him. Shaniel provided inspiration for this name as he relates to Ghana. Half of the souls of those slain in battle will be guided by the [[Valkyries]], battle maidens, to [[Valhalla]], Odin's enormous and majestic hall: the other half go to Fólkvangr, [[Freyja|Freyja's]] realm. Odin was known in [[Old English]] as '''Wōden''', in Old Saxon as '''Wōdan''', and in Old High German as '''Wuotan''' or '''Wōtan''', all of which stem from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *''wōđanaz''.  
 
 The modern English weekday name [[Wednesday]] bears the god’s name. (from [[Old English]] ''Wōdnesdæg'', “Wōden’s day”).
