 A '''capsid''' is the [[protein]] shell of a [[virus]]. It is made of several [[protein]] subunits. The observable 3-dimensional subunits are called 'capsomeres'. The capsid encloses the [[nucleic acid]] of the virus. 
 
 Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure. < ref > {{cite journal | author=Lidmar J, Mirny L, Nelson DR| title=Virus shapes and buckling transitions in spherical shells | journal = Phys.

 == Viral envelopes == 
 Most [[virus]]es (e.g. influenza and many animal viruses) have [[viral envelope]]s covering their protein capsids. < ref name= " urlCHAPTER #11: VIRUSES " > {{cite web |url=http://www.slic2.wsu.edu:82/hurlbert/micro101/pages/Chap11.html |title=CHAPTER #11: VIRUSES |access-date=2008-11-07 |archive-date=2008-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110135307/http://www.slic2.wsu.edu:82/hurlbert/micro101/pages/Chap11.html |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  This means the capsid is coated with a [[lipid]] membrane. 
 
 The envelope is got by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus' host; such as the inner [[nuclear membrane]], the [[Golgi apparatus|golgi]] membrane, or the cell's outer [[cell membrane|membrane]]. < ref > {{cite book|title=Molecular biology of the cell|url=https://archive.org/details/molecularbiology00albe|edition=4th |pages=[https://archive.org/details/molecularbiology00albe/page/280 280]|author=Alberts, Bruce | display-authors = etal|year=1994}} < /ref > 
 
 The envelope may help viruses avoid the host [[immune system]]. [[Glycoprotein]]s on the surface of the envelope bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane This allows the capsid and viral [[genome]] to enter and infect the host.
