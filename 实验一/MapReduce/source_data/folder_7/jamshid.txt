 '''Jamshid ''' ({{IPA-fa|dʒæmˈʃiːd|}})  < !-- ǰæmšīd -- >  ({{lang-fa|جمشید}}, ''Jamshīd'') ([[Middle Persian|Middle-]] and [[New Persian]]: جم, ''Jam'') ([[Avestan language|Avestan]]: 𐬫𐬌𐬨𐬀 ''Yima'') ([[Dari]]/[[Pashto]]: یما ''Yama'') is a famous name in many countries and he was  the fourth [[Shah]] of the mythological [[Pishdadian dynasty]] of [[Greater Iran|Iran]] according to ''[[Shahnameh]]''. 
 
 In [[Persian mythology]] and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the ancient Iran [[Pishdadian Dynasty]] . This role is already alluded to in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] scripture (e.g. ''[[Yasht]]'' 19, ''[[Vendidad]]'' 2), where the figure appears as Yima(-Kshaeta) 
 
 ''Jamshid'' (Jamshed, Jamshyd) and as a short pronunciation Jam  remains a common Iranian and Zoroastrian male name that is also popular in surrounding areas of Iran and middle east. 
 
 ==Etymology== 
 The name ''Jamshid'' is originally a compound of two parts, ''Jam'' and ''shid'', corresponding to the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] names ''Yima'' and ''Xšaēta'', ''*Xšaitah'' meant  " bright, shining "  or  " radiant " . The modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''[[Cem (given name)|Cem]]'' is derived from Persian ''Jam''. also the word [[Ajam]] is derived from the word Jam. according to the book [[Documents on the Persian Gulf's name]]  the Persian ''jam''  is the root of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Ajam]]'', assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam.  
 ==In scripture==

 Yima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the ''daevas'', who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign.  Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen.  Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says  " O [[Armaiti|Spenta Armaiti]], kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men. "

 Over time, the Avestan hero ''Yima Xšaēta'' became the world-ruling Shāh ''Jamshid'' of [[Persia]]n legend and mythology. 
 
 According to the ''[[Shahnameh|Shāhnāma]]'' of the poet [[Ferdowsi|Firdausī]], Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd . He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships.  
 Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the ''[[Cup of Jamshid|Jām-e Jam]]'' which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe. 
 
 Jamshid's capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of [[Persepolis]], which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called ''Takht-i Jamshēd'', the  " Throne of Jamshid " . 
 However, Persepolis was actually the capital of the [[Achaemenid]] kings and was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and [[Sassanid Empire|Sāsānians]] near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero [[Rostam]], and so were called ''[[Naqsh-e Rustam]]''. 
 
 ===Legend of the discovery of wine=== 
 King Jamshid is featured prominently in one [[apocryphal]] tale associated with the [[history of wine]] and its discovery.
