 '''Hyperglycemia''' is high [[blood sugar]] levels at or beyond 200 & nbsp;mg/dl. It can be a serious and [[life]] threatening [[health]] problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time.  
 
 In a healthy body, insulin helps [[glucose]] ([[sugar]]) get from the [[blood]] into the body's [[Cell|cells]].  There, the cells can [[Cellular respiration|use the sugar to make energy]].  However, when there is not enough insulin in the body, or if a person's body does not react to insulin normally (this is called insulin resistance), too much sugar stays in the blood.  This can cause serious health problems. 
 
 Extremely high blood sugar means [[diabetes mellitus]], a condition that often causes very high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind, or may be developing under low insulin levels or [[Insulin resistance|resistance to insulin.]] 
 
 == Symptoms == 
 
 === Early Signs === 
 Three of the early signs of hyperglycemia are  " the 3 polys " : polydipsia (feeling very thirsty), polyphagia (feeling very hungry), and polyuria ([[Urination|urinating]] a lot).  These things happen because: 
 * The body senses that its cells are not getting enough sugar.  The body triggers hunger, because eating is usually how people get sugar.  This causes polyphagia. 
 * The body senses that there is too much sugar in the blood, and tries to urinate out the extra sugar.  This causes polyuria. 
 * Because the person is urinating so much, they get [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] easily and get very thirsty (polydipsia). 
 Other early signs of high blood sugar include blurred vision, headache, and feeling tired. 
 
 === Late Signs === 
 If hyperglycemia gets worse or is not treated, it can cause toxic acids called [[Ketone|ketones]] to build up in the blood and urine.  This is called [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], which is a medical emergency. 
 
 Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis can include: 
 * Confusion, [[Seizure|seizures]], or [[coma]] 
 * Difficulty breathing with fruity-smelling breath ( " ketone breath "  - caused by the body trying to blow off the toxic ketones through breathing out) 
 * Weakness 
 * Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
