 '''Botswana''' (officially called the '''Republic of Botswana''') is a [[country]] in southern [[Africa]]. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Botswana is [[Gaborone]]. 
 
 == History == 
 The first people in Botswana's territory were the Khoe and San people. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Botswana {{!}} South African History Online|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/place/botswana|access-date=2021-05-10|website=www.sahistory.org.za}} < /ref >  Botswana was first formed as the Bechuanaland Protectorate by the [[British Empire]] in 1885. < ref > {{Cite web|title=History of Botswana {{!}} Embassy of the Republic of Botswana in Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.botswanaembassy.org/page/history-of-botswana|access-date=2021-05-10|website=www.botswanaembassy.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Fred|date=January 1989|title=The Birth of Botswana: A History of the Bechuanaland Protectorate from 1910 to 1966|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272925981|journal=African Economic History|via=ResearchGate}} < /ref > 
 
 == Geography == 
 {{see also|List of settlements in Botswana}} 
 The countries that border Botswana are [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]], and [[Namibia]]. It is also possible to travel from Botswana directly into [[Zambia]] by crossing the [[Zambezi River]] by [[ferry]]. 
 
 Botswana is [[landlocked]]. All of Botswana's [[trade]] must be brought in over land or by airplane. 
 
 The two most important [[geography|geographical features]] in Botswana are the [[Okavango Delta]] and the [[Kalahari Desert]]. 
 
 ==Divisions== 
 Botswana is divided into 10 districts: 
 *[[Southern District (Botswana)|Southern District]] 
 *[[South-East District (Botswana)|South-East District]] 
 *[[Kweneng District]] 
 *[[Kgatleng District]] 
 *[[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]]  
 *[[North-East District (Botswana)|North-East District]] 
 *[[Ngamiland District]] 
 *[[Kgalagadi District]]  
 *[[Chobe District]] 
 *[[Ghanzi District]] 
 
 == Culture == 
 People from Botswana are called ''Batswana''. The [[population]] of Botswana is about 2.2 million.  < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_bc.html|title=Africa :: Botswana — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-06-17|archive-date=2018-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608014516/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_bc.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  This is only 2.7 persons per km², a small number for a country of this size. This is because most of the country is [[desert]] and very dry. 
 
 Botswana has two official [[language]]s: Setswana and English. Setswana is the national language (also called ''[[Tswana language|Tswana]]''). 
 
 == Governance == 
 Botswana is a [[democracy]]. The people vote for their political [[leader]]s. Those leaders vote for the president. In 2008 [[Ian Khama]] became the fourth [[president]] of Botswana.   
 
 President Khama won elections in 2009 and 2014. The current President of Botswana is Dr. Eric K. Mokgweetsi who took over from Dr. Ian Khama Seretse Khama in 2018. 
 
 == Economy == 
 The [[economy]] of Botswana has been growing very fast since it became an [[independence|independent country]] in 1966. The people of Botswana have had the world's fastest growth in [[standard of living]] since that time. 
 
 Botswana's economy comes mostly from [[mining]]. This includes [[diamond]]s, [[metal]]s (including [[copper]]) and [[mineral]]s (including [[salt]]). Botswana is the highest producer of [[diamond]]s by value in the world. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.knowbotswana.com/botswana-diamonds.html|title=Botswana diamonds|publisher=Know Botswana.com|accessdate=December 24, 2014}} < /ref >  In 1999, Botswana produced over 30 million [[carat (mass)|carats]] (6,000 kg) of diamonds from the three Debswana mines. That is about 25% of worldwide production.  There has been an agreement with [[De Beers]] since 1969.  In 2023 a new agreement was made giving the country more of the diamonds - 30% in 2023, 40% from 2028 and 50% from 2033. < ref > {{Cite news|last=Dempsey|first=Harry|last2=Cotterill|first2=Joseph|date=2023-07-25|title=De Beers prospects blemished after Botswana cuts new diamond deal|work=Financial Times|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f2b27377-3650-448f-84ed-40e43118e801?|access-date=2023-07-25}} < /ref > 
 
 [[Tourism]] is also important to the country. Many people come to Botswana each year to see its [[wildlife]]. 
 
 The [[currency]] of Botswana is called the ''pula'' (which means [[rain]]). It is made up of 100 ''thebe'' (which means [[shield]]). In 2017, one US dollar was about 10.32 pulas. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?From=USD & To=BWP|title=XE: Convert USD/BWP. United States Dollar to Botswana Pula|website=www.xe.com|accessdate=2017-05-17}} < /ref > 
 
 ==In popular culture== 
 
 The ''No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'' books by Alexander McCall Smith are set in Botswana.  The HBO television series based on the books was filmed in Botswana.
