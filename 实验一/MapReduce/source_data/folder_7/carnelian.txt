 '''Carnelian''' (also spelled cornelian) is a brownish-red mineral commonly used as a semi-precious gemstone. < ref > Websters New World College Dictionary. 4th ed. 2001. < /ref > < ref > Duda, Rudolf  and Rejl, Lubos 1990. ''Minerals of the World''. < /ref >   
 
 Similar to carnelian is a darker and harder stone called 'sard'. The two names are often used interchangeably. Both carnelian and sard are varieties of the [[silica]] mineral [[chalcedony]] coloured by impurities of [[iron oxide]]. 
 
 The gemstone has been used since prehistory. < ref > Tallon F. (ed) ''Cornaline et pierres précieuses de Sumer à l’Islam''. Musée du Louvre, Paris < /ref >
