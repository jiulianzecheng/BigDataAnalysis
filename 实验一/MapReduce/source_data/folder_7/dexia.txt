 In 2008, the bank received taxpayer bailouts for €6 & nbsp;billion, and it became the first big casualty of the 2011 [[European sovereign debt crisis]]. Due to big losses, suffered among others from the debt haircut on Greek government bonds, an orderly resolution process began in October 2011. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/10/dexia-new-bailout-belgian-deal |title=Dexia gets new bailout with €4bn Belgian deal |date=10 October 2011 | location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Jill |last=Treanor}} < /ref > < ref name= " Dalton " > {{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203633104576620720705508498 | title=France, Belgium Reach Pact on Ailing Dexia | access-date=2011-10-10 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Matthew | last=Dalton | date=10 October 2011}} < /ref >  As part of the resolution, Dexia Bank Belgium was bought out from the Dexia group by the Belgian state, and will continue to exist under its new name [[Belfius]].
