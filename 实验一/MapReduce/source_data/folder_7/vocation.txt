A '''vocation''' (from the [[Latin]] word ''vocātiō'' meaning a calling) is a [[job]] that suits a [[person]] best. It is also the [[desire]] to do a particular job, especially a [[religious]] [[career]] like being a [[priest]].  For religious people, a vocation is often something they feel [[God]] has asked them to do.  A vocation is followed more for [[spiritual]] or [[emotion]]al reasons than  for [[money]], which is a helpful extra benefit from a vocation but not the reason for it. 
 
 ==In Christianity== 
 Vocations meet a [[psychology|psychological]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] need for the worker, and the word can also be used for a job at which a person is [[gifted]].  The word  " vocation "  comes from the [[Latin]] ''vocare'', meaning  " to call " ;. < ref > Richard A. Muller, Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House Company, 1985), s.v. “vocatio.” < /ref >   In the past the word meant people's being called to follow [[Christianity]].  [[Martin Luther]] was the first to use it in the modern way, to describe a life-task. < ref > [[Max Weber]], ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', trans. Talcott Parsons, Ch.3, p. 79  &  note 1. < /ref > 
 
 Christians believe God has created each person with gifts and [[talent]]s [[design]]ed for a reason.  Christians can be called to vocations that are faithful to Christian teachings, such as marriage, or to be a [[priest]], monk or [[nun]], [[chastity]] as a single person or the general calling to live a life that is right, for the good of the [[Church]] or [[Human race|humanity]]. 
 
 For those who are not [[priests]] or full-time religious people, [[Protestantism]] was important in telling them they still had a vocation.  [[Calvinism]] told people to work hard in life. Calvin said a Christian had two callings; a general calling to serve [[God]] and a calling to do a particular job at which they are useful.  Protestant ministers in the past said working hard gives God [[glory]].  Without something to do, they said people were more likely to [[sin]]. 
 
 ==Vocation outside of Christianity== 
 This belief also has an impact outside of religion.  Modern occupations seen as vocations are those that involve caring or teaching, such as [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[teaching]], or [[veterinary]] work. [[Politics]], may also be seen as a vocation. Campaigning for [[human rights]], such as with the groups [[Amnesty International]] and [[Greenpeace]], can also be seen as a vocation, although the word usually refers to a full-time job.  People following other religions can also feel called to do a certain job by their gods.
