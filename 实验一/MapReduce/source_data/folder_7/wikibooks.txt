 '''Wikibooks''' (previously called '''Wikimedia Free Textbook Project''' and '''Wikimedia-Textbooks''') is a collection of free [[book]]s. It is one of many projects that are run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. It is a [[wiki]], which makes it possible for anyone to edit. 
 
 Some books are original, but others have started as text copied from other sources of free-content textbooks found on the Internet. 
 
 The [[CC-BY-SA]] license covers all the content that is in Wikibooks. 
 
 In February 2010, the [[Basic English|Simple English]] Wikibooks was closed and locked.
