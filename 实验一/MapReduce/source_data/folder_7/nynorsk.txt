 '''Nynorsk''' (New Norwegian) is one of the two official written standards of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]; the other is [[Bokmål]]. It is based on Norwegian dialects and is especially common around [[Bergen]]. [[Ivar Aasen]] created it during the 19th century as a Norwegian alternative to [[Danish]] upon which it is based. Danish was then often written in [[Norway]].
