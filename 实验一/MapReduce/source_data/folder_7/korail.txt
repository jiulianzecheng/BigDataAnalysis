 '''Korail''' is the name of the national [[railroad]] operator in [[South Korea]]. 
 
 ==Lines== 
 Currently, Korail runs the railway and part of subway.  
 The list of railway consists of [[Gyeonbu line]]경부선, [[Honam line]]호남선, [[Jeolla line]]전라선, [[Janghang line]]장항선, [[Gyeongchun line]]경춘선, [[Jungang line]]중앙선, [[Chungbuk line]]경북선, [[Yeongdong line]]영동선, [[Taebaek line]]태백선,[[Gyeongbuk line]]경북선, [[Daegu line]]대구선, [[donghae Nambu line]]동해 남부선, [[Gyeongjeon line]]경전선, [[Gyeongui line]]경의선, [[Gyeonwon line]]경원선, based on their [[List of districts in South Korea|district]]. 
 Gyeonbu and Honam line is the main lines that across the South Korean Peninsula. Not only this, Korail also offers [[Tongguen line]]통근선 service in some districts. In addition to these lines, some of subway lines of Seoul also are run by Korail. 
 
 ==Train Classes== 
 {{original research|date=January 2014|section}} 
 
 Korail train contain many kinds of train such as [[KTX]], [[saemaul-ho]], [[mugunghwa-ho]] and [[nuriro]]. < ref name= " Korail " > http://www.korail.com < /ref > 
 
 KTX is the highest level of trains. It is served on Gyeongbu and Honam line.  
 Saemaul-ho train is next fastest and comfortable train after KTX. It is offered on wider range of lines than KTX.  
 Mugunghwa-ho train is more generally used as a low-priced but slow train. It is offered on almost all lines.  
 Nuriro train has similar level of price and speed with Mugunghwa-ho, but it serves less and shorter sections than the Mugunghwa-ho, from [[Seoul]] to [[Singchang]]. 
 
 ==Rail Passes== 
 Korail has many kinds of passes. < ref name=Korail/ > 
 
 First, there are some passes available in specific area.  
 For example, with O-train pass, people can take O-train off the V-train on Jungang, Chungbuk, Yeongdong, Taebaek, and Gyeongbuk line.  
 Also, with S-train pass, you can take part of Gyeonbu, Honam, Jeolla, donghae Nambu, and Gyeongjeon line. 
 
 There is also a pass for youth, which is [[Rail-ro]]. People who are under 25 can use it in the summer and winter season.(June 1st - August 31th, December 31th - February 28th). < ref name= " rail-ro " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.rail-ro.com/main/index.php |title=자유 여행 패스 - 내일로 |access-date=2013-12-18 |archive-date=2013-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601083746/http://www.rail-ro.com/main/index.php |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Korail offers a rail pass called [[Korea Rail Pass]], or KR Pass for short, to foreign travellers. The pass lets foreign travellers take most of the trains that Korail runs, including KTX. But subways and tourist trains by Korail are not covered. < ref name= " Pass " > {{Cite web |url=http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/ena/TR/TR_EN_5_6.jsp#Joint%20Ticket |title=Official Site of Korea Tourism Org.: Railroad Passes |access-date=2014-01-02 |archive-date=2013-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090053/http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/ena/TR/TR_EN_5_6.jsp#Joint%20Ticket |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Foreigners living in South Korea for more than six months are not allowed to use the KR Pass. Korail has another pass for these people, the Happy Rail Pass, which is the same as the KR Pass but more expensive. < ref name= " Pass "  / > 
 
 Korail also sells a Korea-Japan Joint Ticket together with [[JR Group]], including both railways in South Korea and Japan, as well as a high-speed ferry trip between Korea and Japan (or a round trip, depending on the pass). However, the pass cannot be used for KTX, and the holders need to buy an extra ticket (with a 30% discount). < ref name= " Pass "  / >
