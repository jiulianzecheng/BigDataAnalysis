 ==Name== 
 The name ''Pevensey'' was first recorded in 947 as ''Pefenesea'', meaning  " River of [a man named] Pefen " . It comes from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] personal name ''Pefen'' plus ''eã'', meaning  " river " . This is probably a reference to the now largely silted-up [[marsh]]es. < ref > {{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|last=Mills|first=David|page=367|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199609086}} < /ref > 
 
 ==History== 
 [[File:Pevensey Castle 01.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|{{Center|Pevensey Castle}}]] 
 In the 290s the Romans built a [[fort]] at Pevensey, which they named Anderitum. In 471 [[Saxon]]s attacked Pevensey and the fort was abandoned for centuries. When [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] invaded England in September 1066, he landed at Pevensey. The bay provided a safe haven for his [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of 700 ships. The English army had been awaiting Duke William's arrival on the [[south]] [[coast]] all [[summer]]. With supplies running short King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] allowed his [[soldier]]s to return home. When [[Harald Hardrada]] the king of [[Norway]] invaded [[north]]ern England in late September, King Harold gathered his army and moved north to [[York]], 250 miles away, to meet the invaders. < ref name= " Morillo174.5 " > Stephen Morillo, ''The Battle of Hastings: Sources and Interpretations'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press 1998), pp. 174–175 < /ref >  William, meanwhile, moved his army and fleet to [[Hastings]] and built a castle while he awaited Harold and his army. < ref name= " Morillo174.5 "  / >   
 
 After the [[Battle of Hastings]] the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort at Pevensey was [[Occupied territory|occupied]] by the Normans. It was given to [[Robert, Count of Mortain]] (William's half brother). Robert de Mortain built his castle there. The castle was besieged several times during the 11th–13th centuries. [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ordered that it be [[Demolition|demolished]] but the order was ignored. As late as 1942 small additions were made to the castle for the defence of [[Britain]]. It became a [[Watchtower|lookout]] over the channel for [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[aircraft]] during [[World War II]]. Today the castle is in the upkeep of [[English Heritage]]. < ref > [http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001001001013007002007 Pevensey Castle: English Heritage site] < /ref >
