 '''Seahorses''' are a type of [[teleost]] [[fish]]. They are in the [[genus]] '''''Hippocampus.''''' They are called 'seahorses' because their head looks like a [[Horse|horse's]] head. There are about 32–48 [[species]] of seahorse. Seahorses live in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s.  
 
 Seahorses use [[camouflage]] to hide. < ref name=seahorse/ > 
 
 == Fossil record == 
 The earliest known seahorse fossils are ''[[Hippocampus sarmaticus|H. sarmaticus]]'' and ''[[Hippocampus slovenicus|H. slovenicus]]''. 
 
 == Reproduction == 
 Seahorses are [[wikt:unique|unique]] because the male hatches the [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in a pouch on his belly. < ref name=seahorse/ >  The female inserts her [[ovipositor]] into the male’s brood pouch. She places dozens to thousands of eggs in the pouch. As the female releases her eggs, her body slims while his swells. The male releases his [[sperm]] directly into the water. The sperm then fertilize the eggs in the pouch. The fertilised eggs are then embedded in the pouch wall. < ref name=seahorse/ >  They get [[nutrition]] and [[oxygen]] from the fluid in the pouch. In the pouch, the [[salinity]] of the water is controlled. This prepares the newborns for life in the sea. < ref name=seahorse > {{Cite web |url=http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/why-seahorses/essential-facts |title=The Seahorse Project |access-date=2012-01-23 |archive-date=2012-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204072306/http://seahorse.fisheries.ubc.ca/why-seahorses/essential-facts |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 Both animals then sink back into the [[seagrass]] and she swims away. The eggs then hatch  < ref name=Milius > {{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_11_157/ai_61291647/pg_1 |title=Pregnant—and Still Macho - seahorses  & #124; Science News  & #124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=2009-11-11 |first=Susan |last=Milius |year=2000 |archive-date=2008-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224040542/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_11_157/ai_61291647/pg_1 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref name=NatGeo > {{

 Throughout gestation, which in most species requires two to four weeks, his mate visits him daily for 'morning greetings'. They interact for about 6 minutes. The female then swims away until the next morning, and the male vacuums up food through his snout. < ref name=Milius/ > 
 
 Research published in 2007 shows that the males release sperm into the surrounding sea water during [[fertilization]], and not directly into the pouch as previously thought. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article2165477.ece |title=Sex and the seahorse - Science, News - Independent.co.uk |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2009-11-11 |location=London |first=Steve |last=Connor |archive-date=2008-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724043057/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article2165477.ece |url-status=dead }} < /ref > 
 
 === Birth === 
 The number of young released by the male seahorse averages 100-200 for most species, but may be as low as 5 for the smaller species, or as high as 1,500. < !-- dead  < ref >

 When the fry are ready to be born, the male expels them with muscular contractions. He gives birth at night and is ready for the next batch of eggs by morning when his mate returns.  
 
 Like almost all other fish species, seahorses do not take care of their young after birth. Infants are susceptible to [[Predation|predators]] or [[Ocean current|ocean currents]] which wash them away from feeding grounds or into temperatures too extreme for their  bodies. Fewer than 0.5% of infants survive to adulthood. This is why litters are so large. These survival rates are actually fairly high compared to other fish, because of their protected gestation. This makes the process worth the cost to the father. The eggs of most other fish are abandoned immediately after fertilization. < ref name=NatGeo/ > 
 
 Seahorses are the only fish that experience true male pregnancy.  < ref name=NatGeo/ >

 == Phases of courtship == 
 Seahorses exhibit four phases of courtship. 
 
 === Phase one === 
 This initial courtship takes place about 30 minutes after dawn on each courtship day. In this phase, the males and females will remain apart during the night, but after dawn they will come together in a side-by-side position, brighten, and engage in courtship. 
 
 === Phase two === 
 This phase begins with the female beginning her pointing posture, by leaning her body towards the male, who will lean away and quiver. It can last up to 54 minutes. 
 
 === Phase three === 
 The third phase begins with the females brightening and assuming the pointing position. It lasts for 9 minutes. 
 
 === Phase four === 
 The final phase includes 5–8 bouts of courtship. Each bout begins with both the male and female anchored to the same plant about 3 cm apart; usually they are facing each other and are still bright from the previous phase.
