 The '''chromosomes''' of a [[cell]] are in the [[cell nucleus]]. They carry the [[Genetics|genetic]] information. Chromosomes are made up of [[DNA]] and [[protein]] combined as [[chromatin]]. Each chromosome contains many [[gene]]s. Chromosomes come in pairs: one set from the mother; the other set from the father. [[Cytology|Cytologists]] label chromosomes with numbers. < ref > White M.J.D. 1973. ''The chromosomes'', 6th ed. London: Chapman and Hall < /ref > 
 
 Chromosomes are present in every [[cell nucleus]] with very few and special exceptions. This means they are found in all [[eukaryote]]s, since only eukaryotes have cell nuclei. When eukaryote cells divide, the chromosomes also divide.  
 
 When a [[Somatic cell|somatic]] (body) cell (such as a [[muscle]] cell) divides, the process is called [[mitosis]]. Before mitosis, the cell copies all the chromosomes and then it can divide. When they duplicate, chromosomes look like the letter  " X " . When they are doubled, the two halves are called [[chromatid]]s (see diagram). The chromatids are joined at the [[centromere]]. 
 
 There are 46 chromosomes in a human as 23 pairs. Everyone has a set of chromosomes from their father and a set from their mother. They include a pair of [[sex chromosome]]s. The mother's [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s always contain an X chromosome, while the father's [[sperm]] contains either a [[Y chromosome]] or an X chromosome. That determines the sex of the child. If the child gets a Y chromosome from the father it is male. If it gets an X from the father, it is female. 
 
 To produce sex cells ([[gamete]]s), the [[stem cell]]s go through a different division process called [[meiosis]]. This reduces the 23 pairs ([[diploid]]) to 23 singles ([[haploid]]). These, when combined by [[fertilisation]], produce the new set of 23 pairs. 
 
 Different animals have different numbers of chromosomes. If a person does not have the usual number of chromosomes, they may die or have one or more peculiarities. For example, they might get a [[Genetics|genetic disorder]] like [[Down syndrome]] (extra chromosome 21), or [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (a male with two X chromosomes). Some genetic disorders are more common than others.

 '''Polytene chromosomes''' are over-sized chromosomes which have developed from standard chromosomes. Specialized cells undergo repeated rounds of [[DNA replication]] without [[cell division]] ([[mitosis|endomitosis]]). Polytene chromosomes form when multiple rounds of replication produce many sister [[chromatid]]s that are stuck together in parallel. < ref > Zhimulev, Igor F.  &  Koryakov, Dmitry E. 2009. Polytene chromosomes. ''Encyclopedia of Life Sciences'' (eLS). Chichester: Wiley. pp. 1–10. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001183.pub2/abstract] < /ref > 
 
 Polytene chromosomes are found in ''[[Drosophila]]'' species and in nonbiting [[midges]]. They also occur in arthropods of the class [[Collembola]],  [[ciliate]] [[protozoa]], early stages of mammalian embryos, and suspensor cells in plants. < ref name= " summer " > {{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=Adrian T.|title=Chromosomes: organization and function. |date=2002| publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons |location=Chichester |isbn=9780470695227| pages=182–193| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goSCosFLcvUC}} < /ref > 
 
 Polytene cells have a metabolic function. Multiple copies of genes allows a high level of [[gene expression]]. In ''Drosophila'', for example, the chromosomes of the [[larva]]l [[salivary gland]]s have many rounds of endoreduplication.   
 
 '''Chromosome puffs''' (seen in diagram) are diffused uncoiled regions of the polytene chromosome. They are sites of active [[Transcription (genetics)| transcription]].
