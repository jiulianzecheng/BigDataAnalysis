 ==History== 
 Paramore was originally formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The members then were vocalist Hayley Williams, lead guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, and bassist Jeremy Davis. < ref > {{cite web| title= History| publisher= paramore.net| url= http://www.paramore.net/about#band_history| accessdate= 2007-12-31}} < /ref >  Later rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum joined. The name  " Paramore "  came from the name of their first bassist's mother. < ref > {{cite interview| subject= Paramore| title= Hello My Name Is| url= http://www.paramore.net/video| accessdate= 2009-06-11| archive-date= 2008-04-09| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080409202902/http://www.paramore.net/video| url-status= dead}} < /ref >  When they learned the meaning of the word  " [[wikt:paramour|paramour]] "  (it means  " secret lover " ), they decided to use the name under ''Paramore'' spelling. < ref name= " Euro " > {{cite interview |subject=Josh Farro |subject2=Hayley Williams |subject3= Jeremy Davis| interviewer=cathyreay |title= Interview With Paramore |date=2007-07-14| url=http://www.europunk.net/interviews/173 |accessdate=2007-08-17}} < /ref > 
 
 ===2005: ''All We Know Is Falling''=== 
 Paramore went to Orlando, Florida to start working on their first album. Shortly after, Jeremy Davis left the band for personal reasons. Hayley Williams then wrote the song  " [[All We Know]] "  about his leaving. The band later decided to work the album around that idea, about someone that left something. The album artwork also describes that concept. Hayley Williams explains,  " The couch on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling'' with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space. " < ref name= " Trades " > {{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Tony Pascarella| title= Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore| date= 2005-08-08| url= http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440| accessdate= 2007-08-16| archive-date= 2007-02-13| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070213011120/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440| url-status= dead}} < /ref >  Recording took three weeks, and promotional material for the album only used the four remaining members. 
 
 Before starting on tour, the band added bassist John Hembree. < ref > {{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| interviewer= Jason Schleweis of Crush Music Mag| title= Paramore Interview| date= 2005-07-14| url= http://www.crushmusicmag.com/joomla/interviews/48-paramore-interview-07142005| accessdate= 2007-10-12| archive-date= 2011-07-19| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719191710/http://www.crushmusicmag.com/joomla/interviews/48-paramore-interview-07142005| url-status= dead}} < /ref >  But soon, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after being asked by the band to replace Hembree. 
 
 ''All We Know Is Falling'' released on July 24, 2005. Paramore also released  " [[Pressure (Paramore song)|Pressure]] "  as their first single. The music video for that song was directed by [[Shane Drake]]. The song had failed to get into the charts. In July, they released the second single, called  " [[Emergency (song)|Emergency]] " . In the music video, Hunter Lamb was their new rhythm guitarist, replacing Jason Bynum. < ref name= " AMG " > {{cite web| title= Biography| publisher= All Music| url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p729547|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate= 2007-08-16}} < /ref >  The music video was directed by Shane Drake again.

In 2007, Hunter Lamb left the band to get married. < ref name= " AMG " / > 
 
 ===2007: ''Riot!'' and other projects=== 
 Paramore started recording their second album, called ''[[Riot!]]'' in January 2007. In the recording process, guitarist Josh Farro played all guitar parts because Hunter Lamb's had left. < ref name= " cellar " > {{cite interview| subject= Josh Farro| interviewer= Stephanie Keller| title= Paramore: They’re Looking for a Riot!| date= 2007-05-01| url= http://www.thecellarmagazine.com/underground/?p=130| accessdate= 2007-10-13| archive-date= 2007-12-20| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071220003842/http://www.thecellarmagazine.com/underground/?p=130| url-status= dead}} < /ref >  Then Farro's asked their old friend, Taylor York, to joined the band as rhythm guitarist for touring. < ref name= " MTV " / >  They released ''Riot!'' on June 12, 2007.

 They called the album  " ''Riot'' "  because it meant  " a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion " . < ref name= " girl " > {{cite interview| subject= Hayley Williams| subject2= Josh Farro| interviewer= Julia Conny| title= Paramore| date= 2007-05-25| url= http://www.absolutepunk.net/printthread.php?t=239981| accessdate= 2007-10-13}} < /ref >  The first single from the album,  " [[Misery Business]] " , was released on June 21, 2007.

Williams wrote on the band's website that  " the break will give that band a chance to get away and work out our personal issues " . MTV.com reported rumors of problems had started earlier in the month when Josh Farro expressed his anger against the media's focus on Hayley Williams. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1582073/20080221/paramore.jhtml|title=Paramore Cancel European Tour, Say They Need Time Off To Deal With 'A Lot Of Internal Issues'|website=[[MTV]] }} < /ref >  In the middle of those problems, Paramore recorded the music video for  " [[That's What You Get]] " , the album's fourth single.

None of us were really shocked. For the last year it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around anymore.

But we never for a second thought about leaving any of this behind... " 
 
 On December 22, 2010, Josh Farro post a response on his [[Blogger]] account, telling his version about his departure. The post that Josh wrote was entirely different from the band's post.
