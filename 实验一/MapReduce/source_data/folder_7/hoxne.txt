 '''Hoxne''' (pronounced 'Hoxen') is an ancient village in [[Suffolk]], [[England]], about five miles (8 & nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Diss]], [[Norfolk]] 
 
 The area around the village is of great [[archaeological]] significance.  
 #It was one of the first places where [[flint]] [[hand axes]] were found (late 18th century). < ref name=axe > Frere, John 1800. Account of flint weapons discovered at Hoxne in Suffolk. ''Archeologia'', '''13''', 204-205 < /ref >  [[John Frere]] [1740{{ndash}}1807], who lived at Roydon Hall in [[Diss]], was the first person to recognise and write about the hand axes. He wrote a letter to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In this letter he connected the flints to [[strata]] in the site of an interglacial [[lake]], part of the Hoxnian [[interglacial]].   
 #It is the archaeological [[type site]] for the '''Hoxnian Stage''' or Hoxnian interglacial. The Hoxnian Stage is a middle [[Pleistocene]] stage of the geological history of the [[British Isles]].

 The village is also home to The Swan Inn. The Swan occupies a 15th Century, Grade II listed lodge, formerly known as Bishops Lodge. This pub is set at the bottom end of the village green, near Saint Edmund's memorial and bridge. < ref > refers to Saint Edmund the Martyr, born 869, King of East Anglia. < /ref >  Built in 1480 by the [[Henry le Despencer|Bishop of Norwich]], The Swan has a long history; both the restaurant and bars reflect Hoxne's [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] past, with ornate ceiling beams and wide-planked floors.
