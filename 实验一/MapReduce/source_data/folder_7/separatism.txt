 In a [[society]], certain people may have [[idea]]s that are noticeably different from those of the [[majority]]. These people are sometimes called hat the majority (for example, the [[State (polity)|state]] or a [[religion|religious group]]) recognises that their ideas are different. Very often, they also want [[autonomy]], [[self-determination]], and perhaps [[secession]] and [[independence]] from the main group. < ref > R.

It may also be because they have different ideas about governing, laws or religion.
