 == History == 
 
 === Early history (Before 1811) === 
 ''Het Hogeland'' (In English; The high land) used to be the name for a larger piece of land around Hoogland. People lived here since at least the 8th century AD. People assume that they probably started working together in the 12th century. This resulted in many [[cooperation]]s between farmers and the like. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Hoogland|url=https://www.archiefeemland.nl/hulp-bij-onderzoek/tips/wijken-en-straten/hoogland|access-date=2023-05-09|website=Archief Eemland|language=nl}} < /ref > 
 
 === Hoogland as municipaility (1811-1974) === 
 Between 1811 and 1974, Hoogland was a municipality. This was because the [[First French Empire|French]], who had taken over the Netherlands during this time, were changing the way the country was organised. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Historische Reeks|url=https://historischekringhoogland.nl/index.php/historische-reeks/|access-date=2023-05-09|language=nl}} < /ref >

 === Hoogland as a part of Amersfoort (1967-) === 
 In 1967, it was revealed that Hoogland would be broken apart and would be given to two other municipalities, [[Amersfoort]] and [[Bunschoten]]. Not everyone was happy with this change. Many people from Hoogland wanted to stay independent. But their protests didn't manage to stop the change. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.plaatsengids.nl/hoogland|title=Nederlandse plaatsnamen verklaard|last=van Berkel|first=Gerald|last2=Samplonius|first2=Kees|last3=Samplonius|first3=Kees|last4=Samplonius|first4=Kees|date=2018}} < /ref >
