'''Theocritus''' was a Greek poet. He was born c. 300 BC in [[Syracuse, Sicily]] and  died after 260 BC. Theocritus was the inventor of [[pastoral poetry]] (poetry about [[shepherd]]s). His poems were called idylls which perhaps means  " little poems " . Very little is known about his life but at various times he lived in [[Sicily]], [[Cos]] and [[Alexandria]].
