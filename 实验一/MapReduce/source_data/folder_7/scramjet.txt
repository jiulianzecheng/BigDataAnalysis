 A '''scramjet''' ('''supersonic''' '''combustion''' '''ramjet''') is a special type of [[ramjet]] [[jet engine]] where fuel combustion takes place while the air in the engine is moving faster than the speed of sound. < ref > {{Cite web|last=LaRC|first=Bob Allen|title=NASA - How Scramjets Work|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/X43A_2006_5.html|access-date=2022-11-03|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|archive-date=2022-12-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202230846/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/X43A_2006_5.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In a ramjet, air is slowed to subsonic (slower than the speed of sound) speeds before fuel is burned. Unlike ramjets, scramjets do not use shock cones to compress incoming air; instead, shock waves from inside the engine compress the air by slowing it down very quickly. This means that scramjets can operate very efficiently at extremely high speeds. However, a scramjet relies on the aircraft moving much faster than the speed of sound in order to work; scramjets do not work at subsonic, or even low supersonic, speeds. 
 
 As of November 2022, scramjets are still experimental. This means that they have not been used on [[Airliner|commercial airliners]] or in active military scenarios. Successful scramjet tests have been conducted, however. 
 
 == Advantages and disadvantages == 
 
 === Advantages === 
 
 # Does not need to carry [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] 
 # No complex parts makes it easy to build 
 # Has a higher [[specific impulse]] than a [[rocket engine]] 
 # Could provide [[Single-stage-to-orbit|easy access to space]] in the future due to high top speed 
 
 === Disadvantages === 
 
 # Difficult and expensive [[Research and development|testing/development]] 
 # Needs a separate engine to get it up to speed
