In [[Australia]], an '''outstation''' is a small, [[rural]] [[Human settlement|settlement]] of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australians]]. They are usually built on or near the community's [[Homeland|traditional country]]; the outstations are therefore also called '''homelands'''. The people living on an outstation are usually closely [[Family|related]], belonging to one or two families. The people will have a [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|spiritual]] and [[Ancestor|ancestral]] relationship with the land. The number of people living in the settlement may rise and fall throughout the year, depending on events (such as [[death]]s and [[ceremony|ceremonies]]), but the permanent population is normally less than a few dozen. The definition of an outstation will vary greatly depending on the region, cultural group, history and [[States and territories of Australia|state]] [[property]] [[law]]s. They are generally classed as residential areas on [[Aboriginal title|Aboriginal-owned]] land. They are often located near sites that are [[Sacred site|culturally important]]. The average outstation consists of little more than one or more [[house]]s and a source of water. They are usually very basic, and constructed entirely by the people living there. Most of these communities are located in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. < ref name= " may-altman " / > 
 
 In [[Statistics|statistical]] data, outstations are called  " discrete indigenous communities " . There are more than a thousand such communities in Australia. They are largely [[Autonomy|self-governing]]. < ref name= " may-altman " / > < ref name= " amnesty " / > 
 
 ==History== 
 {{main|Outstation movement}} 
 Historically, the word ''outstation'' referred to a [[wikt:dwelling|dwelling]] or [[wikt:shelter|shelter]] on [[sheep]] or [[cattle]] [[Station (agriculture)|stations]]. Such shelters were built on stations that were large enough to have more than a day's travel (by [[Horse riding|horseback]]) between different parts of the property. They contained beds and food for [[Stockman|stockmen]]. 
 
 During the 1970s and 1980s, a large number of Aboriginal people moved away from the towns and [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] in which they had been settled years before. They returned with their families to the areas where they grew up, and set up [[camp]]s or homes there. This became known as the [[outstation movement]]. For most people, it was an attempt at returning to the traditional way of life and getting back their [[autonomy]] and [[Sustainability|self-sufficiency]]. < ref name= " may-altman " / >  This movement developed after the Australian government had decided to give [[Social Security|welfare benefits]] to indigenous people. It had also started policies encouraging [[self-determination]] and [[Autonomy|self-management]] for indigenous communities. < ref name= " glaskin " / >  This was the opposite of what the government had previously planned for indigenous Australians ([[cultural assimilation]]). < ref name= " may-altman " / > 
 
 In October 1976, a report by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs estimated that there were more than 100 outstation communities. Most of them were located in the Northern Territory. In [[Arnhem Land]], there were about 55 outstations by the end of 1976, with an average size of about 30 people. About 30 more were located in the southwest of the Northern Territory, ranging in size from 15 to 100 people. The Northern Territory had early success in the outstation movemnet, because the [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia#Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976|Aboriginal Land Rights Act]] was passed in the territory in 1976. < ref name= " altman " / > < ref name= " glaskin " / >  This was the first Aboriginal land rights law in the country. 
 
 There are now more than a thousand outstation communities in Australia. < ref name= " may-altman " / >  There are about 500 in the Northern Territory, and around one-third of Aboriginal people in the Territory live on outstations. < ref name= " amnesty " / > 
 
 Several studies have shown that people living on outstations are much healthier than other Aboriginal people. < ref name= " may-altman " / > < ref name= " amnesty " / >
