 ==Water== 
 
 To count as a real onsen, the water must be at least 25° and have the right amounts of [[mineral water|minerals]], or dissolved rocks, in it.  For example, the water must have [[iron]], [[calcium]] and [[sulfur]].  Some onsen smell like rotten eggs because of [[hydrogen sulfide]]. < ref name=Onsen > {{cite web|url=https://cooljp.co//article/differences-onsen-sento-super-sento-cj-6669|title=All You Need to Know about Japanese Public Baths|accessdate=July 7, 2021|publisher=Cool JP}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Hotels== 
 
 Many onsen have a hotel nearby.  This kind of hotel is called a [[ryokan]]. < ref name=Et / >   Not all ryokan have onsen.  Some ryokan are 1200 years old. < ref name=Onsen / > 
 
 ==History== 
 
 There have been onsen in Japan for all of history. < ref name=Et / >   People have been using the [[Dogo Onsen]] on [[Shikoku]] for as long as 3000 years. < ref name=BBC > {{cite news|publisher=[[BBC]] Travel|accessdate=July 8, 2021|title=The origins of bathhouse culture around the world|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20121129-the-origins-of-bathhouse-culture-around-the-world|date=November 29, 2012|author=Suemedha Sood}} < /ref > 
 
 ==Manners== 
 
 Bathers at an onsen are there to relax, not to get clean.  To keep the water from getting dirty, people at an onsen must shower before getting into the water. < ref name=Et / >  In very cold weather, it is sometimes all right to get into the onsen just for a short while to warm up, then go shower, then come back. Some onsen allow [[bathing suit]]s, but most of the time, visitors must wear no clothes at all.  This is to keep any clothes that might be dirty out of the water, and keep the water clean.  When walking to the onsen, people cover their [[genitals|private parts]] with a small towel and then put the towel on their heads after they get into the water.  People are not supposed to put their heads or hair in the water, and they are not supposed to have [[tattoo]]s.  This is because, in Japan, people think of the [[Yakuza]] criminals when they see tattoos. < ref name=Et / >
