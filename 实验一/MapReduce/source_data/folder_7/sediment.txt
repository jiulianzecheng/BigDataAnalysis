'''Sediment''' is made of small particles deposited in water or on land. After [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]], sediments may stay in their new place a long time and be covered by newer sediments. Pressure may slowly transform sediment into [[sedimentary rock]]s.  
 
 The word sediment is also used for material transported by [[wind]] or water, and deposited on the surface. Sediments are often [[eroded]] again and deposited in a new place. The study of how sedimentary rocks are formed is called [[sedimentology]]. 
 
 In more general use, sediment is any matter which falls to the bottom of a [[liquid]], such as [[beer]]. < ref > Concise Oxford English Dictionary. < /ref >
