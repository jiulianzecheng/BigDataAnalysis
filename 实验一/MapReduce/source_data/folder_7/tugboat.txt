A '''tugboat''' or '''towboat''' is a type of [[boat]] that maneuvers other vessels by pushing or pulling them. This is done either by direct contact or by means of a tow line. Tugboats typically move vessels that are restricted in their ability to maneuver on their own, such as [[ship]]s in a crowded [[harbor]] or a narrow [[canal]], < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ & dq=1930+plane+%22Popular & pg=PA22  " How Pygmy Tugboats Dock a Giant Liner.
