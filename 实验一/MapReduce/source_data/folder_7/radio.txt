 Radio is a way to send [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electromagnetic signal]]s over a long distance, to deliver [[information]] from one place to another.  A machine that sends [[radio wave]]s is called a '''transmitter''', while a machine that  " picks up "  the signals is called a '''receiver''' or antenna. A machine that does both jobs is a  " transceiver " . When [[radio signal]]s are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a [[broadcast]]. 
 
 [[Television]] also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound. 
 
 Airplanes and other things may be used under [[radio control]].  Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance. 
 
 [[Sound]] can be sent by radio, sometimes through [[Frequency modulation|Frequency Modulation]] ('''FM''') or [[Amplitude modulation|Amplitude Modulation]] ('''AM'''). < ref > [https://www.britannica.com/video/214986/How-radio-works-overview-radio-waves-frequency-amplitude-modulation#:~:text=AM%20and%20FM%20radio%20carry,reach%20your%20receiver%20every%20second.

 == History of radio == 
 
 Many people worked to make radio possible. After [[James Clerk Maxwell]] predicted them, [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] in [[Germany]] first showed that [[radio wave]]s exist. < ref > [https://courses.lumenlearning.com/physics/chapter/24-1-maxwells-equations-electromagnetic-waves-predicted-and-observed/ Maxwell’s Equations: Electromagnetic Waves Predicted and Observed]. courses.lumenlearning.com.

Later inventors learned to transmit [[voice]]s, which led to [[broadcasting]] of [[news]], [[music]] and [[entertainment]].

 Radio was first created as a way to send [[telegraph]] messages between two people without wires. Then two-way radio brought voice communication, including [[walkie-talkie]]s and eventually [[mobile phone]]s. 
 
 [[Radio wave]]s are still used to send messages between people. Talking to someone with a radio is different than  " talk radio " . [[Citizens band radio]] and [[amateur radio]] use specific radios to talk back and forth. [[Policeman|Policemen]], [[Fireman|firemen]] and other people who help in [[emergency]] use a radio [[emergency communication system]] to communicate (talk to each other). It is like a [[mobile phone]], (which also uses radio signals) but the distance they reach is shorter and both people must use the same kind of radio. 
 
 The word  " radio "  is sometimes used to mean only voiceband [[broadcasting]]. Most voiceband broadcasting uses lower frequency and longer [[wavelength]] than most television broadcasting. Voiceband broadcasting sends [[music]], [[news]] and [[entertainer]]s including  " talk radio " . Radio shows were used before there were TV programs. In the 1930s, the US president started sending a message about the country every week to the American people. Companies that make and send radio programming are called [[radio station]] < nowiki/ > s. These are sometimes run by governments, and sometimes by private companies, who make money by sending [[advertisement]]s. Other radio stations are supported by local communities. These are called community radio stations. In the early days, manufacturing companies would pay to [[broadcast]] complete stories on the radio. These were often plays or [[drama]]s. Because companies who made soap often paid for them, these were called  " [[soap opera]]s " . 
 
 
 [[Microwave]]s have even higher [[frequency]]; shorter [[wavelength]]. They also are used to transmit television and radio programs, and for other purposes. [[Communications satellite]]s relay microwaves around the world. 
 
 A radio receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. Low frequency radio waves can bend around hills by [[diffraction]], although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals. 
 
 [[Shortwave radio]] frequencies are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the [[Ionosphere]]. The waves can bounce between the ionosphere and the earth to reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface.  They can reach very far, sometimes around the world. 
 
 [[Radio telescope]]s receive radio waves from the sky to study [[astronomical object]]s. [[Satellite navigation]] uses radio to determine location, and [[radar]] uses it to find and track things.
